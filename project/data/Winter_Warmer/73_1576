The nose is ginger, orange peel and christmas candles. Taste wise, the nose sits true, with a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon and a dollop of honey - maybe a tad more here than previous years, which have had a little more heat. Quite a heavy mouthfeel, which has a thick throat covering sensation which seems to come from the honey. This is a satisfying festive ale with pronounced spices.","Barnoloid","Jan 03, 2015"

I didn't see it mentioned but mine had some noticeable sediment floating.  Aromas of honey, caramel, cherry, nutmeg and cinnamon.  Taste hits up front with caramel and light cherry flavor, nutmeg and cinnamon spices hit mid palate and it finishes with an earthy hop bite woven with some honey, cherry and spice notes.  Thin end of medium body, sharp carbonation.  Bit of spice laden finish that lingers and tastes, off.  Overall one of the better Christmas ales I've had, it could use a touch less spice and a clean up on the finish.","HopBomb515","Dec 18, 2014"

However, I can't really see drinking more than one of these a day. Despite this, I think that this is still a pretty good beer worth getting. I can certainly see what Great Lakes was going for (a beer reminiscent of red Christmas ornaments) and they definitely succeeded. I would definitely recommend getting a six-pack of this. I wouldn't recommend finishing it in one session.","HattedClassic","Dec 07, 2014"

This is a filtered brew you can see right though it.  The smell is rich with spices and grains.  You also pick on some sweetness in the smell. The taste is bold with flavor, you pick up on the sweetness in this brew. You also pick up on the spies in this brew.  The mouthfeel is nice, bold and clean. This brew has a nice balance to it for having an ABV of 7.50%, you can not tell the high ABV.  There is nothing overpowering in this brew.  Great Lakes Brewing Co, did a nice job with this one.

Smell is winter seasonal (cinnamon) but not over powerful. Feel is a little effervescent but not over done. If you are a Troeg's Mad Elf fan you are expecting to get beat up on the flavor (it is only 7.5% ABV as compared to 12.5%, but it is smooth. Beer goes down nicely. Not my favorite from Great Lakes, but I do like them all!","malprep","0"

The aroma is spicy and somewhat fruity, with a traditional mulling spice combination being contrasted against notes sweet orange peel and honey-dipped bread (a challah, if you will). The flavor likewise features a forward use of cinnamon and ginger, but the rich bready malts provide a "soft" base from which the assertive spices emerge. The spicing isn't overly aggressive, but it definitely in front and deftly hides the 7.5% alcohol content. The fine, prickly carbonation emphasizes these spicy characteristics but hides the sweetness a bit, which is unfortunate. Overall, this is a lovely holiday beer, but I don't know that I'd want it more year-round.","devilben02","Jan 09, 2014"

3.79,-4.1,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"The beer pours a candied red/amber, almost like a dark fruit punch. It forms a soda-like head of spritzy white bubbles that fade into a scrim. In body the beer is thin and crystal clear, with only a bit of haze coming from its darker coloring. On the nose, the beer smells of soft, warm spices and an indiscriminately fruity malt. The spices are hard to pinpoint, but could contain nutmeg… The smell is softly spicy and festive, but not overwhelmingly pleasing. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and spicy. The spice tends far more towards the “Christmas spice” realm than towards the kick of pepper. The sweet malt almost tastes like fruit juice, and is balanced out by the spice which moves in on the middle and finish of the sip. Soft bitterness and light acidity accompany the spice for added balance. In flavor, the beer begins as sweet fruit juice, somewhere between generic fruit punch and apple juice. In the middle of the sip, the winter spices bowl onto the palate, giving hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, and generic spice. The finish is of strong winter spices with a touch of grassy bitterness. The fruit juice flavors give a touch of cranberry juice in the finish, which is festive and odd. In the mouth, the beer feels on the light side of medium, practically light, with an oddly watery mouthfeel and a soft carbonation. The mouth is left with a light spice burn, some dryness, and some saliva in the cheeks. Overall, I’m a bit underwhelmed by this iteration. It has some nice winter spice, but the malt character is oddly like fruit juice, which I don’t much care for. This is an interesting beer, but I want more bread and caramel malt flavors and less fruit juice. The spicing is nice, if a bit too much on the end. Not a bad winter warmer, but not my favorite.","Maxwell","Jan 02, 2014"

Medium bodied with a nice slick feel and well carbonated. The taste is slightly sweet with only a suggestion of spice, creating a nice balance of flavor that is subdued when compared to ST 2Xmas, which accentuates spice flavor. A nice crisp finish that brings the carbonation and spices (ginger and cinnamon) a bit more forward. If you want sweet with a hint of spice, then this beer is for you. If you prefer spice flavor, go with Southern Tier 2Xmas. Both are expertly crafted brews that achieve their respective flavor profiles.","tillmac62","Dec 11, 2013"

By the end of the bottle, the strength of this could be felt but not to the point where I wouldn't have another one of these. Two would be just about it though, as this would not be a beer to chug in large quantities. If you're decorating a gingerbread house or having a plate of cookies around the fire, grab this beer and enjoy. It's a good choice for this time of the year and not like anything else on the shelf, all while staying stylistically and seasonally true to form.","JerzDevl2000","Dec 04, 2013"

The aroma is filled with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a good dose of vanillia. The taste has less sweetness up front, instead there's a nice bitterness in its stead. Mid palate the sweetness kicks is with vanilla. The cinnamon and nutmeg last for quite awhile in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is surpisingly light making it very easy to drink. ABV is a bit high and sneaks up on you. This is a holiday classic in ohio and I don't see that changing anytime soon.","screamking","Nov 08, 2013"

It has a light aroma with hints of spice and candy. It's medium bodied and a little sharp. The finish is a little metallic and gritty. It's quite sweet and well spiced. It almost tastes like a candy cane. There's a little caramel and some juniper bitterness that lingers after the swallow. This is very clearly a Christmas Ale. The balance is pretty good but it's too sweet to have more than one.","yesyouam","Beers"

Aromas of cinnamon spiced honey sweetness, both rich and smooth. Some roasty, bready notes in the background, also. Flavors are rich and sweet, on a very smooth, robust body. Almost creamy feel in mouth. The honey creates a semisweet, solid backbone with spiced and fruit highlights. The spice profiles of nutmeg, cinnamon, and all-spice are very subtle, and blended very well. This is what fruitcake is supposed to taste like, instead of candied evil and garbage. Lightly spiced aftertaste, with the honey giving off some tropical fruit esthers, also. Smooth, clean finish. Very tasty brew, and extremely easy to drink.","GarthDanielson","Jan 02, 2013"

I would say it tastes like a gingerbread ale with a cinnamon, nutmeg, and a hint of vanilla. It reminds me of a slightly weaker Christmas version of the Southern Tier Pumking...has a good aroma (albeit slightly more subtle) and has a unique taste (by the way, Pumking is my favorite pumpkin beer).","nhaberkorn","Dec 15, 2012"

Pours lightly hazy copper amber color with a small 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, toast, brown sugar, cherry, raisin, bread, and herbal spiciness. Very nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, bread, toast, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, honey, brown sugar, raisin, and herbal spiciness. Slight spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, clove, bread, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice malt/spice flavor balance with good complexity; zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice spice amber ale! Well balanced with good flavor complexity; very smooth and easy to drink. Very enjoyable offering as expected.","superspak","Dec 08, 2012"

The ale left a thin lacing on the glass, giving reminders of your drinking progress. When sipping a winter warmer, this is a plus. The holiday aroma peaked my interest, with scents one might expect from a holiday beer including cinnamon, pine, ginger, and a hint of cookie. In the taste, one gets sweet and spicy cinnamon and honey a little later. The thickness of the ale allows this one to linger for a while. The staying power becomes nicer when one experiences the pleasant warming sensation toward the end. This is a nice warming seasonal with a pleasant aftertaste. I believe I could enjoy this one again in the future.","JohnnyHopps","Dec 08, 2012"

Delicate aromas of cinnamon, ginger, honey and caramel malt. Medium bodied with an oily feel up front, a tangy feel at the finish, and subdued carbonation. Spicy flavors across the roof of the mouth with sweet dark fruit, honey and caramel malts over the tongue. Finishes cleanly with a subtle hop bitterness. Great balance of spicy, sweet and bitter in my opinion. This was an awesome easy drinking winter warmer!","IronLover","Beers"

Perfect for the Holliday season! As far as the taste, it is the best beer I have ever had. It tastes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and Christmas cookies. The mouthfeel is extremely pleasant with the perfect balance of malts and pure utter greatness!!! I recommend this beer to anyone who likes great beer!

Lots of spice in the smell, cinnamon being the most prevelant with a complementary sweet spice (cloves?). Caramel and sweet malt also in the aroma, along with a slight roast. Altogether a very fragrant beer. Cinnamon hits the palate right off the bat, transitioning into a a sweet malt/caramel flavor, creating a very enjoyble contrast. Finishes with an unappealing bitter spice aftertaste (think the bitterness in cinnamon without the sweet). Spices are aggressive in this beer, but not in a bad way. A nice medium body, though I would have preferred a thicker beer (On the other hand, I have had thinner winter warmers...). Very nice balance to this beer, mixing the bitter spice and the sweet malt. The carbonation in the beer brings forward the spice bite, aiding in the contrast through most of the sip. I will be revisiting this beer throughout the winter, although I would like to see a tiny bit more hop presence in the beer. A great beer to keep you warm.","mwbeerman","Beers"

Now that I've gotten all the bad things about this brew out of the way, lets talk about the good things. Color is a brilliant ruby/amber with minimal haziness, smells of honeyed ginger and spice exactly as promised on the label, flavors of gingerbread and spiced Christmas cookies come through cleanly just as promised by the nose, fresh, sharp, and clean flavors overall that really make me feel like the holidays...

The nose is mostly cinnamon, nutmeg and maybe a touch of vanilla. In the mouth the first impression is toffee, followed by the spices and a nice dryness. There's a slight hops bitterness that provides some structure and prevents the beer from being too sweet. More carbonation than might be expected from the limited bubbles reveals itself as well. The mouthfeel is medium to full, and a little slick. This is a very nice winter beer, showcasing the spices without being too heavy-handed. The keg version is superior to the bottled version.","MCDuhamel","Nov 03, 2011"

Like grandmas gingerbread cookies, but finished with an incredibly clean taste. A pleasant brandy-like alcohol warmth fills the esophagus after a few swallows, but no burning or heaviness.

Nose expresses nutmeg, allspice and cinnamon. Taste consistent with nose - a very spicy Winter Warmer indeed. Honey makes it's presence known towards the finish; however, there's also and herbal, perhaps spruce-like quality in the middle.

The taste holds notes of orange peel (and plenty of it), pumpkin shell, ginger, nutmeg, wheat, grass, rye bread, and a touch of cocoa powder. A strong bitterness pervades the finish, which follows a poor mixing of the various flavors. Something's amiss here.

The honey imparts an interesting character to the nose. Fruit, honey, caramel malt, and spices contribute to a pleasant flavor profile.

Not for the faint of palate. For me, a lover of bold, extreme tongue sensation, it electrified but somehow drank very lovely. Not what I think of or consider as far as winter warmers go (I prefer the dark malt / dried fruit characters of the Belgian noels) - but it fits the bill.

Flavor is less spicy or sweet than expected, with a strong malt body and a finish balanced with honey sweetness and grainy, cinnamon dryness.

Mouthfeel is ok due to the carbonation, but I just can't get past the overwhelming spicyness of this brew. For me drinkability of his beer is non existent. There is just too much of a spice presence.

Medium-bodied, firm carbonation keeps a steady backbeat, nothing lazy about this beer. Dry and wiry, as if looking to be more of a thirst quencher than sweet holiday kiss. The honey blends well with the orange citrus while the clove, cinnamon, coriander, ginger spice enlivens throughout. Not many moments of fruit, fig, apple or pear.

The spice is in control though. I try to keep an open mind with a beer like this. I don't like spiced beers as a rule. As this style goes it's one of the better ones. Cloves, cinamon, a ton of nutmeg, anise, I'm sure there are more that I can't identify right away. Very malty-sweet. I think they use honey or maybe brown sugar to help it along. It has a little bit of a herbal bitterness from the hops in the finish. I think that is why it is a little more balanced than some of the other examples. It helps to cut the spice a little and cleanse the pallet between sips. If I'm in the right mood one is somewhat enjoyable. I can't do a second.

4.1,3.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a brilliantly clear copper with nice visible carbonation and a very short lived head which was disappointing. Aroma is strong on the ginger side with a floating presence of cinnamon and some nice deep malt. Reminds me a bit of Magic Hat's Odd Notion which I am also a fan of. This is nice, though, since you get the sort of "bakery smells" in a way only captured by beer. I'd say it could use a little hit from the hops in the aroma to really hit home.. even just a bit since this is not supposed to be an overly hoppy beer, although I think a more aggressively hopped version of this would actually work out very well. Taste is bitter and woody.. like being in an antique store where the smells are coming from so many directions from so many different places and times that it produces a wholly unique flavor. Very similar to Odd Notion again. At 7.5% ABV, I would have never guessed it to be much over 5. Carbonation is a little prickly in the mothfeel but I don't think it takes away from the experience. A pretty medium body, but complemented with a ton of malt flavor- the combination seems a little contradictory but it ends out working really great. I don't find much that takes away from the drinkability of this beer but I can see myself being turned off by it in the very long run due to some of the spices. This beer gets a lot of hype and it's definitely good but, I'll mention it again, try it back to back with Odd Notion and see if you really get that much of a difference.","wiseguy142","Dec 06, 2008"

Flavor was malty sweet, nice amount of spices, again with the cinnamon and nutmeg, along with a bit of orange peel for good measure. A nice piney hop flavor shows up here and there.

That being said I grabbed a single as soon as I spotted it, having heard mixed reviews I wanted to try one before I parted with $10 for a sixer. All in all this is a pleasant spicy warmer of a brew, I did expect something a little thicker and more powerful. Aroma is mild and well balanced with honey and clover mixed with a nice touch of ginger, not powerful but very mellow. Color is a dark copper with an amber-red hue, nice big head that dissipates leaving lots of lacing. Light on the palate with a cool dry finish the mouthfeel isn't as heavy as I wanted but it works. Flavor is medium bodied with an initial burst of honey leading way to the subtle spices. Malty and spicy it's definately not overdone as can happen all to easily with this style.

4.6,16.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Crystal clear golden brown with about a finger of white head. Aroma is of ginger, honey, and a little cinnamon. Nicely sweet, not at all too sweet. The flavor shows about the same balance as the aroma. The ginger stand out a bit more than the other flavors and lingers a little longer, but the sweetness of the honey and the spiciness of the cinnamon provide a nice balance. Medium bodied with a bit of creaminess. This would be great to have around during the holiday season.","nvsblman","Jul 12, 2007"

Very tasty though. a veritable fruitcake of flavors...nutmeg is the most pronounced, with a lot of ginger as well and cinnamon....not over the top in flavor though...spices run thick but there's a nice malt backbone in it.

This beer is quite light and drinkable, in fact it drinks much easier than even 7.5%. I really like the spice levels in this beer, it is quite noticeable, but not so dominating that it is distracting.

For some reason, a Christmas beer has to be more cloudy to be festive. The aroma is very festive indeed. Plenty of X-mas spices like some nutmeg and cinnaon and anise all mixed together very well with a toasty malt profile. The taste is a little more clear on whats really driving the beer's flavors. Lots of nutmeg adn a few hints of chammomile. Don't forget the cinnamon. All of these spices are blanaced with a light Pacific hop presence and a medium toasty alt stance.

The taste is an explosion of honey- enough to make this really be more of a Braggot in style, and more of the same spice on the nose.

On the palate, brisk carbonation at first, then warm orangey spices and sweet malts. The palate is well balanced and not cringingly spiced. Mouthfeel is quite nice, with a thick body and plenty of carbonation to scrub the palate. Overall, this is an excellent winter warmer. Not as subtle as it could be, but not out of whack either.

The carbonation in this beer is higher than what you might find in a stout, porter or other beer that is largely malt influenced, but compliments the beer quite nicely. This beer is easy enough to drink, but definitely something that you wouldn't want to drink too fast. This beer is one of those, in my opinion, that you can only drink a certain number of in one sitting before you start to get sick of it. The malty character just becomes too much to handle.

Up front in the taste were spices like nutmeg and cinnamon, and then after all those spices a strong hoppy citrus flavor emerged. A strong hop aftertaste lingered on for a while after that.

The full body you expect in Great Lakes brews. I generally like ginger and honey but a little nutmeg and cinnamin go a long way. Favors suffer from a bitter finish of lingering spices and vienna malts that really turned me off this beer. I think the overall effect of the spices and malts is very unbalanced. Drinkability suffers as the result. Alcohol is well hidden. I still recommend trying it. Let your taste buds decide - Merry Christmas to all and to all a well crafted brew.","karst","Nov 26, 2005"

Sweet honey flavor combined with spices. Somewhat clumsy..seems like ingredients are just thrown together, if that makes any sense. I'm not sure I agree with the combination of honey and spices like this..just seems like they mixed a honey beer and a spicy beer together by accident. I couldn't really pick up individual flavors, so it left me with a spicy honey aftertaste. Medium bodied, oily mouthfeel.

Some noble hops and pale malt in the nose, but mostly ginger, cinnamon, annd some indistinct holiday spices. The sweet toasted malt flavor melds ginger and faint pine into the taste, and the bittering hops cleanse the palate leaving a dry aftertaste, with some residual honey. Appropriatly spiced, but leans towards the bitter side. The spice and pine flavors become cloying, even with good carbonation and a medium body. A harsh finish detracts greatly from the drinkability.","PBRstreetgang","Sep 15, 2005"

Easier on the toungue as well, smoother, and the hops come out, they were a little hidden in fresher bottles. I think it is easier to drink with a little maturity. Much smoother, a little less burn from the spices. Overall a very nice beer, even though the last thing I need to be in July is 'warmed!'","hustlemuscle","May 14, 2005"

It would be unfair to review a beer in such a condition. However, my curiosity finally got the best of me, and my fears proved unfounded. This beer poured out a clear orange, with plenty of suspended floaties. The aroma is spicy, mainly ginger, but also some cinnamon. Sweet honey and malt flavor, along with the aforementioned spices. Thankfully, this beer avoids the trap of the cloying spiciness of too many winter warmers. More drinkable than most beers of the style. I am suprised to read that the abv is 7.5%.

I wouldn't really bother cellaring this beer, but then who knows? Anyway, pours a reddish copper color with a nice beige head, which quickly dissipated. Has a pretty strong ginger and cinnamon smell and quite a spicy taste followed by honey, and a little bitter snap aftertaste. The mouthfeel is decent. Hmm, now the hard part. I'm not big into spiced beers though I am slowly acquiring a taste for things like coriander or even ginger in my beer. Pretty strong so I can't see drinking lots of these.

Pungent, spciy flavor of sweet malt and spice, cinnamon and a bit of clove and nutmeg, and a bit of spruce riding beneath. Hop presence is understated, nearly all in the finish and aftertaste.

3.97,0.5,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a clear medium red color with one finger of head. There is just a tiny bit of lacing. The smell is dominant with cinammon, but also has hints of nutmeg and cherry to it. The taste has lots of cinammon and honey sweetness that is just a tad cloying. A good bite of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is just a little light for this style. The drinkability is very very good though for a 7.5% brew. Enjoyable as a dessert beer, and I might even try mulling it.","SheepNutz","Nov 16, 2003"
4.35,10.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This is even more enjoyable on tap! Better balance, smoother mouthfeel, and just oiverall better flavor (or perhaps it's just this year's edition.) On tap at Sapphire's in WashCo.","aaronh","Nov 15, 2003"
4.35,10.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Nice dark copper copper with a great light tan head that clings to the sides of the glass leaving excellent lacing. It smells of cinnamon and ginger, with hints of all spice. The tastes were similar with roasted barley and a little sweetness. The spiceyness or the higher alcohol content were not overpowering. I really like this one and look forward to it every year.","irishmoss","Nov 15, 2003"
4.22,6.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Deep ruby color with a fluffy head. Laces nicely down the glass while the head retention is outstanding. Nose is a blend of Christmas with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger and perhaps some additional spices. Taste features more of the same, with the main emphasis on cinnamon and allspice with mild traces of honey. As the beer reaches room temperature, a malty profile presents itself, keeping this winter warmer in balance. Mouthfeel is quite clean with active bubbles creating a tingling sensation. This beer drinks very well, but due to the spiciness it possesses (not to mention the abv), I would reserve this one for a nightcap by the fire, with a slice of pumpkin cheesecake, or something similar. A really nice holiday ale with a great deal of character.","Jon","Oct 30, 2003"
4.17,5.6,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours out golden copper with a creamy head. Smells like Christmas in a glass, hence the name. All warming aromas of honey, cinnamon, and ginger. The taste adds on to the aroma with malty tones and a slight warming from the ABV. I think I know what will accompany my turkey this Thanksgiving.","smitty1080","Jun 18, 2003"
3.75,-5.1,4,4,4,3.5,3,"Quite an attractive pour-golden caramel set beneath a mound of off white head that settles down easily yet never vanishes. Wonderful seasonal quality to the nose with all the spices chiming in-cinnamon and nutmeg first then a tease of ginger enveloped in sweet malt. In the mouth the beer comes off very aggresive in the way of alcohol. The cinnamon is a tad too aggresive as well, and comes off as overtly hot/spicy. The finish is of those red cinnamon balls your Grandmother used to pawn of on you when you were young. This beer tastes as if it might be an Elliot Ness in an all spiced up holiday package. A decent holiday treat from a great brewery. This would go well with some bread pudding perhaps.","moulefrite","May 20, 2003"
4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"It's medium bodied and what I liked is that it didn't overpower me with the cinnamon/spicey winter beer thing. Good job","jcalabre","Apr 24, 2003"

4,1.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Mmm mmm good. Surprisingly on tap in April, this seasonal brew still had plenty of snap and talked back with some serious gusto. The look is great with a dark red amber hue, adequate head retention and some fair lacing. Lots of spice in the nose and taste, though to be honest, the flavors are all quite subtle and understated. The alcohol doesn't show through, perhaps because of the spice overlay, and this is very drinkable, but for the high ABV. GLBC just keeps on keeping on.","AtLagerHeads","Feb 13, 2003"
3.82,-3.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer pours a slightly hazy slightly dark brownish red color with a moderate tan head. The mouthfeel is moderate. The smell is spice mostly ginger and cinnamon. The taste is strong ginger and spice in front with mild malty cinnamony finish. A good spicy holiday season ale with a very deceptive alcohol content.","fattyre","Jan 07, 2003"

4.67,18.2,4.5,5,4.5,4,5,"*.I rate the drinkability high for a seasonal sipping beer....not for as if you'd want to drink 12 of these in a sitting...rather if you gave me my choice of several holiday beers I'd rather drink this one than most..","ZAP","Dec 27, 2002"
3.52,-10.9,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Not dark enough for mahogany, the red isn't backed up enough by the brown for that. The head is wimpy. The aroma reminded me of black cherries, sweet but without the sourness. Nice but really big malt along with the mild spicing makes it seem a bit cake-like. The black cherries carry through into the flavor. Nice beer but not outstanding.","aracauna","Beers"
4.47,13.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The flavor offers a very nice blend of softly sweet malt with a touch of honey and chocolate, and mild spice (cinnamon, ginger). It finishes semi-dry with a lingering sweet malt, some clear cinnamon flavor, and a drying spiciness. The alcohol is almost completely hidden! Very well-balanced with just enough spice to keep it interesting throughout the glass, but not overwhelm the palate. Definitely a seasonal to look forward to!","NeroFiddled","0"

3.68,-6.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Found on draught at the Grid Iron Brewpub. As with most beers this has more character from the tap. Poured a rich dark orange/red with a foamy light beige head. Pleasantly spiced aroma. Flavor of spices (ginger and cinnamon) with some malt made it a nice winter warmer. Slight hops finish. Good to have at this time of year.","Dogbrick","Nov 23, 2002"
4.25,7.6,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Brown glass bottle with hard to read dating, but looks like it says enjoy by 15 FEB 03. Pours a slightly hazy reddish copper with a light tan head. Aroma is faint, but I detect malt and honey. Flavors explode from several directions. Big malt flavor from one, honey and cinnamon from another. Well balanced, flavor is slightly sweet. Finishes very well except for one aftertaste I don't like that creeps in and lingers. Not sure, but it seems to be an alcohol aftertaste. Of course the solution to this is simply to take another drink because up to that point this beer is great. Another very good Great Lakes.","PhantomVodoo","Nov 16, 2002"
4.03,2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a reddish amber color and formed an amazing off white foamy head that left some circular lace as it subsided. It had an aroma of malt and cinammon. The flavor was of malt, cinammon and touch of ginger. A good beer from Great Lakes, but a bit pricey.","Wildman","Beers"
4.12,4.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a copper color with a decent orangish white head. Notes of cinnamon on the smell. Malty spicy taste. A real solid beer, maybe a little too much cinnamon, but by no means bad. A good interpretation of the style. Another good reason to live in Ohio.","jtw5877","0"
