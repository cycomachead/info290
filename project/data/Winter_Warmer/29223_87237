The chocolate and roasted malt is more predominant in the taste, along with toffee, raisins and  dark cherries. Medium mouth with some carbonation. Not much spice for a winter warmer, but it's a very nice beer, somewhere between a strong ale and a porter.","MartzMimic","Feb 20, 2015"

Sweet aroma, with fruit, some malt overtones, roasty, and chocolate. Moderate mouth feel (not thin, but not thick, either), but satisfying. Smokey, malty taste; the fruit taste is subtle and controlled. Sweetness is evident but not overpowering in the beginning, but becomes a bit cloying by the end. Very mild hop bitterness in the middle. I don't generally go for fruit beers, but this one is nicely balanced. All of the ""extra"" ingredients (cacao, vanilla, raisins, brown sugar) add subtle and very pleasant taste. This is a good tasting ale, even though as it warms the sweetness becomes a bit too much for me. YMMV.","MNAle","Dec 12, 2014"

Aroma of dry raisin and brown sugar with a healthy dose of caramelized sugar is very interesting. Taste is also dominated by a healthy dose of caramelized malt with some dry raisins notes and some light residual brown sugar notes. Body is bit light to sustain all the spices and dry fruits notes with medium carbonation. Interesting beer but seems to be lacking a little bit malt profile.","Phyl21ca","Apr 20, 2014"

Taste is much like the nose. Really I only get dark fruits, maybe a little brown sugar, really just not that much going on but it is pretty tasty but nothing special to be sure. Mouthfeel is ironically slightly thick even though it seems not very carbonated. Just not a very complex beer in my opinion.
