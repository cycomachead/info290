"Overall, a nice brew, but certainly not worth seeking out."

"O - Good beer to drink in the winter time.  More of a beer to drink several of rather than a single one with dinner.  Not as heavy as expected.  3.5/5"
""
"Very tasty! It is full of spices and excellent during the winter time."

"I personally love this seasonal ale. My local liquor store had a few extra bottles, lucky for me!"
"Living a mile away from Great Lakes it's hard to find a Christmas Ale better than GL's. This beer may have done just that."
"Breckenridge Christmas Ale pours brilliant garnet tinged chestnut under a thin, off-white foam cap that marks each drink with a thin line. Dried fruit on the nose accompanies dark sugar and cake aromas.  Dark, rich cakey bread leads the palate with spice, figs and a suspicion of cherry sweetened with light molasses with an earthy hop presence in the background."

"Pours deep amber, nice head, great aroma of malt and spices. A tad bitter on the end but a great balance of flavors. Not exactly a winter warmer, but a good beer!"

"A decent, but certainly not extraordinary, winter warmer."
""
""
""
"Not the worst Christmas  beer out there."
""

"This is a wonderful Christmas Ale.  Beautiful color and foamy  head, with a warm, delightful bready flavor. Sweet, smooth and flavorful."
""
""
""
"12/20...pours light brown, touches of foam on top. Minor nose, caramel malts, bready. Tasty malt open, buried spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, raisins,  and a tightly packed hop at the finish. Incongruous."
""
""
""
""
"Pouring beer into a glass is overrated, so I won't comment on the color on this pass.  It tastes more vanillay than most other winter warmers.  It's as if Breck just tweak their Vanilla porter recipe to get this brew.  It does stack up higher than the average beer in regards to abv but the elevated alcohol content is not discernible in the taste.  Malt caramel flavors up front."
""
""
""
"Overall: A pretty decent take on a Winter Warmer. The winter spice is very subtle but there is a nice toasty caramel malt flavor."
""
"Had this poured into my mug. Decent amount of off-white head, average lacing, average carbonation. Notes of hazelnut and molasses, but nothing too strong. The color is a medium brown, very inviting. Frankly would have just liked more flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Breckenridge Xmas ale is ok....the beer poured ruby amber with thin slightly offwhite head that is leaving a spotty lace.  The scent carries slight lactose and some spices.  The taste is bitter thou the draw and a funky after taste.  The body is medium with decent carbonation.  Overall....its ok..."

"maybe I'm just uncultured but it tastes like a christmas tree"
""
""
""
"Has a kind of wintery feeling to it, good for those family gatherings you really hate.  But - it isn't so high in alcohol that you'll be stumbling around, tripping over a string of christmas lights, embarrassing your wife and validating the dislike the inlaws have always had for you.  Plus the label is nice and festive!  It's a must-have for late november and all of december."

"From bottle, no date. Pours a dark, though very clear, copper with a white head. Aroma is very mild, some raisin-like aromas, rich malt. Taste is all malt, not picking up much in the way of Christmas spices, mostly a rich roasted caramel malt backbone balanced well with mild bitterness. Mouthfeel is rich and slightly sticky. I wish it was colder outside, maybe I would have enjoyed this more in New Hampshire, but in Texas, I am less impressed."

"Christmas Ale brewed by Breckenridge Brewery with an ABV of 7.40% This brew pours out a nice brown color with a nice light brown head. The smell is rich with flavor and grains. You also pick up on some spices in the smell. Christmas Ale is a really inviting brew. The taste is bold with flavor you pick up on the grains and malts in this brew. This brew has a nice balance to it, there is nothing over powering in this brew. The aftertaste is nice with a burnt caramel taste. You don't notice the high ABV in this brew.  The mouthfeel is rich and filling. Christmas Ale is smooth but bold tasting brew.  This was better than what I was expecting.  I would buy this brew again.  Over all I'm giving this brew a 4.25 out of 5."
"    Overall a 4.25 for Christmas Ale - Breckenridge Brewery. I copped a case of this this the day my local grocer that's got a decent craft selection got it shipped in, so I'm glad I got a fairly decently fresh six pack. I will probably buy this brew again."

"This is a good winter seasonal.  Had it on tap at the brewpub with some barbecue and was pretty darn happy.  It's a little higher alcohol than some winter beers, but not so much that it knocks you out after one or two.  Not as intensely flavored as some others of this style, and a bit subtle, but if that's what you like then give this a try."

"Seasonal beers are definitely not my thing but if anything out beats the crown vally imperial pumpkin in the seasonal category it's this Christmas ale by Breckenridge it's absolutely amazing the taste is great very flavorful it has a nice color and it is a beer that you could drink at anytime I've even seen it come in mini kegs and that's bad ass around Christmas you would be insane to not pick this up if you see it"

"Over All: An easy drinking beer but I was a bit disappointed as it was not what I expected for a winter warmer. The beer just did not give me a satisfying finish for the style. Not a bad beer but not what I expected."

"Pours a dark reddish brown with a massive tan head. Aromas of vanilla, citrus and brown sugar. Taste begins with some vanilla, then some orange, then a big caramel malt finish. A tiny bit of bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouth feel is full. Overall an easy drinking winter warmer."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 1/20/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear orange copper color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of raisin, plum, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, chocolate, light roast, pine, floral, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and moderate hop notes; with good strength. Taste of raisin, plum, caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, light roast, floral, pine, grass, and herbal earthiness. Light amount earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark fruit, caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown bread, light roast, floral, and light pine on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of malt and hop flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice winter warmer style. Good balance and robustness of malt and earthy/spicy hop flavors; and smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"Not world class but very good... I could and probably will have this again closer to Christmas..."

"O: This beer falls just a little shy of being really great. I really appreciate a holiday beer that doesn't load in the spices. Breckenridge Christmas does a great job of capturing the essence of the season without resorting to the token buckets full of nutmeg and cinnamon. I just would have liked a little more depth and complexity of malt flavors. As it is, this is still a great seasonal offering with above average drinkability."

"Beer is a darkish brown that is clear with slightly tannishand creamy head that dissipates quickly. Smell is strongly that of malt. Strong gingerbread notes and bready smells. No citrus or hop notes. Taste is also malty with a hop finish. In addition to the bready malt, the taste also has a gingerbread note to it. The hop finish is a bit butter with a grapefruit note. Mouthfeel is smooth with hints of carbonation. Medium bodied but with a little texture to it. Overall, a decent beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"There's a pretty creamy smoothness working well with just a little crispness in what's a nice, solid medium body. Hops coming out into the finish lend a little dryness to a sweeter end."

"Overall a pretty good cold weather beer. Would recommend if you are in a festive mood, but don't hurt yourself trying to find it. I wish the spices were more prominent, but enjoyable nonetheless. Cheers"
"Bought a six pack for Christmas, finally opened some tonight. The drink poured with a large head and some patchy lacing on the sides. The drink has a dark brown amber appearance. Aromas of malt and some hints of vanilla. A very slight roasty smell; I could sense some of the caramel and chocolate the beer advertises that it has, but it seemed faint, at least to me. The flavor is sweet with a toffee-ish taste with malt and nutmeg flavors detected. Medium body with a good balance. Overall, a pretty good seasonal drink."

"O-Well balanced and very drinkable. Starts a little sweet but the varied malt profile keeps everything in check. Nice beer"

"Overall a good Christmas brew, it did the job for the family and me, tis the season."

"Overall: A decent enough Winter Warmer; not crazy about the way the hops and malts blend together but that is a relatively minor quibble"
""
"Breckenridge's Christmas Ale pours mahogany brown, with a little bit of amber highlights making themselves known as I hold the beer up to light. About a finger and a half of cream colored foam tops the beer, and while head retention is somewhat average, there's plenty of lacing left around the glass. The nose is disappointingly muted. Some caramel and a general spice aroma are appreciable, but neither exactly leaps out of the glass. The flavor profile is similarly dull. There's some caramel sweetness up front, and after seeing the beer's description on Breckenridge's mention chocolate I was able to pick up on a little bit (though maybe just because I was looking for it). There's a moderate bitterness present mid palate, and the finish is light holiday spices. I'm not quite sure if it's ginger or nutmeg, maybe a blend of the two. The body could stand to be a little bit more substantial, but the carbonation has a nice little kick to it. I just wasn't that impressed with Breckenridge's Christmas ale, it's a very ho-hum winter offering."

"Overall - Average, not terrible but many better beers of this style out there. Needs some more flavor, too weak fruit wise. Malts are good and bold but not balanced very well. Nothing i need to ever try again."
"Breast and chewy but it is a medium mouthfeel. Some decent spicy bitterness but this a malt forward beer. Lots of caramel and a nice figgy character. A very solid winter warmer."
""
""
"O: A solid Christmas ale with very nice malt flavors and not too much spice. Definitely preferable to over-spiced winter beers, thats for sure. This one will definitely warm you up on a cold winter night"
"Notes: A decent and drinkable Winter Warmer. Cheers."
""
""
""
""
"A simple, unpretentious example of the style. At least it's not overloaded with spice."
"Not bad for a light X-mas ale. The spicing is pretty high in this beer, but nice to have every once in a while."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall it is hard to believe this is a Christmas ale, the spice profile is basically non existent. Nice maltiness though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is very nice, caramel in color. Looks to be a nice heavy ale. Very citrus hoppy smell. Taste, Lemon pledge mixed with hairspray...almost synthetic . Mouthfeel is full however and actually a little pleasant! Overall however, I really tried to get through the entire bottle. Alas, I had to cast the last third to the polluted depths of the lake that caught on fire to be with its kind. I am not a fan."
""
""
"Poured a clear rich tawny color with a half finger creamy off white head atop,nice broken lace left behind as it settles slowly.Dark fruit leafy somewhat spicy hops in the nose,a little cakiness in the background as well.Decent flavors but they lack depth,a decent leafy hoppiness goes pretty well with mild caramel and dark fruit sweetness,drying in the finish.The problem is the flavors all end abruptly,it's close to being really damn good,it's still a pretty decent winter warmer as is."
"Sweet malt says a quick 'hi' to your tongue before being inundated with a peppery holiday spice mix. There is a faint banana flavor that mixes with the spice near the end, until a bit of alcohol takes that over. Dry, spicy finish."

"I enjoyed this brew. The spices are not too overdone, the brew goes down nice and easy. Thanks for the brew bro..."
""
""
""

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, there is some complexity to it but overall it’s just a mediocre beer."

"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark orange amber with a 1 finger bubbly white head. Head didn't last long at all. Aroma was of sour fruit, with a bit of alcohol if you got up close. A very small touch of sweetness. Taste was sweet to finish, but started off with very mild and well balanced. A hint of spice, but also traces of a chocolate. Interesting, but very mellow flavors. A bit under stated. Intensified the longer it sat. Felt good in the mouth, coated well with the right amount of carbonation. Not a bad winter warmer, just a bit more subtle than I normally expect."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The carbonation level is also too high for this style and there isn't much going on beyond the the malt backbone."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a dark burnt orange/reddish hue body with a medium sized foamy beige head that has decent lasting power. Aroma of wet bread, some burnt caramel, and yeast. The flavor is basically malts with some notes of gingerbread, caramel, toast, and some light fruit rinds. I was disappointed as I expected more spices and maybe creaminess as well The body has a medium mothfeel and lighter carboantion but a sort of slimy feel as it coats your mouth. Wanted more out of this one after a long search for this one."
""
""
""
"Overall a very good winter warmer very reminiscent of an Old Ale. Would definitely buy again."

"O- While I did not expect much from this beer I enjoyed it more and more as time went on, while its taste is rather mild it is pleasant and while not considered a sessionable beer It is one i can see myself enjoying a couple of."
"Breckenridge Christmas Ale is a very clear and sparkling ruby ale with a sand colored head that fades to a bubbly film and leaves very nice lacing on the glass. It has sort of a sweet malty aroma of caramel and chocolate. The hops seem a little spicy and there may be orange peel in there. It's pretty light bodied and smooth. The finish is quick, clean and dry. It doesn't taste sweet like it smells. It's almost a little salty. DMS is detected, along with a note of cherry or plum. It's reasonably bitter. The bitterness lingers for a while after the finish, along with a peppery rumble and maybe phenol. It tastes ok, but it's not very focused. It goes down pretty smooth, but it's a little strange tasting. Maybe I shouldn't be drinking Christmas ale in January."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dr: Drinkable, but unremarkable and a bit boring due to its muted nature."
"I like this take on the style. There is a hint of cinnamon, but this is decidedly a malt-forward winter warmer. A quite tasty one"
""
""
""
"O- It's always disappointing when someone recommends a beer and you spend money on it but end up disliking it. C'est la vie."
""
"Breckenridge Christmas Ale pours a deep murky mahogany color with a cream colored head. A patch of bubbles and thin film are what remain after the head recedes. A nice sheet of light sticky lacing clings to the glass. The aroma is Christmas in a glass to me- a combination of pine, cedar, and orange peel immediately awaken my nose. Also, faint roasted malts linger in the background. The taste profile also starts out with an earthy, woody cinnamon-cedar note. Bright orange peel follows, mixed with some malt sweetness. The finish is piny hops, completing a well-rounded excursion into my favored Christmas Ale year after year. There is a notable tartness in the aftertaste. On a side note, I dig the artwork on the bottle, it has a weird Dickensonian feel about it to me."
""
""
"A bit thinner than other winter/Christmas ales, but a good easy drinking beer."
""
""
""
"Overall - A nice tasting winter seasonal. Not too overly spiced, and balanced well with the malt character. Give it a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a pretty decent brew but definitly not one of my favorites, really has a taste that makes sense for the season but not so much on the smell, appearance is good"
""
""
"Breckenridge's Christmas Ale brought me plenty of good Christmas cheer. It is an ideal holiday ale as it has plenty of delicious malt and hop flavour yet is balanced and moderate enough so as to appeal to more mild drinkers as well. In other words, it's an excellent option for family or work get togethers; a real crowd (and beer geek) pleaser."
""
""
"Overall a pretty good Winter Warmer, but that's about it. Nothing outstanding, but worth a try."
""
"Overall:	Not bad it is an average holiday beer."
"I don't find much reasons to drink Breckenridge beers. You could call this one a Dark Pizza Parlor Lager and it might score better."
""
"O: Very tasty Christmas ale with good flavor and aroma. Would grab this again."
""
""
"A good offering, goes down easy as well. Pretty good stuff though."
"Decent carbonation and medium body, but overall this beer just seems a little thin to me. No complexity at all, not horrible, just nothing to make me want another."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a cloudy, dark brown color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of earthy malt, hint of sweet malt, hint of hops, and a hint of oatmeal. Fits the style of a Winter Warmer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, all spice, earthy malt, and a hint of hop. Overall, good appearance, but average at best in other aspects."
"O – Nice solid brew here. Easy drinker and tasty all around."
"-JH-"
"O. A rather good beer to enjoy on Xmas."
""
"O - A non-eventful ale. There is something I can't figure out - I keep thinking it's diacetyl in the aftertaste. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it's there on purpose. Anyway, a decent beer, but I'm not running out for more."
"I'll pass on a 2nd one of these."
""
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly above average carbonation. Overall, a decent brew, but nothing to be amazed over."
""
""
""
""
"D/O: Not a bad offering from Breckenridge, but I'm just admittedly not a huge fan of all that Caramel malts. The hops and spices gave it a little mileage for me, but in the end it just feels like I'm being bludgeoned by syrupy/bready caramel sweetness, and I'm just not digging it."
"Overall: This is an alright Christmas beer. I would have either liked more spices or to clean up the taste a bit if they wanted to go the other way."
""
""
""
"O: A bit less spiced than expected but still very good."
"From the 2011 batch. Sampled on December 1, 2011. The pour is a handsome dark amber with a silky, tan head that lingers momentarily. I will give it a higher mark for the way it looks. However the aroma is pretty routine with mellow dark malts, a slight hop note, and little in the way of winter spicing. The body is in the medium range so it makes a slight comeback with that. The taste is an above average combination of barley malts and a moderately bitter quality that leaves a tingle at the end."
""
""
""
""
"O: decent beer, nothing spectacular, it would be a good social beer, surprisingly drinkable for a slightly higher abv. it has a good balance of sweet and bitter. i could easily drink a few of these in a sitting and not feel bad about it."
"Did not do it for me. Went in with decent expectations, came away disappointed. Cut against Goose island and Great Lakes in same night, and a very distant third. Much better seasonal Ales out there. I will not be back, and rest in fridge is going to move slow."
""
"Overall / Drinkability: A decent winter warmer. I suspect it would have been better in a snifter given the weak aromas. I wasn't sure about the spice and hop combination, but by the end of the glass it grew on me and I found it enjoyable. Again, decent. Not outstanding, not amazing, but decent and worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very, very nice beer. Compare it to St Arnold Christmas"
""
""
""
""
"It's a good winter warmer and will go on my short list ...again."
"Pours a deep brownish red color which is a ruby red color when its held to the light. There is only a slight skim head which gives way to skim around the edges. The head leaves some strings of lace on the glass. The aroma is a little faint, there are hints of caramel malts along with cinnomom and clove as well as some other spiciness. The taste follows close suit to the nose. The taste is a little faint not as full as I had hoped for. There is a caramel malt backbone with a hint of sweetness to it. There is also touches of cinnomon and clove along with a very slight hop bite in the back end. The hope bite is balanced and not over the top. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and a little stingy. Overall it as an okay beer, I wanted a bigger fuller flavor out of it. It a very easy drink. The abv is dangerously well hidden."
"Overall - It wasn't remarkable, but not bad either, just a decent winter warmer here."
"Overall – Not my favorite winter warmer by a long shot. Tick."
"Drinkability – I enjoyed this more than it sounds. I was expecting something a bit more substantial and this turned out to be a session beer which OK isn’t all that bad."
"I would recommend this warmer for when you don't want so much spice and crazy xmasness. This one is more like a real beer, and a good one."
"O - Not what I'd expect from a ""Christmas Ale"" but a very good beer that Breckenridge should be proud of."
"O: I am shocked that breckenridge would put their name on this beer. They make some amazing beers and this is by far the worst one from them."
"i know it is a bit early for a christmas beer, but with the first snows falling outside, i couldnt resist the new tap at my local. poured a festive redish color with almost no head to speak of. smells of caramel malts, winter spice, and alcohol. taste is similar to the smell, with some subtle hops joining the mix. a well balanced seasonal brew strong enough to warm the soul. the mouthfeel is perfect for this one as well, on the heavier side, but not filling. a great evening sipper as the snow falls out front"
"3.0 D: To summarize: Not much going on, but nothing bad."
"This beer poured out with a nice red colored body and a light tan head on top. The lacing on this one was decent. The smell of the beer had some sweet malts in there mixed with a sturdy amount of christmas spices. The taste of the beer reminded me of a Sam Adams winter lager. There was plenty of flavors in this stuff to warm you up in the cold season. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied and was highly drinkable. Overall this beer fits the season nicely I think."
"O - Decent Christmas brew. My brother really like this one. A good price too. Worth a shot if you haven't tried it."
"I'm guessing this is the right place to put this review as the only other one listed is the Christmas Ale 2010 entry... Big thanks goes out to robwestcott for sending me this one as an extra in a past trade! Bottle #968 of 1400! 2008 Vintage Limited Special Edition! Served from a 33 oz. swing-top bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured a deep reddish brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, caramel, sweet alcohol, and slight peat. The flavor was of sweet malt, caramel, subtle peat, and very slight oxidation. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. Had a pretty nice flavor here minus the slight oxidation I got on it. The aroma was quite nice too. Not sure if I would put this one in the Winter Warmer category if I'm honest but still a pretty good brew. Really glad I got a chance to try this one!"
"A more modest carbonation yields a small head here; the lacing does a good beery job of sticking though. Cookie dough, burnt sugar, plum pudding and toasted bread show not only its strength but the thickness of malt from the aroma. Creamy full body. Full malt jacket here--this beer is not kidding around. Brown bread, brown sugar, toasted marshmallows and a toasted husk flavor abound. Warmth kicks in mid-pint and stays mellow. Hops are certainly big enough to at least stand up to the sizable maltiness. The bitterness does not try to crush the malt, but rather tames it. Sweet, roasty and slightly hoppy finish."
"A solid ""winter warmer"" (it is a fairly high 7.4% ABV), but not outstanding."
"D: Very nice little brew here.... Fits the style to a tee... Worth looking for during the Winter months."
"D: This is a nicely robust ale. Malty and hoppy, with a just noticeable finger on the malt side of the scale. Alcohol is discernable, but plays well with others. A good, some might say understated, borderline ""big"" seasonal. A sort of heft brown, perhaps aged a bit. Very English in style rather than some American spiced seasonal contraption."
"Breckenridge Christmas looks very chestnut brown in color with a cinnamon tan foam about an inch in height with pretty good legs but no lacing. Smell is all caramel malt and some nutty appeal, spices are really not in the picture. Taste is malty and caramel and nuts and a bit of spice but not much. There is a taste of alcohol towards the end, the 7.4 is not muted well. Don't get any hops and this is not reminding me of christmas. It's pretty much a very malty brown ale IMO. Feel is a big medium, malty, not bitter, smooth and fairly carbed. I drank it."
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent beer. I would like it to have more...well, just about everything. It is lightly carbonated, but it could use more body before they crank that up. As it is, it is OK. I am enjoying it and will absolutely finish my glass, but I doubt that I will religiously pick this one up like I do Hibernation Ale or Old Jubilation."
"Served on tap at the Tap House Grill in Oswego, IL. Poured a dark red/brown with an off-white head that persists. Another winter spice ale, this one a bit less spice-forward than most, letting some left coast hops contribute the citrus note, and the dominant spice out a fairly well muted bunch was the cloves, not the usual cinnamon. Not a brew to rave about, but I wouldn't pass it up a few pints if it was served at someone's holiday party, either. Out of the usual array of spiced beers, I'd give this one the nod over most."
"D - Well I couldn't seeing buying this again but as one of my ticks on my list I really was disappointed. Need more of a smoother malt profile to balance the grain and what crappy ales like this needs More SPICE! Average..."
"Medium body, soft carbonation which gives an almost creamy feel. The mouthfeel may be the best part of this beer. Some warming alcohol. Overall, not really that great. Malt character seems a bit cloying, with not enough spice to help balance."
"Drinkability - This is a pretty tasty ""Christmas"" beer. Not bad and worth a try. Not overly sweet as some can be. Pretty solid. Might have to watch out with the high ABV however."
"Picked up a single from Abe's Cold Beer. It poured brown with a short off-white head. There's a big initial hit of spice in the aroma, but that leveled off and left a roasted cocoa scent. Essentially, this beer has a fairly tasty, somewhat imperial brown ale at it's base with a touch of heavy roast mixed in. The Christmas spicing is subtle enough, with some nutmeg and cinnamon type notes in there (I'm not certain that's what it is)."
"Medium in body, nicely carbonated and not too thin."
"Overall not bad; I get a sort of brown ale/winter warmer cross, which is interesting and seems to work well together. The bad part is the watery nature of the mouthfeel. This brew has a real weird but enjoyable malty quality I wish I could convey and/or explain to you, but overall this is a good beer but probably more worthy of a draft selection than a whole 6-pack investment. Average at best..."
"Future outlook: Solid, enjoyable warmer that doesn't quite feel like it really is one. I remember this beer tasting more spiced in the past. Nevertheless, I'd be happy to give it another whirl next year."
"There are no bad flavors, overall this is a pretty straight up solid beer. Would like just a little more body and depth of malt flavor to fill this one out a bit."
"This beer was OK but I would not go out of my way to purchase again."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer. I would like to try another one of these. Delicious beer for those cold winter nights."
"drinkable - yes, probably finishing the liter."
"This beer is medium bodied and surprisingly smooth, my favorite among other seasonal 'christmas ale' s I have tried."
"D: Pretty easy drink and goes down smoothly. Good for a session, and has enough flavor to make it worth it. Enjoyable, if not one of the best winter brews."
"Needs flavor I think is the major problem."
"Drinkability: decent winter ale worth giving a try. If you want more of a malt focused beer for the holidays this will work."
"Overall, a drinkable Christmas beer, but nothing to get overly excited about."
"Alright at best-this one certainly doesn't wow me in any way. The hops come across a bit too assertive for the style and, while not unpleasant, just don't fit here."
"Two finger light brown head, gusher, medium dissipation with minimal lacing over deep brown body with garnet highlights, a wee bit of carbonation visible. Pretty dry nose, dark stone fruit esters, floral hops. Taste is prunes, raisins, molasses, plums and some bitter hops on back end, though note the taste isn't as deep or satisfying as 2010 Anchor Our Special Ale, which this beer reminds me of. Mouthfeel on the light side of medium, this isn't very full bodied, some effervescence but not a lot. OK drinkability, but the mouthfeel and taste make this a one-time shot."
"Conclusion: This beer is an alright winter warmer, but there are better choices with less alcohol (a bonus in my book). A dopplbock of this strength can be much maltier and richer... which begs this question, why isn't this beer maltier and richer?"
"D - Overall not bad; I get a sort of brown ale/winter warmer cross, which is interesting and seems to work well together. The bad part is the watery nature of the feel, and the 7.5 ABV is nice for it's warming property, but not so nice for wanting to drink a few."
"As far as winter warmers go though, it's one of the better one's I've found. It has a nice weight to it as well."
"Breckenridge has pretty good selection in beers. I saw this Christmas Ale that just got into my beer store. There's nothing really Christmasy about. It's average at best as a beer but still relatively drinkable. It has a harsh taste to it and a little bitter flavor."
"D: Not very high, probably my least favorite winter warmer."
"At 7.4% ABV, I would have expected a slightly boozier brew, but this is rather refreshing. It has a fruit cake quality to it, but it's not heavy like a fruit cake. Perhaps not the best example of the style, but worth trying for fans of the genre."
"Carbonation takes up a big chunk of the flavor. Slight diacetyl touch, not enough to really draw me into this British world, but enough to sort of nag. Light-medium mouthfeel with wild bubbles that leave naught but some spices on the palate in the finish. This isn't a recipe that needs scrapping, but some revamp will have to take place before I get another."
"The foam was light wheat in color, bubbley and lacey. The color was a nice amber orange. It had a sharp hops and citrus aroma with hints of flowers and some spice notes. It had a taste of sharp hops and spices with cinnamon, licorice and orange notes. Mouthfeel - a full medium body. Drinkability - due to the hops and spice flavors and aromas, it was a nice crisp beer for the holiday season."
"Pours a redish brown with a thin head. Not much retention and just a bit of laceing. Aroma is of sugary spices,and sweet malts. Body is on the thin side with some carbonation. Taste is of dark ripe fruits and spice. Not the best example of this style, but worth a try."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with half-finger head, decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet and spicy; Caramel malt and pine. Starts with caramel, piney hoppiness at the back. Slight lemony tang on the edges. Medium-light mouthfeel and decent drinkability."
"The beer poured a dark nut brown color with a centimeter of foam with decent lacing and retention. Caramel malt and spices form a round aroma, but nothing with much depth here. Hollow malt sweetness and grain form the main flavor with the spice contributing toward the end. The mouthfeel is thinner than I would like. I would like to see a little more flavor in my holiday ale."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a clear orange-amber color with a fair, quickly diminishing fizzy light brown head. Aroma is caramel malts, allspice, brown sugar, citrus, and cinnamon. Flavor is sweet caramel malt, a slight hint of roast, and some spiciness to balance. Mouthfeel is medium, lightly carbonated, and a touch of bitterness. Drinkable beer but sort of plain-jane for a holiday ale."
"Not the best example of a winter warmer, but not a bad beer."
"Pours a clear, copperish color. A soapy off-white head soon recedes to a ring. Smell is a blend of Christmas cookie spices, mainly nutmeg. Taste is pretty subdued, a slightly toasted malt base, some ginger notes on top, and a bitter finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, and drinkability is average. The ABV is suitable for a warmer - it actually *does* that, unlike so many others.."
"The only good thing about this beer (i suppose, if you wan to get drunk) would be the alcohol content at 7.4. Besides that yuck! Alcohol is warming to the belly. Feel is slick and slightly tingly from the moderate amount of carbonation."
"A very drinkable beer which does not abuse spicing or alcohol. An excellent winter beer."
"A little thinner body, higher carbonation, some dryness as well. Drinks okay, but the alcohol wasn't masked well, and the flavors had some metallic notes at times. Not really something I'd seek out again."
"D-- It's OK. Not my favorite as opposed to what you can get in CO with GD, Odell, Avery, and NB offerings. ABV is decently hidden but just a bit too syrupy and too much toffee taste. One is enough."
"Cannot decide a style for this beer. In a way it is like a dubbel, but a bit of hoppiness on the way down, make it almost like an esb. Interesting beer, a bit yeasty, pours a very nice brownish-red colour. Very appealing. Has a nice head with lacing. BTW...drank this barely above room temperature. Kinda slightly creamy, with a bunch of particles floating in beer and quite simple and easy to drink. I like this one."
"Overall impression: not much complexity. average Christmas ale. Not a favorite."
"Drinkability - Pretty decent brew, but not terribly complex. On the other hand, there's enough complexity to make it worth thinking about while you taste."
"Overall: I got this because I have heard good things about the brewery and my general affinity for Christmas/Winter beers and Colorado. Unfortunately, this beer looked the part, but was disappointing. Skip this and go for the Samuel Smiths Winter Welcome. Cheers!!"
"A modest offering for the holiday season. I enjoyed it's simplicity and quaffability."
"Very smooth finish, slight citrus aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"I cannot help but look over some of the reviews for this beer and wonder if we are drinking the same beer. This was poured at slighly cooler then cellar temperature which is how I like all of my warmers. I'm sure my rDev on this will be through the roof, but this beer does not deserve the low overall rating that it has. If you like warmers that have some nice subdued spicing you can't go wrong with this."
"D: Easily drinkable. Numerous ""christmas ales," or ""winter warmers," a full of clove and cinnamon spice which can be overpowering. THis is a nicely balanced beer that is incrediblely drinkable. NIce offering from Breckenridge."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a fading fast one fingered tan head with a fair amount of lacing the entire glass. Aromas of cinnamon toffee, brown sugar and malts. On the palate a sweet copious amount of spice. Medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Desent enough brew that is worthy of more than one tasting."
"Overall - This beer overall was ok, not something I would drink on the regular, definitely good with a meal."
"Drinkability: A very good beer. I like how it was not excessively hoppy or spicy, but offered just enough bitterness and kick to keep it respectable. It is an excellent alternative to the ""hop bombs"" released for the winter holiday season."
"Deep brown with an amber hue in color. Pours with a short off-white head that reduces to a thin cap. A few sticky lacings on the glass. Sweet malty and toasted malt aromas are dominant with hints of dark fruit, raisins and nuts. Medium bodied with nice carbonation through the middle. Sweet and toasted malts in the beginning that slowly give way to nutty flavors and a mild bitter finish. Very easy to drink. The higher ABV slowly moves in as you drink this one."
"2008 vintage in swingtop bottle, poured a dark brown with very little head into the trusty old pint shaker glass. Aroma was sweet malt with a hint of spices. Taste was malty goodness with some spices, finish was very odd: kind of sour or spices gone bad? Normally this is one of my favorite Christmas brews; I don't believe I'll age one this long again. Decent but definitely off."
"Overall - Good beer, a bit sweet for me unless it's paired with food. I'd like more cloves/cinnamon in a winter warmer other than that I enjoyed it."
"This brew is pretty good. The drink is pretty easy, and I enjoyed it. It would be a bit hard to take in more then one of these. The brew is great, but the complexity of the flavors might just be to much. Still a great Christmas Ale."
"Gets better as you get closer to the end of the 6pack though...as expected :)"
"Overall: For a Christmas Ale this beer is mild by most measures, as most brewers tend to push the cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg levels to unimagined heights, as if Christmas could be made more Christmassy through the boiling and tincturing of its traditional aromatics. Not so with Breckenridge. It's definitely a Christmas Ale, my first comment after my initial sip was that it was an out-of-season experience. However, once you settle into the pint, the mild spiciness that is so evident at first, quiets and leaves behind a perfectly quaffable ale. It isn't sickly sweet, although it is sweet. The medium body and carbonation present a drinking experience that isn't as syrupy as the beer actually is.If my experience doesn't match other reviewers, blame the six months in the back of a liquor store."
"I won't say it's a bad beer, because really it's not; it just wasn't anything worth trying again."
"I'm tempted to call this beer boring, but sometimes that's what you might be looking for?"
"A dark amber to red color pour with a foamy light tan head , lasting a short time , leaving little to no lacing , medium carbonation. Aroma of cinnamon , cola , nuts and maybe fruit . Flavor is sweet with the promised caramel and chocolate flavors , maybe some cherries , cinnamon and other spice notes , full body , creamy , slightly dry mouthfeel , slight warming effect , a little alcohol and dusty grain in the finish , nothing to put me off but not really my thing , Drinkable and worth a try , but not what what im looking for."
"This is a pretty boring xmas ale."
"D: Goes down easy but I wouldn't want to drink too many of these it did not sit to well for some reason."
"Pours a chestnut brown, clear without suspension. There's yeast in there though I can smell 'em, along with roasted coffee beans and a metallic quality also. Aluminum foil? Taste is not of aluminum but of black coffee, unsweetened chocolate and some caramel sweetness. There's also a peppery hop presence, but overall this one is bitter much like a porter. Wait is this a porter? Mouthfeel is on the watery side, so I'm guessing the body is thinned out with some adjuncts. Not a bad thing necessarily, and I can't taste them anyway unless they burned them first. I mean roasted them, yes it has a strong roasted malt character through and through. Finish is bitter, dry and bitter. I won't seek this one out in the future, but I will purchase said beer again on the $1.99 discount rack if the situation arises. It is warming me this winter with 7.4% abv after all."
"A pretty good sipper on a cold night. Alcohol isn't noticeable, tho' it is a bit thin on the mouthfeel. Not a bad Winter Warmer."
"D: Very flavorful and balanced."
"Again in the quaff, lite hints of chocolate, cinnamon and malt - more along the lines of a holiday brown ale than winter warmer. Ya know, a fairly tasty brew but not in the ballpark of a spicy winter brew."
"D: This is an average winter warmer...it is unique....but one that I probably wouldn't have again."
"D- Easy drinking, a great social beer, very easy to session."
"D- I do like to drink this beer every now and then. I will most likely pick up a 6-pack or two every winter."
"Nice body to this winter warmer, as expected. Lightly carbonated and more than sippable. Could see this one creeping up on an unsuspecting imbiber. Well done."
"Decent easy drinking brew."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, bitey, gently spiced, and drinkable like a spiced wafer."
"Pours a translucent dark mahogany with a fine-bubbled beige head. Aroma is spicy - mainly cinnamon - and somewhat malty. Mouth-filling flavor is spicy, mostly cinnamon and cloves, with a fruity undertone and a hint of spicy hard candy. Texture is rough, lively and tingly."
"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. Deep ruby with a light tan creamy head that leaves cascades of lacing. Rich sweet fruit notes with grapefruit and piney hops. Raisin and citrus hops all the way through. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Finish with a touch of bitter pine."
"D: Overall, this is a nice winter offering. Good complexity and nice warmth make this a fitting winter brew."
"Poured this into a pint glass, left 1/2"" of off-white head that reduced to a film leaving good lacing. Smells malty, maybe a little peach(?). Color is a dark amber. Taste is smooth with a bitter finish, some spices suitable for a Christmas ale. Body is thin to medium. Mild carbonation. I wouldn't drink a six-pack of this in one go, but it's certainly not bad."
"Deep reddish-amber topped by a loose off-white head. Aroma has a slight hint of cherry and honey - not much else. Flavor is also dominated by honey notes followed by a mixture of burnt sugar and alcohol. Not really all that complex. Mouthfeel is smooth but a bit watery. Carbonation is great. Drinkability is OK, but it's really a rather boring beer."
"Poured into pint glass amber with a thck frothy head. Great lacing all the way down. The scent has a hop presence. The taste has the hops up front that are found in the nose, but it really doesn't have much of a sweet aftertaste like a winter warmer should. This is more like an AIPA than a WW. That being said, it masks the high alcohol well, which really doesn't match the style either."
"I'm not normally into winter / holiday / spiced beers but I'm working on it this year. I enjoyed this one quite a bit."
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a crisp dark copper with a thin diminishing off-white head. Aroma is caramel malts, mild spice and slight hops. The taste is a nice blend of burnt caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg and slight pine hops providing a nice backbone. The beer is medium bodied with its 7.4% well hidden. This is a very enjoyable Winter Warmer, one I would love to have again."
"Clear golden body with an off white foamy cap. Subtle spice in the aroma with a mild hop character and graininess. The taste reminds me of Saint Arnold christmas ale, light body, every bit if booze evident, a corn syrup flavor and some vanilla, caramel spice to build up the finish which offers a piney profile. Mouthfeel is medium heavy, borderline syrupy and under carbonated. Decent but not too impressed."
"The smell of the brew offers a sweet maltiness with a hint of the alcohol coming out. The color of the head is off-white and the lacing is thin and dissipates. The beer itself is a solid amber, kinda close to Yuengling Traditional Lager. At 7.4% ABV, it's definitely a beer worth trying at least once. If I ever find myself in Colorado and am near the Breckenridge Brewpub, I'll be heading in for a few brews and some BBQ ribs. Merry Christmas, and here's to Breckenridge Brewery: Cheers, and drink well!"
"Drinkability- Pretty decent drinkability. At 7.4 % abv, some people might tucker out after a few. To me that tends to be a good thing. Certainly good flavor for something that high abv."
"D: Pretty darn drinkable in my opinion. And exhibits less of (or at least to a lesser degree) the sometimes overbearing characteristics of a Christmas Ale (a plus if you are easily overwhelmed by overly sweet and spicy brews this time of year)."
"D A little bit boring for me to consider this particularly drinkable. 3.0"
"I was not too impressed with this one although the bottle design is very festive. It pours a ruby brown color. The smell is very faint and not much going on in that department. The taste is unimpressive in the sense if I was blindfolded I might think I'm drinking a Bud. Uh-oh! At 7.4 the alcohol is well hidden. Overall I would pass on this one. There are too many limited Xmas beers to try over this one."
"Great beer for the holiday season. Would drink again."
"I enjoyed this beer very much. I will look for it in the future."
"As far as the style goes its probably not the best representation, but as far as drinkability goes it is what it is, and that is average."
"Drinks pretty easily, one I'm sure I'll have again. A solid offering but a pretty standard one at that."
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with light carbonation, and a bit watery."
"drinkability - i forgot what i paid for a single but i wish i had a bought the six pack"
"Mouthfeel is a solid medium body, with some zest oils creating a dense body. Very nice warmer"
"Quite drinkable."
"warming, decent body and mildy creamy."
"Drinkability: Meh. You can drink it, but I certainly won't be seeking this one out. It seems another reviewer nailed it when writing: ""played it safe"" as there's really nothing that jumps out of this one. It seems that if you're only going to release something like this on a limited run each year, make it more worthwhile. Just my $.02."
"Notes: delicious, light, crisp, sweet beer. i was surprised to see it defined as a winter warmer. fits the traditional bock mold in my opinion"
"Overall, a nice ,drinkable holiday beer to have on hand"
"Pours with minimal head even with a pretty vigorous pour, color is a tawny caramel brown with amber highlights when held toward the light. Head is a light cream hue and forms speckled lacing scattered around my chalice. Aromatics are muted a bit but there is some faint citrus qualities with caramel malts and a touch of spices. Flavor is very light on the spice additions and hop bitterness a touch of that citrus and pine in the finish. Caramel malt drives the flavor with a nice winter warmer, nothing over the top this beer plays it pretty safe. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied carbonation is easygoing nothing big to report here. Move along to some more interesting christmas ales this one was priced right and not bad this may be my value beer this season."
"Taste: Really balanced between spice and sweetness. Nice hop bitterness in the finish. Easily approachable seasonal for beer beginners."
"Drinkability- Although there's not a lot of spice or wintery flavor, the subtlety of this beers flavor, (and well masked alcohol) make for a pretty decent drinker, especially compared to some of the more overspiced winter warmers out there. [reminds me of the fact that Breckenridge's Avalanche was another good session beer]"
"drinkability: its good and has a nicely masked abv but there is nothing really special or amazing about this beer."
"The alcohol shows up a ton on this and the malt is too burnt for my liking. I guess it doesn't help I'm drinking a ""winter warmer"" in the middle of summer. I'd imagine this one is better in colder weather."
"Pours a nice brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, spicy, with some caramel. The taste is malty, spicy, slightly bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty WW, recommend."
"Picked up at Warehouse Beverage, Cleveland. Pours dark colour, virtually no head. Aroma is a touch of roast, and that's it. Taste is spot-on coca-cola,with spices added such as ginger and allspice. OK, but not so drinkable tonight after so many good spicey meals.Above average carbonation, and mouthfeel."
"D: Drinkable, I wanted to clear this out of the fridge as it won't be cold in North Texas until October probably and I was not disappointed."
"The drinkability is low not because of the abv but because this beer just doesn't come together, the flavors act like they are arguing."
"Drinkability - Its not very harsh so easily sippable, but its not really a winter warmer in my book. After a few sips, the flavor starts to grate on your taste buds. I'll pass next year, and I'm starting to get this general impression of most of Breck's brews."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability: A rich and fairly heavy seasonal, and certainly one that's not recommended for a session. But it's a fairly flavorful malt bomb, one certainly right for Christmas, and though I enjoyed it, I'm glad I only got one bottle and didn't buy more than this."
"A nice winter warmer."
"poured nice dark brown with a bit of mahogany of the sides, nice 2 finger head. Not too much smell to it, some hops in there. Much more flavor than smell. Decent brew mainly taste roasted malt, a little sweet, and the had has a pleasant bitter hop finish, but definitley not too bitter or i wouldn't like it. I would get this again for sure, BUT there are too many other great winter brews that outshine this....but no doubt worthy."
"Pours caramel with a thin, quickly dissapating head. sweet molasses in the nose. Good thickness in the mouth as the beer hits your tongue, but not much flavor in the finish. Vaguely sweet and a little chewy, virtually no bitterness. Probably would not get this one again."
"No bitter hop finish, but you can taste and feel the alcohol long after you've swallowed."
"While this isn't a bad beer, it's nothing exceptional, and I can't see myself seeking this out to enjoy more than just this one."
"Roasty dark malt, bittersweet chocolate and caramel malt. Just a hint of dark fruit and a light peppery bitterness. Rich but drinkable, very smooth for a beer approaching 8% ABV. Full mouth and a sweet and roasty finish. Lovely stuff."
"D-Very easy to drink. I could easily polish off a few of these without a problem. That said, it's drinkability does not make this a bland, boring beer. It has deep flavors on top of flavors, making it enjoyable to drink, as well as smooth."
"Pours a dark transparent reddish amber with a light tan cap that retains adequately and leaves lots of Swiss-cheese lacing. The nose is malty with hints of caramel and a bit of cinnamon and other spice,maybe a hint of brown sugar as well. This tastes like a big fat cinnamon roll. Just the right touch of sweetness and spice,with a smooth alcohol finish. The mouthfeel is a little thin,but the carbonation is a little creamy and gives it a fuller finish than the start. A nice WW, just right for a cold Christmas Eve morning like this."
"Overall good semi-complex flavor, and a good nose. A little different for this particular style, but a pretty decent overall quaff."
"Notes from: 12/23/05"
"D- Don't think most people would want to have more than a couple of these in a sitting."
"Cheers"
"Quite drinkable, and ok overall."
"This seemed more like a funky malty wine than a beer."
"Wow, I didn't realize that this was 7.4% until I just now looked. This is extremely drinkable for a winter warmer. The subtle spiciness is nice as well, some beers of this style go overboard in that department."
"After reading the other reviews the smell is actually a good thing. Learning is fun!"
"Pours a light brown with a small head that lasts a little while. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass surface. The smell is sweet malt with a touch of spice like cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavor is just average. Sweet malt with a little spice and alcohol on finish. Mild overall. The body is a bit thin but does have a nice semi-creamy texture. Carbonation is kept in check. A nice beer but will not impress many Beer Advocates. The high ABV limits drinkability."
"Overall not bad but I've had better."
"Overall I'm disappointed once again by this brewery. They sucked me in with the 471 Small Batch and it's been downhill from there. This isn't a terrible beer by any stretch, but there are plenty of other better ones of the style out there."
"Poured a dark clear copper color with a very light off white head. Left minimal cover with almost no lacing. It did smell like a christmas ale with a presence of cinammon and nutmeg. The flavors were not as pronounced while drinking and the carbonation was a little underwhelming. This is the first beer I've had from the Breckenridge Brewery and I was expecting a little more."
"A fairly average winter warmer."
"(On tap at Sonka's Irish Pub, Terre Haute, IN)"
"Would be nice as a session brew. Flavor is interesting with a malty, but not overpowering character. Certainly worth a try."
"Not all bad, but not one I'll go out of my way to purchase next holiday season. Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome Ale and Samuel Adams Winter Lager this assuredly isn't."
"Another reviewer mentioned that it was too hoppy...I must disagree. While this style shouldn't be hoppy...i felt it didn't have enough. However, I may be a bit biased, as I really prefer the hops."
"D- maybe i'm trippin, but this could be served in a wine glass. extreme wine characteristics, maybe more so than any beer i've had, but it is fitting and i like it. not a monster ABV but this one commands sipping in my opinion. it's unique and interesting and i could go for a couple more."
"This is just another mediocre and bland Winter Warmer that has to many hops for the style IMO."
"I don't have much experience with holiday beers, but if this one is an example, I will be anxious to try more. A nice beer to enjoy on a cold winter day."
"Overall, I like. Yet, there are many many many other winter warmers that toast my buns better than this one."
"12oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a clear brown with a finger of off white head. Aroma of caramel malt with some piney hops. Medium bodied on the malty side. Some chocolate malt. A pretty good amount of hop bitterness. Not very memorable, but fairly drinkable."
"""Comforting warmer to mellow you out. Roasty aroma some coffee and caramel and a good helping of hops, wish it were stronger. Dark brown pour with a thin head but ample lacing. Medium mouthfeel but it's rich and filling with a real easy finish for such a sturdy beer. Flavor is an excellent bundle of roasted toasted malts, mild hops, some minimal spices, and a touch of coffee and rich brown sugar. This is like the Christmas rum cake of beer."
"Not what I was expecting, more of a hoppy spiced brown ale. The spices are very subtle but overall it's a well balanced beer. I can see being able to drink a lot of these, it's definitely light enough to pack these away if given the opportunity. I'm not sure the taste is my thing, but it's definitely drinkable."
"I like many of Breck's seasonal offerings, but this one didn't do it for me. Many beers lack hops. This one probably just needed a different variety...maybe goldings?"
"D- A pretty solid beer has some interesting IPA sub tones."
" ~ The good news is that I picked up a six pack, so I have a few more at home. I've been happy with the other brews I've sampled from this Colorado Brewery and this is no exception."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a deep dirty brown color with a slight off white head that faded quickly. The smell of this brew is of some light malts, sweetness with cinnamon and some mild clove. The taste is modest. There is some light roasted malt taste, some faint stailness to it (might be left from a 2007 batch). The finish was a little more alcohol than I would want. Ok brew, but nothing special."
"A pretty good winter warmer is what we have here."
"A pretty good beer. I was personally expecting something a little better from a great brewery like Breckenridge. It has a nice smooth feel, with a nutty after taste with a little bit of bite at the end. A good pairing with a cold colorado night. Go for it~!"
"Piurs to a deep warm dark brown hosting just an inch of solid tan head that just doesnt stay around as long as youd like it to, gone in minutes. Nose is faint with ashey spices and soft soured fruit, and a hint of sweet maltiness. First thing you notice as you take first sip is a distinct hoppy feel wraped in a bit of crisp almost soured fruit. The malt feel is long and mineral based yeilding to a quite creamy smooth bit of sweetness. Mouthfeel is a little dry with a burnt bitterness creating a thickness on the back of the tongue. Very easy to drink, could be a bit more bold though."
"The alcohol is not detectable, decent beer, but not much of a good drinker, much better Xmas beers out there. This needs more of everything."
"D: This is an ok beer, but not a shining example of a winter warmer. The spices are there, the malt is there, the hops are barely noticeable, but somehow, it never really came together to make a great beer."
"Taste is better. Not great, but pleasant. Plenty of toffee sweetness, mild bitterness, milder spiciness. Nothing to detract from drinkability, but not quite the big-flavored cold weather strong sipper I'd like from this incarnation of the style. Pretty dry finish with a light sweetness lingering on my palate. Body is on the light side, which doesn't help some aspects, but seems to help drinkability a bit here. Sure, I'll have another, but it falls short of a seasonal must-have."
"Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz. bottle. the beer poured a dark copper, forming a very thin tan head that dissipated quickly. Very small light spots of lace on the glass. The aroma is very malty, with lights hints of spices. The taste is malty caramel with an equal emphasis on the spices and hops. The taste is highly dominated by the malts, but the hops come out a little more in the finish. medium mouthfeel, with a smooth finish. Good flavor and medium alcohol content make for a drinkable winter warmer. Overall, this winter warmer was okay, but not something that I would keep on hand through the winter months."
"Not a bad beer. A very solid offering from breckenridge that I would session any time. Nothing over the top, a very sessionable beer indeed."
"Pours a very dark brown that is clear and has a nice creme head. Nose is bland. Very little caramel there. Flavor is a bit tart. The zing is a wee bit much really. There are some nice brown ale-esqe characters here. Decent earthy edge. Nice leafy tone. But the citrusy zingy character is just singing a bit too high. Feel is decent with a thicker liquid body and a slightly lower carbonation. Overall this is an okay winter warmer. A bit off balance and thick in the wrong places, but it is still fairly drinkable."
"Cheers"
"D: Decent brew and drinkable for 7.4%. There are better winter warmers out there, though."
"Decent looking dark ruby/brown color with dark head. Smells a bit hoppy with some sweet prune-like odor and maybe some spice. I'm not crazy about the flavor. It's bitter with some lingering unpleasant aftertaste... Like the bitterness of an orange peel. Good body and texture but not very drinkable. Pretty mediocre in my opinion."
"Poured from bottle, local shop had these on clearance and well within the ""best buy"" date so I thought why not? I should have thought not. Poured into pint glass and pours deep, dark red, very dark looking with thin head with poor retention and some lacing. Smell is weak, the only really detectable thing I can find is yeast and bread. It almost smells Belgian-ish. Taste is of some malt, some caramel but with a somewhat sharp alcohol bite towards the end. Moutfeel was very light and watery, it just seemed off. Overall this beer was just very bland in all aspects (smell, taste, moutfeel, ect). It wasnt terrible but I will not revisit this and by far the worst Winter Warmer I've yet to sample."
"Not a bad tasting brew, but nothing terribly exciting or special. I wouldn't seek this out again, but I wouldn't' be displeased to drink it either."
"Beer poured a mahogany brown with a smallish off white head. Nose is of malts and baked holiday sweets. Taste is of malts that have been lightly toasted, and is somewhat bready. Hops come into play late and ever so slightly. Mouthfeel is lighter than average for the style and lightly carbonated. Overall drinkability is good. This brew just has something about it that is hard to explain but is very tasty!"
"Overall, an average Christmas beer. The right flavors, but not enough kick."
"Overall- Just an average Christmas offering. Nothing to seek out, but glad to try it. Will not look for it next year, but if I happen to come across some, I will definitely give it another shot."
"D: Tried this one on a whim (damn, that pretty label beckoned me!) so I'm not too disappointed. This beer has its positive qualities, but had a fairly forgettable taste. This bottle says this is about three months old, so age isn't a factor. Maybe I'd get this again...better on draught, perhaps?"
"Finish is sweet, brown bread and some biscuits."
"Pours a reddish brown with a thin head that settles to a thin ring. Smells slightly malty and spicy but with a little sour graininess as well. Taste is similar, including the sour graininess. Quite light in overall flavor, slightly sweet and a slightly nutty finish. Smooth mouthfeel. I drank a sixpack of this and a week later someone brought me another. I was pretty bored with this before I finished the first sixpack, let alone the second.Eh."
"Overall- It was a pretty decent beer. It isn't the best winter warmer out there, but it certainly isn't the worst."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Carbonation is okay. ABV is pretty good for this beer. Not very noticable. Drinkability is okay. Overall, pretty good offering. Definitely worth a try."
"D & Notes: Overall this is at best a half-way decent drinkable beer, but not worth bothering with if you are looking for a truly good ""winter warmer"". This brew is nothing more than a thin malt body with some holiday spices. The body is much too thin, the maltiness is weak, the finish is very weak, and this overall, in my opinion, a not so great winter brew."
"Drinkability is decent although its just not a very interesting beer, its kind of odd and doesn't really call for more than one. I'll stick to the IPAs."
"Pours a deep brown with a tan head. In the aroma, a sweet Christmas spice, but mainly cinnamon. In the taste, just like the smell, a sweet Christmas spice but mainly cinnamon. A smooth and spicy mouthfeel, and a dry cinnamon aftertaste. Mainly sweet cinnamon, hides the alcohol and easy to drink."
"D - Very drinkable. I could easily do three or four of these."
"D - This is an okay winter warmer. There are better out there but this is certainly worth a try at any holiday gathering."
"D - It's a little sweet but it's good. Kick back and enjoy 1 or 2."
"The bottom line: A distinctive take on the Winter Warmer style by the folks at Breckenridge. Not amongst my favourites in the style, but worth giving a try if you run into it."
"This is a fine beer but there is not much of that ""seasonal"" flavor to it. It drinks well and I enjoyed it, just not as much as I thought I would."
"Moderately high carbonation with a medium body. The finish is slightly dry as well. A decent amount of warmth in the finish. A nice festive selection but not as flavorful as I would have liked."
"This ones okay; nothing to write about, really."
"D: Not too shabby. Easy to drink but not especially challenging..."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: In the mouth this brew has a medium body, with carbonation that almost cleanses the palate while/after the brew is swallowed. Finish is on the drier side. Slight warming sensation in the stomach, after the brew has been swallowed. This isn't a hard brew to drink, though I much prefer GLBC Christmas Ale over this one as well Cristian Moerlein Christkindl as well."
"D- Not exactly what I was expecting out of a Christmas ale. I don't really see myself getting this again."
"There is nothing wrong with this beer really, but nothing too impressive either."
"I wouldnt really recommend this beer, although it does taste a bit like the holidays. I bought this bottle at 3 Cellars Liquor in Franklin, WI."
"D: thought I had establised a list of staple holiday brews but like the bcs one underdogs victory throws the whole ranking system into chaos...loved the brew would definately buy agian"
"I was mixing up a sixer and figured why not give this a chance? Nice, dark, malty beer with a noticeable alcohol kick. This was actually at the bottom of my winter warmer list. This beer was just average. I will still give Breckenridge the benefit of the doubt in the future."
"Pours a medium brown color with a reddish tint. Head is a creamy and thick 2"" light brown head. Smell is a doughy, sweet malty scent with some spices, cinnamon, gingerbread. Taste is mostly on the spice, with a little bit watered down. Decent beer for a winter warmer!"
"A nice, well hopped, spicy winter warmer. I probably wouldn't want too many at one time, but a couple certainly hit the spot."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a Chimay Chalice. Poured a mahogany and when the light hit it, it showed a lot of ruby colors. Very little head and carbonation. Smells of hops and malty sweetness. Also spices, and citrus, Im guessing from the hops. Taste is more simple then the smell. Its mostly sweet with a little roasted malts and hops coming out in the end of this beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with little carbonation. Drinkability is good. I dont know if I could drink a sixer in a night but I could definitely go for another."
"The bottle label was different that what is shown on the picture here, and I found it better looking. The beer itself looked mahogany in color, clear, and topped with a one finger head. The smell made do a double take, because the strong hop presence was not expected at all. The citric smell was backed with some toffee and chocolate. The taste was quite outstanding due to the amount of things going on. The hops were noticeably bright and floral, while the malt was toasty and sweet. There was a rich smoky backbone, and a lingering buttery aftertaste. Even with all of this flavor density, this was not a big beer, but an easily approached one. A little tinny in texture perhaps, but not much given up there either. Fantastic pick from Windward Beverage Mart in Alpharetta at the recommendation of Paz."
"First time to have this one. Appears a dark red/brown in a standard pint glass. Absolutely no head at all with no visible carbonation in the glass unless provocated. Nose was pleasing, piney hops balanced with rich malts. Taste is similar with some roastedness/nuttiness tucked away in there. Rather light mouthfeel to it. I can't really decide where it wants to go or what it wants me to think, confusing. Aftertaste is short lived and lacking. Not the best winter warmer but worth a try."
"I'm kind of disappointed by this one. I love Christmas beers, but I'm really not that impressed by this one."
"This ale pours a very clear, deep ruby red into my mug with a thin white head. The head diminished to a thin skim that lasted through the beer. The aroma is dominated by moderate-low roasted character, a moderate malty sweetness-caramel like with a bit of spicyness. There is also a low flora hop aroma. A nice nose to this beer. The taste initially malty, moderate caramel, slightly nutty, a little toasted, and moderately sweet. Toward the swallow a moderate hop flavor emerges, very nice. The bitterness is medium-low, but that combined with medium-low roasty flavor, there is enough to provide a nice balance. The carbonation is moderate and body/mouthfeel is medium with a good drinkability. Overall this is a well done Christmas style ale. A nice looking beer, the nose and flavor are both solid, with some complexity, and the subtle, but noticeable hop flavor is well done. Drinkability is very good too, especially at the 7.4 ABV, it could sneak up on me. I recommend this beer."
"Drinkability: Good. This is one of my Colorado native favorites in the winter warmer category. But at 7.4% ABV you find yourself drinking less than you planned."
"The taste has a good chocolate flavour up front with some nice sweetness from the caramel and a light dark chocolate like bitterness that comes through in the finish. It also has some roasted malt notes but I can't say I tasty any of the dark fruit or fig that I mentioned in my earlier review. Victims of aging? Oh well, it's pretty nice and pretty easy to drink. Alcohol is well hidden and the head retention is good with some nice ring after ring of lacing. My overall score for would this sample wouldn't be much different from what I've laready rated it."
"Bold mouthfeel, very drinkable. A strong winter warmer, though, so be careful if downing more than one. A nicely rounded beer."
"A tasty and very well mannered winter warmer of a beer here. It shines by having no rough edges and a willing to please demeanor. A recommendable beer."
"Well done- a nice American winter warmer."
"Pours a clear dark copper with a creamy khaki head. Aroma consists of sweet caramel malt with hints of citrus and piney hops. There's a hint of brown sugar also. Smooth medium-bodied mouthfeel. Flavors of caramel and chocolate malt are apparent upfront. Piney hop bitterness arrives midway and carries into the finish. Obviously, the 7.4% abv supports why it's listed as an American Style Strong Ale on Breckenridge's website, but the taste reminds me of a hearty amber in my opinion. I think some of that can be contributed to the addition of the black patent malt that's utilized also. It definitely adds a nice depth of flavor to the finish. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. A very nice Christmas Ale that's produced without the use of traditional holiday spices."
"Pours out a rich, dark red with very little off-white head. Smells of roasted malts, spices, and bread. It tastes mostly of the same stuff, without any real serious character or flavor. Very little aftertaste, and not much of a hint of hops or bitterness. Nothing was offensive, but nothing was great, either. A little watery with below average carbonation, but easy to consume. The bottle will look good with my other Christmas season brews."
"Slainte!"
"D: I could drink a lot of these."
"Didn't drink so well. Whatever it was I liked about lasy years, ain't here, either my tastes changed or the recipe did, not reccomended, but had potential"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with brewed one date area on label that wasn't notched into a pint glass. Was a brown/mahagony color with just a very small brownish head. The smell was bready malts well balanced with a spicy hop. The taste was pretty good for a winter warm but since not one of my favorite styles this is about as good as it can get rated. Overall one of the better examples of the style that I've had so far. Recommend trying especially if you enjoy Warmers. (3, RB, T,O)"
"They were right. It's a very tasty beer. It has a pleasant aroma, a great taste with a hint of cherry, i think. Very nice beer. I could drink this stuff past Christmas."
"Overall, not a bad winter warmer. Worth a try."
"Medium bodied, drinkable but not really a session beer. A decent warmer after doing some fall or winter chores. Worth a try."
"Pours a deep shade of ruby-amber, with excellent clarity and orange highlights. Thin, one-finger off-white head shows passing retention and light spotty lacing. Clover honey and molasses nose, with some background dark crystal malt, english hop aromas and faint ginger/cinnamon notes. Roasted and caramel flavors upfront, followed by a touch of honey and a rich blackstrap taste. Aftertaste is dry and full of fuggle hop flavor with a solid piney hop bitterness. More hoppy than the aroma suggests, but retains a good balance. Sweet, medium to full body deposits plenty of residual sugar, but the fine carbonation and abundant hop charcter keeps the mouthfeel more dry and airy than cloying. Hint of ginger/cinnamon near the end, and finishes with a mild slickness that fades quickly due to assertive hops and drying spices. Reminicent of Anchor's OSA, this drinks easy and makes a terrific holiday treat."
"A good Warmer. Big on malts, bold on hops, and spiced just right. Too often, the Winter Warmers try to over-do the spices, making it harsh or astringent. This beer starts with a strong malt base that takes on caramel, toffee, bready, toasty flavors and a nearly-syrup body. Hopped for nice balance, while contributing a bit of citrus, earty, and pine flavors. Spices decorate the nose and flavors really subtally, but never contribute harshness in the feel. Seems well aged and matured, with only a hint of hotter alcohols or abrasion. Still has nice head retention and lacing with the last sip. Not one of Breckenridge's finest brews."
"Pours brown with red highlight and a off white creamy head. Smells like malts (maybe some roasted malts) and a little bit of fruitiness. I'm tasting cloves, less malt then I expected and a little hop bitterness. There is some alcohol burn as well. I was expecting the spice flavors to be more prominant as well. The mouthfeel is thinner than I would expect for a winter warmer. This isn't bad, and is probably worth trying, but I am a little disappointed with this one. You'd be better off picking up Breckenridge's Oatmeal Stout."
"Overall, an intruguing yet alluring color, and a very pleasantly balanced albeit subtle taste."
"Poured into a pint glass a light brown color with a small head forming, then quickly fading away. The aroma of malty sweetness, folowed by a tough of spices and some floral hops. The taste starts with the strong malt flavor, then a combination of spices hit the palate, and then a hop flavor shows itself at the end. A watery feel in the mouth is there at the start. Then it gains weight to become more medium bodied towards the end. Fairly drinkable for a cold weather beer. It is faily refreshing, though spices could be a bit of a turn off."
"Served with a reddish brown color and a dense white head. Nice lacing and head retention throughout the session. Caramel, chocolate, rich malts and some off-scents in the aroma. Pretty poor flavor. Some off flavors on-tap compared to the bottled version. Nonetheless, there is some chocolate and caramel on the palate. Pretty full bodied with a nice bitter finish. But the off flavors were too much to bare."
"Mouthfeel is ok, but very watery."
"2005 large flip-top bottle of limited release (mine is #807). Pours a two finger tan/light brown head over a crystal clear brown-amber liquid. Nice frithy head...this is a sharp looking beer. Smells citrusy lemon hops and grassy co-ho. Hint of ginger, caramle, and chocolate. Dry grass. Tastes caramel, chocolate, toasted malts, and some alcohol burn. Flat grassy hop co-ho. Dry beer altogether. Smooth toffee and vanilla. Tettnanger hops, perhaps, as they come across in a dry woody and somewhat dirty manner. Md body and medium carbonation. This was yummy. A touch dry, but really quite drinkable."
"Appearence is good! Dark dark orange amber seems a notch darker than most and not as dark as other winter warmers. Good head on the pour and good lace in the end. Perfumey scent. Odd, yet sweet, almost like the samples at a dept. store. Really sparked my interest. The ale like bittneress and foaming feeling was good, and swallowed with a thinner taste with an aftertaste that was of malt and alcohol. Tasting this and putting it in a winter warmer category, it did not seem right. There are so many beers out of Colorado, and if you're not Coors, you're making good stuff. Taste was, well, malts, lots of them with a sweet flavor vaguely like licorace with hops that took backstage but made this a well balanced beer. For being so powerful, I would easily be lured into having a few, and being hammered for it."
"this is my favoite breckenridge i have had. its thicker then most of there beers and has some flavor."
"Pours a dark copper colour. Decent head that disappears quickly, but leaves a thin layer. Light lacing. Mild aroma, slight malt and spice. Flavour starts a little sweet, some caramel and toffee. Finishes slightly dry with a little tartness. Good mouthfeel. Very drinkable."
"This beer pours pale brown that has no hazing and lies beneath a nice pillowy tan head. The aroma consists of an overwhelming amount of alcohol smell with not much else poking through. The taste consists of roasted malts with more of the alcohol that nearly make it taste medicinal. It also has a seltzer type taste characteristic to the finish of each swallow. This is a light bodied beer that just doesn't have a lot going for it. It's okay, but other than a warming beer, not my choice for the holidays. Cheers!"
"Drinkability - not a show stopper, but a fairly interesting brew that your mainstreamers would probably tolerate."
"Kind of an over-the-hill large mild."
"This creature of winter sports a rich amber colour that leans into the red. Head formation consists of a beige hued topper that quickly drops into spitty gobs. Bubbly on the real. Positive for lace. Inspiring. Then: BOOM HEADSHOT! the nose weilds a sharp solvent dagger that reminds me of urinal cakes. Pissy scents too. Strangely candy fruity and Jons to Go-ish. The flavour is ground up sugar plum bushes, fruitcake trees and solvent. Feels like artificial flavours. Little bit of Frankinsense, psych. Let her sit a bit...The nose never gets better. The taste, however, is quite an improvement. Dark fruits. Sugar. Pepper and anise. The finish is somewhat flowery like that of a heather beer. Bizarre in that unpredicatable winter warmer way. The mouthfeel is medium or there abouts. Somewhat slick and syrupy. Drinkability is troubling. You could probably buy one bottle and pour everyone in the family a thimble full at ""Christmas Time"" and it would most likely be enough or more than enough in some instances. This one was a bit of a challenge. For some reason, I'll try it again next holiday season."
"This is a nice, rather easy to drink high abv beer. Nothing spectacular but I'd definitely get it again."
"D - Just OK. Not much there overall."
"The 2005 version of this Winter Warmer poured a dark orange color into my glass. Left a creamy, slight head that didnt stay around very long. I was encouraged by the sweet hoppy, almost peppery, scent that I detected. Tasted a blending of hops and malt flavors which unfortunately nearly cancelled each other out. Had a pleasant, light carbonation but a disappointingly thin mouthfeel. An enjoyable beer, but not one that Ill reach for again given the plethora of quality holiday beers that are now available."
"Pours a deep caramel brown into my pint glass, with a finger or so of off-white head that quickly dissipates. Aroma is of caramelly malt, spices, and some nutty yeast flavor. Taste is decent, caramel with spices - I taste some anise (which I don't particularly care for) and maybe cardamom. There is a piney hop flavor up front, followed by the nutty maltiness. Not so drinkable. Alcohol is evident as it warms. It's a good Christmas ale, but not an exceptional example of the style. I'd pick something else if available."
"12 ounce bottle. Breckenridge Christmas Ale pours out a dark amber color with a medium sized head. The aroma is bready malt, almonds, pine, and cooked vegetables. Toasted malt flavor is nice up front, but it's quickly ruined by a cooked vegetable taste. The finish is metallic. Medium mouthfeel. This beer has some nice malty flavors, but there are also some nasty off-flavors. The result is a mediocre Winter Warmer."
"Overall, I thought this was a nicely bodied and refreshing Winter Warmer that was spiced just right, but which was, otherwise rather non-descript. Worth trying if you come across it, though I won't buy a sixer this Holiday season."
"Pours a deep amber color with a small white head taht falls to a patchy coat over top. Nose is slightly piney, definate corainder spice character, with a sweet caramel base. Flavor is a little weak. I get a pine and big caramel character, but it doesn' grab and stay like I expect it to. Just okay. Feel is moderate to thick with a light to moderate carbonation. Just an okay winter warmer. I'd like a more complex brew. The sweetness just seems to be the focus, and there is a lot more that can come in a winter brew."
"I'll pass on the rest of this sixer."
"Smells of spice, like Christmas. But on first taste-- tasted like a stout with some extra thrown in?? Yes, I believe it is. It's Breckenridge's stout with a few extra ingredients to make it look like a Christmas ale. Mouthfeel is thin and consistency is almost like water. That's good and bad. One would desire a thicker mouthfeel but on the other hand, the thinness makes one think of Colorado mountain water. Hopefully that's what they use. At least it's easy to drink."
"Alcohol was well concealed- was this year's still 7.4%?. Very drinkable."
"The color is a clear, chestnut brown with a creamy, light-brown head of average height. The aroma is weak, but not unpleasent. An herbal hop smell is most notable atop a sweet, toasted malt body. The taste of this beer screams American brown ale, not winter warmer. The malt body is toasted with dark caramel flavors everywhere. The overall flavor is more sweet than rich. A mild herbal hop flavor bounds about throughout a sip. Breckenridge Christmas works well as a brown ale, nothing spectacular, and despite a high ABV, this isn't a winter warmer."
"Overall a beer that looks spectacular but falls off soon after it hits your mouth. Cool looking bottle but the contents didn't excite me. A good beer to have in the fridge for the holidays to serve to not-so-close friends/company. Glad I only bought one bottle for $1.50."
"Great label on this bottle, like an old Christmas card from your grandparents' attic. Poured a dark chestnut, with so little carbonation evident on the pour that I was afraid for a moment that I'd gotten a flat bottle. After a second, though, a thin sheen of lace appeared. Characteristic of a winter warmer with substantial malt and reserved caramel and roasted flavors. There was some indescript spice flavor in the background, but seemed to be yeast-produced rather than a spice adjunct. Not bad, but a bit too timid to satisfy my expectation for the style."
"I think this falls somewhere in between SNCA and OSA, with characteristics of each. Unfortunately this one just doesn't quite do it for me like those other superior brews."
"Notes: Winter warmers really aren't my thing. Still, this is a finely crafted beer that is perfect for a yucky Ohio late winter day. I'd recommend trying it at least once."
"This is okay. Nothing special."
"Something about this beer just rubbed me the wrong way. I had a hard time finishing a single glass. Better in bottled form."
"Pours a dark orange-copper color, huge foamy off white head, leaves a nice lacing in the glass, malty caramel aroma, fruity caramel flavor, medium bodied with a full and soft mouthfeel, finishes a bit sweet, not bad, a decent and drinkable winter ale."
"Amber body with dark copper edges and a small, off-khaki head. Sugar cookie dough aromas with eggnog sweetness, caramel maltiness, and spicy vague hops. Taste is sweet, caramelly malt and cookie dough up front. Juicy, piney hops soon follow. Not too big or flavorful, but slightly astringent. Can't do much in the way of balancing the sweet cookie malt. Finish is sweetish and tart-fruity. Not bad. Medium-bodied, although a touch on the watery side. Don't put this on your xmas list."
"A nice brew to warm up with on a cold winters night."
"Yeah, I can drink it, but it's nothing to shout about."
"Pours out to a nutty brown clear color, with a nice off-white head. Smelled lightly of alcohol light spiced scents. Alcohol was very present in the flavor, along with some thin cinammon and gingerbread flavors. Pretty sweet, but not one of the better winter warmers that I have had, kind of dissapointing. There are many better beers than this one trick pony."
"Overall impression: Decent winter beer with some nice spice flavors, but drinkable enough that you can drink more than one."
"A clear, ruby-chestnut body rests gently beneath a short, creamy head of light tan that drops slowly to a thin surface covering; leaving tiny spots and splashes of lace about the glass. It's quite smooth and even somewhat creamy across the palate with a medium, dextrinous body and fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation that's quite British in character. The nose is inviting, and quite interesting, with interwoven notes of caramel-drizzled and biscuity/bready malt, dark dried fruits (prunes and raisins), and pine. The flavor follows suit, and it's a fairly rich and somewhat complex brew with a beautiful, biscuity and toffee-ish malt component that's accented by yeasty fruitiness and a dollop of rounding buttery diacetyl. It's reminiscent of the Fuller's yeast character; and it's very English indeed! As it warms, the hops become more apparent... leafy, grassy, and slightly mineral-like; leaving it to finish with some lingering buttery toffee and drying, leafy and resinous hops. An excellent beer that delivers exactly what I'd expect of an English brewed winter warmer. Definitely worth trying!"
"Feel is close to medium approaching thin, definately empty and nearly depleted of anything that would perhaps help this concoction. No sir, I didn't like it."
"Pours out a very dark brown, with very little head, alot like a barleywine. aroma is highly reminiscent of a brown ale -with a chocolatey nose up front and some malt and a strange lemony zest in the background. This is a very different winter ale. It tastes and feels alot like stone's 8th anniversary brown ale, sans lemon zing.I really enjoy the chocolatey taste up front but the lemony zing in the aftertaste is a bit unwelcome. Quite drinkable for a beer this big and a very smooth, creamy mouthfeel. If you don't like SNCA - then this may be for you...I'll stick to my hops, thank you."
"Good but unremarkable winter/christmas beer. Poured with virtually no head, decent carbonation though that saves the mouthfeel. Aroma is hoppy with some spicing and alcohol. Taste is slightly spicy with prunes, raisins and ripe fruit present. None of the tastes really jump out and take over. Mouthfeel seems a tad thin. Very drinkable, smooth, non-offensive beer, would make a good introduction into spiced/winter beers for a skeptic but I like my beers to jump out at me personally."
"Clear mahogany. Thin beige head with little retention. Lacing is spotty and sparse. Some faint sweet malt aromas and a bit of a spicy hop presence if you sniff hard enough. Body is almost medium and the mouthfeel is just kind of there. The flavors are nice enough. Sweet malts and dark fruits blend nicely. Raisin and plum come to mind. A little piney character. And there's a slight lingering bitter dryness after the swallow. Pretty good."
"Winter warmers--in my mind at least--should be medium-full, subtly carbonated, creamy, slightly sweet and mildly-moderately spiced with an ABV on the high side to encourage contemplative sipping. Other than the arguably highish ABV, Breckenridge Christmas Ale fails on all counts. I haven't been particularly impressed by any beer from this brewery and this one has done nothing to change my mind."
"Dark mahogany color, clear and transmits chestnut highlights. Tan head settles at 1/4 of an inch. Crystalline ring laces. Smells of brown sugar/cinnamon on toast. Viscous mouthfeel, a little flat but consistent and without fade. Pleasant taste, caramel and a hint of a cherry impression, rounds to a lush carob and vanilla with a peach sense. A little sweet overall, but a good and festive brew with a number of individual and subtle flavors.."
"This is a drinkable beer but there are so many other seasonals I would rather drink first."
"A clear, dark, toffee-brown beer with red highlights. Small, off-white, foamy head dies fast. The roasty aroma is almost a little smoky, with nuts, tangy caramel, buttery malt. Roasted nuts give way to a sweetish, fruity, tangy, caramel body. It's just a little watery. Hoppy, bitter, nutty, tangy finish. Not bad."
"Final Thoughts: Part of a mixed six pack I put together for the holiday season, so far just middle of the pack."
"12 ounce bottle, old style label with no date markings on the side."
"This one wasn't too bad. It was very bland when it was cold, but got better as it warmed. It had tastes of various fruits, mostly plums and such, but also had a hint of peach. It also had some different spices intertwined in it. Couldn't really point them out though. The biggest disappointment was the appearance. It was the color of a bock, but hardly had any head at all. The small head fizzed out to an almost nonexistent laceing. It's not great, but's it's not the worse christmas ale I've had. Give it a shot if you like."
"Overall Impression 1: Bah humbug. Just didnt lift my spirits. The flavor is too mild, the alcohol too pronounced, the spices too subtle. Id recommend looking into what ever is causing the DMS, changing the hop schedule to add some more AAs, maybe caramelizing the wort a bit to it some depth, heck, go wild, this one needs a real retool."
"Drinkability: Easy-drinking, but lacking in character. Worth a try, but no need to work too hard to find."
"The Christmas Ale poured reddish-brown with very little head. The head quickly disappeared for the most part leaving little traces. The beer had a slight malty, caramel like aroma with hints of alcohol, pretty subtle overall. It tasted a little spicy with a big hoppy finish. It was pretty full-bodied with a slight metallic feel. Overall, not as impressive as I was expecting. I normally like a spicier Christmas Ale."
"Not impressed by this one. Hopefully next years will be better."
"Hmm.Christmas in September.When poured into my glass, this beer had a very small sized tan head with fine-small sized bubbles that fully diminished.The body was carbonated and clear with a reddish-brown hue.The nose consisted of malt, caramel? and alcohol.The flavor was that of caramel, slightly sour and tart with a lingering aftertaste.It had a smooth mouthfeel, watery, dry finish and medium bodied.There was good lacing with this beer."
"This is a decent winter beer..worth getting a six-pack of..it's probably the best beer I've had from this brewery too....but when stacked up against the best strong ales it is only slightly above average ...I like though...."
"Cant say this legendary brew wowed me much. Pours dark brown, reddish highlights, good clarity. The head was surprisingly minimal, poor retention, some spotty lace. The nose seemed too clean but there is a healthy dose of toasted, sweet malt. Straightforward taste; malty sweet yet bitter. Plenty of alcohol to warm the soul on a cold night. Overall this is a decent winter warmer, not a must try but dont stray away from it either."
"pours out a deep dark ruby color. a hard pour produces an thin brown head. surprising enough it does leave a nice lace as you drink it. aroma of choco/caramel malt with fresh northwest hops. caramel malt flavors ride an oily and buttery mouthfeel straight down my throat. seems too slick...citric hop flavors are there and gone too. it needs more carbonation or something...lots of body and hoppiness is lost because there is nothing to hold it up. high ABV is apparent but succinctly masked. they slide down way too easy for such a high ABV, and i'm sure they're even more potent in the rarified air of colorado."
"The body is deep brown with a good head that lasts fairly well. There are aromas of hay, lemon and molasses. The flavor is dark but not thick. The malt is wood and molasses. It is sweet and meaty but not heavy or chewy."
"Dark garnet hue, w/ excellent clarity. The beige, intially thick head settles into a thin, spotty layer that coats the rim of the glass. Dark caramel sweetness and bready malt upfront aromawise, followed by drying biscuit and mild diacetyl butterscotch. Trace chocolate malt. Lightly earthy Fuggles hop nose and fruity esters lend an overall ""British"" aroma profile. Rich, dark caramel coupled with biscuit malt lends an toffeeish sweetness initally in flavor, then mellow diacetyl surfaces and provides richness. Although the hop bitterness is mild, a pleasantly dry, nutty, cracker like maltiness assists in offsetting the malt sweetness. Moderately bodied, and smooth in mouthfeel, due to both ample residual dextrins and low relative carbonation. Perhaps a touch oily. The earthy hop flavor mirrors that of the aroma, but is present at a lower level. Finishes sweet, w/ hints of burnt malt. Rustic breadiness coats the palate with an exhale. Breckenrige Xmas is a well above average and tasty winter brew. A bit high in diacetyl, but that seems to complement the dark caramel character. It was a steal for me at $4.99 a sixer."
"This stuff is pretty strong too. 2 or 3 sitting around the Christmas tree will make you see reindeer or elves running around your living room. Good stuff, I'll be buying it again."
"This stuff knocked my socks off! I was really surprised at how good this tasted, with a rich dark color and full flavor. This will definitely catch up to you after a few in front of the fireplace. Sweet malty taste and a long, mellow finish."
"Dark brown in color with a huge tan head that fades slowly, with moderate lace.  Aroma of chocolate and caramel predominates.  Chocolate and then burnt caramel dominate the palate with a slightly hoppy finish, strong alcohol taste, quite warming.  Not as much character as some winter beers I have tried, but certainly decent and very potent."
