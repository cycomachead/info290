Starts mild and sweet, but the bitterness of the hops quickly takes over.  This has a long finish.  It is pretty full-bodied and solid.  A very enjoyable beer - I will have to visit the brewpub on my next trip down I-5.","PacNWDad","Dec 09, 2014"
3.68,-1.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, December month notched with no year for dating. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, caramel, honey, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, caramel, honey, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, pine, caramel, honey, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly sticky, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice IPA. All around good balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink. It is at least a year old in age, but still a nicely enjoyable offering as it stands now.","superspak","Dec 05, 2014"

3.75,0.3,,,,,,"Poured from a 355 ml bottle into an English pub glass. A dark orange-yellow amber with a half-finger of off-white foam gracing my glass. Looks like a pale ale or IPA, smells like a pale ale or IPA ... Lots of tropical fruit (mango), floral, and piney hop notes on the nose along with a brown sugar sweetness. Certainly more hoppy than your average winter warmer but quite sweet as well. I get more of the dried mango from the nose along with apricots, tangerine, pine needles, dried currants and sultana raisins, pancake syrup, and a faint nutty note. Although maltier than many of the aforementioned pale ale family, this is still a straight up kissing cousin to said clan. The finish starts sweet but dries out over time. Has a borderline syrupy mouthfeel that may or may not jive with the aggressive hop bill and the carbonation is at the low end of moderate. Enjoyable if a tad rough around the edges.","CalgaryFMC","Aug 26, 2014"

Listen, I've got a beat-up Nokia phone from 2003. No interwebs access, no fancy-schmancy beer apps, so, I gotta go with what the beer bottle tells me. 'Winter' on the label can usually imply a malt-forward brew or something potentially packed with spices, the only ingredients listed were ""water, orange barley, and hops"". I assume yeast was utilized as well at some point. At any rate, a nice brew.","ChainGangGuy","Nov 10, 2011"
3.67,-1.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Golden straw in color (hazy) with a white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma of mainly citrus and pineapple.

Big hoppiness in the nose, there may be some dry bready malts but they are subsumed by the spicy, floral Cascade presence. Taste is certainly more of an IPA than a traditional Winter Warmer, huge hoppy bitterness, and a big bitter finish. Big carbonated mouthfeel. Not the most drinkable of beers at this ABV. While the WW category lacks precise definition, this is certainly more of an (D)IPA than WW, IMO. However, a great hoppy holiday ale to counterbalance the spiciness and fruitiness of other beers served during this time of year. Worth a try for the hopheads.","jdense","Dec 23, 2009"

Decent beer.","drpimento","May 01, 2007"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"This is a nice change of pace from more hoppy IPAs, which I tend to like. Definitely goes down easy, yet still remains hoppy enough to be interesting.

3.87,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Found in Calgary. Yes, the advertisement says the hoppiest Winter beer, and it's an IPA for its seasonal. Lacey head, creamy on cloudy yellow. Hop and barley aroma.

Overall a very very nice IPA.","Reidrover","Nov 22, 2006"
3.85,2.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a bright golden-orange color topped by a half-inch of stark white head that lingers for just a moment before retreating into a small halo. Aroma of pale and caramel malts, light fruity hops, and a touch of fresh fruit. Palate is a bit better balanced and more subtle than the nose - the fruity hops fully emerge around mid-palate, yielding to a caramel sweetness on the finish. Body is nice and creamy, with a good bit of alcohol warming on the finish. Nicely drinkable, although a bit odd to be considered a winter beer. Call it whatever you want, I'll still gladly drink it.","ElGordo","Nov 11, 2006"
3.55,-5.1,3,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours an orange/copper color. Slightly hazy from the yeast. Very little head to this one. Citrusy aroma with some caramel and maybe some biscuit notes. Kind of hard to tell, doesn't seem like there is much aroma. Nice crisp bitterness in the flavor. Bready flavor with some somkiness. Dry mouthfeel and lightly carbonated. This is an intestesting beer, I'll have this one again.","nvsblman","Sep 22, 2006"
2.85,-23.8,3.5,3.5,2.5,3,2.5,"Re-review 5/1 Ok this is better. It's not great but at least it's drinkable. Hops are bitter and grassy, almost like stinging nettles. The malts are a bit too smooth, lapsing into a green-apple, butterscotch yeast flavor, but on the whole the beer is not nearly as offensive. The hops are probably the highlight; the rest of the beer ho-hum. Upping the score accordingly.","Thrasher","Apr 28, 2006"
3.15,-15.8,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"12 ounce bottle. Fish Tale Winterfish pours out a hazy amber color with small head. The aroma is piney and herbal. Sweet caramel flavor balanced by piney hops. Some lemon iced tea flavor. Tropical fruit flavors too. Nice balance, but I'm not very impressed with the flavor in this beer. Mouthfeel is medium. Very low carbonation. Drinkability is ok. I didn't detect the frsh hop flavors described by other reviewers. Perhaps mine was an older bottle.","beveragecaptain","Jan 28, 2006"

Head quickly fades down to an uneven layer of bubbles, and minimal small bubbles of lacing. Aroma is fruity hops with a syrupy malt undercurrent. Taste is similar to the nose, but the hops are a bit moire varied, with pine coming into play a bit as well with the fruit. Bitter alcoholic close. Mouthfeel is alright, maybe a bit on the flat side, and drinkability is okay as well. This one hasn't caused me to run out and find more. But if I happen upon it, I'd give it another chance.","ppoitras","Jan 21, 2006"

4.12,10.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Dark copper color with a thick white head of tight bubbles. A nice sheet of lace is left down the side of the glass. The aroma is dominated by the hops. As discussed amongst some Bas attending a tasting, the aroma smells like Simcoe, mandarin orange, a little grassy character. The site says Chinook, but it really does taste like Simcoe. Not sure, but I like it. There is a little caramel back on the nose. The taste has the sweet/citrus character backed by toffee malt. Nice, sharp (not over-the-top) bitterness. Very slick mouth feel, great drinkability.","carln26","Nov 21, 2005"
4.68,25.1,4.5,4,5,4.5,5,"Pours a burnt orange gold with a very sticky head that fades fairly quickly but sticks to the glass with a vengence. The aroma is filled with hop oils and the ripeness that comes from the dry hopping. The taste is sweet up front, and the hop bitterness follows with power. The flavoring hops are very nicely done and make a huge presence, but don't outstay their welcome. The pine-like bitterness that comes through is absolutely great. The roughness of the hops are so fresh and pure that it actually feels as though it is scratching your mouth (which is surprisingly awesome) but it completely smooths out in the finish. This stuff goes down incredibly smooth and I could handle this all night. They definately used some huge NW hops in this brew and it all paid off. One of the best IPAs I have had in a while.","ALESwhatCURESya","Nov 18, 2005"

4.27,14.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"A hazy (bottle-conditioned) orange/copper body rests sleepily beneath a good-sized head of fine-bubbled, creamy white foam. The head retention is quite good and it leaves some very nice Brussels-style lace about the glass. The nose is a touch fruity from the yeast, sweetly bready, and hoppy with pine and grapefruit (Centennials? Or perhaps a Chinook/Cascade combination?). It's quite smooth and creamy in the mouth, starting with a delicate caress from it's exceptionally fine-bubbled natural carbonation and becoming more solid as its full body becomes apparent. The interplay between the yeasty fruitiness and grassy, subtly pine/spruce like hops is interesting with a speedbump of lightly sweet malt thrown in the middle there. It's not overly complex, or as rich, brash, or bold as some examples, but it is quite enjoyable in its own right - hence, a great drinkability. The only thing that might hold back its drinkability is its 7% abv; but the alcohol itself never shows or becomes a problem, it's just that you can't drink too many in one sitting. Or course the question is ""would you want to?""... I think perhaps yes!","NeroFiddled","May 06, 2005"

Some caramel malt and a nice bit of citric hops make up the aroma. Fairly mild aroma but pleasant. Flavor starts of a bit sweet with malt upfront before the bitter grapefruit takes control. Tastes quite juicy with hops and is pretty solid. Ends on a slight bitter hop note. Medium body and it goes down smooth with a slight prickling from the bitterness. Good drinkability, while its not a favorite of mine its a good solid IPA.","meathookjones","Mar 31, 2005"

It goes down easy and finishes bitter with a hoppy aftertaste. It has a powerful malty presence and a well hid elevated abv. . The mouthfeel is great.

2.65,-29.1,4,4,2,2.5,2,"Beer started off well, poured a glowing orange color with a good head and a spicy-sweet and floral aroma. The taste was strange though, only lightly fruity with more bitterness than sweetness, and a thin only slightly malty body. It was definitely spiced up, but the spices seemed ""off"" (I don't know how else to describe it) and the dry and slightly piney finish turned the spices to ash in my mouth. Honestly I could only finish about half a glass, it seemed like it had been watered down or something. If I see one of these I'll try it again just to be sure I guess.","PopeJonPaul","Nov 29, 2004"

3.73,-0.3,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Tawny copper with a slight haze. Dense, mountainous, persistent ivory white head leaves muddled lace. The aroma is comprised of rounded tangerine citrus accompanied by sharper hints of pine sap and lemon rind. Soft medium lovibond caramel sweetness offers contrast. Well balanced aromawise. Pronounced toffee upfront in flavor is quickly ensued and nearly overrun by assertive, quinine like hop bitterness. Bitterness is quickly fleeting, however, and malt of a brown sugar sprinkled burnt biscuit nature surges in mid palate. Residual sweetness persists and a combines with the citric hop undertone to lend a toothsome orange marmalade impression. Seemingly moderately attenuated, with both ample dextrins and residual sugars facilitating a firmly viscous, somewhat syrupy mouthfeel. Caramel presence augments as it breathes, leaving the lasting impression skewed towards malt sweetness. Finishes appropriately bittersweet, with a lingering note of candied lemon pith. Quite an enjoyable brew, but a touch heavy on the palate for regular quaffing. Winterfish is simple, but malt driven in its overall character. Hops provide apt balance. Very tasty.","marc77","Nov 08, 2003"
