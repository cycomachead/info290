"O – Definitely an American version of the winter warmer, with the piney hops, but excellent malt presence, and a balanced, rewarding beer.  Solid."

"Overall, this was a nicely spiced winter warmer.  The flavoring is savory enough to keep you coming back for more, and the spice is certainly there, but the wonderfully decreased pint night special pricing also helped quite a bit.  The beer went well with our jalapeño burger and chicken Caesar wrap, respectively, helping to quell any spice or savoriness from the meal.  Really, rather standard, but flavorful, aromatic, and hearty enough for season."

"First offering from Boulevard that I haven't liked. Way to hoppy of a winter warmer for my tastes."
"O - It is not a bad beer. It is a nice change of pace from a little of the heavily spiced winter warmers. It is nothing to trade a kidney for, but I would be happy to have it each winter."
"Amber to brown in color with a lot of suspended minuscule sediment within the body gives it a murky complexion.  A half inch of tightly knit beige head is present.  I smell light malt and perhaps hazlenut.  The flavor is more of a nutty fare with gentle citrus dry hopping.  The body is fairly smooth and dry."

"O. Nice winter beer that has some warming ability. Good holiday flavors. Very drinkable."
"Kind of bitter for a Winter Warmer."
"Much too bitter for it to be considered a Christmas ale."
""
"This beer has a nice taste, which consists of a definite happiness, it is altogether approachable and drinkable."

"Did not taste like a high ABV beer. Wasn't too bitter. Was interesting. Easy to drink for what I was expecting. Would definitely try again."

"Pour is deep copper to ruby color with a hearty off white head that fades fairly quickly.  Leaves good lacing behind.  Aroma is of malt sweetness, candy sugar and hops.  Taste is slightly sweet with hints of candy sugar, plum, and hops.  Can definitely tell the hops are chinook with the bit of spice.  Mouthfeel is on the heavier side and coats the mouth.  Overall a very nice winter warmer made better with the addition of fresh hops.  A wintertime staple."

"I was happy to try this winter seasonal, since I'd never had it before and wanted to compare it to a couple of my other favorites in this style.  It held up fairly well, and I'd buy it again.  Good mix of traditional holiday flavors, and a bit higher alcohol content for when you're staying home and out of the snow."

"Overall: A good beer experience. The flavor really changes with the temperature. In my opinion, a bit smoother at lower temps. With higher temps, you get more of the hop/alcohol bite, not necessarily a negative thing."

"Pours a hazy amber bronze in color with a good 1-finger light beige foamy head that settles down to a thin layering. Lacing was seen with each sip but wasn't heavy. The aroma is of caramel malts with a touch of honey and spices. The taste is about the same with some citrus over tones and a strong pepper spice finish. Slightly bitter finish as well."

""
""

"O: Taste is not quite what I had hope for after the nose, but it smells really good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(O)- A slightly richer and sweeter beer, but nothing that really reminds me of the holiday season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A pretty decent beer, although it wasn't that sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was very impressed with this offering from Boulevard. My only suggestion is that they turn down the hops just a bit. There are great moments when this beer evens out and is nearly perfect but there are also many occasions when the hops dominate the taste. I would recommend this to any and all beer lovers. Definitely a brew I am looking forward to having next winter."

"Made w Chinook hops, Nutcracker is a seasonal beer that I look forward to every year. The Chinook hop was developed as recently as 1985. It has a spicy flavor--definitely tasting of grapefruit and pine. About as close as I'll ever get to a spruce beer."
""
""
"O- one of the likable winter warmers. Looking forward to next years"
""
"Stylistically it throws me - it's like a fresh-hop-dubbel, which I've never heard of, but I like the shit out of it. Overall, pretty masterful, and one of my favorites from this year."
""
""
"very fine holiday offering from boulevard. this wet hop chinook ale pours a great dark, hazy red-brown hue with a creamy, stubborn head. smell is of hop oil, burnt brown sugar, and a little booze on the end. taste is easy to enjoy...hoppy and creamy, easy on the palate, and very drinkable. i enjoyed it even more as it warmed. i would definitely purchase this one again."
""
""
""
""
"VERY GOOD; SEEK IT OUT!"
""
"OVERALL: Really well done, hoppy example of a winter warmer; insanely easy to drink, and dangerous at 7.8%."
"Overall: It's fine, but, I'd politely pass it up on a second occasion."

"O: an interesting and distinct winter ale. Not challenging although it took me a little while to warm up to it."
"Overall: Probably my favorite winter warmer... because it's loaded with hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall= Love it"
""
""
"Update: The 2013 release is awesome. Blvd has tweaked this beer over the years and it seems to get better every year. Originally this beer was 5.8% abv now its up to 7.8% and better than ever."
"Very interesting ""winter warmer"" to say the least. Total contrast in styles and I wound not qualify this as a winter warmer simply cause of the hop presence. Doesn't make this a bad beer but IMHO has too much going on that contrast and not accentuate. Looks great, smells even better with the usual spices of the season shining through. Taste is unique with a winter warmer with a hop backing that totally doesn't work together the way I imagined. Very thin mouthfeel again not expected. Then again when you throw all logic out the window and don't judge by style it's a damn fine beer. Go figure. I am gonna buy another sixer and let them rest for a while to let the hops mellow than re-visit."
" I love the spicey bite that follows the smooth caramel"

"A perfect winter warmer. Starts rather caramel like with hints sorghum syrup, then the spiciness of the hops kick in. I wonder if this beer is the closet thing we produce that is closest to a true Burton Ale, someone needs to ask the Zythophyle. I love this beer by an open fire."

"O: A great holiday warmer that really packs a flavorful punch. The alcohol is present but does kill the palate. Can't wait to go back to Oklahoma were I can drink this yearly. Cheers!"

"O - nicely hopped for a ""winter warmer," good depth from the malt, definitely a nice Christmas-themed beer"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: usually I enjoy Boulevards offerings, but I could easily do without this one because I dont find this one all that well balanced, and the alcohol keeps all the other aspects of the brew at bay"
"O: I've been disappointed by several Boulevard beers I've tried. I am happy that they have redeemed themselves in my eyes with this one. I'll be a buyer every year if they keep making it."
""

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Interesting hue, nice foamy head, and some reasonably nice lacing. Nose is sweet and bready with a little spice. Flavor is a pungent combination of bitter nut and sweet raisin. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"Overall: A really good and interesting take on a Winter Warmer. Good hop spice and fruit esters with a solid malt balance."

"$6-7 for a six pack of this beer? A steal. Get a dozen."
""
""
""
"Spicey, toasted bread crust with notes of herbal and toasted citrus peel spicing. This is a hoppy, XMAS ale. All the XMAS spicing comes from the hops. Thats awesome. A hop forward Winter Warmer worth a try for any beer enthusiast."
""
""
"A tasty winter warmer with just the right amount of spices which do not dominate the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-A nice spice forward Christmas brew."
""
""
""
"O - This one was a pleasant surprise for sure. Very good winter ale for a very cheap price! I'm going to have to hunt some more of this down, and very soon!"
""
"Served On tap at Durty nellies. Appearance is a slightly hazy amber with thin layer of white head which retains a micro layer and leaves decent lacing. Nose starts with aromatic hops, and a mild festive spicing which features a touch of nutmeg along with a strong malty base. Taste is hoppy up front with pine and resin with a background of ginger and nutmeg. The spices are minuscule compared to the hop profile as this drinks more like an IPA than a winter warmer. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated with a light body. Overall, an enjoyable brew but not a standout."

"Pours a dark brownish gold color with a foamy off white head. Surprisingly I could smell fresh peaches, lots of caramel and some citrus. The taste is very piney with followed by a candy like sweetness and lots fresh hop flavor. The beer is medium bodied and the carbonation makes it feel soft and silky with a nice dry finish. I thoroughly enjoyed this winter warmer and plan on buying some more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of my favorite winter seasonals that I buy every year. I absolutely love the fresh hopped Chinook flavor and aroma. It fits perfectly with the sweet malt flavors."

"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a little above average. Overall it was a pretty good beer. Pretty flavorful and easy drinking. There wasn't really anything really outstanding about it but it was a pretty solid version of the style."
""
""
"Overall – Like I said, I really like this beer, and wish they would do it year round and just call it something else. It’s got a decent ABV, tastes good, just presents a taste and style combination that you don’t see every day, which I think is what makes it so fun. I could easily drink a copious amount of this brew while I read a book by the fire in between runs for logs. Awesome."

"In the end, this came across as a mediocre holiday ale, ultimately fair but non-distinct. It's worth drinking, but not worth too much effort to hunt down."

"O: This isn't your typical winter warmer. I thought it was more of a weizenbock type beer than anything else. Not a bad beer, but nothing special by any means and don't go in thinking you're going to get a boozy and sweet winter warmer."
"pours a mellow cherry red color with a gentle haze. huge white fluffy head sits atop this holiday looking beer. smells a but fruity, with plums, cherries, and maybe even figs in the nose. a slight sour smelling as well, which isnt entirely enticing. taste is surprisingly complex for what is billed as a winter warmer. i taste none of the usual alcoholic sweetness i ascribe the this genre of beer. theres a definite malt profile to this one tempered by some fruity yeasty things. mild honey and allspice flavors in the background too. mouthfeel is very nice, with an almost belgian style vibrancy to the feel, with a lovely dried fruit finish. i could wish for a higher abv here, but this one works just as it is."

"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer for a winter seasonal. It has a nice balance of malt and hops. There are so many bad Winter beers this falls in the good but not great category. I like a little spice in my Winter brews but not too much."
"O-It's avg. to above. Just a fresh hop ale that I would like more under a different name and style"
""
""
"Overall a surprised holiday ale indeed. The hop is the surprise for there is alot more than expected for a holiday ale."
""
""
""
"O- Good, hoppy addition to the seasonal ale rotation. Nothing overwhelming but decent enough."
""
"- I like this better than most winter beers that seem too sweet and loaded with spice. This one takes on a whole different spectrum of winter flavors. Seriously, we all know those fruity salads with mayo and walnuts. This is much like that, an amber with all those flavors without the dank mayo and nutty flavor. Not bad."
"O: Very interesting and complex. Easy drinking and quite fun to think about all of the things that go in to this beer. Will buy this beer again."
"a very good christmas ale. Straight forward, but lacking a slight bit of the taste and feel."
""
"o: not a big fan of winter warmers, but this is one i can and will drink more of. everything is well blended and balanced."
""
""
"Slainte."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- a session-able WW very easy to drink but lacked the punch and taste profile, more spice,hop,malt,toffee"
""
""
""
"O - This an OK winter warmer. I was hoping for a bit more complexity, but definitely a decent brew."
""
""
"Lot of complexities here, don't rush this beer ... let it warm up slowly and sip it and the flavors will unfold. This ale has more than enough going to put a grin on just about any beer geeks face."
"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Decent head and lacing, pours a cloudy deep amber. Spicey, fruity, and caramel aromas, like a fruit cake that doesn't suck. Taste of spicy hops, vanilla, bready malts. Medium carbonation with moderately dry finish. I like this, it's a subtle sessionable winter warmer with a nice malt/hop/spice balance."
""
""
""
"D - It's not bad, but far from anything good, especially when there are many, many better choices in this style."
"O-Hmm...the aroma on this beer I can leave it. The taste isn't bad. Where's the winter warmer? I get some caramel and dark sweet bread stuff, but it's almost like they went with that plus the IPA type winter seasonal that other breweries had and ended up with a slight mess. I'm not a huge fan of this beer."
"Overall, nothing special, but an interesting experience. I like the idea of the hops and sweeter malts together, could use a little more of the sweet to balance it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is sticky, and very much in the same vein as most pale ales. Overall, I'm biased, I love this beer every December. And honestly, it actually is a lot better than most of the other Winter Warmers out there. I love the color, taste, and feel, and it's very consistent every year."
""
"The taste is still bitter"
"Haven't had too many winter warmers, but this one is just alrite. Would've enjoyed a touch of spices and a bigger malt presence."
"M - light to medium body with a relatively dry finish. Good carbonation."
""
""
"Overall: I rather like this beer. I feel like it has some rough-around-the-edges imperfections in the flavor, but overall it is a positive drinking experience."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice chewy full bodied beer. A good array of complexity to provide a full experience for this hopped up winter warmer. Kind of reminds me of a mini barley wine."
""
""
""
"For some reason, nutcrackers always kinda creeped me out a bit. Yeah... Anyway, this stuff pours a partly cloudy sunset amber-russet topped by a finger of dirty khaki foam. The nose comprises nutmeg, clove, brown sugar, dark wheat, light pumpernickel, and a small vein of sweet caramel. The taste holds notes of orange peel, nutmeg, clove, dark wheat, light grapefruit rind, and cardamom. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly grainy feel. Overall, a nice little winter warmer, nothing really special, but drinkable enough to allow for a couple 'round the fireplace."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Despite everything positive about this beer, there is something that keeps me from really wanting to have more. However, it is a very good Americanized take on an English Strong Ale."
""
""
""
""
"Upon tasting, I get more spice, and some tones of fruit and nuts, with a slightly bitter finish. Boulevard has captured some appropriate flavors for the holidays, and this ale is solid, if unremarkable."
"O: This is a very solid beer. It really doesnt taste like a winter warmer to me, but doesnt take away from the fact that its a very solid good beer."
"O: Very solid winter warmer. I've really begun to dig the Boulevard seasonals after a year and a half since diving into the world of craft beer."
"Overall- A nice seasonal beer. I've had this one before and I will probably have it again. A good winter brew."
"O: This beer was nothing special, but it always feels like it's difficult to find a seasonal that blows me away. Compared to an Octoberfest I would rather drink this style all day long because it feels as this has the flavor I desire in my beer."
"O: Easy drinker, a nice seasonal offering."
"Drink- A pretty tasty winter warmer. A bit thin for me, but the bubbles and after taste make up for it. Don't think I will come back to this one, but pretty good."
"Delivers a lot of flavor, but not a very full mouthfeel that I expect from a winter warmer. Alcohol lacking for this style too. That said - this beer delivers a lot of satisfying flavor. A very drinkable holiday ale. Worth having some around during the holiday season to introduce others to this style."
"I picked this one up at a local liquor store last holiday season, and neglected to enter my rating back then. I shall do so now. Poured an opaque reddish brown color with an impressive enough head. Aromas of nuts, piney hops and dark fruits. On the palate, this one is medium bodied, with flavors of dark fruits, resiny hops and caramel."
"A good beer, Ive had it both bottled and on tap and I would have to say that I do enjoy it more on tap for whatever that is worth"
"O: Not sure on this one, I am guessing its no longer good, but can't imagine a change this drastic. Will try again."
"the CPJ"
"Fairly filling which is expected although smooth. Very tasty for a winter season. Definetly gives a warming feeling during the cold months."
"O: My absolute favorite seasonal from Boulevard. Always a staple in the fridge come the wintertime, and a great deal to boot at $6.99 a six pack. Improve the mouth feel a bit and we have a contender for favorite seasonal, right up there with Celebration Ale. Still, an incredibly complex and satisfying beer for the ass cold winter months of the Midwest."
"Drinkability: I don't detect anything warming about this ale. As I said, I just don't think 5.9% is sufficient for the style... Most commercially (read grocery store) available Winter Warmers tend to lack in this area... and that's where I found this brew. It's tasty enough, but it's actually a little bit more drinkable than it should be! I usually don't finder winter warmers to be all that comfortable to drink, but I could have 2 or 3 of these in a night before I'd be completely tired of it."
"D- This beer was good but nothing special. Easy drinker with some lower ABV. While this beer was good it was also easy to forget. Overall glad I tried it and will do it again."
"Overall a bit sweet perhaps, but full-bodies enough to keep from a cloyingly sweet flavor."
"Dr: I'd certainly have it again at this price. I'm liking winter warmers more and more. This is no exception."
"D - Great price and doesn't taste too alcoholic. I'd be happy drinking this one all night."
"Nice sweetness and hoppier than expected. No spice to speak of. A different take on the style. Good drinkability."
"Bottle at December Santa Cruz tasting. Pouts an orangey brown color with a wispy tan head. Aromas of apples and oranges go along with molasses maltiness. Flavor is sweetish cakey brown malts with some piney bitterness that comes through in the back of the palate. Light-bodied but pretty flavorful."
"Boulevard's Winter warmer, Nutcracker Ale, pours a garnet brown color, apparently the standard color for such beers. The aroma is subtle. Caramel and fruit are the main components of the round nose. The palate is medium bodied with carbonation. The flavors of nuttiness and malt sweetness is moderate but nice. It finishes with some bitter hops at the end which provides balance and rounds out the flavor experience. Fro a winter warmer this beer has noticeable drinkability."
"This is not a beer to drink casually. While I would likely drink a second, I would be a while getting to it as it helps to savor this one slowly allowing flavors to develop as the ale warms. Overall, this is a very good beer that does evoke a holiday cheer."
"I'd enjoy drinking a lot of this. It goes down smooth and is void of any bitterness. Decent alcohol will keep you warm during the holidays."
"The taste is a bit sweet with some brown ale characteristics. The spicing is there a bit and there is some mild earthiness to this. The spicing doesn't come through too much until the back end and especially in the finish. Medium body with good carbonation. A bit drinkable, but the finish is slightly off-puting in juxtaposition to the flavor and I don't quite need all that much of this."
"Poured a rich tawny color with a huge billowing crown that held for a very long time,finally settling into a frothy mass after leaving globs of soap scum lookin stuff behind.Spicy hop and caramel malt come together well,it has to be chinooks to give off such a spicy note in its hop profile,very nice.A nice mix of winter spice,clove,cinnamon,nutmeg,candied orange peel,and again that hop spiciness,a sweet but not overly sweet caramle base holds true to the finish.Each year I say Iam gonna get some of this stuff,this year I finally did and Iam glad I did,this for my money is one of the best winter warmer's out there."
"D: Good if I was expecting a hoppy beer but I was expecting more malty taste that would be higher in alcohol like a ""typical"" winter warmer. I think this one comes across more like a pale ale or even an IPA. Surprise!"
"D: While not overly heavy, the combination of the feel and the taste go together for a beer that would give me trouble drinking multiple. Not a bad beer, but I have had a number of winter ales that, in my opinion, are superior, particularly for the season. Good try, but not one I'll actively seek out."
"I was not overly impressed with this one. Absent the apple flavor, this probably could have been a pretty good beer-however that flavor really fought with the other components of the beer, making for a less than pleasant experience."
"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a cream-colored head. The aroma is heavy on the toffee malt and piney hops. The hop presence is a lot heavier than I remembered from when I had it in previous years. The flavor is grassy and piney hops, along with caramel and toffee. I also get some cinnamon and clove notes. Low overall bitterness, but quite a bit of hop flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"It has a light red core with copper at the edges. The carbonation produces a creamy tan head that settles to a 1/4 finger and hangs around a while. The aroma is malty with some oats and spice. The flavor is a tad earthy with nutmeg, perhaps some clove. It has a decent body and has a tart aftertaste. It's a decent way to get through the long winter months."
"Overall: I'm not ready to go out and buy a case, but this is not a bad beer at all. Make sure you leave it to warm a bit before diving in to avoid that metallic taste."
"The brew has an oily and chewy feel."
"Overall this beer is a surprise to me but in a very good way. It has a very balanced taste and is very drinkable. A wee high on ABV at almost 6% but still great for winter days. Great Beer Boulevard Brewing Co!"
"drinkability - yes i want more and yes i will get some - i plan on going back to the store and buying then out (around 2+ cases)"
"In a phrase... a nice balance of malt and hops in a medium bodied beer that finishes smooth. Pours a dark amber color with malty notes. Lacking in hop aroma, but the flavor sneaks in a gets you when you least expect it. Not much going on in the head department as well. Very easy to drink and appeals to many drinkers. Too bad it's not available all year."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. With the flavors included, it makes for a beer that is drinkable but not something that could be drunk all night long. Still, a good seasonal from Boulevard."
"Drinkability: Is a classic ale to have with a meal and would suggest it to anyone wanting to venture out to a new Winter Warmer."
"D- Pretty good, this is one of my favorite beers for the wintertime. I'll drink it, and I like drinking it."
"flavor is nice, similar to aroma, medium-bodied. the ginger is a nice touch and adds character. the spices are apparent but not dominating, lending a delicate touch to the sweet and bready malt."
"D: An interesting beer for sure. I really like the weird earthiness and the flavors not usually associated with beer (mushrooms, peanut butter?). The only drawback is that it seems to have a few parts missing. I was underwhelmed by the nose and the mouthfeel was nothing to write home about. But I do give Boulevard an A for effort, and it's drinkable to boot."
"D - A good beer. Great balance. The fruit notes on the nose and tongue were really nice. I really liked the texture, it was almost creamy."
"D - Delicious and drinkable with a low ABV and some great flavor."
"I look forward to this beer each winter, and when I have it in my fridge, it seems to go pretty fast. This is a great beer to drink leading up to the holidays. The site lists the ABV at 6.6%, but the bottle says 5.9%, so this is a great beer to enjoy all evening long!"
"Great drinking, solid beer."
"D: This is one of the best ""seasonal"" beers i've got this year. Not sure it qualifies as a ""seasonal," as it is a straight forward IPA, however, this beer is perfectly balanced and has a great nose. I have bought this beer quite a few times and will continue to do so."
"Overall value is quite high at 7.50 a sixer!"
"A solid winter warmer. I don't quite get the wet hopping that the description indicates."
"Boulevard Brewing Company--Nutcracker Ale--Our Unfiltered Winter Warmer--Beer Elf Signatures--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.90% ABV. 38 IBU's. (3.0 / 5.0 ) Amber Ale. No sediment. Dense rocky lacy light orange head & bright cloudy color. Malty floral hop fruit ester front. Malty frothy sweet caramel fruit ester zesty rich Amber Ale body. Mild hop lingering ester end. A little sweet & fruity. Sampled 11/20/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $7.99 @ Seattle QFC--Ballard on 11/5/2010."
"Solid choice, just won't wow you."
"Overall, a nice surprise. It's very well balanced and has some nice bright hoppiness. I'll have to add this to the list to get each winter."
"D: Simple, good-twist, not overpowering."
"D - Interesting beer and glad to try it, but not one for session for me."
"It's drinkability is pretty high."
"D: Goes down alright, mild kick, decent representation of style. Winter warmers used to be one of my favorite styles - although I've moved away from them, if you're looking for a decent winter warmer, this is one to go with."
"Medium bodied and kind of harshly firm. A relatively good beer, but disappointing because it seems like it could be so much better."
"Pumpkin orange with blonde highlights a big fluffy light tan head that leaves scaps of lace on the glass. Nice fruity citrusy hops and caramel in the nose with a touch of holiday spice and toast. Medium bodied with mild carbonation. A good winter brew, almost more IPA than winter warmer though."
"Overall - Not my style generally, but this one kept the winter warmer-type novel ""flavorings"" to a minimum. I could drink a few around a fire with family or good friends."
"Pours an orangish brown with a tan head. Fruity malts, light hops and spices. Nice medium body."
"Drinks well-it warms the body nicely- a solid choice any chilly night of the year."
"Slightly oxidized medium body that is very hop forward for the style with lots of dry earthy pine notes and subtle hints of citrus. There is a very prominent caramel malt backbone with a thick syrupy consistency. Slight peppery spice with hints of dark fruit, mostly tart dark cherry. Slightly creamy mouthfeel which is decently balanced with perhaps too strong of a hop character. Slightly dry finish."
"D - This was an interesting beer to say the least. At least to me it seemed pretty unique. I don't know I would get it again, but it is worth a shot if you are looking for a different kind of holiday cheer."
"Notes: More hops than you would expect, pretty good mix. A little too hoppy for me (in that I was expecting less hops and more caramel/nutty malt and spice)."
"D: Once again decent drinkability per style, with a festive blend of spices gives this a holiday feel but a couple is plenty at one sitting."
"Pours a cloudy orangish brown with a huge tan head. Smells strongly of roasted malts and spicy hops. Taste is caramel malt up front, with a woody, earthy, yet also citrusy hop finish. Mouthfeel is very rich and smooth, average carbonation levels. Drinkability is good, this is a good winter warmer that I plan on buying next year."
"D: Not bad, definitely a consideration for a winter session, but maybe falls a little short here. I really enjoy this beer, but would probably reach for something a little more ""roasty"" in the winter. Nice beer from a brewery that is really growing on me."
"D: Hops a very prominent. Not very complex. Easily drinkable[ especially with hearty winter foods."
"Overall, I like this better than the State-Wide IPA. I'm an all year ""winter warmer"" drinker. Like my beers a bit bigger. If you want to try Boulevard, try this!"
"In general winter warmers are not my style of beer. Although, I found Nutcraker Ale to be one of the best I have had. It is the complete opposite of most winter warmers you see, like the style link says on this site many beers with a bunch of spices like a wassail may say winter warmer. This is the first beer I have ever tried from Boulevard, but it makes me want to try more."
"Thanks again BlueOkie!"
"Quite drinkable despite touch of noticeable alcohol (which enhances rather than detracts in this case). A hoppy winter wamer, with a nice minty seasonable touch to it."
"D - Simple but drinkable. Hop taste is a bit too strong, but the beer went down smooth and strong with a warm stew."
"Overall, this beer seems more like an AIPA than a winter warmer. I like this better than the Single Wide IPA, too. Has really good hop flavors and remains very drinkable despite high ABV."
"This is a neat beer that's worth trying at least once a year."
"Tanks to wagenvolks for the extra! 12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a hazy dark orange with a decent eggshell head. Aroma is sweet malts, pine hops and mild spice. The taste is an interesting blend of sweet malts and citrus and pine hops with a mild amount of cinnamon. The beer is medium bodied with decent carbonation. This is an enjoyable Winter Warmer, but not likely one I'd bother with again."
"Overall a pretty neutral event. Certainly a quality brew, just no real flavor to grab on to."
"D: Body and flavor combine for an excellent drinkability. Delicious beer all the way around."
"It's alright, but not some of my fav characteristics blended together. Poured with a nice off white to light tan head and some lace. Color is an attractive medium amber with some copper highlights. Aroma is malty, molasses, a little toffee, and bit of vanilla/caramel. Flavor's about the same. Good body and carbonation. Kind of a sweet finish. A hint of alcohol at the end of the finish. Not bad."
"Medium body, carbonation seems a bit high. Alcohol is well hidden. Pretty easy to drink, this is pretty nice."
"D - Very rich and full bodied...have a feeling that these would start to be on the heavy side after a while. Definitely not a sipper, but far from a session beer for me too. Alcohol is pretty normal at 5.9%, so my mind says I could probably get away with having a few without regretting it, but my palate says this is stronger. Not in a bad way, just doesn't feel like I could have too many of these. Very enjoyable beer overall, and I'd say one of my favorite winter warmers."
"D. Very drinkable. Goes down very easy, and is full of flavor. Nice hop flavor balance with the malt. Great Winter Seasonal."
"The body is a light brown with a reddish hue. It has a nice color. The head was thick and frothy with a great lace that just sticks to the side of the glass. The aroma is dominated by citrus and spice. I am not sure if that comes from orange peel or hops. The mouth feel is carbonated but not overwhelming. The flavor is fruity and spicy. It was a little more balanced on tap than it was in the bottle. I am going with the sample I had tap or it would have had a lower rating. Overall not bad."
"Prickly, a bit overcarbonated. Average ale mouth, I could drink quite a lot of this particular seasonal."
"Poured into a pint glass cloudy orange with a thick foamy head. Good lacing. Smells of fresh hops. But the taste isn't really all that great. There is a slight hop bite up front, but there is a weird taste after that that leads to a unflattery after taste. The mouthfeel is good, however I'd rather have a little more warmth from alcohol for this style."
"Tropical fruit and holiday spices on the front of the palate, with pineapple, pear, and peach (a venerable fruit cocktail!). Hops come in with authority towards the finish, adding a spicy bitterness that balances nicely with toasted caramel and pale malts. Body is slightly over-carbonated, and although the medium thickness fits the style well, Nutcracker dries out a bit too much on the end. Still, this is a very tasty, very hoppy Holiday ale. I probably wouldn't have picked it up had it not been on sale at Specs this week ($7.99 a sixer!), but even at full price I would have been glad I did. Nice job, Boulevard."
"At $6.49 a sixer I could not pass this up especially given the brewery. nice dark orange color, decent white head, suspended yeast particles throughout. Smells like hops at first, almost minty but maybe I'm imagining things, then its a more caramel smell, nice. The taste is more of the same and is a little different than what I would expect from the style. This seems like a well hopped pale ale with a nice caramel maltiness, I wonder if they used spices. Good stuff."
"Very tasty and drinkable beer."
"Brown body, less than a finger of off-white head, quick disappation, minimal lacing. Dry bready nose with no hops present. Sweet taste up front with a bit of spice (nutmeg, cinnamon). Hops more prominent on the back end. Not much carbonation, but a pretty smooth mouthfeel. Taste a bit more complex when warm, why are they chilling the glasses? Very drinkable, need a bit of warming before serving. A nice winter warmer."
"D: Pretty darn drinkable for a winter warmer. Not as sweet or malty as I expected, but I found it to be an enjoyable change of pace."
"Poured a hazy dark red-orange to brown with a medium tan head with good clingy lacing. Smell is malty sweet with some vanilla-molasses and spicy hop cinamon ginger in the background. I like the taste better than most spiced winter warmers. It has a nice balanced sweet malty molasses caramel body with a fair amount of bitter citrusy hops in the finish. The cinamon, ginger, nutmeg orange come out at the end. I am going to stop trying to make myself like spiced beer. It's not happening for me. Anyway as this style goes, I think this is most drinkable one I have come across. Not bad."
"D: High. I'd have another and buy another sixer. Good holiday beer that avoids being overly spicy and achieves uniqueness with wet-hopping."
"D: A nicely done beer. Unfortunately, it doesn't strike me as all that special. More of a regular APA than a traditional Winter Warmer. Boulevard has done better work."
"D: Boulevard's seasonal beers continue to shine for me. This is a very season appropriate beer that is very enjoyable to drink. Very Christmasy. For any unrefined characteristics it may have, the beer endears itself well to me. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
"A little thin-bodied--this beer's only flaw."
"Good hoppy bitter balanced warmer. I like my winter beers with a little more hops than most have, this was a pleasant surprise. Def worth a try."
"Full flavored with plenty of interesting complexity. This warmer is a winner."
"This is a pretty good beer, I think it would be better as an all year around beer though. Not much of a winter warmer, reminds me more of a Pale Ale. Aromas of hops, and fruity sweatness after the pour. Taste of sweat malt and fruit well balanced with a fresh hops on the finish and slighty bitter bite. I bought a sixer, doubt I will buy anymore."
"The piney hops really capture the essence of Christmas. Not your typical malt-heavy winter warmer here. The overload of carbonation is something new to this year's batch and detracts from the mouthfeel a bit. Otherwise, this is nice beer that is more like a pale ale or hoppy amber than it is a winter warmer."
"Great drinkability.. the fruity essence really shows as it warms.. Nothing like the spiced monsters we're used to."
"Appearance is a hazy red, clouds of pearlish brown slide throughout. Smell is a little bit tinny, but just a touch. Mostly it smells a little like toffee, but more like a pale ale than a winter warmer. It's not straight ahead spicy on smell or taste ... which gives it sort of a dual personality. The first 2 I had from the sixer tasted more like an IPA to me but the last few have been a little bit more spicy tasting. Mouth feel is surprisingly full, and I think that's the best part of the beer. Despite the heavy feel, it's fairly drinkable, but it should be noted that it seems like type of beer that's probably going to dehydrate you."
"2009 Version is WAY different form prior years. Much more hoppy! More like an IPA/PA this year than the malty sweetness than I'm used too. Much more carbonation than prior years. Can you tell yet that I like the Nutcracker of the past. This years batch is good, but not what I'm used too!. Almost SN celebration copy! Miss the old Nutcracker!"
"D: Pretty good. Who says you can't drink a winter warmer on an August Florida evening."
"d- i'm new to the style, but i think a few of these would go down easy on a cold night."
"M + D: Sparkling, assertive carbonation without beiing stinging. Robust flavour without a big alcohol booziness. That all translates to some good minus the negative points, which makes for a pretty decent beer experience to me!"
"This one was pretty good and would be nice to grab a case around the holiday season if this was local."
"The aroma is sweet and malty with caramel, light citrus hops, and cardboard. The appearance is amber with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma. The palate is smooth. Overall a pretty typical English style ale. I would drink this again but it's nothing special."
"Taste is lighter in body than expected form the nose and the spice is rather prominent on the finish. Decent carbonation and with more bitterness/chalkiness on the close than anticipated. No notable alcohol on the nose or tongue however. A decent winter brew yet not overwhelming, but worth a try."
"Drinkability - The combination of attributes above make this a very good beer that goes down really easy. I already had 2 and could easily have one more."
"D: I enjoyed drinking this one, much more than I expected that I would. The spice profile doesn't favor one flavor or another."
"D: Pretty good, grows on me after some initial doubt. Good taste and very appealing aroma; wouldn't mind having this again next winter...would seek it out."
"i was expecting this one to be a bit heavier, but none-the less it's a pretty available beer thats got a lot goin for it, i could easily sit and sip these all night"
"D - Very drinkable, although I only drank a couple, it seemed to really do it for me for having such a low ABV. I would definitely purchase this again."
"Forgot I'd reviewed this one already. Like it a bit better this go around around, bumping up the drinkability from 3.5 - 4.0 and the appearance from 3.0 to 3.5, just because I feel it warrants a higher score. So from 3.3 to 3.45 overall. Seems more spicy than my previous take. A gentle little Winter Toaster, and agreeable."
"Could drink a few of these, not a bad brew."
"Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours a red copper color with a half finger of head. smell is like caramel and spices. Taste is mostly biscuitlike malts with hints of cinnamon and spice. medium bodied slightly dry mouthfeel. I could put away four or five of these on a cold winter night. Another Quality beer from Boulevard."
"D - Full flavor and good body. Not too high alcohol level. I could drink a few of these in one night. Interesting and unique flavor for a winter warmer. Quite enjoyable."
"One of those beers where the taste matches the nose well. Piney hop flavor and bitterness with toasty sweet malts. A bit thin bodied and falls on the lighter side of christmas ales, but maintains plenty of flavor and has a creamy feel to it. Actually is pretty refreshing when thirsty. Would easily be able to tear up a sixer of this in an evening, a throw-down holiday ale, if you will. Well done, another good beer from the folks in KC."
"A decent winter warmer with a hint of hop. I enjoyed it and would buy again for the winter months."
"As with all the beers in my mix-a-six, I picked it up out of curiosity. Worth trying once. Good, but not great. I may be inclined to try this on tap, but I'm not sure that I would buy a sixer of the stuff. A very drinkable beer, for sure, but somehow not what I expected."
"Brewing flaws are apparent in this one. I won't be trying it again."
"Not a bad drinking beer, just not what I would think of as a holiday winter warmer."
"I have to say that I really question the classification of this as a Winter Warmer. It sure seemed a heckuva lot closer to being something like an Octoberfest. Orangeredbrown; a bit of spicy clove and pepper offset with a sticky, malty sweetness. Not a bad beer - but what exactly were they going for, here?"
"Purchased: South Bay Drugs, Imperial Beach CA"
"It's not bad, but I was expecting better. Maybe I've been blessed with much better winter seasonal's this year so they outshine this one. Not bad, just nothing to write home about."
"The category is fairly wide open, and this resides in the lighter, more drinkable realm. I really enjoy the interplay of the doughy, sweet gingerbready malt, and the more fragrant orange-peel hopping. I could go for a bit more gumption and girth, but this rounds out as a solid winter-themed sessioner."
"D-It's an ok beer. Not great, and its malt presence seemed a bit lacking, but I enjoyed it nonetheless."
"D - Very drinkable beer. Not too hoppy."
"Pulled a bottle out of a variety case. Poured a dark ruby red with an off-white head. This beer reminds me of a hoppy version of Sam Smith's Winter Welcome on a basic malt level. This is both good and bad, while the flavoris very smooth, the caramel malts aren't terribly rich. This beer relies more on the pleasant mix of citrus hops flavors that make this similar to Rogue's Santa's Reserve, or a hoppy red ale. Worth a try for non-spiced winter warmer."
"Overall, this is a really great winter beer and easy to drink. I'd recommend this for a nice session beer."
"D: A good winter warmer--easy to drink with still a good amount of taste."
"Notes from 12/7/07"
"D: A nice beer, but the ""warming"" quality isn't where I thought it would be. Definitely a nice place to start the evening and I think I could get warm after putting a few of these away."
"This beer was tremendous. The deep amber color with a minimal head was very pleasing. The smell was of nuts, maybe spice and maybe a little fruity. Nothing too powerful. The taste was smooth with a very complex character: first was a slight nutty taste, then spices such as cinnamon, maybe nutmeg. The alcohol was there but was very subtle. Mouthfeel was good, but perhaps a little thin. Overall and excellent brew."
"This is a nice winter warmer. Something to bring to a Christmas party that will be a hit with the non beer geeks."
"Overall I would recommend this beer to any beer enthusiast looking for a good winter beer. That and I love the fact that it is brewed less then 2 hours from my hometown and I regularly make trips to Kansas City for football, baseball, and concerts."
"This is a tasty beer with a lot of flavor. I could see myself making a six-pack last all winter, though. This wouldn't be my choice to session or anything."
"Id drink this again."
"I would say it has good drinkablity to it."
"D - I like this more than in years past. Maybe I just didn't appreciate it before, others have said its a bit different than before. Don't care, I like it this year. Can't have more than a couple though, the lingering sweetness gets to be a bit much. Hard to stop at one, hard to keep going after two. I'll be buying another sixer of this one, this year."
"i would enjoy drinking up to three bottles of this delicious beer, but any more would be a sugar overload."
"Overall, lighter then I expected but still ahead of the curve. I think if you are a fan of Octoberfest esque beers you might enjoy this one."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer reminds me more of a filtered English barleywine then a winter warmer. It pours a clear, orangey amber with a nice 2 finger head that faded away into just a slight rim around the glass, leaving the edges as clean as they were before I poured the beer in. The aroma is surprisingly hoppy with orange and grapefruit coming through followed by cinnamon, and what reminds me of roasted barley. The flavor is reminiscent of the aroma, but the malt plays a much larger role in the all around finish of the beer. A rich maltiness overshadows the hops so prevalent in the nose. Prunes, dates and other dark fruits pop up in the flavor profile, pushing the grapefruit to play second fiddle. The mouthfeel is a bit light for a winter warmer but doesn't really take away from the beer. This is one of the better seasonals that Boulevard puts out, and is something that I always look forward to each Christmas time."
"This pours a dirty brown with some reddish copper highlights,the head is tan and tall. The nose smells of lightly roasted malts and spice,maybe some cinnamon and hints if citrus. This is a nutty warmer and quite complex as well. This has a spicy/tangy bite mid way that is quite enjoyable and last through the finish. Roasted almonds and cashews mix with orange rind and subtle caramel malting to create a most flavorful and unique offering. Medium bodied and prickly carbonation that is not overbearing keeps drinkability above average."
"A good winter warmer. A mixture of an American pale ale hop profile, and a English strong bitter malt character. Could be ever so slightly dryer in my opinion. I could drink all the time in the winter season."
"Drinkability is high. It's tasty, and a nice holiday addition. Glad I bought a 6 pack (I don't usually), because I want to revisit this a couple times this season."
"Winter Warmer seems to pick up a lot of variations. This one is good but I'd rather see the malt featured and maybe more alcohol. This has a lot of hops for this style."
"Amber color with orange highlights, slightly hazy, and a nice off white head. Lacing is good. Slightly piney aroma and some sweet malts. A citrus fruit flavor in here, plenty of orange and grapefruit, nice use of hops, piney, some spiciness, and some sweet caramel flavors. Very nicely balanced between the sweet and bitter. Creamy mouthfeel with average carbonation. A very nice beer and probably one of my favorite non-Smokestack Boulevard beers."
"Sweeter and milder than expected. Quite drinkable and worth trying for sure."
"Pours a dark amber almost brown colour. Big white head with ok retention and ok lace. Smell is very fruity and bready. Flavour starts hop foward with a bit of citrus and then gets some malt sweetness in the middle. Finishes with a little yeasty fruitiness and a nice bitterness. Body is quite full, with a lower carbonation level. A nice beer. It comes across to me a bit like a hopped up Bobs 47."
"Not a favorite of mine. I tried this on two different days to see if my tastebuds were off. Tasted the same. I just did not like the hop and spice combination."
"Pours out a deep russet amber color, no head, a few oily bubbles at first but just a slick surface after that. Smells strongly of spice and sweet malts, tastes the same, but more complexity comes out as it warms. A little over carbonated for my tastes, overall a highly drinkable beer, I will finish off this 5 pack today, gotta love Saturdays."
"D-Every winter from this point on and i may backstock some!"
"The drinkability is better then most for the style. Prosit, MK"
"Dark, cloudy brown with a decent tan head, nice duration with some lacing. The aromas are nice but subtle, roasted chocolate and some coffee. Fine, toffee-like taste that, with the chocolate malt, make this a fairly full-bodied warmer, with a slight hint of mint. Creamy with a touch of bitterness, this is rather good, a fine warmer and solid offering from Boulevard."
"Pours a rich cloudy muddy brown color with a beige lasting head. Sweet caramel and chocolatey toffee malt with a big hit of piney hops. Medium to light bodied with slightly too much carbonation that made it fizzy and foamy in the mouth. Hoppy and piney fresh taste along with rich, toasty malt. Good overall."
"D : Easy Christmas beer to drink"
"Finally finishing off some of the last of my winter brews. This highly carbonated reddish-brown brew is topped off by a fully realized two-finger tan head that peeps over the rim threatening to overflow and finally settling in it's own good time. Sweet malts hit the nose and are checked quickly by the hop and spice aromas. Tastes a bit of spice and pine up front with an earthy tone toward the end. Hops are a bit understated compared to a malt essence that creeps around the edges of the palate. A slight hint of yeast peeks through. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, and it goes down smooth. Not as spicy as some winter warmers I've had lately, but damn good drinking nonetheless. Would actually be a good year-round' beer to be enjoyed almost anytime."
"D: incredibly drinkable, esspecially in the cold weather. should be served around 45 to 55 degrees"
"Overall, a nice beer but not one I would go much out of my way to try again."
"This beer pours a murky, muddy brown color. It looks like marsh water. The head is two inches in height, fluffy, and light tan in color. It recedes slowly into thick lacing. The aroma is of caramel nuts, and citrus hops. It smells like a cross between a nutty brown ale, and a centennial IPA. The taste is a little maltier than the aroma, but the hops show themselves in a lasting bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. The carbonation seems to get it the way of the flavor. Overall, this is a good beer. I will certainly drink this again."
"2007 edition. this is much better than I remembered."
"!"
"Nice job, Boulevard."
"This is a nice beer for the winter months and I have noticed it seems to be more enjoyable with friends."
"Drinks pretty easy for the abv, let this warm up a bit. Great to session on"
"Note: They also make an even better dry hopped version of this available only at the brewery on tours or at special tastings."
"Got this beer out of a sampler pack. Overall this beer was more hoppy than most winter warmers I have had. But it poured an amber color and was very enjoyable. I just found these beers available in this area, so I hope to get more in the near future."
"2012: This always seems to be on draft at Northwoods Lodge in Springfield, usually hits the spot and is relatively fresh."
"A good beer for winter drinking."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date into a pint glass. It was a deep ruby color. It had a 2 finger head that settled into a broken film. No carb and light lacing. The aroma was sweet malt, fruity with a touch of spice. The taste was pretty good. It was malty with a nice spice undertone that kept it interesting. I find most Winter Warmers to be dominated by alcohol but it's really not present in this one which makes it enjoyable. Overall, it's a good WW and I could see me having another if I could ""borrow"" from a friend or get as part or a sampler again. Mild recommend. (Rare buy or steal)"
"Pours a dark amber with a two finger dark white head that dies down to a thin layer of bubbels. Definitely leaves its mark with a very nice webbing left behind. Smell is very balanced between a light caramel malt with a fresh citrus zest, almost ESB like. Some floral aromas emerge as well in the nose. Taste is light toffee, sweet hazelnut, and spicey nut. Subtle cinnamon flavors throughout that lead to a similar aftertaste. Medium body with a full carbonation. Very good fit in the holiday seasonal beer category, glad I had the opportunity. Thanks Tim!"
"This is a well crafted brew. It has a nice balance of ingredients, with the malts taking the lead, thus making it very well fitted into the style. Another very solid offering from, in my opinion, an underrated brewery. Would certainly welcome another."
"Pours a deep reddish-brown color with a massive tan head with terrific retention. Sheets of lacing line the wide mouth glass - a beautiful beer. The nose is slightly candy sweet with hints of floral and herbal hops at the fore. The spicy notes really bring the Holidays to mind. This probably how a winter warmer is supposed to smell. The palate is wonderfully complex - a barrage of hops upfront, but quickly balanced out by a nice subtle sweet malt character that lends a great warm caramel and nut aspect to the beer. This beer is masterfully balanced - not a hop bomb or sweet to the point of cloying. The flavors play off of each other in a very nice way, leaving a complex yet accessible flavor profile. The mouth feel is very smooth, especially as the beer warms to near ambient temperature (probably the best serving temperature for this beer). A full-flavored and bodied beer, but not overly thick. I'd say this one is medium in mouth feel and really quite luxurious. The finish is dry with lingering herbal hops on the tongue. Probably one of the more 'drinkable' winter warmers I've sampled this season, and without a doubt one of the best as well. Very complex, yet not overbearing, flavors and an extremely well-crafted mouth feel - I have no reservations in recommending this beer to both the lover of the style and the drinker who is imbibing in a winter warmer for the very first time - substantial yet accessible. Very, very nice. Congratulations Boulevard - this may be your best so far, in my book."
"Into a 12-oz mug, this is a very cloudy reddish-amber beer with a very small head. Nice aroma though, fruity with a soft, sweet maltiness and resinous hop notes. There's a hint of spiciness as well. Taste is not quite as interesting. Caramel malt vies with moderate bitterness. Fruity yeast character remains, but largely I don't find the flavor very interesting. Body is a tad watery."
"Head billows out from my mug at the bar. I see that the color is a hazy copper in my friends glass (my mug is ceramic). Somewhat sweet, but not of the good variety, in the nose. Good malt to hop balance mingled with usual Christmas spices (ginger, cinnamon, maybe some orange). Light mouthfeel followed by a short lived aftertaste. Not the best for the style."
"d: A hoppy winter warmer with nice caramel malt for balance, this is a great winter seasonal. I always look forward to this, its a good winter warmer that is great for the price. I could easily drink several of these. Another good one from Bully."
"Overall, enjoyable winter warmer. Best served at room temp."
"D-I tried it chilled and at room temp.Chilled it seems to be sweet,room temp seems to be the way to go for this beer.Good winter warmer,I hope to try more from Boulevard when I'm in K.C. over the holidays."
"While the hop-head in me would love to see them bottle some of the dry-hopped Nutcracker that they had at the KC Beer Fest. The regular Nutcracker is a very well-planned and well-made beer. One of my favorite winter warmers and the only one I know of with fresh hops in it."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a pretty ruby-amber color with a huge viscous off-white head. The smell is surprisingly hoppy, with hints of caramel malts. Taste is citrusy like grapefruit, but it also has some caramel and nutty characteristics. The alcohol is slightly noticeable and does have a slight warming effect. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a viscous, creamy head. This is a drinkable beer; the only thing that takes away from it is the slightly noticeable alcohol. This is a different style of winter warmer than I am used to tasting, but it is enjoyable and I would pick it up again."
"Dark fruits come first. Toasted grains with a nutty characteristic. Bitterness stings the tongue. Leafy and spicy hop notes. Light mouthfeel. Carbonation is a bit too much. grassy hop notes come through as it warms. A bit more pleasant when it's colder. I'd pass again."
"D - I would pass on this next time. It's interesting that's for sure....it's just a very odd beer. It's trying to be an IPA, a spiced dark beer, a nut brown, and several other things all at once, and it's not really doing any of them well. It sort of reminds me of SN Celebration Ale, just nowhere near as good."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark amber color, nice carbonation, nice two finger creamy head, lots of nice sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, hops, spices, and caramel. The taste is mostly sweet and malt, with a nice touch of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little winter warmer, this is my first Boulevard brew, not bad at all."
"Nutcracker Ale was a dark amber color and hazy. The thick tan head had good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was sweet malt with some citric hops. The taste was a nice blend of malt and hops. It started a little sweet with plenty of caramel malt flavor, then the hops kick in with a nice balancing bitterness with fruity citrus flavors and a dry finish. It was medium bodied with good carbonation. The drinkability was good. This is definitely one of the better beers from Boulevard and one that I look forward to every winter in my holiday mix-pack."
"This beer poured a red brown color. Kind of like tea. There was no head. The smell on this one was rich and fruity. One of the most fragrant, aromic beers i have ever smelled. The taste is much the same with fruity tones. I really can't describe it. I guess kind of like starfruit. This beer has some woody notes as well. Mouthfeel was dry and enjoyable. Drinkability on this one is very high for me. WHAT A GREAT GREAT BEER!"
"Extremely average across the board. Still drinkable, but very unimpressive compared to other Boulevard beers."
"In poker parlance, Nutcracker Ale is the nuts! It's a fantastic winter warmer from a brewery that has previously impressed me with only two beers, Bully Porter! and Bob's '47 Munich Style Lager. I've never seen it in sixers, only in holiday packs, but I'll have to look harder from now on. Kudos to the boys from Boulevard for this flavorful, incredibly drinkable holiday treat."
"Pours a ruddy brown with good head an nice fluffy lacing. Aroma is spicy, a nutty yeasty very abundant, and some sweet bready malts permeate a pretty decent nose. Taste is also spicy, a nicely carbonated mouth that lends a tactile zest to the slightly woody hopping and while a lovely taste and decent mouth, doesn't really register as a warmer. I'd be interested to see what happens if I sit on one of these for half a year, if it'd mellow out and round off into something a little nicer... we shall see."
"Overall this reminds me of an ""Imperial Nut Brown Ale""...(maybe we should add a category?)...nice winter treat...a lot of winter beers are better, but this would be worth a 6-pack every winter.."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 3/4"" orangey tan head over the very cloudy orangey amber brew. Dense head lasts well, with plentiful sticky lacing. Aroma is peaches with a touch of piney hops. Taste is moderate malts, with a fruitiness in the middle, and a light hoppiness to close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is good esp for a winter warmer. Could do with a little more pop in the flavor area, but at least they didn't overspice."
"D - Way too easy for 6.6. Could just have one or drink with a meal, or a session. Nice. My favorite winter warmer."
"D - This is a pretty good winter treat and a very good offering from Boulevard. I rarely buy a 6 pack, but I did buy 6 of these."
"Drinkability was fine. Despite the simple flavor (and a flavor Im not a huge fan of) it was still a smooth drinker and went down quickly."
"it's just not very interesting. once again boulevard manages to produce craft beer which is boring, a combination which seems to me counter-intuitive. boulevard's beers are well-made and they are certainly part of the overall trend in this country away from macro-lager crap and yet they insist on dumbing it down (with the possible exception of their bully porter), which at least to my mind involves some level of contradiction."
"D - This is a pretty good winter treat and a very good offering from Boulevard."
"Pretty drinkable beer. Overall a very good beer to have around as the weather is cold."
"Note: Somewhat reminded me of a St. Berny's 12 at certain points."
"This is one of my favorite winter warmers I have had. Lots of flavor and complexity, but still very drinkable. Make sure you let this beer warm to a good temperature (I would say close to 50 degrees) before pouring it. I n order to fully appreciate all the complexity, it needs to be warmer than most brews. Nice to see my home state brew such a kick ass winter warmer."
"This is just about a perfect beer for a heavy meal"
"Edit: After a few more samples, I find that the hops and malt are more balanced than what I said in my review so, I've altered my score to reflect that. :^) This is *good* stuff!"
"Thanks, beeryhandy, for the vertical tasting and also to Schmittymack, for the chance to taste the 2009 version within the freshness date (as good as the 2004)"
"Drinkability is decent. The beer is good, but there are other winter warmers I prefer to this one. Overall a pretty good beer from a good brewery."
"EDIT: The Boulevard website lists this as 31 IBU, which is fairly low for a 6.6% beer. I'd love to know what their hop schedule is to get all that Chinook character."
"Pors a murky, dark burgundy with a creamy tan head. I get big piney hops in the nose with a faint malty sweetness. Flavors of sweet malt are followed by a dominant resinous hop presence. WIthout spicing, the piney-ness gives it a good holiday feel. Mouthfeel is moderate to full, with a touch of sweet stickiness and lovely carbonation. Very drinkable. It's refreshing to find Christmas beer's that don't rely on spicing."
"That aside, this was a really interesting beer anda great approach to the winter warmer. It is complex, warming, and festive without being heavy, thick, slick, or overwhelmingly boozy. Not what I'd call ""balanced"" but very enjoyable none the less."
"Appears cloudy nearly opaque amber almost marron hued nice sized caramel tan head leaves fine lacing. Aroma contains a great hop profile christmas tree esque piney character nice doughy malt not overly sweet thank god no holiday spices to kill it finishes a bit citrusy sort of celebration like but unique and it's own. Taste is one great hoppy winter warmer once again thanking the beer gods that some brewers leaves out holiday spices and substitue semi sweet caramel malt profiles with yeasty bread chacter blended with a wallop of pine cone and citrus flavored hops, nicely done. Mouthfeel is medium bodied texture is silky smooth of course carbonation is perfect why mess it up now. Drinkability effortless b/c it's so good yet challenging due to the flavors that one could without a doubt crave."
"I've always enjoyed the Nutcracker from Boulevard. This year's was the best I've tried."
"Good brew. Thanks go out to bditty187 for this one."
"The beer pours a hazy dark amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice hop scent that pretty much overpowers the rest of the malt aroma. It seems to be boasting of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. The taste is good. It has a complex flavor that screams hops, but is blended well with crystal and roasted malts. It goes down easy and finishes bittersweet with some residual malt sugars and a wonderful hop aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very smooth beer. It has excellent hop character and a well rounded malt bill; a good seasonal."
"still, strangely admirable. i recommend you pick up ONE bottle just to see what is see.. experience the funk!"
"Many thanks to Dertbert for providing me the oppurtunity!!"
"Thanks to Hardtarget for sharing this beer."
"I had this last Christmas also, and it was very consistent. Nothing wrong with the beer at all, easy to drink, but nothing outstanding either. A solid above average, but not above a B, maybe B-. Still I'll drink it again in the future."
"Wow just wow. I would have never guessed it, but the best seasonal I've had since fall ended is far and away this beer."
"Drinkability is very solid, really enjoyable. Kind of beer that you can't just have one of. I have not have this brew for several years and much better than earlier versions that I remembered."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable in moderation. A solid winter seasonal beer from one of my favorite breweries. I would not discourage anyone from giving this a try if they have the chance."
"Overall: A decent drink, but not one of my favorites. The more the citrus and bitterness lingers in my mouth the more it makes me want to go get an ESB. Definitely worth the try"
"a nice x-mas/winter offering...the use of the chinook hops are the star of this brew and i'm enjoying it immensely. this is an outstanding beer."
"Aw Jeez! (said like John Travolta). This stuff smells like a friggin' pine tree! It's head remains for quite a respectable amount of time. I'm sure it's being helped along by the wheat included in the malt. It's definitely a red chocolate color. The taste is complex yet understated and you really have to swish it around in your mouth to get the full impression on every part of your toungue. It's absolutely uncanny how much this smells and tastes like a pine tree. It should be tried just for that. It's slightly sweet on the finish and the pine taste does linger. It has quite a bit of body for a beer that is so smooth. A slight smoky flavor surrounds and binds the whole experience which is welcomed. A warming sensation becomes apparent and this beer has thus fullfilled it's destiny."
"Aroma of piney Chinook hops, vinous oak barrel, caramel and biscuit malts. Similar flavors with dark fruit and just preceptable diacetyl upping the complexity. Full body that made the mouthfeel a dextrinous treat to hold on to before swallowing. Finishes toasty and sweet then the drying hops as an aftertaste. Almost an English style strong ale. This is what I was hoping for when I picked up the Christmas Ale from GLBC. Sometime all you are looking for is close to home. Score a big sucess for Boulevard B.C. to go along with their outstanding Bully Porter and Saison."
"The taste, if anything, is more definitely grapefruit and pine over a nice caramel malt base. Hints of apple as well as plum. Lingering spicy finish and aftertaste."
"from the bottle. I shared this with bieristgut. poured a mahogany with light tan head. aroma, sour grapes, honey, malts apples the sour kind, grapefruit, molasses. flavor caramel, musty,wheat, malts and just a hint of alcohol. a little weak but not to bad."
"Whoa, lot more ummph than the regular Boulevard Pale Ale - much darker pour, a hazy dark amber with great head ! Didnt have a lot of aroma, but left laces all the way down the pint glass. This winter warmer had a nice, woody, spicy taste that finished with a hoppy kick. Nice tingle in the mouth and smooth going down. Will look forward to next years Boulevard batch."
"The taste, as usual, was the best part. The sip starts off with a bit of malty sweetness with a well blanced hop character in the finish. This doesn't quite have as big of a kick as many winter warmers I've had in the past, but I could taste the alcohol in the finish, so I could tell it was doing its job. I will definately drink more of this next year."
"Pours a murky amber and has a thick tan head. It has a spicy hop nose and the spicy character comes through in the flavor and covers up the alcohol very well. It is not too complex at all. Very straight forward in it's flavor. This is a really good winter warmer... I will be revisiting this bier again next year. Kudos to Boulevard for a very good winter ale."
"Overall Impression: Not my cup of hop tea. No real malt tastes, not much spice to put it in a winter mood. An enjoyable beer, but a bit different. Big props to babydoc who set me up with the generous trade!"
"My second Boulevard, thanks to babydoc. This one pours a muddy brown(unfiltered) body with a 1 cm beige head that disperses some nice patchy lace. Aroma is malty and spicy, with notes of chocolate, caramel, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Some grassy hops are picked up in the background. Very pleasant in the mouth, with an ideal carbonation and tingly body. Taste is quite pleasant, with malty chocolate and caramel maltiness melding with grassy and pine hops, a hint of hazelnut, and some cinnamon and nutmeg. Although I cook with fresh spices, I have been deceived before by noting the definite presence of spices that were actually hops, as may be the case here. This is an excellent winter warmer that is quite well constructed. I wish Boulevard could expand their distribution a bit, so more of us could enjoy their fine brews."
"Pretty nice, one of Boulevards better brews."
"A nice beer overall."
"Poured from a 2004 bottle labled best before 02/01/05. The unfiltered brew pours slightly hazy mahogany, nice curtains of bubbles. Head is one finger slightly-yellow wheat, fading to a veil that lasts until the end. Nose is pleasant but not potent; spicy, flowery. Nice mouthfeel, with moderate carbonation yielding a creamy feel but faily dry finish. The taste is sweet malts and light spices; hops interrupt the sweetness to balance but not overpower it... Despite the ""added"" spices attributed to it by some tasters, the ingredients list only two-row barley malt, whole hops, and yeast. Very nice, not quite as hearty as I'd hoped, but certainly drinkable and one of my Boulevard choices."
"Overall, this is yet another winter warmer that I'll be passing up next year."
"This a great, unheralded holiday brew. The balance of malt and hops is perfect for a winter warmer. The flavor sits on the back of the tongue and rolls forward closing on a hoppy (chinook?) finish. There is a pretty good head and retention. I could drink it all night."
"Whoa. Unlike any Boulevard selection I've had previously. Pours brown with a single finger head. Smells a bit spicey....some nut & chocolate, but perhaps some nutmeg? The big difference between this and normal Boulevard offerings is the mouthfeel and sweet malt. Thicker and sweeter. Medium-heavy mouthfeel and stamina building umph. Nutty and X-mas spice to taste. Plus, lotsa interesting flavors as it warms...licorice, hint of chocolate, nutmeg (clove?), and other holiday spices. The best selection from Boulevard I've tried yet (and I've tried them all repeatedly). Wish they could impart this mouthfeel and malt sweet to their pale ale."
"It has a excellent mainly malty taste, that is very well balanced with great body and is very drinkable. Overall I really enjoyed this one and it really makes me want to try some of boulevard's others."
"A rich mahagony brown body is topped by a fleeting, big-bubbled head. The aroma is very malty, heavy on the nuts, with backup notes of caramel and toast. Theres also a bit of baking spices, maybe cinnamon and nutmeg, but theyre not overpowering. The flavor is richly malty and slightly fruity. Pretty tasty."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark rose amber that is just slightly murky, and with a massive head that settles a bit, but sticks around nicely for some time. The nose is full of floral hops & maybe just a hint of spice. Taste is sweat/bitter hops & just the right amount of malt. Very enjoyable. Mouth feel is spot on, nothing out of place & well balanced all around. One of Boulevards better brews I think."
"Drinkability: My overall impression was that this was not a repeat beer. I had 3 of them so far, but only because I'm out of anything else to drink. I forced the other 3 on company."
"Taste hits in waves: sweetness, then hops, then the warmth of alcohol. Good drinking for the holidays- maybe better than last year."
"This brew is a hazy, murky brown color, with a small tan head resulting from a nice cascading effect. Scent has some spice, maybe some ginger. The main taste that comes through is nuttiness, some spicyness rounding that out. Underlying bitter hops. Not a horrible one, but id turn to some other winter favorites before this one."
"Taste starts with the sweet cookie malt. Spices festively ring in, but arent over the top like they are in some holiday ales. Bitter, yet spicy, hop bite lifts the sweetness into the yeasty finish. Medium plus bodied, with a moderately creamy feel. A very respectable xmas ale."
"Best enjoyed at cellar temperature (not right out of the fridge!), Nutcracker pours a beautiful chestnut body with a reddish cast beneath a short cap of creamy light beige foam. The nose reveals a combination of light spice and delicate spruce or pine wrapped in a caramelish and slightly biscuity malt. It's medium bodied and its median carbonation lends a gentle zest to the tongue. The flavor is slightly richer than the nose suggests, but delivers the same basic profile with hops arriving up front and giving way to it's maltiness towards the finish. Cellaring this beer for a year, however, softens the hop presence and allows the malt to become more dominant."
"Another nice holiday brown ale (see Snow Storm 2003). This works well."
"This one is well worth a try if you can get your hands on it, and I suspect that although this is close to its ""Best"" By Date, a little aging matures this beer no end."
"Taste = Winter ales as a style aren't a common quaff for me but this is a pleasant example. Spicy, malty, tasty, well made. I don't detect a lot of hops. Since I'm an old hophead that left me pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the flavour of this brew. Went well with the roast beef & muenster sandwich and chowder that I had for lunch. Seasonal, but I'll try this one again."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for the trade and for xlperro for arranging the holiday exchange."
"sampled 11/26/03"
"Pours out with a short deep cream-colored head sitting on top of hazy brown liquid. The nose is fruit filled, almost a tropical aroma to it, with a nice underlying sweet malt note. The taste is roasty and chocolatey maltiness, somewhat dry and then a nice bitter hop profile. Nice aftertaste of hop and some peppery alcohol sensation felt in the throat. Finishes with a luxurious smooth semi-dry mouthfeel, very good! Thanks again bditty187."
"Light clouded mahogany in color, medium tannish loose and fluffy head that faded pretty fast, puffy ring around the edge stays present and lace in mixed thickness of globby webs. Aroma is soft and mild of light gingerbread dough spice with a nice little toasted, roasted, woodish background with some moist dirt, earthy herb-like notes. Taste has a nice little spice to it thats light of mint and ginger, cinnamon too. Malts are of toasty bread with just a hint of sweetness coming through at the finish where some lightly mixing herbal hops and spiced cracker-like dryness and woodyness lends a favorable finishing quality. Feel is medium bodied with a little tingle of carbonation that tingles on the tongue lightly in the finish adding to a bit of the dry finish. Took a bit of getting use to and was intregingly fun to drink. A nice brew that I wouldn't mind having around when in the mood, which I had to do, at first I wasn't liking it, but as I went along I found it quite nice with some good subtle characteristics."
"2003 bottle Deep reddish brown cloudy color with a decent off-white head that leaves a good lacing in my glass. Spicy sweet malty aromas, caramel, spicy ginger bread flavors, nice dose of hops. Medium body with a crisp mouthfeel, good carbonation, finishes dry, a great holiday ale."
"I had this out of a bottle on Old CHicago's winter beer tour. Hazy brown color, with a tannish head. Tastes very full of hops and spices. Has a little hint of alcohol, just to let you know it's there (not malt liquor) A nice beer by Boulevard, good for the winter months."
"Pours a murky brown with very little head. Not much lacing either. Smells rather nice. Bready malts, some spiceyness, and a light caramel nuttyness as well. Citrusy hops fade right away to a bready caramel flavor. Spices and fruitiness come in at the end. A little crisp in the mouth, maybe a little less carbonation would smooth it out. Definately a drinkable brew, though not my favorite from Boulevard. I'll probably pick up a sixer of this every year, but that's about it. With the higher abv though, it makes a nice winter warmer."
"A very nice ale to accompany one on colder nights (such as this..br-rr-r-r!) and stave off discomfort!"
"Golden-brown hue with a tan head, creamy, it reached about a 1/2 inch then it faded. The nose is a fine blend of sweet, sugary malt and floral hops the yeast is noticeable. The flavors on the palate are, again, a fine blend of sweet, sugary malt (like candy) with some hops in the background (just a touch of bitterness). A note of citrus can be detected. There doesnt seem to be the internal warming effect that many winter beers have. This is a solid brew."
"Dark coppery brown, seems clearish. Pale tan head of pretty short duration. Dotty lace. A little pine to the malty aroma. Mouthfeel is shy of medium but seems overall creamy due to scant carbonation. Flavor impression strikes as slightly gingerbread malt with a touch of a minty aspect. Finishes with barely discernable hops but a building fruitcake character and a flattish tone. Not a bad beer for the time of year, a little festive, but despite the claim on the bottle, this is a pretty transparent unfiltered brew."
"Reminds me a little of the SnowCap from Pyramid."
"Acquired via trade. 2002 Bottle: Pours a rubicund color appropriate for the season, with a medium thick beige head and nice lacing. Aroma is malty and spicy. Medium-bodied with flavors of malt, cinnamon, licorice and some hops. Finish is nicely spiced with a caramel aftertaste. Well done."
"This was a pretty good brew. Not a huge winter beer like others on the market, but it is by no means a wimp. Nicely balanced."
"Notes. The first sampling in an 8 pack of four different Boulevard beers. Overall, a very drinkable beer, just didn't have that ""winter beer"" warmness."
"Nice winter beer. It tastes like a higher alcohol beer in spite of its lower than expected ABV. It has a homebrewy yeasty nose. nice balance of malty sweetness and hop bitterness. Another solid brew from Boulevard. This is a beer that I'd like to have all year round. But I'll settle for the Christmas season. This beer and Snow Cap make me feel good."
"Thanks bditty187 for the trade so I could review this beer!"
"Slightly hazy dark amber / bronze in hue, covered by a beige head w/ decent retention. The aroma is a combination of piney Chinook and assertive, dark caramel and biscuit malt. Sweet and sprucelike. Mellow diacetyl surfaces as the beer breathes. Flavorwise, the initial moderate hop bitterness fades and allows rich, chewy caramel and biscuit to dominate. Mild dark fruit esters and butterscotch provide some complexity. Caramel malt presence builds from a simpler sweetness into a deeply caramelized, slightly burnt impresion w/ lingers on the palate agreeably. Subdued, but discernibly piney hop flavor. Full in body and quite dextrinous considering its average strength. Finishes toasty and cleanly sweet. Nutcracker is quite a flavorful and rich brew that belies its low apparent strength. I have doubts this is only 5.3% ABV. Flavorwise, it more is akin to a strong ale rather than an American brown. Excellent drinkability. This is the 2002 release."
"Brew was better balanced (hop char - Chinook) when tasted in 2001."
