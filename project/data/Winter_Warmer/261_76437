This almost reminded me of a Green Flash beer but this wasn't as hoppy, although the bitterness here was more present than I expected.

The nose comprises light cardboard, musty pine needle, stale orange peel, and a vague mixture of spices. The taste goes headlong for the orange the spices (which are still to blandly mixed together to pick apart), moves into wetter cardboard and stale biscuit, and finishes in an odd and off-putting bitterness that borders on mintiness. This is just plain bad, folks. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, I think they tried a little too hard with this spiced ale and ended up falling rather short of anything worth drinking. Pure dreck.","TMoney2591","May 21, 2013"

Smells of mineral water, licorice, a bit of brown sugar and a hint of earth. The flavor is really quite bad. Caramel and brown sugar atop a heavy presence of anise or licorice with a metallic earthy almost sulfur flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet tart mouthfeel. I couldn't finish this one it's horrible.","johnnnniee","Dec 09, 2012"

3.8,15.2,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Toasted grain and herbal, woody bitterness up front. Sweetish caramel malt and fruit fill in and take over the palate. Notes of gingerbread and molasses. Mulled wine spices, juniper, ginger, and cloves (?) around the edges. Herbal, woody bitterness shows up again in the finish. Medium body with a slightly syrupy feel. Not bad.","alexgash","Dec 07, 2012"

3.88,17.6,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, crystal clear, hazelnut brown coloring with a thin, sparse, filmy surface coating. Aromas of nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon on a subtle toffee backbone, with some warm cider hints at the end. Lighter on the nose than I was expecting. Flavors are rich and roasted initially, with a tangy toffee malt profile initially, followed by a solid dose of the previously mentioned spices, as well as some peppery hops profiles sprinkled throughout. The liberal spicing definitely provides the warmth in this winter warmer, but without overpowering the brew. Very solid backbone of malt richness to support everything going on on your palate. Tangy and spiced aftertaste that quickly washes away for a clean, slightly tangy finish that lingers longer than the bulk of the aftertaste itself. Smooth and round in mouth, but as it finishes you notice how crisp and clean the brew is. Solid, and at a lower ABV for a warmer, making this easy to quaff.","GarthDanielson","Dec 05, 2012"

3.71,12.4,5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I went with my usual aggro pour which resulted in two-plus fingers of dense tawny head with great retention. Color was a magnificent deep-copper with NE-quality clarity. I once had a girlfriend with natural hair color like that. Nose was spicy and I want to go with (at least) cinnamon and nutmeg. The former was easy to discern, but the latter because of a vanilla-like sweetness that was also present. More than that? Maybe. Probably. But those were the ones that I am willing to mention without being thought a pretentious fool. Mouthfeel was medium and the cinnamon was immediately discernible on the tonue along with something else, not nutmeg, but maybe allspice. Whatever it was, it was highly spiced. The finish, as a result, was bone-dry with the spices lingering well after my swallow. One or two at a sitting might be good, but I would not want a steady diet of this, even on the coldest and longest of winter nights.","woodychandler","Dec 04, 2012"

3.82,15.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured a 1" velvet beige head of medium lifespan. The body is dark burnt umber brown but held to the light it's a very deep amber. It smells of toasted malt and the spices actuall smell savory. Taste mirrors smell and the spices come out with warming ginger as well as piney hops. Fairly long finish. And yes, this beer truly is a warmer.","MoreThanWine","Nov 19, 2012"

4.15,25.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Looking at the previous reviews, I am a little surprised at the Pumple Drumkin analogy. Certainly they are close cousins but having had the PD at the brewery and this one in the bottle, I see a fair enough distinction and I like this one on its own merits as well as the PD. This bottle opens with a lively head, tan in color and a couple fingers thick. It holds pretty well and retreats to an impressive web of lacing. My nose picks up evergreen and allspice and subtle cinnamon and maybe a deeply buried chocolate kiss over oranges and mellow roasted coffee beans. Very pleasant and complex from my experience, perhaps a tad medicinal to some, but i really like this aroma. The flavor is more unified I think, a blend of toasted malts and subtle chocolate coffee grains over evergreen. I guess you might find all the same things that came out in the nose but it seems more subtle here and highly drinkable for a holiday/winter brew.This presents a reputable medium body but a bit more aqueous feel with gentle, tingly carbonation despite it's opening emergence. I think this is a neat seasonal brew that I'm glad I picked up. Another plus hit from the Nantucket crew! Nice.","Durge","Jan 26, 2012"
