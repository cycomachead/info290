"O: Very drinkable. Not overly sweet, bitter, or spicy."
""
""
""
"Overall not a bad beer but the over roasted malts and the bitter spices lead to a not overly pleasant aftertaste.  I am not sure but it seems my taste buds are either evolving or I was overrating the beers of the past."

"I get a subdued chocolate malt and hint of wintergreen and clove, the sorts of spices for wintery baking. Thinly bodied with less medicinal character than what I remember from years past."
""
""
""
"Slightly roasty, balanced with a perfect amount of spices to add to the complexity without overwhelming the experience."
"Very nice xmas ale. Smooth and rich with spices and alcohol warmth."
"What a fantastic beer. I cannot think of a better Christmas beer."

"O: A decent Christmas brew, though as is often the case with this series the spice hamstrings the overall character. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour showcase a mix of spice, piny hops and sweet malt. Rather harsh bitterness on the finish. Good body. Goes down nicely enough, just a shame the harshness isn't more attenuated. Worth sampling if you come across it."
""
"O- a decent drink but the alcohol and cherry don't mesh too well in this one.  A nice beer to have in a bar though."
""
""
"An interesting beer, and if you haven't tried a few years of these Christmas Beers, they're a must, historically speaking. But that doesn't mean they're all that drinkable. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Fog Hill Market in San Francisco."

"Pours a clear medium brown with garnet highlights when held to the light, producing 2+ fingers of beige, somewhat lasting, frothy head that leaves a half inch wash of pasty lace above the surface collar. Aroma is caramel & dark bready malt, with spice notes of cinnamon, ginger & maybe (?) nutmeg; hints of cherry, prune, roasted nuts & a faint sourness. Taste is dark malt bready & spice heavy to cinnamon & ginger with sweet caramel, dark tart cherry & prune/plums, finishes with orange & herbal hops producing an earthy note giving way to a caramel, spice & lightly roasted, bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, tongue coating & slightly wet fronted but rapidly drying after mid-sip, light pepper prickle."

"Always a holiday fave.  Look for it before it's gone!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed the spice-malt play, and found this to be surprisingly drinkable, given the robust flavors of mulling spices and a firm caramel base.  A good choice for a holiday evening."
""
"not a big fan of christmas spices"
""
""
""
"I find that the malt flavors balance out the spice and pine to yield a very drinkable beer with plenty of complexity."
""
"Odd taste at first but overall good Carmel taste"
"Has a very strong winter ale spice to it. Good if that's what you like."
""
"O: Not what I was expecting, in a bad way. Flavor and mouthful just weren't right. 5.5% seems a bit low for the style as well."

"3.53/5: Not my thing, but still a quality brew"
""
""
""
"Overall:   While I could drink this, I did not care for it.  I do not care for this style of beer."
""
""
""
"Prost!"
""
"O: disappointing."
""
""
""

"Nice pour from bottle to Stone Imperial Porter tulip glass. Dark maple syrup color body with a good taupe 1 and a half inch of bubbly (not over thick head). Smells of allspice and caramel. Tastes like it too.  Very drinkable and could easily sit down for 2 of these in a row."

"I could swear I really enjoyed Anchor’s Christmas brew a few years back, but I’m starting to wonder if my tastes have simply changed.  This isn’t at all like what I recall."
""
""
""
""
"O - Superb, and much better than the 2013 version (which I remember tasting like I had drank a juniper bush). A near perfect example of the style taste wise. Very similar to Sam Adams Old Fezziwig, but it's available in six-packs! Will drink again."
"For some reason when I picked up a 6 pack of Anchor at the ungodly price of $13.99 I assumed the Anchor Christmas Ale was a barleywine or other strong dark type beer.  Well, obviously I was thinking of a different annual wintertime beer.  This one pours very dark brown in my chalice and has a wicked, funky, fruity aroma.  I'm getting candied prunes, cinnamon, ginger, and some fruits and spices that remind me of rich fruitcake but I'm embarrassed to admit I can't identify.  Scores bonus points on smell simply on account of intrigue.  Very creamy mouthfeel (temperature is off-cool).  Flavor matches the aroma, really, this is like drinking a fruitcake.  I suppose that's a very reasonable match for the Winter Warmer genre.  Finish is not at all dry, neither unpleasant nor sweet, but not dry either.  Just un-crisp.  Overall, I'm very happy to have tried and consumed this.  But I'm not sure that enjoyment is enough to justify the other 5 bottles I purchased."

"My grandfather has been getting a case of these beers since 1975, at first he just drank them, then in 1983 started saving a few each year and let them sit. After a couple of years he'll open one, the oldest I've had being 15 years. I have to say, aging does wonders. It really mellows out the flavor and makes for an extremely good Christmas brew. My opinion, age the beer and you'll get something totally different, but very good."
"Overall: A winter seasonal classic; spice blend evokes Christmas trees instead of sweet gingerbread."
"Meh. I get some licorice/anise and some dark fruits. I don't like this beer."
""
"A good year for Anchor. Nice malt and spice without being overwhelming or cloyingly sweet. Appearance of a brown ale but roasting used with a light hand."
""
"Better than in recent years.  Not a malty mess.  Some spice; nutmeg and cinnamon.  It still could be better but given recent years a huge improvement."
""
"Decent to pretty good winter warmer andits  always worth savoring at least one every winter"
""
"Not what I expected from anchor"
""
""
"Not what I like alot"
""
""
""
"Deep rich brown color with two fingers of tan that stands up nicely.  Caramel toasty malt on the nose with just a hit of unidentifiable spice.  Taste is toffee, caramel malt flavors with nicely balanced spice that reminded me of nutmeg, star anise, cinnamon and grains of paradise.  What spices are in the brew are so nicely integrated that none dominate creating a harmonious spice finish."

"Overall: A pretty solid winter brew. Nice toasty malt notes and spice."
"This beer was great this year.  A perfect balance between a chocolatey malt and a citus hoppy flavor."
"Light gingerbread and spice smell but I am getting a very wet taste and a weak body and mouthfeel.  Maybe it's just an off year."
"A bit of an overpowering spice character to this, otherwise I find it to be quite and agreeable and complex Xmas ale, quite satisfying. Worth seeking out."
"O - The 2014 version tastes and smells better than I remember the past few years. I It is becoming a yearly tradition for me. Happy Christmas!"
""
""
"Overall: Not bad, but far from my favorite ""christmas"" beer."
"Nicely spiced. A little heavy for me but not alcohol high at 5.5"
""
""
"perhaps my tastes are changing, not my favorite year but I wont have problems taking down this giant bottle solo"
""
""
""
""
"Dark in color with a very good head. Tasted. Very good seasonal beer that goes down easy with a fairly strong after taste"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Definitely a solid Christmas beer, but just a  little too much pine and spice.  Still, when a picking a christmas beer you can't go wrong with this."
""
"not a great flavor. spices were too much to handle"
""

"Conclusion: From reading Patrick Dawson's book, this appears to be a beer that truly improves after 1-3 years of aging. I bought my first 6 pack for that reason, but wanted to try a fresh bottle as a reference. I really like this beer as it is, and am glad I drank it above fridge temp. This will become yet another yearly winter seasonal that I ""must have"". Winter is my favorite season for beer, and the list of must have seasonals is getting long!"
"Solid holiday brew from the company that turned me on to real beer!  Merry Christmas!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Not great as it should"
""
""
""
""
"After that, it went downhill.  The flavor profile is uneven and there is nothing extraordinary here beyond a nice (but basic) malty, bready ale."
"Overall this years version of Our Special Ale is, as usual, a solid, well made beer that I think I’ll try and find a few more bottles of to share with some friends during the remaining holiday season parties. (It might even be tasty to non-beer drinkers.)"
""
""
"Still a nice seasonal tradition with a good drinkable presentation."
""
"Underrated. Nice, subtle christmas spruce flavor layered on top of that iconic steam profile of Anchor's. A great, gentle holiday beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Look forward to this beer every year, but it seems a bit subdued and slightly weaker this time around.  Otherwise pretty fine."
""
""
"Awesome all over. Great holiday beer"
""
""
""

""

"Overall, it's very lacking for a winter warmer.  Without the ginger, it's just another year 'round beer.  With the ginger, it's a disappointing winter beer."
"Not heavy or cloying like a lot of winter warmers - nice, light spicy fruitcake/dried fruit flavors happening here. Not one I need a whole lot of but I'm happy I gave it a shot after 2013's roasty-molasses ale."
""
""
"Overall: Easy drinking, flavorful although not overly complex."
""
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of the style, I started to loose a little hope because of the aroma, but when I got to the taste it turned out to be much more balanced and the spices were bolder, but not overpowering.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, a little crisp, fairly creamy, not too filling and the taste did a nice job of holding my attention, I wouldn't mind drinking a couple of these around the holidays.  What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance and mouthfeel, they were both good and i thought the balance in the taste and the mouthfeel were the highlights of this beer.  What I liked the least about this beer was aroma, it wasn't bad, it was just unbalanced and a little boring.  I would buy this beer again, I wouldn't mind getting another bottle or two before they are all gone and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a balanced Winter Warmer, I think it fits the style nicely.  All in all I thought this was a solid Winter Warmer, it didn't really impress more or anything, but it did live up to being a nice Winter Warmer.  It's not my favorite Anchor beer and I would say it's above average for the style.  Nice job guys, this was a solid beer, keep up the hard work."
""
"Overall I think this is a good example of the style. The beer is not as heavy as I would prefer for the style. I would prefer a higher ABV winter warmer style ale, but if you want a sessionable rendition, this might work for you. Spices are often thrown around for holiday beers and it just doesn't work. This beer breaks the mold and lets them really shine. I think this year's celebration was better than the 2013."
""
""
"Incredible. I loved this beer."
"A seasonal favorite. Pours an almost impenetrably dark red. Thick head. Medium-heavy bodied. Somewhat slippery mouthfeel. Spices not overdone."
"Why won't it allow me to just give a rating?"
""
""
"They seem to get better year after year."

"Cola colored deep brown with a khaki colored head that stays around a bit and leaves some spotty lacing down the glass.  Aromas of holiday spice, burnt crust, earth and toffee.  Taste brings holiday spices up front, with toffee and burnt caramel hit mid palate, the spice fades and gives way to a burnt toast like flavor with some mild hop presence on the finish.  The taste leaves an odd aftertaste of char and mushroom, I think, that I don't care for.  Top end of thin body, sharp carbonation and a semi dry finish.  Overall this is a beer I try a couple of each year, but this years version had me asking myself why."
"A finger's of of crisp slightly lopsided partially fizzy dark khaki colored froth...  Modest retention gives way to a full inviting lacing with a moderate collar...  The color is a mix of deep ruby red and dark color...  A light to moderate bit of quick paced carbonation streaks can be seen towards the top of the glass...  A spot on aroma for the style...  Light holiday space...  Caramel...  Toffee...  Rich bready malt...  The flavor profile isn't quite what I expected...  Much of the malty goodness disappears and is replaced by a sturdy but unremarkable profile...  Some light piney notes...  Lots of earthy and woody notes...  Some faint medicinal notes...  Slightly smokey as well...  In interesting  mix of flavors, but not quite sure they work well together...  On the lighter side of medium bodied...  Slightly chalky texture...  Light yet crisp carbonation...  I'm a huge fan of this annual offering, but this one misses the mark for me...  I've had the majority of these offerings since becoming a BA some ten years ago and unfortunately, this may be one of, if not, my least favorite...  But all that said, it's still a drinkable beer and still fits the season nicely..."

"Pours a deep mahogany with a nice tightly formed off white khaki colored head atop.Some interesting complexities in the nose,cinnamon and nutmeg standout with some almost tart fruitiness detected as well.A little thine low carbonation in the feel.Kind of a hodge podge of different flavors vanilla/graham cracker with cinnamon spice,then that lightly tart fruitiness comes into play late.Alot going on here,maybe a little unorganized but a different take on the beer this year."
"Pours a deep clear chestnut with a light tan head. The head holds on for quite a while and leaves fine sticky lacing. The aroma is interesting, with maybe all-spice or mace and some dark roasted malt. The taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, good, unique. The body is lighter but has a nice silky quality to it."

"While not a session beer, this was weak enough in alcohol and taste that I could have easily had another in a sitting. Since I've had so many of these, I'll continue to buy this year after year but I hope that this goes back to a more traditional recipe next year. The 2014 take on this was too thin in the mouthfeel and lacking in the tree bark and natural tone that made this such a winner in the past. Hopefully, it's just an aberration."

"RJT"
"O: this was tough for me; the harshness was a little overwhelming;"
""
"All those toasted, spicy and woody flavors trend rich with tannin, pepper and spice as their aromatic and flavor value recede and the tactile palate receives the bitterness, mild astringency and simmering warmth from alcohol in a most rustic and charming of ways."
""
""
""
""
"Nice dark malt with hints of Winter spices."
""

"solid Christmas beer. not over powering spices but very drinkable. Not my favorite recipe but that's the price you pay for a different recipe every year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown color, very nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, lots of stick lacing to follow. The nose is malty, slightly spicy, toffee, and caramel. The taste is very nice, malty, slightly sweet, a good dose of toffee/caramel. Medium body. Overall a nice brew, would buy again, but it does not remind me of the early vintages."
""
"Spiced brown ale. Real easy going."
""
""
""
"Thin body with a lower carbonation level. I detect fresh cream, milk chocolate and ginger on the tongue. The aftertaste has the aforementioned nutmeg along with something I'd describe as unsweetened cola. Not as complex as past year's offerings."
""
""
""
""
"For all those who scored this a 3, I would like a recommendation on another to try.  I found the Anchor to provide the warmth of a malty wintery ale but with light spices and hoppiness to smooth the bitter notes.  I'm only bummed my local shop sells sixers for 12.99 and 1/6 barrels north of 120."
""

""

"Disappointed by this beer. Had a great aroma to start with, cardamom and clove to kick things off. Not nearly enough malt sweetness for a winter warmer, bitter fruit and burnt malt flavorings were off putting. Mouthfeel wasn't that appealing either, slightly too dry perhaps from the carbonation but astringent in an unappealing way. Glad I bought a single bottle to give this Anchor offering a ride."
""
""
""
"Very flavorful this year. Nice holiday spice, good amount of caramel malt but still nicely hopped."
""
""
""
""
". Pours dark red-brown clour, with a small off white head that disappears soon leaving some lace. Smell of  chocolate and spices, nutmeg, vanilla. Soft palate,  taste of chocolate and spices, nutmeg, vanilla, cherries, cardamom or clove, and maybe allspices."
"I wish I liked Anchor Beer more."

"A fine yet somehow uninspiring spiced red ale. Malty and yeasty front nose, burnt gingerbread, nutmeg, orange peel back. Medium bodied, slightly flat. Pronounced alcohol warmth. Enjoyable sitting by the crackling fire. Two was slightly more than enough."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Still a totally reasonable option for the Thanksgiving table."
""
""
""
""
"O-  Overall,  very enjoyable.  Buy some before it's all gone."

"3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5/3"
""
""
"Pretty typical special ale.  The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but I get the proto-typical clove, ginger bread, and holly on the nose and palate, on a brown ale frame.  While nothing extraordinary, this is a tasty Christmas ale, with a nice amount of spice.  Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, and so drinkability is pretty good.  Enjoyed this as always, but one was really enough for me."
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm not laying this down too similar to the notes of the 2013 I recently had and it didn't seem to benefit from aging much at all."
""
""
"Serving type: bottle."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark brown coloring, deep and opaque, with a sparse, filmy, bubbly, light tan head. Aromas of caramel, molasses, chocolate, roasted notes, cinnamon, nutmeg, cream highlights, hints of wood spice, and some subtle pine pitch. Flavors are robust and rich forward, with a blast of cocoa nibs, toffee, caramel, and molasses, all on a roasted, slightly charred backbone. Spice blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice, and clove, as well as some evergreen and resinous notes. Subtle cream and vanilla highlights lighten things up a bit. The beer has a smooth, light body, with an underlying bitter roast character throughout, and well into the aftertaste. Tangy sweet combo in the aftertaste, with all the richly sweet flavors hanging around. The finish is smooth, with a roasted sweet linger. Nice job this year."
"Unlike last year's offering, this year's Special Ale fell short of the mark.  Dark beer on the pour with a 1 finger head.  Tastes were different, but not in a positive way.  Strange sweetness, odd aftertaste.  not a great offering by usually reliable Anchor."
""
""
"O: As always, a solid holiday winter warmer beer that always seems to include a number of flavors/aromas that I associate with the season. Enjoyable and easy to drink with well hidden alcohol but as with almost all of the examples of the style, not a real sessionable beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability:  This is a weird one for a winter warmer.  I swear at times the overall effect of this beer in taste is that it reminds me of HP sauce, but not as tangy.  It's not a sweet beer and it's definitely unique, but I'm not sure if I like like it.  I'm not against it, but it wasn't what I was expecting in light of previous versions of this beer."
"An easy drinking ode to the holiday season. I taste Christmas and New Year's wrapped into one serving.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Tasty and with a seasional felling! Perfect with the fat, christmass food or just for a sip right with the fireplace :)"
"I can't give details on these Anchor releases anymore, as it is too hard to compare to notes from previous years. Suffice to say that it seems to be easier drinking this year, but not very complex or memorable. Lots of nice spices over a simplistic Porter base."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: 4.75 - One of the best OSA's in years. It's been over a decade, I think, since I was wowed by one. This one is very good. Last year's was on the shelves for months. I bet this one will disappear very quickly."
""
""
""
"O: An enjoyable change in the recipe this year, definitely still fits the season well and does a good job at balancing the sweetness and spices. Nice and easy to drink while remaining a good fireside sipper. Classic yet new and fined, as usual"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty good winter warmer and one that I look forward to every year during Christmas. The beer has all you would expect from the season from the cherry logo and the spices associated with gingerbread men. The flavors does not exact;y make this a beer you want to session but it is pretty nice to have with company to celebrate the season."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I do wish the Anchor brewers would be bolder with the spices. It's time to be creative."
""
""
"Poured into an Euler stange. Pours a deep red amber with a half finger light khaki head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, cinnamon, nutmeg, hints of dark dried fruit. Flavor is mild caramel malt, the same holiday spices as the aroma, mild dark dried fruit, mildly earthy with a hint of pine. A somewhat less piney than past versions I remember and now kind of old fashioned, but I look forward to this every year. One of my early craft beers from at least 30 years ago and one I've had almost every holiday. A nice, mellow holiday ale."
""
""
""
"Full bodied nose yet a lighter bodied taste.  A solid offering."
""
""
""
""
"I know that Anchor does good things, especially with this holiday seasonal ale, but I just can't get on board - the herbal, yeasty underpinning keeps me from appreciating everything else going on here, alas. Not bad, by any stretch of the imagination, but so surpassed by its upstart colleagues now, it's kind of sad."
""
"Pours a reddish brown with a one finger head. Smells like allspice, nutmeg, and a little cinnamon. The flavor is a little more subdued than the smell. Some toffee and allspice. A little more mild in mouthfeel than I would like."
""
"The warm toasted malt character is always what I love about this beer.  The spice is subtle, and well integrated.  One of my favorites every year, and this is no different.  If you have always been a fan of this release, don't let the detractors sway you."
"I treat this as an ""end of the night beer"" I work the 3-11 shift and like to have one drink when I get home. It has a unique flavor I cant quite identify but I will still pick another 6 pack up tomorrow."
""
"This one just is not doing it for me. It’s always fun to see how the recipe is changed year-to-year but this year is sort of a bust."
"Excellent"
""
""
""
""
""
"I always make an effort to try Anchor's special brews. Unfortunately this one let me down a bit. Really not much flavor and what is present is watered down. Tastes of soil, a bit musty."
"Excited to try this year's as I always look forward to the new release. Dark toffee and dried fruit, medium-thin mouthfeel with a little herbal character... what is going on with the fnish/aftertaste? Wet, musty soil? Seriously, something unpleasant. Started off familiar, but I reluctantly finished the bottle. Will try again to re-review, but disappointed."
