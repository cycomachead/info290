3.3,-8.6,3.25,3.75,3,3.5,3.25,"As soon as I popped the cap, I began to get foam coming up through the neck. This precipitated the pour, but negated anything more than gentility. I was getting loads of foam as the result and it quickly became obvious that this one was going to be time-consuming. Pour, wait. Pour, wait. No problem, since the French Vanilla-colored head looked like the top of an ice cream cone, plus I can always open something else in the interim. The density and retention of the head was almost worth the price of admission in and of itself. The nose was quite strong, especially of cinnamon, but also perhaps nutmeg and the honey lent a dull, not cloying, sweetness. Color was a slightly hazy golden-yellow (SRM = > 7, < 9). The lacing that began to form in the interim was beautifully sticky. The taste was a bit sharp for my liking, as if they might have used too heavy a hand in the addition of the spices. Cinnamon was quite evident, to the point of being overwhelming. Finish was dry, very spicy and really more than I would want at any time of year.","woodychandler","Jun 23, 2014"

Just out of the fridge, this tastes like a summertime beer with some cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg thrown into the pot for good measure. The ABV is not evident here. The flavor is tart, like a lemon zest (in the back of the tongue) sprinkled with cinnamon (in the front, sides and middle). Not at all the characteristics of warmers in my memory. As it warms, the flavors and aroma remain the same, but fuller and rounder than before. Five minutes after the last sip, I feel like I sucked on too many lemon balls and my breath is fresh.

First smell is grain mixed with a healthy dose of spices that are more common in fall seasonal/pumpkin beers. Still a nice smell, just more pronounced than I expected. Taste brings more of the same spice, plus a little hop bite and a touch of citrus sweetness. Very balanced and not overly sweet though. The mouthfeel in this one was interesting - overall I'd say medium-bodied, but it had a bit of grittiness to it that added some heft. This beer, like a lot of the RJ Rockers offerings, went done very easily - the combination of carbonation, mouthfeel, and overall balance makes these beers very smooth.","Daktah","Dec 11, 2012"

The flavors were very similar to the aroma with an emphasis on the cloves and caramel malt plus the addition of a bitter, slightly woody finish.

The taste is middle-of-the-road. There's a decent balance...semi-sweet. The spice is notable in the taste, and gives a peppery sensation on the tongue. Hops have a mid-taste bite that give a counterbalance to the malt. Not bad. Firm in body, but not quite as hefty as the beer needed.

Flavor is likewise, but without much malt to balance, which also proly leads to my view that the body is a bit light too although good carbonation.

One reviewer mentioned candy cane aromas and I'm getting them too... Lots of gingerbread spices with cinnamon and nutmeg and the like... Toasted malts with lots of sweetness... I'm digging this quite a bit...one of the better winter brews I had this year...","Tilley4","Jan 11, 2011"
3.35,-7.2,3.5,3.5,3,4,3.5,"It's not terrible. I would drink it if it was given to me, but I don't think I will be purchasing it again. I was a little disappointed because I do like RJ Rockers.","GehenHerzog","Dec 27, 2010"
4,10.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Served from tap into a Dogfish Head shaker. Poured golden yellow with a one and a half finger bone white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, cinnamon, corriander, cloves, and candy cane. Yes, candy cane... The flavor was of malt, cloves, corriander, cinnamon, and a slight banana note. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was quite a nice brew. Given that it was a winter brew and I had it in the early fall really says something about this one. I am still in shock even after the next day that I got candy cane on the nose... This is definitely a nice and smooth drinking beer with no harsh flavors anywhere in sight. I will definitely be drinking more of this in the coming winter months for sure. This is a definite must try on tap.","thagr81us","Oct 13, 2010"
3.87,7.2,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"One of these is plenty, even at 6%. That peppery finish brings it down a tad.","beer2day","May 28, 2010"
3.92,8.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"I first sampled this at Columbia's World Beer Festival and have since had it several times. Overall a nice and drinkable Winter Warmer, with quite an appealing spice mix in the aroma; the honeyish notes must indeed stem from the use of honey in the brewing, which is indicated on the label. A nice interpretation for the style; not the best out there, but definitely a go-to choice when it's available.","superdedooperboy","Mar 18, 2010"
4.87,34.9,4.5,5,5,4,5,"My favorite winter ale! The First Snow Ale is an American-style pale ale, moderately hopped. It also happens to have 15 pounds of honey and almost every spice in the cabinet thrown in: cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, orange peel and allspice. Nice! With the 6% alcohol makes it even better!","showbob","Mar 11, 2010"
3.79,5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a rich, somewhat hazy pale amber, with barely half a finger of white head that disappears to the edges quickly. The nose teems with sweet spices: nutmeg, cinnamon, clove. An undercurrent of hoppy bananas is also detectable. It's as though a pale ale were crossed with a rich apple cider (in a good way, believe me). The taste doesn't quite follow this formula, though, with the spices taking a distinct back seat to the hoppy, pale ale flavors, though they are still there. The banana is forced into a sideshow, something only appearing (and seemingly appealing) only to those looking for such a thrill. Luckily, the body is quite moderate, allowing this warmer to maintain the drinkability established by its nose.","TMoney2591","Feb 09, 2010"
3.28,-9.1,4,3.5,3,4,3,"The aroma here is pure spice, but from the aroma I can't tell if it's a winter ale or a pumpkin beer. The taste is closer to what I expect from a spiced winter ale, but there's still an awful lot of pumpkin pie spice (nutmeg or allspice) in here. It's a perfectly good, perfectly forgettable winter ale.","Sallerj","Feb 07, 2010"
3.28,-9.1,4,3.5,3,4,3,"Son of a Peach was better, but I'm interested in this brewery.","TheycallmeTim","Dec 27, 2009"
4.26,18,3.5,5,4,4.5,4,"D - Really a very good beer, but I wouldn't recommend more than one in a sitting. The flavors tend to pile up in beers like this and they become overpowering if you have another one. But hey, if you see this around pick some up. It's definitely worth a try, and as far as winter brews go it's up there with some of the best.","glamphetamine","Dec 22, 2009"
3.92,8.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Comes out of the tap a clear, darkish amber with an average head. Aroma is strong and spicy as well as somewhat malty; spice is mainly cinnamon and cloves. Flavor is fairly strong and malty, and the spicy component is mainly cloves and cinnamon. There is also just a hint of hops. Texture is fairly smooth and tingly, and nips at the tongue.","Cyberkedi","Dec 22, 2009"
3.87,7.2,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Worth trying, but I disagree with the label that suggests you "chill the mug" (or glass) before drinking - this was best after it warmed a touch and the malt was able to balance the spices a little bit more.","NeroFiddled","Jun 26, 2009"
3.5,-3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Medium body and a decent smooth moutfeel. I have not had this fresh but it does not seem to be any worse for wear at this point.","ZimZamZoom","May 09, 2009"

3.83,6.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a fair head that settles to a ring. Smells quite sweet and somewhat spicy, with nutmeg, mace, and cinammon, as well as perhaps a bit of clove and orange peel. The taste is still a little sweet, but not as much so as the nose would have you believe it is going to be. There is a nuttiness and a creaminess here as well that goes pretty well with the sweetness and the spice. Pretty clean and a little light, not thick or heavy at all, and thus fairly easy to drink for the style. Not bad at all- a lighter interpretation of a winter-spiced beer, with a nice nuttiness that almost reminds me of pralines.","Georgiabeer","Apr 15, 2009"
4.33,19.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A spiced pale ale thats perfect for the holidays. Light copper color with a medium body. Good amount of head after the pour (about an inch) and slowly thins out. The aroma is huge in this one...full of cinnamon and clove. The flavors that really come out are the nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. At 6% abv this is not advised as a session beer. Very nicely balanced though. A nicely done seasonal overall. Dumbfounded by the past couple ratings. Looking forward to having it more often next winter.","woodjm","Mar 05, 2009"
3.2,-11.4,3,3,3.5,3,3,"This is my first beer from RJ's, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Overall it wasn't too bad. Granted, it wasn't great either. It had a very light spice to the smell, but the spice taste was more up front in the taste. To me, it kind of tasted like a light pumpkin beer. I do look forward to try other brews offered from RJ's.","JISurfer","Mar 03, 2009"
2.4,-33.5,3,3,2,3,2,"Color's nice -- and promising -- but the enjoyment takes a dive from there. I get a light carbonation tingle on the tongue, and the body's okay (light, I think). But the flavor's all nutmeg... maybe a little cinnamon. At least the alcohol is working. Another Rockers brew I'm mostly disappointed by.","StarSAELS","Mar 02, 2009"
3.62,0.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A: A medium gold with a reddish hue, a ring of foam along the edges of the glass - 3.50, S: Lots of spice, a fragance that can only be cinnamon, a hint of green wood - 4.25, T: Loads of grain on the front, some mild hop bite on the back, less pronounced spice on the palate than the nose, mildly nutty and with a hint of toastiness - 3.75, M: Medium bodied - 3.50, D: Some nice touches to a spiced ale, not a standout but a solid beer - 3.50","deereless","Feb 20, 2009"
3.92,8.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"M + D: A little light... I'd like some more body, but it's not too bad at all. Drinks smooth and easy. A nice seasonal offering, and something I'd be interested in trying again.","Proteus93","Jan 28, 2009"
3.82,5.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Good balance for this spiced Winter Warmer, a little rough around the edges but I dig that. I find with spiced beers if they are too clean the spicing immediately takes over, not the case here. Give this one a go.","Jason","Jan 04, 2009"
3.77,4.4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability - after getting passed my expectations for the beer, i rather enjoyed it and would have no problem drinking a few more...definitely fits the category of a winter ale","wchesak","Jan 04, 2009"
3.78,4.7,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability: Nice array of spices set against a lighter, more drinkable pale ale. Did R.J. Rockers brew up a pleasant winter beer? Yes, yes, they did.","ChainGangGuy","Dec 17, 2008"

3.77,4.4,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Had this on tap at Sonny's in Spartanburg tonight. Poured a pale amber with a decent head. The smell was full of spices and grain, as was the taste. No real hops to it. Very earthy grainy flavor, almost gritty. Had some suprising fruit undertomes to it. Went down very easy and could easily see myself drinking more of these. This was my first offering from RJ Rockers but I will be trying more","mikesgroove","Jan 12, 2007"

3.86,6.9,3,4.5,4,3,3.5,"Over all it's flavorful and drinkable. I deducted a half a point in the drinkability because of the spiciness. After a couple I would want to move on to something else.","wcudwight","Aug 13, 2006"
4.2,16.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This beer is a winter warmer no matter what the listed style is. The beer poured a hazy golden color. There was a nice head. The smell was of spices and reminded me of a cold winter day beside the fire. Ths taste was spiced. Cinnamon was dominate. The mouthfeel was smooth. There was no harshness. This is an easy drinking beer I will be sure to have again sometime.","Enola","Aug 13, 2006"
3.4,-5.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"This comes a light pale yellow-goldish color with a thin cap off tap. Sparkles a little, and the cap dissipates to some lacings. Smell is very spicy right off. You can smell cloves, cardamom, and some hops. Smells very clean and refreshing. The taste is initially sweet, then the spices smack your tongue around like a speed bag, and the hops follow to lock it all in. I had a Belgian buddy have a pint with me, and this was WAY above the level of taste he was used to. Mouth feel was medium with a little carbonation. It's spiciness really leaves you wondering what just happened, but hops brings it all together nicely. This is definitely a winter beer full of flavor and warmth. I hope they bring this back next year.","jabocu","Feb 21, 2006"
3.37,-6.6,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Fairly bitter. Well balanced. Very good body. A nice beer and a perfect accompaniment for the First Snow in SC (which may be three years from now).","SaCkErZ9","Oct 11, 2005"
