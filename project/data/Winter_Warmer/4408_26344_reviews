"Good beer for winter . Has cinnamon flavor"
"O- a nice winter warmer that has a good blend of spicing"

"Lite bodied, but a nice spice combo"

"Aroma of malt, spice, citrus, faint hops. Taste spicey cinnamon, nutmeg, bready malt. Harsh bitter hop and spice in the flavor. Couple dots and bits of lace. Medium body. Soft, kind of smooth carbonation of moderate strength. Ok!"
""
""
"Tastes like bad cough medicine."
"A holiday nose that features  health spicing makes me draw back and admire the amber color and lovely head on this one. Nose showcases the spices while allowing a solid malt bill to underpin and hold court. Taste is an enjoyable pale ale holiday. Feel and flavor give a winter weightiness. Nice. An above averages take on the style that lends itself to session style rounds of drinking."

"Overall, a pretty standard winter warmer that could use a bit of cleaning up. It is totally drinkable, though, even if it is a bit rough around the edges."

"02/06/13 On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. Very nice spiced pale ale. If you like Southern Tier Pumpking or McKenzie's Seasonal Reserve cider, you'll probably like this. The spices are not as upfront but it all works out to a very pleasant experience."

"O: Got this one at World Market in Asheville, NC, drank in Pensacola, FL July 25th, 2014. Quite well done, its gusher and lemony taste are distinctive for the style. Definite spices on this one."
"As soon as I popped the cap, I began to get foam coming up through the neck. This precipitated the pour, but negated anything more than gentility. I was getting loads of foam as the result and it quickly became obvious that this one was going to be time-consuming. Pour, wait. Pour, wait. No problem, since the French Vanilla-colored head looked like the top of an ice cream cone, plus I can always open something else in the interim. The density and retention of the head was almost worth the price of admission in and of itself. The nose was quite strong, especially of cinnamon, but also perhaps nutmeg and the honey lent a dull, not cloying, sweetness. Color was a slightly hazy golden-yellow (SRM = > 7, < 9). The lacing that began to form in the interim was beautifully sticky. The taste was a bit sharp for my liking, as if they might have used too heavy a hand in the addition of the spices. Cinnamon was quite evident, to the point of being overwhelming. Finish was dry, very spicy and really more than I would want at any time of year."

"Clear medium amber pour with a slight red hue. Nose is of clove mostly, with hints of nutmeg, cardamom and cinnamon. Almost a light medium body with good carbonation. Nice balanced blend of spice flavor with nutmeg and cinnamon on the forefront, cardamom in the middle and with clove dominating the end. Clean finish with a bitter clove aftertaste. A bit of sweetness would improve the balance and contrast the spice. Still, this one is outstanding."

"Some winter beers you have one and then it's off to sleep... this one, you'd happily have a second."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is full of spices, cinnamon coming through strong. Taste is lighter than the smell, some spices, malts, a touch of honey, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall, while not spectacular, is a solid beer."
"As a winter warmer, this falls short of my expectations for the style. Thin head with very little lacing. Smells nice and spicy, reminiscent of red cinnamon heart candy. Just out of the fridge, this tastes like a summertime beer with some cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg thrown into the pot for good measure. The ABV is not evident here. The flavor is tart, like a lemon zest (in the back of the tongue) sprinkled with cinnamon (in the front, sides and middle). Not at all the characteristics of warmers in my memory. As it warms, the flavors and aroma remain the same, but fuller and rounder than before. Five minutes after the last sip, I feel like I sucked on too many lemon balls and my breath is fresh. Interesting? Yes, but just kind of odd."

"This beer pours up a medium cloudy amber with a one finger off white head, some retention, and plenty of spotty lacing left behind. Smell is cinnamon, honey, and yeast. Taste is very dry with a kind of spicy finish and a yeasty taste. Mouthfeel is sort of unappealing. Not horrible, but not my type of beer either."
""
""
"Taste-Coriander, orange, honey, faint cinnamon and nutmeg as it warms. Refreshing and easy-drinking for a winter warmer. Would go nicely on a mild South Carolina winter day. Worth a try."
""
"O- Not a bad beer will have again."
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent brew. If there was a hint of pumpkin here it would make an excellent beer. There pie spices and crust-like bready notes are pretty damn good. I really liked this beer for it's drinkability and it's spice character. A few of these will definitely warm you up in the late autumn."
""
"Poured a hazy golden/amber color with noticeable carbonation and a moderate head that left little lacing. First smell is grain mixed with a healthy dose of spices that are more common in fall seasonal/pumpkin beers. Still a nice smell, just more pronounced than I expected. Taste brings more of the same spice, plus a little hop bite and a touch of citrus sweetness. Very balanced and not overly sweet though. The mouthfeel in this one was interesting - overall I'd say medium-bodied, but it had a bit of grittiness to it that added some heft. This beer, like a lot of the RJ Rockers offerings, went done very easily - the combination of carbonation, mouthfeel, and overall balance makes these beers very smooth."
""
"Aside from the really tall head this is a pretty solid beer."

"D - Not bad. After seeing the ridiculous level of carbonation I was afraid that it was infected, but it turned out to be clean. The spices are relatively well done, but it isn't anything special."
"Overall: definitely a nice beer for the season. This one tasted decent even after 9 months of storage. The base beer cant really be commented on."
""
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the spicy qualities present throughout both the nose and the flavoring. There was such an array of spicy inclusions, making this nice and inviting for a cozy drink on a cool day. During the summer, however, it is a bit much, and we were bogged down by the heaviness at times."
""
""
"O: This beer is quite easy to drink compared to others in the styles. Although it doesnâ€™t have enough alcohol to produce warming sensations in your mouth, the body is strong enough to keep you warm on a chilly fall night."
""
"O-no complaints about this one, especially for free"
""
"Overall a very interesting spin on your typical dark thick bodied winter warmer. Would love to try this again fresh to see if the spices are more pronounced in the flavor."
""

"Out of a bottle this beer was a murky amber color with one finger of eggshell-white head. The retention of the thin collar was not bad and the lacing in broken streaks. The aroma had a strong note of cloves along with sweetbreads, caramel malt, nutmeg and a little cinnamon. The flavors were very similar to the aroma with an emphasis on the cloves and caramel malt plus the addition of a bitter, slightly woody finish. The mouthfeel was creamy and slick, the body medium and the carbonation a bit prickly. A nice example of a Winter Warmer and definitely worth a try if you are the type who enjoys spiced beers."
""
""
"O - This is a very nice winter ale, unlike many other brews of the same style the spices are very balanced and not so in your face. (Definitely there, just not overpowering). solid brew"
""
"Very good, makes me even more homesick!"
""
"Overall a very drinkable and enjoyable winter warmer. Could use maybe a bit more heat, but does fine as it is. Would have liked to see a bit more character in the spices. Really not a bad little beer though."
""
"This beer is a golden liquid, slightly hazy, with notable yeast 'floaties'. Slim white head. It's not an brilliantly attractive beer...average. The aroma is nice: spice is the first thing that's noticeable. Cinnamon. There's a little nutmeg, pale malt, and earthy hops. It's a Christmas smell for a winter brew; appropriate. The taste is middle-of-the-road. There's a decent balance...semi-sweet. The spice is notable in the taste, and gives a peppery sensation on the tongue. Hops have a mid-taste bite that give a counterbalance to the malt. Not bad. Firm in body, but not quite as hefty as the beer needed. All in all, this is drinkable and good, but not very interesting, and really rather ordinary for the season."
"O: While this beer is drinkable, it is wildly uneven. It has some good qualities and some mediocre ones."
""
"o - not too shabby, really quenched my thirst and was a nice beer to drink while watching national lampoon's christmas vacation"
""
"Cloudy orange beer with a rapidlt fading head .Aroma is spices(smeels like those spice wafer cookies).Taste is the same holiday spices that you would find in an egg nog.Overall an average beer nothing less nothing more.I doubt I would recommend or purchase again."
"Cloudy yellowish orange in appearance with a finger of head that has little retention. The nose is clearly x-mas spices and the taste is quite spicy as well - cinnamon takes the lead here. There is a pleasantly dry finish, but it is a bit thin. An interesting brew, but maybe overall too light for a winter beer."
"O: Looks and smells great, but I thought the malt should pop more in the flavor and the body was a bit too light for a winter warmer. I liked the Summit Winter Ale better."
""
"Best part was the smell. Poured with a small to medium sized, fine, off white that settled down to a ring after a bit and no lace. Color is a hazy pumpkin pie amber (which is a nice coincidence the same spices used to brew with) with some bubble trails. Aroma is mainly those spices, beer, and later a little funk. Flavor is likewise, but without much malt to balance, which also proly leads to my view that the body is a bit light too although good carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of average length for a spice beer. I'm not finishing mine. Wish I had some cheese or something to neutralize my mouth."
"O- This beer was nothing special but a nice one time beer. The ABV doesn't show at all which I liked. A little spiced forward which I thought could be tones down a little. Overall I would try again but wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again."
"D - not a session beer but you could have more than one before the flavor wears you down."
"O: A good taste for the season, but I doubt I will search for it again."
"D- Top to bottom, this may be the Winter Warmer I've had to date. A really splendid beer."
"D: This very good but not what I expected with the name ""First Snow Ale"" because it is quite light and citrusy for the style."
"D: Usually I don't like spiced beer much and wouldn't have bought this had I read the label closer, but in the end I'm glad I did as this brew kept the spice in check and matched this subtler spice profile with a light bodied ale. A little more attention to the malt bill, and this brew could be a real winter staple."
"Pours a rich dark amber, with not much head that disappears fast. The is spicy. The taste doesn't quite hit the mark in my mind. A little strange in the mix. Luckily, the body and mouthfeel are good. But, while I was okay with drinking one, I switched after. I'm not quite sure what they were shooting for. But, maybe it's just not for everyone. It seems most of the people are split on this one."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into dimpled mug. Pours cloudy amber and short bubbly white head that gathers around the edges on the glass. Aroma is very spicy! Lots of cinnamon, ginger, and clove along with caramel and sweet malts. Taste is gingerbread cookies, caramel, cinnamon toast, and sweet malts. Bit of nuttiness and dried fruit notes coming through as well. Body is medium with moderate carbonation. Finishes with more strong spices - cinnamon and ginger, mostly - caramel, light nutty flavors, and sweet malts. Dried dark fruit as well. Very good winter beer. A sleeper out of the bunch I was evaluating for my winter/christmas beer review."
"Wow... Very nice winter brew here... This is like gingerbread cookies in a glass and isn't overly spiced like some others are... One reviewer mentioned candy cane aromas and I'm getting them too... Lots of gingerbread spices with cinnamon and nutmeg and the like... Toasted malts with lots of sweetness... I'm digging this quite a bit...one of the better winter brews I had this year..."
"It's not terrible. I would drink it if it was given to me, but I don't think I will be purchasing it again. I was a little disappointed because I do like RJ Rockers."
"Served from tap into a Dogfish Head shaker. Poured golden yellow with a one and a half finger bone white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, cinnamon, corriander, cloves, and candy cane. Yes, candy cane... The flavor was of malt, cloves, corriander, cinnamon, and a slight banana note. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was quite a nice brew. Given that it was a winter brew and I had it in the early fall really says something about this one. I am still in shock even after the next day that I got candy cane on the nose... This is definitely a nice and smooth drinking beer with no harsh flavors anywhere in sight. I will definitely be drinking more of this in the coming winter months for sure. This is a definite must try on tap."
"One of these is plenty, even at 6%. That peppery finish brings it down a tad."
"I first sampled this at Columbia's World Beer Festival and have since had it several times. Overall a nice and drinkable Winter Warmer, with quite an appealing spice mix in the aroma; the honeyish notes must indeed stem from the use of honey in the brewing, which is indicated on the label. A nice interpretation for the style; not the best out there, but definitely a go-to choice when it's available."
"My favorite winter ale! The First Snow Ale is an American-style pale ale, moderately hopped. It also happens to have 15 pounds of honey and almost every spice in the cabinet thrown in: cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, orange peel and allspice. Nice! With the 6% alcohol makes it even better!"
"Pours a rich, somewhat hazy pale amber, with barely half a finger of white head that disappears to the edges quickly. The nose teems with sweet spices: nutmeg, cinnamon, clove. An undercurrent of hoppy bananas is also detectable. It's as though a pale ale were crossed with a rich apple cider (in a good way, believe me). The taste doesn't quite follow this formula, though, with the spices taking a distinct back seat to the hoppy, pale ale flavors, though they are still there. The banana is forced into a sideshow, something only appearing (and seemingly appealing) only to those looking for such a thrill. Luckily, the body is quite moderate, allowing this warmer to maintain the drinkability established by its nose."
"The aroma here is pure spice, but from the aroma I can't tell if it's a winter ale or a pumpkin beer. The taste is closer to what I expect from a spiced winter ale, but there's still an awful lot of pumpkin pie spice (nutmeg or allspice) in here. It's a perfectly good, perfectly forgettable winter ale."
"Son of a Peach was better, but I'm interested in this brewery."
"D - Really a very good beer, but I wouldn't recommend more than one in a sitting. The flavors tend to pile up in beers like this and they become overpowering if you have another one. But hey, if you see this around pick some up. It's definitely worth a try, and as far as winter brews go it's up there with some of the best."
"Comes out of the tap a clear, darkish amber with an average head. Aroma is strong and spicy as well as somewhat malty; spice is mainly cinnamon and cloves. Flavor is fairly strong and malty, and the spicy component is mainly cloves and cinnamon. There is also just a hint of hops. Texture is fairly smooth and tingly, and nips at the tongue."
"Worth trying, but I disagree with the label that suggests you ""chill the mug"" (or glass) before drinking - this was best after it warmed a touch and the malt was able to balance the spices a little bit more."
"Medium body and a decent smooth moutfeel. I have not had this fresh but it does not seem to be any worse for wear at this point."
"Another solid production from RJ Rockers"
"Pours a slightly hazy golden with a fair head that settles to a ring. Smells quite sweet and somewhat spicy, with nutmeg, mace, and cinammon, as well as perhaps a bit of clove and orange peel. The taste is still a little sweet, but not as much so as the nose would have you believe it is going to be. There is a nuttiness and a creaminess here as well that goes pretty well with the sweetness and the spice. Pretty clean and a little light, not thick or heavy at all, and thus fairly easy to drink for the style. Not bad at all- a lighter interpretation of a winter-spiced beer, with a nice nuttiness that almost reminds me of pralines."
"A spiced pale ale thats perfect for the holidays. Light copper color with a medium body. Good amount of head after the pour (about an inch) and slowly thins out. The aroma is huge in this one...full of cinnamon and clove. The flavors that really come out are the nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. At 6% abv this is not advised as a session beer. Very nicely balanced though. A nicely done seasonal overall. Dumbfounded by the past couple ratings. Looking forward to having it more often next winter."
"This is my first beer from RJ's, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Overall it wasn't too bad. Granted, it wasn't great either. It had a very light spice to the smell, but the spice taste was more up front in the taste. To me, it kind of tasted like a light pumpkin beer. I do look forward to try other brews offered from RJ's."
"Color's nice -- and promising -- but the enjoyment takes a dive from there. I get a light carbonation tingle on the tongue, and the body's okay (light, I think). But the flavor's all nutmeg... maybe a little cinnamon. At least the alcohol is working. Another Rockers brew I'm mostly disappointed by."
"A: A medium gold with a reddish hue, a ring of foam along the edges of the glass - 3.50, S: Lots of spice, a fragance that can only be cinnamon, a hint of green wood - 4.25, T: Loads of grain on the front, some mild hop bite on the back, less pronounced spice on the palate than the nose, mildly nutty and with a hint of toastiness - 3.75, M: Medium bodied - 3.50, D: Some nice touches to a spiced ale, not a standout but a solid beer - 3.50"
"M + D: A little light... I'd like some more body, but it's not too bad at all. Drinks smooth and easy. A nice seasonal offering, and something I'd be interested in trying again."
"Good balance for this spiced Winter Warmer, a little rough around the edges but I dig that. I find with spiced beers if they are too clean the spicing immediately takes over, not the case here. Give this one a go."
"Drinkability - after getting passed my expectations for the beer, i rather enjoyed it and would have no problem drinking a few more...definitely fits the category of a winter ale"
"Drinkability: Nice array of spices set against a lighter, more drinkable pale ale. Did R.J. Rockers brew up a pleasant winter beer? Yes, yes, they did."
"I could drink many of these!"
"Had this on tap at Sonny's in Spartanburg tonight. Poured a pale amber with a decent head. The smell was full of spices and grain, as was the taste. No real hops to it. Very earthy grainy flavor, almost gritty. Had some suprising fruit undertomes to it. Went down very easy and could easily see myself drinking more of these. This was my first offering from RJ Rockers but I will be trying more"
"Pint at CW's in Columbia, SC."
"Over all it's flavorful and drinkable. I deducted a half a point in the drinkability because of the spiciness. After a couple I would want to move on to something else."
"This beer is a winter warmer no matter what the listed style is. The beer poured a hazy golden color. There was a nice head. The smell was of spices and reminded me of a cold winter day beside the fire. Ths taste was spiced. Cinnamon was dominate. The mouthfeel was smooth. There was no harshness. This is an easy drinking beer I will be sure to have again sometime."
"This comes a light pale yellow-goldish color with a thin cap off tap. Sparkles a little, and the cap dissipates to some lacings. Smell is very spicy right off. You can smell cloves, cardamom, and some hops. Smells very clean and refreshing. The taste is initially sweet, then the spices smack your tongue around like a speed bag, and the hops follow to lock it all in. I had a Belgian buddy have a pint with me, and this was WAY above the level of taste he was used to. Mouth feel was medium with a little carbonation. It's spiciness really leaves you wondering what just happened, but hops brings it all together nicely. This is definitely a winter beer full of flavor and warmth. I hope they bring this back next year."
"Fairly bitter. Well balanced. Very good body. A nice beer and a perfect accompaniment for the First Snow in SC (which may be three years from now)."
