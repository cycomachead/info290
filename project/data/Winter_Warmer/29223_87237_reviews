"Pours a dark reddish brown from the can with a foamy mocha head. Smells of cocoa and roasted malts, but the aroma's subdued. The chocolate and roasted malt is more predominant in the taste, along with toffee, raisins and  dark cherries. Medium mouth with some carbonation. Not much spice for a winter warmer, but it's a very nice beer, somewhere between a strong ale and a porter."

"Not the best winter beer"

"Stir Crazy pours a dark brown color with a small lacing head.  There is a sweet aroma with hints of vanilla, brown sugar and raisins.  The taste has big and heavy, lots of vanilla, sweet fruit, with hints of chocolate.  Nice big body and feel.  Overall its a fantastic beer, and a top winter warmer."

"Overall: might give this a try on tap at a later point, just to make sure, but it seems like this one and I are just not meant to be together."

"Good head. Tap beer at Celts in Rosemount"

"O - A unique take on a winter warmer. Not the caramel overload other beers in the style can be. The mix of flavors is unique and rewarding. Worth checking out!"

"I noticed a slight smell of roasted nuts and cocoa beans. This is a malty rather than hoppy beer. However, it does not have the creamy flavor of other malty beers such as Guinness. The aftertaste reminds me of figs, raisins or some other similar dried fruit."
""
"Very good flavor.  Chocolate at first then brown sugar and raisins."
"Pours very, very, dark ruby red. Two fingers of tan, creamy head that dissipates slowly, with nice clinging. Sweet aroma, with fruit, some malt overtones, roasty, and chocolate. Moderate mouth feel (not thin, but not thick, either), but satisfying. Smokey, malty taste; the fruit taste is subtle and controlled. Sweetness is evident but not overpowering in the beginning, but becomes a bit cloying by the end. Very mild hop bitterness in the middle. I don't generally go for fruit beers, but this one is nicely balanced. All of the ""extra"" ingredients (cacao, vanilla, raisins, brown sugar) add subtle and very pleasant taste. This is a good tasting ale, even though as it warms the sweetness becomes a bit too much for me. YMMV."

"Can: Poured a dark deep brown color ale with a medium size off-white head with limited retention and not much lacing. Aroma of dry raisin and brown sugar with a healthy dose of caramelized sugar is very interesting. Taste is also dominated by a healthy dose of caramelized malt with some dry raisins notes and some light residual brown sugar notes. Body is bit light to sustain all the spices and dry fruits notes with medium carbonation. Interesting beer but seems to be lacking a little bit malt profile."

"Overall, this complex winter ale is unusual and satisfying. A little more body for a fuller mouthfeel would be a plus or just drive a little more gravity from base malt and get more warmth AND body. But this beer does not disappoint and it's unusual character and wonderful balance make this an awesome beer."

"Good beer, would be a nice change of pace beer. Interesting blend of a lot of flavors, really lacks in the body department though."

"very easy drinking winter warmer, sort of modeling itself on a belgian quad, at least in terms of malt bill and flavor notes, but drinking a whole lot easier. the can says brown sugar, but i don't get a lot of that after the head has settled well enough for me to take a big whiff. i get the vanilla, and i really get the raisins, apparently pureed or something before added to the kettle. all the sugar that should be here is fermented out, this is not at all sweet for what it is, a testament to the yeast, which has cleaned the beer up nicely without imparting a ton of flavor. balance with the additives in taste, but the vanilla is the strongest. fuller bodied but honestly just a bit light for the style. like that we have a winter warmer here without all the usual spice accompaniment. i would buy this, great use of raisins too"

"Good seasonal!"

"Pours out dark as night with a tiny brown head that dissipated right away. Smell is of raisins and other dark fruit. I really don't get much else from the nose. Taste is much like the nose. Really I only get dark fruits, maybe a little brown sugar, really just not that much going on but it is pretty tasty but nothing special to be sure. Mouthfeel is ironically slightly thick even though it seems not very carbonated. Just not a very complex beer in my opinion. It tastes OK and I wouldn't not drink it but it's not anything that I would buy again."

"Edit: had another six pack and had to bump it up. Lot of nice flavors here packed into a 6.5% beer."
""
""
"For me, this is Indeed's most drinkable beer yet. I simply can't stop at one."
""
""
"Too many competing flavors for me. I am sure many will like the cocoa and vanilla mix."
""
""
"O- Other than the somewhat weak mouthfeel, I really liked this one. Good, complex flavors and a good winter beer."
""

"Pours a dark ruddy brown with a trace tan head and no lacing. Smells of figs, chocolate, dried cherry, caramel. I can taste the chocolate nibs, figs or possibly raisins, dark dried fruit, caramel. Body is medium light. Carbonation is a bit weak. Overall the miscellaneous flavors aren't working for me."
""

"Overall: Supporting this local and 12oz cans. It's an interesting mix of flavors but doesn't really make a clear statement. Not a stout with strong chocolate/coffee and not amped up spicy winter beer, just in the middle between those. Decent enough but not really to my tastes."
""
""
"O- This has been my least favorite Indeed, all their other stuff is much better. To be honest I think it is just way too convoluted and over-engineered. The can reads like a cake recipe, cacao nibs, vanilla, raisins, brown sugar AND natural flavors, whatever those may be. I dont think they needed to add all those extras, each one on its own or with one more ingredient might have led to more complimentary flavors, but the kitchen sink approach didn't result in a successful beer for me."

"Overall: A very good spin on a Winter beer. Its more like a twist on a Milk/Sweet Stout than the typical Winter Warmer. Good creamy chocolate taste with a nice dark fruit undertone."
"Medium bodied with modest carbonation. Has a cocoa nib and dark fruit aftertaste. A pretty good beer, but I'm not sure if all of the flavors compliment each other real well. Glad I at least picked up a single can to try this."

"A great take on a winter warmer. This would make a great Thanksgiving/Christmas beer. Very holiday like in flavor and easy drinking too."

"I'll say it again: Nice work! Love to see it canned, though. Maybe next year?"
"O - Good winter seasonal. Really impressed with the Indeed beers that I found in MN."

"Heck of a beer. Just really balanced, with lots going on in a compact package. Roasty, spiced, smooth, and delicious."
""
"Edit for 2013 canning: Much more chocolate in the aroma and taste, maybe a little more chocolate than I would prefer, which begins to bother me about halfway through the can. The addition of vanilla is more subtle in the aroma, but provides a nice extra finish to the beer that I like. I liked it better before, and my average dropped from a 4.3 to a 3.6. I am sure the chocolate will garner the beer more attention, but not what I wanted."
