Taste is much the same with a candied dark fruit flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I think it tastes better than it smells.","UCLABrewN84","Oct 19, 2012"

I did not have the head retention that was listed previously, probably due to being from bottle as opposed from tap. Surprisingly sweet up front with powerful malt on the back. A classic winter warmer style. This whole beer rings of "old school" The nose has sweet almost bubblegum notes, similiar to a wheat beer. The body is all ale though. I haven't had too many of this brewery's beers, but this is definitely one to remember and try next holiday season. One or two or a snowy night would be very pleasant.","Treborofmoria","Jan 14, 2012"

Taste is full of roasted malt, chocolate, lightly lactic, medium bitterness throughout, spicy rye like notes as well, faint coffee in the finish. Medium carbonation, full body, medium feel.

4.12,5.6,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured a dark burgundy, bordering on black. A finger of tan head fades to some big bubbles, and retains a collar of head with minimal lace. Nose of dark fruits, milk chocolate, plum, figs, bit of roastiness and some warm winter spices (cinnamon, nutmeg) which aren't prominent, but are interwoven amongst the others. Taste has more of the dark fruits and chocolate battling for supremacy on the palate, with some roastiness in there for good measure. Good smooth mouthfeel, with a quick hint of the alcohol in the finish. Solid drinkability, a winner.","liamt07","Jan 21, 2011"
2.9,-25.6,3,3,3,3,2.5,"I'm guessing this is more like a porter. 6.5 abv doesn't usually make for a winter warmer. Overall, just not much there. Liquid bread.","prg1976","Jan 15, 2011"

3.4,-12.8,4,4,3.5,3,2.5,"A typical ale/porter/stout variety. Slight roast, moderate malt, not complex enough to carry the bitterness. Unpleasant aftertaste. Metallic notes didn't impress me. Nothing outstanding. The spicy malty smell was the best part. I much preferred the Peter's English Ale.","OldGrowler","Jan 08, 2011"
3.85,-1.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The taste differs from the nose slightly. It starts out with a fairly strong coffee essence, then followed by lots of chocolate flavors with the caramel complimenting that profile. Some slight herbal bitterness in the finish from either the dark roasted grains or some light UK hops. Full malt flavor. Really nice sweetness up front. Some nearly burnt roast that leads to a long dry finish. The heavy malt flavors contrast atypically with the lighter body. A nice example of the winter warmer style. You can always rely upon the English to do a classy style correctly. St. Peters is one of the few English breweries which you can consistently rely on to deliver an authentic, quality AND fresh product to the states (second only to Sam Smith). Extremely drinkable and worth the purchase if located.","claspada","Dec 26, 2010"
3.6,-7.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Nose is some light roast, cocoa, caramel, a hint of earth. Taste follow suit with a noticable cherry flavor which borders on syrupy/medicinal, a hint of anise. Caramel, fruit bread, plums, cocoa, roast - not a stout but some of the characteristics of an English stout. It's quite quaffable, a little thin bodied, creamy but low carb. Decent but not as impressive as other offerings from this brewery.","ritzkiss","Dec 25, 2010"
3.97,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Drink - The alcohol is extremely well hidden and this is a great winter warmer. It reminded me a little bit of a scaled down version Unibroue's Trois Pistols. Worth seeking out, especially during the colder months.","spinrsx","Dec 15, 2010"
3.97,1.8,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A good twist on the more spice-forward Winter Warmers I've had, possessing a lot more characteristics of an English Stout. If this was indeed a stout, I could think of several stouts that I'd purchase before this one, but I like it as a unique WW. This style has yet to really blow me away, but keep them coming for the season! This one's a great start.","ludachris","Dec 14, 2010"
3.74,-4.1,3,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a dark brown colour with thin tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Almost no lacing on the glass. Smells of mild roasted malt, earthy hops, caramel and and chocolate.

3.63,-6.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The ABV for this beer is pretty high for a British beer but I found it to be well balanced and very quaffable.

This beer is fuller bodied than expected and I was pleasantly surprised by it's complexity.","corby112","Dec 12, 2010"
3.43,-12.1,4.5,4,3,3,3.5,"D: Alcohol is definitely noticeable, surprising considering the relatively low ABV. Not sure from whence the odd sourness comes, perhaps it's because I'm flirting with the Best Before date, maybe it's just the style. At any rate, it detracts from an otherwise pleasant ale. It is true winter outdoors (0Â° C and five inches of snow on the ground) and that does make this beer feel more appropriate. Based on this tasting, I can't recommend it.","AgentMunky","Dec 04, 2010"
4.09,4.9,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Good atmosphere. Bold, intimidating appearance, although nothing too exciting, and not much in terms of a head or lacing. Nose is great though. Great combination of deep, rich roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate hints. Flavor follows suit. Deep, rich, and robust, and a clean palette with a good balance of tones. Overall, this is a really good quaff.","bmwats","Nov 20, 2010"

The mouthfeel is creamy, nice agreeable texture on a cold winter's day.

Very dark and chocolate roasted characters. A touch of coffee, but mostly dark and roasted malts. Grain, and a bit of a grist-like scent. Low hop presence in the smell. The taste is a bit restrained, especially given the smell, although htere is some dark caramel notes and a full malt flavor. Barley. The beer is dry, and at times a little oily and slick.

3.95,1.3,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Found on half-price close-out at Prisco's grocery on Prairie in Aurora, IL. Pours a darker brown leaning a bit toward the yellow end of brown with a normal off-white head that retreats into a thin halo. Served at cellar temperature, it blooms with caramel and light roasted malts, like the complexity of a 120 L crystal malt, and dark fruit aromas. The flavor is true to the aroma, providing a rich full-bodied flavor adding complex bready and dark malt presence, a yeast character reminiscent of candied fruit and preserves, barely balanced by a lingering hop bitterness. Certainly a heavy beer, which is appropriate for the style, which definitely excludes it from the session beer club. Certainly one to seek in the single-bottle section for a cold winter night, or even a chilly summer night after a cold front has blown through.","MillRat","Jun 02, 2009"

Overall this had a nice flavor and good body. In typical English fashion, it was very clean and understated, but was easy and enjoyable to drink.

Any other spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, or allspice) remain muted and compliment the esters and phenols well. Medium maltiness and bitterness that linger into the aftertaste with a hint of nuttiness, cocoa, coffee, and spices that carry into the next sip.

4.23,8.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"D: Very drinkable - would be enjoyable in front of a nice warm fireplace. I don't think it would go well with a meal, but that's more personal preference.","ralree","Nov 25, 2007"
3.5,-10.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer poured a dark brown color and had a nice thick off white fluffy head to it. The smell was of roasted malts. It tasted of roasted malts with a nice slight hoppy finish. The mouthfeel was heavy with low carbonation. Overall drinkability was decent. Nice to drink when it is cold out.","Beerbuddha","Nov 18, 2007"
3.75,-3.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"16.9oz green flask-like bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a light tan head. The smell is roasted malt with touches of caramel and chocolate. The taste much like the aroma is dark roasted malts with a nice dose of hops in the finish. Overall, this is a very nice winter seasonal that I would not mind having again. Recommended.","cjgator3","Nov 07, 2007"
4.47,14.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability- I had to ramp up the drinkability on this one. It tastes delicious and is not over the top with alcohol. I could drink a lot of these all in one sitting. I'll be picking up another of these before the season is over.","blakesell","Oct 28, 2007"
3.83,-1.8,4.5,4,4,3,3.5,"drinkability is good. the alcohol is not present, and the brew is not heavy and filling. a decent winter brew, worth a try. cheers!","botham","Oct 19, 2007"
3.5,-10.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from the 500ml bottle into a New Belgium snifter. Body is a rich brown hue with ruby red highlights, topped by a small amount of fast-disappearing khaki-colored head. Aroma of nutty, slightly sweet malt and a touch of dark fruit (fig, raisin). Palate is malty and sweet up front, with the fruity notes coming through in the back of the mouth. Body is a touch thin for a stronger ale, and a mild warming from the alcohol follows down the throat on the swallow. A decent, drinkable winter warmer, although the price is a little steep.","ElGordo","Oct 16, 2007"
3.53,-9.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a small head that has a great lacing and never goes away. The color is black and hard to see through. The color is a reddish purple color when a small amount of light comes through. The smell is roasty with a slight chocolate note. The taste is slightly bready with coffee. Mouthfeel is good, not great, but not bad either. Smooth like water. I think this beer isn't very complex, but very very good. It was nice to have this one time, but for the price it won't be my new session beer.","Erdinger2003","Oct 11, 2007"
3.78,-3.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"D- Not too strong, but very bitter in the long run that gets more annoying as you go. Still, a decent brew from St. Peter's.","tapman","Sep 29, 2007"
3.53,-9.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"St. Peter's Winter Ale pours a deep, dark brown, in fact it's almost black with a ring of ruby around the bottom edge of the glass and a thick bone colored head. Poured from a beautiful green half liter bottle, this one is the new version, no longer flask shaped. Sweet malt is evident in the smell. Numerous flavors wash over my tongue, there is definitely a strong vinous nature, wood (oak?), caramel malt, perhaps a touch of spice and with a bitterness toward the end that rounds it out nicely. Not exactly what I expected, but rewarding nonetheless. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would like, but it may be appropriate for the style.","Drew966","Sep 17, 2007"
4.62,18.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"500 ml green bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. Very dark reddish brown colour, nearly black, nice brown head. LOVELY vinous aroma with oak, raisins, chocolate, roasted malts, liquorice, some coffee. The flavour has much of the same elements as the aroma, chocolate and sweet malts (but not too sweet) are in front. A roasty and hoppy bitterness in the aftertaste. Very full and rich mouthfeel. Blimey - this IS an excellent beer! LUVVERLY!","Sigmund","Mar 15, 2007"

Smell is very sweet, toffee, strawberries, some citrus, little bit of alcohol, minor roast.Taste is very sweet, some nice coffee/chocolate bitter roast through the middle, very pleasant, some vanilla, toffee finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with low carbonation, very smooth. Smell is not too pleasant, but the flavour is pretty nice, has a sweet stout kind of feel to it.","Viggo","Nov 28, 2006"

4.24,8.7,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"M&D: extremely smooth on the mouthfeel, lightly oily and lubricating down the palate... This winter ale is so flavoursome and vertical in terms of texture. I couldn't help wondering that the recipe of this beer is somehow connected to the same brewery's creamy stout... All in all, this is a very enjoyable, malty winter ale.","wl0307","Feb 06, 2006"
4.42,13.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a clear but very dark caramel color under a 1/2 finger tan head that fades fairly quickly to collar and spots of film, but still manages to leave a few strands of lace. The nose is full of chestnuts roasting on an open fire. The mouth is mildly carbonated and very sticky. The taste is excellent: sweet caramel and roasted nuts to start, followed by very nice, dry and crisp hops, leaving a slightly espresso bitter on the palate in the finish. The bitterness grows into the aftertaste, still very dry and crisp, inviting another sip. Good stuff.","Globetrotter","Dec 10, 2005"

3.78,-3.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"St. Peter winter ale. Probably should drink this in winter weather. But oh well. Pours a red, almost stained mahogany colour. Does let a bit of light through. About a one finger head that lasts. Lace sticks to the glass. Rather nice to look at. Big, malty bread smell. Bit of ripe fruits, some spice and an earthy hop smell as well. Taste is as close to liquid bread as I've ever experienced. Very malty, almost hearty beer. Some fruits and berries as well, with a bit of spice and earthy hops. Warming alcohol after each swallow almost soothes the throat. Pretty much a meal in a bottle. Mouthfeel is thick and reminds me a bit of pudding. Drinkable, though one usually satisfies for a while. As said, it's like a meal in a bottle.","slitherySOB","Jan 21, 2005"

3.7,-5.1,4,4,4,3,3,"An unusual muddy dark rum appearance with large bubbles. OK drink and hops and spices,burnt toffee, sweetish molasses, oily coffee but kind of doesn't work all together. A typical UK beer brought in by LCBO - their committee of 13 preference. A weak porter? Better warmer.","Sammy","Dec 25, 2004"
3.19,-18.2,2.5,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,"Bottle: Poured a dark brown/black ale with almost no carbonation and therefore no head. Aroma is mostly comprised of roasted malt. Taste is quite simply some roasted malt, with some bitterness at the end and a very light watery finish. The alcohol doesnÂ’t really show and the body is just above the average. Overall, this is not a bad beer but nothing great either; probably an improvement over some other beers I had from this brewery.","Phyl21ca","Dec 13, 2004"
4.37,12.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"St. Peter's Ale is an old family favourite, so let's try the Winter Ale shall we? Pours a wonderful black with red in the light with an off white head that dissipates into a sheen of foam and ring of bubbles. Aroma is a dry roasted barley smell, with some burnt smells. Taste was a nice dry roasted flavour, with some hoppy bitterness. Very full bodied, with a nice coffee-like finish. Mouthfeel was medium, with very little carbonation. I really enjoyed this, but I have always wondered, why the style is called "Winter Warmer"?","tatterdash","Dec 05, 2004"
3.9,0,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours black with cherry glints. There is no head at all and no real lace, it looks like old cask ale. The aroma is of plums, ripe cherries, some kind of spice and some fusel alcohol. The taste is unique. It starts out with a smokey roasty maltiness that quickly gives way to some medicinal notes and spicey alcohol. The hops are present in their bittering potential only. The mouthfeel is incredibly thick, in fact the body of this beer is reminiscent of motor oil. This is a very good winter warmer, super rich, thick and complex.","CAMRAhardliner","Dec 04, 2004"
4.04,3.6,3,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Aroma of roasted malts, raisins, coffee. Taste was superb. A rich, complex beer. Full of burnt coffee, smoke, caramel, licorice and molasses. Alcohol is warming. Mouthfeel is slick, moderately carbonated. Drinkability is alright, the smokiness is a bit much after a while.","baiser","Nov 27, 2004"
3.9,0,4,4,4,4,3.5,"From the green tinted St. PeteÂ’s 1/2 liter "medicine bottle: The pour was enticing...revealed a stark ruby red ale with a 1 finger off white fluffy cap that laces well...moderate corbonation. Interesting nose...musty cinnamon with roasty molasses smells. Has a nice oily mouthfeel and a presence like a spiced porter...lovely roastiness combined with spices, and burnt toffee sweetness, light cocoa tones...then the finish is drying with a leafy hop astringency mingling with a nice charred toast effect...and a slow warming. A very nice winter ale in the vein of a spicey warming porter. Recommended.","pootz","Nov 26, 2004"
4.64,19,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Very deep ruby red, minimal tan head, low carbonation (good in my opinion). Malty, spicy aroma. Malt, hops, caramel sweetness are all balanced, licorice and burnt caramel both come through strongly later on and lingers to form a flavoursome aftertaste. An excellent, hearty, warming winter brew that does exactly what it's designed to do without being overly strong in alcohol. Highly recommended.","Imbiber","Jan 31, 2004"
