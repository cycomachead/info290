"Serving type: bottle"
"Beautiful reddish amber. Great smell of honey, spice and nutmeg. The taste delivers the same spice goodness with an alcoholic bite, but just a small one. Very delicious. I'd certainly get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Copper in color. Bready nose. Malty flavor accompanied with cinnamon, nutmeg and other seasonal spices. There is also a hint of sweetness that is hard to place. The finish is semi-dry."

"Tough to review this up against Affilgem Noel and other superstar holiday treats. A solid holiday warmer for sure though."
""
""
""

"not a fan this year, look very bitter pine taste, little bit of a malt backing. Almost has a soap like taste"
""
""
""
""
"Served in a pint. Pours a deep, clear copper with a short off white head and minimal lacing. Rich, dulcet aroma, smells of honey, malts, brown sugars. Rich, smooth, mellow and sweet. Slight bitterness and warmth on the follow through. Full bodied, medium levels of carbonation, smooth finish. Overall, this is a jolly good beer and I'll probably have a few more this holiday."

"I usually do not like Winter Ale's but I received this as a gift and I really liked it. The spices really go well together to make this a great beer."
"My fav winter warmer. Would like to try their wee heavy (Wulver). This beer has a great look, nose, mouth feel and taste. Very well balanced without any dominating flavor. The finish is smooth. Everything a winter beer should be."

"This is everything a Christmas winter warmer should be...it's naughty (spicy) and nice (sweet) ...you can smell the spices but they really come alive in the taste...nutmeg, clove, cinnamon & gingerbread...she's got a bite! But the malt and honey sweetness balance it all out.  This is my new all time fave winter warmer...better than GL Christmas Ale...yup, I said it"

"O- Was expecting more from this as it's pretty highly regarded in the Winter Warmer category.  Has a little too much booze presence for my taste and the spices are kind of one-dimensional."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: a good winter seasonal, but a bit too much nutmeg for me.   Improved a little with warming."

"I did a side-by-side comparison with GLBC Christmas Ale this weekend & 12 Dogs was darker, spicier, less hoppy & the better Christmas Ale."

"12oz. bottle poured into  a snifter.  A reddish-brown color with a slight bubble to it.  Minimum head.  The smell is that of gingerbread, cinnamon and pinecones.  The taste is quite sweet, so if you like your christmas beer on the hoppy side, this one may not be for you.  The overwhelming taste, just like the smell, is the gingerbread, a touch of honey, & lots of spices present.  My palate not being the most defined in the world tastes cinnamon with a mixture of other tastes that i can't quite pinpoint.  No matter your palate though you can't get much closer to a taste that reminds you of Christmas. at 8.3% it's an easy drink and in my opinion is the most versatile ""winter warmer"" around, drink it Christmas morning as your family opens presents, enjoy it as a dessert beer after a holiday meal, or simply drink a couple to yourself as you watch a great sports game/movie/tv series etc on a cold winters day.  Cheers"

"12 Dogs Of Christmas Ale brewed by Thirsty Dog Brewing Company, with an ABV of 8.30% This brew pours out a light brown color with an off white head.  The smell is rich with spices and sweetness.  12 Dogs Of Christmas Ale put you in the mind set of Christmas cookies.  You also pick up a hit of grains and malts in the smell of this brew. The taste is rich with flavor, you pick up on the spices in this brew.  There is cinnamon and a hit of pumpkin spice.  This brew has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in it. The mouthfeel is nice and clean. 12 Dogs Of Christmas Ale is a great drinking brew.  Thirsty Dog Brewing Company did a nice job with this one. I would buy this brew again.  Overall I'm giving this brew a 4.25 out 5."

"O: Not a bad winter warmer, well spiced and refreshingly lacking in the hop arena. Just malt and spices, with some slight bitterness to the aftertaste. I am a fan."

"Starts off ok then has a bitter after  taste! Won't get again."

"The taste has many of the same herbal characteristics with the added touch of nutmeg, which I did not get in the aroma. Thin hop finish. Overall, not a bad beer."

"O - much better than most winter warms I've had. But reader beware if you don't want lots of spice, avoid."
"Try one, but if you can pick up a single in doing so, I would recommend that."
""
"O: A very enjoyable spiced beer, though I was hoping for more spices, especially the cinnamon, to stand out."
""
""
""
""
""

"Read on another beer site that this was similar in formula to Great Lakes Xmas Ale. Not even close."

"Pours a tawny brown with a tinge of amber,a thinner slight off white head atop.Aromas of nutmeg,mace,allspice,and some honey makes for a very spiced brew.I like the warming spiced notes on the palate,candied ginger and nutmeg notes stand out most along with a sweet honey-like finish.The sweetness is big but for me it never gets overly sticky.Solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a clear medium amber with a dark ruby hue. Nice head and lacing that retains well. Brilliant nose of cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg spice, over a light dark malt sweetness with just a hint of honey. Creamy almost medium body with average carbonation that imparts a bit of effervescence in the finish. The taste is like the nose - spice against a dark malt sweetness base. An exceptionally well balanced brew that covers the 8.3% alcohol very well. Finishes slowly with a nice spice flourish, just a touch of alcohol bite and a nice burst of honey sweetness. An outstanding winter offering."
"Overall this is certainly a winter warmer that defines the style. Great spice profile and very smooth body. Has the oomph of a strong winter beer with great drinkability."
""
""
""
"Overall an excellent winter warmer that you should seek out if youre a fan of the style. Liked it a lot."
""
"D - An interesting Winter Warmer... Lots of satisfying and redeeming qualities, but in the total this one is a bit less then the sum of its parts... Not a bad beer, but there's something subtle that doesn't quite compute with my palate... Perhaps it's a combination of a bit too much ginger and a mouthfeel that is slightly off... Again, not a bad beer, but far from my favorite winter warmer..."

"From a bottle. Pours reddish brown with a foamy 4-inch head that dissipates rather quickly, but has good lacing. Aromas of cinamon, raisin, ginger, pumpkin spice, caramel malt. Creamy mouthfeel with flavors of brown sugar, caramel, cinnamon, vanilla and ginger. Candy-like finish of spiced milk chocolate and a whisper of honey with a slight hop bite. This is better than many Christmas ales out there. Nicely done."

"Most people don't know this, but this recipe was brought by a brewer from Great Lakes Brewing Company. This is an incredible brew. This is hands down my favorite christmas ale. It is full of flavor, but it's not overly filling like most christmas ales."
""
"Poured deep brown/mahogany. Slight beige head that didn't last long. A rich gingerbread aroma, some cinnamon in the nose too. Had to let the beer warm up to get that though. The flavor is bready with lots of darker malts, perhaps chocolate, but mostly crystal. The cinnamon pops up for a second but is quickly diminished. Very smooth. Not shabby. I would like to age a couple of these to see how it evolves over a couple years."
""
""
""
""
"I found this is at Jungle Jim's near Cincinnati, and I'm assuming the bottle is old but I can't find a date. This is an enjoyable winter warmer that is heavy on spices but isn't overly sweet as some winter warmers tend to be. Specifically, ginger, nutmeg, brown sugar, and cinnamon, in that order, stand out. The smell is even better than the taste. The alcohol is concealed better in the taste than maybe any beer I've ever tried, and that makes this one dangerous, especially considering how easy it goes down. The mouthfeel is on the thinner side and the carbonation is fairly low. For as much as there is going on, it finishes clean. Overall, this is a very good winter warmer that I would probably enjoy even more during the right season. I can't help but compare this to Great Lakes' Christmas Ale, which is much sweeter and a bit better, but both are recommended."

"Overall- Better than most christmas beers out there. It does not try and overpower you with sweet and cinnamon flavors. It has a nice offering of malt taste and seems to have good body. Overall this is an enjoyable beer and would recommend to anyone who is an avid christmas ale drinker."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It is a solid Christmas ale. It has all the characteristics one would associate with Christmas. A little past the season but it is still good."
""
""
""
""
"Taste is thick, malty, and syrupy. The sweet cinnamon and spice essence is most prominent with this heavy-bodied, rich, and fairly complex holiday ale. Seems a bit too heavy-handed for my taste, though, and this is not one I'd pursue again."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, Winter 2012 bottling. Pours lightly hazy red-orange amber color with a nice 1-2 finger dense off white head with nice retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big honey, caramel, ginger, raisin, nutmeg, cinnamon, toast, light clove, and light herbal. Damn nice aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of caramel, toast, ginger, honey, raisin, apple, cinnamon, nuttiness, and light herbal. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, honey, ginger, cinnamon, raisin, apple, and nuttiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of malt/spice flavors; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming present on the finish. Overall this is an excellent winter warmer. Nicely balanced and robust flavors with good complexity; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering as expected; this is definitely the better offering vs the GL version."

"Merry Christmas!!! Trying the 12 Dogs of Christmas Ale...the beer poured a clear deep rich amber...almost brown....with a thin slightly off-white head that is not leaving much lace. The scents are quite nice...honey, cinnamon, giner and nutmeg....just like the bottle says. The taste starts with honey for sure, then the hops and alcohol begin to add a bitterness that makes the taste turn to pine needles. The mouthfeel is full bodied with subtle carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer and winter warmer is a good description...probably would not do more than one a night....just alot going on and the ABV is butt-kicking."

"O: Still not exactly sure how to describe a Christmas ale, but this is the best one I’ve had yet. I don’t know what it is, but this is a beer for the season – and one that will certainly put a smile on your face."
""
""
"O. Great for the style. I was a little put off by the overpowering nutmeg flavor, but overall this is solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - pretty light looking/feel. Nice aroma but a bit faint, very tasty/sweet. Overall everything is good just a little faint. Then again at 8.3% that's really impressive, 4 for that"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Got this Dog on tap poured into a Sniffer. It looks hazy brown with good head retention. It smells of nutmeg, cinnamon and a nice refreshing almost pine smell. It tastes fantastic with notes of all spice, cinnamon and nutmeg throughout. Each flavor is distinct, but work so well together. The mouthfeel is great, creamy yet carbonated and goes down smooth. Overall its a great beer, one of the best Christmas beers around! All I want for Christmas is 12 beers a pouring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Again, easy drinking throughout. Medium to full mouthfeel with some ginger left on the palate to compliment the residual caramel. As expected there is some pretty lacing. Sneaky alcohol though. It would be very easy to put a few of these away. This is easily my favorite offering from Thirsty Dog Brewing Co."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like it. It does remind me of the holidays. High alcohol is nicely warming. You need to be in the mood for something this spicy, but when you are this one is delicious. Probably best to share, I don't think you would want too many."
""
""
"Mouthfeel is nice- medium body, smooth feel, light to moderate soft carbonation. I like this one and I would recommend it to those looking for a nice accompaniment to desert or just a nice beer for a cold winter day (do we even get those anymore?)."
""
""
"This poured out as a clear looking orange red color with a nice looking white head on top. The retention and lacing were both very nice on this beer. The smell of the beer is slightly sweet with a subtle spicy note on the nose as well as a faint orange zest aroma too. The taste of the beer as a nice sweet honey flavor upfront that settles into a nice citrusy spicy warming flavor. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side and a little oily, a decent carbonation and it's sticky and finished dry. Overall I though it was a really good brew actually."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a chalice, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like toasted malt, nutmeg, honey, and cinnamon. Luckily the spice comes out more in the flavor of this beer. It tastes like nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, honey, and toasted malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, $10.99 a 6-pack."
""
""
"Not a favorite in our camp. didnt taste any spices, just hops and honey. Honey overpowers every spice and flavor. Tasted to us like a typical i.p.a. with ALOT of honey. disappointed"

"O- not a bad christmas ale, this is an above average and i would like another."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. As expected, the spices were the main component but everything worked together quite nice. I can't say that I would take down several of these but in the festive spirit of the seasons I would no doubt try this again."
""
""
"It's heavy on the spice so if thats not your thing you may not like it, but a great drink on a cold winter night."

"I bought 3 of these winter warmers this year, and I think it was 2 too many. They're a bit sweet and cloying for my tastes. Still, this was a very nice beer and a nice sipper on a chilly night."
""
"Dark golden in color with a very light head even when pouring into the middle of the glass. The smell is wonderful fresh ginger and nutmeg. A great balance of what a Christmas Ale should taste like. First taste in malts and cinamon, then comes the ginger. Finishing with just enough kick and some nutmeg on the end. This one hits you on all sides of the mouth. Overall and great beer for this time of year and earlier. For those who live in Cleveland this has become the new Great Lakes Christmas all that we remember from 2008."
""
""
"The great debate here in Ohio is Great Lakes Christmas Ale or Thirsty Dog 12 Days of Christmas. I don't really want to decide. Both are outstanding and make anyone look forward to Christmas. You can't go wrong with either."
""
"A very Christmasy Ale."
""
""
""
""
"Filtered, pours out to a clear chestnut, forming a limpid off yellow head with poor retention and sparse lacing. Moderate carbonation. The aroma opens with some subtle biscuit malt and toast, then is followed by an overwhelming spice note...mostly cinnamon and ginger. The mouthfeel is clean with a medium body. Taste is potent with spices, too much for my tastes. I like the more balanced examples of the style, like Great Lakes BC. This is way over the top. Bitterness is mild. Not much more to comment on here. If you like strongly spiced beers, you'll probably like this. I don't."
"Very dark amber in appearance, nice and clear. Smell Smell has a nice blend of spices for a winter warmer. Mouthfeel, this beer tends to lay in the back of the mouth, not anything that would stop us from having one or two.... Taste is very nice and mixed well for a winter warmer; great on a good cold night. We know had a few when it was 19 degrees out. Overall this is a nicely done winter warmer and one we feel you need to have. Oh goes great with leftover turkey."
"Overall, this is exactly what I would want when I think of a Winter Warmer."
""
"D: This drinks very much like Ohio's more famous winter warmer, Great Lakes Christmas Ale. This drinks a little maltier, and has a more diverse cast of spices (whereas GLCA is quite gingery). A thoroughly enjoyable winter seasonal."
""
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Pours a deep amber color with medium white head. Aroma is of cinnamon, nutmeg, a hint of clove and raisins. Flavors from generous amounts of toasted and caramel malts, mixed with equally generous amounts of honey, cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. Medium sticky mouthfeel. Very nice winter warmer!"
""
"O- Overall this is a very good Christmas Ale. Very likeable and drinkable. A bit spicier than most-but thats how I like it."
""
""
"O: This is what a Christmas ale should taste like. A little on the tart side but tasty as can be."
"Overall I think this is a good winter warmer, it has a lot to offer in terms of spices but I am not sure I would want another. The malt is heavy enough and the spices might become too much after a while."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I thought that this was a good Winter Warmer that had a little different twist on the traditional spice profile you get in most Winter Warmers and they weren't overpowering like some of them tend to be. This beer doesn't have the greatest drinkability, I think the spices would wear on me after more then one bottle, one of these is the perfect amount, after that it is time for something else. What I liked most about this beer was the spice profile and the balance, they were pretty unique and didn't get too out of hand, the alcohol was also hidden very well. What I liked least about this beer was the appearance, the color was nice but the head was pretty lack luster and was hardy there. I would buy a six pack of this too keep around for the holidays. but I couldn't see buying more then that. I recommend this beer to any Winter Warmer fan, the spices are there but they aren't over the top. This was another good beer from Thirsty Dog, I find the that the key with this style is the balance and thankfully this beer had the right amount of balance. Another solid beer from Thirsty Dog, I like the slight twist that they put on their beers to make them stick out a little, I'm down to try more of what these guys have to offer."
"Overall, I really enjoyed it, as a Christmas seasonal, I think it's great."
"Overall, this is a nice flavorful beer. I'm thinking this is a winter warmer of some sort. I'd happily drink this one again, this is pretty tasty. Sold B beer, just like 80% of every other beer on BA."
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. The spices are there, but not overwhelming. Very tasty!"
"O- This is a nice Christmas ale. It gets compared a lot to the Great Lakes Christmas Ale, I give the edge to Great Lakes on this one, but I don't think they are very similar. 12 Dogs is much more gingerbread and nutmeg forward, while Great Lakes is more cinnamon forward."
""
""
""
"Pours a deep clear amber with off white head and recedes to a fine layer. Aromas of brown sugar like malt, gingerbread, cinnamon and nutmeg. In the taste, more of the same, cinnamon, some nutmeg, sugary malt, faint date notes as well. Warming alcohol is felt but absent in the taste. Medium bodied mouthfeel with a small dry spice. Overall, a fine sipper and a good example of a winter warmer."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is a pretty tasty winter ale. I was given a few bottles for free. Waited until the ground was snow covered to bust one out. Glad I got to try this. Might pick up a couple of bottles every year."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear reddish copper color with a one finger tannish head which gives way to skim and leaves little lace. The aroma is of nutmeg, cinnomon, and clove. The taste follows suit. There is a big nutmeg and cinnomon flavor. It is nice but not complex. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated. Overall it is solid a good beer for the class but not the best."
""
""
"Body is light, and the alcohol is lost in the spices. Just like Christmas Ale, it catches up to you at 8.3%. Ohio knows its spiced winter beers!"
"O: This isn't a terrible beer, but is definitely wildly uneven."
""
""
"If you are a fan of GL Christmas Ale, you will probably like this beer a bit, but in my opinion it's not as complex nor as good. Just too much clove for my taste."
""
"The taste was a very strong mixture of cinnamon, brown sugar, and nut meg. Not only were there many flavors but it was a crisp. The alcohol did not really linger in my mouth for too long."
""
""
""
"Poured from a twelve ounce bottle into my imperial pint glass. Nice looking beer, dark brown with a silky head. Nose has malts and some spices as well. What I like about this winter warmer is that it show cases the malts rather than the spices. Not overly spiced that is my dear boy. Nice medium body is well carbonated to boot!"
""
"Dark amber in color with white head that develops a mist over top. Aroma of cinnamon, spices, caramel, and slight apple. Tastes of apple skins, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, then booze comes in and slicks the palate. Light in body with medium carbonation. A boozy winter warmer."
""
""
"Overall - I liked it a lot. This beer and GL Christmas Ale are often compared to one another. If you desire a sweeter Christmas Ale, go GL, if you want a little bit more malty and bitter one, then this one is for you. Both a fine in their own right. Solid winter warmer here."
""
""
""
""
"4.0 D: Really nice example of what this style can offer. I love ginger and this one delivers plenty of it. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability: I remember hearing that this beer was created by someone involved in inventing the original Great Lakes Christmas Ale, and this one was a copy of the original with some extras spices thrown in. I had the GL Chirstmas Ale again night and after that tasting last night, I can say that the two beers are quite different. This one is much sweeter, has a bit more boozy flavor to it that is quite noticeable, and the ginger in the Great Lakes makes it quite different than this one. Interestingly, both seem to have a tea-like bitter finish (same hops?) So now that I'm done comparing the two, what do I think? Definitely a winter warmer, but I'm not crazy about the solventy notes I get through the whole drink, even after it warmed up. The cinnamon and nutmeg are a nice touch, and it definitely warmed me up this evening so this is a Winter Warmer, just not a great one in my opinion. Something about that solvent smell and taste I'm not really enjoying I guess, but otherwise an interesting one to try."
"O - This is one of only a few winter warmers I've tried. It's really a darn good beer, and should be tried if you have access to it. Well priced at $10.99 a sixer for a imperial-esque beer. I'll probably snag another six this holiday season. Another solid one from Thirsty Dog."
"O: Tasty, nice to sit by the fire and sip."
"Medium to full bodied, its a little thicker than expected. This was a surprise, but a pleasant one. The carbonation isn't really there, but thats not a problem."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability - Medium-bodied. I remember complaining about a slightly metallic taste last year. Thankfully, that seems to be missing from this years tasting. A good amount of spice. A good brew from Thirsty Dog, but not my favorite holiday brew."
"O- I think I will buy it again... It should be noted that this beer competes directly with Columbus brewing company winter warmer and great lakes Christmas ale. In Columbus it will be. A close call between this beer and Columbus winter warmer."
"O: Pretty good overall, nothing truly special but good."
"O - I really like this beer, a great Christmas ale, the spices are exceptional"
"O-not at all what I was expecting. not very good to me. again, maybe just a bad bottle. I'll need a fresh one. but thats hard since they dont date the bottles"
"Great X-mas Ale! Slight notes of Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Clove and Honey make this taste like Christmas is right around the corner! 8% doesn’t hurt either! I do not think it is as good as the 2009 batch, as for the 2010 batch there is no comparison this years batch is excellent! Tasted the B.A. 12 Dogs at Blues and Brews....Amazing!!! Hopefully the Akron area will see a couple of those kegs this winter!"
"Overall I really need to try this fresh since something just isn't clicking maybe the toasted malt, hops, or ginger but I feel it would taste better fresh. Very hard to tell though since they don't date their bottles..."
"Good Xmas Ale. A quick up and comer in my experience. Great look and smell. very sweet and cinnimiiny smell. warms you up quick. gives your lips a bit of a tingle. goes great with sweets including xmas cookies or something more on the saltier side. Every year I find I am having more of a craving for 12 Dogs than Great Lakes"
"red brown with a big cream colored head, that was thick and long lasting. Smelled deeply of malt and spices, nutmeg and almost a cinnamon. Taste was a little thin. The spiceness was definatly there and actually felt a bit warm going down. Great mouthfeel as the carbonation was pretty much perfect. Very very drinkable,"
"O - While I am indeed looking forward to fall seasonals, Pumking and the like, I can't but help to gaze slightly further in the coming seasons and await these winter warmers with surmounting anticipation."
"Beer tastes a little like tree sap, pine needles with nutmeg, the pine is quite forward throughout the beer. Interesting, if this were labeled IPA nad tasted like resin I may even like it but this isn't hoppy, it tastes like spruce extract almost. Interesting, I suppose but not a repeat for me."
"Pours a dark amber-bronze color with a pretty good white head and a nice collar throughout. Some spotty lacing. The nose brings some light cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavor has the cinnamon and nutmeg as well, but with the addition of a good amount of pine. Medium body and a really dry finish. Decent enough, but not something I'd go back to."
"Overall a pretty good Christmas beer, but nowhere near one of the best."
"A benchmark Winter Warmer."
"D a very drinkable beer, made better if it is cold outside. Although this beer's flavor would seem better suited for fall than winter."
"M/D: Somewhat light on the tongue. After such a strong spicy smell I was slightly cautious of this beer. However, I found it to be rather drinkable ( especially @ 8% )."
"The almost light body and medium carbonation accentuate the spices of the beer and really bring it together. Honestly, I am disappointed that I did not get this when Christmas time was around. It would have gone great during Christmas Eve, and I definitely could have finished a six pack of this impressive beer. Probably my favorite winter warmer of the season, granted the recency effect does play a role..."
"D - Yummy seasonal brew that blends the malts and spices in a very attractive way. An evening with several of these would be quite enjoyable. This is the GL Christmas Ale's big brother. As good as the GL is, this shouldn't be overlooked - it's every bit as good."
"I liked this, but I don't see why people love GL Christmas Ale so much more than it. 12 Dogs of Christmas is almost the same beer in terms of flavor, as far as I am concerned. Pours a mahogany red with little off-white head. Nose is of spices with some sweet malt thrown in. Taste follows with spices, sweet malt bill, and more spices. Maybe a bit of herbal hops on the finish. Tastes like GL Christmas, but maybe a bit more refined. Decent mouthfeel, medium, ample carbonation. Decent drink overall, not a bad beer by any means, but I am a bit tired of all the Christmas beers by now."
"Pours a clean amber color with a small off white head. In the aroma, sweet and spicy, with a few honey like notes. In the taste, spicy, cinnamon primarily, and some hints of clove like honey. A spice bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry cinnamon in the aftertaste. Kind of average, big cinnamon, hints of honey, but it does hide the alcohol."
"D- overall this is I think the best Christmas Ale I have had. Extremely drinkable and my mouth hit the floor when I saw this was 8.3% alcohol... Drinks like a 5-6% beauty... Will buy again and that alone says a lot for myself..."
"This beer gets compared to GL Christmas Ale alot, alot of similarites. Thirsty Dog's is more of a dessert beer if you will. Christmas in a bottle. Perfect for the holidays.. recommened!"
"D- At first I thought this was really going to be a one and done. I even noted that it might be difficult to spread a six-pack over the season. However, it kind of grew on me by the end. It's a good holiday nightcap. I'm glad I tried it, and would drink it again when I'm looking for a spicy holiday brew."
"Pours into a brownish red amber color with a small white head that quickly disappears. It has decent carbonation, pretty good retention and decent lacing. The smell is a pleasant mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves. When tasting it I get the cinnamon, and nutmeg with a little bit of honey followed by some cloves, and malts with a gingery after taste. It is a very well balanced beer, and can hardly taste the alcohol in it. It has a nice smooth feel to it that leaves a dry chalky feeling with some tart bitterness in the mouth, and it is quite drinkable for being on the dry side. I think that this may be the beginning of a new annual X-mas drink for me. Merry X-mas to all at Beer Advocate (even though I said it a day late)."
"The tastes all go together well and this is easy to drink...maybe a little too easy for something so high in alcohol...8.3%."
"Definitely festive, warms the tummy, but not my favorite winter ale."
"D - goes down too easy for a beer over 8% abv."
"Poured into a tall glass, It appears a lighter amber color with almost no head on an aggressive pour. I smell a faint cherry smell with a high malt smell. it goes down like a lager, but finishes like the ale it is. Taste is a nice sweet malt taste with a hint of cherrys as well. This is a VERY drinkable beer as it has little to no bitter finish. All and all a VERY pleasant beer to enjoy!"
"This is a very good beer. Its not that any of the categories we rate on were a huge winner, but the fact that this brew had something different about it. It was very wasy to drink, despite the higher ABV that its carries. This brew was nice and sweet, and gives a nice warming feel without the heavy alcohol burn. Great representation of the style."
"Thirsty Dog did a nice job with 12 Dogs of Christmas. It's a pretty solid Winter Warmer that's unique in that the spices linger in the background rather than hog the spotlight. If you're somewhat spice averse, and like malty beer, 12 Dogs should be right up your alley. It's not a great holiday release, but it's pretty darn good."
"Can NOT tell that this is 8.5% ABV - this one could get you in trouble. Very quaffable, and zero aftertaste."
"T - A pretty bold but smooth taste, definite cherry taste"
"D- A unique beer that may rival any of the Anchor Christmas ales I have tried. The alcohol is well hidden. Worth trying."
"Had this as a comparison of christmas ales. 12 oz bottle poured into a small 4 oz taster glass. Poured a copper color with some tan head that disappears. Aroma was nutmeg and cinnamon. Taste was very similar with a warming mouthfeel that was medium. Very good winter warmer that i thought gave great lakes a run for the money."
"Overall a very nice Christmas beer that has all the key/featured spices of the season present and accounted for. I personally would have liked to have tasted a bit more honey and smidge less cinnamon, but that's splitting hairs. Reminds me of a darker, rounder and creamier version of Great Lakes Christmas Ale, which is saying ALOT in my book!"
"Mouthfeel is pretty full, drinkability would lend itself to one a night in the right company of the holiday season. Fireplaces and whatnot."
"D- Good drinkability. I was pretty happy with this one."
"D: Was really happy with this beer, keeps tasting better & better as you go on, not to mention it has 8.3 ABV but it's not overpowering. You could easily drink ""to many of these"". Excellent ""Winter Warmer"" HIGHLY recommended!!"
"Not nearly as good as Great Lakes version, this still does the job and could be had in greater quantities before succumbing to cinnamon fatigue... some holiday ales can get out of control. Worth a try for sure."
"D: One drink leads to another and they keep tasting better, nice to cellar and store for a while. Mine was a good 8 months old and the 8.3 ABV is not overpowering but offers a great balance for a great beer."
"Color is dark copper red, off-white head dissipates quickly. Smell is all spice, I'm picking up mostly cinnamon. Taste is very nutmeg-like, with an ultra smooth honey finish. A good twist of dryness and satiation. I could drink more than a few of these. All in all, a damn good beer for this style."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Pours a one finger cream head that fades very slowly to a thin layer, leaving a good lace. Clear amber color. Malty nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor is malty cider and caramel. $2.00 for a 12oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Pours a nice slightly hazy golden brown color, nice carbonation, small fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of caramel, nutmeg/cinammon notes. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, lots of caramel notes, a very nice touch of nutmeg/cinammon. Medium body. Drinkable, a pretty tasty brew."
"D - Good drinkability. I was pretty happy with this one; worth a shot."
"An Ohoove special once again. This one appears ruby mahogany colored, clear but dark with a fair light tan head and great webs of lacing. The aroma suggests malty ginger and allspice/ nutmeg. The flavor brings a delightful ginger on malty allspice, almost a menthol or minty effect. It's mid/light bodied, very spritzy with lively bubblage and very drinkable. Really just a classic holiday flavor with oranges and malt blended into the traditional spices. Very smoothly blended, very much a holiday hit not to be missed."
"Okay, quick recap - very nice, especially for a Winter Warmer. Lots of spices, very warming with a fairly full mouthfeel. Worth seeking out, especially at this time of year."
"A pretty damn amazing Winter Warmer ... impressive is the first word that comes to mind. Complex yet dangerously drinkable as well."
"Drinkability: Woof. One to try, provided you're a fan of the spiced brews, though of the spice beers I encountered this winter, I still think Lakefront's Holiday Spice Lager Beer, much to my surprise, was my favorite."
"Not a great winter warmer, but not a bad one. Certainly anything 8.3 can be warming, but this one does add a good use of spice. I am still puzzled over the lack of honey. I just don't see that it added anything to this beer. Certainly a one and done beer."
"Drinkability: The beer itself reminds me in some ways to other seasonal beers especially the pumpkin ones. The spices are not too overpowering and really nice. However, as is the case with most seasonal beers I feel its a session beer. One is good, two at the most. Overall really nice beer though."
"Thirsty Dog has added another impressive beer to their lineup. Not the best Christmas Ale, but easily in the top 5. Its hard to beat out Great Lakes, Hoppin Frog or Anchor."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Sensory pint. Poured a translucent copper with a quarter inch, tan-colored head the quickly dissipated into a sudsy, broken film. Mild nose - some nutmeg, cinnamon and perhaps a dash of allspice (not quite pumpkin spice, but well on the road). Taste consistent with nose; your classic winter warmer, but not as cloying. Mouthfeel is medium-light and lively. Very respectable for a Winter Warmer. Not a style I usually grab for, but the subtleties and the well-hidden alcohol makes for an enjoyable seasonal."
"(D)- A basically good beer to have around for the holidays. Not too shabby in the flavor department, but I would rather grab another than this one in the style; enjoyable enough."
"Final Thought: Solid seasonal from a very solid brewery!"
"Nice Christmas beer if you are looking for something with a lot of spice."
"All in all, this brew surprised me. I didn't expect it too be as smooth and refreshing as it is. This is a great brew to have after a nice long winter day at work. Not too heavy or too light and very refreshing. Have this if you like the hoppiness to be masked some by flavor."
"The drink is a tad lighter in body than my ideal winter warmer would have, but that factor coupled with mild carbonation enhance the drinkability score quite a bit. The essential internal warming element is not in doubt at all."
"Drinakbility is much better than the average spiced X-Mas beer, but is still second to Great Lakes."
"Overall, this is a very good holiday beer/winter warmer. It's up there in alcohol content, but that doesn't really overpower in the flavor. The aroma is good, and much of that is tasted in the flavor. One of the best I've had so far this season."
"D-it is an ok beer that doesn't show the high alcohol so it is drinkable, but it is average imo"
"Medium body, good carbonation. Alcohol is hidden well. Very enjoyable."
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a murky light brown with a decent off-white head. Aroma is burnt caramel malts, cinnamon and slight hops. The taste is burnt caramel malts in front with a slight alcohol presence and mild cinnamon and spice. The beer is medium bodied with a bit more boozy alcohol than I'd prefer, but not too overbearing. This is a decent winter warmer, but not one I'd likely try again."
"Drinkability: Would be great for a cool winter night, probably my second favorite winter warmer/Christmas ale right behind Great Lakes. Not really a sessionable beer, but I would definitely get through a couple of these in a night."
"D- Easy drinking. The fact that this is 8.3% is pretty impressive. It drinks, in every way, like a 4.5% slightly spiced winter warmer. I don't love this one, but certainly not a bad beer and amazingly deceptive."
"Mouth feel is medium with some carbonation. A nice example of a spicy holiday brew!"
"The right amount of spice can really add to the taste experience, but over spicing may often detract. IMO, the 12 Dogs of Christmas is over spiced."
"Drinkability is also very good, on a cold Ohio night with snow coming down, if you are lucky enough to have one of the 12 Dogs of Christmas, your night will be improved markedly! Highly recommended, as good or better than GLBC Christmas Ale IMO, priced about the same in NE OH...go for this one if you have the chance!"
"six-pack from Heinen's in Chagrin Falls"
"Cheers!"
"Taste-Big onrush of spices, mostly nutmeg, some honey sweetness and caramel-Abit heavy on the spices, leading to a rather acidic, unbalanced finish. Definite sipper."
"Drinkable, as much as any beer with this much going on. A sipper, not from the ABV but due to spiciness and ginger bite."
"Notes: very tasty brew reflecting the spirit of the season. light, sweet and spicy."
"D: Wow. The alcohol is very well masked. You will feel it but you won't taste it."
"drinkability: very nice - even worked as a tailgater!"
"Thirsty Dog 12 Dogs Of Christmas Ale isn't as good as Great Lakes Christmas Ale, but it's a pretty good effort all the same. If I still lived in the Buckeye State, I'd probably buy a sixer of this and two sixers of GL's version every December. Definitely worth a look."
"Sounds a bit harsh, but most Winter Warmers fall into this overly-sweet, artificially-spiced catagories. The beer is par of the course and delightful when in the mood for heavy sweetness and varying spices."
"Eric"
"Overall 12 Dogs Of Christmas Ale presents the seasonal category well but also is versatile to be sipped on any occasion."
"Pleasant aroma, some dissipitating white cloudy head on cloudy yellow body.Mouthfeel is a tad above average, although tingling from carbonation though it was not apparent or obtrusive. Honey and some spices, nothing too much. Spice and lagerish taste really.Pleasant."
"It was ok. Winter beers have to come with something special, especially because of what's available. This one didn't cut it. As a side note... for as sweet as it was, I really wish there was more to the nose."
"Drinkability: A solid if slightly overly-spiced winter warmer. The constituent parts are good, just out of balance. Cut the ginger back a few notches and you'd have a really good beer, perhaps not quite sessionable at 8.3%, but a good in-front-of-the-fire, Christmas-time sorta beer."
"Drinkability was good, light on the ABV, nice and tasty, although I would not drink more than one or two fo these."
"Overall, it's a decent beer but certainly not a replacement for either Great Lakes or Barley's Christmas Ales. The three are similiar - the thing that makes this one different is the nutmeg and the booziness of the brew. If you're into either one of those features, then by all means go for this brew. Otherwise, it's a solid beer but not one that I'd buy year after year."
"Poured a medium to deep amber color wth an averaged sized off whtie head. Aromas of caramel and spices - all kinds, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and some others. Tastes of the same spices, caramel, and toasty. Definitelhy a spice beer. Alcohol content well hidden as I just noticed it was +8%."
"D: 8.3%? Look out! There is no hint of the gravity here, and it certainly catches up to you. I can certainly see myself going through a few of these in a sitting. I can't wait to enjoy the rest of the 6."
"D- This beer isn't bad for a christmas beer but the more I drink the more I cant get that pine taste out, yea too much pine."
"Good drinkable beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, balanced spicing with a warming alcohol sensation in the swallow."
"Out of a mixed 6-pack from Liberty St. Tavern. Yeah, the spices are heavy, but paired with a god Christmas cookie, it's quite tasty. There's a overwhelming presence of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger over a sweet, caramel roll malt profile and mellow, but spicy, hops finish. There's no hint of alcohol and if you don't mind the spice, this is a tasty winter treat."
"D- again, not a fan of eastern baking spice in beer but, in the eastern spiced winter warmer category it fares about the same as its butt buddy, just balanced in a differrent way."
"Tried it on tap and boy was it delicious. The smell was very inviting and so the moment I got my nose right down in there, I knew this one was going to be good. Although I think some of the spices could of been toned down a bit it didn't bother me much and i enjoyed the flavor all the way through. I have heard rumors that the 12 dogs recipe is the old great lakes Christmas Ale recipe before they made some alterations. Not sure if it's true but this one is definitely worth trying."
"Just like the Harpoon Winter Warmer,..this Beer is awful!!! It's like drinking a liquid Christmas tree. The piney taste and over spiced taste makes this brew hard to swallow. The smell is actualy not that bad but, it is the calm before the storm. Not impressed at all."
"Appears a dark chestnut brown hue with a large off white khaki head with fine intricate lacing between each sip, retention is decent. Aroma offers up a nice mix of Christmas spices, according to the label it says honey cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. What stands out to me is the spicy ginger along with earthy and pine hops, of course a strong honey sweetness rides in the sidecar. Very complex and full of Christmas senses, supposedly the same recipe as the Great Lakes Christmas ale according to a recent thread, rumor? I'm not sure but it smells pretty close. Flavor is nice spices play nice with bitter and spicy edges, I'm getting Christmas spiced bread with powdered yeast drizzled with honey and caramel, let's not forget spruce tips and a raw earthy bitterness with just a touch of booziness about it. I can't believe this brew is scoring in the middle of the road category, because it's fantastic. I'm ready for a whole sixer better yet a mixed sixer half Great Lakes Christmas Ale and half of this fine brew. Mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied with some thicker textures joining the party, some honey and some rough spice induced bitterness in the finish. Also some soothing alcohol burn that makes the whole experience work a little better, and drinkability wise it's pretty easy to drain a 12 ounce pour if you let your palate adjust to the honey and spices. Throw a cigar into the mix and it will hold up equally as well."
"Pours a clear, dark copper color with a 3/4 inch head. Good lacing on the glass as I drink it. The taste is everything listed onthe bottle. This beer tastes like Christmas. It is similar to Great Lakes Christmas Ale. Cinnamon, nutmeg and in the background, honey and ginger. It is too high in alcohol to be a session beer, but the alcohol is hidden behind those spices. I like Old Leghumper from Thirsty Dog and now this one. It might be time to revisit their beers."
"So today I try 12 Dogs for the first time and also find out that they are local. I generally like spiced ales a lot (I like everthing). I've had a lot of Great Lake's Christmas Ale already this season. It is outstanding. 12 Dogs tastes very similar to the Great Lakes (to me). I will have to do a side by side taste test some day. The Thirsty Dog has more spice and not as creamy a finish. I wonder what it is like on tap. It would be great if it were a little stronger - really strong. Then all that spice could be hiding 12% alcohol."
"Pours a relatively clear, darker shade of amber with minimal head. Not much lacing to mention. Smells VERY strongly of nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice. Smells of relatively nothing but holiday-like spices, and very strongly. Taste is much the same...strong nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, subtle hop spice...malty. Decent carbonation, medium bodied. Very sweet and spicy. One bottle is enough. Not totaly impressed."
"Pours a kinda thin head that goes down quickly, no lacing. Scents of cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla bristle through. Tastes very much as to what it smells like. Very pleasant and easy drinking with nice spices. Not a beer you can guzzle, but nice to have one around the fireplace. Deceptively strong, beware and be careful. True to the style of this spicey beer."
