"Good malty body with grain and significant nuttiness. Barley, tea leaves and pecans are off set by light ginger and nutmeg. It has a very bitter finish and it knocks it down a bit but overall it's an enjoyable beer."
"WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH SPICE!"
"Good, strong winter beer. Reasonable on the spices. Would buy it again."
"A pretty average, run-o-the-mill  produced beer."

"Six pack enjoyed during January 2015"

"The medium body is crisp all the way and pretty smooth with lots of dryness in the middle to end and a lingering finish where that steely note is also evident."

"Taste-Toasted malt, orange, nutmeg, cinnamon, followed by a nice little hop bite. Well-balanced, tasty and refreshing despite the rather high ABV. Very nice."

"Slightly surprised with the amount of hops for a winter beer and being as dark and roasty as it is on the nose. Its a nice beer all around, not a ton of complexity although the mix of caramel in the malt and the bitterness in the hops does make for a nice combination it was just a little short on the complexity side."

"This was strong but never felt it until I made my way through the beer itself. The alcohol was well-hidden and what was noticeable went all with the apple and skunky hops and lack of overbearing spice. This almost reminded me of a Green Flash beer but this wasn't as hoppy, although the bitterness here was more present than I expected. Hopheads looking for a Winter Seasonal will enjoy this, as this packed enough of a punch to go with the nice range of flavors that meshed well together. Quite a nice surprise here!"

"This is the third Cisco offering I've reviewed, and it's one of my favorites. Basically everything I'd want from a winter. Perfect mix of smoke, spice, and cinnamon. More of a smokey nose to it. This is my first time trying a brag got, but if these are the qualities of the genre I'll definitely be searching for more. Brownish hue with a light brownish tan head. Loved it."
""
"What a lovely winter seasonal we have here, well balanced and inviting."
""
"Admittedly, I am not familiar with Braggots and this style. I wish I was, so I had something to compare to. You gotta respect the 8+% ABV, but my initial response is that I would likely pass on this one in the future."
"Pours billowing tan head. Nice head retention and lacing. Aromas of caramel, pine , cinnamon and spice. Deep dark amber / garnet in color. Sweet roasted malt, nutmeg flavors with piney bitterness balance. Subtle spice lingers into a bitter and hoppy finish. All together well balanced and remarkable drinkable at 8.5%"

"Caramel colored with a thick lumpy tan head that lingers long. Aroma of caramel and pine, some floral notes. Flavor of caramel, nutty notes, some cinnamon, even bitterness offsetting the malt, notes of toffee, fruity esters, floral hops. Even mouthfeel. Good beer."

"I miss the Ninja Turtles... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear copper-garnet topped by over a finger of wan khaki foam. The nose comprises light cardboard, musty pine needle, stale orange peel, and a vague mixture of spices. The taste goes headlong for the orange the spices (which are still to blandly mixed together to pick apart), moves into wetter cardboard and stale biscuit, and finishes in an odd and off-putting bitterness that borders on mintiness. This is just plain bad, folks. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, I think they tried a little too hard with this spiced ale and ended up falling rather short of anything worth drinking. Pure dreck."
""
""
"It has all of the flavor of a good spicy beer, but it finishes a bit thin. That might not be a bad thing though as it's pretty drinkable. IMHO it deserves to be upwards of 80 points here. It's better than some higher rated beers I've tried. Enjoy!"

"D - Not great, the malt is dark but overly dry with a harshly toasty finish. Not much else going on."
"Extra dry throughout. a good Winter Warmer."
""
"Pours a four-finger khaki head that fades quickly leaving some lace. Crystal clear, deep amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Piney, citrusy nose and flavor is spicy citrus, dry light bitter finish. Unusual winter brew. $2.35 for a 12oz bottle from Bert's Better Beers Hooksett, NH"
"Overall I think I give up on Cisco Brewery so far the only beer that ""wow'd"" me was their Summer of Lager, so I will pick it up again in... summer. Gowd I can't wait for summer winter sucks!"
""

"Cola like in color. Spicy in taste especially in the aftertaste. It has a mild hoppy feel to it. The Head is nice and dark. An interesting characteristic is its gassiness which make it easy to fall into a fit of the hiccups. Light on the aroma. As winter beers go, this one has a lightness that make those not into syrupy winter winter beers appreciative. This is something we can enjoy when it gets cold."
"Overall: ""Gnar-Gnar Lumpkin"" sounds fun when you say it to your spouse aloud, but he sticks in your throat and nostrils like a liquid sasquatch; divulge the alcohol content, Cisco, and we may have reason to see past the muddle that is this beer's body and flavor...not sure ""cold, fresh, and wicked cool"" isn't longhand for Coors Heavy..."
"O: This is a winter warmer that is not too difficult to drink, possibly since it uses ginger in lieu of other stronger spices."
""
""
""
""
"O - This is good. I like the label art, too."
"Poured from a bottle into a glass, moderate amount of brownish white lacing. Very dark brown ale in color. Can barely see through the glass. Slight alcohol smell, keeping with winter warmer scene it has some spicy characters to it. Notes of dark fruit, maybe a little carmel too. Not too much body on this one, slightly watery dispite being 6% abv. Does not jump off your tounge and powering malty/spicy taste. Very dry. An average winter beer, below average for the price."
"Pours a copper tinted amber, full fluffy off-white head. Scent strong on seasonal spice, brown sugar and molasses and and tootsie-roll like chocolate, notes of mud and earth seem out of place - from the relatively lighter color, didn't expect this. Taste brings notes of scent, but somewhat all over the place and never really comes together. Medium bodied, lingering spice. Decent seasonal with lots of flavor, but needs more cohesion."
""

"Nice warmer, maybe a little too warm in the strength. It's identifiable for what it is, and decent."
""
""
"Pours a clear deep rich amber with a large blooming off white head atop.CHRISTmas spice in the nose along with a smattering of leafy hops,pretty light on both ends.flavors are pretty mild with some nutmeg and leafy hops,it's pretty dry but also lackluster.An average winter warmer,it looks pretty good and has a good mouthfeel but is pretty average in the other aspects."
"While the hops are muted in the aroma they burst upon the scene in the taste with a moderately bitter and dry finish to the sweetish start."
"Taste is astringent. Pine needles. Cough syrup. Metal. Raisins. Very malty with a harsh backbone. Biting. Close to undrinkable. The nice flavors are there but they all sit behind a harsh, alcoholic, biting and astringent front. Had to give away 4 of the 6 of this sixer. Hopefully somone else's palate will enjoy it. Mine definitely wanted none of this."
"D - A very good beer. A little expensive for what it is, but it's quite well-crafted. I could perhaps get this again if I found it for $9.99 or less (I'm pretty sure it was $10.99+, which is too much for a winter warmer)..."
""

"OVERALL: A solid, fresh tasting winter beer. Liked the hop flavors."
"Note, big differences in the rieviews for last years version (2011) and this years (2012)."
""
"The mix of spices and hops seems to give this beer a brassy taste and palate. The front to finish of the palate is astringent. There's some good caramel and bready malt flavors in this beer, but they get muddled by the spicey astringent flavors and palate."
""
""
"This is a reddish, frothy beer with a white head. The aroma is of herbal hops and some spice. Wood and pine-needles. Some earthy scents. The taste is a little astringent, not really sweet. Hops play a big part here....spice and grain. Grassy. The beer is medium in body, with a smoothness in the back of the tongue and a firm finish."
"Pours dark reddish brown, more opaque than not. 1/4 inch foam then fizzles and settles but leaving a patchy layer. Fruity nose. Cherries, plums raspberries. Rich malt open with a tert fruit taste. Hoppy/boozy is a little puckering in the mouthfeel. Almost a little wine in there."
"Pours a dark mahogany brown with a dense off-white head that settles to a solid cap. Very mild aromas of sweet caramel malt, some orange peel, and just a touch of Winter spices. Bland. Taste is similarly bland, honestly this has zero recognizable character. Just malt, maybe some hops, a bit of spice, and a touch of caramel. Yeah...super bland. Mouthfeel is smooth, a touch creamy, with a medium body and decent carbonation. Incredibly forgettable, not a good beer."
""

"O: I kind of enjoyed this one as it almost seemed like a hybrid of an ESB and a winter warmer, though it was not a super easy to drink beer and probably a beer that I would not have more than one of during a session - this would be best sipped after dinner by the fireplace as there is too much going on to pair well with foods in my opinion."
""
""
""
"Pours a nice reddish brown color with a good sized bubbly white head that slowly dissipates to a cap. Smells of mineral water, licorice, a bit of brown sugar and a hint of earth. The flavor is really quite bad. Caramel and brown sugar atop a heavy presence of anise or licorice with a metallic earthy almost sulfur flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet tart mouthfeel. I couldn't finish this one it's horrible."
"O: Not a terrible beer, but there are definitely better examples of Winter Warmers out there."
"Toasted grain and herbal, woody bitterness up front. Sweetish caramel malt and fruit fill in and take over the palate. Notes of gingerbread and molasses. Mulled wine spices, juniper, ginger, and cloves (?) around the edges. Herbal, woody bitterness shows up again in the finish. Medium body with a slightly syrupy feel. Not bad."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, vibrant, crystal clear, hazelnut brown coloring with a thin, sparse, filmy surface coating. Aromas of nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon on a subtle toffee backbone, with some warm cider hints at the end. Lighter on the nose than I was expecting. Flavors are rich and roasted initially, with a tangy toffee malt profile initially, followed by a solid dose of the previously mentioned spices, as well as some peppery hops profiles sprinkled throughout. The liberal spicing definitely provides the warmth in this winter warmer, but without overpowering the brew. Very solid backbone of malt richness to support everything going on on your palate. Tangy and spiced aftertaste that quickly washes away for a clean, slightly tangy finish that lingers longer than the bulk of the aftertaste itself. Smooth and round in mouth, but as it finishes you notice how crisp and clean the brew is. Solid, and at a lower ABV for a warmer, making this easy to quaff."
"Cheers!"
"I went with my usual aggro pour which resulted in two-plus fingers of dense tawny head with great retention. Color was a magnificent deep-copper with NE-quality clarity. I once had a girlfriend with natural hair color like that. Nose was spicy and I want to go with (at least) cinnamon and nutmeg. The former was easy to discern, but the latter because of a vanilla-like sweetness that was also present. More than that? Maybe. Probably. But those were the ones that I am willing to mention without being thought a pretentious fool. Mouthfeel was medium and the cinnamon was immediately discernible on the tonue along with something else, not nutmeg, but maybe allspice. Whatever it was, it was highly spiced. The finish, as a result, was bone-dry with the spices lingering well after my swallow. One or two at a sitting might be good, but I would not want a steady diet of this, even on the coldest and longest of winter nights."
""
"O/D-A Winter Warmer with some oomph behind it. I would probably not enjoy an entire six-pack, but a bottle would do just fine. The spices are set to a fairly high degree of intensity. Could stand to use some food around it."
"Poured a 1"" velvet beige head of medium lifespan. The body is dark burnt umber brown but held to the light it's a very deep amber. It smells of toasted malt and the spices actuall smell savory. Taste mirrors smell and the spices come out with warming ginger as well as piney hops. Fairly long finish. And yes, this beer truly is a warmer."

"Very good seasonal here. Probably because it doesn't go overboard on the spices."
""
""
"Overall fairly meh, spices come through a bit but not a lot which is nice if the astringent spicy earthy hops didn't take their place as front runner when not necessary. Nothing seems to blend well, and its like various components of different styles all smashed together and they hoped would get along, but instead the flavors clash."
""
"O: Not very tasty, goes down ok, slightly filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, this is definitely not a beer that I enjoyed very much."
"O-3.5"
""
"Thanks redliner8!!"
"Dry flavored with the malt tilting toward black patent (subtle burnt flavors). Relatively thin, but with a low carbonation. The finish is straight bitterness from high alpha hops. It's well-balanced but notable, long lasting as well. Little spice flavor."
"Looking at the previous reviews, I am a little surprised at the Pumple Drumkin analogy. Certainly they are close cousins but having had the PD at the brewery and this one in the bottle, I see a fair enough distinction and I like this one on its own merits as well as the PD. This bottle opens with a lively head, tan in color and a couple fingers thick. It holds pretty well and retreats to an impressive web of lacing. My nose picks up evergreen and allspice and subtle cinnamon and maybe a deeply buried chocolate kiss over oranges and mellow roasted coffee beans. Very pleasant and complex from my experience, perhaps a tad medicinal to some, but i really like this aroma. The flavor is more unified I think, a blend of toasted malts and subtle chocolate coffee grains over evergreen. I guess you might find all the same things that came out in the nose but it seems more subtle here and highly drinkable for a holiday/winter brew.This presents a reputable medium body but a bit more aqueous feel with gentle, tingly carbonation despite it's opening emergence. I think this is a neat seasonal brew that I'm glad I picked up. Another plus hit from the Nantucket crew! Nice."

"MF- Not too full bodied, but very creamy and the flavors seem to linger for quite a while."

"A touch over-bitter, but still works. I love the fact this isn't over-spiced. Solid brew. Could use a bit of sweetness or breadiness up front to help balance it. Long bitterness without any hop character make this one hard to session. Well made, no joke when it comes to asserting its strengths."
"Overall I really enjoy this beer. It's mildly spiced, flavorful and balanced. Definitely a nice winter beer to sip after a long day of shredding powder on the mountain. I'll certainly buy another 6 as the weather gets colder."

"This could very well be the East Coast's answer to Anchor's Christmas Ale."
