"I am drinking this the same month as its best by date. It has an earthy spicy hop nose, and some cardamom to cola. It pours brilliant burn amber to garnet under an off-white foam cap. The palate starts creamy and malty and then there a little tanginess arises followed by some smooth malt flavors that fade as it dries out in the finish and lingers with a mingling of malty and bitter after tastes with just a touch of pepper. A hint of heat, very faint roast, medium body and medium to a shade less on the carbonation."
"O - This was a pretty simple non-complex beer with subtle aromas and non-dominant flavors; it really didn't seem the winter warmer, but more of a weak AIPA; easy drinkong"

"The sentiment sucks - Never summer. It's how it feels, even as we get our first thaw in two months. Lake Erie is an ice block and I am not going to the Caribbean again until next month. At least we have great beers like this to keep us warm."
""
"A decent winter warmer.. Not sure I've had much from this brewery, but this isn't that bad for a first impression"
""
"Having it for dessert. What I want to say about this beer is that it's very much like jubelale by Deschutes. If you like that beer you'll like this one."

"Overall – An alight brew overall, but nothing super exceptional and one I think would actually have been better on traditional tap, not nitro."

"Good beer, appropriate to the style. Malt is sticky and complex the touches of alcohol in a sessionable ale really make this feel true to the season. I want another and then curl up on the couch in front of a fireplace."

""
"A very pleasant surprise!"
""
""
"Overall: very drinkable with strong and complex flavors. It is 15 degrees in NJ today, and this beer is hitting the spot at lunchtime!"
""
"The beer pours a clear, ruby-red color, and a thin off-white head sits atop the brew but dissipates rather quickly. Bready and caramel malt aromas start things off before moving to a pleasant citrus hop-kick. Caramel malt and spice begin to warm the palate before a biting hop-twang balances everything out. The spices throughout the tasting really add an intriguing dimension to this medium-bodied, moderately carbonated brew."
""
""
"Never Summer isn’t the type of beer I expected it to be, but it is still a good brew overall. I was looking for a maltier, spicier taste, but this beer is still good in its own way. It cannot substitute for the more traditional winter ales in taste, but it is actually a good tasty beer in its own way. It could be consumed during any season"

"I would recommend it if you are looking for a change of pace or a good winter beer. Not available to me locally on the East Coast like most Colorado beers but I enjoyed it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty good brew. Good malts and spices."
""
""
""
"Not enough alcohol to characterize a warmer, might be best shelved among English Milds. Very similar to Mild Winter by Goose Island, although not as good. Still a worthy order on-draft or as a single purchased among a mix-six (or, in my situation, as part of a mixed Xmas case). Cheers!"

"Nice winter seasonal. Shared a pint with a friend at Gainesville House of Beer. This one pours reddish brown with very little head. Aroma is pine hops that are mostly subdued by heavy mlats Lots of hop flavor without bitterness, aggressive biscuit and toffee malts take this over a good bit. Warming with a clean finish. Won't seek it out but nice to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent Winter Warmer, but not one I'd return to."
"O: This is a nice beer to sip on a chilly night. It doesn't really provide any heat from the alcohol but the malty nature of this beer helps to warm you up from the inside."
"Overall this is an average winter warmer at best. Something just doesn't gel here with the darker malts and earthy, rustic, almost herbaceous hops. One and done for me here. I like my winter warmers much more balanced and less ""Americanized"" if you catch my drift."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out a nice ruby color but there is almost no head to speak of on this beer. I can smell the caramel malts immediately and get hints of the hop aroma. It has a nice warm character to it which i like. It is balanced well with the hops and i detect a little bit of nutmeg. It really brings me back to winter months but unfortunately it just tastes kinda average. I'm not sure if i'll be buying this one again but if you like winter warmers it is worth a shot."
""
""
""
""
"Very unique, the cardamom is a love-it-or-hate-it affair, but I'm digging it. I don't normally like winter warmers but I could get into this brew."
""
""
""
""
"This is a good beer, but rather run of the mill for a winter warmer. It's your typical over spiced ale, but rather a more simple, malty ale that in some respects resembles an amber ale. I wouldn't turn this down, but I wouldn't seek this out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: not a bad beer, but not the best representative for the style. Not quite the warming, spicy, malt bomb I was looking for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If this was the only winter warmer available to me I certainly would drink it but with other options out there I think I may reach for another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is the best beer I received in the first month of the ""amazing Beer Club"" collection. I love it and wish I could get my hands on a sixer. This is a nice winter warmer that reminds me of my favorite winter warmer (Old Fezziweg)."
""
"O: Solid and interesting beer. A good balance of malt, hop and spice perfect for the cold weather. I could drink a couple. Worth a try."
""
"O: unfortunately not even close to what i expect or look for in this style, just doesn't have the depth or interesting notes i have found in anchor, harpoon, or Samuel smiths, just missed on this one, its too bad too because i do enjoy boulder beers"
""
""
""
"O: Nice beer, but not really what I think of with a warmer with the hop forward profile."
""
""
""
"O-this drank more like a red ale than a winter warmer to me. it was more malty and flavorful, and it just wasn't well balanced. it was still a decent an easy to drink beer, but its not something i'll be ordering again!"
""
""
""
"Overall, id buy again, but there are usually better options."
""
""
""
"Overall, I have had plenty winter warmers that I would rate higher than this. However, it is an easy drinking beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Move of an amber ale than a winter warmer. Not a bad drinker but a weak abv winter seasonal without anything that can warm me up from the cold besides a very subtle spice character and roast finish? eh"
""
"Overall, it looks and smells great, but that only sets up for a huge letdown in the taste and mouthfeel."
"Dr: A mundane beer that never tries to surpass its own self-acknowledged mediocrity. Drinkable but undesirable."
"O: Like others have said, I wouldn't exactly call it a winter warmer. Seems to me its more of an amber ale by taste. Not my favorite, but it's pretty good stuff. I'd recommend a half-pint for sure."
""
"o- definetly a very tame winter warmer but it is still quite sessionable and overall really nice."
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Decent if a bit forgettable malty offering. Worth the repeat if there were not may more options around."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very comparable to the Winterhook. The appearance of this ale gave it a slight edge, but I feel like it's a tie."
""
"Not bad stuff, something I can't put my finger on, but a unique enough brew, and as far as mystery beers go in a variety 12 pack, this one is legit."
""
""
""
"Overall: I am somewhat surprised. Winter warmers are not always my favorite beers, but this brew has found a niche within my palate. I'd definitely quaff this again."
"Clear redish brown, but deep color. Minimal lace and head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There's no doubt this is a good beer, but it really could have been on another level with a bit of a tweak."
"Great alternative to spiced winter ales for those who like hops. Dark amber red color with short lived head. Hop presence isn't overpowering. A tasty beer but nothing really stands out as great. I will be drinking more of these this winter."
"pours a radiant glowing redish with an average off-white head. looks fantastic! nose is candied sugars and perhaps a slight spice infusion, backed up by what is sure to be a sturdy malt body. yup, there it is, not as sweet as the nose might indicate, balanced nicely for the heavier mouthfeel. modest carbonation lets this one gently prickle the palate a bit as it goes down. overall a pretty good start to the winter warmer season here, but with an abv under 6%, i am going to be searching for something ""warmer"" come the snows."
"Deep reddish orange in color with an off-white head. It's a gorgeous color. It's clear and the bubbles of effervescence sparkle as they float to the top. Aroma of sweet toasted malts, and hops (though not overpowering). I didn't smell or taste the ""secret"" spices. Flavor of rich caramel malt is front and center. Hop flavor is not strong. Medium bodied, with a smooth mouth feel, with a bit of sweetness in the finish."
"Overall- I'm a big fan. This is a delicious brew that has a very high drinkability. I would definitely get more of this."
"One of my favorite brew fresh... But, in all fairness this brew is 9 months old (past it's prime), so it's hard to judge. I wanted to share with other what an aged one is like!"
"Overall - I was very happy with the depth of flavor and body this beer had and it's definitely a beer that I hope to have on hand on a more consistent basis!"
"Overall: Overall the beer was pretty good. The beer definitely features hops but blends it well with its sweeter notes. I'd recommend trying this beer, and any hop heads out there will definitely appreciate this one."
"although i was very dissapointed with the overall characteristics of this beer i found it to be quite drinkable and the first sessional winter warmer i have encountered"
"I like this Winter Warmer, not spiced per se but with a touch of sweetness and very good balance."
"Well it is still is winter, even though it was 84 degrees today. This is courtesy of BOTMC, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a smell of cocoa and cinnamon almost cappuccino like. Pours to a light root beer colour with a medium size bubble head that stands up. Initial taste is very evidently cocoa with some flatly bitter earthy hops. Taste then transitions to a sweeter malty and heath bar like middle while still maintaining a degree of bitterness the finishes with a flat bitterness that has sweetness around the edges and as such fades into the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit to sparkly but, overall, very tasty brew. Would be great as a dessert beer and next to the fireplace it would be quite at home."
"O: Picked this up on a whim because I've had some of their beers that I liked before. Thought this was good, but I don't see myself getting this again. Easy to drink, just nothing amazing."
"D Pour me another as the bottle states ""Makes even the coldest Colorado peaks seem warm"" Bring on the snow bunnies!!"
"D - a little too light and sweet to command respect -- more like hanging out with a friend than an authority figure -- you can have a good time with this, but it won't make you change how you see the world"
"Very drinkable - great session beer and definitely worth buying again and again."
"DB- A bit better from what I was expecting, a winter warmer with a nice array of balanced flavors."
"The mouth is slightly thickish with low carbonation. I think this is a pretty easy beer to session. It has some interesting facets but is not overpowering in any of its taste elements."
"Drinkability: Pretty good English Strong Ale that could use a titch more body, as well as a little more hops to balance the sweetness. Still, quite enjoyable."
"D: one of the best winter warmers I've had, and would definitely consider getting again. Also I like the low abv for the style. I could have more than one of these."
"(d) Other winter warmers, 2-3 max. I feel like I could stand on the porch Christmas Eve with friends and polish off 6 of em before the cigar runs out. Great drinkability. (4.5/5)"
"O: A very good brew, but doesn't quite hit the mark as a true WW in my opinion. I think the assertive hop bitterness may have masked a lot of other flavors that were probably in there."
"A different take on the style for sure. Low on the spice level. Nice malt and nice hops. It actually makes me think of summer rather than winter. A great beer on any occasion."
"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a dimpled mug. A sleeper of the winter/christmas beer bunch I evaluated. Pours a deep orange-red with a frothy, beige head that leaves behind creamy lace. Dark caramel malt, light nuttiness and piny/earthy hops all merge to create a pleasant aroma. Light to medium-bodied and creamy with a slightly dry and moderately bitter finish. The flavor is a solid, dark caramel front with notes of spicy, earthy hops and light nuts."
"Low carbonation, a balanced palette and a lower than expected ABV make this a drinkable brew, especially for the Winter Warmer style. Not sure if I'd get this anytime other than ""snowed-in"" periods of a Northeast Winter, but it seems that the brewmasters at Boulder Beer Club thought the same thing when naming this one."
"D-Very easy drinking and balanced beer. One of the more user friendly winter warmers/spiced beer out there."
"Drinkability depends on one's tolerance for a dry, spicy beer. For me, it was the right flavor combination and would be a good choice after a day on the slopes."
"with a name like summer ale, this beer should be a lot lighter. Not a summer session beer, not even any type of sessional beer! Very sharp after taste. Harsh, metallic and does not go down smoothly! Don't even waste your time ordering this beer. You'd waste your money and time! I'd only drink this beer if it was free."
"Smooth and medium textured, the carbonation is low, and the feel is enjoyable. The palate is solid, and as a result, the beer lends itself perfectly to drinking. While not my favorite winter warmer, I am excited to drink the next 2 bottles."
"Overall: One of my favorite winter beers. It's well balanced and possibly a little heavy handed on the hops for the style, but I love me some hoppy goodness."
"""bold new look at winter beers"". Well....I like my Winter Brew the way it was. This was a good tasting Ale, But I like more Body and Flavor."
"O: It's pretty drinkable, but overall not all that impressive. Not saying that it's bad, it just doesn't stand out. As a winter warmer, it doesn't hit its mark."
"Rockies Brewing Company--Boulder Beer Company never summer ale--Looking Glass Series--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 6.50% ABV. 40 IBU's. (4.25 / 5.) Orange-tan lasting dense lacy head. Thick pour. Clear bright rich amber color. Floral malt hop mild toasted fruit biscuit front. Creamy cloying mellow sweet light toasted caramel cocoa hint doughy body. Mellow hop spice satisfying smooth malty end. Tasty! Sampled 12/23/2010. Malt of the Earth Beer of the Month Club Selection December 2010."
"Mouthfeel is lighter than expected but has clean and crisp feel. Overall, an enjoyable winter beer but nothing spectacular going on here."
"D - Well I really don't love it in a sense that its an in your face spice fest like I love in warmers but after it warms a bit the bitterness of the hops (English?) makes itself know and it gives it a bitter and unforgiving tone to the beer. I like it but would not love it to try again."
"D: I like this beer, however, I couldn't have more than one or two. Similar to many ""winter"" beers, the spice is good but I can't have to many. Unlike other winter warmers, this beer falls a little short in terms of having a defining quality or standing out in a major way."
"Never Summer is balanced, attenuated a bit too much, and over-spiced. With that out of the way, I enjoyed it. Good flavor, with some woody hops, brown sugar, and a nice stickiness. Medium body, finishes pretty thin but alright. Nothing new under this sun, but a decent drinking brew."
"Easily quaffable and something I have every year, but not in big numbers."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Body is a bit thin for a winter warmer, but is overall easy to drink and a beer I'd probably have again."
"Pours a clean orange-ish to amber color with an off white head. In the aroma, dark fruits and dry malts. In the taste, roasty malt with dry dark fruit and alcohol. A small bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry small dark fruit in the aftertaste. A nice winter warmer, easy to drink, just above average."
"Drinkability -- Well, it's easy enough to drink. Wouldn't be hard to drop back a few pints, but I wouldn't be excited or all that interested in doing so. Not a beer I'll be seeking out."
"D: Smooth, and easily drinkable, but disappointing if you were expecting flavor and/or spiciness of a winter warmer."
"Another great selection from a brewery that never ceases to produce quality brews that are both unique and balanced."
"This beer pours a deep amber color, with a slightly off white head. The aroma smells of roasted and caramel malts. The taste is very sweet, and balanced to the point where you almost cant taste the hops. There is a spice flavor there that I cant seem to find a description for. The mouthfeel is medium to almost a medium heavy feel. Low carbonation as well. Overall I think this is very drinkable."
"D: Flavorful and fairly smooth. Easy to drink without wearing down."
"Overall, tasty, not too sweet like some winter warmers."
"Morey's Bottom Line: Although I liked this beer, I was expecting a bit more for some reason. Reminds me a bit of Stoudts Winter Ale (2009-2011), but not quite as good."
"This one pours a deep chestnut brown with a hint of red. Fruity esters and dark caramel dominate the smell. Hops are evident only as a counterbalancing bitterness but they never overwhelm the dark caramel and dried fruit flavors coming from the malt and yeast esters (Special B or something close to it shines through, I think). Mouthfeel is slightly thick but this one is a bit of a lightweight in the winter warmer realm, though still a tasty one."
"I've had this on tap several times in previous years and it was pretty similar to Isolation (from Odell). These bottles have had borderline IPA-level hop bitterness."
"Drinkability - although not terribly complex, it does have an intriguing taste, but possibly a little too bitter for me to endure for any extended period of time."
"This has always been one of my favorite winter seasonals. Nicely hopped but with some sweat malts that really balance out the flavor. Pours a red copper color with abut 1/4 inch head with goos lacing. On the nose you immediatly notice the hops with a pine, citrus note but also you can pick up on sweat maltyspice. The palate is very well balanced between the hops and malts."
"D - I don't know if the firkin of this was bad or what...but this beer was below average...I like the complexity of winter warmers but this one tasted sour and nothing like the style"
"Pours a moderately dark brown color with a bit of red in there. Nose brings forward some caramel malt and a little bit of apple as well as some light hops. Taste is pretty malty without much spice, as would be expected. Caramel and some brown sugar with a bit of apple and lighter fruits. Medium, creamy body with good carbonation. A good beer, and a nice alternative to many of the overspiced editions that find their way around during the winter."
"Red-brown and crystal clear. Fair head retention, quick dissipation. No signs of carbonation. Malt predominates the aroma. Some carbonation bite up front. Caramel middle, not too sweet. Faint bitterness on back end. Medium to medium heavy mouthfeel. Could use more alcohol."
"Good taste, drinkable up front, fades as the beer warms. Keep cold."
"Into a pint glass, poured a dark yet transparent copper-red, with a very thin white head, and poor retention. Smelled of toffee, caramel, apple, and subtle grassy/herbal hops. The taste confirmed a big sweet/malty/caramel dominance, with a bitter hop bite on the finish and a lingering dryness afterwards. Thick and creamy, with little carbonation. I guess it stands to reason that someone from Colorado would make a good winter ale."
"D - Dangerously drinkable. Thick, but light at the same time. I'd even call it a lager if I didn't know better."
"Poured into a standard pint glass, with a nice ruby/brown color and a light tan head of about one finger that dissipated quickly and laced minimally. Aroma was of an earthy nature with roasted malts. Taste is malty with again an earthy flavor. Feel is smooth, with light carbonation and a medium feel. Good winter beverage that reminds me some of a scotch ale."
"Coppery red with a thick tan head of foam that leaves scraps of lace on the glass. Caramel malt and faint holiday spice in the nose. Sweet caramel maltiness balanced with plenty of cascade hop flavors. Brown sugar and candied grapefruit with a touch of cinnamon and clove. Medium light bodied for the style. Not the biggest Winter warmer in the world but a darn tasty and well hopped lightweight."
"This beer pours a reddish amber with a thick tan head that leaves behind thick lacing. It smells strongly of hops and faintly of citrus. This is a moderately hoppy beer for the style, but it's well balanced with some caramel malts. This is a pretty tasty beer, but I don't know that I could do a session of it unless it was in the middle of winter."
"pours a pretty, dark ruby with a one finger khaki head. smells of fresh grapefruit hops with hints of caramel malt. the taste is a bit watery. toasted biscuit tones with a caramel and nutty flavor. sweet piney hops and a bitter finish. all in all, a good winter warmer with familiar flavors, just not bold enough for me."
"Picked this brew up since most of the offerings from Boulder I have had in the past where pretty good. This brew poured to a clear vibrant amber color with a thick off white to tan head that had great retention and left lots of lacing throughout. Caramel and a slight biscuit aroma come to mind from the malt. Nice amount of hop aroma comes through the nose from this one, seems to me that the Willamette and Cascade hops really show up and mix together quite well. The flavor is a very good mix of malt flavors, which really create the backbone as the flavors are always there - caramel and toasted flavors come to mind. Hops give a real nice flavor profile here, while not in your face they are on the dominant side. For me the spices do not really come out at all but maybe I am just missing them. Overall this is a very nice brew, easy drinking - not really sure why this is considered just a winter warmer, it is an overall good brew."
"Pours a one finger head, and a dark amber in color. The smell is actually hinting at chocolate aromas. The taste is ok, kind of a nutty, chocolate malt flavor. Not as chocolate as a chocolate stout or such, but more a subtle nut brown taste. An ok mouthfeel, nothing spectacular, but drinkable nonetheless and certainly nothing offensive."
"D: High, can definitely drink this throughout the winter months and then some."
"Mouthfeel is medium. Drinkability is good, low ABV, tastes fine, etc. Its a good beer, but not extraordinary. Recommended"
"D- A fairly bland beer but what is there is enjoyable."
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is a bit high. Drinkability is fine. A solid beer."
"Grabbed this one cause I've had solid beers from Boulder in the past. Amber color with a small off white head that dissolves fast and leaves a touch of lacing. Quiet toffee malt nose. Very mild - not much going on. Taste is similar, mostly a grainy toffee malt taste. Some light dried fruit. A little citrus maybe. Fine body, good carbonation. Good beer, kind of a standard malty winter brew. Probably would go with Anchor or a couple others over this, just for something with a little going on."
"pours a really nice looking deep amber color with a tiny head, it looks really good. smell is not very potent, some caramel aromas are the most prevalent but nothing else is really overpowering. taste i pretty good, has a nice malt body to it that gives it most of its taste, but there is still a nice hop flavor to it. mouthfeel is nice and somewhat thick, drinkabily is pretty good, its a tasty beer and good on a cold night like tonight"
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a crisp dark orange with a decent off-white diminishing head that leaves just a slight bit of lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight caramel malt and just a hint of spice. The taste is a decent balance of burnt caramel and pine hops with just enough spices such as cinnamon and brown sugar to make this a respectable Winter warmer. The beer is fairly light bodied with decent carbonation. This is a very respectable Winter warmer, one I likely would have again."
"This poured a pretty deep amber color that produced a one finger off white head that faded to a nice foamy ring. The pour immediately relased a hoppy sweet aroma. After the initial aroma, I thought it would be quite hoppy, it isn't. It is pretty smooth and well balanced. Has a little piney flavor with an alcohol after taste. A pretty drinkable beer."
"Wife picked this up for me at CBE. I read the label and saw that it was assertively hopped and malted, so I was thinking it was going to be a bit hoppier. To me though, it was well balanced between the two. The hops are up front, but then fade out to the malts and spices. Not one of the best WWs I've had, but still pretty decent."
"D: Could definitely polish off a few of these, its a beer that grows on you"
"This is an excellent winter season session worthy brew. I could easily drink this for awhile without getting sick of it."
"D - i like that its not overpowering on the spices like most within the style, with a nice subtle hop presence."
"drinkability is ok - decent pale ale - but wheres the winter warmer? spice?"
"D - a bit too much residual sweetness to crave this beer, but this is well crafted and I'll enjoy sipping on one or two on a cool evening."
"Overall: A fine winter beer, a little strong/hoppy for my tastes, but that is a personal opinion and doesn't reflect in my ratings. This is a decent beer, and one that I would recommend."
"overall this is an awesome beer for cold nights, wont need more than 2/3 in a sitting to warm you up and keep your tastes pleased... this is def going on my list for the season!"
"D: Overall, this is another nice beer from Boulder. It actually drank stronger for me than it really is, which was an interesting change of pace. I'm glad I picked it up."
"D - Drinkable, though it is a bit too heavy for a session beer. The hop character is ok, but kind of generic. The malt character is very nice and really makes the beer."
"Conclusion: I've kind of split on my opinions of Boulder's beers...this one however is quite tasty and one I'll probably check out next winter as a more affordable alternative to some of my favorite examples from across the pond."
"Drinkability: This is a nice well made beer and I'll keep and eye open for it in the future. If given a choice I'm not sure I'd pick it over some of the other winter warmers to be found during the cold weather, but it is certainly worth a return visit."
"This one pours fairly clear dark red with an off-white head and a bit of haze. The aroma is moderate-high caramel with moderate floral hop. The flavor is high sweet caramel that is quickly replaced by moderate citrus hop flavor and drying hop bitterness, which lingers in the mouth. The body is medium-full, rather smooth with moderate carbonation. Overall a tasty winter brew worth a shot, although unlikely to drink a lot in one sitting."
"The taste won't disappoint. It is a sweet, slightly cloying beer, but the slight molasses flavor, slight brown sugar, definite roasted caramel malts are very nice. There is a nice bready, sweet, caramelized malty base underneath that is very enticing. The hop is present just enough to insinuate itself. The hop is a bit dry, a bit leafy. There is an ever so slight sweet nutty flavor to the beer. The mouthfeel is quite sticky sweet and the aftertaste is very mild. This is a lighter bodied winter warmer, with a fairly modest ABV. There is not a lot to be disappointed with in this beer. Worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"OK beer, not bad, but would not tap again"
"D - rather easy to drink, pretty consistent with most winter warmers, however ""i've had better"""
"T & M: Flavor is mildly sweet. Mostly malt but a slight hop bitterness. Medium bodied and a decent winter ale. (I definitely can't complain for the price)"
"D: Drinkable and pleasant but that's about as strong a recommendation as I can give. Either more sweetness or more hops would help out this brew -- it doesn't know which way to go so it doesn't get very far."
"Medium bodied with a bit of chewiness. A good beer overall. Perhaps a little fresher, this might be a real treat. Seemed slightly cardboardy and oxidized but even with that, this was a nice beer."
"D: Okay and not great. I was not a winter beer fan before this one and remain unconverted."
"Don't drink and review."
"Drinkability: Pretty good. Probably one of the better winter beers that I've had this year. Not too malty with some ample hops. Well rounded with good fruitiness. Will revisit and recommend."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, decent representation of style, there are definitely several beers within the style that I would choose over this one."
"Overall, I think this one is pretty good. It doesn't really follow the other winter warmers I've had stylistically, but I think it tastes pretty damn good."
"D - An enjoyable brew whose hops are a pleasant surprise on the Winter Warmer scene... A little more in the Scent and Mouthfeel departments would go a long way to making this a much better beer... I would drink again in the future, but not seek our or recommended..."
"M/D - very smooth and earthy brew, a very nice balance of malt and hops make this one a definite must try"
"Overall, not the best winter warmer, but not the worst. I could see myself having another quite easily, as it is very easy to drink."
"This beer pours an auburnish/copper with a thin beige skim of a head. Slight head retention, not much lacing to speak of. Nose is of caramel malt and light piney-floral hops. Taste is very, very piney. Begins with extreme piney flavoring and floral hops - a spice that I can't quite put my finger on....then moves to a bit of caramelized flavoring. There is graininess in the mouthfeel and has a big salty, astringent blast. The astringency lingers through the remainder, not hidden in the least by the floral hops. This beer may appeal to some, but was not for me."
"I picked up subtle flavors in the aftertaste capped off by a slight bitter finish. This is a highly drinkable winter ale."
"Drinkability? Very good. No probs with the lightish alcohol content and it is tasty enough. A nice Winter Warmer if you're not into spices, higher alcohol, and overly hopped brews. I like , and head retention and lacing are above average."
"d: you could have a few of these in one night. I will be drinking this again during the colder months for sure"
"Drinkability: Quite high, overall seems almost more like an IPA rather than a Winter Warmer...good beer no the less."
"D: At 5.94% a very drinkable Winter Warmer?ESB....nice"
"Excellent."
"Brght rusty amber/tobacco hed ber. Good two finger head that recedes to a thick film with heady stickage and lacing. Good bubbling too. Great toasted cracker biscuit aroma with just some faint spice notes. Plus a little citrus from the hops to boot. Good bubbling too. A little ginger and nutmeg blend with some spiced orange peel tea. Plus the dry toasted malt make his one of the best balanced winter warmers I've ever had. Great palate and great sessionability. Highly recommended!!!"
"D-Quite drinkable. Though not as warming a winter warmer as some versions out there, the hoppiness in this brew is refreshing in a sea of malt-driven WW's. I'm all for this one."
"Drinkablility- Ive been able to drink a fair amount of this without getting tired of it. Thumbs up here!"
"As such this beer had the rich amber color I've come to expect from winter ales. The distinct taste of the hops was pleasantly apparent, but not over powering. I thought this was very similar to the Spanish Peaks ""Winter Cheer""."
"D - Fairly drinkable if it's up your alley."
"D: This is just a terribly average beer without much character or taste."
"Poured out of 12 oz bottle into tulip glass. Pours a deep red with a half finger of light tan head. Minimal lacing on glass. Smells sweet with hints of caramel malt and light hop smell. Taste is very good, better than I expected honestly. Biscuit-like hops and smooth malt flavor lead to a clean finish. Perfect combination of hops and malts. Light mouthfeel and not as dry as most hoppy ales. Very drinkable. Probably my favorite beer yet from boulder beer co. Not my first choice given choices but will definetly drink again."
"Drink -- Beer becomes more 'forward' as I drank. WIth more distinct vanilla and spices with clear malt coming through"
"Easy enough to drink but it's so mild that it's hardly worth it. It's OK but nothing outstanding."
"Yeah I agree with the other reviewers in that this beer is average. The taste is smooth with a bitter hop finish with not much else really exposing itself. I really didn't pick up much from this beer to suggest that it is a ""Winter Warmer"". If handed this with no label I might assume it is just a hopped amber of no particular origin."
"Poured a solid amber with a light brown head that disappeared quickly. Seems pretty clear with low carbonation. Smells of an above-average perhaps spicy maltiness. It's a good medium body in the mouth, and tastes like a decent holiday spiciness with a good malt flavor as well. Overall pretty drinkable. Nothing spectacular, but overall a solid brew."
"Overall, a decent beer, but there are many better for the style."
"Notes from 2/16/07"
"Tasty, satisfying little brew we got here. Very malty and filling with a good dash of flavorful hops and some ever so subtle spiciness. Aroma is balanced and pleasant. Nice chestnut pour thick off white head and lots of lacing covering the glass. Very creamy and satisfying. Thick malts, slightly sweet with a great hop taste. A pinch of grapefruit and citrus with a dash of pine and a touch of mixed spices. This is a clever ale, nicely crafted."
"Poured this deep red slight copper beer into a beer mug. Its flavorful aroma of cloves, caramel, malts that are sweet to the nose. Its taste follows suit in the sweetness and it also haves a great earth tones taste. Overall a great beer to enjoy when it is cold out."
"I had this on tap at High Street Grill. The beer was a dark red with a solid head. I thought the hops were prevalent on the nose, at first. But as the beer warmed it did smell sweeter. The first sip had a profound hoppy profile, that melllowed into a more malty brew. I really did not notice any spices that were added. This beer has medium body with moderate carbonation. Never Summer is very easily drinkable. I enjoyed this beer, but IMO it tasted more like a red ale."
"A winter warmer on the lighter side. Very sessionable."
"Pours a hazy orange amber color with thin white head. Aroma of bourbon and light fruit. Pretty smooth with a lot of apple and bourbon flavor. Tasted kind of like a mix of whiskey and apple cider but in a good way."
"Nice to see a winter without the cinnamon and pine and all the other spice that I am just not a fan of. Lucky to get this on tap, the bartender at Smith's told me there were only 4 kegs in mass."
"Pours a crystal clear amber color with a small tan head that receded quickly leaving light lacing. Sweet aroma of caramel malts, slightly spicy and light hopping. Taste was fairly similar. Toasty malts, sweet, brown sugar and molasses, a peppery spiciness, piney hops, and some light citrus. Creamy on the tongue, light carbonation. An ok WW, but have had several other that were much more pleasing over the past few days."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. It poured a med cloudy brown with a thin light tan head that quickly disappeared. As another reviewer stated it looked like old cloudy iced tea. It had no aroma. I was expecting a more malty spicey beer but this was much hoppier than I expected. Some hint of malts but the beer was overall a bitter brew. Felt ok in the mouth with very little fizz. I had bought a 6-pack to take to a party, took 4 home, had to switch to the house beer. Overall just a very average beer, couldn't drink more that 1 or 2 at a time, have a feeling these are going to linger in my beer fridge for awhile. Disappointed"
"This poured a dark, clear auburn with tan head. It smelled like grapefruit and orange hops, with honey malt and a bit of vanilla. It tasted like creamy orange hops with honey malt and a bit of vanilla. It was fairly thick with no carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was more hoppy than expected, but it was very tasty. It was clean and had great body, and was super easy to drink. There's not much to complain about here, despite a lack of originality."
"To me the Winter Warmer genre is one that can either be very good, or mediocre. It's a difficult one to pull off, and unfortunately this one falls in the mediocre category. The spices weren't backed up by a roasty, full, malty backbone, and that's what I look for."
"Pours reddish orange heading toward brown with an okay head that settles to a thin swirl. Smells quite malty with a touch of spice, sweet, and maybe some figs in there. Slightly sweet and malty, a bit thin with some wax and some spice and some breadiness. Pretty pleasant. A bit thin and waxy in the mouth with a hint of spicy/grainy sourness at the end. Not bad, and actually probably better as a fall beverage. I think it lacks the body and oomph for the winter."
"I drank this on a warm day. Haha, yeah, it says NEVER Summer on the label but whatever. Deep amber colored with a small head. Aroma is malts, caramel with some honey and a little hops in the background. It's actually a nice aroma. This beer is rich with a pretty full mouthfeel and quite warming. A very nice malt, bitter hop bite balance to the flavor with some caramel and spices mixed in. The beer is quite good and next time I will have it on a cool day and I'm sure it will be just that much better."
"Pours a glowing red amber body in a tumbler with a short off-white head that settles quickly--almost the appearance of iced tea...nice barley and malt aroma straight away with the slight spruce and hops moving in late--with some spices too--nice balance! Smooth, mildly effervescent body that warms with each sip... somewhat fizzy... quite a malty ale with minimal hop balance belying its nose... quite an American approximation of the ESB? Brother Jer decided to select this as our ""light"" beer to the Yanks/O's tailgate--whoops... that ""never"" implies a year-round treat..as such, not bad, borderlining as complex, but still holds to its basic caramel malts--the spices are too ""secret"" to move the beer into that winter beer genre..."
"taste is of caramel, spice, roasted nuts, malt, very christmasy, weak on the palate, with some pine."
"This beer is quite easy on the eyes, but loses points at every step after that. It is sweet but thin, with some unwelcome oxidized and vegetal flavors. Bitterness/hop flavor is strictly average. It is by no means a bad beer, but I would not make much of an effort to seek out this beer again."
"A good winter warmer. A deep maroon brown color with a tan head. The nose has some nice malts and well balanced hops. The taste also has a good malt structure. Not as spicy as I like to see in this style. Needs to be kicked up another notch. Medium to full body. Fairly smooth. A very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: It's okay! Relatively mild in terms of flavor and spice character when compared to it's winter warmer brethren. Which is fine, as some of the ones on the far end can, frankly, be rather gross."
"Pours a very nice deep orange reddish color with a small thin head, almost no lacing. Below average carbonation with a fairly strong smell of bittersweet hops. Tastes weak with a very light body. Tad f hop bitterness followed b some sweetness. Not enough flavor to be had again."
"overall drinkablity is good, you could easily session"
"D: Easy to drink beer, a little out of season, but this would be a great beer to drink on a cold night, or after skiing all day. Pretty tasty."
"Well, being this winter warmer does not have any hint of the sickening spices characteristic of the style, that is a big win. Nice, deep, malty presence makes for a great crossover from Porters/Stouts to Spring Ales."
"This beer pours a clear dark amber color. The head is two inches in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of citrusy hops, dark fruit, and caramel. The aroma leans a lot more towards the hops. The taste is more balanced than the aroma. The malty caramel backbone gets the hops from overpowering everything. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a little too much carbonation. Overall, this is a nice winter beer. I could drink it again."
"Clear bronzy-auburn hue, the slightly off-white head reached a very modest half-finger in height before fading to a scummy, soapy collar rather quickly. Spotty lace. Looks decent enough. Good aromas, hoppy with pine and citrus influences, malty goodness too, a kiss of fruit. Fair potency, a little more authority would be welcomed; it is inviting. The palate is pleasantly hoppy, very unexpected actually. The outright bitterness is solid but the hops add flavorful depth (largely piney... a hint of citrus) that can be found squarely on top of the sweet, slightly toffee-like malts. The spiciness is mild, hot candy-like. This is a mighty tasty beverage and yet another reason to take note of the Looking Glass Series. Medium-full body, modest and appropriate carbonation that produces a pleasant, effortless, mouthfeel. This is a beer I am impressed with and something I need to quaff again"
"D: Decent beer... the beer could use a pinch more malt in each bottle..."
"Poured the color of a penny. Small head and left me with minimal lacing. Smelled of caramel, slight hops and somer berry or fruit. taste was a little spicey, caramel and slightly hoppy with some good malts with that intriguing berry taste. It seems a little thin for a warmer. Expected it to be more robust."
"This winter brew is very nice. Pours a nice rich amber color. An nice easy drinking brew. It has a pleasent floral aroma, but over the top some like Hopped up brews. Interesting the taste is not what expected... in a very good way. ""Winter Warmer"" always makes me nervous (some are too spicy and lose their identity). This one is very good and easy to drink. It's hints of malts, but it has a nice noticeable hoppiness. Worth the trip!"
"It poured a dark ruby red in color with a tan head. The smell was okay. I caught caramel and hoppy notes in there. The taste was good. I could really taste the caramel, hops, and malt flavor. The balance wasn't the best and I feel that it made for a tough drink. If it were a little better I may have enjoyed it more, but it was okay. I don't know if I would go for this one again."
"D - A above average brown ale, but a just barely above average Winter Warmer. I like my winter warmers with just a little more alcohol and more spice."
"Half is carmel and X thickness on the tongue, and half is a hopped apple and citrus fruitiness. Somewhat lagerish and also an ale. Some peachy colour, and a maltiness in the aroma. The X could be some wheat or even flour, there may be some cinammon in here. Not a bad one."
"Poured from a 12oz crown cap bottle into an Imperial pint glass. Poured aggressively, resulting in a 1 finger head of foam. Clear and copper in color, it left a nice lacing. Started with a malty, sherry like nose with an ""off"" smell I couldn't identify. I started this one out too cold and it little flavor at first, but progressed into a malty, toffee like quality. I thought it finished poorly with a petrol (fusel alcohol?) flavor on the roof of my mouth. I thought it to be thin for the style and didn't care for it. I've liked several of Boulder's other offerings, but not this one."
"A deep rosey brown ale with thin but solid tan head and fine lacing. A very welcoming aroma of malt and herbal hops, deep and sweet with some nutty caramel present. Beautiful. A very drinkable malty sweet bread flavor with very nice carbonation and midland body. Thinner than I expected for the style but it made it that much more drinkable, more so than most winter warmers I think. It has an odd blend of sweet horshound and bitter root. It grows on you. Smells a little more inviting than it tastes but it is very nice and excellent quality. This could fill a pretty long session I would think!"
"This isn't your typical overly spiced winter warmer, but that's what I really like about it. Good blend of flavors and decent complexity. I give it a big thumbs up in my book."
"Notes: Somewhat disappointing, but not altogether bad - just mediocre. I won't pick this one up again."
"Carbonation is acceptable but unfortunately the beer feels stretched quite thin across my palate. Not quite up to par for a winter warmer in this respect, but otherwise an enjoyable beer I had little trouble finishing, and even less trouble envisioning another in my glass."
"D: Good drinkability at the fireplace of the ski lodge."
"This is a great beer for the winter months. It Pours a deep amber with an off-white head that has excellent lacing throughout consumption. It smells of candied fruit and spices with a slight hop characteristic. The taste is very sweet. The fruit and nutmeg are prevolent throughout and it finishes with slight hops. It is very pleasing on the palate and is just chunky enough for winter warmer in the mouth. I could easily drink a sixer of this in a heartbeat. It's an easy drinker and always leaves a nice warm feeling in the belly. An excellent winter beer! Cheers!"
"D'ability - A nice malty, roasty beer with nice balance."
"D- Good beer, very sessionable, and nicely balanced."
"there yet. It's not bad, though."
"Not the most delicious brew, and probably not something I would consider winter warmer, rather it's an American version of a Belgian dark to me, as it's pretty sugary and malty. Judge for yourself, but enjoy it regardless."
"22oz bottle on sale for $2.50 so what the hell right? nice dark amber color with a super malty smell. The taste was a nice subtle malty flavor and I quickly drank two glasses. nice stuff and reaffirms my belief in the quality of Boulder Beers. Colorado rules."
"D - This is a very nice winter warmer. It has a nice blend of malt and spices."
"I agree with a few reviews that this tastes more like an amber ale than a winter warmer."
"This is a light and enjoyable little winter number. It could definitely make for a nice winter session."
"Side Note : I think this style is not a ""Winter Warmer"" this tastes to me like an ""Amber Ale"" instead."
"Boulder Beer is really impressing me. I've been grabbing random stuff whenever I can find it, and its well worth it. And, at their price point, I'm really happy w/ it."
"From a 12oz bottle that I copped singly at Wine and More in West Orange, pours a brownish, copper- honey-dew color that presented itself with a decent head... smell is sweet and full of caramel... taste was really good, full of cinnamon and ginger sweetness... I really liked this brew, though I have had better samples of the style... a good taste that presents itself as an easy brew to drink... goes down smooth and the relatively low alcohol percentage for a winter warmer makes for really good drinkability... would probably try this again, as it was a satisfying brew... never heard of this company before, but I gotta' recommend this one... a good, solid brew..."
"Poured a nice dark amber color with a one finger caramel brown head with traces of lacing. Loved the smell of this winter warmer while pouring into a slightly frosted mug. Tasted a hint of citrus in the hops and other spices that my palate couldn't differentiate. Excellent mouthfeel and after taste. This is one of my favorite winter warmers. This review based on my fourth bottle of the my original six pack."
"Notes: Unfortunately I only bought a single of this at Olivers as I'd never heard of it before; while drinking it I couldn't help but wish I'd bought an entire 6-pack, as I would've like to have had another (and maybe even another after that). . . . Flavorful with a nice hop/malt balance to it and just a hint of spice. I wouldn't characterize it as an over-the-top spiced-up ""winter warmer"" in style, but more like an ""American Winter Pale Ale," if that makes any sense. Definitely worth checking out."
"D: Very drinkable. I could see this being a very good session beer."
"Drank easy, but just a tad too simple for as winter warmers go. Slightly better tap IMO"
"Drinkability - this is good ale, but not a great one. I'd go for two bottles of this every so often, after those I'd want a change of taste."
"Overall a pretty tasty winter warmer. Rather well balanced."
"Final Note: a very different Winter Warmer"
"Starts off with a beautiful, deep amber-red appearance in the glass. Smells wonderful -- lots of toasty sweet malts, caramel and cinnamon spices. The depth of flavors are ok -- is a little on the sweet side, but there's enough hop bitterness to balance out and the spices are not overpowering. A very solid, easy-drinking brew."
"Drinkability: As the beer warmed, it was a little easier to enjoy, but it has a harshness and a lack of balance that is a detraction"
"Let this one warm up, I got zero hops straight out of the fridge. Once at a decent drinking temperature, I tasted smooth American citrus hops over a subtle caramel malt. I don't think this really qualifies in my mind as a strong ale, there's no crazy element like the best. It's more an American Red along the lines of Magic Hat's Roxy Rolles."
"The aroma was malty with some alcoholic esters arising from the hops. The taste of the beer was balanced a tiny bit spicy. In the mouth it was thin and left its trail all through the tongue like a slug on its journey to a meal. Overall a good Winter beer."
"Overall- A good quaffable session."
"This is a well crafted, balanced beer that would appear to fit the style, but for the lower (5.94%) abv. It is one of those rich, full flavored beers that go so well with the colder weather. As mentioned above, this maybe more so than others, needs to be served at the appropriate temperature to fully enjoy it's nuances. Overall, it is smooth and easy drinking, and while it may not display all the characteristics of a ""strong"" ale, it does fit nicely into my favorite category: Quality Brew."
"Overall a moderately flavored beer with good drinkability."
"It strikes me as a technically sound beer that falls short in the personality department. The malt is tasty, and the hops apparent, but there's no pizzazz. And yet, the plain-Jane nature helps make this a pretty fairly drinkable session brew, should one feel so inclined. Me, I'll finish this sixer, and while I won't say never, I will say that a return is not a priority."
"And a strong ale? Huh. Not so much."
"Overall: A good representation of the style, worth a try if you spot one."
"Perfect example of why sampler packs are useful. Not a terrible beer - but nothing I'd like again either."
"drinkability - A good balance of hops and malt here. Loved this beer."
"This beer poured an amber color with a nice head  tight bubbles; some lacing. The aroma is of malt and slightly sour. When tasting the hops are noticeable immediately, followed by the mellowness of the malt. They compliment each other well. The mouthfeel is full and works for the beer. This is a nice brew that Id consider highly drinkable."
"This came from a 12 oz bottle purchased in Ashland, Oregon and poured a copper color with a nice foamy white head and good lacing. Nose of malts and hops. Good clean mouthfeel and lots of nice flavors of malts and hops with some spices. Finish long and slightly bitter. Good brew."
"D- Not bad a little too hoppy for my liking, but if you like that then it would be for you."
"edit - 12/16/09 Yepper, now available here in the area ! Nice !"
"Never Summer poured a nice copper red color with a creamy head. The head did however diminish but hung to the sides to lace as it goes down the side. The smell was nice and malty with just a hint of hops. The flavor matched the nose with a great malt taste up front and a strong backbone on the tongue. The finish is clean and leaves just a hint of bittering hops. The mouthfeel is smooth for a beer boating 5+% alcohol and with so much malt, a pleasant surprise! A drinkable beer do to its smooth feel and soft taste, just watch the ABV! Enjoy!"
"Drinkability: Good balance between hops and malt. A nice beer overall."
"Pour a nice ruby red with a big creamy head. Smells of malt and maple sugar. Taste is somewhat flat; I get the malt, but not much of the aggresive hops that label claims the beer has. I really can't detect any other flavor profiles in this beer. The carbonation is nice for this style. Certainly a winter warmer that you dirnk all night long. Not too bad...not too great."
"D - I could drink this again."
"Not bad in terms of drinkability but I'd probably look elsewhere if I was in the mood for a couple of strong ales - Stone Arrogant Bastard or even Great Divide's Hibernation Ale are more complex beers than this one."
"This is a very good beer. Nice balanced. Pours a deep brown with a nice white head that leaves beautiful lacing around the glass, and beautiful designs with every sip draw from the glass. Smells sweet, spicy, malty. Tastes delicious, very well balanced, tiny bubbles make my tongue happy. Has a nice hop bite at the end. Possibly my favorite session beer out."
"i wouldnt really call it a strong ale - not sure what i would call it, but it is way too mild for that classification. nevertheless, it is quite a quaffable brew, and highly drinkable. make it a six-pack night."
"This is a very tasty winter seasonal beer. It's very unique and distinct. I like it."
"Pours a coppery, deep amber in color, and nearly brilliant. Off white head of medium duration and moderate lacing doesn't seem to promise what I'm looking for on this sub zero, windy weekend. I let this warm a bit, as I've learned from several visits that this taste better a bit warmer than 'straight from the 'fridge."". Nose is malty, offering up notes of plum, prune, and ripe apple, along with plenty of citric hops for the style. Smooth and a bit creamy from the outset, with more sweet than sour at first. Seems to achieve better balance with subsequent sips, with the fruit notes of the mildy robust dark malts blending well with some light, biscuity malt, and a very easy-going balance of sweet and tangy. Some diacetyl, but it's not intrusive. Hop bitterness is pretty minimal, but the aromatic aspects are very rewarding. A little bit yeasty, in a good way. Reasonable good mouthfeel and drinkability: it tricks you a bit into thinking it's a 'bigger' beer, when it at first seems thin for the style. I like my strong ales a bit stronger, but overall this has a filling, substantial heft and drinkability. The alcohol is mildly warming, and all but invisible on the palate. Never Summer isn't one of those mind-blowingly weird spiced winter ales that people seem to avoid, but is instead a very easy going yet full-flavored seasonal offerings. It's well worth a try. NOTE: After trying Boulder's ""Killer Penguin"" barleywine last year the Never Summer seems more and more like that beer's stylistic precursor, not a 'small beer' version by any means, but they definitely have a lot in common! Of the two I prefer Never Summer: it's a well-executed rendition of the American Strong Ale style."
"Beer poured a deep red with a nice white head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose is bready and a tad bit grassy. Taste is of caramel malts, dry hops, and it almost seems like an ever so slight hint of Christmas spice is included to make this a somewhat unique taste. Mouthfeel is smooth going down and somewhat creamy. Overall drinkability is good as the abv does not knock one down in round one. This is quite the enjoyable beer!"
"A nice medium range winter warmer, it might not get the big ""Wow", but it's a nice every-winter-day kind of brew."
"Drinkability: I enjoyed this beer, but the tea-like flavor just isn't my thing, so I couldn't drink a whole lot of this stuff."
"Part of a ""Beer of the Month"" pack. And if the rest of the months are this great, things are lookin' up! Deep brown color in the glass with nice head and lacing; malt and a definite but delicate hop scent in the nose. Taste is rich malt with a very nice hop ""bite"" to add a touch of fruity bitterness and complete the formula for what is really a wonderfully drinkable, complex ale. Another winner from Boulder!"
"Pours medium brown, no head, tiny bit of lacing, lightly carbonated. Smells of caramel malts and a little bit of alcohol. Taste is mediocre, not very malty, but very alcohol-y. For a strong ale I would highly expect a lot more ABV and some more powerful flavors. This one hits a little below the mark for a strong ale."
"Smell is a strong malt profile with almost no hops. Reminds me of barleysugar. Taste is much the same--very sweet and somewhat sticky in the mouthfeel. There are maybe some slight fruit elements on the palate. Not in a hurry to try this one again."
"Had on tap at Untamed Steakhouse in Winter Park, CO. It is a dark red/brown beer, with a dense but thin tan head. The smell is very intriguing. Wassal and hops. Definitely a winter beer. The taste is spice and hops up front, with a caramel malt back and then a hop finish. The hops are more flavoring than bittering and the beer strikes a nice hop/malt balance. The mouthfeel is silky and light, with a nice carbonation. Drinkability - it doesn't get much better. The balanced flavor is not too aggressive, not too bland. It's the kind of beer you could really settle into a cold winter's night with."
"A decent brew, just a little too much spice for my taste. Still, I had no problems finishing the bottle."
"Tasted: 01/04/06"
"Thanks to fellow BA mtanji for the gift."
"Quite good and very sessionable. Nice winter offering."
"One of the better winter brews out there. Not the most ""warming"" or spicy but tasty and ""sessionable"" for the style."
"Poured beer into tumbler at 50 degrees. beer was a nice red/brown about the color of gasoline years ago. Smell was slightly nutty bready with a light hoppy taste, but not too overpowering. Head was fast decaying with slight lacing. Was a interesting beer to try but will not purchase again."
"The feel is thick and syrupy. Mediciny. It's hard to drink for me. Has too much of a Robitussin sweetness with no bitter or hop balance. Not a pleasant drink for me."
"Drinkability: allow this one to warm up. I could drink several of these in one sitting. Not overpowering."
"22 oz bomber . Nice smart and tidy looking ale, dark bronze with a nice sized tan head to begin with ,however this fades fast leaving slotchy lace. Spicy hop aromas but rather subdued somehow..pine accents. Malty dark bitter flavour, then resinous pine notes , and a taste of spice before it finishes. Rather dry and quick finish , but feels rather invigorating in the mouth. Quite a nice laid back beer. well worth a pint!"
"Drinkability: easy to quaff and could be a nice staple in the refridgerator for the winter months."
"Boy, this is a quality brew. A nice top of the line strong here. Nice craggy head, stays with the beer throughout. Nice esthery cherry/plum flavors on the nose with a smooth hoppy kickback at the end. Almost like a red ale/ipa, similar to Troegs hopback amber. Highly recommended and resonably priced. Nice session beer."
"Pours a reddish-brown color with a foamy one-finger head that leaves some lacing. The smell is sweet, citrusy and of hops. The taste is a nice balance of malt and hops. There is also some berry flavor and a bit of alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Pretty good drinkability. Overall, this is a decent winter seasonal."
"I am fairly impressed by this brew. This is a very nice addition to anyone's winter beer menu. The great caramel malt foundation and mix piney, citrusy hops is balanced to the point where the flavors transition well enough to enjoy both equally."
"D: I think I'd pass on this if it came around again. Maybe I got a bad one as the carbonation was a bit non-existent."
"Pours a nice deep ruby red color with about a one inch head. Has some great malt flavor and smelll that reminds me of some caramel. Only has a slight hint of spice, not to much, not to little to make this a find addition to anyones winter. Definitly worth a try, i cant wait to try it again on a snowy day."
"This beer is eminently drinkable right now, light and quaffable, yet has lots of flavor to keep one interested, but not so much as to distract one from a social session of beer drinking. With an apparent lack of bottle conditioning it will probably deteriorate pretty quickly (like the mojo, which is stellar fresh, but ages quickly), so get some fresh and drink it up."
"As is/was the case with the other Boulder beers in their Looking Glass series, I liked this one. Its well crafted and has a nice bit of flavour to it and is quite drinkable. Definitely worth a try at the least and a nice winter brew that I'll likely be going back to."
"Cheers!"
"Clear, redish toffee in color, off white head dropped quickly to a film and ring. Grainy aroma, with some dark fruits like raisin and dates, and a brown sugar like sweetness. The taste also has a brown sugar like flavor to the malt, some fruity flavors do linger but are not strong. I was impressed with a decent hop flavor in the aftertaste. Pretty easy to drink, but not all that interesting."
"Overall, a nice beer for winter. This would be a perfect addition compliment to a beef stew. Would also work as a nice base for a black and tan, or in this case, black and red."
"Comments: A hearty ale with a solid dose of malt with a bit too much bitterness, I would try again, but would like to try it fresh. As their 12-pack packaging does not indicate a bottling date, this makes it difficult. The bottles are marked, but not the outer packaging."
"Pure malts! A tinge of hot alcohol up front mixed with some dark ripe fruit and a touch of earth. 12 pack is out of season sporting a winter warmer, but this is tasty."
"A straightforward, english style winter warmer."
"Drinkability is OK but this is not what is advertised. Pretty weak version of a Winter Warmer. Just no solid malt backbone or hoppy grit. I'd call it a slightly above average amber and a pretty weak strong ale."
"A nice beer. It's another micro brewed beer trying to scratch at the surface of the craft big boys without offending it's core audience. Beyond that, a nice session beer that I wouldn't hesitate having again."
"I thought this brew was well crafted and tasty. It's not a big beer, but that's fine by me. A good change of pace as a session seasonal."
"Overall a pretty decent drinkable beer."
"I believe this is my first Boulder Beer offering even while living in Denver did I ever try any of their products.Anyways a nice pour from this beer,a deep rich amber with 1/2 finger white head,aromas were malt dominant mainly brown sugar and a touch of vanilla.A winter warmer in its big sweetness with brown sugar really hitting strong with notes of caramel and spiced cherry the hops have little presence with a light drying herbal effect in the finish.Nice flavors but I think it could be a little cloying after one or two and ""generous"" hops per the bottle were not there,still a decent beer."
"Very nice pour with a medium amber hue and moderate crown. A few streams of bubbles rize through a slightly hazy body. The aroma is malty, but very faint. The taste is somewhat complex, a strong caramel malt presence. At the same time, it was quite hoppy with a somewhat bitter, but long finish. The beer has a good mouthfeel and a nice medium body."
"Pours a dark amber, cystal clear brew with a rather sticky off white half inch head with good lacing and rentention. Aromas are mostly the caramel sweet malts with a light hopping backbone. A little alcohol is detected but not much. Drinks a light body with low carbonation. A very balanced brew with the hops and malts both making a good presence. To me, it's like an amber pale ale (strong ale?). This is an extremely drinkable brew, could be enjoyed at all times of the year. The alcohol and hop tinge hits you a bit in the end, pleasant. Nothing stellar; the body is a bit weak, somewhat watery, but easy to drink and flavorful nonetheless. Would pair well with most fast foodesque fair."
"This pours a dark ruby color with an average tan head. The smell is bready with some hops,but nothing really great. The taste has a sweet malt,nutty,carmel flavor that's pretty good. The hop presence gives this a slightly bitter aftertaste,but leaves the beer with malt and hop flavors very well balanced. This is a tasty brew that I would pick up again."
"It's tasty enough, but there's tastier beers than this to be had."
"Not much aroma, but a very nice color. Taste was pretty balanced with a bit of malt sweetness. Overall I liked this one. This is the first beer I have tried from Boulder. Based on this one, I'll have to try some of the others that we can get in CT. The website says that a secret spice is added, but I cannot really taste any spice. Maybe I'll figure it out by the time I finish the six. Good brew."
"Overall I liked it, I just wish it had a bit of a smell to it, and maybe a tad more body."
"DI like this one. Not a lot of competing flavors, but a nice combo of caramel malt and hops. I think I will have another one...or two."
"Served up at Fuel and Fuddle in Oakland the other night while listening to the ""Saturday Night Special"" Don Zjak playing his style ""whiskey blues"" good mix of everything switching it up between his ol' Gibson acoustic and Fender backed by his boy Frank George on the sax and harmonica. Now that I set the mood here's this seasonal outta Colorado appears dark caramel amber ruby with a tan two finger sized head leaves even amount of lace. Aroma contains pine cone scented hops caramel doughy dosed malt backbone. Taste is pretty even not as aggressively hopped as the label claims it is, still solid hop flavor and bitterness the pine and caramel mix to form a nice Christmas seasonal. Mouthfeel is medium bodied evenly carbonated smooth finish goes down quite nicely. Drinkability solid hoppy winter warmer not my favorite for the season but definitely a beer I would revisit in the right setting."
"Poured nice amber color from a twelve ounce bottle. Has a nice smell, can definitely smell the hops. The hops definitely are out front in the taste, but nice malt tastes too. I think this is a nicely balanced ale, I would buy it again. This is definitely worth a try."
"I like this one very much. It is multidimensional and full-flavored."
"12 ounce bottle. Clear copper, dense beige foamy cap. Decent lacing. Carmel malts and piney floral hops in the nose. Something of a sweetish spice (cinnamon?), too. Caramelly malts and a round cinnamon sweetness, followed by a mildly (definitely not ""assertive"" as claims the label) piney hop bite. Moderately bitter finish. Slight mineral aftertaste. Light body, somewhat juicy mouthfeel. Flavor is not very strong, for a ""strong ale"" at least. Easy enough to drink, but I don't know that I'd seek this out again."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" tan head over the clear dark copper brew. Head fades slowly, with heavy full-coating lacing. Aroma is lightly malty, lightly hoppy, kind of boring for a strong ale. Taste is light on the grains, then the fruit and hops kick in a bit, and then the alcohol comes on at the end, with a bitter somewhat detracting aftertaste. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both pretty good, but nothing earth-shattering. Sonewhat standard strong ale here."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation is just a touch too high...either way, it is very enjoyable and just what I need on a cold winter evening. Another good one in the Looking Glass Series from Boulder. Give it a try..."
" This could be a session beer, since the ABV tips in a just under 6%. I don't think I could have more than two of these at a time, but it's worth a shot once. Definitely different than other winter beers that I've had, but nothing groundbreaking. A fair choice for those tired of the more common seasonal offerings and looking to expand outward a bit!"
"I get a ton of malt out of this one. Not a bad sign. Heavy caramel flavor is good. Not as dark as most of the winters season ales out there. That part I liked to. The hops dry out the heavy malt to add a really good balance. Another good looking glass series beer."
"Pours a deep, clear copper amber color with a not so much head but ok lacing. Smells... has a carmelized malt aroma with traces of hops bordering on piney. Tastes... like winter; lots of malts and lots of hops. The floral hops and malts are pretty well balanced, and finishes a little bit oily with traces of raisins. But its also a bit skunky, maybe because its a llittle old, so I might be compensating a little, because I can tell its a good beer, but don't believe what I'm tasting is intended or normal. Even so, its a very drinkable beer, and would buy it again."
"Pours to a clear amber color with an off-white head that diminishes to a ring. The aroma is of sweet caramel malts and a bit of toastiness. The flavor is sweet of caramel malts and a bit toasty. The hops are light in the flavor. It is light-medium in body, and easy drinking...okay, but nothing too good."
"Not bad... would buy again next year."
"Pours a dark amber with a nice head and lots of lacing.It had a malty/fruity smell. Smell is weak,not that it was bad. Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated, but not too light. If you like the hopped ale taste, this is your beer. I'm not such a big fan of that,but was glad I tried it anyway."
"This is a good beer, but doesn't quite stand up to ""an aggressive winter seasonal"" as the label would have you expect. It's easy to drink and has few faults, but it's just not very exciting. Perhaps it shouldn't be."
"The body is limited with more of a mid moderate feel. The sweetness helps but would like more depth. There is a slight alcohol/fusel note but light. Overall a good beer but would like a bit more complexity."
"Dark amber with aromas of sweet malt and resiny hops. Malty flavor up-front along with some spices (cinammon and maybe allspice?), then some woody hop character at the finish. Surprisingly light bodied for a beer with a somewhat ""festive"" flavor profile. Overall, it's drinkable stuff, but nothing too spectacular."
"The beer pours a dark ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts along with mild hop aroma. The taste is decent. It has a toasted caramel flavor that goes down easy and finishes light and slightly warm. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good seasonal beer. It has good aroma and a nice malty flavor; a good drinker."
"Malt really comes through in the flavor, too, with a spicy caramel taste that plays well off of some of the citric notes in the hops. Overall, though, it's a bit too malty for me for the style. The mouthfeel especially is a bit thick, and even with the somewhat interesting nutmeg spice notes, I don't really like this one."
"Impression: A nice winter beer. More hoppy than most, but that is my preferrence. Good beer for the money."
"Nice ruby red color, not much head. The aroma has mostly molasses with some citric hopiness. Not the ""aggressive"" hopiness I expected from the bottle description. The taste seems mostly malty upfront - carmel and molasses flavor are dominant. There are some hops in the finish, though also a little bit of a metallic finish. Medium bodies with nice carbonation. It doesn't seem to be anything too special, I could drink it at a party or something, but I would look for something better first."
"Overall - A respectable brew that I have no major problems with although I'd recommend others over it."
"As my native Coloradan friend (who is contributing to this review) says, this is a very typical good Colorado microbrew. ""Everything that's good about Colorado microbrews"" he says. Certainly no Avery, say I. But I like it."
"It has a smooth quick mouth with little after taste just a slight hop bitterness. It is good for a short session of one ore two beers. Not light but not that strong either."
"Overall: Well balanced, an excellent winter brew."
"Pours a two-finger cream head that stays leaving a lot lace. Clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Hoppy nose. Starts with more hops than malts, hoppy finish with a hint of sweetness, hoppy aftertaste. Typical American pale. $1.45 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"quite nice"
"A whiskey drinker might think of this as a Jack Daniels without the alcohol content."
"The body is smooth. Man, this beer really hits the spot."
"Overall very nice. Like a more balanced SNCA with darker caramel flavor and muted flavor and aroma hops. Pleasantly surprised."
"This brew is a deep amber/brown color, small tan head on the top. Thick caramel malt scent, some bitter hop undertones. The taste is more like a amber ale than a PA, caramel malt front, some decent bittering hop in the finish. Medium mouth. Like i said, i would call this an amber before i called it a PA, overall its alright but nothing amazing."
"Reflection: If your looking for a good winter seasonal this isn't it. This beer doesn't stand out in any way, it's not a bad beer but I was expecting more."
"Maybe some hop spiciness from an old-country variety would be enough, but it doesn't really stand out as a winter ale."
"This is one wonderful brew. I'm not much of a correander person, and that would be typical of many winter beers. This isn't like that. Instead, Rockie's choice of flavors makes for what I consider the most enjoyable winter brew I have experienced. Kudos!"
"Not a bad brew here, just not one I'd buy again."
"worth a six pack every winter, just not worth a case or two of the winter seasonals i enjoy more."
"poured with a average tannish head and a deep amber reddish color. thick syrupy malsty and bready aroma with some alcohol and a spicy hop aroma. light body and mouthfeel, very misleading from the aroma. has a mild chocolatly note and some decent hop character. more toward and ipa I think but who cares, very drinkable and a decent beer."
"Pours a dark red color with no head and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma is caramel malts and a subdued hop. The flavor is well balanced - caramel malt sweetness with an adequate amount of hops. A little weak in the hops for an APA, but still a very good beer that I would have again."
"A very nice brew. Poured a very nice amber with a chunky head that leaves an excellent lacing. Smell is a nice blend of malt and hops...invite you to try more. Taste is likewise a blend of malt and hops....starts sweet on the front palate and finishes in a light hop finish...lends an overall smoothness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth quality...lightly slick. Very easy on the palate as far as drinkability goes...would be easy to have more than one."
"Thanks to clvand0 for this beer. It pours a ruby red color with no real head. The nose is deep caramel malts with nice earthy hops that balance well with it. The flavor is nice, with a good sweetness to balance the earthy hop better than other APA's I've had recently. I like this for an APA. Most tend to be too much on the earthy side, but this one balances well between sweet and earthy. The feel is just moderate, but still nice. I would want just a hair more. Drinkability is also good on this one. All around, one of the better APA's I've had in a while."
"Never Summer Ale (a great name and a great label) is a 'tweener' and deserves some credit for originality. It comes off as a slightly weaker, less complex, hoppier version of a classic winter warmer. I found it to be delicious and will definitely look for it again. Keep an eye on the Looking Glass series of beers from Boulder. The two that I've had so far have been excellent."
"This really looked like a strong contender at first, but then faltered leaving the starting gate and never got back on its feet. Poured a radiant garnet. Nose was a bit sweet, with modest floral hops. I'm thinking this will be along the lines of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale. The malt was insubstanital, failing to keep the promise of the appearance. Hopping was likewise lacking in follow through on the aroma. Overall, on the thin side, with some acidic notes. Lackluster. Verdict - a winter ale for Florida."
"The spices, while noticeable, are very subdued and I would have liked a little more pronounced flavor - but despite it's shortcomings, I still very much enjoyed this beer. Warmed me up on a cold winter day."
"Pours a mahogany brown color, with sizable tan head. Smell is sweet with floral hops and spices, with hints of cinammon and corriander. Big malt presence, to really balance out this beer. This is a very different APA, if it turely is one. It has a larger malt presence, and a spicier flavor (on top of the normal hoppiness of the style). Very, very good."
"An easy-to-drink winter beer that doesn't beg to be contemplated."
"2003 edition, cellared for 8 months or so. Pours a clear, ruby-tinted chestnut beneath a creamy head of ivory foam that holds well and leaves some nice rings of craggy lace at the outset of the glass. Piney and citrusy hops ride atop a delicate caramelish malt in the aroma. The body is medium and it's got a surprisingly fine-bubbled, moderate carbonation that lends a light caress to the tongue before allowing it to fade smoothly away. The hops and malt indicated by the nose are exactly what's found in the flavor. They're well-entwined and work almost as one with the fruitiness of the citrusy hops giving a bit of a spark to its otherwise dry, slightly molasses-kissed malt. Piney hop flavor and a bit of spice (?) appear at the swallow as its bitterness steps forward. It finishes dry and lingering with bitterness, pine, and sublime spice. A decent enough holiday or winter beer that's probably worth trying."
"Overall, a solid offering. Big thanks to Blatzman for the bottle!"
"I was really suprised with the balance and complexity of this beer. It reminds me of a subdued American style barlewine. A very good brew indeed."
"Thanks anyway, Huge"
"Pours a deep reddish amber with a creamy, off-white head. Aroma of malt and light astringency. Foams up pretty big in the mouth. Palate of deep malt, light hoppiness, and light spice (nutmeg, clove). Decent, but not really what I look for in a winter ale."
"Thanks to BigHuge for this Boulder, Colorado offering, much appreciated."
"The Never Summer poured a ruby red, with a thin head that dissipated quickly to a collar. It had a pleasing sweet malt smell with a hints of spices. It has a sweet malt start with a spicy, hoppy finish. The tastes are well balanced. The palate was a little on the thin side. Overall, a nice winter brew...great tasting, and very drinkable."
"Dark and clear amber-copper color, nice foamy off white head that leaves some lace in the glass, malty caramel aroma, sweet malty nutty flavors, medium bodied with a soft and light mouthfeel. It does finish with a nice and clean dryness , not bad at all."
"Final Thoughts: Part of a mixed six, this was not the most enjoyable beer of the bunch. Would have guessed by its one-dimensional profile that it was a strong/old ale, not a herb/spiced beer. Slightly disappointing. I guess I expected too much."
"Clear cherrywood color...nice 1/4 inch creamy tan head...nose is sweet caramel...I like the way it smells..body a little light for a winter...medium body but leans toward the lighter side of medium...nice sweet flavor..caramel notes...surprisingly finishes dry and tight...theres some strategic hopping here...overall an enjoyable beer...not a top tier winter beer but decent enough...I wish this had more body, but enjoyable to drink..."
"Hazen deep ruby brownish color with a soft tannish head about a finger high that sits briefly, lace gets some spots sticking as it goes. Smell is inticing with a nice mingling of dark caramel malts and spicy/herbal hops that has a touch of pineyness to it and woodish notes. Taste is all together bland and characterless, lacks depth, richness, and above all taste. The front is upheld in some light mild maltyness and roasty tones, thin, with metallic notes, the hops come through in the finish which were nice and had some spicy hints and pine but had a watery taste that always seemed to keep getting in the way. Which didn't help the feel at all, very thin and watery. There's nothing warming or ""assertively hopped"" as it states about it. Its got hops, thats for sure, assertively? Nah...another look in the looking glass series they need to do with this one. Never Summer is never good. Average all the way, borderline boring."
"Deep ruby hue; thin off-white ring, minor carbonation. Some winter spices and malts, even some hops graze the nose, most pleasantly. Sharp malts off the cuff, some cinammon and even caramel notes. Hop-dominated palate, decent amount of carbonation. Spicy notes in patches, decently hopped, fresh fruit finish, a throat grabber. Decent winter beverage."
"The beer departs the 12-ounce brown bottle a deep garnet color with the head modest, creamy in texture and a nice light tan, as it slowly dissolves; the lace forms a tight sheet to conceal the glass. Malt dominated nose, just a hint of spice, fresh, clean and sweet with the start nicely malted and lightly sweet, top was a bit thin for my liking which detracts much, just not enough body,. Finish is well hopped, spicy and pleasing to the palate, very dry aftertaste and a drinkable brew, maybe just a tad above average, if it only had more body?"
"Something seems lacking. Somewhat bold, esp. in the hops, but somehow still not full or firm enough. Doesn't get smooth enough. Drinkable, but doesn't separate itself from the pack."
"The ""looking glass series"" hasn't impressed me very much."
"I thought that since this was in their Looking Glass Series, it would be a bit on the wilder, not the milder side, and I was wrong. Not a bad beer, very drinkable, with an appreciable taste, but certainly a far cry from what I was thirsting for..."
"Clear deep ruby. Nice looking beer. A bubbly beige head laces with sufficiency. Nose is spicy... dark spices and spicy hop tones. Add some dark caramel maltiness and you have an inviting nose. They peg this beer to be ""assertively hopped"" and "" a more aggressive winter seasonal."" I beg to differ. This isn't bad, but it's just not that bold. The underlying dark caramel malts lay down a nice maltiness. And working on top of that is some spicy hops. Somewhat tasty, but nothing real ""warming"" about this one. A good try, but not one of the big boys."
"Clear dark copper color, yellowish head of two bubble sizes but not much height. Vertical dot and string lace. Neutral aroma, leans toward maple syrup with some black pepper background. Mouthfeel is medium as is carbonation, malt is heavy on cinnamon and brown sugar, some black cherry, but hauled back by floral and somewhat ashy hopping. Hits the back of the throat thickly, with a little bit of heat. Overall, a better-than-average beer, but a little too tight and underspiced for my expectations, came off almost as an ESB..."
"Clear bronzy-auburn hue, the slightly off-white head reached a very modest half-finger in height before fading to a scummy, soapy collar rather quickly. Spotty lace. Looks decent enough. Good aromas, hoppy with pine and citrus influences, malty goodness too, a kiss of fruit. Fair potency, a little more authority would be welcomed; it is inviting. The palate is pleasantly hoppy, very unexpected actually. The outright bitterness is solid but the hops add flavorful depth (largely piney a hint of citrus) that can be found squarely on top of the sweet, slightly toffee-like malts. The spiciness is mild, hot candy-like. This is a mighty tasty beverage and yet another reason to take note of the Looking Glass Series. Medium-full body, modest and appropriate carbonation that produces a pleasant, effortless, mouthfeel. This is a beer I am impressed with and something I need to quaff again. Lovely stuff. Try one."
"Drinkability: A good winter ""warmer"" that is worth a try."
"In my opinion, this is the first dud in the Looking Glass Series of beers."
"Clear blonde hue, with a faint murk. Thin, but dense, persistent, porcelain white head leaves diffuse lace. Soft, doughy malt accompanied by a floral hop and grainy tart wheat combination upfront in aroma. Bated hint of clove phenol and honeyish sweetness add an herbally sweet contrast. Unique, but not well rounded aromawise. Transient wash of white bread sweetness incipient on flavor is ensued by a drying, yet lingering suggestion of lightly astringent wheat chaff and orange pith. Mellows mid palate, and notes of underbaked lemon cookie surface to provide token, but welcome malt character. Lightly bodied, with a functional, forgettable mouthfeel conducive to easy quaffing. Finishes concomitantly dry, metallic and tartly citric. An odd brew that attempted to stand out from the typically insipid filtered American wheat, but failed. Never Summer Ale is a decent brew overall, but no more. I realize now that this is a winter seasonal... this could be much better fresh."
"Alcohol by Volume: 5.94%."
