Unlike some spiced winter warmers the spices are an integral part of the flavor rather than something that dominates it.  That said, however, if I were going to stock up on a Winter Warmer I think I'd still give the Lancaster Brewing Winter Warmer the nod in preference to this one, if only because I like the way Lancaster Brewing have used both British and American hops and because of the the greater warmth from the higher ABV.","drtth","Jan 25, 2015"

Really no hops I sense from the nose. This is all the malt bill. Taste is a bit mellowed down from the smell except there is a tiny hop presence that isn't noticeable at the first part of the taste but definitely in the end -- nothing too bitter to be sure as this is really balanced well. Mouthfeel is fairly light. Overall I really liked this beer more than the last time I had it. Summit typically puts out good beers at least with their normal releases.","NeedBeerHere","Dec 09, 2013"

Pours moderately cloudy reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, chocolate, light roast, brown bread, light raisin, light floral, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark and nutty malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, chocolate, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, brown bread, light roast, light floral, and toasted earthiness. Light earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, chocolate, brown bread, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark and nutty malt notes; with very nice robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice winter warmer style. All around nice balance and robustness of dark/nutty malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. Really enjoyed this one.","superspak","Jul 02, 2013"

This is a beer best left to warm up quite a bit before that first sip, otherwise its complexity is far less evident. Toffee-ish malts in the finish and a hint of tannin.

4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"I've been drinking this beer too long now to be disappointed, but a funky off-flavor in the tap pour I had last night made me wonder. Pours the same crimson-amber I remember so well, with a rocky dark tan head. Nose is pungent, verily oozing the contents of its unctious nut-brown-on-steroids self into the air that surrounds my tiny head: so far so good! Lace that stretches from here to next year, really impressive when poured into the right glass (bulb in this case) and speaking of right glass did anyone else notice the new logo-embossed bottles? I thought so . . . nice touch in the packaging department and definitely adds to an already great beer and solid brewery. The nose offers toffee, rum, and some dates, along with a fair amount of bitterness and carmalized/roasted malts ala the Great Northern Porter (and that's a good thing as GNP has been my favorite Summit brand since day 1.) The diacetyl doesn't bother me here and never has, as I've found it to be a consistent part of Summit's stylistic interpretation for years. A bit creamy on the tongue, with evidence of the alcohol both present and welcoming. Not a "thin" brew . . . if anyone ever calls this beer thin please give them a bowl of oatmeal to go with it! It *can* be a bit sweet for some, in fact I'd go so far as to say treacly-sweet at one moment, but offset by a slightly-smokey, roasted malt bitterness the next. This bitterness lingers quite a bit, the way a nice hop bitterness does, and acts as the counterpoint to the fruity notes (cherry, plum, and cocoa as it warms a bit . . . ) Fruity in the right way, roasty and toasty in the right ways (malt and alcohol), Summit Winter is a great beer that has probably been outshined by other beers-of-the-moment in the past ten years or so, but it's been consistent, year after year, for almost as long as I can remember - reason enough for me to buy a case every winter!","Chaz","Dec 12, 2006"

It has a sort of fruity-spice...almost like cherry, but not in a good way, with molasses. It just rubs me the wrong way. The feel is a very light moderate with a moderate carbonation.

From looking at the bottle, it doesn't look like they bottle condition their brews, but whatever they're doing to carbonate them, it's working well. This beer is a bit like a brown, a bit like a porter, and I'm a fan of both styles. Between the taste and the creamy mouthfeel, this is quite the drinkable beer. I wish it were a little less drying to the palate (though I don't mind the lack of sweetness--why is that also called "dry"?), but the other aspects make me want more.

3.93,5.6,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Pours a clear, ruby-tinted mahogany beneath a short lid of creamy off white foam that drops shortly but maintains a wide collar, whispy surface covering, and leaves some craggy streaks and spots of lace with each sip. The nose is limited but clean; and it offers a touch of roastiness above some mild, grainy malt. The body is decidedly medium and it's very fine, restrained carbonation leaves it creamy and smooth in the mouth. In fact, it's very similar to a engine-pulled cask ale or a nitro-pour. It really needs to warm a bit before its flavors come out, but when they do some dark caramel with an almost burnt-sugar edge and some subtle chocolatey notes join with its mild roastiness in the flavor. A touch of fruitiness and some sublime spice lend a bit of additional character; and its firm bitterness also combines with its roastiness to leave it dry in the finish. Quite interesting.

The nose is very pleasant with dark yet restrained fruits upfront, quickly followed by light butterscotch and chocolate, straightforward maltiness. Fairly good potency sparks the invitation. The depth on the tongue is solid with a pleasant chocolate maltiness found up-front and then a delicious hoppy bitterness is introduced in the middle (yummy!). The finish has a lovely buttery English Old Ale twist on the end. The palate is respectable and very enjoyable to quaff, however it failed to blow me away. The carbonation is low, which would work better if the body were a little fuller. Still worth trying if you have not, Ill gladly drink it again.

Taste is mild and plain with light notes of burnt roasted malts, a touch of old coffee and nutty dryness mixes over the top and in the finish. Has some woodish, dry hop notes. Nothing stands out but the dryness, which is a bit uneven and not all that good as it goes down. Feel is a bit thin with a drying texture midway through to the finish which coats the mouth and tongue with a dry spongy, spiked, lightly harsh cotton mouth. A slightly weak, boring, and a pretty unpleasant glass of beer. Smooth this out, get rid of the harsh dryness and texture and i might be interested in it again.

3.63,-2.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The beer pours an enormously deep garnet color; the head is medial in size, creamy in texture, the color a light tan, as it evanesces the lace forms a covering sheet upon the glass. Malt dominates the lightly sweet nose, fresh and clean to the senses, with the start nicely malt and somewhat sweet, top middling in feel. Finish has a pertinent acidity, the hops deliberate in their spiciness, very dry lingering aftertaste. Quite a nice drinkable beer from a brewery that is new to me, and my thanks goes to feloniousmonk for this bottle and several other all waiting in the fridge to be sampled, my friend, this beer is gladly quaffed in your honor.","Gusler","Apr 12, 2003"
3.29,-11.6,4.5,3,3.5,3,3," Pours very appealing dark brown in color with a small tan head. The sweet mild aroma of caramel and malts seems ordinary for this winter ale. Butterscotch and chocolate just begins to describe the malt presence here. This is a nice brew but it lacks something to spice up the malts. Thanks Feloniousmonk for my first taste of a Summit brew, i look forward to more of Summit Brewing offerings.","paceyourself","Apr 07, 2003"
3.48,-6.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Pretty dark overall with some amber colors showing through the light. Pretty malty, good mix of flavors, hardly noticeable taste of hopps. . The head was off white, but disappeared pretty quickly. Not my favorite that ive had in a while, but deffinately worth checking out.","Tballz420","Mar 18, 2003"

3.91,5.1,4.5,3.5,4,3,4.5,"Deep ruby hue with brilliant clarity evident when held to light. Light beige, well retained, uniform, one fingered head manages loose lace. Dark caramel, raisiny fruitiness, w/ mellow chocolate and mild butterscotch in aroma. Understated floral hop nose, with a whiff of earthiness as well. Tame, yet quite pleasant aromawise. Cocoa laced sweetness upfront in flavor yields to drying notes of biscuit and moderate hop bitterness. Clean, rounded dark caramel with a roasted edge emerge mid palate along with a lightly spicy hop flavor. Subdued hints of molasses complement both caramel malt derived and residual unfermented sweetness. Lightly bodied, with a passably smooth, lightly dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes slightly dry, with suggestions of anise and baker's chocolate. For such a light beer, this brew packs a wallop of flavor. It's certainly not a strong ale, but a damn tasty brew that I could drink all night. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for the bottle.","marc77","Feb 13, 2003"
3.25,-12.6,4,4,3,2.5,3,"Overall an ok ale but I think there are better and bolder versions of winter ale out there. Perhaps this would make a nice cross over or first time beer for someone having the style for the first time.","purplehops","Feb 12, 2003"

3.48,-6.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Pours a dark brown with a thin but persistent head that leaves behind some lace. Sweet aroma of caramel, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Flavor was dominated by sweet malt, with some backing spices... nutmeg was quite noticeable. Has a very viscous body, which, combined with the sweetness, lowers the drinkability. Not one of the best seasonal offerings, but a decent winter brew.","zerk","Jan 09, 2003"
4.18,12.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Spicy and warm, but still mellow and soothing. Seems to lack an "oomph " from years ago, or maybe my tongue has tempered.","feloniousmonk","Dec 26, 2002"
3.9,4.8,4,4,4,4,3.5,"A dark brown, mahogany color with a tan head. Aroma is of a heavily malted beer. This beer is slightly big and heavy with the roatsed malts dominating the flavor up front. Slight alcohol warming effect is noted. Hops balance the beer and keep the finish fairly neutral until the hop bitterness and alcohol really show themselves in the very end. Finish slightly effects the drinkability, but still good overall. A solid winter ale with a big malt character.","PhantomVodoo","Dec 16, 2002"

3.95,6.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours an intriguing dark ruby-brown color with shallow but tight head that dissipates almost immediately other than at the edges. Nose is a mix of alcohol warmth and a roasted, spicy scent. Taste is dominated by a mix of sweetness and spicy alcohol warmth, both of which don't persist as long as one would like. Mouthfeel is a bit oily, but that's not uncommon in this sort of beer. Drinkability, on the other hand, is a bit better than one might expect.","BitteBier","Dec 09, 2002"
3.43,-7.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours to a mahogany color, with a light-brown head that lasts. The nose is of roasted malt. Flavors are toasted malt, with hints of chocolate. There is also a spiciness to the flavor as well. It is a rich beer that is light-medium in body, with light carbonation, and a slight alcoholic warmth. Overall, it is a well balanced beer.","BeerBuilder","Nov 25, 2002"
3.58,-3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Deep clear dark reddish brown, 1/4 inch pillow floats on top. Sweet malt aroma, spiked with a little cinnamon impression. Thick malty mouthfeel, starts heavy with a little honey/maple-like flavor, takes an upward kick into an orange pekoe, and finishes with a paprika-like hop pepperiness. Didn't notice a caramel or chocolate sensation. Body is nice, seems to me that Summit does more interesting things with its malt bill on other beers. Balance is good. Decent, not groundbreaking -- I might be in a minority but this brew has never been a huge favorite for me.","ADR","Nov 04, 2002"
4.3,15.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Deep ruby/near black in color with a thin, quickly dissipating head.  The aroma was chocolate with slight roasted malt.  The initial chocolate flavor was replaced by roasty aftertones towards the end.  The mouthfeel was smooth as velvet on the tongue and the flavor lasted forever.  Another excellent offering from the folks at Summit.","ryanocerus","Aug 20, 2002"
4.33,16.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I can't believe it. I just bought a 6-pack last night (August 5th) for $2.49. NEVER HAD A BETTER DEAL IN MY LIFE! This has kept very well. As I was watching the thunderstorms pass I enjoyed 2 bottles - and I must say REALLY enjoyed! I was surprised at how dark and beautifully it poured. A firm, but not long-lasting creamy caramel head. A complex, malty aroma that teased me with subtle wiffs of everything I was about to taste. Very smooth taste. A flavor of chocolate, a bit of coffee roast and spice notes made this very enjoyable. It had a smooth feel around my mouth and tickled with the roasted spice hints on the way down. Very drinkable -I will savor the last 4 bottles, and hope that last 6 pack I saw  at the store will still be there in a few days!","Wingman65","Aug 06, 2002"
4.23,13.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Very dark burgandy/mohagony hue.  Some very nice roasted notes in this brew.  A warming presence is also noticed.  Chocolate notes accent this malty brew.","Bighuge","Mar 26, 2002"
