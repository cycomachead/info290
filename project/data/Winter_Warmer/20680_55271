4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured into a Blanche de Namur small pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with little light transmission and a half finger dark khaki head with good retention and lacing.Aroma of sweet bready malt with hints of caramel, dark dried fruit, mainly raisins and dates, light hay; earthy winter spices. Flavor is caramel malt with some toastiness, dark dried fruit, cinnamon and clove, cocoa, light molasses. Finishes with earthy spices and light hop bitterness. Medium bodied with light creaminess. This is exactly what I hope for in a winter warmer; seasonal spicing in a rich malty body. The malt depth and woody, earthy components make it clear why this makes such a good base for the BA version. Very nice seasonal.","LiquidAmber","Dec 09, 2014"
3.5,-8.9,,,,,,"Gotta say- if you're expecting  a traditional ""winter warmer"" style beer before taking your first sip of this beer, you are in for a bit of a surprise. If this was sold year round as a porter I wouldn't be surprised at all. Deep dark appearance, tan head. Very malty but not in the same way a lot of winter ales are;Very roasted chocolate and nut taste, still has that hint of boozy aroma though. Has a roasted nutty finish, dark chocolate linger. This is a great beer, but a bit of a different direction than your typical winter warmer.","RenzoD","Dec 09, 2014"

Not much of a nose on this. Faint roasted grain. Maybe a hint of raisin. The taste is good. Not great. It's an easy drinking beer for sure. Very slight roasty flavor. Bit of sweetness. Again that hint of raisin. Really smooth and balanced. Hops are nowhere to be found. They are in there because it is really well balanced but nothing really shines flavor wise. I like this beer more than my review reflects. This is a good beer for a cold winter day. However I think when you slap ""winter warmer""on it, you expect certain flavors to be bolder. This cost $5 and change for a bomber at Full Throttle Bottles. Really good price for this beer.","sergeantstogie","Nov 10, 2012"

Ingredients (""Down & Dirty"") claim no additives, so the spice must be all in the hops. Otherwise I might have guessed cloves, based on the ""heat"" of the flavor. 8.0% ABV (based on this year's label) doesn't hurt, either. There's a malt backbone to thing thing as well, but flavor-wise, it's lost here. Mouthfeel is pretty good thanks to well-moderated carbonation, but drinkability suffers due to the one dimensional bitterness. Verdict: not my favorite.","hreb","Mar 19, 2012"
