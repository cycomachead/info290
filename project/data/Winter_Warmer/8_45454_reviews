"It says right on the bottle that it's a red ale, and it sure tastes like other red ales I've had, though perhaps less bitter. I was under the impression that winter warmers were generally more related to brown ales. I didn't really detect any additional spices. Oh well, either way it was delicious. Used a large, short-stemmed Belgian style flute (for lack of a better term). I perceived various shades of amber. A slight, but seductive haziness, although that may have been from how cold it was when served. Aromatically it seemed more akin to some black ales that I've had than to a pale or an IPA. A very sweet, perfumy hoppiness. Sweeter, but with a stronger flavor profile than many a pale, or even some IPAs. Again, reminiscent of certain of the black ale style. Rich, somewhat thick. Head was there to stay."

"Overall: Winter warmer, or black IPA? Either way, this is certainly flavorful. All of the aspects go together pretty well (although I wish I had gotten it a bit fresher). Considering how cheap Widmer is in stores, it is worth trying."
""
"Overall, this has got to be one of the driest beers I've ever had. Is this really supposed to be this way? Wish I could find a date on this somewhere on the bottle. Most likely not come back to this."

"Pretty good. Basically a quality NW pale ale with some spice plus a bit of extra maltiness and body. For how spiced it is, I'd say it is imbalanced toward the bitter side due to the generous hoppage.  But it would be perfect with a pizza and a fun crowd after a day's skiing."

"A good smooth beer - not too filling"
"Tastes great, but its other qualities bring it down a notch."

"These are a little hazy when served very cold but they brighten right up when they warm up. I let my current bottle sit out for 20 minutes or so and it pours brilliant ruby tinted dark amber under a 1” off-white foam cap with a slight tan tint. It leaves thick lace on the glass. The malt aromas recall fruit cake with caramel, light chocolate with a touch of sweetness leading to a bitter emphasis on the finish with some mild alcohol warming. Its creamy, medium full body and medium carbonation."
""
" Pours a pretty amber in color with a small off-white head. Ring-like lacing was seen when sipped. The aroma is full or caramel malts, spice and some citrus zest. More going on with the taste as there is a hint of pine also. Good taste with a slight bitter finish. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation for this style of brew. Overall it is a decent brew."
""
""
"Widmer crafted a nice beer here, but the aromas and flavors aren't overly exciting. Nothing too special, but not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice coppery red color as poured into the glass. Slight citrus hop aromas mix with the caramel malt to create a pleasing aroma. Pretty light in the mouth, with a good balance of hop and malt flavors to keep it very smooth. No spices in this one, but a great taste overall."

"The Brrr is a decent beer.  Starts slightly sweet then finishes bitter.  The beer poured a nice amber with white head that is leaving a spotty lace.  The beer is hoppier than expected and the bitterness at the end is no overly positive.  The mouthfeel is medium in body with decent carbonation.  Overall its solid and worth a try."
"Why can't I just give a numerical value?"

""
""
""

"Over all this is a pretty decent beer. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I'm glad I tried it and would definitely take it if it were offered to me."

"kinda creamy malt taste then big bitter lingering finish"

"Excellent head and nutty, malty, dark taste. Wonderful as an ""Nighttime Beer", but not bad during the day. ($34 from Brewers outlet 2/15, out of date). First tasted at a Brewers Outlet tasting in fall of .2014"

"O: very drinkable;"
""
""
""
"It was OK I wasn't looking for an IPA citrus and bitter tastes for the holidays, but still ok"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I was impressed not only for the taste but how well this beer hold up within a year possibly more. Well worth the dollar I paid for it at Beermuda clearing out their old stock."

"O: Very nice. I'd love to try it on cask."
""
""
""
""
""
"Basically a red IPA with some tweaks, nicely bitter with more significant body than I expected. Visually gorgeous, a bit thin on aroma. One of the better Widdy brews I've come across the past few years."
""
""
"Great beer overall, as would be expected from a brewery such as Widmer Bros. Prototypical flavors abound for the style, malts, vanilla, caramel, some winter spices, with undertones of hops (west coast) and booze carried throughout. Beautiful nose too."
""
"Overall: This is an interesting Winter Ale. Not what I was expecting, but good."

"O: Not bad. I'm not a fan of hoppy beers, but this was a nice departure from typically heavy and spice-loaded winter brews."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall/ This was a very good beer more to the hoppy than malty side. It was a nice beer to enjoy slowly by the fireplace."
""
"Appearance was a burnt copper color capped with a small white head. The head reduced to a thin ring with minimal lacing. This had a nice balance between the hops and malts. The finish was slightly dry and bitter. I did not pick up a lot of spices that are usually found in a winter warmer. It reminded me more of a red IPA. Nice beer on a winter night."

"O- The grapefruit hop notes on this beer are so incredibly fresh, pronounced, and pungent. Probably my favorite of the Oregon winter warmer/strong ales that I have had this year."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is a clear copper color. The head is slight and white, wispy, with soapy lace. The smell is a little hoppy, with a fresh scent and a background of caramel malt. The taste is like toffee and bread....caramel and malt and some mid-taste hop bitterness. Full in body. Warming, but not boozy. This is a respectably good winter brew."
""
""
"Worth a shot as a nice fairly robust ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O-Not like other Winter Ales that pack a strong all spice/ginger. A decent beer. Something different at the holidays"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Over all i enjoy this beer alot , and i would put it right up there with Sierra Nevada Celebration ale. Try it if you havent and like hops."
""
"O- Overall very enjoyable, done right by the holliday season. Many layers of taste from a slight peppermint to pine, off to ginger. I was surprised."
""
"D: Widmer Winter Warmer - Well done! I really like this beer and it gets better as it warms. Lots of long-lasting flavor. My fave winter warmer this year."
""
"Widmer Brothers, who not too long ago, disappointed me greatly by discontinuing the Drifter Pale Ale, impress me anew this evening with this experience."
""
""
""
"O: not what I was hoping for. This winter warmer is too hoppy for my taste. I was wishing for more malts under my tree. This Brrr is kinda Blahhh."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I've been drinking Great Lakes Christmas Ale this year and it's hard to compare this beer to that one, but this is pretty good. I like the balance here and there's some good flavors, and I like that it doesn't get too carried away with the spices or the alcohol. But again, the stickiness in the finish doesn't sit well with me. I'll call this a good buy for $7.99-$8.99/six pack, but it's not top notch."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is pretty solid and enjoyable. As noted, stronger hop presence than I anticipated, but it's done well, making it closer in taste to an Am. amber ale than a traditional English Winter Warmer, but it will do today."
""
""
""
"Very good beer here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-really tasty, easy drinking brew. Highly recommend"
""
"Aroma: slightly herby, faint cinnamon, resinous hops. Appearance: Deep amber with little foam. Taste: toasted bread, amber malts, malty syrup, subtle hops and herbs. Overall, not too bad. A nice sessionable ale. Its slightly sweet with syrupy overtones and a nice fresh hop flavor."
"Overall very easy to drink and better than expected."
"Overall, this is a well balanced winter warmer. There is a great balance of citrus hops and sweet, chocolate malts. This is definitely going on my favorites list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip, bottled on 9/25/13 3 months before the big day, nice thinking bro's. Pours a deep slightly hazy red, with a one inch off white head, with attractive lace. Smell is caramel, pine, tangerine, and toffee. Taste is that, with a slight grapefruit bitterness. Body is medium large, plenty of life, a little dry, and very drinkable. This is very nice. So far I have had a red ale and a brown ale this late fall that are going to be my holiday staples."
""
""
""
""
""
"I forget how spoiled I am to live in Portland, and how often I overlook Widmer beers as they're so readily available. I won't make the mistake again. Had Brrr a number of years in a row, but this years bottle tastes like a Wet Hop IPA with a hint of spiciness. Upon opening, it has a much hoppier aroma than year's past, but that's not a bad thing. A lil' bit of head led to some nice lacing on the frozen pint glass it was poured into. But the flavor was very rich--in my opinion--the way an IPA should taste and lean towards in the colder months--very wet hops balanced with a decent malt flavor and a few spices for good measure. Definitely didn't feel like a red ale this time around--much closer to an IPA, but a good one for the fall and winter months ahead!"

"This is a pleasant sessional seasonal; while not spectacular, it is a comfortable rendition and a nice to supplement the Widmer Family of fine craft beer."
""
""
""
" I was drinking some of this around the holidays, and thought I'd review it before it's gone for the season. When I originally sampled it, I thought it a bit hoppy for my taste- it seemed to obscure the malt flavors a bit much. I think I like it better now that it's had time to mellow. I could see storing some of this in the cellar for next Fall."
""
"This tastes like a strange IPA, and has no warmer character style to me at all. It's missing a big boost of malt depth."
"Probably the best thing I've tasted from Craft Brewers Alliance."

"Overall: Actually enjoyed this beer, but it did lack a few minor qualites of individuality. This beer was good, but reminded me of every other winter-warm type of beers like Sierra Nevada's Celebration. Wasn't exactly thrilled with the results. I did enjoy it however, but it would've been better if there was a hint of difference. I may try again, but most likely will stick to a more familiar beer with similar taste. Only reason this beer was given a reasonable score was due to the fact it fit well in the category. Cheers!."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This is a nice little beer that I rather enjoyed. Much hoppier than I was anticipating with some nice balance of malts and flavors overall. Nothing ground breaking but hits the spot in drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice brown with ruby hints when held to the light. A quarter inch of head, doesn't stick around for long. The beer is smooth and balanced between malt and alcohol, but doesn't have the corresponding hop aroma or flavor. A bit of bitterness from the hops, but mostly sweet malt and a bit of warming alcohol. A good example of the style, without being an exceptional one."
""
""
""
"Great winter brew. Pours a dark amber color with a slight foamy head, leaving a trace of lacing throughout. The smell is excellent -- hints of pine, citrus, hops. Full-bodied. The taste is bitter yet not astringent and pretty easy to drink considering the high ABV. Relatively easy to drink. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I found this beer very agreeable to drink, and a nice break from the more spicy, malty winter warmers of this time of year. It has more hop than you’d expect in a winter warmer but that was ok by me! It’s well balanced and I could easily drink more than one. This was my favorite out of a sampler of four different winter beers."
""
""
""
"O: This beer isn't your typical winter warmer because it packs in a lot of hops, but it has some nice notes of citrus. I could see this as beer that a hophead might want to try during the colder months. It's quite drinkable because the hops cut through the malts and no alcohol is detectable in the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"A fine take on the Winter Warmer style with a modern twist. I had expected a bit more body though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer IMHO should not be categorized as a winter warmer but as a strong cross between a Vienna Lager and American IPA. Not as bold but a touch smoother and I love it for that. Stop reading and drink up, Salud!"
"Overall – A rather hop heavy winter warmer. It is quite delicious and one to experience if you have a chance."
"This was a good beer overall, lots of nice balanced flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
"We're making New Year’s resolutions now and I think 2013 may be the year to finally get to Oregon to visit this brewery in person..."
""
""
"A very nice, hop-forward winter warmer with just enough caramel and chocolate malt notes to make it fit quite nicely in winter."
""
"O- Put this beer in a ""hybrid"" catagory and I'd rate it even higher, it's great on its own. As a warmer, it's a little outside the box, smart."
""
""
"Would I buy it again? No. It wasn't that bad, but I probably will not buy it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - A very nice winter seasonal... Hop forward but with lots of seasonal charm and complexity mixed it... Widmer Brothers is a brewery I often pass over for not particular reason, but offerings like Brrr have me making a mental note to try more... This is a seasonal offering that I'll gladly invest in each and every holiday season..."
"Overall - This is a lot closer to a winter seasonal IPA than it is a Winter Warmer. Think Sierra Nevada Celebration, and you've got a good idea about what this beer is, though I prefer the latter."
""
" Definitely a warming beer. Citrus and dankness dominate. There's a metallic taste that surfaces and is offputting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber with a cap of foam that leaves decent lacing. Smell is sourdough bread, quite malty. Taste is malt, bread, crackers initially with a pungent floral resin-spicy character then blooms mid palate, then a nice washing of hops reigns in the sweetness. Medium body, zingy carbonation. Finish is dry and slightly bitter. Enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is malts, alchohol is present. Taste is a good bit boozy, some malts, a hint of spice, more alcohol. feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall not bad, but a bit to boozy for me."
""
"Overall one of the few hop forward winter seasonals that is very nice and enjoyable, a beer I will purchase again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Barrel Aged Brrrbon, which is a better interpretation of a Winter Warmer (not to mention tastier)"
""
"Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Slight creaminess within. Coats the back of the throat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Excellent, excellent beer. Definitely better than Widmer's hef."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a solid beer worth drinking for a while."
"Not quite cold enough for me to make this noise, but it's getting close. This stuff pours a clear amber-copper topped by a half-finger of off-cream-white foam. The nose comprises apricot peel, light honeydew shell, sweet caramel, and a bit of pine resin. These elements don't really go together all that well, frankly, but the combination is interesting enough. The taste holds notes of pine resin, orange peel, light peach, dusty toffee, and a touch of toasted biscuit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Overall, this ain't a bad hoppy winter warmer right here. I think the hop combination could've been honed a little better, but this stuff really ain't too bad."
""
""
"OVERALL: This is a solid winter offering from Widmer Brothers. Mellow, agreeable flavors and a bit of warmth behind it. Certainly well within the style, and a good example of such."
""
"Overall: An excellent winter seasonal. While it eschews many of the typical winter warmer spices, like cinnamon and cloves, the intense hop bitterness and strong caramel malts give this beer a real heartiness that would definitely be warming on a cold, winter evening. A very pleasant surprise and something I highly recommend."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Brrr pours a clear brown color, with a nice small head. There is a floral aroma, with some spices, and hints of smokey malts. The taste has a slightly smokey taste, with a nice floral taste. Good full flavor, and yet easy to drink. Overall a very solid full beer, enjoyable and nice int he winter."
""
""
"I kind of liked this beer overall. Nice mixture of different flavors. Got the amber, pale ale and IPA feel."
""
""
""
""
"overall, i can handle this stuff nicely. the 7.2% is a surprise and the alcohol is well hidden. the pine-y-ness isnt over bearing and seems fitting for the season coming up. this one has enough depth and substance to allow more research..."
""
"Buttery mouthfeel, rich with toffee and toast flavor malts, rising bitterness to a crisp finish. Long lasting buttery and hoppy flavors linger. Bitterness is actually higher than expected for a winter warmer but I welcome. Overall nicely done with good simple flavors that cascade well over the tongue. Not a touch of detectable alcohol as well."
""
""
"the point of hurting the drinkability. A very nice surprise!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Not to bad. Its like an imperial amber ale."
"I love the other widely available Oregon produced winter warmer too (Deschutes Jubelale)....but at this price point - just wow."
"Definetely will buy this one again! Great beer!"

"Widmer Brothers Brrr Seasonal Ale is a very clear, sparkling copper ale topped with a dense, light beige foam that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a rich pine aroma with sweet caramel in the nose. It's pretty full bodied, very smooth and foamy. The finish is clean and nimble. It tastes pretty bitter and a little sweet. The balance is really nice. Pine resin is the loudest flavor. The bitterness turns to something more like juniper by the time the caramel sweetness emerges just after the swallow. This one kind of took me by surprise. It's a pretty serious beer and it's really easy to drink."
""
"Overall I think it would be better fresher but I can still enjoy its qualities. With a name like Brrr sounds like it needs some bourbon aging."
""
""
""
""
"O- Decent. Not bad at all."
"12oz bottle, picked this one up late in the season as part of a mix six. Pours brown with some orangey-red hues, thin beige head that sticks around as a foam atop the ale. Good lacing on the glass. Aromas are citric hops, brown sugar, caramel, and some spiciness, cinnamony perhaps, although I don't think any cinnamon was used in the brewing process...imagination? Tastes are very well balanced and complex with notes of spicy hops, brown sugar, grapefruit, orange rind, toasted grains, chocolate and a nice smack of bitter pine resin on the finish. Mouth-feel is on the fuller side of medium and nice and creamy while being slightly oily on the finish. Overall, a very nice surprise from Widmer Brothers! I really enjoyed this one; loads of complexity, bitter, but tons of malty at the same time. Worth getting again...maybe earlier in the season next year, although this would be nice and refreshing for a warmer day too. That being said, it is not what I'd expect from the winter warmer style it is in."
""
"It's a tasty beer, and I certainly don't regret the purchase. I'm not quite sure how it's a winter warmer, though."
""
""
""
"D: Rich & malty with nice firmly balancing hops. And this is a well melded beer – everything in interesting harmony. Not truly a warming sipper, but this one does make you think of sitting by the fire. A sort of American hop version of a Winter Warmer."
""
"certainly an underrated beer on BA. pours the most sensual of redbrowns, glorious inch and a half off white head. smells of bourbon, malty sweetness, and vanilla. flavor is delicate winter spice, english medium to dark malts, and plenty of residual sugars. the hops content is a surprise too, almost red ipa there for a minute. nice hop palate. shocker. feel is solid, thick in the body and hefty in the abv, exactly what a winter warmer should be, and this one does warm you up. sessionable to, all around great beer"
""
""
"This is a decent beer, but the flavor doesn't last. The dryness of the finish diminishes the flavor on the palate. The hops were nice. It was a nice change of pace from the standard winter warmers that all seem to offer ginger and spices. The mouthfeel was almost perfect, but ultimately it wasn't enough to save this one. Nice, but underwhelming. I would probably have it again, if offered."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(12 oz into pint glass) Poured a deep amber/red with a one finger head that had very little retention, but a strong lacing on the glass. The nose is heavy on the hops with a slight hint of citrus and spice. Given the brewer's description of ""not quite excessively hopped", I would hate to see a hoppy beer of theirs, since this was very bitter and hoppy for my tastes. Don't get me wrong, this was great, just not what I am used to in a winter seasonal. There was very little that was sweet, but rather a heavy hand on the hops with a hint of the warming spice and alcohol. Overall, this was an excellent beer, just a little out of the box for a winter warmer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Reminded me a bit like a long-lost, equally illegitimate second cousin to Stone's Arrogant Bastard."
"Overall, this beer is very good. I have had it in bottles in years past but was really impressed with the draft offering. Recommended."
"Taste is full and sweet with caramel flavors balanced with a nice level of hop spice. Finishes with a bit of dark fruit and brown sugar and lingers a bit like a sweet port wine. Pleasant feel and carbonation though perhaps a bit simple in the malt body leading to a singular approach through the palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I liked this. It didn’t necessarily feel like a Winter Warmer to me but more like a hoppy American Amber with some festive feeling spicing added to it. Or at least a REALLY hoppy take on the Winter Warmer style. At any rate, I’d still go back to this one. It’s a tasty winter seasonal."
"O - This beer definitely surprised me. Less spice than I expected, also didn't catch much of the malt that was advertised. Thought it was very drinkable, and is a nice change of pace."
"The malts provide a sturdy backbone in a medium body, light carbonation is supportive but not overdone, and there's a good transition from crisp in the front to smoother in the middle and into a pretty dry finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Actually was really impressed with this beer, really easy drinkability and refreshing."
"Dark red pour with a spicy hoppy aroma. Nice head on this pour. Very much like an IPA with its hops foundation, with some spice (don't ask me what spice, it's just spicy) thrown in. Not too bitter, but the amount of hops caught me off guard. I really enjoyed this one. A pleasant surprise."
"D- Pretty darn drinkable. I think the carbonation helps quite a bit there. I'm admittedly not a big winter warmer fan but this is quite good."
""
"o. similar to an ipa, but with an extra punch. a good dose of hop, but the spice is a nice touch to seperate it from many other brews. a fine addition the the widmer bros collection."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a murky brown with a 1 inch puffy light tan head that settles to a small cap. Thin rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of sweet malt and some herbal and citrus zest hops. Taste is of herbal and citrus zest hops up front that becomes sweet with malt flavors on the finish. There is a mild bitterness that sticks to the tongue after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a somewhat smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good Winter warmer that is quite hoppy for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I think this just may be a new winter favorite. I really appreciate the 7.2% ABV as I think winter warmers should be higher in alcohol. This is a wonderfully hoppy and warming beer for the winter months. Pick some up, you won't be let down."
""
""
""
""
""
"No spice flavors to speak of, and while the alcohol is on the high side, you'd never guess its weight from this superbly balanced brew. Winter warmer or not, this is great beer."
""
"All in all, a good beer. But at around a buck a bottle, a great value."
""
""
"The waves of different beer flavors all in one makes this plenty enjoyable. A little of everything for the winter time."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
""
"S - Rich hop scent, slightness of sugars"
"O - I enjoy the body on this beer and the tricky taste that makes me believe it will be hoppy but switches to a malty finish. Something I would purchase again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Of the winter seasonal beers I've been able to find (can't find Celebration for the life of me!), this one is fantastic. My first sampling of a Widmer Brothers beer, this was definitely a good place to start! It's a shame they changed the packaging, it is all rather boring now and just looks a bit too generic."
"Overall: I would rate this higher because its so cheap and its very different from the genre and it does a very good job. I wish this was bottled in bigger bottles than just 12oz. Having to pay for a whole six pack at stores outside of bottle shops is annoying and when you shop for beers after they close, this is passed up unfortunately. But I am giving it a 4 because its really good. Hope Widmer bottles this next year in bigger bottles."
""
"12 oz bottle poured into Sam Adams glass. Decent head and lacing, pours a deep amber. Wow, aroma is knock your socks off pine and citrus hops with some cotton candy. Taste is a bitter hoppy profile - no question I would define this as an IPA in a blind taste test. I little oversweet on the malt profile, but maybe that's what is supposed to qualify this as a winter warmer. Nice bitter dry finish. The bold hop profile was unexpected for a winter warmer (although I'm not sure how the style is really defined). Not bad."
""
""
"D: highly drinkable brew. a bit strong to hammer back the whole six, but otherwise highly quaffable."
""
"This is a tasty winter seasonal. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall this is a solid winter warmer that is one of the things I love about beer this time of year."
"Pours a dark amber color into a pint glass. It has a rich maltiness to it. Its flavors are warm but mild, not too distinctive in any particular notes. I get a lot of hop and citrus notes for some reason when I smell and get some of those flavors towards the end of my sip. Its medium fullness but not too heavy, a soapy texture lingers on my palet a little. Overall, its a nice beer to drink in the fall or being of winter. Fairly easy to drink, not overly robust with flavors to make you ponder. Its a straight forward ale and I think I like it!"
"Never quite comes together - this is not how I like my winter warmers."
"O: A good winter warmer. Has the spiciness without being over bearing at all."
""
"From the bottle stamped 08:22NH-OCT 13 11. Sampled on December 1, 2011. It pours a kind of dark amber-olive note with hues of red and a short-lived head. On the nose the aroma favors the hops with a pleasantly mellow caramel malt and sugar sweetness. The body is better than medium. Up front there is a sweet, candied malt character in the taste but it does not last long because a definite hop bitterness creeps up quickly and leaves its mark. Nicely done."
""
"Really tasty, heavily hopped winter warmer. Give it a try."
""
""
"O: a pretty good brew, not as much depth as i had hope but it is overall a good drinking brew, would get it again"
"This has turned out to be a favorite of mine, along with Hibernation and Isolation from Colo. Well balanced and high on drinkability. Brewed date on bottle is Sep 28, 2011."

"O - This one is great!! I think what make this beer so good is the fine line of not over-doing 'it' in any particular area (hops, fruity-flavor, pine/spice, carbonation, and last but not least, alcohol level). VERY refreshing and will get again and...…Goin’ to look for a tap ASAP!!!"

"I am really enjoying the seasonals from Widmer this year and this one ranks among the best of the PNW winter warmers. Complex with lots of malts and hops which blend together in a sort of fruitcakey take on an IPA. I found I could drink it like a regular ale or sip like it like anold ale. Nuanced yet extremely drinkable"
"The beer pours a nice dark brown color with red hues and a frothy tan head. The aroma is hoppy with lemon and pine, lots of citrus with a toffee sweet caramel base with a hint of chocolate. It tastes of citrus hops mainly grapefruit with a base of caramel and toasted malt, very candy-like. This is a heavy beer and it's very smooth, moderate to low carbonation and a dry finish. This is great winter seasonal, seems like it's stuck between a winter warmer and an IPA."
""
""
"O: Right up my alley, this beer seems like a toned-down version of Double Bastard. The American hops and higher malt profile work together well for this Winter Warmer."
""
""

"Taste is pretty mild, but caramel and spices dominate, malty aftertaste. Easy and decent seasonal drink. Definitely the best choice at the pub I was at."
"The flavor seems malty at first, but with a clean hops finish that places this more in line with a pale ale. Delicious and worthy!"
"O - Have yet to have a bad brew from these guys, this is no exception. An excellent winter warmer, lots of body and good depth of flavors, hops and spices are very nice."
"Brrr falls squarely into the category of winter warmer I like best - American hop-forward with a solid malt body of the red variety, most importantly no spices are present to taint it. Hops jump out first with candied orange peel and freshly cut pine followed by the shortbread and toffee malt side. Digging deeper, subtle roast comes out along with an herbal hop component. Finish is a tad sweeter than I would normally like my hoppy beers, but it fits in with the winter warmer theme and the sheer amount of hop flavor seems to balance it out. A first rate NW red ale."
"O - Overall, another solid candidate in the winter warmer category, this one leans slightly more towards the hops than some of the others out there, making it a good choice for those who find some winter warmers too malty for their taste."
"A really solid beer and very enjoyable."
"D- surprising offering from widmer and hoppier than expected. Falls somewhere in between a dark ipa and American red. Winter warmer is a pretty broad category so I'm sure this fits in there somewhere."
"In my opinion, this is a good seasonal beer, a beer that I wouldn't choose to drink over other choices out of season..but this is a good beer to celebrate Autumn with."
"The beer pours a reddish-amber color with a white head. The aroma is caramel and biscuit malt with a little bit of piney hops mixed in. A very nice aroma overall. The flavor is heavier on the hops than I expected. I get a lot of pine as well as some caramel malt. Low bitterness and very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A nice take on a winter warmer."
"O: Decent beer, far from my favorite winter."
"Very drinkable for a 7%+ beer."
"A fairly solid brew that twists in a darker style of English IPA with a Winter Warmer attitude."
"D: I was surprised by this. Usually I don't have very high expectations of Widmer beers, but this was pretty solid."
"MF: No big body or warming expected of a winter warmer, but it is an easily sessionable ale with good introductory hop character"
"D- this was a nice WW had a crisp hop bite with spice and malt one of the better tasting ones this winter"
"D: Pretty drinkable, nice take on the winter warmer style with a lot of hop flavors."
"D: This is my favorite winter beer, and my favorite Widmer beer...I always look forward to this beer coming out every winter."
"I was surprised to experience a winter warmer that tastes more like a traditional American IPA. For an IPA, it was very traditional, very citrus and piny and hop-forward, just didn't expect this from a winter beer. Very good, i wish this was available all year round."
"My favorite winter seasonal of all... Pours a dark amber with a little bit of white foamy head. Smells of citrusy hops and sweet malt. The taste is a perfect balance of malt and citrus hops... With more hop flavor than malt which is the way I like it... Finishes amazingly smooth with no harsh aftertaste."
"D- Best widmer product I've had to date. A solid winter brew."
"Surprisingly drinkable for a Widmer, a brand I am normally not fond of. Even though this is classified as a winter warmer, I consider it more of an IPA and would buy it over many IPAs."
"Overall, this is a decent beer. Great mouthfeel and smell. The taste it too bitter for a winter warmer in my opinion. When I think of the ideal winter warmer, I want crack open something nice with a complex and spicy taste, full bodied, and goes down smooth. I would say this has all of that, except for the ""goes down smooth part"". It is too bitter for my regular taste. Not a bad beer, probably great to some, just not my cup of tea as far as winter warmers are concerned."
"I consider this to be a hoppy beer with a great malt base. I really liked this beer a lot. I finished it faster than I drink most of my beers. Great job Kurt & Rob!"
"D - For a Winter Warmer it's very drinkable. Tastes more like an IPA than a Winter Warmer. I actually drank this a few nights ago and i'm just reviewing my notes now. On my notes I thought it was a seasonal IPA, that's why I tried it. My bartender did not tell me this was a Winter Warmer. If I had known that I wouldn't have tried this at the tail end of my session. Thankfully it's only 7.2% and not 9%-12% like some warmers tend to be. Overall a pretty decent experience. Give it a shot if you get a chance."
"Kind of strange, this one. Seems like more of a pale ale or IPA than a winter warmer. Not much in the way of maltiness or spices that I can discern. Tastes ok for a IPA though."
"Different than your traditional winter warmer. I'd recommend it if you're looking to try something new."
"Drink- Another one of those times I wish a bought a six pack and not a single."
"D: For me this is one of the best winter ales out there, so it is incredibly drinkable. Such a great balance of hops and malt!"
"Drinkability - Relatively quaffable for the ABV. An interesting Winter Warmer somewhat reminiscent of SN Celebration Ale. Glad I bought the six pack but will pick up a SN Celebration Ale over this in the future."
"Otherwise a very drinkable and tasty beer, just not a taste that has me thinking about curling up next to a fire on a snowy winters night."
"Drinkability: The brew has an overall great appeal with its abundance of nicely combined flavors. The slightly high ABV may make it difficult the polish off a sixer, however many will try and few will win."
"Good drinkability. Not the best beer out there but a good one."
"D-a pretty tasty winter seasonal. not for the hop shy. Enjoyed it"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Medium bodied. Creamy and smooth, with very little carbonation. This is definitely not a beer that you can pound down fast. Some pretty strong flavors in this one. Overall, pretty nicely done by Widmer."
"A good winter beer for the hop lover. Surprising from a company best known for a mediocre wit."
"I really liked this beer and wasn't expecting that from Widmer. Had a nice Carmel taste and a nice little sweet taste as well but definitely not too sweet. Had a nice little hop taste to it and was really easy to drink. I am not a professional reviewer although I have been drinking good beers for at least 10 years now so I know a little. I know a good beer when I taste it and this one passes the test."
"Tasty and powerful, I can find no other word that fits as well as ""appreciate"". I appreciate this brew as it dances across my pallet, as it dulls my emotional senses, tops off my dinner. This particular brew: 1) tastes great 2) costs less than $1.50/bottle and 3) is truly amber, placing it above 90% of the winter brews I've experienced."
"Drinkability - Not terribly complex, but a good-tasting brew. Maybe a little too bitter for me to get a six-pack of, but good for bottle or two."
"The body was very light for the stated style. Drinkability was very good, although not for the style. Overall, I liked this beer, but thought it was a decent IPA, not what it claims to be. Worth trying, and I'm gonna bust open my 22 of Brrbon in a few minutes."
"Good beer fro the price sixer for 9 bones."
"I could have plenty of these and it is one my favorite seasonal beers!"
"This is honestly more of a red, or imperial red to me, very superb overall."
"Pours a transparent red/brown color with an off white or light tan head. Smells roasty with some citrus. Tastes of caramel malt and has a little bit of hops and spice. Mouthfeel is medium, it has very light carbonation. Although I am not a big fan of this style, I am trying to learn to like it more. If you enjoy a good winter warmer, you should definitely give this a try."
"Overall slight better than the average winter beer. The flavor is good but it's not that impressive. Overall a nice beer though."
"Widmer Brothers Brewing Company, Ltd.--Brrr Seasonal Ale--Warm Up With A Cold One--To: You; From: Rob / Kurt W--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 7.20% ABV. 50 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Winter Ale--IPA. Thin mild lace off white head. Thin clear bright rich red gold color. Crisp floral toasted Cascade hop front. Tangy spicy cinnamon malt clove caramel dry toasted body. Hot malt Winter spice bitter Alchemy hop end. No spice added--cinnamon nutmeg Malt. Sampled 10/7/2010. 12-Pack purchased @ The Ballard Market for $ 12.99 on 9/30/2010."
"A lovely holiday beer, very well balanced and straight, aimed at the style. The Christmas Goose may have met its match."
"A deep, but clear, dark reddish brown, with a nice off-white foamy head. Good citrusy hop aroma, along with sweet chewy caramels. Flavors of milk chocolate, caramel and brown sugar. This one goes down pretty easily for the 7+% abv. Not a bad Christmas gift from the Widmer Brothers."
"Drinkability: This has to be one of the most piney beers I have encountered; not bad, but a bit too much in that direction for my palate"
"Normally I do not drink alot of widmer brothers beer, but i am in love with all kinds of winter ales so i had to stop and pick up a pack of brr. The moment i took my first drink there was a flavor explosion in my mouth, and it didnt fade like most beers but it hung around inside my mouth giving me a constant taste of a good darker beer. I would recommend this beer to anyone. One of my favorite store bought beers"
"Big mistake. This beer is repulsive to the taste. It looks good, smells good, and is strong at over 7% alcohol, but my god, it tastes horrible. I've never had it with a meal, a lemon or lime, but it disappoints every time and I will never try it again....unless I'm already drunk."
"Brrr assaults the taste buds with puckering grapefruit and lemon notes. To me, Brrr smacks of an IPA more than a red ale, and I don't pick up any of the malt balance other reviews mention. The beer has the mouthfeel of a 7% beer, with a nice alcohol zip on the tongue, and body is appropriate for the style. While Brrr is tasty and not too hard to drink, I'd welcome a little more complexity of flavor."
"D: A decent beer that hides the alcohol rather well."
"The mouthfeel is good. The beer is definitely warming. I have to say that I was shocked when I saw that this beer had a 7.2% ABV. The good thing about winter warmers is that the spiciness hides the alcohol. The bad thing about winter warmers is that they can be so damn spicy. When they get it right they can be great and the Widmer Brrr is pretty damn good."
"It seems a year in the cellar has done this beer pretty well. A nice, slight oxidized maltiness comes through and really helps smooth the beer out. I did not like this one very much when fresh, but it tastes pretty good now. Fairly basic, but decent winter seasonal."
"Overall, this is more like an extra APA, I haven't had Torpedo in a while, but this is eerily similar to me! Great beer, but a winter warmer? Just as much a winter warmer as SN Celebration is I suppose [although they dont claim it as such]"
"The beer drinks surprisingly smooth for a winter offering, yet there is no sacrifice to flavor. Your gut will think you've had a light beer, while you're mouth will think you just had a thick amber."
"D - Again, surprisingly good and exceeded my expectations. Would actually buy a sixer of this (had received just one 12 oz bottle as part of a gift set)."
"1/3 finger white head over reddish clear copper amber body. Nose features bready malts and a big spicy hop hit. Taste is a pretty big hop presence for WW, more spicy than citrusy , but no noticeable spices, Pretty well balanced, especially on the back end when sweetish malts come through. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, average carbonation, a bit sticky from the malts, not too heavy. Damn drinkable.One of the better Widmer brews pretty drinkable and quite tasty. Worth checking out."
"The mouthfeel is mildly creamy with mild-medium carbonation."
"Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - Enjoyed this more than the Pyramid Winter Warmer; higher ABV makes it a dangerous holiday beer"
"O: Pretty good beer. Nice texture. First winter beer in the fridge."
"D: Drinks quite easily, never feels too heavy. A little higher-than-sessionable ABV, but no problem to go through 1 or 2."
"Mouthfeel: medium body, gentle carbonation, warming"
"Drinkability - Very smooth for a relatively higher ABV American amber beer (it doesn't really fit in the traditional ""winter warmer"" style category), but I'll probably stick with the Widmer Drifter APA or Broken Halo IPA first."
"D - Very drinkable, but with the 7.2% ABV, you probably don't want to drink too many."
"Thanks Gary!"
"Drinkability- Amazingly smooth and delicious for a beer that is over 7% alcohol."
"This is the best Widmer beer I've had in quite a while. I could happily drink this again. Were it on at my local on a night when I was hanging out for a while, I'd happily session it, though the abv is a little high for that."
"All 4's"
"Tastes like a nice pale ale, not like what a winter warmer should be like in my opinion, but still a great beer."
"Good Brrr. Def one of my favs."
"This is one of Widmer Brothers' better brews. Like this better than their year round IPA. Great value at $5.99 a sixer on sale."
"I am absolutly dissatisfied with the changes. Although it is still not a terrible beer, it is not even the same beer, it is nothing like it was before and I cant understand how they even thought it would be ok to brew it under the same name if it is not the same beer. I looked forward to this thing all summer and now its finally here, what a let down. I ordered one more just to make sure it was the right one or maybe a bad pour. I even bought a 6 pack on my way home to make sure. But nope, its been changed."
"Poured a medium and hazy amber color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of floral hops, pine, and some caramel. Tastes of the same; floral hops, pine, and caramel. This was definitely on the hoppier side (which is fine for me!)."
"If I had known how delicious Brrr is, I would have purchased more than this single bottle and would have cracked the cap long before today. Another plus is that it looks like each year's release will last until the following year's release. Here's hoping the brewery keeps this one around for many a winter to come."
"Orange/amber body lays beneath a this white head. The nose is caramel malts and citrus hops. Caramel malt, citrus fruit, grapefruit, and a spicy hop finish. The body is medium, pretty standard. A surprisingly tasty seasonal from Widmer. Nice and hoppy."
"[The name of this beer should be kind of funny to fans of old Helloween who really know their trivia--I know you're out there! Otherwise, it's just a cool name--no pun intended.]"
"D: Overall, not a bad beer. The high ABV can get to you, but this is after all a holiday beer. It's too heavy or overwhelming. A nice offering from Widmer."
"Beer pours an amber brown with a thin head that is leaving lacing behind. Nose was intense hops initially with malts now dominating. Taste is caramel malts that balance nicely with piney and grapefruit hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite smooth. Overall drinkability is very good as the abv is very well masked. My bro and I first sampled this tail-gaiting at a December Cardinals game and we were both surprised at how good it was. This will definitely be worked into the winter seasonal rotation. Recomended to fans of hoppy red ales."
"Drinkability is good. This one turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Not sure if this is really a winter warmer. This strikes me as being more like a hoppy amber ale, or an IPA. Whatever it is doesn't really matter much to me... I think it's just a nice tasty offering from Widmer."
"this beer would make a nice accessory on a frigid night, however its not geared for copious consumption... i'm fine with just one, no complaints."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden copper color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing. The nose is hoppy, with some malts, slight citrus. The taste is hoppy, malty, slightly sweet, with some citrus notes. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, thanks Brian."
"D= average. The flavor cools down quite a bit as this one warms. But a decent beer I suppose."
"This beer pours a murky swamp water brown. The head is half and inch in height, and recedes into decent lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit, pine resin, with hints of caramel underneath. The taste is of like the aroma, hoppy yet balanced. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this beer is a lot hoppier that I expected, but it is good nonetheless. I could drink this again."
"Decent, but I don't really dig the spices very much. Not my favorite Widmer brew."
"D - This beer met my expectations."
"Tried in shaker pint. Huge beige head, lasts almost entire beer. Clear ruby brown color. Lots of hops, cherries and cloves in the aroma. Starts a bit astringent, nutty. Hints of clove and nutmeg. Finish is quite hoppy, dry and bitter. Aftertaste is warm and bittersweet. Medium body. Alcohol moderate."
"Widmer now has two beers that I like. Grab this one and Big Eddy if you can find it."
"Definitely something I could and will drink many of."
"This is a very good amber beer with a solid hop profile that keeps things pretty interesting. Tasty."
"Final Note: this is listed as a winter warmer, but I based my review on how it tasted and I never tasted a winter warmer quite like this!"
"""Brrr!"" starts off sweet, boozy, and spicy with a resin hop presence that hints at citrus notes. The bitter hop assertiveness picks up mid-sip and rides out for a lengthy finish, but eventually fades as a metallic off-flavor sets in during the aftertaste. Body is a bit on the thin/watery side for a 7.2% winter warmer, and the carbonation is almost flat, but otherwise the mouthfeel is good. Easily a Winter Warmer that I'd purchase again, and even though it drinks more like an IPA, Widmer Brother's has a seasonal to be proud of with this entry."
"Drinkability- Greatly impressed by this Widmer effort. I'm usually turned of by the flagship line, but their seasonal line usually does good for me. Like a combo of Celebration and OSA, well melded."
"Medium body and very smooth. This beer is exceptionally drinkable. I wish it would be around another couple of months, because this sixer will go quickly and I fear there may be no more ""Brrr"" when I return to Surdyk's for my next run. Overall a great value and a great tasting beer."
"A very good beer but one that doesn't seem to fit the style. I expect a beer in this category to have warming spice and dark malts. While this isn't sub par by any means, it doesn't seem to fit ""winter warmer"" as well as it does IPA."
"The finish is not very exciting but not bad, the drinkability (sum of the parts) is a little higher than the various components would suggest on their own. It is keeping me warm during the cold so at least it has that thing going for it."
"This is a really nice winter beer. The appearance is a nice clear amber color. The spices are pleasing to the nose. The beer is really well balanced between hops, spices, and malt flavors. You can definitely taste each one, but none of them are overpowering. They rather compliment each other. Definitely a complex beer to be savored rather than chugged."
"Very good winter ale, exactly what I wanted... Hoppy and barleyey and not too expensive either."
"Overall: I like this beer very much, it is easy to drink and has a nice backbone to balance out the hops. There a nice earthiness to the beer that brings down to earth (no pun intended). The mouth feel is astringent and warming. The finish is bitter and it linger for a few moments on the palate. It is a nice winter warmer."
"12 oz bottle in a pint glass.. Transparent copper, with a quickly dissipating white head, that remains in a wispy ghost surrounding the edges of the glass... Aroma is of pine, lemon, tropical fruits, which is bordering on catty (simcoe? summit hops?)... Flavor is sweet and hoppy, a kind of citric twang (in a good way), and a mild malt presence trying to catch up with the barrage of citrus, lemon fruitiness.. Finish is warmingly bitter, and coats the tongue with ripe hops.. Overall, a nice beer, but for me, it's perhaps a bit too catty on the nose and in the flavor, but I think I may be quite sensitive in that realm.."
"Tasty."
"Cheers and Hoppy Holidays!"
"On a side note. This could be the dumbest name I've seen on a beer."
"D: Felt more like a strong APA than a Winter Warmer to me, but then this is a very broad beer style. Certainly enjoyable enough."
"A very nice beer, medium bodied, sweet but hoppy winter warmer. Very drinkable, i could drink 6 of these easily (which i did). My favorite from Widmer."
"Drinkability is ok, not a bad beer but it really doesn't work for me. I'd like more sweetness from the malts, and more, or a different, hop flavor. Also not loving the plastic phenolics, but they ABV is well hidden."
"D: Good balance. Very tasty with good hop character."
"D - This is one of the best winter warmers I've ever had. It certainly is one of the hoppiest."
"It somewhat works, and is technically well done. It's just what they've achieved here is just not quite my cup of tea, OK?"
"For some reason I decided to try this, good choice. Nice orange color, looks like SN Celebration. Smells and tastes piney, caramel, a hoppy beer but might as well be an IPA. I like the idea of hoppy reds/ipa's during the winter, warming tasty with a bit of the caramel spice. Go buy Brrr, OB Gordon, Celebration, decorate your tree!"
"I'd call this an amber ale...and a good one....damn glad I bought this..."
"this is listed as a winter warmer, but obviously should be reviewed along the lines of an IPA or highly hopped red ale. i was really impressed with this and would recommend it highly."
"I'm not sure if I would get this again as I would probably get a Celebration instead."
"This is much better than Snowplow-- I'm a big fan of hops!"
"Pours a clear reddish amber with one inch of white head that had decent retention. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass surface. Strong aroma of hops. Citrus and pine dominate in the nose. The flavor is more balanced as the malt adds a little sweetness to the bitter hops. Still finishes bitter though. The body is quite nice with a semi creamy texture but it feels a little thin for something trying to carry the ABV and the hops. If you like hopped up red ales, like I do, then this beer will be appealing. Knocked the drinkability down a little because of the high ABV."
"Glad to see other reviewers ""get"" this beer! Because I've heard comments from people about how it's too hoppy, too thin, too something to be a good winter seasonal. Plus I guess people miss Snowplow, Widmer's terrific previous winter seasonal (and apparently Widmer realized that and brought it back out in addition to Brrr). Well, Brrr is a great beer, whether or not it is appropriate as a winter seasonal. And it does taste good in the winter. Makes a great Christmas gift. And yes, I wouldn't mind if they'd keep making it year-round. So...if you're looking for a barleywine or a spiced beer, this isn't it. But if you want to try a well-hopped, well-balanced, big (but not huge) red ale, give it a try."
"Didn't know what to expect. After being grossed out by punkin beer, cinnamon beer, coriander beer, and what have you, I was afraid I'd find another precious seasonal. So I held my breath, and started knocking this down. Oo-wee, man, it reminds me of the spruce gum the relatives used to send us from Nova Scotia. The label says it winds up with a candy aftertaste, but the spruce gum drove that right away. Then, after I recovered from what happened, I said. Man, what happened, I gotta down another swig and figure this out. It's like DMT for the timid. Go get this stuff if you are ready for repeated trips to the far borders of beer taste but want to come back for a rest."
"Cheers"
"Drinkability - Would definitely have another and can look to trying this again next year. A shame this is only a seasonal."
"Can see Widmer making this a year round beer with the great response this beer gets at the pubs and the stores."
"D- Very drinkable beer. Not too bitter and not overly carbonated. Can have several in one night."
"Nice overall, a bit cloudy. Head is ok, has a nice lace however. Very hoppy smell, strong floral scent. Somewhat bitter in taste, not too bad though...Mouthfeel enhances the presence of hopps and bitterness which is definatly an acquired taste. I'd definatly drink this beer again..."
"This was...interesting. Orange copper color in my pint glass, the beer was leaving good initial lacing on the glass as I drank it. The aroma was quite good, hops, dry malt, bready, a bit of orange. As for the taste....it had potential here. It certainly was strong tasting, but lacked depth. Strong piney hops with some caramel to balance here...so far so good...but within a quarter of the way it was all bitter hops and no malt to be tasted. I can enjoy a strong hoppy beer, even unbalanced ones, but this one needs to be tweeked to be enjoyable."
"I also love the fact that Widmer stamps a bottled on date on the bottle as well as the label."
"The taste is much richer and more complex, it's very hoppy in flavour with citrus - grapefruit and orange zest, but caramelly-sweet fruit, toasted grain, with a dry leafy hint in the finish. It is actually rather sweet with some spicey warmth and a litght bitterness that is more prominent in the aftertaste. It's full-bodied, smooth, slightly oily yet zesty, and very drinkable."
"Drinkability is good."
"Pours a nice red-amber color with good head retention. The aroma gives off hints of citrus and pine. Flavor is spicy, with a hoppy finish. Almost no malt flavors in my opinion. Not exaclt a winter ale in my opinion, but closer to an APA. A little bitter for my tastes, but very drinkable. Not bad."
"The aroma was candy sweet and full of malty goodness. A little bit of hopiness in the back end of the nose. The taste was really spicy just about all the way through. There was some sweetness at the finish. This was a pleasant surprise from Widmer. Besides the Hefe I have thought most of their offering although stoic have been middle of the road. This was definitely solid and worth the price of admission."
"This is a nice surprise from Widmer."
"D: this one should be a regular and not seasonal, hop character is nice and overall a tasty brew"
"This doesn't have what I look for, usually in a winter warmer, but it does have plenty of the things I like in a beer. Good job, Widmer."
"Very drinkable winter warmer-I can't believe I have passed by this in the past."
"Very drinkable."
"Mighta given it a better rating, but it's a tad non-traditional. Nevertheless, a fine product indeed. Nice hoppy nose, not so much malt. More similar to a pale ale in style. Hazy amber color highlighted with orange and red. Flavor is great. Grapefruit is strong but not persistant. Some earthy characteristics.. A session beer for sure."
"Perhaps a bit too much IPA, and a bit light on the winter warming. They are onto a good thing here, and amybe just a slight tweak or two would lean this one a tad more to the spicy malt side to make it a hell of a good seasonal winter warmer."
"Drinkability - Due to the inconsistency, this one gets some points knocked off. If its the former of the bottles... this is one of my favorite winter beers and is an easy purchase. Unfortunately I've run into this with 2 separate 6-packs, so I likely will not be buying it again, which is a shame."
"I've enjoyed this both in the bottle and on tap, but tap wins."
"Not the most drinkable winter ale. I can't see myself buying this again. If (as rumored) it is really the replacement for Snowplow Milk Stout, it is a poor replacement."
"I can't really tell any difference between this and Widmer's Broken Halo (which I generally like). More malt would go a long way to differentiating the too, if they're willing to tweak the recipe."
"D: A nice one from Widmer, don't go in expecting a spicy, malty Christmas beer, you won't get it; this is more along the lines of the Sierra Nevada Celebration type of this style."
"D: I really enjoyed the beer, but my palate was pretty wrecked after a couple of them. Did I mention it's hoppy! Tasty, but kinda one-dimensional for a winter warmer."
"taste is of caramel, some malts, slightly metallic, touch of spice, some pine, and ends a little on the bitter side."
"Overall impression: This appears to be a direct response to Celebration as a seasonal. That being said, its great to see some variety in the winter beer market, and this is a nice offering."
"D - Not to bad but not really a winter seasonal IMHO"
"Not the idea i had of the winter warmer, but still a pretty well balanced IPA"
"Taste & mouthfeel: Yep, an IPA it is. A pretty damn decent one too. Resiny, floral hops up front with a pleasantly dry and biscuity malt backbone. There's a bit of citrusy orange flavor in there too, leading into a finish that's got just the right amount of bitterness. Winter Warmer? Nah, this is just an American IPA. I'm pleasantly surprised though."
"Edit : Nov. 7, 2014. Bottled on date: Sept. 10 2014. One I buy every year along with Sierra Nevada Celebration.  Kind of a hoppy red ale. Very nice winter warmer. The 7.2% abv is well hidden so watch out."
"A Prost: To Widmer Brrr!"
"D-A highly drinkable beer. This one is very flavorful and was my pleasure to drink it down."
"A fine offering from Pyramid, a brewery I honestly don't seek out or drink alot of. Nice work. I'll be buying another sixer of this before the hops go away."
"Overall, this tastes a lot like an IPA, but with spices added. Very great beer from Widmer and I'd recommend it to anybody for the price."
"Poured this darker amber colored beer into a pint glass. The foam was just about two fingers and reduced to a steady covering over the beer. The smell of pine and citrus greet your nose. While the first taste is a hoppy, caramel flavoring with hints of citrus and pines. However the aftertaste of a toffee comes forth."
"Nice appearence to this brew. Slight redddish tint, a lot lighter than the ""English Winter Warmers"" with tight robust head on top. nose is sweet, with some spices coming through. Lots of grapefruit coming through up front with a smooth finish. I like the mouthfeel and drinkability of this product, as it made me want to have another."
"First of all, this is not a winter warmer. Its a hopped up amber ale. Smells great! Pine and citrus with a nice sweet caramel aroma in the back. Flavour is at first hoppy with nice PNW hops showcased. The hops give way to a sweet caramel and toffee flavour that rides on mild biscuit malts. The finish is smoothly bitter with a touch of toffee. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. I really enjoyed this beer, and hope the Widmers send more of their beers my way."
"D: It was a warming and well balanced brew that makes a fine session beer."
"Not my favorite of the style, but not bad at all. Something to try once, and if there is nothing else good to be had."
"A worthwhile purchase & worth trying again in future years to come."
"Citrus hop aroma with an odd spicy aroma that I couldn't really place. Kind of like spruce but not really. Some toasted malt flavor, much like a brown ale. Surprisngly well hopped for Widmer. Long lasting bitterness on the palate. I wouldn't get a second one."
"Drinkability not that high for me. For some reason, I lean toward a malty beer as a winter warmer. This tries too hard to be an IPA, and doesn't pull it off. On to try more winter warmers this season..."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. But there are many better winter warmers out there to choose this over them."
"An interesting beer, but I just wasn't loving it today. Probably won't get this one again."
"Pours a crystal clear copper orange color with a small amount of bone white foam leaving behind some lacing. Kind of light colored for a winter warmer perhaps? Strangely, I'm picking up a odor of pine scented air freshner, maybe from copious amounts of hops? Interesting. Also some nice bready aromas. Very nice hop flavor on this one! I was fairly surprised. Nice hop bitterness backed up by some toasty, bready malts, some spiciness. Slightly sweet, dry on the finish. Fairly creamy mouthfeel with a carbonation bite at the end. although this comes in at 7.2% ABV, it's quite drinkable and has a certain IPA quality to it/ Very nice and pleasantly surprised, although it's not what I usually expect out of a Winter Warmer. Easily the best Widmer brew I've had to date."
"PS: I can't stand the NAME of this beer...yeah, that's finicky of me, but it gives me shivers [pun intended]...really..."
" Body is actually a little thin for a winter warmer of this strength, but doesn't seem out of place given the flavors. While not the most exciting offering this holiday season, this is a decent warmer that is more than adequate for an evening by the fireplace."
"Appearance has a light brown amber with a thin head, but good lace. Smell of bold hops, pine and citrus. Taste has a good upfront piney hoppiness, grapefruit, spice and malt. Mouthfeel is smooth and slick going down with just the right amount of carbonation. though the ABV is not evident in taste, it is a bold drinker, one that the palate warms up to."
"Wow Widmer, you guys really surprised me with this one!"
"d. Wow. A nice drink that hides its high abv incredibly well. I started out this review horribly biased since Brrr replaced my winter standby Snowplow. that being said, I'm impressed. It's not really a Winter Warmer...which irks me a bit, because it's a pretty solid red and I would have enjoyed it in the late summer myself. Seems like an improvement over the W'06 (which this is supposedly based off of). It's definitely worth a shot, and I know I'll be drinking a few more packs before the winter's over... even though I still kind of wish it was a bit more winter warmer-ish."
"Drinks very easy despite the ABV & hoppyness; Widmer, you are on to a winner here. Keep this one in the line-up!"
"Drinkability: tasty, and different. I would get it again. I can't help beig a hop head."
"Strong carbonation provides some body, but the mouth feel is just bit thin, if anything. Otherwise, very drinkable and not the least bit boozy from the relatively high ABV. My samples were enjoyable and somewhat reminiscent of another cold weather favorite of mine - Schlafly Christmas Ale - particularly in the aggressive hop profile. Kudos to Kurt and Rob Widmer on what should be a welcome addition to the craft winter seasonals lineup for winter '08"
"This is a wonderful hoppy red ale from Widmer. Probably the best beer I've had from them. Nice caramel sweetness with hints of toasted malt. The hop flavor and aroma really make this beer special. If you're a hop head, give this one a try. Nicely done Widmer bros."
"Nice beer, pretty similar to the W06..maybe a bit spicier though."
"Pic Added."
"Ummm, well, a winter seasonal ale that makes a pretty darn good hoppy pale ale, unless that`s what I ended up with bottled with the wrong label."
