"O: Found it on Wishbeer, BKK.  That was the best part.  Its taste just was not up to par in my opinion.  So many components remind me of the mass produced China macro brown ales Iâ€™ve had, so I feel disappointed. Great label on the bottle though, that was certainly not China produced."

"Good Christmas ale with cinnamon coming through."

"Overall - Going off the only info I could find regarding Wychwood's bottling date, apparently the A3EFG code corresponds to it having been been brewed sometime in 2013. Considering how muted and watery this beer is, I'd say that's probably likely, and I'd venture to guess somewhere around 15 months old; not good for a beer that's only 5% ABV. A shame I hadn't caught this before I bought it."

"Pours a reddish-dark amber in color with about a good half-finger off-white creamy head. Some light sheets of lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of roasted malts and spice. Bit more going on with the taste with some dark fruits, caramel, yeast and toffee in the mix as well. A slightly dry hoppy finish was noticed but didn't last too long at all. Winter Warmer style brews have been all over the board. Medium-bodied with good carbonation."

"Received this as a present on Christmas Day and it's certainly the second best beer I've been given on that holiest of days.  Anyway, it's definitely a great looking beer with a pleasing scent of malts.  What I also enjoyed was the brew's smoothness - silkier than silk - and it helped mask the strong, almost too overpowering taste of the hops - a bit more bitter than I expected for an ale.  Overall, it a really good beer, and I really like getting the larger bottles - so friends, keep them coming."
"Overall: I figured that I'd save this one for Christmas Eve, so I did - my preferences are more towards the malt end of the spectrum but even so this one might be a tad overdone. That said, it is marketed as a winter ale and it hits the bullseye there. Good, but not amazingly so."

"Serving type: bottle."

"500ml bottle $4.99. I used to love Hobgoblin so I thought this would be nice and festive. Dark amber color, good head. Aroma is sort of malt vinegar which I get from English beers sometime, not a sour vinegar. Flavor is malt, malt, malt and not bad but I wouldn't buy this again."
""

"Not really a ""Christmas"" ale...missing the spices, but, an enjoyable dark ale. A fine offering from Wychwood."

"The taste has the same malt sweetness as the aroma suggests but with a touch of cardboard in the mix. That could be due to the age of this beer, which was probably not meant to be had 7-8 months after it came out."
""
""
"O: OK for the holidays."
"overall, the first thing that is evident is that this bottle is past its prime and i'm sure a brewery fresh pint would be rather festive to drink. that being said, i'm drinking this on March 31st during a raging blizzard when Spring is supposed to be springing and to that i say....BAH HUMBUG!!!!"

"Average, a bit more body, higher ABV content, and a dash more cinnamon may have made it more interesting. Or maybe I don't have the xmas spirit anymore!"

"Let the Xmas beers begin and pours a light hazed copper hue with a creamy three finger head and lacing everywhere,the smell is vanilla,strong cinnamon,bananna and dried fruits not expecting much from the smell of things and the feel doesn't get much better which is light bodied with moderate carbonation and the tastes are pretty much the same as hobgoblin with cinamon added and overall no this not for me cheers."

"alright beer and could imagine it being popular in the mainstream at Christmas but not one I would seek out again"

"O - i think this is my first winter warmer and i quite enjoyed this throughout. the aroma and flavor was way off from what i first expected and i found this fairly well balanced and easy to drink, i am glad i tried this."
""

"Final Grade: 3.52, a passable B grade. Wychwood's Bah Humbug is a rather plain winter warmer, but there's nothing inherently bad about or even wrong with it. The flavour is balanced but mild, with a gentle brushing of fruity spice and a finish/aftertaste that really ties the profile together. Unfortunately, it's just too light to have the same complexity and rich, inviting features that my favourite warmers tend to have. A serviceable English-style ale for the autumn and winter months."
"Overall - First of the style I've tried, but overall was pretty enjoyable. Was expecting a little more in the way of bold flavors but would definitely consider a repurchase."

"Overall, I probably wouldn't buy this beer again but it is drinkable. Just an average beer and a slight let down from its apperance and packaging."
""
""

"O - A solid winter ale with a decent flavour profile and an English ale backbone which makes for an easy drinking session ale. A tasty Christmas treat indeed!"
"Overall, good for a seasonal winter warmer. Wouldn't be a regular and there are better winter ales, but this is good. Reminiscent of fruit cake: caramelized ripe fruit, would only get in winter, traditional, makes me think only the English would create it."

"Overall, similar to the bulk of Wychwood's products for me: fine but not particularly good and not something I would return to."
"Bah! Not good at all - this could ruin your Christmas! A vile, cloying aroma of bananas pervades this ale. Too sweet, with an unbalanced fruitiness that lacks balance from the malt. Finishes with a harsh stewed bitterness that is equally unpleasant. The spice is also rather lacklustre. In short, not much to enjoy here. There are other beers out there - give this a miss. Bah Humbug indeed!"
"O/D: A little bit of a let down considering how good this beer looks, but it ends up tasting quite good in the end so it gets a passing grade. If you don't mind a beer heavy on the malts, this one is plenty drinkable. The cinnamon is a subtle twist and doesn't get in the way."
""
"I would have preferred additional roasted tones, or hop bitterness, but on a cold (Christmas) night, I can't argue with the ""winter warmer"" classification!"
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"M - Light to medium body with moderate carbonation."
"Final Thoughts: Bah Humbug indeed, this beer is a surprising disappointment from Wychwood. I mean, there isn't a lot here I can recommend other then the beer and the bottle looks nice. Nowhere near as good as Hobgoblin or Fiddler's Elbow (which seems to have disappeared in Ontario and from their website). You'll want to pass."
"not the big hitter I had expected in the taste stakes"
"O- One of my first craft beers and still one of my holiday favorites."
""
"I wasn't horribly impressed but this is a decent beer. It's not as smooth or vanilla-infused as say, my current local favourites, GI Winter Ale or Tree Vertical Winter Ale, but it still has all the necessary delicious Christmas spices in there. It just didn't pack the punch I was hoping for, so I personally won't likely be buying it again."
""
"This is the first brew I have enjoyed from this brewery and it is worth another try"
"Overall - Good winter warmer, definately much better than GI Winter Ale, but i'm sure i'll have better this christmas season. (or should I say, Christmas Saison?) Ha, I crack me up."
""
""
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
"Not a lot of actual warming given its rather mild ABV and I find it a bit too syrupy overall; however it's a nice, crisp-tasting and fruity ale that has just the right amount of spice."
"I would definatley buy this beer again, the cinnamon flavour stays in your mouth, it looks good, love the bottle, even though its considered a winter warmer I find it refreshing and could drink this all year round."
"Pours an almost opaque burgundy, with a finger or two cap of cream coloured head. Bubbly retention, and similar, denser lacing. Nose is faint, some caramel malts, a bit of butter, shades of darker fruits and darker breads. Taste follows, some lightly buttered dark breads, some mild spicing - maybe some cinnamon. Some brown sugar and vanilla notes, but some bitterness in there as well. Dry finish. Medium body, soft carbonation that is suited to this beer. Relatively drinkable, but fairly uninteresting throughout. Certainly a step up from the Samuel Smith Winter Welcome I had earlier, but I'm still gonna stick with St. Peter's Winter Ale as my choice Winter Warmer from over the pond."
"D: A very solid winter warmer that satisfies, but lacks complexity. Still a good sipper for these cold nights in and an excellent low-spice segue from plain ales to the more aggressively spiced winter warmers."
"Overall - One of the better holiday themed beers I've tried so far. The taste was very pleasant and not cloying in any ways. I'll grab a few more bottles of this and probably look for it again during future holiday seasons."
"D. A delicious dark mid winter ale to sip during the short winter days and/or long winter evenings."
"This beer is muddy orange in color with red amber hues. The 500 ml bottle pours nicely into my Guinness pint glass, leaving a a head two-finger's thick on top. The head eventually drops to a lace, then towards the bottom nothing but a few whispers of lace sticking to the glass. It's all butterscotch and soft yeast in the nose, which all by itself is nice, but a kick of sovent alcohol takes the enjoyment down a little. The same applies to the taste; butterscoth and nutty flavors run around, but the alcohol isn't shy of showing itself. Tasted blind, I would have guessed more along the lines of an ESB than a winter warmer. All said, solid beer."
"Overall - A good, but not outstanding winter beer. Those looking for the coffee bitterness/mild hop kick found in American Winter Warmers (which I do like) will not find it here. Still worth a shot for fans of the style though."
"It is the richness though that I seek from this sort of beer, so while I did enjoy what I drank, I was hoping for that big red firetruck for Christmas, not the socks and underwear which were probably more practical."
"Eh, not bad. This is a brown bottle that's been sitting out for a couple, three years. Poured with a nice, fine, creamy head that slowly settles down. Color is a cloudy brown with garnet highlights. Aroma is malt, caramel, toffee, maybe a bit of wet cardboard. Flavor's like aroma. Not overly sweet. No cinammon in nose, but perhaps a smidgen in the finish. Body is good and so is carbonation. Alcohol in the finish too. Drinkable."
"Overall it's a good beer, a little one sided on the cinnamon front and too light bodied for my liking though."
"The bottle filled my glass with a pale copper, which in turn filled my nose with cinnamon, dry fruits, butterscotch, and caramel. The taste is very similar. Hints of cinnamon, dry fruits, creamy butterscotch (diactyl? whatever, it works) caramel, and vanilla. Bah Humbug has an even finish, smooth, good presence in the mouth. Only downside for me is a touch too much CO2."
"D - Very drinkable brew. A step or two up from the macros and a nice winter seasonal."
"Smells lightly spiced, cinammon, English toffee, sweet aromas up front. Taste of caramel is most pronounced, some sweet dark fruit, low-medium bitterness and malty finish. Chewy mouthfeel, hints of Christmas cake, rather on the smooth side for a beer named after Scrooge. Overall, not bad at all and a suitable Christmas beer regardless of what calendar you follow."
"I had out of a 25 ounce bottle. This is a beautiful beer. Brown, basically opaque. It has a ton of sediment that it's practically gelatinous. It has a strong alcohol, malt scent. And like the scent, it's very malty, very alcoholly. Almost Port-wine-ish. It has kind of a brownie taste. Not that spicy for a Christmas ale, but flavorful."
"Nice label, though."
"It's a cloudy dark brown that produces head that dissipates quickly. It's aroma is rather lack-luster. Some simple malts and a touch of sugar. When I taste it I just get this feeling of generic brown ale, it's got some weight and body but nothing distinctive. It finishes good but it just wasn't worth the Wychwood price."
"Don't get me wrong, it is a good beer and I enjoyed it, just not what I have come to expect from a winter warmer."
"Pours a slightly hazed copper topped by a finger and half of beige head. Mediocre head retention and spotty lace. Big brown sugar aroma with notes of cinnamon and nuts. Tastes of toffee, dried fruit, cinnamon, and nuts. Slightly sweet and reminiscent of fruitcake. Mild, earthy, floral bitterness in the finish. Light-bodied with low carbonation, feels thin. It has a nice flavour to it, but could use a little more heft."
"While a nicely balanced, and enjoyable English ale, that's all there seems to be to it, the promise of the packaging gone up in the fireplace's smoke, metaphorically singing poor ol' St. Nick's sexy backside. Something with this outward attitude needs to show it on the inside as well, otherwise it's more of a ""Meh, Humbug!"" for this dreamer."
"This is drinkable but not one I'll be buying again. It's labeled as a Christmas ale but the taste is too all over the place. Also, for a Christmas ale I'd prefer something a little stronger. There is no warming with this one at 5%."
"D - This is an easy drinking ale that is not particularly special."
"D - Considering the version I'm trying is only 5%, the drinkability is quite high on this one. The cinnamon might get a bit boring after a few bottles, though."
"worth a go, definately try it!"
"Pours a opaque caramel color with a large tan head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Nothing wrong with the look of this winter warmer. I was surprised by the amount of hops in the aroma and flavor. The wonderful English hops give a floral and herbal aroma complimented by the malt that smells like caramel. Nice hop and malt flavor. The hops gives some herbal and earthy notes, the malt, toffee. Bitterness is low to moderate. The body is where this beer is let down. Surprised by how thin and watery it was. Although it might aid drinkability it does not feel substantial enough for a hearty winter warmer."
"Update: Drain Pour!"
"It's not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, but it's pretty mediocre. Worth a try, nice and malty on a grey late autumn day, but just not quite robust enough."
"D: I think this is to weak in all aspects. It's easy to drink, but I don't have any reason to buy another. Also to add, this beer states 5% and not 6% as BA says."
"Overall, yeah. I kind of don't mind this. It's a very English tasting Christmas beer."
"A good start to the Christmas beer season; can't wait to pick up more holiday brews! If you're looking for a decent Christmas ale, Bah Humbug is worth a go."
"Rather disappointed in this beer. Aroma is non-existent. Colour is orange amber with slightly off white head. Taste is fairly bland. Some spice and malt in the taste. With the flavours coming out mostly in the aftertaste the initial mouthfeel is non existent. Overall this beer is lackluster and I really won't revisit this next year."
"D- Very quaffable beer, and a perfect brew to enjoy on a cold day in front of the fireplace or just while watching a movie. It would make an excellent dessert beer as well, but I don't think I'd be able to drink several of these together. I will, however, purchase this one to enjoy on Christmas Day, and will get it again in the future!"
"Greate beer, great taste. The lable and the name suits the brew."
"Neat idea and certainly better than the pumpkin spiced beers I have tried ( not a fan of the pumpkin pie...looks pre-digested) Worth a try and i could certainy drink more than 1"
"That said, the drinkability is quite high. If I ever found this at a bar I would definately order one or two. I'm excited for this year's batch."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a cloudy dark amber, with a 2 finger thick of white foam head that lasted about 5mins. It left a thin layer and clung very well to the sides. Aroma was slightly sweet, hints of brown sugar, oranges, and cloves. Also picked up some yeast and malts. Taste was spicy sweet, oranges, nutmeg, and cloves. Felt solid in the mouth, coated well, and nicely carbonated. A bit of kick on the toungue. A little strong to drink, definitely a sipper."
"The taste is largely as above with a mild hoppy bite and a fruity finish. It's lighter than some winter warmes in body yet still pretty solid and has an engaging liveliness."
"Came across a bottle of this one this afternoon and decided it was time to give it a try. I received it as a Christmas present this past year and have to say it was one heck of a nice gift (you have to appreciate the label artwork). Not sure what exactly I was expecting from this, but was pleasantly surprised from the get go. Poured into a traditional English pint glass. Pours a smooth, sandalwood color with a nice frothy head. The nose is sweet, candy-like, a bit of licorice and honey. The first sip is pleasingly sweet, too, with the same mix of licorice and honey, almost like a Bit-o-Honey candy. The finish is soft, smooth, and warming, which you would come to expect from any good winter ale. Definitely a beer you can sit an enjoy on a cold winter day, or with any hearty dinner (stew, potroast, etc). Coincidently, this was my first experience with a Wychwood beer. After this selection, it will certainly not be my last."
"I wasn't really interested in a winter warmer, but since I have it in the house and it's April 1, I figured I better drink it soon. But then I tasted it. Leave it to Wychwood to always make a good beer. I find they excel at making complex tasting beers that are perfectly balanced. This one tastes a lot like Twizzlers, but it's also bitter, and somehow there's no clashing at all. The flavor evolves in the mouth in a perfectly logical fashion."
"One of the better Wychwood offerings that I've tried, although that's faint praise."
"If you like Winter Warmers and you like the English style, this is one of the best combinations of the two. This is not the best warmer by any means, but there is something about it so comforting, so appealing, and so damn drinkable that I went back to my local distributor and bought out the rest they had in stock."
"Taste has alot of the toasty, sweet, cola and mineral flavors that are in the nose. I dont get much of a christmas feel from this beer. Has a nice creamy mouthfeel, but the unfermentable sugars are a bit much for me. Nothing particularly excites me about the brew, I think I will say bah humbug and pass on purchasing this one next year."
"Drinkability: Very nice English ale. Happy that the ale is not over powered by spice flavors, when they're too strong they tend to ruin the beer. Definitely nice for a cold winter's night."
"This beer has a dark amber color and a opaque appearance that doesn't let much light through. It has a slight scent where you can smell the spices. Likewise the taste is not all that exciting. You can definitely taste the hops first and then the spices. The beer is not carbonated that much either. Overall it is ok to drink. Though probably not one that I would seek out."
"This isn't a bad brew. A fine and easy going sipper."
"Overall, this is a very easy to drink beer and it reminds me a lot of Sam Adams Honey Porter. It is a great beer and a must try for the winter months."
"Overall a solid Winter Warmer. I'd probably say this ranks right in the middle of all of the Winter Warmers I have had."
"I really like some Wychwood beers. This one's good, and I'm glad I tried it, but it's not going to bring me back. I'd be more likely to try some others of the style to see where this one fits, and to see if there are any in the style that make me want to come back for another."
"A cloudy neutral light brown. Little off white head with a nice lacing but brief retention. Still overall. Caramel and vanilla nose. Little bitterness in the scent. The taste is similar a sweet affair. The aftertaste is blessed with a mild nuttiness and quenched by a light dry bitterness. Fuller than most browns but poor retention offsets this positive. I found it to be on par with a Northern brown similar to Newcastle in quality. Well maybe Newcastle 10 years ago. Certainly not potent or special enough to be up there with the best Winter Warmers/Christmas Ales especially not at the price I paid."
"Pours a light amber hue, small head with a sticky, lasting lace. Smells very malty, same stickiness as the palate. Taste is almost early spring beer -- lots of sour malt, some mild caramel, little carbonation. Passable, but I enjoyed it. Would try again."
"Delicious and eminently drinkable, this is a fine Warmer, one I'd like to see improved but one I'll try again. Good stuff."
"I was quite disappointed in this beer. I note that there seems to be quite a variation in the scoring on BA. Maybe the 6% brew was better?"
"M = Medium, heavy body, thick, meaty mouthfeel, very good coating, frothy carbonation like drinking a highly frothed coffee drink."
"I was pleased this was not in a clear bottle. I was not pleased with the overall result however. Poured dark and murky- not in a good way. Head retention was average. It did not smell spoiled, but for some reason did have a harsh aroma of apples and fruit. Certainly palatable, it did have a decent maltiness to it, bready as it warmed. Nothing really to distinguish it. Worth a try I suppose- would want to try it on tap to see the difference."
"Mouthfeel - Medium, watery, with a slightly coarse, dry finish. Low carbonation makes it go down smoothly."
"Very nice winter brew, will have again."
"Quite a pleasant winter warmer. Its not as spicy as I would expect, but the added sweetness, caramel and cinnamon combine to create a very pleasant drink to relax with on a winter's evening."
"I liked this a winter beer for sure. Great to sit back and sip on."
"Unfortunatly this year though the LCBO's (Ontario Liqour Stores) shippment of this seasonal beer offered it at only 5% ABV... two years ago it was 6%, then last year 5.3%... now 5. Still a good beer, just don't like it when breweries change recipes of good brews."
"Pours an amber/ chestnut brown with a foamy, yellowish head. Aroma dominated by cinnamon and spice. Smooth drinking with a very interesting mix of flavors. Nice maltiness with flavor of cherries, banana and a nice bitter cinnamon finish."
"Taste is heavy on the malt, with lots of christmas spice. The cinnamon, brown sugar, vanilla, and candied fruits are prevalent, tipping the balance towards too sweet for me. That's not to say there isn't a light herbal bitterness that attempts to balance, but this is more dessert than anything for me. The mouthfeel is medium-heavy, and the carbonation is low, in the British way. It's non-offensive but it's still a bit seet for my liking, and I wouldn't want more than one."
"Mouthfeel was medium to high. The carbonation was medium to low. Good combination, this beer was enjoyable as it warmed up a bit. I had this with dessert (cheesecake) and it went pretty well with something so sweet."
"Overall: Get the picture? I imagine they took regular old Hobgoblin and added some cinnamon to the kettle. The older version was 6% alcohol but this was 5%. I recall really enjoying the old version a lot more. This one is more drinkable, but not as Christmasy in flavour as the previous version."
"A pretty damn good spiced ale."
"D: A nice drinking and well balance Christmas ale with a nice maltiness and well balanced spiciness perfect for the winter night."
"Pours a clear brown color, big foamy head, big bubbles, some lacing, but quickly diminishing. Malty sweet, somewhat nutty aroma. Maybe tree bark or fruit rinds, not very pleasant. Slight bitter beginning taste, nutty middle taste, clean aftertaste. Somewhat watery. That same rind aroma is present in the taste, almost a smoky smell. Quickly diminishing in flavor. Some spices, maybe pumpkin or fall-like. Okay."
"Got this as a joke gift from one of my Aunts last Christmas. This one was pretty disappointing to me. I see it had pretty good reviews here but I had trouble finishing it. Seemed like it was unbalanced and was hard to even finish. The taste was very bland and paltry as well. I would not want to try this one again."
"Great English Christmas ale."
"D - Alot better than I expected. Nice holiday flavor, and just low enough on the alcohol level to keep this within the sessionable limits. I will definitely be having a few more of these this winter."
" Fairly easy to drink, yet one is enough, thank you."
"Poured with a firm sturdy, foamed up head. The head look like a Guinness. Deep amber color. Smelled a bit oxidized. Spiciness and malt sweetness. Cinnamon aroma as well. The flavor reminded me of hard candy, I can not recall which one. A very candyish flavor. A bit of hops also. Smooth almost nitro like mouthfeel. A pretty good warmer, more to it than I expected really."
"Drinkability: Relatively easy and goes down pretty smooth. Light but very apparent alcoholic taste as well as mild hops gives it its only kick going down."
"Balanced hops and carbonation thrust the sweet malty flavors to the foreground of this offering. A smooth drinking beer that is soft on the mouth and easy to consume. I'm not a huge fan of English beer and not winter warmers but this one is tasty. I feel like this one can be enjoyed year round and is quite refreshing."
"D: Fine, but not very enticing."
"1 Pint .9 fl oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Not much of a head, just a thin lacing of cream colored frothy goodness that dissipates quickly. Red, dark caramel color. Very malty aroma, but not spicy. Smells like molasses. Very smooth mouthfeel. Again, not spicy like you would expect from a winter warmer, but rather malty flavor that is accompanied by a very light hoppy bitterness. Drinkability is very high, goes down very smooth."
"M&D: Light to medium weight in the mouth with light carbonation lending itself toward a nice creamy swallow. The mouthfeel and moderate ABV sort of save an otherwise mediocre brew."
"500mL bottle purchased from LCBO. Consumed in Feb 08 with a best before date of August 08. Pours a darrk copper with some head and not much carbonation. Aroma is weak. First taste feels a bit thin. It does get better, with some reasonable maltiness and a touch of spice in the aftertaste. Surprisingly light for 6%."
"Maroon colored poor with a short lived head. Smell was of sweet and sourish malt. Taste was slightly sweet and tart, with a light bitter kick in the finish. Kind of like slighly burnt caramel, and reminded me almost of an ESB. Perhaps the faintest touch of alcohol in the flavor. This one grew on me as I drank it, and I upped it from 2.5 to 3 overall."
"Interesting as a seasonal beer, generally well put together and worth a try."
"Drinkability: Pretty good but sort of flat in flavor and complexity. Bitterness is awkward and unpleasant. Pass on this one if something better is available."
"Overall: Drinkable strong ale, but not exciting. At the price, I'd recommend giving it a pass and selecting something else."
"Drinkability> too clove and piney for my liking, but a fellow taster thought it was divine, so I guess I have to give it average drinkability."
"Poured from the bottle into an imperial pint glass. Very thick head of foam that held form for about 20 minutes and turned into a creamy lace. Dark reddish color with enough carbonation. The taste of Christmas spices really stand out throughout the whole glass. It appears to be some nutmeg, cinnomon and something else that I can not put my finger on. Pretty good overall. For about 2 dollars a bottle it was well worth it."
"550ml brown bottle from A-1 To-Go in Gardiner. Pours a hazy red-amber translucent body with a quarter inch of light tan head. Smells like cinnamon, apple, pear, and banana. Tastes fruity with caramel and cinnamon playing large roles. A rather thin aqueous body with less carbonation than expected, but otherwise nothing wrong with this brew. Definitely not the best winter warmer out there, but a decent drinker and a fairly solid beer."
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear amber color ale with a good size foamy head with good retention and very good lacing. Aroma of caramel malt and cinnamon are very well balanced. Taste is again very well balanced between caramel malt and cinnamon with some notes of banana and cloves also discernable. Body is very creamy-like with some great carbonation and a medium full body. I thought the mix between the malt and the cinnamon was very well done in this one."
"Taste is fairly nutty, the caramel and malt take the forefront though and the follow-up is rather spicy with hints of hops, bit of a metallic aftertaste."
"Drinkability: The off flavors here just make this one disappointing"
"Pours a brilliantly clear reddish-brown mahogany in color with about two fingers of somewhat dense head that has decent retention and leaves little lacing. Smell is strongly malty, namely caramel malts, a bit spicy, a bit fruity (figs), and just a touch of hops. Taste is mostly malty and a bit spicy with some figs and dark fruits but then gives way to a pleasant hop presence. Just before the finish there is a bit of alcohol and a somewhat faded spiciness that far outlasts the hops. As this beer warms and as i drink more of, I find a rather pleasant aftertaste that I can only describe as fig-like. Mouthfeel is ok, medium-light body that is somewhat slick and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is ok, I didn't enjoy this beer all that much at first but as this warmed a bit I really began to like this beer. The fruity characteristics of this beer really emerged as it warmed. I recommend drinking this one at cellar temp."
"Not my favorite Christmas Ale by a long shot, but not bad either. The beer pours a clear, nut brown color with some tannish head that dissipates quickly. Some lacing, moderate carbonation, the smell is a bit musty, caramel, malty, candied liquorice. The consistency is surprisingly thin for a Xmas ale. In fact, this is more like a nut brown ale with a dash more caramel, but not what I would consider a Xmas ale given its thinness and lack of real spiciness. The taste, as mentioned, is British style nut brown with a slight twist. You'll get a combination of dryness, malty caramel, some spicy tang, and nut flavors on the front end. Towards the finish, the nut flavors round out even more and this is where the nut brown backbone to this beer comes through. There is a little bit more sweetish malts that emerge in the middle towards the finish as well. The beer is rather thin, with a light to medium consistency, and easily drinkable. It's okay, not bad, but nothing I would return to. I didn't realize that this brewery also makes Hobgoblin, which is a much better offering if you're sold on this brew house."
"D - I had a difficult time with this one, as it wasn't anything special to me, just another English Ale."
" ~ This is a one-time try for me. I'm glad I had the chance and I will recommend this to anyone."
"Notes - Unexceptional but solid and easy to drink."
"drinkability: overall a good brew, pitty it's only seasonal."
"This beer poured a hazy brown color with a big rocky tan head that quickly fell. The aroma is sweet and has strong caramel notes. The taste is malty and full of caramel/Belgian candy flavors. The hops are subtle in the background Â– this is a malty brew. The mouthfeel is quite full and works well. Overall, I wasnÂ’t expecting to be this surprised by another Christmas Ale Â– but I am!"
"D - The Bah Humbug is a little thin in my opinion but still good. What it lacks in body is made up for in how smooth it is."
"Very nice winter warmer beer. It has lots of good flavors and a hefty body. But at 6% not so strong as to be a knockout."
"Pours dark amber, slightly hazy and with a small white head that fades very fast. Aroma is higher alcohols up front, crystal malts, and some earthy hops, with a faintly yeasty background. Flavor is very estery, with obvious alcohol notes and very nice crystal malt character. Finish is malty, with lots of butterscotch and alcoholic notes."
"just wanna say all the wychwood beers come in really nice bottles with great artwork. i think this one is there best one yet though its nothing like all the other christmas ales ive been trying . it pours nice color good aroma . the thing that stands out on this beer is the mouthfeel it really tingles on the tongue . i know its a seasonal but i think this could be a good all year beer like i said its not really in the christmas ale category .but since i dont live in england it is rather expensive if you were to session it ."
"As I have already indicated, a fine beer, pity the head did a runner early."
"This is an easy beer to have. It is well-balanced and without any flaws. I imagine if I were to have this in an English pub drawn from the cellar, it would be spectacular."
"Wychwood Bah Humbug Christmas Ale pours a clear deep red with a thin but lasting head. The aroma is rich caramel and dark fruits, very sweet with some hints of metallic hops. The flavor is nice and flavorful, but seems to be lacking something from the aroma. The dark carmel malts are there and there is a nice rounded bitterness, but the beer seems thin overall. There's some diacetyl in the background, but not too much to be unpleasant."
"Pours an inviting dark-brown / toffee color out of a tall bottle... Smell is wonderful - full of spices... cinnamon, toffee, and vanilla... Such an explosion of flavors in the aroma... high hopes for the taste, which doesn't dissapoint... Much different than some other winter warmers I've sampled... this one is easily the best one I've had so far... The cinnamon and vanilla-spice flavor is so rich - this is an awesome brew.... definitely worth the $4.00 for the 16.9 oz bottle... too bad I can't find it in a six-pack... Doesn't have that oily flavor that some other winter warmers have, which I really appreciate... Mouthfeel is great, but with such an explosion of flavors, I wouldn't want to down more than one or two of these in a single setting... Although I love the spicey- graham cracker taste... Superb beer... Definitely worth a try, and certainly recommended..."
"Overall the sweetness is respectable and the bitterness is there it just seems unbalanced to me. But nevertheless its one of the better winter beers and hands down the best offering from an average brewer. Worth a try around Christmas for sure."
"This ale is a beautiful coppery amber, generates a decent head. Aroma is strong and malty with a nice nip to it and a hint of spice. Flavor is rich and malty, with spicy sub-tones and just a whisper of molasses. It goes down very smoothly and pleasantly. There is no thinness in the taste or texture - this is a rich winter ale. Besides, you have to love the name!"
"Softened notes of gingerbread, cinnamon, and banana make for a darn fine winter warmer in my books. I approached this beer with a great deal of skepticism given Wychwood's inconsistencies, but was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I'll revisit again during these holidays."
"Served from a bottle, this pours a clear reddish brown color, with a small white head and minimal lacing on the glass. The smell is slightly sweet. The taste is sweet, with cherry and plum flavors predominating, with a hint of vanilla. I don't detect much hop presence, as seems typical with winter warmers.The flavors blend together smoothly and the mouthfeel is rich and satisfying. This is a nice solid English Christmas Ale. Now if only I could get it on draft or on cask."
"As already mentioned, this is a nice creamy beer, surprising for the appearance to me. Good ale carbonation, no complaints there. Great winter beer all around, love it."
"This is probably the best beer I've had from Wychwood. I'll have to stock up. Also, it came in a brown bottle instead of clear. Is this a new trend, or just specific for this brew? Colours sort of a light, almost murky brown. Very little head to speak of. Just a light, perhaps 1/4 finger of foam was the best I could get. Smell was delightful. That almost signature British ale smell. Sweet malts, caramel and toffee, bit of figs, and some light cinnamon. Somewhat floral and earthy hops, with the emphasis slighty towards floral. Very balanced flavour. The sweet and bitterness intermingle. Just the right amount of malt, caramel and fig sweetness counterbalanced by a grassy, earthy bitterness. The two never overpower one another. And for the finish, a spicy, cinnamon bite. Quite a nice flavour. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light. It's by no means watery, but it's light. Very little carbonation that seems to give it almost a creamy, milky feel. The mouthfeel adds to the drinkability. Very good beer, with enough flavour to keep your tongue satisfied but not so much that it overwhelms the senses. Too strong for a session brew, but definitely an enjoyable beer."
"This is definitely NOT a session beer, but something to be savored in front of a fire. I have tasted quite a few winter beers, and this is currently my favorite."
"Another decent offering from Wychwood. This was neither exceptional nor a displeasing. Poured a lovely orange spice colour with a big fluffy, craggy white head. Smell was almost entirely malt with a bit of fruit hiding in the back. Taste was bitter hops up front, sweet malt in the middle, and a biscuity malty finish. Mouthfeel seemed par for the course for both the brewery and the style. Again, this neither impressed me nor did I dislike it. Good."
"Opinion: This is an interesting beer, and I have to admit early on that I am not a huge fan of British Bitters for the most part. This is labeled as a Winter Warmer, but it isn't as rich as a lot of them are. This beer is on the boundary between an ESB and an Old Ale...and closer to the former. It is an allright beer, but I won't be seeking it out. Not for it's own beer, but because it's not my style."
"Pours a beautiful ruby red color with a nice thick head. Aroma is mostly malt and spice and it also smells somewhat sweet. Taste is malty upfront and the aftertaste is a little sweet with some spice. Chewy and I'm able to detect somewhat of a gingerbread vibe to this. A second sip confirms the spice. This beer is very bready and thick. The aftertaste leaves a lot to be desired but other than that, this beer is nice and drinkable. Inoffensive and it doesn't ramp up the spices like most winter warmers."
"A Christmas ale? Bah. Humbug! this tastes like cough syrup. I think it's supposed to taste like liquefied Christmas cake. if that is true then it is a raging success. It's alright. I don't hate it. It's a novelty beer. The label said it had cinnamon in it but that particular spice doesn't come through enough for my liking. Maybe this would taste good mulled. I bet it would. Mulling"
"Sampling this one for work. We're bringing this one in for the holiday season. The appearance is a coppery-reddish color with a thin, off white head which disappears quickly. The smell is a mostly sweet smell. Not much else to it. I taste mostly sweetness (caramel) and not much hops at all. The mouthfeel is a medium body with medium carbonation. The drinkability is not bad. It's an above average beer with a nice malty taste. The heaviness is something nice for winter."
" Overall this would have to get a decent from me. Nothing really spectacular going on here and just nothing really overwhelming me to say anything different. I really could not see myself having this during the winter season as it is just too light. Nothing that grabs you and says warm about it. It was just a spiced up brown ale for me and that was about it. I am not bashing it as it was quite tasty actually, just nothing mind blowing here. For session ale ok with a hint of something a little more.."
"Aftertaste hangs around a good while. Medium body at best, light efferevescence. All told, a middle of the road English ale across the board. Easy ot drink but nothing to really separate it from any other brown ale."
"Overall, an enjoyable yet unusual beer. If you like winter beers it's certainly worthy of a try. Personally, while I found it rather interesting, it's not so much my thing, and I'll probably pass in the future."
"When cold, this beer is overwhelming burnt-bitter, but once cooled down in the English style (even the Queen would be 'amused)' it was extremely well-rounded and pleasant. Above average! Merry Christmas in April!"
"OK, so itÂ’s March Madness ... what better time for a Christmas beer? This poured a nice big, duddy, rusty orange with a solid cloud cover of off-white foam. The aroma is surprisingly sweet and tart, like a freshly picked orange dripping all over your hand. The first sip is also sweeter than IÂ’d expected ... more orange peel than the advertised cinammon. ThereÂ’s a milkiness here, too, though, that settles into a banana smoothie essence as it warms. The more I go, the more of a banana cream pie I think IÂ’m consuming, a 150-degree change from the tease of the first aroma, and contrary altogether from the dark visual. This is a big creamy and fruity beer for the style. Definitely drinkable. (#2757, 3/18/2007)"
"Drinkability- Not great, not bad."
"Drinkability- On the one hand, it's light and approachable... so that's good. But there's nothing memorable here... for the style, the belly should be slightly warm and the senses titillated with holiday spices. This falls a bit flat."
"Other comments: Not too bad. It's actually one of the more Christmasy Christmas special ales I've tried -- rather than the usual English winter warmer comprised of a brewery's standard bitter with an extra pound of malt and hops added. The cinnamon adds an interesting back-note and warmth."
"Overall: A good ale; IÂ’d probably rate it higher but IÂ’m just not a fan of the style."
"Poured out a reddish brown color, somewhat clear, with a slight off white head that dissapears quickly. Nose of malt, mild cinnamon, cherry, and some other mild spice. Taste offers malt, mollasses, dark dried fruit, alcohol, cherry, and balsamic vinegar. Has a thick syrupy mouthfeel. Kind of dissapointing finish, finishes watery and weak, but cloying, not clean."
"Beer was deep amber with a thinning offf white head. Lacing was pretty good. Very sweet malty aroma, little hop is evident. very smooth malty palate with some sweetness. Carbonated mouthfeel, a bit too much for an English beer imho. Not bad though and I would suggest trying it out on a cold night."
"While not the most interesting Christmas Ale I've had, it is definitely a decent one if you give it a chance."
"Mouthfeel"
"I'd use this beer along with the christmas dessert, or as a dessert in it's own. An excellent choice for a quiet evening with family and friends."
"Pours a two-finger cream head that fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Nice clear amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Slight malty nose. Starts balanced to slightly sweet some doughyness, tries to be bitter at finish but fails. Don't get any cinnamon flavor. $3.99 for a 500ml bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"Complex and tasty while being easy to drink for the style. It's not the heaviest or most ""warming", but a great choice for a more drinkable, ""sessionable"" winter ale. A very good example of an English-style winter ale."
"D - Pretty damn good for a ""winter warmer."" I'd drink it again."
"500 ml. bottle Â–mahogany hue Â–nice stark white head, medium bubbles lingering Â– nose bananas , malt , cloves , and a candy quality Â– taste of bananas , malt , spices , slight bitterness Â– smooth palate, little carbonation - aftertaste bitter , hopps , sour and earthy"
"Pours mahogany in color with a creamy light tan-head that fades into a nice lace. Nose is fruity apricot and raspberry jam along with a bit of butterscotch. Taste is lightly roasted malt and a bit of raisin along with a mild holiday spiciness. A moderate hoppiness finishes out the beer."
"16.9oz brown bottle with no freshness date. Pours a medium copper with a good 2 finger head, decent longevity and nice lace. Not a huge aroma here but what is noticeable is a definate caramel malt mixed with some spice and a bit of pine. Definate caramel malts in the taste mixed with a decent amout of hop flavor and finishes with a cinnamon and nutmeg aftertaste. Not hugely complex, but complex enough to enjoy. Not one of my favorite winter warmers but still a very nice one."
"Drinkability: while easy to drink, doesn't necessarily remind me of a Christmas ale. Not really a winter warmer. Not enough complexity, depth or even alcohol warmth in the mouth."
"D- This beer is pretty bland and it reminds me of a very delicate beer that sat on a boat for too many months. The flavors and smells are not crisp or distinct or fresh. The bottle did say it was brewed this year so I would like to try it direct from the brewery to see if it is any different."
"LCBO tasting sample- The colour of amber gems. Head is beige, and generously frothy, but no lace is left behind. Spices(nutmeg), pumpkins, christmas cake, roasty malts come together in the nose. Flavours are sweet and spicy with pumpkin and christmas pudding and fruitcake finishing with some bitterness. Befitting of this time of year. I suspect others have had this in a clear bottle, and thus rated a little lower than the few recent Canadian ratings. A treat."
"Pours a deep blood red with copper and bright pink highlights gleaming forth from the perfectly clear body. The head is a light tan, tall and thick, leaving gobs and sheets of lacing all over the sides of the glass. Retained well, with streams of carbonation surfacing from the bottom of my tulip throughout the pint. Absolutely gorgeous. Smell is a touch disappointing. Their very distinctive yeast strain comes through loud and clear, but the spices and maltiness suffer as a result. Still, cinnamon is obvious, along with bright caramel and a bit of butter. Dark fruits and boozy rum are minor notes, all good things, but a bit muddled and not as bold and distinct as they could be. Taste is better, spicy and inviting. Cinnamon is obvious, along with cloves and a bit of pepper. The fruits are missing in action, just a hint of raisin remaining, but the caramel is very assertive. Finishes rather hoppy, at least for a winter warmer. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, well carbonated, but it could really use more body to extend the finish and bring out some of the darker notes. Drinkability is good. Not bad at all, a solid offering from Wychwood, but I can't help but think that if they put as much effort into their beer as they do in their marketing they'd be world class."
"the flavor is kinda lacking in my opinion, it is a good beer with its malty, minerially, hop flavor, and hints of spice. but the beer is a little watery, in a christmas ale i expect a bit more body and flavor. maybe i;m just to used to american christmas ales but this beer is a little watery."
"drinkability is not so good. can't say i'll be going back for more of this one."
"Bah Humbug pours a clear ruby red, topped with a copious, and thick off-white head. Metallic notes are prominent in the nose. Taste is quite buttery, and mouthfeel very creamy and thick to start off. I'm not tasting any of the cinnamon that's supposed to be in this. Fruitiness and a heavy roasted grain flavour is here and a touch of tartness up front, which gives way quickly to a low-intensity, but lasting bitter finish. This is neither dry nor sweet, but somewhere in the middle, not as refreshing as I find EPAs and bitters to usually be; it's a bit on the heavy side. Overall, an appropriate choice for the season - served not too cold, and in big mouthfuls, I would have this either after dinner, or instead of."
"Final Statement: This will not be my christmas beer this year but It's still not bad. A little too fruity for my liking."
"Its not a good sign when the best part of the taste is the finish. You find yourself drinking a bit quicker than usual to either enjoy the next beer or get to the best part of this one. There is nothing spectacular about this, which is a shame given the usual tasty nature of Winter Warners, and especially one so pretty to look like. Truly a legacy to not judging a book by its cover. There are far better examples of this genre available. Try it if your curious or offered one, but otherwise you can do a lot better than this. Bah Humbug indeed..."
"As a huge fan of English ales I found this quite remarkable. In fact, I loved it! I think I might pass out to find a pint of it, cask-conditioned, in London during the holidays.... but I digress. It should be enjoyed at or near cellar temperature, in the proper glassware (an Imperial pint), and with the right frame of mind. Beautifully done! A real gem."
"Bah Humbug is far from the favorite beer that I have ever tasted, but that is a personal taste. With that said, I would suggest giving it a try."
"Unusual bottle with witches imprinted onto the glass. Pours a nice soft dark shade of amber, clear with a tiny bubble, moderate head, and leaving better then average lacing. Minor nose of maple and malt. Smooth and malty brew, notes of light caramel, toffee, vanilla, and perhaps some light holiday type spicing. British all the way, pleasant winter sipper or would go nicely with a large winter meal. Nicely crafted and worth a try, especially for lovers of Brit style ales."
"A good cold weather beer that is for sure."
"It's one of those obscure English brews that is chalked full of flavor, but very undescript. A deep coper color with nice retention, low carbonation, and nice lacing. Smells solidly malty, but with a light syrup / molassas malt character. Low fruityness or hopiness. Tastes, again syrup / molassas sweet, but little character afterwords. Perhaps some light spicing, but tough to tell with the sweetness. Feels less thick than the flavors and aromas would suggest. Pleasant, just sweet. Finishes sweet and bold with amber malts. The beer is a solid beer, but seems to be light with complexity or descernable character beyond dark amber malt."
"Aftertaste is red apple which cleans the palette nicely."
"Pours a clear amber/brown, huge thick off white head forms, great retention, excellent lacing. Smell is pretty powerful, vanilla and spice, caramel, very malty, sweet and heavy on the cinnamon. Taste is strange, apples and spice, tons of cinnamon, some vanilla, almost a bourbon smell/flavour to it. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, spices coat the mouth. Not sure I like this, way too overspiced. Probably the most unappealing beer I've ever come into contact with. Could only take a couple sips before it went down the drain."
"Medium brown colour with some scent of cinammon and malt. More sweet than spicey, a bit complex with nutmeg and some chocolate malts. Decent head. Spicy refreshing with drying finish. Some hops there. Medium mouthfeel.Not bad and worth having once. Appropriate carbonation. Drinkability=worth sharing."
"A pretty tastey winter warmer, just a little too sweet and cinnamony for me (though Im not a big fan of cinnamon)."
"This is a seasonal that has redeemed Wychwood as a brewer of thin ales in my opinion. This was a flavorful seasonal ale with an ample body and a mixture of flavorings that work well...good offering...I will but a few to share with friends over mince meat this Xmas."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Pretty drinkable, easily the best thing I've had from this brewery since i lived 25 miles from it! Will certainally seek this out again"
"Overall a pretty average offering."
"16.9 ounce bottle."
"Notes: The flavor is there yet with the thinness this beer has, it seems to be lacking a bit for a winter warmer. Pretty good, but lacks a bit IMO."
"Drinkability is below average. I wish these breweries would just leave ths beers in their markets on draught but I guess if folks like me keep buying and trying they can mae money, but this beer was a real snoozer, nothing offensive just completely bland and rather odd."
"Mouthfeel- Medium body with some stickyness to the middle of the tongue. Pretty smooth and silky going down the gullet."
"Coppery in color-slight haze going on. Great big head on top. Low aroma-somewhat malty with a slight sulfury tinge behind it. Malty flavor with slight hop bitterness. Very mild oak flavor. Good mouthfeel to it-somewhat slick and velvety. An above average effort-similar to the more polular ""winter welcome"" everyone is familiar with."
"This offering poured with a good finger and a half off-white head that's a bit flimsy for the depth it displays. The color is copper, but with a definite orange hue. The nose is malty and biscuity with soft caramel notes protruding as well. It displays a medium body with a fluid and slick mouthfeel. While there are no standout flavors, most of the subdued taste blend well, among them; orange, fresh bread, somewhat peppery essence, and a malt-tilted flavor. This English interpretation of a winter warmer is a lot smoother and easier to drink then its American counterpart. The finish holds more of the balance, as subtle hop notes emerge to compliment a caramel sweetness. I would describe this is a pleasant experience, nothing outstanding."
"Even Scrooge couldn't get too crabby about this, though...except for the $4 price for the bottle. I even think I paid too much, now that I think about it."
"Dry and medium bodied, just not heavy enough, needs more malt and spices. Way to expensive for what you get. One 500ml bottle will do it for me."
"Tasted pretty much like it smelled. Notes of rye and raisons in the flavor with a definative wine-like sourness in the finish."
"Glad to see Wychwood went with a brown bottle. Not nearly enough heft to qualify as a winter warmer, so I feel a bit cheated that the brewery is passing it off as such with a catchy label to capitalize on the holiday. A decent beer, if taken as an ESB. Lots of caramel malt, with hints of brown sugar. Smooth, with a clean finish."
"A nice english ale, but not sure what defines it as a winter warmer, not big booze or spices. A decent enough beer but similar to most of the breweries other offerings."
"Otherwise, this is a drinkable ale that is a nice accompaniment to a christmas meal, or by itself."
"D: Very nice."
"Bah Humbug is definitely one of Wychwood's better offerings. Jacking up the malt and hops does not a winter warmer make, but it does result in a pretty good beer from a brewery that, in my experience, struggles to brew 'pretty good' beer. I'm on the fence with this one. Since today is Christmas, I'll be generous and give it a tentative thumbs up."
"Overall Impression: The main flavor is fairly close to apple or pear, very fruity. ItÂ’s very dry which helps drinkability. Everything seems on the edge of a flaw, but IÂ’m thinking maybe itÂ’s just a style IÂ’m not used to. ItÂ’s much better than the light struck mess I got with Scarecrow, but nothing to do back flips over. It has me thinking if I see a Scarecrow in a brown bottle, they might get another shot from me."
"Nothing like a regular warmer. Hints of Worcestershire confuse things even further. An okay beer."
"Reddish-brown in color. Lots of caramel in the nose, also a small amount of hop. The taste is slightly rich, again, with lots of caramel flavors but only a little hop to back it up. Also a small amount of spice and dark fruit flavor. The overall impression is basicaly sweet and malty. The mouthfeel is pretty good, with some decent body and carbonation to offset it. Unfortunately, the overall impession was not all that great. I would say it was too sweet for the lack of depth in the flavor. It was ok, but I doubt I'll go here next year."
"The beer pours a hazy reddish-amber in color with a thick creamy light tan head. Nice malty aroma with a hint of cinnamon, sweet caramel, raisin and a feint whiff of alcohol. Medium-to-full-bodied mouthfeel with pleasant carbonation. Very malty upfront. Dried fruit and spices emerge in the middle. Hint of raisin and vanilla in the finish. The 6.0% abv is masked pretty well. Nice offering from Wychwood and a very smooth winter warmer."
"Nice to see Wychwood using brown bottles, spread the word to your British bretheren. Pours a dark rusty amber with a thumb of khaki bubbles. Nose is spicey and sweet, like a gingerbread cookie, a malty gingerbread cookie. Taste is dominated by a robust, but not overpowering winter warmer spice blend and sweet caramel/toffee malts. Mouthfeel is a little thin but lager slick, but what British beer that I've encountered hasn't? Overall a tasty and relatively easy-drinking winter warmer, but I couldn't have more than one."
"I poured this one into an over sized wine glass. the color was a nice brownish amber. The head was thin and tan with little lacing. The carbonation is nice. Had a malty smell with figs, brown sugar and mild spice. Great mouthfeel easy to drink, too easy. I love this beer, too bad its a winter seasonal. I would drink it all the time."
"Mid brown with a slight haze( bit light tan head though). Not much of a nose to speak of( some malt wafting around), this beer needs a turning up of the volume knob. The taste is malty and dryish on the finish but for a winter warmer I want more malt and more finish. The saving grace is that the balance is there and so is the framework of a good beer but like a radio with the sound turned down it is hard to really appreciate it."
"Taste; mildly spiced and a malty, with just a little nut flavor. Theirs a little bit of a hop tang, but not very much. None of the flavors really stands out very much in this beer, but it idoes go down really easy. Overall I was expecting much more out of this ""Winter Warmer""."
"Pours a nice amber color with a sparse coating of head and a slight cloudyness. Nose is interesting. Buttery toffee, brown sugary, with a moderate fruityness. I think the diacetyl is working with this brew. Flavor is much more roasty and raisiney. Almost like some raisin bread. There is just a light touch of hoppy bitter on the finish. No spice. Feel is moderate with a light moderate carbonation. This is definately a nice brew. Everything works well together. I like this for a winter warmer. Might be the best from the brewery I have had."
"Hazed burnt sienna appearance, pale yellow frothed milk head of pretty decent staying power. Good interlocking laces on the glass. Aroma between apricot and medium-bitter marmalade. Carbonation is average, mouthfeel approaches this mark as well. Flavor is not bad, approachable, certainly skewed toward the malty side, a touch of a candied fruit tone with a darker more molasses and hot nutmeg backdrop and finish. Could use a bit more solidity in the overall body, but its a drinkable enough brew and one of the better Wychwood bottled beers to my mind."
"Moderate mouth that has just enough carbonation tingle. I could drink a few more for sure."
"Mouthfeel is medium and smooth. It falls a little short for a winter warmer, not a lot to set it apart. Not that it's bland, it would make a nice everyday brew, but not really distinctive or with a depth of flavor that would make me anticipate it from one season to the next."
"The color is somewhere between copper and amber. The creamy head is light brown and on the small side. Aroma is faint with a vague molasses-like malt smell. A sip begins with a sweet, bready malt flavor that has of touch of butteriness. So far this tastes a little bit like Fat Tire. Midway through a molasses flavor joins the mix alongside a moderate amount of alcohol. This taste carries through to the finish and is capped with a burst of dry hop flavor. Overall, the flavor is very good, but I expect something bigger and more interesting from a winter warmer."
"Overall, this is horribly overpriced for what you get. Thoroughly undistinct flavour, not enough spices, not enough hops, lacking almost everywhere."
"Not a bad beer from Wychwood. I was looking for something kind of special to drink tonight, so this'll do. The head on this thing was miraculous! Had awesome retention and never showed signs of totally leaving. The body was a darkish, golden amber. Smell was of fruits and spices, with a tinge of hops in the end. Taste was similar, but not so strong on the fruits and hops. Had some spices there, but nothing too overbearing. Easily a drinkable beer. Definately something I'll have again. Ba Humbug(whatever a Humbug is) indeed."
"All in all okay and quite drinkable but I would have preferred a more bold approach. Just a tad below Fuller's or Young's standard Pale Ales but if it had been spiced more it would have stood out better."
"Good beer, but doesn't stand out for me."
"This is a tasty British ale that I will buy again. I can't help but notice that this is bottled in brown glass that protects the beer and not clear that does nothing to protect the beer."
"This would be an easy to drink session beer because the flavors are rather mello. Not a bad beer for this style but I would prefer something...bigger."
"This is just an all-around, easy drinking beer...nothing wrong with that."
"Very nice, thick looking brew, brownish amber color. The bottle I have is not clear as the picture shows, but dark brown (good!). My ""in a nutshell"" review is this is a very predictable English winter warmer. Thick and chewy malts dominate with subtle spices coming through as my beer warms up to room temperature. Reminds me of a winter-style Newcastle if such a thing existed. Certainly a good brew but absent of any aggressive/interesting hop profile I've grown to love in many of the US craft brew winter seasonals."
"Light/medium bodied with a spicy start giving way to a bready, nutty malt flavor before finishing with a bite of hops and more lingering spice and a hint of alcohol warmth. Mild and light bodied for a winter warmer, but at least not overly sweet."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Overall the mouthfeel is quite smooth, but gradually it turns watery and I don't quite like this fact against such a spicy flavour of this beer. Not too bad for a spiced winter beer, or rather it's different, but not sometthing I'd go for at normal price of 1.69 pounds per bottle!"
"(500 ml bottle.) Beautiful copper colour, nice thick head. Aroma and flavour of cinnamon, vanilla, caramel and toffee. Christmas cake notes in the flavour, some hoppy bitterness. Relatively light bodied despite the ""Christmasy"" elements, doesnÂ’t taste like 6% ABV. IÂ’m not too fond of the strong sweetish vanilla notes in the aroma, but this is a pleasant enough Christmas seasonal to drink. WouldnÂ’t care much for this as an all year beer, though - but it isnÂ’t. Cool label! Cheerio, Sophie meÂ’ lass!"
"A pretty good little warmer, warms your cockles on a cold winters night like this"
