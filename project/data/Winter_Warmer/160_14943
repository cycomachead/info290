Considering how muted and watery this beer is, I'd say that's probably likely, and I'd venture to guess somewhere around 15 months old; not good for a beer that's only 5% ABV. A shame I hadn't caught this before I bought it.","TheSixthRing","Jan 10, 2015"

The aroma is of roasted malts and spice. Bit more going on with the taste with some dark fruits, caramel, yeast and toffee in the mix as well. A slightly dry hoppy finish was noticed but didn't last too long at all. Winter Warmer style brews have been all over the board. Medium-bodied with good carbonation.","BeerWithMike","Dec 29, 2014"

Anyway, it's definitely a great looking beer with a pleasing scent of malts.  What I also enjoyed was the brew's smoothness - silkier than silk - and it helped mask the strong, almost too overpowering taste of the hops - a bit more bitter than I expected for an ale.

The flavour is balanced but mild, with a gentle brushing of fruity spice and a finish/aftertaste that really ties the profile together. Unfortunately, it's just too light to have the same complexity and rich, inviting features that my favourite warmers tend to have. A serviceable English-style ale for the autumn and winter months.","thehyperduck","Sep 25, 2013"

Some brown sugar and vanilla notes, but some bitterness in there as well. Dry finish. Medium body, soft carbonation that is suited to this beer.

It's all butterscotch and soft yeast in the nose, which all by itself is nice, but a kick of sovent alcohol takes the enjoyment down a little. The same applies to the taste; butterscoth and nutty flavors run around, but the alcohol isn't shy of showing itself.

Not sure what exactly I was expecting from this, but was pleasantly surprised from the get go. Poured into a traditional English pint glass. Pours a smooth, sandalwood color with a nice frothy head. The nose is sweet, candy-like, a bit of licorice and honey. The first sip is pleasingly sweet, too, with the same mix of licorice and honey, almost like a Bit-o-Honey candy. The finish is soft, smooth, and warming, which you would come to expect from any good winter ale. Definitely a beer you can sit an enjoy on a cold winter day, or with any hearty dinner (stew, potroast, etc). Coincidently, this was my first experience with a Wychwood beer.

Taste is mostly malty and a bit spicy with some figs and dark fruits but then gives way to a pleasant hop presence. Just before the finish there is a bit of alcohol and a somewhat faded spiciness that far outlasts the hops. As this beer warms and as i drink more of, I find a rather pleasant aftertaste that I can only describe as fig-like. Mouthfeel is ok, medium-light body that is somewhat slick and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is ok, I didn't enjoy this beer all that much at first but as this warmed a bit I really began to like this beer. The fruity characteristics of this beer really emerged as it warmed.

Some lacing, moderate carbonation, the smell is a bit musty, caramel, malty, candied liquorice. The consistency is surprisingly thin for a Xmas ale. In fact, this is more like a nut brown ale with a dash more caramel, but not what I would consider a Xmas ale given its thinness and lack of real spiciness. The taste, as mentioned, is British style nut brown with a slight twist. You'll get a combination of dryness, malty caramel, some spicy tang, and nut flavors on the front end. Towards the finish, the nut flavors round out even more and this is where the nut brown backbone to this beer comes through. There is a little bit more sweetish malts that emerge in the middle towards the finish as well. The beer is rather thin, with a light to medium consistency, and easily drinkable.

Is this a new trend, or just specific for this brew? Colours sort of a light, almost murky brown. Very little head to speak of. Just a light, perhaps 1/4 finger of foam was the best I could get. Smell was delightful. That almost signature British ale smell. Sweet malts, caramel and toffee, bit of figs, and some light cinnamon. Somewhat floral and earthy hops, with the emphasis slighty towards floral. Very balanced flavour. The sweet and bitterness intermingle. Just the right amount of malt, caramel and fig sweetness counterbalanced by a grassy, earthy bitterness. The two never overpower one another. And for the finish, a spicy, cinnamon bite. Quite a nice flavour. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light. It's by no means watery, but it's light. Very little carbonation that seems to give it almost a creamy, milky feel. The mouthfeel adds to the drinkability. Very good beer, with enough flavour to keep your tongue satisfied but not so much that it overwhelms the senses.

Theres a milkiness here, too, though, that settles into a banana smoothie essence as it warms. The more I go, the more of a banana cream pie I think Im consuming, a 150-degree change from the tease of the first aroma, and contrary altogether from the dark visual.

The head is a light tan, tall and thick, leaving gobs and sheets of lacing all over the sides of the glass. Retained well, with streams of carbonation surfacing from the bottom of my tulip throughout the pint. Absolutely gorgeous. Smell is a touch disappointing. Their very distinctive yeast strain comes through loud and clear, but the spices and maltiness suffer as a result. Still, cinnamon is obvious, along with bright caramel and a bit of butter. Dark fruits and boozy rum are minor notes, all good things, but a bit muddled and not as bold and distinct as they could be. Taste is better, spicy and inviting. Cinnamon is obvious, along with cloves and a bit of pepper. The fruits are missing in action, just a hint of raisin remaining, but the caramel is very assertive. Finishes rather hoppy, at least for a winter warmer. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, well carbonated, but it could really use more body to extend the finish and bring out some of the darker notes. Drinkability is good. Not bad at all, a solid offering from Wychwood, but I can't help but think that if they put as much effort into their beer as they do in their marketing they'd be world class.","Mandrake","0"

Fruitiness and a heavy roasted grain flavour is here and a touch of tartness up front, which gives way quickly to a low-intensity, but lasting bitter finish. This is neither dry nor sweet, but somewhere in the middle, not as refreshing as I find EPAs and bitters to usually be; it's a bit on the heavy side.

3.36,-3.4,4,3,3.5,4,3,"Glad to see Wychwood went with a brown bottle. Not nearly enough heft to qualify as a winter warmer, so I feel a bit cheated that the brewery is passing it off as such with a catchy label to capitalize on the holiday. A decent beer, if taken as an ESB. Lots of caramel malt, with hints of brown sugar. Smooth, with a clean finish.","Brent","Dec 25, 2005"

3.56,2.3,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Bah Humbug is definitely one of Wychwood's better offerings. Jacking up the malt and hops does not a winter warmer make, but it does result in a pretty good beer from a brewery that, in my experience, struggles to brew 'pretty good' beer. I'm on the fence with this one. Since today is Christmas, I'll be generous and give it a tentative thumbs up.","BuckeyeNation","Dec 21, 2005"
3.03,-12.9,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Overall Impression: The main flavor is fairly close to apple or pear, very fruity. Its very dry which helps drinkability. Everything seems on the edge of a flaw, but Im thinking maybe its just a style Im not used to. Its much better than the light struck mess I got with Scarecrow, but nothing to do back flips over. It has me thinking if I see a Scarecrow in a brown bottle, they might get another shot from me.","HardTarget","Dec 17, 2005"

The taste is slightly rich, again, with lots of caramel flavors but only a little hop to back it up. Also a small amount of spice and dark fruit flavor. The overall impression is basicaly sweet and malty. The mouthfeel is pretty good, with some decent body and carbonation to offset it. Unfortunately, the overall impession was not all that great. I would say it was too sweet for the lack of depth in the flavor. It was ok, but I doubt I'll go here next year.","zjungleist","Dec 11, 2005"
3.68,5.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"The beer pours a hazy reddish-amber in color with a thick creamy light tan head. Nice malty aroma with a hint of cinnamon, sweet caramel, raisin and a feint whiff of alcohol. Medium-to-full-bodied mouthfeel with pleasant carbonation. Very malty upfront. Dried fruit and spices emerge in the middle. Hint of raisin and vanilla in the finish. The 6.0% abv is masked pretty well. Nice offering from Wychwood and a very smooth winter warmer.","Winter","Dec 10, 2005"
3.75,7.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Nice to see Wychwood using brown bottles, spread the word to your British bretheren. Pours a dark rusty amber with a thumb of khaki bubbles. Nose is spicey and sweet, like a gingerbread cookie, a malty gingerbread cookie. Taste is dominated by a robust, but not overpowering winter warmer spice blend and sweet caramel/toffee malts. Mouthfeel is a little thin but lager slick, but what British beer that I've encountered hasn't? Overall a tasty and relatively easy-drinking winter warmer, but I couldn't have more than one.","Golden2wenty1","Dec 09, 2005"
4.3,23.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I poured this one into an over sized wine glass. the color was a nice brownish amber. The head was thin and tan with little lacing. The carbonation is nice. Had a malty smell with figs, brown sugar and mild spice. Great mouthfeel easy to drink, too easy. I love this beer, too bad its a winter seasonal. I would drink it all the time.","KALIKGOLD","Dec 06, 2005"
3.13,-10.1,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"Mid brown with a slight haze( bit light tan head though). Not much of a nose to speak of( some malt wafting around), this beer needs a turning up of the volume knob. The taste is malty and dryish on the finish but for a winter warmer I want more malt and more finish. The saving grace is that the balance is there and so is the framework of a good beer but like a radio with the sound turned down it is hard to really appreciate it.","canucklehead","Dec 04, 2005"
3.4,-2.3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Taste; mildly spiced and a malty, with just a little nut flavor. Theirs a little bit of a hop tang, but not very much. None of the flavors really stands out very much in this beer, but it idoes go down really easy. Overall I was expecting much more out of this "Winter Warmer".","RedHaze","Dec 03, 2005"
4,14.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice amber color with a sparse coating of head and a slight cloudyness. Nose is interesting. Buttery toffee, brown sugary, with a moderate fruityness. I think the diacetyl is working with this brew. Flavor is much more roasty and raisiney. Almost like some raisin bread. There is just a light touch of hoppy bitter on the finish. No spice. Feel is moderate with a light moderate carbonation. This is definately a nice brew. Everything works well together. I like this for a winter warmer. Might be the best from the brewery I have had.","kmpitz2","Dec 02, 2005"
3.63,4.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Hazed burnt sienna appearance, pale yellow frothed milk head of pretty decent staying power. Good interlocking laces on the glass. Aroma between apricot and medium-bitter marmalade. Carbonation is average, mouthfeel approaches this mark as well. Flavor is not bad, approachable, certainly skewed toward the malty side, a touch of a candied fruit tone with a darker more molasses and hot nutmeg backdrop and finish. Could use a bit more solidity in the overall body, but its a drinkable enough brew and one of the better Wychwood bottled beers to my mind.","ADR","Dec 02, 2005"

3.46,-0.6,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"The color is somewhere between copper and amber. The creamy head is light brown and on the small side. Aroma is faint with a vague molasses-like malt smell. A sip begins with a sweet, bready malt flavor that has of touch of butteriness. So far this tastes a little bit like Fat Tire. Midway through a molasses flavor joins the mix alongside a moderate amount of alcohol. This taste carries through to the finish and is capped with a burst of dry hop flavor. Overall, the flavor is very good, but I expect something bigger and more interesting from a winter warmer.","Gagnonsux","Nov 29, 2005"

Had awesome retention and never showed signs of totally leaving. The body was a darkish, golden amber. Smell was of fruits and spices, with a tinge of hops in the end. Taste was similar, but not so strong on the fruits and hops. Had some spices there, but nothing too overbearing. Easily a drinkable beer. Definately something I'll have again.

My "in a nutshell" review is this is a very predictable English winter warmer. Thick and chewy malts dominate with subtle spices coming through as my beer warms up to room temperature. Reminds me of a winter-style Newcastle if such a thing existed. Certainly a good brew but absent of any aggressive/interesting hop profile I've grown to love in many of the US craft brew winter seasonals.","Gruntlumber","Jul 15, 2005"
3.25,-6.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,"Light/medium bodied with a spicy start giving way to a bready, nutty malt flavor before finishing with a bite of hops and more lingering spice and a hint of alcohol warmth.

Christmas cake notes in the flavour, some hoppy bitterness. Relatively light bodied despite the "Christmasy" elements, doesnt taste like 6% ABV. Im not too fond of the strong sweetish vanilla notes in the aroma, but this is a pleasant enough Christmas seasonal to drink. Wouldnt care much for this as an all year beer, though - but it isnt.
