"22 ounce bottle into snifter; 2012 vintage, bottled on 8/28/2012. Pours fairly clear reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, pear, vanilla, oak, clove, bourbon, floral, grass, slight pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt, bourbon barrel, and light-moderate hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, pear, vanilla, oak, clove, bourbon, floral, grass, slight pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, vanilla, oak, clove, bourbon, floral, grass, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and moderate robustness of dark malt, bourbon barrel, and light-moderate hop flavors; with a nice malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice barrel aged strong ale. Good balance and complexity of malt, barrel, and light-moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"This is one of the few times I'm going to agree with the rating as spot on. About an 80% overall score for this one. I've had my fair share of bourbon aged beers and this falls short in so many ways. First of all it's not a stout so don't expect one. It pour s a medium transparent brown color not a lot of carbonation in the liquid nor head on top. Sweet bouquet where I pick up some notes of oats and barley. The initial sip is watery. Doesn't seem like a 9%+ abv beer. Not much flavor lingers on the tounge and almost no taste of bourbon. All hype and no deliver. Too much bark and not enough bite for this beer. Seems like I paid $13 simply for the wax they put on the top of the bottle."

"High C"

"I have to say the 11 was the hit of the tasting and the creamy mouthfeel with the big body and killer finish made for a great sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Didn't love the feel all too much but aside from that it could be worse. Bourbon seems to disagree with the other flavors."

"The sturdy malt backbone in this medium-bodied beer seems to have been thinned slightly by alcohol. Carbonation is still light but enough to support, but the transition from crisp in the front to smoother in the middle isn't as good. The finish does remain dry."

"Not as Bourbon as last year. A touch diacetyl/buttery, but that is interesting note with oak. A bit more CO2 or hops or hot alcohol might add a needed counterpoint... it's all bourbon and oak and limited bubbles. A darn good beer, a bit south of great."
"Atmosphere is okay. No real head or lacing. Nose is sweet and boozy. Light flavor in general, except for some bitterness and booze. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not bad, nothing too special but decent overall, nice bourbon characters although not great, nice barrel characers, decent malts and hops, hint of baking spices, booze is just enough to bring some character without being too much."
""
"I would try it again if handed to me but I see bourbon barrel aged beers as an experience and there are far better experiences out there."

"Overall - Not bad, just dull. No real barrel character to it."
""
""
""
"A thicker body and more age might do this some good. nice aroma and flavor from bourbon barrels. but light on the beer part makes this a thin watery bourbon flavored beverage."
""
""
"Surprised at some of the lower scores on this one. Maybe the aging helped this one immensely, but I can definitely say this was one of the better beers I've had in a while. Kicking myself for not having cellared several more bottles of this."
""
""
"I'm taken back to my days of a bourbon aficionado, when I drank too much whisky and coke. This beer tastes as close to whisky and coke as I could possible imagine. I love whisky and coke! Never saw this coming. How did they do it? A whole new category of beer. Try it, at least for the sake of sampling a one of a kind beer!!"

"Overall - a fine sipper for the last few weeks of winter '13, it aged nicely."
""
""
""
"Overall - Call me unimpressed. Truly tastes like bourbon that's been cut with water. That's it. Really nothing else to it. Definitely a beer that won't be on my future want list."

"Taste is rich and sweetly malty, but I don't get much of the vanilla-like bourbon tones. The finish does showcase the warm whiskey character, though. Comparable to Alltech Brewing's Bourbon Barrel Ale, this one's not bad, though perhaps a tad high on the price ($14.99/bomber)."

"O- not bad, but disappointing for a bourbon aged."
""
""
""

"O. Very nice, smooth beer. For a winter warmer, it's a very nice offering."
""
""
""
""

"I drank the whole thing myself over a few hours. A fairly nice accompaniment for a cold night."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. 2012 vintage. Off-white head, moderate retention on a slightly hazy, copper body. Clear and soapy, sticky lacing. Aroma includes (suprisingly) earthy piney hops with some citrus. Slight vanilla, caramel malts and marmalade. Taste is again dominated by earthy hops and bitterness, some caramel malts again and vanilla sweetness. Not at all what I expected, very drinkable for the abv and quite tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a reddish, orangey brown color. Looks like your typical ale. A good amount of lacing boils up and subsides after a moment. Fairly sticky lacing rings the glass. A deep whiff earns me the scent of apples, but is a bit muted. I wonder what else is in there. A quaff reveals the flavor of apples, toffee, dark fruits, malts, vanilla, and cream. A little smokey. Overall, an enjoyable arrangement of flavors. Mouthfeel is dry and light, and the flavor radiates well. I wouldn't mind revisiting this one in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Quite disappointed. Was expecting much better, especially for the price."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy orange-tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, wood, and slight bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild alcohol kick and a woody finish. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is a decent example of barrel aging."
""
"Overall: Reading through the reviews, I wonder whether the recipe may have changed here as I found this beer to be extremely well-balanced, with a very deft handling of the Bourbon in a way that really complements the base beer"
""
""
"O - a good brew. I'd like to try it on tap."
"overall, i really like this. i like this 'alternate' version of the previous brrr i tasted and the bourbon barrel flavor goes hand in hand with the hops and 'pine'. this really is a great brew. however, i am not sure we are all reviwing the same beer, are we? my bottle says '12 and yet the reviews go all the way back to 2010. this appears to be an annual product and i noticed there was an '11 version also. the brewery's website even advertises the '11, but not the '12.... confusion, but who cares? darn fine product in my hands. and since i still dont know if aliens exist, i suppose i can live without knowing whether this review should be for a '12 . . . . but i gave the taste part a 5. this is an awesome job of producing beer. 9.4%....even..."
""
"Two finger off white head on a hazy amber orange body. Excellent retention and nice lacing. Flavors of vanilla, toasted malts, brown sugar, spices, bourbon, caramel and hints of toffee. Aroma hides under the thick head ad is mostly of candy sugar, dark fruits, orange peel and caramel. Medium body and moderate carbonation. A little oily on the palate. A lot of flavors in this one but for me they do tall come together in the end to form a memorable or great beer."
""
"O: this I a nice beer for a cold night... Very nice notes from the barrels, though they are not wet burbon notes, wich aloes tem to just add some nice barrel flavors to a tasty malt backbone... Nice."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"Overall: A beastly beer, I am not crazy to begin with on the bourbon or oaked aged beers but this one is a gem. I know there are different versions that might not live up to the expectations of this one aged two years just right did it for me. I have had this bottle for about a year and thought it was time. Enjoy and drink up....Salud!"
"It's not hot like a bourbon but if you don't like bourbon or whiskey you probably won't like this but I highly recommend it as one of my favorites from Widmer where I think the SXNW and the Pitch Black and the Falconer IPA are spectacular."
""
"Overall, this is good fare, but not quite what I was expecting. The beer comes across well at first, but the bourbon notes, even though they’re somewhat watery, tend to dominate later mouthfuls, and the beer wants for a better malt base to help sustain the fruit and sugar notes. There’s also a slightly-too-large remnant of whiskey-like alcohol about the edges, and even more noticeable in the aftertaste, the malts not quite capable of hiding the higher ABV. The ultimate effect is that, despite the high ABV, this comes across as a mid-grade ale that was barrel aged for better flavor."
""
""
""
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nice barrel character balanced nicely by the big winter warmer."
"The look is a light brown with nice head. The body is medium and the flavor of bourbon is evident. This is a nice, smooth, enjoyable brew. Whether or not the time in the cellar helped or hindered isn't really an issue with the beer because the characters of the beer are in good shape."
"D: Definitely a sipper, not a chugger. The alcohol is very apparent (probably because of the bourbon smell), so this lends its self to slow enjoyment."
""
""
""
"3.5 D: I haven't had this fresh, so I can't comment on how it's aged, but it's tasty in its current state. Well balanced with a decent amount of depth."

"(originally reviewed: 10-31-2011)"
""
"D - Good one to try."
""
"Decent amount of carbonation in this one with a full body. I get a bit of alcohol burn on the first sip, but it's replaced with a menagerie of flavors that just overwhelm the palate and make you forget that it's slightly syrupy. Overall, not a bad effort."
"This beer has become entirely balanced. Nothing sharp about it."
"Kind of strange, i don't think it really works bourbon aging this beer."
""
"Eh, I keep giving them chances, and I keep trying them out, and, dammit, I keep spending my money on them, but I'm starting to wise up."
""
""
"Looks nice on the pour. Feels extremely silly and smooth. Flavor profile is nice and smooth. Mild hop spice tones. Lots of malts. I'm getting a bit of a vanilla tone here too. Overall, this is a very smooth beer. I get no boozy tones, and I'm pretty sure it's close to 10% on the abv, from what I recall when I saw the bottle. A nice easy drinker. Pleasant."
"Overall (3.0): A drinkable beer, that I would enjoy at someone else's expense again, but probably won't spend $11 on again myself. I had been considering putting a few of these in the cellar to see how they age, but after trying it, decided against it. I think my money will be better spent on other offerings in this category. Still, a palatable brew that gets the job done."
""
"O: A touch of spice, but loads more fruit and oversweet molasses malt. I didn't think it was great; the bourbon was heavy-handed, but whatever. I wouldn't recommend it. I won't have again."
""
""
""
"O- Oh well, I guess everything that comes out of the cellar can't be an over the top winner. Not bad, but I almost remember liking this one better fresh. I shoulda drank this one by the fire place this winter instead of waiting until spring... oh well! A touch too much bourbon, but decently drinkable."
""
""
"Low B-"

""
""
"The '11 edition, bottled Aug 12 (20)11. I'd have to say it's overpriced at $15."
"Overall: It's what I expected. Pretty good. It's great to pair with a cigar. I would love to get it solely for that purpose. Not for the $15 price tag I see everywhere though. I would struggle to spend $9 on it but that seems more reasonable. Good, but overpriced. I would suggest trying it once if you have some extra money in the winter when it comes out."
""
""
"Overall - not a bad brew in general, but very odd-tasting. My guess is people will probably love it or hate it."
"Pours a hazy amber color with a small white head. In the aroma, dark fruit and a small alcohol. In the taste, oaky bourbon and a dark fruitiness. A small fruit bite and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry oak and bourbon like aftertaste. A nice bourbon presence in a barleywine, but just about average."
"Overall: Complex though a bit too smokey and burnt. In all honesty this has probably just aged a bit too long, which makes sense given that it's a shade under 10%... I so wanted this beer to be excellent, but sadly it disappoints"
""
"O – Huge bourbon punch both a plus and a minus. At times this tastes like decent bourbon that someone just poured some beer into. Overall, everything doesn’t really come together very well. A solid idea, but probably could have been better executed. My bet is that this beer is a little young. Would like to taste this once it has had a chance to age and mellow and lose some heat."
""
"Overall: It's ultimately just OK, I certainly don't feel as though I got my thirteen bucks' worth with this one."
"Overall - Some will be not like the sweetness due to the bourbon present. Otherwise, this is a great bourbon style ale that offers something unique and enjoyable to those looking for something a little different."
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is not a bad beer but definitely not worthy of the price. 3.5"
""
"Overall: A decent barrel aged Strong Ale, though a bit inexpressive."
"Poured from 22oz bomber dated 10/2010 to pint glass. The beer pours a deep ruby copper color with a two finger lighter tan colored head. Good retention and lacing throughout. I am enjoying this aroma: nice blend of vanilla, caramel, oak, figs, and a hint of bourbon. The flavor very much follows suit though the bourbon is a bit more pronounced on the tongue. The vanilla, caramel, and fig flavors blend well with a medium bitterness. Coats your palette. Medium bodied and adequately carbonation. Overall, I enjoyed this beer. Aging seemed to mellow the bourbon flavors but not as much as I anticipated. A brew I look forward to every year :)"
"DOA"

"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a medium red-orange amber, thin head dissipates quickly, minimal lacing. Aroma dominated by bourbon with sweet malt. Taste follows, with bourbon dominating, decent wood notes, vanilla and faint hops. Light to medium bodied. The bourbon is nice, but the elements aren't that well integrated. The vanilla leaves a slightly diacetyl taste. Overall a satisfactory, but not noteworthy effort."
""
""
""
"There is hardly any carbonation and it very drinkable. Was so glad to see this again for 2011. It is just one of those winter seasonals I don't mind paying for. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
"A great beer drank at the perfect time of year for it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Now I know why this one hasn't moved off the shelves. Very disappointing. Everything seems off."
""
"Final thought - $13 and only 9.4%. Way to high of a price for a beer that is just OK. I would get one a year if it was half the price"
""
""
""
""
"Poured a translucent brownish orange, with about a finger of white head. A bit of lace and a film of retention. Nose has some orangey hop notes that are a bit resinous, a touch of oak, vanilla and only a slight suggestion of bourbon. Taste has quite a bit of the same, orangey-like hop notes (which, as I move through the bottle, come across as more and more artificial), with lots of oak, butterscotch - almost along the lines of an Innis & Gunn. Some bourbon flavour, without any bourbon burn. A hint of spice, bitter in the finish with a dash of alcohol. Heavy medium body and carbonation is quite low, slightly more drinkable than some pure 'sippers' out there. Too sweet for my liking though, and lacks any real complexity to make this stand out. Despite the nice looking bottle and packaging, this was certainly not worth the $14 I dropped on this. 22oz ended up being too much, half of this was disposed of."
""
"Overall not a bad beer if you like bourbon but otherwise not much to like."
""
"22 ounce bottle, Fall 2010 (stamp on bottle says October 2010) vintage. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/copper color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is a bit boozy, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, coconut, caramel malt and some dark fruit. It tastes like bourbon, vanilla, caramel malt, coconut, and a little bit of sweet spices and dark fruit. But the bourbon flavor in this brew is stronger compared to the other ones. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's coating, smooth, and has moderate carbonation. Aging this brew for a little more than a year certainly hasn't hurt it. I thought it was good, now I might have to buy a bottle of the 2011 version to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is ok. I really enjoyed Brrr, but this treatment of that beer doesn't work all that well. I guess it's something to try once, but not something I'd like to revist."
"I had such high hopes for this beer."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a goblet, bottled in Oct 2010. This pours a hazy tea color with a very small short lived bad. The smells are of toffee and caramel malts with a little bourbon. Feel is medium to thick with a little extra carbonation. The taste is pretty good, more bourbon taste than I expected with the smell, along with the load of malts, pretty great stuff."
""
"Strong aroma has a decided overtone of bourbon-soaked wood, as well as fruity and malty tones. It pours a beautiful clear golden amber with a decent light golden tan head. Flavor has a strong woody bourbon overtone, which dominates the flavor but still lets through malt and apple/pear notes, plus just a hint of caramel. Smooth texture has slightly above average body and quite a bit of fizz, leaving a tingly, woody finish. This is a bold beer for bold people."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Quite an interesting take on a winter warmer. Oak and vanilla flavors are nice. Could of been a little more full bodied."
"Poured a clear lighter shade of amber with a thin layer of tan foam that receded quickly and didn't leave much if any lacing. Smell was light elements of bourbon wood- vanilla and cherries and a bit of alcohol. Taste was quite the same with vanilla and cherry elements, mild maltiness reminds on this is a beer and not the leftover watery remnants of an inexpensive Kentucky bourbon on the rocks.. Mouthfeel was medium and held together okay however my overall impression was as somebody else mentioned 'bland'. There is just enough of an initial hint of bourbon elements to get a person excited...but like that...it's gone."
""
""
"Final Notes: Just doesn't live up to the intense brew that a good winter warmer should. It has the ABV but not the bold, assertive flavors to back it up. Quite enjoyable otherwise. Not worth the hefty price tag, but you might want to check it out if you're a fan of bourbon."
""
""
"Overall, the bourbon was spot on in this one & for its price and availability - you need to get some. Was $13 at the bar, but I had seen it for $10 at bottle shops. Solid price @ both places!"
""
"o - Overall a decent beer, but a bit too strong for me. I think with some time on it it could be a lot better, and would age it if I had it in a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Really not a bad beer, but it does seem to miss the mark with regard to the middle--the beer could use a stronger grain presence. I really do enjoy the intense bourbon flavors though, so this some what makes up for the lack of body."
"2011 vintage sampled at a group tasting of several new releases. Pours a pretty orange-tan color with just a hint of a creamy white head. Aroma is big on the bourbon, with strong notes of wood, vanilla, and a spicy note of caraway or anise. Palate is rich and sweet, with a lightly fruit hop profile mingling with the assertive malts and the strong bourbon edge, leading up to a very warm finish. This is a very nice beer right now, but I think a few months of aging will round out the edges and make this an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a slightly hazy dark amber color. Minimal head, with little retention. I really couldn't get any aroma off of this beer. Good malt taste with caramel and allspice. Unfortunately the flavor gets milder and milder over just a few sips - so it began to lose me a bit. There's a bit of bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall it is a very smooth beer. It is medium-bodied, with light (yet very prickly!) carbonation. An enjoyable and mild (in a good way) barrel-aged winter warme."
""
"Overall all i'd have to say it a decent beer, but not worth the $12.99."
"Opinion: Very nice smooth beer. Not to strong of flavors but a nice balance of an aged winter warmer and bourbon. Nice beer for a relaxing evening"
"Overall an OK beer. I would buy again if it were $5 a bottle or less and I wanted a cheap bourbon barrel beer."
"O - This is decent and has potential but just not quite on the mark."
"Overall: I'm missing the flavor and body of the beers I usually drink. The beer doesn't have any objectionable characteristics but it faults are ""sins of omission"". My tastes gravitate to upfront flavorful beers. I just find this one lacking."
"Overall rather enjoyable take on a winter warmer and a nice break from the giant barrel aged stout beers. I would have this again anytime, real nice nose on this too."
"overall, a solid barrel-aged winter warmer. not an eye-opener but enough there to enjoy on those frosty nights. still, won't kill myself for a revisit."
"Pours a dark amber color w/ a thin sliver of an off white head. Moderate carbonation and lacing on my snifter glass. Beer appears clear, and somewhat easy to see through in spite of the color. The nose is mainly bourbon, oak, vanilla. A little on the simplistic, non-complex side, and a little thin. Taste is a little better, but not great. A little boozy, w/ vanilla and oak coming through as well. Mouthfeel is thin and syrupy. Overall, this beer is a bit of a mess. I probably won't pick this up again."
"Overall a very good beer, but not one that I will be buying regularly or even ordering on tap if there are other interesting selections. I do like the effort here though."
"I'm a bit disappointed, the scent really implied that this beer had potential. I personally, however am not a big fan."
"Feel like this beer misses the mark. There might have been a really nice palate here but it's just gone missing, and you're left with little more than warm booze notes and some sweetness around the edge."
"Drinkability suffers because of the heat, and the lack of complexities and characters to make it really worthwhile. I love bourbon oak in things, but maybe this beer is telling me that I just really like the base beer in others."
"O - This is a really tasty barrel aged winter warmer. I liked the regular version of Brrr, but this is even better."
"D - very smooth and surprisingly light; overall very drinkable"
"Mouthfeel - Rather crisp and snappy for a winter warmer. Little too light for the style."
"Opinion: I have been pretty happy with this beer. For a Winter Warmer, it is pretty darn good...and definitely warming. There are some mouthfeel things about this beer that I would like to modify, but that is just tweaking. Even as a low carbonated beer, it comes across well, and I wouldn't mind drinking this beer again. I look forward to finishing this beer, but it will most certainly ""put me to bed"" tonight."
"D: Not a terrible brew, but not very impressive. Nice balance between the bourbon and the winter warmer, but the body overall was a bit watery, and the overall flavor was too simple for my taste."
"the aroma was boozy, with lots of peat and smoked malts that really filled the air. hints of molasses, chocolate, rich caramel and dark fruits all make their presence known. with the thickness of a milkshake the first sips slide over the palate doing their best to coat it so fully you do not even know where to start. just tremendous in every aspect. rich smoked malts and sweet flavors finish the job with a kick of smooth boozy oak and bourbon to round it out."
"Since I love the Widmer Brr winter release, I figured my love would follow to their Brrbon. It looked and smelled fantastic... but it must be that I am not a big hard alcohol fan that all I could taste was the Burbon... Couldn't even taaste the Brrr beer... I am glad I only paid a few bucks for a glass vs the cost of the bottle."
"Overall: this is the first Bourbon Barrel Aged beer thst I have had that was not a stout and I like this better than most of them."
"This beer poured out as a nice looking amberish brown color. The head was an off white and looked pretty nice for the most part. The lacing didn't exist. The smell was a little sweet and had a touch of booze on the nose. The taste was nice, it had some good bourbon flavors in there. The mouthfeel wasn't too bad smooth and carbonated. Overall It was a pretty tasty brew."
"O: A miss. Wanted more bourbon, less winter warmer. With that said, it's a damn good winter warmer considering this is easily one of my least favorite styles."
"I'd like to definitely give this another run. maybe pair this bad boy with some fish tacos, or jamaican jerk chicken."
"The second drain pour I have ever had to do, and documented because even the cellaring mistakes are important to learn from (and not repeat)"
"Bottle: Poured a clear amber color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of bourbon is quite powerful with notes of sweet malt. Taste is also dominated by lots of vanilla notes from the bourbon barrel with a balanced sweet malt notes. Body is about average with good carbonation and light apparent alcohol notes. Interesting though not properly balanced with too much bourbon."
"O- I'm not a huge whisky guy but this is delicious. I'm drinking this on June 1st and I'm visualizing myself sipping this near a fireplace on a cold night. The ABV may warm you up on a chilly night while camping. I'll be looking for this again when available."
"O: Super tame but what's there is good."
"O: The flavor that is there is tasty, but it isn't very bold. I like what's there, buuut...."
"Medium amber color. Hints of Vanilla, malt, and bourbon. Bourbon bomb. I love bourbon forward beers, but there is so much bourbon that theres not room for much else. Some malt, maybe a hint of vanilla and citrus. Carbonated, light mouthfeel. Good, but not up to the pre drink expectations I had on it. Might still get another bottle to age, but then again...maybe not."
"P.S. Marinated a brisket with this beer and it is wonderful. In a different category this beer would be all 4.5s."
"This has a great aroma and a nice taste. It has that bourbon sweetness."
"O- This beer was average at best with the flavor profile I had. It could be it needs to lay for a bit but I thought the bourbon was a bit too much. The other flavors never had a chance to shine which was my only problem with this beer."
"O: It's OK. Flavor is actually good, but it loses points on everything."
"O- Overall an okay beer, but probably not worth going crazy to seek out. Either way, I enjoyed it... more so on the second glass."
"O - An average beer. The bourbon seems unbalanced and not profiled effectively. Not a bad drinker but I wouldn't look for this again."
"O: Very good winter ale. Bourbon improves it. I would drink this again."
"I feel like I would have enjoyed this a lot more on a cold winter night than on a balmy spring one. Not bad by any means, but not particularly spectacular either. Overall, it's worth giving a shot."
"O: Unimaginative, this beer doesn't really boast anything impressive. All in all its above average but it seems to be little more than sweet buttery malts and bourbon."
"If you buy this, you should age it at least 6 months to allow the bourbon flavors to mellow out. It's strong but it won't kill your taste buds after a month or two. Unfortunately, it's a pretty shallow beer that only exists to showcase bourbon barrel aging and nothing more."
"An aggressive bourbon barrel aged beer that is akin to Lexington's Bourbon Barrel Ale. Where BA Brrrbon has a more heafty malt base, the bourbon character lacks in taste but makes it boozy- more than it needs to be."
"The barrel elements- oak, vanilla, bourbon- are rather restrained in the nose. Vaguely fruity and hoppy. I taste some of the prickly hoppiness of Regular Brrr, but it's somewhat neutered. I'm not sure the base beer has the malt profile to hold up to barrel-aging. The body seems on the thin side, the bourbon is so subtle as to not add much to the equation, and the barrel notes are more raw wood than buttery/oak/vanilla. A decent beer for sure, but something seems to be lacking. Regular Brrr is certainly superior."
"Medium sticky body on this with soft carbonation. Overall, this was a bit of a let down. I didn't care for it. I wonder how the regular version is though."
"O: This is a good choice if you are looking for a beer that has bourbon flavors but isn't very overpowering."
"Ultra-clear, deep copper in color, with a very slim head, this beer has a boozy, malty aroma. Some woody, smoky aroma, but very distant. Vinous, semi-sweet, warming, and malty. The beer has a distinct vanilla flavor. Mouth-filling, smooth, and very enjoyable. This is surely a sipping beer. Solid bitterness, but hop-restrained. The beer becomes more enjoyable and intriguing throughout the bottle. Very good."
"It's a pretty nice strong, bourbon barrel-aged ale, but the price ($12.95) is out of whack. Would the rating be higher if it were $9.95? No, but it would have been a far more reasonable value."
"Overall this was an enjoyable beer, I enjoyed drinking it but it had no complexity whatsoever, just bourbon. It was worth trying but for how much it costs it really wasn't worth it for what I got."
"O - When I go to review this beer, I find myself nitpicking and finding reasons not to give it an ""excellent"" review, but I like it enough to have bought numerous $10-12 bottles throughout the last 6 months and recommend it to many friends. I really love the bourbon taste in this beer and the overall package."
"Drinks easy for the ABV, a nice take on the style. Not the best barrel aged beer I've had in a while, I would certainly buy this again if the price is right"
"D: Needs plenty of time in the bottle. They shouldn't have released this yet. Too young."
"Overall - Enjoyable. In the line up of bourbon barrel aged beers, this is on the lighter side. An easy drinker that, with it's moderate ABV, is worth enjoying."
"Drinkability: I think that the Brrbon is fairly drinkable. I think the drink is a little unbalanced with the bourbon taking over too much of the taste. However, I would not say the beer is undrinkable but the bourbon makes it harder to finish the bottle because of the strong bourbon taste. Otherwise, I thin it is a fairly okay drink for a cold winter day."
"This beer is pretty good. I thought it was going to be a dark beer for some reason. I am curious if they were using Alagash Curieux as their inspiration because I can see some similarities. Good beer and since it is a limited release you should pick one up an try it soon before its gone."
"Cheers..."
"Some have suggested this might be better aged longer. That might be so. But I don't see me looking for a second bottle to find out."
"I really feel bad because I had higher expectations for this beer and the taste is like a watered down glass of oak, bourbon, and light caramel. For what I paid for the bottle, I'll have to finish this one. Widmer Brothers, no offense with this review, I'm going to give this one another go around on the next batch because I really enjoy bourbon beers. This one just 'ain't doin' it for me. (sorry to say)"
"Overall it's very drinkable for the abv, but not that enjoyable."
"Brrrbon is amazing. This is why I love barrel age beer and think bourbon barrels are probably my favorite after having tried a variety. I am not a bourbon drinker but something about the way the flavor of the spirit compliments the flavor profile of the imperial red brrr really hits the spot. The nose and the first sip of the beer are the absolute best because your pallet is overwhelmed with all of the flavors. A little pricey but anytime you age something that'll run up the cost. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel-Medium carbonation delivers a quick hoppy bitterness.This is immediately overcome by the sweet malt and it transitions to a wonderful bourbon flavor. There is a bitterness that lingers in the back on the finish, but I am left with a sweet lower-proof bourbon flavor. A froth on the palate gets the alcohol warmed up and some mild oaky barrel flavors emerge. If you can envision a pefect combo of a beer mixed with bourbon this ale hits the spot. I like the subtle oak flavors and the sweet bourbon flavors are pleasing to me. I am big bourbon fan so this was a great brew to try. Cheers to Widmer Brothers on this special release."
"D - Easily drinkable, just really not worth seeking out. Or paying MSRP, either, if you will."
"CONCLUSION: This is truly the most unique bourbon barrel-aged beer I've tried. But in short, if you like bourbon, just go buy some actual bourbon because it'll be cheaper than the Barrel Aged Brrrbon and probably taste better. This just tastes like bad bourbon and even worse beer. It is totally undrinkable unless you are bourbon fiend. Balance is just non-existant. Glad I tried it, but never again."

"Feels crisp and clean in the mouth. An easy drinker. Despite the 9+% ABV, it would be easy to have more than one. The alcohol sneaks up on you."
"Overall drinkability is good, but I'm left feeling a little empty, because the base beer (winter warmer) doesn't really show up here."
"Pours a moderate brown color with a thin tan head and not much in the way of retention of lacing. Thin collar as the head falls. The nose definitely packs in the brrrbon, but that's unfortunately about it. There's some slight malt character in the background, but nothing all that complex about this. The taste is comprised mostly of brrrbon along with some sweetened malt and perhaps a touch of dark fruits. Mouthfeel is a bit boozy and medium. Drinkability is decent, though there's really nothing at all special about this."
"If it weren't so damned expensive, I'd buy up the stock in the area. But it was on tap, which made it much more attractive to me."
"The brothers are continuing their quest with this reserve series. Tawny clarity, a beautiful head rests on top. Oak and alcohol are the first to the nostrils with clean solvent, trace vanilla and toasted wood. Full-bodied slickness. Barrel flavor has a slight chokehold on this beer, tasting a whole lot of wood; toasted, watered-down bourbon to faint vanilla and a dry pull on the palate. Modest hop profile, and the maltiness is quite dry. Expected more of an alcohol presence between the barrel and higher alcohol. Mellow up front but warming in the back. A bit more malt to back up the barrel flavors would have worked. Wood seems to take over."
"Widmer Barrel Aged Brrrbon is a classic example of the adage that it's best not to mess with success. I'm sure the brewery's goal was to improve upon an already good beer. Sorry, but mission *not* accomplished."
"The brew is similar from the preceding offering but the barrel blending has improved, nothing extraordinary but the 11 vintage would deserve an overall 4 grade, and would be a fair candidate for aging."
"Enjoy."
"The beer has potential but not worth the $10 price tag for a bomber. Would like to see this one revisited but beef up the base beer first."
"I've ahad a couple brews already, so my review may not be complete, but I know this is a top quality beer."
"D: drinkable, nothing offensive or off-flavored, just lacks character"
"Taste is syrupy sweet to start, a peek of fruit/tart in the middle, and then vanilla, alcohol, and a lingering coconut close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is easy, especially for the abv. Nice brew, even though I'm not the biggest coconut flavor fan."
"D - Great to try not to buy it was great to have a bourbon aged beer not a whiskey bomb but clocking in at 16.99 I didn't even dare to consider buying a bottle, but you pay for the process so its high for a reason. Would be better if the price was a solid 10 then I would have got it for sure."
"Bottle at the December Santa Cruz tasting. Pours dark brown with a khaki head. Strong bourbony aroma with a watery caramel bourbon flavor. Very thin and quite the letdown after the adequate aroma. Candied, sweet, boozy, thin, with a short finish. Not impressed."
"Little to no carbonation in the feel, and I honestly am having trouble finishing this bottle. "
"As the bartender slid the snifter glass across the bar I was to say the least a little excited. Held up against the light, a very nice briliant amber and small creamy head. So far so good. But then to the nose and I was taken aback. The smooth bourbon and oak notes are intoxicating. Then to the taste and my mind swirled. So balanced, so smooth, so easy to drink. Every sip was wonderful and it wasnt until I got outside into the fresh air did I feel the alcohal. Best beer I have tried in along time. I bought a bomber to cellar, but I dont know if that plan will work out as every time I see the bottle on the shelf I want to crack it and experiance that again."
"Pours an off-white, one-finger head that fades quickly leaving traces of lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Bourbon nose, flavor is bourbon, vanilla and hints of sweet caramel, higher ABV is hidden. Expensive at $13.00 for a 22oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"D - This beer was pretty bad, hard to drink, and I would not drink it again."
"M - Slightly oily with just under a medium body and mild carbonation."
"22oz bomber into a tulip glass pours a crisp copper with a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a nice amount of Bourbon in front of caramel malts and mild spice. The taste is a nice smooth blend of caramel malts, Bourbon, oak, vanilla and cinnamon. The beer is medium bodied with mild alcohol, but it's still quite smooth. This is a very enjoyable Bourbon aged beer, I plan on aging the bottle I have at home."
"The bourbon flavor was a little subtler than expected with almost no alcohol burn. This drank quite easily and was pleasant enough, but it didn't really attain memorable ""big bourbon beer"" status."
"I liked but couldn't buy that one yet, maybe with time it will improve, but a tap is supposed to be the top taste right?"
"This beer pours a hazy brown color with two fingers of foamy off white head. The smell is strong with hops and a hint of bourbon from the barrels the beer is aged in. The taste starts with some malty sweetness and then hits you with hoppy bitterness. The taste finishes with that hint of bourbon, but is not very overpowering like some other bourbon barrel aged beers. The high alcohol content is obvious within the taste which is the only big detractor. The mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth, although you are left with some bitter aftertaste."
"I thought it went down pretty easy and both of us like it. I wish I would have bought a few more and the price is right at $12.95."
"O - For the price, there are many, many beers that are better than this one."
"Pours a slightly hazy surprisingly light rosy golden amber color with a shallow wispy fizzy white head that's gone in a flash leaving little Belgian lacing at all. Microscopic effervescence is unable to sustain a collar, but suggests a reasonable carbonation will follow. The nose is REALLY timid until it warms up..then it's all about the vanilla creme brulee. The taste is BIG on the sweet vanilla character of the Bourbon treatment..a little caramel creme brulee thing going on. The mouth feel is tangy and creamy all at once and it compliments the flavor nicely...it has a sturdy medium weight to the body. It finishes on the dry side with a meager lingering aftertaste. Quite the reasonable drinker for one up at 9.4%. I would definitely pick this one up again if it was on the shelves...but I'm a sucker for Bourbon treatments."
"Pours a dark orange colour with small white head. Lack of lacing on the glass, poor head retention. Smells like oranges, bourbon and vanilla. Flavour is quite boozy. Not very carbonated. My review may make it sound more negative than I thought about the beer, I did enjoy this one enough. One of the better Widmer beers I've had."
"Although I initially balked at buying this one due to the perceived price/quality ratio, I relented the other day because I had a gift card I received for Christmas, and the curiosity was killing me. That said, I enjoyed the beer, but was hardly blown away. Poured a hazy dark orange color with a finger of dense yellowish head. Aromas of bourbon, light floral hops and a hint of caramel. Medium bodied, with flavors of bourbon, oak and caramel. An enjoyable beer to be certain, but not worth the $12 asking price."
"Notes - It may have been unfair of me to review this beer since I'm not a fan of bourbon (I prefer Irish whiskey). It's a bit impressive how much bourbon character they managed to impart; I was expecting it to be more subtle. I remember Brrr as being pretty hoppy so I was expecting more hop presence, but I guess the aging process killed it. I would recommend this beer to a bourbon lover, but others should probably pass."
"Thank you widmer."
"This lost a few points because anyone can just put beer in bourbon barrels, provided they have the funds to do so, and the rest of the beer's character isn't showing through much. Don't get me wrong, I can't say I disliked drinking this with a friend at all."
"wow...how disappointed am i?? this is not a good beer and for the price i am doubly disappointed. not recommended."
"D/M: Slight carbonation tingle, warms the pallet and the body as it is sipped sue to the whiskey notes, smooth on the pallet, drinks quite easily"
"Went over to a friends last night and he had a surprise for me. It was poured into standard pint glasses. The pour was copper with a medium white head, light lacing. The aroma is sweet, vanilla and bourbon. The beer was sweet, some honey. The main theme was light bourbon, very warming but not overwhelming. The beer was medium in body and had a sticky mouthfeel. The beer was dangerously drinkable. A good beer, but overpriced."
"D: nothing too impressive, but interesting nonetheless. give it a try if you feel like paying a premium price for a mediocre brew."
"This is very meh. The bourbon is perfect for the malt and the malt is fine but the spice and the hops just don't work for me."
"Everything told me that this would be a great and amazing brew. At $10.99 for a 22oz bottle, it had better be! Widmer is the only American brand in which Id risk this purchase, but wow! Widmer has outdone themselves again! This is by far the best new beer I have tried in a long time. This beer pours a beautiful dark amber color. The aroma of the bourbon barrels mixes well with the light citrus and vanilla aromatics. There is little head, no carbonation, and the perfect taste. If there ever was beer perfection, this is it!"
"D: This was not bad, but not great. The scent and taste and body all left something to be desired. Alcohol was noticeable but not bad, so it was easy enough to drink. Even though I tried this fresh, it seemed like the bottle was old. So this probably won't improve further with age. If you want a barrel aged ale (non-stout), you can find better elsewhere."
"Md-light body with some dextrinous and creamy character. I like the clean alcohol sting at the end. It carries with it some baby aspirin flavor to dry out the finish."
"Definite caramel color that is superb. Has an average smell that really gives off the bourbon flavor. I personally love bourbon so this beer is right up my alley. Not an overwhelming flavor but the sweetness and alcohol does hit you in the finish line."
"Smooth and drinkable, perhaps the best qualities of the beer, only there is a light mouthfeel, where I would prefer a little more body."
"A dangerously drinkable beer at 9.4% but drinking like a 4-5% beer. Extremely clean and blanced. It's a good thing I only have one."
"D- Easy drinking because the body is thin. I think this is an average beer and the total package seems overpriced. Does not leave me craving more and really does not seem all that special."
"Not very drinkable due to the one dimensional nature of the flavor and aroma. Not something I would seek out again."
"Some very complex characters going on in this brew. Some of which are not completely complimentary. Altogether though it is somewhat pleasing. And although I like Bourbon as much as the next fellow - a beer that is more like a hopped Bourbon, than a beer kissed with Bourbon character doesn't do it for me. Perhaps it would benefit from a year or more in the cellar, but at this young age it reminds me too much of when I used to drop a shot-glass of Jack into a frosty mug of Bud. Before I knew what good beer was."
"This is a decent beer. Not worth the price though in my opinion. So far I like this the least of the 3 limited releases by these guys but then again they always say the 1st is the best."
"All in all, a mixed bag. Some weird aftertastes going on here, and it ain't cheap, but I find it growing on me. I can't imagine the ingredients are all that expensive (are they?) so why the high price?"
"At first, while the beer was still cold from the fridge, the taste was nothing spectacular and immediately presented a bourbon burn at the back of my throat when I went in too fast. My second time around, I took it slower, still feeling the bourbon melting my insides as it slid down my throat, and tasted around. Other than some wintery spiciness, I pulled out some piney/resiny hops that were missing in the nose, lots of damp oak and wood, sweet toffee malts, caramel, and light vanilla - all of which combined on my tongue to make a thin, sticky syrup flavor/feeling that was slick going down. It held a light to medium-light body, which I did not expect, though with the amount of bright, tingly carbonation in this beer, there's not much room for it to be thicker. I guess I assumed it would be more rounded and smooth, but instead it popped in my mouth with the bright bubbles. Ending on a slightly dry note, the Barrel Aged Brrrbon wasn't too shabby. It's not going to be my go-to winter beer, regardless of how warm it made me with it's 9.4%ABV, but it was definitely unique. I only wish it was more like beer, with more diverse grains, malts, and hops, and focused less on the woody bourbon barrel aging flavors. Though I suppose without all the wood and sweet, warming alcohol, it wouldn't have much place as a limited release Brothers' Reserve, would it?"
"Pours clear copper and headless, to be a bit ghoulish. Looks like bourbon, really. Smells like wood. It smells, specifically, like wood stored in a cellar: earthy, damp, and metallic. Taste is strongly woody with orange notes and a honey-like finish. Too sweet in the finish for me. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and slick. The drinkability is limited by the sweet, woody finish. This is a great idea, but the wood aging just seems to overpower everything else."
"Pours barleywine-like in appearance with larger tan head than expected. Nose has some woody toffee notes, and perhaps a whiff of mixed nuts. Alcohol warmth is noted right away on palate with the bourbon influence revealing itself right away. Some of that woody toffee comes through on the palate as well, but not terribly sweet. Black tea flavors there too. Finishes semi sweet with boozy quality."
"Overall: I don't think I'll drink this again. Too much bourbon, not enough beer."
"D: Don't get me wrong. I love bourbon barrel beers. But if I want something like this, I'll grab either a bourbon barrel stout for more pronounced bourbon taste or a barleywine."
"My least favorite of the Brothers Reserve Series, so far."
"Drinkability-It's probably unfair to judge this one at so young an age. Likely these flavors will get better with some time in a cellar. That being said, some other young beers that are similar aged were much smoother. Surprisingly smooth flavor for a high alcohol beer."
"An appropriate beer while watching Barry Melrose dish out some harsh words for NHLers. Ain't that right, VDubb? It pours a clear sunrise amber topped by nearly two fingers of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises coconut-enhanced suntan lotion, oak, caramel, light cocoa powder, cheap whiskey, circus peanuts candy, and rye bread. The taste bludgeons me with rubbery whiskey and oak, while the caramel, rye, and light hot cinnamon cower in the corner, lest they get the full wrath of the drunken, abusive brrrbon tones. Man, they are really trying way too hard here. The body is a strangely stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a slimily dry finish. Overall, I'm not at all impressed with this brew. It tries way too hard to be a nice barrel-aged WW, but instead succeeds only at making me angry. I don't want to drink any more of this again. Period."
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a thin tan head, and leaves nice lacing. The aroma consists of overwhelming bourbon notes, along with some caramel and brown sugar, dark fruit notes, piney and citrusy hops and a big whiff of alcohol. The flavor is also dominated by bourbon notes, with some caramel and toffee and brown sugar, along with piney hops, dark fruits and alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick and drinkability is pretty limited. Really this just tastes like a slightly toned down bourbon, and the alcohol overwhelms anything else going on in the beer."
"This beer looks a nice orangish amber color with a fluffy white foam that laces well. The smell is citrus and oak. There is a slight malt aroma mixed with the pleasant hop aroma. The woodsy aroma is mirrored in spades with this beer's flavor. There is a strong boozy flavor with this beer that bites on the tongue. I really don't like the fact that I have wood in my mouth. The mouthfeel while spicy isn't that bad. The overall drinkability comes into question here solely due to the taste here, the rest of it is the saving grace. Holy crap this is intense. If you like barrels you can taste this one. Enjoy!"
"I've had bourbon barrele beer before, and it was phenomenal. I've had other Widmer Brother's brews that were great. This one is simply average, and for the price, would not recommend, or buy again. Only reason I'm still drinking is I don't want to waste $10 worth of beer."
"D: The base beer was just not complex or big enough to handle the barrel. Just because you can throw a beer in a barrel does not mean you should."
"drinkability - moderate complexity, a decent sipping brew, would likely age well"
"A disappointment. No nuance, nothing is incorporated well, and just not very interesting. Widmer just jumped on the barrel aged band wagon here without any thought of the end product. I would not recommended this."
"The body was a bit too thin. Drinkability was OK, but I don't think I'll want more than this one 22. Overall, not a ""bad"" beer, just a boring one. Try it if you want, but I think your time will be better spent elsewhere."
"D-Okay, but not worth going out of your way for."
"Worth a try though."
"The mouthfeel is heavy and pretty silky smooth. Carbonation is moderate, and perhaps a little high overall. Drinkability isn't bad, it really had some good bourbon and barrel flavors that were surprisingly smooth. What it didn't have though is depth. The base beer just didn't bring enough to table to add much to the barrel flavors. It was a decent drink on this cold evening, but not a great one."
"Overall- Alcohol is hid well. This is not bad, it is very thin in the body, thats the only real knock on this beer. Could be thicker, have another bottle to age, in about a year we will see whats up."
"Ken's bottle. Nice drinkability. Corny bourbon aroma. Yellow body lagerishg look with carbonation bubbles and big soapy head. Orangey oil. Herbal, orange flavours surprisingly. Bourbon in secondary. maybe some vanilla and sugar.Booze felt, but not predominant."
"Overall: There is a welcoming Winter Brew character to this beer that fits the season nicely. The Bourbon oak aroma is like sticking your nose in a freshly toasted oak barrel. Typically I find oak aged beers have a deeper wood presence, but the barrel aging here tells of youthful oak. Personally I enjoy the change, but some will find the wood to be too 'green' I imagine."
"Verdict: crazy, alcoholic and fun (like Jordan) but not worth it."
"Don't let the bad reviews fool you...this actually a well done barrel aged beer if you like things like Nemesis 2009 and Weyerbacher Insanity."
"Nicely oaky. Well played Widmer."
"D - For $13, this is not worth it in the least. Maybe at a $5 or $6 price-point it would be worth getting again for a cold winter day, but this is far too overpriced. Even with the bourbon as mellow as it is, it still overpowers everything. Too thin. Also, why was this winter warmer released in September?"
"D: A twist on a likable addition to last year's winter line-up. Still awfully warm right now, a fact that affects drinkability (somewhat). Worth a try (another good/interesting effort from the Bros. Reserve line) and something I'll pick up a bottle or two of for aging."
"Not a bad beer. But for $13 the d-train was pretty disappointed. I certainly won't be buying this again. Skip it."
"Poured with a small light tan head that mostly subsides in short order with a bit of lace. Color is a clear, rich, medium amber, with slow bubble trails. Aroma is malt, brandy, dark ripe fruit. Flavor is like nose with the malt and brandy more pronounced plus the tang of carbonation. Body is a little thinner than I'd expect in this style but good and carbonation is assertive. Finish is like flavor with lots of warming alcohol. Decent beer for a sipper. Not bad, but not great."
"Nice enough, but close but no cigar."
"Drink: a bit of a letdown. Brrrbon isn't a bad beer at all, but it suffers from the same symptoms as the other sub-par Widmer Reserve Series beer, Braggot. For the price tag, I just expect more flavor."
"D: Not a bad beer at all, pretty tame on bourbon and all. Still drinkable for price"
"I'll definitely be keeping an eye on Widmer Brothers."
"3.5/3/3.5/3/3.5"
"- Certainly a nice offering... but it seems to be missing some depth and grain... more light and sweet.. but I am thinking with a couple years on this bottle... it will turn out much better."
"Mouthfeel itself is nice, weighing in as medium bodied with low carbonation. Drinkability suffers from the aforementioned symptoms. See I'm wise enough to know when a gift needs givin'."
