"Delicious malty brew that is totally drinkable. It's an interesting paler sort of winter brew. My favorite of the 2014 winter beers."
"Overall, not a bad winter warmer, I'd have it again."

"Pours with 2 fingers of frothy white head that dissipates slowly.  Lots of little blobs of lace on the side.   Color is golden red, clear.  Aroma is of roasted malt and piney hops.  Starts mild and sweet, but the bitterness of the hops quickly takes over.  This has a long finish.  It is pretty full-bodied and solid.  A very enjoyable beer - I will have to visit the brewpub on my next trip down I-5."
"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, December month notched with no year for dating. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy bright orange color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, caramel, honey, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with solid strength. Taste of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, floral, grass, caramel, honey, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, pine, caramel, honey, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly sticky, and lightly creamy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice IPA. All around good balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth to drink. It is at least a year old in age, but still a nicely enjoyable offering as it stands now."

"Poured from a 355 ml bottle into an English pub glass. A dark orange-yellow amber with a half-finger of off-white foam gracing my glass. Looks like a pale ale or IPA, smells like a pale ale or IPA ... Lots of tropical fruit (mango), floral, and piney hop notes on the nose along with a brown sugar sweetness. Certainly more hoppy than your average winter warmer but quite sweet as well. I get more of the dried mango from the nose along with apricots, tangerine, pine needles, dried currants and sultana raisins, pancake syrup, and a faint nutty note. Although maltier than many of the aforementioned pale ale family, this is still a straight up kissing cousin to said clan. The finish starts sweet but dries out over time. Has a borderline syrupy mouthfeel that may or may not jive with the aggressive hop bill and the carbonation is at the low end of moderate. Enjoyable if a tad rough around the edges."

"Overall, slight knock because this is not a winter warmer and I thought it was when purchasing, but it is a good beer."
""

"O: nothing like a winter warmer. Maybe it's a different formula this year? No spices and not malty hops dominate. For an ipa, not half bad."
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, I must say. The alcohol is kind of front and center, but I guess a winter warmer is supposed to be warming. A different interpretation on the style and I quite like it. More geared toward hops than brown sugar and malt. I could see myself drinking this after hitting the slopes for some backside grunge nose grabs."

"Not an ideal warmer, so no props for the style. Still delicious and almost hoppy. Recommended."
""
""
""
"O- This is a great winter beer for those who like hoppy beers and Belgian-style beer. IPA meets trappist dubbel meets winter ale!"
""
"TASTE: Some grapefruit influence, strong bitterness, resinous qualities, and a solid malt body. Alittle citrus, some cocoa, and a bit herbal and tea like."
""

"This beer pours a cloudy orange/amber with a little sediment observed. (In fairness this bottle might be a little past prime.) The head is minimal and so is the lacing. The smell is subtle with a hint of citrus. Taste is an initial malt with grapefruit overtones giving way to a not unpleasant hoppiness for the finish with no aftertaste. Basically pretty average."
"Pours a coppery orange amber with a thin white head and light lacing. Citrus and pine aroma; hops. Citrus and citrus hops to start, slight malt and caramel with a hoppy finish. A little subdued compared to a IPA, but pleasant. Not getting any holiday spicing here, but a nice hoppy ale."
""
"Appearance is light copper with little head but enough retention to leave some lacing. There is a pleasant hop nose to this offering. The upfront taste is dominated by a cidery alcohol feel that is not unpleasant, but not terribly tasty either. The finish, by contrast is pleasantly hoppy."
"Hoppy aroma has a sour citrus note that has both grapefruit and orange elements plus a woody underpinning. It pours a pretty clear amber with a thick, fine-bubbled white head that leaves some generous lacing. Flavor is hoppy and woody, a little bitter, with more than a hint of fruity sweetness and some citrus. Smooth texture has about average fizz and body. Overall, not terrific, but worthy of a try."
""
""
"Overall this is a pretty decent beer. Taste does not flow well together though i like the breadt APA malt profile."
""
""
"The website says the grain bill is all Pale and Honey Malt. Hops are Chinook throughout the boil, and Chinook to dry hop. This is a dry hopped pale ale, through and through."
""
"overall - not sure why this is categorized as a winter warmer, it's very much an ipa in flavor profile and appearance, hops are plentiful and it's great tasting"
"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a 1/2 inch bone colored head that settles to a thin cap. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt and some spicy herbal hops. Taste is of sweet malt with a very spicy herbal and pine hop finish. A medium level of bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp yet smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer but I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as it stands now (a solid IPA for sure). Doesn't hurt that the beer is organic either."

"O: This was pretty good. A little hoppier than I like personally, but definitely one of the better winter warmers out there. I liked the Anchor one better."
"Overall: It can be a surprise (good or bad) sometimes to pick up a beer with the word winter as part of the title that isn't a spiced ale of some sort. Listen, I've got a beat-up Nokia phone from 2003. No interwebs access, no fancy-schmancy beer apps, so, I gotta go with what the beer bottle tells me. 'Winter' on the label can usually imply a malt-forward brew or something potentially packed with spices, the only ingredients listed were ""water, orange barley, and hops"". I assume yeast was utilized as well at some point. At any rate, a nice brew."
"Golden straw in color (hazy) with a white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma of mainly citrus and pineapple. Grapefruit hops dominate the flavor, but there's bready malt backbone to it. Medium bodied with an effervescent mouth feel. The finish is very dry and grapefruit hops linger along with a touch of alcohol. I was surprised to see that this is 7.5% ABV. Very drinkable—if you can deal with a high dosage of hops."
"The body was much thinner that is expected for the style. Drinkability was decent but not special. When I first moved to the area 11 years ago Fish quickly became one of my favorite breweries. Maybe it's my palate changing, but it seems that over the last 5-6 years Fish's brews aren't as noteworthy as in the past. Still, this beer is worth a shot if you see it."
"Not what I was expecting given the usual suspects in this style. Very much, as others have noted, like a double/imperial IPA in the character of this beer. After getting over the initial surprise I have to say I'd have it again."
"D - Once I learned that this wasn't your typical winter warmer, I was able to better appreciate it. At first I thought they got the production lines mixed up and were pouring their IIPA into the Winterfish bottles! If you're a hop fan, this beer is definitely for you. Really tasty!"
"Drinkability-Extremely smooth for a winter ale. Very nice and deinkable."
"D: People seem to keep saying good things about this brewery, but I haven't had good luck with them thus far. This was sort of a weird, spiced, strong pale ale more than anything."
"D - was difficult to review at first as it was not what I was expecting from a ""winter warmer", although I suppose that category is loose at best. This is like an American DIPA, and a good one. Nice hop backbone, and generally a refreshing bitter beer"
"Fish Brewing Company--Fish Tail Winterfish Seasonal Ale--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 7.50% ABV. 70 IBU's. (4.25 / 5.0) Winter Ale--IPA. Thin mild lace light white head. Clear pretty bright rich dark gold amber hint color. Herbal floral hop front. Dry sweet mild caramel crystal malt hop infused subtly Winter spiced rich body. Rich spicy clean hop end. Flavor beats bad buds tonight! Sampled 11/4/2010 from 6- Pack purchased for $6.99 @ The Ballard Market, Seattle on 10/19/2010."
"Reviewed on Feb 11, 2010."
"If this is the American interpretation of the winter warmer then we are headed down the right path, though this could easily be confused with an American double IPA. Regardless, it's a choice winter seasonal for your inner hophead."
"Poured a glowing golden orange color with good carbonation and a nice, small white head. Nose is citrus, hops, breadiness, toffee and caramel. Taste is so smooth, earthy, caramel, bread, citrus and floral notes. Mouthfeel is light booze, bittering on end with a nice malt backbone, coating and so damn good! F'in A. I am going to polish this growler off and go get some more."
"D - This is a smooth and balanced beer that goes down easy and leaves no regrets."
"D: Hmm...not exactly 'drinkable' by my definition, yet a nice one to hoist one of, and a brew I'd probably have again. 'Average' weight for a Winter Warmer (which means it packs a sneakily potent punch).Probably worth having again, though I prefer the more malty versions of the style..."
"Interesting beer, but very tasty. It is going down super easy. I think to call this is a winter warmer isn't quite right, this tastes more like an IPA to me. But a different take on the style..."
"D: A good winter beer, definitely a sipper, the flavours are powerful and direct. A satisfying after dinner beverage."
"This is a solid beer, but I don't think it's anything spectacular. Unfortunately, I had it after a glass of the HUB abominable winter ale, and I think it suffered a bit by comparison. This is a very good beer, but needless to say, it doesn't compare to the abominable."
"Golden amber body, one finger white semi-rocky head, medium dissipation with nice lacing. Big hoppiness in the nose, there may be some dry bready malts but they are subsumed by the spicy, floral Cascade presence. Taste is certainly more of an IPA than a traditional Winter Warmer, huge hoppy bitterness, and a big bitter finish. Big carbonated mouthfeel. Not the most drinkable of beers at this ABV. While the WW category lacks precise definition, this is certainly more of an (D)IPA than WW, IMO. However, a great hoppy holiday ale to counterbalance the spiciness and fruitiness of other beers served during this time of year. Worth a try for the hopheads."
"drinkability is nice. good balance. decent depth. a nice winter warmer."
"Pours a hazy orange, almost a dark golden, medium sized white head forms, decently thick, settles to a thick ring, some nice lacing on the glass. Smell is neat, sweet and malty, honey and bread, biscuit, caramel, some light floral, toffee, raisin, dark fruit, pretty nice. Taste is similar, a malt bomb, honey and biscuit, toffee, huge malty middle, lightly spicy, bread, brown sugar, very rich. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, real nice body. This is a great winter warmer, nice maltiness, and not too sweet."
"Definately tasting like a big, malty IPA. Not the freshest but certainly holding up well and damn tasty."
"This brew might be a solid local seasonal, but it's not worth going out of one's way to try."
"This beer pours a hazy apricot hue, with a little soapy white head. It smells of sweet caramel malt, raisins, molasses, and citrus hops. The taste has a strong caramel malt body, and the citrus hops are quite prominent. There's a mild carbonation to go with the decent weight of this beer, which tastes like a junior American barley wine. The finish is mild caramel malt, and a minor alcohol warming. This is a very nicely balanced and strongly flavoured beer, I would have this again."
"This beer was brewed in Oct. so it is fairly fresh. A fine pour, good job Fish!"
"Overall a good beer but as a winter seasonal it doesn't really stand out to me. I would call it a way above average pale ale but not a standout winter warmer or spicy winter beer."
"taste is creamy, light grapefruit, caramel, some sweetness, slight bitter, citrus, some pepper, and some malt, leaves mouth sticky."
"Drinkability is pretty high, but it's a big, rich beer. I love this style of winter warmer, the PNW Red IPA! 7.5% is just strong enough to warm while style allowing me a few, and I love the hoppy bite and play of the citrus with the darker crystals. Great price and a great winter warmer"
"d. Not a bad beer. Definitely more of an IPA than a Winter Warmer, as categorized. Everything is decent except for the oddness that's throwing me in the taste. Maybe it's just me? or maybe this year's batch is slightly off. I don't distinctly remember this one in past years, so i can't say for sure. If you like west-coast citrusy IPAs, it may be worth a shot."
"Drinkability: If you like the sweet spices of a Winter Warmer and the bitter hops from an IPA, this beer delivers a nice blend of both worlds"
"D-A decent brew...but there is a strange ending(aftertaste) that I do not care for. Classified totally worng, but oh well...I didnt list it!"
"D: This would be a very easy beer to polish of a sixer of. It's not too aggressive, it's not too over-the-top, it's a great drinking beer, just not a winter warmer."
"Pours a dark golden with little head. Smells of apricot and quite sweet- maybe candi sugar? Also apples on the finish. Tastes lightly spiced, someewhat sweet and fruity and with a citrusy hop bitterness on the end. Mouthfeel is slightly slick but somewhat crisp. Eh. Just okay. There are plenty of other great winter seasonals out there for my money. I like this brewery, but I think they've fallen down on this one. Your winter beer should be something special."
"Notes - This is an IPA rather than a winter warmer. It's very much along the lines of Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale. Not a bad beer at all, but it doesn't stand out in a market flooded with similar beers."
"Thanks to jcwattsrugger for bringing a bottle of this one back for me from his trip to Washington!"
"Pours a cloudy orange color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tannish head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing. The nose is hoppy, nice touch of pines/citrus, and caramel. The taste is pretty hoppy, lots of pines/citrus, and caramel. Medium body. Very Drinkable, this is a very tasty IPA, definitely would recommend."
"Quite tasty...I like it. A downtempo version of Fish Tale's anniversary ale, and quite tasty. Fairly cloying, but that's alright. Very tasty."
"12 ounce Bottle courtesy of CBA via CdnBIF- thanks man! Great looking beer out of the gate. Clarity is top notch along with a fluffy white head and nice light orange glow. Smell is spicy malts and hops. Taste- very nice. Reminds of Alpha King. Malts are quite stong in a flavourful cookie dough kind of way and balance out the agressive hops nicely. Hops are predominatley of the bittering kind, but pop up in a citrus juicyness on the back end. Very dry finish. Carbonation is appropriate for style and brew is quite drinkable. No doubt much tastier fresh as this has a few months under its belt- held up well though."
"D - A decent ale regardless of style. Big and hoppy with a boozy malty finish. I would recommend a hearty shepherd's pie to go along this strong flavorful ale."
"Bottle courtesy of Sammy: Poured a deep slightly orangey color ale with a small foamy head with some limited retention and lacing. Aroma of citrus and bitter hops is mostly dominating without being too strong. Taste is a mix between some sweet malt with a medium bitter finish with some distinctive citrus notes. Body is quite full with some low carbonation. Overall, while this was an interesting beer I thought it was lacking in hops bites for the style."
"Overall - It's not a mouth puckering bitter IPA, but its got loads of juicy citrus hop goodness. I really like this and hope to find it again."
"I like this much more than their organic IPA. More balance. Poured with a small white head and decent lace. Odd reddish amber color wih traces of pink?!?!?! Aroma is very hoppy rounded off with some caramel malt and accented with spice and resin. Flavor is BIG in the hop department. Some residual sweetness. Long hoppy finish. Decent beer."
"This is a nice change of pace from more hoppy IPAs, which I tend to like. Definitely goes down easy, yet still remains hoppy enough to be interesting. I wish I would be able to encounter this on-tap locally, as I think a few of these would really hit the spot on a cold winter's night."
"Drinkability is excellent if this is your style. For me, it starts out fine, but seems a bit dry, tangy, thick and sweet to enjoy too much of."
"Found in Calgary. Yes, the advertisement says the hoppiest Winter beer, and it's an IPA for its seasonal. Lacey head, creamy on cloudy yellow. Hop and barley aroma. Full mouthfeel, with hoppy and yeasty taste. Smooth, some c-hop and some other hop. A nice one."
"Medium body brew with a nice bitter dryness to the aftertaste. Nothing spectacular, but easily a beer that I could sit and enjoy a few of."
"A pleasant IPA, easily a session ale if it weren't for the fact that the abv% should stop you after a few (or it'll end in tears...). A curious pick of style from Fish Tale for a winter seasonal, but the fruity hops hold their own against a lot of other winter warmers out there."
"D: The abv is a bit high to enjoy several, but this breaks the mold of a winter ale. It is big and hoppy, tart without scalding the tastebuds."
"12 oz single. Darkish orange beer with a small off white head, that goes fast, leaving some lace. Great sweet spicy hop aromas more grapefruit than pine! Lovelly tasty IPA indeed..great flavors of pink grapefruit and sour berries and a wonderful honeyish sweetness to balance the tartness. Very nice mouthfeel quite smooth and delictable. Overall a very very nice IPA."
"Pours a bright golden-orange color topped by a half-inch of stark white head that lingers for just a moment before retreating into a small halo. Aroma of pale and caramel malts, light fruity hops, and a touch of fresh fruit. Palate is a bit better balanced and more subtle than the nose - the fruity hops fully emerge around mid-palate, yielding to a caramel sweetness on the finish. Body is nice and creamy, with a good bit of alcohol warming on the finish. Nicely drinkable, although a bit odd to be considered a winter beer. Call it whatever you want, I'll still gladly drink it."
"Pours an orange/copper color. Slightly hazy from the yeast. Very little head to this one. Citrusy aroma with some caramel and maybe some biscuit notes. Kind of hard to tell, doesn't seem like there is much aroma. Nice crisp bitterness in the flavor. Bready flavor with some somkiness. Dry mouthfeel and lightly carbonated. This is an intestesting beer, I'll have this one again."
"Re-review 5/1 Ok this is better. It's not great but at least it's drinkable. Hops are bitter and grassy, almost like stinging nettles. The malts are a bit too smooth, lapsing into a green-apple, butterscotch yeast flavor, but on the whole the beer is not nearly as offensive. The hops are probably the highlight; the rest of the beer ho-hum. Upping the score accordingly."
"12 ounce bottle. Fish Tale Winterfish pours out a hazy amber color with small head. The aroma is piney and herbal. Sweet caramel flavor balanced by piney hops. Some lemon iced tea flavor. Tropical fruit flavors too. Nice balance, but I'm not very impressed with the flavor in this beer. Mouthfeel is medium. Very low carbonation. Drinkability is ok. I didn't detect the frsh hop flavors described by other reviewers. Perhaps mine was an older bottle."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" beige head above the golden amber brew. Head quickly fades down to an uneven layer of bubbles, and minimal small bubbles of lacing. Aroma is fruity hops with a syrupy malt undercurrent. Taste is similar to the nose, but the hops are a bit moire varied, with pine coming into play a bit as well with the fruit. Bitter alcoholic close. Mouthfeel is alright, maybe a bit on the flat side, and drinkability is okay as well. This one hasn't caused me to run out and find more. But if I happen upon it, I'd give it another chance."
"Another bottle from dirtylou's stash during my stay."
"Pours a clear deep golden with a thinner than expected head but I will say it did have some staying power,I have to say the aromas were a bit more muted than expected as well some herbal and piney hop but it really dont jump out at ya.Hmm the suprises keep coming an IPA it is but the flavors seem really off quite dry and very earthy with a real alcohol punch in the finish,quite harsh.Very dissapointing I really thought from other reviews it would be better,one of the odder IPA's I have had to date.I'll pass on this if ever given the chance to try again."
"Has a low carbonation. Seems to be lacking a little complexity. Overall, I found this moderately drinkable. Not something I would pursue, but nice to have once in a while."
"drinkability: all too drinkable"
"A ""brake the chill"" thanks to cvschaller for the many samples!"
"It should, however, be noted that it doesn't age worth a shit. Even after 4-5 months, it's notably degraded. So if it ain't absolutely fresh, throw it back."
"Purchased at a Nugget supermarket in Davis, CA."
"Dark copper color with a thick white head of tight bubbles. A nice sheet of lace is left down the side of the glass. The aroma is dominated by the hops. As discussed amongst some Bas attending a tasting, the aroma smells like Simcoe, mandarin orange, a little grassy character. The site says Chinook, but it really does taste like Simcoe. Not sure, but I like it. There is a little caramel back on the nose. The taste has the sweet/citrus character backed by toffee malt. Nice, sharp (not over-the-top) bitterness. Very slick mouth feel, great drinkability."
"Pours a burnt orange gold with a very sticky head that fades fairly quickly but sticks to the glass with a vengence. The aroma is filled with hop oils and the ripeness that comes from the dry hopping. The taste is sweet up front, and the hop bitterness follows with power. The flavoring hops are very nicely done and make a huge presence, but don't outstay their welcome. The pine-like bitterness that comes through is absolutely great. The roughness of the hops are so fresh and pure that it actually feels as though it is scratching your mouth (which is surprisingly awesome) but it completely smooths out in the finish. This stuff goes down incredibly smooth and I could handle this all night. They definately used some huge NW hops in this brew and it all paid off. One of the best IPAs I have had in a while."
"After trying the Leviathan BW and this, I'm gonna have to give Fish another spin or two when I hit the store again!"
"Mouthfeel is solid, and gives a nice finish on each sip. Somewhere along the first pint, I fell in love with this brew and had another before we headed down the road. The second was in many ways much better than the first. A truly unique and satisfying brew. I enjoyed it along with my remaining seafood chowder."
"A hazy (bottle-conditioned) orange/copper body rests sleepily beneath a good-sized head of fine-bubbled, creamy white foam. The head retention is quite good and it leaves some very nice Brussels-style lace about the glass. The nose is a touch fruity from the yeast, sweetly bready, and hoppy with pine and grapefruit (Centennials? Or perhaps a Chinook/Cascade combination?). It's quite smooth and creamy in the mouth, starting with a delicate caress from it's exceptionally fine-bubbled natural carbonation and becoming more solid as its full body becomes apparent. The interplay between the yeasty fruitiness and grassy, subtly pine/spruce like hops is interesting with a speedbump of lightly sweet malt thrown in the middle there. It's not overly complex, or as rich, brash, or bold as some examples, but it is quite enjoyable in its own right - hence, a great drinkability. The only thing that might hold back its drinkability is its 7% abv; but the alcohol itself never shows or becomes a problem, it's just that you can't drink too many in one sitting. Or course the question is ""would you want to?""... I think perhaps yes!"
"Body is a deep orange color with a cap of white foam. Foam disappears quick leaving the slightest scattering of lace on the glass. Some caramel malt and a nice bit of citric hops make up the aroma. Fairly mild aroma but pleasant. Flavor starts of a bit sweet with malt upfront before the bitter grapefruit takes control. Tastes quite juicy with hops and is pretty solid. Ends on a slight bitter hop note. Medium body and it goes down smooth with a slight prickling from the bitterness. Good drinkability, while its not a favorite of mine its a good solid IPA."
"I can't decide if I like Winterfish or if I love it. If you're looking for something different and consider yourself a hophead, give this one a whirl. It's a fascinating, an original and a delicious ride."
"Nothing in Winterfish is overstated. It is proudly brewed in the Republic of Cascadia with Yakima Chinook hops and leaves behind a lacy tailing of foam on the glass. When served from the bottle, this beer is highly particulate. Pour it slowly to maximize clarity."
"The beer pours a hazy golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is excellent. It has a mildly malty scent that is complemented with a wonderful floral hop aroma; very refreshing. The taste is good. It has a sweet malty flavor that is fruity with yeast. It goes down easy and finishes bitter with a hoppy aftertaste. It has a powerful malty presence and a well hid elevated abv. . The mouthfeel is great. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good seasonal. It has the whole package; a good drinker."
"Beer started off well, poured a glowing orange color with a good head and a spicy-sweet and floral aroma. The taste was strange though, only lightly fruity with more bitterness than sweetness, and a thin only slightly malty body. It was definitely spiced up, but the spices seemed ""off"" (I don't know how else to describe it) and the dry and slightly piney finish turned the spices to ash in my mouth. Honestly I could only finish about half a glass, it seemed like it had been watered down or something. If I see one of these I'll try it again just to be sure I guess."
"It is a dark orange gold color with a big, creamy off-white head. There is a slight haze and it leaves some decent lace as well. The first thing I notice in the aroma is a fruitniess. It reminds me of peaches. There maltiness is balanced out by some piney and citrus hop aromas. The medium body is fruity (apricot and peaches?) with a nice hoppy finish and a touch of alcohol. It is a nicely done bitter beer for the winter."
"Comments  My bros BigHuge and ZAP saved me from being the high ball here, but I just love this stuff. Too bad my wife took the rest of the bottle."
"Tawny copper with a slight haze. Dense, mountainous, persistent ivory white head leaves muddled lace. The aroma is comprised of rounded tangerine citrus accompanied by sharper hints of pine sap and lemon rind. Soft medium lovibond caramel sweetness offers contrast. Well balanced aromawise. Pronounced toffee upfront in flavor is quickly ensued and nearly overrun by assertive, quinine like hop bitterness. Bitterness is quickly fleeting, however, and malt of a brown sugar sprinkled burnt biscuit nature surges in mid palate. Residual sweetness persists and a combines with the citric hop undertone to lend a toothsome orange marmalade impression. Seemingly moderately attenuated, with both ample dextrins and residual sugars facilitating a firmly viscous, somewhat syrupy mouthfeel. Caramel presence augments as it breathes, leaving the lasting impression skewed towards malt sweetness. Finishes appropriately bittersweet, with a lingering note of candied lemon pith. Quite an enjoyable brew, but a touch heavy on the palate for regular quaffing. Winterfish is simple, but malt driven in its overall character. Hops provide apt balance. Very tasty."
"2001 release. Light brown color, medium head. Aroma is fruity and slightly sweet. Lightly malty, somewhat hoppy, spicy. Rather dry and somewhat tart. A lighter flavored winter ale. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is dry and clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Interesting beer."
"Orange in color with a thin head. Citrusy aroma, smell warns of the hops to come. This IPA is dominated by hops and the citrus-like taste comes on strong here. There is a hint of maltyness, but not enough to the balance that I would prefer . A well crafted and beer, but not totally unique. If you lean toward a hop dominated beer this might be up your alley."
"PNW brewing then bring on the rest of these big beers."
"This beer pours a slightly hazy amber color with a white head. It smells hoppy and piney. This beer tastes hoppy with residual flavors of malt, pine and fruit. A very complex flavor. Apparantly this beer has some spruce and juniper in it but not so much that I could notice without coaching. I've drank quite a few of these in a row with no ill effects, some other juniper berried beer is tough on my body. This beer is a cross between an IPA and a winter warmer."
"The pour somewhat hazy amber color, the head is modest and frothy and a winsome beige color, the residual lace a fine covering upon the glass. Hop floral dominates the nose, sweet and malt laden, crisp and clean to boot. Start has a lot of malt, lightly sweet with a middling top and the finish biting in its hop spicy bite, the carbonation moderate, the aftertaste dry and long lasting and another great beer from Fish tale"
"Grapefruit on the nose....grapefruit on the buds....grapefruit everywhere and I love it....This is a tasty little beverage...pours a hazy deep orange....smells like a glass of grapefruit juice....a full mouthfeel with a very nice malt sweetness that balances this bad boy off nicely....the juicy, grapefruit hop flavors take center stage but the unsung hero is the nice malt sweetness...This is very,very good bordering on outstanding..."
"Hazy orange tinted copper color with particulates in suspension.   A small head becomes a bubbly film in a few seconds.  Lacing is very nice.  Huge pine syrup, pungent  medicinal aroma.  I love it.  The taste reminds me of cannabis.  Its very resiny.   Man I love some of these West Coast brews.  What they do with hops out there is similar to what Brett Favre does with a  football. Pure magic.   This is a bitter beer.  In a great way.  I liken it to the Bastard a little bit.  The oily, resiny, pungent hop contributions are just magnificent.  There appears to be some decent malt backing as well.  Body is about medium-full.  This beer is not for the weak of heart.   Gotta thank Matt Maples for recommending this one to me on the horn a few weeks ago."
"This winter ale is truly unique.  Pale color, but with quite a heavy body.  This is also one of the most heavily hopped winter ales I have ever experienced.  Plenty of IBUs to go around.  Alcohol content gives another reason to stay in out of the cold."
