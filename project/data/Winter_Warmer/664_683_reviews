"Overall - I doubt I'll be re-visting this beer in the near future, but if it was the only cask ale present I wouldn't be too shy !"

"I will be the first to admit that carbonation seems to be among the first things to go. I had a good finger of deep-tan head until it gently fell, leaving behind a thin layer of head. Color was a deep brown with cola highlights and I could not decide if that was the result of my having stirred up some sediment that its clarity was not better. Nose was very caramel-malty, but not much beyond that. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a sweet-sour flavor on the tongue. I may have caught this one just in time! It was still caramel-malty sweet, but a sharp sourness was beginning to creep in. Finish was lingering with the caramel sweetness, so perhaps I did not screw it up as badly as I thought ... Winter in the Summer, who'd'a thunk it?"
"Had a dusty, vintage bottle at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA. Aside from the dust and old green label, this is clearly a cellared, but well-aged beer. There's no strong newspaper or cardboard oxidation (thank god), but still a spicy, leathery character with hints of sherry. There were also pleasant notes of lemon and berry fruit. It was a complex beer, but the aged character was a bit heavy. Still, a very nice experience and tasty beer."
"Verdict: Again, it could be the aging that has thrown the flavors off, as I felt the beer was quite ""stale"". Most of the qualities of this beer seem tarnished and off. Not hugely enjoyable but I'm going to try a more recent version next winter to see if I can't change my mind. Pretty average for what it's worth. C (2.95)"
"D-Hard to say definitively, due to possible infection, but it seemed okay."
"Won't knock your socks off, certainly not as complex as some of the more contemporary takes on the style. However, it doesn't do anything particularly wrong, it's a nice malt showcase."
"D: Fairly good for a winter warmer. Goes down much like SA winter lager. A nice entry."
"D: Not a bad brew, but not complex or warming enough to warrant a seasonal rotation spot. Sessionable and worth a try but I'd reach for something with more character or ABV at least."
"D: nothing bad, but nothing extraordinary either so could have a couple without trouble, but probably won't get another"
"Drinkability: Not sure this one's meant to be consumed after the best-by date, as I enjoyed it, but the flavors were completely muted and subdued. Maybe that's just the beer, though? I'd be interested in trying a fresh bottle at this point; maybe age hurt it more than helped it."
"Pours dark brown with a thick head that sat on top of the beer the whole time. Roasted malt, fruit, chocolate and nutty aromas. There was also a floral hop aroma in there. Sweet Chocolate nutty flavor that gives way to sweet toasted malts. Nothing is too overpowering and it is very balanced. A heavy mouthfeel. The flavor sort of lingers, which is nice."
"The taste is rich, full, malty, and toasty, with definite caramelly-fruity sweetness but also a balancing hoppy, leafy bitterness that really kicks up in the end, giving it a nice bite. It's rich and full-bodied in the feel. This is delicious and very satisfying beer."
"A decent ale, but as many others have noted, certainly not a warmer for the winter time. Also not the best of offerings from Youngs. I'd stay with the Oatmeal Stout or Chocolate Stout for the winter. Even better, Old Nick, if you can still find it. (BTW, I've recently found some from 2005 and it was excellent)."
"Young's Winter Warmer poured a dark amber/ruby color with a fluffy light tan head. Smell was very sweet, malt. Taste was malty, with some hints of bittersweet chocolate. Mouthfeel was ok, a bit think. Drinkabilty was good, nice easy drinker. I have to say that I was a bit underwhelmed by this beer. I have like young's beers in the past, but this one let me down a bit. This beer was bit overly sweet and sticky."
"Pours a somewhat murky brown with an okay head that settles to a ring. Smells a bit earthy with some light cocoa notes and a bit bready as well. There is a slight woodiness to the aroma and a characteristically British metallic minerality on the finish. Taste is a little muddled up front, with a lot more earthiness and with a mineral finish. The breadiness goes away. Refreshing and a good hit of dry malt that lends some more chocolate. Not sweet, and easy to drink. Pretty decent, but mothing that really excites me."
"Overall, not a bad tinnie."
"Its surprising this isnt brewed with any spices. Its got lots of traditional spiced beer flavors."
"(rated Jan 1, 2008)"
"I hate to say it, but somewhat disappointing for Young's. Lacking the traditional winter warmer character."
"Looks and pours like an old ale. A murky brunette with a short-lived off-white head. Aroma of nutmeg, caramel, and dust. Syrupy mouthfeel. Tasted like an old ale as well. Lots of caramel, wood, and metal. You know how a beer just keeps going downhill as you drink it? That's this beer."
"D: Average drinkability for a winter brew, nothing that really stands out. lacks heart."
"D: Very drinkable winter warmer, I was expecting more from the spices, but this was a nice surprise, very mild and overall a nice beer."
"D= This was an OK beer but nothing to write home about. It was easy to drink though..."
"500 ml bottle bought at College Liquors in Grand Junction, CO. Pours a ruby-brown color with a very large and thick cream colored head. The aroma is very light toasted malts and nutty notes. The flavor is very nice; smooth bursts of fruit, toasted malts, light nutty flavors and a rich and full mouthfeel. Very nice. I love the label and the beer. Easygoing and yet very flavorful. Great. Also, this beer is a few years old, best by September 2007, but still quite good. I'll re-rate when I get a fresher one."
"This is an enjoyable beer. Nothing over the top, and a little on the bland side. Though there are much worse beers to be had."
"D - An OK beer - maybe more of a dark ale than a winter warmer though."
"D - Overall this is an okay brew that I would reach for if I was at the pub in England on a late fall or mild winter day. It has some good flavor in it but nothing that would make me reach for it outside of that experience."
"Quite a drinkable brew for a cooler evening. It goes down quite easy, and could be a better effort for most Australians over, say, a porter, or a stout."
"I poured a nice brown hue and was clear with off white foam. The smell and taste was what I expected. It was sort of fruity with a grainy aftertaste to match the slight bitterness. Although it was a nice mellow ale, I just couldn't rate it any higher, because, the taste dissipated and was gone after tasting. A short finish I feel was the back breaker of this ale!"
"The flavor is equally as sweet. The syrupy/molasses flavor really comes through, but with the slight inflection of English hops, the result is a very enjoyable ale. It's super sweet to be sure, and it may not necessarily ""warm"" you, but if you're a fan of malty English brews, this one is for you."
"On the positive side of things this beer is mellow and smooth. Despite the taste not adhering to the style of a winter warmer it is easy to drink and could easily be a session beer."
"Dark coppery/brown pour but clear with a creamy beige head. Smell is slightly tart and sweet malt, a touch of alcohol and some metal. Decent nose for the style. Taste is pretty thin, metallic and slightly sweet and tart malt with a metallic finish. Nothing special, but drinkable. All in all, not too enjoyable and another average to below average beer..."
"D - I enjoyed this beer good taste and pretty smooth worth trying sometime"
"drinkability is great. this is a smooth and drinkable winter warmer, yet bold enough to build a solid character. an excellent brew. cheers!"
"Drinkability: Very pleasant to drink. Light on alcohol, sure, but it's full of flavor. I've got a mind to pick up a few more of these."
"D: Drinkable, but not something I would crave."
"Drinkability: Too malty. Too oily, Not for me. Expected something tasty with alot of spices present."
"Verdict: Average for the style. Drinkable but I believe I've had better."
"This is the second time that I have drank this beer, and surprised that it did not get reviewed the first time. The beer opens with a solid brown color and a billowing tan head that rose powerfully to the top of the imperial English pint glass. The beer later proved to show great head retention and lacing, despite it's deep cola-like hue. Aromas a sweet malts take on molassas and toffee-like proportions and transfer directly to the flavors. Undertones of chesnuts, cashews, and berry character shows more so in the flavors that the scent. Quite estery, spicy, and with a hint of alcohol warmth on the palate. The feel is moderate, but a bit disjointed with the taste. I can't decide if I want the body to be heavier to support the sweetness or if it should be softer, allowing easier drinkability. Finishes a bit too sweet for the pungent / perfumy hops to counter. Lingers with a cola-like flavor that serves as a bit of a distraction. The problems that I have with this beer is common with those that I have in most winter warmers. The style is obviously not my favorite. Mainly because it tries too hard to be everything to everyone, and doesn't pull any of them off well. Still, it's difficult to criticize a well-made beer."
"D: Not too high, but it is pretty drinkable. In fact last time I think I had two or three."
"All told, a pretty good warmer, nothing too extravagant but worth a try."
"Aroma is malty, with some caramel & brown sugar Flavor is moderately malty, some caramel, light molasses, & dark fruits (maybe raisins). Finish is pretty dry, with a light bitter hop note coming through. Medium body, light-to-moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is thin, and somewhat watery. Doesn't really coat as the label suggests. ABV is pretty light for a winter warmer, so not much of a warming happening with this one. Plenty of better options out there. This was the worse Winter Warmer I have ever had."
"500 ml. glass bottle- color of deep amber, with a medium tan colored head - nose of roasted malts, slight honey , and mild citrus hops  taste of roasted malts, slight honey, some toffee, and mild citrus hops - body is light, and clean , and with medium low carbonation  aftertaste of sweet malts, , dry, and clean"
"Pours from the bottle a nice dark copper brown with a thick tan head. Not a much hop aroma in the pour or as the beer warms. As with other Brit winter warmer I have tried there is no alcohol warmth-which I don't expect from a 5% beer. Toasty finish? Mouth feel is light and drinkability is good due in large part to the low alcohol and hop profile, all in al a drinkable beer but for the winter time I will stick with American winter styles."
"D = Definitely drinkable. It goes down easy, I would not turn a second one down. That said, this is not at the top of the line for Young & Co. I expected better from this brewery."
"Pours with a dark amber hue and a small white head that fades after a few minutes. Aroma is fruity with a hint of caramel and toffee. Taste was decent. A good bit of fruity flavors, mostly banana, and a very light hop bitterness. Mouthfeel was very light on the palate making this beer quite drinkable and sessionable. I used to love this beer years ago, but now it seems boring. It's way too light to be a true Winter Warmer. Maybe my palate has been jaded by all the double and triple whatever beers that are available now. Still, I'd take this any day over the usual macro lagers."
"Came in a pint glass a nice heavy brown color, still with a nice bit of head and ended up with some good lacing. Decent scent, a nice malty hint with some spices. Good taste, a nice strong (in flavor) ale with excellent holiday spices (I detected nutmeg and cinnamon). Went down great, too! Very smooth. Worth many a pint this winter."
"Poured into a pint glass. Poured a dark brown w/a thick tan head. The smell was a bit malty with a little bit of a roasted character. The taste is that of a brown ale, with a malty tone and a roasted malt aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light and has a little carbonation. My overall feel of this beer is it is very drinkable on a cold winter night. I would buy this by the case load."
"I really wasn't exactly sure what to expect from this one. It ended up being a fantastic representation of the style! I wish I had bought more than just one."
"But as soon as I finished this one, I quickly wanted another...isn't that the mark of a truly good brew?"
"From a 16.09 oz bottle with a black cat on it that ran me $2.99, this dark, mysterious looking brew poured a copper / dark-orange color which was appropriate for its status as ""winter warmer""... The smell was pretty good, with a nice cocoa / stout aroma which was decent without being too powerful... The taste was great - a smooth cocoa / latte finish which could have used a few more spices, but was overall a nice mix without being over-bearing... At 5% abv, I thought it could use a little more alcohol to be more appropriate as a warmer, but this was still an enjoyable brew with a good mouthfeel and a great drinkability, partly due to the fact that the aroma and taste were not over-bearing... all said, a really good brew that is definitely recommended..."
"Overall, this is distinctly NOT a winter warmer, regardless of the bottle designation. Brown ale, maybe, but not a w-w. Coming from Young's this is a bit of a disappointment."
"This is the first Young's beer that's disappointed me"
"Pours a clear brownish red with a light head of large tan bubbles. Lightly musty aroma, slight vegetal hops. Light body- a bit surprising. Light burnt malt flavor and thats about it. Very drinkable, but nothing special or that interesting."
"Pours a clean amber/ copper color with a small white head. Armoas of a small sweet malt. In the taste, sweet maltiness, and a hint of butterscotch. A small bitter mouthfeel, with a dry butterscotch aftertaste. Easy to drink, not much in the nose, but a nice flavor, with a small bitterness."
"bought at a local liquor store kind of spur of the moment, actually went there for something else. beer pours with a nice head and is a deep brown in color. the beer is quite rich and complex in appearance. smell is fruity (but definitely not citrusy) with a hint of bitter chocolate. this beer has a subtle texture in the mouth. flavors are dark coffee and dark chocolate. definitely has some bitterness to balance out the coffee and choclate and this is by no means an overly sweet beer. another delicious offering from young's. at 5.2 percent alcohol you could session a few of these."
"The taste was a bit of a surprise after the aroma. I expected something sweet and fruity. This actually has some really nice maltiness. Toasted malts dominate. It is nicely carbonated and finishes crisp. Maybe a little thin if I was to nitpick."
"M&D: the condition of fizziness is fitting for a bottled ale (quite soft), while the body holds up well, remaining moderate and manageable. For a Winter Warmer or a Premium Bitter designed for winter, however, this bottle fails to impress or to satisfy my palate, even though I am now drinking it at just 13 centigrade in Sheffield's mid-summer... I only hope it's not the weather that makes me moan. The cask version is way better, mind you."
"I was expecting more from this beer, having in the past, drank it on cask."
"Pours cloudy medium brown with minor head and thin sheen of lace. The aroma is mellow but pleasing. Mostly nutty, with suggestions of crusty bread, brown sugar, raisins, and a faint touch of leafy hop. The beer is bigger in flavor. A flash of metallic water at the start gives way to a big toast and brown sugar center. Earthy pine-flavored hops provide a strong and long lasting dry finish. The fairly thick, chewy, body is balanced towards creaminess, with enough carbonation lingering to keep things interesting. The hefty body makes this a unhurried drink despite the low alcohol."
"D - Overall this is a plesant and very drinkable beer, however, in my opinion, it is too mild to really be a winter warmer. At 5.2% it just doesn't have any really warming properties. Seems like it would have been more accurate to call it a bitter of some sort."
"Cheers2Beers"
"D - One of these is not bad, but I would not want more than one is a single sitting. I almost wish I could give quarter points, because I would give the drinkability a 3.25 on this brew."
"D: Wasnt sure what to expect but i wasnt a great fan of this. The lack of flavour could allow you to drink it in a session but would become very boring, Greasy butter aftertaste wasnt my cup of tea either. Pass"
"Pours out a dark chestnut kind of rusty brown with a tan head that clings to the sides, causing a dip in the middle of the glass. Leaves thick rings of intricate lacing. Smells is of dark toasted malts, light fruit like apple and pear, and some mild herbal hop. Taste is malty with a firm bread flavor in there along with some diacetyl, herbal hops,caramel, and roasted flavors. Mouthfeel is tame in the carbonation department, but just a bit thin. This is really drinkable and is quick to go."
"A great beer when it is bottled, better on-tap and splendid on cask, as one could have expected."
"I'm not sure if I would call this a session beer, I really liked it, but I can't see myself enjoying more than one or two at a time. It has a wonderful, deep copper color and balanced aroma. What was the most striking about this ale is its wonderful bitternes! Not bitter like an IPA, but more from it's roasted-ness. It's a well rounded brew that doesn't hide its hops or its malt. This was a wonderful find from which I will seek out from now on."
"Finally had this gem on cask as I was again in London just recently. Deep clear ruby color topped by an airy head. Lacing was bubbly and scattered in nice designs.Mild aroma of dark fruits and roasted malts. Similar palate with accent on ultra smooth and drinkable. Silky mouthfeel. As I said this was the first Winter Warmer I had on cask and of course with the new merger, it was brewed in the Wells Brewery which Young's now shares. Wonder how much better the Ram version was? Excellent beer."
"Somewhat of a dissapointment for a winter warmer. Was hoping for much more."
"D - Perfect. I don't know if this should be called a winter warmer though. I think is is more refreshing and quenching than it is warming. Low alc. level only increases drinkability, and the mixture of bready malts, roasty grains, and high doses of hops combines all of my favorite things into one outstanding brew. Well done!"
"Medium body, light-to-moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is thin, and somewhat watery. Doesn't really coat as the label suggests. ABV is pretty light for a winter warmer, so not much of a warming happening with this one. Plenty of better options out there."
"This is much anticipated each year--very spotty availability on tap and not too much better in bottles. I do like this brew very much--and that may be partly due to the annual anticipation. Bottled, it is not entirely unlike Theakstons Old Peculier--perhaps a bit dryer to my taste. From the tap it is a smooth, worthy pint though without a serious head and only light aroma. It's the taste that keeps me looking for it every year."
"Mouth: Not at all 'warm' in the sense one expects from a winter 'warm'er. Some light bitterness and dry at first, then dark coffee which I liked. Malt up front, banana & toffee, but too gentle and lacks commitment to any great flavor. Carbonated stimulation all the way through."
"Easy to drink - almost too much so for style. A decent brew, but not as hefty or as warming as it should be for a winter warmer. Still - worth trying."
"Pours a chestnut brown color with a creamy beige head. Nose is fruity along with some notes of butterscotch. Taste begins sweet and malty along with some dark fruit (figs and black cherries) and hints of vanilla. Spicy hops come across towards the end. A decent winter warmer brew."
"A good, dececent winter brew, not that heavy and quite sessionable."
"Drinkability - this is a good, but not great ale, which holds down sessionability for me."
"Good flavor, but not much warming and a weird overall feel."
"A low alcohol Winter Warmer  its just not warming. Well balanced but understated (i.e. bland). BJCP guidelines for WWs stipulate bigger than strong bitters and brown porters. Nope. It however makes a decent English Brown Ale. Its not bad, it just doesnt live up to its potential. I was expecting a Winter Warmer with some of that Double Chocolate spirit."
"A very malt-driven beer, to be sure. The hops are there, but there is a waxy quality to the mouthfeel that coats the tongue before I can really enjoy them. Not a bad tasting beer but I'm failing to detect some of the spice notes I expect from a winter warmer. If I were judging the beer on its own the score would be higher, but against the style it suffers."
"This isn't a bad beer, but with so many options out there, I fail to see any value in trying it again."
"I love winter warmers....most all of them...but not this one."
"Drinks okay, needs more malt heft, barely warms at all. Compared to most of the winter warmers out now, this is lower tier IMO"
"In general, average and middle of the pack."
"Nice pour, clear oak and a thick tan head. Now, downhill we go: just some subtle hints of spicy malts, cinnamon. Taste was flat and boring (nothing to describe). Actually a little harsh and unsavory. Again, a very surprising dead brew."
"It's fairly drinkable but I think I'd reach for one of the other seasonal holiday brews out there."
"Well hopped, lots carmel and sugar cane, some spiciness. Nice dark brown with white head. Chcolate malt and vanilla, Pineapple with apple and fruit. Sweetish nutty quaffable stuff though not something I'd have too frequent. Understated bitterness, carbonation, though drying aftertaste."
"Overall, a beautiful looking beer that delivers on taste yet still feels a bit too watery."
"Nice looking deep brown with a decent off-white head that lasts for a bit. Good malty scent in the nose. Great malt taste mixes with the alcohol quite well. Very tasty. Maybe a little watery, but not to distraction. Solid all around mouthfeel. Superbly drinkable. Goes down smooth for the style and gives you that nice warm feeling in your gut."
"An odd Winter Warmer, and lacks the usual warming characteristic, along with the complexity. Making this drink only mediocre."
"A good, solid English ale though a bit drier than most."
"A clear amber/red color, with a nice head that has a brown tinge to it. Not very carbonated. The smell is sweetness and alcohol. The taste is like amaretto, too sweet. Has a bit of nuttiness too, and a burny alcohol after taste that is surprising considering the low ABV. Not too enjoyable."
"This really doesn't appeal to me. As a ""Winter Warmer", it fails on all counts (Lacks a stiff malt presence, no alcohol warmth, not special in any character). It's not a special ale of any sort. The traditional soft mouthfeel of Young's is lacking. This tastes like a very average English Brown Ale. There are so many great winter seasonals out there (Goose Island, Summit, Sam Smith, in that order) that I'm compelled to never buy this again. A big letdown. Goose Island will get my money at Xmas time."
"The beer debarks the 500ml brown bottle a deep brown with a large frothy light tan head, upon the decomposition, the lace a thick and concealing sheet upon the glass. Nose is rich in malt, sweet, chocolate and vanilla, start is sweet and the grain profile delectable, top is moderate in feel. Finish is benign in its carbonation, the hops pleasing in their spiciness, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste, a beer I buy each year, a real treat in my books."
"A very nice beer from one of my favorite breweries. Winter warmers are generally not one of my favorite styles, but this is one of *the* best."
"Deap ruby almost brown color. Has a light tan creamy head with good retention. The aroma is slighty sweet and malty. The is a raw leafy hop behind the sweet aromas. The body is not as full as I expected. Buttery diacetyl hits the tounge at first. Caramel and some burnt sugar flavors. There is a raw leafy hop that comes through in the end. Finishes bittersweet. This is an ok Ale. At %5.2 alc by vol. It doesn't make a very warming winter ale either."
"Chestnut tea color with a smallish tan head which reduces to a ring around the top of the liquid. Looks nice but no lacing. Aroma is herbal and earthy. Hops are noticeable but there's also a nutty character in there as well. Flavors begin with a hoppy, fruit character. A bit of sweetness rides in but is soon cut out by the nutty bready element. There is a noticeable mineral water element in here which detracts the flavors a bit. Some grassy hops come toward the finish. I'm left with what seems to be a bit of a sweet flavor with caramel and butterscotch in the aftertaste. Alcohol is not really present at all and isn't this supposed to be a winter warmer? This is decent but nothing too good, I probably wouldn't recommend it."
"D - OK drinkability. I will be happy enjoying this once or twice a year."
"The mouth is a bit watery. Not a bad beer, just not exciting enough to bring me back in a hurry."
"Other comments: Not sure how ""warming"" this beer is, but it's nice. Not too bad."
"Attractive clear brown ale,with a large thick and creamy tan head. Slight aroma of nuttiness and soft warm malts. In taste this is a typical English ""strong"" ale, dark and malty..that typical English malt, slight hints of spiciness and a semi-sweet cane sugar taste. Pretty nice mouthfeel, maybe a wee bit thin but enjoyable none-the-less. Like most good English ales..drinkability is its strongest point..quite enjoyable."
"Picked this up over the holidays and had a chance to try it the other night. Pours a dark brown with a nice, thick head that stays around and leaves some lacing behind. The viscosity of this beer seems greater than might be expected giving it great appeal. Aromas of caramel, fruit candy, sugar, and candycane seem to come out nicely. The taste is a blend of these flavors with a subdued sweetness that grows as the beer warms. By the end of my pint, I had had enough of this sweetness as it left a bready, uncomfortable feeling in my mouth despite it's silky texture. The oversized bottle makes it difficult to want more and so the drinkability takes a hit, despite the lower ABV and full blast of sweetness."
"There's something artificial about the way this beer smells and tastes, which takes away from the drinkability, but it does look good."
"Opinion: Well, this beer fell short of my expectations. I think that it would have been fine if it had been more like 7% ABV instead of 5%. I think that the aroma and appearance is great, but the body and overall taste experience is pretty lame. Its not a bad beer for a session beer, but not one that I would call a warmer."
"Notes: I really enjoy that bready earthy quality that a good english beer often brings to the table. Kick some spices into this puppy and jack up the warming. It has a good base just needs some attention to detail."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- An immediate and quick rush of tongue-tingling carbonation dies a quick death... with no resolution or finale. It feels incomplete, and there is nothing to make me want another sip. For a winter warmer, this beer is comparitively thin and uninspiring.... I will pass next time."
"D - What tastes like a macro lager but costs five times as much? This beer was disappointing, for the price, it is a challenge to do any worse."
"There is a lack of alcohol here, but I'm sure you could drink enough to stay warm! This is worth a chance any time of year."
"¡Salud!"
"Of the winter warmers I've had, this is one of the better ones. Not quite as spicey as most. Pours out a deep mahogony, honey like color. Little head. The smell is a tad spiced. Smells similar to a good nut brown ale. The taste is, like noted before, not as spicey as usual beers of this style. The result, in my opinion, is a more drinkable beer. The mouthfeel is higher for this beer as a result. The drinkability is good as well. Of the Winter Warmers, this one is one of the more drinkable ones. I would buy another."
"Cheers!"
"As for a winter warmer... where's the warmth? (5% abv)"
"I know that some people are not so impressed by this beer but I find it pretty good. It smells like sweet rye bread with a twist of lime and some bread spices. The color is nice, dark amber and it pours with a finger of foam or so. The taste is more complex than the smell reveals: Coca Cola-candy (if you have ever had it), toffee, liqourice, ammonium chloride and and some cacao. A bitterness in the aftertaste. Great for those chilly winter evenings."
"Not a very strong or potent winter warmer - I'm used to the style being a bit more stout and potent. But decent nonetheless. I get the feeling that it's more commercial than craft, though it's not bad."
"Not a bad drinker by any means. Its quite nice, the malts keep a bit of warmth and soothing texture throughout each sip and/or gulp. Too bad the taste and flavors couldn't quite make a beefier approach on the Ol' taste buds."
"An enjoyable beer that you will probably desire more than once. High marks for drinkability."
"Young's WW is ruby brown in color with a tiny head which leaves just a thin whisp of foam. Aroma is lightly malty with just a touch of spice. The taste is primarily sweet, about medium in malt strength, with a spicy backbone that holds the beer together and adds some complexity. Drinkability is very good because of the low ABV for a winter warmer and the fact that the flavor isn't very ""big"". This works as more of a session winter warmer; this brew needs more clout to be a great one."
"16.9 oz. brown glass bottle. Pours a very murky maroon color, with a full inch of frothy off-white head. Smell is not very aparent, maybe a slight maltiness to it. Taste is buttery and slightly spicy, behind it are grassy euro malts. Slight medicinal flavors. Not bold in flavor, or high enough in ABV to be an upper eschelon winter warmer (isn't that the whole point of the style????). Still, not bad."
"Pours dark amber with ruby hues, classic lacing. Bready/malt infused nose. Nice malty brew, Brit style all the way. Spicing kept to a minimum. Notes of some herbs and also alcohol. Maple syrup and more malt in the center. Sweet and satisfying-well crafted brew. Well worth a visit on a chilly winters eve."
"Nice tasting beer, a classic for the style, and one I chose as the first of the night on the snowiest night of the year so far...but I have to reach for other choices to really bring on a toasty defense against Ol' Man Winter."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice malty scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a slight hop and fruity yeast aroma. The taste is good also. It has a creamy brown ale kind of feel to it. It goes down easy and finishes dry and slightly fruity. The mouthfeel lacks a little. It is a medium bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a good seasonal brew, except for the constant burping; an above average drinker."
"This brew pours a shadowy mahogany color with a cream-colored head of medium thickness. The aroma is sweet and almost fruity (dark cherries and ripe berries). Flavors of caramel, toffee, and a little butter mingle as well. The taste is sweet and delicately malty, with a mouth-filling body. Not much alcohol warming (if any) in this winter brew. Hops shine through in a lingering finish. This is a solid and enjoyable brew."
"A very ""big"" and nice beer. Warming ;) and very well balanced. Sadly though the weak smell makes the points go down."
"This is certainly not bad to drink and it could be a decent session brew, but for the price and the fact that it's name conjures up expectations utterly at odds with how this beer actually tastes. Decent, but not worth searching out, at least not at the price I paid for it."
"Too bad it is no longer being imported."
"Drinkability - The 25oz. bottle is the perfect serving size of this beer. It's maltiness and slight alcohol warmth makes it a great wintertime beer that deserves to be paired with a nice hearty meal."
"Pours a dark copper amber with a big 2 finger tan head that leaves spotty lace. Aroma is light mostly toasted caramel malt sweet with hints of spice. Taste is lightly toasted caramel malt light hints of spice mixed with grassy like hops. Overall flavor is ok but nothing to write home about not much to warm you in this beer. Mouthfell is around medium nice feel to it. Drinkability is good a decent ale. My past experiences with Young's have been excellent while this beer is drinkable nothing special going on here."
"The aroma was one of sweet, bready malts with hints fruits such as cherries. The fruitiness was definitely present in the taste as well. The body was not as full as I anticipated from the appearance and aroma but it was medium-bodied. This was a very flavorful, filling seasonal offering."
"All in all, not bad, but not what I thought of in a pale ale, nor was it very warming..."
"Twangy Burton ale waters jump out at you on this one. Nice, ""warming"" chicken-soup essence flows off the mid-taste and bathes the mouth with the most interesting diacetyl flavor (not sure if I'm a fan or not.) tinged with wood. Buttery diacetyl contributes prune, rather than raisin, finish."
"An absolute waste of money. This beer didn't even warm my pinky toe. It poured out like dense rust water, it had a nice head that stayed around for a little while and the nose had a few spicey notes of a higher alcohol beer but it only has 5%. The hops are persent but the body is lacking and it held a good carbonation. A decent beer that could be drank easily and regulary, but not what I think of as a winter warmer and not worth my $3."
"This bottle is a bit old. From the 2003 holiday season, the label says best before end of October 2004. Here we are in November, so maybe I should cut this one a little slack. Pours a dark caramel color with a small tan head. Aroma of roasted caramel malt and ale yeast, with slight hints of toffee and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is a tad thin for something that bills itself as a winter warmer. Palate is dominated by a strong roasted malt character, with notes of caramel and a touch of bitter hops. Bitterness lingers for a while. Though the first few sips didn't go down all that easily, after I got used to it, I could drink a good bit of this. Probably better when it's fresh."
"Pours a reddish brown with medium chocolate milkshake like head. Smell is fairly weak, but does hint at bready sweetness. Taste is malty with some chocolate, carmel and woody notes. A little bitterness in the back of the beer. Not really a warmer, but good none-the-less."
"Darker mahogany brown, clearish in appearance. Head rises high on a medium pour, an inch in height for almost a minute. Laces in larger dots, some connecting. Aroma is highly malty and sugary, cinnamon and a slight brightness peeks out. Nice mouthfeel, medium thinnish but with a smooth and creamy texture. Caramel dominates the flavor, of a darker variety with almost a coconut-like quality to it. Hops are minimal without any impact on overall impression. Aftertaste is pleasant, just a touch of fruitiness. Nice composition and drinkable, hardly a Winter Warmer in any aspects, but OK when you're in a mood for a malty fix in an easy-going United Kingdom manner."
"Feels and tastes like a much bigger beer than it actually is (in alcohol strength). This is one of my favorites of the Young line."
"I would not hesitate to drink this beer all night."
"Instantly forgettable. Not smooth enough to be good, flavors reminiscent of so many subpar beers. This is a let down through and through. Hops are abundant throughout the beverage, masking all other flavors. It begins and ends bitter with a bit of bitterness in the middle."
"Pours a dark brown with red hues. Big creamy tan head with good staying power, little lacing. Lightly malty, good hoppiness from start to finish. Its crisp, its dry, and fairly carbonated. It also had a little fruityness. Thought the alcohol would be a bit higher since the name is the Winter Warmer."
"Sampled 1/22/04"
"Very drinkable, but I know this could be better."
"Served out of a one pint+ bottle, this pours a muddy, deep brown with hues of orange throughout. Ivory head is quick to leave, and only spotty patches of lace remain. Aroma has toffee, molasses, and dark fruits. Bouquet is reminiscent of a doppelbock. Mouthfeel is malty, with good carbonation. Taste has a pleasant, malty dominance with plum and fig flavors. The malt is somewhat balanced with classic English hops and a hint of spicy bitterness. Finishes with a spicy maltiness, port wine undertones, and a spicy bitterness. An interesting variation of a fine British winter seasonal ale, that is a warming sipper on a snowy, February evening."
"A tasty brew, with great fruitiness and refined, subtle english hopping. I definitely prefer it from a non-nitro pour, but it's an enjoyable pint nonetheless."
"This beer poured out a deep and clear brown-cherry amber and was topped with a small pinkish head of foam. Small hints of bready sweetness in the aroma. The flavor has a cherry like dryness and is bittersweet. Interesting  A very bready and hearty beer with burnt fruit, bitter bark and woody notes. Like burnt pumpernickel toast. Light to medium bodied and finishes with a sweet pine sap bitterness. Complex and very flavorful. A nice winter warmer."
"Half-a-liter bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep brown color with one finger of head. There is just a little lacing left on the glass. The smell is sweet with caramel and toffee, very malty. The taste is malty and a little spicy, fairly sweet. A little tart on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly thick and strong. The drinkability is pretty good as well. It sure warmed me up on this cold winter night."
"Large foamy tan head that develops a slightly rocky top and a decent foamy lace. Deep clear reddish brown in color. Not much of an aroma, but what there is tends to be primarily of light caramel malts. Medium mouth feel that sometimes feels a bit on the light side. Light, sweet caramel malt start that is also bready in nature and a well-balanced and pronounced hop finished. Hops last long into the aftertaste. Not an overly complex or impressive yet is quite drinkable and well balanced. Not my favorite, but would probably make a good session brew."
"Appearance: Deep dark ruby amber builds a huge tan head atop the dark amber body leaves thick billowing lace bands. Aroma: Toffee finish is detectable in the nose with sweet plum layers and floral hop offerings, soild complex offering and I always thought winter warmers were high abv brews well this one will do it's job because it's very drinkable. Taste: Creamy chocolate like mix of malts dark roasts give it a nice full richness the fruit flavors that come through add to the festive attitude of the beer and the creamy finish is full of caramel malts blended with a piney hop finish. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied ale very full of flavor with a mild carbonation nothing is too much here. Drinkability: Excellent appetising ale from Young's rich flavors and perfect blend of the malts and hops adds to the pure ease of drinkability here."
"Calling this a ""winter warmer"" is a misnomer - while quite a good beer, this lacks the heft to deserve that name. Poured a hazy apple cider amber. Aroma was a bit fruity, with some overripe apple. Apple notes continued in the flavor, with toffee malt abounding. A very soothing, friendly beer, more appropriate for fall than winter. I would probably put this more in the ESB spectrum."
"A decent ale, nothing earth shattering and a bit of a let down for a winter seasonal as it is not very warming."
"Overall Impression: A nice big amber ale. The low alcohol, lack of spice or heavy hop leaves me a bit short of a Winter Warmer in my book. It does have a nice heavy feel and a good balanced taste. A good beer, just not terribly seasonal."
"Whilst this beer is good, it's not up to the standard set by other Young's brews, like the Double Chocolate and Oatmeal stouts. It poured a cloudy dark brown, with a fluffy off-white head. The aromas were faint, of malt and caramel. The tastes were also malt, caramel, and cola. The mouthfeel was smooth and light, and it finished with malt and a faint mild grapefruit. At only 5% ABV, it'd take a few of these to warm me up."
"Argh, what a swing-and-a-miss on this one! While the %ABV gave this winter warmer the potential to be a great session brew, it was too off-balance for me to enjoy. I would have been happy with a bitterness derived from citrus or pine flavor, but not metal. Not the beer for me, thanks."
"This beer is warming, cheery, well-balanced, and extremely drinkable. I'll be getting more."
"This was not what I was expecting from a ""Winter Warmer", but it was good nonetheless. It poured a dark mahogany color with a small head that remained as a thin layer of foam untill the last drop. The smell was very malty with a slight english hop smell to it and a touch of grain. I must say the smell did not excite me too much but the taste more than made up for it. As soon as it hit my mouth there was a very slight grainyness to it but that was soon overshadowed by a great semi sweet carmel like flavor. The finish had a touch of hops and a nice light sweetness, much more balanced than other english beers I've had. I can't say I'd have this one around all the time, but it is a good beer nonetheless."
"Tasty, but not my idea of a winter beer."
"A surprising beer for only 5% ABV. A nice almost old aleish taste about this beer makes it a nice winter beer. Not bad, and one I'd have again."
"This beer is so much better live and on-cask in England that it is hard for me to really make a comparison."
"I'm not sure that this would qualify as a ""Winter Warmer"" in my book, but I will defintely be drinking more of it, little distractions or no."
"This ale poured a clear, deep chestnut (red amber) with tan foam which was thin but persistent. The smell was slightly sweet malt with a bit of caramel and tanginess. The taste was malty with mildly bitter hops. There were faint chocolate and caramel nuances, very slight bitterness with a hint of spice. The mouthfeel was smooth but crisp with medium thin body and low carbonation and a lightly lingering flavor. This was a very nice ale with a somewhat surprisingly light body for a 'warmer'."
"Dark caramel color with some red highlights were the light sneaks through. Topped with a big fat, thick beige head that sits on top of the glass like whipped cream, and leaves thick lacing and rings around the glass as I drink. Aroma is low and malty. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, just the right amount of carbonation, with a substantial body. Flavor is not overly spicey, but has hints of many flavors like cinnamon and malt and caramel and fruit that morph into one indescribable flavor. Very enjoyable beer."
"Notes: Like many British ales, blissfully flavorful for the ABV; there are tastier winter seasonals to be had, but this is certainly well worth the try."
"Pours a copper brown witha thick tan head. Malt seems to dominate the aroma; throw in some underlying Christmas-type spices and a faint bit of nobles, and you have Young's winter seasonal. Very drinkable. Very malty and smooth. Mild chocolate notes and some spice comes through in the taste. Mouthfeel's good. Could drink this all night."
"Pours a medium brown with some reddish hints with a nice creamy sticky head,aroma is of brown sugar and raisins with some Xmas spices in there pretty appetizing.Taste is kinda yeasty with some fruitcake spice flavors but not overly sweet.I like this beer more than others I like the holiday spice flavor that doesnt overpower."
"Not quite up there with other winter warmers, and doesn't stand up as well as Young's other offerings, but I still liked it."
"Drinkability was ok, but the flavor was just a bit odd. The name Winter Warmer was a bit deceiving as the alcohol was just average.I love Young's Stouts, so I was just a bit dissapointed in this offering."
"A murky bronze ale with a small and fleeting head of off-white bubbles. No lace to speak of from this ale. The nose is mostly of yeast and a bit grassy. The flavor is malt and yeast notes and the feel is somewhat peppery and moderately full. Fair drinkability but this brew seems a bit atypical of the style."
"F"
"Medium Amber brown color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and sweet. Medium bodied ""amber"" ale. Mild caramel-chocolate malts. Slightly hoppy. Full flavor, full body. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter"
"Had this from the bottle recently. Pours a dark amber color with a decent head and a moderate amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is fairly week with just a little maltiness being detectable. The flavor didn't scream ""winter warmer"" to me. It seemed a little weak and didn't have any kick to it as I expected that it should have. It was very well balanced and smooth to drink, but it seems to be lacking that little bit of bite that I think something called a winter warmer should have."
"This brew poured a small head of fine to medium light brown bubbles and a cloudy brown body. It has a very plesant malt spice aroma. The first taste showed a slightly tingling mouthfeel and a flavor of spices. After the tingling dies down, a nice roasted caramel flavor takes over. They blend very nicely into one another. A very decent brew that I found myself continuously sipping on."
"When this brew was poured into my glass, it poured with a small tan head with fine-medium bubbles that quickly dissipated. The lacing was sparse on the sides of my glass. The body was brown in color and there was carbonation observed rising to the top. It had a fruity aroma and a smooth and buttery taste."
"This tan/oxblood Winter brew is topped by a fast fading beige head with sliding lace. The aroma is of caramel malt, fresh hops and pears. Sweet barley malt is almost oily slick. Full bitter tea-like and lightly citrus hops and berries. So creamy smooth rich and molasses-like sweet. Complex and pleasing from beginning to end."
"Pleasant, but uninspiring malt taste. Maybe a bit less carbonation than average. Brief hop presence, but on par with the levels of malt and bubbles. One of the more well-balanced beers I've had in some time. Doesn't appear to be a high alcohol brew, I could drink it all night and be a very happy camper, but I think I was hoping to be able to drink it all night and then just pass out. :-) Just kidding. A wonderfully drinkable beer that would be a nice seasonal to indoctrinate a Millcoorweiser fan."
"sipping beer."
"As I continue through the pint, I'm noticing that the biscuit flavour grows. To me, this feels like a nice lunchtime brew and a decent mild brown ale, refreshing. I like this beer, though I definitely dispute the ""Winter Warmer"" moniker -- it has neither the alcoholic warmth or the rich body that really warms me up."
"This was the Sale Ale at the Saucer so maybe it was just old. There were three of us who ordered it tonight. I got mine first. Mine had no head. It had no aroma. It had no real taste. Maybe a little malt but that was after much discussion with the other two folks. There's were much like mine. Maybe it was old beer. It was barely worth the $2.50 we paid. Not really drinkable. BLAND in all aspects."
" Imports of the same price are of a much higher caliber and complexity than this beer. Maybe if Youngs Winter warmer had a little more of what made it strange and a little less water it could be quite interesting."
"There's a little dust in the smell, along with grapes, some toasty grain and an unidentifiable sharp sweetness in the background. The front is malty, but light. The middle shows toffee and molasses, but I'm a little disappointed at the thinness. The finish is ""English dry"" with that slight sourness. Overall, it's ok, but it doesn't warm me much this wintry week."
"Poured a clear deep garnet color. Decent head with clingy lace. Kind of tasted a little carmel like with a roasted malt flavor. I tasted more sweetness than hops in this one. Medium mouthfeel. It didn't taste bad, but there wasn't anything really unique about this beer."
"(16.9 oz)"
"Reddish brown in color, topped by an off-white head that settles and disappears quickly. Not a big aroma, some sweet and grainy maltiness and a touch of hoppiness. Possibly some spiciness. The taste is more up-front and full, but it's still a medium-bodied brew. Very malty, sweet and slightly caramelly, grainy, and a bit bready. Hops are detectable here and there, a bit floral, nothing major. This reminds me of Sam Adams Winter Lager, but it's not quite as good. It is a good and drinkable beer, but I wouldn't call it a winter warmer."
"Dark and murky orange-brown body with a big, fat, creamy tan head. Head retention is exceptional, and leaves think splotches (not quite rings) of foam on the side of the glass. Smooth malty aroma, with notes of spicy, herbal hops, yeast, and light hints of fruity (sort of apple-like, but not quite), with some slight barnyard aromas floating around. Caramel malt dominates the flavor, with some hop bitterness blending with a hint of fruit in the finish. Finish is clean, and fairly dry. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, moderately bodied. Not a bad brew, really. Just doesn't really stand out."
"Nice ram-encrested 500ml bottle. A bright copper body shines beneath a large foamy cream-coloured head. Away from the light, it is more of a brown-ruby body. Attractive either way. Aroma is yeasty, floral, and some darker fruits. On the tongue, sweet caramel, some light fruitiness, a pinch of sulfur, hops subdued in the background. Almost no aftertaste at all. Swallow and disappears. Though labeled ""Winter Warmer", there is no real sensation of a heavy alcoholic presence. Not bad, but I thought it had more ""oomph"" to it in prior years."
"This beer is a murky looking deep dirty brown color. A slight caramel brown film coats the surface. Sweet malt, perfume and herbal hop tones on the nose. Sweet candy like malt tones mix with the herbal, earthy and pefumey characteristics of the hops to create an interesting flavor even if it's not particularily to my liking. Some slight bread tones and a very slight bitter astringency on the aftertaste. It seems as though I remember liking this beer a lot more in years past, but it's just not that great this time around."
"Cheers"
"Pours scarlet amber with good off-white head that sticks around for a little while; some effervescence as well. Smell is quite weak, making it hard to pick apart. Some notes of grain and alcohol dryness. Taste is likewise not bad, just uninspiring. Semisweet grains at the start yield to a finish consisting of some bitter alcohol warmth and a touch of yeastiness. Mouthfeel is a bit too sticky, but drinkability is OK."
"el_mocoso"
"Brown and tan color. Good head that laces well to the finish. Yeast aromas accompanied by hop scents. Sweet taste toffee like. Malt taste is present but not demanding. Low hop profile. Juicy flavor overall. No one dimension or flavor commands this one, nothing takes charge. Nor, does any combination accelerate this beer. It lacks character and depth as it also doesnt not offer much face value or façade. Not worth going out your way to try, but fun to try it if you happen about some."
"There are hints of fruit in the aroma which come through after a hearty pour. Minimal head, although better than some English ""warming"" ales, the ale itself generally lacks everything that Young's is generally know for --- pungent aroma, bold character, and a pleasing quality."
"Young’s Winter Warmer: On tap. Cripes, very disappointing. I’m not saying that this is not a fine beer, there is no macro that can hold the faintest candle to it. The problem is, its running up against beers with tremendous character (Samichlaus Bier Sam Adams Winter Lager/ Old Fezziwig, Goose Island X-mas) and this has been tasted and found wanting. Deep dark color, but lacking a spice aroma and flavor. Bring it out in the fall."
"I poured a nice brown hue and was clear with off white foam. The smell and taste was what I expected. It was sort of fruity with a grainy aftertaste to match the slight bitterness. Although it was a nice mellow ale, I just couldn't rate it any higher, because, the taste dissapated and was gone after tasting. A short finish I feel was the back breaker of this ale!"
"Taste begins with dark malt with a slightly nutty quality, dark fruit notes in the middle of the taste, towards the finish a strong and lingering bitter hop flavor appears. This beer is probably better consumed at celler, rather than refrigerator temperatures, it improved in flavor and aroma as it warmed. Still, not as much character as some of the other seasonal beers."
"Attractive clear ruby hue, topped by a sticky, thick light tan head that leaves loose lace. Signature Young's yeast strain's fig like fruit esters combined with diacetyl butterscotch and notes of caramel and chocolate. Hint of treacle. Caramel malt and roasted grain dominate the flavor profile, with fig and darker prune like fruitiness adding depth. Lightly hopped, and although dry and well attenuated, significant residual sweetness remains unhindered. Lightly bodied, but dextrinous enough in mouthfeel to help maintain its excellent drinkability. Subdued earthy hop flavor. Finishes clean and lightly roasty. Not my idea of a winter warmer, but rather a refreshing, fruity session brew with enough dark malt character for some complexity. Certainly a tasty example of an underbrewed style."
"A very fine brew from Young's, one of the most under-appreciated breweries in the world, overall. This pint poured a beautiful dark amber color as I am expecting a typical witer/seasonal brew. Oh, no. This bier has character, good flavor with hints of sweet and savory spice, and even has a respectable head that lingers for some time. Well worth trying out. Prost!"
"Great from the Bottle, but you know what  this beer is to die for on Cask!!!"
"Drinkability: Well, it's not bad...there are just so many winter warmers out there that are so much better. This is a very average brew...don't go out of your way to sample it."
"Pours a dark brownish/amber with a medium off-white head. The smell is very faint only revealing light notes of a semi-sweet fruit. The taste consists of light hops, malts, and again faint fruitiness with a toffee finish. Very light bodied which wasn't really what I was expecting from a winter brew, and it finishes slightly dry. Not bad, but definitely subpar for Young & Co! Cheers!"
"I remember that the first time I tried this beer I was geared-up expecting a rich, creamy maltiness... only to be let down. Now that I'm familiar with it I appreciate it more, but still tend to pass it by in lieu of more full bodied beers. That said... It pours a slightly hazy chestnut body that's capped by a decent sized, creamy, tan head that holds OK - but drops to a thin collar and whispy surface foam. The nose offers the standard fruity Young's character with notes of berries, raisins and plum above a mild caramel maltiness. The hops are restrained to the background in the aroma, but move forward in a flavor that's fruity and lightly caramelish - quite toffee-like - with a firm earthy & grassy hoppiness. It finishes dry with some softly lingering fruit and malt. Neither rich nor complex, but still an enjoyable pint at the local. As with almost all of the Young's products, it should really be served at close to cellar temperature to best perceive its maltiness and the interation of the yeast's fruitiness."
"The beer starts well, with a dark brown/ruby color, topped by a thin, light tan, creamy head.  The aroma is yeasty, with earthy tones and hints of fruit.  The smell is a bit rough, but like most English ales, this benefits from considerable warming before smelling or tasting.  The taste starts of with bubblegum like notes, followed by a light malty sweetness.  Hops are noticeable throughout, but fairly rough.  Medium-bodied, with what I can only describe as a somewhat watery aftertaste.  I understand the disappointment many feel with this beer, labeled as it is as a ""winter warmer.""  That label evokes thoughts of a beer suitable for quiet sipping with book in hand and fireplace by one's side.  This is certainly not that sort of beer.  It would, however, show quite well to a big winter meal -- game or ham perhaps."
"Dark copper color with thick everlasting head. Very yeasty aroma that is comparable with its flavor.  Off balance hops that makes it finish somewhat alcoholic but rich. Not the best dark ale, but worth a try."
"Pours with a big brown head.  Clear dark brown in color.  Smells malty sweet, yeasty, with a touch of banana (kind of odd).  Tastes nutty bitter, kind of fruity, seems a little watery compared with other winter warmers.  Medium light body.  Not bad, but a bit on the bland side."
"I usually love Young's products but I was disappointed with this one.  I expected a much more robust ale.  Poured nicely with a nice creamy head...mahogoney redish in color..smells fruity, and the first taste I got was a fruity one..cidery....Some mild hop bite on the back of the tounge but not heavy on the hops...Pretty smooth drinking, but the fruity/cidery/ thin character was not what I expected and overall I was disappointed.  Still, not a horrible beverage by any means."
"Notes: Very English in taste, but not very impressive if compared to other Winter Warmers or Young's other brews. Yeasty all over, and not at all warming."
