"Crisp!  Fruit (Apple) notes on the palate, medium bodied with no lingering finish going down."
"Flavor and color were great, but I was expecting more body, maybe a bit more spice as well (The name of the brew is ""Cabin Fever"" after all). Overall, solid!"
""
"A solid Winter Warmer Ale."

"An excellent winter warmer for a cold night indeed.  Great flavor and look-the smell is actually better, somehow.  Excellent like all other BBC ales I've had."

"Very subtle flavor. Nothing special"

"Appearance is dark tan/brown color with a tan head that leave trails. The smell is a lot of malt and a little heavy. The taste is all malt and very warm. Gives hints of caramel and vanilla but isn't too sweet. Very nice, clean, aftertaste. The mouthfeel was also nice, not to thick but still had a nice body about it. Overall I really enjoyed this one."

"This is a very satisfying example of the style. Its above average ABV creates a warming factor and yet is still masked by the complex flavor profile. Hits the spot on a cold night."

"O - reminds me of Highland's Gaelic, with a touch of spice. Solid offering and is recommended."

"Yet another tasty offering from BBC. I got this beer as a sample from my store and as we all know, there’s nothing better than free beer. Actually I stand corrected, there’s nothing better than free, GOOD beer! This beer is bready, sweet and leaves a bit of cinnamon spice on the tongue, but it isn’t overwhelmingly sweet as are the majority of winter warmers that I’ve tried. It’s just about Spring time but not quite and this is a pleasantly timed winter beer on a cool night — after a VERY hard day of work — while watching Louisville battle for their second championship win in a row!"

"O: This is, in my opinion, the epitome of the style. It's exactly what I expect and look for when I want to drink a beer like this. I don't want a spice bomb. This is perfect for the season and a great beer by itself. Well done Berkshire!"
""

"O: The yeastiness is a bit strong in the aroma, but besides that this is tasty and drinkable."

"O/D-At first I was a bit unimpressed, but when I started to understand the beer's curves and intricacies, I really started to enjoy it. A mix between an English Pale Ale and a Spiced Ale. I will definitely remember this one. It really grew on me. By the time I was halfway done with the bomber, my fondness for this beer increased twofold."
"Cheers"

"O - Good! A nice combination of maltiness and fruity/spicy hops for a winter offering. Better than the average indeed."
""
"O- not my cup of tea - I'm not a big fan of spiced beers, so I will not hold that against it, but the taste is kind of weird. I swear it smells like a bloody mary. Would like more maltiness perhaps."

"Nice beer, but a bit odd for me to describe."

"overall- a nicelly crafted beer with simple but satisfying flavor, drinkable not as heavy as some of the other bbc beers"

"Pours a dark reddish brown color with ruby hues in the light. About an inch of off-white head develops and hangs around for some time, forming pillowy patches as it dissipates. Patches/strands of bubbles lace the glass. The aroma is of english malt, date, vague citrus (predominantly orange), caramel, cocoa nibs, and german lager yeast/spices. The taste begins with the english malt and lager flavors, moves into citrus and muddled spice, and finishes with a strong caramel malt, dark fruit, and faint chocolate presence. It is a bit underwhelming at first, but more impressive on the finish. Mouthfeel is of mild carbonation (a touch more wouldn't hurt), smooth texture, and a bit dry/syrupy on the finish (not overly so, but noticeable). Overall, a good winter warmer that I'll enjoy sipping on for the rest of the evening."
""

"D - pretty mediocre, the spice character is bland and other than that there really isn't much going on."
""
"Like this beer alot. Glad it is reasonably priced and widely available around town for a long time each year."
"Overall: A very nice and very good winter warmer. It's certainly different from other ones that I've had and better since the citrus taste is absent."
""
""
""
"I think I'll be picking up a growler of this on my way home."
""

"Rich flavor with a nice smooth finish. pours light brown in color with about a finger of head. Another excellent craft beer from Berkshire Brewing and at a very reasonable price."
"O - Overall I enjoyed this offering from BBC. Always good to support local and this one is that."

"The beer pours a light light reddish brown color with a nice off white head. The smell is slightly sweet with hints of spice but not overpowering. The flavor follows suit with the beer having the body and some what the flavor of a red ale with slightly sweet and light spicey notes. The body is medium with good carbonation. Overall a food winter warmer without being over powering like harpoon"
"O: decent beer, not amazing, though I had it 3 months beyond the freshness date on the bottle. So next year I will have a fresh one and we will see what happens."
"Pours a bright light brown color with a single-finger off-white head that has some spotty lacing. The nose carries a bit of light caramel and some bread, not too much else. The flavor is equally bland. Some bread. Maybe bread crust, too. Yay! Not much in the way of spicing, so at least it's not overspiced. Medium body and quite chewy. Blah."
"Looks nice, reddish in color. off-white head. Smells malty and yeasty. Taste like an Alt beer yeast, perhaps an English yeast. Caramel and toasty malt flavors. End of the sip is a little strange. Mouthfeel is full and smooth. Bitterness is very smooth as well. Alcohol is masked well. Warming without burning. Definitely malt dominant in flavors happening. I enjoy a winter beer that isn't over the top spiced out. tastes pretty good."
"EDIT-> Upon examining the label, ""Its rich malt profile is reminiscent of an English Pale Ale"" Aha!"
"Overall - I think this is a home run from Berkshire. I am a fan of their Pale ale and with the snow we're getting in CT, I figured this one would go well with today. I'm so glad I picked it up. This is an easy drinking, almost pale ale like beer, with some spicy hop notes that appear in the finish. Another Delicious beer from Berkshire. Well done! I only wish I purchased more of this, earlier in the winter season."
"Drinkability - An easy drinking winter warmer. Waves of smooth malty goodness to make the short days and long nights of winter more doable."
"D: This beer is enjoyable, but one is enough for me. I find it to be a filling beer (although I am enjoying it over a meal). On it's own, I can see myself drinking a full 22 oz bottle."
"Overall: a nice brew, definitely one I could have a few of in a night. This beer satisfies in the biting winter cold without having high ABV or super full body."
"It poured a hazy light brown with plenty of lacing and foam. The smell is all malt with some caramel aroma. The taste is filled with malt, caramel, and some earthiness, probably from the yeast (I'm guessing English). It's not sweet though, they do a great job balancing it all even though it's malt heavy. I really plowed through this 22oz bottle and enjoyed every sip. I will defintely have this one again."
"nice beer to enjoy a few on a cold winters eve."
"not what I would hope for"
"Enjoyed while on a trip to Boston -- great opportunity to drink a local brew! A nicely-balanced ale with a spicy and fruity hop finish. Also carries a nutty flavor. Copper-amber in color, but mildy cloudy. I gave a little ding to appearance because of cloudiness -- a clear beer is an important attribute to me. A quality beer at an affordable price."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied. This is good, drinkable beer that goes down well and has just a small aftertaste."
"Drink is decent, no real booze taste for a winter beer, light malts, a bit of sweetness and sticky finish."
"As usual, a solid offering from Berkshire. Enough complexities and flavor to keep you sipping."
"DB- Pretty good, better than the winter seasonals I am used to. Instead of going over the top with spice it is just a nice regular ale."
"It's local, it's cheap, and it's good. It's overall a good beer and worth trying for sure."
"Easy to drink. Might even do with a bit more booze in it. Smooth but lacks the punch I wanted. Nothing super distinctive, but a winner just the same. Very worth the try."
"Overall, not a bad winter warmer. Reminded me a lot of a young old ale, still pretty hoppy. It was rather quick drinking. Above average, but nothing I would actively seek out."
"Pours deep reddish brown. Not much of a head and subpar lacing as well. Sweet malt and fruity aroma. Begins with a nice caramelized sugar malt. Malt gives way to a good kick of fruity flavor, almost fruit punch like. Winter and grassy spices finish the beer out, especially as it warms. Tasty, sweet combination."
"D- This beer was drinkable. Not my favorite from Berkshire from what I have had but hey you can't win all the time now can you?"
"drinks ok. nothing special, but nothing terrible either. really reminds me of an octoberfest with winter spices added."
"M/D - Ends dry. Light to medium body. Not too complex, but pretty enjoyable."
"Curious to try this one fresh, or at least unturned. Other reviews seem interesting, but I guess reviewing something blind... drinking the beer is all you have to go on."
"D: A solid beer. I'd definitely drink it again."
"Winter warmer? Bah! Dial it down a notch or two & BBC would have a nice, easy-drinkin' summer beer for the porch. I am pleasantly surprised, very good beer."
"Overall I will pass. It was not terrible by any means, just not what I had in mind."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it had some nice malty flavors to it and the spices weren't overdone. Pretty enjoyable brew that would fit nicely with a cold winter night."
"This is a tasty beer, no doubt. Good balance, nice nuttyness that pokes through."
"Overall I would say this is a high quality beer, and I would get this again."
"A great seasonal single. You could learn a lot about winter in Western Mass from the character of this beer. It is rich, warm, sweet and soothing.You stretch it out, curled up on a couch. It comforts - it mellows. Suddenly, you don't want to eat your housemates - you're too full of malt! And that snowdrift that ate your car...eh, you'll get it tomorrow."
"22 oz. bottle, poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass (a couple of times). Has a big frothy head sort of a creamy light orange color. It sticks around for awhile and produces some very generous lacing to it. The lacing really adds to the effect on this one, it sticks to the glass extremely well. The beer itself looks a little lighter than several winter warmer's I've had, but still quite nice looking. A light amber color at first and when held to the light looks orange with a medium haze to it. I've seen good looking IPA's, even DIPA's look like this in the past, an interesting approach. The smell is good for a winter warmer. Pine hops stand out the most, but you can tell it's very well malted as well, caramel if I'm not mistaken. Most are generally very malty, but this takes a more well balanced approach. In the taste you get more of a malty flavor. Sweet malts, caramel and chocolate well roasted and then a mild pine and citrus blend of hops, tastes even a little herbal. Mouthfeel is good, could be great if it was a little heavier/bolder. Medium overall with a nice clean bitter finish from the hops and very drinkable. Another solid brew from Berkshire."
"Drinkability is very good. A 22oz is just the right size for a 'one beer on a weeknight' kind of night. I could have this again."
"D: This is a easy drinking winter warmer. Nice spice flavor without being overpowering. And at 6.30%, this is a great session beer. Another solid offering from BBC."
"22oz. bottle served in my BBC pint. Poured a translucent copper with a loose, quarter inch bright white head quickly dissipates into a skim and a bubbly band around the edges. Subdued nose - just the slightest hint of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice). Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also some citrus in the mix on a pleasantly malty backbone. Mouthfeel is medium-light and lively with a little prickliness at the back of the throat. Really quite delicious and nicely balanced for the style."
"D- Dangerously drinkable session brew for the cold winter months. This one goes down easy and without complaint, and its sweet fruity taste hides its 6.3% ABV enough that I would not call this a slow sipper."
"Paired really nicely with lemon-brushed shrimp cocktail with a nice horseradish sauce and cream cheese covered in hot pepper relish."
"Tasted like an english ale with a lighter body, some doughy yeast, and more fruitiness to it. Finishes very dry with a tannic presence. Really seems so carbonated, I wonder if it is finished with a champagne like yeast. Very light in body, so light that it is surprising for a 6.3% abv beer. It is very drinkable because of this, but slightly not my style."
"It's easy to drink, and it doesn't feel like a high ABV beer, but I wouldn't order another. It's too lifeless and boring because of the over attenuation. It has some good qualities but fails to come together."
"Berkshire's website describes Cabin Fevers as: ""think of an English ale dry hopped with German Tettnang hops."" I find that an apt description but I was thinking if a Bass ale spent some time in the gym, maybe got a facial, balanced it's diet and maybe got a mani and pedi; it would taste like Cabin Fever. Aroma is prickly pepper noble hop and fruit aplenty. Taste is a similar English fruit explosion with some light toffee--almost like a Christmas fruitcake. Really, really, really clean."
"Drinkability: I don't think I will ever be dissapointed by a BBC brew, this must be the 9th BBC beer I've tried and have still yet had one I didn't like. An excellent Winter Warmer that features a good balance, and the light fruitiness holds up nicely against this subtle malt backbone. Good drinkability considering the 6.3% ABV and this one could be sessioned with ease. Can't wait to revisit this one on a cold winter night!"
"I'm a fan of this beer. I like BBC's products and put this on tap at home without having tried it an am glad I did. I think it offers a nice, light holiday-beer alternative for people who aren't interested in a heavy bodied or over-spiced beer (two items I like). I expect this beer to go fast."
"Good stuff. Toasty and spicy, with a bit of warming beef to the body, this is a solid cooler weather sipper."
"Clear, nearly bright, amber colour with a short cap of fine light beige bubbles. Good head retention with a bit of spotty lacing. Looks nice. Caramel aroma, some biscuity and bready malts, with a slight spice. Fairly mild though, with little in the way of hops. Bitterness was on the low side, which let the buttery caramel flavour dominate. Mild spice (ginger or nutmeg perhaps?) with a bit of hop flavour mid-palate. Slightly peppery in the finish. Medium to full bodied with carbonation on the low side of average. Not quite slick in texture, but close. Warmth wasn't evident on the palate, but I could feel it in my belly. Pretty solid overall."
"Thanks go out to brothercannon for bringing me this, and a slew of other Berkshire bottles back for me from VT. Poured from a 22 ounce bomber bottle into my nonic Imperial pint glass. The ale appears a hazy tarnished copper color with about an inch of fluffy off white foam. A nice layer of sticky lace clings to my glass with each sip. Nose and flavor are of mild spices, toffee, a touch of black pepper, maybe some nutmeg, a bit fruity, and some floral hops. Bordering near full bodied for the style with ample carbonation. Tasty stuff, thanks again Tim!"
"Final Thoughts - I like BBC a lot. Their bombers are decently priced, and their brews are wonderful. They show a level of craft and love that makes me happy to purchase it time and time again."
"Overall: Not as spiced as most winter warmers, which is actually refreshing. I'm not often a fan of the style, and this is an exception for me."
"Not spiced very much for a winter warmer which for me is a plus. This is a good beer that I will visit again next year."
"This one shows a cloudy amber brown color with a fair sudsy tan head and decent lacing. The aroma gives me grapey wheat with a hint of malt and maybe some nutmeg. The taste is oak and grass and dry malt with a hint of citrus hops. It's a medium body brew with fine carbonation. Reasonable drinkability, a bit peppery. Not really calling out for high volume by my tastebuds. Not bad."
"A good brew. Pair it with a nice winter stew or a game dinner. Here's to the folks at BBC, reminding me that sometimes being stuck at home in snow means cabin fever is a good thing."
"Yum. A nice brew that keeps the inards warm on a breezy winter day."
"Poured a healthy amber-brown color, with an off-white head that left a nice lace across the top. The smell was rich and complex: plenty of malts up front, with a caramel sugariness at the end, plus some earthy hops, and a smokey, savory flavor that escaped me (could it be tobacco?). The taste was dominated by complex layers of different kinds of malts. The taste had a buttery flavor to it, plus a pinch of sweetness and a pinch of nuttiness. However, there was a hop bitterness that balanced the flavor. That being said, the aftertaste, which lasted for a long time was a little stale to me, and tasted a little wooden. The mouthfeel was about right, appropriately thin and carbonated. It wasn't my favorite example of this style, but it was a nice sipper."
"An easy drinker for a Winter warmer that is not too high in alcohol content...just about right, cheers."
"After a couple not so great reviews, I was starting to worry...Alas, it brought me here to another great Berkhire Brewery offering. The Berkshire Coffee is simply great and i was hoping here for the same. A nice dark brown pour with ruby hints and short tan head & porter-like lacing. The overall aroma hinted at a spiced winter porter, with smoked spice malt & subtle fruit & citrus. The feel was silky & complex while the flavor had good malt with just enough hop-bitterness, mild smoke, black coffee & a hint of toffee. Not too sweet or spicy, a lovely warming ale!"
"It's nice to find a good beer at a good price for once. It's also nice that it's local."
" A beer made for winter? ""cabin fever""...seems like it should be a decent malt bomb with a warming effect, I can't even detect any alcohol in the flavor, not bite, no warming. Oh well."
"Very comfortable winter seasonal brew. Might benifit from an increased ABV to get a warmer fealing, or one could put another log on the fire and enjoy a few more!"
"Mouthfeel is a lighter medium body which adds to the drinkability. I think this one would age nicely."
"D: Pretty drinkable beer. I liked the flavors and the way that the whole beer blended together. Nicely done."
"D- Easy drinking winter warmer. Not the best, but certainly respectable."
"Pretty drinkable, but also, not very exciting."
"Off the tap at the Daily Planet in B-town this beer was a hazy, dark garnet color. The head was tan with some reddish hues and retained very well as a thin cap and laced in broken curtains. The aroma was caramel malt, some ripened fruit and yeast. The flavors were similar, pale malt and caramel malt sweetness with notes of vanilla, a little yeast twang, something akin to strawberry yogurt (seriously, Yoplait - so weird!) and it finished on a hint of hops. The body was medium, the mouthfeel creamy and the carbonation good. Quite enjoyable."
"Had on tap at Union Brewhouse. poured into a shaker pint- ours a hazy brown with a thin off white head. SMells off candied malt. Taste is very mellow. SOme caramel, with a finishing kick of cinamon and spices. Very creamy mouthfeel and very drinkable. Good beer for these cold winter months."
"A nice offering from BBC, but not as nice as the others in their line. The aroma was filled with autumn smells like leaves, bread and tobacco. The body was quite smooth-- perhaps it could have used a tad more carbonation-- and the malt was front and center. The alcohol level was just high enough to add some warmth-- it was just right, in fact. Still, I felt like something was missing. Perhaps it could have used a little bite? More hops to give it a little boost? This was almost monochromatic. A little more balance in the taste would vault this into the A level for me. Still, if you're a BBC fan like me, you'll want to try this."
"Feel is malty and the body is what I would expect for the style. Sweetness is getting in the way of the drinkability though."
"A pretty decent beer."
"The feel is medium bodied; a nice milky, creamy thickness on the way down. It's a really easy drinking beer with goo dbody and balanced roasted/sweet flavors. Top notch."
"Drinks pretty easy, hides the abv fairly well. An English-slanted winter warmer that has some warmth to it as it opens up"
"The name kind of threw me here. When I read it for some reason I thought of American Pale Ale. However, the taste did not match that all. So I had to go to Beer Advocate to figure this one out. There is absolutely no hoppiness in here. This is very much a malty beer. There is a hint of citrus in here but the over all taste is malt. The pour is a hazy amber with a lot of head. As the beer sits carbonation sit continues after the pour. I really don't get any thing strong here in the smell. This would be a good session beer. Nothing over whelming or worth noting here."
"A malt-accented brew with enough juicy hop support to keep it tasty and balanced. Very easy to drink - a winter brew I could drink year-round."
"Pours a cloudy brown color, nice carbonation, nice small one-finger creamy tan head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, sweet, with a nice touch of caramel. The taste is sweet/malty, very slight spice, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a pretty tasty brew. Glad to have had a chance to try it. Thanks Stan and Andrew."
"Great aroma and flavor make this beer a great choice if you can find it."
"Overall a very tasty and highly drinkable winter warmer."
"This beer is a nice surprise. It pours a slightly cloudy dark amber with some off white head with some froth on the soapy side of the continuum. The beer retains a bit and does lace. The smell is bready malts and holiday spices: nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and perhaps a touch of coriander. The taste is very nice in that you'll find a nice balance between the hoppy dryness and the malty sweetness, laid over a spicy base as listed above. The beer is light to medium bodied and decently carbonated. There is some caramel, and flattish cola hints in this beer, which is typical of spiced beers that begin to settle a bit. The mouthfeel is a bit sharp and there is some aftertaste. The beer isn't brilliant, but it is good. L'Chaim."
"Poured from a 22 ounce bottle straight into a pint glass. Right off the bat I noticed that the head was thick and creamy. The top of the glass was a dark brown the seems to lighten towards the bottom. Great head retention throughout the whole glass. The smell is very sweet, but a little hoppy as well. Reminds me of a Winter Warmer or Sam Adams Winter, but a bit better. I would definately buy this again, but it is something that is a bit hard to find."
"The perfect winter warmer would have the right balance of malt and spices. This one is balanced and still quite above other versions of the style."
"Bought their 22 oz. A hazy, amberish color with a thin head pours out from their bottle. Very thin aromas of caramel and malt. making it not too strong but also less attractive. A nice taste though, a little sweet and spicy. It's crisp with medium carbonation, making it relaxing and refreshing. Though it lacks a wicked punch smell/taste wise, this is a nice drink."
"Not really a session beer, or a sipping beer. This beer does enjoy being consumed, can't figure out exactly why, but it is."
"This one is solid in all areas. It's not the cream of the crop for Berkshire, but it's still nice and drinkable and definitely worth a shot as it's a basic but tasty brew."
"Attractive coppery color with a big yellowsh head that fell quickly, leaving little behind -- spotting on the glass. Smells faintly of caramel malts, sour cider, and a bit of spice. Tastes very good -- the sweet (caramel apple) is tempered with sourness, delicately bitter hops, and a tasteful amount of spice (nutmeg & cinnamon). The body might be a little too heavy and syrupy if it were less carbonated, but they pull it off. After one bomber, though, I think I'm ready for something else. A nicely made warmer from the BBC - ranks favorably with most examples of the style!"
"Drinkability: nice for a pint on a cold evening, but more than one or two in a session would not be my choice. A nice flavored winter beer that is just spiced enough without being offensive."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, just a little filling, good representation of style, this is yet another beer from BBC that is at the top of the list of beers that I would choose within its style."
"Paired very well with a seafood dinner."
"Coffeehouse Porter I was looking forward to drinking this and was very pleased . A splendid brew that makes me looking forward to the other types/ styles that Berkshire put out ."
"drinkability isn't bad, it's a tad to sweet though i think."
"Drinkability is about average. Better than plenty of overspiced winter warmers but this isnt one I will likely buy again very often."
"Really a disappointment, since I've liked every other beer I've had from Berkshire. I'll buy it again, at least once, to find out if I just got a bottle from a flawed batch -- I sure hope so."
"This beer was a darker brown that was very cloudy in the glass. There was cinnamon and brown suger in the semell as well as taste. There was not a lot of bitterness to this beer. There was also a nice spiced side to this beer. The mouthfeel was smooth. It was drinkable and was a new take on the style for me."
"This is a very smooth beer that is easily drinkable and sessionable."
"Really not what I expected for a winter warmer - lower in alcohol and milder in flavor. I would have pegged it more in the ESB range. A surprisingly fresh flavor profile, soft in the front, but drying up a bit toward the finish. A great accompanyment to a meal of pot roast, with easy drinkability. Thanks to far333 for the sample."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a clear dark amber rust color with a smallish head. The head does leave good lacing on this beer. The smell is abit light with sweet malt, bread yeast, and some pine hops. The taste has sweet malt, carmel, light hops, and some chewy nuttiness. The m/f is light with all flavors mixing well. A very good winter warmer without alot of the holiday spices that overwhelm other winter warmers."
"Pours a deep amber hue with a rapidly dissipating head. Earthy hops mingle with a big malt presence in the nose. Big malt flavor dominates the taste with hints of mellow hoppiness that balances the beer well and keeps the sweetness in check so that it doesn't overwhelm. Pretty solid brew, gets better as it warms up."
"Pours out a nice dark amber brown color. Very hazy red color when back lit. Has a great creamy off white head that leaves a great lace all the way down the pint. Strong head retention making for a very nice presentation. Smells floral with a hint of pine sharpness mixed in with the malt sweetness. There is a presence of dry hop floral smell as well. Very nice well rounded smell a rather different mix in the nose. Pleasing to all of my senses. Tastes of malt and a floral light yeast like taste followed by a nice citrus hop finish. Smooth and extremely drinkable. Nice malt and hop flavor balance. Well constructed flavor that leaves me wanting more. I enjoyed this brew to the last drop and I would certainly enjoy another. Great winter warmer offering with a nice full body. Another hit from BBC for me."
"This beer is well balanced and has a wonderful soft mouthfeel. It could use some more spices to make it more to the style of a winter warmer."
"Points for appearance and aroma, but the flavor and mouthfeel fall short. The malt presence is quite thin and subdued, especially for an ale that should be big enough for the cold, winter months."
"Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: All I have to say is that downing a bomber of this was no problem... I just wish I had some more."
"Notes: BA member acarroll413 and I shared this 22 oz bottle, but as you can read from his review everyone's tastes are different. This was a good purchase, I liked this beer."
"D- I'm wicked bummed, I won't get it again."
"A deep dark amber/copper colored beer with a light haze. Has a big creamy spoonable beige head. Light fruit notes up front (peach,apricot) with some coffee notes next. Followed by an intruigeing grapefruit hop character.A light caramel malt character first. Then some roasted nut notes with a hint of coffee and a smooth light bitterness on the finish."
"This beer recommended by a friend at Colonial Spirits, I've been wanting to try another brew from Berkshire since trying the Imperial stout last year, and he has never lead me wrong before so let see what this beer is all about. It pours a candied orange, similar in color to pencil shavings. It leaves a very thin white head thats semi-sticky but not really clinging to the glass. The smell of this beer is surprisingly fruity, peach, grape, citrus. The hop essence in the nose is almost non present. As I taste this beer the hops let me know there in this ale, then a fruit essence hits your palate then leaves quickly replaced with some spices cinnamon, nutmeg, corriander and finished with a squeeze of hop bitterness. This is a nice ale one that is refreshing and I could drink all winter."
"This beer pours a very clear copper color with a head that dissipates quickly. While drinking I notice not much of a trace remains on the side of the glass. The smell is certainly not strong but I get the faint smell of spice and alcohol. The taste is quite enjoyable, malty in nature but certainly enough hops for balance with an overall holiday spice throughout. I like how this beer feels in the mouth with some carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer. It will not be a chore to finish this bomber. Another fine Berkshire product."
"Crystal clear copper colored with a tightly bubbled, very thick beige-orange head that leaves a quarter inch of foam suspended. Aroma is sweet malt and spice, a bit of hops, and sweet fruit. Flavor delivers an upfront puckery bitter, nice and hoppy with citrus but not over the top, followed closely behind by sweet malt and cinnamon, some ripe pear. Mouthfeel is full, but fairly tingly with carbonation. Oily webs of lace run down the inside of the glass. Very tasty, very drinkable."
"Body between light and medium, a tad light for this style. Soft carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel make for a highly drinkable ale."
"Not sure what to make of this beer. The nose reminds me of my parents' old compost pile that I had to turn over and I just came upon a bunch of old grass clippings. Poured a thick mahagony in color with a slight thin and creamy head. Flavor is havey on the malts and has a creamy taste going on. Slight hop towards the back end. The spices are very much so present but it is as if I am tasting them through cheese cloth. They are fairly muted. Full body and creamy mouthfeel. The spice kind of hand out around my teeth."
"Light mouthfeel, but that doesn't inhibit the flavor. Works pretty well. Leaves the mouth dry and warm. Drinkable? Lets just say the bomber didn't last very long."
"mouthfeel is full, nice sweet fullness to it. good drinkability but a bit full. overall excellent, a good winter brew."
"distinctively dark, amberlicious. lacing all over the glass in little specks.. and boy does this pack some serious whiffs. green hoppiness with hints of xmas pine and gingerbread dough. this sure gets me in the wintery mood. light mouthfeel and body with a big spicy profile. first thing i notice is a sharp, licorice-like bite in the finish. my tongue is left coated with a sugary sweetness, this is where the maple-infused gingerbread comes in. after-mouthfeel is creamy and tastes like i just ate said cookie. repeated sips bring out a little unwanted bitterness around the belly of the gulp.. almost like a stale hop or waxy, burnt wood.. but maybe that's part of the warming winter warmer warmth. tha bitterness seems to perk up with repeated drinking.. like a toasted cinnamon stick. overall, this beer is mad complex for its lack of weight and a nice, drinkable holiday beer. bbc continues to impress and this beer seems to be getting better and better with time."
"I love when local breweries come out with seasonal offerings. I've had this one several times in the past I just hadn't reviewed it. However, it is better than I remember."
"A winter warmer but it would also pass as a really good brown ale. Medium bodied, with good drinkability. I agree with the brewers on the label who advised stocking up on BBC for the winter, this review in my notes is from 12/12/04 and to accompany it I cracked open my last Cabin Fever as I wrote - it has held up well."
"A very nice treat, unexpectedly complex and very tasty. I would reach for another if I had one."
"Beautiful amber gold in hue with a ruby-purple influence, especially when backlit. The color is very regal. Modest haziness. The head was slightly off-white in color, at the apex the foam was one finger in height, sadly, it faded quickly to a thin, soapy collar. What a bummer! I mean damn the color is lovely, I wish it had better head retention. There was some subsequent lacing; it was very spotty and hardly noteworthy. This beer looks very nice. The nose is soft, the potency is low; it takes a hard sniff to entice this beer to speak to me. I get an interesting dichotomy. The malt is stronger than the hops and the malt has a simple English flair to it with a sweet, slightly roasty tone and a kiss of caramel. The hops are kind of spicy, muted though, with just a tickle of earthiness. In fact the hops seem German. The two countries are not a war; there is a good harmony in fact. The nutty aromas grow in time; I even get a hint of fruit (it is an ale after all). I like the nose; there isnt much to it though. Inviting but the nutty aroma gets a little loud for me. Im not going to lie; sometimes the moniker Winter Warmer worries me. It seems the title is too vague and too many of the beers follow suit. This offering, after the first couple sips, put my mind to ease. Even with that said, and dont get me wrong, this beer is good, there isnt that much stuff to really grab me. The malt backbone is the focal point of the palate; there are enough malt flavors for me to care, some roastiness, some sweetness, some caramel influences, and even a tickle of biscuit at the back. Even with all those tastes it seems to be lacking a little richness. Im such a dick. I mean there isnt any wrong with it, I just want something more; it needs another layer. The hops offer some spiciness that pierces the malt perfectly. Bitterness is firm and moderate. Nutty. It is lightly fruity too; hints of pine. Random kisses of sugar. This beer has excellent balance, the palate is plenty articulate and it is saying all the right things! The flavor profile is good. Medium in body, the carbonation is moderately low but quite fitting for this beer. The mouthfeel is not big or bulky; I guess this can be expected because the abv is modest for a winter seasonal. Pleasant mouthfeel. This beer was very drinkable. I mean very! Im enjoying every ounce of the bomber. This is yet another beer from BBC that is very quaffable. They can sure brew a beer I want to drink! Thank you ppoitras for the bomber, this was yet another great addition to Secret Santa 2004."
"Pours a deep orange almost copper color with a light white head. The nose is super fruity for this beer giving off some citrusy orange, strawberries, grapes and just a bit of hop. Initial flavors give off a creamy mix of caramels and fruity flavors. Peaches and strawberries are the closest things I can compare these flavors too. The finish is nicely hoppy and slightly bitter, with a nice citrus tone. There is also a bready tone right at the end. Overall this is a nice winter seasonal considering that most brews are big bruiser impy stouts or something of the sorts. This is a more subtle full flavored brew that just works well"
"Seek this one out, enjoy it and have another."
"A solid winter offering from Berkshire Brewing Company."
"This is a wonderful ale, and well worth seeking out."
"Poured hazy amber, decent head with some retention,slight hop aroma,sweet malts, tastes is rather smooth and creamy, malty with a touch of hops for balance, a bit spicy.medium carbonation, this is good drinking beer! if you like BBC products, you'll like this one. cheers!"
"Pours a hazy, dark copper color. Copious head with tiny bubbles that are very creamy, very good retention. Hints of caramel and slight random fruits in the smell along with malts and some hops. Flavor is surprisingly nonbitter for a brown ale, but is hefty enough for the style without ruining it for me. Very nice hops amount and it does not go overboard at all. Subtley sweet as well. Unique for brown ales I have had in the past, this one is definitely my favorite. Its balance, smoothness, and consistency are really quite good."
"Taste is sweet black cherry juice, almost a little too sweet to enjoy too much of. Cleanish finish, low on hops, but with a solid nutty aftertaste. Despite the mad bubbles and seeming carbonation, this beer is cold and smooth in the mouth, with actual feel from the apparent carbonation."
"22oz. bomber: This one opens with a loud pffft. It poured an fairly clear amber color. Suprisingly little head and about no carbonation. The aroma is quite mild. It is malty sweet, with some hints of fruitiness. Maybe some hops down in there also. Malty sweetness, with some hops in there to balance them out. No real bitterness to the tatse. A hint of spice. Very smooth. Good beer!"
"Drinkability & Notes: One of my favorite brews from Berkshire, very fresh with little nooks of complexities everywhere."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a big ol' inch tall tan colored head on top of a quite effervescent reddish brown ale. Head is very dense, and leaves foamy lace throughout the drinking experience. Aroma is a malty, with a touch of alcohol. Taste is similar to a bitter, with a small little kick of EtOH at the end. Also a bit of fruit flavor skulking around, not quite identifiable to me, which gives it a refreshing crispness I didn't really expect from a strong ale. Worth trying if you can find it..."
"Thanks to Mikeys01 for this very interesting beer."
"Pours a hazy brown with a huge flowing tan head. The flavor is kinda strange. Not bad strange, but not what I was expecting. Malty chew to it with a nippy hop balance. Slightly fruity. Mouthfeel is smooth. Seems like a solid brewskie. Not sure I could down more than one of this strange beer in a night though."
"Has a nice orange brown color. A tad hazy. O.k head that dissapeared quickly. Has that Berkshire signature scent. Fruity, peachy honey with a toffee mix. A roasty fruity honey sweet hops taste. Kinda creamy ,a little fizzy, some bitterness. Dry clean finish. Not what I was expecting for the desciption, but enjoyable none the less."
"Flavor is big and malty, with some light esteriness and mild hopping way back in the nosebleed seats. Sort of bland and simple, which is disappointing. Although it's a decent beer by any standard, this is my least favorite Berkshire beer so far. Not up to par with their other brews, in my opinion."
"22oz. bomber poured a slightly hazy and copper in color leaving a very small head. The fruity aroma makes this brew enticing from the begining. The soft buttery taste gets dominated by some sharp fruit flavors like banana and apricot. Finished peppery and with a nice hoppy bitterness. This is the second brew i have had from Berkshire and i can't wait for the next, a growler of Berkshire Pale Ale."
"Showed great carbonation with bubbles rising from the bottom to the top.The color was a caramel dark cherry red.Although it didnt have much of a head it still had great carbonation.It had a full body that was very malty and somewhat thick.The taste was strange and hard to decipher.It tasted of cheeries,cranberries,prunes,and cloves.The taste was very complex with a definate fruitiness.I enjoyed this offering from BBC and would surely try it again.Aroma's of hops with a touch of fruit.Medium amount of crispness felt on the mouthfeel.Very brief bitterness left on the finish."
