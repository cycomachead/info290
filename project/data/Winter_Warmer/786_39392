4.25,19,,,,,," This brew actually pours a pitch black in color with a thin tan head. Areas of spotty lacing is seen when sipped that ends up sliding back down the sides of the glass after a while. The aroma is of roasted malts like in a stout with some cocoa powder. Pretty much the same is said for the taste with a hint of dark fruit. Medium-bodied with low carbonation which is perfect for this type of brew. Very smooth and tasty brew for the colder months","BeerWithMike","Dec 11, 2014"

The aroma is spirited with dark malts, sugar, clean, light hops, and black licorice. The body has a smooth creamy feel to it and it falls in the medium range.

4.33,21.3,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Point St. Benedict's Winter Ale is a slightly hazy copper ale with a yellowish head that fades to a waxy film and leaves outstanding lacing on the glass. Fruit and spice are in the aroma, with notes of cinnamon, pear and allspice. There is the slightest hint of caramel. It has a very soft and delicate medium body. It feels fluffy in the mouth and the finish is very dry and a little gritty. Wow, this is like a Belgian dark ale. The flavor is complex with a lot of deep and dark tones-- cinnamon and wood. There is a fruity note which is a little like apricot or cherry. It doesn't really taste sweet, though. Roasted bitterness lingers after the swallow. Wow, this is a really good Winter ale, even in Spring. This is a very rewarding beer.","yesyouam","Apr 05, 2011"

Aroma has hints of christmas spice, cinnamon, allspice, and some citrus ginger. The back end there are some smokey ash tray notes. Nice underlying fruity character going on, brings out some caramel as well. Flavor wise some unrefined malt sweetness, extra juicy with plums/raisin/hints of citrus fruit in the back end. A bit of caramel/yeast spiciness not as upfront with the christmas spices in the flavors as the nose but still evident. A bit cloying unrefined/unfermented malts weigh heavy with each sip. Unnatural carbonation leaves a rough backend to each sip, something I wouldn't drink on the regular.

4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"St. Benedict's appears a bit viscous as I pour it into my glass. We'll see if that's really the case. It brought up a thick head of frothy tan foam which settles in a minute or so. Spots of lace are left about the glass. It's a slightly hazy crimson-tinted copper with glowing orange highlights. The aroma is interesting. I find it fruity and somewhat spicy. I'm thinking dark fruits like plum and raisin, maybe cassis. There's some darkly caramelish malt and cooked brown sugar beneath that. As I drink it, however, the lacing diminishes. Oh well, to the lips we go... fruit and malt combine at the front, and as it warms I find banana and clove. There's not a lot, but it's there. Across the middle it dries and a spice component appears. It rises in the finish, but notes of malt and then fruit are still there, leaving it fairly interesting and complex. Wow, it really is a bit viscous. It's medium-full in body and quite creamy as the carbonation is released. Back to the flavor, I really like the combination of fruit and malt at the outset. It's well combined, and the specific fruitiness that I found in the nose isn't there, it's more generic. Wether that's a good thing or a bad thing I don't know, we're not comparing it to any particular style or other beer. Hedonistically, I like it. And I also like the way the spiciness gently builds across the palate until it becomes most apparent in the dry finish. And not unlike the fruitiness, the spicing isn't quite clear either. I could guess at what's there, but it's not readily apparent and in your face. Perhaps it's just a pinch of cinnamon? Perhaps it's just clove and phenolic from the yeast? Personally I find that a good thing, it leaves you guessing. I think they've done a nice job of blending to get a nice mix that works, and they've kept it restrained enough that the spicing doesn't build on the palate, ruining the beer for you half way through. Sure, the first couple of sips of a really spicy beer can be great, but then you lose interest as it builds on your palate and blocks out the other flavors. This one is balanced enough that it remains focused and drinkable. Based on that I have to give it some really good marks for drinkability; and since I don't find any faults here, I'd have to say it's an excellent winter warmer. Nicely done!","NeroFiddled","Jan 08, 2011"

It pours (the beer, that is) a cloudy sienna-amber topped by some short-lived ecru foam, which finds apex at, at best estimate, a half-finger. The nose comprises rye bread, brown sugar, light maple syrup, and a good helping of nutmeg. It doesn't quite mix together very well, and just sits there, hoping that some 'strils come by looking for a "good time". The taste follows the same spicy path, but adds some light tinges of orange and grapefruit (the latter even lighter than the former), graham crackers, and straight butter. No margarine here, son. The body is a sorta hefty-feeling medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a grainy feel. Overall, I think SP tried a bit too hard to make a spiced ale, as the components don't really mesh all that well together.

Taste is of some tasty malt notes and caramel, with some banana-apple fruitiness I am also detecting as well. Mouthfeel is alright, it could be emboldened a bit by adding a bit more malt to the beer.

This beer is considered (I surmise) to be a winter warmer, but it smells more like a fruity Belgian-style dubbel. Caramel, dark fruits, raisins and fig - the dominant note being an estery yeast aroma, however. Slight spicy notes are detectable as well, though I suspect no spices were added although the packaging doesn't indicate. The palate is dry and fruity with a distinct bitterness that occasionally borders on tart. This character is more like overly-roasted or scorched malt than something fanciful like a wild or lactic yeast strain. Incredibly estery, this beer is more like a dubbel light. The body and mouth feel is just too light to support the flavors this beer is trying to achieve. Ample carbonations leaves the beer all the more dry in the finish, but does little to compensate for the thin, watery body. The label doesn't tell me the ABV of this beer, but I'd suspect it to be on the very low end for a winter warmer - maybe 6% or thereabouts. This is an 'okay' beer for the season, but not something to flip over. This beer strikes me as one that could be quite pleasant if it were improved in a couple of vital aspects - particularly the thin body and slightly acrid off-flavor.

At first drink, didn't find much of any of those spices I sniffed, but the taste was not nearly as strong as other dark's I've tried. Last drink same as first. As far a dark's go, this is on my short list of drinkables.","ibashmuck","Dec 28, 2007"
2.35,-34.2,3.5,3.5,2,2,1.5,"This beer lacks a unified flavor. Spices are too aggressive and overwhelming and complexity that may be in there. I don't know if I can drink another one.","Blakaeris","Dec 18, 2007"
3.92,9.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: Highly drinkable. This beer has most of the characteristics you are looking for in something to keep you warm. I will make this one another in the list of seasonal must-haves.","slyke","Dec 16, 2007"
3.58,0.3,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"The beer pours a brilliant mahogany with a thin off-white head. The aroma is moderately spicy, with hints of chocolate and roast. The flavor is moderately roasty, a little chocolate pokes through and there is a low hop bitterness. The body is rather thin with moderate carbonation. The finish is a bit dry. The flavor also is somewhat spicy/phenolic, likely from the yeast strain. Overall its a nice beer to look and is well done, but the lack of any lasting flavor and odd yeast character makes this nothing outstanding.","uwmgdman","Dec 06, 2007"
3.37,-5.6,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Having tried this brew from a bottle before this tap version may have helped my review, but it is worth a try. Decent brew, try the bottle before on tap!","WJVII","Nov 23, 2007"
3.75,5,3,3,4,3.5,4.5,"Nice amount of carbonation, pretty smooth and highly drinkable. For the price, I would recommend this one.","thagens","Nov 18, 2007"
3.87,8.4,3.5,4,4,3,4," ~ I must admit I am prone to liking Point beers and this one is no exception. The Stevens Point brewery has again reaffirmed another reason why I love this wonderful small city. Good people, good times and good beer. I think I'll have another.","cdkrenz","Oct 30, 2007"
