Fruity scents take command, with malted tones making a presence, but with much more reserve. Apple, pear, prune. And tasty too. Sweet... some malty sweetness, but mostly this is a fruity sweetness. Not sure how they pull this off without actual fruit in the brewing process (IS there fruit in the brewing process here?) but they do a damn fine job of things. A lightly syrupy mouthfeel. Moonraker would serve as an excellent dessert beer, or after-dinner drink. Not sure I would pair this with a cheese, but definitely a fruit sorbet or plum cake (IS there such a thing as plum cake?).

The flavors verify the caramel, toffee, toasted character. Fruit flavors of figs, peaches, almonds, and raspberries swirl around the malts and add varity to the taste. The feel is a solid and persistent bold maltiness with firm creaminess that is tempered only by the berry tawny tartness. Finishes quite malty flavored, yet intriguingly light and dry on the toung.

Held up to a window, the beer is on the lowest edge of transparent, showing a ruby world. Smells slightly sour, but not in a spoiled way. Light notes of sour cherries, sugar. Not much else on the nose. Tastes of slight caramel, although this hides behind the sweet and sour berry flavor. End very sweet, with no hop bitterness whatsoever. Seems to pass on a sweet cherry note to the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, and carbonation is almost nonexistent.

Apart from unidentifiable dark skinned dry fruits, this one also smelled woody and sour. The taste was pretty much same as the smell. The mix of sweet, sour, and musty flavors didnt quite rise to undrinkable standards, but did make me wince every time I took a sip. The body seemed thin at first, but after while it got to be more substantial. Usually that is good, but with this Moonraker, more flavors were not necessarily better. About the only positive was the well hidden 7.5% ABV. Not a beer, Id care to drink again.","rajendra82","Jun 30, 2006"

The smell is of ripe dark fruits, roasted malts and maybe a flutter of hops at the end. Medium bodied with the fruits and roasted flavors leading the way. The fruits are almost overpowering border lining on sweet caramel flavors as well. Almost no carbonation makes this beer tast almost juice like at times. There is a tiny bit of bitterness at the very, very end. Nothing seems to balance out the fruit though. Alcohol isnt very apparent in the taste but it is warming. I can see it hard to drink more than one of these beers due to the overpowering fruit flavors.

It has a warm, yet highly smooth malty flavor that is sweet at the start and dry at the finish. It has a nice roasted feel with some subtle fruity hints. The mouthfeel is fine.

I find this to be very enjoyable. The feel is moderate to thick with a light to moderate carbonation. I like it. Its not a fantastic beer, but above average.

Aroma is vinous and dark fruits, reminds me of their Harvest Ale. Taste is somewhat bitter for the style, with a slight spicy flavor. Mouthfeel is relatively creamy, but the bitterness is somewhat off-putting, and drinkability is similar.

The aroma of this brew was all about the big fruity malts, I got hints of plums, pudding, cranberries, various nuts, and more. Like an excellent winter cake in a bottle. The taste was sweet, fruity, and malty up front, with some complex fruit and nut notes in the middle, and a very smooth finish that left a lingering dark fruit aftertaste on the tongue. The mouthfeel was medium bodied>thick but perfect and the drinkability was good as well. Not as good as their harvest ale, but another winner from Manchester, none-the-less.","francisweizen","Nov 15, 2004"

Tasting this made me feel as though I had a cold. Definitely some sort of cough syrup feel and taste. A lot of alcohol followed by a syrup character with yeast and some molasses.

The slightly biscuity caramel malt reveals a nice nutty flavor, with a light herbal quality to it. The hops are in abundance. Sharp-edged white grapefruit and lemon zest bitterness mix with hints of a metallic bite. A candy sugar sweetness begins to peek through as it warms. A mild dose of a warming sherry-like alcohol backbone stays throughout. I can only guess that J.W. may have a quality control issue, based on the many high and low ratings it has received.

Lighter mouthfeel than I expected but the flavor is decently full, expressing chocolate powder, light coffee tones, and a burnt profile close to the end.

4.18,13.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Bottle conditioned; enjoyed at 50F.Carefully poured, the body is a slightly hazy, rich mahogany with an orange-cast and crimson highlights. It's topped by a thin but creamy light-tan head that holds surprisingly well and leaves thin and spotty lace throughout the glass. The aroma displays toffee, mild dark fruit, and alcohol. It's quite estery. As it warms, however, some more caramel notes begin to appear. A full body, coupled with a very fine and gentle carbonation, gives an exceptionally soft and creamy mouthfeel that emphasises the maltiness. The flavor is far more complex than the nose alludes to with notes of dark fruit (prune, raisin), toffee, scortched caramel, honey, oak and a touch of alcohol. It finishes with a rising bitterness and unique hop flavor that's not unlike wet, leafy, whole hops left in the wort at the end of the boil... lightly earthy, herbal and resiny - but dripping with malt. It combines with the residual semi-sweet dark malt to give a lingering licorice note. Well balanced and quite unique. A splendid, rich and complex old ale that's not quite accessible as Old Peculier, but ultimately more rewarding to those willing to delve a little deeper. If old ale is your tipple, this one is not to be missed!","NeroFiddled","Jan 19, 2003"

Chewey toffee/caramel flavor, with hints of dark fruit.  A little thinner on the taste than I'd like, however.  Despite the carbonation, mouthfeel is rather creamy.  It's a lot like rich, chewey toffee candy, without the intense sweetness.  A pretty smooth drinking brew.","Viking","Aug 09, 2002"
