3.82,0.8,4.25,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"It says right on the bottle that it's a red ale, and it sure tastes like other red ales I've had, though perhaps less bitter. I was under the impression that winter warmers were generally more related to brown ales. I didn't really detect any additional spices. Oh well, either way it was delicious. Used a large, short-stemmed Belgian style flute (for lack of a better term). I perceived various shades of amber. A slight, but seductive haziness, although that may have been from how cold it was when served. Aromatically it seemed more akin to some black ales that I've had than to a pale or an IPA. A very sweet, perfumy hoppiness. Sweeter, but with a stronger flavor profile than many a pale, or even some IPAs. Again, reminiscent of certain of the black ale style. Rich, somewhat thick. Head was there to stay.","Libeertarian","Mar 10, 2015"

Its creamy, medium full body and medium carbonation.","pat61","Jan 09, 2015"

More going on with the taste as there is a hint of pine also. Good taste with a slight bitter finish. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation for this style of brew.

Had Brrr a number of years in a row, but this years bottle tastes like a Wet Hop IPA with a hint of spiciness. Upon opening, it has a much hoppier aroma than year's past, but that's not a bad thing. A lil' bit of head led to some nice lacing on the frozen pint glass it was poured into. But the flavor was very rich--in my opinion--the way an IPA should taste and lean towards in the colder months--very wet hops balanced with a decent malt flavor and a few spices for good measure. Definitely didn't feel like a red ale this time around--much closer to an IPA, but a good one for the fall and winter months ahead!","Beerme5","Oct 24, 2013"

I did enjoy it however, but it would've been better if there was a hint of difference. I may try again, but most likely will stick to a more familiar beer with similar taste. Only reason this beer was given a reasonable score was due to the fact it fit well in the category. Cheers!.","DMXLOX22","Feb 13, 2013"

The beer is smooth and balanced between malt and alcohol, but doesn't have the corresponding hop aroma or flavor.

The nose comprises apricot peel, light honeydew shell, sweet caramel, and a bit of pine resin. These elements don't really go together all that well, frankly, but the combination is interesting enough. The taste holds notes of pine resin, orange peel, light peach, dusty toffee, and a touch of toasted biscuit. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fairly dry finish.

It has a rich pine aroma with sweet caramel in the nose. It's pretty full bodied, very smooth and foamy. The finish is clean and nimble. It tastes pretty bitter and a little sweet. The balance is really nice. Pine resin is the loudest flavor. The bitterness turns to something more like juniper by the time the caramel sweetness emerges just after the swallow.

Good lacing on the glass. Aromas are citric hops, brown sugar, caramel, and some spiciness, cinnamony perhaps, although I don't think any cinnamon was used in the brewing process...imagination? Tastes are very well balanced and complex with notes of spicy hops, brown sugar, grapefruit, orange rind, toasted grains, chocolate and a nice smack of bitter pine resin on the finish. Mouth-feel is on the fuller side of medium and nice and creamy while being slightly oily on the finish. Overall, a very nice surprise from Widmer Brothers! I really enjoyed this one; loads of complexity, bitter, but tons of malty at the same time. Worth getting again...maybe earlier in the season next year, although this would be nice and refreshing for a warmer day too.

Don't get me wrong, this was great, just not what I am used to in a winter seasonal. There was very little that was sweet, but rather a heavy hand on the hops with a hint of the warming spice and alcohol.

4.08,7.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a clear reddish amber with one inch of white head that had decent retention. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass surface. Strong aroma of hops. Citrus and pine dominate in the nose. The flavor is more balanced as the malt adds a little sweetness to the bitter hops. Still finishes bitter though. The body is quite nice with a semi creamy texture but it feels a little thin for something trying to carry the ABV and the hops. If you like hopped up red ales, like I do, then this beer will be appealing. Knocked the drinkability down a little because of the high ABV.","morimech","Dec 17, 2008"
4.48,18.2,4,3.5,5,4,5,"Glad to see other reviewers ""get"" this beer! Because I've heard comments from people about how it's too hoppy, too thin, too something to be a good winter seasonal. Plus I guess people miss Snowplow, Widmer's terrific previous winter seasonal (and apparently Widmer realized that and brought it back out in addition to Brrr). Well, Brrr is a great beer, whether or not it is appropriate as a winter seasonal. And it does taste good in the winter. Makes a great Christmas gift. And yes, I wouldn't mind if they'd keep making it year-round. So...if you're looking for a barleywine or a spiced beer, this isn't it. But if you want to try a well-hopped, well-balanced, big (but not huge) red ale, give it a try.","chezztone","Dec 16, 2008"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Didn't know what to expect. After being grossed out by punkin beer, cinnamon beer, coriander beer, and what have you, I was afraid I'd find another precious seasonal. So I held my breath, and started knocking this down. Oo-wee, man, it reminds me of the spruce gum the relatives used to send us from Nova Scotia. The label says it winds up with a candy aftertaste, but the spruce gum drove that right away. Then, after I recovered from what happened, I said. Man, what happened, I gotta down another swig and figure this out. It's like DMT for the timid. Go get this stuff if you are ready for repeated trips to the far borders of beer taste but want to come back for a rest.","sabinelr","Dec 15, 2008"

The aroma was quite good, hops, dry malt, bready, a bit of orange. As for the taste....it had potential here. It certainly was strong tasting, but lacked depth. Strong piney hops with some caramel to balance here...so far so good...but within a quarter of the way it was all bitter hops and no malt to be tasted. I can enjoy a strong hoppy beer, even unbalanced ones, but this one needs to be tweeked to be enjoyable.","DoubleJ","Dec 10, 2008"

Nice hop bitterness backed up by some toasty, bready malts, some spiciness. Slightly sweet, dry on the finish. Fairly creamy mouthfeel with a carbonation bite at the end. although this comes in at 7.2% ABV, it's quite drinkable and has a certain IPA quality to it/ Very nice and pleasantly surprised, although it's not what I usually expect out of a Winter Warmer.

It's not really a Winter Warmer...which irks me a bit, because it's a pretty solid red and I would have enjoyed it in the late summer myself. Seems like an improvement over the W'06 (which this is supposedly based off of).
