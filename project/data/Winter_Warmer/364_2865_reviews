"Beer doesn't live up to the hype for me. The taste isn't very complex and its a bit too light in taste to justify its strength in both color and smell. Tastes very ordinary in my opinion."

"O - A very sweet, pleasant enough Christmas ale. A little one dimensional. Nice, but nothing special."
""
""
"Overall a decent winter warmer, perhaps lacking in the complexity department but enjoyable enough for a cold November evening."

"O: Pumped I got to try it. An excellent seasonal beer. But, I have a feeling that if I have a few of these I won't be doing much else that day."
"Coats the mouth. Good."

"The velvety smoothness comes to mind first, very impressive. It manages to be sweet but not sticky with some toast and toffee to go along with a mild floral hop bitterness. It has some sherry notes usually found in a nice, aged barleywine. I like how it straddles the line between sweet and toasty, never really leaning one way or the other. Fun beer, Id put at least a few of these away each year come wintertime. This would be a great beer to quaff after a long day on the slopes."

"O: Always a winter beer fav....Bottom line, drink this one with care...This has been only beer where after a mere 6 pk, I found myself the next morning face down, next to the fridge and late for work...so take caution, this one can get you in the 'woo-woo!!'"

"Medium bodied with a nice texture and lively carbonation. Has a long lingering bitter finish. Strong alcohol warming effect."

"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a rich red amber with a very thin head and slight lacing. Malt, dark fruit and hop aroma. Very malty with spice, some caramel. Finishes dry and oaky with some hop bite. Has the dry malt flavor that reminds me of Mad River's barley wine. Unusual. The finish bitterness is not well balanced, but otherwise interesting and fun to drink."

"overall: good, not great"

"Not the sort of beer I'd want to drink any other time or any other place than in the NW during winter. However, drinking this beer in Tacoma in December is just an absolute treat, but one I'll probably have to wait another year for to sample again."
"Mouthfeel is thick and a little sticky. Overall, I'm pretty impressed. It's nice."
"- It's a solid beer, and I wonder what a fresh 2011 release would taste like. Perhaps more bitter and hoppy. But this cellared number seems nice and smooth.. and certainly has some nice character in its malt and spice."
""
"O: Not impressed one bit. Was looking forward to a local brew and shouldn't have grabbed this. Don't know if I'll finish it or not."

"Here in Washington, it's a few bucks more than most winter warmers, but it's also the best one around."

"Overall this seemed like a run of the mill amber ale with hints of darker malts. Not a bad beer but not worth seeking out either."
"D: This recipe should be tossed out of the lexicon for what is normally a great brewery."
"First had this on tap, but grading from a bottle. Appearance is a dark ruby amber color with a thin head and nill lace. Smell has a rich malt dark fruit aroma with a little alchohol lingering. Taste has again very rich malts and fruits with a nice balance of hops with a little alchohol in the background. Mouthfeel is heavy with good carbonation. A nice heavy Christmas ale that is satisfying to sip on."
"Single bottle picked up to give it a try. Poured into a pint glass. Dark orange color. Lots of carbonation noted, with some lacing. Smell had a lots of hops to it. Taste was also hoppy, with a bit of citrus also. Mouthfeel was somewhat bitter. Did not realize the abv was that high. Too hoppy for a winter warmer for my liking. Would be a good choice, though, for IPA lovers."
"D: The lingering bready bitterness keep it from being overly drinkable. To be honest, not a big fan of this one. Certainly wouldn't go out of my way to find it..."
"D - A bit hot right now. At 8%, you really taste the booze as it leaves a little burning in the cheeks and back of the throat after the finish. Sitting in front of a fire, I'd love this, but I think this could really benefit from age. Great for the style and I regret not cellaring some of this when I lived in Seattle."
"On the sweet side, but still an easy sipper with a gently warming alcohol presence."
"One of the finest winter ales Washington has to offer."
"Drinkability-High ABV limits drinkability, but the deliciousness boosts it too. Brilliantly huge."
"Overall - A very solid winter warmer, which I must say, is hitting the spot perfectly after, fittingly enough, a snowy day! Good thing this stuff is local, I'll probably be having a bit more of it while it's around."
"I just couldn't wait for Xmas :)"
"i would recommend it, if for nothing more than a history lesson to other northwesterners.. to let them know that there's more than just what we normally see out there in the beer world."
"Drinkability is decent, but with the somewhat boring nose/taste I couldn't see myself drinking more than one..."
"Pretty drinkable, ABV is well hidden, not bad, not mind blowing either"
"The body was very good, full and thick, without being heavy. A nice taste lingers on the tongue and extends the enjoyment. Drinkability is also very good, but caution must be used due to the strength of this tasty brew. Overall, this is probably my favorite beer from this brewery and I look forward to it's release every year."
"CHEERS! Beertracker"
"Poured a caramel color, a cloudier on tap and seems to be much heavier. Nose is sweet and pretty malty. Taste is nice and spicy but goes down so smooth. Hops amd malt are perfect. Well balanced. Notice a little spice but its all nice and this is why the Maritime has it right on EVERYTHING."
"Good interesting solid brew."
"Tasty and hugely British-esque. Warming and malty, and I could see several of these sneaking up on you easily."
"D: I liked this beer overall and would have it again. I wished that it had a more enticing aroma, but it's otherwise a good, drinkable warmer. Worth a try."
"Not very drinkable. Have to be honest, on a Friday evening, I'm not going to waste my time with this beer. Moving on. You should too."
"Drinkability is not to high, this was a subpar beer, and I'm not impressed. Less fusels and more maltiness, or basically any other character and they might have pulled it off, but as it stands, I really don't see much of a leg to stand on!"
"Not a bad beer, tastes and smells like a barleywine, but much hoppier. Not a bad beer, but thick and powerful to dry and drink more than one."
"Drinkability: Not good at all; I possibly got a bad bottle"
"D - a nice warmer upper."
"7/3.5/7.5/3/15/3.7"
"Drinkability: A solid winter warmer, perhaps with a little too much reliance on herbal hops to achieve what it wants, but nonetheless pretty decent."
"M + D: Easy does it... the alcohol is a bit on the hefty side. Medium body, minimal carbonation. Not one of my favourites, but glad to have tried it."
"Mouthfeel is full and smooth."
"D: This is a quality winter warmer and almost drinks like a barley wine. For the price I could see myself with a case of this as a staple through the 2008 holiday season."
"Jk"
"Overall worth a try but not high on my list of wonderful Christmas beers."
"I'm willing to concede that I have something of a personal attachment to this beer that may color my perceptions. After spending as many holiday seasons with JR as I have, I've grown to expect that it just wouldn't be winter without it. I've got an almost child-like emotional attachment to it that I can't separate from the experience of Christmas itself. You know, like ""visions of sugarplums danced in their heads."" That sort of thing. Only now that I'm all grown up, it ain't sugarplums. It's big winter ales like this one."
"Overall a complex and unique winter warmer. A bit too sweet for my taste however."
"Thanks, mikeale, for the opportunity"
"Thanks to Matt K. for bringing this one back from Seattle. It's a hazy orange in my glass with little head or lacing. Basically it's a red ale with decent hops to it. I also get some very slight cocoa along with the smooth and roasted caramel flavors. Not a bad beer, but nothing new or inspiring."
"Overall: Like a mini-barley wine. Tons of flavor and great aroma paired with medium strength alcohol and a mouthfeel to die for. Great, great beer from a brewery I had never heard of until tonight. Thanks to Svejk for the hook up!"
"d - definitely not a session, one will do fine."
"This is the first beer I have reviewed on this site, most likely because it is the absolute best winter brew I have ever had. I will definitely be picking up another 6-pak of this. Also tried an Avalanche by Snoqualmie Brewery earlier this week....also good....but not THIS good."
"Nice heavy mouthfeel, thick and creamy and very nice on a chilly night."
"Pours a murky caramel color with a ruby hue. Couple fingers of cream colored head after an aggressive pour that died slow and leaves sticky sheets of lace. Smells of sherry, fig, plum, molassas, a little spice, very sweet. Big flavors. Sherry type alcohol is predominant with a backbone of caramel, cinnimon, fig and dried plum. Feels full in the mouth with a slightly hoppy finish. Resembles a barleywine. A sipper for sure. A nice treat but probably be even better on a snowy winter day (hence winter warmer)"
"It was just a pleasure to drink this beertoo bad I didnt save a second bottle."
"EDIT: Another bottle purchased the same time as the last, but consumed about a month later, was awesome. It seems like every other serving I have of this beer is great. Very weird."
"Medium mouthfeel boardering on med/large. Get a bit chewy as the beer warms up. Mild carbonation. Very drinkable."
"Wow... had this with dinner at a steakhouse in downtown Seattle. This could have been a meal in and of itself. After two (before dinner came), I was feeling it. I hadn't eaten anything all day, but I was still a little surprised at how it hit me... it wasn't until I got home and looked it up and found that the alcohol content was 9% that it all made sense. Anyway, on to the beer... great color and smell... I couldn't wait to jump right in. Lots of malt and hops with a great full bodied caramel flavor. The first one went down so easily, I hardly remembered the transition into the second! At 9%, its definitely not for the weak hearted, and being a winter brew, this will keep you warm on the cold, damp nights in the Pacific Northwest. I would highly recommend this one."
"The alcohol is very much at the forefront and the drink has a rummy character to it. I can definitely feel a burn with every swallow. It is a medium-high abv that drinks like a very high abv and for that reason I can't score it too high on drinkability. Good offering nonetheless."
"This one is not real sessionable. It would be worth having a couple but that's all. It's kind of strong tasting, and the ABV is a little high. Not the most drinkable brew."
"D: Perfect brew for a rainy chilly Seattle evening, good winter warmer."
"Overall an awesome beer and Im struggling to remember a better example of the style. Ill bee seeking out more to drink now and some to put-down for a bit, Ill bet this ages into something fiercely delicious."
"This is a good beer from a good brewery. It's somewhat peculiar to me it's only been reviewed 30 times as of the writing of this as it's a perennial local favorite. Jolly Roger is a red-brown brew with light-to-average retention of its off-white head. The retention is impressive considering the higher alcohol content. There is a spicy hop aroma and the taste is complex with caramel, herbal, and slightly medicinal tastes as well as some raisiny, toasty flavor with a toffee note. There is a medium-long finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and sharpy carbonated. The 8% alcohol content is detectable as warmth. A good drinkable winter warmer."
"Thanks again to skyhand...especially thanks for two bottles...I will love the second even more than the first since I will do so merely for pleasure and not to review."
" Palate is a complex blend of piney hops that are somewhat subdued by the lightly sweet, sticky malt. The bitterness comes through on the finish, with a good bit of spruce emerging on the aftertaste. Body is smooth and more than a little creamy, an unexpected pleasure in a winter warmer. The ample alcohol makes this one you'll probably want to drink in moderation, but overall a very tasty brew. I'll have to explore more of this brewery's offerings next time I'm in Seattle."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head over the almost clear orangey amber brew. Head is quickly down to a swirly layer of itty bitty bubbles, and lacing is average. Aroma is a bit syrupy, with piney hop notes. Taste is intense upfront, with everything coming at once. The sweetness and hops are both right there, and the rest of the experience is the tsunami roiling and the receding. Mouthfeel is nice once things settle down, and drinkability is quite good for the style and the abv. A winter warmer I wouldn't mind wintering with."
"This is the first sixpack of a beer I've bought in *months*. Usually I buy one bottle of several types of beer, returning to one rarely if I know it's good. Bought a six-pack of this the other day after trying one bottle a week ago. It saddens me to learn of this beer so soon to the end of its run. Definitely gives me something to look forward to next winter."
"This stuff is brewed under the Ballard Bridge and literally flies off the shelves each year in the Emerald City and surrounding environs...for good reason."
"Lovely turbid pour yeilding an amber with a slight tan head. The smell is muted like I am smelling a candle in the next room. Some fruit esters and sweet maltiness with lingering hop characters. The taste is very good but I am sure different than fresh. The hop presence is grassy but most only bittering. The malt dominates and that is alright because this tastes somewhat like belgian yeast was put to work. Fruity cherry and currants delicately hide around the corner while a yeast flavor hangs out with the malt like brown sugar. Good mouthfeel and very drinkable wish I had plenty fresh and aged."
"Drinkability must be very good, as I'm looking forward to gobbling the other 5 this evening."
"Pours a deep coppery amber with absolute minimal head. Aroma is none too light on its feet, but hints at supreme maltiness. Upfront there's a few fruity esters then lots of malty bready brown sugar sweetness, though by no means overkill, just enough. Intermixed is lots more fruitiness, definite cherries, banana and spice. I won't hazard a guess as to which. Just enough hops to balance. It's very full and creamy in the mouth, with medium low carbonation. Runs all around the palate well after swallowing. Drinks like a beauty. Simply marvelous."
"Semi-sticky and cloying with malty sweet action and silky smoothness. Body is mediumish with a light carbonation that tends to build slightly into the finish. Nice little warming hints gradually gain hold as you go. A nice beer; perfect for helping warm up the winter."
"I really couldn't finish this one. A little diacetyl can add a hint of richness or depth, but too much, and it stops tasting like beer and instead is like liquid popcorn."
"Pours a dark red-brown, a perfect color for late autumn early winter. Especially since it seems extra cold this Seattle winter. I don't even need to try--- I can smell rich diacetyl and caramel, with some fruit lurking just beneath the surface. I never would have said it the first time I tried this, but all I can think of is an English ESB on steroids, which to me is a good thing as I love English beers. The taste is more caramel with hints of diacetyl and muted fruit, almost a pear taste. Mouthfeel is every bit as great as a beer straight from London! If you impulsively grabbed a sixer of this, you won't be sad that after drinking one, you'll still have 5 more to go. This beer is defintely a winner. Thank you Maritime for being creative in your brewing and giving me something to think about!"
"Cheers"
"The 8.0% ABV is beginning to scimitar my ass, so I'll end this thing while I can still type. A big Thank You to the right honorable RoyalT for this growler and the two that preceded it. If I can manage to find the bottom tonight, I will not have had a finer 192 consecutive ounces of beer in my entire life."
"Sugar cookie dough, bubblegum. Boiled collards and dandelion greens. Chewy. Lots of malt liquor -- like cooking greens in a malt broth. Burnt sugar cookies, and spice nodules. It's like, ping-ping-ping on the spice jar lids."
"Drinkability: Perhaps I got a bad bottle, perhaps not. I don't really want another bottle of this beer. The flavor needs to be refined to and I just don't see it happening from this beer. My advice would be to toss this recipe and start over."
"Slàinte!"
"This beer poured a dark brown with a minimal head, held up to the light, wasn't quite crystal clear but a little hazy. Aroma is malty and estery, nothing to write home about. Taste is big and malty sweet yet perfectly balanced with citrusy hops. Nice syurpy body yet quite drinkable especially for the abv."
"Pours a pune juice color with dark streaks, the head was tan and delicious looking, smell was of deep roasted oak and nuts, metallic hint, a ground almost grassy hint, the taste just didn't seem right, I might have to give this one another try, almost a burnt crisp sweetness, a slight hop was out of place dont' like hints of citrus in my winter warmer, thick bodied like syrup, could only handle one of these in a sitting."
"thanks go, again, to the mighty weefisheads for this!"
"Update  The 04 seasonal was a bit bitterer at the finish then it was in 03 and maybe a tad lighter in the mouth. This really is my favorite Winter Warmer year after year."
"Dark amber color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is malty, fruity and slightly sweet. Rich roasted malts, slightly hoppy. Rich and full bodied. Smooth taste. Nice flavor. Good hop/malt balance. Mouthfeel is round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty, slightly bitter"
"A finish of slight hop bitterness with a barely sour note leading into a strong warm alcohol finish."
"I recommend this as a sipper to go along with a Macanudo as puffing material."
"The pour a hazy, dusky bruin, light chocolate moderate head, modest lace, both dissipate rather quickly. Nose is malt, caramel,  and the aroma of the Cascade and Chinook hops are also present. Front is malt sweet, the middle moderate, the finish has a  hefty hop spicy bite, the carbonation pleasant, dryish, along with the high ABV, makes for a nice ""Winter Warmer."
