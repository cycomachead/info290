4,2,,,,,,"Pours a dark brown color with a white head.  The aroma has a lot of malts, unfermented sugars, fruit and alcohol.   The taste starts off with a bit of dark fruits, turning nutty, wheaty and a bit strong.  The beer is damn smooth, more than likely from the oat additions in brewing.  Brewed with rye, sage, caraway, juniper and chestnuts, they meld together to form a unique flavor but everything is so balanced it is almost non-distinct.  The beer is full bodied but very smooth on the palate.  Soft, prickly carbonation makes for a smooth drink (the beer poured from the tap just a bit heady).  Overall, this would certainly be considered a success, and apparently this was a collaboration between Nøgne Ø, Stone and Jolly Pumpkin.  Its not a sour, thats for sure, sorry Jolly Pumpkin fans.  It is, however, a very good beer!","Stinkypuss","Dec 07, 2014"

The nose is spicy, complex and absolutely amazing. Hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, coffee, dark fruit, molasses, maple, sage, and rye. The taste is just as amazing and just as complex. Strong malty and spicy base with hints of toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, pine, maple syrup, black cherries, sage, rye, and chestnuts. I had a beer this past summer in the South of France made with chestnuts and I'm really liking what they add in flavor. Hopefully it catches on. I'm also getting some subtle dark chocolate emerging as it warms. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a subtle tanginess on the finish. Overall, this is a home run Winter Warmer! It's amazingly complex but totally drinkable. A top notch beer from three awesome breweries!","beerdrifter","Jan 27, 2013"
4.23,7.9,4.5,4,4.25,4.5,4.25,"The beer pours a deep black-brown with an inch of creamy tan head that laces - slightly reminiscent of Guinness. Honestly, it looks like it could have poured from a nitro tap. The nose is potently herbal with notes of white sage cutting through the surface. It reminds me of the holidays poured into a glass with an initial rye bread sweetness perfectly blended with chestnuts and piney sage. The beer was more aromatic and flavorful when I had it a month ago, but it still packs a distinct punch of flavor. The taste carries a lot of bready sweetness which transitions into a slightly bitter, herbal finish. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and modestly sweet with a fresh herbal finish. There is definitely a touch of roasted chestnuts/malt which compliments the beer's herbal aftertaste. This beer is very well done and definitely worth trying. It encapsulates everything I want in a winter warmer with a unique twist on the traditional winter warmer spice profile. It's an excellent collaboration beer with easy availability, wide distribution, and reasonable price point.","ThePorterSorter","Jan 22, 2013"

Beer is well-balanced as both minor citric hops and sweetness (I seem to pick up figs and toffee which is odd) are both evident, and the beer passes easy and fullish as there is a breadiness to the beer that makes it an easy passing, dessert sipper. A quality brew that is easy to drink and enjoyable which is all one can ask for a winter style beer.","clayrock81","Jan 16, 2013"

The nose comprises black cherries, nutmeg, brown sugar, chocolate-covered strawberries, rye bread, cinnamon, and molasses. The taste holds notes of brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, rye bread, banana bread, raspberries, maple syrup, vanilla, peppercorns, red grapes, red apples, and cashews. Tastes like the holidays...

Aroma is unusual and complex, sweet with hints of juniper, rye, and alcohol, as well as other things I can't tease out. Flavor is roasted malts, with juniper upfront and a hint of coffee and chocolate on the way down. There is a pleasant heat from the alcohol, and a lingering sweetness to the roasted afterflavors. There is such a depth of flavor that I feel like I've only skimmed the surface, but I've run out of words. There is more carbonation than is apparent from the appearance, and it carries the flavor into your mouth with a burst. This brew has a rich mouthfeel, almost creamy. It's delicious and drinkable, but perhaps not more than one.","Ladybugger","Feb 14, 2010"
4.35,11,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a Gouden Carolus chalice. It has a dark ruby/brown color, almost like a glass of cola. There is a modest tan foam head that settled down to a skim of foam. No light can penetrate through the sides of the glass, but near the top of the beer some light filters through and I can see bubbles rising to the top. The aroma can be classified and spiced malt. I am picking up nutmeg, sweet candy and a bit of juniper. It's very interesting. It has a big roasted malt flavor. You can taste the rye a bit of the nuttiness from the chestnuts. It also has a touch of warm alcohol that lingers on, along with some forest-like flavors (probably the juniper I picked up in the nose) and finishes up with a slight coffee bitterness. I was surprised at how thick this beer was when I first tasted it. I rolls around your mouth and doesn't want to leave once you've swallowed. It has the kind of body that demands respect and attention. It is hearty enough to earn the name winter warmer. Despite the big body and flavors, I find the beer to be quite drinkable. At no point do the spices overwhelm, nor does the ABV. This is an ideal beverage for a long winters night. Highly recommended!","ToasterChef","Feb 12, 2010"

It is all spice....very simple. The taste is more balanced than the aroma in that there is some malt, but it is still mostly spice. The mouthfeel is very good.

To the best of my recollection, the releases are very similar in terms of quality. The nose could use just a little more strength here, but that's about it. The flavor is good. It's unique for a Winter Warmer. Not what you'd ordinarily expect. I like it. If you see a bottle still around, pick it up. It's good stuff.

4.25,8.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability: this is a bold flavored beer and great for the cold weathe, but one bottle is enough in a session.","Gavage","Dec 19, 2009"
3.66,-6.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"D: Too floral to be highly drinkable, very smooth and the abv is well hidden but too many herbs get in the way of this one.","RedBrewer83","Dec 15, 2009"
4.03,2.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"D: This release is very good, and easy to drink. It could have used just a bit more assertive hopping though. That would have bumped up my score.","WYVYRN527","Dec 14, 2009"
3.38,-13.8,4,3.5,3,5,3,"D- Overall, this is an interesting brew because it is different but I don't think it is outstanding enough to purchase again. Worth a shot though.","cjgator3","Dec 07, 2009"

4.13,5.4,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,"I think this is a tad better than last years version, though they are certainly very close. The aroma is a bit spicy for me but the taste is excellent, as is the super creamy mouthfeel. Creative and tasty.","gford217","Dec 02, 2009"
3.65,-6.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"d - the flavors are intense though not that complex and interesting, not all that harsh on the palate","WeisGuy","Nov 30, 2009"
3.97,1.3,4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Overall: One of the best I've had in a while. Truly is a winter warmer and probably the best I've had this season (I feel ashamed for not rating the last many beers I've had, so I start again here).","jmw141","Nov 30, 2009"
3.78,-3.6,4,3.5,4,3,4,"the mouthfeel is average at best. too thin and over-carbonated. three titans of brewing worked on this beer but give me a jubelale instead. still, a pretty good beer.","jdklks","Beers"

4.03,2.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"this one looks really pretty to me. Nice, dark brown with a tan head that looks good, holds well and leaves nice lace on my glass. sage hits me first in the nose, followed by juniper and sweet, nutty, toasty goodness. taste is a well balanced mix of all of the above which comes together to create it's own personality, forming a taste that reminds me of the candies in my granmother's house that had a really odd boozy herbal medicine thing going on with them. the things going on in this beer are all triggers for festive christmas time moods and feelings for me all sliding down to my belly on a slick and slightly prickly bed of beer that leaves a sagey piney fresh herb kiss of a finish that really lingers in a kind of dry way. nice. out there. proper. all said and done, this could be like my anchor tradition. one a year to get me in the mood, and i can't wait for next year.","timtim","Beers"
3.4,-13.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"D - In a world of over-spiced winter brews, this one is a nice respite. Still spiced, but not to much. They did not just throw a bunch of ingredients into a beer, but crafted a brew that utilized all the ingredients to add to the beer. What results is a well produced beer, that yet somehow misses feeling spectacular, yet I can't seem to pin-point why.","SammyDavisJrJrJr","0"
