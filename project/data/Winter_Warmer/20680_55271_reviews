"Overall:  Good...I can't quite get to loving the way all the different parts hang together and it is a little too sweet for me, but I can respect and enjoy it, and it is well made."

"Poured into a Blanche de Namur small pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown with little light transmission and a half finger dark khaki head with good retention and lacing.Aroma of sweet bready malt with hints of caramel, dark dried fruit, mainly raisins and dates, light hay; earthy winter spices. Flavor is caramel malt with some toastiness, dark dried fruit, cinnamon and clove, cocoa, light molasses. Finishes with earthy spices and light hop bitterness. Medium bodied with light creaminess. This is exactly what I hope for in a winter warmer; seasonal spicing in a rich malty body. The malt depth and woody, earthy components make it clear why this makes such a good base for the BA version. Very nice seasonal."
"Gotta say- if you're expecting  a traditional ""winter warmer"" style beer before taking your first sip of this beer, you are in for a bit of a surprise. If this was sold year round as a porter I wouldn't be surprised at all. Deep dark appearance, tan head. Very malty but not in the same way a lot of winter ales are;Very roasted chocolate and nut taste, still has that hint of boozy aroma though. Has a roasted nutty finish, dark chocolate linger. This is a great beer, but a bit of a different direction than your typical winter warmer."

"Overall: An interesting winter warmer (here in the middle of the summer); wish there wasn't so much of a charred flavor on the finish"

"One of my favorite winter brews this year for sure. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at Wine World and Spirits in north Seattle."

"Pours like a porter with deep dark chocolate color and it's creamy deep beige head,some deep ruby is shown thru when held to the light.Roasted and warming in the nose along with fruity esters and chocolate notes,again alot like a porter.Big roastiness on the palate along with earthy tones,bitter chocolate along with mild fruitiness and sweet alcohol in the finish,I don't get any spice really.To me this is a bigger porter all the way,and a good one.A nice change of pace from the sweet spiced winter warmers."

"o: an easy drinking, roasty winter warmer, fairly standard but a good flavor set that hints at the porter style"
""

"Overall, a solid winter warmer that I could see enjoying w/ a big cheeseburger or maybe a pot roast."

"O: This becomes pretty sweet after a while, so it might not be a bad idea to have someone on standby to share this with. Still, if we're talking about how this one lives up to the basic definition of the 'winter warmer' moniker (meaning does it lift the soul and warm the orifices), I'd say it's a success. I'd buy it again if Fremont ever decided to distribute to my state."

"O: Really pleasant winter warmer, and a malt-forward yet drinkable dark beer that could turn into something brilliant with the addition of barrel aging. I'll have to try and track one of the BA versions down."
""
""
"Wintertime was late! Such a perfect time to pop the cap on this bottle. Abominable is true to style, with an alluring dark color and a palate that makes you want to take another sip. A brawny ale, one that looks to warm the soul and ward off any winter chill, which it does not seem to have a problem doing."
""

"O: A really solid winter warmer, great flavor profile and surprisingly drinkable for 8% and the bold flavors it imparts. Nitro did it wonders, but have also had it on tap no on nitro and like it just as much."
""
""
"Overall - A very drinkable ale. I make it as much a traditional coffee stout as a winter ale, but very good indeed."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I think this is a really nice take on what I feel like can be a very broad style. While this isn't my favorite winter beer it's certainly one that I look forward to every year. The profile for this beer says it's 7.5%, but the can that I'm looking at (2012 batch) says this winter monster clocks in at 8%, the alcohol is masked well. Abominable definitely gets more complex and enjoyable as it warms, don't pass this beer up if you see it."

"Bomber poured into a pint glass. When I think winter warmer, I imagine some red or ruby hues. This looks like a porter or stout. Nice 3/4 inch head that leaves nice lacing. Not much of a nose on this. Faint roasted grain. Maybe a hint of raisin. The taste is good. Not great. It's an easy drinking beer for sure. Very slight roasty flavor. Bit of sweetness. Again that hint of raisin. Really smooth and balanced. Hops are nowhere to be found. They are in there because it is really well balanced but nothing really shines flavor wise. I like this beer more than my review reflects. This is a good beer for a cold winter day. However I think when you slap ""winter warmer""on it, you expect certain flavors to be bolder. This cost $5 and change for a bomber at Full Throttle Bottles. Really good price for this beer."
"O: It's quite good. Its big brother Bourbon Abominable is in a different class on its own, but I can see why this beer would make a great base beer for bourbon aging."

"Pours a dark brown with a sheet of tan foam and a spotty leftover of lace. Nose is lots of caramel, toffee, tawny character - surprised given the SRM here. I like the sweet nose on this one. Flavor is sharply dry with malts and hints of sweetness and a molasses character. The malts have oxidized slightly over the year and have developed a woody character. Medium bodied with moderate carb and a semi dry finish. Nice beer."

"22 oz bottle dated 10.18.11. Beer pours a thick dark brown with a chestnut head. Little aroma. Flavor is immediately spicy. Ingredients (""Down & Dirty"") claim no additives, so the spice must be all in the hops. Otherwise I might have guessed cloves, based on the ""heat"" of the flavor. 8.0% ABV (based on this year's label) doesn't hurt, either. There's a malt backbone to thing thing as well, but flavor-wise, it's lost here. Mouthfeel is pretty good thanks to well-moderated carbonation, but drinkability suffers due to the one dimensional bitterness. Verdict: not my favorite."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with red highlights and a tan head. The aroma is full of roasted malt and chocolate with some nice cream notes mixed in as well. The flavor is similar. The beer is very chocolatey tasting and there is also a nice amount of roasted malt. There is also a little bit of mint in the flavor, which goes well with the other flavors. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Bomber from Malt and Vine poured a clear dark reddish brown with a small lasting brown head. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt, carmel, light vanilla, light earthiness and a hint of spice. Mouthfeel was mediuum bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt, light carmel, light coffee and a hint of spice with a smooth dry lingeing chocolate finish."
"Really liked this, and it got better throughout the time I spent with it."

"Overall. A very nice beer, especially for a winter warmer. I remember a little spice the last time I had it, but not getting much this time ...not that that's a bad thing."
""
""
"Pours a very heave amber holding up a soft brown head and leaving nice ringed lace. Smell of dark rich roasted malt, coffee, dried plums. Taste is rich with the roasted malt, coffee and dark fruits having a nice balance with the mild hops. Mouthfeel is full with mild carbonation making it go down smooth. A tasty rich dark winter ale with subtle alchohol on the senses that goes down well on a cold night."

"All 4's."

"Really solid winter ale, goes really easy on the spice and brings on some big malts. Easy drinking."
"O - Suitable for a winter ale. It could use a bit more spice."

"overall: ok, not my favorite fremont bottling"
"Pours a murky brown with tons of head. Too much if you ask me. No real lacing to speak of with massive bubbles on the head. Smells Pretty non-descript. Some sweetness on the nose and a bit of spice. Tastes dry and sweet. A bit of yeastiness as well. Fairly light on flavour but well balanced.High carbonation and fairly drinkable. Overall, not stellar but definitely not bad"
"D-very drinkable if the head wasn't so prevelant!"
"Drinkability ok, it's smooth and inoffensive, and the 7.5% ABV is well hidden. OTOH, it lacks character, and is boring. Average, generic dark ale, although not your typical winter warmer - darker yet less flavor!"
"This isn't translucent, it's opaque. Absolutely. Less head, aroma as described previously. Mouthfeel is very effervescent from the bottle."
"He followed that with a limited tasting of a bourbon barre aged version which was, perhaps, the best beer I have tasted in the City of Seattle. Stop in, say hello. You will not regret the decision."
"The body is full, smooth, rich and solid. Drinkabilty is very good, this is a great choice to snuggle with. Overall, a very good brew, worth some effort to try."
