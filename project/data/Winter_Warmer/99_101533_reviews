"Overall:  This is a pretty decent beer.  Not bad, but not great either.  Pretty enjoyable as your drinking it, but totally forgettable once it’s drunk.  Worth a try, but not really worth going back too.  I wouldn’t pass it up if offered, but I’m not seeking it out either."

"Taste / Palate: There is a mild bready malt base with some dry spice notes like clove and coriander. I am also picking up a touch of bitter orange peel. It’s palate feels light and the finish is quick and somewhat boring."
"12 ounce bottle, stamp on bottle says best before March 31, 2014. Got this bottle from a friend 2 weeks ago so I didn't get a chance to try it fresh. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a clear copper color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both decent. Aroma is light but nice, the brew smells like caramel and toasted malt, and light sweet spices. I think the taste is the same as the aroma, but the flavors seems stronger in the taste as compared to the weak aroma. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit coating with moderate carbonation. It's not one of the better winter warmer/spiced ales I've had, it's really low on the amount of spicing that's in this brew. Not that it's a bad beer, but I think it's a Christmas ale that doesn't have much kick to it. Maybe I'll try it again next year if I can get a single somewhere."
"Not overly spicy, which I appreciate. Good malt backbone. The cinnamon dominates, overall. Wish that sour note weren't there."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, earth, and Christmas spice aromas. Taste is much the same with sweet malt and Christmas spice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer with decent spice qualities, but nothing stands out about this one."

"This is about as lackluster of a winter warmer as you can get. I guess it could be complimented as being top notch with regard to drinkability. It was certainly tasty, but it wasn't because of what makes this style enjoyable. This was almost a simple lager. I would not get this again. Yes, I could drink this with any lunch or meal, but it's pretty boring if you're looking for a warmer. I'd like this for after working hard on a hot day."

"A drinkable if rather boring winter warmer. The malt warmth and bread-like qualities are the high point for the flavor yet leaves one wishing there was something more to the beer to perk it up. There's some bitter/sweet interplay going on, too, but doesn't really ignite any excitement. Good but a lackluster offering."

"O: Overall unexciting, lacking much holiday spirit and spicing. Nose is virtually non-existent, flavor is rather bland, unfestive with a six pack being a non-recommended factor. Falls below average regards for me, a snoozer that never leaves the gate or defines holiday spirit. bah humbug."

"Crispness is foremost in the feel, and it seems like it's focused on a bit too strongly, but there's about a medium body to this beer with plenty of activity. it fades a little at the end, though, and it seems it just bites too hard and may be covering up that there's not much else to the mouthfeel."

"Poured a light caramel with decent head which faded quickly but left decent lacing in its wake. The smell surprised me, especially for a Saranac and for one that wasn't even a lager: it smelled almost like a Busch light wounded soldier from the night before, or more like several all next to each other. It tasted only a little different (better) than mass produced beer (eg, Busch lite), with some faint floral and herbal notes in the aftertaste. Carbonation was just enough to make it not feel flat, which for an ale is one thing, but this beer quite frankly tastes, looks, and smells a lot more like a lager. Overall I was very disappointed, especially since I really wanted to like this one! Now don't get me wrong, I'm not ranking this with Anhueser-Busch flagship and similar products (those I would never waste time reviewing or ranking), but this is, in my opinion, a very disappointing beer. Look elsewhere for a winter/Christmas/etc beer."

"Nothing about this beer stood out and it really wasn’t a winter warmer to me, but it still was above average. I’d probably give it another try."

"The Verdict: Meh. Tastes like a Miller Light with some allspice sprinkled in. Not impressed."

"Saranac's Spiced Christmas Ale pours a nice clear caramel color with very little head from a 12oz bottle. It has very little smell but what smell there is pretty generic, not much different than your average mass-produced ""beer"". The mouthfeel is light with small, sharp carbonation. Taste is a bit bland for a spiced beer, but there is a slight sweetness to it that kind of reminds you of gingerbread...a little. Overall it's a fine refreshing ale but I wouldn't have branded it as a spiced Christmas product."
"Pours from the bottle with a brilliant orange color and a full, pillowy, eggshell-white head. It's all downhill from there, though. The aroma provides dull, musty hops, some lemon rind, maybe some clove, and a little honey-like sweetness. The flavor is similarly muddled, with a combination of earthy and peppery hops flavors, some semi-tart lemon acidity, and an attempt at balance from some bready malts. The fine, prickly carbonation seems to accentuate the dull bitterness, resulting in the finish having an unpleasant mild astringency. The best-before date on the bottle is more than three months away, but this beer drinks like it is well past its intended freshness."

"Lighter bodied, decently carbonated ale but too thin. Still a good drinkable brew."

"O: This beer is a lot lighter in body compared to most other beers in the winter warmer style but is easy to drink. It's not a bad selection if you really like ginger and nutmeg."
""
""
"a pretty average spiced ale here, cinnamon, clove, ginger, sweet amber malt, cleaner finish, brown sugar sweetness, nothing really out of the ordinary. very well carbonated though, but the body is too thin, the ale yeast is the same one thats in so many saranac beers, and just less interesting and balanced than it could be. what i do like is the big range of spices, its not simple at all, layers of herbs and spices and sugars from malt to brown sugar and honey. on par with some of the other large scale christmas releases, a decent addition to the winter 12er, but i would not buy this as a standalone."

"O: Decent winter warmer, spices could be more pronounced, the mouthfeel felt off for the style."
"Not a great Xmas ale. Generically okay. It was in my mix case, so I'll polish them off eventually without too much strain. Or maybe one or two will still sit in my fridge after January passes, if I can't pawn them off on my girlfriend."
""
"Overall - Not impressed. Probably one of the lightest winter warmers I've had, both in flavor and mouthfeel. Not good. My third Saranac brew from this variety 12-pack, and none have been impressive thus far. I don't expect big things from the other three."
""

""
""
"O: Inoffensive, but hardly anything special. Got it as part of mixed twelve-pack; I certainly wouldn't buy it as a stand-alone in a six-pack, that's for sure."

"Overall - The scent is boring but the taste is acceptable. An xmas beer to appeal to the masses I suppose. Not something I'd pick up again."

"Ant spices and malts on the nose tend to step forward in the taste momentarily to be swept away by an earthy and bitter hop finale."
""
"Very light on the aroma and a bit steely. Faint hint of cinnamon/nutmeg and with no real hop presence initially, emerging faintly with warming. Rather neutral in flavor with fullish pale malts up front, turning to a somewhat oily sweet then spicy conclusion. Notes of nutmeg and peppermint sprinkles linger fairly well. Full feel is pleasant and supportive given other parameters and expectations. Decent balance in that light spicing fits a light bodied brew. In line with brewery experience in the end, predictably ok. Not really a Winter Warmer per se, yet that's as good as any other style bucket for it."

"Pours a clear amber with a fair head and lacing. Slight nose of yeast and spice. Thin bodied. The taste is sort of bland, with only a slight spice flavor. This beer needs more dark malt and spice. Nice carbonation. Crisp finish with no residual aftertaste. A good, but non-complex beer."
""

"O - Not a bad Winter Warmer. I like mine tohave a bit more flavor, but the mild flavor of this brew is a good one. Not mild in a weak or watered down way. Good malty flavor, and a very nice blend of spices. Not overpowering, but you know they're there. Also nice to have a Winter beer that isn't overly sweet. Not an outstanding beer, but I will certainly sample this beer again."

"Pale yellow copper color with heavy carbonation and decent head. Spicy aroma but not much else. Pretty complex flavor. Doesn't feel like it was designed from the ground up, but a base recipe that was changed and rebranded. You can definitely notice the spice, the carbonation and the alcohol. However, it feels like a beer that you can have in quantity and not get sick of. I still had a decent head at the finish. Good sign. Smooth finish."

"Overall a tasty and user friendly spiced ale."
"Overall its a tasty winter warmer that is focused on the spice. Doesnt overdo itself and compromise its drinkability."
