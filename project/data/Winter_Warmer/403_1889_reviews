"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 2/25/2014. Pours fairly clear deep reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, brown sugar, dark bread, chocolate, herbal, light pine, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with good complexity and solid balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. A light metallic note is present in the aromas as well. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, brown sugar, dark bread, chocolate, herbal, light pine, light pepper, and herbal/yeast earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, raisin, plum, fig, brown sugar, dark bread, chocolate, light pepper/pine, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good complexity and solid balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; with a solid malt/bitterness balance and minimal cloying flavors after the finish. Some light metallic/astringency in the taste, but not overpowering. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice English strong ale. All around good complexity, robustness, and solid balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. I felt this could have been better if it were less hoppy, but was a nicely enjoyable offering otherwise."

"Overall:  This is a very interesting beer.  Much more Belgian than English than I was expecting.  Great notes of fruit and spice."

"An old favorite in the ski lodge, but not particularly amazing. Sweet, malty, some chocolate. Solid though. Worth a buy each winter."

"I got a screaming deal on this beer, since we're a little past season (although Spring really hasn't gotten here yet). The beer doesn't taste like its past its prime- I would think it would have a long shelf life. I paid $4.99 a sixer and made sure I grabbed two. Purchased at Hennessey Market in Butte, Montana."
"Overall: very pleasant winter warmer. Enjoyed this sipper."
""
""
"Interesting beer, not a heavy winter ale but with good complexity. Not extraordinary, but worth trying if you dig English beers with different twists."
"British roots run deep with this beer. Biscuit, crystal malts, hints of vanilla, anise, and a moderate bitterness that comes off quite earthy. Overall it is a smooth, nutty, and somewhat musty winter warmer that unfortunately comes off a little thin."

"12 oz bottle. Pours brown with tall, long lasting, fluffy off-white head. Aroma is of herbal, piney hops, spices, dark fruit, brown sugar, coffee and caramel malt. Body is full and tangy. Taste is similar to aroma. Finish is long and dry. It was a perfect brew to drink after shoveling snow."

"A mildly disappointing winter ale, the spice-malt interplay overlooked for the most part, and that edgy metallic nature hard to deny from mid-game on. Simple, perhaps a little too much so, to the point where I'm starting to think about my search for something else now."

"Eleven years later, still a winter favorite of mine."
""
""
"Not too find of this one but I'm glad I was ale to try it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – An OK brew, but the hop, chocolate, coffee, and sweet just never really seem to meld all that well on the tongue. Worth a try, but not the best winter warmer out there."
"I bought this since I had been on a tour of the Pyramid Brewery in Seattle and it was on sale in the store where I bought the Bomber. Definetly worth the 2.49 sale price but would not pick it up otherwise. It is a change of pace and interesting but the burnt toast on the end is just not my thing. the initial roasted chocolate and malts start out well, nice smell. Just does not finish to my taste is all."
""
"Overall I had high hopes for this after a nice aroma, but the taste just doesn't live up to it."

"This pours a medium amber brown color with a pretty big foamy head, so this bottle might be a little over fermented. The aroma is a mixture of malts and spices. Lots of spices in the beginning that turn into a bitter finish. A little too much carbonation behind this which is probably because if the age."

"A decent enough tasting beer, middle of the road or slightly better I guess."
"Well I dont know what to say about this one. I bought a six pack of this on sale at Total Wine. Best by date is 4/15/13, so I thought I was safe with that. However, the first three of these are infected or way overcarbonated, or both. Just a carbonated, foamy mess. If one or two bottles were like this, there may be an explanation. But with three bottles infected, I have to write this off as a bad beer, not infected. Sour and overcarbonated. Some caramel flavors but all in all, a disaster. Stay away from this one."

"O- Solid winter warmer. I must've liked it, three seperate takes before the review."
""

"Poured out of the bottle into a wine glass, did not have the appropiate glassware with me. No head anymore and no carbonation. We thought this beer was gone bad. The opposit was going on. What a surprisingly good beer for it's age !"
""
""
""
"Poured this Winter Warmer from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Poured a dark mahogany color, produced a thin off white head, poor retention and it left an average amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of roasted malt, milk chocolate and alcohol. Medium in body, smooth, a foundation of toasted malt, chocolate, sweet caramel, raisins and dry alcohol which gives way to herbal hop bitterness. Nice session beer, overall avg. for the style."
"I would classify Pyramid as a second-tier craft brewery, but I am quite partial to this winter concoction. It is smokier than smoked salmon. Perhaps nuts sautéed in brown sugar, topped with roasted spices and smoked cheese, and then added to a mild leafy green salad is the best way to describe the way this ale tickles the taste buds. It is very sweet yet defies the label of dessert beer."

"Pours a medium brown with a one finger tan head. Good retention, and very nice lace. Aroma is of dark fruits, and bready malts. Body is a bit on the thin side with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is fruit, with hints of citrus hops. Brown sugar and caramel malts are there as well. Warmed me up a bit!"
""
""
""
"O: A complex, warming beer great for taking the edge of a cold day. This would pair well with rich, hearty meal like beef stew or a standing rib roast. Since this beer does have spices in it I'd be inclined to call it an Old Ale."
"O - This is a decent winter warmer that I won't avoid. It's pretty easy to drink, but it's not particularly memorable. I served my beer right out of the cellar at 50 degrees. This beer might be better served cold, but ideally that wouldn't be the case, right? Probably worth trying."
""
""
"Heavy beer, good for lazy weekends in the winter. Has a chocolatey note, gets you numb rather than buzzed. Finishing a bottle of this is like reading a well-written but dense book - ultimately satisfying and enriching, but it takes a lot of effort and an investment of time."
""
""
"Snow Cap – The bottle says: “Deep mahogany in color, our full-bodied winter water is brewed in the spirit of British winter ales. Crafted with a flurry of roasted chocolate and caramel malts, and generously hopped, it delivers a smooth finish that makes this beer the perfect cold weather companion.”"
"Overall - A decent ale. The flavor is not as rich as the smell is, but it's still fairly good or drinkable at the very least."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a nice example of the style that I will be returning to in the future. If you enjoy the Winter Warmer style of ale, check this out you won't be disappointed."
""
""
"Atmosphere is okay. Decent hue, underwhelming head, and just a bit of lacing that mostly retreats back in the body of the brew. Nose is nondescript combination of malts with a little fresh tea and a hint of sweetness. Flavor follows suit with a light combination of earthy malt, bitter pecan shells, offset with just the lightest sweet hint. Overall, this is a fair quaff."
"Overall, I think it is a good solid winter time beer."

"Dark and Malty with a nice finish and hoppy flavor..a truly great winter warmer.. one of my favorite tasting winter beers. its light enough to drink but still has a dark flavor. the complexity of flavor is a true experience and shows that pyramid knows how to brew beer! i love portland microbrews"
"O - There are others in this style I tend to like much more (Old Fezziwig...) but wouldn't mind having this again."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not bad for a winter warmer, but I would choose others over this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, it’s a solid beer to drink for a while."
""
""
"My expectations were exceeded. Tasty and highly drinkable. Above average."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: a superbly complex winter beer. I found myself trying to place the fruitiness, but found it hard to pick out any specific flavors. that said, it's interesting and keeps me coming back for more :-)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It surprised me with the hop finish. It's a decent beer that I would try again."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark reddish brown, dark, with touches of foam remaining. Some bubbles. Light smell. Some cherry fruit. Faint chocolate. Taste opens as a wall of hop, some dark chocolate, some raspberry. Bittering really remains and creates a problematic aftertaste. Good flavor in here, but just too bitter to really enjoy."
"Full body. Has some qualities that remind me of a weizenbock. Sweet dark fruits, a little watery on the tongue. Balance is there but a touch on the sweet side. Concise flavors that blend well together but its nothing wowing. In fact its quite a simple beer. Underlying notes of roasted malts as the beer warms a bit but mostly fruity. Drinkable but wouldn't buy it again just cause there are better options."
""
"I would definitely choose it as a winter warmer anytime, well worth the time."
""
""
"Overall pretty drinkable that I think most people would enjoy. Outshined by many others in the winter warmer category."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, deep, ruby-brown coloring with a frothy, off-white head that starts tall but quickly rescinds into a filmy coating. Aromas of malt sweetness, both rich and slightly spiced. Subtle old world fruit aromas fill the nostrils, while light nutmeg and cinnamon spicings highlight. Flavors are heavy and rich, with date and fig starting the ride. Chocolate profiles come shortly after, with an overall roasted backbone. The body is kept light by the carbonation levels, keeping all the rich and heavy flavors in check. Rich, slightly dark and cloying finish with a date/fig/raisin aftertaste. Not bad, and not overly boozey for a warmer."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 5/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, alcohol, strong sweet malt, slight pale malt, slight caramel malt, and a hint of yeast. Fits the style of a Winter Warmer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with a high carbonation level. Tastes of strong sweet malt, slight caramel malt, hops, hint of roasted malt, slight alcohol, hint of pale malt, and slight yeast. Overall, good blend, aroma, and body. The high carbonation level in this brew was a detriment."
"I was a bit disappointed with this beer after liking the Chai Wheat so much. It just didn’t really do anything for me. I’ve had some better winter warmer styles."
""
"O: not a bad brew. Tastes good and I love the roasty beers. So glad winter is coming!"

"12oz bottle -- screw top -- served in pint glass. Beer pours a deep cola brown with a thin chestnut head. Intense aroma, though possible ester/banana character? Flavor is pretty flat: strong enough bitterness just to cover the 7% ABV, but no particular hop character. Thick body that stays dry but not chalky. No detectable spice flavor for me."
"Overall - A really, really good winter warmer. One of Pyramid's better offerings."
""
""
"Overall - A pretty good winter warmer. This is my first beer from this brewer and I am looking forward to trying more of their line up. It seems well crafted and had a nice fruitiness to it."

"I was ready to give this beer a good rating. I bought a six-pack and didn't drink it right after I bought it. Now it has some debris settling at the bottom. I don't know what this is but in the past it's always a bad sign. I don't know if it means the beer is going bad or what, but that's what it seems like. I've had this beer before and that's why I got it again. Maybe there should be an expiration date?"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a 14 oz ""pint"" glass. Pours a dark brown, almost black with lots of carbonation showing on the glass and a tiny white head that goes away almost immediately. Smells of dark malts, a little bit of a toffee like smell, and a little bit of coffee. Tastes of dark caramelized malt, and a slight hint of a sweet candy type taste. Seems like it is a little overcarbonated, but still goes down nicely. Overall, a good beer."

"O: Paired nicely with a rare porterhouse steak."
""

""

"I'm not the biggest pyramid fan but I figured I'll try this. Poured from a 12 oz bottle, not sure of the freshness date. This pours a dark brown color with a pretty nice tan head which has good retention. The smell is a little light but some caramel malts and spice. The body is medium. The taste is okay, a little spice and bitterness, along with some caramel malts."
"O: Kind of tasted like a hopped up honey mashed with pine and spruce needles, or maybe even a hoppy brown. Not outstanding.... I would call this a safe winter. Had it's moments.... Probably won't buy again."
""
""
""

"A fairly run of the mill beer, not anything I would seek out in the future."
"O: Nice winter warmer, nothing over the top. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark copper with a huge 3 inch foamy beige head that settles to a small cap. Random streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, dark fruits, and some spice aromas. There is also a distinct apple cider aroma I am getting. Taste is of bready malt, caramel, subdued fruit, and some herbal hop flavors. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good Winter warmer but nothing too exciting."
""
""
""
"I recently tried Maritime’s Jolly Roger, also from Seattle. It costs about $2 more and tastes $8 better (hey, that’s how much Snowcap costs!). Panhandle that $2 if you have to, there’s no good reason you anyone should set their winter warmer bar this low, and there’s other better, just as local winter warmers out there."
"D: Different for a winter warmer, but still a flavorful and quite satisfying. ABV is a little high for a session, but it works well to cope with those chilly winter nights."
""
"Overall - This is ok, more hoppy then i expected, and the malt flavors arent that impressive. A decent beer, nothing special, a ok winter seasonal."
"overall: I glad I split this beer."
"very generic type winter seasonal. pours a redish hue of brown with a very small head that disappears almost instantly. smells a bit spiced like mulled wine, same aromotics. the flavor is definitely more balanced with piney hops and a residual sweetness. beer is full bodied and has low to moderate carbonation. overall i found this to be a pretty average winter warmer, has all the critical components but does nothing to excite me in any rousing way."
"In conclusion, this is a favorable bitter-sweet decoction."
""
""
""
""
"Drink- Not overly great but to start a night off its pretty good. A little above average. Probably not gonna return to this one."
""
""

"I'm from TEXAS! Rigga dig dig dig dig rigga dig dog dig deer!"
""
"O - Looks great. Not much on the nose. Taste is ok. Mouthfeel is sufficient. Overall, Snow Cap is an ok winter ale. Worth a try."
"This is a full bodied ale that would be a winter warmer for the hop head. So I took it as it is because the balance in this ale is so good that I had a little of both worlds of taste. I just wish there was a little more spice, but I give this ale thumbs up!"
"Overall a drinkable beer but Jubilale is far superior."
"overall - the aftertaste isn't amazing, the beer lacks balance and has some sharp characteristics that aren't that great"

"T: Yikes. I read some of the other reviews of this and it seemed that other people thought this was pretty good. So maybe this was just a bad bottle, but yikes. It tasted like sucking on a pine cone with an aftertaste of aspirin. Pine and bitterness just for the sake of bitterness. Not a whole lot else going on. I could barely finish this."
"Overall- I usually have the winter warmers when they start to come out every year. The only one that I keep going back to is Jubelale. I believe this is the first time I have had snowcap. I assumed it to be a bland winter warmer, but am wrong. This is better than some out there for sure. I will be getting this again. 4/5"
"O - overall, an interesting beer. I don't know that I would go for it again, but enjoyable none the less. The licorice aroma in particular was interesting."
"over all this was a nice beer but not one I would drive out of my way for."
"Overall a good but not great winter warmer. I can still enjoy this as a sentimental favorite but thankfully better versions of the style are available."
"O: The best beer from Pyramid that I've had and maybe the best Winter Warmer I've had."
"I salute Pyramid for restoring this beer to its proper place. I was nearly ready to write it off but am glad I tried this version."
"Poured a deep mahogany with a modest white head that lingered as a thin layer of dense bubbles. Mostly malts and licorice in the nose. Roasty malts, licorice, anise in the taste with a touch of pine and nutmeg; a bit medicinal at times, but not intolerably so. Medium mouthfeel, and fairly drinkable."
"Smooth and creamy this is my favorite brew from Pyramid (not saying much) and one of my favorite winter seasonals (saying a lot)"
"Concluding thoughts: Not bad for its style. It was only $8.00 for a six pack and beats out alot of beer of this style, in this price range (at least from what I have tasted). Wouldn't mind getting it again, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
"A classic winter staple in these parts. A respectable, if uninspiring, winter warmer. Not one I'd rush to the store and get or be anywhere near the top of my list unless I was on a budget and had to get a winter-style ale. I actually haven't even had one of these in a few years, but I used to drink them quite frequently before I discovered the better choices out there. I do remember a conspicuous alcohol taste with not much complexity at all but will definitely warm you up on a cold winter night."
"Drinkability is moderate in this one. It's best enjoyed only one or two in a sitting as its more on the heavy side. The alcohol is warming however and all in all, this is a good beer for the winter."
"Summary: This is an average beer. I gave it 7.0/10, or C-. This has an extremely hoppy taste even for an ale. I liked the smell, but I can barely taste any of the malts or spice. It would be better if it were more balanced. It is very filling, has nice alcohol content, and warms me up like it says it should. It also makes me hungry and sleepy. I would drink this beer sparingly, but would never turn it down if offered one."
"The mouthfeel if smooth and creamy. Not too dry and balance more toward sweetness, but not overly so. The carbonation level is low and seems to pair well with this style. There is some nice lacing on the glass and I would recomend this as an evening sipper. You can taste the 7% and it is pleasing."
"Final Notes: A solid Winter Warmer. It's no Descutes Jubelale or anything, but it's a very pleasing beer. Great beer to pair with dessert. I'll be coming back for more."
"D: Overall, a very drinkable beer. A fine example of the winter warmer style with a nice malty sweetness. I would purchase this beer again if in the mood for a nice winter beer."
"D: I have 5 more of these. I might share one but will likely drink the others."
"Poured into glass and got only about a 1/4 inch of head that was down to a small ring of froth in a few minutes. The beer is mahogany with a nice redish color up to the light. Not much of an aroma on this beer. Beer felt good in the mouth, the tickling of carbination despite the lack froth. Really light on the front end, with some subtle hops and a smooth coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. The back end follows with some pronounced pine hops. It is a good winter warmer, sipping beer. More flavors come out as it warms up a bit."
"A medium body but feels fairly light. For this style, its pretty sessionable if you're in the mood."
"Despite all the other Winter Brews in the season, I happened to like this one for its drinkability. I mean its keeps you warm and you can have a few with that ""Full"" feeling. Its also a great beer to give to your friends. Perhaps to introduce them to Seasonal Beer or Craft Brew for that matter. Sure theres better X-Mas beer than this but than again this aint' to bad either. Go out and buy some, you wont be disappointed."
"D - interesting, unique and no significant flaws make for a great sipper."
"Drinkability: I think this is my first winter warmer, and I like this as an example. With it being so malty, I am not sure I could drink more than two at one sitting. This is a beer I can get in Utah."
"Pours a nice inch of head, doesn't hang in there that long though. Smells very malty, I get subtle hints of coffee and maybe chocolate malt. Taste is much like the smell, subtle taste of coffee, very malty. Not much else in the taste to talk about, kinda boring other than those two things. Not a bad beer, very drinkable, just kinda boring and average."
"I really was digging Snow Cap's old label art, the new one is pretty cheesy. This is a great beer to have while shoveling snow! I've done it before.."
"D: This is one of my favorite (non-special) winter warmers. Great beer for the price. I've purchased this beer several times now. It's also one of my favorite beers by pryamid"
"Drinkability: For an English Strong Ale, it is a little weak, as it comes across as more of an Irish Red."
"Snow Cap was a nice surprise. Give it a try if you want a winter seasonal that's not too heavy."
"Overall - I was pleasantly surprised here. I'm a big fan of winter warmers and I thought this one was quite good. The thickness of the beer almost coats the mouth a little too much, leaving nearly a film, but I quite enjoy this one."
"Pours an extremely dark red color (almost brown) with a medium white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is somewhat roasty with sweet chocolatey notes.Lots of maltiness as well. Taste is initially roasted malt with some tasty dark fruits. Then I get slight hoppiness with chocolate and dark licorice. Lots of maltiness carry on throughout with small hints of alcohol and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is pretty full-bodied with a nice creamy finish. Although winter warmers are not even close to being one of my favorite styles, it is pretty tasty with descent drinkability."
"This is my favorite Pyramid beer."
"The best things in life are made from components that are in balance. This is just way too much for my taste."
"Had this in a hotel room in Portland before heading out to celebrate a buddy's birthday. Pours an amber-brown colour with huge head and lots of lacing. Quite a malty aroma, bread like almost. Are there spices in here? There may be, but it is quite faint if it is. Incredibly sweet beer, but it is nice. Smooth mouthfeel. This is better than I was expecting it to be. It hides the alcohol well."
"Single bottle poured into a pint glass. Color has a nice cola hue to it. Not much head, with minimal lacing. Smell reminded me of a sugary cinnamon roll. Taste was pretty nice. I liked the spiciness to this beer. Lots of winter spices that go well in this style of beer. Plenty of malt noticed on the palate, but would have liked to seen a bit more hops to balance things out. Another seasonal that hides its abv very well. Snow Cap is surely a good choice for a winter beer from this well-know West Coast brewery."
"Served in a pint glass poured from a 22 oz bomber. Pyramid is a local brewery here in Seattle, and I love making it down to their brewhouse for some exclusive beers including this beer aged in bourbon barrels!"
"First noticed a small head that dissipated rather quickly. Some lacing on the glass. Reddish-brown in color. A malty aroma with some hoppyness. Taste is toasted malt sweetness upfront, a bit of spicyness in the middle followed by bitterness. Very Smooth medium body. Very drinkable. i did not even notice the 7%. A worthy winter seasonal."
"Morey's Bottom Line: A nice beer. Glad I picked up this single bottle. Has some of the darker flavors of Anchor Christmas combined with the likes of Old Fezziwig."
"Nice appearance with a mediocre smell but complex flavors all combine to make a this a rich/robust, full-bodied winter warmer. Even though there is barely any bitterness, it does not distract or hurt the overall impact of this beer. I will recommend this to others."
"I try to be as objective as I can in the reviews, and Snow Cap lacks the complexity to compare with a lot of beer on this website. That being said, I really enjoyed Snow Cap and would definitely purchase it again. It's merely a plain jane sort of beer."
"Pours a deep black color with a thick white head that never goes away and a wealth of lacing. Smells of toasted malts and a full blast of hop aroma. Tastes very one note: like a foray of hop bitterness on top of even more bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is okay."
"Drinkability - not a bad brew, and not at all a bad representation of the style. Although possibly a little too filling for highly-repeated sampling."
"Very clear amber/copper hued beer with a fizzy, near finger-width head. Dark coloring, fairly handsome. Smell is of mature cherries, caramel malts and some faint generic hops. Taste features smokey dark malts, balanced pretty well with slightly tinny hops. Noticeable prickly fruity edge, with a fairly strong bitter finish. This beer had a very unique smokey charcoal character-- was this malt smoked over something? Has a distinct earthy- quality to it. Not bad, I liked the fruit character and accompanying sweet caramel malts. Too much aggressive hops in the finish. for me, and that odd charcoal taste got old a while. I can see drinking a few of these stronger beers in the dead of winter."
"Pours a moderate brown color with a bit of caramel. The nose is caramel and toffee with some slight malt. There is a bit of spicing in there as well. The taste is again slight malt and brings a bit of spicing, but doesn't go over the top Decent body and while this doesn't bring too much spice like many of the style, it ends up being quite tame and plain."
"I was pleasantly surprised -- a balanced and full-flavored offering from Pyramid."
"Overall - I'm not too big into Pyramid brews personally, but this one makes for a pretty decent offering. As the winter warmer tag suggests, it does in fact, make for a good beer to drink during colder weather!"
"Flavor: A warming alcohol beginning leads into a fruity and spicy middle, dominated by figs and raisins though some cherry and citrus can be detected. This full bodied winter beer (the only reason drinkability scored relatively low for me) is sure to be enjoyed in the coming months."
"Came an opaque dark brown with a richly brown head that faded moderately quickly but laced very well throughout the drink. It smelled rich and toasty with a touch of hoppyness coming through. Tasted similar, and the bitterness of the hops helped to balance the roasted grains well. Rather thin for this type and if it had been thicker I think I would have enjoyed it more. This did help its drinkability though, especially on a warm day."
"Got this at Freddies to go with dinner. Pours deep amber with ruby edges, small white head that quickly falls, leaving behind nice lacing. Smells of sweet malts, alcohol, bitter fruit. Taste is astringent hoppy bitter up front, dark breads and coffee; slight sweetness lingers on the back with some more subdued coffee. Hop bitterness hides the alcohol; if it weren't for the bitterness this would be well balanced. Mouthfeel is a bit watery but helps the drinkability significantly. If this were any thicker tasting as it does now, it would loose major points. I'll finish the sixer, but I think I'll stick to Jube for winter warmers."
"Weather starting to cool down these days so thought I'd get myself a higher ABV beer to sip on. I've usually found Pyramid beers to be at least decent, but really not a fan of this beer. For a beer you're supposed to sip on there's not much complexity at all to it, and just tastes flat. Haven't had too many other beers of this style, so maybe it's just the style I'm not a fan of. Should have saved my money bought PBR."
"D- Def some more robust winter warmers out there. Wassail from Full Sail and Jubelale from Deschutes are go to brews. But-- for 2.79 I suppose this one could be found in the fridge on occasion. (I mean, I am a student soooo..)"
"D-This is nothing to get excited about. Winter Warmer is one of my favorite styles, but the 7.0% ABV is about this beer's best feature. Overall, lackluster."
"Nothing earth-shattering but definitely solid. Malt, hops and alcohol seem to hit all the right targets for the style. Very safe to say this is a good pic for a winter seasonal."

"Been sitting on this for a bit, and didn't seem to change over time. Taste the same as it did years ago before the awful package change, but that's a whole other story. Taste is a malty chocolate, doing a good job masking the 7%. Overall a very drinkable winter brew, i'm glad they didn't add all that funky stuff like tree limbs, tire iron or other crap from the spice rack, and just make a good traditional winter beer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts and chocolate. Taste is like the smell, malts and chocolate, a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and is very drinkable. Overall this is a fine offering."
"D - Alright, but kind of week for a winter warmer. A little bit taken away due to the nasty, apple peel aftertaste. Nothing that memorable."
"Hazy chocolate brown in color. Off-white head dissappears quickly with creamy reminents. Aroma is fruity and spicy. Lots of complex flavors here. Robust floral hops. Spicy cinnamon and nutmeg. Dark fruits. Whole wheat toast. Molasses and caramel sweetness. Also a touch of roasted coffee and chocolate flavor. Medium to full-bodied ale, a smooth mouthfeel and warming from the alcohol. I'm impressed with this one. Tons of rich and spicy flavors which are well balanced. A solid winter seasonal and good in the summer too."
"D - Not a good warm weather beer for sure. There are too many contradictory flavors. And the bottom line is this is not at all close to any winter warmer I've heard of before. It's more like an amber ale with a bit of caramel as an afterthought."
"Generally I have been underwhelmed by the beers from Pyramid but this one pretty good. Full flavoured and well balanced this makes for a very drinkable malt forward Winter Warmer. The beer has some caramel on the finish and is on the drier side. Could drink a few of these"
"Cant imagine drinking too many of these. Granted, im not a huge fan of malty beers anymore, but this one is hard to finish. Sharp and full, its not a bad brew. Just not something I imagine drinking very often. Glad I tried it, glad to be moving on."
"D-this gets better as it warms, slightly grainy in flavor but has some nice spices in there and a decent balance."
"Not bad, not bad. Poured with a medium light tan head that mostly subsided and a little lace. Color is a dark, (hard to say if a little hazy or not) mahoganey. Aroma is malty, roasty, and a little spicey. Flavor is similar, but much richer. Has more of the bitter/sweet thing obviously, but also certain other flavors such as caramel, toffee, black pepper, chilli pepper, and dates. Full body and good carbonation. Tiny bit boozy at the very end. Could be a session."
"D- It's ok, not really my cup of tea but ok."
"Drinkability was just OK. 7.00 ABV and average taste made it average."
"Pours a clear dark ruby, with a finger of short-lived shadowy white head that leaves a similarly short-lived bit of lacing behind. The smell is sweet, with darker malts, figs, and a snap of cinnamon firing through near the end of a deep sniff. The taste takes a surprising one-eighty spin toward hoppiness, with heavy pine notes stampeding over the initial sweet maltiness. It all seems very unbalanced and, rather than being a gradual shift, sudden in the flavor change. The moderate body and crsip finish help, but cannot overcome the poor balance and overly active carbonation, which keep the drinkability lower than it otherwise would be."
"BEER NOTES: I had two of these for this tasting and learned two things. 1. This brew needs to breath for a while before drinking. It really helps soften the alcohol taste. 2. Let this beer come up to just below room temp and treat it like liquor for serving purposes."
"The beer pours brilliantly clear dark amber bordering on brown with an off-white head. The aroma is moderate-high malt, pronounced sweet caramel, dark fruit, and a bit of alcohol. The flavor is much like the smell--bittersweet caramel with moderate hop bitterness that keeps the beer from being cloying. The body is bordering on full, carbonation is moderate and just a bit of alcoholic warmth. Overall a nicely made warmer--intense malt balanced by solid hop bitterness and a hint of booze."
"Buy Again? Yes"
"Overall a solid and enjoyable but not incredibly exciting beer. In years past I used to anxiously wait for for this seasonal to show up at the pub, then one year I suddenly lost a taste for it and haven't had it in a long time. I have to be honest I expected to give this a mediocre review but after breaking it down it actually isn't bad."
"D - Not bad but just mediocre. What we have here is an overly dry and bland earthy beer. Not very winter-ish. A bit too thin in flavor as well."
"D - I actually really enjoyed this and could have at least 2 or 3 in a session. I'm surprised other reviews were so low for this beer. I think this is solid."
"Good fall/winter brew, but not one I'd seek out often. Better on tap than from the bottle."
"From what I have had, this is probably Pyramid's best beer. A very simple Winter Warmer, but not bad at all."
"An invigorating and impressive beer."
"Mouthfeel delightfully sticks around. No dissipation throughout, comes close to being a desert beer, a very drinkable beer when you stick to one or two a night."
"Conclusion: Nothing really offensive here (except for the fact that it's a bit boozy) but there aren't a lot of redeeming qualities either. There are a lot better Winter Warmers (both imports and domestics) to pick up."
"A nice winter warmer, nothing stands out too much, just a solid beer that is very drinkable."
"Overall a fairly average beer. Just another malty lightly hopped beer in my book."
"I enjoy some of the Pyramid beers, but this is not a winner for me."
"Have been drinking this beer for many, many years. While nothing special, it's a solid offering, and one of the better beers made by Pyramid Brewing these days."
"drinkability: very affordable and a well masked sessionable abv. there are just alot of other winter warmers with much more flavor."
"Really hit the spot at the Christmas party last night, and by the end of the night my shoes had tasted a decent amount of it too."
"I wasn't terribly impressed with Snow Cap, but given the ambiguity of the style, I would consider it a worthy selection at the ski lodge bar."
"It is a very drinkable beer that leaves you with a good feeling."
"Overall: I'm a little annoyed that the 6-pack was a year old, but overall, this beer is nicely aged and a delicious sipper."
"Not my cup of tea for a winter beer. Malty, medicinal, minty flavor. The beer pours a relatively dark amber with a smallish head. The aroma is a mixture of band-aids and mint with some malt presence. The flavor is a tad sweet for my liking. It's not a terrible strong ale, but it's not terribly interesting or worth another purchase. Jubelale may be a dollar or two more for a six pack, but it's worth it."
"Copper bodied brew with light offwhite head that died quickly and left a little lace. A malty aroma with hints of both sweet and roasted and very minor spice; no hops. Thicker than expected, but still medium bodied, with a decent malt base that is both dry and sweet if not minor, and a little spice and hop bitterness make for a bland but still decent winter warmer (for mass market consumption). Goes down easy and while I won't seek this out it is not a bad beer at all."
"Drinkability - Decent to drink but there are far better winter warmers and better brews from Pyramid. A little bit of a let down from Pyramid, but it's not a totally bad brew."
"Clear mahogany with a mat of creamy off-white head that lasts and leaves plenty of lace behind. Insipid aroma of raw hops and barely sweet malt. Coarse hop bitterness (not hop flavor) overwhelms the palate making the caramel maltiness barely detectable. A tornado of carbonation scrubs the tongue clean of what little flavor there is and gives a displeasing mouthfeel. I think one of these is more than enough."
"Overall it is quite drinkable, but not something I will go in search of when Oregon provides so many other options this time of year."
"Drinkability- pretty good, would drink it again but have had better winter warmers"
"Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium...and is drinkable. Not one of the best winter warmers I've had (and frankly, I've had better from Pyramid)..but still a good offering. Try it out."
"Drinkability: this was the beer of record for my band's halloween party this year, so I salvaged one to review on a more sober occasion. I will say that, overall, this beer is quite drinkable, and could be dangerous in the wrong hands (i.e., mine)."
"im not much of a winter warmer fan, but this is pretty standard amongst breweries these days it seems"
"glassware: pint"
"taste is creamy a little bit of sour malt, some caramel, some nuts, and a little spice, ends bitter, slightly dry."
"- Actually one of the better winter seasonals I have had yet this year... and I would have to say it hangs up there with Jubelale if not better... but it is different for sure."
"Nice malty mixture, its also in the aroma of a darkish and big off-white head drink with cola and spice.Very drinkable this one, one of the best I have had from the brewery.Some sugar,anise, fruit like apricot,mild ginger, a tad above average mouthfeel."
"Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into my dimpled mug. Appears a clear dark apricot color with two fingers of lingering light ecru foam. Smells and tastes of sweet, medium toasted bready grains, spicy hops, a bit of brown sugar. Creamy, medium body with adequate carbonation for it's style. Worth trying."
"Drinkability: Considering the 7.0% alc, it is remarkably smooth. This beer was decent."
"Good winter beer, can be drank during cold seasons or spring. Not the best winter beer but a solid b+, a-."
"Pours off brown with slight haze, thin white head dissipates quickly to a thin white rim. Nose is weak, without much to report, but perhaps a faint mocha. Palate has a brown sugary, high alcohol character to it, and it finishes rather warm. Winter warmer, yes, but not in a good way."
"Eric"
"This is one of the spicier winter warmers I've had. Which I enjoy. Decent brew, some work on the aroma and body would make it great."
"The color is mahogany to near-black. A tan head pours pretty tight and leaves a few light patches of lacing. A nice blend of malts and hops with some spices. The taste is nicely balanced with more of a licorice in the flavor to back up some good malts. Unlike many winter warmers, spices are well-blended and by no means overpowering. They mix nicely in the flavor. The mouthfeel is pretty thick with a nice medium to full body and a lingering malt and light licorice finish. The hops are also a little more prominent than in most winter warmers and adds to the balance. Overall a drinkable beer."
"Black body and a medium-sized light tan head. Bunch of blended together spices in the aroma. I think I was able to pick out some liccorice. Little bit of stout-like roastiness, that I haven't had in a winter warmer before. Flowery hops add a nice bitterness, and provide another dimension of flavor. Overall a good winter warmer, but this is dominated by the hops instead of the spices and malt."
"I keep craving more. It is hoppy to the point of pleasing and teasing the palate, making you want another, but not assaulting or insulting your palate"
"D- I'd have this on again; I like the lingering bitter finish."
"Rather odd. The beer isn't bad but it isn't something that stands out either."
"Hits the tongue with a little sweetness but finishes very hoppily."
"Daaark brown, with 3 finger frothy off white head. Get big hops up front, sweetness in the middle, then the hop bite at the end. This is on the very verge of being too bitter for me. would prefer the sweetness be a little more than it is. actually pretty suprised by how bittern this one is, considering how dark the beer was, just visually it looked like a bigger beer. For me, this is not even close to being near the top for its style."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Overall this one strikes me as a bit thin on the palate. Sure it has some weight to it on the palate, but there's still an overall watery quality to it in my opinion. I won't lie, it is full bodied, but the longer I let it set in my mouth the more like water it begins to feel, it almost seems like it starts to thin. Unfortunately the alcohol is hidden so well in this brew that it doesn't even warm as it goes down. I've a real problem with winter warmers that don't warm as they go down. That's the whole point isn't it? I really don't think I've had a winter warmer to date that has warmed my throat and belly. This one is easy enough to drink, and the alcohol is well hidden in this brew, for the price this isn't a bad deal. This isn't one I'd rush to pick up, and also its not one that I'd not be adverse to another go-round with."
"I tried this one the first time a couple weeks ago because a buddy of mine had bought a keg of it for one of our team meets. It didn't immediately get drained so I had my doubts about it. I was wrong. It's a very strong brew for what it is. Very rich flavor with coffee and espresso notes. Very smooth, creamy feel on down. Drinkability is not so high because of the acquired taste of these types of brews and definitely not a session beer. Overall, a decent winter brew but not for everyone."
"Pours a dark brown colored body, with a smallish off-white head, diminishing. Strong fruit, a malty aroma. Some sweet spiciness, and mustiness. A little alcohol. Some sickly cloying sweetness, maybe like brown sugar. Fizzy, malty taste. Bitter aftertaste, with some hotness. Some sweet spiciness in the body too. Musty tasting, that same cloying sickly sweetness. Dark fruit, and sweet spiciness. Somewhat light flavor. Okay spiced winter warmer style. Would be better on a colder day."
"Pretty drinkable."
"Surely there must be some wheat in here, the flavor is dark toasty malts with plenty of bittering hops and earthy wheat. Some roasty and toffee notes creep in there as well further into the glass. Has a creamy and full mouthfeel, but yet is easy to back more than one. A pretty decent brew that deserves a try for winter seasonal fans"
"Drinkability? The alcohol is well hidden but the flavours I'm getting aren't all that interesting. This will be a one of six pack for me."
"A decent beer, it's American characteristics come through in the hop department."
"D - A tasty winter warmer w/ plenty of spice, malt and hops to keep it balanced. A nice finish without any overdone sweetness. A nice strength for quaffing, but I wouldn't have expected it to be 7% to be honest - I consider this a good choice for a winter ale."
"Pours a thick, dark brown with a slight slight brown head. Smells like a warmer! Cinnamon and nutmeg for sure. Good mouthfeel--solid body and carbonation, the hints of spiciness already on the palatte. The taste ain't bad.. definite spiciness and finishes with a slight bite. I think the aftertaste is kind of alcohol-y. A decently drinkable brew."
"Overall: A decent winter warmer but nothing to write home about. Another good release from Pyramid breweries."
"Overall, not a very exciting winter beer. The flavors just don't do it for me."
"Tried a 12 oz. bottle of this, decanted into a pint glass. Pours a pretty dark red with a very thin head. Not much retention. Aromas are pretty simple: malty, some spices, some dark fruit like cherries. Taste has a strong malty center. Fairly nutty, a light hoppy finish to it. Kinda bitter. It travels a bit, but it's not the most dynamic winter warmer I've tried. Middling mouthfeel - not quite watery, but there's next to no carbonation. Easily drinkable, one worth trying, but again not the greatest winter warmer out there."
"Pyramid's 2008 warmer has a nice balance of sweet, bitter, and warm and becomes especially creamy as it warms to room temperature. A very enjoyable drinking experience."
"Medium body with medium carbonation. One of the better Winter Warmers I've had this season. Lots of character, velvety smooth in the mouth with just enough alcohol to give you a mild warming sensation."
"Drinkability is farily good on this one. It is a good beer that has a good all around performance. Not anything too special butsomething that many could enjoy."
" Overall, not super complex but pretty tasty and drinkable-2 or 3 after shoveling snow would fit the bill nicely, and at 7.0 abv would ease the soreness"
"Overall- Inferior end product in a sea of similar holiday recipes. Drinkable, but not with much enthusiasm. Give me an Anchor Steam Christmas beer anytime."
"Overall: The beer mouthfeel is astringent and the finish is bitter. The finish linger on the palate for a few moment. The Beer is decent. The beer to me isn't well put together. I was hoping for more from it. The malt doesn't stand up to the hops in the beer and the mouth feel isn't warming. To me the beer is sub par. I would have like to seen a more complete blended beer, instead of being tasting different components."
"A full-bodied, dark brown ale loaded with flavors and aromas of roasted malt. The strong malt backbone gives this ale hints of dark fruits, coffee, chocolate, and oak. A slightly sweet warming alcohol sensation is present on the finish along with a light hop bitterness"
"D: Well, it went down fine but it's a little uninspiring there are other winter warmers I'd rather deal with."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer much more in a bottle than I did on tap. The hops were more dominating in this version of the beer and I think that made it better. While it is still far from my favorite Winter Warmer, it is still a very solid brew."
"D: I'm not a real winter warmer guy but this was very drinkable though much more than one or two would really kill your ability to taste anything else"
"Poured into straight pint glass. Poured with a one finger head, as is my preference. Head dissipated quickly. Not much lacing. A very beautiful dark reddish-brown color. Nice spice notes and a faint alcohol presence in the aroma. Typical Winter Warmer flavors, with a raisiny component. A slight alcohol bite, not at all unpleasant. The body is a little thin for the style, and the flavors don't linger on the tongue. Very drinkable, but probably wouldn't have more than a couple in a row. While I'm not a big fan of this brewery, I look forward to this release every year. You could do much worse than this for your winter ale needs."
"D-Quite smooth. For a fuller-bodied beer, it's quite easy to drink. I'd drink this one again, as it's maybe one of the better winter brews I've enjoyed this season."
"D- Easy to drink for such a high ABV%"
"Body is medium and the carbonation is medium to light. Overall this is a good holiday ale, and for the price I'd definitely have another."
"My father in law intoduced me to Snow Cap for the firt time. My first experience with anything from Pyramid, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. A dark ale, with some hints of the usual winter warmer style spices. Not a blow-your-mind kind of beer, but a respectable seasonal brew. Very easy to drink, despite the slight alcohol taste, nice warming at 7% alcohol. Not bad at all"
"Overall, an enjoyable beer, I will try again."
"This beer is not for all or myslef for that matter, prefer something with some kind of hops to it, which this beer had noe of."
"I don't know about this one. Aroma is nothing to speak of, because there isn't one. IT looks great, clear amber, no head. The taste is sour. A mix of malt, spice, and sweat. The aftertaste was very sweet, making you forget how sour the actual beer is. I'd go back for more, and then remember, and repeat again. I could not get over it. Get something else."
"Very nice complex flavors, not too bitter or heavy, goes down smooth. Only downside is the over carbonation but that can be overlooked. Would buy again, recommend."
"Poured a deep deep amber. Nose is a nice sweetness, with definate fruit undertones. Taste was very similar to the smell, banana, but mostly a carmelized brown sugar flavoring. There were hints of spice, but it was mostly sweet. Not sickly or overpowering sweet, but a nice flavor. Very nice in the mouth, slight tingle to the tounge."
"The hop flavor makes this unique. The bitterness could be more than enough for some, but I like how it holds off the richness of the malt and makes it unique for style. Flavors adjust throughout the drink. I would have this again."
"D - For the record, I hate mint. I hate brushin my teeth with mint flavored toothpase, and I hate mint flavored gum. The wintergreen notes here are quite mild, but they are enough to turn a mint hater like me away from this beer. I wouldn't be surprised if people like this better than I do."
"D: Good but not great for me. Certainly worth a revisit on my annual tour of Winter beers."
"Cheers!"
"Definitely one of the better winter beers I've had and certainly deserving of a higher rating."
"Poured this dark redish golden brown beer into a pint glass. Its head which starts off as a good amount reduces into little amounts of wisps of lacing. The aroma of toffee and herbal hops greet the nose. While the caramel and toffee sweetness of the beer a lights upon the tongue. A good citrus of orange and fruit greets the palate. Yet not very aggressive as a winter warmer typically goes."
"Hits the tongue with the caramel-toffee sweetness of the toasted malt up front, which lends a pleasant chocolate/coffee undertone, Some astringent citrus - dried apricot, tangerine - along with the herbal hops. A bready, walnut yeast underwrites the whole thing, but it's lacking in bite and aggressiveness. Mouthfeel is not as substantial as it should be, though well carbonated. A drinkable, sessionable ale that could have been so much more."
"The aroma is malty with a hint of chocolate and caramel. The taste is similar along those lines. It has a malt dominated taste with a small spice following. It reminds me of drinking a Samuel Smith Winter Welcome where is not quite aggressive as American winter warmers. In the mouth it is nicely carbonated and fairly thin but leaves you with a chewy aftertaste. Overall not a bad offering and I will buy it again."
"D: As the label claims, this brew acts as a good warmer for those chilly winter months."
"D: easy to drink? yea, it is. I felt this one lacked overall for a winter warmer. Not a bad showing but...tame. Never again"
"Drinkability/Final thoughts - One could drink about 3-5 of this brew. Anymore than that and it would become far to rich! However, this is a really warming and enjoyable beer. When consumed upon a chilly evening, this brew is at its best. If you like rich full bodied brews, or a fan of Winter Warmers. Then don't pass this one up in the winter months. I recommend you give it a try. Cheers!"
"D: Fairly drinkable enough, but not real special. May tire of the sweetness."
"This attractive warmer pours a rich mahogany when held to a light. The light brown cap is thick and foamy,it leaves tons of sticky lace as it recedes. The nose is mostly sweet and very much reminds me of some burnt cinnamon toast. This is just the way I like my Winter Warmers full bodied and even more full of flavor,this one delivers. Nice amount of hops,with a small amount of spice shining through. Toasted honey oat breads with hints of cinnamon and pine like flavors on the tail. A touch of alcohol warmth,no complaints here,this is just how I like it."
"I poured this out of a 22-ounce bottle. It's a great-looking, dark winter beer. Snow Cap would make a great beer to cook with or to enjoy with a nice hearty meal. Really a fantastic seasonal beer, really smooth."
"D- A very average at best beer with little to define its true characteristics."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer. Not overly sweet or heavy and at a good ABV at 7%. Could be balanced a bit better for my tastes, but I would drink this one again."
"Nothing amazing, but a nice winter warmer to throw into the mix. Alcohol isn't powerful, making this one pleasant for regular drinking. Not a bad brew, and definitely worth a shot, if nothing else then for a bit of variety in the sea of winter warmers."
"This strong ale comes up short in a couple of the more important cagegories. Real dark pour with a pillowy head and great lacing. Aroma is very mild, too mild and indicates a strong malt content along with the higher abv. A little flat on the palate but a good finish makes up for it. Good taste, flavor is enjoyable but I was hoping for more spices and a stronger malt taste. Bitter and bordering on one dimensional. Again it's sturdy and makes for a nice winter brew but it lacks important qualities to be great."
"OVerall, worth missing, to be honest."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Dark brown with ruby red highlights. No foam or lacing to speak of. Spicy on the nose, slightly sweet smelling with lots of sugary malts. Taste is much the same. A little sour on top of the spiciness, some hints of apple cider, which could be due to the age, some dry chocolate, definitely sweet and a little hop bitterness in the finish. Nice mouthfeel, slightly carbonated, alcohol is definitely present, and a good beer if it were 3 months ago."
"Drinkability- It is a pretty good beer that I think you could enjoy with friends that aren't all about beer."
"While reviewing Thunderhead IPA earlier today, I realized to my surprise I have not yet reviewed this beer, and since the horrific heat wave that has plagued the East Coast is supposedly going to break tomorrow, I figured I'd pop one of the bottles I got on clearance two weeks ago, especially since I've enjoyed this beer in warm weather numerous times recently. The beer poured a nice dark brown that showed ruby hues when held to light. There was a decent off-white head that lated and left spotty lacing. Aroma was pine hops, burnt caramel and a hint of cinnamon. The taste is a nice blend of spice, burnt caramel malts and a decent amount of bitter pine hops. The beer is on the light side of medium and crisp with decent carbonation. While this beer is certainly best enjoyed on a cold winter night, it seems to hold up through the summer better than most other winter beers."
"I am usually a big fan of winter ales, but this one just didn't do it for me. It pours a clear brown with a middling beige head. The nose has light grains and some spice. The taste is mild and the spices seem to fight the nutty malts. A light body could use a bit more depth."
"The taste is strong, sweetish malt with caramel that tatse burnt to the point of being lightly bitter, a light earthiness, and faintly sour. A light cracker quality starts to take over before a dry, somewhat burnt bitter finish with an aftertatse of crackers and light hops."
"Mouthfeel- Medium body with a little stickyness. Good drinkability."
"Appearance is a dark rich amber with a thin head. Smell of light dark sweet roasted malts. taste is roasty sweet with dark sugar, spice, dark fruits and slight alchohol. Mouthfeel is a solid medium with good carbonation. What I would overall expect from a winter warmer, a good solid winter ale."
"The drinkability is just great this is a very nice brew. I'll be looking for it again. Prosit, MK"
"Overall a pretty drinkable brew. Definite old ale traits with the musty woodiness. Worth a try."
"Pretty solid winter warmer, I will look for this one again next winter."
"This was a decent enough Winter Warmer with a thick body, pleasant warming characteristics, and was still fairly quaffable for a 7% beer. Unfortunately, nothing really sets it apart from much better winter beers out there."
"A drinkable offering from Pyramid but I am confused as to where it is actually produced as the label says Portland and Berkley but this listing is under Seattle. At 7% this is manageable at one or two at a sitting. This is slightly above average."
"An ok winter beer to have on hand, popular and not overpowering in any way."
"This is a less hoppy beer and it isnt bad. It isnt as smooth as some other winter warmers i have had in the past. This might be nice to have just during the winter for something different."
"Nice and light, mild maltyness... Detect spices but not as strong as one would think as they call out on the label. Pours like a flat beer, but has enough carbination to satisfy. Nice color, nice alcohol percentage, overall just nice and not notable."
"Poured this beer into a pint glass, It poured a darm amber, almost Cola color, with little to no head what so ever. The smell was alcohol and malt. The taste on this was very bland, with a malty taste. Not quite what was expected from this style. Needs spice in my opinion.The mouthfeel was very watery, with a little bit of a warming sensation from the alcohol. Overall, this is not the best beer by Pyramid. I expected more and came up dissappointed. I would hope they change their receipe up year to year. Becuase this one just didn't cut it."
"Rich taste. Malty, more alcohol. Toffee and a mild roasted flavor. Rather drying in the finish, sweetness is restrained and doesn't approach cloying. Body is medium and smooth, and dryness and light bitter in the end are enjoyable. I tend to sip this one, but like to have 2 or 3 in an evening. Good beer, a must-get for me each year."
"D: Pretty good, a litle strong, but I could have 2 or 3."
"Drinkability low, this is a mediocre winter warmer with the requisite spices and malt but little else in the way of uniqueness or innovation, would not get again"
"D-A slow drinker, but not overfilling nor overwhelming. Not an obvious session beer, but each beer is better than the one before. I'll enjoy a few hours of smooth sippin'!!"
"Pours a dark cherry brown with a thick head of off white bubbles. Starts with a big spicy and over ripe plum aroma. As it warms, it seems to turn more to a light gingersnap cookie and malt aroma. Taste is initially malt and plum but quickly the spice takes over. The aftertaste sensation is similar to the drying you get from cinnamon. Not over the top in spices. Solid winter brew."
"Pours a ruby/brown in color. There was a nice off white head sitting atop. Smell is spruce tree and clove. Taste is much the same with more malt there as well. Mouthfeel is medium, and highly sessionable. Decent, tastes like most other holiday beers."
"Nothing great, but not too shabby. The nose was its best attribute, but it isn't backed up in the flavor."
"Now... It tastes like it's in the 250+ calorie range so I guess... I'd have to add another 10 minutes to my lunch-time workout, then, wouldn't I? Oh! The trauma!"
"I didn't find the flavor to be the most complex for the style. Not a lot of flavors stood out, but it was still tasty and well-balanced. It was a clear ruby red with a tan head. The aroma was of mixed spice and a hint of hops. Those hops came out in the flavor more than you'd expect, making his a relatively hoppy winter warmer. I enjoyed that aspect and felt it complimented the mild caramel malt and spices."
"Pyrmaid hails this as a ""full bodied winter warmer"" and I in turn raise a tasty pint and hollar ""here here!""."
"D-A solid winter offering. This has always been one of my anticipated favorites of the holiday season. While I always feel that Pyramid's other offerings are ""good"" at best Snowcap always exceeds nicely."
"A true stand-out in a sea of typical winter warmers."
"Ive had several old ale styles this winter, and this one was my favorite. The flavor is definitely complex. It feels like spices were used, but not overdone. There is definitely a good amount of warming going on. Finally as an old ale style, it didnt seem as watered down as some of the other old ale styles I tried."
"Body a bit light for the style with average drinkability. At 7% this is a good deal for the price but I sure wouldn't want a whole 6er."
"D-This is quite a nice beer, not an over the top WW in an area, but I guess that makes it quite drinkable. Would be a welcome sight in anyones holiday beverage selection."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light bodied. Carbation is good. It's fairly drinkable. I'd drink more if I liked it a little better. Overall, it's decent. Certainly not my favorite holiday brew, but not bad."
"Thanks to biegaman for this sourvenir of his San Francisco jaunt in late October. Poured a deep mahogany brown with a half-finger tan head that settled quickly. Very little lacing and the carbonation - revealed only under a very bright light - was minimal, slow and lazy. The nose was spicy - nutmeg perhaps, cinammon, thyme. The taste was oaky, warm, malt with balanced bitterness and a pleasant lingering spicy finish. Buttery mouthfeel. Overall, not a bad winter warmer, thanks, Jan."
"Aftertaste is a bit hoppy and sharp with a little sweetness. Not a bad beer but I was expecting a bit more from this winter warmer. Drinkable and the alcohol is present in the taste but I'm not feeling it yet. Maybe a couple more will bed me down."
"This is another winter beer from the northwest, seattle to be exact, I did visit this brewery this year, right across the street from the seattle mariners stadium in seattle, this beer however i bought in a six pack here in mcminnville oregon, good winter beer not my favorite but very drinkable, a little darker than some of the others from this area, but not so bitter."
"All in all, a decent warmer, nice with a cookie to offset the harsh aftertaste. Worth a shot."
"I've had this many times over the years and I'm just finally getting around to reviewing it. Back in the day, this was one of the better winter options. Now its been eclispsed by so many other choices. Pours a very dar brown, almost black. Thin head and some lacing. Smells fruity and there are notes of sweet malt and some spicy, citrusy hops. The taste is similar, with an edge to it and some almost burnt toffee flavors as well. Mouthfeel is spicy and a little rough. One of their best offerings, and not bad."
"Tastes of toasted malts with a light touch of chocolate spices. At the very end, your palette will pick up the citus from the hops. This is quite different from the other winter warmers I've tried so far and worth a try."
"Well recommended if you like easy drinking beers of this style."
"Appearance is a dark ruby-brown color, head retention medium. Smells of wood aromas, malts, slightly caramel-toffe hints. tastes sweet, slight coffee flavors coming through very malty character. bitter notes on the end, very spicy and warm on the finish. spicy in your throat. mouthfeel is medium bodied, the spiciness of the beer makes it nice to sip slowly. I wasn't blown away, but not horrible."
"There are much better winter warmers available."
"This beer needs to balance out the alcohol a little bit better. Not bad though."
"I like it, but it's nothing special. That is, I wouldn't anticipate its arrival every year, but will have it at a bar if I saw it."
"Pours a dark ruby colour with a thin head that leaves a clean glass with no hint of lace. Not much in the way of a nose but very tasty all the same. Strong malt flavours and a good hoppy finish. Mouthfeel could be a bit more substantial. Definitely not an all-night beer but a nice one to round off a session with."
"D- Not the best winter brew out there a little too bitter at the end ruins the whole beer for me"
"Pours a clean deep amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, nutmeg and cinnamon. In the taste, roasty malt and a light cinnamon spice. A smooth, malty mouthfeel and a dry cinnamon, and a green apple aftertaste. Very porter like, with hints of spice and fruitiness. Light and easy to drink."
"Drinks very easy for the abv, this year's offering is better than last's. If you like winter warmers with some hop zip, give this one a go"
"Pours a muddyish ruby brown with a somewhat lasting beige head. Smell is charred malt, and tartness. Taste is similar with charred flavors, tart semi-toasty malt, and a strong alcohol presence. Overall, just too thin, and alcoholic. Needs more body to support the alchol presence to be enjoyable, but that is the style I guess. Drinkable, but not particularly good."
"A little bit sweet, a little spicy, almost no alcohol taste. Pretty easy drinking, and for $2 for a bomber....bonus. Not my favorite winter brew, but super way to start my night, I'm glad I gave this brew another chance and had one this year."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and moderately dry. The finish is clean with a bit of warmth and moderate carbonation. Tasty but nothing too impressive."
"D - Not a bad winter warmer, but certainly not the best. It wasn't spicy enough."
"Pours a deep ruby color, thin cola color head settles very quickly. Aroma is faint of cinnamon and sweet malty goodness. Taste is somewhat sweet, some oakey flavor. Mouthfeel is fairly thin, somewhat fizzy finish. Drinkability is quite good, ABV not terribly noticeable. It's relatively inexpensive, @ only 1.99 for this 22oz bottle."
"D - A little strong for a session beer, but very nice!"
"At 7.00 %, this doesn't taste like it. Flavor balanced, and intersting enough to make this more drinkable thatn 7 %."
"Overall its pretty good I guess, it has no clear problems but I do feel a bit underwelmed."
"I've had this beer a number of times, from the bottle, draught, and kegs at house parties...and have always thought it was a tasty, full bodied winter warmer that was still remarkably easy drinking."
"Sorry, but I'm going against the grain on this one: don't get this if you can avoid it."
"The body was lighter then I expected but it was fairly creamy and the carbonation fit. Overall drinkable if not very complex or exciting. Certainly the least disappointing experience with this brewery in my backyard."
"I would not buy a six pack, but if you can buy a single, do it, try it, and judge for yourself."
"Could not drink more than a bottle of this"
"D: Great for a winter warmer, each sip keeps you wanting more. My favourite brew by far from Pyramid, a great example of a Winter Warmer, one of the best out there."
"D: Pretty good brew, one of the better beers I've had from Pyramid."
"D- not sure what makes this a winter special, too sweet to be enjoyable, much better winter brews out there"
"Beer poured a mahogany brown color with a off white head that has a very thin layer barely floating. Nose is very malty but i am not picking up on any seasonal spices. Taste is not overly complex, very malty with a hint of spice, dark fruit, and molasses, Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty smooth. Overall drinkabilty is pretty good. This is a nice seasonal that is worth a shot."
"Drank straight from the bottle. Aroma was a nice sweetness, with definate fruit undertones. The prevelant aroma was of bananas. Taste was very similar to the smell, banana, but mostly a carmelized brown sugar flavoring. There were hints of spice, but it was mostly sweet. Not sickly or overpowering sweet, but a nice flavor. Very nice in the mouth, slight tingle to the tounge. No excess carbonation in the sipping, very easy to drink. A nice surprise beer."
"Overall a nice Winter Warmer."
"Really tasty. Everything is well put together and well balanced. Some nice subtle touches here and there. It's most of what I like in a beer. I could put down a couple of these."
"Mouthfeel was zesty yet somewhat slick. Medium to full in body."
"D- Surprisingly drinkable. The dry finish leaves you wanting more, while the balance of flavors makes this one a good choice for seconds."
"My first beer from Pyramid, and hey - I'm impressed. Although this is hardly a sipper, i could nurse a few of these on a blustery winter's night."
"This brew is a dark, ruby color with a dark fruit aroma and a thin tan head. The color is so dark that, at times, it seems nearly black. The smell is a complex mix of malt and fruit. Cherry is a particular stand out. All of which is backed by slightly muted a spicy aroma. No presence of alcohol in the smell, but after half a glass, the beer is certainly warming. The taste is dominated by a maltiness and considerable residual sweetness. Theres a lot of flavor in the mouth, which corresponds nicely to the full-bodied brew. Its not over-the-top, but is very well done. I enjoyed the spiciness and the fruit in the forefront. Not much of a wow factor with this beer, just solid drinkability."
"A delicious winter warmer that captures the holiday spirit in a glass. Snow Cap pours into a glass topped with a semi-dense tan head nestled atop an amber-brown body. The nose is complimented with spices (perhaps a mix of spices: vanilla, cinnamon). The mouthfeel warms as it goes down providing a drinkable beer for those long winter months."
"Dark chestnut with a slight ruby tinge and a small, fizzy, tan head that quickly and fully diminishes. Very little few spots of lacing. Smells kind of musty and stale even though its not old and I doubt the six-pack shop associated with Zenos in State College, PA mishandled it. No, I think it just has a kind of funky smell. Not the whole bouquet, just a little, just enough to knock things out of whack, otherwise its a decent roasted malt aroma. Toffee, nuts, some light spicy hops, some very light doughy yeast and a small zing of currant. The taste follows suit. There are some good characteristics to this beer but something is just off. Off taste and off balance. Even the mouthfeel is a bit off, being too slick and syrupy for my taste. I didnt hate this beer, but I just didnt enjoy this either."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: I was prepared to be underwhelmed but this is a decent Winter Warmer; not in the top drawer, I'm afraid"
"This is not a bad winter brew, but it is too spicy for my tastes. if you are after that, do give this a try."
"Glad I grabbed a 6 of these. Too bad I can't bring any home to NH in my carry on due to the non drinking crowd from you know where."
"Part of a mixed case of winter beers I got over the Christmas holiday. This beer poured a deep brown color with a medium thickness tan head. The nose was a bit strong with a malty sweet touch and some spice notes. The taste also had an abv presence which made for a nice warming quality in the mouth. The malty sweet body also made for a very smooth and full body."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep mahogany with head that has a creamy off-white color that leaves dottings of lacing. Smell is sweet, slightly of alcohol and turpentine; heavy on the spice. Taste is sweet, spices and banana with a slightly bitter, alcoholic, dry finish. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with creamy carbonation. This beer is only moderatly drinkable due to the heavy spice taste."
"My second pyramid beer. This one pours a deep mahogany amberish color. A very agressive pour produce a slight, momentary head, but the lacing is nice. Smells good, like a winter warmer should. Sweet. Sugary caramel, but not too complex. Taste is again not tough too decipher. Malty backbone, no hops to speak of and a nice sugary sweet warmth from the 7% abv. Fill the mouth nicely. I would surmise that there are much better winter warmers out there, but this is not bad. I wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"thanks to my brother for getting me a single for x-mas."
"Poured out a dark dark brown, looks like coke a cola, with a tiny little non existent spattering of a (I hate to call it) head. The nose offers some woodnyess, malt, alcohol, and sherry. The taste is rather tame, rounded out malt and biscuit notes, with a bit of alcohol, and a slightly spicy/woody/astringent border on the palate. The mouthfell is slick and mildly carbonated. Fairly drinkable beer, good for a winter warmer near the fireplace."
"Adam"
"D slightly above average drinkabilty, good for a winter warmer"
"D - It could be worse. I don't think I will have it again, since I don't care for a winter warmer that is full of a grassy lager flavor."
"D - The only thing I really noticed missing was any wintery spice. I guess I've grown accustomed to some spices in my winter brews. But beside that, an enjoyable selection."
"2006 Edition- Pours a deep mohogany color with a small head. Smell is full of cinnamon and other spices, very nice. Taste is well rounded with plenty of hops to balance it out. Alcohol is pronounced well as it warms up a bit. Mouthfeel is rather thin and average. Overall this is a great winter warmer and one that I will return to again each winter."
"Overall- Another decent Winter Warmer this past season. This was just a notch below the Anchor X-mas!"
"Mouthfeel is thin at first but tacky and dry at the finish. As long as you keep drinking, it's bearable. Drinkability is okay for this alcohol content, and the nice smell lures you back, for what it's worth."
"Pretty good, but not for sessions. Would probably pair very well with heavier meats and cheeses. A bit malty for my preference, but I wouldn't hesitate to have another."
"Notes: A well crafted winter warmer and really fits the style to a T in my opinion. To me this is could be a standard bearer to judge others against."
"Overall, a bit darker and biitterer than I expect from my winter warmers but it's still a decent beer with original flavor and a solid kick.."
"D - Very drinkable, just nothing spectacular. I wouldnt order it again. Maybe if I was closer to the brewery I would have it again, but since im in ny i cant imagine it was all that fresh either."
"A great Winter Warmer. Good job Pyramid."
"D - not an awful beer at all, but, still, it seems like it needs something more, perhaps citrus hops, or more complexity from the malts. right now, i feel like im drinking a highly carbonated salad dressing rather than the beer i so desired. still, though, i will finish the glass without a problem as this beer does not merit a trip down the drain. though, i will confess, i feel like i'm about to break a sweat."
"It's just one of those beer where you kind of shrug and finish it. Nothing stellar but it's something else to try so I'll mark this one down as a ""why not"" beer."
"Overall a very flavorful but severely unbalanced ale. I'd swear this baby tastes like 10% abv (or more) with it's alcohol flavor and warmth. The hops are very nice, I just wish they had something else to bounce-off of besides the strong alcohol flavor."
"Pours dark brown with reddish highlights, patchy head with some lacing. Smell is malts, coffee and some fruit. Roasted flavors dominate with some sweetness. Medium bodied. Overall, not very impressive, I expected a lot more complexity. I wouldn't buy this again."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a nice dark brown, almost black. No head or lacing. The aroma is hard to detect, but what is there, is mostly from the spices. The flavor is very interesting. Not exactly the flavor you would expect from such a dark beer. Just like a pale ale, but with holiday spices like cinnamon and nutmeg added. A very interesting combination, and a tasty one at that. This will definitely be added to my list of beers to get, during the holiday season. Although I could only drink one or two at a time, this makes for a great beer to enjoy on a cold dark evening."
"Slainte!"
"I was expecting something a little better. This one just seemed bitter with no balance. I probably won't be revisiting this one."
"One of my favorite holiday beers,delicious.mouthwatering,don't want to stop drinking this beer.Give it a try."
"Poured of with a large head that produced lacing, tan in color and dissipated slowly. Color of dark ruby. Aroma of spice, dates, figs, and sherry. Flavors of woody, toasty, toffee, caramel, and a slight hint of butterscotch. Finishing with a brown sugar sweetness. Mouthfeel lends to a moderate carbonation, with a heavy/medium body. Overall a very drinkable winter beer. It is well balanced, and has a nice flavor. The best Snow Cap from Pyramid that I have had so far."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a minimal 1/4"" tan head over the clear burgundy brew. Head is down to a skim of swirly bubbles in a flash, with average lacing. Aroma is deeply of grains, with a light fruity note. Flavor is malty upfront, with the fruitiness in the middle, and reverts back to the grains for the close and aftertaste. Mouthfeel and drinkability is okay, but again this year this one doesn't wow me. It does seem better fresher, as expected, which is a good thing to note."
"Single bottle from Whole Foods Raleigh"
"Not bad. None of Snow Caps characteristics stood out in crazy-good sort of way. It was, however, very well balanced and a wonderful drink. The malt and hops complement each other nicely. I think it makes a good contribution to the world of Winter Warmers."
"All in all, an above average and drinkable winter brew. But it just lacks a bit of a kick that I would hope for from a warmer. I am usually not a fan of most Pyramid brews, but this one is pretty good."
"Wow, what a stinker. I don't know what they were thinking with this one, but it's a complete mess. I had to dump it in the yard as even my drain didn't want to drink it.."
"D: Not bad. This is a ""standard"" winter brew with decent characteristics. Not in the elite but still enjoyable."
"Although not evident in my review, when you put it all together the damn thing tastes kind of like a porter. There is aI'l bet this is going to age well."
"single bottle bought at a Woodmans in wisconsin. this bottle was on sale big time and i suspect it had lived beyond its intended years. poured deep red with a nice small head. surprized at the lack of carbonation actually. malty, slightly spicey clove and cinnamon odor. tasty, roasted malt and red fruit flavor. full. metallic (slightly). burnt roastiness lingers. nice to drink on a cold evening for sure."
"Pours with a three finger light brown head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Mahogeny color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Malty nose. Starts sweet and sour maybe apples, smooth, finish has hints of hops. Best by is Feb 2006 but it tastes just fine. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from Hi-Time Cellars Costa Mesa, Ca."
"this is a great beer rich, malty, and packs a kick."
"In late Nov this beer really warms the stomach and makes any football game more enjoyable."
"Bottle poured a dark brown with traces of ruby and a thin, tan head. .Aroma was not very stong, but malty with hints of chocolate and dark fruit.These carried over to create a good flavor and the 7% alcohol was evident but not overwhelming. This was better than I expected, and I had it in May. Could appreciate even more in winter."
"As this being my first pyramid, I was quite suprised. Take note that this beer has been aging for over 7 months now. Yet, somehow it tastes nearly identical to a Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale. This is a very solid brew."
"not bad, but the flavors are a little muddled. the aftertaste is a little blah as well"
"Pours an almost purple color with an off-white head. Spotty lacing. Lot of malt in the nose with some hints of spice and a background of alcohol. Flavor is a big presence of malt and dried fruit, followed by hop bitterness, but not much hop flavor to talk about. Bitterness lingers along with the malt sweetness while a mild spicing makes itself known. Kind of makes me think of a barleywine jr. with spice added. Mouthfeel is moderate, but the carbonation could have been a little smoother for my taste. Tasty beer, but I somehow don't feel very motivated to drink more than this one bottle."
"Draught: This one pours a very dark brown, and is topped with a small tan head. It leaves lots of lacing down the glass. The aroma is somewhat spicy and malty. Perhaps a touch of cinnamon in there. The body is a little on the richer side, with a caramel malt sweetness balanced nicely with some hop spiciness. Maybe just a hint of roastiness. I dont know if you would want to call a 7% beer a session beer, but this goes down really easy. Now I know why my friends in the northwest put this stuff away for later!"
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce short glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"D - Drinkable. This is the best brew from Pyramid in my book. Very tasty and at only 7% ABV you can have a few."
"Mouthfeel- Almsot wanna say oily, but just a little...I guess. Pretty ocunbtry kitchen as far as palate goes. But does have good coverage of the tongue."
"cheers..."
"Drinkability: The taste seemed much different than the aroma, so I didn't like it at first, but after sipping on this one it turned out to be a decent beer. Not as good as the Goose Island Christmas Ale that I had 2 weeks ago, but still a good brew."
"All and all a good beer but it almost pushed from a winter warmer to an IPA. Still very drinkable from either standpoint."
"This is a beer that drinks like a meal. Very filling. It's drinkable, but after just one I was ready for a nap !"
"Coffee-like color, a clear brown with red hues. The faintest of a head disappears fast. The smell is cinnamon-like and sweet, but very, very faint. The malt flavor is sweet and toasty, with a peppery/spicy cinnamon taste. The finish seems to be moderately bitter, giving it some nice balance. Thickness is medium, and the carbonation is nice. This beer was dark enough and bitter enough for my liking, but could have yielded a better appearance and aroma. A pleasant winter warmer overall..."
"The carbonation seems high and deters from the taste. I would have liked more of a creamy taste but still and enjoyable beer. The ABV isnt a deterrent and makes for an easy drinking winter warmer."
"Deep mahongany brown. Slightly hazy. The nose is slightly fruity. Ditto on the palate, where a citrus peel fruit element is combined with some maltiness. The carbonation is spritzy, the mouthfeel average. So this is a holiday beer? Well at least it's 7% ABV..."
"Very filling and with a high ABV, this beer is good for no more than two bottles."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a fluffy half inch head. The aroma is sweet and malty with just a hint of hops. Taste is malty, with hints of chocolate, caramel and cocoa. This brew, however, feels kind of thin to me. It's not nearly as thick and full bodied as I remember it being. I wonder if Pyramid has changed the recipe for this beer? The last time I had it in the late 90's, it had way more hop character too. It's still a decent brew, just not one that I'm going to go out of my way to acquire."
"Pours an opaque brown color with a medium thin off-white head that disappears steadily. Not a lot of lacing after the first layer. Aroma of sweet malt and spices. The flavor is nutty and malty, with some nutmeg and other sweet spices. The finish is sweet and nutty, with a lightly bitter aftertaste. I haven't had one of these for a couple years, and still think it is above average."
"Pours a clear and dark ruby/mahogany. Two finger head, dense and tan colored, and holds well leaving a few sticky patches of lace. Roasted barley and caramel nose, with a faint dextrin scent and lots of holiday spice aromas like ginger, cloves, and cinnamon. Big roasted flavor, accompanied by a crystal malt sweetness. Ginger flavor arrives in the aftertaste , which is dryed out by noble-esque hops that will become slightly chalky. The mouthfeel is otherwise smooth with a medium body and low carbonation. A good balance, but the cloying flavor of stale hops gets annoying near the finish. But, this is a fine seasonal, and has so many pleasent characteristics; you don't really notice the imperfections unless you're looking."
"Mouthfeel, equally as interesting. Alcoholic, creamy, bubblely then down the hatch, it's warming. Perhaps thats why it's known as a winter warmer....cheers"
"coffee-brown body with ruby underglow. Head was virtually unpresent and turned to a very thin film. The aroma full of roasted malt and spices. The spices turned strong in the taste and mouthfeel. A cloying amount of cinnamon and ginger make this a little undrinkable. The bad bittering hops do not compliment the selection of malt and spices at all. Not a good beer taste-wise."
"A dark red close to brown. Covered with a snow cap of head that yeilds nice lacing. Smell is nutty with a little ginger in the maltyness. A decent flavor of slight roasted malts with a hint of spice in the background. A good solid body helps this beer out. Not something I would mind having again."
"The biggest drawback for me with the Pyramid Snow Cap was that I had just tried for the first time the very tasty Sierra Nevada Bigfoot. Pyramid has yet to impress me, from their Apricot Ale to the Hefe's, so i wasn't expecting much and was pretty much right. Avergae mouthfeel, not as tasty as Sam Adam's winter warmer even. Only paid $2.75 for this bottle at apub, so that was okay, but there are much better winter warmers out there."
"I'd say this is better than most winter warmers I've had, but not as good as a few others. Above average."
"Topped with a short noisy head of small and medium eggshell colored bubbles that quickly disappear leaving a thin collar. The beer is a rubied amber, with mahogany highlights, slightly hazed. The smell is sweet and malty, with hints of gingerbread and holiday cookie spice. The taste is initially malty with those same cookie spice notes, but it finishes distinctly hoppy in a passive-aggressive way but also in a non-complimentary way. The hops do not compliment the rest of the beer, and overall it does not mesh well. It has a medium body that feels a bit thin on the tongue, there is fine, soft carbonation. It smells much better than it tastes, unfortunately. The drinkability is only ok, and I guess I could get used to the weird hop finish. I remember earlier versions of this beer tasting simply wonderful. Perhaps next years release will be modified."
"This is a drinkable winter ale, and at a fairly low price point. I got a six pack for $6.50. As dark ales go Id say it is average at best, I think there are other comparable warmers that are better. I wouldnt pour Snow Cap down the sink, but I wouldnt go out of my way to have it again. If you like a really bitter dark brew, this ones for you."
"This beer pours a non-hazed dark-brown with a very small head. The aroma consists of slight roasty notes with hints of light roasty malt. The taste is more of the roasted malts and spices with hops in the distant background. The dry powdery spices are very pronounced. This is a light to medium bodied beer that finishes slightly sweet. Not a bad beer, but complexity is not its strong suit. Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a meduim plus body. The carbonation is proper. This is not a bad drinking beer experience by any measure. I look forward to next years batch."
"A good winter warmer that reminds me of a mini-Arogant Bastard. Though it has the alcohol, the malts and hops are not as bold or as melded. The beer has good spices and herbs to accent the hops. It carries a dark malt, cherry, and nutty flavor. Alcoholic from sniff to finish. Hopped well for a dry finish while remaining malty. Good stuff, I'll have another."
"Mouthfeel is toasty sweet...again with that bitter chocolate feel and nuts lingering along the palate."
"Dark brownish orange with a tawny head that dissipates and provides low lacing. Smells of malty malt, very slight citrus, brown sugars. Taste is of mostly malt, you feel the sweet grain sticking onto the tongue, the hops are too light to completely wash the mouth free of the sweetness. It doesn't taste like it's that strong, but it feels like it. I enjoy it, and will be getting more next winter."
"Poured a dark amber with a frothy head.Aroma is sweet and malty. One of the few Winter Warmers that actually had an ABV high enough to provide an actually warming affect, but not too much that it overpowered. Flavour is mostly malts with only a slight hop spice and bitterness. Mouthfeel was very smooth. Very drinkable, but the alcohol makes it more of a sipping beer or evening ender."
"Over all an above average X-mas beer for me, but there's a few better."
"Thumbs down on this one."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Benji drank it all, and begged for more. Peaches didn't get any and left sad and sober."
"An OK Winter brew, I've had it on-tap a few times in the past and liked it at about the same I'm liking it out of the bottle."
"Very pleasant beer in the drinkability department. Tasty without killing you with sweetness this is a winter beer that is better suited to adults taste buds. Assertive bitter finish is a nice surprise, and I do believe that this is the highest score I have ever given to a beer from this brewery."
"~Pleasantly surprised with my first try of Pyramid brews. Pump up the malts a little more and they'd have themselves a fantastic winter brew."
"Drinkability: it has great character and is a great drink to have during the winter months. probably wouldn't have it in the summer, however, i would get it again in the future."
"Drinkability: This one is pretty drinkable - there is nothing about this beer that would discourage me from picking it up again. It is not perfect, but it is plenty good."
"I never realized that winter warmer was an actual style. I once considered a heavily alcoholic, robust, fire side sipper a winter warmer. I guess I was sorely mistaken. Snow Cap was quite an interesting experience with strong dark qualities and festive fruitiness. I am somewhat perplexed and intrigued by it. Hmmm."
"Pours a crystal brown with a stunning red glow and a frothy tan head. Smells of fruity hops and sweet malt. Not too much there. I got light headed huffing this stuff trying to extract the aroma. Whats there is nice, but theres just not much of it there. Flavor consisted of pungent dry hops with a light chocolate malt, a few slight spices and a huge dry finish. Mouth feel as a little on the light side with mild carbonation."
"Drinkability - What's with all this metal I'm drinking tonight? What's the TSA going to do to me at the airport - I shudder to think...are they just cranking out their seasonal brews to get them on the shelves? Truth be told, the metallica of this brew is not as overwhleming as in the Sam Adams Winter Lager I tasted three seasonals ago...not bad."
"I've been enjoying these all year but now it is September. The last one I had was probably July and it was enjoyable. Tonight I opened the last one in the fridge and it was undrinkable for me. So just as a point of reference, 6 months maximum for cellaring IMHO."
"Snow Cap has a dark, nutty brown color with a small and creamy light brown head. The aroma has a sweet malt smell, toasted, with a bit of spiciness. Touches of dry, hoppy smells are noted in the background. A sip starts with sweet malt flavors, caramel and molasses stand out among a standard sweet malt body. A piney hop taste is also in the mix, but plays second fiddle to the malts. Towards the finish a vague dark fruit flavor pops out alongside a vague alcohol taste. The finish concludes with a caramel sweetness. Overall, Snow Cap has a nice mix of flavors, but the overall experience is a little thin-flavored, especially in the middle of a sip. If Pyramid pumped up the malt flavor a bit this could be an excellent winter beer."
"Medium bodied, although well balanced, the flavors are a little rough and the alcohol is too apparent, but is is drinkable and warming."
"Slàinte! (but wear a jacket, it's cold out there!)"
"This beer's mouthfeel is about its only strong suit."
"I can't really even describe the taste of this beer, other than it was an evolution of flavors. It started creamy and fruity, and less bitter than a porter but became more bitter yet refreshing and warming as the taste lingered. It was refreshing, fruity, roasty and in general, completely different than any beer I've had, especially a winter. Yet another reason I love beer; predispositions to breweries or styles can be crushed just like that. Check this one out."
"Pours a dark brown with a thin tan head that recedes quickly. Aroma is pretty simple, some piney hops, dark and roasted malt and some alcohol. The flavor has some roasted malt notes, toasted bread, spices, a bit of hops and some alcohol, boring. Mouthfeel is thin and drinkability is not very good. Never been impressed with any pyramid brew and this doesnt change that."
"-Cheers!"
"Drinks pretty handily. I'd recommend trying it with cookies, as I am mine!"
"Overall impression: Decent winter warmer - not the most exciting one out there, but worth a try."
"Drinkability: Easy enough but pretty boring overall. Maybe a good winter beer for non-craft beer fans. Probably won't re-visit."
"Pours a deep brown color with garnet highlights and a one-finger tan head, creamy with large bubbles. Sweet aroma of roasted malt, with some chestnut and brown sugar notes. Palate is full of roasted dark malt, tempered by a nice hoppy bitterness. Notes of brown sugar, plum, and dry ale yeast are present. The finish is crisp and dry, which is a bit of a curveball, but pleasant. Medium, creamy body is just a tad thin for the style, though still substantial. An enjoyable seasonal ale, and one of the best offerings from a usually mediore brewery."
"D: Yes, this is a great seasonal, and it does have price/drinkability to rate it is a buy-again beer."
"I'll let you know ;-)"
"Dark marron colored body, almost black until held up to the light. Smell is very sweet and malty, with brown sugar and spices. Akin to a dopplebock in smell. Taste is also very sweet and big, yet smooth and slightly woody. I am having this beer almost a year after it was brewed, and it has retained a very satisfying flavor. Very roasty with a little coffee flavor, but also sweet and spiced. Would be a great midwinter night's sipper, but it is still good on an unseasonably warm October day."
"A decent middle-of-the-road winter warmer."
"A well crafted brew."
" A nice WARM and cold weather companion."
"Picked up a single at the beer store today. Never seen it before, but I'm sure its been there a while. A winter warmer in July. Hmmm, why not? Anyway, it pours a dark amber brown color with a decent head. When held to the light it reminds me of stained wood. The smell is terrific. Notes of coffee and bittersweet malts put a grin on my face. It tastes nice as well. I don't think the little bit of aging has hurt this one at all. The flavor is choppy and bitter at first, but finishes warm and smooth. I notice bitter chocolate and a bit of coffee and malts on the palate. The mouthfeel is somewhere between the infinite space that lies between medium and heavy bodied. The drinkablility is good for one or two, but enjoy them slowly. This one is  warm going down. Impressive beer here. Maybe not an elitist brew, but a good one nonetheless."
"Poured with a noticible lack of head, just some light wispiness, despite a vigorous pour. The nose was a really sweet malty character and the color was a deep red, bordering on brown, like mahogany. There were lots of big flavors, including chocolate, anise, and spice (maybe cinnamon?) on the tongue. It had a somewhat creamy mouthfeel. The chocolate and anise really stood out on the finish and aftertaste, with a mild hoppiness accompanying. This was a really good drink, even aged and at the height of summer."
"This is an ok thing to be drinking, but its nothing special. If its handy at the bar, and its decently priced, you could do a lot worse, but it isnt worth seeking out."
"A very dark amber, almost brown hued winter warmer. Pours with plenty of foam. Not much in the aroma. The first sip is full of caramel malt flavors (which I like) with a little tinge of roasted malt bitterness. The hops are played down a bit until towards the finish, as they should be in a winter warmer, IMO. I think I favor Young's Winter Warmer over this one, which seems to seems to be a little too full-bodied (just a touch.) Finishes with a fairly strong chalky bitterness. This ale is not quite as enjoyable as I remember it being, but still a decent beer for its style."
"Deep chestnut color with ruby gdges. Thin tan head, which remained intact for a good amount of time. Caramel and toffee notes along with spices in the nose. Malt heavy flavor, along with cinnamon, ginger, and a good amount of alcohol. Medium body, low carbonation. I thought this was a decent beer, but maybe over-spiced."
"Nice mouthfeel to this one. About the same as Celebration, but not as big as Anchor's Our Special Ale. An appropriate beer for sippin' on those winter nights."
"Sampled on tap, and served chilled, it pours a ruby brownish color with 1/2 finger of head which is tan in color, and some edge lacing on the glass. Appears to be medium-bodied. Aroma is mainly of plums and caramel tones, but very difficult to find other aromas to this one. Taking the first sip, I taste sweet plums and hops w/ a nice brown malt finish; some of the hops come through on the swallow as well. Feel is medium-bodied w/ lots of stingy carbonation on the tongue but a more smooth creamy finish. Not a bad brew, but could be better."
"This is my fourth Pyramid beer and I'm just about ready to give up on all the rest. Not one of them has been good and the reasons seem to vary from beer to beer. Simply put, Snow Cap isn't worth my time or your time or anyone else's time."
" Drinkability is good not a bad little seasonal warmer better then I thought it was going to be from friends opinions. Want to thank merlin48 for picking this one up for me."
"Blinding, see through amber hue. A hop-based nose, with some baked bread there as well. Rich and creamy texture up front, a blast of hops jumps at the palate! Near-syrup sweetness, combined with some malty offerings. Has a lingering warming affect; a bit acidic with some caramel and cotton candy tastings; smooth across the palate and a well-rounded mouthfeel, just doesnt stack up with other winter warmers."
"This beer pours a rubied brown color with no head over top, but a slight ring. The nose is deep sweet caramel, almost a cherry aroma with a dirty hop in there as well. The flavor is a little more hoppy than the nose would tell, but still rather lack-luster. The flavor is really not all that great. Some malty sweetness is there, but its just not all that great. The feel is rather thin, without much body at all. Overall, this is not really a great winter warmer. Just beer."
"Chestnut brown color with little or no head to speak of. Low aroma-somewhat malty with a whisper of spiciness. Big malt flavor upfront. Nice hop bitterness-the 2 are well balanced. Nice medium body. Could be a good session beer though Im sure the 7% abv would catch up on you. A very drinkable beer I look forward to each year."
"I nice beer but only one per session for me, please."
"The mouthfeel was smooth at the start and finished dry with some crispness. Medium / heavy in body. Very drinkable for a winter brew as alcohol levels are low and the flavor is mellow."
"The small head quickly dissapated and there wasn't too much lacing. The hue was a dark amber. For a 7% the flavor and aroma seem to be awfully heavy on the alcohol. The roasted malts and golding hops are there, but the alcohol is overwhelming. It woule be one thing if this was 11% etc, but it isn't. This one is mediocre at best. The weakest holiday offering I've had.;"
"Overall, not a bad brew, one of the more palateable winter warmers out there as some are very strong and rich. Except for the higher abv, this is a very drinkable winter warmer that I will have to look for in the future."
"Really a pretty good beer, but there are a number of other winter warmers I'd reach for first."
"Not a very good beer. I've never liked any of Pyramids stuff, and this one doesn't do anything to change that opinion. I'll stay away."
"2004 edition, pours a clear, deep mahogany body with a respectable beige head that hangs around, and leaves some patchy lace. Aroma is malty caramel with a note of chocolate, quickly displaced by herbal hops and vague spices. Mouthfeel is light medium bodied with moderated carbonation. Taste is dry and spicy with herbal hops, bitter yeast note, and nutmeg. Alcohol is hidden. Finishes dry and spicy/yeasty bitter. Some old ale character, unfortunately, was very fleeting in nature. Not an outstanding example of the style, but I've never been a fan of this brewery's offerings."
"Other comments: Pretty much along the lines of a typical NW barleywine (but on the low end of the abv scale). An OK winter warmer."
"Overall, a tasty holiday beer. It is well designed and well executed, if a bit unimaginative. As a good strong ale, I would enjoy a couple around a fire with friends, or with beef, or fruit and/or cheesecake. I don't know what the ABV is, but I suspect that this would cellar well for a year or so."
"A very tasty and warm winter beer. As it had a chance to open, the flavors developed very well and alcohol presented more fire."
"This one poured a nice redish color with an off white head that fades away quickly. The smell is of spices, some alcohol and some nice malts. The taste is sweet at first then moves to a caramelish flavor with spices and alcohol at the end. Very smooth and had medium carbonation. This warmed me up nicely on yet antoher crappy western Pennsylvania Monday night. I much enjoyed this one."
"Pretty good offering from Pyramid but this year there are other seasonals which deserve more attention."
"Still, this is a nice winter beer and one I will look forward to having again!"
"This one pours a dark brown color with a moderate head and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is very neat - some hops, but a nutty character with strong caramel. Very complex taste here. Caramel, nuts, slight spices. The alcohol is somewhat noticeable, but smooth. The mouthfeel is medium and the drinkability is good."
"I liked this beer but was a little put off by the finish. While this beer has alot to offer, I felt like the strong finish was just a bit too overwhelming. If the finish were more balanced, this beer would have earned higher marks."
"Nice tan head that lasts. The body is deep brown with red highlights. Not much on the nose. Seems like a lot of the winter warmers I have been drinking lately have been a little heavy on the hops. This one has a large malt body with just enough hops to keep rom becoming sweet."
"Drinkability- Very easy to consume many of these in a session. The 7% is just right. Although, I would love to see what happened if they increased it to about a 9%. Wonder how the flavors would change. Great beer IMO."
"Not bad when placed up against the other seasonals I've reviewed. Smooth enough to be enjoyed through an evening, strong enough to keep the toes warm on cold nights."
"Drinkability was low. I just taste burntness. I diddn't even finish my sampler glass. Sorry for the low rating, but i'm just not a fan."
" Tasty, inexpensive, and widely available, this is my winter fallback brew."
"A very solid winter seasonal from this brewer. The beer poured a deep clear bronze with a single finger of tan foam atop the body. The head faded a bit too quickly and there was little lace. The nose is very nice with a solid sense of caramel below the quiet hops. The flavor is quite nice with a sweetness that is barely balanced by the hops - good for a winter warmer. The body is full with good crispness. Overall a nice winter beer."
"Tastes of alcohol and burnt toast, malts... Decent amount of carbination in here. Foams up for you in your mouth when you give it a roll over the tongue. Nice tasting one."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Good beer, and just because it is a seasonal doesn't mean it is only good in that season."
"I must preface this by stating that i'm not a huge fan of this brewery but i decided to give this beer a shot. It poured a dark amber color with a small creme head, a decent looking beer. Aroma had a little bit of spice and something that i think smells like some sweet syrup. Taste is pretty bland. It has a little bit of malty sweetness that i don't care that much more and mouthfeel kind of thin. WIth an abv of 7% and not much in terms of flavor, i don't see how this beer would be very drinkable imo."
"Drinkability - This is an easy-drinking beer that is very tasty. It can be very drinkable, especially on cold winter nights. Not too shabby."
"Deep mahogany, thin lace. Rich aroma of caramel malts, chocolate, and apricots. Interesting and unexpected. Flavor is very reminiscnent of Sam Adams Old Fezziwig, with just a tad less complexity and spiciness. Alcohol is just barely noticeable. Malty and rich initially, finishes mildly hoppy and slightly tart. Sharp mouthfeel that could use less biting carbonation. This doesn't exactly stand out among winter seasonals, so it's not really worth seeking out, but it's still pretty tasty."
"Pours a cola brown with a touch of red and a creamy tan head. Smells of sweet bready malts, vanilla, and cinnamon. Taste starts with rich, toasted, sweet malts, light caramel, and vanilla. Finsh is roasty bitter with lingering sweet vanilla and I can taste the alcohol. The best Pyramid brew in my opinion."
"Drinkability is pretty high, much better that I remembered."
"Pyramid Snow Cap is by far the best that pyramid offers. The apperance is of mahogany brown with a darker tannish head. The head slows down to a thin layer as you drink. Lacing will drift as you drink as well. Smell is of little malts and very fruity, some hops come into play towards the end. Taste is a little bitter but not in a bad way. Fruit and hops blast in the end and a great malty end. Feels full and flavorful in the mouth. On a cold day a very warming beverage. Ah got to love winter."
"Pours a nice dark brown with amber tints with an off white head sitting on top. Smell is frutty with a hint of skunkness. Taste is of sweet syurpy with a bitterness almost balanced but too sweet. Mouthfeel is ok but the beer could use finer bubbles. Drinkability is good especially when you consider the ABV."
"This poured a very deep and dark ruby/burgundy color with a thin white head that left literally no lace behind. The aroma is straight up cherry Robotussin. Yuck! It doesnt get much better in the taste. Too sticky and syrupy sweet. Intense fruity bite without much of a malt presence. This beer is unbalanced and not that drinkable. Its full of fruit flavor, but is bitter, acidic and tannic. I really tried but couldnt find much I liked about this beer. No thanks."
"I can see how some would like it, but I can't see anyone hogging a full six pack to themselves. Funny, that seems to be the norm for my experience with Pyramid."
"Drinkability - Not really a session beer. Not really even all that great due to the aftertaste, but a good enough all-arounder. The 6-pack will easily be quaffed in its entirety and enjoyed forthwith."
"Tan head of moderate duration with plenty of clingy lace around the side of the glass. Dark amber/chestnut in color, with adequate carbonation. Nose evinces a notable tangy/sourness alongside abundant fruity esters, a hint of rich malt, and another hint of alcohol. Bitter/crisp, bursting with fruit, and tingly carbonation, all at first sip. Mouthfeel is full and smooth but lively, aromatics are good, and hints of pale biscuity malt are not altogether eclipsed by the alcohol. A wonderful lingering bitterness is accentuated by hop spiciness here, a noted change from the buttery quality of years past. Although generous (7%) the alcohol is on-par for the style, and while this offering from Pyramid has been reliably consistent over the years, until now (2003 Edition / East Kent Goldings) emphasis on Hop variety wasnt incorporated into the label. This is a batch to cellar well into the new year."
"Flavor was very much autolyzed. Meaty, yeasty, brothy flavor. Some good malt/hop flavors but the autolysis detracted from the malt and hops. Bad bottle?"
"Drinkability: This is a pretty potent beer for a seasonal, reminds me more of a barleywine than a winter seasonal. Seems a bit too heavy for the style."
"Drinkability: For a ""big"" beer, this is an extremely well-mannered, easy-to-drink brew. While the Pyramid offerings are not the most popular on this site, it's hard to deny the quality of this one. Well done."
"I love the dark color on this brew. I poured this from a bottle I had in a ""Brewer's Box"" (assortment of Pyramid brews) into a pint glass and was presented with a small tan head that quickly disappated. Carbonation is on par and this beer goes down easy with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Nice and potent, I would not mind drinking this again."
"The head on this beer is biggish and tan. It's a little fizzy, but dies slowly nonetheless. The beer is dark, dark, garnet/brown and there is some sticky, clumpy lacing. That's strange. There's a sourish note in the caramel nose. The front shows lots of fruit. You know, it kind of tastes like Twizzlers (strawberry licorice)! The middle is more tart, a little sour and shows some deep caramel. There's only a touch of the fruity sweetness from the front. Finally, there's a quite bitter finish: some bitter cocoa and alcohol aplenty. It's not bad. It seemed more aggressive last year on tap at the brewpub in Seattle."
"This is reminscent of a ton of other mediocre winter brews that I have tried this season. This brew was a murky brown colour with a small head of off-white foam. The aromas were heavily malty, with some spices and booze in there as well. The taste was quite malty with some nice hopping going on as well. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and the drinkability was just OK."
"I wasn't expecting much from this beer (with Pyramid's reputation), but this is surprisingly good, and better than some other winter ""old ales"" that I've had this season. Surprisingly, one I'll probably have next year."
"This poured with very little head. It's color is deep mahogany/brown. The smell was mostly of alcohol with slight spice. It feels thin in the mouth and has no spice taste. It tastes okay, but certainly isn't something I'd want more than once. This wasn't what I expected for a winter brew."
"2003 vintage... a low tan head formed when poured into a pint glass. This brew was a dark nut brown color with an orange-red hue. Smelled strongly of roasted hazelnuts and wet wool! This one had big flavors of stong roastiness and toasted nuts with an assertive hop punch wrapping around it. Well balanced with lingering roastiness and hops. I found it to be quite enjoyable in the absence of imperial porters or stouts in my mug. It had a medium smooth body...good. I found it to be quite drinkable. This one had a lot of oomph and was flavorful enough to keep me interested the whole way through. Good winter brew."
"This is a decent winter brew. Very dark brown in color. The nose is somewhat hoppy. There is little to no head but a good bit of lacing. The hop profile is great and combines well with the carbonation. The malt is a little boring. The alcohol is 7% and is hidden quite well. I like this beer but it is a very typical ""seasonal ale"". Nothing stands out very much."
"A very nice color, dark red brown. Standard xmas beer spice smell, nice. Taste is a rush of alcohol that's not really masked well by the bitter malts and hops. The spices are notable, but really in the background. I'd skip this and get the Sam Adams winter lager if I were you."
"Pours a deep mahogany with no head to speak of,aroma is on the sweetish side with some light nuttines.Taste is also on the sweeter side with some dried fruit flavors the hops become present for me after a few sips with the alcohol flavors really coming thru.For an old ale for one its pretty hoppy and two is very easy to drink for the alcohol content,I like this style and this one is pretty darn good."
"TheLongBeachBum (see below) does a better job on the review."
"Cheers Sir Richard  this was a nice one."
"""Snowcap is a proud tribute to the potent winter ales traditional to Great Britain. Deep mahogany in color and full of complex flavors, Snow Cap combines specially roasted barley, malts and aromatic hops for a robust winter brew that is an ideal choice for the holiday season."""
"Appearance: Deep ruby almost takes on a deep purple tone with a nice creamy textured tan head nice sized at that, with nice even ringed lacing patterns. Aroma: A bit dull but I can pick out some toasted malts, mild spicing, some finishing hops and of course a kick of alcohol in the nose here. Taste: Soft sweetness starts to roll of the tip of the tongue then suddenly I hit a road block it finishes with a strong overbearing onesided flavor a bit soapy and hoppy but mainly bitterness comes through not any flavoring from the hops. Mouthfeel: Light to medium in body compared to most winter ales this one lacks body and the carbonation seems a bit spritzy. Drinkability: Worth a try because it's winter time and there's so many awesome brews to choose from I don't want to overlook anything, but I could have gone without this one just not that enjoyable for me."
"I've had many better strong ales than this one. It poured nice with an opaque darkness and good sized bubbling head. But the actually beer was not the best. It was balanced but the flavors seemed a little dull. Not much depth and alcohol was a little too strong. The spices seemed to be missing, isn't this a winter beer? Improved as it warmed and the flavors melded better together but all in all, not as good as I had hoped."
"A nice winter offering."
"A welcome addition to the shelves of my local beer store. Pours a deep mohogany hue with a fluffy tan head. Smells malty with a little bit of hops and spice. Tastes very nice. Smooth maltiness with a slight spiciness and a little bit of hops in the finish. A very solid holiday brew."
"Update: For 2004 they hopped this baby up with some stiff pine resin. It smells and tastes a whole lot hoppier. The mouthfeel though is still too light for the big flavors theyre packing into this beer."
"The taste that reminds me of the Holidaze. I love it when this comes out each year. Correct me if I am wrong though, but this year's offering is not as hoppy as other years'. Just a wonderful winter ale for sipping by the fire watching TV. I find I can only drink one or two though, starts to taste pugnant after that. But that first sip and others are really enjoyable. Deep dark color with a hint of ruby color to it. Malty and slightly bitter aftertaste. Slight flowery nose with a good head that seems to hold on real well."
"A most drinkable winter brew..Pyramids best beer!"
"Definitely worth a try, a winter classic."
"Dark brown color, large white foamy head. Roasted malts, generously hopped with fuggles hops, slightly spicy. Rich full mouthfeel. Very malty, very hoppy, but still has a smooth taste. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is malty and slightly bitter."
"I found this beer to be a bit 'watered' down tasting an not very pleasant. I was pretty disappointed. I may try it again in the future since my experience was nothing like a lot of other people's"
"Light to medium head. Excellent combination of citrus and spice in the flavor. A very gentle overall taste, with just enough of a bite to comfort you on a cool evening. This is a very good, gonna have one beer and relax beer. A beer to be enjoyed sifted. Finishes with a coffee aftertaste."
"2002. A deep mahogany body with reddish highlights is capped by a short but creamy light-tan head. It's retention is limited, and it drops shortly to a thin collar and leaves only minimal spotty lacing. The nose is not very welcoming, but not exactly off-putting. It clearly displays some higher alcohols with notes of acetone/solvent and acetaldehyde. I can only believe that the fermentation was hot and fast! Beyond that there's not much: some mild maltiness, light woody/earthy character, and maybe fading spices. Fortunately, a third strike is avoided as the higher alcohols are somewhat masked in a flavor that's malty and deeply toasted with a light spiciness and a firm, resiny hop flavor. The bitterness is well entrenched and also helps to cover up its ""heat"". Surprisingly, it finishes quite dry but with a spot of sweet caramelized malt. Some hop bitterness lingers, but the heat of the alcohol also starts to build at the back of the throat. Disappointing. I hope I didn't wait too long to try this. However, it has a good reputation and I'll give it another shot next year!"
"Overall, a good beer that seems like it could use a little refinement."
"Deep brownish-red brew with an off-white head. Head retention isn't great. Aroma is very malty, with intense caramel sweetness and toasted character. The taste is reminiscent of a doppelbock, but with lots of hops added. Sweet caramel and a little toasted malt at the front, followed by the unexpected rush of oily and leafy hop bitterness. Finish is a bit mellow, but still hoppy. Nice leafy aftertaste. Overall, this is a pretty good effort. I like the uniqueness of it."
"pickiness."
"Pours a very deep amber with a thick foamy head that eventually settles. Leaves a little bit of lace on the glass. Aroma is malty... with caramel malt, a touch of cherry, spice, and alcohol. Flavor begins and ends with a lot of malt sweetness, with some accompanying spice, a slight astringent flavor, a touch of oak, some finishing bitterness, and a warming alcohol flavor. Has a full body with a syrupy mouthfeel. A bit heavy on the sweet malt for my tastes, but a decent winter warmer."
"Dark orange-copper color, huge foamy off white head, leaves a nice lace in the glass, malty caremel aroma, medium bodied with a light and watery mouthfeel. It does finish dry and crisp, not bad, drinkable."
"Of all the winter ale's I've had this season, this is probably only par. Nothing outstanding, but nothing that would make it undrinkable. Dark in color, full flavored. Not a lot of hop pressence. Decent enough to try once this seasonl, but chances are I'll find something else next time I go down the beer isle."
"Darkish reddish-brown, translucent around the edges, coppery highlights. Off-white head, fair retention, good lace. The nose was malty sweet with notes of citrusy hops. Alcohol is detectable. Very agreeable hoppiness, real malty body, excellent balance. This winter warmer does a commendable job at distinguish itself from the rest of the winter seasonals. Worthy of a try."
"Crusty tan head, deep dark brown in color. Aroma: full of dark, but sweet, sensations, espresso and dark chocolate first and foremost, also burnt toast and spices. Texture is a trifle grainy at first, but mellows soon. Then, the hop bite jumps into the fray! Slightly syrupy, but big carbonation, this seems different from when I had it in bottles last year. Has the feel of an extra-hoppy brown ale, or a super-charged porter. Very warming, and very satisfying!"
"Color certainly looks nice in the glass, a deep reddish brown tint that you can see straight through. Aroma doesn't leave much impression. Taste is slightly bitter with a high alcohol flavor and some medicinal quality. I don't think this one would taste good warmed up. Slight green wood flavor perhaps from the hops. I bought a single for $1.49. I'm pretty glad I didn't get a whole 6 pack. Bottle is 2002 edition best before 5/9/03. A little age might not be a bad thing for this one."
"A very good beer. If this is what Winter / Seasonal beers are coming to, I like it. This is a nice change of pace from the normal, spicey and fruity winter-type brews I am used to trying. This brew has a very respectable head that lingers, but is quite light. The aroma has some hint of spice, but again, very subtle. This is a drinkable seasonal. Enough said. Prost!"
"Pours dark mahogany in color with a thin tan colored head. Nose is sweet roasted malts and lots of spice. Taste is tart apple cider, bitter chocolate and dark coffee, sweet caramel, and spice. A bit of a dry finish and the 7% alcohol makes this a nice winter warmer. This is one of the better winter brews I have tried."
"Deep clear brown, minimal 1/8 inch head that reduces to a skim in 40 seconds. Nice smells, a slight sense of maple. Quickly, the flavor seems deep and slightly coffee-like with a little bit of mature raisins. The brew then turns more neutral with Goldings hops dominating the close. Pleasant, has some alcohol power and seems to be a decent offering from Pyramid. One of the better ones from this brewery and ranks pretty well among seasonals Ive had this year."
"Very festive - dark ruby chestnut with a big goldings hops nose. Lots of malt backbone to this old ale to stand up to liberal hopping. A little thick on the mouthfeel, with herbal and dark fruit hints wafting about. Well worth including in the holiday ale lineup."
"A medium-length finish leaves a surge of bitter spice flavors that keeps the experience dry and focused."
"Poured a clear reddish copper color and the foam despated almost immediatley. The aroma was of a malty smell mixed with a hin of pine and alcohol. The taste was of a sort of sweet malt and alcolhol ending with a pleasant bitterness that was not to over powering. But the bitterness does linger on the palate for quit awhile!"
"Deep dark brown color, monumental head, frothy with tons of lace, both light chocolate in color. Malt dominates the nose, lightly floral and perfume like sweetness. Start is mostly malt, the top a medium mouth feel, the finish hop spicy, mild to moderate carbonation, fairly dry aftertaste, a decent drinking beer, well worth a sample."
"Bronze/Bright Amber color with good tan lasting head.  Strong spicy malt aroma and flavor.  Full bodied and strong with alcohol character kicking in as it warms up..."
"Nice little brown head. Very dark brew. Very warming. Dry, cedary finish. There's toffee and mellow caramel notes. Hints of mocha also. Very nicely balanced brew. Strong too. Has been a staple in my winter beer selection for about 5 years now."
"Probably Pyramid's best brew. Toasted grain aroma with essence of prune. Semi sweet full body. A nice winter seasonal and good all around changeup from the usual."
"-Nice sweet English old ale style...mahogony in color...faint malt smell...bit of alcohol aroma towards the finish..not oversweet with nice hop balance... toasty grains evident with a bit of a dry finish...nicely balanced beer with a lot of character.."
"2004 update. The above was written when the principal hops in Snowcap was Fuggles. The last few years, the beer has made it back to Houston, but now Pyramid is now using East Kent Golding. Less earthy, a little more piney, it just ain't the same. Bring back the beer I remember!"
