"A beautiful warmer start to finish. One of the best I've ever had in this category."
""
""
""
"Pours a medium amber with a little cloudiness and formed a two finger head. Feels nice with a little alcohol bite. Finishes smooth, a lot smoother than the front end would suggest. You first taste dark malt with a sweet finish of brown sugar. For a minute I thought it was a Brown Ale. Overall I'm very pleased with shipyards take on this. Very good beer for a style that's sometimes overlooked. Great beer. Well done shipyard!"
"Medium bodied, lightly effervesced. No warming though."
"O - I was wildly disappointed in this brew given the ratings and despite the freshness date being quite a ways out in the future I can't help but think something happened to the batch I picked up.   I will have to revisit again, next year, to hopefully revise."
"Tried last night, taste like a smithwicks, but much more flavorful"
"This Beautiful Looking Full Bodied, Malty Masterpiece pours a Gorgeous Amber Brown and falls into the Hearty Ale Category..... It would Pair PERFECTLY with a Twice Baked Potato and a Thick Juicy Steak.....Yet Another Success Story from SHIPYARD Brewing Co."

"Not as spiced as some. Which is a good thing sometimes. Malty. Really enjoyed and would have more."

"Overall it was a nice winter beer that did not have the excessive spices that ruin some winter ales; good, but not one I'd seek out or have more than one in a session as this style is one I seem to only have because it’s winter and it’s there."
""
""
"O: Great winter warmer."
""
"Overall: This is an ok brew. Good for warming up on a cold snowy day."
"O - Decent beer, the aroma is very nice, but flavor does not follow up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste has a slightly more bitter after effect than the aroma might suggest but the caramel and holiday spices punch it up a bit. I am a fan of Shipyard brews and I look forward to this one each year. I can't believe I had not reviewed it until 2013!"

"O: This has some of the traditional flavors of an old or strong ale but the ABV and esters are more muted. Very drinkable, especially in colder weather, or as a nightcap."

"Poured from twist-off bottle into becker pint glass. Pours deep garnet red with a thin cap of loose foam that fades quickly to a loose rim of bubbles, leaving some lacing on the glass. Smells like...vinegar? Upon a second examination as it warms I can tell that that smell is more butterscotch. Taste is strong sweet malts, surprisingly a bit boozy for the relatively low % (at least compared to other ""stronger"" beers), and a bit of hop bitterness at the end coupled with leftover spiciness. Not sure if I enjoy this style, but it'd definitely be more enjoyable on a cold winter night (instead of the middle of June)."

"Mouthfeel : Not as full as I would expect for a winter ale, but not terribly disappointing either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall not that great of a winter warmer which is what I expected from Shipyard."
""
"Pours a dark brown with a hint of amber. Ample head at pour disappates to a rim around the glass. Nice lacing. Smell is malty and slight alcohol presence via nose. Taste has lots going on - malty sweetness maybe mixed in with some plum, nuts (pecan or other richer nut), and a trace of smoke. Quality beer for a cold day."
"Overall: a bit too sweet and just not right for me. It was okay. I would drink this again, but it wouldn't be my first choice"
""
""
""
"Simply fantastic! One of the, if not the, best winter style beers I can get in the area!"
""
"O: a well-crafted winter warmer that is not overly spiced, too sweet, or boozy."
""
""
"Atmosphere is really good, here. Dark hue, solid frothy head, and lots of lacing which holds court throughout the experience. Nose is an excellent combination of malt, hops, nuts, zesty fruit, and savory spice components. Slightly sweet with a complimentary hop balance. Complex combination of nuts, sweet, and savory spice. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Toasted malt, subtle cinnamon, caramel, nutty. A nice little hop bite comes around in the mix. An easy-drinking, pleasant seasonal offering."
""
""
"Overall: The appearance of the beer drew me in, but there wasn't really anything in this beer that kept me interested. The buttery taste for me was not a positive characteristic of this beer. I think it's worth buying once to experience as I'm sure other people would find this beer good."
"O- this is good... but I wish it was a tad bigger. It almost teases me in the sense of a old ale but tuned down for a decent price for the customer.... nice price and easy drinking bit nothing to brag about"
""

"Boring beer for the most part. This was my first time having it and I highly doubt I'd seek it out again."
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap and served in a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, ruby-brown coloring with a thin, filmy, off-white head that is thin and clingy. Aromas of nut sweet and biscuit, with a strong caramel and toffee profile, also. Flavors are rich and roasty, with a boozey highlight. Toffee and tangy caramel blend with a subtle all-spice spicing. Rich, full bodied with a crisp, slightly effervescent finish and feel. Rich, slightly boozey aftertaste. Very strong, solid brew."
""
""
""
""
"Deep, cloudy amber in color with roasted nuts and chocolate on the nose. I'll definitely be back for more."
""
""
""
"Overall: I really like the taste of this winter warmer. I would definitely have this again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad beer by any means, it is actually a very tasty beer, but not one of the best representations of the style. I've had better winter warmers, but I am by no means bashing Shipyard, as they produce many high quality beers. I do enjoy a winter warmer every now and again, but as much as I enjoy Shipyard's beers, I believe I'll stay clear of this one unless no other viable option is available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, it had its moments. I’d probably try it again on a cold winter day on the East Coast."
""
""
"O - There's a welcome thing or two that keep this from being totally bland, but there isn't enough of interest here for me to buy it again."
"Pours a clear copper with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Thin streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasty malt, toasted nuts, and some caramel aromas. Taste is of toasted malt and nuts, caramel, and some herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of slightly medicinal bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I like the way it smells more than the way it tastes."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Good one to try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not much of a fan of Winter Warmers, but this one was pretty good. The spices were there, but not over the top. It was sweet, but not overly so. I'm bordering on actually seeking this beer out next year. Would be great for Christmas time."
""
""
""
"O - A different tasting beer. The spices aren't anything I can place. Not quite appealing to me, but I can see how it might appeal to other's tastes."
""
""
"From a 22 oz bottle. No indication of bottling date."
"Overall: A pretty good beer. Not terribly complex, but very drinkable."
""
"Overall - Alright, but nothing really too special for a winter brew as the taste is a little lacking."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer isn’t as complex as some of the other beers in the style, but the flavors begin to develop as the beer warms up. The alcohol is well hidden from the taste, which makes this easy to drink."
""
""
"Poured a roasted nut brown with a tinge of burnt orange,a fliffy off white head atop.A nice mix of roasted nuts,vanilla,cinnamon,and fruitiness in the nose,well rounded malt complexity.Roasty and even a little raw earthy on the palate,very light sweetness with some vanilla and cinnamon-like qualities in the back end.I tried this a few years back and I don't recall liking it as much as I do now,its a solid well rounded winter warmer that is not overly spiced and/or sweet."
"And of course the beer may have been easier to drink had it been either a little more sparkling, or creamy."
""
""
""
"Poured a 1"" beige fine foam head. Very deep clear amber color verging on brown. Smell is malt but not much else. Taste again has malt and seems to me to have spices such as nutmeg though others didn't reference that. Has a hint of banana esthers. Good, interesting, but not particularly a standout."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I liked this quite a bit. It's a cold rain outside tonight, and this beer is living up to the style of winter warmer. I will probably buy this again. It's good."
"Overall, not a bad brew, but I wouldn't rush back."
"O. Very good, heavy. Great seasonal. Maybe my favorite Shipyard. Seems very English--if that makes any sense."
""
"O: This needs improvement. Tone down the carbonation and you're halfway there."
""
"Not good, not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Don't love the style, but this one is pretty legit. Probably my favorite so far. I enjoy the hops. Its a bit paler than others I have tried and I also enjoy that. Probably one of Shipyard's best beers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice beer, and something that I might buy again. I really enjoyed the sweet flavors, as well as the fact that there was a pleasant hoppy bitterness to balance it all out"
"O: so Shipyard makes a decent winter warmer, check, I'll come back to this"
"O: Descent winter warmer. I had higher hopes for the taste and mouthfeel, but it wasn't bad."
""
"O- Tasty beer. Not a style that I have a lot of experience with, but sure I will have more over the next few months."
"Descent. A little rough around the edges but a good starting point for a winter brew."
""
"D - The first craft beer that I fell in love with. Too heavy and sweet to drink more than one or two."
"O/D- Not knowing what to expect from this style, I must say I am pleasantly surprised. The dwindling supply in my fridge prompted me to say mmm, that sounds good, I think I'll have that, and I'm glad I finally did. Nicely suited to a chilly day, this style makes the knowledge of the inevitable winter freeze almost tolerable. A thank you to duff27."
"D/O- I can understand why this would be a polarizing beer. Drank out of season but I'm sure it's held up none-the-less, nothing gone wrong about it. Would have again in the future but probably not more than one in a single sitting."
"O-Good beer for Shipyard. Decent warmer, but there are so many better ones out there. I'd like to see this a bit more aggressively spiced."
"Mouthfeel started out ok, but what I seem to run into time and again with these overly malty beers is an odd finish with the maltiness not leaving me wanting another sip."
"More likely the issue is with the combbo of yeast/hops/malts that makes up this brew, along with whatever else they do to it. It will not make it to my repeat list, but maybe I would feel more favorable to it in the correct season. Maybe I can pawn these off on my son."
"Light to medium body with some soft carbonation that helps stimulate the taste buds. Pretty light for a winter warmer in terms of body and alcohol content."
"Wow, very nice winter warmer. A truly sessionable brew at nearly 7% alcohol. Nice flavor profiles; malts in the middle hops in the end. Lots of flavors and lots of goodness here. Case worthy stuff. I have only had a few from Shipyard, I suspect this may be their best offering."
"Drinkability - I like the malty side more than the hoppy side of this one."
"Overall: Overall the beer was better than I expected. The beer has a great smell and nice complex flavor that moves from roasted flavor to a sweeter flavor and finishes with a nice bitter aftertaste. I definitely recommend trying this beer."
"Prelude Special Ale, despite not being *special* beer, is one of SBC's better efforts. A better mouthfeel would not have increased the scores on either side of it, but it would have made this a more enjoyable experience. Worth a single each winter."
"Great for winter - warming and satisfying, without being over-bearing."
"excellent winter, great price, hits the spot every time. full flavor but still 'sessionable'"
"Ending notes: I was actually impressed with this brew from Shipyard. Very nice balance. It's a great beer to warm up with on a winter night after working all day long. Quite enjoyable. I would get this one again."
"This may be the best of the style I've tried, and my new go-to winter warmer."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle, but definitely the 2010 batch. Pours a translucent mahogany with a loose, quarter inch, tan-colored head. Head dissipates into a consistent skim across the surface. Some swaths of lacing present during the tasting. Nose is nutty and somewhat consistent with an English Nut Brown; however, there's also a trace of skunk and some caramel and toffee notes. Taste follows nose - skunky quality is a little more forthcoming in the flavor profile. There's also a trace of spice in the mix, perhaps nutmeg, as well as another quality I can't quite tease out - maybe some form of dark fruit. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a consistent carbonation, some creaminess and a slight acidity. The skunk to this beer really kills it for me. I can drink maybe one in a sitting and it's not terrible, but that off flavor hangs around. Not something I need to revisit anytime soon."
"M/D: Medium bodied, but on the thicker side. Overall, pretty good. The only thing it has going against it was the presence of the alcohol. I like a little bit of heat in my winter warmers, but a little less here would have done the trick for me. Some nice flavors and a solid beer."
"D: I've sessioned this beer more than a few times. Drink a sixer and you'll be gone for the night. Easy to drink, and the alcohol sneaks up on you big time"
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability - superb brew here. Very interesting taste/complexity throughout. Very drinkable."
"This suprised me. Has beginnings of a malty, nut brown but shows some hops in the finish. Color is dark amber. Smell raisins, some earthiness. Taste, slight sweet malty, with some floral hints when the hops hit. Smooth mouthfeel, lingers in a good way. Very well put together. Great winter brew."
"Not bad. But clearly not one of my favorites."
"*Revision* - having read other review that mention chocolate and an earthy quality to the hop bitterness, I would have to agree, though the chocolate is verrrry subtle and only on the tail end of the transition. I would also say that what I mistook for vanilla and caramel in the bouquet may actually be more like butterscotch."
"12oz Shipyard's Prelude into Delirium Tremens globe. Pours a dark auburn shade with a cool light tan head. Smells danky with spicy notes barely shinning through, such as cinnamon and a tad of ginger. Leaves a decent amount of lace on the walls of this glass. Tastes of sweet caramel 60L and roasted malt, and a slight bit of spice. Not too much hops to speak of here, but most likely willamette. This brew is somewhat a complex drink to ponder on, I feel like it's a tougher one to figure out because not really anything is pronounce or obvious in this brew. Everything melds together really nice here. Overall I used to love this brew alot, but it seems like it has changed since the unavailability down here in Georgia in 09'. It's a cool beer to share with others that truly have an appreciation for this style. Merry Christmas and Cheers to all!"
"UPDATE: Had this in a growler from the Kennebunkport Brewery as well, and the flavors were really fresh. My first bottle was aged a year. Both were good, but I would recommend having it fresh."
"Drinks alright, but doesn't quite pull together for me. Beer is not as good as the appearance & scent would lead me to believe. Not bad, I would drink one or two if offered, but fairly middling as winter warmers go IMO"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly chewy but not too heavy. Overall, this is a classic example of what a winter warmer should be and certainly one of Shipyards best."
"D: I could put down a few if I didn't let them warm up too much."
"Definitely a good brew for a cloudy, cold December day."
"Bought a six pack for the holiday. Beautiful amber color with patchy lacing on the sides and medium sized head that dissipates after a bit. The aromas were fantastic: malt, ginger, roasted spices, sugar, molasses, and so much more. Definitely a top aroma winner for me. The taste represented the sweet tastes with a heavy malt flavor. Really nice and dry aftertaste. The drink definitely had a clean and crisp mouthfeel to it. Overall, a fantastic seasonal."
"D-pleasantly surprised by this one, was very good and I could easily have a few more"
"An interesting Warmer. Nice dark brown with not much head. Aroma is malt with just a hint of spice. Flavor follows thru with big malty flavors and nice hints of cloves and dark fruit. But also a nice bitterness that lingers at the end. Sometimes Warmers can be overheavy, but this one cleans the palate at the end and keeps you sipping. A very nice twist on this style."
"Well it is winter, but I don't exactly call 68 degrees cold, but for here it is. Need some warmer, so let's give this one a whirl. Poping the top this brew smells very sweet and malty, a little bit of molasses and slight hint of butterscotch. Pours into my trusty testing glass to an orange brown with a beige multi-size bubble head. Taste is well balanced and delicious. Taste starts with a big sweet malt backbone balanced with some zesty more than bitter hops. In the middle the taste is a little more bitter and bitterness builds into the end. The aftertaste is a flat bitterness with a lingering malt base. THe 6.8%ABV is not really noticeable except for the fact that it does indeed deliver on the warmth factor. A tasty brew that delivers as promised and an incredible bang for the buck compared to alot of similar but overpriced craft brews."
"Mouthfeel is quite nice: well carbonated, med to full, slightly creamy and sticky with a bit of a dry finish. ABV % is present throughout, slightly in the nose and more pronounced in the taste."
"The feel of this beer is a light and goes down real well. Expecting a beer is a big heavy feel but was welcomed by a beer that does not push you over the top. A very mellow and interesting beer."
"This is probably one of the more drinkable Shipyard beers. Neither over-spiced nor too strong to enjoy 2 or 3 bottles, a six pack could be split between two people for an enjoyable evening of drinking. This is one winter seasonal I always make sure to get a 6 pick of; a tradition I've had since I discovered craft beer. This beer will also keep well for 6-8 months; it a great one to brake out mid-summer, for a cool taste of winter during a heatwave."
"D: Pretty drinkable, it was a bit hot feeling, but the flavor was complex and interesting."
"Verdict: A nice Prelude to any evening."
"D- Very easy to drink, smooth and complex"
"Better than I expected."
"Overall I was surprised with this one. I am typically disappointed by Shipyard, but this one was pretty good. A really nice body, lots of complex flavors blended well and didn't go over the top. It did drink a little hot though, especially for under 7%."
"Prelude has a lot of stuff going on in it, and the layers of sweetness come together very nicely. I suggest drinking it at around room temperature. As winter warmers go, Prelude is a good one."
"I would have liked more spicing in this one to make it a little more complex and inviting, but the incredible malt character makes this one a winner."
"Mouthfeel, beer gets better throughout, pick up on some flavors that defy description on the palate. Intriguing. Recommend."
"D – Not a bad option, and quite nice for a Shipyard brew."
"Overall- creamy and malty. Went down well on a cold snowy night."
"Good drinkability on a nice winter beer."
"D: This is a full flavored winter warmer. Nicely balanced with great malty flavor but enough hops to give it a little bite. I was suprised by this one, it was better than I thought it would be. Great brew from shipyard."
"Drinkability: easy to quaff but overall it is a bit on the sweet side. A pint is enough IMHO."
"D- It seems easy to throw this one back so ten to twelve shouldn't be a problem. This, however, should not be mistaken for high quality as I was not too impressed"
"A nice malty, sweet, but not cloying or sticky, sipper!"
"It pours out a darker amber / light brown color with a tan creamy head. The aroma is sweet with butterscotch, caramel and molasses, hitting you up front with some winter spices. The taste is much milder and malty then you expect. There is a nice hint of alcohol to complement the spices and the hops come through in the finish with some bitterness to balance it all out. This is a hearty beer in your mouth and could work excellent with some food. Its also very session-able, it goes down easy and isn't overly spiced. It comes in with an ABV of 6.8% which makes it good for a winter day or evening of drinking with friends. Shipyard did a great job with this winter warmer."
"D- Overall, this was a very enjoyable beer that I would not mind purchasing again. The drinkability is great despite the almost 7% ABV. Definitely Recommended!"
"Overall, a decent winter warmer that can come off a bit strong and has a slightly offensive taste upfront."
"D: Nice going down and easy to repeat. No over spice or too powerful of flavors. Shipyard does it right on this winter warmer. A nicely balanced beer with some interesting and complex flavors too."
"Pours a crystal clear garnet with a one finger off white head that leaves light rings of lacing. Aromas of sweet caramel, brown sugar, clove and other spices. Nice, very sweet malt up front, caramel with some chocolate in the middle. Then the finish has a very bitter lemon, like the pith not the rind and the spices come in to overpower. Light carbonaiton, medium body with a chalky mouthfeel with a solid dry finish. Looks, smells and starts out good but the finish ruins the drinkability in this one, not balanced at all."
"The perfect winter (almost) session beer."
"A clean amber ale, this one begins with a warm and comfortable aroma of clove and spice. The taste reflects this, with a strong spicy palate and smooth malty inclination. Unfortunately, there's little residual complexity. The sweetness is overpowering, rendering this beer decent, but not outstanding."
"This one poured into a pint glass, slightly cooled is a deep, dark, copper colored brew with a big bumpy oatmeal colored head and tons of chunky lacing. I smell subtle evergreen cinnamon and very light malt. I taste some resinous malt and sweet herbal hop. Very nicely balanced with fine carbonation. Quite drinkable. I'd call this solidly mid-bodied. The evergreen/juniper notes speak softly but work nicely to define the style. A very enjoyable holiday choice."
"This beer also has a lot of meaning for me. Two years ago my late wife and I went to the Prelude celebration in Maine and we had a great time and had planned to return. I knew Shipyard brew an ale for this celebration and only very recently did I find out that they bottled it but I never saw it for sale in NJ. On Christmas eve I was in my new favorite beer store and there in the middle of the floor just delivered were 4 cases of Prelude. Was not even in their computer when I grabbed a 6. This started off my son's and mine sober celebration. A small Christmas miricale."
"Normally not a fan of Shipyard, but this one changed my mind. Poured into a stemmed glass. Dark auburn color. Wonderful head and lacing. Woody and spiced smell. Taste was perfect for a winter beer. Plenty of spices that we all recognize from a winter warmer, but just enough to taste but not overwhelm. A perfect balance of flavor and restraint. Hearty on the palate, but smooth to drink. Would never guess it was 6.8%. Best winter beer of 2009 so far for me. After the six pack was done, we went out and bought a 12 pack because we liked it so much. Thank you Shipyard, for nailing this one."
"Flavor abound, great drinkability for an ale of this genre, and all the other aspects are in check here. This one's worth checking out."
"I'm not sure why I haven't had this beer more often, it is simply DAMN good. Very much an english stle, almost cask-ish tasting, winter warmer. I could drink this all day."
"d- this is a drinkable beer, and a tasty one at that. this was my first winter warmer and it was a solid one at that. i'm a fan of drinking my beers more on the cold side, this one got better and better as it warmed, the next i drink i'll let it sit out a bit before i open and pour."
"Poured a brownish body with red tints with huge head and lace patches. Had a sweet smell with some caramel and butterscotch as well as some dry malts and a little springy hops. A smooth body with some spices to match the sweetness and goes down in a medium, creamy body. Malts are mostly caramel with some toffee and some spices like cinnamon that kick it up and it finishes clean and dry thanks to spice and hop. Little bit of fruit flavor from hops but not much. This is a good beer but something about it seemed a tad off to me."
"D: Would enjoy more than one, a nice beer for the style"
"This is a very nice winter beer and definatley a winner from Shipyard."
"Very much the anti sweet and heavily spiced winter beer. Dry and woody with a hint of spices. Drinkability is going to depend on you liking a dry beer."
"Drinkability: Not your typical winter warmer, this one has a nice, dry oak like finish to it that is missing out of alot of other seasonal beers, the nice earthy aromas are pleasant, and for 6.8% ABV, this one goes down like a charm. A good toasted malt backbone is nicely aligned! A good start for the winter and a nice brew to kick back with on those colder nights."
"Drinkability: One of Shipyard's better beers. I get a huge dose of finished oak. I could have two of these."
"srinkability - this one makes me wish i had bought more then a single but i have been burned too many times"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Frothy and unassuming, the texture is good. Painfully average and unremarkable."
"Drinkability: So-so. A pleasant, if somewhat simple English-minded brew for winter or whenever, really."
"Bottle Pours a clear reddish brown with a good froathy tan head. The head lasts well. Has a malty aroma with hints of vanilla and alcohol. Has a good carbination and a nice mouthfeel. Has a bubblie water texture. Nice blending. The flavors really come together well. Has a solid finish. This is pretty good. Lacks some hoppiness but it still works."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Dark amber with a light tan head that leaves fine thin lace on the glass. Smells of caramel malt, brown sugar and dark fruit. Tastes much like the smell with some very subtle holiday spicing in the finish. Medium bodied with crisp carbonation. A milder spiced winter warmer that suits me just fine."
"D- Doesn't seem like a 6.80 ABV. Goes down pretty easy. I would have another."
"I'm no fan of special ales, but I've had many that are better than this."
"A pleasant suprise to a forethought mediocrity!"
"Dark brown with small head that dissipates quickly, lively carbonation apparant. Aroma is filled with dark malt scents. Molasses, caramel, dark brown sugar. Taste is a bit tame. A nice dark malt, but not very complex. Perhaps a hint of clove. Could use some more winter spice. Mouthfeel is a bit light. Could use a little more body and creamyness. A solid very passable beer, but not a remarkable winter warmer, a style that rewards inventiveness."
"The beer poured a translucent, medium-brown color with a soft, off-white head and significant carbonation. The aroma was dominated by toast, alcohol, and roasted malt; interesting, but not unusual or overly enticing. The taste followed suit with an initial hop/malt balance that quickly shifted towards malt and a sweet, caramel flavor. The texture was rather slick and thin, but refreshing. I enjoyed this beer with some pizza and it was a good match. This beer reminded me of both a Belgian Dark Ale and a Bitter. I will certainly enjoy the remainder of the six-pack I picked up."
"Good drinkable beer."
"D - Gets easier to drink as it goes. Would be a favorite in colder weather."
"This is a very nice ale that reminds one that sometimes the wait is worth it."
"D - Very drinkable ale that I enjoyed in an English style pub. I think the surroundings made this beer all the better and I would certainly try it again. I would especially like to try it on tap or from a bottle to see how the beer differs. Great job Shipyard!"
"Ok, so I once got way too drunk with this beer and a very hot girl. I won't lie, I should have had more of her and less of it. But I figured it was worth a re-visit because I did have a good time with her and it. Out of a bottle this beer was a dark chestnut color with a finger of thin khaki head. The retention was not very good but the lacing off the little collar was pretty good as thin rings. The aroma was of caramel malt, toasted malt, a touch of sourness and some light spice. The flavors were pretty good at first, toasted and sweet caramel malt with some lightly spicy notes that appeared in the middle, after this it became just a little awkward, not bad, just awkward with that touch of sourness and some bitter hops before it became more nutty. The finish was distinctly of roasted malt. The mouthfeel was just a little watery but otherwise solid, the body medium and the carbonation very good. Though a little strange I really thought this was a great example of the flavor profile one would expect from a Winter Warmer."
"dark pour. defined by warming alcohol and levels of complexity. i bet this would age pretty well... maybe mellow out a little. for now, it packs a punch, so take it slow. one of my new favorites for a winter seasonal."
"My favorite Shipyard thus far. A nice winter."
"Full, caramel-malty flavor with lots of toastiness on the way down. Moderate maple sugar sweetness as well. Some hop tang on the end of the drink. No spiced or ""holiday"" flavor really, which is great. Some holiday beers are overdone. The Prelude is an exception, just a really good ale. Not too carbonated and buttery mouthfeel. This just became one of my favorite winter seasonals."
"Christmastime ales can be iffy things, too much, not enough, no relation &c. This year's Harpoon sadly is sub-par, while Shipyard's is a damn fine drinking ale. While not overtly spiced or sweetened to death, it retains a just enough particularly in the nose to remind you of Ol' St.Nick & crew. A nice dark red-brown pour sits with a orangey-beige 2 finger head that laces away like water as you drink. The aroma has a nice spiced leather malt with orange & spice hints. The flavor is milder, a smooth & clean feel in the mouth that starts with a mild hop bitter at the tip of the tongue leading to a nicely malted taste with nods towards cashew & yeast. Extraordinarily easy to drink...do we need to wait for the Christmas season each year? & where can I find it on draught..?"
"Drinkability: Nice winter beer. Goes down very smooth and dry finish makes it easy to have a second pint."
"Way easy drinker. Had to pace myself to let the cold pour warm up enough to give if a fair analysis. Recommended."
"Drinkability: Not to strong. Certainly more drinkable than some of the fuller bodied winter ales."
"Around 9 or 10 bucks a six-pack."
"Shipyard Prelude pours a dark almond brown with a hint of amber. Nice initial tight compact head that later fades to a ring. Smell is on the lighter side of malts and yeast. Taste is nutty and bitter. The nut flavor from this ale is really pleasant but the bitter aftertaste takes it away which I don't care for. Mouthfeel is thin yet really smooth with a fluffy medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good drink. I didn't like the bitterness of the aftertaste but everything else was right on for an ale."
"D: Could definitely knock back my share of these. The hops up front was more than I suspected. Definitely softens the spice and sweetness."
"For a winter warmer, the beer is surprisingly light to medium bodied with a modest carbonation. The 6.8% ABV is very well hidden. The beer is clean, crisp, with bittering hops that make the beer slightly imbalanced by the time the finish rolls around. There is a slight caramel flavor, slightly roasted malts, maybe even some charred flavors that get accentuated with the bittering hops in the finish. The beer was not terribly complex, nor overly full of character, but the butterscotch flavors typical of Shipyard were definitely present and complemented the somewhat sharp bittering hops. The mouthfeel was light and the hop bitterness lasted into the aftertaste. A good winter warmer but not a brilliant or complex one."
"I would recommend this one over their regular offerings."
"Drinkability: Not a bad brew, but not a style I'm a big fan of."
"I had a tall one, and could have easily had another. Some winter warmers taste either like pie spice or burnt bread. This is neither. Nice tasty elements that are very well balanced with the caramel sweetness and buttery elements. Not too bitter, not too sweet -- a nice comfortable sipper that also went very well with a big smoky bacon cheeseburger. I will seek this one out for a six pack. Very very decent and a very pleasant surprise. I was sitting at the bar and of all the brews on tap, this one was a constant order -- and understandably so."
"I liked this beer alot. I was very suprised how good it was. It is a deep red to light brown with a big fluffy brown head. Decent amount of lacing down the glass. Smells sweet. Raisins and stone fruit. Butterscotch. Floral hop nose. The taste is caramel, butterscotch, and toasted grain. Medium mouthfeel with good drinkability. This is one of the better winter warmers I have had. Highly recommend."
"Pours a very nice dark brown-copper color with some good inital head and almost decent lacing. Very nice strong malty scent, extremely deep with a nice head of spice (brown sugar, too, maybe?). Good flavor, very deep and earthy, a nice thick malty taste with a good undertone of spiciness, including some cinnamon perhaps, a little caramel, and a nice bit of brown sugar. It's a bit thick going down, but nothing bad or really good about the mouthfeel."
"though being from maine, i've never been a big fan of shipyard. the prelude is different though. latley i've become real into the winter warmer style, perhaps it being the snow starting to fall. the appearance is real dark red/amber with copper accents. the smell reminds me of a scoth ale; with strong sweet accents of malt almost reminiscent of the roasted smell one finds in porters and stouts. the taste is strong with darker malts, lots of breads and butters on the tongue. no real presence of hops, but none is needed in this style. the mouthfeel is light but smooth and the alcohol really begins to warm about half way through. great beer, probably the best from shipyard that i know of."
"Drinkability is fairly high. It's a solid beer, and pretty tasty. It's mild mannered for the most part, but with some interesting flavor profiles. Not overly complex but enough to sit and enjoy by a fire."
"D: Above average winter ale. The alcohol doesn't really warm the belly like others but it certainly is an enjoyable and sessionable seasonal beer."
"This brew isn't overly complex and certainly won't wow! you. I don't personally like the highly spiced winter warmers so I really enjoyed this one. Just a decent, easy drinking, ""winter"" beer."
"It truly is a winter warmer, great flavor character, and very enjoyable on a cold night."
"I've had a handful of Shipyard beers in the past and let's just say there were far less than spectacular. Their pumpkin ale was one of the worst beers I've ever had and their others were pretty boring... but this one is above average and proved my view of this brewery to be off. It's nothing fancy here.. a nice biscuity, bready winter warmer that goes down super smooth and looks great. It has a high ABV so it really warms you up and is super drinkable... no frills and delicious."
"D - This is a pretty good warmer. Not spicy like most, but sweet and malty."
"Fairly dark clear amber pour. Cream head. Malty aroma, sweet and roast, some spice. Surprisingly solid medium body. Malty, caramel/toffee with nice spice and christmas sugar cookie accents. Not as much hop presence as some Christmas ales, which I found nice. Clean finishing and very drinkable. I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this and was pleasantly surprised."
"D: This one has some age on it, but it is still a real nice beer. I found it at the back of the beer fridge and decided to consume it. I am glad I did. It was a great way to finish off a hard nights work."
"Chalk up another average beer for Shipyard. Pours a dark brown color with minimal head. Malty with some sugar spicy flavor in there and slightly sour in the finish. It's decent and warming but nothing too great. It was however $5 for a six pack so the price was very good."
"D- incredibly well-balanced & smooth brew for carrying an ABV of almost 7%. I'll be interested to see if the taste matures more when I crack the case open again later in the year."
"Bottle: Poured a clear medium copper color ale with a huge foamy head with some good retention and some good lacing. Aromas of huge caramel malt are totally dominating with a nice light hoppy touch. Taste is also dominated by that huge medium-sweet caramel malt with a light hoppy finish. Full body with great carbonation and no alcohol detectable. I really like the balance between the medium sweet caramel malt light hoppy notes, really refreshing and easily drinkable."
"Purchased this 22oz bomber from the brewery last weekend and served into a pint glass. Pours a deep amber color with a huge brown head that leaves lacing that lasts till the end. Smells like butterscotch and caramel and a light hop aroma. Tastes like butterscotch and then some hops come in with no spice until the end. I can also detect some toffee in the taste and a nice light bitterness at the end. Their is a decent carbonation to the beer with a nice creaminess to it. This is a nice winter warmer and pretty easy to drink."
"I like the predominant Ringwood character and find the body to be very drinkable, but the lack of malt flavor here is holding this one back. The aroma and flavor have the creamy, candy and spice from the yeast and then the flavor has a slight roasted element to it. There's a small, earthy finishing hop bite and the body is on the light side of medium, easy enough to drink that reading the abv here is surprising. Still a nice WW overall, especially if you dig Ringwood."
"Crystal clear reddish brown with a nice off white head. Very nice. The aroma isn't overwhelming but there's a nice bit of malt. It's a mighty tasty beverage with a great balance of hop, spice and malt. The mouthfeel is nice a bit heavy for more than a couple but over all a wonderful beer."
"Drinkability- A very poor man's Anchor OSA. Falvor isn't as bold as it cold be, plus hops could be a little more stronger as well. Seems watery because of somewhat dullish flavor, but it's not."
"Finish is warm with some citrus zing."
"Had this one in the beer cellar for a while.Pours copper with a one finger tan head. Good retention,and very nice lacing. Aroma is of dark fruits,and spices. Body is medium,and carbonated.Taste is of sweet fruits,with a mix of hops,that give it a hint of grapefruit. Spicey finish. Excellent."
"Drinkability: This is drinkable, and makes for a good winter warmer."
"Feels thick and chewy. Has a liqueur burn on the way down. Syrupy. Strong, sweet loaded with alcohol. Really a fine beer."
"D - Poor. I really don't like this one at all...it's way off base."
"M and D : A lot of carbonation makes this a palate tickler. The pleasantly dry and spicy finish makes this an easy drinker too"
"Poured into a pint glass a dark amber brown with pillowy off-white head of about a half of an inch. Left a small amount of lacing as it susided. Aroma was that of sweet malt, bread, and some alcohol. Tastes very sweet and a little biscuity with some hops in the finish. Mouhfeel is medium. Drinkibility is okay but may be to sweet to drink very many. Very good beer overall."
"Overall I would highly recommend trying this beer if you see it around, it's a unique experience and deserves a chance on your taste buds. Another hurrah for New England beer!"
"A vast complex medal meriting winter warmer, without over-the-top ABV. Mint and clove and peppercorn and mellowed with a year of ageing. Medium mouthfeel and smooth for its style. A little roasting and hops here.Decent smooth though sparkling medium mouthfeel."
"pours a reddish ruby color with a small brownish head. the smell isn't very strong, and is one of this beers only downfalls. what little smell is pretty much some sweet malty hints... the taste is very sweet and very malty, little or not hop presence. the mouthfeel and drinkability are both good and so is the beer, its a decent beer."
"I was completely surprised by this beer. I was expecting a run-of-the-road beer, but this was exceptional."
"D - The best offering I've had from Shipyard to date. This is a complexy and very good beer. This should be a year-round brew."
"Worth a try."
"Delicious warmer, one I wish I had more of. I won't miss winter, but I sure will miss the slew of delicious warmers I tried this winter. Prelude will make it into the rotation as soon as I get more of it."
"My first time with Prelude, found at local Hannaford Market. Pours a dark clear brown color, little bit of head that fades quickly. Smells of malt and some kind of christmas popurri. Tastes quite sweet with spices, buttery, a bit of citrus and back to the popurri again, kind of odd. Average mouthfeel, fizzy. Overall not that impressed, the flavors don't do it for me. It's not horrible but not something that I can really enjoy. Shipyard can do better."
"Bought this as a Winter sampler pack from Cost Plus World Market so it's the only one I've got. I will seek it out again, though."
"The Prelude is a very nice winter warmer, far better than most of its New England peers. Another winter season score for Shipyard."
"This is the first winter warmer style beer I've had, so there's not much I can compare it to. Overall, it was a fairly drinkable beer, though it never really grabbed me."
"Drinkability is so so. Not a bad beer, but not all that interesting either. I'll definitely drink it with no problem, but I wouldn't seek this one out."
"Notes: I can't get past the metallic twinge. Pass."
"I liked a few others this season above Prelude, but I had heard good things about years past, so I will try it again next year, or see how it is with a little age."
"Pours a clear brown with a creme head that falls quickly to leave a thin film on the top of me brew. Nie sweet and woody kind of nose. Flavor is tangy at first. Smooths out nicely as time goes on. Nice mellow sweet tones with a malty edge that is noticed, but not the dominant feature here. Mouthfeel is a bit thicker and slick on the liquid and the carbonation is nice, but low. Overall I found this a really easy to drink winter warmer. If you are looking for a nice example of the style, I highly suggest this one. I kind of forgot about reviewing it for a while as I just enjoyed sip after sip."
"M/D: Medium bodied, carbonation is too high. Drinkability is a little low just because this is a pretty hardy beer, but it seems to a slight change of pace from most winter warmers. I could see sitting on a few of these to until next winter to see if the taste has balanced out a little."
"Poured into Stone RIS glass. Beautiful opaque chesnut amber hue with 1 finger of almond head. Slight toffee aroma, very Bass Ale smelling. Taste of dried cherries, and Bass Ale. Hate to keep typing that, but that is all I am getting. Sweet molassas malt flavor, good carbonation with a touch of hops. Not bad"
"Drinkability: This could be the best winter warmer I've ever had. It's probably my least favorite style. I wish the taste could keep up with the intrigue that the aroma created. I expected something to be truly smooth and buttery the whole way. Hops and alcohol put that notion to bed. Overall, a decent beer."
"Don't drink and review."
"Black with a strong, creamy half-inch, off-white head... coffee and malt hops balanced well... medium presence, with some roasted caramel... medium, creamy body that settles on the back of the tongue--smooth...hops abound--bitter but soft in its strength...as a Christmas celebratory, not bad--alcohol is slightly present and warms as the glass expires..."
"A pretty smooth beer, a bit buttery in the mouth. Carbonation seems off, a little too much, but doesn't interrupt the flavor, if anything helps the spice. The alcohol is well hidden considering this is a more subtle winter warmer that doesn't hit you with too much spice."
"A very pleasant surprise."
"I immediately thought that this one wasn't for everyone. In fact I didn't care for my first few sips. However, as it warms and you get used to the character it's a pretty decent beer. There is a pleasant earthy quality about it. The spices are harsh at first, but then as you drink they fade into the background. I want to compare it to an english style beer but it is too aggressive for that. Certainly worth a try. The complexity of this one will grow on you."
"Pours a beautiful ruby-red chestnut color with an impressive frothy head that lingered for a bit... Shipyard's fall offering of Pumpkinhead Ale was my favorite pumpkin beer all season, so I had high hopes for their winter warmer and wasn't in the least dissapointed... one of the best winter brews I've tried... Smell is of roasted malts, caramel, cinnamon, and sweets... the taste strongly complements the aroma, bursting with an uncanny flavor that borders on magnificent... really glad I decided to try this beer... nice warming alcohol glow accompanies a sweet caramel taste that sticks to the palate... mouthfeel is great and the brew goes down real smooth for a winter warmer... another awesome selection from a great brewery... Definitely recommended..."
"Overall a tasty and clean winter warmer. Impressive ABV does the trick without presenting any alcohol warmth."
"The drinkability is great for a winter warmer, very high in alcohol, but doesn't taste it, like some do."
"pours a reddish brown with nice off white creamy head. medium size bubbles with very little lacing. Head subsided shortly after 2nd quaff. Smells of toasted malt and fruit like sweet, can smell the alcohol but not over bearing. First taste is slight bittering, roasty caramel then finishing faint melon and pineapple. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with just enough carbonation. Very drinkable beer as we have found it to be a good session beer."
" This was a pretty average offering in most aspects. I really didn't get much at all as far as the nose and as far as taste the only thing I could detect was roasted malts. The alchohol was present but not overly done. This one could use a touch of personality."
"The taste was mostly of mildly bitter hops and very little roasted malts. Not a really impressive ale, but, nice enough for company when they come over for christmas cheer!"
"Pours a ruby-reddish color with a thin head. Aroma is mostly malty and a bit sweet with spices. Taste is somewhat bitter upfront like a pale ale and there's not much spice or anything else showing through. Kind of rough around the edges as well. As it warms up a bit, it softens somewhat. However, I just don't think I could drink another bottle of this beer. I've had better winter warmers."
"Overall this beer does what a winter warmer should do (in my opinion, anyway): give you an overall warm, toasty feeling, make you feel festive, and taste like a Christmas cookie in a bottle."
"Overall, a tasty, easy drinking winter warmer."
"D- I could drink a few of these, but I would imagine that repeated drinking would leave me with a full belly."
"D: A fair Winter Warmer, but there are better choices out there for me, so this isn't something I'll probably go back to. I like the Victorian era New England scene on the bottle though."
"D: Very drinkable, able to drink nice and smoothly."
"Decent mouthfeel. I like this one a lot. Great Holiday beer!!!"
"Poured a brown/ruby hew into my sam a pint glass. Moderate head which subsided slowly. Nice toasty roasty notes in the bouquet, dark rolly large malty with a slightly hop bitter finish in the pull. Rather nice beer. Fluffy is a good word for it. Not my favorite winter beer in august but close."
"Overall: A good one for sitting around on a cold winter night, I enjoyed mine in the middle of the Florida summer, and it was refreshing and pleasant. Definitely worth a try."
"New England winter classic. Like a stronger more concentrated version of Old Thumper. Tastes like banana's foster with the banana, caramel and alcohol aromas and flavors. The hops in this brew tame the diacetyl flavors to a better balance than in any of Shipyards other brews. A winter-time caramel cordial. Drinkability is high for the 7.5%abv."
"Tasted: 04/09/07"
"DA: Easy to drink, good for the style."
"Taste was a great example of a quality winter beer; big malty character, spices (corriander and cloves), slight hop bitterness (though never to the point of distraction), and a sweet, somewhat warming alcoholic finish. Mouthfeel was medium and crisp. This really is a great winter beer, and you can tell it was brewed in a place where they know about cold winters. Check it out."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, nice kick, not as filling as most beers in the style, I would pick this beer over most others in the style, particularly if I’m not going for the heavy sweetness that most beers in this style typically have. I wasn’t expecting a lot from this beer, but it was a little bit different and it was pretty decent."
"Poured a light translucent brown with a minimal head which quickly faed leaving behind a decent lace. Smell was candy sweet, lots of grain and malty grass hints with an overlay of candy apple. Nice well rounded smell. The taste was suprisingly hoppy and well formed. Very nice malt presence, lots of spices and a touch of bread. But the hoppy ness grabbed you in the beginning and left a nice linger. Big sweet caramel and candied flavors as well. Nice and smooth, good quality session. Overall I don't know if I would consider this really a winter beer, but it was very nice. Actually quite pleased by it and would definaly have another. Quality ale."
"Always a nice winter treat and worth the trip from NY to a NE state to get."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. A nice dark golden amber with a thick foamy head. The head hung around for a while, and clung to the sides of the glass during the entire pint. Aroma was slightly sweet with a hint of bitterness. Tasted sweet, maybe butterscotch or caramel, but not sickly sweet. A hint of hops on the backend of it. A little to bubbly in the mouth to completely enjoy, but otherwise a great winter beer. Put a warmth in my cheeks."
"Thanks to BA mtanji for sharing."
"Pours a nice dark red with great clarity. Smalloff white head that retains well. Smells like delicious butterscotch and malt at first but then comes at you with a whole bunch of awesome fruit esters. Wow, apples, pears, prunes even? Very unique, very complex, you could get lost here before even tasting it. Tastes almost like it smells too. Great sweet malt flavor thats well balanced with some fruity hop flavors. I want to say I detected a slight trace of white grapes in this flavor as well. It also has a bit of an alcohol warming effect thats quite nice in this bitter cold. This is one of the few winter warmers I've had, and if there are others that are anything like this, I will have to make it a point to seek them out. This is just delicious."
"Pours a perfectly clear, dark reddish-brown with a big tan head. Aroma is a little fruity with a hint of alcohol. The taste becomes softer and more rounded as it warms. Its slightly sweet at first but then turns bitter with a little alcoholic finish. The alcohol provides a nice warming effect. Mouthfeel is quite smooth. Drinkability is good but I wouldn't go beyond a couple of these. Overall, a nice beer to have on a cold winter night."
"Beer poured an amber color with a nice well sustained off white head. Nose is of somewhat nutty with a hint of citrus and spices. Taste is of sweet caramel malts, hint of nuts, and bittering hops. It is like an amber ale with extra malts and extra bittering hops. Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth on the palate which leads to easy sippin'. Drinkabilty is very good. There is an ever so slight hint of alcohol which fits the style to a tee! This is another nice effort by this brewery!"
"It pours a copper brown color w/ a NICE fluffy head. I waited a moment for the head to tone down and took a deep breath. Ahh, spicy with buttery caramel... Let's taste.. Better than it smells and very spicy. I like it. You can taste the sweetness but the spice is really good, not like your typical winter or even pumpkin ale where the spice takes over though. The sweetness is involved in the aftertaste. Drink laces the glass significantly. Very nice. I wish it wasn't a seasonal."
"I had never tried a Shipyard product. This is the best winter warmer I've had in sometime. Definitely pick some up if you can. I look forward to trying their Blue Fin Stout that also came this month."
"22oz. bottle: This one pours a fairly clear, reddish brown color. There is a bit of an off-white head that drops off rather quickly. The aroma is nice, with mainly floral and spicy notes. A hint of the malts come through also. The taste is quite good also. A bit of nuttiness up front, with some of the spices in the background. A bit of a dry bitterness to the finish. A very good winter beer."
"to give a try."
"big beer tho, effectiveness-wise."
"Second in a row Shipyard Winter beer of the night... Translucent dark copper body with a finger of offwhite head. Diacetyl dominates the aroma with just hints of hops, alcohol, and malt. Roasty or toasty flavor. Not quite as roasty as a porter, but not that far off. Diacetyl is also a big player in the flavor, but does not overwealm the roastiness, but rather enhances. Hints of alcohol are also present. On the heavier side of medium-bodied. A very solid, very tasty brew. I'd definitely get this one again."
"This is one of the milder Winter Warmers I've tried. They seem to be rather spicy or just hint at it. I did enjoy it. I could see it pairing well with some crisp, spiced foods or a very strong cheese. Give it a shot before the thaw. I will be looking for another helping before then."
"Prelude ends up being a reasonable offering from the Maine Brewery and yes, the bitterness does go away as the beer warms. Goes well will white meets and their gravy's. I'd imagine it compliments stuffing nicely as well. Only downside is that I get a bit of mixed bag within the 6 pack. Some of the bottles were on the blander side and others were quite sharp and biting. I've purchased this beer several times now and this variance continues. Don't let that discourage you as it is a very good beer in the correct situation."
"Beer is a bit unbalanced but quite tasty. Too many bittering hops and not enough floral. I would have prefered more hop nose to balance the aftertaste, or less bittering hops to balance the sweet nose. Bit too thin for my tastes. But I do love winter beers and cherish any experience I can have with one I've never encountered. Its a cold weather beer, it fits the style well."
"Mildly chewy and a wee bit over-bubbley mouthfeel, it's medium-heavy in body. Easy to drink, yet quite potent...a great winter brew !"
"D - Good to retry, it reminds me of a recipe I make every couple of years. Goes down easy."
"Pours a nice orange, almost red with a thick almost tan head. I got a mouthfull of foam on my first sip, and its a good hoppy taste. Hoppy to the taste, not completely overpowering which is good, the malt helps to balance this out. This is pretty good, I like this better than a couple other offerings I've sampled by this brewer. I like it, definitely worth a try, probably should be getting harder to find by now, but my local shop still had a good amount."
"The beer has a medium full body and a finish that has a lingering, lightly-astringent bitterness. The diacetyl is definitely noticeable in the flavor as well, but at least it is subdued enough that it is not obnoxious to this diacetyl sensitive person. The diacetyl actually accentuates the fruitiness in this beer; I get notes of fig, some date-like notes and a soft berry note towards the end. This beer is quite malty; lots of toffee, a caramel note and some dry toasted notes. This is definitely a nice winter warmer, it is rich and satisfying with an interesting mix of flavors. Yes even the subtle diacetyl adds to the complexity of this brew, though I could wish there was a bit more character here (though hold the diacetyl in check please)."
"This pours a dark reddish color with a large foamy head.This is really a good looking beer except that the head disappears quickly.The smell is faint to me.I could only sniff out a slight malt scent,nothing great.The taste is a very good mix of sweet maltness,hops,and holiday spices.The m/f is medium and the flavors mix very well.All in all,this is one of the more drinkable holiday beers I've tried.This is one beer that I'll look forward too."
"Pours a clear, dark reddish brown color with a small head. Aroma consists of sweet caramel malts and a hint of candied fruits. The taste starts out with the same caramel malt flavor that is present in the aroma along with subtle candied fruit flavors. Pretty decent beer, good for warming up your gut on those cold nights."
"A smooth drinking and flavorful winter ale. Where the hell is the 7.5% abv? The best Shipyard brew I can remember having."
"I also didn't know it was 7.5% ABV until a local pub told me I had to have a smaller serving because of the alcohol content. Tou'd never tell by it's taste."
"Notes: I am something glad I picked up this one wow what a brew. Lace lines the glass from start to finish. Simply one of the best winter brews out there Shipyard produced a well crafted beer. Cheers."
"Loose, how much wood could a woodchuck chuck, head to start with some prevalent stick and lace. Metal copper hue that is nicely clear with very little action, just some light floaters. Fungal fling of chewy choke on nose; some cool smokiness, and a fairly good hop presence. To mouth, as usual, buttery aspects along with some sharp fangs of creamsicle, chocolate flavor. Eh, good enough but would move on to something else with no reservations."
"Pretty good, perhaps one of the better offerings from Shipyard. Does a good trick on a cold winter's night."
"The mouthfeel was full-bodied, not too heavy, and very fitting, matching the bitter qualities and not loaded down with maltiness. I would definitely get this again if I found it again."
"Dark tea color, a thin beige head rises up slightly and disappears quickly. Aroma is rich malt, a little sweet, some fruit, cinnamon and cotton candy. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, a little tingly, perhaps a tad overcarbonated. Flavor is initially pungent with alcohol overpowering other flavors, a little stringent, but malt and plum emerge, as do sharp cinnamon and orange peel. Gets richer as it warms, but a little sweet, sort of syrupy and chewy. Spruce tips emerge, as do clove and frankensense, rounding out the holiday flavors."
"Its mouthfeel was fullfilling, yet left me yearning for more. Bravo, Shipyard. I'm taking a vacation in Maine next year just to visit you!"
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite/tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a warm and malty scent that boasts of pale, crystal, chocolate malts, and roasted barley. The hops help balance the aroma. The taste is excellent. It has a creamy malt flavor that boasts of chocolate and crystal malts. It goes down easy and finishes smooth and slightly warm. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great winter warmer. It is quite complex and full of flavor; a kick ass seasonal."
"Casked, it's bit thinner than I remember from the bottles. Enjoyable nonetheless, with a pleasant roasty maltiness and an earthy, natural tone to the overall feel. Not my most favorite winter brew, but it's a treat to have a casked pint."
"Served from a 22oz bomber acquired shortly before Christmas. Pours into the glass a very dark amber topped with short lived off white foam. Aroma is mostly malty and sweet with a bit of rotting fruit. Taste is very malty and caramelized, with just a bit of spice and hints of raisin and cherry. Finally some hop bite comes in to save the day towards the end and finishes with a nice bitterness. moderate carbonation, quite full body. Maybe a prelude, but not the main course for me."
"Pours with a two-fingered off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Light - medium carbonation. Deep clear amber color. Nose is soapy??. Starts with hops and malts; finishes with a hoppy/soapy overtone. Medium bodied. The ABV is currently 6.8%. $2.89 for a 22oz bottle."
"Pretty drinkable holiday brew but nothing spectacular. Solid."
"opened the bomber while dressing for a christmas party. Poured a nice brown/amber with a decent , rocky head. The head stayed fro the whole time with attractive lacing during consumption. the nose was nothing to speak of, mild nutty and spice notes with a hint of sweet roasted malts. The mouthfeel was ale-like, nothing too high ABV or overly spiced. The beer finished well after swallowing with a nice dry hop aroma / mouthfeel and good spicey and nutty flavors that lingered after each mouthful. Overall this was a decent holiday ale that neither dissapointed, nor exhilerated."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a tan head. Tastes sweet from the malt, but not too sweet. A touch of buttery and chewey help out the sweetness. Hops are sharp and to the point of balance. The strength is almost fully hidden. The best Shipyard beer I've had so far."
"Very glad to have the chance to taste one of these, and for the honor I thank Mr. Rabidawg!"
"The taste is somewhat unremarkable. A little bit of caramel malt with some of that ever-repetitive Shipyard diacetyl. Not a unique brew by any stretch. The malts give way to a weak hop finish. I’m just a little bit disappointed that this tastes like a lot of other Shipyard beers."
"Nice mahogany color...head that dissipated quickly. Definite winter warmer. Malty aroma with a definite hop accent. Initial malt sweetness ended in a beautiful hop presence at the end. Mouthfeel was light for the high abv. Drinkable, but don't guzzle!"
"Havent had it in bottle since last year so I will have to grab some in bottle form to. Another great beer by Shipyard!"
"Presented in a 22oz. bomber. Poured a deep, glowing ruby color with a medium off white head with medium retention. Aroma is of sweet sticky candy, not very strong but I assume it will grow while it warms. Despite the sweet smell the flavor was surprisingly not oversweet at all. Very nicely balanced, with barley malts on the forefront, finishing with a piney hop bite, and a little extra spiciness throughout. Mouthfeel has moderate carbonation and is medium-heavy in body. Excellent ale for the winter, very warming and definetely very drinkable!"
"Thanks StevieW for this topnotch brew!"
"A Northeastern charmer sent over by Bierman9! Yummy winter warmer as a prelude into spring. A dark amber brew with a very bubbly head, and lots of red highlights make for a delicious look. The aroma is a bit mellow, some caramel malt and a little roast and spicy hops in the backround. This is a full bodied beer with a nice roasty/nutty finish. It has a nice malt sweetness with some spicy hop flavor that builds as it comes to room temp. At the half way point it has a nice mellow bitter finish to balance the sweetness. An easy drinking big beer that fits the local weather scene."
"This ale poured a slightly hazy, dark, copper-red color with good, slightly off-white foam that did not leave much lace. The smell was modest but good: sweet caramel malt aroma. The taste was sweet: some caramel malt overtones on top of a candy sugar taste. There were also hints of oak and floral hops, and the sweetness lingered on the tongue. The mouthfeel was smooth and relatively clean (other than the sweetness). The body was medium. This was a very drinkable and enjoyable ale."
" Served warmer this brew seems to come alive. A bolder malt profile and the spicy hoppiness lead into the warming alcohol feel very nicely. I found this very drinkable in the 12oz. bottles but i would love to try a bomber or from draft even sometime."

"Thanks to StevieW for helping me get some of this fine brew."
"Special thanks to pbrian for sending this one my way."
"Drinkability: While it's not a bad brew, this one could definitely use some work, as everything seems all out of wack. I'm gonna have to struggle a bit to finish this one..."
"Pours clear brown-copper color, has an average white lasting head, light malty caremel, nutty aroma. Malty flavors of candy caremel and nuts, has some strange off flavors, mabye a bit unbalanced, light body, with the hops noticable in the finish, not all that great, some doesn't seem right."
"Poured a soapy looking head with minimal white lace.The color was a dark red.The smell is very acidic and malty with a floral hop hint.The taste is extremely malty with a roasted finish.Alcohol is noticed immediately and all throughout the mouthfeel which makes it kind of harsh.Nothing really stands out as far as the taste is concerned.Leaves a dry feeling on the pallate.A touch of cherries is noted on the finish.Not really impressed here.Very average and boring.Needs some work to make me buy this again."
"Reddish-brown in color with a small off-white head that didn't last long. The smell is a nice balance of hops and malt. The taste is similar in terms of balance but a bit more complex. The hops take over a bit in the end for a nice bite. It reminds me a lot of Youngs Old Nick Barley Wine Style Ale but better. This beer would do well with a bit more ageing."
"Dry grainy head, made fizzy noises but lasted. The body is the color of cherry stain or medium-dark sweet tea. Toasty malt aroma some unidentifiable funkiness. The flavor incorporates the caramel and toasty malt flavors with this unusual flavor that reminds me of Sweetwater Festive Ale. I had attributed the flavor to mace, which is one of the spices in Festive Ale, but I'm not so sure this one is spiced. Maybe it's the butterscotch flavor of the infamous Ringwood yeast, but I didn't know Sweetwater used that yeast for Festive Ale so I'm confused. There's a bit of slighty citric hops underneath all this that breaks up the malt-funk party a bit."
"A deep mahogany body with soft ruby highlights is capped by a firm light tan head that holds quite well and leaves some nice lace. When served only lightly chilled, it will maintain a solid head as it warms. The aroma is of a sweet caramel & light chocolate malt, some mild spice, and butterscotch-like diacetyl that actually adds greatly to the character! Reminiscent of a rich holiday cake! Very nice. The body is full with a very fine and restrained carbonation that leaves it exceptionally creamy and smooth - almost syrupy as the carbonation breakout foams up under the warmth of the mouth. The flavor is rich with some limited ripe fruit upfront, coat-tailed by a biscuity maltiness that's slathered at first in caramel - and later in soft milk chocolate, a mild spiciness as it crosses that palate and then a firm butterscotch, some mineral-like & leafy hoppiness and an underlying bitterness in the finish. Long, lingering and almost as rich as the flavor itself - the aftertaste is massively impressive with swirling notes of caramel, butterscotch, drying bitterness and leafy hoppiness! Do yourself a favor and enjoy this at cellar temperature as a dessert beer. Fantastic! Absolutely worth seeking out as a special treat to be enjoyed with a good book in front of the hearth."
"I did go home warm."

"Smoky sweet malt aroma, inviting and reminiscent of the winter season. All the flavors hit at once then divide and conquer the taste buds. Initial sharp sweetness with bitter spiciness. Could use a bit of mellowing to meld the flavors more. The malt is HUGE all the way through with a light buttery finish."
"After Hampshire Ale, my favorite seasonal. I only drink it in the 22oz bottle, I think the six pack loses some of the taste. Nice deep amber color, sweet taste, the perfect ""fire side"" beer. Each sip puts me in the Christmas mood, as I almost feel the snowdrops melting on my face. Maybe it's the ABV, but this is just a great winter beer."
"Very drinkable but watch out for the high ABV, this is a great beer."
"Notes: Lots of great winter ales to come from the NE ... this one surely sits somewhere on the best of the best list."
"This beer really showcases the Ringwood yeast characteristics.  Butterscotch aroma(along with hints of molassas), and buttery malty flavor have been mentioned more than once and blend beautifully with the bitter finsh.  Great beer.  I think a few months aging will do it some justice."
"Yummy..."
