review_text
"Not as syrupy sweet or hyper-spiced as most winter warmers.  The malty Carmel taste is refreshing at first, with a slightly bitter, hoppy finish.  This one has a mild skunk at the end, probably because it almost Easter and a bit late for a winter warmer.  Of course the high today was in the mid- 20's and this is warming me up nicely."
""
"Very well balanced ! Normally I like my winter warmers to be a little sweeter. But with this one I don't mind.   Just the right mix of flavors .(If it was sweeter it might ruin that mix). Perfect for the thanksgiving meal every year."
""
""
"Pours a two finger light brown, foamy head, with good retention and some spots of sticky lacing. Mahogany and slightly cloudy. Smells like candied dates and raisins. Taste is what I expect from the aroma, with a bittering finish. Lingering sensation of dark, dried fruits, as well as some plum. Feel is on thicker side and low carbonation. Light chewiness and somewhat viscous. A fun winter style beer and a good buy for the price."
"Taste is molasses, caramelly, dark and sweet chocolate with slight barky hops.  This makes for a nice bock like beer.  A good winter warmer, although there are others in the style that I prefer."
""
"Ruby red in the light. Thin lacing of head. Great color. Hint of tobacco, light nose overall, backbone of solid malts. Warm spicy and nicely blended. A bit of bright hop bitterness on the end . Some alcohol. Some murk in essence overall, but good residual carryover of spice and hint of yeast. Overall nice. Love some Deschutes, maybe earlier in the season next time?"
"2/28 - Bottle.  Nice reddish brown pour with good body. Not a strong smell, but malt and spices were noticeable.  Nice pour and a very good taste of herbs and orange. Felt good going down and had a decent kick. Overall very good beer and I'll be seeking this out down the road."
""
"Finally! I feel like I can really call myself a beer lover now. I've tried one of Deschutes original beers. 2014 was silky smooth, hints of chicory and cherry, rounded by a huge malt finish. A hint of citrus zest but all together a great winter warmer. Warmed me right up! Do you expect anything less from Deshutes though? They're the best. A very good beer!"

"Overall: All the parts fit together well. Full of flavor, not just spices. I wouldn't limit it to just Winter."
""
""
""
""

"Malt, a little caramel, no hops bitterness. Moderate carbonation and mouthfeel.  It all blends together well, though.  Good winter beer."

"This is a quality holiday beer, never too sweet, but still complex in terms of spice flavor."
""
""
"O â€“ Very interesting, comparable to Belgian quad in aroma and flavor but with lower alcohol and a more dry, carbonic bite.  A lot to like here."
""
"Overall, this is a light, flavorful brew that would be perfect for fall sessioning--a pleasant surprise."
""
"Had this beer from a nitro tap.  I haven't had that many nitro beers before, but this one was surprisingly very good.   It is worth a shot."
"Nice hoppy winter warmer.  Not really my style, but a fine example of this variety."
""
""
""
""
"A little bit too toasty,smokey for my taste. Probably a great beer for someone else, but not my style."
""
"Good winter offering but there are a lot of good ones out there."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear garnet amber with large offwhite head. Good carbonation. Initial nose has some gentle spices: clove, pepper, brown sugar. Underlying malt smells of some light chocolate. As it warms, the chocolate & caramel aromas really shine through and come to he forefront. Tastes of sweet caramel malts with some chocolate & cocoa. Upfront spiciness - not sure from hops or actual spices. Medium high bitterness. Feels medium full to full with no hot alcohols. Overall, a nice malty beer for the cold winter nights. Subtle spiciness lends some complexity but doesn't distract. Very solid winter ale overall. Great to pair with dark chocolates."
"Poured from a bottle into pint glass. Nice color and healthy head. Malts on the nose with a light but crisp hop finish. The flavors hang out on your tongue for a bit after too. Very nicely done!"
""
"Beautiful mahogany color...thick light tan head...brilliant appearance.  The smell is of malt, with a little spice.   Bitter taste, with some warmth.  Lots of dark malt flavors...warming.  Full in body.  Great winter beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark red, almost to brown color. Thin off white head with a small amount of lacing. The nose is English toffee and light clove. The spices here complement rather than overwhelm the palate. Definitely a complex winter seasonal - enough boozy heat and spice to make this a winter warmer but with plenty of other layers that allow for more balance and other pieces to fall into place. The toffee notes add a sweetness and brevity across the dark maltiness."
"One of many just OK Winter Ales. A little more hop than others, light spice some molasses."
"Kinda plain wanted some more flavor but ok overall!"
""
"Slight molasses aftertaste, otherwise pleasant winter brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wow. This is good. I've had this in bottles and on nitro-tap. Really tasty either way. Malty with enough hop presence to add some complexity. Terrific winter brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"Not very impressed as a winter warmer. Not very warming at 5%. Was served on nitro which aided mouthfeel but not anything special"
""

"O - A great Christmas time beer. Pleasantly warming without cloying spices or flavors. Would go great with Christmas ham."
""
""
""
"Overall - a nice holiday brew that warms on a cold night and at a great price!"
""
""
"O- Very wintry and robust.  One and done, but very flavorful for the holidays. Drank on its own, but I could see it as a great food pairing for a rich Christmas dinner."
""
""
""
""
""
"Descent flavor but a little over hopped and over spiced."
"An interesting winter hoppy ale"
""
"This was a decent beer, but a lot closer to a regular IPA than to a winter seasonal.  The 60 IBUs make it hoppier than most Christmas beers, and I didn't get a lot of the traditional mix of nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. that most others in the style have.  So yeah, it's ok, but not really a great example of a holiday beer.  I prefer other Deschutes beers to this one."
""
""
"O. An above average holiday beer. Not too heavy and not too light. Nice to have to sit around by the fire and chat with the family."
""
""
"Excellent holiday ale - not too much of the usual nutmeg, etc.  A pretty unique holiday ale that tastes very good."
""
""
""
"O. One of my favorite winter warmers.  Great taste of all mentioned but nothing dominent. At 6.7 not quite sessionable but would really enjoy having a few of these in a row.  Bring em on!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I say this was a good winter warmer I'd come back to."
""
""
"Tried it on a cold, boring night when I was itching for a winter ale. Half of it still went down the drain."
"Pours a very deep reddish-brown in color with almost a 1-finger beige creamy head that settles back down after a while. A decent amount of sticking lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of roasted malts, some dark fruit and spices for the most part. Bit more going on with the taste as there is some semi-sweet chocolate and pine in the mix as well. Does have a bitter finish that lasted a little to long for my liking though. Other than that the taste was decent. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I use the word ""balanced"" a lot in this review but don't take this as meaning bland.  There are bold but balanced flavors.  Basically, if you are in the mood for something like Stone's Oaked Arrogant Bastard but favor a bit of holiday cheer stirred in; this is the beer for you.  I'll have this again; and it doesn't have to be just at the Winter holidays."

"A solid effort with lots of different aromas and flavors blending well together."
""
""

""
"Malty ale with a full pallate of flavors, cinnamon, netnug, licorice candy, with a hoppy backbone."
"Nice brown amber color with a decent light tan head. Nice aromas of malt, orange, little berries, cinnamon, and nuts.  Taste has nice blend of malt, toffee, orange, lemon, nuts, spices and hint of chocolate. Not a huge fan of this style, but this was an enjoyable one."
""
""
"O:  this is a true winter warmer - with some West Coast flair, of course - one of the few US takes on the style that manages to have bold elements of both the malts of an English WW and the hops of an American pale ale... not sure I would dive into another bottle of this, though - maybe if they eased back a touch on the hop charge - too much static"

"This beer is great. I'm glad I took notes and really soaked this beer in. It's an easy-to-find winter pleaser that along with Celebration belongs in my fridge for a solid three months."
"I should have tried a sixer before barreling-up.  Pleased with the deep opaque poor and two fingers of tight pleated khakis at the helm.  Malty richness with a bit of toastiness, but finishes a bit bitter for my taste.  Worse yet, and maybe I'm alone, but this one is a head-throbber.  About thirty minutes after seeing the bottom of my glass, I am met with a dull headache."

"Deschutes has been new to our market this year and I've been quite pleased with all of their offering, so I'm eager to try this holiday offering...  Less than a finger's worth of rich fluffy densely packed froth that is khaki in color with a slight reddish hue...  Decent retention gives way to a full film of lacing of much the same...  The color is a slightly murky light to medium brown...  A slight bit of moderate paced carbonation throughout...  The nose is comprised of light maraschino cherries, light caramel, cinnamon, and a light woody character...  It's a unique but pleasing combination...  Starts mellow and slightly sweet as the nose alluded to...  Next comes a prominent earthy character... Finally, there is a light charred character that rises on the finish...  Medium bodied...  Crisp...  Some sharp carbonation...  Finishes a touch dry with a bit of chalkiness...  A decent Winter Warmer all the way around...  Not my favorite Deschutes offering...  It may take a few more to truly experience this one as intended, but I'm confident I'll get there..."

"Final score: 3.94"
""
"Smooth bitterness. Taste is full, but not heavy. It would go well with a fire on a snowy evening. Has a great aroma, a lot of character. It doesn't have any staying power, no taste sitting in your mouth, but the immediate reaction is cozy. It isn't going for too much, not over the top, very comforting."

"Bottle, best by 3/16/15. Pours a dark amber color with a light tan head. Aroma is raisin with slight banana, some mild fruit and caramel/molasses. Taste is sweet and malty, not much spice that I could make out, maybe towards the end with the slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is skickey and slightly thick, lots of residual sugars. Overall a decent beer, not in my wheelhouse, would like more spice, less malt/sugar."

"Like all Deschutes offerings, Jubelale is a more mainstream-minded one that still has more than what it takes to stand up on its own. Provenance may ensure this brewery's commonplace and mass-produced brands are still revered, but truth be told they haven't compromised an ounce and are as deserving of love now as ever before. Jubelale is a great holiday tipple!"

"Overall - I've been impressed by every Deschutes product I've ever tried, and what an impressive winter warmer they've brewed. So many nice flavors here, and they are all complimentary forming the perfect holiday brew. Flavors and sweetness are perfect, and at 6.7% you may be able to enjoy a few without being the guy wearing the lamp shade in the corner - highly recommend."
""
""
"I don't see the fuss about this winter warmer its a mash of leather, bitter roots, and mild oaky twang. Defiantly not good in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Note:  wife hates it."
"I'm just not real sold on this offering from Deschutes. I feel it's somewhat lacking the characteristics that make a good holiday ale/winter warmer. As an avid IPA fan, I do enjoy the bitterness."

"  Overall a very well deserved 4.75 for Jubelale - Deschutes Brewery. This is a delicious choice and I advise you to give it a go."
""
""
""
""
"Deep brown to amber in color with an inch thick of khaki colored head.  Brussels lacing.  I smell caramel malt and not much else.  The flavor is plenty of caramel malt with a spicy nutty taste.  The mouth is smooth and creamy."
""
"This is a solid winter brew. The craftsmanship is what sells this beer for me. The mouthfeel alone makes me want to drink this all day. It's along the lines of a bold brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good mouthful, bitter and strong tasting."
"It's damn near perfect. Looks great and smells delicious. This is the definitive winter warmer, strong and tasty, a little dark and spicy but not overwhelming. Under 7% so it's not a 1-bottle KO but not sessionable either. This is the right beer for the dark cold season. I think Deschutes is my favorite brewery. Everything they make is good to great. Support our troops."
""
"Overall - This beer just feels like the holidays: like liquid fruitcake spiked with a nice blast of hops. It's hard to get more festive than that! I have a feeling it would even be pretty nice 5-6 months from now as the hops fade a touch (my bottle was super fresh), letting the complex malts shine even more. This is easily one of my favorite holiday brews."
""
""
""
""
"O: A solid winter warmer of the brown ale variety. I'd personally have preferred something with more spice emphasis and less floral-pine influence, though I am an admitted malthead. The body seemed a touch on the light side for a winter beer, and I'd also have liked the malt to be less toasted bitter, to allow more sweetness in. Still, not a bad beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This isn't anything all that special, but it is a well made brew, and worth drinking. Don't refuse one if it is offered, but find something better for your guests."
""
""
""
""
"Ginger and toasted, nutty, caramelly malt dominate the aroma. Floral hops add a more beer-like quality. Flavor reveals deeply toasted caramel malt at the base, toasted enough to lend bitterness, along with notes of chocolate and specialty malt fruitiness. Bittering hops round out the flavor profile. More bitter than most winter warmers. The spices are fairly subtle, with just a hint of ginger surfacing. A welcome change of pace, though I wish it were a tad less bitter. There's a metallic character that surfaces."

""
""
""
"Overall a nice little warmer."

"This pours a medium brown color with a foamy, light brown head. The aroma is malty with a bit of spice. The flavor is very bold with malts and spice flavor. Fairly decent for the style of beer. It does leave a bit of a chalky after taste."

"Bottle best by 4/6/14. Dark ruby red pour with one-finger khaki head. Aroma is nice, sweet, nothing disagreeable -- reminscent of sweet orange. Taste is sweet & bitter up front -- more bitter than I expected. Citrusy, seemingly from yeast and hops. Bitterness in the finish, too. Mouthfeel is light-medium. Overall wanted this to be sweeter, but it's a nice beer of reasonable complexity."

"Overall, I'll try to put aside the oxidation as that was my fault not the beer's. nice candy malt profile, nice dried fruits and nuts, sweet candy notes without too much sweetness or syrupy feel, faint hint of baking spices I'm sure was a lot more when it was fresh, and even still a decent hop profile in there somehow. Not bad, still not that great compared to many of the other Deschutes beers, but still good."

"Thanks to Beer Revolution in Cowtown for bringing in some nifty Deschutes brews of late. The holiday seasonal from this brewery (or maybe its just a winter seasonal) is a dark reddish brown with a decent amount of tan foam. Aroma was a pleasant surprise, lemon-lime hops first (of all things) followed by a more expected sweet caramel malt. Dark and fruity at the same time. Tastes of treacle toffee, chocolate syrup, brown bread crust, green coffee beans, citrus rind, bubblegum, stone fruit, red berries ... A barrage of dark malt and sweet fruity flavors that co-exist in a tasty congress of the unexpected. Booze is detectable and becomes more so as one proceeds through a pint. Light-bodied and very smooth with middling carbonation, featuring a long roasted finish accented by medicinal hops and gooseberry notes. Really quite unique. How can toffee also taste zesty and refreshing? You can read in several reputable sources that dark malts and assertive hops typically mesh about as well as the Greeks and the Turks on Cyprus, but in all honesty I think this is a myth ... Done right, one gets some tasty results."

"I like this brew as a winter seasonal session ale. Loads to give as far as taste, and Above all others, this one sessions well for the style...."

"O: This beer is just one of many examples of why Deschutes is one of the best pacific coast breweries. It's exactly what I want out of a standard festive winter ale. Perhaps better than this is Jubel, which I have yet to try (waiting on The Abyss for a vertical)."

"Dark, raisin brown with a copper orange hue and a light haze. Started with a lush beige foam that slowly reduced to a thick cap that left sheets of sticky lacing on the glass. Sweet, sugary caramel malt aromas with Â hints of freshly milled grains, dark fruit and chocolate. Full bodied with rich, gentle carbonation. Rich, sweet, caramel malt flavors up front with slowly emerging, earthy hop bitterness through the middle. Hop flavors transition to light coffee flavors as the bitterness fades to chocolate notes at the end. Finishes with a light, earthy, bitterness and a hint of alcohol. Sweet and malty that is tempered nicely with lazy hop flavors through the middle."

"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass. Pours a ruby red, with a one inch off white sticky head, that leaves a wall of lace. Smell is all just hints of nutmeg, ginger bread, caramel, orange peel, pine tree, and cinnamon. Taste is as festive as the nose, balanced perfectly yum! Body is medium large for its abv, nice amount life, not really dry, and easy drinking. This is an excellent winter warmer, not over barring like some spiced up beers."

"Overall Impression - my go-to winter warmer since I was a baby beer geek, so I might be biased - BUT - I find this to consistently be one of the best winter craft beers I've ever had. The only flaw I detect this year is a hint of diacetyl in the aroma (not in the flavor, though). An excellent brew."

"Murky, hazy, reddish brown appearance, smells of raisins, molasses, prunes, some booziness detected. No discernible hops in the nose but big time hop bitterness in the flavor that is very unexpected. Cherries, sweet caramel and dates up front with big grapefruit pith bitterness in the back. Chocolate in the aftertaste along with that pithy, earthy bitter. A very interesting and not overly complex combination of flavors."

"This turned out to be a wonderful treat, to say the least! I poured this into a Stout glass. The head isn't super thick and just barely hangs around enough for you to finish the brew but the lacing isn't bad considering a real lack of head. The color might remind some of iced tea, but I think it's kind of nice considering the time of year its consumed. Some might say it appears like iced tea others along the lines of a single malt scotch, either way I like it. The scent is really nice. You get a layer of malt, caramel, spices, and hops but no one thing is overpowering. Now the mouth feel is just perfect! Kind of creamy but all very very pleasant and it all adds to incredible drinkability. The taste is full of flavor and it all seems to work in ""waves"". First thing you get is some malt, followed by some great floral spices maybe (cinnamon?) I even got very very very... subtle notes of chocolate. In the end you get a little ""baby punch"" of hops, which was kind of a pleasant surprise. Guys, this is not a ""hoppy"" beer but they come out in the end. All very very smooth and extremely pleasant. Anyone can enjoy this as it's subtle enough for a newbie, but complex enough for the beer snob. Deschutes hit this one out of the park!"

"I would never have guessed the IBUs were 60, great beer. Decent appearance, aroma and mouthfeel. Where this beer rocked it was in the taste. I wasn't looking to pair it with anything specific for my lunch but ate it with a roast beef hot dip sandwich served with Guinness au jus. Dang, the beer went well and I went through 2 pints. With or without a sandwich like this, I recommend it...on tap."

"Poured a deep brown with one finger tan head. It was very dark, and very appealing, quite nice to the eye. Scents of fruity esters, spiciness, citrus pith, some pine, slight funk, overripe fruit and some apricot sweetness. A good aroma, quite sweet and fruity, with a bit of a citrus hop aroma. Flavor is citrus pith and pine resin bitterness, balanced by banana, tropical fruit, a caramel malt backbone and fruity and overripe fruit flavors. It's quite sweet and fruity, but with enough West Coast hop bitterness to balance it. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, with moderate carbonation and a smooth creamy mouthfeel. Quite nice to drink. Overall this is a good beer. It's got a nice balance of sweet fruit and bitter hops to keep it from being cloying like many winter warmer and it has enough complexity to make it interesting."

"O- Overall this isn't bad. It's wonderful looking, and has a good taste. The bitterness in the finish is just a little more than I like."

"I get this every year - always a solid offering. Pours a reddish brown, clarified ale, with an ecru head. Smells very malty, jammy, and of dark, candied fruit; kind of like fruitcake, now that I think about it. Flavor brings a bit more choco-mocha to it along with dark fruit, and a little wine-like strawberry element. Mouthfeel is pretty solid, somewhere between medium and heavy bodied, but this isn't a huge beer. ABV comes in a bit below a 7, and for the style I think it should achieve at least a 7, but I'm not making the rules here. Overall, very good winter warmer, good representation of the style, and a good offering from Deschutes."

"Pours a nice deep red, with a thin coffee head. Smells of wood and smoke with a little hop to it. Tastes alright. Much more of a smoke flavor than i would like to see from what appears to be a red ale. Where's the hops? Kinda disappointed in the lack of hops in this one. Needs more coffee or caramel to balance with that intense smokey flavor. I do like the mouthfeel, nice. Bubbly and light. The finish again lacks with a fairly watery smoke flavor. Overall, probably my least favorite Deschutes beer that I've had. Shame really, now i guess I'll just have to drink Powder Hound or Sleigher all winter :)"

" The taste starts with dark dried cherry with a slight woody spice which is cinnamon-like with some woody hops blending in the taste and complimenting the mild caramel foundation with a light warmth of alcohol in the finish. Overall this is very easy to drink with a pretty great balance of flavors - malt, hops with a spice presence I found this to be one of the better winter ales I have tried this year."

"I found this to be a delicious beer even on an April evening. Almost has a stouty initial hit with some espresso and a bit of tartness. Poured with a creamy brown half inch head into a big pinot glass. A great cold weather beer that is light enough to drink all day."

"A garnet hued beauty hides gentle ruby highlights. A lovely two finger tan head that lasts and lasts. Seductive. Dark malt presence, but enough of a spicy hop on the edges to keep the aroma balanced. This beer just smells like winter. Broad malt profile that has hints of chocolate, a touch of tobacco, and coffee. Gentle hops on the crisp finish that makes me beg for more."
""
""
""
"This could be my go-to in the winter warmer category, despite it's mildness."

"Resins in the nose, a little hot and spicy, and some buckwheat. A hard flavor to leave behind you. Not my choice in the winter beer competition, but its austere lines may appeal to some in search of a less malty Christmas brew."

"Love this! Drinking 2012 batch, A favorite from the season. A wonderful and unique balance of roasted, toasty, and hoppy flavors. Delicious velvety bittersweet chocolate with a very subtle hint of coffee, then toffee and subtle caramel malt, touch of dark fruits, crisp hops! a hint of bubble gum in there. Finishes a little crisp hoppy and roasty, kind of bittersweet chocolate. Medium-bodied, crisp and full mouthfeel. A great winter session or night cap. Doesn't seem like much of a typical spiced Winter Warmer to me, but sure has a lot of great flavors that I want in a winter beer."

"Overall: A good, albeit simple example of a hoppy brown ale. High drinkabililty. Very reminiscent of Grand Teton's Bitch Creek. Almost too similar in the malt depart. Not too sure what about this other than it being seasonal makes this a ""Winter Warmer"" If you want something similar(and better executed) year round, definitely seek out the aforementioned Bitch Creek."

I am sure it is a great beer, obviously from the reviews, but I just didn't feel it. I will have to drink a couple more, but past experiences have shown me that only works occasionally."
""
""
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: A good winter ale. If you're looking for something that's not highly spiced, but still speaks ""winter""...this beer is for you. A nice change of pace within a style that sometimes gets a bit repetitive. Merry Christmas!"

"Pours dark amber with ruby-red highlights capped with a bone-white two finger head. Excellent retention with significant sticky lacing. Caramel, cherry, bouquet of fruit. Opens with caramel joined by varied fruit notes including dried apricot, a hint of fig, prune, and add accents of date. Apple and pearskin also present. A hint of bitter citrus cuts through, fairly dry finish with slight chocolate notes. Warming alcohol becomes more evident as the brew warms. The heavier side of medium-bodied, smooth, hint of syrup on the edges, moderate carbonation. One of my favorite winter warmers. Thankfully this one is now available in Chicago."
""
""
"Overall- Nothing too flashy, but that's not what I'm looking for in a winter warmer. Robust, flavorful, well executed, tasty. Very nice. Lots of things going on and they come together nicely. Absolutely worth picking up and I'll be sure to have another sixer before the winter's out."
"Deep brown to garnet red translucent body with a sisal foamy head. Smell is caramels and chocolates with a faint fig. Very inviting. Taste is bittersweet chocolate, caramel, malty bread, dried dark fruit, dates, plums, fig newtons, just a cusp of sweetness washes across the tongue on a medium body that holds together solidly crafted with a clean lightly bitter, lightly chocolate finish. I can't stop drinking this! Really good. No question this is a world class winter warmer."
"A decent winter warmer, the warming the least of the appreciable attributes, as the malt, hops, and grandfather's sweater essences hold the lion's share of character here. Good, and even better when I look past the glowing Christmas tree to the snowscape outside."

"Pour a clear, deep red bordering on brown with a finger of dense, creamy tan head. This smells more like a red, as I get mostly caramel with some savory spices. Hops are citrusy, slightly piney, and mild in intensity. Flavor is also mainly caramel with some burnt/bakers chocolate. There is some cinnamon or clove spiciness and piney hop bitterness on the back end. Bitterness is pretty significant. The feel is appropriate for the style, but I feel it's a little thicker than normal because of the nitro tap. Finish is mostly balanced but slightly dry. This is a nice winter warmer in the sense that I get some spices, but it's not crazy. Feels festive but it's not overbearing. Would like to try it on regular tap or bottle for comparison."

"A dark robust Christmas ale! Let the season begin folks. Scored this and was definitely a fan. Poured pretty dark and had a nice spicy twist to it.. Caramel malts on the nose. Drinks with a thick creaminess up front, quickly turning caramel hoppy bitter balance. It was a little hoppy for my liking but wth, still was a fan of the Schlafly Christmas Ale over this one I think...."

"Jubelale pours a hazy brown color with no head. There isn't much of an aroma, some spices, maybe some hints of cinnamon. The taste is nice and bold, lots of spices, good strong bold malty backbone, a nice hoppy bitter aftertaste. Good full flavors, rich taste. Overall a very nice winter warmer, must try."

"O- I'm a Deschutes disciple, but this one ought to be dismissed. I would prefer not to have another, too bad there are five more stashed in my cooler. I'll try and pair them with some holiday tamales and see if that heat balances these out somewhat..."
"overall, i wanted to try this as deschutes seems to have some really good products and i wanted to see what they produced for a 'winter ale'. at 6.7%, it serves a purpose for the cooler evenings. it's hearty enough for the stomach and it's mellow enough for the palate. almost stout-like... this is a very good brew. a cross between a brown ale and a stout, if you will.... each aspect was very good- straight 4.5's in my book. but i really liked the aroma i got from it..."

"Pours a beautiful robust copper with a rusty orange head. Thick, soft mouthfeel with medium to low carbonation and relaxing comfort in every sip. A mild but noticeable bitterness through and through, with mellow but well balanced hops in the background, and the kind of malty counterpoint you'd expect from a winter warmer. The alcohol is surprising here, for 6.7% one can barely taste it. Overall, a great session beer and even without spices, this beer represents the style well. Nothing too spectacular but not a beer that I would ever turn down. Another quality mark from Deschutes. Hope to see this on tap soon"
"O - This is a very nice winter ale. So glad Deschutes is in Missouri."
"M: Medium bodied."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this 25th Anniversary seasonal.... Deschutes did a wonderful job of putting together a well balanced beer with all the deliciousness of their seasonal ingredients.... Very impressed.... This could be one of the better seasonals of the year."

"Pours a deep red with thick reddish brown head that sits at around two fingers. Nose is super malty with caramel, cinnamon, clove, raisins, nutmeg, figs, some toffee, a bit of pine, some kind of doughy scents in there as well, molasses and brown sugar. The taste is similar with the spices more up front. Clove, figs, cinnamon, nutmeg, raisins, caramel, pine, toffee, dates and just a tinge of hop bitterness. It has a medium body with good carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. This is a pretty excellent winter warmer. I used to hate this style, but with my love of malts having developed over the past 2 years this tastes like its gonna be a fun holiday season for brews once the stout season ends (which is ALWAYS my favorite beer season)."
""
"Jubelale's unique flavor profile makes it thoroughly enjoyable to drink contemplatively. But it also makes it difficult to judge. There are elements a variety of beer styles present in the bottle. Perhaps the most salient elements are those of Porter, ESB, and strong American Pale Ale. 'Tis the season to be hybrid. Delicious."
""
" Taste is rather complex for a Christmas beer. Begins slightly bitter with a roasted nutty flavor which leads to sweeter caramel notes and then finishes with a bit of hop bitterness, then a light xmas Spice. Very enjoyable offering, This will be one of my sought after brews every year. Too bad I live in Ohio."

"Pours a clear, dark, amber color with a caramelâ€”colored head that has an orangish hue. Aromas are comprised of an earthiness and brown sugar. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Toasty, butterscotch, and toffee flavor with a piney bitterness at the finish. Average to slightly above average."

"Dark amber with an off white head.  Aroma offers some caramel and toffee mixed with some winter spicing and a touch of earthy hops. Flavor follows suit. A medium bodied mouthfeel.

"A great seasonal release from Deshutes. This warmer isn't spiced, but it feels like it is. There's a slight bitterness to it with a fruity profile - something akin to fig. It's a little dry and it definitely fulfulls the warmer title. Solid release that's worth picking up every winter."

"Poured from 12oz bottle into sampler glass. Pours a rich redish murky brown with a thick creamy tan head that leaves beautiful lacing. Nice sweet aroma, dark fruit, spices, cinnamon, clove, some dark roasted malt and sweet malt hold it all together. Very similar to the nose, the flavor is malty with plenty of spice, mostly cinnamon with a little brown sugar. Solid medium body with a charming medium-light carbonation that really compliments everything going on without getting in front of the flavors."
""
"O - In a style that varies widely from hop bombs to malt bombs and all the way to liquid Christmas trees, this one is quite good. Balance is good with enough hops to give a bit of a bite and a strong malt body full of roasty flavors with just enough fruity/spicy flavors to make you reminisce for snowy winter weekend afternoons in front of the fireplace. Definitely worth seeking out."
""
"Pours nicely. Flavor is smooth with a bit of a leafy and tangy malty thing on there. Actually there is slightly more than a bit; which I could do with less of. Very smooth on the liquid with a mild carbonation. A nice and easy drinker, though not really blowing me away."

"On tap at Danteâ€™s in the University of Washington district in Seattle. Poured into a pint glass. Appearance was dark amber to mahogany. There was a gentle lacing with very little head to speak of. As you drink, the lacing stays on the side of the glass (almost like a Christmas ornament). Aroma was spicy, with red fruits. It has a pretty sweet note to it. Tasted almost like an abbey ale at first. Lots of character and no real surprises after the smell. Itâ€™s warming and drinkable with heavy fruits (cherry) and minimal alcohol burn. Almost spicy. Very crisp and drinkable with a lot of carbonation. There is a small bland aftertaste, but itâ€™s not that bad. Overall itâ€™s a very drinkable, very festive beer. If itâ€™s available and youâ€™re feeling in the mood, pick one up."

"Red-orange in appearance, with a nice head after pour. Hints of earthy tones and a light smell of burnt coffee. It has a rough feel in the mouth, with a tast of spicy and sweet. We think it tastes strong then the actually ABV because of the burnt malt, but it is not too overpowering, and overall a very tasty beer."

"Poured a clear darker mahogany color with a small cap of bubbly whitish head. Caramel malts in the nose, light spice, and a hint of pine needles. Taste of sugars--caramel, molasses--crisply piney and floral, light spices. No really ""big"" flavor here, but a good balance in all the flavors that are present. Medium in body and carbonation, and surely an easy drinker."
""
"I like this beer, but I am not completely sure what to make of it. The beer pours a dark brown color with a nice just off white head that leaves very nice lacing. Aroma is nice, but kind of weird. Billed as a ""festive winter ale"" this beer's aroma has a bit of caramel, but is overwhelmed by a lot of citrusey hops. This feels to me like a hopped up scotch ale. The flavor gives me the same impression. There is some of the smooth caramel malty fullness that I would expect from a winter warmer, moreso than in the aroma, but there is still a big hop presence. I think that while this is nice, the big hop presence clashes a bit with the malt bill that they are going with here. This beer is definitely interesting, but I think it would benefit from a less aggressive hopping schedule."
""
"Overall: An excellent beer. I will choose this for my winter warmers. This is not so radical that it shouldn't be recommended to anyone. I really enjoyed its complexity."

Sweet warming malt notes, with a bit of alcohol and brown sugar, a touch of vanilla and some bittering hops in the finish, leaving a bitter finish. Heavy medium body, warming alcohol and low medium carbonation. A solid winter/holiday ale, with adequate flavours all around and a warmth/size appropriate for the season."

"Picked up a single at Princeton's Liquors. Poured a reddish-brown with a short off-white head. The aroma has a rich mix of sweet toffee with light cinnamon spice and cherry-apple fruit. The flavor is dry and finishes about as hoppy as any winter warmer I've tried. There's a cutting citrus in the finish, rolling over toasty, bready grains. The initial smooth fruit esters are a pleasant contrast to the bitter finish, though not until the beer warms up. Definitely on the interesting end of the style's spectrum, give it a try."

"O: I enjoyed drinking Jubelale. While it isn't a complex beer, it also isn't too simple. This is a nice beer to drink in the winter."
""
"Nothing really exceptional about this beer but nothing to complain about. It's another good winter warmer."

"0- very solid winter warmer. Would buy again."

"what a great beer. Deep dark flavors, not too much abv, very drinkable. Makes you long for winter! Malty, sweet, just enough hops to clean the palate.Just enough spice to make it interesting. Affordable, available here in california. think I'll have another. You gotta try this beer. If you only try out one winter warmer, get this one. You won't be disappointed."

"Drinkability. One of the better winter warmers I've had. Easy on the spice which was appreciated by this guy."

"Overall this is a great winter warmer. Would be great to bring to a holiday gathering."

"Overall: A really nice winter warmer. A perfect beer for the cold and snowy winter night it is in Minnesota tonight. Will easily session a few of these, since I'm in and not driving anywhere tonight. Well done, Deschutes!"

"Overall- Great to sip on a cold night. Just boozy enough to warm you up, but drinkable enough to have another. Doesn't reinvent the wheel, but a solid beer all the same."
""
""

""
""
"Overall an excellent Christmas style that I wish I could get at home!"
"I popped the lid and was greeted by Christmas in a bottle! ""Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells..."" Wow!!! I poured this into a pint glass and watched as the dark amber liquid blossomed with 2 fingers worth of a mocha colored head and amazing lacing. The aroma of holiday spices practically filled the whole room. One sip of this beer and I was sold; this was a solid brew. The beer had a wonderful taste like something akin to a beer version of hot cider only cold. The spices were abundant but not overbearing and the malt was perfectly balanced with the hops leaving a slightly bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Great beer. Not overly hopped and super strong like other winter warmers I've tried. I liked it a lot and will probably buy at least one more six pack."
"O-Another very good beer from Deschutes. Flavor, drinkability, this beer has it all."
"Excellent."
"O - Wow, this is a very nice beer. The aroma is soft and inviting to me, and the flavor profile is wonderful with that subtle vanilla and cinnamon. The beer even looks tasty! I definitely recommend this one to anyone who likes maltier brews. I'd love to buy it again. Cheers!"
""
""
"O: A great winter warmer that I enjoy drinking every year. Highly recommended."
"1990 Great American Beer Festival"
"The flavor has more of the same, with a great bitterness contrasting the sweetness. Some malty stone fruits and candied fruitsâ€”candied apples, maybe?â€”with this boozy rum-like character that emerges as it warms."
""
""
"Wow...Deschutes has really impressed me with this one. In fact, this brewery has impressed me with a bunch of their brews. Plan on drinking this one for some of these upcoming cold winter nights...just try not to chug it so fast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is, thus far, my ideal winter warmer. Can't imagine one a lot tastier. I could drink this all night! I'll be drinking winter warmers for the next week or so... we'll see if anything can usurp it!"
"Overall - A really nice winter ale. Decent name and pretty cool label artwork - kind of a pastel Rockwell sort of thing? Really smooth, dry, and drinkable, but just slightly heavy for my tastes. Solid B+ beer."

"Pours a clear, dark amber color. One inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, caramel malt, slight roasted malt, hint of nut, and a hint of spice. Fits the style of a Winter Warmer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of coffee, hint of spice (coriander?), slight dark citrus (cherry?), slight alcohol, and a hint of caramel malt. Overall, great appearance, good blend, and good body."
""
""
"Pours a dark maroon color with ruby hues and a frothy tan head that left foamy lacing on the glass. Sweet candy like caramel malt with toast, cocoa and cinnamon. Fruit cake with citrus hops a hint of pine sweet malt and cinnamon. The beer is nice and thick, very smooth carbonation so it goes down nice and easy, warming finish. One of the best winter seasonal's I've had."

"O: This is beer really isnt as good as I once remember. I still like it, but just doesnt do it for me like it use to. I wish they nose was a little better and it doesnt have near the spices I expect from a Winter Warmer."
""
"Overall Drinkability - Decent session. Could do without the metal and some of the astringency."
"Overall - It isn't too different from other winter warmers I've had, but it's mixture of flavors AND drinkability make this a very easy to recommend winter warmer."
""
""
"O - A good winter warmer that I wouldn't mind drinking a few off in the coming winter months. It's not the top of my list but it's good beer from an outstanding brewery."
""
""
""
"Overall, the beer is bland."
""
""
"D - I'm a big fan of Deschutes, but wasn't terribly impressed by this one. The abv isn't quite high enough to have an impact and the winter warmer effect."
""
""
""
"Not bad overall, but I was expecting more from the reputation, & the nose promised more than the taste delivered. Still enough to be happy about, I'd definitely try it again."
"O - I can clearly see how Jubel 2010 comes from this. Easily my favorite winter seasonal. The combination of chocolate with fruits and spice is just so inviting."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very pleasant beer for the colder months. A good holiday go-to brew."

"Overall, this was an excellent winter warmer in my opinion. I picked this up as a single and now I can't wait to grab a 6 pack next time I get a chance."
""
""
"Overall I have enjoyed this for years. This years version seems a bit more on the aggressive side, but amazing. You may have friends that enjoy mulled cider or mulled wine to celebrate the holidays. Introduce them to this as a beer substitute for the same flavors or idea and maybe we can claim another soul to the craft beer revolution. A must try for the holidays."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass best by date of 4/24/12. This pours a nice brown color with a tan head which has a nice retention and leaves a little lacing. This smells of toffee, roasted malts, caramel and roasted malts. The feel is medium to thick. The taste is excellent, way way better than the winter warmer I had last week, this is one of my favorite Deschutes beers, it has the toffee and caramel with a nice roasted malt and bitter hop finish, great beer."

"O- Great beer for the Pacific NW winters and a solid contribution to the slew of winter ales. Wish it was bolder. This beer would be superb with a higher OG, or even better barrel aged."
"12oz bottle. Pours a deep copper/amber color with a slightly off white head and a fine display of lacing. Aroma of barley, brown sugar, and toffee. In the taste, robustly malty leaving a strong impression of chocolate. Somewhat sweet, as there is little in the way of hop bitterness. Nice dry cocoa flavor and very light spice notes. Medium bodied feel with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a tasty winter warmer, exceptional for the colder months."
"Over all, decent winter ale, my first loves for winter ales are celebration and Brrrr, so big competition. I do enjoy the creaminess and the unusual lingering of taste that comes after a sip, I think I'll stick to my fav's! I would recommend it though!!"
"gettin the winter warmer season started on the early side, 11/12/11. cool. pours a dark red wood color with a standard 1 finger head. nose and taste are parallel is magic, christmas cookie biscuity with a gently spiced middle and a rare but seasonally appropriate hop finish. crisp for a warmer. mouthfeel is almost perfect, hold it for a minute, gets all creamy and rich. this beer is gold. yummm"
"I am skipping the standard on this...This beer taste with hops and crispness. There is a little burnt caramel that is great. I think this beer is a must try. I know it will be in fridge multiple times this winter."
"O: All in all, this is a decent beer. Not amazing, but decent. I can definitely taste some elements of Jubel 2010, but a lot lighter version. Not as flavorful. Definitely try if you like a more watered down winter warmer, but still full of great flavor."
"Overall it's a good beer but nothing special just a slightly above avg winter warmer with decent flavor and balance."
"Dr: Very drinkable, especially for the relatively high ABV. I'd like to try it on draught, and as always I look forward to more beers from Deschutes."
"O- I'm not one for holiday ales, but this isn't too shabby."
"Another winter warmer to try from the mixed 6 pack. I liked this one as it reminded me more of a strong ale instead of going overboard with wintry spices. Nice malty beer with a dry citrus finish, would be a nice change of pace any time of year."
"O - Love the warming feeling of this beer. It has a deep malty body with a great balance of a northwest hop profile."
"The strange alcohol harshness also detracts greatly on the palate. This is not something I will probably ever pick up again."
"Absolutely loved this one; not overly herb or spice profile, but big malt and sweet dried fruit. Among my favorite Winter Warmers (along with Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome - very different though). Delicious and highly recommended."
"Overall this might be my favorite winter warmer and another excellent job by Deschutes on making great beer that I love to drink."
"Mouthfeel is light and dry. Overall, this is a nice solid beer."
"The appearance is very hard to grade, because it has a nice body, the lacing followed me almost all the way down the glass, and the head was big and it looked pretty nice when I first poured it. However, the head didn't last very long and it left this weird patchy, bubbly array of bubbles on top of the body. This beer probably deserves a 4.5 for appearance, but I'm going to bump it down to a 4 because the bubbles looked bad and they kinda just freaked me out."
"O - This beer is all over the place. I would not want this much hops from a winter warmer, but everything else is decent. Not something I would seek out, but would drink this if it was available."
"O- It's one dimensional but I enjoy all the flavors it has. Worth a shot."
"Overall this is a new favorite among winter ales, and another notch for Deschutes on my top breweries list. Balanced and very drinkable, yet flavorful. A bit light for the style, but some may like that. I'll be getting this again. Cheers!"
"All in all, an excellent beer."
"O - Great drinkable winter warmer. One of the best in terms of values as well since the price is quite fair."
"Overall: Love this beer. It is one of my favorite winter seasonals. I look forward to this every year well done deschutes."
"Nice beer for the season, if lacking in heft."
"O: A hoppy and nice winter warmer that is almost reminiscent of a sweet ESB."
"Aging notes: I tried this next to a one-year old bottle and the year-old bottle had a fantastic nose but the taste was quite vegetal, phenolic, and just mostly unpleasant. Do NOT age this beer."
"This is just a classic beer that I look forward to every fall."
"can down couple of pints easily. very very tasty brew"
"O - I've never had a winter warmer before, but this is definately a winner. The head sticks around, even as I'm typing this end part. Very smooth, malty, delicious. Definately gets better as it warms!"
"O: Not loving this beer as I do every other Deschutes release I've had. Don't know if it's the style or what. It's not bad for sure, just not great. Maybe it needs to be winter?"
" Goes good with pasta."
"O - Fall is here with this one."
"O - Awesome brew! I look forward to this one every year..."
"O: I think this beer tastes better slightly aged than having it fresh. Worthy of being cellared for at least a year."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"O - I really liked this beer it has a very good taste that was very easy to drink one of the better winter beers out there worth trying if you see it around"
"O: This is a good alternative to those big stouts and barleywines when the weather turns cool. Now I just need to try this again when it's fresh."
"O - A really nice Winter Warmer, I'd love it on a cold night!"
"(Review from tasting notes. February 2011)"
"Pours a clear garnet with a soapy head. I think that's the perfect descriptor for the look of this beer, I'll put it up against the best of them. Nose is fairly hop-forward, a bit of malt heft, reminds me of an aggressively hopped American style barley wine. This might actually be the first ""Winter Warmer"" I've ever had, wow. Flavor is strangely dry, very welcoming in that way. Pine cone and forest floor are the hop qualities, but they are very nicely tempered. A faint sap-like quality. I really enjoy the perfect attenuation here. Fairly thin feel. Way better than I expected."
"Overall it's really good, especially for the price. Goes well with Chinese food."
"O: Overall I thought this was a good beer. A beer that I would have guessed is a winter warmer, which doesn't always happen with this style."
"The CPJ"
"Medium bodied with a prominent peppery spice presence up front that lingers throughout over the sweet malt and dark fruit notes into a lingering dry finish. Slight herbal/medicinal with only a touch of the buttery character found in the aroma. Very malty with lots of caramel, biscuit, toffee, toast and rye. I'm also picking up hints of cherry, raisin, plum and grape. Complex but a bit too heavy on the spices for my liking. The lack of booziness/heat helps drinkability but I'm just not a big fan of the flavor."
"Not my favorite Deschutes beer, but one 12oz. bottle is more than enough for me."
"o - glad i got another shot at this one. much better fresh...still nothing crazy, but enjoyable winter warmer."
"Deschutes can do no wrong in my book. Jubelale is a solid, tasty, well crafted winter beer. I normally prefer a spicier winter warmer but Jubelale brings a balanced profile that leaves me with not much else to ask for."
"Overall: its a very enjoyable beer one of the better winter warmers"
"D: This winter warmer is a straight-forward contribution to a style of typically odd-ducks. It features a strong malt presence and a touch of yeasty fruit, but spices seem to be out of the picture. The dryness on display here is unexpected and remarkable for the style. While not really anything special by Deschutes standards, it is satisfactory simply by not being an embarrassing mess."
"reminds me of another one of my winter time faves...GI X-mas ale. this one has a bit more hops and little less belgian candy flair but outstanding regardless. loved it. and this might age for a year or so very well...might try it myself. very impressed and highly recommended."
"Overall, a good version of the style and a great beer for the colder months. I just wish I got to it sooner."
"Boy this is an odd one, this was not what I was expecting from this style. Really spicy and dry and light. It's a bit too parching in my palate for me to really get into, but it has some real good qualities."
"Smooth, creamy mouthfeel that only gets better the more it warms up. Medium carbonation. Easily drinkable and sessionable in the colder months."
"D: Quite good, very smooth and all that, but it doesn't quite stack up to some of the other seasonal beers that are just as easy to find out here."
"D- Definitely not impressed. It was a fine tick, but I definitely will never seek this out again. It was a challenge for the last quarter of my glass to go down. I had to let my palate revive itself from the final drinks. Before that though, went through it pretty much like most unassuming, average brews."
"D= I dunno how many of these I could drink before wanting to check out something else. It's ok but nothing worth seeking out."
"Not the best but still a very pleasant beer. As others have noted, perhaps a bit weak on the malt front."
"A good winter warmer, although I'd prefer if it had more of a malt presence."
"D: Perfect for a winter night and extremely easy to drink. Very well balance and not an overly spiced winter warmer."
"This is horrible and needs to be dumped, even more opening it."
"Really interesting for a christmas seasonal. A good amount of spice and hops as it poured into a nice dark orange, with a little bit of lacing and head. I didn't really feel the ""festive ale"" as much as some of the other beers I've had around this time, but it did have some good spices and taste."
"D - Almost reminiscent of a hoppy amber ale with a hint of spicing. It`s nice to have a winter warmer that doesn`t bombard your tastebuds with spices. Very tasty and drinkable and highly recommended to any fan of winter warmers. No need for this to be seasonal as it would be drinkable ay time of the year."
"I've got a soft spot for Dechutes. I thought this was great. One of those beers with a big load of malt to lend some backbone to the hops, ala Three Floyds. I could drink the whole 6 of this right now. If they only distributed farther east."
"This is huge drinkable and enjoyable winter seasonal that has eluded me for a long time, but was worth while after scoring a case! Cheers!"
"Overall, good drink and a nice enjoyable WW."
"D - truly exceptional, instead of the typical spice bomb that masks may winters, this is characterized by the candied fruit and rich malty flavour with a fantastic hop balance, truly exceptional"
"Aroma is fig, spice medley, caramel and dark bread. Taste is rum raisin, thin steely caramel, plum and chocolate muffin. Toned down hop spice with a pharmaceutical lean. I'd like a chewier mouthfeel. I suspect this beer is at the end of it's lifeline."
"Nice beer, cant complain and would eagerly grab one if offered. Another win from Deschutes."
"D- Pretty good. A tasty beer. Another good one from Deschutes."
"Personally I have never been that impressed by winter warmers but this is really something else. Poured from a bottle into a wine glass. Nice thick coffee black color with a thick cocoa head. Smells like coffee, toffee, cinnamon, and a whole kitchen of spices. The taste is sort of a combination between toffee and spice that balances out to be not spicy at all but just a smooth beer that is real drinkable. A tasty winter treat for desert that goes great with chocolate."
"Dark brown colored brew, not easy to see through but it looks pretty clear. Small tan head, lots of lace. Pretty big malt scent, candy sweetness and a bit of roast. Kinda has a bit of a brown ale taste, but its better than most browns in my opinion. Some nut tones, some candy sweetness, a bit of bittering hops and perhaps some other spices. Thin to medium mouth, pretty wet. The more i've drank of it, the more it reminds me of a brown, so if youre into those then this would be a good one to try, but that style isnt my thing."
"D- Nice little winter warmer. Not my favorite but I wouldnt mind trying it again."
"Man, Flexabull throwing curveball after curveball. Answer is a bottle of Jubelale from Deschutes. I got to try a bit of this at my homebrew club's last meeting along side some Super Jubel 2010. We tasted over 35 beers that night so my recollection is a bit hazy, however I feel like I've enjoyed it more tonight than I did then. Thanks again Paul!"
"D - Dark fruit maybe be least favorite flavor profile, but this is highly drinkable and though the dark fruits are in the spotlight, they aren't overbearing or linger too long."
"Drink- I will probably come back to this if I see it on the shelf of my local liquor store. I really like it while eating Jubelale beer cheese soup."
"Highly drinkable. Could do a few of these if needed."
"Atmosphere is pretty good here. Really nice appearance with a great foamy head and lots of lacing. Nose is not all that complex, but does have a nice combo of sweet and malt components. Flavor is characterized less by the malt, and more by the other components. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"D - This is a good beer. I acquired one in a trade with gkunkle. Glad I got to try this one."
"This beer just didn't do it for me. The mix of spice and hops seems a bit harsh. Not sure if my bitter senses are over active today. Not all that impressed."
"More toasted brown malt in the flavor, with a lingering aftertaste of browned apple flesh, holiday spices, and fresh hops. Very bold and aggressive for the style, yet Jubelale pulls back and lets each flavor come through at any given time. Mouthfeel is rich and nearing full-bodied, but the spot-on carbonation level keeps things from getting cloyingly sweet and syrupy. All in all, a top notch, WC Winter Warmer from the skilled hands at Deschutes. I grab a six pack every winter, and should try to find some more before spring 2011 rolls around..."
"d - could drink a six of these no problem."
"M. Medium/light bodied. Somewhat lacking in the body. Felt a little watery to me."
"Taste is quite spicy and flavorful, there's some nice dark malt character to it, and a nice creamy mouthfeel with light but sharp carbonation. There's a slight warming from it that's nice as well."
"This nut brown holiday special really warms the heart. Pours a nice chocolate color with one finger of off white head. The smell is of roasted barely and chocolate. The taste starts strong of chocolate and malt and then finishes with some slight hoppy bitterness. The finish is very smooth and makes the beer very drinkable. Good winter beer for those fans of brown ales."
"Merry Christmas, everybody!"
"M/D - A little thinner than expected, but I would still call it medium bodied. Booziness is a touch too much to score real high on the drinkability scale."
"Medium bodied, slightly higher carbonation, sticky and dry in feel. A nice combo of spice and hops which makes for a solid drinking winter warmer, although the nose was pretty muted."
"(D)- A solid to great winter warmer. Rich and smooth without being too strong. Perfect for tonite; a few days before xmas."
"Had this on tap at the Deschutes brewpub in Portland. Pours a copper-amber colour with thin off-white head. Some mild lacing on the glass. Smells of hops, caramel with some classic winter spices. Spice level isn't overpowering as some North American winter warmers are. Very nice."
"A solid winter warmer that marries tradition with the hop-heavy tendencies of its geographic origin."
"Really Good! I want this again. This is a winter seasonal standout. Not sure how to describe it, but it just tastes like the holidays... Make sure you try it this winter! You won't be disappointed."
"Overall: I loved Jubelale. It's a unique winter ale that has the perfect amount of hops. I don't get to enjoy Deschutes very often (they don't sell in Wisc.), but Jubelale gives them a good name out here!"
"$7 for a 6 er is a good price, so the value is there. Definitely try it along with some other seasonals."
"Single picked up at the store to try this year's version. Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark brown color with red highlights. Nice sized head. Good lacing. Smell had a wonderful cinnamon scent to it. Taste was great. I picked up notes of fruits like apples, pears, and oranges, plus lots of spices like brown sugar and cloves. Mouthfeel was moderately thick but also smooth. Highly drinkable. This is how winter warmer beers should be brewed. Wish this beer was available back in MA."
"Bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a dark, apple cider colored reddish brown with a fluffy 2 finger slighlty tan head. Sweet smelling, faintly of honey, along with caramel. Slight citrus hop notes in the nose as well. Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation. Very smooth flavored with notes of slight roast, some bitterness, and citrus. Some pine like bitterness as well makes itself known at the end. Slight lace on the glass. No real alcohol present in the nose or taste. Over all a nice beer but lacks any sort of in your face flavors but that's what is kind of nice about it too."
"Drinkability: Very solid -- great scents and flavors, and really, the only detractor I can find in it is the rather harsh, bitter aftertaste that lingers; if a bit more of the malty sweetness held up in this it may have scored just a tad higher; I think if I manage to get a few more of these, they may go in the closet for about 6 months to see if the malts develop more."
"Drinkability - this will probably open up even better as it warms up. But great balance. Great flavor, Lots of depth and body without being overbearing."
"d I bought a six-pack. Then a case. Then another...Best beer of the season in my book. Too bad winter will turn to spring."
"D: I would love to drink another when feeling thirsty. I was well pleased with this beer."
"D: Great. This is a good brew."
"Mouthfeel is a little lighter than I was expecting, but there is plenty of prickly carbonation to go around. I'm not typically a fan of sweeter beers like this and this one didn't change my mind, although it was nice to give this holiday ale a try on a cold December night."
"The beer went down silky smooth. It left a nice bitter hop aftertaste in my mouth as well as some roasty caramel flavour. (perhaps a hint of nut). I can imagine the drinkability would be great as well. Overall a great beer which defies categorization."
"My review for this is rather lackluster because this simply didn't impress me, which is odd because I've always considered Deschutes to be a pretty darn good brewing company. As a beer in and of itself, it's decent. As a winter ale, it's somewhat disappointing. Would I buy it again? probably not. It's just okay"
"This is a very yummy example of the category. I'd recommend it highly."
"The nose was a disappointment, but otherwise this is a pretty solid seasonal. The average ABV--low for the style--makes this wonderfully sessionable."
"all in all, I'm thrilled to have had the chance to try Jubelale, one of my standard fallbacks, on Nitro. deliciously creamy which works beautifully with the flavors of Jubelale. I could easily go for a few more of these! The flavors aren't quite as pronounced as in past years, albeit possible the nitro tap may have effected that somewhat. Regardless, it's still a solid brew."
"If you are more of a hophead, this could be a good intro beer to the category. I'm still left wanting for more malt and spices."
"MF/D: Mouthfeel and Drink are both good. Mouthfeel is full, and this is a tasty brew."
"D: Not terrible, but forgettable. Easy to get through fast to move on to something else."
"Overall: The deep, smoky, burnt flavor is just a little too overpowering for me. It really becomes the focus of this beer for me, and I just don't like it."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is a massive two and a half inches in height, and recedes quickly into a thick cap of rocky lacing. This beer looks fantastic. The aroma is of caramel, toffee, and well integrated dark spices. The taste is spicier than the aroma with a lot of ginger, but there is enough of a malt presence to keep things from going out of whack. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is one of the better winter warmers I've had in a long while. I will certainly drink this beer again."
"Jubelale is the taste of winter. Not too heavy, not too sweet, extremely sessionable."
"Not my cup of tea, but it's pretty good for the style."
"The mouthfeel is a little above medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Drinkability is good, especially for the style. I usually find the beers of the style too spiced or too sweet. This one however balances everything very nicely and allows all of the flavors to shine at one time or another. Very good beer overall."
"Not a great winter warmer. Would accept it in the future if offered but I wouldn't buy it again. Appearance and mouthfeel are the best things about this in my opinion."
"D- my favorite winter seasonal so far. Deschutes never disappoints!"
"F/D - Smooth and a little carbonated. And a bitter aftertaste. Not too drinkable for me. I believe I'll pass on my next opportunity to drink this festive winter ale."
"Overall-overall I thoroughly enjoyed this winter warmer. Had it by a warm fire and once again Dechutes didn't dissapoint. Good brewery, good beer."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall impression: Leave the spices in the cupboard; this is what a real winter warmer should taste like. Top notch."
"Notes - This is a good all round winter warmer. My only complaint is that lingering bitter aftertaste but that's forgiveable in an otherwise good beer."
" I've liked everything I've tried from Deschutes, and Jubelale is no exception. In fact, it's probably one of my favorites. It's too bad I only bought one bottle, because I could definitely drink more of this. Those of you that love a nice malty beer on cold nights should definitely give Jubelale a try."
"This is a well constructed beer. All components are well balanced and contribute constructively to the experience. I would definitely drink more of this."
"This bad boy is a mini jubel 2010 without all the lasting flavors of the jubel. It starts licoricey with raisins and finish with a hint of hops. Its a good beer in this style but not my favorite."
"Drink- It was a good 12 oz and I could see a 6'er falling very easily on this one."
"the pour is a dark red and brown with a tan head. very frothy foam on top. The taste is quit bitter at first and its easy to feel the piney flavors. its definitely a winter beer with the sharp sting in the taste. A bit earthy and possibly some fruit in the mix. The best thing about the beer is not the taste however, it's the smell."
"Deschutes Jubelale pours a beautiful deep red brown with a nice tan head. The aroma malty, with some toffee and roasted notes. There is a nice, earthy herbal and mildly citrusy and piney hop aroma. The flavor is bitter and malty, with out being overly sweet. More roasted character comes through in the flavor, with some piney, earthy hops. The beer almost tastes mildly spiced, but it might be because I expected it to be."
"Drinkability: Flavors are not too complex and not overpowering enough to be a put off. This combined with a low ABV can make for an extremely drinkable brew."
"Oddly enough, for all the bad things I say about it I still drink it again and again and I don't know why. Maybe it's my unhealthy-relationship beer: you keep returning to it, hoping things will get better. :-D"
"a ruby amulet, clear and inviting, with a beautiful head that creams the tulip. the aroma is lush and inviting: a bit of chocolate, some raisins, dash of caramel, notable and pleasant pine and citrus. very well-balanced, hop-forward winter. the bitterness slams you into the snow, while the caramel sweetness and pine and citrus hops rub it in your face. very chewy for its medium thickness. i shall be enjoying these all day."
"Mouthfeel: Medium body, not thick or chewy"
"This is probably my go-to beer during late fall/early winter, despite it lacking a defining characteristic. I wish it were year-round but after all it is a winter warmer. I enjoyed it more on nitro-tap than I have on regular draft or bottles. would like to try it on cask as well, so hopefully i don't miss my window of opportunity!"
"Drinkability - Not a bad brew, but it kind of has a filling quality that I wouldn't care for in a six-pack's worth, but on its own is just fine."
"D: Despite the seemingly negative attributes, this beer went down quickly. Matter of factly, the wife just asked ""Did you finish your beer already?"". It was good. I think I am just disappointed as I continue my search for a beer with more of the seasonal taste; meaning cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, anything that reminds me of the holidays."
"Another gift from the West. This beer presented itself in a much darker condition of an ale. Smell was a mix of light citrus, carmel and toasty bread. Once it hit my lips the hops took over and gave way to a biscuity, sweet finish. Good mouthfeel in full essence of the season. In the end, a really drinkable ale."
"Medium bodied, medium carbonation, has a bit of a dry feeling. This is not that bad of a beer, but is too hoppy and dry for the style."
"Dark crimson color with a large, dense head that had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Heavy lacing is left on the glass. Impressive. Malty aroma. Hints of chocolate, caramel, alcohol, and a little citrus. The hops make more of a showing in the taste as all 60 IBUs are detectable. One of the most bitter Winter Warmers I have come across. The bitterness balances out the sweet, chocolatety malt. Some fruity esters add a level of complexity. Alcohol is felt and adds some warmth. The body feels a little light for all the malt and flavor going on. Carbonation is nice. A truely warming Winter warmer. Hoppy and malty and fantastic looking."
"Opinion: This is really a good beer overall. It is really clean, but has a solid flavor profile that doesn't leave the palate wanting for hardly anything. The spice is a welcome component, but may be a tad much. Either way, I like this beer and wouldn't mind enjoying it again in the future. Give it a shot if you can find it...you won't be disappointed if you like the Old Ale/Winter Warmer styles of beer."
"D: Based on this, albeit narrow, experiment of these two bottles I can say that Jubelale did not hold up very well over the year. This may have just been batch variation, and it's still drinkable, but the 09 is a completely different beer than the 10. If you already knew this, congratulations, I'm apparently slow. But if you're looking for a place to age a few bottles from your six-pack, you won't find any room in my cellar. Drink it fresh! (Score represents fresh version)."
"Upon reading some other reviews, maybe this beer needed to warm up a bit more. Obviously I have to finish out this sixer, so next time, I'll let it warm up a little more and see if it seems a bit less harsh. Or if all else fails, let someone else drink it."
"Very good, a really nice holiday beer."
"O: Good, but not great."
"D - pretty good, but lacks the abv to really tackle the stickiness of the malt. One an evening is definitely enough."
"Linger: 3"
" ~ This a a definite warmer. I've had only a few sips and I'm already feelin' nice and cozy. This is a sipper that should be enjoyed rather slow."
"This beer is a dark mahogany with reddish edging. The head is full and an almost orange color with tan mixed in. The smell was not distinct and did not make much of an impression, mostly some sweet sugars and a touch of spice. The taste was good, picked up mainly on toffee, definite caramel, candy sugar and malts. There was a bit of peppery spice and some hops in the background. This medium bodied brew is well done and would be perfect for a Christmas party or other occasion with non-craft beer drinkers."
"pours a dark brown with ruby highlight it has an excellent tan head with great lacing..smell is roasted malts hops and toffee sweet brown sugar..taste is a roasted malt ,bread ,grass,toffee and sweet malts with hops on the palate...mouth fell is full nice carbonation fill the beer buds with loads of flavor..drinkability is great one of my favorite winter warmers"
"D: Damn good, simple beer."
"D: Very drinkable beer. Recommend picking it up. Smooth with lots of flavor."
"Deschutes Jubelale pours a finger of sticky tan foam over an almost opaque black brew. Held to bright light a bright light a deep rosy brew and steady carbonation is revealed. The nose is toasty dark malt with a fruity note and a little bright hop spiciness. Up front the flavor is dark sweet malts and that fruity note again, balanced by spicy herbal hops. Mouthfeel is crisp with a long hoppy aftertaste. This is a fairly hoppy ale, but balanced by rich sweet dark malts- how they make feel so light is beyond me. It's that note of fruit though, that makes this a winter holiday beer, though otherwise it would still be a pretty good hoppy brown ale. I love the label art, by the way- it's the work of Oregon artist Natasha Bacca."
"drinkability - complex and flavorful, excellent sugar notes, a bit warm and would be great with some age"
"Jubelale is: Not syrupy, Not astringent, Not to thin or thick. It is a great blend of malts and hops and the english ale yeast they use as their house yeast makes the most drinkable winter/strong ale i've tried in the last few years."
"A very nice Winter Warmer. Lots of flavors going on. Something that might be an interesting experiment in the cellar. Along the lines of Anchors Our Special Ale. Though really good fresh without a doubt. Something I highly recommend."
"Beer is medium to light in body with a creamy mouthfeel. Lead off sweetness and a nice finish without an aftertaste. The spice level is nice and gives it a tea like flavor to the whole thing. I enjoyed it for a winter warmer its pretty good."
"-i dont mind the beer, but i definitely remember enjoying last years better. not bummed i got a 6er, but that will probably be it for me this season"
"D: I refuse this beer whenever it is offered. I would rather go sober than drink this beer again."
"I'm not a fan of novelty beers in general, but this one is pretty decent. It's a slightly cloudy red ale that pours with a smallish tan head. Nice blend of hops and malt flavors, with just a hint of ""holiday"" flavoring - somewhere between citrus and evergreen. Jubelale is not going to become one of my regular beers, but I'll probably buy some now and again during the Fall/Winter season. I'd put it in the top 20% among all beers and ales I've tasted."
"Poured into a sniffer. Color consisted of a dark garnet hue with a one inch smokey tan head. Smell is consistent with the style. Picked up mainly rum raisin, fresh wheat toast, and some sticky figs. Taste was heavy on the malt and finished with a distinct hops character. Overall, very drinkable beer. Warming int the way down."
"D: this is a nice winter warmer from Deschutes."
"Verdict: Very good, reasonably priced winter ale worth having in the fridge at all times when it's available."
"Good beer."
"Jubelale is a decent winter ale and I'd drink it over a domestic but at least this years (2010) batch is nothing to write home about."
"Notes: This beer is medium to full bodied, flavorful, and has just enough alcohol warmth to make the long winter nights seem a bit shorter. This could be my favorite seasonal release from Deschutes. Jubelale is an awesome beer, and one that I will never turn down when offered it."
"D - Good. Dry, clean, spicy and flavorful. Quite refreshing and easy drinking especially on the cooler nights."
"Drinkability: Very good example of an English Strong Ale that has been ramped up on hops. The spicy, floral English hop bitterness is just slightly off-putting but this is still a very good, complex beer for the winter."
"Great progression and complexity of flavors in this brew -- I enjoyed it last winter, but this time around I'm appreciating it much more."
"The aroma is dominated by hops, with just the faintest hint of caramelized sugar. The flavour is more balanced, with the smoky coffee flavour that Deschutes does so well blended with hops and something malty. The beer finishes dry, with just a slight bitter aftertaste. It seems to improve as it warms, the flavours becoming more distinct. Not terribly drinkable for for my money, though - just a touch too dry."
"D: awesome, I love how dry it is. It's perfect for the season, it tastes like a Yule log. Light and dry while still being roasty and warming. Delicious."
"Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, very smooth and creamy with great carbonation. Overall this is a must-have winter seasonal from Deschutes that is damn tasty."
"Good work from Deschutes"
"2010 Release. Pours a very dark ruby-amber color with a small off-white head. Scent is very sweet with some caramel and dark fruit aromas. I get very little hops but a nice amount of malt in the nose as well. Taste is surprisingly hoppier than expected. After the bitterness, I get sweet candied sugar flavors with sweet malts. There is a slight caramel and nutty flavor as well. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, great for a winter brew (even though it's still hot here in Fresno). Drinkability is fairly high."
"A tasty seasonal seasonal from Deschutes, but I believe they change the recipe slightly every year. If so this year's was not my favorite. Good but a little boozy and the hops arent as well integrated as I seem to remember. Maybe this is one that I prefer with a little age on it, but I remember liking this beer more last year."
"Okay cold but much better warm, this is a great winter warmer with fantastic taste. I think it's the peaty taste as I do love a good scotch ale but it is still a complex and highly enjoyable ale. I always have a hard time resisting picking up a six pack when they're on sale."
"Picked up a 12 pack of this on my way back from Seattle and I was surprised in a good way how much this beer tasted different than I remember it . When I drank it in the late 90's it seemed to be slightly spicy and now it tastes like a Cascadian Ale with lots of hops and a dark malt backbone. Lovely to look at with a big head and reddish brown colour , the beer has a full mouthfeel that opens up to show the hops but still feature the malt that defines this varied style."
"Overall quite a nice winter warmer better than most."
"D: Sensational. I'm trying to make the 12-pack (which I bought for $11.99, by the way) last a while so I can see how the aging affects it, but I'm having a hard time."
" Great beer!"
"D: For a winter warmer this is on the hoppy side and overall very drinkable, the lingering bitterness is nice but also a bit off for me for winter, I like it a bit maltier."
"This years is the best years I have had. I don't know if it is in my mind or what, but I am really enjoying it this year. My favorite seasonal of this season currently. Had it on tap and bottle and it is amazing in both, go out and get some. Also like the artwork on the bottle this year."
" This beer is at its best just below room temp. Served too cold and the little nuances of the flavor are completely lost. The creamy feel and flavor notes make this an exceptional brew this year."
" A great pairing beer, something that should be sipper, shared, and savored with friends and family by a fireplace on a winters eve."
"Deschutes Brewery--Jubelale--A Festive Winter Ale--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 6.70%. (4.25 / 5.0) Winter Ale. Thin mild lace copper white head. Enticing clear bright dark Ruby color. Rich floral malt mild rosebud-hop front. Dry sweet spicy toasted mild toffee red fruit body. Dry tangy sweet zesty earthy hop hint crusty hint black cherry Winter Ale end. Sampled 9/16/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $6.99 @ Fred Meyer--Ballard, Seattle 9/16/2010."
"Pours with a tall head, tan in color. Beer is a dark brown, just clear enough for a tiny bit of light to penetrate. Smells malty, a little bit spice and a heavy sweetness (like syrup or molasses, not sugar) Taste is malty with a bit of spice and toastyness. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer, a lot of people rave about it, but I am not really into it. Its not really my style."
"Expected this to be a little sweeter but still decent."
"D: good winter beer in the summer hahaa. Really held up well after 4 years. Will probably try to find some more bottles."
"D - A very tasty Winter brew. I got this one in a Winter sampler pack I got on clearance and I think that this is one of the best ones in the box. I would purchase this one again when it is in season."
"Drinks like a brown ale. No spiced flavor, but good taste."
"The Jubelale pours an amber color. Very thin head an no lacing on the glass. Much of the nose is winter spices and malts. Raisins and hops round out the aromas. Taste is slightly alcoholic with raisins and prunes. Plenty of spices linger on the palate. Mouthfeel is spicy while thin. Drinkability is good even way outside of the season for this brew. I could definitely handle several of these."
"Drinkability: Drinkable, but no need for another"
"Pours a moderate copper color with a decent white head. The smell is a bit of spice and a good deal of citrus hops, especially for the style. A little bit of fruit in there as well. The taste was fairly nice, and much better than the nose. The nose was certainly a bit weak when compared to the taste, although the general components were quite similar. Mouthfeel was a little bit too light. Good drinkability, especially for a winter warmer."
"My favorite generic winter beer that is out in stores. This is my rock. Whenever i would go out to buy a darker beer this is what i would grab first. Although it is a dark beer it is so smooth that even my friends who had never liked dark beer liked having jubelale. Recommend this beer to everyone!"
"D- so good I started my second one before 10 am"
"Pours copper brown with slight head. Aroma is malted and roasted. Flavor is roasted and dark, with dark fruit, cherry and dark caramel. Finish has a woody bitterness. Mouthfeel is solid and assertive but not excessive. Drinkable."
"Body was medium, and the carbonation was good and sharp. Slickness in the mouth gave way to a dry finish. This one's definitely worth a try."
"C - A lovely beer that I would sit down over a long evening with friends and drink, though not one of my top Winter Warmers!"
"This medium bodied brew gave me an interesting mix of candy sweetness and the more expected bitterness towards the end. As it warmed the alcohol content became more apparent but it did not detract from the flavor. Tasty malty juiciness up front but Jubleale has the hops to balance it out. Bakers chocolate like bitterness takes me to the finish where a slight alcohol note lingers providing the ""warming"" effect. Yum!"
"Still, this is an extremely drinkable beer, reminds of a lightly spiced, slightly more fruity version of an American Brown. Amped just enough to add some flavor but still feels immensely drinkable. Great beer - thanks Chris!"
"Drinkability: Easy drinker."
"Pours a nice amber-brown color with a tan head. Malty aroma with some fruits and spices, plus a bit of alcohol. Moderately spicy taste with apples and pear. There's a light bitterness in the aftertaste and a hint of alcohol. Moderate carbonation, medium-bodied and quite smooth. An enjoyable winter warmer; I'd probably get this on tap again."
"Not bad, but seemed a bit underpowered for a true winter warmer."
"I should note that I have never tasted this beer before, so needless to say I never had a fresh version. That would be an interesting comparison to this aged version, which I enjoyed."
"Overall- Not the best winter warmer, but it did catch me a bit off guard."
"A little too much on the light side for me."
"Big, balanced flavor makes Jubelale a fantastic winter brew."
"Pours a very dark mahogany, with a decent toffee colored head that leaves nice lacing. A nice roasted malty caramel aroma, with a bit of alcohol after note, with a similar flavor. Nice malty richness, consisting of caramel and perhaps a hint chocolate and coffee, with only a little touch of hops towards the end. The mouth feel is medium bodied, nothing too outstanding, but nothing missing either. It is a very drinkable beer, not overly dark and heavy, but still very flavorful enough."
"This is a drinkable beer. Not too heavy & the spicy qualities make it perfect for Christmas Eve."
"This was my first time drinking Jubelale, and although they could probably stand to take it a little easier on the hops in this one, it stacks up pretty well against most of the other winter warmers out there and lives up to Deschutes' high standard."
"D - Very enjoyable winter ale. Seems stronger than 6.7%. Happily drink two in one sitting. Better than most winter seasonal beers, I would get another six-pack this winter."
"To me, it's a medium-bodied beer with a nice creamy mouthfeel. I could drink a few of these."
"D - I was surprised at how simple this beer is, I had a different set of expectations. The 6.7 ABV doesn't over power the beer. Overall I think this is a good beer and I am glad that I tried it."
"D - Not a bad holiday ale, although the aroma is definitely more pleasant than the actual flavor. I found this to be drinkable, but a bit muddled and too thick and syrupy overall."
"Great representation of the style. Consistently solid beer that works well on those cold winter nights."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Thick cookie dough colored head with some serious retention covers a thoroughly red/amber brew. Smells of citrus hops primarily, though also a bit of 'holiday spice'. The hop isn't too pronounced in the taste, but is well balanced with malt sweetness and spice. Good stuff- my favorite seasonal thus far in 09."
"M - Syrupy, viscous, thick and coats the mouth. Carbonation ripple."
"O - Wonderful beer, hints of spice from the noble hops round out the flavor nicely."
"Notes: I had a jubelale a few years back and didn't enjoy it. However, this was very pleasing."
"A fantastic winter warmer, so many layers and complexities. A nice malty backbone that is countered by a great combo of hops. The website says this is 60 IBUs, but you couldn't tell by tasting it, very nicely balanced and incredibly smooth. One of my favorite winter warmers and very unique, highly recommend."
"D- Not my favorite winter warmer but I'd have to say that's more because of my dislike of the caramel malt flavors than anything else. So if you're into those types of flavors you'll probably dig this one."
"Taste? The raisin (strong) and black licorice (more muted) really come through in the aged beer. They combine with the malty smoothness and the right touch of hops to really make you want to throw a sixer of Juble 09' into a vault and just wait. To summarize: My brother is a good person, and Jubelale ages really, really well."
"Taste is strong caramelised fruits (prunes, esp.), spicey raisiny alcohol, a faint whiskeyish hint and hint of rum, light burnt citrussy bitterness (orange & grapefruit), some light, toastiness (almost chocolatey), fruit jelly candy in the finish. Alcohol is evident but not overtly so and not harsh, bringing with it the faintly whiskey-rum elements, and spicey, warm raisiny alcohol that blend well with the rest. Feel is good, firm with faint oiliness yet not heavy, syrupy, or truly oily."
"The taste of this beer really does not do much for me. Really surprised by Deschutes, as all their other offerings have really impressed. Toasty malts mingle with a bit of citrus and pine resin hop bite, but there is not a whole lot else going on here. A bit on the thin side and it is not very warming. Meh."
"As usual, Deschutes made another excellent brew. Pours a very dark brown with red highlights if you hold it up to the light. Huge head, but I wasn't very careful in how I poured it... probably should have poured a bit slower. Has a scent of holiday spices, and lots of hops. Tastes like citrus like a lot of west coast hops beers do, with a lot of holiday spices. Yummy. I could drink these all evening if weren't so strong. Love the flavor!"
"Nice, but a bit too much hops for what I expected."
"M/D - Cloying but not to the point of undesirability. The sweetness of the malt dominates but very smooth and very drinkable."
"The flavor is a deal breaker. Everything was lined up perfectly to be a very solid holiday beer. The off taste ruined the drinking experience, I could not get past it. I would try this one again as I am not convinced what I am tasting is what was intended but at this time this one is not for me."
"Brown color pouring from the bottle, very red (almost purple) in the glass. Smell is sweet: alcohol and fruit. No alcohol heat in the taste, though. There is an earthy flavor that stands out and grabs attention, but doesn't overwhelm the malt and hops. A touch of tart fruit in the finish makes this a very nice beer. Other than Black Butte Porter, I haven't had many from this brewery, but this beer makes me realize I need to try more from Deschutes."
"Would like to session this next year."
"Would I buy more of it? - until Deschutes comes to Massachusetts I won't be able to get anymore of this tasty stuff. I will have to rely on trading and the occasional trip to the West Coast to satisfy my need for Deschutes."
"Overall: The mouth feel is alcohol warming, smooth, and a light astringency. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This is a pretty good winter except I feel it leans more towards a hoppier version. I like a good winter warmer to have a balance between the hops and the spice. I got the spice aroma but the flavor was lacking. I enjoy a good Dechutes beer but, this one is just okay."
"D - Very drinkable and I plan on having atleast a few tonight from the 6 pack I bought earlier."
"D- Spicy and malty. Not the worst but could be better. The ABV is fairly well hidden."
"Overall i likes this winter warmer from Deschutes. Would get it again."
"Very sessionable. One of the better seasonals this year."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable - IPA drinkable. Good cold night hopped seasonal."
"Poured a darker ruby crimson color with a medium off white head. Smelled of oranges, lemon peel, and clove. Taste surprised me, this years version seemed hoppier than last years. I am a hophead for sure but this tasted like it should have been more balanced. The hops have a very leafy, earthy taste to them which I didn't think meshed well with the style. Could have been more creamy, malty and complex like last years. Maybe it was too fresh, it could mellow so much more with a few months on it. Honestly this beer tasted like an American amber ale. Since it's listed as a Winter Warmer it will be judged as such-an above average beer but only an average example of the style."
"Pretty consistent. Sometimes inversion and mirror pond lack consistency."
"Drinkability - From my limited experiences with the style, it's nice to have a standard by which to measure others."
"Meh at best."
"overall, its not super complex, but a good beer. nice balance, alcohol is hidden."
"Time to start drinking the Christmas beers. This one pours dark amber with an initial inch of light tan head. Smells of caramel, lots of malts, and slightly floral hops. Tastes sweet and malty, again - caramel, slightly floral, with a faint bitter hop finish. Body is medium, slightly creamy, with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice winter brew that is highly sessionable."
"this beer finishes nicely with a good rich caramel malt that hangs on the palate and spicy floral notes of hops and classic winter spices. this is a great drinker for the winter months and will be enjoyed all through the season."
"Drinkability - This is a pleasant surprise. Very interesting beer and easily drinkable/sessionable, despite it being a relatively decent ABV beer. Glad I picked up the six pack that I spotted while in downtown Los Angeles. I am currently sitting outside on my balcony in low 60's weather enjoying this thoroughly. Just cold enough outside to feel like I'm back home in the Midwest enjoying a cool Autumn evening. Cheers everyone!"
"I like it, and it's cheaper than other microbrews. I'm from CO, and I'm used to paying 8, 9 bucks a pop for a sixer ... this one was 9, and it's from Deschutes. If you have Jubliation ale from O'Dell around, go with that. But if that's not there, go with this one."
"Drinkability: highly drinkable for a high ABV winter beer. Too drinkable, really; my memories of last year's new year's eve party are distinctly hazy due to this beer."
"Mouthfeel is a medium full that is nice and creamy."
"Taste kicks it up a notch with some spices added. A bit of malts and a more notable hop presence is noted. Somewhat reminscent of Arrogant Bastard in a way without the robust hopping. Not bad..."
"3.0 D: Would not be bad at all if it had some body."
"Lots of licorice, herbed anise, and mocha come through. Great texture. A little better I think than the bottle version."
"Drinkability- Packed with flavor and yet smooth. One of my favorite winter beers."
"D-This is a very drinkable winter warmer since it is not as heavy and filling as some others, even though the ABV is 6.7%. Saw my favorite local natural foods store has this on sale for $6.49 a six-pack, so I will be stocking up to share this festive ale."
"Poured cool into a glass this shows a hazy mahogany color with a big oatmeal bubblage on top and chunky lace. The aroma is delicious chocolate raspberry wheat with peaty malt and rye. The flavor is bright piney hops and herbal malt, tangy bread. Complexity that is tough to pin down, but very good. Very drinkable with a relatively middle body feel and some resinous qualities. Tastefully carbonated, all around drinkably enjoyable yule tide goodness. Well done."
"Drinkability- very nice, I had this with a ham dinner, had a really nice winter dinner, made me feel all christmassy, will drink again , definitely good winter beer"
"While I am not a huge fan of winter warmers (because of the strange spices) this is a great winter beer with enough hops and subdued spices to make it a truly enjoyable brew. Glad I picked it up and will do so in the future years to come."
"Tastes of roasted malts, (grape?) with a lot of smokiness and a slight hop kick. Body is on the think side. Extremely well balanced with decent drinkability. The fact that this brew is so well balanced is a slight disappointment to me as I would have liked more prominent flavors to come through, especially in the middle. Not bad for what it is."
"A really drinkable, subtle, well done holiday beer with the finesse of a beer from a great brewery like Deschutes. Bright flavors, perfectly balanced-- both in bitterness and spiciness. This beer reminds me of the 3 long winters I spent in Oregon, and the many, many beers consumed during those odd times."
"D- Another decent seasonal. I hope it does go on sale so I can have an excuse to buy a bunch more."
"D: I could drink this one all the way until christmas non stop..seriouly I only have one bottle and wish I had more because this is a very nice drinking beer"
"Very good holiday beer with just the right amount of malt and hop balance and not too much holiday spice."
"This is the finest product Deschutes has released since the last Abyss. Period."
"This is a good example of the style but nothing special. It's a little out of balance and doesn't really do much for me. Those who like the roast bitterness will probably enjoy it more than I."
"drinkability: pretty sessionable. affordable and a nice well masked calm abv."
"glassware: pint"
"D - A very enjoyable winter offering from Deschutes. I really like the balance and complexity of this one a lot. Nicely done brew!"
"Bottle: Poured a a dark cloudy brown color ale with a large foamy head with good retention but no lacing. Aroma of caramel malt with some notes of toffee and warming notes. Taste is very comforting with loads of caramel and toffee malt with some light dry fruits. Body is fuller then average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well done though additional dry fruits notes would have benefited this beer."
"Overall: Check this brew out!"
"D- Overall a decent winter warmer, could use a bit more sweetness for a winter beer, but that is just my opinion. I could see why people would like this."
"- Huge huge drinkability... and I am thankful for this brew. I will be buying a lot of it this year. The flavor is great, and the time is just right."
"Medium body with some fluff and fullness to the mouth, good carbonation and good punch from the alcohol make this warmer a pleasure too consume. The beer pic of this brew I took two years ago and am finally reviewing it...can't wait to taste this years offering...cheers!"
"2008 bottle. This is a fairly murky dark brown beer with a substantial head on it, about an inch tall despite a gentle pour. The aroma is dark cocoa, caramel, with a hint of fruitiness and a nice spicy hop aroma. The malt takes a background seat to a high bitterness, which I wasn't expecting. Malt is still present, with a nice caramel, roast, after a moment. Finish is roasty and dry."
"Over all this beer is pretty good. Drink ability is high especially for a winter warmer. Most might say this beer is past its prime at over 6 months old but i find it good still. Hops arent as powerful as earlier but still very much present. Looking forward to buying more of this beer in the fall"
"Poured cool into a glass this shows a hazy mahogany color with a big oatmeal bubblage on top and chunky lace. The aroma is delicious chocolate raspberry wheat with peaty malt and rye. The flavor is bright piney hops and herbal malt, tangy bread. Complexity that is tough to pin down, but very good. Very drinkable with a relatively middle body feel and some resinous qualities. Tastefully carbonated, all around drinkably enjoyable yule tide goodness. Well done."
"Deep chestnut in color. Nice sheet of tan belgian lacing. Notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, and cookie dough like malts. Previously mentioned spice flavors mixed with some pumpernickle bread and ghost like nuttiness. Some light hops keeps all the spice flavors in check. Some sweetness and slight nutty flavors in the finish. Mouth is somewhat light and slick in nature. This goes down easy and the spices and roasted flavors are not cloying at all. Liquid bread in nature. Very well done. This is a great beer today, and would be an excellent choice to hang out by the fire with in the cold winter months. I would sure seek this out again."
"D: A great Winter Warmer, one to pick up every christmas season, for sure."
"Oh. My. Wow. Whoa. Now that... I didn't expect! At least, from the aroma I was not expecting a big bitter hit. But there it is. This is like a malt/butter bomb of a Brittish ESB with a wack over the head of bitterness to it. Some citrusy fruitiness to it but not a lot. Enough to knock the score down. And the bitterness is just a bit much to be in balance. So, tone down the hops a bit and you're probably well on your way to an awesome beer."
"Poured a dark amber color with great head retention. Aroma is thick on the malt, and just slightly piny. The taste of the malt comes through immensely. Very bready and grainy. Tastes like it came straight out of the fermenter and into my mouth, very fresh. Mouthfeel compliments the taste, just a tad bit heavy."
"Continuing to appreciate the bold aroma of this one. It seems to balance and mellow as it warms (or as I drink)."
"Drinkability: A little too heavy for me to drink more than one, but otherwise fantastic! Keep it up Deschutes!"
"D: I wouldn't mind if it was winter all year long to be able to drink this."
"M + D: Soft carbonation, and a bigger body... Fairly full. Somewhat rich... alcohol comes across a little hefty though it's 'only' 6.7."
"D: A very good winter brew, look forward to it every year."
"I could drink many of these... and have. I'll definitely be picking up another case or two this season."
"If it were available it's one I'd look for every Winter."
"The first sip is a nice mix of spices and slightly fruity. It is a full bodied taste but not too thick. Perfect for winter in the Northwest.. and not too spicy like a lot of other winter ales but also warming. It almost reminds me of dates in that it is slightly fruity and sweet but not in overpowering way. It provides a very nice balance."
"Aging did this one well. I really enjoyed it fresh, but the aging made this very smooth and mellow."
"Very nice stuff. Great winter warmer that isn't just a mouthful of spice like some others can be. Great balance, very drinkable, and just plain tasty."
"D - This is a very nice change from the normal plethora of ""Winter Warmers"" which can really be just about anything as long as you put a Christmas tree on the label. This is like an overly hoppy Belgian dubbel with all of the fruit, toffee, and mild spice. Definitely a winter brew to keep on hand each season!"
"Overall it's in the same level as SN Celebrator, one of the mid-priced go-to winter brews I will look for."
"D) A very nice seasonal celebration, but not exactly Christmas morning."
"Overall, I expected more from this one. It's drinkable, but there just isn't a whole lot going on, here. Pretty mild, as far as winter warmers go."
"Pours a deep brown color. This beer looks amazing, I mean it looks like its gonna warm me up when I drink it. Nice light tan head with moderate lacing. Smells of malt with some floral hoppy notes. Taste starts out sweet caramel, and then goes to the floral and citrus of the hops, specifically some orange zest. Very full beer. Perfect on a cold winter day."
"A nice brown looking ale, with a hoppy deep malty nose and taste. It's not very complex, my only taste compaint, and a bit thin for my likes, but it has the good hoppy brown ale feel for a winter brew, maybe it just needs a bit more of the malt, get it up to 8ish percent for a real winner."
"Overall: I had this beer on tap back in November 08' and I have to say its way better on draft. Who knows if this six pack sat warm and in the sun for some time before it was refrigerated. This is a very quaffable winter warmer, not sweet and alcoholic as some can be. I love the biscuity and roasted flavors in this beer. A very balanced winter beer, enjoy it on draft if you can."
"Overall this beer is good. It tastes good and I'd definitely drink more. But, it's not as sweet as I feel a winter warmer should be and, generally, it's not very assertive for this style. Nor is there any noticeable warming effect going on. In light of all this, I think Jubelale could actually be passed off as a porter; afterall, more than anything else it's mild, smooth, and chocolatey--the color is the only major unporterlike thing. This makes me kinda disappointed in Deschutes. As one of the original powerhouse Northwest breweries they can do better. If I want another 6-pack of winter warmers this season, it will not be Jubelale."
"i wish there was more of a selection for the style as this is the only one (i think) that i have tried and it is fantastic!"
"This is one of the better winter beers I've had in a while and I'm not normally a fan of beers with decent spice profiles. This one pulls it off extremely well and I'm impressed overall."
"drinkability- a good beer overall goes down very easy."
"D - it's very tasty and easy to drink."
"Drinkability and other notes: texture and body gives this a major thumbs up on drinkability. I have to say that I even enjoyed the taste and feel of the creamy head. In some moments, the hops bit through the malts more than others, but I wouldn't call it overwhelming or unbalanced. I wouldn't have more than one, but I would easily recommend it to anyone who enjoys this style."
"Deep caramel flavors. Died down hops and grainy flavors, in addition to too much nutmeg and cinnamon, are the story of this beer. A sense of alcohol lingers and deminishes the quality of this beer, and I'm assuming that the rubber scent my nose found is caused by this alcohol presence. Thin and sticky mouthfeel. If offered another glass, I'd have to pass unless handed to me by the brewmaster himself from a fresh batch."
"Overall, one of my least favorites from Deschutes. I haven't totally figured out what I like in a winter warmer. Deschutes definitely went for the roasty, hoppy interpretation. Not bad, but I'm still looking for something more ideal."
"I'd like it better if it was less bitter and more balanced."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0812"
"Pours dark dark brown with a nice size tan head. Lacing lasts all the way down. Smell has hints of roasted sugars. Malted taste up front with very faint hop bite followed by a carmel sweetness. The mouthfeel is very smooth, just right. Overall, this is probably my favorite of the winter warmers. I'm glad it's come to Texas finally."
"Poured into straight pint glass. Poured with a 1 inch head, however there was sufficient carbonation for a bigger head if desired. Head was an attractive tan color. Head dissapated quickly, leaving a nice lace. Bold, spicy aroma that is very pleasing. Flavor matches aroma well, with a lingering roasty, spicy bite on the back of the tongue. Slightly thinner body than the style should have. Very drinkable. If you like a slightly stronger beer for a session this would work well. Another strong entry from a strong brewery."
"Poured a deep ruby red with a small dirtty white head. Nose is spicy with tons of roasted and heavily toasted malts. Taste is lots of crystal malts that you can easily taste other tasting notes were maple syrup, faint coffee, and a spiciniess to it. Mouthfeel was good, ABV is obvious but well hidden and overall good. A good warmer as usual..Jubel Ale is always good."
"Overall a decent winter warmer, but it seems a tad unbalanced. Not even close to being one of my favorite Winter Warmer's, but still a decent beer."
"This beer has the perfect delicate blend of malts and spices for great balance and complexity. This is my pick of the litter for Christmas Ales this year."
"D: Pleasantly complex enough to stay interesting without growing tired of all the flavors. Not a one-and-done beer."
"Pours a clear ruby red color with brown tones. Two fingers of thick foamy off-white head has good retention and leaves nice lacing stick. Smells of caramel, bananas, brown sugar, chocolate, spices, roasted malt, spicy hops, and chalk. Tastes of spicy hops right up front followed by sweetness of caramel and brown sugar, overripe bananas, chocolate, nutmeg, and a hint of cinnamon. Strong bready backbone with some nut notes along with a slight chalkiness and soy sauce bitterness towards the back end with a finish of ginger, bitter woodsy hops, and a touch of alcohol warmth. Medium in body with good effervescent carbonation. Smooth, sweet with solid bitterness in the finish. A good winter warmer with some nice holiday highlights. Easy to drink and one I look forward to every year."
"D: I enjoy drinking this ale. It is full flavored and balanced. Definately one I will have again."
"This one is nice and substantial in the mouth, with some sweetened coffee toasted malt flavor, baked apple, hot dark bread. Some nutty brown-ale flavors are complemented by the piney/herbal hops that lend just the right amount of bitterness."
"D - Good seasonal, better than most I've had; as mentioned, reminds me a lot of an English pale ale or brown ale, esp. the finish. Flavor of this beer really comes out as it warms. I'm sure I could drink a number of these."
"D- Very drinkable, goes down smooth and works well with spicy foods too."
"Pours hazy deep copper in color with a single finger head that dissipates to a foamy ring rather quickly. No lacing to note. The nose is delicous roasted malts with a mild amount of spice and toasted nuts. The taste is very similar to the nose minus the toasted nuts. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than many others in the genre, but so is the abv. I would say it is on the light side of medium body. Overall, this is a refreshing change of pace from the higher abv winter warmers. The roasted malt character and the mild spice compliment each other well."
"Drinkability: I wasn't too impressed with this one. It was decently drinkable, but a little too dry, a little too heavily spiced, and a little too uninteresting. It's worth a try though, even if it's not one that I'd go back to."
"A year in the bottle has produced excellent results, but I wouldn't go much longer (feel free to prove me wrong though!) Cheers and happy holidays!"
"Bottle pours a semi hazy dark maroon color with a medium lived beige head. Smell is toffee, tart malt and belgian yeast like spiced character. Smells like a dubbel. Taste is very reminiscent of a dubbel as well, with some dark fruity malt flavors and a yeasty spice component that I am not too big on. Good rich body and soft to medium carbonation, but the flavor is not my favorite. Still well done though."
"D: I could easily have 3 or 4 bottles of this in a sitting. It goes down very well."
"D-Very nice full of flavour, lots going on with this one but one is enough. Maybe a bit too busy?"
"D: Good seasonal hoppy beer. Goes down remarkably easy. For such a low price single, a far above average beer. Terrific seasonal. Paired well with some Ghiradelli chocolates and cranberry bread that Im snacking on."
"Pours deep mahogany with brown hioghlights and a thin tan head. Nutty, roasted malt aroma, with a bit of spice (nutmeg? cinnamon?). Flat mouthfeel. A truckload of caramel malt lingers throughout, which the hops have the fight through. Some coffee and roasted malt. It really keeps true to a English Strong Ale without falling into the ESB category."
"I'd call this a more than drinkable beer and I'd highly recommend it to beer lovers of all shapes and sizes."
"This is a review of the 2008 version. Pours clear red brown with thick off-white head. Very good looking, leaving a decent lace. Really not much to improve on there. Clean malty aroma with caramel, a little hops and a hint of banana. Nice full flavor of roasted malt and bitter hops with a good lingering bitter aftertaste. This is not as spicy as some of the other winter beers, but that is fine with me. Medium bodied with a strong carbonation and slightly alcoholic finish. This is one I am always sure to buy come December. Great by a warm fire or paired with holiday main courses."
"This beer could be pounded by those who enjoy the bitterness. It is not huge, but it isn't wimpy thin either. I find it easy to drink but the bitterness could slow down some."
"Happy Thanksgiving!"
"M/D: For such a hopped brew I would expect some mouth drying effects but actually it was pretty mild and there is a slight bittersweet feel left in the mouth but the hops are definitely left on the breath. The drinkability is very good and will go very well with my turkey tonight."
"Thought this was a brown ale after I poured it. Aroma is fairly light and creamy. Not much alcohol in the smell. Roasted flavors and caramel. You would not guess it were 6.7 % based on smell and taste. They mite want to bump it up to 7.2 % for a better winter warmer. Overall a very good beer."
"Overall impression: As someone who tends to favor the hops, I like this seasonal quite a bit. It is more aggressive than a lot of winter ales, I would say. It is wholly sessionable, going down very smooth. Another winner from Deschutes!"
"In the mouth it's well-carbonated, well-attenuated, and well-asdlkfated. Just a nicely crafted, mildly spiced, hop-forward winter-style brew. It's 70 degrees in Phoenix, but still..."
"Pours a wonderful tan colored head. Aroma is of caramel and malt and spices. Initial taste is wonderful, with hints of chocolate and a nice roasty background. But then the head dies down and the for some reason so does the taste. Hard to explain but it's missing some body and some malt taste. Ok, recommended."
"Winter Warmers aren't my favorite beers, but I will admit that this is pretty darn good. Jubelale pours a dark auburn with a handsome beige head. It smells of chocolatey malt and holiday spices, but it's a tad weak. The taste shows off these flavors better. I was most impressed that, while it tastes of winter spices, it doesn't try too hard or taste artificial at all. The flavor is blended into the beer far better than many holiday-time special ales. The feel is less watery than expected and holds up better than similar beers. I can definitely see enjoying a Jubelale or three on a cold December night. The label is quite arty, which I appreciate, but the artist perceives winter a bit different from me anyway. I like Deschutes Brewery. They're big but they still keep it interesting while avoiding the superfluous."
"The drinkability is good. I could have several more. Just wish I did not have to travel to Denver to get it...put then again it is okay! Overall a very nice effort. Even with the slightly higher ABV%, I could wrap up several of these pretty quickly!"
"Pours a mahogany amber color with a full finger foamy light tan head that decomposes like an ice cream float...a good amount of lacing from the top right down to the bottom of the glass. Smells sweet; dark fruit, molasses and spices. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is medium bodied. Full flavored, the figgy raison taste is complimented by a mild coriander spice. A real nice drinker, the 6.7% ABV is well integrated."
"taste is watery at first, lots of spice, some sour malt, some hops in the back, a little caramel, and ends a little bitter."
"D - Pretty good. Nice seasonal but not an all the time kind of beer"
"Pours a rich chestnut, and dark. Puffy white head settles to a 1/8 inch with big sticky rimming the glass. Smells fruity, of figs maybe some plums, maraschino cherries, rummy alcohol. Taste is a nice rich mix of flavors...up front is sort of a cherry and citric acid bite which falls off into more of a caramel and plum duff malt flavor. Gin-like juniper notes. Acidic hop bite sticks around and melds with a strong burnt character that i can't shake (even though i kind of want to). Thinner than i expected, though not watery. Drinks well, despite the aftertaste, which actually grows on me as i get through the glass. I might get some more, i might not...we'll see."
"D: A good winter session beer; probably my favorite winter warmer yet."
"The bottle poured dark rich amber with mahogany highlights, fluffy well sustained tan head settling into a pillowy sheet. It's got rich chocolate, malty nose with sweet dark fruit and alcohol. It's a delicious brew with intense roasted bitterness falling back on acidic hoppyness. Well rounded caramel sweetness with adequate carb and velvety mouthfeel, but it does not hold well to warming."
"You gotta try this!!"
"D: I thought this beer was spot on. Perfect for the winter season. My only regret was not pulling the trigger on a case instead of a six."
"Appearance has a dark brown amber with a fair head and nice lace. Smell is bready, caramel with dark malts and a touch of smoke. Taste is rich in malts with a good balance of hops. Mouthfeel has a medium+ that slides down with just the right amount of carbonation. Just as remembered from previous yrs. as a deep rich festive ale."
"D: yea, I am glad I bought the sixer of this. My new favorite winter warmer and I will buy this one again, you can count on it."
"Not a big fan of the spicy gingerbread cookie like flavors. 1 12oz was enough for me. A rare miss from Deschutes for me. When I say miss, I mean not the typical awesome brew from this brewery. Still okay."
"Overall, pretty good winter seasonal. Not my favorite beer from Deschutes, but still very good. Worth a try if you see it."
"Overall I was hoping for more out of this brew. Like some of the other beers from Deschutes, I felt it lacked something to make it a really good beer. It definately needed a bit more strength in the taste department. Not a bad beer, but only a tad above average. Plenty of other better seasonals out there."
"D: While this is an interesting beer, I wouldn't consider it an easy drinker."
"Overall, a decent winter warmer, but there are some better ones out there. Definitely give this a try if you have the chance though."
"Poured out into a pint glass, this robust reddish brown ale started with a low foam and reduced to a good lacing that lingered. The Maltiness tasted of dark cooking chocolate. While the aftertaste lost the malt and returned with a hopped chocolate taste."
"Drinkability: A nice seasonal beer that is not heavy on the baking spices. I would drink it again."
"What seemed promising turned into a bit of a let down, more of a dark pale ale than a winter warmer, although the hops are a nice touch, but that`s all there really is to it."
"d: A good Winter Warmer for the reasons listed above. My first experience with Jubelale is a good one. A suitable beer for the season."
"Mouthfeel drinks a lot like wine, or even brandy. It's pretty thick, and heavy, not a beer you want to sit and drink a six pack of, but should be enjoyed one at a time. Winter warmers are some of my favorite beers, and this is one of the best examples I've had of the style! I'll be drinking a lot of this one this holiday season!"
"Drinkability - cant get enough"
"Should go good with slow cooked red meats such as roasts."
"Excellent beer for fall or winter warming."
"I could have sworn I'd reviewed this one before, but I guess not. My in-laws actually live in Bend, so I am lucky to get a sixer of this every christmas. God Bless 'em! Anyways, the highlights for this one to me, are the taste and smell. The smell is a nice smokey malt, mixed with a hoppiness. I would also say a bit of caramel to go along with it. The taste has a little more pronounced hop to it, but it's quickly balanced out by the strong malts. All in all a great beer for the sweltering cold nights in Charleston."
"This is a great winter warmer. I'll always have a special place in my heart for Anchor's OSA, but I still look forward to Jubelale every year."
"Cheers"
"Overall I thought this one was very well done. A good, classic take on the style that definitely did not disappoint. I would have no problems with getting a good dose of this one any year. It really held together well and impressed the heck out of me. Solid beer all around."
"this brew pours up an amber color with an off white head...the nose is dark malts...nice malts....the taste is kinda sweet...also dark malts in the mix....this is a pretty decent Holiday Ale...I would suck this one down again..."
"The palate opens with a wonderful balance between sweet caramel, brown sugar, a firm hop bite (mostly earthy) and the leather notes. The finish is just out of this world, the balance that shines on the palate is also present. The leather and brown sugar linger on the finish, this beer is beautifully structured. Arguably the best winter warmer I've had."
"Drinkability: Why, it's downright tolerable! A decent, stand-up member of the winter warmer league."
"D - not too sure it's very sessionable b/c of the sweetness, but a good way to start or end the night"
"In any event, a nice brew, at a nice price. Would have liked to have had in the winter time. Mouthfeel would be thin for a porter, but this is a ""winter warmer", right?"
"Pours a lovely chocolate brown with white head and a glassfull of web-and-dot lacing. Aroma, initially very delightful, still malty and spicey as it airs out. Taste is chocolate, more thick initially and then middling. Dry taste, a bit of an old ale, but never drying. Rich and interesting.Thanks Dr. Jay for 2007 version."
"Although unusual to have this time of year, I have to say it's a reminder of something to look forward to when the weather turns cooler this fall."
"Taste starts out malty and finishes with a bitter aftertaste, rather weird for a winter warmer and a bit refreshing, strong buttery slickness that makes it go down smooth."
"Pours a beautiful rust caramel color with a slight head, and light lacing and slightly under carbonated. Smells of bourbon and hops, and hints of wood. Taste of rich malts, wood, and bourbon. Not a very strong ale at 6.7%. Not bad and fairly balanced."
"I don't usually care for Winter Warmers but I really enjoyed this brew... My first from Deschutes and its a good one.."
"D: Definitely below average."
"Drinkability - a fine drinker for the winter, I like it."
"Another winner from Deschutes, can they make a bad beer?"
"Pours a cloudy, deep amber color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a sweeter maltiness, alcohol and, somewhat sugary. In the taste, a sweeter malt, and nice fruity hints. A smooth, with a small bite, and a lighter bodied mouthfeel, and a dry alcoholic and fruity aftertaste. Kind of light for a warmer. Nice though and quite easy to drink."
"Brown color with a fizzy tan head. Smell was a faint mixture of caramel, medium malts and earthy hops. Taste had some very mild malts with a similar amount of musky hops. Nice body and heavy carbonation. A good beer to wash down a burger. Well balanced and quite refreshing."
"D: Very tasty and complex. My palate might not be formed enough to give this brew justice. Probably the best winter warmer I've had."
"Beautiful colour, a deep red brown, quite clear with a thin cap of yellow/beige foam. Fine bubbles clung to the glass in sheets, becoming a little more spotty as the glass emptied. Nice maltiness in the aroma, a combination of bread crust and caramel, maybe a bit of chocolate/cocoa too. Citrusy hops provided a contrast in the nose, with a bit of dried fruit and alcohol providing a warming depth. Same in the flavour, but it's more difficult to pick things apart. Solid bitterness throughout, quite balanced, with more prominent nut and cocoa at first, more alcohol warmth towards the end. There was a brief flash of mint too. Finished with a chocolatey, roasted maltiness. Nice texture, smooth and nearly full bodied with creamy carbonation that was just on the soft side. A really nice winter warmer, great balance, super easy to drink."
"Pours a deep ruby red to brown. Two finger chunky head that dissipates after a few minutes but sticks around on the side of the glass. Smells of sweet roasted malts with a slight citrus scent. Warms you as soon as it hits your mouth. Slight alcohol burn but mostly sweet and rich. Some spicy notes with chocolate and coffee hints. The mouthfeel is a little rough on the palate but it is still pleasurable. Definitely the perfect beer for tonight. Its 5 degrees outside right now with a windchill of -12."
"The body is a touch closer to mid than full. Carbonation is light but some bite that I associate with some of the spice. Overall an easy drinking beer but there are a lot of good winter warmers around me that this becomes an average beer."
"This beer is very drinkable. I can put back a few of these before I gt sick of them."
"D: As I said above, this was my favorite holiday beer. Its strength would keep me from drinking more than two in a sitting, however. After my initial experience with this beer, I hurried to the store to grab another six before it was gone for the season."
"Wow, what a great Winter Warmer! The festive warming character of this guy can't help but bring a smile to your face as you drink it. I know it did to mine. Now I wish I had more than this one bottle. Great stuff as usual from Deschutes."
"Very 'American' Winter Warmer style, which I prefer over the English. More of the toffee/brown sugar/molasses with a nice hop backbone. Perhops some spruce tips also and maybe a hint of cocoa? Very enjoyable and perfect for the setting."
"Poured a deep reddish-brown hue, beautiful head, settled after a few minutes. lots of dark roasted malt aromas, slight caramels, fig, bitter cocoa, a hint of raspberries on the finish. Taste is as appealing as the smell. Malty, thick mouthfeel, fruity notes on the finish. Leaves some sugary stickyness on your lips. This winter warmer brought a smile to my face, Brost! Cheers!"
"D: I wish Deschutes distributed out here. This is another excellent brew I've had from them. I'd get this as a winter warmer every year if I could."
"Pours a four finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good sticky lace. Cloudy brown/amber color. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Roasted malt nose. Flavor is burnt brown sugar with hops in the background. Nice beer when there is two feet of snow on the ground. $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Liquid Solutions Oregon City, Or."
"Bottle from BevMo. Dark, deep amber in color, thin, khaki head, and appears semi-filtered. Bouquet is slightly oaky, with strong scents of raisin, plums, and black currants. Taste is oaky, little gingery, slightly bitter, and the scent of sweetness from the raisins and plums disappears. Mouthfeel hits the bitter tastebuds and is slightly warming. Drinkable beer, which suits winter. Probably less bitter out of the tap and could age a little longer."
"A nice mixture of bread & bubbles. Pretty light on the stomach for 6.7%. An easy repeat, had I asked for more then 1 in the trade. D'oh! :P"
"Popped the crown-top on a 12oz. bottle and poured into a standard pint. Great mahogany in color with a thick tan one finger head. The headed faded into a nice tight lace. Smells of potent spicy hops. The hops also a very apparent in the taste, backed with a mild malt backbone. I taste hints of Vienna and caramel malts. Quite bitter but not over done. Medium body and carbonation. A very drinkable winter warmer."
"This is an incredible winter brew from the pacific northwest, Deschutes brewery consistantly puts out strong beers and this one is no different. There are several options for winter brews in the oregon area, but this one I think is the best, very warm and dark for those winter night, I would recommmend it."
"Drinkability is pretty good, as I really enjoy Jubelale, probably my favorite winter warmer, although it might be a bit to rich for some. Rich and full bodied, with enough alcohol to actually warm, yet not spiced out like some kind of xmas tea. Served at cellar temp."
"Pretty full in body, with surprisingly adequate carbonation considering the relatively small head. Very smooth. Easy to drink and great for a cold winter night."
"This is my favorite of the season....so far. Still alot out there to get at. Pours from the bottle a nice brown color with a dark, tan head. The head diminishes quickly and lurks on the surface all the way down the glass, leaving some heavy lacing. The smell is lightly hoppy with the bulk of aroma being malty, sweet, and smoky. There is also a hint of coffee in the smell that grabs your attention. The taste is definitely conveys a smoked malt flavor that reminds you of campfires in late fall. The smoked flavor also adds some bitterness to the beer, working with the hops to balance the strong malt bill. The mouthfeel is vicous with a carbonation level that is not too aggressive, letting the tongue taste everything there is to offer. The drinkability definitely lends itself to the weather. The colder is gets, the more I want to drink this beer. It creates a warmth in the belly that I just can't get enough of."
"This seems to have been an ongoing struggle for deschutes. This winter ale is very malty with coffee bean and breadish sharpness. It pours dark brownish red, with pretty good head. first sip is automatically malty. it finishes with some spice. very similar to hibernation ale by great divide, but more nutty and malty"
"Very good beer."
"I've been trying out various seasonal beers and decided to give this one a try. I have to say that I like this beer and that it has a nice balance between malt and hop flavors. I also like the crispness on the finish that doesn't leave a heavy or chalky feeling in the mouth. Overall, it's a pretty good beer and not a bad pick up for a seasonal beer to go outside the usual pale ale or IPA's that I tend to drink."
"D: There is a complex and pleasant bitterness to this brew that I like. It's very balanced."
"Pours a pure copper with a frothy thick lacing tan head. Smells of candied fruit, caramel with a barleywinesque hop character. Tastes of mild fruit, malty, and a very bitter and lingering finish. Thin in the mouth, slightly watery. Very drinkable and a nice twist on the style"
"Pains me to have to do this, I love Deschutes, but this winter style ale just doesn't hit the spot for me. It's not a bad tasting beer, which is why I give the drinkability a fair score, but the taste is just average, and you could even say below average for a ""festive winter ale."""
"A very good winter warmer."
"The beer pours a rich mahogany color with good head retention and lacing. Lots of sweet malt on the nose, but with overtones of sherry and walnuts. Smells very much like a fine old, aged English ale. The beer is very smooth on the palate, with flavors of nuts and sweet malt. There is also some noticeable bitterness in the finish, and I get nuances of cherry and apple. Abv. is pretty well disguised, but still this beer is fairly sweet and rich, so one is probably all I could do. Seems as if this beer has a bit less roastiness then in previous years, but is once again the usual good, solid effort from Deschutes. Very nice beer."
"This brew is a really good separation from the herd on most PNW winter brews.... Middle of the road across the board, but still finding itself knee-deep in complexity. Deschutes is always around in Boise, and always a refrigerator beer in my house. Jubelale is one of those beers that I never give much respect to, but I should."
"I could down a couple of bottles of this on cool nights like tonight. It definitely warms the head and belly. One of my favorite winter warmers."
"Not my favorite beer, but a pleasant experience. I will probably buy at least one more sixer this holiday season for the brutally cold Southern California winter..."
"D: I would buy to share as a winter treat but would not consider this a treasure to stash for my personal pleasure. Not a session brew but one that could easy satisfy for one to three in a row."
"D - not fatiguing, I'd set my limit at about 3 which is good."
"D - I like this beer. It's not one of my usual styles which is making it difficult to identify everything that is going on in this somewhat complex ale. Yes, this is what I would have imagined as a 'winter warmer'."
"-Rick"
"2007 batch. Poured into pint glass, pours a clear dark, dark brown however when held to light its has amazing ruby hints. Very small off-white head that doesnt last very long, some lace left behind. Smell is interesting, just a slight whiff and I get mainly a bread/earth smell which isnt too flattering however with a deep whiff I get a burst of hops which I do like. Taste is good. I'm having a hard time pinpointing it but a nice mix of chocolate, caramel, roasted grains, and a ""burnt"" taste. Very thick, creamy mouthfeel leaves a coffee like aftertaste. Overall a pretty good beer. I dont think I'll be buying another 6 pack but I will enjoy the one I got."
"Recommended if you like beer that heats you up and makes you feel like you ate two dinners, another above average beer from Deschutes out of Oregon"
"Keeps you warm on a hot winters day. I like it."
"Pours a deep ruby color, thin light tan head settles fairly quickly, good lacing. Smell is fairly sweet, a faint pear like aroma, along with some caramel. Taste is sweet malt, with hints of hop flavor, but this one is clearly all about the malt. Mouthfeel is very nice, smooth, and easy finish, with a nice and lasting aftertaste. Goes down easy. Glad I picked up a six pack of this, when that runs out, i may just have to pick up some more!"
"Overall: Not the best Deschutes has to offer, but very good nonetheless. I enjoyed drinking this unique beer and look forward to revisiting it when I pop the second one which currenlty resides in the fridge."
"D: A good drinkable Winter Warmer, though I do remember liking the 2006 version better, the label was more inviting that year too, although that has nothing to do with the beer itself. Overall, I enjoyed it, will probably buy a few more bottles this fall and winter."
"The taste is very malty up front, kind of sweet but not really, and it's followed by some good spiciness which includes nutmeg and a light touch of corriander. The best way to taste the spice is by swishing the beer in your mouth...man, *that's* tasty. It has a medium mouthfeel and the carbonation is light to medium and it finishes with a mild bitter kick. Very easy to drink because, whilst having loads of flavour, it's just so darn smooth and drinkable. Jubelale has never failed to impress me over the years even though the recipe seems to change a tad every year. It's my favourite Winter Warmer and I could drink this all day/night long. See some, buy some."
"Drinks good, not quite as good as previous years, but I could still happily session on this"
"Drinkability is good. This years vintage seems to be a notch or two below some of the prior vintages. It just seems too lean for my tastes. Still a nice beer though."
"Pours a nice brown color, nice carbonation, nice small tan head, nice sticky lacing and some small islands hanging around. The nose is mostly on the malt side, with some caramel and spice. The taste is malty, spicy, and alot of caramel. Nice little warming effect going down. Drinkable, a nice WW in my book."
"D - Not my favorite winter warmer (see Odell's Isolation Ale for that), but it's tasty and malty enough for a cold winter's night."
"Good, low carbonation. Smooth drinking. A very nice winter ale; one of the better ones I've had recently."
"Tawny red color with a filmy tan head that doesnÂ’t appear to be going anywhere any time soon. The taste is hard to describe but some indistinct spices and malty flavors. Easy to drink but it may be a little early for winter beers, even here in Colorado."
"A great session beer for the colder winter months. Better than last year's IMO and I really dig this year's art work on the label. Bring on the snow!!!"
"Drinkability- This is a great holiday beer. Nice toasty malts and a bit of spice are awesome warmers. Grab a sixer of this, start the fire and pop on a football game. Awesome Sunday!"
"Totally drinkable, but not something I need to revisit this year."
"Pours a dark caramel/garnet with a bountiful cream colored head that leaves tons of sticky lacing all around the glass. Aroma is distant, but nice. Roasted malts and various hops. Wow the taste is even better. A coffee-like bitterness appears along with that of the hops to counterweight the strong malt presence that reveals itself in the form of toffee, lightly sugared coffee, raisins and perhaps a hint of Gala apple. This is much better than what I remember of last year's version. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with the perfect amount of light carbonation. This will be a tough act for the rest of the winter warmers to follow."
"I suppose it's an appropriate mouthfeel for the style, full bodied with very light carbonation, but I find it a bit syrupy, though the astringent finish saves it from being unpleasant. However, despite the extreme tastiness of this brew, I couldn't see myself having more than one or two of these in a session, though I suppose I'll have to try out this hypothesis next winter back at the fortieth parallel.... Again, thanks Deschutes!"
"Drinkability would be pretty high on my behalf because of the flavor quickly leaving making you want more. This is a guzzler."
"This one is pretty close to the Cold Mountain Winter Ale from Highlands. Maybe not quite as complex but very well balanced and good in its own right. Pours a nice shade of brown with a head that doesn't want to leave. Good lacing down the glass as well. The smell was sweet, malts and spices abound. Kind of like a sugary brown ale with some twang to it. It's crazy how well the hops balance this brew in taste. You get a sweetness from the malts that is followed by a stunted bitter taste, accompanied by spicy fruit flavors. I do think of the holidays when I drink this beer. Mouthfeel is spicy, sweet, and festive if you could say that about a beer. I enjoy the lingering flavors. Good drinkability for a Winter Ale. Pretty solid all around and highly recommended if you're interested in something different. Thanks Talisker!"
"M&D - 2 years is too much, this beer begs for a bit of balance, seeing my old review fresh to 1 year cellared is ideal. smooth it was, but previous bottle was better"
"D - Solid winter warmer but slightly boring."
"2006 vintage. Dark brown body with tinges of ruby red hues showing around the edges. Mild retention in the head, leaving some lace around the sides. Aroma of caramel malts standout above the hops. Taste is roasty and mildly malty, finishing with some hop bitterness. Medium-bodied and very drinkable. A solid winter warmer."
"D: One beer would be more than enough, the flavor is nice but there is too much going on and nothing really comes into focus."
"tastes sweet with oranges, then really drying. Almost puckering...not sour, but dry with mild sour. Wow. Nice experience. Woody hop character, toasted malts, cardboard oxidation (is a contributor, not a detractor). tannic rough aftertaste,t hen fades quickly. Smell was richer than the taste. Clean alcohol can be found with searching. Picking up some nice aged qualities in the malt. Md-thick, but smooth, mouthfeel. Dextrinous. Medium carbonation. I wish the finish weren't so dry."
"But still a suberb beer. Now on my list for future years."
"I visited Deschutes a 12 years ago and love their beer! This beer has mellowed since I bought this a few months ago"
"drinkability: high"
"D---The taste did not agree with me but the aroma was outstanding."
"Drinkability - Slightly above average for Deschutes but I've had better. This is one of Oregon's best breweries but this year's Jubelale doesn't seem to stack up to past years. Definitely drinkable but there are other winter warmers that match or exceed this one."
"D- i wouldn't recommend for sessions, becomes increasingly delicious as its drank, but its filling as well, awesome seasonal."
"Drinkability - 3.5"
""
"The 2006 edition. Pours a dark, ruddy brown with a thick tan head that laces the pint glass nicely. It smells of dark cherries and hops, the contrasting smells balancing each other out nicely. Taste really doesn't have any of the yeast's fruit, which is a bit odd. Tastes more like a pale ale than a winter warmer. Assertive flavoring hops but not too much bittering. Nice but not what I was expecting. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy but then finishes a bit thin. Drinkability is pretty good. The hops are refreshing without being so bitter as to be limiting. All in all, a decent brew."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is just shy of medium bodied. The carbonation isnt excessive. I think I would have liked a bit heaver body. This is a very nice beer. I could see easily sessioning this beer during the winter."
"2006 bottling. My second Deschutes beer this week, and my second ever! Many thanks to b0ldfacelies for including this in the BA Secret Santa '06 package he sent me. Man, does this brewery ever have some nice-looking bottles. I can't get over the raised/embossed hop vine detail on the glass. Anyway, my nonic fills up almost to the top with a glowing auburn red beer and a thick and frothy manilla head that has an ever-so-slight peach sheen to it. Did I say peach? That happens to also be the first scent I pick up in the bouquet, along with the zesty character of some slightly citric hops, an understated mineral water aroma, and a tiny bit of crystal malt sugariness. Clumpy, webby lacing is left as I sip what is at first a sweet and fruity mouthful. This juicy sweetness is soon muted by some ruggedly bitter hops, all piney and acrid, with a metallic grapefruit rind character dominating the finish. Juicy mouthfeel, full-bodied and dextrinous with a bit of stickiness. A hearty hop-filled winter ale that won't trip your trigger if your looking for a spiced beer, but certainly good for those who love hoppy bitterness balanced by a non-intrusive but capable malt sweetness."
"Pours dark amber to cola brown with a small cream head that fades to a small covering of bubbles. Aroma is a sweet cola-y maltiness with a little light fruitiness, raspberry mainly. Taste is a nice roastiness up front followed by the cola and fruit sweet maltiness. Finishes with a nice steady dry and light bitterness. Easy winter drinker, well balanced beer."
"I normally love winter warmers, but I feel as if this particular brew puts the emphasis on in the wrong parts of the style. There isn't enough body to hold up the bitters, despite a beautiful nose."
"All in all a nice seasonal offering from Deschutes."
"Very good winter warmer. Nicely balanced and easy to drink."
"Thanks, younger35, for the chance to taste this one again"
"Medium, body supported by smooth, active conditioning compliment the strong flavor and while alcohol is well hidden, two of these is all I can muster Â– appropriate for an evening sipper on a cold night. Another solid standard from a great brewery and one I look forward to every year. Pecan Pie, Bread Pudding or dare I say, a Fruitcake would do quite well with this brew."
"A very drinkable winter warmer."
"D - This is definitely an ale that sparks thoughts of the Holidays, with a quality and balance that is a joy to the world, indeed! High ratings across the board speak for themselves when it comes to drinkability. Delicious."
"D: Great ale for the holiday season. I'm still partial this year to Sierra Nevada's Celebration Ale, but this is very merry indeed!!!"
"Body was appropriate and I could sip on these, but IÂ’m not gonna be looking for this in the future. Que sera, sera."
"The drinkability is very good, a big thanks to Flexabull for a great beer from a good trade. Prosit Mk"
"Overall: This beer is good, but I have had better. I doubt I will buy it again."
"Overall a delicious beer to sit back and warm up with. It has a complexity, that is not overwhelming, and well balanced."
"Now, maybe this will help me write my philosophy paper..."
"The thick to thin feeling is accompanied by an overall velvety finish. I would like a crisper finish, but this is nice."
"D: I'm not a huge Deschutes fan so this beer came out of left field. I wasn't expecting much but was more than pleasantly surprised by how well this beer was put together and played out. Best American winter beer of the season IMO."
"A sweet and spicy aroma is released as soon as the cap is removed. It pours with a large tan head and a reddish-brown body. The taste is roasted, spicy (clove, nutmeg), sweet and heavily malted. Hops are there, but fairly subdued and in the background. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium-bodied; pretty rich stuff, but extremely drinkable, and not overly filling."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle. The color was dark orange and clear, with a thin foamy head. It smelled malty with not much hops in the aroma, no spices were used either which seems rare in USA winter warmers. The taste was actually unremarkable for me, I expected more based on previous reviews. Maybe it's important to let the beer cool to some temperature before the flavors improve, if that's the case I didn't reach the critical temp. So-so beer."
"Notes: This is a nice change of pace beer. It shows alot of winter warmer characteristics but remains drinkable due to the restraint on the spices. Don't get me wrong its kicked up but it remains a grounded yet delightfull offering. Winner and reccomended."
"D: Couldn't pick a better beer than this for a chilly night. I think that some winter ales try too hard and end up being heavy and chewy, but this one is brewed just right. I could easily down a couple on a winter eve."
"Overall, a very tasty beer, and a nice winter warmer. I'd buy it again."
"D: A nice warm-up for the winter season. Enjoyable and reasonable ABV for more than one. A good local choice for me..."
"Good beer but I prefer Anderson Valley and Bridgeport's offering for a regular purchase in the Winter Warmer category."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and rich with a tingly hops and carbonation that leaves the mouth clean and dry."
"2006 Version. Deep, ruby color. Head is thick and tan, with good retention leaving a pristine lace. The aroma is a bit weak, with notes of raisin and other dark fruit plus mild alcohol. The flavor is dry with a lightly sweet and toasty maltiness. Hints of caramel, maple, and moderate hops present. The finishing bitterness is mild yet exquisite. Full bodied, but not chewy. The carbonation is solid, smooth, and lightly foamy. I really enjoyed this year's Jubelale, and would definitely recommend it..."
"Drinkability is unusually low for me. After about 1/2 to 2/3's of a bottle I lost interest. I figured it was a one-time thing, but after 3 bottles I've ended up losing interest before finishing them. I think because it's so heavy up-front, it overwhealms you and then fills you up."
"Mouthfeel is a little dry and tart, not as big and creamy as I remember the last couple years of Jubelale, that was one of this beer's standout qualities. Drinkability is still good though, and this is one of the better Winter seasonals out there."
"This is a drinkable beer. OK but not great. I'll look for it in a bottle."
"Notes: One of the top true (unspiced) winter warmers in the US, a must year after year. A bottle full of holiday cheer or just something to warm your soul."
"Crisp mouthfeel, nicely conditioned so as not to be acidically carbonated or too flat. Very nice: much easier to drink than in previous years. Very well done!"
"I have liked this beer a lot every year IÂ’ve had it. I can say that I find the 2006 batch more to my liking than the 2005, and definitely more than the 2004. I would need to do a vertical tasting to really be sure of the specific differences. I think itÂ’s a little crisper this year and the hops are perhaps not as drowned out by the malt as last yearÂ’s batch. The spiciness provided only by the crystal malts and no actual spice additions is spectacular as always. This is the quintessential winter beer."
"This beer is very very drinkable and can really catch up with you. Its very easy to have 3 or more of these....really."
"A deep ruby in color without much head. It has a sweet, complex smell. The taste is also complex, but a little light. There are fruity sweet notes. This beer is much more English in flavor that American. It has a good body that's nice and smooth."
"Mouth: Sweet flavorful entrance of a light & mild malt. Has a tinge of grapefruit as it goes through the mouth and continues in the swallow with a lasting hop bitterness. Not too bitter but fitting for the beer."
"A Dorchester slant in the Deschutes mountains, and extremely drinkable."
"The result? Jubelale is not too bad but alltogether it's rather standard."
"Another good one in the Deschutes line."
"This beer pours a dark reddish brown with a frothy off white head that holds nicely. The smell is not very strong but hops and cinamon can be detected. The taste is mainly spicy which consists mostly of cinamon again. Hops can be detected on the back of the throat as the beer goes down. There is a decent thickness about this beer but the carbonation is not bad either. Overall, it is one of the few winter warmers I have come in contact with that actually tastes like a beer and not spiced holiday drink. This is not the best winter warmer but one of the better ones."
"Deep mohogany color with very little coffee colored head. Slightly citrusy aroma with a little spice and caramel. Crisp hop flavor folowed by caramel, spice, and molasses. Well carbonated with a medium mouthfeel. A favorite winter beer of mine, this is a great one to sit out and enjoy in the cool desert night."
"Drinkability is VERY good."
"Beer is good. Happy Winter beering."
"Release 2002: On the pour a deep sanguineous color, the head modest in size, spumescent in texture, the color a light tan, as it dissipates it leaves behind a nice coating of lace to seal off the glass. Tons of malt in the nose, caramel sweet, light hint of hops and yeast, quite clean and fresh with the start sweet and loaded with malt, the top is middling in feel. Finish has a light to moderate carbonation, the hops pounce on the taste buds, crisp and sharp, and the aftertaste quite dry. I think this is my most favorite beer from Deschutes, nice to have a source once again."
"The taste is more of the same and as the description on the bottle says. It is a nice warm, hoppy beer that is easy to drink with a pretty nice balance between the hoppiness and smoth malt character."
"D: I think that winter seasonals are really not my cup of tea, because looking at some of the other reviews of this one, it seems like people really like it. I'm glad I bought a single bottle of this because its a little heavy for me."
"Very nice approachable beer. Well rounded and nice to drink."
"Nice work Deschutes!!"
"The new label fits this beer perfectly. It pours a clear ruby with a two finger head. The head retention is better then average. The nose has pine, cider and toffee. The taste is equally sweet and bitter with a bit of spice and there's a lot of chocolate in here. It starts off with sweet caramel, roasty malts and chocolate and finishes with piney bitterness. This is a beer that I could just about drink day in and day out without getting bored."
"Definitely, one of the more drinkable winter warmers I've encountered and certainly one of the tastiest. Very well balanced."
"Decided to try this after seeing the high reviews, it is highly available here in WA state and seems to be the winter warmer of choice alongside Pyramid Snowcap. Poured a very unusual and quite beautiful shade of ruby or perhaps garnet, quite striking visually which i was not really expecting. Taste was earthy and balanced with strong suggestions of woodspice and heavy herbal notes. Impressive job from Deshutes to accomplish all those classic Winter Warmer spicy flavors without actually spicing the brew. Overall a brew deserving high praise, although not my personal favorite style I am still able to appreciate this effort from deschutes."
"One thing I like about winter seasonal beers is that there really are no hard and fast rules about what it should be like. Every year brings a new wave of awesome fresh suds, almost always using new recipes varying widely from brewer to brewer. Deschutes is a solidly competent brewery so I don't anything less than good beer for their winter seasonal. This one has very nice balance, with just enough hops to offset the sweet maltyness. The malt profile is complex, rich and grainy with a hint of toastiness and dried fruit. The hop character is clean and brisk with a mild woodsyness that lingers like slow stroll through the forest. Very nicely done."
"Mouthfeel was my favorite part. At first it tingled. Kind of like the way that cinnamon in curry tingles. After a bit that went away and it became quite creamy and rich. Very hearty. A great beer for a cold late fall evening."
"I really enjoyed the pint and it is very quaffable. Another solid brew from Deschutes and one I'd gladly enjoy again."
"CheersÂ…"
"Round and chewy defiantly a mouth full but not overdone. Aftertaste is hits at some of the pie spice but very soft and warm."
"Drinkability: While there's really no sessionable WW, IMHO, this one comes close. Very well made with a surprisingly rich flavor; at the top of my list among the ""mass market"" winter beers out there this year. A great value."
"Overall I'm happy I got it. It's the type of beer that is made better when you drink it while you sit and watch the snow come down. (Like I did today)"
"Overall: Not my favorite style by any stretch, but this is a pretty tasty winter warmer I'd like to have again."
"Tasty and well balanced, I thought the malt bay be a bit strong due to the style, but it is actually about right. Carbonation is about perfect. Great winter drinker."
"Pint at Papago in Scottsdale, AZ."
"Thanks to waldowin for the sample. Nice looking chestnut color. Somewhat hazy in appearance. Low aroma-malt with some spiciness to it. Full malty flavor. Mild spiciness behind it all. Not too sure if there are spices added but it comes across as though there are. Mellow lingering bitterness. Decent body. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Reminds me of some of the better ESBs I have had in my life."
"The 2005 edition has a dark brown colour (which I definitely wouldn't describe as golden!) with a generous head and a creamy, caramel smell with a herbal tone. A roasted malt flavour and a creamy feel give way to a cleaner slightly herbal flavour. This is very pleasant and would make a good winter session beer despite its strength."
"The first thing I noticed was that the beer was served with a beautiful finger of head that just peaked up over the glass and retained throughout the course of the entire drinking. Lacing was left down the side of the glass as I drank the beer. The beer itself was a very deep red color with very little carbonation. The aroma was predominately of sweet maltiness but it did include some hint of spices. The flavor was unexpected, and I wish I could give it a 4.75. It begins malty and as the beer finishes over the pallet with a bitterness and alcohol finish. Complex and full bodied, the beer retains a really high drinkability. A very good winter brew, and the first beer I'm fighting myself not to give a 5.0 in the taste or drinkability areas of the review. A real pleasure."
"I really liked this beer. It's hearty, but not overly spiced liked most winter seasonals. I found it very enjoyable and drinkable enough to be a good session beer. In fact, I would like to see this available year-round. Very good, definately recommended."
"I kept wanting more form this beer. The Look and smell was good but the taste didnÂ’t follow through. I think the malt covered up some of the flavor. The Christmas spice ale flavor was there but very hard to detect. The IBUs were at 60 and the alcohol % was 6.7. Not a bad beer but I expect more form a seasonal."
"Overall impression: A very nice winter beer. I enjoyed this last year, and will be keeping quite a bit in the fridge this season as well."
"2005 is out and ready to drink. This is a great beer. Dark reddish brown color with a huge head and a great overall aroma. The hint of smokyness with a light hopps flavor and a huge malt presence make this a great winter warmer. I will be getting more for the deep winter months."
"Definitely a good brew for winter. This will go alongside the Black Butte Porter as a daily drinker for me during the cold months."
"Had on tap at 'bones. Pour was of cloudy chesnut. Aroma came across as low and carmelly. I found that tastewise it was malty, with some cocoa powder notes. Had a caramelly finish. Medium body. Didn't knock my socks off, but kept me warm while drinking."
"Jubelale is a good, solid winter beer, but pales in comparison to my last winter warmer from the Pacific Northwest, Dick's Double Diamond Winter. If you're looking for loads of flavor and a big, luscious body, look elsewhere. This Deschutes seasonal can hold its own though, and kept me interested all the way to the bottom of the bottle."
"Pours a dark brown body with a head that fades fast. The smell is very faint, average roasted grain, floral hops. Tastes of medium malt, tart hops, a bit of overall sweetness, and a coffee aftertaste. Mouthfeel is watery and smooth. Drinkability is average. Overall a solid winter ale."
"This is a nice beer that I bought just before Christmas. This one is the last of the two six packs that I had shipped to me. I will be looking for more next year."
"Reviewed from a 12oz bottle drank on 12/20/04 with a best by date of 3/10/05. Pours out with a dark brownish red body with a small light tan head floating atop. No lacing was left around the glass. Aroma was sweet caramel malt and a spicy hoppiness. Taste was similar with sweet caramel malt being at the front and a light spicy earthiness towards the end. Quite balanced and tasty overall. Ends on a bitter and slightly roasty flavor. Mouthfeel is medium and slightly warming. Good stuff that is easy drinking and fairly tasty, I could definitely have a few."
"Nothing really stood out with this beer; rather, it's the beer's fine balance that makes a statement. However, it is more malty than hoppy, and it doesn't have a whole lot of detectable spice. To me this drank like a scottish ale or something of that ilk. The malt sports nice caramel, toffee, and nut flavors. I was happy to receive this as a holiday present, and it makes a fine winter session beer. Not one to track down, but one to keep in your fridge if it's readily available. Nice."
"Drinkability- A nice X-mas beer to start the first football game off. Not bad at all."
"Pours a deep brown with some dark orange tinit with a nice creamy looking tan head,aromas of caramel and roasted nut along with some zest.Taste is earthy and chocolaty with a nice spicey finish,almost a higher hopped brown ale.A nice velvety mouthfeel the beer glides down the throat,a real winter warmer rich and hearty with alot of nice flavors going on."
"Other comments: A nice malty/hoppy strong ale, but I'm not sure what makes it ""festive""."
"Whooppee, an average ""Santamas"" beer."
"This winter warmer poured a very lightly hazy, deep red-chestnut color with tan foam that settled flat. The smell was modest but malty. The taste was malty with very light sweetness and some hoppiness to balance. Other flavors detected were dried fruits. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with a slight drying quality and a touch of sharpness. The body and carbonation were medium. The aftertaste was tangy and lightly hoppy. Overall this was a good winter warmer."
"Dark translucent ruby-brown with a quickly dissolving head, smells like caramel-covered cinnamon apples. Heavy toffee malt mixed with plums and berries and spices, with a nice chewy mouthfeel and smooth slightly bitter grapefruit finish. I would love to try this stuff on cask, or even at room temperature, there's a lot of flavor here. Unfortunately I live in a galaxy far, far away for the nearest place to get this stuff."
"The head is small, tan (almost a little yellowy) and dies filmy. The beer is clear, dark, oiled mahogany: gorgeous. Sweet chocolate and toffee in the delicious nose. Chocolate and fruit up front. Thick and fruity malty, cocoa middle. Bitter chocolate, nutty, hoppy, milky finish with alcohol. This is a very nice, bitter, chocolate, malty, dark ale with a great hop profile. Delicious."
"I wouldn't call this a big beer, but it's rich and flavorful. Very good for cold nights. Well done."
"Savoring the sixer that my in-laws brought me from Oregon on their Thanksgiving trip. Pours a dark brown hue with deep red highlights with a thick, one-inch tan head. Aroma of deep, roasted malt with notes of spruce and a touch of spicy hops. Chewy, slightly syrupy mouthfeel holds an upfront palate of sweet malt. Sharp, spicy hops come through afterwards, with notes of licorice, spruce, pepper, and a good bit of warming alcohol on the finish. Very nice."
"Having recently drunk Full Sail's Wassail, I thought this brew was not dissimilar to that one."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a reddish-brown color. It was clear, with a small tan head. The head disapated rather quickly. I was suprised by the amount of hops in the nose. They were just above a fairly nice sweet, malty nose. Some roastiness to the taste, with plenty of malt and a touch of bitterness thrown in. A touch dry in the aftertaste. A really nice beer."
"What a good way to start my seasonal tasting!"
"A very fine winter warmer. Can't wait to try next years."
"From a 12 oz bottle, with a nice winter motif on the label, it pours a dark brown with a hint of red. The smell is sweet, hard-candy with a subdued hop smell. The taste is also sweet without being cloying. Hop bitterness makes cameo appearance to keep things interesting. Mouthfeel and drinkability are nice. However, it's not a session beer by any stretch of the imagination."
"Overall, a very fine winter seasonal with some nice alcohol warming. Reminds me of Great Divide's Hibernation Ale."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable on a cold night by the fire I believe that this beer would lose some of it's pleasurable qualities if served on a hot day as it is more flavorful than thirst quenching. A nice session beer in the Winter though after about three I wouldn't need many more."
"Great winter beer, pours a mahogany red with a 2 inch thick cream head. The smell is of melons, apples and cider, nice spice of nutmeg lingers. The taste is sweet with melons and harvest fruits, a nice citrus taste is distant but right, the spices are warming and fit the season well, medium bodied and a great winter warmer."
"Pours an amber brown body with an off white head. Intense fruitty, sweet and hoppy smell makes my mouth water. Taste first of dark malts then finishes with hop bitterness and back to sweet malt. Has a deep dark malt taste throughout but not an astringent edge like some beers with dark malts. A nice sipping beer not really a great session beer but a great winter seasonal."
"Moderately drinkable - goes well for the season but it's not a beer you'd like to have 2 or 3 of in a single sitting."
"Large, creamy malt flavor with notes of caramel, maple and dark fruit balanced by a cunning bitterness and hop notes of pine and other citrus flavors. I like this stuff."
"I've been wracking my brains about this for some time now and haven't yet arrived at any satisfactory conclusions. Some possibilities include improperly cleaned glassware or beerlines. And then again, maybe this Jubelale just isn't all it's cracked up to be."
"Cloudy brown body, no head anymore. Complex malty aroma, smoky and oak-barrel reminiscent. Various sweet malt notes like chocolate, toffee, mintÂ… Big barrel taste, woody with subtle English hops references. Toffee like sweetness lets room for a bitter coffee alike finish. Taste comparable to a Â“smoked barrelÂ” and sweet caramel if anything. Low carbonation, medium bodied. A rarity worth seeking out. Cheers to skyhand for this rare chance!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, with no effort at decanting, poured it all in (didn't quite mean to, but oh well), formed little head, and what was there was gone quickly. Color is murky brown with strong red edges. Aroma is strongly of plums, raisins, and alcohol, like a good winter warmer should. Taste is a wood-tinged maltfest, with the dark fruits and alcohol exploding onto the scene near the end of the tasting experience. Mouthfeel is incredible, with apparently the aging rounding the edges and making this one smooth MF of a brew, especially for the style. Same goes for the drinkability. Wish another of these could be gotten, but I am happy to know that I had one, at least."
"Jubelale was served from a 12 oz. bottle, a straggler from the winter season. In a pint glass, the beer was an attractive hazy ruddy orange-brown color, and was topped by an fine, thin, and persistant off-white head that left nice sheets of lacing. The nose was rich and lively, with sharp and developed estery malts and notes of lemon-orange zest and subtle licourice. On the palate, a sharp roasty caramel-coffee malt profile opened, then became increasingly malty and orange-tinged in the transition to the creamy-roasted coffee finish. Robust bitterness was found evenly throughout, as well as a tad of alcohol. The body was quite smooth and full, working well with the flavors and character of this dark winter ale. This winter beer was fairly robust on the malt and hop fronts, yet was deftly balanced and not overly sweet, making it very drinkable. Jubelale is one of my favorite winter seasonals."
"Many, many thanks to skyhand for passing this bottle on to me."
"I could drink more than one of these easily. I would have to say that this is one of the most complex beers of the style I have ever had. If only I could get it again and age is just a little longer to see how a few more years would change the flavor."
"The spice can detract from the drinkability after a few, but it's still very drinkable. It feels great in the mouth, being somewhat dark and heavy but not overwhelmingly so."
"Dumped from a decorative twelve ounce bottle into a pint glass, the body is mahogany and when held to the light becomes burgundy; the head is barely there, but what's here is barely a quarter inch tall, tan to off-white, leaves oily swirls on the brew's surface. Smell: rich, warm brown sugar, spiced fruits (raisins, plums, soaked in rum for days), sugar cookies, and the finish is like fresh melon rinds. Full, complex nose. Taste: opens with a bitter-sweet prick on the tip of my palate that folds back revealing a sweet (flat cola) and fruity (granny smith apples) edge; the finish is a grainy, crusty bitterness that emcompasses my entire palate, with a lingering background of subtle fruit sweetness. Alcohol is present in the warmth I feel in my stomach and throat. Mouthfeel: think whole milk, and just a dash of carbonation noticeable through the finish. I enjoyed this in season, a real winter warmer, and it's a treat even now that it's spring."
"Zum wohl!"
"It's been a while since I've been this surprised by the taste of a beer. This is some interesting stuff. There's a touch of coffee and some dark molasses, and the hops are evident without being at all intrusive. There's a pleasantly twangy bitterness and a slight smokiness. The most interesting thing, though, is the oily, thick, malty, viscous mouthfeel. Man, this is good. The finish has a delightful bitterness that's somewhere between woody and nutty, along with that beany/coffee bean flavor that's reminiscent of Perkuno's Hammer. Most of all it reminds me of Gilded Otter's Winter Wassail, but this is better executed."
"Thanks to Alexgash for this one. Nice dark reddish brown with a nice khaki colored head. Smell is rich piney hops and spices, nutmeg, cinnimon, ginger? Full mouthfeel and a taste that is sublime. Nice strong malt base with touches of subtle spices and a strong hop component that is extremely well balanced. A great celebration beer...to celebrate good skiing that is."
"This has a creamy, medium bodied mouthfeel. I find it well-balanced and rather tasty, and think it would make a great session beer."
"Clear ruby hue with a slight murk. One finger thick, steadfast, dense, light beige head leaves intricate lace. The aroma is a melange of mellow grapefruit and pine, with a spritz of festive spicy cinnamon and grainy, caramel drizzled whole grain bread. Remains unexpectedly static, with little change in profile as the beer breathes. Still, well rounded and stately aromawise. In flavor, the dominant malt suggestion is of dark, lightly singed toffee. Secondary are notes of overbaked rye cracker. Hop bitterness is moderate, and quells residual sweetness well, resulting in an overall dry flavor profile. Softens somewhat as the beer oxidizes, with subtle butterscotch and brittle notes superceding the evanescent burnt caramel tones. Hop flavor is of a mild pine sap and floral, noble esque combination. A touch meak in body, with a mouthfeel that could use additional viscosity. Finishes dry, but with lingering afterthoughts of red licorice, bitter cinnamon and graham crackers. A fairly complex and enjoyable brew, indeed. Jubeale could use more heft in body to support the bold, fermentation derived spice character, however. Regardless, it's very tasty and highly drinkable for a winter seasonal. Its ester profile is impressive."
"Thanks to Gusler for the bottles!"
"Quality winter beer...not quite special in my book but close.."
"2003-4 sampled. Pour a reddish brown with a health tan head. Musky aroma that alternately let through the malt and hops. Toasted, coffee-ish flavor with a slowly growing bitterness in the finish. Substantial mouthfeel. A pretty good brew, but more of a treat than a session beer. I was satisfied with one."
"One good reason to come to Oregon during the winter season. I haven't a Jubilale for a few years and I was looking forward to having one. Winter 2003-04. It starts off with a big lingering head with plenty of lace. The color is dark amber with traces of ruby. The aroma is citrusy with a nice floral bouquet. As to the taste, It is citrusy (grapefruit) with a good blend of flavoring hops and caramel overtones and it is a little sweet. The mouthfeel is a bit doughy with a good hop bite. The finish is dry and bitter with some sweetness. At first this beer was too hoppy for my winter beer taste. However, it mellowed as it warmed up a bit. The malt characteristics became more prominent and balanced out the hops perfectly for my taste. Not a bad beer at all."
"good for sipping by the fireside. or while surfing the web."
"Overall, a good strong ale."

"Huge thanks to Xlperro for this one."
"Pours a medium brown with orange and red highlights. Small but frothy head that leaves amazing lace on the glass. Aroma is caramel apple and some subtle bitter hop notes. Taste is a beautiful malt, slighlty sour on the front. Middle has a mild bitter alcoholic kick and finishes with a spicy dry after-taste."
"IÂ’ve enjoyed DeschutesÂ’ Black Butte Porter and had high hopes for Jubelale. Unfortunately, all I can say is that I was disappointed with how the tastes didnÂ’t same to mesh well. IÂ’ll pass on this one in the future."
"Kudos to King Gusler for helping me to sample it!"
"Nice looking burgandy tone. Thin and sticky beige head. A creamy film is left along with an average collaring after a minute. Lacing is quite bountiful and nice. Beautifuly fresh floral hop essences served against a backdrop of sweet maltiness. Hop notes are piney and fragrant. Maltiness smells of biscuit and caramel. To me, it seems like this strong ale is more about the hops than the malt. Not that that's wrong. It tastes good, but could use a little more caramel malt goodness. The hops are piney and fragrant. Bitter pine cones. Some spicy goodness includes hints of cinamon and orange peel. Just a hint of alcohol on the tongue. Body is approaching medium. Mouthfeel is delicate. This one's a winner."
"Overall: A very nice Xmas beer that is not over the top but a great partner for a cold night. Thanks to EyeChartBrew for this one Â– my very first from Deschutes, hopefully IÂ’ll get to try some more in the very near future."
"Thank you Idaho. Dark cinnamon body with a creamy light-brown head. Smells of sweet, rich toffee malts, a little fruit, and loads of spicy hops. Taste starts out with toffee malts, at the perfect sweetness level, rich, some alcohol. Hops are big, but balanced, piney, spicy and am I detecting some nutmeg? Maybe I'm crazy. Deliciously warming, and bitter. One of the best holiday beers I've ever had."
"Drinkability Â– I felt like a king drinking this ale. This one is awesome. If youÂ’re looking for a BA Christmas present, this is it."
"Pours with a light brown head. It is a deep brown color. As it pours I get notes of raisin and roasty malt aromas, perhaps a hint of banana as well that might be a hop contribution (really hard to tell). There is quite a bit of fruity - spicy hops in the aroma that seems to have a candy coating. This beer is quite smooth, a finish that is reminiscent of rum. Quite good, complex. Has a finish that is of roast malt and an astringent / slightly alcoholic ending, as well as some balancing hop bitterness. Fruity notes of raisin and cherry are evident as well. A very well balanced beer with some hop character as well, some hop spiciness definitely hits my tongue, though it is subdued. The aroma is the best part of this beer, it is not quite perfect but it is close."
"I tend to be a Sierra Celebration fan when it comes to winter beers, but this is definitly the cream of this years crop. I've certainly enjoyed Jubelale in the past but this year it's exceptional."
"Sipping my first Jubelale of the season and a happy day it is. Pours a beautiful deep russet brown, almost too dense to read the lettering through it on the back side of the glass. The head is modest and dissipates quickly, tan colored. The flavor is a wonderful mix of roasted malt, coffee, subtle spice and subdued hops that signals the arrival of the Winter Beers, which I'm ready for. The standard against which I judge other winter beers--no element over the top, all in balance. Delicious."
"The color is appears to be almost reddish-brown. Poured a decent head that dissapated quickly. Tastes of toasted malts and coffee with just a right touch of spice finish. Can't put my finger on which spice is used. This is a nice full beer that leaves my mouth quite satisfied. This is another extremely drinkable brew from my favorite Oregon brewer!"
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a thick creamy tan head that hangs on forever and laces nicely. caramel malt aromas, with some citrus in the background . Flavors are sweet malty, citrusy, bitter, spicy. Nice long spicy bitersweet finish."
"A very nice winter ale..not to strong on the alcohol..but definatlly the smoothest on the market."
"Body is sweet but rich with caramel and toasted malty notes with a fading hoppy flavor and a spicy and slighty sour finish."
"2002 edition. Barely cloudy dark amber with hints of red, forming a thin yellow head despite a vigorous pour. Retention and lacing are OK. Aroma is of sweet rasins, brown sugar, fruity mild hops. Taste begins with herbal flavor hops, round amber malts with some earthiness, hints of dark fruit followed by moderately perceptable sharp alcohol and a sustained moderate earthen bitterness. Mouthfel is dry with a medium-dense body. The alcohol is pungent yet tolerable at cold temps and gets worse as it warms. Rough all over and a little ugly on the side."

"I poured the complete bottle, sediment and all, leaving a cloudy brown body beneath a thin layer of light tan foam. The head dropped shortly but maintained a decent collar throughout most of the glass. The nose is just astounding! Very unique! It displays a complex variety of fruits, sweet malt, and woody character that includes fresh-picked berries, soft baked-apple-pie, a slight hint of red pepper, dried apricots, tangerines, mushrooms, cocoa, cocoanut, dark caramel, toffee, fudge, a touch of smoke, some creamy coffee, and alot of oak. Whoah! The aroma in itself can be enjoyed throughout the good part of a night by the fire or as the sun sets and the sky comes alive with stars! This is truly a beer for all seasons. Impressive. The body is full/medium; and it's quite creamy and smooth across the palate with just a gentle caress on the tongue from the restrained, natural carbonation. Not surprisingly, some different flavors arise in the mouth. Previously unseen, soft prune rushes the stage; accompanied by a mild and sweet cherry, toasted cocoanut, dark toffee, light coffee and a nutty character that really develops in the long & complex finish along with some residual piney and grassy notes from the receeding hop flavors. It finishes dry with a very mild note of smoke, but no longer robustly bitter. This beer should soften and develop a bit more complexity over then next year or so, and then change as more cherry/sherry character develops for some time. Exceptional!"
"I wish we could get more of this stuff on the east coast! Dark reddish copper with thick off-white head and nice sticky lace. A pleasantly sweet aroma of malt, hops, fruit and trace alcohol vapors. The full rich malty body is sweet and exudes the essence of berries. Medium/high in complex hops. Balanced yet complex. Velvety & smooth. Celebrate!"
"I liked this winter brew. Others are better, but this one is just fine. Nice strong flavor, although a bit more hops than others of this style. The flavor grabs you right quick, but you settle in and enjoy it. I can't drink more than one or two, for some reason I just can't take more."
"Nice cherry-red glow with light tan head that is nice but fades incompletely. The aroma is oranges, mild winter spiciness (whether it's added or not) and a light, sweet malt. The first sip is a shock at the amount of hop bitterness. The hops seem to float seperately from the rest of the beer which is a warm soft sweet maltiness. The hop bitterness fades as you get used to it but it still seems out of place and unbalances the beer."
"Ruby/amber color, deep and glowing. Smooth and creamy tan head. Pretty as a picture. Gorgeous aroma that spews forth the scent of tastes to come. Brandied fruit, ripe sugary plums and a prominent (sometimes fusel) alcohol, reveal themselves individually, then become integrated. The alcohol fires up the nostrils and throat with each swallow. Hops are reserved but adequate enough to provide the precise balance. Some hints of chocolate and molasses emerge as this lovely brew coats the palate. A big malty brew perfect for the winter months. Classic seasonal ale. (Thanks to Valleyboy for the Christmas beer!)"
"An excellent choice for a winter warmer."
"It was a good beer, but nothing to rave about. Poured a nice deep reddish copper color. The smell was of a spicy fruity and malty aroma. The taste was a complex of fruits and malts, with a hint of a hoppy flavor. The sweetness mellowed the bitterness and made this beer drinkable. But was not overly impressed!"
"Had this on tap at Redbones and I have to say that it is one of the better winter ales that I have had. Very dark amber in color with little to no head. The hops and malt combined to make a very drinkable strong ale. A few fruity notes coming through, especially apple, give it a ""sweet"" edge. The alcohol was not present at all to me. I wish that we could have more of this on the East Coast."
"416"
"Notes & Drinkability: One of the better winter brews to meet my palate. I could drink this all winter. Complex, balanced and hands down tasty. Definitely puts you in a festive mood."
"Deep ruby color, medium foamy head. Rich malt aroma. Tastes very different from the 2001 edition. Rich malt flavor, molasses, spices and spruce. Not as hoppy as the 2001. Chocolate malts and a touch of banana and clove. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste us slightly bitter. Nice and warming. Great for winter evening sipping."
"Deep, dark amber colored ale with a nice brownish head on the pour Head went away a bit quick, although some stayed around on the edges to lace the glass nicely. Piney scent on the nose Great full flavored taste. This is one beer that is bound to keep you warm during those long and cold winter nights. Past years of Jubelale have been nothing less than magnificant and this years version is no different."
"Very nice dark amber color with a creamy head.  This is a very good winter ale in the tradition of teh brewery.  Moderate body with heavy, but not overbearing maltiness.  Goes down very smooth."
"Sharp pungent hops and spice and raw toffee nose. These same elements make a flawless transition to the tongue. Complex and mature. All the distinguished flavors gently fold over one another on the tongue, beginning with a mouthful of rich malts these will soon give the robust hop character permission to surface. A phenomenal brew."
"A gift from the Gods - This is an incredible, complex beer - saving some for my wedding.  If you can find it call me."
