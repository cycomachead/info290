3.68,1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"22 ounce bottle into snifter; 2012 vintage, bottled on 8/28/2012. Pours fairly clear reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, pear, vanilla, oak, clove, bourbon, floral, grass, slight pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt, bourbon barrel, and light-moderate hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, pear, vanilla, oak, clove, bourbon, floral, grass, slight pine, and floral/toasted earthiness. Slight earthy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, vanilla, oak, clove, bourbon, floral, grass, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice complexity and moderate robustness of dark malt, bourbon barrel, and light-moderate hop flavors; with a nice malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice barrel aged strong ale. Good balance and complexity of malt, barrel, and light-moderate hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Mar 15, 2014"
2.93,-18.8,2.5,3.25,3,3,2.5,"This is one of the few times I'm going to agree with the rating as spot on. About an 80% overall score for this one. I've had my fair share of bourbon aged beers and this falls short in so many ways. First of all it's not a stout so don't expect one. It pour s a medium transparent brown color not a lot of carbonation in the liquid nor head on top. Sweet bouquet where I pick up some notes of oats and barley. The initial sip is watery. Doesn't seem like a 9%+ abv beer. Not much flavor lingers on the tounge and almost no taste of bourbon. All hype and no deliver. Too much bark and not enough bite for this beer. Seems like I paid $13 simply for the wax they put on the top of the bottle.","Ryanm1","Mar 14, 2014"

The beer comes across well at first, but the bourbon notes, even though they’re somewhat watery, tend to dominate later mouthfuls, and the beer wants for a better malt base to help sustain the fruit and sugar notes. There’s also a slightly-too-large remnant of whiskey-like alcohol about the edges, and even more noticeable in the aftertaste, the malts not quite capable of hiding the higher ABV. The ultimate effect is that, despite the high ABV, this comes across as a mid-grade ale that was barrel aged for better flavor.","jondeelee","Oct 22, 2012"

Nose has some orangey hop notes that are a bit resinous, a touch of oak, vanilla and only a slight suggestion of bourbon. Taste has quite a bit of the same, orangey-like hop notes (which, as I move through the bottle, come across as more and more artificial), with lots of oak, butterscotch - almost along the lines of an Innis & Gunn. Some bourbon flavour, without any bourbon burn. A hint of spice, bitter in the finish with a dash of alcohol. Heavy medium body and carbonation is quite low, slightly more drinkable than some pure 'sippers' out there. Too sweet for my liking though, and lacks any real complexity to make this stand out.

Flavor has a strong woody bourbon overtone, which dominates the flavor but still lets through malt and apple/pear notes, plus just a hint of caramel. Smooth texture has slightly above average body and quite a bit of fizz, leaving a tingly, woody finish. This is a bold beer for bold people.","Cyberkedi","Dec 19, 2011"

Taste was quite the same with vanilla and cherry elements, mild maltiness reminds on this is a beer and not the leftover watery remnants of an inexpensive Kentucky bourbon on the rocks..

Palate is rich and sweet, with a lightly fruit hop profile mingling with the assertive malts and the strong bourbon edge, leading up to a very warm finish. This is a very nice beer right now, but I think a few months of aging will round out the edges and make this an excellent beer.","ElGordo","Nov 17, 2011"

There is a bitterness that lingers in the back on the finish, but I am left with a sweet lower-proof bourbon flavor. A froth on the palate gets the alcohol warmed up and some mild oaky barrel flavors emerge. If you can envision a pefect combo of a beer mixed with bourbon this ale hits the spot.

Modest hop profile, and the maltiness is quite dry. Expected more of an alcohol presence between the barrel and higher alcohol. Mellow up front but warming in the back.

The mouth feel is tangy and creamy all at once and it compliments the flavor nicely...it has a sturdy medium weight to the body. It finishes on the dry side with a meager lingering aftertaste.

My second time around, I took it slower, still feeling the bourbon melting my insides as it slid down my throat, and tasted around. Other than some wintery spiciness, I pulled out some piney/resiny hops that were missing in the nose, lots of damp oak and wood, sweet toffee malts, caramel, and light vanilla - all of which combined on my tongue to make a thin, sticky syrup flavor/feeling that was slick going down. It held a light to medium-light body, which I did not expect, though with the amount of bright, tingly carbonation in this beer, there's not much room for it to be thicker. I guess I assumed it would be more rounded and smooth, but instead it popped in my mouth with the bright bubbles. Ending on a slightly dry note, the Barrel Aged Brrrbon wasn't too shabby. It's not going to be my go-to winter beer, regardless of how warm it made me with it's 9.4%ABV, but it was definitely unique. I only wish it was more like beer, with more diverse grains, malts, and hops, and focused less on the woody bourbon barrel aging flavors.

The nose comprises coconut-enhanced suntan lotion, oak, caramel, light cocoa powder, cheap whiskey, circus peanuts candy, and rye bread. The taste bludgeons me with rubbery whiskey and oak, while the caramel, rye, and light hot cinnamon cower in the corner, lest they get the full wrath of the drunken, abusive brrrbon tones. Man, they are really trying way too hard here. The body is a strangely stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a slimily dry finish. Overall, I'm not at all impressed with this brew.
