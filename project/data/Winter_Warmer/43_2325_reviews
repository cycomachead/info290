"Overall –  This was a very tasty brew overall, with a great drinkinability nice light warming feel and just enough spice to balance the sweet."

"This is a fairly unique beer and quite unlike most winter warmers I've tried.  The weird aroma is just a tad overbearing, but it drinks well overall."

"O: decent but unexceptional brown ale."
""
""
""
""

"A standard, yet well done Winter Warmer. Though there was nothing wrong with it I would have liked to have drank it when it was a bit more fresh."
"O: A fairly decent drinker, this is a lighter winter warmer that doesn't go overboard on spices or other adjuncts. I had low expectations, and they were met."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not as big and bold as some holiday ales yet a solid effort overall. The malt sugars are warm and inviting and cling to the palate, slowly dissolving and leaving a nice hop bitterness and slight brown sugar aftertaste. Perhaps not the epitome of a winter warmer, but tasty and inviting all the same."
"A pretty decent beer. Not quite a winter warmer for me, more like a winter lukewarmer, but good nonetheless."
""
"Mouth follows through on the slight tart cherry-ish feel with a nearly raisiny not quite spicey hanger on that lingers in the mouth with a slight pucker. Not really a solo beer, but one that is going to be an enabler at the table in the pre and post dinner categories of the evenings drinking. Should pair well with chocolate and some other things that utilize chocolate and fruit and also of course. Meat, and maybe some aged cheeses."

"Pours dark red / brown, thick and frothy head that leaves lacing all over the place. Head is slow to dissipate but it does, eventually. Aroma is mostly sweet caramel at first. Thick but not syrupy. Well-balanced with piney hops, tastes more bitter than it smells just to remind you it's from the NW. Sweet cherry flavors and aroma become more prevalent as the beer warms. And to think I almost didn't get this at all... great winter beer!"

"Overall- Unique, but better straight from the fridge and out of the bottle. Still, it's something I find myself seeking out when it's in season."

"I miss Bill Murray's real comedy work... Anyway, this stuff pours a mostly clear ruby-influenced amber topped by a finger of glowing off-cream foam. The nose comprises perfume-y caramel, light greens, light raisin, a pinch of cinnamon, and the vague inference of dark fruits way in the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with the spices and fruits (now not quite as dark, but not quite un-dark to not be called dark anymore) increased a notch or two throughout. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a nice spicy Winter warmer, something I wouldn't mind enjoying time to time during these cold months."
"Overall, not bad. Not something I would seek out again but an enjoyable beer."
""
"Certainly a malt forward beer with some caramel and fruit but nothing too bold. Hops add possibly a some earthy spicyness but not much more. Was hoping for more pronounced overall flavor. This one felt a little thin for the style, but still was quite drinkable. Certainly hides the alcohol well. There were no real issues with this beer, but it's a bit bland for a winter warmer."
""
"O - This used to be a favorite, but I haven't been impressed with it in recent years. Was afraid I had grown out of this ""beginner beer."" That may be true, but I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this bottle. One key to enjoying this beer is to drink it on the colder side (not much of a compliment, I know). And definitely pour carefully. I will continue to pick this up every year, for old time's sake, and recommend it to fans of the style."
""
""
"I'd pass."
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a cloudy, coppery amber with a half finger off-white head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of moderately toasted malt, mild dark fruit, cinnamon and holiday spicing. Taste is dark dried fruit, toasted and bready malt, cinnamon and spices, rather mild tasting. Medium bodied. Nice flavor and well integrated, but very mild and low-key flavoring overall. Pleasant to drink, but kind of characterless (unlike Ebenzer from Dickens)."
""

""
""
"A fair enough beer but lacking in the appearance and smell areas."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty good. Nice hue, decent head, and some pretty solid lacing. Nose is a flat bready combination, only slightly enhanced with some fresh tea leaves. Very woody and earthy with some bitter and sweet notes. Comes across as a little ""fake"". Overall, this is a fair quaff."
""
"Overall: Not really a fan of this warmer at all. Maybe I'm just not of a fan of how they presented this style. I guess I'm just more of a fan of a maltier style warmer."
""
""
""

""
""
"Low C"
""
"Overall, this is always one of my favorite December beers. Great flavor and feel."
"Overall- A great looking beer that has a very off flavor that ruins it for me."
""
"O- Above average, but not killer."
"Overall: This isn’t my favorite brew…maybe one of my least favorites I’ve had in a while…it’s really bland, the smell and taste leave a lot to be desired…the name suggests that it’s a holiday seasonal, but the lack of any real spice in the aroma or flavor is confusing…it sets me up for something that I’m not getting…even beyond that, the beer itself isn’t all that good…humbug…(2.5/5)"

"Conclusion: I was afraid of this. Bridgeport makes appealing looking beers, but it seems that they often fall short with the execution. So many craft brewers (big and small) these days are making really fine beer, so to produce mediocre beer just doesn't cut it. Bridgeport loves to tout their position as the oldest craft brewer in Oregon, but it seems that they haven't updated their beer to compete with the ever more and more refined and perfected craft industry. For example, this beer can't stand up to other winter beers like Jubel, Hibernation, or even the mild mannered Samuel Smith's Winter Welcome. This isn't bad beer by any means, but there are just too many better options to ever buy (or drink) it again in this price segment."
"Overall, not a bad beer but not as good as many others of the style. This frankly felt like more of a dark almost-an-IPA than a winter warmer too me. I think this beer would have been improved with more spices and a little bit less hops."

"Pours dark mahogany with a fluffy ivory head that settles to a thick cap. Malt-forward aromas of caramel, brown sugar, dark fruits, and some Winter spices. Similar to the nose, sweet caramel and toffee malt, candied orange peel hops, brown sugar, and some mild spices. Mouthfeel is fairly smooth, with a medium-full body and moderate carbonation. Decent Winter Warmer, but nothing new."
"Presentation: Packages in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"Overall it's a decent winter warmer. Not my favorite, but good enough for inclusion in a mixed twelvesky."

"O: Bah Humbug! As far as winter warmers go this was nothing spectacular. Easy drinking and a good tasting beer overall but lacked the warm booziness I expected. I could see knocking out a six pack fairly quick."
""
"Overall: Nice little treat that delivers a strong malty flavor with a tinge of bitterness in the end."
"O – Not a great beer, I wouldn’t buy this again, I would drink it if it’s put in front of me though, as it is not a bad beer. I would say highly mediocre."
"O - Ebenezer doesn't make me go ""ba-humbug"" but I'm not convinced this is something that will compliment my winter. Instead, the hops used remind me of harvest and fall throwing me off balance. This Bridgeport offering is a good entry to winter warmers as Thanksgiving and the colder weather approaches but not one I'm looking to return to as the snow drifts set in."
""
""
"Overall - Pretty disappointing. No brew date, but Total Wine does a pretty good job of selling out their seasonals, so I gotta think this is fresh. I just don't see any appeal in this beer, absolutely no depth or complexity with this winter warmer."
""
""
""
"The beer has a lot of flavor but I personally don't like the taste much. It seems to be a beer of great quality but it's just not my thing."
""
""
"A light caramel taste that brings with it a lot of extras that holds the caramel notes in check resulting in a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
"I love the rich and full flavor of this beer. It was a Christmas present from my bro-in-law. This beer turned me on to Bridgeport. Since then I have visited their facility in Portland and they are my favorite Pacific NW beer. If you have no other beer from Bridgeport try this one."
""
""

"OV: Very good winter warmer, medium bodied with warming spices and a balanced profile"
"Poured from undated bottle to pint glass the beer pours a rich clear copper color with a nice 2 finger tan colored head, excellent retention and lacing. A pleasant mix of earthy hops and caramel malts together with a biscuit bread tone in the nose. The beer is more balanced than the nose lets on with a earthy pine hop and mild bitterness, a hint of caramel malt sweetness, a spicy note as well. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Finishes dry with a lingering caramel malt flavor. Overall, I enjoyed this beer. A little late in the for a winter warmer but it was nice."

"solid winter warmer. smells malty and sweet and fruity, and guess what, it is exactly that. there is a fruity flavor that presents itself up front, with a sturdy wintery malt backing. feels good in the mouth, pushing full bodied, with the right carbonation and abv for the season. its not unique in any way, but it is well made and well priced. worthy first beer from this place..."

"O - Ebenezer looks great and smells and tastes good. A fuller body would not hurt this one. Not bad, but not spectacular as winter warmers go."
""
""
"O: Not bad, but nothing special. I'm happy I got it in a gift basket instead of buying it."
"O: Overall this wasn't a bad beer. There is definately room for improvement, but good still to say the least."
""
"Medium body with natural carbonation. Mostly soft, but a touch sharp on the finish. Quite drinkable."
"Overall not that bad but nothing I'd go looking for. I do suppose this is a very aproachable winter warmer."
"O - The smell was the best thing about this beer which looked unappetizing and tasted average. I wonder if I got a bad one?"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a slightly hazy dark brown with a 2 inch foamy light tan head that settles to a film on the top of the beer. Thick foamy rings of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, dark fruits, and some mild spice aromas. Taste is of malt, fruit, spices, and a slight vegetal flavor on the finish. A mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average Winter warmer in my book. Nothing too offensive but nothing that great."
""
"A very nice change of pace from the more flamoyant IPAs."
""
"I dunno, if malty beers without much flavor behind them are your thing, then I would recommend. At least there are no off flavors really."
"Decent English-style Winter Warmer. Balanced between a biscuit, fruit cake, and treacle malt body and a brief flash of earthy hop bitterness. More of either would be appreciated, but I can still find plenty to like from a balanced, easy-drinking, value-priced ale. The fullness and mouthfeel is the only major detriment - way too thin for anything meant to fortify one in cold weather."
""
"If it had a bit more of a nose and bit less alcohol heat, this would be a serial repeater."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a very pleasant and well made Christmas Ale, though I feel it would benefit a lot from aging. I appreciated the low ABV; it drinks like a much stronger beer. Certainly worth a taste."
""
""
"This is very simple, subtle, but all around enjoyable. I will be buying more. Something I would recommend."
""
""
"O: No thanks."
""
""
""
""
""
"Has good color and nice smell. Smell is actually very good. Not too heavy or overbearing. You can taste the hops but they are subtle. Malt is present as well and is more pronounced than the hops are. Over all it is nice seasonal beer for winter. Not top of that category but definitely worth a try."
"Pours a mostly clear copper brown with a medium head. Nose is pretty heavily spiced: cardamom, coriander seed, nutmeg. Some dark fruits. Flavor is nicely dry highlighted by those holiday spices, faintly Indian. A slight malty sweetness swells up, and the finish is long and spicy. Not my favorite style, but pretty nice."
"Mouthfeel: Not much body, floral aftertaste holds on a long while."
"This has been in the basement for a few months, and seems to have lost a bit of the sweetness I remember. But quite clean and highly drinkable."
"Overall I rate high as I go back and forth between this and Jubelale as my winter refreshment. This is just a little lighter than Jubel so depending on how I feel, it hits the spot!"
"Drinkability: Good for the style. There aren't really any problems with this beer, it's decent and enjoyable but bland for a winter warmer."
"I've yet to be impressed by a winter warmer and, sadly, Ebenezer is no exception. That being said, it _is_ one of the better examples of the style I've had, but there's still so much room for improvement. It's a great value, though, and so drinkable that I'd be happy to purchase it again to see me through next winter, whilst continuing my hunt for something better."
"Very flavorful and sessionable Winter Warmer that has just a little abv. warmth on the finish."
"Nose on this is fantastic, screams of Christmas. Unfortunately, the taste doesn't match the aroma. The mouthfeel was also surprisingly thin, this beer should be bigger. Not bad though."
"not overly exciting but somewhat drinkable, probably wouldn't buy again."
"Drinkability is fine and the 6er will be enjoyed; I'd enjoy it more if it was more focused. If that makes any sense."
"My older brother sent me some Christmas goodies from the NW this year. I was excited to see this in the mix. The label has a great old timey illustration of Scrooge and pours a somewhat foogy amber color. It smelled like dull nutmeg and cinnamon. The taste hinted at warm, holiday flavors like the scent but is surrounded by a more malty taste. It's smooth and good for drinkin', but lacked the holiday punch I was hoping for."
"Poured a cloudy dark amber, minimal tan head with next to nothing lacing, Ebenezer indeed. Malty roast carmel on the nose and not much else I'm sorry to say. On the palate a warm fruity spicey citrus affair with a medium body and good carbonation, fooled me. I would have to say all in all, sure!"
"Finger and a half off white head, dark reddish brown clear body hard to discern any visible carbonation until held up to bright light which revealed multiple trails of carbonation, significant lacing retained after pretty slow dissipation. Sweet malty nose, toffee more than caramel (or is that treacle?) a bit of roast and spicy brown bread, noble hops. Taste pretty sweet up front, mirrors the nose but hops are pretty faint at best. Mouthfeel on the full side of medium, average effervescence, some stickiness. Decent drinkability, could have several of these, though the sweetness ends up being a trifle cloying."
"I've been drinking Ebenezer throughout the years.  It's a great winter brew.  Try it out if you want something with a rich flavor, but without the heaviness."
"Pretty good winter warmer, nothing too amazing. A great beer to have by the fire or on a cold, rainy day where you sit around and watch movies"
"Classic nut brown ale with some spiciness to it. Pour a dark amber color with a little off white foamy head. Aroma is strong with malt and nutty notes. Tastes of the same qualities and finishes smooth. Mouthfeel is good with the right amount of carbonation. Overall a good beer for those who like brown ales."
"Pours a hazy dark copper with a thin tan head. Smells of dried fruit and cut hay. Taste is spicy fruit up front, a wheat bread middle and a hint of cinnamon in the finish. Earthy hop bitterness as well. Mouthfeel is smooth, low carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good. A pretty good beer overall."
"Nice malt flavors but a very faint nose on this one. Drinks very easy and finishes dry. Seems a bit thin for a Winter Warmer but a tasty beer nonetheless. I would get this again."
"This beer scores solid 4.0s in all categories. Dark brown color, a bit cloudy. Smells woody with understated hazelnut, prune and walnut aromas. The taste is good: creamy mouthfeel, bitter hops and tangy dried fruit flavors dominate with a slight cinnamon flavor - not added as a spice, I think, but hinted at somehow. The aftertaste is a bit chewy and the bitterness lingers, but these qualities are balanced by a good sharp bite. As I say about the smell, the flavor is a bit understated for a Christmas/Holiday brew, but it is quite good overall. Has qualities similar to English bitter ales."
"The body is on the light side, not as thick as I was hoping from a winter warmer. It does have a slight creamy coating mouth presence with crisp carbonation. The finish is very roasty and dry, aiding drinkability. It's a good beer, but I was left wanting more."
"Poured with lovely, big, foamy, frothy, fluffy, cream colored head that lasted a while and lots of lace. Color is a clear medium amber. Aroma is malt and a little caramel and toffee. Flavor is similar, with a little roast added along with some sweet solvernt. Body is decent and so is carbonation. Finish is like flavor but ends up with the sweet solvent thing."
"Soft on palate - hate to say it but a bit watery feel. Bready flavors, light spicy hop backing. Nice malt backbone. Decent for style. Mouthfeel lacking."
"D-Another so-so beer from Bridgeport. Although a local brewery, they must have a different merchandising arrangement than Full Sail, Widmer, and Deschutes because I almost never see Bridgeport on sale. Thus, I rarely buy."
"I sought out a winter beer that I could drink in quantity and found it."
"Expect the unexpected with this ale. It pours a dark brown color with a long lasting head. There is a slight scent to it, but nothing that stands out. It was quite heavy for an ale while there was a slight nutty taste, very slightly bitter but finished quite smooth. A very nice find and something I would suggest to others."
"An ok brew here... It grew on me at the end but not enough to improve the scores any.."
"It's like a spicy winter toddy. I'm not entirely thrilled with anything in particular about this beer but it's still fairly enjoyable from a unique sipping experience. It's something that must be tried to understand the interesting flavors in this one."
"Overall this beer has character. It is aptly named and a great addition to winter beers."
"Drinkability - mildly complex, worth buying a sixpack of, and a decent taste in general. The aftertaste is mild enough to make the bitterness bearable."
"Pours a medium brown with a thin, off white head. The nose brings a small amount of spice forward. I think I'm getting cinnamon and nutmeg, but never entirely sure. I really need to start having these beers with my spice rack nearby. A bit of caramel and toffee in there as well. Taste is a bit of doughy bread with light caramel and some spice. Light to medium body with good carbonation levels. Not at all overspiced, this drank pretty well."
"this was the first winter warmer ive had, so i dont have anything to base it off of. so from my opinion, despite my lack of experience in this field, i thought this was a really good beer. appearance was sort of dark amber, smell was rather pleasant, malty. as far as tatse goes, to me, this felt like it had raw vanilla in it. some may say cheap vodka, but i think they dont know what theyre talking about. those people should stop trying to analyze beer and just enjoy it. and thats what this beer is for, enjoyment. it felt great to drink, and wasnt heavy like stouts or most darker beers. thanks bridgeport for this great beer!"
"Drink is not great as well because of the taste. I hope this isn't what it is supposed to be like"
"Have not had this beer for quite awhile and I liked the caramel notes that swirled up in the midbody as the beer warmed up. Not as hoppy or as thick a mouthfeel as Jubelale but satisfying in its own way this beer is a classic winter warmer that shows more reliance on the malt than the hops."
"The drinkability is pretty good I could drink a couple of these though I don't feel driven to. Over all not a bad winter ale about average for the style."
"Ebenezer Ale-Bottle Conditioned Winter Warmer--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 6.40% ABV. 40 IBU's. (4.25 / 5.0) Winter Ale--English. Bottle Conditioned sediment dusting. Big dense lacy tan head. Hazy dark ruby red color. Toasted doughy malty floral toffee cherry hop front. Rich mildly creamy doughy English biscuit toasted caramel mellow sweet dark fruit body. Smooth balanced Winter hop spice end. Very Nice this year. Hop Czar Hops? Sampled 10/18/2010 from 6-Pack purchased for $6.99 @ Seattle Fred Meyer--Ballard on 9/27/2010."
"Surprise! Very good beer. Enough to make me take another look at a category of beer that I'd nearly written off."
"Picked this at a liqour stotres winter close-outs section, good value. I have always been a fan of Bridgeport, but they always seem to be kind of hit or miss.This was in the middle. Not much for a winter beer, over-malty but nothing else. This was very drinkable at 6.4%, but that's it. Overall pretty plain, was expecting something a bit more for a seasonal."
"Good winter warmer. Very rich and caramelly. Could perhaps use a bit more hop bitterness and flavor imo."
"Had 2 more of these the following week, not as impressive, less like a barleywine, more like a cider, complexity not there as much."
"Overall, this is a fine, easy drinking, Winter Warmer, wish everything in it was kicked up just a bit more, but overall, this one is a good choice."
"D: Very smooth and drinkable, well balanced with some nice complexities not found in current vintage. I think this beer has gotten much better with a year of age. Highly recommend!"
"Drinkability: this is one winter warmer which goes down easy. Big hop aroma combined with a more classic malty flavor make this a pretty good selection."
"Its smooth, roasty, malty, and just did it for me on the blustery winter day."
"The mouthfeel is nicely creamy with low carbonation."
"Aroma is quite strong, mainly spicy and slightly sweet, and has an evergreen component making it smell somewhat like a good IPA. It pours a dark, somewhat hazy, warm mahogany with a fairly thick off-white head. Spicy, malty flavor has a decided hoppy undertone and is a little sweet and a little bitter. Texture is fizzy and zingy, yet smooth and slick. Happy whatever-you-celebrate-this-time-of-year!"
"D- Very drinkable. Super tasty and something I'm going to buy every season."
" Body is smooth, full but not particularly rich. This is fine, as a rich body would overwhelm the relatively mild flavors of this winter ale. The mildness contributes to this being a particularly sessionable winter ale. Not the most interesting of the winter offerings from Oregon breweries, but it is one of the most consistently enjoyable winter ales around."
"Overall, it doesn't get much better than this for an Oregon winter warmer."
"This is a noble attempt at a winter warmer from a great brewery. I am spoiled here in Portland because we have SO many great brewpups who spend an insane amount of time and effort on their winter seasonal brews. So this one fell short. It lacks the balance I typically attribute to Bridgeport brews. I will taste from bottle and reassess soon. =)"
"Drinkability: Lots of ABV but little taste to make up for it. Not very good overall."
"To me that is English, and after reading that, and drinking more.. and loving English brews and ESB's... and being mostly English... I noticed this is much like your average spicy ESB.... and tasty for such as that... not bad at all... and kudos"
"This Winter seasonal poured a dark amber color. Sweet caramel with cherry notes on the nose. The flavor is nutty caramel with cherries in the finish. Smooth feel with ample carbonation. Good brew. Subtle maltiness is reminiscent of English beers. Smooth and warming, perfect for the season. Recommended."
"Too cold, though, and this is heavy yet bland and becomes tiresome quickly. It tastes of burnt alcoholic candy, toasted crackers, with vague hints of sweet citrus, ultimately a toasty-caramelly citrusy sweetness with alcoholic bite. When cold, it seems thin despite the heavy character."
"D: A must when I get together with family over Christmas break. My brother and I always manage to put back a few of these, but note: the buzz builds fast."
"Single bottle bought from Green's. Poured dark brown with a healthy head that fades to a thin ring and leaves some lacing. Smells of mixed dried fruit, bubblegum and spice. The bubblegum taste starts things off in the mouth as well, then it shifts to pine and spices with a bit of maltlurking in the background. Pleasant, and a bit different for a winter warmer. Slightly tannic in the mouth, could be a bit smoother. Still, I enjoyed this well enough, and it had been years since I had had one."
"D) A malty sweet pine spiced beer that comes across and very seasonal and enjoyable."
"Overall a very nice beer and I'm glad that I came upon it. It will be a beer that I look foward to drinking every winter."
"D - From this review, one might thin, that I don't love hops. Well, I do love hops. In fact several of my all time favorite brews are DIPA's and IPA's. It's just that, well, sometimes hops just aren't called for. This brew has some nice and complex fruitcake, cherry, and cinnamon notes going for it, but the hops come in and decimate any delicate wintery flavors that I noticed in the nose. I love having my palate destroyed with hop power, but not when I'm trying to concentrate on the wonderful, but more delicate notes that can't stand up to the almighty hop. All in all, this is a fine brew... i just think it could have been slightly better. A near miss of top tier beer IMO"
"Poured into straight pint glass. A deep brown color, slightly lighter than most of the style. Poured with a thick head of nice tight bubbles. Head was a pale tan color with minimal lacing. Welcoming aroma with spice and caramel notes. The flavors matches the aroma very well, with a smooth caramel flavor on the back of the tongue. Body was thinner than usual for the style. Very smooth and drinkable, a 4-5 pint session would happen before you realized it. A very good example of the style, if you see it, get it."
"A nice medium body makes for an enjoyable if not jaw-dropping winter warmer. I enjoy a taste or two every winter."
"taste is thick, creamy, sour malts, roasted nuts, cinnamon, spice, caramel, a touch of bakers chocolate way in the back, and some hops, leaves the mouth on the sticky side and a little bitter."
"Drinkability is good in spite of the 6.4%abv. Better than average winter warmer."
"Notes from: 03/12/08."
"D: Very nice balance makes it very drinkable. No of the flavors and smells are overdone - its all just right."
"Drinks down easily, which makes for a nice addition to the winter beer arsenal."
"Pours a dark amber, little clarity with a thick two finger light brown head. Aroma is pleasant, some malt but a light hint of hops. Smell is very crisp and pleasant. Taste is hoppy with malty sweetness, good balance between the two. Slight hints of alcohol, not a light of spiciness, suprising for a seasonal brew. Good texture with a light body. Good beer to try, but not a session beer. A little heavy and sweet for multiple units. Taste is average, nothing exciting."
"D: This is a beer with big flavor, but still it is smooth and drinks rather easily. I recommend this one."
"Drinkability: Very nice. A well rounded ale. I would have preferred more spice to make it more memorable, but I could definitely enjoy a few of these in a sitting."
"This is one of my usual favorite winter warmers, not quite amazing, but pretty solid. Spiced without being overly winter-warmer-spiced. Sweet without being cloyingly sugary, piney without being PNW IPA bitter. A nice solid blend of malt, sweet, fruit, and spice. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Drinkability is very low. This beer started out looking and smelling great and I thought I was going to have a nice warmer on my hands. At first sip it all went devestatingly wrong. There's no way I could drink more than one of these, I don't even think I'll be finishing this one, the phenolic/booze character is too much for me. Sad, I had high hopes for this one actually."
"Overall: This was a very nice winter warmer with a flavor that last on the palate. Enjoyed this beer very much."
"D: Overall this is a pretty drinkable winter warmer. Nothing new here but still a solid offering. For the price and the fact its from the PNW make it enough for me to be willing to throw some back with Bob Cratchit this Christmas Eve."
"D - This is pretty good. Very different from most winter warmers."
"Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, it had a nice full body with a slight bite."
"Medium carbonation, overall quite light for the style. I'd like a little more heft and complexity, but I suppose others are looking for something lighter. What's good for the goose, as they say."
"Jk"
"D: kind of regular winter warmer, nothing really stands out. Of the ""garden variety"" as they say"
"Malty aroma with mild dried cherry buried into it, that manifests more in the flavor. It's light cherry flavor is hinted at under a smooth malty rush. Finishes a little dry with the barest hint of hops. Body is fairly light, no indication of alcohol. Definitely traditional, not overly sweet or spiced at all. A nice easy drinker for a cool fall night..."
"The drinkability is very good a must try brew. Prosit, MK"
"Bought this in bottle back in DECEMBER 06 fromthe Stadium Thrift Way in Tacoma and just now drank it. Poured a reddish brown in the glass. Almost no head. Rich malts and alcohol with subtle prune/raisin scents. The taste is similar but transitions to noticable citrus hops. Very nice Warmer a real delight to drink. Was good nad malty with some age on it."
"On the palate the caramel & malt do modest battle with background hops, and there's a few miscellaneous spices in the mix. Sometimes cinnamon, maybe ginger, and yet still a baked cookie malt sweetness in between. Rather thin bodied too, and easy to drink for the style."
"It's got that thick Winter Warmer feel - heavy in the mouth, heavy on the malt. Still has the unusual fruit factor - exotic and tropical/fresh. Then we have a bit of alcohol on the back of the tongue. Dark roast to the malt - bitter espresso bean. Sticky caramel molasses sweet side. Bit of hop bitterness."
"Well I thought I had finished with all the winter warmers I had in the fridge, but this one was hiding in the back. Good deal, I'm in the mood for something festive as it's been a blah week. Let's see here, it pours reddish-brown. A one-finger tan head fades quickly leaving no lacing behind. Smells of malts, light chocolate, some spice and a bit of tea. Tastes malty and spicy with a subtle earthiness in the background. Mouth-feel is smooth and light to medium bodied. Wouldn't mind having a few of these next year when the time comes."
"Pours a four finger off-white head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear deep amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Spicy malty nose. Flavor is spicy with malts and hops balancing. Some bitterness at finish. $1.49 for a 12oz bottle from John's Marketplace Portland, OR."
"That said, it's still just good - not great."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a medium copper, forming a creamy 1 inch tan head. Light spots of lace dot the glass. The aroma is a rich mix of malt and spices. The taste begins with a smooth malty caramel flavor, followed by a light mix of spices, and a hint of hops in the finish. Nothing too complex, but in this case, the simplicity works out well. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with a medium thickness. For a winter warmer, the medium abv. and full flavor make for a highly drinkable brew. Overall, this was one of my favorite holiday beers this season."
"Overall this went down ok, but with all the winter warmers out there - I'd seek something else over this."
"Dark ruby brown color with a nice tan head. Nose is very malty with some spices and earthy hops. Taste is again of dark sweet malts. Some nice fruits and candy as well. Good body and carbonation for the style. A little overly sweet, but a good example of the style."
"D: Certainly a nice winter beer. Not the best for me, but good. Hopefully the over carbonation of my batch was an anomaly."
"D - This beer will not taste very good to the average beer consumer, but if you look for the flavors and are picky, this is a great beer. Great for dessert and example of an English Strong or a Black Pale Ale."
"This beer is perfectly balanced and very easy to drink."
"Into a sniffer glass, this pours slightly hazy mahogany with a very small topping of foam. The nose is full of nice toasty malt and lots of resinous hops. Flavor is not quite as interesting though: a bit of sweet grainy malt, and bitterness that's very low compared to what I was expecting from the nose. A little subtle spiciness and a fruity yeast character round it out nicely, though."
"Pours a clear, but very dark ruby with a light tan head. Nose is light with a hoppy tone . Flavor is smooth. Slight bitter tone. Strong presence of hops, but nowhere near overpowering. Caramel. Very slight nut character. Overall, a decently complex flavor ride. Feel is good. Not overly syrupy like a lot of other winter warmers tend to be. Good bubble on it too. Very drinkable. Someone could drink a lot of these in a night if they wanted to. Would I? Probably not. Its good, but it just doesnt grab me as others have."
"Drinkability is pretty good, satisfying and quaffable . Not my favorite winter warmer, but a fine regional interpretation."
"Will probably try next years version, not a session beer for me."
"Pours clear medium to dark brown with thin head that dissipates quickly to just a film that barely covers the body. Really mild aroma is more malty than hoppy with a slightly leathery nose and a hint of vanilla and spice. Nice malty IF with a light hop bitterness and hint of other indistinguishable spice. Transitions quickly into a pleasantly lingering aftertaste that is bitter and eventually a little spicy. Medium to full bodied with a good creamy texture and a softish carbonation that makes this very drinkable. I consistenly buy at least a sixer of this every holiday season, partially because the local grocer always carries it. It is not as strongly flavored as some of the other holiday beers, but I am not always looking for that. Goes well with a holiday roast or any of the dessert pies."
"Drinkability: While not the most remarkable example of the style, it is still fairly easy-drinking for a lighter winter warmer."
"The Ebenezer ale needs something though ... it is stingy ... not much of anything to be memorable... It is still very balanced and not bad in any way. Bridgeport is a pretty good brewery... Their ESB and IPA are pretty much a 5-6 time a year purchase in the Galt household.... Ebenezer though, there are better PNW holiday beers out there."
"I picked up a sixer of the BridgePort winter seasonal Ebenezer Ale at the local grocery store. Poured it into my Full Sail shaker pint (as close as I could come to Portland) and found a deep amber, slightly hazy brew with a nice thick head to it. The aroma was spicy and warm with a slight alcohol to the nose. Taste was bursting with maltiness with just enough bitter and sweet to make this a perfect winter beer. If it wasn't 85 degrees outside I would have been in total bliss, but had to settle for beer enjoyment. This isn't as complex as other winter warmers, but it sure hit the spot and paired well with my dinner. This also increased its drinkability as I finished off 2 of them."
"This beer had a dark brown color with a soapy head atop the beer. Smells very malty and tastes malty as well. Not much spice going on in this beer which ups the drinkability for me. Not my favorite Bridgeport beer but one of the better winter warmers."
"I look forward to this release every winter."
"Served from a bottle on a cool winter evening. Pours a dark reddish brown rusty hue, very thin head and lacing. Smell has both hops and sweet smells very strongly. Taste is much of the same, both hoppy and malty, with a bit of a strong alcohol taste, despite the fact that it is only 6%. A bit sweet perhaps, not especially easy to drink. This beer is interesting, it isn't quite as heavy or strong as most winter warmers, but doesn't really fit the bill of a casual drinker as an IPA or APA. That said, it is a good beer for those who want a warmer type beer without the determination it sometimes takes to finish a stronger barleywine type warmer. Not a bad beer, but probably won't miss it during the off-season."
"The Ebenezer comes into my world with a dark black reddish hue with a nice foam head. No freshness date on the bottle. The aroma starts off malty with a waft of spice. It tastes smooth but is definitely more malty dominated with a biscuit maltiness to it. It is slightly chewy in the mouth and is an overall pretty darn good beer."
"Drinks okay, just not much going here as winter warmers go. All & all I'd say this is the most mediocre winter warmer I've ever had."
"D - Easy to drink, nothing thats going to wallop you which in most instances is a good thing to have."
"This is a great winter warmer! I really enjoyed this beer, and look forward to my next one!"
"Reddish brown in the glass. Almost no head. Rich malts and alcohol with subtle prune/raisin scents. The taste is similar but transitions to noticable citrus hops. Ebenezer is somewhat easy to drink, not alot of complexity to it, but still a pleasure to drink."
"Thank you Andre for bringing it to fake thanksgiving."
"Overall a very nice slow sipper with some unique smells and flavors."
"Pours garnet with an average sized head that leaves webs of lacing as it dissipates. The aroma primarily consists of roasted malts and spices, though a bit of hop character and alcohol shine through as well. The taste is not as sweet as the aroma would suggest. Roasted/caramel malts dominate while the hops play their part and balance things out by providing just enough bitterness. The alcohol is well masked. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with enough carbonation to lightly prickle the tongue. Overall, this is a solid beer that I look forward to each year."
"This beer pours a deep red and brown color with a nice head. It has a nice spicy sweet smell. This beer has sweet malt with a rich spice and a hop back. It has a clean smooth feel with a nice finish. This beer was pretty good. It drank easy and had a good flavor. As far as a winter beer goes its not the best Ive had but it is worth drinking if you have the chance."
"The body is a dark ruby color with a thick tan head that dwindled down to a thin ring around the glass. Lace left behind after each drink. A malty, caramel aroma with a touch of alcohol in the nose. Slightly sweet taste due to the malt. Some hop tingle on the tongue, spices, and a tinge of alcohol. A nice balance. A medium-bodied beer with a decent amount of carbonation. I can handle one or two in a sitting, but I think anymore would be overkill."
"Thanks to babydoc for sending this for my BA annv."
"Pours with a sparkling, foamy, robust head. Aroma is crisp, delicate, yet inviting and familiar - malty with the slightest piney hint. Color was a deep, barely translucent mahogany brown. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected, but smooth with ample, yet delicate carbonation. I was expecting the flavor to be a torrent of clichéd malts, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a slowly developing medium bodied dry flavor, with mere hints of roasted malts and an oakey depth."
"A nice, drinkable seasonal offering from Bridgeport in Portland OR."
"It's a solid beer, and a good winter warmer."
"Overall it seems to be a nice drinking brew, not overwhelming but not spectacular either."
"This is a very drinkable brew, especially on a cold night. I got it for $8 a six-pack, and it may be over-priced at that amount. I'll have Ebenezer again this winter for sure, but I'll look for it on sale."
"D: I gotta be honest here...the smell led me to believe this was going to be special, but the taste was a let down. This beer is very conservative."
"Notes: I could pull back a few of these without thinking of a change of pace."
"Nice warming alcohol afterwards as you savor the last sip."
"D: I could see drinking a few of these in a night, although with other winter warmers out now I doubt I would do so. Worth a try though, although currently its hard to consider it winter when its 90 degrees outside"
"Pours a deep red with a great amount of clarity and a decent head and retention. Aroma is slight, fruity, malty. Taste is refreshing, nothing special, but well blended and balanced. I think I pick a sweet cherry flavor in this, hops are none to speak of. The alcohol is well hidden. It is refreshing, and nice. Not offensive at all... but not outstanding..."
"Pours a dark garnet with a finger or two of cappucino froth on top. Nose is a striking apricot potpurri and peach schnapps. Taste continues with the schnapps, buttressed by christmas cookie spice and caramel malt. Mouthfeel is thin for a winter warmer, but welcome on a hot day like today. An interesting warmer here, smells delicious, tasted pretty good. Not overboard on the cinnamon and nutmeg like most in the style. Perhaps the age did this old man well."
"D - This was one of the beers in a Winter Brews 10 pack from Cost Plus World Market for $9. This is the first one I tried. If this is any indication of the rest of the box, this is a great deal. Not a bad winter warmer."
"Easy drinking and pleasant but could have been better."
"The mouthfeel is very fizzy and dry with a medium body. The alcohol is hardly noticed and has no warming effect. It's a bit too sweet for my liking and as a winter warmer...there are many others that I prefer."
"This is quite good; I've had some bad luck with winter beers this year, but this is one of the better ones. It's up there with Anchor's OSA."
"Pours leaving no head, just a fine ring around the outside. Dark plum in color. The aroma is very faint. Just minor hints of raspberry fruit, nutty hops, and mild alcohol. Taste also has a low potency, although its a nice mix of cherry, raspberry, caramel and other sweet malt flavors. I would say it wasn't very spicy as you might expect from a winter warmer. Hops are low, taste is fairly dry, finish is kind of boring. Carbonation is nice, but its a bit thin/watery and could use more body. Drinkability is average, I would expect more overall flavor from this style of beer..."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a dense 1"" tan head above the dark red brew. Head lasts and lasts, with heavy frothy lacing. Aroma is lightly hoppy and spicy. Taste is biscuity malts upfront, moving into spicy hops and dark fruits. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with nice drinkability as well. Very approachable for the sometimes overdone winter warmer style."
"Body is barely medium, but smooth and creamy, making it a pleasant drinker. If you're looking for a big, beefy, complex Winter Warmer, you may want to look elsewhere. This has a distinctly mild English nuance about it."
"Pours a nice dark brown/ruby color, a little bit of carbonation, nice small head that dissaptes quickly, some nice lacing afterwards. Scents of chocolate, and fruits, slight malt as well. The taste is very nice of malt and sweet fruits (cherry), with a very little bitter aftertaste. Medium body. Very drinkable, would highly recommend. Not much of a warmer, but very tasty in deed."
"BridgePort's Ebenezer Ale is something of a Scrooge when it comes to ingredients, but is still a worthwhile beer. If you're looking for a boldly flavored, full-bodied, spice-intensive, complex sipper of a winter warmer, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a reasonably tasty, sessionable, 'snowblower' version of the style, then Ebenezer is your man."
"Brown with some ruby highlights. Pillowy off-white head that quickly disappeared. The aroma is mostly spices and spruce. Sweet malty taste, some toffee, chocolate, cinnamon, but nicely balanced with a light hop finish. Creamy mouthfeel with lots of tiny bubbles. Try this one with some gingersnaps and you won't regret it!"
"I like this beer but I really don't find spiced beer terribly drinkable. Thanks to Brewbacca for the brew."
"Drinkability: Interesting flavor combinations that I enjoyed even though it is a bit more bitter than the typical Winter Warmer"
"Drinkability was actually too good. On the whole, winter warmers seem like sipping beers to me, and I had one Ebenezer in me before I even noticed!"
"Carbonation tickles the tongue before a creamy celery flavour is joined at the party by some roasted malt. There is a slight hint of banana in the aftertaste. Hops are apparent but never dominant although they do seem to play more of a role as the beer warms. This seems like a less potent (in taste not alcohol terms), more subtle take on Deschutes Jubelale. It is well balanced and very pleasant."
"Poured a rich amber with an ample creamy looking head that left sheets of lace as it settled,aroams are pretty subtle I picked up some cherry and cinnamon mainly but not real strong.This warmer has some complexities that make me give it higher taste ratings although they dont blow your mind,holiday spice cinnamon nutmeg maybe a touch of clove and dark fruit over top a bready-like elemant I really liked the somewhat earthy dryer finish .A tad thin I think I was hoping for something robust but its quaffable for a winter seasonal.Like I said there is some complexities but the beer is pretty subtle,not bad."
"An OK winter beer here but I know of many that are better. Nice strong spiced ESB is what this really is. Tasty but it isn't as drinkable as many others are."
"Good session beer up and down."
"D: There's just not enough going on here to warrant drinking much of this at 6.4%."
"A very disappointing seasonal ale. Poorly brewed and poorly fermented. Blech. Down the sink it goes. Pee-Yoo-Sa!"
"This beer pours a nearly garnet reddish brown with a tan two-finger head with good retention and wispy lacing. The smell is of dark, heavy citrus with a caramelly malted undertow. The flavor and mouthfeel explode together as rich caramel and chocolate flavors intermingle with herbal and fruity hop tastes. The finish is moderately long, but the feel is very carbonated (but not overly so) and creamy. This beer is crisper and spicier than a lot of other winter ales and I havent stopped thinking about it since I drank it."
"Smell is malty with spice and a little piney hops. Medium body with a very dry finish. Some alchohol warming is noticable. Taste is very spicy which hides much of the malty sweetness. Not bad but could be smoother or more balanced."
"This beer pours a dark brown, with a red tint to it. The head is tan. It fades slowly leaving very few laces. It smells slightly fruity. It also has a slightly spicy aroma. There is not much to the aroma. I think the only thing I can put a name to is a slight grape like aroma. I can not detect any hop presence. It has a nice toasted malt taste. I can taste grapes slightly. As with the arome, I taste no hops at all. It has a very slight cinnimon taste, but not much. This beer is sort of lacking on flavor and aroma. Perhaps some more hops and some spices would help. This beer goes down smooth. It is carbonated well. It leaves a sweet taste on my palate. This beer would make a good session beer because it is low in alcohol, and the flavor is very non aggressive. I doubt I will try this one again."
"Not much smell to this one. When I finally figured out what I thought I was smelling, I took a taste and realized that it was a grape/red wine smell. Maybe a mulled wine. This one didn't taste bad and would be a good warmer but I did feel like someone had taken a standard beer with some nice maltiness and thrown in a splash of wine. I can't think of too often that I would want that. I usually want a wine or a beer. But not together."
"Very drinkable. I could see myself using this as a winter warmer. Did the trick tonight, with a bit of chill in the 50 degree air..."
"More drinkable than other warmers, although I believe aging for too long may not be in the cards."
"Mouthfeel: Smooth, but nothing special. As I have this winter warmer in mid-march, I wonder if it would have tasted in the brutal coldness of mid-january."
"12 oz. brown bottle with a picture of Scrooge himself on it. Maroon/Scarlet body, with a 1/2"" of foamy tan head. Smell is slightly cinnamon and giner, and also slightly hoppy. Taste is a nice winter warmer, very easy to drink. Alcohol and plenty of different spices abound. Mouthfeel is very creamy, appearing almost flat but does offer a slight tingle when swallowed. Aftertaste is slightly coffee and chocolate, but the spices dominate this beer. Good sipping, but not overwhelming. I thank babydoc for the sample of this beer."
"Thanks, babydoc!"
"I am not much for winter beers, and I note that my reviews tend to be rated lower for these styles, but overall this is a decent version."
"A dark mahogany body reveals cherry-stained highlights when held to the light; and it's creamy off-white head holds quite well and leaves some nice splashes of lace at the outset of the glass. Some vinous and cherry-like notes greet you in the nose, followed by a waft of chocolate and caramel. Overall, the aroma is somewhat restrained, but what's there is very nice. In the mouth it's medium-full bodied and creamy with a moderate, natural carbonation. The flavor, not unlike the aroma, is somewhat limited as well. The notes of cherry remain (they're not sweet, but still cherry-like), and the delicate cocoa flavor is there as well; but overall it's very restrained. Some alcohol is present but it's unobtrusive; and some leafy hops emerge in the dry finish. As a fan of English-style beers I can say that this makes a decent pint, but I'd imagine most American beer lovers will be left looking for more."
"This beer departs the bottle a deep red color with a 2 finger head that falls to coat the beer. I get some piney and citrus hop and a very sweet malty core on the nose. The flavor is actually a little thin; very fleeting. There is a nice sweet malt, but it tastes like there are some spices in there that I'm not too keen on. I'm not really into the spiced beers all that much. The feel is moderate to thick, but something about it makes it seem thin. Overall, a ho-hum beer. Just okay as far as the nice winter beers go."
"Overall Impression: Tasty and quite drinkable - but not a standout in any category."
"But if you like a well crafted stronger than average ale, this one might be for you. Amber right on the edge of brown with a decent head, this one is nicely balanced. Malt flavor comes through with a few more hops than you would find in marzen or similar. No spices or other fruit flavors did I notice. This is the type of beer I wish I had been guzzling in my teenage years, rather than bud or Natty Ice. Type of beer you can drink all night, enjoy the taste of, but not feel too bad about missing the the intricacies of the flavor once you get smashed."
"Drinkability- Have had many better winter beers than this one, although it's still worth a try. Just a bit boring to me."
"POS on 6 pack says it is ""formidable enough to temper even the crankiest of spirits"". Well it worked for me, I was in a bad mood and now Im not. lol"
"On first taste I thought it was too bitter too soon. Too harsh needs to be smooth for the introduction. The overall taste was good though. Its a little smokey, fruity and malty all at once and is a good warmer. A pinch of added spice from the hops makes this a choice beer as a winter warmer."
"Still, Ebenezer is a worthy brew and holds together quite well as a strong bitter."
"A very nice winter warmer, one that gives Samuel Smith's and Anchor Steam's seasonals a solid run for their money. I'm tempted to save the last bottle and see what a year of bottle conditioning might do to the flavor. Snap it up if you can find it this winter!"
"Dark with ruby red highlights. Big head leaning toward tan. Smells like hops followed by some sort of spice. This is loaded with hop flavor backed with a tartness that is unfamiliar. I like it though. I had earlier commented to friend that this beer wasn't that good. But now that I've made it through half the six pack I have come to like it."
"Pleasant!"
"This ale hit the spot. Picked this up at Trader Joe's and wish I would have got more. Pours a very dark amber color with a dark choclolate mocha head that lasted the whole time drinking. The smell is that of roasted wood and malts, very different but good. The taste is of citrus and dark roasted malts. Maybe cider tasting in this as well. The hops are strong but not to strong. Very good for an ale. The mouthfeel is light and fruity but has density. I could drink alot of these. Very good beer."
"Thanks Genaro!"
"Ebeneezer Ale 2003. The color was dark amber/gold. It had a short-lived head with very little lace. The aroma was fragrant and citrusy (grapefruity) with caramel tones. The taste was composed of sweet caramel, citrus, and hints of roasted coffee. It had a bit of oily mouthfeel with a good hop bite. The finish was dry, citrusy, slightly sweet, and noticably astringent. It was a good beer, but not an exciting one. A minor point was the rather somber-colored Victorianesque label which I think needed some bright seasonal colors."
"This is a nice brew and if it were a little thicker I would really enjoy it on a cold winters nite like tonite."
"A holiday beer exchange request on my part, sought out and found by mrpicklerelish, many thanks. It pours a deep mahogany color with a large soft fluffy off white head. Web like lace, very nice. The aroma was fruity, cranberry, yet a hint of sweet perhaps from the spiced malt. The spice carried over in the taste but not to strong while other flavors of caramel and raisin are balanced nice by an alcohol backed hop. The alcohol is soothing, not harsh making this a soft and mellow easy drinker.(if you like spiced beers) The mouth is left alittle dry while alittle hop lingers. Thisone makes a nice festive winter warmer."
"Kev"
"Drinkability  This went down well enough, but it simply cant keep pace with the many other good examples found in this category."
"Pours a dark maroon with brown highlights. Virtually no head but nice carbonation and great lace. Aroma is sweet, depp heavy malt with molasses and caramel with a hint of chocolate. Taste is sweet malt with dry alocoholic biscuity middle with some pronounced spicy bitterness on the back end."
"This is a mildly rich beer that is very easy to drink. A fine holiday beer that can be enjoyed anytime."
"I wasn't too impressed with this beer at first taste but it quickly grew on me and I was amazed at how easily drinkable it became. A nice after dinner relaxer."
"The Ebeneezer Ale poured a dark mahogany with a good light tan head made up of medium sized bubbles that quickly went down to a thin layer. It has a nice, complex aroma of malts, spices with some fruitiness and alcohol. The initial taste is malts with some sweet, yet tart, fruitiness. It has a nice hop finish with a kind of mediciney aftertaste. The tastes mellowed out and balanced better as I drank more and it warmed up."
"Big thanks to Gusler for providing!"
"A very clear amber color when held up to the light, otherwise it is brown with a tan head. Aroma notes of raisin, rum, perhaps some cherry, definitely malty and an ale. Lightly sweet in the front, there are notes and hints of chocolate, raisins, and other dark fruits. A bit over carbonated for a beer that should be served at cellar temperatures, though a quick swirling of my glass takes care of this deficiency. A smooth cream soda type of feel & taste to this beer. Evokes memories of vanilla. Curiously this bottle conditioned ale has the least amount of sediment (barely a faint ring at the bottom) I have ever seen in a bottle conditioned ""real"" ale. Definitely a nice beer to be sipping on a cold fall night."
"A dark ruby, amber-tinted beer. The aroma and first sip are very herbal, with some light spiciness, and a sprucey hop bitterness. Malts slowly assert themselves to be sweet, toffeeish and dominant. I'm not sure what, if any, spices were used here but there does seem to be an overwhelming herbalness. This may be solely from the hops. Over time, the malts stretch themselves out and really carry the beer. Mouthfeel is decidedly unsticky which is welcome for such a sweet, malty beer. I didn't particularly like it at first, but over the course of the pint it really sank its claws into me and at the end I wanted another. This may be due to its excellent aftertaste."
"Poured a clear deep red, with a thick white head. The Aroma is a blend of fruity esters and spicy hops.The taste is rich with a sweet carmel malt background and a bitter finish. A little higher gravity makes this a great beer to have during the winter."
"Bottle purchased at Jim's Homebrew in Spokane for $1.09. Poured a reddish brown with a modest head that didn't hang around for more than a couple of minutes. Fairly complex, perfumy aroma with sweet malts and elements of tropical fruits, cinnamon and pepper. Taste starts out with sweet fruity malt flavor along with a peppery zing, ending with a well balanced dry hoppy finish. Mouthfeel was average - neither thick nor thin. Not a bad thing to sip on a cold November day as I watch the Seahawks batter the Lions."
"O - Overall this is a pretty tasty brew, a multi tiered malt profile and enough hops make this a slightly different brew."
"On the pour, the beer appears a deep amber color with the head purposeful in size and frothy in texture, the left over lace is a fine sheet to coat the glass. Big malt nose, caramel, crisp and clean with a sweet start. Top is moderate in feel, the finish pertinently carbonated, provocatively hopped with a dry aftertaste."
"Nice creamy, thick mouthfeel that I love in this style of beer. The carbonation helps to cut the rich mouthfeel and adds to the drinkability. A nice beer, certainly worth trying."
"Quite drinkable tonight ..theres a wee bit of chill in the air and this goes down well."
"Dark amber color, medium head. Aroma is cherry. Mild tasting ale, mild malts and slightly spicy, although its more fruity than malty. Kind of an average and mild tasting beer, as winter warmers go. There is a slightly metallic taste. Mouthfeel is a little harsh. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is little bitter and somewhat fruity."
"Originally sampled on 12 March 2003. I am writing this review from my notes. This beer is hazy copper colored w/ virtually no head. it has a slightly sweet taste up front w/ a clean finish. In the nose, I can get a hint of molasses. Thanks for this one, beerguy101"
"It pours a medium-dark brown body with a small cream head. The aroma is lemon and the smell of tomato plants during picking or tobacco. As for taste, there isn't much. There's a hint of sweet malt and maybe a little bit of spice and slightly sour at the end."
"Poured a nice dark brown with a off white foam with a nice lace. The smell was of malty grains and hops with a hint of mountain pine. The taste was also pleasant, with malty grains, hops and a hint of spices and a touch of citrus. The sweet bitterness is well balanced on the palate.."
"A rich and sweet tasting ale that delivers hints of toffee, caramel, and a hint of spiciness. I enjoyed this both as an afternoon warming drink as well as an after dinner teaser to go along with some left over Xmas cake. A double duty brew that's worth taking a closer look at when the opportunity arises."
"Many thinks to my roomy and the person that did the beer exchange. Otherwise I may never have tasted this beer. The smell is sweet with a hint of hops. Pours amber in color with a small head. The mouthfeel is so mellow and smooth and a bit dry. Well balanced and easy drinking for a higher alcohol beer. I do get that warming feeling in the end as well."
"Deep dark reddish color. Nice fuzzy light tan head. Malty, rich sweet smell. Sweetness, noticable cherries taste. Subtle hoppy finish. Thin warming feel, and finish.  Lugged this one back from California vacation, wasn't skunked. Nice fruity, winter beer. Very appropriate for the style. Great name and label as well, nothing like old Scrooge staring back at you from a beer bottle..............."
