"Poured a three finger tan leather head with fine retention and lacing. Dark red and brown, but not cloudy. Aromas of raisins and espresso with some fig as well. Noting some cloves and the smallest hint of mint. Tastes like aroma, with addition of milk chocolate and black cherry. Feel is balanced, smooth, and moderate carbonation lingering toward front of tongue. Higher alcohol does not overwhelm my tongue in this beer. This is a great winter brew, and widely available for about a dollar each. I love the complexity, balance, strength and price all rolled into one."

"Not something year round, at least for me, but in the cold winter, this tastes pretty good."

"This was an average winter warmer."

"Appearance is a deep mahogany with garnet Ruby red clarity at the edges. A beige head settles and leaves great lacing. The first smell is of cherry sweetness and some smokey roast, with vanilla, caramel and oak.  Delicious flavor with tons of complexity. Smoked wood, lingering oak, slight hop bitterness imparts some musty earth flavor. A bit of cherry, oak, caramel, toffee, and slight vanilla character. Medium bodied, medium low carbonation. The alcohol is slightly hidden but nice and warming. Overall this is one of the best winter warmers out there and the price point makes it affordable enough to knock back more than one without feeling guilty. Extremely complex and layered flavors. Highly recommended."

"12 oz. bottle. Pours a dark mahogany with little to no head. The aroma is mild up front and lightly sweet with notes of dark chocolate, cherry, coffee, banana, and pipe tobacco. Taste is Belgian yeast with a very nice hop burst. The hop bitterness complements the sweetness perfectly. A hint of Clove is also noticed. There is a nice middle of sweet, roasted malts. The finish is dry with nice bitterness and coffee lingering in the throat. This is an excellent winter warmer; complex and well-balanced."
""
"Body seems fuller at first sip but is medium really. Effervescence is sharp at the tip of the tongue but just for a split second. Warming and pretty dry, especially in the middle. Some lingering dark fruit & wood, though."

"Dark brown almost purple color with one and a half finger head. Smells delicious, mostly malt (fig, brown sugar) but it has a tremendous amount of piney and floral hops to balance it out.  The flavor is great. A lot of toffee and caramel with just the perfect amount of hop bitterness on the edges. Even better than I remembered."

"O- Pretty decent malty winter beer. Pretty good flavors come through."
""
""
"It was a very nice winter beer. I’d have it again."
"Overall: This is a fantastic go-to choice for a winter warmer. Great nuttiness, fruitcake like fruitiness, and a spicy warmth to it couple with a great thick body and smooth finish make this an outstanding choice."

"Poured a rich dark red with a thin white head and thin lacing. Smells of dark fruit and chocolate. Tastes as it smells with a wonderful warming from the alcohol. The hops and alcohol balance out the strong malt backbone to create a very balanced and very delicious ale. Definitely one of the best winter warmers available, especially for the price."
"interesting winter warmer, glad to try it"
"Mouth: Decent body, maybe a little on the thin side, medium carb."
"Overall, a winter warmer I can appreciate; not overspiced and not so sweet you have to chase it with insulin. Delightfully chewy. Drives, IMHO, Mad Elf back into the underbrush."
""
"Not a bad warmer. I like the lack of big spice flavors."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, best by 2/28/13. Pours a beautiful ruby red with a one inch off white head that leaves behind some attractive lace. Smell is caramel, biscuit, some pine, tangerine, brown sugar, and a hint of nutmeg. Taste surprises with a hit of chocolate and some grapefruit up front and the other flavors blend in through out. Body is medium, plenty of life, not dry, and very drinkable. This is really good and different another beer I will be drinking during the holiday season."

"Full sail, hats off to you. I'm a fan of your beers, but this one is really outstanding, the best you've made yet."

"Nothing really good to say about this beer... typical taste that is far from a Winter Ale.. for the most part taste like an Oktoberfest... starting to wonder if the 7.2% ABV is really true... I drank 6 of them in a 3 hour period and felt no more of a kick then if I drank 6 5.0% brews.. not impressed even with the 90 day's availability-theme on the label... one of the reason's I bought it and never will again! Not trying to be a sour puss but this brew is far from a solid brew that deserves top ratings I have had WAY better."

"The Verdict: Pretty good. Good balance of malts and hops, and not too spicy like many winter warmers tend to be. A solid brew like most of Full Sail's offerings."
""
""
""
"O: A ton of hop character on top of a stodgy malt body. It comes on a bit strong, but as a winter beer it works. Not for the faint of heart, but it'll warm your cockles on a cold winter day."
""

"From a bottle into a pint glass, small head quickly fades leaving good lacing and a thin cap which persists. Very dark brown with ruby/chestnut notes when held to light. Nose: Sweet and toasted malt, chocolate notes, actually very nice. Tastes of sugary and burnt malt, hints of coffee and chocolate. Mouth is nicely chewy, viscous, quenching, and smooth, very complementary to flavor profile. Overall: A pleasant surprise. I’m not usually a fan of Winter Ales but this one is quite tasty. As a bonus, one of my “non-beer” friends really liked this one, probably because of the sweet, chocolate flavor profile. Would definitely seek out again."

"O - Christmas-winter ale. A good standard, but still solid."
""

"Strangely enough, it's still wintery in Florida, and this has four more days until it's best by date. Wassail pours a murky brown color with a large head that laces wonderfully. The aroma is muddled, providing a nondescript maltiness and spiciness. The taste fares better though, offering a much more rich malt experience along with a touch of nuttiness that goes very well with the spices. Malty bitterness lingers through the finish. The mouthfeel is pretty standard, it goes down easily without highlight, and the drinkability is pretty solid. Overall, it's a good winter warmer that's cheap."
""
""
""
"Overall- One of my favorite winter seasonals."
""
""
""
"a very enjoyable wintery brew, lacking in spice and sweet, which makes me happy. pours really dark brown with a faint orangey glow, inch of fading khaki head on top. the aroma is really malt forward, dark and well toasted, maybe some unmalted barley in here too, its got that roasty bitter aromatic. flavor is more balanced than the nose, less bitter than expected, and the malts take on more of a breakfast cake character, molassas without the sweetness, gentle and distinct, easily on of the better full sail beers ive had. the feel works too, really lazy carbonation contributes to a heavier vibe, but the body is fairly light despite its color, slides right down no problem. sessionable id day, but the well hidden abv might sneak up on you after a few. either way i really enjoyed this as a slow sipper, letting it come up to room temperature to let the full malt complexity unfold. well done, i know its hard to resist spicing the bejeezus out of these winter seasonals."

"Poured into a 16oz goblet. A nice 2 finger dirty white foamy head on pour, settled down to 1 finger, with a fair amount of cling. Color was a very dark rich brownish red with a bit of transparency. Aroma was a bit sweet up front, then shifted to a bit of a spicy finish. Hints of pepper and a few other similar aromas. Flavor was initially subtle, then finished with a bit of bite. Started off creamy and smooth, then picked up some pepper, before leaving a bitter hops flavor in the mouth. Felt a bit off in the mouth, coated well, but not in the front of the mouth area, but more towards the back of the mouth. Overall a nice winter warmer. Not as overpoweringly spicy as some, but with enough flavor and kick to stand up to the cold."

"Not sure if the recipe on this changes every year or not but this is the 2012 version. Beautiful nutty brown color, clear and has small bubbles coming up from bottom entire time. Aromas of raisin, prune and dark fruit. Roasted smell too, with a creamy light tan head. Leaves a nice lace on glass. Sweetness strikes first, touch of vanilla and I get a hint of citrus zest. Spicy flavors follow with black pepper and a general nuttiness. Finish is a roasted coffee bitterness. Has a nice warming effect and a sort of foamy volume to it. One of the best winter warmers I've had so far."
"It pours a dark red with a tan head it decent retention and beautiful lacing. The aroma is malty and spicy. There is also a strong pine a citrus hop presence. The taste is malty and woodsy with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. The finish reveals pine and coffee. There is light carbonation with a moderate/light mouthfeel. It is lighter in flavor than most other winter beers and it is incredibly refreshing in a season dominated by thick syrup-like brews. It is simply outstanding."

""

"Would I buy this beer again? Maybe."
"Very nice beer and a good example of the style. A little thick, but the taste is amazing and the smell wonderful. Well done."
""
""
"I wasn't sure what to expect with this beer. But wow! This beer exceeded all expectations. As soon as I cracked open the bottle, a nice aroma of sweet malted hops hit my nose. Upon inspection I noticed the exact right amount of carbonation and lacing. The beer is wonderfully smooth and sweet and goes down exceptionally smooth. A very worthy effort and a pleasant surprise."
""
""
"A very enjoyable winter warmer, a well executed hop profiles blends seamlessly into a great, dark malt profile."
"A hefty beer. Perfect for the cold weather."
""
""
"Overall, this is a great example of an ideal winter warmer. The spices are noticeable and help make the brew warm and lively, but they are in balance and not overbearing. It is also easy enough to drink that it could potentially serve as a session beer. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"O- High scoring, I just wish I could pick out more flavors in the taste. That would elevate it to a very good instead of a good."
""
"a nice malty sipper, probably better at a slightly warmer temp."
"first time ive had this beer this year. havent had many of the winter warmers but its definately got alot of flavor to it and cant go wrong being 7.2% ABV overall a really good beer would definitely have it on tap if i could find it..even for a darker beer it still has a lighter IPA taste with a hint of caramel? (maybe)"
""
""
""
""
"Overall-great beer to have during this season. Have one, it will warm you right up. Cheers!"
"O: A malty and moderately hoppy beer that fits the bill of a holiday ale in my house having no fruit nor spice and a good hops showing. I want a bit more in the nose from the hops and the malt but then it would almost be a dark IPA. It's a great looking beer. Don't drink this one to cold our you miss the best parts which are subtle fruity and hops flavors."
""
""
"OMG! This is simply excellent. I am also one that judges by style. I don't compare a craft against adjunct. Its apples to apples with me. This is one great beer period! I had mine in a frosted mug. The beer was just chilled not cold and the first drink was heaven. It is well balanced and full of flavor. Try it before it is no longer availible."

"O/D-A solid Winter Warmer. I enjoyed the rather noticeable hoppiness. One of the better Winter Warmers in my opinion. Might try it again next Winter."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like this one a lot. I paid 1.50 for this bottle and will get another before the season ends."
""
"A lackluster head and scent, great taste. The 7.2% is greatly masked and I whizzed through the bottle. I think this is one of the better winter beers I've had. Easy to drink, smooth, tasty and well made for the season. I'll have to bring some to Christmas dinner."
"overall, definitely glad I tried this one!"
""
"Overall - Solid winter warmer from Full Sail. Roasted malt meets an assertive, grassy hop bitterness. I can see myself at the top of the hill, ordering this beer before the first run of the day. Nice job, Full Sail."
""
"D+"
""
"O: wow that is good, I do not regret the 6pack."
"Pours dark brown with a thin foam that settles on top. The color turns to red quickly. It has a great nutty, caramely aroma and with a taste to match. Rich, with a strong taste of candied walnuts and a pleasing foamy, and just a bit bitter finish. This is a great beer."
"Overall a nice beer that I probably won't revisit. But I did enjoy it till the last drop."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  ""Here we go a wassailing along..."". That's all I know!  Anyways, this is a well rounded winter warmer. Tons of malt, and spicy booze and hops to balance it out.  Once warned it transforms to a much more aggressive warmer. I would love to have this on a cold evening hayride. Cheers!"
"Russet brown, big khaki head. Heavy caramel, treacle, shortbread, roasted nuttiness, faint coffee. Nice balanced vein of earthy, spicy hop flavor. Bit of fruit and mineral from the yeast. Just the way I like my winter warmers - NO spices, rich complex flavors, in a small enough beer that I can drink a pint or two. Ridiculous value at $6.75/sixer."
"Well worth giving this winter warmer a try"
"I wish the FSB website had more details on the recipie. I'd really like to know specifically what went into this divine brew. Tried this last year and was highly ambivalent, but this year's batch is really memorable."
""
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a very dark mahogany amber, with a half finger light tan head with good retention and lacing. Light aroma of sweet caramel malt, dark dried fruit, lightly vegetal hops. Flavor dominated by sweet bready malt and winter spices, particularly cinnamon and nutmeg. Finishes with hop and spice bitterness, with the spicing nicely balanced with the bitterness. Somewhat subdued flavor, but overall nicely balanced and pleasant to drink. Medium bodied. Spicing is great for a wassail and I'll grab another one of these during the holidays."
""

"Overall this winter warmer held up nice for the months it been on the shelf. I would be curious to try this again fresh."
""

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle bottle into a tulip glass, best by 2/23/12 (?) on the back. This pours a dark brown with a smallish tan head which has good retention. The smells are of spices, caramel, other malts, no hops by now. The feel is medium. The taste is good, lots of malts, some spices, a definite alcohol presence."

"Poured into a wine glass, a deep and glowing mahogany lurks beneath an off-white head. Aroma is of a cool and mildly peppermint spiced candy. Dark fruit, perhaps prune, rides sweetly along a complementary deep toasted malt blend backbone. Robust but smooth body with a warming feel in the finish."
""
""
""
""
"Firstly, I am unexperienced tasting this style. This brew poured a deep brown, mahogany, has some ruby tints. Head does not retain. Scent is earthy, woody, some fruit as well. Taste is not as sweet as I expected, Hoppy and bitter, some bitter fruit rind can be detected. Mellows as it warms. Mouthfeel is crisp and bitter. But pleasantly so. Overall, an enjoyable beer, I am glad I tried this one."
"As described by Full sail, this beer pours a mahogany color. Head is light tan, very thick, dense, good retention. As I drink it leaves some very nice lacing. Body of the beer is too thick to really see into. Very pretty beer. Smell is of floral hops and a little caramel malt, very crisp clean smell. Taste starts with a bit of earthy bitterness, then I get some of the more roasty malts. Ends with an piney bitterness, and a touch of light sweetness once it has really left the tongue, maybe a little bit of a citric hop in there or something. I haven't let this warm up too much yet, but I have not yet detected any alcohol taste. Mouthfeel is just a little heavy, perfect mouthfeel when designing a winter warmer for hop lovers. Overall this is a really solid beer, I'll be buying more of this next winter. It's a fantastic nightcap for the beer lover who doesn't want to drink a $7 22oz bottle. Well done Full Sail!"

"O-not a bad beer, just not a memorable one, I like it but wouldn't want a 6er too many other good /better beers out there for me. Solid average beer."

"Great balance, carbonation, color, complexity. Cannot detect the 7% in any way."

"Taste is malty, with some light hop bitterness. Doesn't have a particular flavor, just malty without the winter spice or sugar I expected. Light medium body. Overall a decent beer, but better examples of the style exist."
"This is the 2011 version at 6.5% ABV"
""
"This is a nice winter warmer. It has a nice hopiness to it but also has a creamy taste to it like a stout. In the smell I get spices and hops maybe some caramel. The taste is really nice and I really get some nice breadiness and then a nice smooth hop aftertaste. Overall this is one I would drink every winter and I will look for it in the future."
"O: Overall, this beer looks and feels great, but the hops were a bit too much for me given the style. Not bad though."

"Overall - 4/5 on all counts. Delicious but if your not in the mood for a hoppy beer, this is not your drink."

"I thought Full Sail was supposed to be good. This is meh."

""
""
""
"Grabbed a single at Princeton's Liquors. The aroma is a bit sharp with alcohol, but there's also a pleasant mix of banana and date, and brown, bready malt. I really like the roasty edge to the flavor. It blends in with the dark fruit and crusty cocoa barley flavor for a wonderfully-balanced American take on the style. I had a Deschutes Jubelale the night before and prefer this winter warmer, despite the lower hoping rate. Great beer."

"Price Point - 6pk/$8.99"

"Pours a clear super dark crimson brown with a 1 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a thin film. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasty malt and some caramel aromas. Taste is of toasty malt, caramel, and some dry spice flavors. There is a medium amount of spice bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a somewhat smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good Winter warmer but nothing all that great. I am not really a fan of the spice bitterness that this beer leaves in the mouth."
""
""
"Medium bodied with medium but sharp carbonation."
""
""
""
"Not a fan of the spiced winter warmers, so this is a nice departure. Will pick this one up again."
"Overall this beer is very close to being excellent. If the maltiness and hoppiness would meld just a little bit more. I would get it regularly, though, if it were available closer to me."
""
"Full Sail Wassail is a wonderfully clear, dark, copper ale that has a dense, bubbly, light khaki head that leaves solid sheets on the glass. It smells fruity and medicinal with hints of cherry and mint. There's a grassy whiff to it. It's thick and fluffy and the finish is kind of like sand paper on your tongue. It tastes hot and bitter. There are notes of orange and wood with the bitterness of furniture polish to shine up the flavor. It certainly has zazzle. This is a very aggressive beer and sometimes it comes off as rude. It's powerful and untamed."
"O - A decent beer. the nice balance of roast with citrus character makes me keep drinking."
""
""
"This has the appearance of foamy soda, very bubbly and caramel-brown colored. Not much aroma comes through. The flavor is all out of wack. There’s a harsh clove taste to it that dominates, and a sharp finish. It manages to be bitter without any hoppiness. Next year I’ll pass."
"Endearing as an ale that exhibits mostly the flavors of English Strong Ales or younger Old Ales, and that of Brown Ales and American Strong Ales- a blend that's all classy, experimental, and ecclectic."
""
"O - Not bad. I had this beer a few weeks ago and thought it was a complete failure. I decided to give it another try. I'm glad I did. While I don't think this beer is great, I do think it's a decent winter ale to have when you want to grab a sixer of something. I don't see myself grabbing this beer a third time though."
" A dry toasty cocoa and mildly roasted malt flavor leads to a slight pine note from the hops with a nice flavor accenting the mild caramel from the malt which segues into a dark cherry note and the subtle dried fruit tinges as hinted at by the nose. There is some yeast flavor with the nice dry toasted malt and mild coffee-like tinges. I get a light brown sugar compliment in the finish with subtle alcohol flavors that round out the taste. Overall I liked having this again, but my first review of it. I enjy the overall high drinkability for a strong brown spicy ale. This is perfect for late fall/winter drinking...I would buy this again."
""
""
"The mouthfeel reminds me of when something slushy like Jell-O gets sucked through a straw."
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad beer from this brewery. I think I have an imperial in my stash, but this was a good one to get me acquainted with this brewery from OR. Will be looking for more of this in the future."
"I love this beer. I had to hold it up to the window to peek through the beer. The view of my neighborhood seemed to be filtered by the sepia setting on my camera. Perfect lacing. I wish I could comment more on the smell but my nose is stuffed up. The taste was wonderful - Angels at a track meet stomping all over my tastebuds. My mind chased the bitter, smokey, sweet and malty tastes swirling in my mouth cave. Each swallow is like a curtain opening down my throat with exciting sensations. Damn, I love this beer."
"From the bottle stamped 040312-14:22-FL. Sampled on December 1, 2011. The pour is a handsome looking dark, mahogany amber with a silky, lasting head. Malts are clearly on the nose with a bread and biscuit lining and mellow hop character. I found the body to be about medium but also rather acidic or astringent. Sweet at first and then bitter after that when tasting it. The hop ending tends to be almost dry. Fairly well balanced."
"T: Have to say, I'm usually not very impressed by Full Sail, but this one's pretty good. A base of caramel, toffee and toasted malt with a strong backbone of pine hops that grow in bitterness as the beer warms. I'd have this one again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good brew, been trying all the full sail i can recently, have yet to be dissappointed."
""
"Taste of wood grilled cherries, caramel, with a hint of chestnut. Much ""lighter"" than the pour suggests. Overall, a very drinkable high abv winter warmer, but seems to be lacking the big wow factor."
"Clear dark chestnut hue under a nice, creamy off-white head. Spiced, lightly nutty, herbal hop aroma. Caramel and spice sweetness balanced with a solid earthy/piney hop presence. Fruity through the middle finishing dryish and lightly bitter. Solid, creamy body with a bit of tartness. Somewhat holiday-esque, without any overbearing spice. Pretty good..."
""
"Definitely a fine choice for a winter warming session beer."
""
""
"On the whole, I would say that this is a very good winter warmer. I feel it is more under-rated than it should be. Worth a try if you like winter warmers, you won't be disappointed."
"O: This is a solid winter warmer that straddles the line between traditional and New World takes on the style. Save this one for after dinner on a snowy night. Not bad at all. In fact, I could see this being a good gateway to traditional English warmers."
"O - A very tasty brew and a ""should try"" for fans of the style. Very interesting that this is not brewed with any holiday spices but manages to present all these holiday flavors. If you get a six pack and have the time for this, try letting one of the bottles warm up for twenty minutes or so before pouring. I really think this beer opens up with a little warmth. Also - don't use a pint glass. This beer deserves something that will open up the aroma. On a side note - I just started homebrewing and my first batch was a Full Sail Wassail clone. Looking forward to seeing how it compares. Ok, try this!"
""
""
""
""
"O - This is one of many reasons for which winter is my favorite season for beer shopping. A solid winter ale."
""
"One of the classic PNW winter warmers . This is a malt centric beer that shines a red brown in the glass. The beer has a long finish and though the hops are there it is the malt that really anchors the taste. I do like Jubelale better but this is still a great Xmas beer that at 7% can be a regular part of the Holiday beer fridge."
""
""
""
"O: I'd drink it again, but I won't stock in the house again probably."
""
""
""
""
"The appearance turned out to be wonderful. The lacing followed me all the way to the bottom of the glass, and while it was a tiny bit patchy, it was still very present, and not weak like some patchy lacing is. The head didn't last forever but it had pretty good retention and it looked really nice a pillowy when it was poured. On top of all of that it had a nice looking body. The only reasons this beer didn't look perfect was because the lacing was a little bit patchy and the head didn't last forever, but whatever, it's still a great looking beer."
"Overall-Not a tasty beer, don't buy it."
"Pretty unremarkable but quite drinkable. More of a regular amber with some bark in the flavor. I always look forward to the holiday beers but I prefer ones with a distinctive roast malt or a zippy hop to go with the sweetness. But keep the cinnamon, thanks."
"D - A very good warmer that only shows its abv when it needs to."
"Overall - Had the burnt malt flavor and carbonation not been as strong, I would've loved this beer. It does start out promising, but in the end I felt disappointed and felt that this could've been better; There are better Winter Warmers out there than this"
"O- Enjoyable beer. I had pretty average expectations for this, and came out really pleasantly surprised. It may just be that I like the winter warmer style ale quite a lot."
"D - a very nice smooth drinking winter warmer that is not over the top but still a very good one."
"This is a really drinkable winter warmer - there are spices present but not at all overpowering. I would excitedly drink this again."
"Overall this is an easily drinkable but pretty one-dimensional beer."
"This is one of the better beers I have ever had from Full Sail. It pours a ver dark, almost black, color and looks very enjoyable. The smell is very nice too. It has a lot of sweetness and a bit of roastedness. The taste is the best part of this beer. For some reason it reminds me of a Session Black Lager. It has a nice roasted taste with a bunch of flavor. I love the lingering after taste. The mouthfeel is good, but not great. It has some carbonation to the beer, but nothing special. Overall this is a very good beer. I have never had it before today and I have to say that I will be buying this again."
"A nice malty ale with enough bitterness to balance it out. Good."
"O - A litle all over the place, but a pretty solid brew. Nice work Full Sail."
"Pours a two finger cream head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Opaque brown color. Nose is burnt malts and flavor has hints of caramel with roasty bitterness. Lingering bitter aftertaste. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Taste, ample roasting, ample hopping, bitter, complex. Caramel despite the color seeming otherwise. Sweetness. Toffee. A balanced beer that allows both sides of the spectrum to shine. Alcohol definitely is warming. Not as smooth as most winter warmers, but I appreciate the hops and bitter bite to it. Some nutmeg. Mild flow of chocolate and dark fruit. Like I said, pretty complex, especially for Full Sail these days."
"O: A very well balanced winter warmer. The hops and malts are in perfect balance to make this beer smooth, and only slightly bitter. I could drink this all winter long (even though this is summer)."
"Poured a dark brown with ruby highlights, nice creamy off white head with good retention and lacing. Semi sweet and toasted malts with come caramel and toffee. Hint of coffee as well. Taste is toasted malts, slight sweetness, toffee, dark fruit, with a slight coffee bitterness at the finish. All of these tastes came together well for me. Mouthfeel a nice medium with good carbination until the end. Well done and will have more, you should give it a try."
"Pours a very dark brown with the visual consistency of peach fruit. Chocolate and mildly spicey aromas. Distinct bitterness from the Pacific Northwestern that gets more bitter as it warms, and yields more citrus orange taste, as wll as mace and nutmeg. Mouthfeel: consistency of fruit.Spider lace left in the glass.Bottle from Premier.A sipper."
"O - This was a nice surprise to find in Maryland...it was towards its expiration date but I found the flavors pronounced and not lacking at all...the malts were sweet with caramel and toffee flavors and those hops were a nice, bright addition"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a small white head. The aroma is caramel and toffee malt with some holiday spices: mainly nutmeg but a few other spices are mixed in as well. The flavor is full of holiday spices and caramel, as well as quite a bit of grassy and piney hops. This is definitely a highly-hopped winter warmer. The alcohol is also present and seems like it is higher than 7 percent. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not bad."
"I like it and would enjoy a 6 pack. I have to imagine it would have more hop aroma when it was younger, but it has a nice balance as it is."
"The feel of this beer is of a medium bodied beer with a nice drinkable feel to it. It goes down well and would go at any time of year not just for winter."
"Honestly, I opened this beer thinking that I would drink half of it and use the other half as a marinade because I expected something heavily spiced. That did not happen, I drank the whole thing. Argentinians use dry rub anyway."
"Drinks easy. I felt this one in my cheeks long before I wanted to stop drinking. Perfect for a cold night and not bad for a warm one either."
"Pairs well with all manner of food, but in particular I'd say it holds up well to heartier entrees, richer foods, and even bittersweet chocolates and lighter desserts."
"An easy winter warmer. Would of potentially enjoyed more traditional spices, but that often doesn't end well."
"The beer pours a chestnut brown elixir with a nice creamy cap of foam. The foam left plenty of lacing on the glass as it goes down. The aroma is caramel sweet and nutty grainy malt. A touch of northwestern hops brings some pine to the party. Malt brings some sweet, caramel notes to the party to the flavor party. The hops nicely balance the flavor. This is a fine brew."
"Deep mahoganey with a full and fluffy head and lacing down the glass. Aroma is lacking a little but there is a malty smell there. One of the more interesting tasting beers I've ever tried though. Malty and creamy up front but on the back side its hoppy and bitter. It's a malty beer with a bite and that is very interesting to me. I definitely enjoy the polarity of the two flavors together. Let it warm up and the complexities show through more intensly. Creamy mouthfeel and very drinkable at 7 percent no matter if your a hop guy or a malt guy. Good beer."
"Full Sail's Wassail overachieves - it is one of the better offerings I've had from them. Most of Full Sail's lineup is mediocre to dissapointing, though this one really is quite pleasing. It's reasonably well balanced and easy enough to drink. I wouldn't hunt this one down, but would happily enjoy one at a Christmas party."
"drinkability is nice. it's a bit of an odd beer. smells sweet, but is actually pretty dry. advertises ""pacific northwest hops", but has almost none of the typical citrus+pine duo. seems almost astringent. not quite sure what they were aiming for with this one, but it's not doing much for me."
"Picked a sixer of these up from the local liquor store for a mere $5.50. This is one of my favorite ""Winter Warmers"" I've tried yet. Wassail pours a nice dark bronze with an average amount of foam. The smell is pine and sour fruit. The taste is what really set this one apart for me: it starts out pretty hoppy and a little spicy (just the right amount of carbonation to give a pleasant mouthfeel, too) and then mellows out with a really nice malty sweetness. Even though this one is 7%, I don't pick up any alcohol burn. This is a really well balanced and well executed version of the Winter Warmer, and may compete with Great Divide's Hibernation for top of the class (in my opinion). I feel guilty for only paying $5.50 for this stuff!"
"Poured from 12oz bottle into dimpled mug. Clear, deep, dark, crimson ale with a small, creamy, khaki-colored head. Good retention. Grainy, spicy nose with a strong earthy character and a rumor of milk chocolate. The flavor is much the same; hearty malt and spicy hops. Balanced by alcohol and hop bitterness. Full-bodied with a velvety mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Pretty decent winter warmer."
"Chestnut brown in color with a creamy head that retains well and delievers splothces of lace to the glass. Spruce and pine are scented in the nose, with accents of walnuts and toffee. My initial reaction to this beer upon tasting is among lines of a winter warmer plus a kick of hops. In this case, it's a combo that works. Assorted spices like cinnamon and spruce are tasted, brown ale type flavors pull through from the malt, and trickles of pine make their presence known. Balanced overall, and it's a beer that you could drink a couple of despite the fact I didn't know it possessed a 7% ABV. Delicious, and one of the better offerings to come out of Full Sail."
"Well, a Full Sail with some power. This is a good example of a WW and something to look for on occasion. Somwe warming brings out some alc, but not much. a nice strong beer."
"Drinkability: This strikes me as an extra spicy amber with a distinct hoppy edge. This is hoppier than most and the alcohol is well hidden. Two at most, an above average beer."
"D: Despite its alcohol content, the beer is easy to drink and quite sessionable."
"The big problem was the the aromas and flavors are very bland. This really isn't an interesting beer, although it's well crafted."
"D: I thought this brew would be right up my alley -- a winter warmer without spice -- but unfortunately the hops-malt mix in the brew doesn't hit it for me at all."
"Overall - A pretty solid winter warmer. Not my favorite, but I'm glad to have tried it. Those looking for a winter warmer with less pine/coffee flavors should give this one a try."
"MF: Bodied, but not sweet. An easy-drinking winter beer"
"Pours a clear dark mahogany with a thin creamy tan head. Smells strongly of grapes and nutmeg. Taste is a sourdough rye bread start, with a toffee middle, and an earthy dry bitter finish. Very good malt to hop balance ratio here. Mouthfeel is super creamy, nice low carbonation. Excellent drinkability for the ABV, this is a smooth tasting Winter Warmer that I plan to get again."
"Wassail`s smell contains some coffee, roasted malt, nuts. Taste is rich and sweet, small flavor of hops, not too much random christmas spice, which is fine by me. MF is medium-full bodied, some alcohol and spice in the finish. Drinkability is just above average for a winter warmer."
"Dark, black-cherry read color with a very slim head. The aroma is of roasted, toasted malts...some spicy hop flavors are in the distance, but specialty malts are in the center of the smell. The taste is very balanced...lots of sweetness up front...again, plenty of roasted malt, and a very pronounced bitterness. Spicy, pepperiness is present in the flavor, along with a notable warming. An almost candy-like sweetness lingers, along with a pronounced bitterness. This is a reasonably enjoyable and drinkable beer, nice for winter, but not outstanding."
"Verdict: Great winter beer. Plenty of flavor and achieves a good balance of flavor and a very pleasing aroma. Filling for some and perhaps too strong for others, this beer sits well with me. I'd recommend this to anybody. A- (4.05)"
"Although I'm probably done with winter warmers this year, I was pleased enough with this one to roll it out next season as well."
"Overall, a nice beer."
"Who cares. 2010 was not noteable. Listening to the Bobby Fuller Four. Good night."
"Drinkability: This is a drinkable beer, but does appear to have a stronger alcohol content than it's 7.0. The beer is not heavy like many winter and late season beers, so is a very pleasant beer for enjoying. "
"Over all, this is a great winter warmer, a great choice for Christmas."
"Overall I enjoyed it, I would have it again if I can find it again."
"D-the abv isn't very obvious so you could easily have a few, not the most exciting winter warmer, but a decent pick"
"Dark nutty color with a good amount of off white head. Smells of roasted barley and nuts. The taste is fairly sweet with a nutty aftertase. Some hops are present but not completely obvious. The mouth feel is good... A little over carbonated. Overall a good holday brown ale."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit chewy. Overall this is a great tasting beer but I'm having trouble thinking of this as a Winter Warmer as it doesn't quite have the warming factor I look for."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Dark brown color with auburn red highlights. Slight lacing. Nice piney aroma. Taste started off with a lot of spice notes, like cinnamon and allspice and anise. Finishes with a subtle amount of hops on the palate. Mouthfeel was smooth and easy to drink. Drinkability was fairly good, as the abv was hidden behind all the spice. A definitely spice-forward version of a winter warmer, as I feel that a wassail should be."
"An odd brew."
"Overall - I thought it was quite good. A little 'less' than what I expect in a winter warmer, perhaps a little more heat to the alcohol. However, the taste is very complex and interesting. One of the more complete I've had. Great work from the folks at Full Sail"
"D- Not very much here. It was worth a try, and the price is capatible, but I just think as far as christmas beers go this one is WAY down there."
"One of my favorite winter warmers. Not a ton of spice in this one which adds to the drinkability. The hops balance out the syrupy sweetness without overtaking it. Highly recommended!"
"This is a very easy drinking beer. Well balanced with light spicyness. I guess I was looking for more spices in this beer and maybe a thicker mouthfeel. However, it's well balanced and the flavors really come out as the beer warms in the glass."
"This beer doesn't really ""wow"" me, but the spicing is subtle, and I appreciate that, as overspicing kills so many winter warmers. Not sure if I'd pick up another 6-pack of this, but for the price I paid I'm not complaining. Worth a shot."
"D: Good. All in all, this is a decent winter warmer. May be a tad bit too hoppy/bitter for the style (or, at least for what I was expecting tonight), but it's a good beer."
"D - Great beer which hides the 7.0% abv very nicely. This reminds me of a hyped up double version of an Anchor Steam Christmas Ale. Nice beer overall."
"rich and nutty malt flavoring, with a dried cherry and woody hop finish. caramel and brown sugar sweetness with some butterscotch. a touch of hoptea at the finish, once bubbles have escaped. touch of malt roasting. mouthfeel could have been a little more robust, but was still decent"
"DB- Sort of reminds me of Celebration Ale in a way but with a strange spice finish. It is kind of a strong pine/grapefruit combo and bites the palate. Kind of confusing but still flavorful and I enjoy it."
"I agree with a fellow reviewer that this one is best after waiting a bit after the pour. Let it warm a bit. A nice, budget session beer during the holidays."
"Medium bodied, pleasant seasonal beer."
"Pint glass pour and I am met with a nice amber colored ale with impressive lacing and a frothy beige head with staying power. The smell has some malty tones, figs and other dark fruits and some yeasty, bready whiffs. Taste is big time malty with a spicy bite. There is also some chocolate, nutmeg and orange in the mix. A little coffee too. A lot going on. The mouthfeel was too thin for such a flavored brew. Nice drinking winter warmer. Multiples are easily consumed on a cold day. A worthy try from the Full Sail crew."
"Drinkability - This is a beer I could have a few of in a session without any problems at all. A wonderful Winter Warmer. This beer tastes like Full Sail was chasing after Anchor's Christmas Ale but stopped halfway through. This is a great brew for the winter, the 7% abv is barely noticable and it's a solid brew to kick back on winter nights. I just wish it had slightly more kick."
"Not to mention that I could have more than one in a sitting. It's perfect for this time of the year and worth the buy, even if it's just a tad high in the alcohol department. I couldn't taste it at all and this would easily go well with some gingerbread or sugar cookies during this holiday season. A solid offering from Full Sail that did not last in my fridge for very long!"
"a great choice for the colder months. a nice hoppy, IPA like winter warmer. it looks like full sail has just began distributing to western new york and this is the first beer from them ive got the chance to enjoy and i liked it very much. i look forward to trying some more from full sail."
"this beer pours a nice dark brown color with red highlights and an off white head that recedes to lacing. The aroma brings to mind a nice malty stout, with a bit of citrus hops in the background. Lots of roasted malt flavor up front with nicely balanced by the dry, astringent, finish. not what I'd consider a traditional winter warmer, but I'm thankful for that. the medium body and good co2 make this a nice drinkable beer."
"Winter Ales tend to be dark (good) and full of nutmeg and crap I wouldn't otherwise want in my beer (bad). Full Sail avoids the trappings, giving a dark, hoppy, malty winter ale that stands up to sitting around the fire. The color is dark caramel, the malts are complex, the balance just right at 7%abv. What stands out is how easily drinkable and enjoyable this is. A perfect seasonal brew. I could not ask for more."
"D: Reminds of a beer from Appalachian Brewing Company in Gettysburg that I can no longer remember the name of. With that being said, this is a no nonsense quality beer with a malt medley and great hop balance. Give it a whirl."
"drinks okay. overall, it brings to mind an english brown ale with a bit more spicy hops. not bad, but not great."
"A nice winter warmer, more on the hoppy and spicy end. Flavors are a little muted for 7%, but defintiely drinkable."
"D: A solidly drinkable beer."
"Far more hop on the tongue than the smell indicates. Nice balance of darker and paler malts. A dry brew, the fine carbonation adds to the spritzy experience. Light cocoa in the background. The body is on the weak side for the style, but isn't that distracting."
"Wassail is a competent brew and drinks rather easily. I will certainly enjoy the rest of the six pack. However, I don't think that there is enough going on here to bring me back for more. Definitely worth the price of admission, but you'd probably be happier including this in a beer share..."
"D-Good solid winter ale, but not one that I would label a warmer, or certainly not a wassail. A nice switchup from most seasonal offerings but it would be a bit boring to drink another back to back."
"Time to go buy the rest of that 6-pack!"
"D - I'm usually not a fan of Winter Warmers, but this one has restored my faith in the style. Many thanks to a good friend that brought this back from Oregon for me to try."
"Drinkability: easy drinking winter beer that is great in front of a fireplace. A few of these could be consumed in a session."
"The beer pours a dark amber/red color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, roasted malt scent with a touch of caramel malt sweetness. The taste is decent. It has a mildly bitter, roasted malt flavor with a bit of caramel malt sweetness for balance. It goes down smooth with a very dry and slightly fruity finish. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a very drinkable winter warmer. It's not overly complex, but quite enjoyable."
"Brought back from OR from my friend Cdkrenz (on BA) I poured this into a pint glass and watched the aggressive head crawl up the glass (3 fingers) at which point the sticky lacing settled into a nice bubbly cap. The deep brown brew had a wonderful citrus hop nose. There were also hints of caramel and burnt malts. The taste was not typical for a WW but was delicious. There was a hint of fig and raisin to start with pine hops and some chocolate to follow and this was balanced at the finish with nice bitterness. I was skeptical as WW is not my favorite style but this brew is a nice selection and I was glad to have had the chance to sample. Thanks again Cdkrenz!"
"Notes: Overall this a rather tasty. Cheers."
"A different take of a winter warmer or should I say winter seasonal. A lot of hoppiness in this brew without additional spices."
"D - A seven percent alcohol beer that you don't notice it at all except after you've had a few and stand up. Definitely sneaks up on you. I will be picking up another six pack of this for sure."
"Drinkability - Very interesting brew, not terribly complex, but complex enough. Might be worth a six-pack just to figure it out."
"D - quite drinkable, could have another right now"
"Not very watery beer with a decent body but easily drinkable."
"Drinkability is so-so, not really any boozy flavors but a hint of warmth, also some sticky feel, light minerality."
"Winter warmers seem to be based on a wide variety of base beers...in this case, I'm reminded of a dark mild with greater potency both in terms of ABV and in hoppiness (with a distinctive NW character). A decent example of the style, but drink it now, as I don't think this would age as gracefully as Anchor's X-mas ale..."
"Chalkiness takes away from the mouthfeel and drinkability of this brew."
"Perhaps the hoppiest winter brew I've ever had, but I haven't tried any holiday beer from Stone yet. :) The malt backbone isn't quite enough to balance the IBUs, but there's enough to support them."
" ~ Not a bad beer by any means. I wouldn't say this is a classic winter warmer style but the beer is definitely good."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a creamy amount of carbonation."
"This beer is very clear, reddish brown with a nice, off white head that leaves nice lacing. The nose is not prominent but I pick up on some darker fruits, spices and muted hops. I was a bit disappointed with the taste, because, it was just average. The flavors were not forward and kind of hidden behind the alcohol heat. I did taste some toffee, caramel, cherries, and bread. The mouthfeel was decent and a bit sticky. The drinkability was good but this beer did not make an impression."
"The mouthfeel is filling with flavor which is constantly changing, morphing into something new. Overall this is a nice version of a winter warmer style beer. Really solid and enjoyable because of the spice/hop character to balance it out."
"Pours a slightly hazy cola like color with a very short off-white head that quickly settled into a light ring. The aroma is of a bready malt, caramel, some fruity sweetness and grassy hops. The taste is quite malty, bready, with a good amount of caramel sweetness. There is a tin like grassy hop that adds bitterness to offset the sweet malt. There is a general fruitiness to the brew as well. The flavor profile is not mind blowing but it is fairly balanced. The beer has a moderate to full body with prickly carbonation; has a slight slickness to it despite the carbonation. Finishes with a grassy metallic bitterness. A nice malty/hoppy brew. The hops don't taste very fresh but it balances out the malt. Not disappointed at all though not sure I would buy it again."
"Decent enough, although it tastes slightly more harsh the more you drink it. There's pleasant characters to it, but it's missing a coherent story, and there are notes which become far too prominent. Good. Not great."
"There is a lot of flavor here but the blend of flavors isn't optimal. The slight peat flavor seems to clash a bit with citrus. Not a lot just enought to give me a second pondering thought to wondering just what that flavor was. All in all, this reminds me more of a cascadian IPA than a winter warmer due to the very prominent hops."
"Moderate carbonation and an extremely creamy mouthfeel, though a bit on the light/thin side. Bready malts, toffee, nutmeg, and cocoa followed by assertive hop bitterness on the slightly smoky finish. Flavorful, well-balanced, and very easy-drinking (alcohol is almost completely masked)."
"Notes: It's such a pleasure to drink. One of my very favorite winter warmers because it's simple and very much akin to the wonderful pacific northwest. If you're a fan of the style or the brewery, I urge you to try this."
"Wassail-12 Fluid ounces Of Ridiculously Tasty Winter Ale Concocted By Our Massive Brewforce Of 47-2010. 7.00% ABV. 56 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Winter Ale--Roasted. Thin mild lace tan head.

"Great winter beer, Full Sail always has great prices too. Not my favorite winter warmer but an all around great beer."
"Within the balance there is drinkability, complex but approachable. Tasting this beer makes us realize that winter is not long enough and we'll just have to wait another year. Excellent job."
"Poured into a pint glass, it's got a nice dark chocolate aroma, very sweet topped off with nutty scents. It looks very inviting, dark brownish-reddish body , semi hazy and is topped off with a semi thick tan head that's very bubbly and sticks around for a bit; it has some strong lacing qualities. It has a medium to light mouth feel, clean and has mild carbonation. Faint hops are present some roasted oats and grains, its sweet overall and no alcohol flavors, not even I the aftertaste. I look forward to drinking this one again..."
"Could easily kill a sixer. This is a great brew. I'm sorry I waited so long to try it. I look forward to this winter..."
"good wine. Highly recommended - even if like me, you live somewhere with warm winters."
"D - Don't pass this one up if you get a chance."
"Picked this up in a sixer for like $4, liqour store was blowing out the winters, there loss, my gain. This is a very well balanced winter brew, unlike most winter beers that go over the top on direction or the other. Big hops, but rounded out with sweet malts on the finish to the end. Very good beer, and aged well as well. Good score on my part."
"D - Not too incredibly complex but a solid overall beer. The piney hop flavor at the end was interesting and unexpected. I wouldn't mind drinking this one again but I won't be searching it out."
"this was a dark brown with coffee colored soft, dense head. aroma of cocoa and piney hops. needs to warm quite a bit before the flavors begin open up - malty sweetness of chocolate and spice with the piney hops from the nose coming through also in the taste. mouthfeel was thick and chewy; this is a meal of a beer. great for a winter night, but the flavor wasn't quite all i hoped for."
"Overall, a beer I can return to every holiday season. I don't look forward to it like I do Sierra Nevada's Celebration, but the cheapskate in me can't turn down Full Sail's great prices for quality beer here in Portland. Not the most versatile for food pairing, but I like the complexity of this beer without Full Sail getting too crazy with spices or other weird things for a holiday beer. Let this one warm up a few degrees out of the fridge before drinking it."
"My favorite Full Sail beer thus far, aside from maybe the bourbon barrel imperial porter, but that's an entirely different animal."
"Quite dark brown, with red hints around the edges. Smell is malty, a bit of a spicy backbone too it. Taste is all malt at first, then comes the winter spices. They come on a bit spicy. Some clove, even orange peel, and a slight hint of cinnamon. Seems like the flavors aren't blended that well together. They are quite disparate, then comes a bitterness on the back. Drinkability suffers from too much going on. Wish it was a bit toned down."
"Drinkability- Easy drinking with good character."
"Malty, nutty, some bitterness at the tip of my tongue."
"More fruity than spicy for a Winter Warmer, rich and with moderate depth for support. A sipper for me given the malt structure."
"D: Very drinkable, could be in trouble at 7% ABV. :) A perfect beer to enjoy during those cold winter nights, job well done for the 47 peeps at Full Sail."
"D: I enjoyed this beer overall. Not the most characterful Winter Warmer, but a nice winter offering nonethless."
"- One of the better winter seasonals on the market, and being a Portlander all of my life... this is actually the first Wassail I have ever had... it just doesn't show up all the time, and I can swear there were many years where they just didn't brew it."
"Future outlook: Had not yet had anything from Full Sail that knocked my socks off, so I was a bit surprised at how much I liked this one. Worthy of a revisit."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. It is on par with jubelale, though it's flavors aren't as aggressive. I find it easier to drink several of these. Definitely put these guys on my radar, I will be trying some of their other stuff. Also at $6.99 a sixer this stuff is hard to beat."
"Purchased from Blue Max Liquors in Burnsville, MN. Pours a dark reddish brown body with a pillowy off-white head. Aroma is of sweet chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Flavors of burnt toast and chocolate with lots of spicy hoppiness. Smooth, sweet finish...a little too sweet, but still very good."
"Full Sail Wassail pours a big loose head over an almost opaque cola-colored brew. Carbonation is steady, the nose is grapefruit rind, vanilla, a little toasted malt. Up front the flavor is toasty malt with bare mocha and molasses notes with sharper herbal/grassy hop notes off the back. Mouthfeel starts soft but dries a bit, with a long leafy hop aftertaste. This is a winter warmer style beer, but I was hoping for a little more malt action here, it seems a tad light bodied to me."
"M/D: Not that much hotness detected or carbonation in this one, which makes for a creamy mouthfeel. A real nice sipper to enjoy on its own."
"decent overall, but there are many things lacking from categorizing this as a winter warmer."
"Poured into a pint glass. While pouring it appeared to have a dark brown color. After poured and held up to the light I noticed a nice red color as a little bit of light shined through. It left about a finger and a half of light tan head. It has a nice aroma of caramel and roasted malts. There are some hints of spice as well. Definitely smells like a winter warmer. Front of the sip has a nice roasted malt character followed by some slight hop notes and a hint of spices. Overall a very good beer. Could drink a few of these in a sitting. Very drinkable which surprised me. Definitely a great buy since I got it for $6.99 a six pack."
"Great burnt ruby color, huge caramel colored head that was creamy to say the least. Malty, hoppy and spicy in the nose, smells like a darker, more robust version of the style. Big time dose of malt backing with a nice fresh hop presence. Nutmeg and cinnamon, vanilla tangerines, dark red apple covered with caramel make this a very tasty beverage on a cold winter night. Mouthfeel was very creamy and bubbly at the same time, subdued bitterness in the finish from the hop bill. This winter warmer is chocked full of flavor, spice and everything nice."
"D: This has always been a big sticking point for me with winter warmers, but this one is the exception to the rule. There's no single disgusting flavor overwhelming everything else. It tastes ""seasonal"" without being self-consciously ""seasonal."" That said, I will probably drink another one of these when I'm done with the one in front of me right now."
"Drinkability: This was a surprise for me. Not really sure about style, as Winter Warmer is really just a catch all, but I like this quite a bit regardless."
"D-This is a very drinkable winter warmer since it has a lot of flavor but is not filling. 7.0% ABV is masked very well. A nice winter warmer."
"Pours a very dark brown with just a slight head that sticks around as a thin swirl. Smells malty but dry, with some nice spice notes. The taste is reminiscent of gingerbread cookies, with a warm, spicy breadiness, but also with a nice herbal bitterness that lingers. Smooth and medium bodied in the mouth, I've always found this to be a quite drinkable winter warmer, and always a good value for the money."
"D - very approachable and session worthy winter warmer. never too big but enough girth to fight off the cold."
"glassware: pint"
"Overall this is one of the better winter warmers I remember having and I attribute this to the strength of the malt flavors and using a modest amount of spices. Definitely worth a shot."
"glad to have my wassail back. been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this release all year. loved it last year and im looking forward to enjoying it this winter."
"As far as drinkability, it is good for a winter warmer--it is not a session beer for sure! Great beer to have for the holiday season!"
"Pours a murky deep copper color with a finger of tan colored head that never fully dissolves and remains a heavy layer atop the glass through-out the session. The aroma is toasted malts, spices and some earthy hops. The flavor has similar notes with toasty malts and nuts, slight brown sugar and some other spices. Wassail has a creamy medium body. The hops are more present in the aroma than in the taste which actually makes sense, since this was a dry-hopped version of the Wassail. The flavor is nice but could use some more noticeable hoppiness."
"Taste is about average, but pretty smooth! Great drinkability for that particular style."
"Good Winter Warmer. This is a difficult style to pull off. Full Sail's entry manages to provide an interesting flavor profile without overindulging in any particular Winter Warmer cliche. The beer pours dark brown with a healthy beige cap. Bubbles lace the glass as the liquid level falls. The aroma is Scottish Ale caramel sweet. There are some interesting fruit notes, apricots, peaches, etc. The flavor brings in a strong and very much appreciated bitter flavor. It's not a huge beer or a dramatic beer, but it fulfills the aim of a Winter Warmer without looking to old standby of cloves and other pumpkin pie spices. Re-rated 12/10/09: Not quite as good as I remember."
"Poured a copper tinted red body with a one finger tan head that died slowly. Hops are prevelant in this beer's aroma, some citric hops, but it is really about the roasted and sweet malts. Same with the taste as it is a medium-to-full-bodied beer that goes down smootha and creamy. Tasted roasted malts, caramel, some chocolate well-balanced with dark fruits and citric hops that are noticeable in the backend b/c of a dry finish. Overall, even with the dry finish this is a sweeter than normal beer with a large amount of that sweetness a chocolate taste. This is a good beer and I look forward to having it on a cold winter night (not an old bottle in the spring)."
"Very drinkable and very tasty:)"
"D- I love hops, so the hoppiness is a plus for me; I'll have this one again."
"Drink ability is above average. Akward combination of flavors with the spice and some fruit but it tastes good."
"D - I was pleasantly surprised with this beer I don't know why I set the bar low for this one but I wasn't expecting such a good tasting hoppy beer worth trying"
"D - This is a damn good winter warmer. You never know what you are going to get with this grab bag catch all style, but this one manages to embrace the wintry spirit while still managing to be a good solid drinkable, and hoppy beer. Well done Full Sail, well done!"
"Good mouthfeel and a very drinkable beer. This doesn't take cold weather to be good."
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is carbonated and slightly creamy. The body of the beer is medium full. The finish is bitter and refreshing. There is a nice balance in the beer and is a very tasty winter warmer. The beer has a nice edge and the hops is not over whelming. I enjoyed this beer."
"Pours a dark brown-reddish colored body, but it's not cloudy. Has a big creamy off-white head, decent lacing, lasting. Has a nutty fresh smelling aroma, but it's a little sour. A woody, dusty nut taste. Sour acidic aftertaste. Some light spices."
"Overall, not a good beer for me. Wrong style and taste issues. One and done for me."
"Hmm, interesting flavor...a bit more mellow that I was expecting. Fruits really fade more into the background and the toasty malts are nicely balanced with grassy and floral hop flavors. Carbonation level is nearly perfect and the alcohol is noticeable, but not distracting. Has interesting spice hints reminiscent of spruce tips, cinnamon sticks and coriander. Quite Christmasy. Only problem I have with this beer is there is something in the aftertaste that doesn't quite set well with me, a bit of a tang that I don't like. For the most part though, it's an enjoyable beer."
"Smell is muted. There are some nutty hints and that's about it. Taste comes through much stronger. Nutty pine flavoring. Subtle caramel malt sweetness. Very warming and perfect for a cold evening."
"Very drinkable."
"D - a pleasant way to warm up."
"Pours a dark brown with a slight beige head. Quite an aroma of spice. I'll just list the smells that I found with this one. Nutmeg, fig, tartness, roasted grains, all spice. The taste is warming with a roasted, nutty, caramel, sourness. Not as heavy as it looks or other holiday/winter brews. Also fairly drinkable for a holiday beer. I am impressed with the Full Sail Wassail this year."
"Pours to a nice wintery reddish-brown with medum tan head that lingers awhile and leaves okay lacing. Aroma is muted, but what is there is a pleasant blend of dark fruit and Christmas spice, not real defined. Alcohol never does make itself known, yet this is not a bad Winter beer, though I have had better."
"Pours a clear dark mahogany with purplish red hues. 1 finger of tight tan head fades quickly. Some good lacing. Smells of roasted malt, brown sugar, raisins, and pine. Tastes of brown sugar, citrus fruits, roasted malt, berries, chocolate, raisins, and spices with a touch of coffee and a pine tree sap finish with a slightly salty aftertaste. Medium in body with moderately active carbonation. Roasty with a bittering hop presence. Took me a couple of sips to start grasping this beer, but in the end it was a unique winter warmer and drinkable."
"Drinkability is good for the style and I wouldn't think twice about having another."
"D-A nice beer over which to watch the snow fall. This one makes me feel in the winter and holiday mood. Good, but not great."
"The taste is much like the smell. There is some definite, but I could not determine spice to this beer, and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Very dark tasting beer which is reflected in the 7% ABV."
"Poured into a straight pint glass. A very attractive Mahogany leaning towards black color. Poured a thick, but quickly dissapating head. Aroma not as bold as it could be. Taste is more fulfilling than aroma would indicate. Good, satisfying body. Very drinkable, could easily have a session with this beer. Worthy of your time."
"Pours dark brown with a good sized off white head. The lacing is very good and the head lasts a long time. Smell is of roasted malts and chocolate. Tastes of roasted malt, with a nice warmer hop finish. Mouthfeel is a little dry for this style. It's not a bad thing. Over all, this is a top 5'er winter brew for me."
"An interesting, very American style twist on a winter warmer... I really feel like they just need to relax the reigns just a little bit. Definitely let this one warm up if you want it to have a shot at impressing you... I just can't help but feel like this is just a half step or two away from being phenomenal. Maybe next year?"
"The beer did not really taste as I expected it to from the smell. It has a sweet smell, but the taste is not really sweet at all. Way too dry for a Winter Warmer. Not a terrible beer, but there are easily better seasonal's."
"2 maybe i drank it too cold. maybe my palate was off. maybe this 6-pack was mistreated. so far not my cup of coffee, er beer. next time i'll try sipping very slowly and letting it warm up more."
"Drinkability: A middle-of-the-road winter release for me that, while not bad, certainly didn't do anything for me. Especially with so many other fine wintertime brews rolling around."
"Overall an intresting take on the style, not your typical warmer but very good none the less. I would love to have a couple more of these to enjoy, really very good."
"Tastes vary, of course, and it's possible that the ale I drank was a ""bad batch"" or had been stored incorrectly, but the ""wassail"" was not for me!"
"Drinkability is good for a shorter session."
"Pours clear mahogany with a short, off-white head. Good balalnce of hops and malts in the nose and taste. Has a smooth, caramel and earthy flavor up front. Spice, hops, and tea come through in the middle. Dry, nutty, and earthy finish. Enjoyable, but it left me wanting more."
"There is a medium level of carbonation to the beer which truly allows you to sip the beer and not have the carbonation do all the work for you. The mouthfeel of the Wassail is one that is smooth but also quite robust in the sense that there is not a loose or lacking nature to the beer. The beer is a rather strong offering and as such it should hold a bit more weight in the mouthfeel than a lighter beer and the Wassail does just that."
"D: No problem finishing one of these. I found myself looking forward to the next sip. All around a great beer."
"This is a fine beer, in my opinion. A fruity, slightly spicy, dry winter brew. It's not over the top in any one department, which is a good thing. Too many winter warmers are overly spicy or not very well balanced, but this beer achieves an even balance without any problems. The folks at Full Sail have delivered another fine beer. Well done."
"D: clean and easy to drink, good feel and look. This one is a winner in my book"
"12 oz. bottle poured dark ruby brown with a smallish head and good lacing. Roasted malts and coffee are featured in the smell, which lacked the spruce and spiciness you might expect in a winter seasonal. Roasted coffee beans are the strongest flavors, which include rich maltiness and some chocolate. A hint of hops bitterness is evident to keep things balanced. Medium mouthfeel, full carbonation, and a crisp clean hops aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat robust."
"Hazy dark amber with orange highlights. Two finger tan head that recedes slowly leaving some nice lacing. Aroma is spicy with some caramel and biscuit malts backed up by an average sprucy hoppiness. Flavor is spicy, nice bitterness, hinhts of pine and orange, lots of caramel malts, hints of chocolate, some boozy qualities. Slightly sweet and bone dry on the finish. Creamy mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. Slight warming on the swallow. A very nice winter warmer, but I've had a few other that i liked better this year."
"D. Too sweet and rich for session, but an OK beer. Not worthy of seeking out and just barely above average."
"Not what I expected for a Winter Warmer."
"Served at around 50º into a Boon tumbler. Ample layer of creamy foam, surface has a slight luster to it. Woody brown color, that becomes ruby in direct light. Slow upward bubble streams, easily visible with it's gemstone clarity. Light whiff of alcohol, but otherwise malty in the nose. Light floral hop note shows up at room temperature. Fairly full body, malty with moderate bittering hops lending an earthy character. Some esters from the alcohol, nicely warming. Overall it was easy to drink, clean cut and not spicy, a fairly nice Winter Warmer."
"mouth and drink are both good for the style the high abv is barely noticeable"
"Jk"
"Good Gawd I love this beer. An all-time fave to be sure. Pours an absolutely beautiful dark amber with about a half-inch head that lingers throughout the drink. Smell is hearty malt (dark fruits and grains) balanced by unmistakeable hops - this is a winter warmer with a northwestern flair. That impression is more than born out by the taste: a seemless wedding of strong malts and assertive hops that pushes the flavor envelope impressively far. Flavors of festive pine, berries and dried fruit are the highlights. Mouthfeel is smooth and viscous, allowing the wonderful flavors to coat your tongue. The only deterrent to this beer's drinkability is its 7.0% ABV, which although not extremely high, certainly places this brew outside what would normally be considered session status. But I just want to drink bottle after bottle, even though it brings on the buzz faster than I'd like. Buzzed or not, I will drink more. It's too good to resist..."
"Aroma is strong and malty with a rich hoppy undertone. It pours a rich, semi-opaque mahogany with a thick, frothy beige head - very appetizing. Flavor is mouth-filling, malty with strong spice hints, plenty of hoppy bitterness, and just a touch of sweetness. Texture is lively and jazzy, and finish is lip-smacking."
"Appearance has a dark ruby brown with a thin head leaving a nice lace. Smell of dark roasted malts, molassas and coffee. Taste has that roasted malt, coffee, spice with a good amount of hops leaving a bitter roastiness. Mouthfeel seems medium with good carbonation to help the bitterness go down. I'd say it's a good hop head winter ale thats not over the top with the ABV hidden well."
"Not a bad seasonal, and worth a try if you come across it. I felt it lacked something, perhaps a bit more liveliness in the mouthfeel to make it a really enjoyable beer."
"Best winter type beer I've this year and highly reccomended for cold nights."
"D- Easy to drink, the ABV is well hidden. The bitterness does slow me down a bit."
"d. I can easily drink a few (or more) at a time. It's a thick and full brew, with a 7% abv, which may not be sessionable for some, but as a winter warmer, it hits the spot beautifully. This is one that's complex enough to sip through, but also smooth and clean enough to polish more than a few off in a night - and the price makes that doable without regret. This year seems to be a strong one for Wassail, with a bit more character and oomph than some of the past years. Truly beautiful, and a must try if you can get it."
"The taste is fermented plums, stewed prunes, hints of black pepper, chocolate and dark bread, with a slightly hot-spicey and zesty quality. It's sweet with a light spicey bitterness dominating the finish and it very full-bodied, a bit on the heavy side that perhaps adds to the character yet brings down drinkability."
"This has a dark hazy brown color with a lightly brown-tan head. Smells of toffee, slightly soured barley malt (maybe sour apple too). Tastes great with an initial hit of sweet caramel, shortly followed by smooth bready chocolate malt, then I find a little smokiness to it and finishes with a little oiliness similar to butter. Sticky lace as it goes down. Fairly straightforward malty brew... a little out of season, so the hop spice may have degraded if there was any prominent hop presence."
"Overall- This was a great beer which would be awesome during the Christmas season. Not one of my favorite winter warmers but still a wonderful winter beer."
"Easy drinking for such a heavy beer."
"D : It's good but not in bunches. If the malts were toned down some, it would make it better"
"mouthfeel is full a pretty heavy beer. it is also very well balanced. 7% abv and really warms you up good."
"By the way...this particular bottle has an ""enjoy by"" date of 031008 which would put it past due. This sucker isn't just fine, but one worth suggesting. Mmm Good!"
"I am not a big fan of Full Sail I guess. This is not the first time I have detected the veggie character in one of there beers. I am suprised I am the only one compenting on this asspect. Oh well, Full Sail beer's are just not for me."
"Wassail is citrousy, hoppy but not as bold as I expected from Full Sail as a winter warmer but it was good. great golden, copper color and i had this ice cold( i know, i know defeats the purpose) but it was tasty either way. I had it on tap years ago and recall it tasting much better of course, tasting notes canyt be recalled from that one."
"Glad I had the opportunity to sip on this (though it's quite easy to more than sip) on a chilly late March day (while no longer winter, it still ""hit the spot""). A very nice winter ale that is not overly spiced. Well-balanced with a good hop presence, and warming, without being too hot. Would get this as a winter regular if it were avalailable in my area. Thanks again, John!"
"This beer pours a solid brown color. The head is one inch in height, and a rocky tan head. The aroma is of brunt caramel, with chocolate, and a hint of grapefruit. The taste is like the aroma, but with a little more chocolate. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a nice low level of carbonation. Overall, this is a nice winter beer that I can see myself drinking in the future."
"Deep clear maroon pour with a beige head. Slightly skunky malt smell to it, with a taste of some dark toasty tart malt. Unusual flavor for sure. Not particularly good, but also not bad. Drinkable, and gets a bit better as it warms to me. Light char and burnt notes, and despite my low rating, this is worth a try for its uniqueness."
"Drinkablity: A very easy drinking winter brew from Full Sail."
"Drinkability- A bit sweet for a few in a row but for a sweet treat now and then, it's a hit."
"This beer has a decent mouthfeel and the spices leave a good finish on the palate. The balance of this brew make it a good winter warmer."
"Overall, this is a decent beer, but is not one of my favorites from Full Sail, which is a bit disappointing. It's worth a try, especially for the malt fans out there."
"Very tasty beer. When a touch too cold I don't particularly enjoy the alcohol, but adequately warmed it is a full-flavored beverage full of fruit, caramel without too much residual sweetness or any cloying finish, and ample hops. The same alcohol that is distracting when cold adds to the full warming nature when warmer. Delicious, and the body is excellent. It seems medium full without ever being filling, excellent soft carbonation and pleasant bitterness in the finish. With a name like Wassail I expected spices, but if they are there they are light and I can't pinpoint anything in particular. I'd love to have a couple more of these, so I shall stop typing and go get one..."
"Poured into a pint glass from a bottle. The beer pours a dark copper, forming a very thin head that dissipated quickly. Thin spots of lace stick to the glass. The aroma is dominated by the malt, but also contains a hint of fruit aroma and hops. I expected the aroma to be a little more full and diverse. The taste was also slightly lacking in a complex flavor. The taste is very malty, creating a nutty/caramel flavor, but that is not well balanced out with the hops that complete the taste, ending in a very sharp bitter taste. The mouthfeel was very thick, but due to the hops, finished not as smooth as expected. For a winter warmer, the beer is drinkable, but not something to have all night. Overall, I am guessing that I just got a bad batch of this beer. Its not like I remember it tasting last year. However, based on what I found this beer to be this year, I would recommend another winter warmer to get you through the winter."
"Pours with a 2-finger head that dissipates quickly, leaving a very thin ring of foam. Dark-brown opaque color. Smells of dried fruit, especially prunes. Tastes of dark chocolate with dried fruits, prunes and raisins with a lingering hops bitterness. This is a spicy winter brew that would be great eating some fruitcake and reading a novel by the fireplace on a wintry evening."
"Poured a nice looking dark brown/mahogany with a copper hue shinning through the rim, a long lasting tight one finger beige head accompanied leaving an excellent lace. The aroma was faint in comparison to its flavor. A subtle scent of caramel, herbs, cinnamon and brown sugar comes through. Medium to full body with dominate sweet malt upfront, oily and slighty bitter followed with a hint of spice (had trouble making out the spice)and softly carbonated. This was an enjoyable winter warmer, very drinkable and great with Pad Thai and Panang curry. Enjoy"
"The taste is quite a bit better, but it takes some attention to like. Its a play of subtleties, and you won't get anything obvious besides a good malting and some fine spices. Dive deeper and you recognize the herbal, spicy hops, the slight warmth. It really should be warmed quite a bit, probably 50 plus degrees, because at that point, you get a winter warmer that feels like a good beer to drink for a long night of reading or half snoozing by the fireplace. If only I had a fireplace...."
"D- too rich to session, solid winter warmer, recommended"
"Full Sail Wassail pours an opaque dark brown bordering on black with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a thick mouthfeel. The flavor has a nice amount of floral hops that comes through, but there is a strong malt presence as well. Enjoyable."
"Drinkability - when Burl Ives sings, ""I don't know if there'll be snow, but have a cup of cheer", he means something like this. Tasty, crisp, a nice blend of seasonal spices and classic flavors. A delicious Christmas beer."
"D  This is a very good beer. It was the first that Ive had from Full Sail and I am quite impressed."
"i have had several of these without tiring of it, but not interesting enough to keep going through a six pack over an evening. Good offering for the season."
"It's a pretty tasty WW, but a bit weak in many parts and a tinge medicinal in the flavor. Great smooth sipper, though. I would probably try another bottle of this sometime down the line."
"I'm not going to lie, as for drinkability.. I'm not as into this as Anchor's or even Sierra Nevada's, Christmas offerings this year, but it is still very drinkable to this lass."
"I was very surprised at the drinkability of this beer, I was afraid the spiciness would be overwhelming but this goes down smooth as the aforementioned silk. As the label says ""ridiculously tasty"" and at 7.0% ABV these could sneak up on you quick. I would love to relax in front of the fire after a good meal and melt into a few of these! I look forward to more winter warmer offerings but will seek Wassail out every year now. I also think I will have to revisit the other beers of this brewery soon."
"An OK beer but not the best of the Winter Warmer beer class. On the bitter end of the spectrum this probably will improve with a bit of aging. If you want a bitter beer with winter warmer features added then this is the beer for you."
"This is a pretty good beer, especially considering the style (which is not normally one of my favorites). Nice effort from Full Sail."
"Get this beer if you can."
"Pours mahogany with some crimson hues when a bit of light hits. Has a one-finger dense tan head with fair retention and consistent lacing with the slight bit that's left. Smells spicy like red-hots candy with some pine in the background. Tastes malty up front, spicy in the back and some fruits all around. The hops start to surface furtively after a few drinks as they are mixed in quite well. Overall, the drinkability is superb. Mouth-feel is somewhat fluffy and open. You can hear all the instruments distinctly as they combine for a good by-the-fire drifting winter folk song. Gonna kick back a few of these."
"In the mouth it was a tad chewy and left a tingling on the back of the throat. Overall a very good winter warmer and I would buy a six pack to enjoy."
"D - This 6pack was enough of an experience, at least for this season. It's not an every day beer and it's not a beer that you want to have several of in an evening. Not bad tho if you're in the mood for it."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" thick tan head above the clear brown brew. Head lasts well, with layers of thick coating lace. Aroma is worty and fruity. Taste also is reminiscent of wort, with spicing and balancing bitterness near the end. Mouthfeel is reasonably smooth, and drinkability is okay. Have to admit the name had me thinking cider, not winter warmer, but I adjusted."
"I buy at least a few of these every winter, and am never disappointed. Solid beer from a brewery that I typically don't appreciate any of their 12 oz brews."
"Again with the deeply caramelized malts, a hit of molasses sweetness and vieled mineral edge. Herbal, green hoppiness is present but restrained at first. Becomes more aromatic and delicate as it warms, softening the mineral-bite and bringing subtle layers of earthiness (like some late-fall leaf mold) to the fore. More resinous and piney (minty?) hops are also revealed. Creamy, but fairly light-bodied for a 7% winter warmer. Finishes clean and crisp on the palate. A solid and drinkable example of the style  kicks the butt of other more Celebrated examples."
"D- this beer is definitely drinkable, but it isn't outstanding. Honestly, I expected more from Full Sail's winter brew. Better than most, but could be better."
"D & Notes: This is one assertive brew! It has the unique characteristic of being both very assertive in hops as well as a big malt flavor as well. That said, it's not overdone, and is simply an awesome all around beer. Too damn drinkable for words, even considering its high ABV. This is essentially a dark IPA, and the very complex flavors of this brew are a sheer joy to let dance on your tongue. One of my top seasonal winter beers."
"Drinkability- For the most part (other than Vesuvius) Im a Full Sail fan. The nose is a huge disappointment but the taste isnt bad. It becomes a little much after a while though because it is fairly cloying. A bit more hop (or full fermentation) may reduce this (what do I know?) and make it a bit more enjoyable."
"A decent beer, not earth shattering, but solid. While I don't regret finally trying it, I don't feel I've missed anything by not hitting it before. This would be a decent winter ale for people not used to them. Someone looking for a rich spiciness or a more robust hop flavor would probably want to look elsewhere."
"D: A very good Winter Warmer, tastes match the season perfectly, need to go buy more of this while it is still available. A very good beer by Full Sail."
"D: This is a fine winter warmer. It nailed the warmer element and presents a well crafted balance between sweets and spices that are reminicent of Wassail without loosing the essential ""beerness"" of the brew."
"Overall a good winter brew. Not my favorite this year, but not bad at all! Cheers!!"
"Dark brownish-red with a creamy looking tan head that is very short but again, looks creamy. The smell is very malty and a slight whiff of raisins or prunes. Taste is the same with an odd alcoholic aftertaste. This is actually my least favorite Full Sail beer. I wish they put Wreck The Halls into sixers instead of this stuff. I cant say this isnt a good beer, its just one I dont happen to care much for."
"Poured from bottle into standard pint glass. Pours a near black color but when held to the light its dark ruby in appearance. Although when poured the head was not thick, the retention was great, a thin layer sticks around throughout the beer. Tan head with very a very creamy appearance to it. Smell is unique, I expected a chocolate and caramel smell to it however hops are definitely present. A nice balance of both gives this beer a terriffic aroma. Hops hit my tounge up front which leads to a toasted grain on the backside. A nice chocolate aftertaste was a pleasant suprise. Light on the carbonation feels just right and the creamy mouthfeel is on par. Overall a great beer IMO. Best offering I've had from Full Sail yet."
"An average beer, would not be my choice for winter warmer"
"Elegant frothy head. Modest nutty aroma with a dusting of cocoa. Full Sail doesnt go far in being daring here, unless you consider daring to be a low-alcohol winter warmer that shies from the traditional panoply of tropic spices. The brew is deep glowing red with lots of polish, deserving lace, and ample body. The flavor has a toys-in-the-attic mustiness with old-world malt character. Hops are held in check. The gentle smoky finish nearly hints at peat. A good drinker thats worth waiting for. Available Oct.-Dec."
"drinkability: good"
"I would go for a few of these in the winter, hope this comes with a decent price  around $9 a sixer?"
"D- Easy and only 6.5% so it seems to low in my taste for a winter warmer just doesn't do its job."
"D: Not all that tasty to me, goes down ok, good kick, decent representation of style with a few quirks to make it different, to be honest its a decent beer, but there are a lot of others that I would choose first even within the style."
"This is one of those ales that snuck up on me. I liked what I tasted in the first few ounces and I love what I'm tasting in the last few. This is yet another outstanding winter warmer from the Pacific Northwest that favors hops at least as much, if not more, than it favors malt. Wassail is one of Full Sail's best beers and would be an automatic purchase every winter if I was lucky enough to live in their distribution area."
"Purchased 12oz bottle @ O-Bar & Grill, Eugene, OR. Pours a dark mahogany color similar to cola. Very small head dissipates quickly. Pleasant hop taste and odor. Tastes of toasted malt. Leaves mouth feeling a bit dry. Hoppyness becomes more apparent as it warms. A bit heavy for a lunch beer, But would be great on a cool winter night or as a nightcap."
"I poured this beer into a large thistle with a dark brown sugar color, while a decent lingering tan head settled on top. Smelled of lightly roasted malt as caramel and hops intertwine and trail off. Tastes have touches of apple cider spices and subtle dark malt, with a full hoppy finish. Medium mouth feel, not a heavy beer, but not really a session beer either...Paired great with a lemon/sage roasted chicken....Enjoy"
"A translucent, dark purplish chocolate color, with a thick, creamy tan head that quickly dissipated and left a slight, sticky lace. A fairly sweet, piney aroma dominates, joining roasted malt and alcohol. The taste is malty, with burnt toast and sweet spruce, finishing with a strong bitter taste and warmth of alcohol. The body leans towards thin and boozy, with very little carbonation. Overall I found the aftertaste a bit too acrid to make the Wassail that drinkable, even more so if you serve it strait from the fridge."
"Pours a clean clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, nice sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is mostly slightly sweet malts, some hops, and lots of caramel. The taste is sligthly sweet/malty, with a very nice touch of caramel. The finish is dry and slightly bitter. Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice winter warmer."
"D - As a stand-alone drink, without food, this is a good one."
"Thicker medium body. A touch of dryness in the aftertaste with some warming from the alcohol. I am really starting to ""warm"" up to these winter warmers."
"Creamy tan head was small, dissipated quickly. Color was a dark, clear, toasted burgundy. Aroma was light, subtly sweet. Carbonation was mild. Flavor is surprisingly light, malts are dry not overly sweet. Dry aftertaste lingers warmly. Wouldn't mind having another right now."
"very drinkable. perfect for this winter season. i'll be getting more of this for sure."
"one of the best holiday seasonals i've had the pleasure to try and definitely one of this breweries best offerings."
"Wow, this is a real treat. It pours to a thick bubbly off-white head with lacing. Deep brown color and good clarity. Aroma is of fresh, spicy hops. There is also a very rich maltiness in the aroma that smells delicious. Flavor is very big and a pleasure to savor. It starts with a blast of slightly roasty malt and spicy hops and then the hops take over the palate in a very good way. The malt sweetness is perfectly balanced by the hops. Finishes with a spicy hoppiness and a very nice lingering caramel and roast malt goodness. A very fine beer I wish was available year-round."
"Full-bodied dark brown winter warmer in the tradition of Anchor OSA. Grainy and spicy, with a bitter bite from the hops, and perhaps a bit from the alcohol. It's no boozy beast, but the alcohol is a notable flavor componant, staking it's claim as ""heavier than average"" at 6.5% abv. The malt body is familiar but hard to describe, except as micro or homebrew-esqe. There are faint and subtle Christmas spices barely present, like clove, cinnomon, nutmeg, and gingerbread. Would pair well with pumpkin pie. Spicy carbonation. Everything about it is above average. Nice long, bitter fallout. Cheers!"
"Thanks, boolshot, for the opportunity"
"Pours thick brown with a moderate amount of head. Smells of a little malt, a lot of hops (something piney in there), a trace of spice (maybe allspice and a dash of cinnamon?). I swear it's almost as hoppy as an IPA. The finish is a little longer and smoother, but with some alcoholic bite. It's not bad to drink, though I think a winter warmer should be maltier and not as hoppy - I couldn't drink more than a couple."
"Could easily imagine sitting in front of a fire with a six-pack of this stuff. Very drinkable."
"Medium mouthfeel,chewy and cloying. Enjoyable brew,very tasty making for a good drinkability. Complex aromas and taste a very good winter beer."
"Poured a chesnut brown with a well formed 1 1/2 finger beige colored head that left nice rings of lace as it slowly.Big chocolate aromas along with some nice drying earthiness quite roasted in character,quite dry I have to say on the palate wich in my opinion is a nice change of pace for winter warmer brews.Unsweetened chocolate and earthy tones really show themselves on the palate as well as a roasted chesnut flavor, a bit of spiciness comes thru late giving it a sharper finish,not overly complex but quite flavorful.Iam glad I tried this it is a solid no frill winter warmer, quite dry and tasty."
"This is a nice winter brew from this small brewery. Pours a deep mohagany with a two fingers of head. Some hops and roasted coffee/chocolate come through on the palate. Definitely a bit of alchohol noticable on the finish. Perhaps a little fruit at the end as well. A good winter warmer."
"Drinks okay/good, but seems a bit hotter alcohol-wise this year, what gives? I liked this better last year, but a good winter warmer"
"This beer is drinkable but, but only for one or two at a time. The flavor is sharp, and overpowering. It's like a dark roasted IPA."
"Wassail is a deep red-brown color with an off-white head that fades to a thin cap, some lacing. The aroma is malty with a note of nutmeg. Malt dominates the taste with expected winter warmer spiciness and some hoppiness toward the end of the taste. Mouthfeel is just right for the style, not light, not as full as a porter. Drinkability is good. This is a solid beer that recalls an historical style. Try this one."
"This is a tasty drinkable session worthy winter beer, but I tend to like my winter warmers to be a bit more bold."
"Simple but good aroma patterns. Barrage of bold and daring flavors. Surprisingly strong alcohol. This is a great winter warmer: the roasted and hopped-up malt and alcohol delivered in a beautiful thick bubbly substance."
"Malty-sweet on the front, with a nice hoppy finish. A great seasonal offering!"
"Mouth: An excellent combination of warm roast flavors and bitter grapefruit hops. Very bitter finish with some burnt toast and coffee notes. Up front some caramel but not sweet, differing from the smell. Delicious."
"Very complex winter warmer. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Plenty of robust flavors to find in every sip."
"Having gone recently to trying Full Sail beers I'm impressed with much of their lineup (at least what's available in MN). Solid beers of high quality, great flavors and good recipes. Well done."
"A thoroughly enjoyable fall/winter beer with a prominent hop profile. Another fine brew from the folks at Full Sail."
"Overall, a decent Christmas beer. It's kind of reminiscent of the Hibernation, but not quite as good."
"D- could go for a couple"
"Ruby. Subtle, fruity, malt driven aroma with a touch of caramel, pit fruit, chocolate and hop leafs in the nose. Chewy, malt accented flavor. Notes of caramel, pit fruit, grape skins and chocolate along with a lingering hop bitterness. An enjoyable brew."
"Mouthfeel is to be as expected, nice fullness, not watery. This is a very drinkable winter warmer, one to return back to every year,"
"Pours out a ruby brown with a thin, frothy tan head that leaves quite quickly. Smells of chocolate, roasty, earthy malt, and resinous hops. Alcohol is present in the nose, but it has a way of tying the other smells together. This beer marries a sweet chocolatey maltiness with a sturdy hop kick. I think of this as a beer that's somewhere in between a winter warmer and a brown ale. The big gripe here: too thin. Way too watery here, and the flavors drop out as soon as you start getting into them. Mouthfeel is creamy and not at all heavy. Yeah, this one's pretty drinkable."
"Good mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable. Calling this a winter warmer seems a misnomer. Tastes more like an American Strong Ale, though at 6.5%, it wouldn't fit that category either."
"Beer pours a mahogeny color with an off white head. The head is sustaining well and leaving a decent lacing behind. Nose is malty and of dark fruits. Taste is of a hint of chocolate malts, dark fruits, and is balanced nicely by a nice dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and is creamy smooth. Drinkability is good as the abv is a bit warming but not over the top. I will seek this brew out in future holiday seasons!"
"In my esteemed opinion, Wassail is quite good, especially for a Winter Seasonal."
"Overall Impression: Not bad. Much hoppier than I expected and that cut down the drinkability for me personally. The tea flavor was a bit much as well. Just didnt blow my sail, but you should give it a shot, at least once."
"12oz bottle of the 2005 edition. Pours a pretty dark brown with garnet highlights when held up to the light. A half-inch creamy tan head leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is very heavy on the roasted malt, with some subtle holiday spices in the background - nutmeg, clove, and a bit of mocha. Palate is again full of roasted malt, balanced by some slightly bitter floral hops. Spiciness doesn't really come through, although a bit of smokiness is evident. Medium body is a bit creamy, carrying the flavor well. A decent winter warmer."
"I wouldnt hunt it down to try it again."
"And hoping thou will bear."
"Late 2005, on tap at local restaurant. Pours deep mahogany color with nice creamy white head. Aroma is sweet malt and nice American hops. Resin, citrus, pine. The aroma was probably my favorite part of the beer. The first taste is all hops, tasted as expected from aroma. Then it turned sweet. I was able to taste the bready malt and a slight chocolate flavor which was nice. Then the hops snap back into action, cleaning my mouth. It has nice body, full but not heavy. It was a little to sweet for my taste. Fine beer, but not my favorite from these guys."
"Notes: Not the best offering I've had from this brewery, but a solid beer nonetheless. Cheers and thanks to pineywoodsrooter for this brew!"
"D - Enjoyable. Seemed similar to a hopped up Youngs Winter Warmer. I am going to re-visit this soon and see how it changes."
"Nicely complex, and well balanced. An excellent winter warmer. Thanks to waldowin for this enjoyable PacNorthwest winter gem."
"This guy really feels good in your mouth. And yes, the alcohol content helps warm you a bit on a wet and cold evening. Another nice one from the fine folks at Full Sail."
"Not as good as I recall it from the past."
"another fine brew from full sail. One of the more underrated breweries in my opinion."
"never a big fan of the ""special"" winter brews save a few. pours out a nice ruby/brown. decent head, some nice lacing. smells malty with a very slight spice. taste isnt bad. infact its pretty good. malty with a good hop presence thats a bit piney. cinnamon comes to mind as well as other holiday flavors. herbal! not thick like some heavyweight winter brews, its nice and medium bodied, in the middle. while not my cup of tea i can def. appreciate it. i could see these going down pretty easy if thats your thing."
"Brown amber with almost no head and little carbonation - unremarkable. Smells like rootbeer, tastes like bland rootbeer and malt liquor...ok, not that bad but the taste is very flat with some spice as an afterthought. Mouthfeel isn't offensive but you wouldn't know you had a beer in your mouth...maybe like cold, watered down au jus? I did finish a six-pack, but only because that's all that was left in the fridge. Just wait 'til nex year?"
"Wow -- I would never buy this one again. Very, very disappointing, after interesting versions of this beer I've had in years past, and after their label describes it as ""ridiculously tasty winter ale."" Blah!"
"Pours a deep cherry red, with brown highlights. Smell is a decent mix of sweet malt and piney, resiny hops. Sweet, caramelly malts are in the forefront flavorwise, turning into a hop bitterness that packs a considerable bite for the style. Overall, a pretty good beer, but it wouldn't be my first choice for a fireside sipper on a cold winter's day."
"Deep dark red in colour. Stunning aromas of lemongrass, ginger, and nutmeg. More lemongrass in the flavor, along with heather, hops, and some grainy malts. I tend to expect seasonals like this to be syrupy and thick, but this one was a nice change of pace. You could actually drink a few of these and still be able to stand up afterwards. Unique!"
"I enjoyed this winter offering."
"Carbonation was perfect and with the abv, this one could be one of the best winter warmers out there IMO. A definite must try if you can find it."
"I absolutely love this beer. Superb!"
"Overall it's a good beer. Good for a cold winter's night, and worth the purchase. But there are a few other that I would take if I had the choice between them and Wassail."
"Well done."
"Wassail's color is dark brown with a creamy, light-brown head of average height. The aroma is an interesting mix of sweet malts and piney hops. Neither dominates, leaving an interesting in-between smell. A sip starts with rich, sweet malt flavor, but towards mid sip piney hops take over and continue through an extended finish. The bitterness level is pretty high and the hops have a pretty strong drying effect. Overall, this isn't a bad beer, but too hoppy to be what I want from a winter warmer. I'd choose an IPA, a 2XIPA, or a maltier winter warmer over Full Sail's Wassail. That said, I'm sure there are some hopheads that'll love this beer."
"A solid winter warmer, I enjoyed it."
"Overall impression: Fairly one dimensional, but a well made beer."
"Bottle kept in my fridge nearly one year to cool the alcohol hot. Bottle says best before 022505, but I thought aging would do this beer good. Pours a three finger tan head over a clear brown beer with redish character. Some tiny particulates suspended in the beer. Smells rough grassy co-ho that's deep, oily, and enticing. An underlying malt sweet works with the hops...more chocolate than caramel. Tastes orange oil hoppy flavored with pine and a rough grassy character. A piercing bitter that's countered very well by the thick sugary malt sweet. The sugar sweet has some chocolate character and maybe a dark nut character (hazelnut?). The finish is dry and I'm left with the impression I've just toked on a cigarette. There is also a sweet fruity ester that I just can't place. Dark and deep ponderous aftertaste. Prune and cinamon. Md body and md-heavy carbonation. As a hop-head, I like the combination of hop flavor, biter, adn grassy co-ho. Nice malty that the hops ride the crest of. Enjoyable, drinkable."
"Drinkability"
"Bottle has a nice picture of a spruce tree in the snowy forest with a single red ball adorning it. The beer poured a tan head, not really prominent, dissipated rapidly. The color is a deep brownish-red. The aroma is a touch malty, a touch fruity, with some woodish notes and a slight higher alcohol fruitiness as well. The flavor is nicely balanced, maybe one of the best balanced brews I've had. It starts with a little malt, but complex, with hints of gingerbread and caramel, then gives a little bit of hop flavor (maybe pine-like?) and some dried fruit flavors, then you get a nice dash of hop bitterness at the end to round it out. Alcohol content is a little rough but still good. Thanks to Secret Santa 2004 nvsblman for this one."
"Something about the blend of hops takes away from the rest of it. Bitterness really takes over the finish, and leaves no trace of the other good flavors. Still, it's not a bad beer."
"Overall, a decent winter warmer, but nothing to write home about."
"Drinkability: Tasted like more, a pleasent wintery one."
"Finally an American winter beer that is not spice riddled. I'm realizing that I like Full Sail beer lately and this brew is no exception. Dark copper body was topped by a medium thick off white head. Lacing was scattered but intricate. Aroma was of slightly toasted malts. Taste profile was a surprise as it was very hoppy with citrus notes. Good drinkable winter beer. I liked that it wasn't real heavy and spicy. a hop accented winter beer and I liked it."
"Dark brown in color -- a deep, but mostly clear, ruby when held to the light. Thin, spotty tan head. Fruitcake and bubblegum aroma, some toffee malt and spice. More bubblegum in the flavor. The biggest selling point is a really nice roasty, bitter flavor at the end that lingers long into the aftertaste. Overall a very English-tasting beer. Medium-bodied and pretty easy-drinking. Not too shabby."
"Not as warm as it is hot. Winter warmer my butt. Just another over-hopped interpretation."
"Rich, dark ruby with a small, off-white head. Nose is made up of grapes (vinous), raisins, tangy malt, backed by evergreen boughs and pine resin. Like a Christmas tree dipped in jam. Sweetish, vinous malt flavors up front. Hops come on big and early. Resinous, piney, and delicious. Finish is bitter and piney with sweet, sugar cookie notes. Yum. Medium-bodied, refreshing, yet warming enough for the winter."
"I could drink it, but it is a bit hoppy for my tastes and seems more bitter than most winter warmers."
"Drinkability is ok for me, I really avoid winter brews however this one is great if I had to drink one."
"Overall, a nice winter warmer, right up there with the best of the style. Full Sail continues to impress me with a nice roster of ales."
"Overall I would rather have a jubelale from Deschutes than another wassail from Full Sail but it is a much better winter warmer than Celebration Ale which should be renamed Holiday IPA as it rhymes and indicates what you will taste better. The brewers at Full Sail should have bottle conditioned this one as well so that it can be aged more than a year and that they could have achieved a much higher carbonation level with less carbonic bite. A great winter beer if it is all that is available besides leftover summerfest and the usual flagship brews."
"A great winter warmer. The color was a deep amber color with a nice off white head that stuck around for a long time. The smell was slightly piney and very spicey and made me want to investigate further. Out of all the winter beers I've had this year, this is one of the better ones for sure. The flavor was ultra balanced with a great bitter hop rush in the beginning that was matched quickly by a kick of malt and spices, and a nice spice aftertaste left me wanting more. Good job!"
"Other comments: Full-flavored, but pretty clean (almost literally from the slight soapy taste!). A good X-mas brew, though. Really fresh taste."
"This is a delightful drinking experience. This beer offers all that you would expect from a winter warmer--rich complex flavor and smooth easy drinkability. A pleasant drink to have while staring at the lights of your Chritmas tree."
"I usually avoid Full Sail due in part to their typically lackluster line-up and atrocious graphic design that appears to be intended for, I don't know, yuppies with sail boats. But this particular brew was a welcomed surprise."
"Nevertheless, this is a pretty good brew. The pine especially suits the time of year well."
"Drinkability- Better as it warms. Didn't sense a huge alcohol presence, which makes it go down easily. Good beer, but not great. But definitely worth a try each Christmas."
"This beer pours an amber brown with a white cascading head. The beer has a nice hop aroma with a bit of sweet malt aroma also smells estery but not that pleasant of esters, smells yeasty (but is not bottle conditioned?) and alcoholic. Taste is roasted malts, not as sweet as I thought it would be but it is fairly well hopped so this may skew my perception. Nice hoppy aftertaste. Alcohol taste is there as well, it could be blended in better, perhaps this beer could have used more aging. Probably couldn't drink very many of these because of the alcohol content but is a nice sipping brew."
"A little disappointed here with my first Full Sail sampling, although my expectations were high."
"2004 edition pours a nice reddish brown with a tan head that is pleasant to look at. The smell is of a pine tree with citrus zest, a spicy nut arom linger, baked pie crust and toasted grain, the taste is a spiced apple and baked squash with a pine wood hop taste, hints of spiced crust blend well with the hops. Good quality beer."
"2002 edition. Pours a reddish brown hue with a cream colored head that fades quickly. Has a sweet caramel smell. A sweet caramel taste up front followed by nicely roasted grains. Medium - heavy body which leaves the flavors on the tongue for a while. Not a lot of hop action here. Super smooth and easy drinking. nice."
"It pours a clear, deep ruby-brown/black with a thin wisp iof a head. The aroma is fruity, roasty, amlty, and piney. It has quite a bit of fruity esters (cherry and banana) some caramel, and a roasted almost burnt malt taste. It does not seem to be too hoppy, but it is older, though I do not know how old. It also has a slight pleasant oxidized taste to it as well. I can see where this beer would age well."
"Pours out reddish/amberish color with a thin head. Aroma is sweet sugary, fruity and slightly malty. Taste was sweet, malt and a bit of fruit a light hoppy backround as well. Didn't really notice a high carbonation but there was a bit of bubbles. Very smooth and easily drinkable. Pretty good winter brew."
"2003 12 oz. bottle: This one poured a cloudy brown color. There wasn't too much head at all. A bit of fruit and spices to the nose, with a hint of roastiness in the background. The taste is malty, yet a touch sour. Possibly some cherries in there? Slightly dry and a hint of bitterness to the aftertaste. Good!"
"Deep garnet hue, with a slight haze. Vigorous pour yields a one fingered, persistant, dense beige head. Tattered lace remains. Hop nose is a combination of gentle citrus and sweet, earthy wood. Mellow bubblegum esters meld well with the stately dark lovibond crystal malt. Trace butterscotch and cocoa hints. Understated and clean aromawise. In flavor, a snap of dryish, chocolate malt bitterness upfront is ensued by a melange of burnt caramel and sweet biscuit. Sweetness diminishes progressively, with hop bitterness eventually becoming dominant. Subdued herbal hop flavor with a pine needle twang. Hints of caramelized plum arise late, but are brushed aside promptly by the hop presence. Well calculated in attenuation, with a dextrinous mouthfeel a notch shy of velvety. Finishes with a resurgence of sweetness, with soft notes of toast and maple sap fading readily. A rather gentle old ale, but certainly well balanced and with ample character to keep the palate interested. Any less viscous and this would run the risk of being insipid. Regardless, Wassail is a tasty ""winter warmer."""
"2003 Edition: A lovely dark reddish/brownish colour. The aromas are very sweet, fruity, piney, and all over the place. Kind of like an OSA with sugar added....interesting. The taste is very sweet and fruity with some definate light hops and malts in their. The mouthfeel is a bit thick, but never cloying and the drinkability is nice. A good one!"
"For the year 2003. It had a nice brown/copper color with a small head that did not last too long. The lace was decent. It had a fragrant, fruity aroma with elements of grapefruit, and berries. The taste was good, citrusy and fruity, with the presence of caramel. A good use of flavoring hops added much to the taste. The mouthfeel was smooth, bitter, alcoholly, and a little oily. It culminated with a smooth, dry, sweet finish. A pleasant beer to have around."
"This is a dark mahogany beer with a small, light tan, thick head. Dishwasher-spotty lacing. Aroma is sweet and floral; a nice creaminess with underlying toffee and some grapes. Very hoppy in the front. A tangy, fruity full middle. A bitter, floral, dark hoppy dry finish with some nice spiciness. A little grainsy in the aftertaste. There's almost a red wine thing going on in the finish for me. The sweetness in the nose never really developed. But I still think this is a very good beer."
"There is something about winter ales that allow a certain abandon to their creation. This version pours a deep chocolate with a thin lace. Deep sweet chocolate and caramel aromas. The smooth, sweet flavor hints at bitter-sweet chocolate and sugary caramel. The bitterness is moderate with a heart-warming finish and an earthy spruce hop spice.. Balanced and tasty on a stormy winter night."
"Dark brown color, with a very small, short-lasting off-white head. Smells of roasted malt. Tastes of coffe and roasted flavors. Has other flavors that I can't really place, but this is an enjoyable winter brew, to say the least. There are better examples out there, but this is still worth trying."
"I'm tasting a 2002 and 2003 side-by-side. The aged 2002 is a bit cloudy... both have a small head that sits for a while. Both are wonderful examples of the ""American Christmas Special""....malty/hoppy, high alcohol and highly flavored old ale - dopplebock - trippel - porter variant that takes a moment to warm in the mouth before hitting you with a punch. Reminds me of the Anchor Christmas seasonal. Lots of reviewers seem unimpressed. Let them drink Pabst! I think it's a wonderful beer. Consider letting a couple age a year or two...don't be scared. Fresh up it has more bite...aged it has a rounded dessert-like quality. I think it's my last 2002, so I'll put a few 2003's aside and write again in a few years. Merry Christmas!"
"Not a huge, complex or unusually spiced beer, but a very drinkable, great-tasting brew. I'll be back for more."
"Didn't really know what to make of this beer. The aroma was somewhat like that of the '02 Anchor X-Mas Ale but the flavor wasn't as appealing. Still, an interesting brew."
"Recommended."
"Well it has been 2 years since I sampled this beer, so let us see if it has improved any in that time. The pour is an unblurred sanguineous color, the head exorbitant in size and frothy in texture, as it degenerates, it leaves glutinous sheets of lace to smother the glass. Nose is spicy with aromas of cinnamon and nutmeg, coriander and, malt, lightly sweet and a real sniffer for the old schnozzle. Start is all malt, the top skimpy in mouth feel, just not all there, the finish is mildly carbonated, sparsely hopped, the aftertaste dry and lightly bitter. Cannot really say this beer does much for me, waterish and just lacking in my humble opinion."
"Sampled 11/19/03"
"Aromas of malt, fruit (perhaps some cherry notes), and a subdued spice character as well. A brown ale with a thin tan head, that shows deep clear amber hues when held up to the light. Nice, pretty well balanced, though perhaps a tad thin. Lightly sweet in the front, with a bit of bitterness and spiciness in the finish. It is like a little brother to Deschutes Jubelale. Some definite cherry notes here. Really does remind me of a weaker version of the Jubelale. If I had not had that, I would think a bit more highly of this. Still this is pretty good."
"Drinkability  A nice example of the style, especially at a little over a dollar a bottle."
"What a great beer to have with game and root veggies. Might even be nice to go with a spicy, homemade pumpkin pie. Bonus."
"I don't know if they change the recipe yearly, but this was enjoyed more than in past years."
"Notes: Wow, pretty interesting stuff; will definitely seek this out in the future."
"The mouthfeel is bold. It is very present. It has a bit of an alcohol bite and some slickness. The drinkability falls in the sipping category for me personally. It goes down very easily but I will still sip. All I need now is for it to snow in So.Cal. and a fire place."
"Love the name 'Wassail'. Dark mahogany with a very sturdy beige head and loads of sticky lace. A nice fruity aroma mixes well with sweet malt and floral hops. The sweet and smoky heavy malt blends nicely with the complex (berries, citrus and lightly metallic) hop bite. This is a strong and hearty winter offering. I hope to find some more this coming winter. Thanks Genaro!"
"2000 version-Deep Red color, medium head. Roasted malts, full flavor, aggressively hopped. Robust full mouthfeel. Very malty. Finish is crisp. Aftertaste is malty and somewhat bitter."
"This brew has a nice malty nose. What really ruined it for me was the astringent aftertaste. I may try it again next year when it's out, but this was a big disappointment. You win some, you lose some."
"Pretty drinkable even for a hot sweaty night."
"-Beautiful flowery hop flavor nestled into a fine malt base. Sweet malt up front with perfect hop balance...really nice flavor...more hops evident deeper into the beer..mahogany reddish in appearance...this is a splendid beer..."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with a foamy light tan colored head that fades into a bubbly lace. Nose is fresh cedar and pine with notes of floral hops, citrus, and spice. Medium in body with a bit of a slick mouthfeel from the hop oils. Taste is sweet malt and dark fruit at first followed by a touch of chocolate and some earthy herbal flavors. Bitter hop resins are present towards the finish and remain in a lingering aftertaste. A nice winter warmer."
"This beer pours a deep brown color with a thin white head. There are many smells to this beer, most notable are hop and floral. Based on the smells of the beer I was expecting a strong hoppy beer, somewhat similar to the sierra nevada celebration ale, but this beer was surprisingly subtle. It is hoppy without being overwhelming. I was expecting more malt flavors, but they were'nt missed. Once the beer warms some, a slight cranberry flavor arises, and the hops become more present. This gives the beer a very nice character. Overall this is a very good winter brew, very drinkable with decent complexity. definately something i could drink often. I almost wish it wasnt a seasonal brew, because I would enjoy this beer any time of the year."
"The body is a hazy mahogany with hard to find orange and ruby highlights. A short and very creamy light tan head comes up during the pour, but it drops off almost as quickly. It does, however, maintain a nice creamy collar, and leaves some spotty lace. The nose is subtle but enticing. It offers some light-toffee-ish maltiness, some gentle fruitiness, a touch of almost indistinguishable spice (nutmeg, all-spice?, light cinnamon?, coriander?) and some mild floral hops. The body is medium/light with an exceptionally fine-bubbled, mild carbonation that's creamy and smooth in the mouth. The flavor starts with some soft berry-like fruitiness that develops into a light candyish note before revealing its caramelish malt character as it crosses the palate. It finishes with a flair of spice that dries more than the underlying bitterness. Generic spice and candyish sweetness linger in the mouth and throat along with some piney hop character. Definitely and interesting brew if given the chance! Worth trying."
"Overall, this is a really nice winter sipping brew to be drank on cold nights next to warm fires. I recommend it."
"Fine, sturdy, off-white head, dark brown color. Sweet aroma, but nothing too distinctive coming through. Faint hints of toffee, nuts, spices. Mild hoppiness, medium carbonation. Sweet maltiness. Very mild, very mellow, but to a fault. I like my winter ales with more of a kick, and this slides down too smooth for my tastes. Feels as if they were shooting for something like Anchor's Our Special Ale, but something held them back."
"Nice color, deep, deep red-brown. The head is average size and dry and sandy looking. The aroma is warm malt and is a bit spicy. The flavor is less malty than I would have thought with the appearance. A bit sour in the finish. Coriander? The mouthfeel is a bit fuzzy."
"My first Full Sail beer and if I can help it, it wont be my last. Thanks to TXHops for the brew."
"I will investigate other Full Sail beers from hereon in."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"2002 release. Very nice looking brew. A dark, dark red body, almost brown, very much like the color of a barleywine. The head is light tan (also like barleywine) and retains exceptionally. Aroma is that of pine and Christmas tree-like hops, very nice touch, I was waiting for a Christmas beer that was hopped like this. Combined with that is a toasted malt, making a very unique aroma. Just a touch of fruitiness is in there as well. As for the flavors, wow, this is very unique as well. The hops are definitely American-style, while the malt is very English. Hops are more spicy here, with the Christmas tree/pine character being more of an undertone. A bit of citrus is noticeable as well. The malt is toasted, sweet, and bread-like. In addition to all of that, I'm getting some dried fig. Excellent beer, very drinkable. Definitely much more than I was expecting from it. I'll definitely have this again, and again, and again..."
"First, thanks to Bighuge for enabling me to sample this beer! It pours a dark reddish brown with a light tan head. Roasted malt is what I mostly detect in the aroma. Roasted malt and spices dominate the flavor up front. The beer is well balanced with hops and finishes neutral to slightly bitter. Very drinkable with a very good flavor, although I might prefer it to be just a bit bolder. Great Winter Ale!"
"I must say, this is one of the better winter seasonals I've tried thus far. This beer pours out dark brown with a reddish tint. It has a decent off white head that falls to a thin layer on top. The balance can be detected right off the bat on the nose with both malt and hops competing for attention. Malt speaks up first on the tongue while the hops get in the last word and speak bitterly into the long finish. A good balance of sweet malt with a touch of molassas and hops with a piney earthiness make this beer a delight to drink. Throw in a touch of warming alcohol and you have yourself a hearty brew that chases away the winter blues. Thanks to dolem98 for enabling me to enjoy this great west coast treat."
"Dark ruby-brown appearance...nicely mannered head at 1/4 inch after settling.  Malty aroma, a sense of brown sugar.  Nice body, satisfying caramel and spiced taffy quality, just a bit of citrus mid-mouth.  Generous, but not overbearing hops at the finish with a smooth swallow.  Very pleasant, one of the non-agressive Old Ales.  Nice middle-of-the-road Winter brew to have in the rotation ""arsenal", sort of ""session"" in flavor profile."
"Very enjoyable! Initial aroma is of fruit. The first taste is very complex and gets better as you drink it and as it warms up some. It warms you up too. Excellent hop/malt balance."
"Dark reddish brown and nearly opaque in color.  Very little white head ringed the glass.  Sweet grain and citrus smells were the most evident with a slight spicy undertone.  Mouthfeel is very creamy and adds a lot to the beer.  Caramel, fruit and a hint of chocolate compromise a majority of the malt flavors.  As the beer works itself to the back of the mouth, the bitterness really kicks in and rounds out the flavor profile."
"Notes: Very much a winter warmer with an American flare ... very impressive and a sheer joy to sip at cellar temp (55*F). One of the hoppier winter brews to be had. If you see this one on the shelf, buy it and sip the cold winter away."
"Proured a nice dark amber brown with very little foam. The aroma has a strong malty smell and the taste was of a malty with a hint of spice flavor with a smooth finish. There was not much of a bitter after taste, but just enough to balance everything together."
"Well, I need to quit hitting these winter beers so damn early in the season, but my self-controll seems to still be on summer vacation. This is another exceptional winter beer. Super dark color which is very difficult to get any amber tones off of, but not as black as Gunniess. Nice piney scent and the taste is out of this world. Good full-flavor hoppiness to this outstanding beer. This is a great winter brew sureto keep me warm through the long and cold rainy season out here in the PNW."
"Nice brown color with a hint of ruby.  Thin milky head.  Great aroma.  Nice hop boquet.  (Guessing it was dry hopped with centennial or cascade.)  Also a hint of spice on the nose.  Nutmeg?  Nice full body.  Warming effect is definately here.  Nicely balanced beer as I get some good maltiness with decent hop notes.  Has a bitter aftertaste.  Nicely rounded winter brew."
