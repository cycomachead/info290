The taste was very fresh with hints of citrus balanced nicely with the powerful hop bitterness. Mixed in well was the sweet malt and biscuit like tones. I could slightly pick up on the 7.6% ABV which was a nice reminder that this is a winter warmer. The finish is nice with a crisp dryness.

As it slowly fell, it left some great sticky lacing in its wake. Color was a deep-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose smelled strongly of both minty hops and caramel malts, much like some AIPAs that I have had of late. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste reminded me more of a young ABW between the preponderance of biting, minty hops and sweet caramel malt. I may try to remember to buy an extra bottle for cellaring next year as the result of tonight's exercise. Finish was semi-dry with the malt providing just enough of a counterbalance to keep it reasonable. Man, this was quite the find!","woodychandler","May 30, 2013"

It was difficult to pinpoint, because it's not exactly what I'd call a winter ale, nor is it a golden ale like Leffe, but it does bring those to mind. After writing up my notes, I had to peek at top reviewers and I saw one which mentioned ""cardamom."" Rats--exactly what I'd been tasting and could just not pinpoint myself. Well, I'll add ""anise"" to that, the two of which will account for the unanticipated spice notes. Appearance and pour: 1/4 beady head with hazy golden, tan color. Very pleasing nose of chamomile flowers and cinna-mint (cinnamint sans gum flavor). Body: full although that is cut and masked by very active carbonation and a dry finish. Starts peppery, mid way smooth, lacto and barley drive-bys but zero yeasty bready Belgian aleness. Finish again peppery, spiced, spiked, dry. This is an interesting winter beer, and I'm sorry its uniqueness initiate a 'categorical error' in those who've found it wanting.","marcellaproust","Nov 10, 2012"

3.96,7.6,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"A nice biscuity malt complements some very well balanced citrus and pine hop notes that leave a lingering bitterness in the back. The citrus is of the orange rind variety in its dry and crisp mouthfeel and finish. Quick and clean feel but remains a full-bodied beer with that biscuity malt providing character beyand the hops. That malt tends to linger a bit in the aftertaste. Its smooth in front and then a little prickly in the back with the tingle of hops and booze. The warming alcohol is definitely detectable but adds another layer of depth to the beer. The hops really make this one as they are perfectly balanced in their bitterness, lending a nice complement to the malt bill and vice versa. The medium-high carbonation levels are nice, as the mouthfeel is the other part that makes this beer so enjoyably drinkable. This is a nice beer, full flavored and lots of character. I recommend and I would probably seek this out again.","chodinheaven","Nov 19, 2011"

3.68,0,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Bi frost looks like a lighter version of a winter warmer from looks alone, it's not as dark as most in the spectrum. Hazed golden with burnt orange with some coppa. Nice sheet of lace on the way down.when real cold this smells like a pale malted monster with sweet malt galore. Some warming brings forth some light spice but not one type I can put my finga on. Taste is the same, sweet malt completely engulfs this beer when cold but warming brings spice. A very lightly spiced warmer here, this one is hard to describe, kinda simple body is medium with a malty sweet profile. Carb on the low end. This aint half bad, one of the easier drinking winter warmers I've had. I would go for another.","BARFLYB","Feb 17, 2010"

4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"A winter ale that manages to succeed without spices. Bifröst (silly name - also, Elysian's new packaging is not my cup of tea) is a pleasant-looking, mildly hazy, copper-colored affair with a creamy, lasting head. This beer has an interesting blend of European and American hop aromas, grapefruits and grass. It's much more hop assertive than I was expecting, but there is a definite doughy malt presence. The taste is mildly dry with a pleasant, medium bitterness. It's a medium-bodied beer with a touch of wateriness in the finish. The finish is nice and bitter.

I put it in the DBF right away and drank it about a month later. I didn't get any ""off"" notes or evident oxidation, so I think it was OK. Perhaps there would've been more of a hoppy character had I drank it back in March, however.

It has a very smooth, malty flavor that really showcases the pale and Munich malts. It goes down easy with a stiff hop bitterness and grainy finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a great winter warmer. It's not all spiced up. It's just a solid beer with added alcohol and hops.","WesWes","Mar 02, 2009"

A nice bready malt with a dab of honey and a nice juicy hop flavor profile. Hops used more for flavor than for bittering. The feel is thick and chewy, soft carbonation leads to a nice silky feel, finishes sweet. An enjoyable brew, though not sure of the winter warmer status. A nice malty APA.","Gmann","Dec 17, 2008"

Citrus fruit, brown sugar, herbal/earthy notes and caramel on the tongue, im really enjoying the fruity bitter blast just before the finish. Warming for sure, but the alcohol doesnt seems maybe a bit too apparent, muddling the beers main profile.

Palate is nicely balaced between pale malt and piney hops, with light fruity notes lingering in the background and a touch of mustiness from the yeast.

Taste is light yet ample maltiness up front, quickly overtaken by the aforementioned piney hops character, which segues ever so gently into the slightest spicing at the close. Alcohol warming sneaks up on you. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent. A great NW interpretation of a style that isn't always my favorite, I must admit. Find this one, it's worth the effort.","ppoitras","Feb 26, 2005"

3.73,1.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a hazy orange-copper color, it is topped by a frothy light tan head. The aroma smells initially of hops, with notes of citrus, and pine. As I dig deeper, the hops are all that I really can smell, notes of orange, wildflowers, and spicy herbs. The beer is actually quite tasty, with a somewhat light palate, but it is quite mouth coating. It is a nicely hoppy beer, with notes of citrus and pine, plus a sharply bitter finish that has a certain hoppy astringency to it. This is quite a nice hoppy pale ale/ IPA, hops for the holiday. I certainly like this beer, though it is certainly nothing like I was expecting it to be. It is quite simplistic in it's hoppiness (no real maltiness to back it up), but sometimes that hits the spot.","Gueuzedude","Dec 17, 2004"
4.14,12.5,3,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark amber with little head. Hoppy floral aroma with a hint of malty sweetness. Slightly sweet taste balanced with grapefruitty hops, lingering hop aroma. Body was moderate, not too thick, not too thin. A very smooth beer for it's abv, and a drinkable one at that.","zacharius","Beers"

4.03,9.5,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours amber with minimal head. Drops to a wisp of bubbles. Hoppy nose and slight sweetness - honey. Starts with mild sweetness which is taken out by nice hop bittering. Grapefruit and pineapple flavors with just a hint of cinammon. The bittering is intense on the finish, which also welcomes a pronounced alcohol warming. Very long bitter finish. Not traditional winter warmer, but a northwest hop oriented warmer. Nice.","sweethome","Jan 04, 2004"

4,8.7,4,4,4,3,4.5,"The beer as it disembogues from the bottle a deep translucent copper color with a prodigious sized, frothy and a off white head, as it dissipates the lace forms a thick and concealing sheet to obscure the glass. The nose has a nice hop floral crispness at the front, the middle sweet malt, finish is crisp and clean, and start is sweet and has a nice malt profile with the top light to moderate in feel. Finish is benignly carbonated, the hop spiciness quite pronounced, aftertaste is desert dry and long lasting with a bit of a Tummy warming from the 7.5 percent ABV, if theres a problem with this beer it seems a bit thin body wise, but nonetheless a fine drinking beer and a great brewery that produces a fine line of beers overall.","Gusler","Nov 24, 2003"
