"Overall- This beer lacks in a lot of aspects, but it just good enough tasting that I wouldnt pass it up if offered one. That being said, I definitly would never seek one out either."
""
"O- this one was all over the place in flavor, but they surprisingly all meshed very well, making it very drinkable. I was surprised by this one and wish I would have bought more than one bottle."

"O: This beer isn’t really that good of a sipper because it’s lighter in body compared to others in the style and doesn’t provide alcohol warming. On the other hand, it’s rather easy to drink if you are looking for something that is fruity and malty."
"I expected way worse, so I come away with a decent six-pack that I'm going to drink quickly before I lose that March holiday spirit. I'm assuming the purchaser didn't pay much for the pleasure, which makes this all the more recommedable. Personally, I could go either way. I don't NEED to have this again, but would enjoy it next year if it comes cheap (especially, as cheap as this!). Happy Holidays/First Day of Spring! 3.5"

"Dundee Festive Ale is a very clear, sparkling, amber ale with a huge, pillowy, off white head. It leaves a bunch of festive lacing on the glass. It has just a very slight whiff of soft malt and medicinal herbs. The soft, creamy medium body has a dry, slightly silty finish. There's some fruity malt that's a touch sweet, a little bit of spice and a touch of bitterness. Everything's pretty subdued. It almost seems a little salty. That reminds me of Genny Bock. It's not really exciting, but it goes down just fine."
""
"D: Not special, but certainly very good for the price point. Drinkable enough. A nice balance of malts, spice, and hops. Sort of a richly malty and spiced ESB. Another solid and reasonable offering from one of the lesser celebrated “gateway” breweries."
"Overall - I love Dundee and this is a pretty good winter warmer. Better than others I've had."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. Goes down nicely. Overall, a good brew. Better than expected, and this is nice on a cold winter evening."
"I agree with those who don't find much holiday spice in either the smell or the taste. For me, this beer had characteristics more in line with an Octoberfest style than a Winter Warmer. My review scores reflect how I feel it fits as a Winter Warmer."
""
""
"O: This was okay. I definitely liked the Weyerbacher more."

"The beer pours a slightly hazy orange color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of caramel and toffee malt. I don't get any holiday spices or other aromas that I typically attribute to winter warmers. The flavor is rich and malty with a little bit of nutmeg mixed in. The beer is very lightly spiced but the spices are present. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A decent winter warmer, but not one of the better examples of the style."
"Winter warmer light? Pours a copper color, light copper maybe. Moderate head with decent retention. Allspice in the nose. Other spices clearly found on palate, especially cinnamon. Light caramel flavors. Incredibly light bodied and watery. Could have tricked me into thinking this is a BMC product."
"you could drink a few of these and you would be good to go. is great straight to the finish."
"Drinkability - not a bad tasting ale, but at the same time a little bland. It'd be nice if more of the flavors on the label popped out at me. So, not very complex-tasting, but not bad tasting either."
"Lots of balance here, and no overwhelming complexities or over-spicing to kill drink- ablilty; meaning you could have more than one and not feel the need to move on."
"D - Well it's good but no really something I could see as a go to winter warmer. It's pretty decent and well deserved of at least a B+ rating but to me seems to need more spice."
"12 oz bottle: ""Ale brewed with spices"" An interesting herbal aroma, spiced, with some caramel malts coming through. Pours a deep mahogany hue that is clear with a minimal bone colored head. Taste is alright, nothing special with the spice notes coming through on the front of the taste then mellowing into caramel and bananas. Overall, It's decent nothing great by any means but very drinkable."
"D: Pretty drinkable. Flavor is a little reserved and flat, despite the tasting credit I gave the brew above. A good brew nonetheless."
"This beer did just fine on this snowy winter eve."
"Happy holidays!"
"Drinkable indeed. The 6.2% is a nice touch as I like my winter brews kicked up abit."
"I say about this beer what I'll say about all of Dundee's beers: If you want to teach someone about beer, by some Dundee styles and train them on what are simple examples of the various styles. I think they empty the brewery's spice rack with this one as the flavor profile is all over the place. It is an interesting treat for those long winter nights."
"Banana seemed a bit out of place in a winter warmer..."
"Out of a bottle this Winter Warmer was a hazy amber color with one finger of tan head that had some reddish highlights to it. As I consumed the beer the head retained itself at first but eventually disappeared entirely. However, the lacing was in sliding patches while it lasted. The aroma was of caramel malt, rye, spices, dark fruit, some alcohol, wood and a little must. The flavors were similar, starting with the caramel malt note in then went into the more woody elements accentuated by the spices followed by the bitterness of a slightly-over-the-hill beer. Admittedly, though well cared for, this brew four months ago would have been better. It was malty at first, then dry and earthy and that was about it. The body was medium, the mouthfeel average and the carbonation fine."
"D - I didn't like this one. I got this beer in a Winter brews sampler pack on clearance. I have never seen this company's beer other than this one bottle, but I wouldn't be interested in another."
"This is more complex than I first gave credit. As with all my surprise beers, I'd love to try this in a blindfolded flight with similar offerings. I suspect that this beer would do better than the average."
"Kind of thought this would of been better. I usually like dundee beers so I gave this a try. Poured out a nice dark amber with good head. A sweet caramel is all I could really get out of the smell as well as the taste. Aftertase for me was pretty alcoholic. Not the spicy, lively festive ale i was expecting. A good beer nonetheless."
"Taste still has plenty of sweet spices with a burnt caramel maltiness. Some blackened toast comes in at the end and it seems like most of the hop presence has left this beer some time ago. Finishes spice-laden and wet. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style and there is a bit too much of a burnt spice flavor for my liking. Still, better than I thought it would be and there is surprisingly not a whole lot of oxidized malt in here."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has an amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of malts, some citrus. Taste is good , malts, spices and citrus. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a fine quality brew."
"Pretty drinkable, but nothing to gawk over as far as Winter Warmers go. Still, for the low price of $5.99 a six-pack, it's hard to argue with this beer, as it provides almost unrivaled bang-for-your-buck value."
"Poured into a pint glass beer was a medium brown in color with a small head and very light lacing. Smell was rather weak from what i was expecting with only a hint of caramel and nutmeg. Taste wasn't bad but not as pronounced in the spice dept. as advertised. This seemed a little weak and maybe a bit flat to me. Dry finish with a little lingering nutmeg aftertaste. Mouthfeel was light with low carb bite. Drinkability was not a problem for me with the 6.2 abv barely noticeable. Not bad overall but pretty much a ho-hum beer in my eyes. I picked up a six tonite on a whim for $4.99 so what the heck? I don't see myself beating a path to the store for more but not bad for dundee. Buying this from the local martins grocery store probably didn't help this beer any what with the way they store and display their offerings."
"Drinkability: Not one I'll be revisiting. For me, it comes up as far too thin and lacking for a wintertime ale or even for a beer with the word ""festive"" in the title."
"A 12 ounce bottle, thanks to brothercannon for this. Poured into my shaker glass. The ale appears a clear golden amber color with about a quarter-inch of off white foam. Nose and flavors consist of toasted grains, bread, mild notes of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and citrus (mainly orange), light caramel sweetness, a bit of spiciness on the tongue, candied apples. Medium bodied with decent carbonation. Lightly spiced and uncomplicated. Thanks again Tim."
"I have had the Dundee products before and felt that they have done well with a few of their offerings so I saw this at my local beer store, they where just unloading cases of it at 2.99 a 6 pack or 10 for a case. Decided to just get a 6 pack and give it a try as some of the holiday beers I feel are over spiced. This one poured to a dark amber color with a thick head that while being off white seemed to have some of the amber color in it. The aroma was fair to say the least, the spice was there but was not over the top and there was a nice malt presence that seemed to give a slight nutty caramel like scent. The spice was nutmeg, with a bit of cinnamon. The flavors where also quite good, spice was there but again not over the top. The flavors give a slight impression of a brown ale, which seems to be a great base, caramel with a slight chocolate taste. Cinnamon is tame, which is a good thing while I think the nutmeg stands out a bit. Overall, a pretty easy drinking brew. In hind site I wish I had picked up the case, as the beer is pretty good, especially for the price."
"Overall- The best Dundee offering I have had yet. I am mildly impressed."
"About a finger of rich beige head sits atop a dark amber brew. I've got quite a bit of carbonation bubbling up from my SA pint glass. Burnt brown sugar aroma with hints of spices (nutmeg is most dominant for me) caramel and oranges. Malty on the front and the spices are pretty tame, but they do seem to build. Allspice is the most notable on the palette. This is the best Dundee offering I've had, but I'd not go out of my way to have it again."
"Taste: I think the cinnamon might be a little overdone. Pretty good winter warmer but perhaps a little over spiced."
"P.S. And now for the airing of grievances!"
"Not a bad winter warmer, but much better offerings on the market."
"A drinkable winter warmer, no frills and no surprises. Let this one get to optimum temperature for best results."
"Pours a copper color with 1 finger of head that fades to a thin covering with some chunky lacing. The nose is dominated by a roasted malt aroma with some hints of sweetness and fruit. Has a nice, malty taste with quite a bit of crispness from the carbonation that keeps it lively on the tongue. Just a hint of some spice, mostly the nutmeg, before finishing with a slightly bitter, lingering, somewhat plastic taste. Body is on the thin side of medium. Despite a somewhat funky finish, not a bad beer."
"D: This brew is nothing special, but it's decent. It's a simple, run of the mill Christmas seasonal."
"Not bad at all. Easy to drink and it shows that High Falls can produce beers that even though they may not take home awards, are still quite drinkable."
"Perhaps it is because I obtained a very fresh sample, but it seems that this year's Dundee Festive Ale is the best one produced. I am going to pour one of these tonight on St. Nikolas Eve. Cheers!"
"This beer isn't really all that bad, but it's not all that great."
"Overall, rather light-bodied and unbalanced, with an astringent,acidic finish"
"Flavor is lighter than expected and a bit watery in nature. Lightly malty up front and with the spices dominating the close and becoming rather dry on the finish. Feel is a bit thin and the dry chalkiness of the spices limit drinkability for me, almost as if the spices were added after the fact given the lack of complexities on the nose."
"This is a pretty solid winter warmer. Smells a little overspiced but mellows out a little in the taste. Some nice cinnamon notes and a strong malty backbone. Not much of a hops presence but that's to be expected. With a bit of a tune up this could be something special."
"It has a sweet and spicy aroma that has a little bit of musk to it. It has a nice head at first that disappears quickly with some staying power. It is sort of off-white. It had a variety of different sized bubbles which I found to be unique. It has a red/brown body but mainly red. It little bit of carbonation to the body. It has a spicy flavor. You can definitely taste the nutmeg and the cinnamon. The spices are proportioned well and are not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is creamy."
"Drinkability: Not atrocious, just not very enticing"
"Dundee Festive Ale is a pretty good winter warmer that colors well within the lines of the style. It's spiciness shouldn't offend too many people and I'm sure that its price is on the friendly side as well. Bottom line: not bad if you aren't expecting fireworks."
"Very rich mouthfeel with some peppery carbonation. Drinkability is good, the problem is very easy: the beer just doesn't taste all that great. Obviously, that's a problem if you're the one drinking it."
"D - Good to try but not the best out there. Recommend trying it at a bar before getting the six pack."
"D - Overall a pretty good beer from High Falls a pretty easy to drink winter warmer thats enjoyable"
"this beer has a lot goin for it, good flavors, worth a try. especially good for dundee"
"mouthfeel is dry and biscuity, sweetness and roasty, fairly easy to drink and to style, not bad!"
"(D) A pleasant brew, but lacking a little of the ""warming""."
"Notes: Overall it was a pleasant Winter Warmer Ale."
"Pours with three finger off-white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Nice clear amber color. Malty nose. Light carbonation and light-medium-bodied. Flavor is some caramel, hints of nutmeg; finish has some of bitterness. $1.75 for a 12oz from Barb's Beer Emporium Concord, NH."
"I recommend this one for those who enjoy this style of beer."
"I am not the style police and I rate accordingly."
"D- A different take on the style and reminds me more of a beer I would drink on a nice fall day. Enjoyable, but maybe a bit forgettable."
"The feel is syrupy and oily smooth; buttery. This beer -- overall -- is a solid, sweet ale. Lots of cinnamon and nutmeg. A nice little winter ale."
"The old twist off pours a dark copper with a tight khaki cap that retains nicely and holds a good covering for the duration. A little lacing would have been nice, but still a decent looking brew. The nose smells like ginger snaps, cinnamon rolls and subtle floral notes, maybe a hint of the orange peel the label speaks of. A decent malt backbone took me by surprise, I had been of the impression that Dundee was clearly incapable of good malting up till now. This is pretty heavily spiced as well and I am glad that it is. Without going overboard this is a pretty nice WW. Taste like pepper nuts, a German cookie that I don't normally like all that much, but here it's appealing to my pallet. I do pick up on the orange and citrus notes more than in the nose. A very soft and silky body gives this offering a nudge beyond average. A drinkable and enjoyable offering that won't knock your stocking off the mantle, but will give you the flavor and spirit you need to make it through the holidays."
"I actually like this a lot. It has a nice crisp carbonation. That along with the nice mellow sweetness and the dominant spiciness makes this a drinker. I would buy a case of these to have in the refrigerator around the holidays."
"Not one of my favorites I may have to give this one another try maybe i got the bottom of the keg."
"Pours a clear amber color. 1/5 inch head with poor retention and very slight lacing. Has a good hop aroma along with some strong herb/spices. Fits the style quite nicely. Has a crisp and smooth mouth feel. The carbonation level is a little high, but it doesn't detract from the smoothness or flavor. Tastes sweet and there is a good malt flavor. Hints of some spices in the background, present in the prefect quantity. Any hops are barely noticeable. Overall, a smooth and full-bodied beer. The aftertaste is mostly the spice. This is one of the better offerings in the Dundee line."
"Drinkability: Out of alot of the Dundee's I've tried, this is one of my favorites out of the bunch. This brew features the right elements and spice to make it a real treat during cold months, a bit thin, but defintley a better brew from the Dundee family."
"For the price its a pretty decent choice. Very drinkable. Not the best, but far from the worst (which is true of almost all High Falls' offerings)."
"The mouth is a trifle thin, but I do like the silkiness. Not a bad effort, would be a nice introduction to spiced beers for lots of folks."
"It's worth a test-drive. And the second one I tried was a bit better than the first. Not bad for the price either."
"This is a good winter warmer, I'll be using this as my winter fix when I get a craving for a Summit Octoberfest."
"Drinkability: Good. It fits the profile, but doesn't excel. It's not a bad winter warmer, but not memorable."
"D: Nothing really stands out about this one, but it's a super drinkable, middle of the road holiday beer at a good price. Not overly spiced or alcoholic, but with decent character, this is sessionable."
"D: A pretty good offering from Dundee. Better than I was expecting, given my past experiences with this brewery. Definitely worth the purchase."
"Ok, I am finally impressed with a brew from the JW Dundees line. This is a nice little inexpensive spiced seasonal. Good amber/copper pour with a monster head that doesn't leave. Decent lacing and ample carbonation. Bitter scent with a solid malt nose and a touch of different spices, needs to be more aromatic. Filling brew and somewhat thick, although the finish has an empty bitterness. Semi-rich malty base with hints of many spices. Cinnamon, nutmeg and perhaps a touch of ginger seem to stand out. A bit of honey is present. For what it's worth I was impressed by this offering considering most of this brewer's products tend to be rather bland. The easiness with the blend of spices really stands out."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and pretty smooth, and this is pretty dirnkable. It's just boring. If you love caramel malt then this is probably your thing, but if you're looking for a bit more going on in your beer, then this will bore you as it did me."
"Medium bodied, fairly smooth and drinkable, a bit milder than some ""warmers"" but definitely worth a try."
"A great seasonal I hope to see again soon."
"D - Not bad in the sense that it is offensive to my taste buds, but I could find something better and would not give this a second taste. I guess without a freshness date it is hard to tell the age of this, after learning it was retired makes me question it"
"D - This is a pretty good beer. One of the better brews in the JW Dundee line."
"Pours transluscent maroon. Spiced, tart malt with perhaps hints of spiced cider. Rich toasty malt flavor with nice, noticeable wintry spices. Rich, surprisingly full mouthfeel, and crisp carbonation. Better than expected, and a pretty nice beer, actually. A good seasonal."
"D - Good drinkability. High Falls with a poor mans Anchor Christmas...kind of."
"Overall Impression: There is a fair brown ale aspect that keeps it drinkable, but not festive"
"Didn't expect much here, it well exceeded my expectations. Worth the $6.99/6pack, I think I'll pick up another one."
"Drinkability: Not an overly drinkable beer IMO. Good easy drinking beer is on thing which I have liked about JW Dundee beers. One is enough for me."
"Overall, a decent beer, but i wouldnt want more than one of these. For a winter warmer i wished it had more flavor as my notes here really struggled to pull those out."
"A interesting but conflicted winter ale."
"This was on sale for $5.49 for a six pack. They probably figure that since it's well into January they want to get rid of their Christmasy stuff. It's deep brownish/amber with a nice light brown head. I think it smells good. Sweet with a molasses-like aroma and some sort of spice I can't really put my finger on. I sense it in the taste also. Almost like a bitter orange peel type flavor/smell. It's bittersweet and thick. Leaves a somewhat bitter aftertaste. Some alcohol warmth is there... not much. Not bad. A couple of these beers will suffice on any given night. I'd have a couple then switch to something lighter. I'll get more if it's still that cheap next time I go to that store."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light with medium carbonation--really a bit thin. Some more malts with unfermentable sugars would be a nice addition to this one, sweeten it up a little and give it some body and head retention. I would pass on this one in the future."
"This beer is a good sipper, but I also think it would pair well with smoked turkey or maybe even duck. Very drinkable and a rather pleasant entry into the Winter brew genre."
"The Dundee's line is surprisingly good for the price. I haven't paid under $5 for a craft micro sixer since the early 90s. Better than many more that are twice or three times as expensive."
"A nice surprise and one that I'll have to seek out again."
"woo... is lightly spiced... the taste and mouth is Muddled but does show some promise, ..maybe ... medium head on the pour ... lacing is actually damn fine!! ..does carry some strange aroma's... basically...""weak!"" ...Is nice for a winter warmer not to be over spiced but that lack of body hurts this brew..."
"This beer is just slightly lacking in many catagories. It has decent flavors and auroma, but it just comes off as being slightly watery."
"Wow, this beer surprised me. Much better than expected. Pours a beatiful amber with a tinge of red. The scent is oaky, malty with some definite spices. It has a creamy, malty flavor that finishes with spices and alcohol. I thought it could have used more spices to mask the alcohol and the palate is a bit filmy. Otherwise, I really enjoyed this."
"The beer released from the 12-ounce bottle set a deep reddish amber with a tall creamy off white head that stays a while before settling, lace forms a standard thin sheet upon the glass. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, chased up your olfactory opening by some pleasing spices; cinnamon seems to be right, caramel, and bit of bakers chocolate, at any rate a sniffable beer. Start has a big malt sweetness; touch of bittersweet spices, top is light to medium in feel. Finish as a delectable spicy hop presence, sweet spices and a purposeful acidity, quite a nice drinking beer, do not normally care for their beers, just goes to show you never know what mollusk has a pearl in it. lol"
"Bottled 257/06 - sampled 6/04/07"
"This would be a very good brew if it had a bit more malt ""weight"". As it is, an easy to drink and tasty winter spiced beer, but forgettable."
"($5.99 / 6-pack)"
"D: Overall pretty drinkable. Goes well with hearty soups and stews. Enjoyable, but nothing special."
"Picked up the 6-pack at Total Wine. Nice looking bottle with a silver printed label. Poured a beautiful brown color, nice clarity and puffy off white head. Good lacing throughout. Fruity smell, lots of sugars and some spice. Taste is very similar, very sugary with some malt and spices, nutmeg. The aftertaste has some alcohol tones, but nice, sits well on the tongue. This is a nice beer, not a disappointment and glad to have tried. Not on the same level as a SN Celebration, but a good beer nonetheless."
"Continuation of completing my holiday/winter ales during the great Feb/March storms of '07. Thanks JB."
"This brew tastes very much like the backbone of a lot of pumpkin ales, without the pumpkin. Very drinkable. No overwhelming characteristics and one for the holidays that will not offend the most fragile drinker of beer."
"Not really that crazy about this one and usually I really like spiced beers. I guess Ive just had so many other Holiday spiced beers lately and most have been of a better quality. The spices in this one have an astringent bitterness to them, and even though many spiced brews have this character this one lacks a sufficiently firm malty sweetness to balance. Still, its not totally undrinkable, I certainly didnt have too hard a time sucking this one back. Its just that there are much better examples of this kind of thing out there"
"12oz brown bottle from Lou's. Translucent red body with about an inch of off-white head. Biscuit malt and nut dominate the aroma with hints of frutiness. Nut and roasty caramel malt dominate the flavor, with suggestions of spice. Creamy medium body. While not the best winter beer I've had, a really good one, and exceeded my expectations considering the brand and brewery."
"Drinkability - nothing spectacular but certainly tasty and easy to drink."
"6.3% ABV. Clear mahogany liquid, with some shades of ruby. Thick fluffy off-white head quickly settles to a thin layer. Hints of candied fruit, spices (nutmeg, cinnamon), earthy and a bit soapy in the nose. First sip seems metallic and medicinal. A bit of darker caramel flavor, with earthy spices. Some earthy and floral bitterness, which helps to keep the spices in check. Seems thin and watery. Not bad, but not something I would go out of my way for."
"Pours an amber color with excellent head retention. Spice smell is fortunately not overpowering nor is the spice taste in the ale itself. The brewer practiced moderation in the spices used which, to my mind, made the beer rate very highly on the drinkability chart. I'm not usually a fan of spiced beers but this one is an exception and I'll be making some repeat purchases. Probably the first time I've said that about a spiced beer."
"This was better than I expected. I have tried most of the Dundee's beers and most of them are average. This one is a beer I would seek out again. The malty nose and frothy, tan head start this beer off right. The taste is a biscuit and toast blend with barely any noticeable hops. Mouthfeel is a bit sticky; a trait I find in all beers from this line. Drinkability is good. I will look for this again."
"Drinkability is perfect. Nicely done, especially at $16.99 a case of 24."
"Overall a nice drinkable macro winter warmer. Could have used a bit more variety in the flavor, but generally pretty good."
"Crystal clear orange-copper. Tan head. Average retention and lacing. Caramel and fruit in the nose with just a hint of spice (cinnamon?). Standard body and carb. There's more clove and nutmeg in the flavor, but overall the spicing is very well done. Nice maltiness. Good balance. The spice never really gets cloying although it's clearly there! A very decent holiday spice beer. If I see it I'll grab a sixer or twelve pack or Xmas dinner."
"D- Hey why not."
"Hot damn $4.99 a six pack cant beat that with a stick,a real nice pour a deep amber/ruby color with a tight formed 1/2 finger beige head.Big caramel notes in the nose with some buttery tones and hints of honey and nutmeg,a beer on the sweeter side alot of caramel and brown sugar flavors with just a hint of mulling spice it doesnt really come out strong just a light clove and nutmeg flavor.It does get a bit cloying after awhile but its a good dessert beer it went well with some of my wives pumpkin cheese cake.I would buy again for the price but I wouldnt pay much more for it."
"Overall impression: Nicely balanced, the spice is not overdone. Certainly not my favorite winter beer, but for the price a nice offering."
"Pours a nice rich amber brown. One finger tan head,with very good retention, and lacing. Smell is of sugary malts. Body is thin to medium, and carbonated. Taste is of spiced malt with a bit of honey. Warmed nicely at the finish. This was a good beer. I recommend giving it a try."
"Drinks easy for the abv, a little thin for a winter warmer, but probably one of the better beers you can pick up for $5.50 a sixer"
"Was part of a mixed 12 pack that my dad bought. This was the first one I had out of the pack and it was pretty darn good. A brown tinted red with a white top. Smell of spice is very light, some cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, maybe even some mace. There is a solid nutty malt body to it. This beer deserves some praise for the restriant not to spuice the shit out of a nice subtle beer. The spices are part of the beer and the malt character still shines through although it does have a little too much of a crystal malt taste. I like the mouthfeel and think this is another sessionable winter suprise anytime."
"D - medium to high, another good dundee brew from High Falls"
"Overall, not bad for a cheaper beer, but theres other stuff Id rather drink."
"A decent beer and cheap, fairly well balanced, expecially if you like banana in your beer."
"Limited edition ale part of a mixed 12 pack I picked up at Green's in Columbia, SC. Pours a dark ruby red with a nice thick head. Good malty aroma with just a hint of spice. As with the other reviewers, the spice level is somewhat muted, but is definitely present. The specific spices are hard to detect but I sensed a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and maybe allspice. Not a bad brew at all and it hides its 6.3 ABV well. How did it such a strong brew get through the beer cops in SC?"
"Drinkability was good. This would be a very good beer if you could find it. I have to bear the Honey Brown to have it around these parts, but it would work in a six pack. I'd get it again if I could find it that way."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, yet malty scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts. There is a faint hint of spice, but it's too hard to tell what it is. The taste is average. It has an extremely dry flavor that goes down slow and finishes dry and earthy. I guess the spices are cinnamon and clove, but I'm not sure. It's quite peppery. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a real disappointment. I don't like the dry element. It's one and done for me."
"Limited edition beer that came in a JW Dundee's 12 pack. Cool fancy metallic looking clear sticker label. This poured a really nice orange amber color with a nice creamy tan head. The body is quite carbonated. Mmmm. The aroma is of caramel and sweet roasted malt. Thought i smelled some clove or pear in there. Not sure though. Prominent in the taste is the roasted malts, it is so warm and happy. To accent that we have some mild holidayish spices and enough hoppiness to provide a mild bite. The alcohol is not noticeable, and at 6.3abv that is pretty damn cool. Very pleasant beer to get you in the holiday mood but not a work of art. Drinkable as hell. Holiday beers don't need to be hard to drink. Anyways, high falls is on a roll, and although i don't like this quite as much as the test bock they had on tap at local bars this is very nice. Very interesting brew. if there was a 6 pack of it i would get it."
