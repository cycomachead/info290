3.26,-11.9,4,3,3,4,3.5,"Out of a bomber this beer was a clear, dark copper color with some ruby highlights. The head was a towering cap of tan foam that left lacing as and retained. The aroma was of caramel malt, piney hops, some herbal notes, and a touch of leather and wood. The flavors were similar to the aroma, dominated by the hoppy elements but with the addition of some biscuity malt that came through one the dry finish. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation appropriate. An odd beer, only in that it was supposed to be a winter warmer but came off more like an IPA. If it had been sold in summer as an IPA I think I would have enjoyed it more","thekevlarkid","Mar 15, 2012"

The taste is very hoppy, consisting of citrus fruits and a modest astringency to it. It has a strong backing of caramel malts and some carafa. Its dark and smooth yet not too heavy as it looked quite thick. This is a unique and refreshing brew that I really enjoyed. I do however disagree that this is a winter warmer, It tastes 100% like a black IPA and nothing like a winter warmer. No complaints about that being that black IPA's are one of my favorite styles. This is a solid beer, very similar to their dads helper black IPA.","TwelveOunces","Mar 09, 2012"

3.88,4.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Draught @ Mikro: This one pours a hazy, ruby-coppery color. There was a tan head and some lacing from it. Lots of grapefruit hops up front to the nose. Some other citrus. Not much else making it through. The taste is more balanced. Grapefruit hops up front, with a medium malt body behind it.

Taste-wise, the beer opens up with rather aggressive hops, but quickly becomes more subdued, with more malt forward flavors. Hints of chocolate, roasted malt, and rich bread.

The nose comprises light roasted malts, very light leek, light grapefruit peel, and light mandarin orange. The taste holds notes of dark caramel, very light leek, flowers, light-ish greens, and grass. Tastes sorta like a salad whose dressing has gone downhill slightly... The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish.

We/I recently postulated on the pairing of Girl Scout cookies and beer and this would either be like gilding the lily to the Thin Mints or a perfect accompaniment. It was medium-bodied, but it had a beautiful marriage of chocolate/coffee malt and wintergreen hops on the tongue. Gott dang! It suddenly struck me as more of a dessert beer, like in lieu of a Grasshopper, but samey same. OMFG, I would totally lay this on a lotta people that claim not to like "hoppy" beers.

Interesting and enticing for the hop lover. The flavor brings lots more of the bitter hop theme with some brown bread highlights and a cool evergreen refreshment. It's fairly effervescent with a medium light body and nearly resinous feel. This sure does not come off as your typical winter warmer but it's hard to pin down, maybe a simple IPA. Fair drinkability but I would probably prefer a Hop Stoopid. Still, very decent for the hop head.","Durge","Jan 22, 2011"

Although I can't attest to this being one of their finest samples, it was a solid stab at the style nonetheless. Somewhere in between a Black IPA and a Winter Warmer; although the genre is somewhat vague, it still asserts itself as an ideal Winter-time brew.","dsa7783","Beers"

Something about this beer reminds me of Christmas and Santa Claus. I cannot explain that. It's possible that's because it's along the same lines as SN Celebration or Rogue Santa's Private Reserve.

3.56,-3.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D- Hard to gauge since the ABV is unlisted. A bitter ale that doesn't seem to pack too much depth. That being said, it is smooth and drinks nicely.","david131","Dec 27, 2009"

4.05,9.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Dark amber body, nearly opaque, cloudy, after warming discovered this wasn't chill haze. 1 finger tan head, medium dissipation with decent lacing. The nose is bready malts, a bit of spice (cardamon?), chocolate, coffee and very complex hop profile which is hard to deconstruct. Taste is primarily coffee, chocolate, bitter hops with a bit of plum-like sweetness, and a pretty dry finish. Great mouthfeel, nicely carbonated, not too syrupy. Not sessionable but a nice holiday ale. Well worth a try.","jdense","Dec 21, 2009"
4.33,17,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This brew pours a dark amber,red colour and almost looks like brown creaming soda with a nice two finger foamy head and heaps of nice lacing around the glass,the aromas are coffee,herbal piney hops and a touch of kiwi fruit,it has a weighty mouthfeel although its just weighted nicely enough to easily have another sip after another with tastes of piney,herbal hops the first thing i taste followed by a nicely balanced middle body of caramel,toffee malts that really smooths out the tailend of this beer to make it not really that bitter as i was expecting with the 7 hops that they have used i was expecting a big bitter bomb right at the end but not at all and to be quite honest this has to be one of the best balanced beers that i have had and if you come across this brew i highly recommend you buy a few of them as im going back to my bottleshop tomorrow to buy more,definately a top class beer.","ADZA","Dec 20, 2009"

3.96,7,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"The name for this beer has been used multiple times by Rogue for other beers,this incarnation is quite good.Poured a rich muhogany with a creamy one fingered off-white head that never really settles.Crystal malt aromas really stick out,iron,lightly sweet biscuit,and some leafy hop, wich is quite subtle, linger.Caramel/vanilla malt flavors up front,a little toast as well,the hops come in leafy form,just a hint of citrus comes thru in a long finish.Near creamy mouthfeel makes it almost lush in the mouth,flavors wont blow ya away, but its a real nice winter offering.","oberon","Dec 15, 2009"
3.77,1.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"D: A great example of a winter warmer, though not the beer I needed to really sell me on the style completely. It's well balanced and refined, I just wish the bitterness of the taste was a little more subdued.","mmva321","Dec 13, 2009"

Starts with a bitter hop flavor that is quickly followed by a coffee and spice taste. Lingering roasted malty flavor. Decent mouth feel, a bit strongly carbonated. Pretty drinkable, might pick up another, but wouldn't go out of the way.","vkv822","Dec 12, 2009"

The smell is strong with cinnamon,alcohol,hops,and roasted malt. The taste is robust with roasted malt,dry hops,carmel,some holiday spices,and alcohol. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing pretty well. Not a bad beer,but you can find much better winter warmers out there.","jmz62565","Nov 26, 2009"
3.11,-15.9,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Makes it to above two fingers of dark tan hued foam, not dense enough to retain very long, however, leaves a formidable amount of lacing behind. Dark mahogany brown with rust reddish tinge, fully opaque haze, more burnt orange at the rims. Subdued nose of hard toffee, dark chocolate, roasted coffee and nutmeg, piney at times but without the sap, not much fruit, dense and lacking in movement. Medium to full-bodied, leverages its weight to impress even as, in the nose, sacrificing any sense of progression. Burnt wood notes, pine, caramelized brown sugar, dried maple syrup. There's not denying the hoppy bitterness right down the middle. Cinnamon spiced latte, cola bean, never really comes close to being sweet. No fruit, some white grapefruit pith. Grassiness elevates through the finish. Whereas many "winter warmer" beers play up the sweetness and try to stay cuddly and friendly, this take is definitely aggressive and forces you to take it on its own terms. Me, I could take it or leave it.","farrago","Beers"

4.3,16.2,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"On-tap at Woody's City Market served a dark amber almost brown with a decent light-tan head. Aroma is pine hops and burnt caramel. The taste is a nice blend of burnt caramel, burnt toast, and bitter pine hops, paired with that distinctive Pacman yeast characteristic, this is a very tasty brew. The beer is medium bodied with smooth carbonation. I must admit, being from North Carolina I hold all Winter Warmers to the standard set by Highland Cold Mountain Winter, and while the style had a wide range, this one is likely the best on I've had that's on the hoppy side!","atsprings","Nov 19, 2009"
