There’s is a bizarre candy like note as well, that calls to mind smarties or bubble gum. There’s a compliment of chocolate and slightly smoke notes buried deeply in the background.  On the palate it starts out smooth, but incredibly light, and grows increasingly carbonated throughout.  The flavors channel more pine like hop notes, overcooked caramel, a subtly biscuit like nature.  On the finish the hops actually pick up and compliment a burnt caramel flavor, leaving a slightly bitter note.","TastyFoodAndDrink","Nov 28, 2014"

4.14,24.3,4.25,4,4.25,4.25,4,"I went with an aggro pour since nothing on the label suggested doing otherwise. There was an initial pseudo-cascade before I backed off, but I still ended up with three fingers of dense, rocky tawny head with good retention. Color was a deep-copper (SRM = > 17, < 22) with NE-quality clarity. Nose was very malty, kind of nutty with an underlying spiciness like nutmeg. Believe it or not, I actually prefer drinking these kinds of beers when the temperature warms up. I truly prefer this sort of thing to most Hefeweizens, for instance. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full and the inherent heat in this one was immediately obvious on the tongue. Phew! Once the initial burn abated, I got flavors of dried dark fruits, spices and a bit of molasses. Finish was dry as a bone, rather hot, even after six months, giving greater weight to my waiting to drink it. I want to try this again in the Winter, just to see what it is like fresh, but this was quite good.","woodychandler","Jun 23, 2014"

3.68,10.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 3/18/2014. Pours fairly crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, light nuttiness, light roast, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and light-moderate yeast fruitiness; with solid strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, fig, light roast, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, light roast, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Nice robustness and complexity of big dark/bready malt and light-moderate yeast fruitiness; with minimal cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, smooth, and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice English strong ale. Big robustness and nice complexity of dark/bready malt and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jun 19, 2014"

This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth, a little rich, a little filling, and the taste didn't do a good job of holding my attention and I quickly got bored with it, so one is enough for me, I have no urge to drink another one in a row. What I liked the most about this beer was the appearance, it was nice and it was the aspect with the least amount of things wrong with it. What I liked the least about this beer was how it isn't true to style, I haven't had a Winter Warmer that tasted this bland. I wouldn't buy this beer again, it's not very hard to find a much better Winter Warmer and I wouldn't recommend this beer to any of my friends. All in all this beer just wasn't for me, it didn't really live up to being called a Winter Warmer. This one is up there as one of me least favorite Flying Dog beers, better luck next time guys, this one needs some major work.","StoutHunter","Jan 03, 2014"

The retention was ok at first but it soon was little more than a needle-thin collar that left only a few small spots of lacing. The aroma was of caramel malt, toffee and a hint of floral hops. The flavors were of caramel malt, toffee, diacetyl, nuts, toasted malt, burnt toast and then a finish which was a bit to herbal/medicinal and didn’t quite balance out properly. Distinctly bitter on the finish but it wasn’t a ‘clean’ finish. The mouthfeel was frothy and slick, the body medium and the carbonation a bit high.

Aroma is that of dark roasted malt with a deep note of chocolate licorice and crisp floral hops. Deep toasted malt dominates the palate here, for the most part, with a well suited carbonation that lets the flavor dominate. Notes of sweet dark cocoa and toasted nut come through to me and there's a subtle hop bitterness throughout that restrains the malt feel to a favorable level. Overall, this is one of the more boozy "winter warmers" I've ever tried but as the brew nears closer to room temperature from the fridge climate, the alcohol feel truly does seem to subside and a nice caramel note begins to break through on the palate.","albertjr21","May 24, 2011"

Tasting it, I pick up some chocolate flavors that compliment some of the roasty-sweetness fairly nicely and some very faint hops add bitterness and keep the alcohol from entering in too strongly from the equation. You don't really taste the alcohol, but you do notice its warmth and it bites a bit along with the light hops. It makes an impact on your mouth, and I'd be wrong to call this brew "smooth." It's forceful which sort of makes it hard to appreciate the texture of this one. Overall, it makes for an okay winter ale, but misses out on some of the fun "wintery" things that one tends to look for in the style.","clarkkr","Mar 31, 2011"

The taste brings out the bitterest notes possible from these elements, ranging from the white part of the orange peel to an astringently charred biscuit. Honestly, this comes off as just too much bitterness in a bad way for anything good to really come of it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, not my cup o' tea (so to speak), thanks to all that crappiness on the tongue.","TMoney2591","Mar 11, 2011"

Flavor is all over the place, not sure what FD was going for here. A big hit of booze right up front, next is hops, and finally a very faint spice flavor. Almost has an effect of eating dry nutmeg, and then taking a shot of cheap whiskey. My experiences with Flying Dog have been very good prior to this. Very disappointing. Tastes like Leinenkugel's beers, just cheap and fake. Thin and fizzy. So much for mouthfeel. Feel like I downgraded after tasting so many good beers.

I give it some time to settle and warm before my first sip that ellicits a caramel malty sweetness that gives way to a hop bite. Well balanced and less alcohol here than in the nose.

Light aroma of roasted barley, caramel, and floral hops in the background. Pale Munich malt sweetness upfront, followed by heavy dextrins, dark crystal sweetness, toasty Vienna, and finally sharp Pilsener malt flavor. Drying aftertaste with some malty notes sticking around, fruity ale character and an american hop citrus/grapefruit flavor is slight but noticeable. Balanced flavor with a respectable malt profile. Ample dextrins give some texture to the mouthfeel, filling in the gaps and making the light-medium mouthfeel seem full. Lighter carbonation allows the minimal residual sugars and slightly tannic malt to settle in, while the fruity hop profile dries the palate. Finishes mildly roasty with a faint herbal hop bitterness, "HI-C" fruit flavor, and grainy astringency. The overall character seems good but restained; might be fanatastic if it were toned up a little.","PBRstreetgang","Feb 07, 2007"

A little yeasty tartness, a little sweet, and some caramel notes too. A noticeable alcohol presence is a tad too much for me and considering the abv for its style is on the low end. Some of the alcohol retreats as it warms allowing its other characters to come to the forefront. Medium mouthfeel and some creaminess at the end is pretty nice.","cabsandking","Jan 27, 2007"

Fairly drinkable, at least it is light enough for that, and it only coats the mouth lightly as it passes down my gullet. As the beer warms a bit a certain creaminess comes to the body of this beer. Sweet, richly caramelized malt notes lean towards fruity notes of raisins and even a touch of cherry, but both fruits have been lightly burnt and concentrated under a nice hot broiler. A touch of roasted grain character leaves a light burnt note that lingers on in the throat after the sip, yet still the concentrated sweet malt notes dominate the long finish. This certainly has some hop components to the flavor profile as well; notes of sweet tinged herbs intermingle with a light citrus character and a lingering bitterness. This is a nice beer, for some reason it reminds me of a slightly smaller version of Deschutes Jubelale, which seems to strike the winter warmer profile a bit better than this beer does.","Gueuzedude","Nov 05, 2006"

Definitely tangy on the tongue, even a bit tart/sour right away, but there's some rich, dark malt way out in left field keeping the whole act together. This is very smooth and easy drinking for a bigger beer (is it really 7.4%?), in fact I've enjoyed K-9 Cruiser on several occasions in the past but never realized it was this strong. In that sense (and maybe given the fact that I poured this at fridge temperature) it seems thin for the style, but it doesn't exhibit any lack of the character I'd expect from a robust winter seasonal apart from this perceived thin-ness. Really takes on another character as it warms up, revealing that rich malt character I mentioned earlier. I've enjoyed this beer in the past, and this time with some curried rice - the beer's residual sweetness complemented the spice/heat of the curry quite well. Gotta add a couple of last observations: great balance here between hops and malt, it's subtle here but far from uninspired, and the K-9 recipe has maintained a commendable degree of consistency in a climate favoring hopbombs and Imperial renditions of every style - kudos to Flying Dog on that!","Chaz","Oct 13, 2006"

In the mouth it comes across thin at first, then at some point, it begins to get some weight to it, that lasts till the end. You can also feel the alchol at the end of each taste.

The taste is similarly muted; there are some sweet, dark fruits with a bit of an alcohol spike and a small toasted and slightly hoppy finish. As far as winter ales go, this isn't nearly as good as Goose Island's or Big Sky's, and the only other American Strong Ale I've had, Nosferatu, outclasses this easily.

Some areas of thin, tiny-spotted lace appear on the glass with each sip, but never seem to be able to hold. The body is medium and its fine-bubbled and moderate carbonation leaves it lightly creamy and silky smooth. The flavor is similar to that of it's Munich malt like graininess with a dollop of caramel, but it's nowhere as rich as it suggests. It is balanced nicely, however, with a touch of yeasty fruitiness and some light, citrusy hops; all backed by a firm bitterness.

Combination of damp floral Goldings hop nose and mild bubblegum esters are followed by very assertive diacetyl that almost takes on a cheesy character. Biscuit malt and generic dark caramel sweetness persist as an undertone in aroma. Subdued chocolate malt manages to couple well with the prominent butterscotch and prevents the diacetyl from becoming offputting. The flavor profile is comprised of light roasted barley bitterness, sweetness derived from crystal malt lightly contrasted by low hop bitterness. The expectedly strong diacetyl emerges towards the end of the sip. Like the aroma, the chocolate malt offsets the butterscotch presence adequately, and prevents it from being overbearing. Lightly bodied, w/ a somewhat watery mouthfeel. Finishes sweet w/ biscuity notes lingering. K-9 is an odd, eccentric brew. It's not particularly well balanced, mostly due to the strong diacetyl that borderlines on being akin to rancid butter. The drinkabilty is decent considering the strength. It's not a beer I'll have in the forseeable future, however. This beer, in its bottled form, appears to be inconsistent, but it is never well rounded.","marc77","Sep 03, 2002"
