3.8,-3.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.75,"Not as syrupy sweet or hyper-spiced as most winter warmers.  The malty Carmel taste is refreshing at first, with a slightly bitter, hoppy finish.  This one has a mild skunk at the end, probably because it almost Easter and a bit late for a winter warmer.  Of course the high today was in the mid- 20's and this is warming me up nicely.","DDiFran","Mar 28, 2015"

Underlying malt smells of some light chocolate. As it warms, the chocolate & caramel aromas really shine through and come to he forefront. Tastes of sweet caramel malts with some chocolate & cocoa. Upfront spiciness - not sure from hops or actual spices. Medium high bitterness. Feels medium full to full with no hot alcohols. Overall, a nice malty beer for the cold winter nights.

Bit more going on with the taste as there is some semi-sweet chocolate and pine in the mix as well. Does have a bitter finish that lasted a little to long for my liking though. Other than that the taste was decent. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation.","BeerWithMike","Dec 16, 2014"

Basically, if you are in the mood for something like Stone's Oaked Arrogant Bastard but favor a bit of holiday cheer stirred in; this is the beer for you.  I'll have this again; and it doesn't have to be just at the Winter holidays.","Tucquan","Dec 15, 2014"

Less than a finger's worth of rich fluffy densely packed froth that is khaki in color with a slight reddish hue...  Decent retention gives way to a full film of lacing of much the same...  The color is a slightly murky light to medium brown...  A slight bit of moderate paced carbonation throughout...  The nose is comprised of light maraschino cherries, light caramel, cinnamon, and a light woody character...  It's a unique but pleasing combination...  Starts mellow and slightly sweet as the nose alluded to...  Next comes a prominent earthy character... Finally, there is a light charred character that rises on the finish...  Medium bodied...  Crisp...  Some sharp carbonation...  Finishes a touch dry with a bit of chalkiness...  A decent Winter Warmer all the way around...  Not my favorite Deschutes offering...  It may take a few more to truly experience this one as intended, but I'm confident I'll get there...","philbe311","Dec 03, 2014"

I have a feeling it would even be pretty nice 5-6 months from now as the hops fade a touch (my bottle was super fresh), letting the complex malts shine even more.

I'd personally have preferred something with more spice emphasis and less floral-pine influence, though I am an admitted malthead. The body seemed a touch on the light side for a winter beer, and I'd also have liked the malt to be less toasted bitter, to allow more sweetness in. Still, not a bad beer.","UrbanCaveman","Oct 14, 2014"

Flavor reveals deeply toasted caramel malt at the base, toasted enough to lend bitterness, along with notes of chocolate and specialty malt fruitiness. Bittering hops round out the flavor profile. More bitter than most winter warmers. The spices are fairly subtle, with just a hint of ginger surfacing. A welcome change of pace, though I wish it were a tad less bitter. There's a metallic character that surfaces.","barczar","Oct 10, 2014"

Not bad, still not that great compared to many of the other Deschutes beers, but still good.","jlindros","Mar 28, 2014"

4,1.8,3.75,3.75,4.25,3.75,4,"Thanks to Beer Revolution in Cowtown for bringing in some nifty Deschutes brews of late. The holiday seasonal from this brewery (or maybe its just a winter seasonal) is a dark reddish brown with a decent amount of tan foam. Aroma was a pleasant surprise, lemon-lime hops first (of all things) followed by a more expected sweet caramel malt. Dark and fruity at the same time. Tastes of treacle toffee, chocolate syrup, brown bread crust, green coffee beans, citrus rind, bubblegum, stone fruit, red berries ... A barrage of dark malt and sweet fruity flavors that co-exist in a tasty congress of the unexpected. Booze is detectable and becomes more so as one proceeds through a pint. Light-bodied and very smooth with middling carbonation, featuring a long roasted finish accented by medicinal hops and gooseberry notes. Really quite unique. How can toffee also taste zesty and refreshing? You can read in several reputable sources that dark malts and assertive hops typically mesh about as well as the Greeks and the Turks on Cyprus, but in all honesty I think this is a myth ... Done right, one gets some tasty results.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 11, 2014"

Started with a lush beige foam that slowly reduced to a thick cap that left sheets of sticky lacing on the glass. Sweet, sugary caramel malt aromas with  hints of freshly milled grains, dark fruit and chocolate. Full bodied with rich, gentle carbonation. Rich, sweet, caramel malt flavors up front with slowly emerging, earthy hop bitterness through the middle. Hop flavors transition to light coffee flavors as the bitterness fades to chocolate notes at the end. Finishes with a light, earthy, bitterness and a hint of alcohol. Sweet and malty that is tempered nicely with lazy hop flavors through the middle.","IronLover","Jan 14, 2014"

The only flaw I detect this year is a hint of diacetyl in the aroma (not in the flavor, though). An excellent brew.","PetitChouffe","Dec 03, 2013"

The head isn't super thick and just barely hangs around enough for you to finish the brew but the lacing isn't bad considering a real lack of head. The color might remind some of iced tea, but I think it's kind of nice considering the time of year its consumed. Some might say it appears like iced tea others along the lines of a single malt scotch, either way I like it. The scent is really nice. You get a layer of malt, caramel, spices, and hops but no one thing is overpowering. Now the mouth feel is just perfect! Kind of creamy but all very very pleasant and it all adds to incredible drinkability. The taste is full of flavor and it all seems to work in "waves". First thing you get is some malt, followed by some great floral spices maybe (cinnamon?) I even got very very very... subtle notes of chocolate. In the end you get a little "baby punch" of hops, which was kind of a pleasant surprise. Guys, this is not a "hoppy" beer but they come out in the end. All very very smooth and extremely pleasant. Anyone can enjoy this as it's subtle enough for a newbie, but complex enough for the beer snob. Deschutes hit this one out of the park!","Khad","Nov 13, 2013"

Scents of fruity esters, spiciness, citrus pith, some pine, slight funk, overripe fruit and some apricot sweetness. A good aroma, quite sweet and fruity, with a bit of a citrus hop aroma. Flavor is citrus pith and pine resin bitterness, balanced by banana, tropical fruit, a caramel malt backbone and fruity and overripe fruit flavors. It's quite sweet and fruity, but with enough West Coast hop bitterness to balance it. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, with moderate carbonation and a smooth creamy mouthfeel. Quite nice to drink. Overall this is a good beer. It's got a nice balance of sweet fruit and bitter hops to keep it from being cloying like many winter warmer and it has enough complexity to make it interesting.","Auraan","Nov 08, 2013"

Smells very malty, jammy, and of dark, candied fruit; kind of like fruitcake, now that I think about it. Flavor brings a bit more choco-mocha to it along with dark fruit, and a little wine-like strawberry element. Mouthfeel is pretty solid, somewhere between medium and heavy bodied, but this isn't a huge beer. ABV comes in a bit below a 7, and for the style I think it should achieve at least a 7, but I'm not making the rules here. Overall, very good winter warmer, good representation of the style, and a good offering from Deschutes.","BeerWizard","Nov 05, 2013"

Much more of a smoke flavor than i would like to see from what appears to be a red ale. Where's the hops? Kinda disappointed in the lack of hops in this one. Needs more coffee or caramel to balance with that intense smokey flavor. I do like the mouthfeel, nice. Bubbly and light. The finish again lacks with a fairly watery smoke flavor.

Delicious velvety bittersweet chocolate with a very subtle hint of coffee, then toffee and subtle caramel malt, touch of dark fruits, crisp hops! a hint of bubble gum in there. Finishes a little crisp hoppy and roasty, kind of bittersweet chocolate. Medium-bodied, crisp and full mouthfeel. A great winter session or night cap. Doesn't seem like much of a typical spiced Winter Warmer to me, but sure has a lot of great flavors that I want in a winter beer.","evanforbeer","Jan 16, 2013"

Opens with caramel joined by varied fruit notes including dried apricot, a hint of fig, prune, and add accents of date. Apple and pearskin also present. A hint of bitter citrus cuts through, fairly dry finish with slight chocolate notes. Warming alcohol becomes more evident as the brew warms. The heavier side of medium-bodied, smooth, hint of syrup on the edges, moderate carbonation. One of my favorite winter warmers.

3.61,-8.1,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Pour a clear, deep red bordering on brown with a finger of dense, creamy tan head. This smells more like a red, as I get mostly caramel with some savory spices. Hops are citrusy, slightly piney, and mild in intensity. Flavor is also mainly caramel with some burnt/bakers chocolate. There is some cinnamon or clove spiciness and piney hop bitterness on the back end. Bitterness is pretty significant. The feel is appropriate for the style, but I feel it's a little thicker than normal because of the nitro tap. Finish is mostly balanced but slightly dry. This is a nice winter warmer in the sense that I get some spices, but it's not crazy. Feels festive but it's not overbearing. Would like to try it on regular tap or bottle for comparison.","Philousa","Dec 10, 2012"

It has a medium body with good carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. This is a pretty excellent winter warmer.

There was a gentle lacing with very little head to speak of. As you drink, the lacing stays on the side of the glass (almost like a Christmas ornament). Aroma was spicy, with red fruits. It has a pretty sweet note to it. Tasted almost like an abbey ale at first. Lots of character and no real surprises after the smell. It’s warming and drinkable with heavy fruits (cherry) and minimal alcohol burn. Almost spicy. Very crisp and drinkable with a lot of carbonation. There is a small bland aftertaste, but it’s not that bad. Overall it’s a very drinkable, very festive beer. If it’s available and you’re feeling in the mood, pick one up.","Smurf2055","Jan 29, 2012"

Aroma is nice, but kind of weird. Billed as a "festive winter ale" this beer's aroma has a bit of caramel, but is overwhelmed by a lot of citrusey hops. This feels to me like a hopped up scotch ale. The flavor gives me the same impression. There is some of the smooth caramel malty fullness that I would expect from a winter warmer, moreso than in the aroma, but there is still a big hop presence. I think that while this is nice, the big hop presence clashes a bit with the malt bill that they are going with here. This beer is definitely interesting, but I think it would benefit from a less aggressive hopping schedule.","Agold","Jan 05, 2012"

The aroma has a rich mix of sweet toffee with light cinnamon spice and cherry-apple fruit. The flavor is dry and finishes about as hoppy as any winter warmer I've tried. There's a cutting citrus in the finish, rolling over toasty, bready grains. The initial smooth fruit esters are a pleasant contrast to the bitter finish, though not until the beer warms up.

The beer had a wonderful taste like something akin to a beer version of hot cider only cold.

In the taste, robustly malty leaving a strong impression of chocolate. Somewhat sweet, as there is little in the way of hop bitterness. Nice dry cocoa flavor and very light spice notes.

Nose is fairly hop-forward, a bit of malt heft, reminds me of an aggressively hopped American style barley wine. This might actually be the first "Winter Warmer" I've ever had, wow. Flavor is strangely dry, very welcoming in that way. Pine cone and forest floor are the hop qualities, but they are very nicely tempered. A faint sap-like quality. I really enjoy the perfect attenuation here. Fairly thin feel. Way better than I expected.","JAXSON","Jun 17, 2011"

I'm also picking up hints of cherry, raisin, plum and grape. Complex but a bit too heavy on the spices for my liking.

The bitterness balances out the sweet, chocolatety malt. Some fruity esters add a level of complexity. Alcohol is felt and adds some warmth.

Mouthfeel is crisp with a long hoppy aftertaste. This is a fairly hoppy ale, but balanced by rich sweet dark malts- how they make feel so light is beyond me. It's that note of fruit though, that makes this a winter holiday beer, though otherwise it would still be a pretty good hoppy brown ale.

Alcohol is evident but not overtly so and not harsh, bringing with it the faintly whiskey-rum elements, and spicey, warm raisiny alcohol that blend well with the rest.

I am a hophead for sure but this tasted like it should have been more balanced. The hops have a very leafy, earthy taste to them which I didn't think meshed well with the style. Could have been more creamy, malty and complex like last years. Maybe it was too fresh, it could mellow so much more with a few months on it. Honestly this beer tasted like an American amber ale.

3.7,-5.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured into straight pint glass. Poured with a 1 inch head, however there was sufficient carbonation for a bigger head if desired. Head was an attractive tan color. Head dissapated quickly, leaving a nice lace. Bold, spicy aroma that is very pleasing. Flavor matches aroma well, with a lingering roasty, spicy bite on the back of the tongue. Slightly thinner body than the style should have. Very drinkable. If you like a slightly stronger beer for a session this would work well. Another strong entry from a strong brewery.","beertunes","Dec 31, 2008"

Tastes of spicy hops right up front followed by sweetness of caramel and brown sugar, overripe bananas, chocolate, nutmeg, and a hint of cinnamon. Strong bready backbone with some nut notes along with a slight chalkiness and soy sauce bitterness towards the back end with a finish of ginger, bitter woodsy hops, and a touch of alcohol warmth.

The nose is delicous roasted malts with a mild amount of spice and toasted nuts. The taste is very similar to the nose minus the toasted nuts. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than many others in the genre, but so is the abv. I would say it is on the light side of medium body.

Clean malty aroma with caramel, a little hops and a hint of banana. Nice full flavor of roasted malt and bitter hops with a good lingering bitter aftertaste. This is not as spicy as some of the other winter beers, but that is fine with me. Medium bodied with a strong carbonation and slightly alcoholic finish. This is one I am always sure to buy come December. Great by a warm fire or paired with holiday main courses.","walshclimb","Dec 01, 2008"

It smells of chocolatey malt and holiday spices, but it's a tad weak. The taste shows off these flavors better. I was most impressed that, while it tastes of winter spices, it doesn't try too hard or taste artificial at all. The flavor is blended into the beer far better than many holiday-time special ales. The feel is less watery than expected and holds up better than similar beers. I can definitely see enjoying a Jubelale or three on a cold December night. The label is quite arty, which I appreciate, but the artist perceives winter a bit different from me anyway. I like Deschutes Brewery.

Taste is a nice rich mix of flavors...up front is sort of a cherry and citric acid bite which falls off into more of a caramel and plum duff malt flavor. Gin-like juniper notes. Acidic hop bite sticks around and melds with a strong burnt character that i can't shake (even though i kind of want to). Thinner than i expected, though not watery.

Citrusy hops provided a contrast in the nose, with a bit of dried fruit and alcohol providing a warming depth. Same in the flavour, but it's more difficult to pick things apart. Solid bitterness throughout, quite balanced, with more prominent nut and cocoa at first, more alcohol warmth towards the end. There was a brief flash of mint too.

The head diminishes quickly and lurks on the surface all the way down the glass, leaving some heavy lacing. The smell is lightly hoppy with the bulk of aroma being malty, sweet, and smoky. There is also a hint of coffee in the smell that grabs your attention. The taste is definitely conveys a smoked malt flavor that reminds you of campfires in late fall. The smoked flavor also adds some bitterness to the beer, working with the hops to balance the strong malt bill. The mouthfeel is vicous with a carbonation level that is not too aggressive, letting the tongue taste everything there is to offer. The drinkability definitely lends itself to the weather.

There is also some noticeable bitterness in the finish, and I get nuances of cherry and apple. Abv. is pretty well disguised, but still this beer is fairly sweet and rich, so one is probably all I could do.

Smell is interesting, just a slight whiff and I get mainly a bread/earth smell which isnt too flattering however with a deep whiff I get a burst of hops which I do like. Taste is good. I'm having a hard time pinpointing it but a nice mix of chocolate, caramel, roasted grains, and a "burnt" taste. Very thick, creamy mouthfeel leaves a coffee like aftertaste.

The best way to taste the spice is by swishing the beer in your mouth...man, *that's* tasty. It has a medium mouthfeel and the carbonation is light to medium and it finishes with a mild bitter kick. Very easy to drink because, whilst having loads of flavour, it's just so darn smooth and drinkable. Jubelale has never failed to impress me over the years even though the recipe seems to change a tad every year. It's my favourite Winter Warmer and I could drink this all day/night long.

Roasted malts and various hops. Wow the taste is even better. A coffee-like bitterness appears along with that of the hops to counterweight the strong malt presence that reveals itself in the form of toffee, lightly sugared coffee, raisins and perhaps a hint of Gala apple. This is much better than what I remember of last year's version. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with the perfect amount of light carbonation.

Kind of like a sugary brown ale with some twang to it. It's crazy how well the hops balance this brew in taste. You get a sweetness from the malts that is followed by a stunted bitter taste, accompanied by spicy fruit flavors. I do think of the holidays when I drink this beer. Mouthfeel is spicy, sweet, and festive if you could say that about a beer. I enjoy the lingering flavors. Good drinkability for a Winter Ale.

Tastes more like a pale ale than a winter warmer. Assertive flavoring hops but not too much bittering. Nice but not what I was expecting. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy but then finishes a bit thin.

Man, does this brewery ever have some nice-looking bottles. I can't get over the raised/embossed hop vine detail on the glass. Anyway, my nonic fills up almost to the top with a glowing auburn red beer and a thick and frothy manilla head that has an ever-so-slight peach sheen to it. Did I say peach? That happens to also be the first scent I pick up in the bouquet, along with the zesty character of some slightly citric hops, an understated mineral water aroma, and a tiny bit of crystal malt sugariness. Clumpy, webby lacing is left as I sip what is at first a sweet and fruity mouthful. This juicy sweetness is soon muted by some ruggedly bitter hops, all piney and acrid, with a metallic grapefruit rind character dominating the finish. Juicy mouthfeel, full-bodied and dextrinous with a bit of stickiness. A hearty hop-filled winter ale that won't trip your trigger if your looking for a spiced beer, but certainly good for those who love hoppy bitterness balanced by a non-intrusive but capable malt sweetness.","orfeu","Jan 06, 2007"

I think its a little crisper this year and the hops are perhaps not as drowned out by the malt as last years batch.

Deschutes is a solidly competent brewery so I don't anything less than good beer for their winter seasonal. This one has very nice balance, with just enough hops to offset the sweet maltyness. The malt profile is complex, rich and grainy with a hint of toastiness and dried fruit. The hop character is clean and brisk with a mild woodsyness that lingers like slow stroll through the forest.

The aroma was predominately of sweet maltiness but it did include some hint of spices. The flavor was unexpected, and I wish I could give it a 4.75. It begins malty and as the beer finishes over the pallet with a bitterness and alcohol finish. Complex and full bodied, the beer retains a really high drinkability.

Taste is a wood-tinged maltfest, with the dark fruits and alcohol exploding onto the scene near the end of the tasting experience.

4.22,7.4,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Jubelale was served from a 12 oz. bottle, a straggler from the winter season. In a pint glass, the beer was an attractive hazy ruddy orange-brown color, and was topped by an fine, thin, and persistant off-white head that left nice sheets of lacing. The nose was rich and lively, with sharp and developed estery malts and notes of lemon-orange zest and subtle licourice. On the palate, a sharp roasty caramel-coffee malt profile opened, then became increasingly malty and orange-tinged in the transition to the creamy-roasted coffee finish. Robust bitterness was found evenly throughout, as well as a tad of alcohol. The body was quite smooth and full, working well with the flavors and character of this dark winter ale. This winter beer was fairly robust on the malt and hop fronts, yet was deftly balanced and not overly sweet, making it very drinkable. Jubelale is one of my favorite winter seasonals.","HiroProtagonist","Jul 07, 2004"

4.39,11.7,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Dumped from a decorative twelve ounce bottle into a pint glass, the body is mahogany and when held to the light becomes burgundy; the head is barely there, but what's here is barely a quarter inch tall, tan to off-white, leaves oily swirls on the brew's surface. Smell: rich, warm brown sugar, spiced fruits (raisins, plums, soaked in rum for days), sugar cookies, and the finish is like fresh melon rinds. Full, complex nose. Taste: opens with a bitter-sweet prick on the tip of my palate that folds back revealing a sweet (flat cola) and fruity (granny smith apples) edge; the finish is a grainy, crusty bitterness that emcompasses my entire palate, with a lingering background of subtle fruit sweetness. Alcohol is present in the warmth I feel in my stomach and throat. Mouthfeel: think whole milk, and just a dash of carbonation noticeable through the finish. I enjoyed this in season, a real winter warmer, and it's a treat even now that it's spring.","RootedFool","May 04, 2004"

4.25,8.1,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"It's been a while since I've been this surprised by the taste of a beer. This is some interesting stuff. There's a touch of coffee and some dark molasses, and the hops are evident without being at all intrusive. There's a pleasantly twangy bitterness and a slight smokiness. The most interesting thing, though, is the oily, thick, malty, viscous mouthfeel. Man, this is good. The finish has a delightful bitterness that's somewhere between woody and nutty, along with that beany/coffee bean flavor that's reminiscent of Perkuno's Hammer. Most of all it reminds me of Gilded Otter's Winter Wassail, but this is better executed.","Weissenheimer","Mar 09, 2004"
4.35,10.7,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Thanks to Alexgash for this one. Nice dark reddish brown with a nice khaki colored head. Smell is rich piney hops and spices, nutmeg, cinnimon, ginger?

A great celebration beer...to celebrate good skiing that is.","chaduvel","Mar 08, 2004"

3.93,0,4.5,4,4,3,4,"Clear ruby hue with a slight murk. One finger thick, steadfast, dense, light beige head leaves intricate lace. The aroma is a melange of mellow grapefruit and pine, with a spritz of festive spicy cinnamon and grainy, caramel drizzled whole grain bread. Remains unexpectedly static, with little change in profile as the beer breathes. Still, well rounded and stately aromawise. In flavor, the dominant malt suggestion is of dark, lightly singed toffee. Secondary are notes of overbaked rye cracker. Hop bitterness is moderate, and quells residual sweetness well, resulting in an overall dry flavor profile. Softens somewhat as the beer oxidizes, with subtle butterscotch and brittle notes superceding the evanescent burnt caramel tones. Hop flavor is of a mild pine sap and floral, noble esque combination. A touch meak in body, with a mouthfeel that could use additional viscosity. Finishes dry, but with lingering afterthoughts of red licorice, bitter cinnamon and graham crackers. A fairly complex and enjoyable brew, indeed. Jubeale could use more heft in body to support the bold, fermentation derived spice character, however. Regardless, it's very tasty and highly drinkable for a winter seasonal. Its ester profile is impressive.","marc77","Feb 04, 2004"

4.32,9.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"One good reason to come to Oregon during the winter season. I haven't a Jubilale for a few years and I was looking forward to having one. Winter 2003-04. It starts off with a big lingering head with plenty of lace. The color is dark amber with traces of ruby. The aroma is citrusy with a nice floral bouquet. As to the taste, It is citrusy (grapefruit) with a good blend of flavoring hops and caramel overtones and it is a little sweet. The mouthfeel is a bit doughy with a good hop bite. The finish is dry and bitter with some sweetness. At first this beer was too hoppy for my winter beer taste. However, it mellowed as it warmed up a bit. The malt characteristics became more prominent and balanced out the hops perfectly for my taste. Not a bad beer at all.","genaro","Jan 14, 2004"

Beautifuly fresh floral hop essences served against a backdrop of sweet maltiness. Hop notes are piney and fragrant. Maltiness smells of biscuit and caramel. To me, it seems like this strong ale is more about the hops than the malt. Not that that's wrong. It tastes good, but could use a little more caramel malt goodness. The hops are piney and fragrant. Bitter pine cones. Some spicy goodness includes hints of cinamon and orange peel. Just a hint of alcohol on the tongue. Body is approaching medium. Mouthfeel is delicate. This one's a winner.","Bighuge","Dec 13, 2003"

As it pours I get notes of raisin and roasty malt aromas, perhaps a hint of banana as well that might be a hop contribution (really hard to tell). There is quite a bit of fruity - spicy hops in the aroma that seems to have a candy coating. This beer is quite smooth, a finish that is reminiscent of rum. Quite good, complex. Has a finish that is of roast malt and an astringent / slightly alcoholic ending, as well as some balancing hop bitterness. Fruity notes of raisin and cherry are evident as well. A very well balanced beer with some hop character as well, some hop spiciness definitely hits my tongue, though it is subdued. The aroma is the best part of this beer, it is not quite perfect but it is close.","Gueuzedude","Nov 07, 2003"

3.67,-6.6,3.5,4,4,4,2.5,"2002 edition. Barely cloudy dark amber with hints of red, forming a thin yellow head despite a vigorous pour. Retention and lacing are OK. Aroma is of sweet rasins, brown sugar, fruity mild hops. Taste begins with herbal flavor hops, round amber malts with some earthiness, hints of dark fruit followed by moderately perceptable sharp alcohol and a sustained moderate earthen bitterness. Mouthfel is dry with a medium-dense body. The alcohol is pungent yet tolerable at cold temps and gets worse as it warms. Rough all over and a little ugly on the side.","Mitchster","Jun 17, 2003"

4.79,21.9,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"I poured the complete bottle, sediment and all, leaving a cloudy brown body beneath a thin layer of light tan foam. The head dropped shortly but maintained a decent collar throughout most of the glass. The nose is just astounding! Very unique! It displays a complex variety of fruits, sweet malt, and woody character that includes fresh-picked berries, soft baked-apple-pie, a slight hint of red pepper, dried apricots, tangerines, mushrooms, cocoa, cocoanut, dark caramel, toffee, fudge, a touch of smoke, some creamy coffee, and alot of oak. Whoah! The aroma in itself can be enjoyed throughout the good part of a night by the fire or as the sun sets and the sky comes alive with stars! This is truly a beer for all seasons. Impressive. The body is full/medium; and it's quite creamy and smooth across the palate with just a gentle caress on the tongue from the restrained, natural carbonation. Not surprisingly, some different flavors arise in the mouth. Previously unseen, soft prune rushes the stage; accompanied by a mild and sweet cherry, toasted cocoanut, dark toffee, light coffee and a nutty character that really develops in the long & complex finish along with some residual piney and grassy notes from the receeding hop flavors. It finishes dry with a very mild note of smoke, but no longer robustly bitter. This beer should soften and develop a bit more complexity over then next year or so, and then change as more cherry/sherry character develops for some time. Exceptional!","NeroFiddled","May 27, 2003"

The aroma is oranges, mild winter spiciness (whether it's added or not) and a light, sweet malt. The first sip is a shock at the amount of hop bitterness. The hops seem to float seperately from the rest of the beer which is a warm soft sweet maltiness. The hop bitterness fades as you get used to it but it still seems out of place and unbalances the beer.","aracauna","Jan 08, 2003"

Brandied fruit, ripe sugary plums and a prominent (sometimes fusel) alcohol, reveal themselves individually, then become integrated. The alcohol fires up the nostrils and throat with each swallow. Hops are reserved but adequate enough to provide the precise balance. Some hints of chocolate and molasses emerge as this lovely brew coats the palate. A big malty brew perfect for the winter months.
