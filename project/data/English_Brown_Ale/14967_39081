3.22,-15,4,2,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours with instant head that takes forever to settle. Hazy reddish brown color with a very dense 2 finger off white head with insane retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice thick soapy lacing on the glass, with a ton of carbonation streaming up. This is probably infected. Aromas of huge apple skins, caramel, molasses, toasted malt, bread, light chocolate, and light herbal hops. Way over the top apple notes makes finding anything else difficult. Taste of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, brown sugar, light herbal hops, and light fruitiness. No bitterness on the finish with lingering notes of chocolate, biscuit, caramel, toast, nuttiness, and light herbal on the finish for a good bit. Good balance of malty flavors with no cloying sweetness. Low noticeable infection traits in the flavor. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming after the finish noticed. Overall, despite the obvious infection, this was still a pretty tasty brown ale. Good balance of some pretty robust flavors, and quite easy to drink. I am sure this is a great beer without bugs in it.","superspak","Jun 06, 2012"

4.01,5.8,5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"My pour resulted in a finger of dense, medium-tan head with reasonable retention on a humid evening. Color was a deep garnet/ruby-red with NE-quality clarity. I am in love! Nose was VERY malty, more truth in advertising. The biscuit malt was definitely in the forefront, but with pecan undertones. I thought of Lazy Magnolia's Pecan Beer for a moment. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching creaminess, with the chocolate/raspberry flavors the immediate senses on the tongue, followed by a nuttiness that I had not achieved earlier. Wow! Not to be sexist, but this might have been the night to have CAPT Midnite (a counterperson at my local mini-mart who often gets to close at 0000) over for a drink. Man, but this was super sweet and certainly a dessert beer. Chicks seem to dig this sort of thing. Finish had a melange of nuttiness and raspberry, but the chocolate seemed to fade initially before making a reappearance on the extreme finish. Hoo! I may need some insulin after all of this sugar.

3.8,0.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Nice solid brown ale. Makes for a nice cool weather beer. If the earthiness was a bit toned down, this would be even better. I will have this again.","jera1350","Jun 22, 2009"
4.1,8.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: Both full flavored and easy drinking at the same time. Maybe the best English Brown Ale I have had.","bsp77","Apr 21, 2009"
3.46,-8.7,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"I suppose that I should try this fresh, because it touts autumn hunting season in SW MN. The mouthfeel is firm, a little creamy but slightly harsh with carbonation. As of this bottle, I'm not impressed (yet again) with BBB, but I'm willing to accede that this is close to an interesting take on the English brown style.","BretSikkink","Beers"
3.92,3.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A good offering from Brau Brothers, It's full of flavor and smooth for a 6.8% ABV. A little more body may have been nice, but that's not to take away from a good beer.","climax","0"
3.55,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D- This is a nice English Brown Ale. I haven't had an English Brown in awhile and it was nice to revisit the style. This brew is very sweet and has a strong flavor. It would be perfect for making bread with. Wouldn't mind having this again.","PittBeerGirl","Nov 13, 2008"
3.67,-3.2,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"D-A drinkable brew. Enjoyable to enjoy on occassion, as the sweetness of the toffee/caramelly malt can become a bit much.","CHSLBrew","Oct 15, 2008"

3.87,2.1,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D - Good drinkability, I'd certainly reach for another one if I had it available.","thethrone","Mar 08, 2008"
3.92,3.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Ring Neck Braun shows that Brau Brothers can brew good beer if they put their minds to it. Their standard lineup borders on awful at times, but this first offering in the Single Batch Series is something to celebrate. Thanks to feloniousmonk for the bottle.","BuckeyeNation","Feb 09, 2008"
3.6,-5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Malty brown, pours brown with initial white foamy head. Some bitterness apparent, but well washed over with malt, making it easy drinkable but essentially another malt. Some chocolate malt. nothing really roasty came through, but did come to a fruit finish.","Sammy","Jan 08, 2008"
4.22,11.3,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a cloudy red/orange/brown, nice colour, thick off white head forms, settles to a thick layer, leaves behind some decent lacing. Smell is neat, caramel, spices, bread, nuts, lots of sweet fruit, brown sugar, really neat. Taste is nice, caramel, very nutty, light bit of roast, bread, brown sugar, fruit and nuts in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Very smooth and drinkable, nice flavour, great brown ale. Thanks Scotty!","Viggo","Dec 30, 2007"
3.48,-8.2,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"after a few bottles, it seems like this offering is trying to meld american/english brown ale qualities with belgian style wackiness. very confusing, but interesting and unique.","budgood1","Dec 17, 2007"

4.3,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear, dark brown, with a thin finger of light khaki head. Rich, nutty, toasted malt on the nose, with rummy fruit, and hints of chocolate. Toasted grain and nutty malt flavors up front. Caramel and light chocolate mix with hazelnut and dark fruit. Hints of alcohol in a chocolaty, mildly bitter finish. Very nice. Medium-bodied with a smooth, evenly carbonated feel. A nice surprise and glad to find another great MN brew!","alexgash","Dec 05, 2007"
3.25,-14.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Pours a dark mahogany with some ruby tones. Quickly disappearing head. Nose- expected brown malt smell along with a raspberry concentrate smell. Taste- biscuity malts and ripe raspberries. Finishes too quick- not much complexity on the back end. Light hopping. Good cabonation. Beer is somewhat sour as you get into it.Decent effort.","oakbluff","Nov 20, 2007"

4.3,13.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Served on tap at the Happy Gnome, this pours a clear dark brown color. The smell is sweet and nutty. The taste is sweet and malty with a nutty caramel flavor, with minimal hops. There's nothing overly complicated about this beer-it just tastes good, in the style of an English brown ale. The mouthfeel is smooth and tasty. It's easily drinkable and satisfyling. Recommended!","edbeered","Oct 22, 2007"
4.5,18.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Clear auburn/scarlet red. Thin light brown head. Lacing is more than adequate. Really nice aroma. Kind of dusty, yet quite meaty as well. Thick with malts and nutty goodness. Flavor starts with nice maltiness. Very smooth. Nuttiness is quite prevalent throughout. This flavor has some substance to it. Hops provide balance. Finishes chalky with grain dust coming to mind. The mouthfeel is quite good. Smooth and silky in the mouth. Just enough carbonation. Very good ale. Very good all around.","Bighuge","Oct 20, 2007"
4.57,20.6,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Drinkability: This is a very enjoyable beer. I was going to save the remaining two for another night but they are going down the hatch tonight. To me that is drinkability. When you can't wait to drink it again. My overall score may seem high but to me this is a dandy. I wish I could buy more. About the only drawback is the yeasty aroma I noted and which is evident in most of the beers I have tried....in this one it blends with things nicer and does not bother me as much as say in their Pilsner or Pale Ale...","ZAP","Oct 19, 2007"
4.52,19.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,5,"This beer pours a clear brown color with ruby hues around the edges. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is very strong. Caramel, nuts, toffee, a hint of butter. The taste is as bold as the aroma. Caramel and toffee round dominate the flavor, with a slight yeasty note that seems to be common to Brau Brothers beers. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, with nice carbonation and a velvety texture. Overall, this is one of the better brown ales I have had. I would drink this on a regular basis, and can only hope it is brewed again someday.","KarlHungus","Oct 17, 2007"
4.05,6.9,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The chocolate malt really comes through with some nuttiness and nice hop bitterness to balance everything out. I would say it is medium bodied but the fizzyness of the carbonation makes it seem lighter. This is a really good beer. Just needs to be more active on pour with better head retention.","morimech","Beers"
4,5.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall: the only other Brau Bros beer I have tried was their strawberry wheat, and I tell you what, this one was much more impressive. Billed as a double nut brown, I wouldn't call this a big beer, more like a strong brown. I really liked how they brought out the chocolaty and nutty flavors together. I will probably have to grab another 6er or two before this single batch is gone.","dfried","0"
4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a brilliant mahogany-amber in color, topped with a rocky medium tan head. Nose is fruity, malty, and fairly biscuity. Malt characteristics (esp. chocolate malt) are nicely expressed. There's even some tannins here, and of course a touch of diacetyl that works for the style. As with several of the ales in the Brau lineup, Ring Neck Braun is a touch grainy, chewy, and with an agreeable bready characteristic. Oaty! Oily/unctious in the best way, and fairly fruity, with notes of berry and plum. Although this one is truly malt-focused and rich, it is also fairly amply hopped to balance out its malt sweetness. Quite drinkable and altogether fairly weighty; after a couple of pints I didn't feel like switching to another brew, but almost felt like tackling a hoppier beast, or for that matter some food: this one seems to just beg for a pairing with something in the rich and meaty category. Finish leans toward the dry side, and the malt character really lingers. Ring Neck Braun Ale is described by brewer Dustin Brau as a Double Nut Brown Ale, and in that sense it reminded me a bit of an imperial nut brown ale I enjoyed earlier this year (edit: Tommyknocker), and although it doesn't reach such boozy heights it is still on-style despite its strength. Rather impressive overall, and I look forward to repeat visits.","Chaz","0"
