"Used a Samuel Smith pint glass that I got in a winter variety pack back in probably November or December. Beer is a clear, copper brown, just a shade lighter than a scotch-style's ruby. Topped with spongy, rocky light brown head that devolves into a nice, long-lasting film, leaving moderate lacing. Smells and tastes perhaps a little estery, it could be that this is related to the vanilla or green apples others have noticed, although I'd say more akin to bananas. Caramel is the main aroma. English hops present as well. The taste I like better, nutty and crackery grains at first, but tart and fruity (again, banana), as well as faintly black peppery as it settles, with nuttiness and hops strongest on the aftertaste, accentuated by the warming. The dark chocolate that others have noticed I think can be parsed out to these other tastes, although it is definitely present. This one's a smooth, medium bodied, rich, moderately carbonated, only mildly astringent brew. Not overwhelming on the palate, despite its cornucopia of flavors and sensations, so I could easily drink the whole pint and more in one sitting, although I chose to save what wouldn't fit into my first pour for later."

"Good smooth taste and very mellow, but too expensive!"

"O: the vanilla caught me by surprise; I like the vanilla, but it doesn't really match the style;"
"Very subtle but wonderful taste. I want a barrel!"
"The nuttiness is too pronounced for my taste."
""
""
""
""
""
"It was ok, nothing special"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is light, drinkable brew with enough flavor to keep you engaged.  It’s missing the nuttier flavors I normally find in a brown ale, but that doesn’t diminish its quality any."

"Mild coffee, caramel, toffee, malt, then a sweet brown sugar that throws off the balance."
""

"Overall-  At only 5% alcohol there is a ton of flavor packed into this beer.  Really nice complexities in the malt ranging from sweet caramel, nuttiness, and a little bit of bitterness from a roasted malt.  The earthy hops add a nice balance, but almost add a bit too much spice in the finish.  Also, relatively speaking this was surprisingly bitter, especially at first, but that fades a little with warmth.  Overall, this is a great brown ale, and one that will a go to for the style when I want a brown ale."

"Pours a dark brown with a creamy head that dissipates into a thin lace. Aroma is incredible! Very nutty, roasted malts, grainy and hints of coffee. Taste is nutty sweet with a smooth and slightly bitter finish. Creamy and smooth feel, great to drink on a cold day by the fireside. A tasty wintertime ale! I love it and will definitely continue to buy!"

"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Pours a very clear fairly dark brown, with a nice fluffy, tan two finger head. Little retention and lacing. Aroma was kinda slight, with a bit of toffee, caramel, and nutty notes. Just a faint hint of sweet malty aroma. Flavor was nutty, like hazelnut, almost like Nutella with half the the chocolate missing. Mouthfeel was pretty thin, but very smooth and silky, went down very nicely. Overall, quite a nice beer, what you'd expect from a great brewery like Samuel Smith's."

"550ml bottle. Aug 14. Pours a reddy, amber-brown colour with a dense light tan head which lasted well and left some nice lacing. Aroma of sweet butterscotch and nuttiness. Medium sweetness and an underlying medium bitterness. Creamy, smooth body with a surprisingly thin body. Bitter, almost dry finish. Plenty of interesting things going on here but not really my cup of tea (or glass of beer)."

"O: A salute to Tadcaster on an all-around enjoyable brown!"
""
""
"Pours a pretty reddish-mahogany in color with a thick foamy/creamy 2-finger beige head that finally settles down to a few millimeters near the end of the drink. Lots of sticky lacing is seen through out the drink. The aroma is of roasted malts with a hint of caramel malts also. More going on with the taste as there is a hint of nutty chocolate also in the mix. Very smooth and goes down easy. No bitter or harsh aftertaste at all. One of the best 'Nut Brown Ale's' on the market in my opinion. Medium-bodied with lighter carbonation. A tasty brew!"

"Beer pours a dark brown body with a white head. Smell is of sweet roasted malt and a bit of nuttiness. The flavor is nice with a sweet chocolate, nut and a bit of faint weak coffee. Mouth feel is really smooth, and gives a slight tingle on the tip of the tongue."
"Clear brown with a four finger head that gradually receded to a half a finger. Not much on the nose that I could notice, nor on the taste for that matter aside from a little nuttiness. Medium bodied with light carbonation, silky. Overall, good, but not as great as I've come to expect from this brewery."

"Large 550ml bottle poured in a Samuel Smith pint glass.  Exceptionally long lasting head with a lace that grips the glass throughout.  Brown colored ale, exactly like the label.  The toffee notes are the focal point.  A little hint of caramel, perhaps a little hazelnut like Nutella.  Very easy to drink, no one flavor overwhelms the palette.  Light bodied with a gentle hop kick; not thick at all, which is remarkable.  Surprisingly refreshing with a pleasant aftertaste.  I'll definitely revisit."

"I would say I really agree with the overall ratings this one has gotten from this site. Another delicious beer from Sam smith."

"O- I went in with a completely open mind on this one and am glad I did. This brew is more for research purposes anyways as I am planning on brewing a similar style of brown ale but with a hint of peat-smoked malt thrown in. I think the peat would go well with this one though! Very good brew!"

"Food match: Stilton cheese, game such as roast grouse; pheasant; partridge; roast duck and guinea fowl... yeah I read from the label again."
"My first English brown ale, I found it only vaguely comparable to various American brown ales I've had. While not partial to brown ales, I was very fond of Rogue's Hazelnut Brown and DFH's Indian Brown ales, and while you would never confuse this with them, I would consider it on par."

"Poured a wonderful brown color with amber around the edges when held to light and a two fingers of gorgeous fluffy off-white head that slowly receded leaving abundant lacing. It looks fantastic. Scents of sweet malt, rich, yeasty fresh bread, caramel alongside some hints of toffee and nuttiness. A very appealing, rich, malt-dominated aroma that is still quite light. Very nicely executed and extremely true to style. Flavor begins with toasted malt and slight caramel flavors, alongside a medium-light malt sweetness and light bitterness, moving into a nutty, toasted, biscuity malt flavor with moderate bitterness and hints of toffee. Finish is semi-dry with notes of toasted malt, nutty flavors, toffee and faint hints of caramel. Aftertaste is semi-dry with notes of toasted malt and nutty flavors with a moderate bitterness. A very good flavor profile that is true to style and very pleasant to drink. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied with light carbonation and a smooth, slightly chalky feel. Very nice, quite true to style and a good example of an English pub ale. Overall this is an excellent example of a classic Northern English Brown Ale. It is true to style and excels in every regard and is quite the nice treat."

"The only thing I don't like about this beer is the price! This is certainly a fantastic brown ale, but I don't think it is significantly better than many regular priced local brews. The craft brewery price-tag is a little steep, but of course, this ale deserves a lot of praise. Rich, full, and smooth flavor, and all said and done I would probably buy it again."

"Pours a nice deep reddish brown with a great head that lasts forever. Very good lacing. Smells nice and malty. A very easy beer to drink. Not too thin or too thick. Very good flavor. Has a hint of sweetness and a nutty finish. I really enjoyed this one a lot."

"O - This is not your typical brown. There are articulated flavors of nut and malt, and a subtle bitterness that keeps the beer from becoming cloying or heavy. A good brown is often hard to find, and this is a very good brown."

"Love this stuff. I just wish it wasn't so expensive. I went through a period a while back when I was hooked on English brown ales like Newcastle; also at the time I was brewing my own using kits. This was far better than anything I ever made. A sweet taste, not hoppy at all. Good with food, and I say that as someone who rarely drinks while eating."

"O: The smell is wonderful, very enticing. Plays like a lightweight dubbel with a decent portion of its profile. I wish it were a bit creamier with a fuller body. I think it provides a more pleasing experience closer to room temperature. Overall, it’s pleasant and easy to drink. If it crosses my path again, I’ll drink it."

"I see this one in the stores a lot so I decided to have a go. Well, I can't say it was the most impressive nut brown I've had. The caramel color and aroma of nut and molasses are rather nice, but the flavor and body seem a tad watered down for the price I've paid. It goes down ok but has an earthy after taste that comes back after an hour that made me want to brush my teeth. I can't say this will be a repeat buy."

"Pours from the bottle with a nearly opaque earthy brown color and a foamy tan head. The aroma is pretty one-note, with a dry, nutty, mineral-like quality and only a little bit of caramel sweetness creeping in. The sweetness is more pronounced in the flavor, but the dry nuttiness dominates again, and the fine but active carbonation keeps the beer relatively light and dry. Maybe I'm just missing some of its nuance, but this beer is merely solid in my mind."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - the malty aroma and flavor of this beer are outstanding, the slight hoppy finish keeps it from becoming overly sweet making a beer with heavy dark roasted malts clean smooth and very pleasant."

"The appearance of the beer is a beautiful auburn color, with a creamy looking, tan head of about 1/4"". It's retention is excellent, as there is plenty of carbonation. For the aroma, there's scents of caramel, molasses, and a very bready, toasted malt presence. The taste is unbelievably smooth, with butterscotch and walnut notes, and the slightest hint of hops. The balance achieved here is second to none. It's got a very full mouthfeel but relatively light body. The finish pleasantly lingers. Perfect for drinking with a nice dinner."

"O: Great English Brown Ale. Glad to have tried it to use as a bench mark for other microbrewers in the area. Only concern I have is not knowing how fresh my bottle was."
""
"This is a fine beer and I'm glad I found it after years of not having any since my youth. An old school Brown with nothing fancy or clever about it, just good ingredients and blended well, then left alone to sort it's self out."
""
""
""
"Final Grade: 4.16, a very respectable A-. Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale is an excellent example of the style. Perfectly balanced, moderately complex and a pleasure to drink; this is the sort of ale that is made for sessioning. Not my favourite beer from this brewery, but still a superb brown that all English ale fans should give a shot or three. Hopefully the single bottles will make their way here eventually!"
""

"Overall - Really glad I followed by curiosity and got this since it is delicious full flavored but light enough that more than one could be consumed in a sitting. Would recommend this to all types of beer drinkers."

"Overall 3.50: A good beer and probably a reliable go-to choice. However, I was not impressed with this legendary beer at any level. It is dry and somewhat flavorless at some taste levels. There is a good balance here, and it is probably amazing with food, but this beer simply does not stand on its own, nor make enough of an impression to be a brew I would consider sessionable. Nonetheless, worth a try if you have never had it before."

"Poured from a bottle into a 16 oz champaign flute, developed a good 1 1/2"" to 2"" head that gradually reduced and made nice lacing. Several ounces had to wait in the bottle for a while. Medium dark amber in color, and clear. Aroma is toffee, malt, and hops. Flavor is subtle, initially malt amd toffee, then the hoppy bitterness builds after a sip, and ends on a grapefruit note. Mouthfeel is medium full. Overall I think I prefer stouts over this style, so that may be why I don't score it as high as others do. Yes, I too think it compare well with Sierra Nevada Tumbler, as mentioned below."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall/Comments: One of the best Brown Ales I have every had. I rank this right next to Tumbler from Sierra Nevada on my list of Brown Ales. A real pleasure to drink. Classified as an English Brown Ale @ 5% ABV. Consumed 10/1/2013."

" overall; there is wonderful contrast between the strong tastes but relative lightness of the beer. this is a great introduction to nut browns, and also a good option for an ale that is dark and flavorsome but not too strong and filling, would buy again if I'm in the mood for a brown ale."

"Overall: A very good beer. One of my favorite brown ales. I prefer one of Sam Smiths stouts, but this is an excellent alternative if you like a beer that has a flavor with more hops."
"This is the perfect celebratory beer, absolutely made for special occasions. When I bought it, they only had two left, and I wished I had bought the second."

"A reddish-brown hue that looks like a nut brown should look. The nut aroma really comes through along a some sweet overtones that smells like caramel. The taste is far and above any other brown ales I have tried. It follows the smell with a full, rich nuttiness that lingers on the palate forever. Mouth feel - Smooth and silky; goes down very smooth. Overall outstanding - there may be other nut browns out there that top this one but I have yet to find it."
""
""
"Iconic example of a ""northern"" English brown. Pours amber- brown with about four fingers of light tan foam. Aroma is invitingly woodsy, nutty, fruity with some peanut butter and toffee. Taste is an earthy, nutty integration where individual components are somewhat difficult to pick out, but there is slowly developing sultana raisin, walnut oil, peanut butter to match the aroma, a salty mineral medicinal bitterness, subtle sweet caramel. A sourness shows up as you go as well. I find this one to be less sweet than other browns and there's almost a bit citrus in the sour finish. Mouthful fits the style, with some oil and lingering syrupy sweetness. Nearing the end, faint bourbon notes. Nice classic beer worth seeking out."
""
""
""
""
""
"Bright acidic malts, fairly lean, hoppier than expected and just sharper and lighter than most brown ales. Screams for a meat-and-potatoes dinners to lift and cut through. I don't know that this is the best brown ale I've had or the best example of the styles (insofar as it is a style - search ""zythophile brown ale"") but it does tick all the boxes and drink fairly easy."

"I was excited when I bought this beer. Boy was I disappointed afterwards though. Sam Smiths Brown Ale looks amazing when you poor it into a nice pint glass. The brown and reddish color looks great and tasty. When I took my first sip I was very disappointed. I'm not sure what it was about this Brown Ale, but it didn't sit well with me. I feel like this beer didn't have enough toffee or caramel taste for me. Something seemed to be missing from the taste. I kept drinking the beer hoping something would change, but it never did. I drank my whole pint because I didn't want to waste it, but I'll probably never buy this again."

"Overall: It exceeded my expectations. A great brew for fall and winter, reminiscent of a rainy and cool English autumn day. Full of taste and body. Perhaps the finest of the English brown ales...I look forward to sampling further brews from Samuel Smith."
"Overall- Solid beer that doesn't really work for my palate. Around a 3.75 in my estimation but I'm guessing it would be closer to a 4 if the style suited me."

"Overall: A decent aftertaste with too much bitterness and metallic taste in the forefront. Mouthfeel is pretty dissapointing as well. Overall, a good beer that I wouldnt turn downbut wouldnt seek out again."
"O: This is essentially the category defining beer for an English style nut brown. Many American nut browns have moved towards more sweetness while Samuel Smith maintains the ideal rich malt and mellow hop balance."
""
""
""
"God, is there nothing Samuel Smith can't do? I've heard for a while that this was one of their staples, but as someone who tends to avoid brown ales, I never went for it right away. How I missed out. While I feel some of their other beers are more satisfying in a session, this remains hearty, flavorful, and extremely easy to drink. A staple in the style at hand, and perhaps (given the affordable and widespread value) the *best* in the style. Excellent stuff - I will never turn one down if offered!"
"O - A very well-rounded brown ale. Samuel Smith never disappoints!"

"550 ml bottle into imperial pint glass, bottled on 8/21/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big caramel, molasses, raisin, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, floral, and toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and moderate fruity notes. Taste of big caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, raisin, brown bread, floral, nuttiness, light roast, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, raisin, brown bread, floral, nuttiness, light roast, and light earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and complexity of malt flavors with moderate fruitiness; very robust for 5% with no cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent english brown ale! Great balance and complexity of robust flavors; and very smooth to drink. A highly enjoyable offering."

"(O)- Certainly a classic for the style. Smooth but rustic and nutty."

"Respect for the old school is required here even if it isn't your thing after trying it, which everyone should. My personal favorite was always the Old Brewery Pale Ale, and I will be sure to grab one of those to review on my next trip to the beer store."
""
""
"O: Pretty decent beer. Probably wouldn't buy it again as it was highly pricey and despite the high reviews for me it was forgettable but still pretty good. Nothing stood out but it fell inline quiet nicely."
"Overall, this is what an English Brown should taste like. Absolutely blows Newcastle away in terms of flavor, aroma, and mouthfeel. If only this beer was the price of Newcastle it would be a regular staple in my fridge."
""
""
""
"O: if this thing laced up and down the glass, it'd be straight across the board 5s. because lacing really makes a beer pop in my opinion, I dock it just a bit. the bottom line: if you like malt, THIS is it! such a great English ale and my personal favorite break from the massive hop-crazy American beers ... this one is arguably better than Samuel Smith's Old Brewery Pale Ale, which for me is a stalwart of a beer."
"Overall: A true classic that I have enjoyed over the years."

"Goes down incredibly easily. This one is smooth, well balanced and with a basic but very nice taste. The drink started to fade ever so slightly at the very end but this was not really that noticeable and it is still a very nice beer."

"Not only is this my favorite Brown Ale, it is one of my favorite beers of all time. Truly a World Class!!"
""

"Hard to knock. Classically good and solid. A very traditional and humble example."
"O - Excellent beer! The price for such a quality sample of the style is nearly second to none. Highly recommended even for newcomers as this isn't nearly as intimidating as many other top-rated beers."
""
""
"as good as advertised, and super cheap for the quality, I cant believe how long I waited to try this. what was I thinking?! the pour is a remarkably clear dark maple syrup color with a bubble bath head of tan foam that wont quit. the nose is the weakest like, smells like malty ale yeast, rather bland really. the flavor through really opens up. this is a caramel almondy malt bomb, but it isn't sweet if you can imagine that. its got a bitter dry finish more akin to cashews or something, unsalted of course, with some mild chocolate essence, and this only gets more dramatic as it warms up. not incredibly complex, but more of a simple elegance vibe here. did I mention this beer looks sexy? im down to my last swig and the head is as big as it was when I poured it some 45 minutes ago, just astonishing. lovely mouthfeel as well, cleanish in the finish with a flatly medium body and that casky English ale carbonation nice and mellow. this is a really drinkable brown too, glorious without all those residual sugars. I always knew sam smith wash high quality stuff, but I think its wide availability made me overlook it in favor of some of the rarer American craft stuff. with two delicious offerings from these guys in the last week, I will no longer walk past their shelf. I will be grabbing up the other varieties as quick as I can now, this stuff is the nectar!"

"The second I started drinking this beer I did not want to stop. There are nice flavors in here and has a very pleasant aftertaste. I'm definitely going to drink it again. Solid beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A great beer and should be at the top of this category."
""
""
"O-I was disappointed a bit by this, however it was still very good. I must have had my expectations too high."
""
"In the end, it reminds me of a really good version of Newcastle."
""
""
""
""
"I just got home from Jiu-Jitsu, and drank one of these, and I really enjoyed it. It's light, but with enough flavor that you aren't drinking water. It blows Newcastle out the water."

""
""
""
""
""
"Personal Rate: 3.75"
""
"Pours rich copper color into a dimpled mug with a light tan 1"" head, decent retention. Caramel and malty smell with some nuttiness. Caramel and malts are tasted first with a nutty dry finish. Medium body with a slight bitterness. Lively amount of carbonation. Overall, great brown ale that I will continue to buy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O-Damn fine beer. Excellent balance and very drinkable beer that is a straight forward take on the style."

"O - A really solid brown ale from Sam Smith's...one I could drink any time. It's got a great sweet and nutty flavor and is certainly easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Yummy malty nut brown. Samuel Smith is a leader in this style. I'd rate it higher if the metallic aroma and slight taste were gone."
""
"A- Samuel Smith's delivers quality brew after brew; lots of flavor and body in an easy drinking nut brown, 5% abv, ale."
""
"My review may sound a bit bizarre or show my lack of a palate, but when I first tried the beer today, I felt it was overly nutty. So I was not totally please with it. However, I continued to drink it while I noshed on homemade tortilla chips (salted) and avocado (with a homemade spicy sauce). Then the beer took a totally different taste. It immediately made happy to know that some beers go great with certain foods and tastes (yes people say this all the time). In essence, this is definitely a good beer with food."
"Overall Samuel Smith' Nut Brown Ale presents itself as an excellent choice for those nights when you seek a good English Brown Ale."
"O: A decent brown ale. Not my favorite style, but it has a few unique attributes. Glad I finally ticked this ubiquitous ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavors of dark roasted malts, minerals, slight coffee, toffee, carob, pecans, slight bitterness, burnt brown sugar. There's some richness and body, modest malts, light hops, dry finish...not bad but not particular smooth or tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very drinkable beer. I will definitely have it again, but will continue to try other nut browns."

"Poured into a pint glass, nice fluffy biscuit colored head developed which lasted and some what laced well. Aroma was mild with caramel and malt tones. Appearance was a clear dark amber, almost a brown / red color. Taste was very smooth with caramel notes and a light hop finish. mouthfeel was medium and slightly carbonated. Aftertaste was dry and mild."
""
""
"Overall- a great brown Ale, I will have another."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale ---4/5."
""
"Pours a slightly cloudy amber with a creamy off white head. Decent retention. The smell is sweet and grainy with some toffee and a fruity note. The taste follows from the smell. It's sweet but not overly so. I'm getting a slight fruity note along with some caramel. The finish is full of slightly sweet grain. The beer is dry, seems slightly chalky. Smooth carbonation."
""
"O: I've always had a soft spot for this style, and this is amongst the best of them."
""
""
""
""
"O- great brown ale, lots of flavor, sweet, very candy like. Alway enjoyable always availble, what's not to love about Sammy smiths?"
""
"The deep brown-reddish color, with a slightly tanned neck makes the appearance of this beer very pleasing. In the smell, we can detect some caramel-like idea, but not too exuberant. The taste is well-balanced, yet subtle in many ways: the hopness, body, and carbonation are all from low to medium (the last specially in the body)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very good Nut Brown. Was expecting a bit more of a bite but it was very mellow. Good blend of caramel, nuts, toffee and bread. Excellent overall taste and appearance. Not tremendously filling, which is a good thing. Recommended and will def drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice looking reddish brown in the glass with light tan head. Smell for me is predominately brown sugar. Still get the brown sugar in the taste but not so pronounced. Otherwise, it's a nice malt and nutty bread taste which is absolutely delicious. I'm a big fan of browns and this one is right there at the top. Worthy of all the raving."

"C+"
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A easy drinking nut brown. Not the smoothest of flavor transitions and a little weak in body, but still one to try if you get a chance."
""
"O - Sell your soul for just a taste of this beer. If I had to drink one beverage for the rest of my life, other than water, this would be it. A meal in itself, but a perfect partner with nearly anything.You'd be hard-pressed to find a meal with which this doesn't go perfectly. The best beer on the planet."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is a tasty and versatile offering from Samuel Smith. I like the flavors, and it did a good job of warming me up on a winter evening. In fact, for a winter treat I would prefer this brew rather than Samuel Smith's Winter seasonal. The Nut Brown is a good addition to Samuel Smith's lineup, though not quite as good as their famous Oatmeal Stout, in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a really good and impressive English Brown Ale. So far, I really like Samuel Smith's. Hope to have more."
""
"Given the previous reviews and my own expectations, I expected a stronger nut flavor that I didn't pick up on. If anything, there was more of a caramel, sweet flavor I wasn't at all expecting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle poured at Satche's in Gainesville. Pours light brown with a small head. Aroma of very slight nut and something i can only describe as liquor. The flavor follows with a watered down nuttiness and hints of roast and hops strangely mixed in. My second English style brown, and not sure that I am a fan. Somewhat rich malt and highly carbonated. Glad I tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, this beer was wayyy too damn sweet. I doubt i'd have it again."
"Poured from 750 ml bottle into pint. Pours a nice brown almost clear color with nice white head. Great sweet malts and a deffinite nutty aroma. Taste is just spot on sweet nutty malts. It has a great bitter nutty finish to balance this brew out. Fantastically smooth and flavorful. This is what a nut brown should be."

"O: an exceptional example of the style. easy to find, quite delicious, and well balanced as well"
""
"Great stuff!"
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel - Zest through carbonation, perhaps and some bitterness, but also smooth with some thickness."
""
""
"The nut flavor is in the after taste and sits on the tongue for a good bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Popped the top and poured into a cold glass mug, with a good sniff the strong rich malts are lovingly over powering. After letting this ale breathe for a minute the taste is as you would expect from world class high quality nut brown ale, this one delivers full-bodied and somewhat bitter, with strong flavor."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied, medium carbonation, smooth and easy to drink. Again, enjoyable, but not tremendously exciting, at least not anymore for this long-time Samuel Smith's fan."
""
""
""

""

""
""

"poured a ruby-orange-ish/brown; clear, with some effervescing bubbles rising from the center og the glass and a tan, two-finger head. smell is minimal with maybe an oatmeal scent?the taste is very well balanced- a little sweet on the front, but a little bitter as it leaves. light and minimally carbonated, it has that taste that some of the sweet, caramel-ly commercial, german octoberfests possess, but is a cleaner version and much easier to drink. overall, this is a great beer and one that should be kept as a stand-by in case you're trying a new brew which turns out nasty. the low abv necessitates a side of a good whiskey or bourbon, though . . . ."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A disappointing beer; makes me think I got an old bottle (no date listed on the label) since I get very little brown ale malt sweetness in the taste. Looks and aroma promised good things, but the taste didn't live up to the anticipation. I have had better bottles of this beer in the past; unfortunately, this is the one I happened to review. And so it goes with drinking imported beer without any bottling information..."
"O: Another amazing beer from Samuel Smith, very crisp and easy going but still has ample amounts of flavor, not over bearing, a must try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - One of, if not the iconic English brown. This is one I come back to occasionally and enjoy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is one of the best beers I have ever had. It almost transcends the category of beer and belongs to the work of art category. It pours an absolutely beautiful clear molassses, or mahogany color with a fluffy light tan two finger head. Retention is excellent and the lacing is among some of the best and most elaborate I have ever seen. Smell is pine, roasted nuts, honey, and maybe a little hint of soy sauce (meant in a good way). Mouthfeel is full and pleasing. Taste is a pleasing lemon on the front followed by roasted nuts on the finish. It is perfectly balanced. Drinking this beer is almost like meeting the girl of your dreams. Where have you been all of my life?"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - A classic brown, and one of the great ones at that. Wonderful all-around beer to go along with a great flavor profile. Everything Newcastle tries to be, but falls short. Not a big brown guy, but this is one of a handful I'd gladly drink with regularity."
""
""

""
""
""

"O: this is a good beer that I definitely would come back to."

"O: This beer deserves the acclaim it has received over the years from Michael Jackson to Beer Advocate. Its malty, nutty flavor is simply one of the best that can be found in the world for brown ales. If I am to raise any question, the mouthfeel might be a bit creamier, and I am nitpicking."
"Overall: a nicely put together ale, but the overpowering nut and metallic flavours are unpleasant - at least to me."
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a 1 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel/toffee, and some nutty aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, burnt caramel/toffee, slight nuts, and some slight fruity flavors. There is a medium amount of bitterness on the palate that lingers after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with some nice aromas and flavors that makes it quite easy to drink."

"O - A nice nut brown, but the strong mineral character throws things off for me a bit."

"Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale was poured into a pint glass from the bottle. I have been meaning to try this one for a while, so I was looking forward to the experience. The ale was a dark, murky brown with a generous head of approximately 3/4 of an inch. The aroma spoke volumes of the maltiness of this beer while still giving hints of sour to come. In the initial taste, I noticed the malts with a sour taste in the front. The backbone of the taste was a sweet candy-like flavor that reminded me of Twizzlers licorice. The promised nuttiness dances amid the tastes, giving it a well-rounded experience. In the aftertaste, the sour of this brown ale stands alone. It is a pleasant sour that sticks to the roof of the mouth and allows the flavor to linger. I believe the ale was thinner than I would have expected, but this was not a big mark against the beer. Overall, this is a flavorful brown that is a standard bearer for the style."

"Overall-The English know how to brew an excellent beer. I recommend this brew to anyone who wants a full flavored, full-bodied, and sessionable brew. Great quality and well-balanced. This tastes great with bbq brats and potatoes. Cheers!"
"Overall- Another great brew from Samuel Smith. While this is not my favorite style of beer, this was very enjoyable."

"Poured into a glass mug. Pours dark brown with a frothy light tan head. Plenty of bubbles can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. The beer is transparent at the ends of the glass, where it is reddish brown. The head dissipates slowly, leaving sticky lacking on the side of the glass. I can pick up smells of dark roasted barley malts and nuts. It reminds me of a good nut bread smell. The taste follows the nose. There's a rich maltiness to this beer from the dark roasted malts and the nuttiness blends well with the malt flavor. I can also pick up some mild toffee and vanilla flavors in this beer as well. The body is medium with plentiful carbonation. For as rich as the beer tastes, the feel is much lighter than the taste. It's slightly watery and very smooth. The drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a most excellent beer. It is very refreshing and flavorful. This is a great example of this style."

"Session beers don't get any more easygoing than this and this beer has a nice almond and walnut undertone without feeling too light or nutty. The body could have been a bit more filling but the taste was enjoyable and even if it's not fall, this was about as good as a Brown Ale gets."
"Medium body with solid effervescence. Slightly watery at the start but fills out mid-sip and beyond. Slight warming at the top of the throat/base of the tongue. Smooth and delicious. A standard bearer fro the style."
"O: I don’t know if the condition of this bottle was ideal but I think there are other brown ales that surpass this one. It’s a classic version of the style that doesn’t beat you over the head with flavor but eases its way into your heart."
"pours the color of ice tea. half finger of sand colored head disappeared as quickly as it formed. no lacing left behind. nose picks up on toffee, caramel, hazelnut and lots of malt sweetness. taste has a nice sweetness to it, but not overly sweet. dont notice any hops. caramel malty goodness. mouthfeel is on the thin side. goes down easy, could use more carbonation. slight oily finish. not a bad brown, but not one of my favorites either, kinda of reminds me of newcastle, like drinkin ice tea."

"Drink- One of the best brown ales. Unique in flavor and feel. I love this beer for the pricepoint and its only 5%"
""
"Definitely different than the typical American style, which tends to be dryer and less sweet, more like a watered down porter. This is super fruity sweet, almost like a Dubbel or Doppelbock, but with an English biscuity, nutty, malty backbone and earthy hops. Really an interesting beer and highly recommend."

""
""
"Poured into a Samuel Smith tulip pint glass. Pours a medium red brown with a thick, persistent light tan head. Nice presentation. Aroma subdued, very light roasted malt and mild nutty scent. Taste follows with light roasted and sweet malt, nuts, a hint of caramel. Flavor is mild, but pleasant, perhaps from the moderate ABV. Very mild bitterness. A slight sour taste to the finish is the only overt flaw. A pleasant understated brown ale."

"This is an amazing beer. I love the nuttiness about it. I have been on a english brown kick as of late and this is by far the best in show. Almost all 5's, I did smell one better Brown Ale so I will reserve the perfect score but that is nit-picking. If you haven't tried this it is a must."

"Dark brown with a medium thick to thick head that leaves lots of lace behind. Sweet yet sour malt aroma with a nutty hoppiness in the background and a hint of chocolate. Sweet chocolate malt flavor witha nutty hop background and a chocolatey finish. Medium bodied."
""
""
""
"Overall: I bought this in a three pack recently, read absolutely nothing about it and don't regret a penny nor time consuming it. It might come off a notch sweet to some taste buds but very hard to compare this and call any other brown ale better. Hope you all enjoyed....Salud!"

"O- Overall I'm not sure on this one. The first few sips I was thinking not, but kept finding myself wanting another sip. By the end of the beer I found myself wishing I had a second. Still not sure though."
"O: The hops aren't noticeable as this one centers around the great malt character. A classic English ale that's great to relax with. Forgot how good this one is."

"O: Aaaand Samuel Smith with the win – this time for English Brown Ales. This brew reminds me of a lighter, nuttier version of Samuel Smith’s Imperial Stout; it’s just as satisfying in nose, taste, and feel, and just as perfect as the quintessential beer for the style."
""

"O- A perfect example of English brown ale. A great balance of malt and hops. Would be sessionable if not for the large bottle."
"Overall a beautiful beer that has some good flavor and aromatic complexity. And for $10 along with the glass and two other offerings an absolute bargain."
""
"O- This beer sets the standard for nut brown ales. Although not the most popular style, this be deserves a try just to completely understand how a brown ale should taste. Another solid brew from Samuel Smith."

"Cheers!"

"Overall: Very underwhelming. Perhaps I got a bad bottle, or an old one, as I can't locate a date."
""
""
"O - Really good. I typically find the English styles lacking but this highlighted the some good brewing that makes you work a bit but well worth it. Start it at 50 degrees and let it warm."

"This brown ale is a very true brown color. The hold is light like most English style beers. The carbonation is also low. The aroma is mild with a roasty background. The mouthfeel is very light. It is almost like water when you first sip it. It is not very bitter and leaves a slightly sweet taste in your mouth."
"Pours a dark cloudy caramel brown with a medium tan head. Aroma of sweet toasted caramel malts with some dark fruity esters and some cacao notes fill the senses. Taste of some sweet toasted dark malts with a nice cacao and nutty flavor and light hops. Some yeasty notes in the flavor as well. Palate is a full body with a slightly creamy mouth feel and moderate carbonation. Finish is sweet toasted caramel malts, some yeast and ending with a slightly bitter hops, cacao nutty aftertaste. Overall a very good, flavorful, and enjoyable brew."

"O - A wonderful and clean. This is a great example of what a brown ale should be."
""
""
"It's very easy to drink, but it doesn't blow me away. I'm sure that the beer is consistently good and reliable. I like it, but I don't intend to try it again. In my view the beer doesn't meet the promise that I was hoping for, but it's still a great brown ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, another brilliant beer from Samuel Smith's. High quality in all areas and very sessionable. Brown ales are a style I'm growing to like, and this one is certainly worthwhile."
""
"Overall - Very straightforward and pleasant beer to drink, with a depth and richness of flavour that puts it ahead of many nut brown ales."
""
"Overall: Another great Sammy Smith beer, great for drinking on any occasion. Just like having your cake and eating it too."
""
""
""
""
"O: The sweetness factor here was just too much for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Just a superb brown ale, the kind of thing that Sam Smith is so good at. There is nothing obscure or wild about this beer, it is just made with basic ingredients using old fashioned methods and the the result is a legendary nut brown ale. This is surely regarded as a classic to many and I will advocate for the same, so wonderfully simple and yet so unique. Sam Smith is a hell of a brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Conclusion: Another great beer from Samuel Smith's!"
""
""
""
"O: Not a big fan of this, to be frank, though I don't hate it at all. Probably my least favorite Samuel Smith beer to date, and not something I'd willingly go for in the future, unless I caught it on draft."
""
""
"O- Definitely gets better as it ""warms"". May have had this one too cold. Overall...not all that bad. May be an acquired taste?? Do not get the ""world class"" rating. To each his own. In my opinion, this one smells way better than it tastes."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a 550 ml bottle into a pint glass. This pours a nice dark brown with a decent off white head. The smells are of caramel and toffee malts, with a hint of nuts. The feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty good, a little nutty flavor, lots of malts."
""
""
"I really want more ""nut"" like elements here. This beer is extremely one dimensional, even for the style. I suspect a fresher bottle would bring in some more complexity and and give some more balance to the malt. Sadly I can't really seek out fresher versions of this living in the states."
""
""
""
"O Great balance, very interesting flavors and pleasing smell. Definitely a favorite."
""
""
""
""
"I dont see the appeal to this beer to be honest :("
""
""
""
"O- I like the flavor a lot and see this beer as a reliable choice when you seek something of the type. I'm not too familiar with nut brown ales, so don't relish this one as much as other reviewers, but I like this beer and will buy it again."
""
""
""

"O: a great beer for the cooler weather, defiantly in my top five nut browns and readily available too!"
"Pours a clear, dark copper with a dense, creamy khaki-colored head that hangs around for some time, eventually settling to a nice cap. Leaves lots of craggy lacing clinging to the glass. Sweet, malty aromas of roasted nuts, caramel, and baked bread. Similar to the nose. Lots of sweet caramel malt, roasted nuts, baked bread, and toasted grains. Delicious, and so drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately creamy, with a medium body and good carbonation. Sets the standard for an English Brown Ale, amazing beer!"
"O. I found this beer was good. it didn't blow me away but it was good. the taste certainly got better as it warmed. it felt a little to light though. still a good buy."

"I give it an overall of 5.0"

"O - A very good brown ale. Nice nutty flavor mingles with sweet maltiness without overpowering the other flavors. A good heavy beer to enjoy with a mild meal. Another great beer from Samuel Smith's."
""
"Overall, its very pleasing to smell and taste. I really enjoy it. Have not tried this before so its a new find for me that I am happy to have tried. If you like beers like this please try it and it should be enjoyable for you."

"I had a bottle of SS Nut Brown Ale last night at dinner at bstreet in Newton. Poured into a tall pils glass. Dark brown color, but has a clear body, not opaque. Minimal head and not much lacing. Smell had a roasted chestnut aroma lurking in the glass. I enjoyed the taste very much. There was mostly malt dominating here. Lightly toasted, it gave this beer warm, rich flavors of toffee and caramel. Mouthfeel was smooth for a brown ale, but had a slight amount of bitterness at the end. This was a flavorful beer, and it paired well with a thick glazed pork chop."
""
""
""
"O: This is easily the best English brown ale I've ever had. If you have yet to try this one, make a point of doing so in the very near future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is okay, but I don't think I care much for brown ales, they all tend to be a bit bland. This is a decent brown ale though and maybe one day my palate will appreciate it better."

"Overall, this is easily one of the best beers I've ever had. And I'd say it's probably the best English browns (of which I'm partial) I've ever had. There isn't much I would add/omit to/from this beer in Beer Fantasy Land. It's damn near perfect! If you like English browns, this is the quintessential example!"

"Overall I thought this was an OK beer that really didn't impress me too much, I had pretty high hopes for this highly acclaimed English Brown Ale, but there were a couple things about this beer that really weren't for me and left me disappointed. It went down somewhat smooth but for me the high amount of sweetness made this beer not too drinkable, I am glad I am splitting this with my brother, it might be a chore for me to finish the bottle by myself. What I liked most about this beer was the look, it looked pretty damn good especially in the brewery's signature pint glass. What I liked least about this beer was the taste and aroma, it smelled very similar to sherry with a little bit of apple juice, and the taste was way too sweet with not enough nutty flavor to it and a sweet aftertaste. I don't think I would buy this beer again, I enjoy American versions of English Brown Ales much more then this beer, I think they have a better malt profile, better body, and a better nut flavor in most. This beer is worth a try to see where you stand on the traditional take on a Brown Ale, but if you are use to the American versions this might be a bit too sweet, like it was for me. I had very high hopes for this beer and it just didn't live up to them, it was too sweet and not nutty enough for a beer labeled as a nut brown. After reading some other reviews I think this beer might be a little old, but with no bottling date I can't be sure and I don't think an old beer would would be the cause of the high level of sweetness that made this beer a little hard to drink. It's safe to say I am not a fan of this beer, I hope the other two from the holiday pack are much better then this one was."
""
""
""
"O- I can't really get past the sour taste, but everything else is great."
"Very drinkable and satisfying."
"perfect carbonation for allowing the taste to come through first.. basically it doesn't get in the way... goes down the throat like a whisper. the taste stays with me..."
""
""
""
"O: I'm a huge fan of Samuel Smith, and this is my go-to Brown Ale. Nothing about this beer is muted; it's full of wonderfully sweet flavors that balance out well, and never over the top. This beer is easy drinking made into a full bodied experience."
""
""
""
""
""
"This brew is unusually thin-bodied, and very light, yet full of flavor. Initially, this comes across as sweet up front, with an almost sour hops finish. Overall, an easy-to-drink brown ale, but not as good as I'd hoped."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's better than average, but not quite good. There are no major flaws, just nothing to write home about either."

""

""
""
"O: One of my favorites; also one of the first real craft beers I got into. This was the one that cost a bit more, but was worth the taste. Perfect with a chocolate chip cookie."
""
"This was a very good ale, bordering on perfect for my taste. The smell was a wonderful sweet malted barley smell. Color was a dark brown coffee color matching its complex odor. The taste was an amazing mix of dark malt and a bitter sweet hoppiness that drove the flavor home. The feel in the mouth was silky and a after taste was a wonderful nutty like flavor that the title bears the ales name- Nut Brown Ale."

"O: The finest brown ale I've ever tasted -- the epitome of its class. I'd drink this a couple of times a week, but for the price. If I ever have the opportunity to taste this on tap, be sure that I'd pay handsomely for the chance!"
"D: Definitely the best brown ale I've had yet, striking a great balance between rich, sophisticated malt flavour and the sessionability of dark milds. Hearty and moreish, it's worth seeking out for anyone who likes English ales and a perfect example of North Country-style brown ale."
"O: One the greats that I have tried so far, nothing bad to report just overall a great among nut browns"
"O: Great nut brown ale. Smooth and tasty and went down way to easy. One of the best brown ales I’ve ever had."
"Overall: Brown ales aren't my favorite beer style, but this one is balanced perfectly and is a very smooth and easy drinking beer. The low ABV would make this a great session beer for the malt lovers out there."
"Overall - a very well-crafted brown ale. I will admit that this is not one of my favorite styles, but there have been a few pleasant surprises for me, and this is definitely one of them."
"O: Pretty good beer, but not something I am going to actively seek out. Solid, just not overly exciting."
"O: This is actually my first Sam Smith. I'm generally a fan- not the best brown ale I've ever had, but I might have it again."
"O: I always feel like Samuel Smith products feel a little thin. Maybe it just feels like this because of the lack of alcohol content. It just doesn't offer the kick that I truly desire. This is far from a bad drink, but why are they holding back on that alcohol content? Hopefully with their other drinks I will not react this same way."
"This beer pours a clear, dark rust color with thin foam and lasting lace. It's aroma is nutty, toast, biscuits, and a hint of milk chocolate. The flavor is complex. Beginning with caramel, nuts, biscuits, and toffee with roasted malt and a hint of maple in the finish. The mouthfeel is an oily, medium full. Samuel Smiths Nut Brown Ale is a very good beer, great on a cool fall night. Highly recommended."
"M: Not a terribly easy drinker due to the strong maltiness and low carbonation compared to the medium viscosity."
"A very well made beer with great consistency. Highly drinkable and easy going that fits the style wonderfully. Can't go wrong with this one."
"This is one of those ""fancy"" imports that seems to crop up at tourist locations, but not my local grocery (I've seen it at multiple shops in Yellowstone and Hot Springs National Parks). This one, I picked up at world market for $2. The simple, yet elegant bottle with gold foil, certainly gives the initial impression of a regal brew, and this beer delivers. The flavor is rich and smooth and is paired with an exceptionally creamy body. This would be my ideal session beer if I could find it locally at a reasonable price, but alas, neither condition is met. I guess I'll only get to partake during special occasions or roadtrips..."
"Notes: I used to rank this beer much higher. It is a good and tasty beer but I no longer consider it one of the best."
"Sweet on the front of the palate, but not overly so. Molasses and caramel are there, with just a smidge of that fruitiness from the nose. A small but notable hit of hops touches the middle of the palate, spicing it up. The back of the palate plays the caramel malts up, showing off a sweetness that rounds everything out superbly. A nutty taste resides in the back of the palate as well, sticking around with the linger as well. This gives the beer the full balance, and as it drinks smoothly and finishes dryly, you are left wanting another sip. This is a nice little beer with high drinkability and a great taste. Sam Smith always has great beers brewed to style and never with any off flavors, giving them the longevity that they have prospered from."
"One of the best, and most consistent, browns. A daily drinker if there ever was one."
"Nice clean smell, and the taste was the same. Not overpowering but very pleasant with a definite nuttiness. A good drinking beer or goes well with a steak. I will have again (and again)."
"O: This beer was surprisingly tasty and refreshing. This beer is absolutely worth all of the praise it receives."
"Overall: Very delicious brown ale a whole lot of flavor proving that flavorful beer doesn’t always have to be accompanied by a high ABV."
"Full-bodied with the slightest amount of bittering hops. Balanced as expected from an English brewery (with the malts winning overall) and I'd be remiss to not mention that Samuel Smith's has yet to let me down."
"Overall, this is a solid beer. It's a little sweet for my liking, but the malt character is solid. This is one I've had several times, and when looking for something authentic it's a go to."
"This is a tasty and very drinkable, simple, straight-forward brown ale. Exemplar of the English Brown Ale style."
"Outstanding beer. The texture was incredible. Find some now for yourself."
"O: A solid, easily drinkable English Brown. Nothing earth-shattering (I prefer more malt flavors and a thicker body, personally), but solid."
"The appearance is what it is....nut brown ale. Being a nube,it looked like I invisioned. Hoping it wasnt going to look dirty and it didnt. Robust dark wood color with a smoked hickory smell but also fruity sweet smell too. The taste expecting to be kinda of bitter,but not at all,nor dry. Refreshing zesty fruity taste,malty and at the end another sweet taste kinda of honey?..not sure what,but very good. I loved this beer"
"O: Very well done brown ale. Tastes like it would pair with a lot of foods quite well."
"It's a solid beer which I believe promises more than it delivers: The nuttiness is present but not as prominent as I feel it should have been and I prefer my brown ales with more body. Higher mashing temperature and some brown malt would benefit this ale in my opinion."
"O: A well-made and enjoyable brew."
"Overall- The butterscotch aroma and creaminess is awesome. The beer even got better as it warmed a bit. I liked this one and wish I had tried it sooner. Will have to try some more beers from this brewery as well."
"There's a reason that this beer is the benchmark for the Northern English Brown style. It's an excellent beer; I don't think much more needs be said."
"O: Delicious beer with excellent flavor and feel. Will definitely enjoy another of these."
"Nice brew!"
"Oh well."
"O: Pretty good nutty brown. Not exactly a fan or expert with brown ales, but this is a good ale in its own right."
"From the 12 flo. oz. bottle. This is the brown ale that brewers emulate when they brew a brown ale. The pour is a clean mahogany-brown with a delicate, thin head. The aroma is full of nuttiness, sweet caramel malts, with a crisp, clean mellow hop background. The body is smooth and soft. The taste sweet with a slight bitterness and just a little yeast thrown in. Very easy to drink."
"M: Medium bodied with great flow. Nice coating and a tasty aftertaste."
"Pours a dark brown w/ a nice two finger tan head. Decent carbonation and lacing. Nose is that of bread, malt, coffee, and a hint of chocolate. Very well balanced and really nice nose. Taste is very similar to the nose profile. Nut and cocoa added on the taste. Feel is malty, bitter, and sweet/sour... A lot going on here. Really nice for the style. Overall, this is one of the best in the style. I really like this brewery, and this beer is highly recommended."
"O: Great beer to drink a few of while staying entertained by it."
"Man, this beer gets better and better as it warms. It's a must try for all. Considering the price, drinkability, and accessibility of this brown ale, you have no excuse!"
"The beer is brown with a foamy head that settles to a nice cap sticking to the sides of the glass with web like lacing. Smells of bread, hay, and perhaps slightly medicinal. Tastes perfectly balanced of rye bread, butter, grass, and coffee. More of a harty beer. This beer is food. Fantastic."
"Overall: I guess I really am a sucker for brown ales, and this one will be the beer I use to grade all other brown ales from here on out - a really wonderful beer. You. Must. Try."
"O: I am not sure if this is the best respresentation of this beer, seems a bit uncharacteristic of other reviews, but for what it is worth, it is okay, just not what I was expecting."
"The tastes are subtle. They start with the typical English ale fruitiness (maybe some plum or grape?) followed by a touch of almond. Nothing overbearing. A straightforward example of the style and another solid offering from Samuel Smith's."
"Overall, this is good fare, and far more accessible than many of its peers; drinkers unfamiliar with the style will find this nut brown ale easy to quaff."
"Also, let it warm up a bit, this is amazingly better at room temp"
"O: This is a really good beer that is deep in the roots of what is a british beer. Really well made, but nothing spectacular."
"Overall, this is a very good example of the style. It is easy drinking and not too overpowering, while having subtle complexity."
"Overall: This was and still is one of my favorites. This beer definitely improves as it warms. It might be a 5 for me if it had a more vibrant and nutty aroma."
"Overall--Excellent beer that is well worth every penny."
"O: Blows Newcastle out of the water. Its got depth of flavor and a full body. I like it."
"550ml bottle, pours a deep almond brown with off-white head that lasts awhile. Smells sweet, almost like toffee. Light on the tongue, not overly complex but very smooth and tasty. Notes of burnt nuts, light hops, malts and toffee. It is not overly carbonated, which I enjoyed, and it’s very easy to drink. A very enjoyable brown ale, even if it is slightly less complex than some of the others."
"If a beer is skunked DON't REVIEW IT!"
"Underwhelmed by this highly-praised beer. Not nutty enough for me, or just not in the right vein. A bit of a dud for me. At least the price is right."
"O - After trying this and the Imperial Stout, I need to try more from this brewing company. This was a lovely ale with a good deal of drinkablity. Maybe not as good as the Imperial Stout, but that's more for personal preference. It's still worth it just to smell the nice flavors it has to offer."
"Easy drinking and very approachable and full of flavor. Lingering finish. Well done."
"My only problem is it went down too easily. Not a sipping beer unless you have more discipline than I have."
"this beer pours a nice brown color with a reddish tinge. the head is tan in color fluffy and lasts pretty long. the smell is sweet caramel malty and inviting. the flavor follows the smell with sweet caramel malts up front and just a hint of bitterness in the finish. mouthfeel is medium bodied . overall the best nut brown i have had"
"Overall, I am really not a Brown Ale advocate. I will most certainly drink it & reflect on it happily, but its not among my top 10 styles. I reviewed this beer as competently as I could in terms of style. Its a solid Brown Ale, especially if you like nutty/toffee flavors."
"That said, I don't know that I'll be going out of my way for it again. It's fine, but not really memorable in any way."
"There’s just something about the “nut brown” that turns me off from the start. But that nose… man. Anyway, the beer is just mediocre at best. Oh well, hopefully we will only have a couple more of these Samuel Smith’s on the list."
"My pour created two thick fingers of deep-mocha head with excellent retention. I would have called the colour ""garnet"". but I will defer to ""amber-brown", and with NE-quality clarity. Nose was both nutty and chocolaty, like a Hershey's Bar with Almonds. Actually, allow me to amend that to a Cadbury's Fruit & Nut bar since I also caught some raisiny smells in there. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste had a molasses quality on the tongue, not sweet at all, but more bittersweet. Interesting. Finish was likewise more bitter than sweet, completely unexpected and welcome by someone who does not really like sweet, malty beers."
"This pours out as a really nice brown color. The head is pretty good size for the style with a light tan color. The lacing doesn't leave much behind on the glass. The smell of the beer has sweet nutty and roasted aroma. The taste has a good bitterness to it with a subtle brown sugar sweetness and a good roasted nut flavor also. The mouthfeel is thin but has a carbonation that keeps it interesting. Overall it's a damn good Brown Ale."
"O: I can understand why this is a world-class beer, but you also paying a world class price for it. Normally, this beer is 9.29 a pint before tax at Meijer’s however, because of a HUGE price drop down to a mere 4 dollars. I actually didn’t feel bad about trying it and now I’m thinking of stocking up while the prices are still low. If you are not a poor college student I would recommend trying this beer asap, however if your not wealthy then no worries, I don’t think this beer is a must try, but it is the best brown ale I have ever tried."
"Overall, Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale is classic beer. I have had numerous brown ales that are better but it's a classic from a brewery that helped me to get into craft beer in the first place. You dont NEED to try it but you should. Probably one of the top 5 English Style Brown ales, just not tops for all Brown ales."
"O: One of my favorites for sure. A little creamier and thicker and this would be the best beer."
"Overall a decent beer. I could definitely drink this again (and will, 4-pack!), but I was expecting more from one of the highest ranking beers of this style. Maybe it's the style, maybe it's the beer...not as good as I thought, but still a stellar beer!"
"The mouthfeel is good, it's medium-bodied and has a decent level of carbonation. The drinkability is very good. Really, what else could you want from an English Brown Ale? This is just a superb brew that tastes delicious and goes down very easily."
"This beer poured a darker brown color, with a decent size, but long lasting tan head. The smell was rich, very malty, and some nut like flavors can be dedected. The taste is full, nicfe and heavy, a bit sweet, strong malt flavors, and just a hint of some kind of nut. Very full non watery flavor, very strong for a brown ale. Overall the creme of the crop for brown ales, I dont think I have had a better one."
"Don't think I'll buy it again soon."
"O: A great session beer. This is a pretty well crafted Nut Brown. I don't think it is anything spectacular, but it is good. This isn't one of my favorite styles but this one is well crafted."
"Overall: A very good and interesting version of a brown ale. It's flavor is unique and tasty."
"O: Good beer. For brown ales, pretty much in the top rankings I've had. But I am not particularly impressed with the beer as a whole personally."
"This particular brew has a thick texture, but it doesn't drink like a heavy beer at all. Slick, and viscous, it's got a really nice texture."
"Almond smooth up front giving way to cranberry tartness, finishing dry and creamy at the same time. A wonderful brown ale unique and full of flavor."
"D – Overall a pretty tasty brew, a lighter English brown but still very enjoyable. I would get this brew again and for sure recommend it!"
"Overall: Definitely a pleasant, high-quality beer overall. Some quirks that may not be typical (other reviews don't mention them); I will definitely give this beer another tasting sometime soon."
"O: This is a good, everyday beer that goes down easy. I could drink a few of these in one sitting no problem and would be very happy doing it."
"Great tasting brew what can I say overall, these guys never fail."
"Still a great example of a brown ale."
"Overall I can see why this is considered one of the top English brown ales. It is complex but still subtle. All in all an excellent drink."
"O: No question why this is such a world-renowned Nut Brown Ale. It's nothing flashy, but hits everything on the head. A true classic."
"Served at refrigerator temperature into goblet. Pours with a fantastic head- thick but not too much and one which dissipates at a great pace (slowly, but allowing me to drink shortly). After a minute or two, a lacing remains. Colour and appearance is wonderful- a rich, crystal-clear brown with no haze. The initial aroma and flavor is of malt- rish British malt- and biscuit. Hop presence is minimal and somewhat earthy, subtly reminiscent of earth, but very clean. The first indication is that this should be a very malty beer but the sweetness is very well controlled and the hops, which are subtle, swim in perfect balance. The nut flavour is not immediately present until you are reminded that it is there- and then it's obvious. There is a subtle complexity to this beer which would keep me coming back. Highly recommended."
"Roasty malts, dark breads, layered nutty flavors, with some earthy musty tones, the standout Sammy flavor in the middle and finish. Very clean and flinty. Fruity in the middle and finish as well but hard for me to place what the fruit flavor is. Raisin or fig maybe? Nice dry finish with earthy hops. Great with the BBQ chicken I'm having."
"This is the first time I've had this beer in about 10 years. It is quite complex for a brown ale. I like it a lot and should revisit it more often."
"O - outstanding example of style. Refined and superbly crafted."
"poured into a tulip. Nice dark brown color with red highlights when held to light. Good size off white head that dissipated quickly and left good lacing. Smells of sweet malt mostly with some dark fruits and toffee. Taste is the sweet malts at first then blends to nutty toffee/caramel with overripe dates. Mouthfeel was good with carb just to my liking. Overall a well done brown ale and a good example of the style. Worth a try."
"I'm not the biggest brown ale fan, but you gotta give love to the classics. Exceptionally balanced, smooth, and nutty."
"O: A classic. This is my favorite brown of all time. Epic stuff here. This is worthy of all accolades it gets. Need to pick this up in four packs whenever on sale!"
"D: simple style, but nicely complex within itself. always nice to see such widely available, good examples of the style."
"This is a great one to pair with food, as it is refreshing and would pair well with most standard pub offerings, drinking this actually makes me want some Fish n Chips."
"Just a little weak on flavor."
"Side note: what is up with the foil? I know that used to be a sign of quality. Now the flavor alone determines the quality. The foil is only good for getting in your beer. It is just a pain in the drinking process."
"Overall: A nice little nut brown that surprised me. It has a lot in common with a mild, but this one has a very unique character and nails its flavours. The lower Sam Smith price will assure that I will be returning to this beer soon."
"O - a very good English ale."
"Delectable liquid brew!"
"Wonderfully done, this the benchmark of the style."
"Overall this beer was not really my cup of tea. I think it mostly boiled down to the fact that I did not really care for the malt character it had to offer. It was still a decent beer and no doubt a pretty classic example from a brewery that has been around for a very long time."
"Appearance is a brown to dark copper color with not much head. The scent is a wonderful molasses. Tasted a little malt sweetness up front - maybe like molasses or caramel - then an earthy or floral hops bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. The more I drank (and as it warmed a bit), the more I enjoyed it. Not as good as some other Samuel Smith's offerings, but quite good."
"Overall - Fantastic, as usual with sammy smith beers. Low alcohol and easy to drink. Nutty with a sweet kick. Not to far off from taddy porter but not as sweet and creamy. Great beer, right up there with taddy porter."
"O - A must try and one of the better brown ales around"
"I'd love to have this on tap - either way, exceptionally drinkable, especially at this ABV."
"Slightly toasted flavor without a lot of after taste. I would buy this again and match it up with some cheddar cheese or some beer cheese soup."
"Hey chief, if you dig the browns you should check this out. It's nice, balanced, and classic. I'd go for it again if I wasn't a ticker."
"D - Drinkability on this one is through the roof. I could drink this one all day. One of the best brown ales I've ever had and probably will ever have."
"A world-class beer that should be the archetype for the English Brown Ale. For me, a favorite among favorites."
"Poured from a brown 18.7 oz. bottle. Has a pretty dark brown color with ruby hues and a 1 inch head. Smell is very mild, I am not able to detect much of anything. Taste is also rather mild, some nuttiness, a bit of hops, a touch of caramel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a decent brew."
"D- Probably the best brown ale I have had thus far in my limited experience. It matched perfectly with my steak dinner and I would have ordered another had it not been over priced."
"D- 4.5 One of my favorite brews in a favorite style, the Sammy Smith Nut Brown is a go-to beer for me. It is balanced in flavor and goes down easily. I'd recommend it to almost everyone. One of the best aspects of this brew - you can get it almost anywhere!"
"Overall a superb Nut Brown ale, one of the best I have ever tried. But then again most brews from this brewer are just awesome!!"
"Overall, a very pleasant beer. Will buy it again."
"D: This is a great example of excellence in subtlety."
"A great beer with great aroma and taste. This beer is more complex than a simple run of the mill brown beer without being too complex. I guess the less is more theory holds true. The bottle makes for a beautiful presentation with the foli covered cap and traditional graphics. A beer and brewery I'd recommend without reservation to anyone. One of my favorites in their line-up."
"At 5.00%, this is definitely a very sessionable beer. I had two, but could have had two more for the night (although they were expensive). I would recommend this to my friends that enjoy Newcastle."
"I give a Schlitz for Samuel Smith's Nut Brown. Despite the cost, its durability strikes a chord with the romantic in me."
"The CPJ"
"D: I could have a couple of these with a nice roast, or by itself, very enjoyable beer."
"Taste - No metallic taste this time, but my wife says it tastes the same as last time. I have no idea how this is possible. Re-rating it from 2 to 4."
"Overall I very much enjoy this beer, I have had it many times. It is malty, slightly sweet yet crisp on the finish. It offers depth and drinkability."
"very solid beer for sure and one i would have no issue in going back to again."
"d-really drinkable. Lots of breweries make a brown ale but I think this is one that stands near the top."
"Pours a nice creamy kaki 1 finger head. Clear dark brown to maroon body. Smells of toffee, Carmel, sweet malts, some woody notes as well. Tastes sweet and Carmel at first then some earthy carmelized to burn sugar tastes. Medium full bodied, very coating on the way down. I could only have one of these at a time. $4 a bottle."
"Okay. I wouldn't have one every day, but available on tap I could see it being a good session beer when I'm not in a hops mood."
"Poured from the brown bottle into a nonic. Light brown with a crimson tinge and about 2 fingers of tan head. Smell is nutty with a decent amount of raisin coming through as well. Taste is similar. Plenty of maltiness on the palate. Not overly complex just a nice solid brown ale. Nutty, malty, tasty. No hop flavor at all. Just enough bitterness to stand up to the malt. Finish is fairly dry with flavor lingering for a short time after each sip. Carbonation is on the low side but doesn't bring the beer down at all. Glad to finally taste this, the benchmark of the style."
"D: A bit drying and metallic on the finish, so not perfect, but good."
"This ale is at least on the level of Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout and could have another or two. This one will probably show up in my regular rotation."
"Smell great too, it smelled.. wel.. nutty! And there was a big apply aroma in there that was so interesting. Taste was wonderful as it was incredibly drinkable and was full of complexities. Nutty, malty and apply but light as well. At times the mouthfeel was a bit stingy but other than that it was a solid brew. I would buy it again."
"Overall, really solid NBA, almost perfect. Not one thing grabs me as being outstanding - but indeed is a nicely crafted nut brown ale."
"From notes at Old Chicago (2001). Poured from bottle (no date) into english pint glass. Appearance: dark reddish, amber. head settles to a 1/4"" thick foam sitting on the beer Aroma: maltiness dominates, bready aroma is subtle Taste: there is a light sweetness, an almost creaminess that dissipates quickly Palate: smooth and slick, this beer feels great. medium body. Overall: this brew is smooth and tasty."
"Delicious!"
"This is a perfect example of a beer that tastes very different @ 38-40 degrees than at 45-55 degrees. Serve at 55 according to the website. I think in this beer the nutty flavors come through more once the brew has warmed up a bit. Also the bitterness isn't as sharp and uninviting. Served at the right temp this beer is great! Great Beer Samuel Smith Old Brewery!!"
"M: Thin body, a little syrupy with light carbonation."
"Super clear brown liquid with a light cocoa head. Decent retention and nice lacing. Smell is wonderfully sweet and malty with molasses and the namesake nuttiness. Some dark fruitiness, soupcon of butterscotch, and a bit of floral hops. Taste is rich with roasted and toasty flavors. Sweet brown bread starts and flows into nuts and roasted grains with a slight metallic edge. Yeasty fruit esters and a touch of vanilla. Clean slightly dry finish leaves some tea leaves and graham. Feel is medium weight with a semi crisp and smooth persona. Restorative and quenching at the same time.. Goes down so well but the complexity begs for savoring. a superb session ale."
"My first food suggestion is to try Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale with a true Camembert from Normandy, France. Make sure that it is nice and ripe too, or the flavor will be too mild, and missing the great earthy quality that will compliment the beer so well. Between the breadiness in the beer and the creaminess of the cheese, the combination of Nut Brown and Camembert is a liquid grilled cheese experience! Various meats will balance harmoniously with Nut Brown, especially if they have some caramelization or sear on the outside. Roasted duck, Steak au Poivre, or even seared salmon are all great pairings."
"Final thought - Good beer, but I wouldn't buy another unless they had no other good beer"
"Overall- Good brew, once again Samuel Smith has not let me down."
"D- on a cold evening i would have no problem sitting back and sipping a few of these. very well done!"
"D - Great complexity and balance, with a lower abv. I could definitely drink a few of these."
"This is a very well done and easy drinking brown ale. The nuttiness is really quite pronounced and well done."
"This is a great brown ale! If you're looking for a legit example of the style, this is definitely it. Recommended."
"Crisp and clean the beginning drinks better than the finish."
"It's a pretty darn tasty brown. Not explosive in any facet, but well-balanced - simple yet distinct."
"I could drink these all night long with no qualms, the phenomenal taste makes it feel like you're drinking a glass of cinammon shortbread. This is one of the best brown beers I have had, and others should strive to achieve the notoriety that this one has!"
"I don't really love anything about the beer in particular. However, the fact that it doesn't taste bad in anyway and it's easy to drink I'd put this beer right in the middle of the pack. On a side note I feel that the bottle implies a heavy, thick, high alcohol % beer. The fact that it's not also negativity affects my overall opinion."
"D - Very drinkable, full of flavour (but not overwhelming) and an excellent example of the style. Highly recommended to any fan of Brown Ales and I most certainly will be trying more of the Samuel Smith offerings."
"Drinkability: I love this beer! I could go for another couple. The only thing that I can possibly criticize would be the formidible sweetness within."
"D: Extremely drinkable. One of the best beers I have ever had. Definitely will be buying more of this soon."
"Mild malts hit the tongue with a light sweetness amidst an effervescent carbonation. Fruit notes return on the swallow and linger for a relatively long finish. Feel is decent for the style, perhaps a bit thinner than average as for body, yet with enough texture to balance the malts adequately. Offers a hint of woody hops as the beer warms and finishes clean without any bitterness or alcohol in sight. Drinks swiftly as a result."
"D: Nice. Really like this one as one of Samuel Smith's classic styles. Not as good as Rogue's Hazelnut Brown or other American crafts of this style I've had, but tastes like history in a glass."
"Very English ale; well worth having; expect it to lean toward a strong ale"
"Overall/notes - Excellent! I've been looking for a nut brown ale to truly enjoy, and finally, here it is. I've never felt quite as refreshed after drinking a beer as I did after this one. Definitely getting a few more int he nar future."
"D: Good brew, not super robust. Although I am not a huge brown ale fan."
"Pours a clear, dark reddish brown colour with a good amount of head. Tastes of slight malt character with a nutty earthy tone finish to it. Lacks overall flavour, but its decent and there is no really bad after taste. Just nothing is wowing me from this beer to bring it into a A category."
"D: Goes down slow and smooth, drinkable, but it has a unique flavor that I just don't dig. It's less drinkable as it's a bit strange..."
"A fine beer, I need to go to England, grab some local brews and then re-review for style."
"Summary - One of my favorites. Fantastic beer that many brewers should imitate."
"The taste was very smooth, low hopped, nutty, a faint bready taste, light malts. It was not as ""thick"" as I had anticipated, more of a medium bodied beer. It is very drinkable."
"Tastes are complex. Bitter but yet there is plum and prune. Earthy and malt but yet caramel, nut, and hazelnut. Biscuit-like flavor as well. Creamy, well-to-over carbonated. Better if it sits a bit. Excellent beer."
"Conclusion- This is by far the best beer I have ever smelled..not tasted..smelled. Don't get me wrong, the taste is good, but it's hard to follow a smell so incredible as this. This is a very Christmas-y beer and would be great to be enjoyed during the holidays. Could possibly be a late fall beer as well. Anyways, this is a great beer and don't pass it up!"
"M/D: Very soft, smooth mouthfeel. Not a very thick, chewy beer, but it is by no means watery or thin. The beer goes down easily and is somewhat refreshing."
"Pours to an amber-brown color, brilliant clarity and a very generous and lacy buff head. Aroma is earthy, nutty and malty. Flavor is a nice mild blend of sweet, toffee-like malt and mild, earthy bittering hops to balance. Mouthfeel is medium-light and moderate CO2. Overall, a very well-made Brown."
"Drinkability: I love a good brown ale and this is one of the best. Always a treat to get to enjoy this one."
"Drinkability: Fantastic beer, not much too improve upon. I like the dark malt flavor that is akin to their oatmeal stout. It mixes with nut flavor and amber malts to produce an interesting brew."
"Poured from the tall skinny bottle into my Ommegang schooner. Deep ruby brown color and beautiful two finger head. The nutty (imagine that) aroma was nice. The taste was of butterscotch and malt with a slight kiss of hops. The mouthfeel was medium heavy and the drinkability was high. Easy to drink and a nice brew in-general. I felt like I was in a pub."
"I read the reviews before picking one up and it certainly justifies the props. Not cheap at my bottle shop, but Ill be grabbing another one in the near future nonetheless."
"D - Because it's less powerful, I could see drinking several of these and have no problem finishing a bottle."
"D: Definitely a great example of a brown ale, and a highly drinkable one at that. Not sweet or high in alcohol"
"Pours a mahogany brown with a two finger cream colored head. Good retention throughout. Nice aroma. Toffee, nuts and a bit of chocolate and coffee. Malty flavor. Toffee right off the bat, a little dark fruit malt and then finishes with the nutty flavor which lingers a bit into the aftertaste. A very creamy mouthfeel."
"500 ml bottle. Pours dark red to brown with a thick foamy head. Nose is sweet nutty caramel malt with no noticeable hops. Medium to full body. Palate is of earthy hops, coffee, balanced by nutty juicy malt, hints of sherry. Finish is unremarkable. On the whole, it is wonderful Brown Ale"
"more of the nuttiness to flavor when the beer gets more warmth and at the end and finish. Not super dry, has sweet with a bit of tartness to finish as well. Very drinkable. Medium on weight with a clean moderate mouthfeel. Enjoyed this one. Pretty solid example of style, not overly complex but simple and very well done."
"D: good nut brown, but I have had better. fine session beer and very easy to find almost anywhere."
"Overall I was expecting something a bit more flavorful, especially in the finish, and a thicker body. Perhaps the food I was eating threw the body off for me, but it seemed a lot thinner than what other people have noted. I'll definitely be trying this again."
"The taste clearly follows the aroma but with a stronger roasted maltiness. The nutty flavor is present but not overly potent; just a slight bitter aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with medium carbonation over a fairly light body. Very drinkable. The best brown ale I've had so far."
"D: One of my favorite nut browns."
"This beer pours a deep amer color, with a slightly off white head. The aroma smells of english earthy hops, there is also a sweet malty note. The flavor is sweet, and ends with a nutty malt note. There is also a good mild english hoppiness to back up the malt. The mouthfeel is medium light, and is drinkable."
"Notes: my first 'nut' brown ale, like a new castle on a nut diet...exceptional"
"Pours a dark chesnut brown (surprised?), lighter orange around the edges when held to the light. Creamy and slightly offwhite head, with some dense retention. Nose is nutty , with some maple and light chocolate. Dominated by the nuts, but has some darker bread and cereal here too. Light metallic finish, creamy with medium carbonation. High drinkability, a definite winner and something that should be kept year round in the fridge."
"Even as someone who has a taste for hops, I find this highly drinkable. Samuel Smith's managed to counter the sweet maltiness with some dryness and hints of aromatic hops, making it a mellow, easily quaffable drink."
"D - Drinkability is high. A beer full of flavor and complexity given the alcohol. Besides the bitterness in the middle, the alcohol is masked well. If there were a way to amp up the thickness of this beer, it'd be great."
"Color was a medium brown with an almost fizzy head. Aroma was mostly malt and not too overwhelming. Flavor as well had a good balance but there was nothing about it that I was blown away by. Overall, an ok beer but not one of choice for me."
"Interesting for sure. I think I like some of the American Brown Ales better but I do like the unique tangy background of this beer."
"This beer pours a light orange/brown color with a decent off-white head that has good consistency. It stays around for a good while. It has smells of sour fruit with caramel/toffee notes. Also smells a bit nutty in the middle of the nose but just slightly. Taste is sour and bitter to begin with. then there is a touch of fruity sweetness. There is a toasted characteristic appearing towards the finish. Its well carbonated yet smooth and surprisingly creamier that I anticipated. It washes over nicely. This beer is highly drinkable. I could drink this all night. Wish I could get it in six packs. Its a little pricey at 3.99 a pint. Well worth the money though, in my honest opinion."
"Its not too thick or overly carbonated; a very satisfying beer."
"Immortality rings through my inner-ear when I think about ways to describe this ale. A delightful smell combined with a rich, dark hue concoct one of the boldest nut brown's I have had the pleasure of trying. Not to mention Samuel Smith's are so classy."
"Overall, I'm not impressed with this Nut Brown Ale. I wouldn't want another one."
"Head created by the pour was three fingers of oak brown thick bubbles. Exceptional lace cling, like glue. Color is a 26 on the SRM Beer Color chart. Enchanting smell of butter, butterscotch, walnut, and cashews. Tastes of toffee, nuts, caramel, rye bread, peanuts, and malt. Very robust mouthfeel as it rolls around my mouth and over my teeth and tongue. The more I taste this beer the more I want more. Great flavor for the price."
"D: The beer is decently drinkable, but the high level of carbonation really hurts it. The taste has enough complexity and is tastey enough for the beer to be worth drinking."
"A tasty, quaffable brown ale that blows Newcastle out of the water and provides a good amount of malty flavours with a very light bitter finish to make this oh so easy drinking."
"Sam Smith's Nut Brown Ale appears a robust deep brown color. Cherry highlights are appreciable when the glass is held up to light. The toffee colored head rises up to a modest two to two and a half fingers in size, and hangs around for a minute. Lacing is barebones, a little bit of a disappointment. The nose is malty and quite good. Biscuits and toasted nuts, with a nice dollop of caramel. As I first sip, my impression that the flavor is more of the same. Hops that didn't come through in the nose show up here though, added by a deft hand. The bitterness is appreciable, but mild, and a slight herbal note closes the beer. An unexpected, but welcome addition to the usual malty notes. The body is very smooth, it almost reminds me of an oatmeal stout. Carbonation is appropriately low for the style, but at times I almost feel like the beer comes across as flat, it could stand to be inched just a tiny bit higher. Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale is a fine beer, this four pack didn't last long in my fridge."
"D - Pretty high. Nice abv and quite warming for a cold night."
"Poured from a 550 mL bottle into an authentic Sam Smith pint glass. Beautiful deep brown/red color as it poured with a hint of caramel and malts in the aroma. Very good head which dissipates slowly. Beautiful lacing as I kept sipping on this delicious brew. Mouthfeel is truly wonderful, hint of malts with a nice nutty, caramel flavor. Leaves a very good aftertaste with beautiful silky complexion. Drinkability is VERY good...one of the best brown ales I have had. Another solid beer from Sam Smith's, highly recommended."
"D- Due to the multifaceted flavor and the medium mouthfeel this is a nut brown ale that could be enjoy in numeration without issue."
"The smell hints sweet nutty malt flavors, just like the name promises. The taste is phenomenal, just like the other types of beer from that brewery.The taste of roasted malts brings along the nutty earthy feel combined with hints of coffee and caramel, yet it is immediately balanced with an equal amount of bitterness from the hops. Very nicely measured, creating a unexpected freshness, which invigorates. Great prickly mouthfeel, very fresh , even so the beer has a creamy feel to it. Very drinkable, I could just imagine, how good this beer would be an fresh tab.What a great job!!!"
"D - You'd have no problem downing these. They are very straightforward beers...the cost is a bit high for it though. I'd be better off with Newcastle."
"not very hoppy or bitter which is good. has an almost creamy feel in the mouth. would definitely drink again. its like a lager in ale form. great in the winter time when you need a thicker beer without the heavy alcohol taste."
"D - Easily drinkable, but not even clost to a early choice. Many better options avqailable."
"Notes - If it was a little more thick, this would likely be one of my favorite all-time brews. As is, it's still an excellent way for me to embrace my inner Englishman."
"I would recomend this to anyone who likes brown ales."
"Overall, a purely wonderful brew although the nut additions are slightly understated (perhaps i drank it too cold). the sweetness is quite nice however, and assists in the overall drinkability"
"Drinkability - Pleasant, enjoyable, and subtle beer."
"The price is pretty solid, 3 bucks for a pint. I dunno not my thing and I hat to really disagree with the rest of you but this beer was below average, and SS's is making me a really disappointed drinker lately."
"Drinkability. Very easy to drink. Goes great with a burger or steak. No harsh alcohol taste. Very gentle and clean. An overall enjoyable and refreshing beer. I'd buy it again."
"I don't often drink Samuel Smith products but I always enjoy them when I do. It is good to see this old, world class brewery using brown bottles. Next, I hope they use freshness dating."
"Folks, if you ask me this is twice the beer Newcastle Brown Ale is, plus it's less likely to be skunked since they use brown glass for Sam Smith's. Choose the Nut over the Castle."
"Pours a dark copper color with a delicious frosty 2 inch head. The aroma is delightful with hints of nuts and crispy fresh fruits. The first sip is amazing. The second sip is even more amazing. This is the best dark brown ale I've ever had. Sight caramel and nuts with small bit of cider. It's so delicious I want another glass asap. This beer is freakin' great. I would drink this until I die. I'm going to drink this in the afterlife. I love you, Sam Smith."
"D- makes me full would go good with thanksgiving dinner of course. split a bomber with someone and enjoy it for what it is."
"Something I could not get tired of drinking."
"Drink well my friends"
"Drinkability: Excellent beer. Very tasty and drinkable."
"D- An incredibly drinkable Brown ale. I could easily consume several of these in a session!"
"D: English Brown Ales are not really my thing--too sweet, not enough hops--as I prefer mine on the dry side. But I liked the brandy and sour fruit."
"d-great drinkablity this is one of my new favorites"
"drinkability; this taste so good and goes down so smooth. The aftertaste makes one beg for more. I could easily see myself drinking this all night long."
"This is a good, warming and nutty ale. It has a good balance of flavor that is complex and subtle. There is a lingering bitterness that leaves you wanting more."
"D - I admit I'm fairly biased here, as my go-to styles tend to be less thought-provoking. And so by default I expect not to drink a few of something so thought-provoking. That said, each taste beckons another, so maybe a few would be in order after all"
"medium body/carbonation; a bit watery. very drinkable."
"Pours a deep brown colour with a thick cloud of white head and some lacing. Smells of toasted nuts and toffee. Flavour is quite sweet and nutty with some mild bitterness. Lots of toasted hazelnut flavour in the aftertaste. Carbonation is quite nice, very smooth. One of my favourite brown ales."
"Notes: Had high expectations for this, and was still blown away by it. Had heard so much about Sam Smith's Oatmeal stout which was very good, but IMO this blew it out of the water. I'm very curious to see what else this great English brewery has to offer because so far they've delivered on all fronts."
"Drink - I could drink this every day for the rest of my life. A terrific beer that I will continue to drink as long as I can track it down"
"taste is a little sweet but well balanced, nutty. body is super smooth with a creamy head. excellent drinkability, its the ultimate session beer. I would agree with the rankings that its the top of the style"
"A good low alcohol brown ale with a rich maltiness and complex flavor that never fails to please. A lot of brown ales have a high alcohol content which takes away from the malt flavor but not in this case. This is a beer that lets those malty and nutty flavors come through."
"Nice creamy low carbonation, body could be thicker."
"Poured into a tulip. The beer had a beautiful cap, deep brown body and heavy lacing. The aromas are initially muted, though later uncover some molasses. The body is thick and sticky to the mouth with a residual sweetness. The flavours and dominated by molasses and licorice, not expected and enjoyable. The only weakness to this beer in my opinion is that the carbonation is too strong which is biting to the mouth... A wonderful drink."
"Would make a great session beer, perhaps a good intro to craft beers as brown ales tend to be on the mild side. Highly recommended."
"Overall, a great sipping beer with a variety of flavors. Highly recommended and reasonably priced."
"D- Couldn't be much easier to down. The biggest flaw of this drink is that the best part of it is in the aftertaste."
"Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy. Fine carbonation that makes it very pleasant to drink. Overall, probably the best known beer of this style out there. I like it quite a bit and would have it again."
"Mouth feel wise, it is medium bodied, plenty of carbonation, and leaves the palate somewhat powdery dry."
"D-I love this brew and so should you"
"D - a great one to spend some time with. and maybe repeat once or twice afterwards"
"Pours nicely into a pint glass, decent if somewhat thin head that dissipates fast, leaving a small lace. Very deep brown tea color. Smells of typical malted ales. Flavor is decent but somewhat ""soft", a very smooth english style ale. Mouthfeel is thin, with flavors of mild, barely roasted malt. Not real interesting or complex, but an easily drinkable session beer. I can't say much more about it, it's just average. I give it a solid 6 of 10, FAR better than any crap American stuff (bud light, coors, etc.) but nothing I would hunt for."
"Medium brown colour with a head that sticks around for about 30 seconds. The smell is mainly yeast with a bit of sweetness, I didn't like it much. The taste starts of a little weak, but it builds into a dark sweetness and has a bitter aftertaste. Overall, I kinda like it."
"It's very easy drinking. And I'll certainly give it another go on another day."
"On the back label they quote famed connoisseur Michael Jackson calling their nut brown ale, ""...the richest, maltiest and nuttiest of brown ales," and that's a pretty good description!"
"This is a very drinkable Ale it is perfect for a night of drinking cause of the light easy taste. It's very well rounded in flavor with nothing to overpowering and the fact that it is not over carbonated means you can drink more with out the bloated feeling."
"This is a good brown ale. I was a bit surprised by the tartness and apple notes but it comes together well."
"D - Light enough in flavor and ABV to have a few. Great to try again!"
"Pours a dark brown, somewhat like a coke. Head was tan and healthy. Aroma was a little on weak side, but I could get some malty molasses aromas from it. Taste was more bitter than sweet. A mix of nuttiness, roasted hops, with a dash of sweetness. Good body, not too thin but could be a little thicker. With the exception of the bottle size, a great anytime beer."
"It has a nutty buttery finish, YUM!!! Highly recomended"
"Drinkability gets my lowest rating for this beer - as my fellow people of color say, it's a'ight. It would have been better with something other than my turkey club sandwich."
"Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale is the basis for the originator of the Nut Brown style ale, and as such is a very fine example for others to follow. Of the other copies, I would say only Rogue's Hazelnut Brown can compare. This ale has a very nice dark brown color that calls for you to drink in deeply. The smell is very bready and caramelly. To me it smells like sweet dough my grandfather used to make with notes of vanilla, butter, and molasses. The beer tastes very malty and thick layers of flavors form the highly kilned malts, but finishes dry with an astringent, toasted walnut bitterness. Hops are subdued and the mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Very drinkable and delicious"
"Final Notes: A rather interesting flavor for a brown ale. The taste is rather complex but the initial sourness is a bit too much. A very sessionable beer and one that I would drink with a nice tart dessert."
"D: The finest nut brown I have ever had. A pleasure from start to finish"
"Not totally convincing, it seems a bit sweet and heavy."
"Mild head with little lace. Pale brown color; very clear. More malty than anything, but there is also a slight touch of metal to the smell. This is a malty offering in the brown ale category. I like the smooth and clean feel to the beer. Full body for the style with a modest amount of carbonation. When this fresh, this is a superior nut brown. I worry about the clear glass and the possibility of skunking."
"This is a great beer."
"One can't help but admire Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale's bottle, with enough moulding on the glass to lend it elegance, without being guady. It's sturdy glass, with simple labels that seem a touch olde-timey. The beer has a course pour, and after an initial flush of head, it dies down to the tan ring. The beer is a opaque red-brow, almost like oak. It smells fruity like freshly ground nutmeat. It's the malts that stand out when you drink it though, thick on your tongue as syrup. I'm disappointed about the lack of nutty hints - it isn't much of a brown ale without some nuttiness to it. There's barely detectable undercurrent of apple that I missed in the first few sips. It has a fine mouthfeel, and the carbonated bite is minimal. Rather, this beer has a watery, clean finish. Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale would excel as in many other beer styles, but is a weak entry in the field of brown ales."
"Overall: See drinkability. Truly a great beer."
"D: Not my favorite but good for a brown. Good flavor but not enough carb. Just not feeling this one. Better than Newcastle though..."
" The name of the beer says it all. What a perfect simple description, NUT BROWN ALE."
"Drinkability: Very sessionable and I think it would be great on tap or pulled from a cask. Good with a meal (bangers and mash) but good for sipping or drinking alone as well."
"Drinkability: The initial smooth, rich malts paired with the fairly carbonated, hoppy finish create a simple, yet great brew."
"Drinkability: Classic English Brown Ale. Not my favorite style, but this is what others should be measured against."
" The grassy hops are the first thing that hits my palate, followed by a moderate dose of that caramel and nutty malt. Mild bready grain rounds out the finish. It tapers off pretty quickly. The body is a little thin for my taste, but definitely in line with the traditional English brown ale. Very nice, but not one of the most interesting releases from Samuel Smith."
"The body is a bit light, but the carbonation could be throwing it down a little. Otherwise, this has a clean mouthfeel and they go down easily. Sam Smith is THE classic nut brown. Very few come close to this one."
"very light, barely noticeable carbonation, smooth, goes down easy, little taste on the back. very drinkable, this would be a wonderful beer to enjoy with some friends on a slow, talkative night. love it!"
"Pours a clear reddish-brown with a huge and active off-white head that bursts with bubble activity and slowly fades with some curvy fingers of lace left in it's wake. Aroma consists of caramel malts and a subtle light fruitiness. Tastes sweet, slightly nutty and spicy (cinnamon) with a furtive piny hoppiness. A bit thin on the palate but fairly complex overall."
"Drinkability is good, I'd be perfectly happy to drink these all night"
"This is a top shelf brown ale, truly a measuring stick for this style. Easily could session this all night."
"D - this is a great nut brown, a fine balance between the rich roasty nutty flavours and sweetness boost the drinkability, and a little bitterness provides even more complexity. Well done!"
"Highly Recommended."
"D: Expectations dashed, though this is still a pretty good brown ale in terms of style. Probably one of the best. I've only had a few, including Newcastle brown ale, and this one is just as good as that one. Fairly drinkable, but not as great as I would have thought. I'd have this again, but I won't bend over backwards to get it."
"D- Absolutely my favorite brown ale, if not one of the top couple beers I've ever had. Just so well rounded and well crafted. A piece of art."
"This stuff is definitely one of the most enjoyable English beers I've had. I'm generally not a fan of most beers from the UK, but it would be hard to deny Samuel Smith's Nut Brown. This beer comes out as one of the best couple brown ales I've ever had and would certainly make for a wicked session beer."
"this is a sweet complex brown ale with a noticeable nutiness (hence the name).. this is a typical english complex malt with light floral hops sort of beer.. everything about this beer is just about perfect.. nice complexity, a slight crispness that evens off the sweetness also a touch of delightful bitter roastiness.. if you have tried newcastle you should deffinately try this to see the difference.. it is truly a revelation - everything a brown ale should be.. and despite the bad bottle.. this at least brings back memories of all the pleasant past experiences I have had with this and other samuel smith beers."
"Overall a disappointment. It's just not very good."
"For someone who appreciates a smooth & well-rounded, but very flavorful beer, this one is excellent. If you're looking for bolder flavors, you might be disappointed, but is far as a balanced taste is concerned, it's hard to beat."
"Pours a ruby brown/mahogany color with minimal beige head. Lots of sweet caramel up front followed by a plum note. Some chocolate and lots of dark fruit in the form of plums, raisins, and black cherries in the taste. I really like the mating of the tart taste and the sweet nutty malts. The taste is really enjoyable and the finish is clean. I wasn't expecting much as I'm not really a fan of the style, but this beer is pretty impressive."
"CHEERS!!"
"Pours a beautiful dark, tawny red with a fine head. Somewhat elegant in flavour. Some dried funky strawberries and a bit of oatmeal and huskiness on the nose mirrored by sweet malty goodness. Superbly long finish. Don't agree with the serving suggestions on the bottle- pairing with Thai or Malaysian food would be a mistake. Far too malty, viscous sweet for such food. Pub lunch of steak with a sweet jus would be more the go. A fine beer."
"This is my favorite brown ale by far. I always want to drink another and can't ever have enough. Almost a perfect 5 for drink-ability. Samuel Smith's is always a go to beer when I can't make up my mind. I think of them as the Sierra Nevada of England in the way that their beer is always on point to style, and is of the best quality."
"Maybe I had an odd experience with this or I just wasn't in the mood to try this for the first time. I feel a little strange giving it a less than stellar review when most people seem truly blown away by this beer. It was everything I expected I guess, nutty, caramelly and sticky in feel. Nice deep brown in color. I just really didn't enjoy the taste that much, I drank half a bottle and didn't really want the rest. I also had it with a meal (mexican) and this was probably poor planning. I'll try it again in better circumstances."
"Smith's makes some great beers but this one is merely good."
"D--At 5% a very sessionable beer, especially during the colder months. Complex yet straight forward and incredibly drinkable."
"D- if they still sell it i will go at least 1 time a week for one or two of this one, very good brew, a clasic"
"I poured into a pint glass to two fingers of tan head. It leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. It is brown in color. It has a sweet buttery toffee aroma. The taste is more of roasted malt and is then followed by some sweetness. The hopsprovide enough bitterness that offset the sweetness. It tastes better than I recalled. The mouthfeel is decent. Its a pretty good beer. I prefer their Taddy Porter, but that's the kind of guy I am."
"This is a great representation of a British Brown Ale. I will certainly return to this drink"
"D: Very drinkable. Great Fall season session beer."
"Definitely the best brown ale I have had thus far."
"A British icon. The S.S. Nut Brown is a classic example of the characteristics produced by the Yorkshire Squares."
"Quite enjoyable overall, an easy-drinking almost-session beer with plenty of character, though slightly rough around the edges."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is very much sessionable."
"An authentic British Ale. Simply delicious! Light in alcohol and balanced bitterness, dry taste, strong smell and taste of roasted malts. I really recommend it."
"One of the best brown ales I've tried so far. I grabbed it out of the fridge because it has been sitting around for awhile (not because I was really compelled to drink it), but I was pleasantly surprised. I'll be picking this up again."
"Notes: I'm a big fan of brown ales, and I'm glad that my 50th beer review is one of the best out there."
"Very crisp mouthfeel with a slightly thin body and mouthfeel."
"This is, possibly my favorite beer yet. A quintessential brown ale. Fabulous. A must for anyone who likes the maltier brew."
"could drink a few of them for sure, not a beer i would drink for a marathon though."
"D: Very drinkable. The taste keeps you wanting more. Helps that it's a low abv %. I could see myself downing a lot of these in a pub somewhere in England."
"Highly drinkable- I could down a few of these larger bottles if the night called for it."
"Impressions: I like it, probably one of the best brown ales, and an all around good beer."
"This is a highly drinkable, enjoyable and delicious ale."
"Drinkability - This beer has a lot going for it, other than the tartness which doesn't seem to fit. The tartness doesn't overstay though. I guess thats the main thing thats holding this beer back to me. I don't think I'll be having another one of these, but I will continue to explore this style."
"d - An above average brown ale. Nice malty/caramel taste to it. Would have liked a little more carbonation. Would have again."
"Pours a slightly cloudy brown color with nice cap of cream colored head with good retention and lacing. Smell is forward of carmel malts, roasted nuts, faint hints of buttery biscuits and slightly astringent. Taste up front is slightly astrigent, moving into a nice blend of mellow carmel malts (not very sweet) with a nice roasted nut charachter, bitter earthy hops round out the taste. Medium bodied, excellent cask like feel. A nice beer with a few muddled, earthy flavors, could have kicked up the malts just a touch."
"D - This is a pleasant drinkable beer. But there seems to be a lot of inconsistency from one batch to the next."
"D- very smooth complementing flavors, nice session beer"
"D - Wow, does this brewery make a bad beer? Just flawless, simple, refreshing, delicious and very drinkable. I could down a 6pack of this brew, just so nutty and buttery, ahh, very very good. I definitely recommend this one, and I would buy another for sure. Cheers!"
"This beer was $3.99 for a 550 mL bottle, so being broke and in school, I won't be drinking it often. But I'm glad I got a shot at trying it, and I think it was quite worth it."
"EDIT: got a second bottle from a different store (so more likely to be from a different batch). This time around the brew lacks the huge fruity aspects I noted before. Instead, it has a sour edge to it with S/T notes of walnut or hazelnut. Much more like a brown ale than before, more like what I expected. Seems to be some significant variation between bottles/ batches."
"D: As noted above, this is top quality on the drinkability scale. World-class example of the style. Best nut brown I've had, hands down!"
"Poured from a 550ml bottle into a pilsner glass. Pours a dark amber with a light tan head. The initial aroma is very nutty, but light at the same time...pleasant. Tastes VERY nutty...almost (don't kill me for saying this) cola-esque. Regardless, its a totally awesome taste and I love it. Ridiculously light, and I could definitely see myself pounding back a ton of these in an evening if I wasn't poor. This is actually the first brown ale I've ever had, and I want more. Its that good."
"Notes: A nice brown ale that is slightly sweet with the malts and slightly bitter. Good amount of nut flavors as the name suggests. Easy drinker and a solid everyday kind of beer."
"D: A great beer to session, and very easily attainable."
"Overall: good beer, nothing over the top but a good drinking beer."
"On a side note, WOAH! Strange, I just grabbed the bottle and almost took a sip. Very odd and rare occasion that happens. Memories and repetitive actions of the past.."
"Na Zdravje!"
"A very flavorful, rich malty beer. Has some nice complexity, but not complicated. A great easy drinking session beer."
"Drinkability - Quite drinkable."
"Overall: All other nut brown ales should bow to this offering from Samuel Smiths. It is everything an English nut brown ale should be. Exceptional character with a remarkable taste. I actually knew then what I know now and that is quality. Only wish I could find it on tap at a reputable establishment in the New York/Philly area."
"D- A really easy drinking beer; could go well with a lot of different foods."
"This is definitely a classic and perhaps the definitive beer of the style. It's extremely drinkable and has good balance. The malts upfront with the nice English hoppiness in the back works well. I would like to see a more pronounced nuttiness from a nut brown ale, however."
"#3 from the sampler pack is the Nut Brown Ale. A lot less nut flavor than I expected, it was more of a secondary flavor. Kind of a ""generic"" brown, I'd rather have a more adventurous beer."
"Extremely drinkable. I understand now why this beer is so highly rated. At this ABV, could easily drink several of these at a sitting."
"D- Slides down the palate perhaps too easily. I can see getting extremely drunk off this beer."
"M/D- medium bodied and creamy, not overly carbonated. good mouthfeel and drinkability. good session brown."
"Very, very drinkable. The poster boy of brown ales."
"Aroma, faint biscuit nut toffee thing going, and that resonates on the taste buds as well. Don't come here looking for hops or bitterness. Mouthfeel maintains, doesn't grow or subside, a little pricey and bland on the drinkability scale."
"In conclusion, this is a great beer, and by far the greatest brown ale I have ever tried."
"Slightly bitter in the back but overall good. Medium to full bodied, a mild roasty flavor with some caramel and sweetness in there. Some carbonation in the mouth. Overall a really good beer. Drinkability high and mouthfeel good."
"Overall - Poured from a 500mL bottle, it definitely isn't enough for one person! An excellent example of the style, I daresay the paradigm of nut browns. Samuel Smith's reputation is well deserved and this is no exception. Cheers to the oldest brewery in Yorkshire!"
"A nice nutty aftertaste developes later...."
"I normally love Samuel Smith but I think I'm going to stick to their darker beers that they excel at."
"The prototypical English Brown Ale, veritas, the real deal - the nut adjunct is suitably laid back, and the hops are just there to make sure that you aren't scared away by this little adjustment. Wow, it's hard to describe the subtly of the old-world styles sometimes, engineered as they are for drinking, and perhaps not explicit contemplation."
"Samuel Smith is becoming one of my favorite breweries. The Nut Brown Ale is one of the best Samuel Smith beers I've had to date. It pours a dark amber color and has a nice creamy head. The beer itself is relatively sweet. It isn't until the aftertaste that you can really taste the nut flavor. The aftertaste is only slightly bitter. This is an exceptional beer. It's probably one of my favorites now."
"550ml bottle from the LCBO. Pours a russet reddish brown with a finger of tan head and strings of lace. Subtle grassy hops on the nose, a little bit of maple and pancake, roasted nuts in the background. Taste is sweet dark malts, caramel, a mild mix of almond and walnut, spicy English hops, and a toasted malty graininess to finish. Last time I noticed some pecan and molasses, but I'm not getting either here. The flavour is much more subdued than I remember. Creamy mouthfeel, crisp carbonation, dry bite mid-body, lightly tart aftertaste. A well-balanced brown ale."
"D - Very good brown ale which I am looking forward to having again in the future."
"M/D: this is the type of beer that must be paired and really is one and done in my opinion. Cabonation is a little strong, and lingers on the palate with a thick finish. If I had a preference the finish would be a little more sugary, but this works for the style."
"550ml bottle served in my Samuel Smith nonic. Poured a translucent reddish brown with a 2.5 inch cream-colored, rocky head. Lots of tiny bubbles effervescing in solution. Head eventually settles into a consistent quarter inch cap with concentric bands of lacing coating the glass during the session. This beer looks great in a glass - makes you feel like you're at the pub. Nice malty nose - a little bit of caramel, a little nutty, but aromas are nicely coalesced and subdued. Taste consistent with nose; however, I also get some spent teabags in the middle before culminating in a slightly sweet and malty/nutty finish. Mouthfeel is light-medium, but falling much closer to the light side of the spectrum, with a subtle and smooth background carbonation - very well-balanced. This beer pretty much sets the benchmark for English Brown Ales. A top notch session beer; however, a bit pricey for what it is in my opinion."
"Awesome."
"Final Thoughts: I'll be honest, I prefer more of a malt and fruity presence in my brown ales, and less nutty bitterness. This beer is very good, and I can see why it is widely regarded as one of the best English Brown's out there. Still exceptional, but probably the one I liked the least from the mix pack."
"Notes: This is one of my favorite nut brown ales. I had it first at BLT Steak in NYC with a filet mignon served with bernaise sauce. The trifecta of flavors was perfect."
"D= very drinkable if you can carry enough of these large US$2.99 single-bottles that never seem to come in 6-packs or cases."
"Overall, this is a benchmark among English browns (mainly for English-style browns brewed by American breweries, cuz, let's face it, England is not going to come out with a brown that can rival AleSmith's Nautical Nut any time soon). In short, if you can't brew something comparable to this, start over and try again. A great brown that balances out beautifully. If there were any justice in the world (and there isn't), this would be OUTSELLING Newcastle Brown with nooo problem."
"Value: Excellent. I think the Samuel Smith brews are some of the best I've had and they are very reasonably priced."
"Nice creamy off white cap atop a dark brown body that appears light brown when held towards a light source. Nutty aroma, toasted brown bread and a metallic note. Same metallic taste noted in the taste with light brown sugar, dark toasty malt and pralines. Mouthfeel is a bit thinand the body isn't as full as others in it's class. A good example of an English brown."
"Dots the i's and crosses the t's."
"d - I drank my 550ml bottle and felt very happy about the beer. i wish i would have drank this with a home cooked meal, i will buy a few more bottles next time i find it."
"D: It's a decent beer. I found it to be to thin/watery and the smell/flavours were good, but not great. Nothing special imo."
"Notes: One of the best nut browns I've had. Not as much nut character as some, but that's fine by me. Samuel Smith has never disappointed me."
"Taste: Pecans, vanilla along with complex caramel, maple, and buttery combine up front to form a wonderfully sweet brew. A good bit of pear in there too. Some brown bread. Quite smooth but the carbonation and bitterness balance out the sweetness after a few sips. The finish is slighty bitter, quite dry, and deliciously nutty (walnuts)."
"This beer is a medium-dark reddish brown. It pours with a very thick head, and it has a moderate roasted malt aroma. The taste is very malty, with good bit of roasted malt present. Very subdued hoppiness, without tasting excessively sweet. due to the roasted malt. This tastes a lot like a light porter might taste. On the whole, a very nice beer, very well crafted with nothing out of place."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a creamy beige head that sticks around forever. Smells of brown bread, a touch of dark fruits, a bit of sulfur, and a hint of honey in there as well. Taste is malty with bread and some light fruits, a little butter with a touch of bitterness or astringency in the finish. I get an almost ashy taste and texture every now and again which seems really weird in this beer. Medium to full body, medium level of carbonation, a creamy mouthfeel. Not a bad brew, but not one of my favorites. It grew on me towards the end of the glass, but given the price and my palette I'll probably pass in the future."
"Part of a gift pack poured into pint glass provided. Clear chestnut brown color with a creamy light tan head that hangs around a long time before turning into a film. Nice nutty aroma. A nice nutty flavor too, to me this is one of the better examples of a nut brown ale. Very smooth in the mouth, goes down real easy."
"Drinkability: Perfect session beer. Great weight, and great texture makes this an everyday drinker."
"D= Awesome session beer. Good flavors not to heavy and not too light. Sweet and hoppy. Well balanced. Such a nice mouthfeel makes it even more drinkable. This beer is great for a session."
"D: As always, I feel like I could finish this Sam Smith in about 3 drinks. Drinkability is nearly off the scale. Sorry Bud Light, not even your marketing savy holds up to this English gentleman!"
"D: this one is a mixed bag. I dont really like it but appreciate its complex qualitries."
"Great french beer overall! Love the Imperial and this lovely nut brown goodness!"
"As usual, Samuel Smith does not disappoint."
"Drinkability- Easliy a session beer."
"MD- Definitely a session beer. Goes down easy. Could have several."
"The aroma is very pronounced with caramel. There's also a little nuttiness in there but also lots of malt. Not much in the way of hops. The taste is very similar to the smell, i.e. dominated by caramel and malt with some nuttiness and not much in the way of hops. Its easy to drink and an enjoyable brew to drink. Its very simple in flavor and I think that's what they are going for, which is kind of nice when one is used to drinking stuff striving to be complex at all times. I like it but will probably not get it again. Definitely give this one a go though... you'll be glad you did."
"Overall thoughts: I believe that in America we have become way to obsessed with making everything more extreme. All the time a new beer is coming out with more hops and more alcohol in the effort to be the most extreme or ""the greatest."" This has caused me to become somewhat burnt out on craft beer. Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale reminds me of how great perfectly crafted and balanced beers can be. This is an excellent ale all across the board. It defines the style and is a must try for all lovers of beer in general."
"Overall - Probably one of the best examples of English Brown Ale, this hits it right out of the park."
"Cheers!"
"Notes: I was expecting a little more umph out of this beer, however keeping in the mindset that it is an example of a classic english style, it represents that image perfectly. Very enjoyable and easily drinkable."
"This ale is extremely tasty and drinkable. Will definitely be a brew I will revisit."
"D - The slight anise flavor throws things off just a bit - did I get a bad beer? A decent beer overall."
"Great brown ale. Good complexity for the style and one that looks like it would be appropriate with a stew or other braised meat-based meals. Creamy cheeses on nut-bread, too. Cheers!"
"Poured a dark golden color with minimal head. The beer has a smooth robust flavor with hints of chocolate, and had a pleasant light hops finish. The aroma of the beer was a little weak but not unpleasant. This is an easy drinking tasty beer, tastes alot like Killian's Irish Red in my opinon. My first experience with an English Brown, will definitely purchase this beer again."
"HIGHLY recomend .Two other beers to try in this set so untill we drink again later ."
"D - This is a fantastic beer; I've never been more pleased with a random selection. This is simply a must-try for beer enthusiasts everywhere."
"If this was cheaper, I'd drink it every day. I'm really looking forward to my next one."
"D- Wonderful. If I could drink any brown ale non-stop it would be Samuel Smith Nut Brown Ale."
"Not bad, but I did not feel it was worth the imported premium."
"Overall, a nice, tasty and simple EBA, but I would take Rogue's Hazelnut Nectar or Black Oak's Nut Brown over this in a second. Still worth a shot."
"D - This is a decent beer, but I was expecting a little more to be honest after hearing such great things."
"A nice mahogany color with a one finger head that left some lacing. The smell is heavy on caramel malt and roasted malt. The taste is pretty much the same but I can taste a little but of hops in there. It has a pretty good mouthfeel and is also very drinkable. An exceptional brew."
"A terrific brew, a great nut brown to savour on a cool fall day. Will be back for more!"
"slightly red brown colour for the body and the same colour foam that all of sam's beers seem to have, off white/cream. the foam is rich and thick retaining for a hefty portion of time. the nose is less than satisfactory: i think i may smell malts, but I'm unsure, I think i do. the taste is astringent, malty, and sometimes sweet; I think this, like most sam smith's should be had over food or at least had in such quantities that the lack of flavour doesnt matter. the feel and drinability are not worth mentioning, just average."
"Notes: I enjoyed it, but wasn't awed by any means. Didn't leave me wanting another much as their oatmeal stout, but I suspect that's because I am a stout man. I would buy it again though if the mood struck me"
"Medium - light body serves this well, easily working through the bottle, would gladly put this with just about any meal. A winner in the style."
"Overall, this is a decent brew but I'm not picking up a whole lot of the complexity that I think other reviewers have. Still, a good, enjoayable beer."
"This beer is one of my English favorites. Classic brown with more flavor than almost any craft made brown. Cool retro bottle and a classic label. Pours perfect and has a nose that makes you feel like your in a pub in England. Head is a tan color with white edges. Good carbonation, but not to much. The taste is rich smooth and caramel roasty treat. Perfect with roast meats. The water must be hard that they use in the brewing of this beer, the mouthfeel is solid. I had this beer years ago when I first started drinking good beer and the flavor too me back to those days when it was an adventure trying new beers. This beer is like going home. Highly recomended."
"D - Fantastic. Easily the most drinkable nut brown ale. Can make a great session beer if needed, but it's even better in moderation I think."
"Deep mahogany brown generously topped with tan foam. A fairly well-retained head that leaves behind sheets of lace the whole way down. Brilliant red highlights when held to the like. Simply gorgeous. Mild aroma of toasted nuts, dark fruit, and brown sugar. Tastes nutty and dry with hints of toffee and plum. Finishes with a solid earthy bitterness. Tastes hearty and wholesome. Medium bodied with low carbonation. Feels smooth and substantial. Pairs wonderfully with beef stew and dumplings."
"Drinkability: A damn good beer and one I would recommend to anyone. It is refreshing, easy to drink, and tasty. Can't really ask for much more than that."
"Drinkability: The smell doesn't show it, but this beer has a very nice balance. The flavor is a bit too strong to session, but it's damn good."
"I really enjoyed this beer. It pours a transparent reddish brown with an off-white, creamy head that maintains itself for as long as you decide to savor the brew. Nose is sweet and complex with hints of banana and caramel. Taste is somewhat roasted with a mild hop bitterness that contrasted the smooth flavor. Mouth feel is medium bodied with a low level of carbonation, goes down smooth! Exceptional drinkability, plenty of flavor without being too filling. Great for enjoying with dinner, drinking at home, or bringing to a party."
"cheers!"
"Good nut brown, smooth with heavy nut flavors - very dry just like all Samuel Smith's I've had."
"Overall, this beer exceeded my expectations. It is a good brown ale. Worth buying. The only part I didn't like was the English part of it and it bringing some skunkiness with it. Still, I like. My big bottle won't be hard to finish."
"Mouthfeel is buttery, smooth and medium to light body."
"caramel colored body serves as an apt preview of things to come. Sweet, complex caramel aroma with a nice nuttiness. Sweet caramel maltiness provides the base with nutty malt notes, earthy floral hops, toffee, and brown sugar. Smooth and refreshing, the kind of beer that requires restraint to keep you from chugging it. Subtle, mild, and utterly English."
"D: a fine and easy to drink brown ale."
"D-This beer is very drinkably. I could have another pint bottle for sure."
"Drinkability - 4.5/5.0 - Very good taste and would definitely try something else from the brand"
"Moderate ABV and stellar smoothness makes this an excellent session beer. I intend to always keep some of this on hand."
"Drinkability: Definitely high marks here. Did not feel overly filled up after finishing the bottle."
"The taste is malty up front, with some nice bread-like flavors and perhaps a hint of some nuts but not a lot. There is an interesting bitterness that seems to be trying to break through and almost edges on being sour - hope this is the hops, not an infection. Overall, though the balance is pretty spot on."
"I love this style and this particular beer. I acknowledge this is not the most popular style, but if there is a better nut brown ale, I hope to find it soon. IMO, Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale is nearly spot on for the style. This beer is what brought me to beeradvocate.com."
"Admittedly this is not my favorite style by a long shot - I don't think I've ever had an English Brown Ale that blew me away. But for what it is, it's a good example of the style and worth trying."
"d - great beer, for the style this is one of the bests I have had after Bear Republic Tribute Brown."
"D -- Very good. The dryness seems like it might become too overwhelming after a while, but there's a good amount of sweetness to balance everything out. Funny that I had a bigger, heavier impression of this in my memory, but it's really not as bold as some of the newer beers around these days."
"D 5.0 - This is a showcase example of a nut brown ale in my experience to date. Here's to my belated buddy Slappy on this brew, as this was his favorite brew and it always brings back good memories!"
"D: Could easily enjoy a couple of these in a night"
"This beer pours a see thru copper colour with nice carbonation that leaves a one finger head with lacing all down the sides,it has aromas of nuts,some subtle fruity hops and a touch of smokey peat,it has an above average mouthfeel with tastes of almonds,walnuts and a tinge of fruity hops which finishes nice and dry, definately a moreish beer."
"Sam Smith's is one of the keystone breweries who consistently craft outstanding beers, many of which are or should be the gold standard in their respective category. Nut Brown is no exception."
"d- good drinkability, i would go so far as to session these, but i'd definately have one or two on a nice occasion."
"Exceptional drinkability. My thoughts kept drifting towards possible food pairings. Mushrooms, beans and other items with ""earthy"" characteristics."
"This is another one of my favorites, and an excellent brew overall."
"D: Great food pairing just to provide refreshment and a break from the flavors of whatever you're eating. Went great with the homemade meatloaf I was having."
"m/d- mouthfeel is med body and med carbonation. drinkability is excellent and i can definatley see making a session out of this stuff. this beer would go great with desserts also ."
"A classic brown ale, made even more special by the nutty hazelnut-like finish. This is one I could drink multiples of in one sitting and one I will revisit regularly."
"Other- THe perfect brown ale in my mind. A shining example of the style."
"I see that others are correct in calling this a classic. I will gladly buy more of these. It is also a great beer to introduce to macro-drinkers, to show them the soft, subtle points of beer that they've been missing."
"A really great beer, lots of layers and flavors throughout. Great body compliments the sweetness with good carbonation and bitterness to balance everything. Amazing beer."
"Good stuff."
"mouthfeel is smooth enough, but overall it doesnt lift this beer to the next level. im starting to think adding the ""nut"" to a brown ale might not be a great thing. i really expect them to deliver and end up disappointed half the time. this is a fairly good beer, but if its a nut brown ale im after i'll pass on this one."
"After reading so many good things, I found this brown ale to be slightly overhyped, but still very tasty. Good but not great."
"Mouthfeel was a little light with not much carbonation. This was a good brown ale that I will likely go to again when I'm in the mood for this style."
"Drink: It's not as strong as I'd like, and considering the terrific smell, the taste leaves something to be desired. Still, I found myself downing gulp after gulp, so it must be doing something right. Nice if you're going to have a few drinks."
"D: YES, another great Samuel Smith on my list. An exceprional Ale. Next round of tasting I will bring on the Oatmeal Stout!!! Actually the first beer where me and RvDoorn didn't agree."
"D: WOW again, this was a truly outstanding brew, my new favorite Brown Ale. Sam Smith's blows me away again, how they pack this much flavor into a brew with alcohol this low is amazing. This is true treat for any beer drinker, incredible balance and drinkability. Try this brew immediately, Sam Smith's time tested brews prove that balance can still stand out in an extreme beer world."
"Overall, it could have been such a fantastic beer, could have... It is not, because the flat bitterness is there way too early. What a pity. But still a decent beer that I would like to drink again in the future"
"Overall, this beer prompted a revelation for me. You should try it if you haven't already. Phenomenal!"
"D - great beer, has been one of my faves, if not my fave, for many years!"
"NOTES: BBCSD-0906-Tim"
"This is a good example of a brown ale that I will be buying again."
"Poured from a bottle into an ale glass. Exceptional nut brown beer with two fingers of tan foam. Lacing is evident but not longlasting. The smell of toasted malt and a hint of sweetness made me stop and smell again before I tasted. Deep rich taste with almost no bitterness, just alittle sweetness. Nice finish with great mouthfeel. The carbonation is very appropriate and feels a good cup of coffee. The drinkability is good, however, I don't think that I could drink more than one or two in one sitting."
"With the low ABV, it makes a great session beer and blows Newcastle away"
"A bit on the bitter side for my taste in brown ales, but overall, a very solid and enjoyable beer. Definitely recommended."
"Drinkability: while it is eminently tasty and not too dense, I don't think I'd consider this a session beer. It's more of one to really savor, and then move on."
"D - Overall this is a tasty, drinkable beer. This is the beer I recommend to my friends that drink Newcastle. This is a great steeping stone beer for that."
"This was delicious with my Cheddarwurst lunch, though I made sure to taste the beer and take notes before eating, it paired nicely."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and bubbly with a nice balanced sweetness to bitterness. The finish is of toasted malts and a little light fruit with a pucker of bitterness. Good straightforward stuff with no real KAPOW but sometimes less is more."
"light to medium body, with astringency and acidity in finish, plus phenols, accentuated by the upfront prickle of carbonation, almost getting a bit fizzy."
"Pours a beautiful brown with a slightly yellow creamy head. Smell is nothing outstanding and expected more. Taste is nutty (obviously), smooth and fine. An excellent summer evening beer that leaves you wanting to crack another as soon as the last mouthful is gone."
"D - Overall, a pretty tasty, drinkable beer. Has a good combination of flavors and isn't overly sweet. Could definitely be enjoyable as a session beer."
"PS- I had to get something in the kitchen and my dog got into my glass and took a couple of sips, he wasn't used to it, but I think he gave it a B+"
"A very nice beer. No huge dominant flavors, but a lot of different flavors and complexity."
"All in all a very drinkable brown ale, and perhaps the most drinkable ""Euro-brew"" I have encountered."
"Mouthfeel is pretty light and thin. I would like a little more body, but it still tastes good to me"
"Yorkshire yeast too harsh and does not leave a memorable taste in the mouth. Creamy head dissipates into inconsistent carbonation."
"Full mouthfeel, just a bit slick, but finishes very tingly. Tasty beer, very drinkable."
"D- Surprisingly versatile for a brown ale. It manages to be sweet without being sugary... if that makes sense."
"I'm a big fan of Sam Smith's Oatmeal and Imperial Stouts and was expecting a heavier brew. This is great, and adheres nicely to the style; completely different from the brewery's other offerings."
"This was an okay beer, just too sweet for me and not the taste I was looking for. Had a sweet strong honey taste. I enjoy the oatmeal stout much more. Glad I only bought one bottle of this to sample. Priced too high for the rather average amount of ABV."
"Great medium bodied beer that is highly drinkable. Can't go wrong with these. A brew that I find myself regularly drinking year round. Easily found on tap for me."
"A simply great brew. I prefer this over Newcastle by quite a bit, and slightly ahead of Rogue's variant as well."
"The brew tastes a bit lacking - nutty with some roasted malt flavors, although the nuttiness is real prevalent throughout the taste and is readily found in the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit light-bodied with some carbonation. It's drinkable, but I find it that overwhelmingly good as indicated by the high grade reviews. This brew could use some improvements in flavor and mouthfeel, but still decent nonetheless."
"I finally tried this amazing beer last night. I've already had the Samuel Smith Porter and Oatmeal Stout; the Brown Ale is equally impressive. Nice smooth, slightly sweet nutty flavor with just a bit of acidic aftertaste. The head on this beer was great. Nice and fluffy, really complimented it nicely. Would have liked a little less carbonation and a thicker mouthfeel. The malts really shine through on this one and it is hard to beat a Brown like this."
"Beer pours smoothly from dark brown 550 ml bottle into pint sized glass making rich cream head that settles slowly. Heavy lacing. Beer is smooth and rich, but not heavy. Smell is malty caramel and slight cinnamon. Taste is maple-ly and clean, with beautiful mouth-feel. This beer strikes a rare balance between rich smoothness and facile drink-ability. A classic, well-deserving of that name."
"This is my session Brown Ale for all time. Splendid from beginning to end. Cheers!"
"This is my first Samuel Smith... Very nice, I'll be back."
"D- Overall a very balanced, well-thought out beer, that is very drinkable, not too heavy or syrupy, not light either. This is what a Brown Ale is all about."
"This beer has been in my fridge for awhile and been room temp to cold back to room temp a few times. I wish I would have drank this immediately because I'm sure it would have tasted better. I still think it is good in all respects. I must try this again sometime soon."
"Mmmm, taste is delightful as most (not all) of the fruitiness in the nose disappear and the acidic and tannic nuttiness comes through in droves. Sweet malts and minerals chime in to make this a pretty interesting brown ale. Not too shabby, I bet this would make a nice cask ale."
"Poured a perfect Imperial pint. Gorgeous. Felt like was back in Oxford, at my favorite English pub, the Eagle and the Child. The brewery's been around since the 18th century, and you feel like you're tasting a bit of Britain's history."
"Comment Great beer. In fact one of the best beers I've had ever."
"A good brown."
"This is one I've been wanting to try for a while but for some reason kept putting it off. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass it pours a brown, really nice dark red color with a nice big off white color head. The nice big head goes down fairly quickly but leaves some lacing down the glass. The smell is sweet, a little nutty, a hint of caramel, a pretty nice aroma overall. Really smooth and creamy, taste is sweet and the nut taste is apparent. No bitterness at all, really easy to drink. Another great beer from Samuel Smith."
"D: I think I found a new favorite. This beer is great, goes down easy and just gets better as my mug gets emptier. It's pretty straight up, there's not too much going on here but what is going on is great."
"D-This is a very drinkable beer, and one that I would probably not tire of if I had to do more than one back to back. It is decent and solid, if a tad bit boring. It is, however, very refreshing and sessionable and given its wide availability, one of the consistantly decent English browns out there."
"Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale is a classic. It's been a while since I've had it and I'm just as impressed today as I was the first time I had it. It's very straight forward and simple. If you're looking for a complex, deep beer, move along. But, if you're in the market for a session beer with a simple yet delicious flavor, this fits the bill. The score probably isn't reflective of actually how good it is. I was close to awarding a '4.5' for score, but it's just not quite deep enough. If only I could award tenths of points. Hey, a guy can dream, can't he? If you haven't picked this up by now, well, there's no time like the present."
"Drinkability is perhaps the best part of this beer, such a simple delicious flavor, with a clean finish and lasting nuttiness. Nothing is overpowering, great balance. Excellent meal pairing with fall flavors."
"D - A taste that deserves praise for it has unique elements and does not dissapoint, w/ lasting flavor from the yeast and caramel malts."
"D: This beer is just oh so delicious. Very well balanced and drinkable almost beyond belief. At 5% ABV it ought to be conceived of as one of the best session beers around, at least in my book."
"a good, solid one here. nothing mind blowing but a good offering and enough flavor to be respectable."
"Pours a bright clear copper color with a decent sized head and average lacing. The smell is very rich. I immediately thought of soy sauce (probably too strong) when I was pouring it into the glass. I can also smell some honey, caramel, and butter. The nut taste comes out in the aftertaste of this beer, and before then its a good sweetness. Carbonation and thickness is solid on this beer. This is a very refreshing beer to drink."
"An old friend which I've never reviewed. Pours a nice slightly reddish brown with a medium height creamy head. Nice typical dry British malt and yeast with a touch of nuttiness and perhaps copper in the nose. Smooth and earthy in the taste department with a creamy finish and a light dry roastiness that indeed tastes a bit nutty. Delicious and straightforward. A touch of residual sweetness in the finish, but moderately dry overall. Spot on for the style, and much less hoppy and than American versions, but there are some gentle earthy hops there. Smooth and creamy, slightly nutty in the mouth. Overall a pleasure to drink."
"More liquid goodness on the tongue, lots of sweet malts, more raisin, tastes almost exactly what it smells like, the hops are earthy and just enough to make this beer incredibly balanced, i am not a huge nut brown guy, but this beer just might convert me. smooth and delicious!"
"Cheers"
"Edit: Later revisited, and didn't substantially change my mind. Added a few comments."
"Overall, an exceptional brew."
"Drink~ Very drinkable & very good. A heavy but clean and crisp ale. Could and probably will have a few of these. Good beer."
"Overall a good beer, perhaps a bit overpriced but good."
"55cL bottle. Pours burnt copper with reddish tinges and a fluffy tan head. Crystal clear. Aromas of toasty malts, nuts (surprise!), and a bit of cocoa. Metallic notes in the background. Tastes of sweet, dark roasted malts, a bit of diacetyl, and a certain earthiness. The roasted malts become astringent on the finish. Medium body with high carbonation that actually detracts from it."
"If someone asks me ""what's the prototypical ale?"" I'd pick Sam Smith's Brown. English brown ale is such a staple beer, so smooth, balanced and refreshing. This one in particular is nearly perfect. Pours a beautiful clear walnut with a substantial white head that never fully recedes. It smells of clean, roasty malt and just a bit of continental hops. Taste is a perfect balance of sweet, nutty and buttery with a pleasantly bitter finish. Good drinking. If I had to pick just one session beer forever, I'd be happy with Nut Brown."
"D=very drinkable and quite sessionable, I could easily enjoy a six pack of these no problem."
"Not really overly interesting or complex, but definitely worth trying."
"A mahogany colored brown ale; definitely on the light end of the color spectrum for brown ale. Remarkably clear for an English ale. Either no bottle-conditioning here or a very flocculent yeast. Very complex aroma with lots of musty leather, coffee and a nutty character. The flavor is complex, too, with echoes of the nuttiness (I'm thinking hazelnut and Brazil nuts.), a bit of coffee with cream, an earthy-oakiness and maybe a touch of marzipan. The finish is tawny with a rustic bitterness mixed with the full body. I seems to remember this coming across drier and not as full. Very, very smooth though and still quite a classic."
"Overall, a very good beer. Looks great, especially the brightness. Brown ales can sometimes be boring but though this tasted and smelled better than a traditional English Brown Ale. Could use some more body and some less carbonation, perhaps served at cellar temperature it would have been better. Could drink a few without complaint."
"Samuel Smith's never fails to disappoint, a fairly simple and enjoyable ale!"
"Pours a dark cherry/brown body with a nice big off white head. The nutty aroma caries a fruity hint with it. It has a nice light airy mouthfeel. Taste starts bitter fruity and finishes a smooth nutty finish. The fruit taste almost reminds me of a grape wine."
"I'm sure it's all been said before. Not the biggest fan of brown ale's but their is nothing to complain about here. Good stuff."
"D- A nice, easy going English beer. Not my favorite from the brewery, but it is smooth and a nice change from all the crazy new American beers."
"Pours a deep brown with a tan head perched atop. Has very nice nut (almond?) overtones mixed with toasted bread. Tastes very nice, strong malt with slight bitterness, nutty aftertaste. Very smooth brew going down. Low abv combined with some really great complementing flavors makes this and easy one to kick back. One of my favorite browns."
"I'm giving this 4.5's across the board. Pours a deep dark amber brown color with a HUGE 4 finger creamy oatmeal colored head. Beautiful looking beer. Leaves a lot of lacing along the glass on the way down. Smells of bread, some nuts, and a little bit of hops. Taste is of dry malts, buttery bread, walnuts, and you can taste the creamyness of the huge head. Wow this is a fantastic beer. Mouthfeel is perfect. Smooth, a little chewy at the end. Mmm. I have heard good things about this beer, and it lived up. Definitely high drinkability! Fantastic."
"16.9 oz. Nice brown/amber pour with an off white head. Aroma is mellow malt and nut tones with toffee, grass. Flavors follow in suit. Nicely carbonated medium body. Drinkability is obviously quite high with this one. One of the best nut brown's I regularly have. Another good one from Sam, er the other Sam."
"D: A very good, iconic English brown ale with exceptionally full flavor but some small flaws in carbonation and aroma that hurt it in the grand scheme of brown ales."
"D - A very drinkable Brown Ale. Its crisp and refreshing qualities give it more of a lager feel than a richer nut ale."
"Good.... but that's it."
"very drinkable and enjoyable. overall its a very good brew that can serve a lot of purposes. great with a wide variety of foods, even can be a little refreshing."
"D: The metallic was off-putting, and in case it was the bottle I would definitely try it again. I love the roasted/toasted notes in this beer and the balance is great."
"Pours and amber brown with a thick head that sat on top of the beer the whole time. Roasted malt, sweet coffee and slight nutty hop aroma. There was a strong coffee sweetness up front followed by a bitterness that kind of drys out the flavor. There is a very chocolaty malty flavor, but unfortunately there was a slight metallic tang in there. I tried to ignore that as I'm sure it was just a bad bottle."
"I enjoyed the beer however I don't know that I'd purchase it again. In this style, I prefer New Castle Nut Brown."
"Overall, I have liked everything from the Sam Smith brewery so far, and this is no exception. I might prefer the porter over it, but only slightly. I would recommend this beer to all."
"Drinkability - Definitely a beer worth trying. After two though I'm unsure how they'll go down. But this beer is an amazing example of what a beer can be."
"Being my first example of a Samuel Smith beer i'm pretty impressed. I'll be trying their other offerngs too."
"This is a bold, highly drinkable ale that I find quite complex and very interesting. Definitely a good choice."
"Dark tan in colour, with a creamy head; deliciously malty aroma with clear nutty elements; smooth in texture, bitter, nutty (I am thinking hazelnuts); complexities include butter, vanilla-caramel; bitter after taste but clean without leaving too much trauma"
"nice medium body to the beer. good carbonation, has a little bit of a bite to it. and a very drinkable, sessionable beer, as are most from samuel smith. i would recommend this to any beer drinker."
"This one is recommended."
"Drinkability: The price tag as well as the carbonated feel makes this a beer that one could have once in awhile, and in small to medium quantities."
"Drinkability: A very good nut brown, but not my favorite--sorry. Not as sweet as a lot of nut browns I have had..The aftertaste is amazing...I could easily drink a six of this"
"A gorgeous chestnut brown, mahoganey ale, with a tan head about two fingers to start and settled to a solid ring and large-bubble cloudy film atop the beer. Medium carbonation. Smell of english toffee, toasty malts. Taste is toffee, caramel, bitter, malt, chewy pumpernickel loaf, really quite pleasant. With air, the interplay between the sharp bitter notes and the toasty malts play off eachother very effectively, making this a most interesting and pleasurable beverage with sufficient complexity to entertain your tastebuds. Aftertaste also quite nice. All around, this is a great example of a classice style done very well and well worth revisiting."
"Final Thoughts - Samuel Smith is authentic, and the Nut Brown Ale works on a variety of levels. The taste is top notch, and an example for all other nut browns. A little on the pricey side for a four pack, but worth every penny. Enjoy!"
"This one went down super-easy. Very thirst quenching but not overdone in the sweetness department. Well balanced, and very workable on its own or with a meal. Hadn't had this one in many years. Glad I grabbed a bottle."
"Overall an excellent brown ale, the best brown ale I have had to date. Highly recommended"
"Beer poured a reddish brown with an outstanding off white long lasting head. Nose initially was hop flower out of the bottle with a hint of bread as it warms. Taste is a hint of dark fruits, nuts, toasted grains, blending perfectly with a slight hint of euro hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty creamy for the style. Overall drinkability is near perfect. I have to say this in the best ENB I can recall having!"
"O: Easy to drink, and one of the finer beers that are easy to come by."
"Medium body and, honestly, a tinge much carbonation in this one. Even then, very smooth. I'd go back to this one, better than Newcastle or bottled Brooklyn."
"D: Not a session beer but not many brown ales are. I am a big brown ale fan, and this one is certainly towards the top."
"4.0 D: Tweak the mouthfeel a bit and this could be a superb brew. As it is, it's pretty good anyway."
"This came in a three-pack of Sam Smith brews, and it was the one I was most hesitant to try. My skepticism was all for naught, however, as the brew lived up to the hype. I might just make this a regular in my fridge. Definitely a must-try, especially if you prefer good English ales."
"Notes- Loaded with complex malty goodness, this is probably my favorite brown."
"D- Goes down very easily. Could drink this all night."
"cheers"
"D- Probably wouldn't make a great session beer but I don't think that is the intention. Definitely worth getting again. One of the best beers in this genre."
"D: Damned refreshing, and not too heavy on the alcohol content for all the balance it provides. All the flavors in here are extremely subtle and it just never really grows old on you. This is an extremely sessionable beer. It drinks like it ought to, and leaves you feeling pretty good about the next one."
"550ml Bottle. A nice clear ruby/brown color with a two finger tan head. Aroma of toasted nutty grain and caramel with a touch of fruit im guessing from the yeast.Flavor is malty,grainy and nutty up front then you get this little fruit flavor that leads to a spicy,slightly bitter hop finish. Thin body,soft carbonation and mouthfeel. Very nice"
"I'm currently venturing into the world of home brewing (in the hopes of learning enough to open my own microbrewery some day) and the first beer I made was a Nut Brown Ale. This seems like a great benchmark for my homebrew. Will have to compare once my brew's done bottle conditioning. I recommend this one."
"A very pleasant, extremely drinkable brew, full of character, and quite delicious."
"Drinkability: As I've written before, the key to browns is balance. Here the sum is greater than all the parts. The result is a very drinkable northern brown ale: not too hoppy, not to sweet. Not too nutty, not too thick. Just right. Yeah."
"D: Low ABV, plus mild flavors make this an amazing drinking beer. The slightly sweet leaning flavor is a nice shift from the hop bombs I've had lately. A really great beer and my benchmark for this style."
"I had this once before and was unimpressed. My taste buds might have been off then or I had heavier stuff before drinking it, but this time it's my first of the night. Great brown ale."
"drinkability: like a said an easy to drink session beer but also has that full falvor that we here like so much"
"D: Exceptionally well balanced and drinkable English Brown. A must sample for all lovers of brown ales."
"Enjoyed in Samuel Smith's pint glass. Pours a dark amber brown with very little carbonation and a small head that fades to light film. Leaves good lacing as consumed. Smells of malt, nut, and light chocolate. This is a great tasting brew, the blend in malty, nutty, chocolate, and bready flavors are subtle yet combine in a nice way. This beer is very smooth and highly drinkable. Another fantastic product from this brewery."
"Pours a dark brown, color, tan head, good-sized, diminishing. Malty, nutty aroma. Just malty but a good amount of aroma. Malty, bitter taste. Acidic & watery. A good session beer, but weak on flavor. Alcohol stands out w/bread & pasta."
"Top notch. Pours reddish brown but translucent - light carbination. Sweet smell of caramel, toffee, chocolate jumps from the glass. Smooth taste, with just a touch of hop bitters at the close - but otherwise a very clean finish. Very powerful sweet taste, but not overpowering - could definitely have a few. Don't mess around with the little bottles, upgrade to the 18.7 oz. bottle and you won't regret it."
"Drinkability- I guess this is the benchmark for me per style. Very good beer as always is the case with Samuel Smith."
"I love the feel of this beer. Its silky and medium-bodied, which matches so well with the relatively creamy malts. This would be a beer that I would love to drink multiples sitting on some old barstool. A very good beer."
"This beer's a quaffer for sure - easy going down and a pleasure to drink."
"Murky reddish amber to brown in color, very light foam appears when pouring, hard to classify as a head per se, appears calm in the glass. Semi-sweet nose of cherry, raisin fruit, pecans, walnuts, fresh butter, mineral water, rumcake, unassumedly meanders inside your nostrils for some time. Medium-bodied, the fine carbonation suavely keeps the liquid moving in the mouth, at the same time diminishing some of the sweetness. That said, no lack of brown sugar, molasses, fresh mixed nuts, cherry, fig, raisin fruit. Not buttery, creamy, yeasty nor hoppy, just touches the bases quickly on the way to home plate. Spring water freshness. Well-bred classiness rather than profundity."
"Great drinkability, quite enjoyable, and a little bit of something across the board."
"Poured beer from a 550ml bottle into a pint glass. Has a dark yet transluscent brown color. Medium frothy head that leaves a few traces of lacing behind. Has a malty aroma that is not overwhelming. This easy maltiness continues with the taste with a a nice nutty background. The taste finishes with a bit of hops bitterness. A medium mouthfeel. Overall an easy beer to gulp down with plenty of character."
"OVERALL: Another solid product from Sam Smith. A good beer that's definitely drinkable and sessionable, but is not something I'd write home about. I'll have another, but I probably won't remember it down the line."
"Beautiful on the pour, just the right amount of head-between 1.5 and 2 inches. Delicious roasted grains on the nose, with obvious nutty characteristics represented. Same in the flavor, especially on the finish. Perfect balance between the malt and the moderate hop character. Wonderful, substantial mouthfeel, and the drinkability is of the charts."
"Deep brown in appearance with some reddish tint. Frothy, thin, fine head. Very, very nutty sweet smell, which leads directly to the sweet, nutty taste. Very malty, not much bitterness at all. The sweetness gives way to the bitterness at the end, but by no means is it overpowering. It's got a crisp taste. Doesn't seem too linger too long, and it begs you to take another sip as soon as you swallow. This beer is deliciously smooth and drinkable."
"This is a really good brew. Fairly complex nose, complex flavor, really good feel, and a great finish. The biggest negative is I started drinking it, and somehow it was quickly gone. Great quaff."
"Overall a great brew, highly recommend it!"
"I should drink more from the Old Tadcaster Brewery."
"D: This is a very a very drinkable beer, the bitterness might not be for everybody."
"D - Excellent! Could drink all night."
"I couldn't wish for more."
"Excellent drinkability. Can't wait to have this one in my fridge again, right next to Newcastle, my other brown ale!"
"Notes: I can see being in an English pub and drinking many many of these. If I see this again I will not hesitate to buy it."
"4 M&4.5 D: rounded, creamy-smooth on the mouthfeel, plus a softly-carbonated texture, this medium-bodied, delicious beer drinks only too well. Reasonably flavoursome, with a subtle balance arrived at b/w bitter-sweetness of roast-malts and a sour tinge of dark fruits, this simply has to be one of my all-time favourite English brown ales alongside ""Rigglewelter"" (Black Sheep)."
"D: with its balance i could easily drink a few of these, but not many more, it seems that the sweetness would probably catch up with me in the end. really a great beer, and one that i have overlooked many times. there is beauty in simplicity."
"(rated Jul 29, 2008)"
"overall i like this beer and tend to grab it when it is available, also good to cook with."
"Pours with a nice 2 finger head that forms immediately and sticks pretty well. Not a big aroma but about what you would expect from an English Nut Brown. A bit of smoke, some nutty maltiness and a kiss of English hops. Smoke and nuttiness roll out first on the tounge. Plenty of malt sweetness all over. Not as much chocolate flavors that its American cousins have, but some very faint hints in a malty kind of way. Some apple tartness and a slight bite of subtle English hopiness on the finish. A bit more viscous than I was expecting for the style, but in a good way. A little more carbonation than I would like takes a little away from the mouthfeel though. I have had better nut browns, but this one is up there, especially as far as taste goes."
"Dark brown with a squatty tan head. Nutty and malty aroma with some toasted malt and bread. Lighter than expected mouthfeel. Roasted malt, hazelnuts, pecans, and coffee in the taste. The crystal malt is detectable in the back. Pretty good, but I'm not really a brown ale fan."
"Drinkability: all night"
"Smooth, medium body, light carbonation, not enough flavor, kinda watery"
"D - normal ABV, plus highly drinkable , all asma smith is good stuff. goodness all around."
"Drinkability: The consistency of the taste really makes this an easy one to drink. The light ABV and slightly sweet taste also add to the ease."
"D: Drinkability was light, not as robust as I hoped for but an easy enjoyable drink to down."
"D - I'm already a big fan of British ales, especially the ones made by Samuel Smith. This is absolutely delicious and very drinkable."
"Deep tea colour with rich beige head that lasts. Bready aroma like a dark toasted rye. Flavour is just like oats and rye with walnut character. Good length and a balanced bitterness. Mouthfeel on the watery side but a drinkable drop. Not sessionable for me as it's a bit like overeating walnuts. I think I'll revisit this beer when I've got some appropriate food to match as I think it will hold up much better than alone."
"Disappointed at the nose of the beer, I was hoping for a nice nutty aroma to get me into the beer. A good amount of beige colored head on the pour that is absolutely delicious. It is a bit watery, as others have said, but aside from that the flavor is really good. Heavy, nutty flavor that gets stronger as the beer warms a bit- in the future I will let this brew warm a bit before drinking it. Roasted, nutty flavor finishes well and stays for a bit. Enjoyable brew that is easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel - glides on the palate with a medium body. Refreshing watery feel with a smooth finish since the carbonation is lightly balanced."
"Taste: I believe this is the first nut brown ale that I've had that actually has a nutty taste to it. For that alone I give it high praise. Also it's not overly sweet like some brown ales tend to be."
"Poured a clear brown into a weizen glass (why? because I felt like it) with a finger-width off-white head that eventually faded to a thin film, leaving sparse lacing. Aroma is dark fruit, malt, vanilla, caramel. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, slick and a little chewy, low-medium carbonation. Taste is caramel, vanilla, walnuts, figs, hint of chocolate, no bitterness to speak of. Different from American brown ales in that the taste seems much milder and subdued. Overall this is a great beer and one of the best in its style that I've had."
"All around very drinkable beer, much butter than I was expecting but I will have to get more of these."
"D- This is a damn fine cult classic. It's very sessionable, but at the price, you really can't. (At least, I cannot.) I will definitely have again."
"3.5/5"
"I expected more from Samuel Smith's... tsk tsk.... you can't make the beer 5 times and name it something different each time."
"I'd like to thank Uncle Muck for the timely drop-off of this beer when he visited last week--a pleasant surprise and a classy choice... browns seldom look impressive out of the bottle--that said, Samuel Smith's NBA pours an opaque reddish-brown body with zero head (!?)... stands a solid, almost black-and-tan balance in THE Samuel Smith 12 oz. Nonick glass...warm, subtle notes of hazel nut and hops... 31 IBUs seems undertstated... balanced with a hint of sweetness... medium-bodied, with a solid presence massaging the tongue... mellow and drinkable... on par with the better in the genre... nuts! or at least a malty basis that enables the other characteristics--butter nut, molasses (!), burnt toffee--to soften and please.... tops Newcastle (sorry, brother Gil) slightly, and the few other studs in the style with a slightly stoutish lean..."
"D - Highly drinkable beer, one of my favorite brown ales"
"Pretty expensive, not a beer that you can drink all the time on my budget, but I can walk right down the street and get one when I have the money."
"This is my favorite beer and I don't think I can do it justice with my description."
"Pours a clear ruby red, chestnut brown, medium sized off white head forms, slowly settles down to a thin ring around the glass, drops a few lace spots, looks good. Smell is sweet and malty, brown sugar and caramel, nuts, very fruity, cherries and strawberries, almost pineapple, apples, interesting, not as much nuttiness as I would like. Taste is similar, sweet and bready up front, caramel, honey and oats, hazelnut middle, not as much fruit in the flavour but I still get some apples and strawberries, very dry crackery finish. Mouthfeel is nice, medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, very drinkable, dry finish, easy to put down. Sam Smiths don't really make anything spectacular for me, but everything they do is done well and I like them all."
"It is a very drinkable ale. It's the standard brawn ale in my opinion."
"Drinkability - Very high. I could drink this endlessly."
"Pours a deep brown, mahogany color, with an airy tan head, doesn't last forever, but it leaves a lace all the way down the glass. Smells like roasted barley and nuts, maybe a little brown sugar. It tastes amazing, the classic British brown, and damn good for it. A little on the high carbonation side for my tastes, but damn good, and I drink this beer on a regular basis."
"Now, the beer I had earlier in the night, the Samuel Smith Old Brewery Pale Ale, was much more enjoyable."
"Pours a see-through brown little head that faded quick, little lacing, taste very nutty, cant taste any hops. fairly thin tasting even thiner than the oatmeal. Overall though this is a good beer and if you can find it aroudn here for under 10 a 4 pack your in good shape"
"Overall: Unimpressed with the 5% ABV. This brew has confirmed my thoughts on Nut Browns considering it is rated in the A category as an ambassador for Nut Brown Ales. That would be my first let down in buying based upon ratings."
"Overall, I really like this beer. It's good, and strikes me as a good example of the style. Certainly much better than several other nut brown ales I've had. I would happily drink it again. Several in a night? Sure. Happy to. Would I seek it out? Maybe, particularly on cool fall nights like this one."
"The taste is full bodied and very smoothl yet flavourful, with a lot of nuts, dark bread, some buttery caramel. It starts somewhat sweet but finishes with a drier, nutty-bitterness and a faint hint of sourness."
"I had to drink 2 4pacs of these over a few month period to really get comfortable with it. The seventh one was the charm. The eighth one sold me. This is truly a tasters beer. It brought the style home to me in a way that makes me want to try even higher quality nut browns."
"Overall a very tastey brew - and a great brown ale. Certainly sessionable, and one that would pair great with a roasted turkey or meat loaf."
"D- In this incarnation, very low. At this point, I'm fairly well convinced that I was sold a very outdated and/or tainted bottle. This one will have to be revisited and re-reviewed at a later date to ensure that I've given it a fair shake."
"This has long been my favorite English brown ale. Soft and understated, mildly sweet and eminently quaffable. Always a pleasure."
"Overall, I can't really say this is a great beer. It's good, I like it, I'll order it now and then, but I think it's overrated. It is a good beer, and it hasn't really reached premium pricing despite it's relatively high quality. But Rogue's Hazelnut brown it is not."
"I, for one, will always have a place in the fridge for beers like these - solid, simple beers whose strength lie in its very function: to be enjoyably drinkable. They may not have all the frills but they are nevertheless quality, reliable beers that can evoke epiphany on the palates of many new beer drinkers. They certainly did for me."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a low carbonation that is pretty soft"
"I thought I was reviewing an aftershave, but it turns out it's just a really good nut brown ale."
"Taste was smooth and creamy, with a slight caramel taste. A little too watery and flat for my liking. I was expecting a bit of a more robust brew. Low carbonation. All of these factors made this a highly quaffable brew, but I'd rather not. I like a bit more bite to my ales. I'm gonna pass."
"D: Once I get into the nut brown zone, I could put a few of these away. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Again, Samuel Smith has not disappointed me."
"definitely expected a lot more of this highly hyped brew."
"D: It has a moderate body, balanced flavor and low ABV making it a decent session brew. Its not my style but I'd never turn one away and could easily spend a long evening enjoying this brew."
"Light brown in color with thin head of mist that clings and sticks around for a while. Aroma of sweet, roasted nuts with a hint of vanilla. Subtle carbonation allows for the flavorful roasted nuts to engulf the palate. Immerse yourself in the smooth, light creamy taste of this beer. Equally sweet and malty, a wonderful balance."
"The overall taste is nutty. It starts with some sweetness and a mild bitterness and finishes with a little stronger, but still fitting, bitterness. The beer is medium-bodied."
"Pours a dark brown with a huge tan head. Smells of ripe fruit and earthy hops. Taste is malty sweet, with a hint of toasted nuts. There is a pleasant tea like flavor as well. Bitterness is low, but there is a nice earthy aroma in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy; low, pleasant carbonation levels. Very drinkable, refreshing, and tasty. One of my favorite Samuel Smith beers."
"D: It's ok to have one, I wouldn't reach for a second. Too strong on the soy flavor; kind of kills it."
"D-- This beer is what a good session beer is all about-- the richer flavors develop after a few."
"All in all, this beer comes highly recommended as far as Brown ales are concerned. Its superior to many of its competitors, such as Newcastle, in every respect I can think of."
"Overall a great value. A pint and a half for just under 4 bucks is on the cheap side for a beer this good. I'm excited about the cold months coming up and delving into more of Samuel Smith's brews."
"Overall, a good offering by Samuel Smith."
"Once again just a little disappointed with the overall taste. Wish it was a little more of a pronounced flavor, not saying it was bad just expecting more."
"The color is dark brown with a nice thick tan head and lots of foamy lacing on the glass. Aroma is sweet and malty although rather faint. Very well balanced flavors: malty, slightly sweet, spicy, and a kick of bitter hops. Not overly sweet either. One of the best Brown Ale's I've had. Way better than Newcastle..."
"Real real nice. Not upset over buying four"
"D - I think this is a perfect session beer to have with friends easy to drink with a very good taste worth trying"
"Dark brown colored ale with a quickly fading head that stays at a quarter of an inch.Aroma reminded me of sour milk or baby vomit.Taste has nuts and butter but again that sour milk taste.I was looking forward to this from what my buddies told me but I am highly dissapointed.I will be staying away from this."
"D: I would drink this beer again and I plan to."
"550mL bottle purchased from LCBO in Toronto. I'm generally bored silly with nut brown ales, and am hoping this one can break the trend. Pours a clear medium brown with little head. Weak aroma of nothing much. Flavour starts out with a medium maltiness that quickly gives way to a quite nice tang that lingers throughout the aftertaste. Medium bodied. That tangy finish keeps me coming back. A nut brown ale I like!"
"This beer is so smooth and easy to drink. Every drink is packed with so much flavor. Nothing bitter, or spiced, not over malted, it was amazing. The Nut should be capitalized. That came through the most. The best brown ale I've ever tasted. I will be buying this for a long time. Yea.. I recommend it."
"Notes: This is a very enjoyable brown ale."
"A solid brown ale here. This one pours a dark translucent brown with a strong head retention. It gives off a nutty aroma, and has an even balance of a hoppy and nut flavor. This one goes down real smooth and crisp. Overall, a real easy beer to appreciate and enjoy."
"Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale poured a nice dark brownish red color, nice tan head. Smell was of faint fruit and hops. Taste was a rush of sweet and dark flavors. Chocolate became present as it warmed. Good hop finish. Feel had good carbonation. Was a very easy drinker. Very nice full flavored brown ale. A very nice beer."
"Poured with a dark, slight amber brown appearance with a thin layer of lacing on the head and creamy, almost syrupy lacing on the sides. Aromas are a delicate wollop of cocoa, nuts, almonds, toffee, slight dark fruit hint. Taste is initially sweet but lags toward a bitter finish. Has a pretty dry, roasty, caramel-like flavoring. Mouthfeel gives it a good carbonation, as well as a creamy body. Overall, a great brown ale."
"D - An interesting beer. Fairly simple yet full of flavour. $8 for a 500ml imported beer is fairly good value. Something I can see myself buying again. Hopefully it is available here on an ongoing basis."
"Like all Samuel Smith beers, it's a little pricey -- especially for a style that many other brewers do well. Still, it's a great beginner's beer. People who don't like the taste of beer (or don't know they do) will still love this. Best of all, it's a beer I still come back to and enjoy, and I expect to do so for years to come."
"The mouthfeel is very smooth and medium bodied. This could easily be a great session beer,...if it wasn't 12 dollars a 4-pack."
"Drinkability: This is to be enjoyed like fine wine, sip this as slow as your thirst allows."
"Poured a deep brown with a nice dirty white head on it. Nose wasroasted malt, caramel, nutty and more complex than I imagined. Taste was sweet dry, slight roastiness that was smooth and mellow. Caramel, chocolate and english matls stole the show. Darn good English Porter"
"Sam Smith's Nut Brown, why have I not reviewed ye yet? Light mahogany body with a small cream coloured head that leaves a little lace. Nutty aroma, with a good dose of malt. Roasted nuts all the way through, with some caramel in the middle and a small modicum of bittering hops in the dry finish. Definitely a very malty beer, with a full profile in this sense, although I found it needed something extra to take it to a higher level. Medium bodied, but somehow more filling than a thicker beer. Good drinkability."
"This beer is quite drinkable. The subtle, and not overwhelming, smells and flavors make this beer very easy to drink. The dry aftertaste makes it inviting to take another gulp. There isn't anything outlandish or over-the-top about this brew. It is very solid and delightful."
"Drinkability is high, a very smooth and flavorful english brown with no discernible alcohol presence, right in the session range at 5%, could drink quite a bit of this one"
"D - Two to three of these is possible."
"Overall - An average nut brown."
"MF&D - Medium bodied and tasty. IMO the perfect ale. I could drink this everyday."
"This beer is even better than the oatmeal stout, and I will certainly be buying this one more when the money is available!"
"Drinkability takes a little bit of a hit due to the intense sweetness."
"D - Damn easy to drink: fairly low abv, smooth flavor. Goes down real easy. A great session beer."
"This beer was good, but too light for my tastes."
"A standard-bearer for the style, low in carbonation and eminently smooth. Something to make a night of."
"There is a nice bitterness to the brew that balances out the malt perfectly. The feel is slightly tingly and crisp from the carbonation. It leaves the mouth a tad dry."
"A lovely copper-brown color with the trademark elusively thin English head. The nose is slight, but the careful taster will be patient with it and be rewarded with rich caramel, roasted malt, hay, and subdued yet holding-their-own hops. On the tongue, the mineral quality shows up, along with a nice ale-style fruitiness (not too strong) and pleasant malt roundness. The palate is dry, crisp, and the paragon of refreshing. One could, even at 5% ABV, drink it all night."
"D - If I had the cash to pay $12 a 4-pack, I could drink it nonstop until the last nail is in my coffin."
"D: Maybe not a session beer, but a beer that I could have more than one in a sitting. Very flavorful. One of the better English Brown Ales."
"D: Really great on tap. One of the better session beers out there. Make me want to ask the question who is the best PM ever. My answer? Lord Palmer."
"D- A phenomenal example of the style though its hard to tell from my review. Extraordinarily drinkable. You could sit in the pub and drink 70 of these in a sitting."
"Soft and slick in the mouth. Slightly buttery with a nice tingle of carbonation and a clean finish."
"Overall this is a very good brew. Very nice aromas, nice balanced taste. I would recommend this to anyone."
"I tried this beer on April 17, 2008 after purchasing at one of the local LCBO outlets. The beer poured a beautiful translucent reddish-brown colour with a huge rocky head that slowly dissipated. The aroma was caramel malt, and some hops. The mouthfeel was full-bodied, slightly creamy, and slightly bitter. The flavour was similar to dark, powdered cocoa, with a little hoppishness."
"D - An excellent beer... Something I now plan on keeping around in my basement on an ongoing basis... Possibly the most aromatic beer I've ever smelled..."
"This is a very good imported English brown ale. I will definitely drink it again. I would love to try it on tap."
"Clear coppery brown color with frothy tan head that almost completely disappears within a couple of minutes. Nice yeasty malty aroma. Taste is complex with bitter flint and nuts battling with sweet malts. Aftertaste fairly acerbic. Goes down quite easy."
"Yet another first rate beer from Samuel Smiths. Leagues above other brown ales such as Newcastle."
"D: Style in mind I still didn't think anything special of this beer, I could finish the one I had then go to something else."
"D-Not really something i would drink on a regular basis but for those who really like the brown ales might be something to look into."
" This is the ""high water mark"" for Brown ale's, a true classic of it's kind!"
"Simple but good."
"Pours a brown/copper color with a sturdy little head that is fed by some intense carbonation. Smells of nice nutty malts (almonds, pecans) and that signature Sam Smith toffee/butterscotch scent. Delightful. Silky mouthfeel, likes to slide around the mouth. Light toffe and butterscotch initially that turns into that nice nuttiness I smelled earlier. Finish dwells on the nuts (Ha!) and is quite good. A superb session beer. A must in the fridge."
"This is quite possibly one of the best nut browns I have had to date! Served chilled in a pint glass. Produced a lucid red brown color with lots of little tiny bubbles. Nose gave an aroma of sweet, nutty almond and walnut notes. Taste is smooth as butter with hints of nutty flavor and very well balanced with the hops. A great ale to enjoy after dinner or just about any time."
"I've had this beer before and didn't really enjoy it, though each time it grew on me and for the first time tonight I actually liked it in more ways than not. Sammy Smith has always made bitter beers, but the depth of flavor is worth the endurance. Surely a beer I will revisit from time to time."
"This beer is dangerously drinkable. The taste and mouthfeel are superb and it would complement a starchy meal like pasta."
"One of the better nut brown ale's I have tried. It is very smooth and refreshing drink. I would deffinetly drink this again."
"Drinkability: A decent, easily drinkable English Brown."
"Was alot better once it had flattened a little bit, carbonation killed the flavours at first. Love to have it on cask."
"D: A great brown ale that is superbly drinkable. I could drink this at any time of the year under any circumstance, if not for its scarcity and expense in my area. Simply a wonderful beer."
"D - Excellent nutty, malt character. A little lacking in aroma and could use a bit more hop character. Overall, a good example of the style and reasonably drinkable."
"The flavor make up for any doubt about the quality. The beer is sweet, but not syrupy, extraordinarily well balanced with a tinge of nutty-chocolate roasted malt. The beer finishes so clean, I had finished most of my glass before i realized I was long past my first sip. The beer does not weigh you down... very very well made... One of the best brown's I have had the privilege of drinking."
"Verdict: A decent, drinkable brown ale."
"Overall - A very good beer that is quite unique in its nuttiness."
"D- lots of flavor, like a liquid dessert (almost). i just don't usually consider desserts to be full of tasty goldings, regardless, the superb aroma makes me wanna keep sniffing, the taste makes me wanna keep tasting, and the suede, dry mouth feel makes me wanna keep drinking."
"Drinkability = Pleasant, easy to drink. I wouldn't mind having a couple of these in a sitting. I've only had a few brown ales, but this one is the best of them so far."
"D: Makes the respectable Newcastle taste like water and I love Newcastele mind you!"
"Pours a reddish-copper color, with a head that quickly vanishes to a thin lace that lingers. The smell is of nuts, sweet malts, and caramel. The taste follows the nose to the letter, with the addition of some mild hops that balance the sweetness quite nicely. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would like, but prominent carbonation and a beautifully dry finish work quite well. As for drinkability, this one is aces. Bottom line, this is THE Nut Brown Ale, against which all others must be measured."
"This follows suit for most brown beers that I have had. A dark color and a light body. I never understood the style, it is a light beer that pretends to be dark. Not that it is really bad, just not for me."
"Pours a deep brown with a slight red tint with a short but thick tan colored head that laces the glass all the way down. The smell is of deep roasted malts, some nutty aroma, a slight amount of hops, and some chocolate and caramel aromas. The taste is excellent for a nut brown. It tastes of very well balanced roasted malts, hazelnut, some almond I detected, chocolate, caramel, and it finishes with a nice hoppy bitterness that isn't too overpowering. The mouthfeel is great as it is a very crisp and fresh tasting beer that warms all the way down. The drinkability is also very good as if I had a six pack of this, it certainly won't last very long."
"Drinkabilty is really high. Super smooth and tasty, a world classic and benchmark for the style, a true session ale."
"D - This is a very drinkable beer. Casually or with a meal which would be excellent as well. Great beer made extremely well. Good light feel to this beer."
"I have been more impressed with other beers, but this is simply so hard to fault. Clearly the best brown ale I have tried and worth the exxy price."
"Overall, this is a very drinkable beer, especially if you're into nut brown ales. It's one of Sam Smith's best efforts."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, if I were in the mood for this style, I could certainly drink quite a few of this beer."
"Drinkability is good. Now I wonder why I have passed on this one for so long? Tasty and very sessionable. I would grab this any time over Newcastle if it came in six packs."
"Crystal clear dark brown color with a beige head. Aroma is sweet and nutty, and that's really it. Flavor is far more complex, with notes of cold coffee, caramel, toffee, hazelnuts, oats, raisin, and a touch of hops for balance. Mouthfeel is good to begin with but starts to thin out with warmth. Pretty easy drinking, although I prefer Rogue's and AleSmith's brown ales."
"D - Extremely drinkable, great brew."
"This is the 2nd SS brew tonight that I have consistently overlooked. I always have access, but almost always go toward the American 22... I will bring this back into the stable."
"Drinkability: As a northern brown ale, pretty exceptional. Delicious nutty, malty taste, and quite smooth as well. I could definitely deal with a few of these for a few hours at the beerhouse or pub. Tadcaster scores again!"
"Drinkability was very good, it's not my personal style so I wouldn't be able to knock these things back all day, but who would? It's a great brew that deserves some moderation. I would definitely buy this again if I wasn't totally consumed by all things Belgian. Excellent beer."
"D-Very good. I'd like to try to pair this with some foods, since it seems to have a lot of pairing potential."
"Quite refreshing and drinkable. I'm impressed."
"D- This is a nice brown ale, but nothing fantastic, im comparing this to the likes of Caledonian 80/, and while a nice drinkability and flavour there is nothing outstanding, but still very solid"
"Pours deep brown with ruby tints and a nice white head. Nose is malty with a little bit of nut flavor and some coppery smell. Taste follows the nose. Malts, slight hop flavor and a little bit of nut flavors. Hops come out to play a tiny bit on the finish. Mouthfeel is typical yorkshire thin. Drinkability is outstanding, a great session brew."
"Hefty bottle pours a rich, clear reddish brown with a very thick, almost creamy style head. Head retention is amazing. Aroma is well, quite nutty with a slight hint of butterscotch lurking in the background. Very well balanced taste with all the ingredients working well together. sweet at first with a buttery, nutty flavor that is very smooth and easy to take. Finish is dry and almost tea-like with a definite walnut aftertaste. Very smooth and quite full mouthfeel. Glad this beer is available locally as I will definitely be making another purchase. Best brown I've had to date."
"Drinkability - Is decent for drinkability. I don't know that I would buy another 4 pack anytime soon, but maybe I would buy a bottle in a bar."
"A nice, nonoffending mellow brew. Appeared dark brown out of the bottle with almost no carbonation or foam. Smell is very nutty and reminds me of a Sam Adams Oktoberfest. Taste was okay. The malt sweetness is very mellow with the nuttiness from the aroma also present. While I liked this beer, for some reason, this felt overly heavy."
"This beer pours a clear brown with a large, light tan head. Nice lacing is left on the glass. The smell is nutty with a bit of dark fruit coming through. The taste is sweet and nutty up front with a slightly bitter finish. A bit of astringency in the back. The mouthfeel was a bit watery. Not a bad beer, but not as good as I was expecting."
"D: Very good blokes."
"D: Good sipping beer but the taste begines to become too much to enjoy after a while"
"The flavor was complex and complete for any nut brown I have tried. This has always been the standard for the style. In the mouth it left a nice bitterness at the finish. Overall a wicked good beer."
"Pours a nice brown color (naturally) with excellent head and lacing. It has a very nice scent, a good malty aroma with a bit of black licorice hint. Good taste, a nice deep draught with a wonderful woody brown flavor and a nice bit of nuttiness, although I would've prefered more from that aspect. It does down very easily with a nice little bit of carbonation. An excellent nut brown ale."
"D: Beer gets a little heavy with the thick, nutty, buttery taste which curbs the drinkability a little, but this is by far the best brown ale I've had."
"as part of a beerclub at the local pub, i hae been exposed to many types of beer. i found this brown ale to be at the top of my list. it has great color and taste. it has become one of my go to brews. i enjoy the subtle nutty flavor this beer has to offer."
"This is about as good as it gets for a brown ale. This beer has so much going for it that it truly is a classic and deserves its reputation. The beer pours a nice frothy dark amber brown color with lots of light chocolaty creamy head and some carbonation. There is plenty of retention, but no real lacing, at least in my glass. The smell is not quite up to the level of expectation as the taste. The smell was quite nutty and quite alcoholy, almost a bourbon type smell. The beer tastes just great. You will get loads of complexity, nice walnut and almond flavors, some heavy fruits, some caramel, chocolate, coffee flavors, and some tinges of yeast. Overall, there is a smooth creaminess to this beer that makes the mouthfeel and drinkability first rate. Other than the smell, which isn't all that enticing, I can't think of too many other down sides. Well worth seeking out. I would go farther and say that it really is obligatory if you want to experience a genuine British style nut brown ale. L'Chaim."
"This is a great beer. Another English classic. Great for the winter months."
"M + D: Rich, round... a good balance for its class. Not huge, certainly not light. Just about right, and that's a nice feel! With the decent full body, it's very nice to enjoy the subtle features and drink rather easily. Certainly room for another. I could potentially session this quite happily."
"One of the first Samuel Smith's I ever tried, this is always a pleasure to revisit. Two full fingers of tannish head on this walnut brown body--just tremendous. Roasted caramel and brown sugar pour forth in the taste, with a mild hops aroma bringing up the rear. Ahhh, the taste, lots of caramel, sugary sweetness, nut dryness (almonds, I believe) that is great because it's there and not dominating the rest, a hint of fruit--way delicious. Fairly well carbonated, this flattens a little too quickly for me, but is easily rescued by its creamy smoothness. A genuine pleasure to enjoy, especially with a cigar on the patio. Highly recommended."
"Overall: Not the beer that I was hoping or expecting, wish it was a little thicker."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slightly coating with a bit of crispness to the finish and a nutty aftertaste. This is a very easy-drinking brown. It would make a pretty good sessioner."
"Overall, I thought it was a solid beer but could have been a bit thicker in my opinion."
"Full mouthfeel, but not filling. Damn. My glass is empty."
"Drinks incredibly smooth, with moderate mouthfeel. I was expecting something more heavy."
"O: Overall this beer is a thrill for the eyes and nose, but a slight disappointment to the mouth."
"I had heard good things about Samuel Smith's so the I was expecting something nice and it delivered, nothing spectacular, but very nice."
"Drinkability is a little better than average, but it is so rich and sweet, I reserve this as a dessert beer at a nice dinner."
"I thought this was pretty drinkable. My large bottle went down fast, it didn't seem to be something to want to savor too long and it went down easy with a nice rich flavor and clean finish."
"D = Highly drinkable. This is one of the better nut brown ales I've had. Really good just for a relaxing evening."
"This is an alright beer. The flavor is on the lighter side, which might make it highly drinkable for some, but for me, there is just not enough here to keep me coming back."
"D- This is a very drinkable Nut Brown, I was sad that I only bought one at the store. I will defiantly get this one again and again."
"Feels very smooth, but maybe a little thick. The thickness gives it a heavy feeling making it harder to drink, but overall doesn't effect the quality. This is a great beer."
"When I try to think of a good English Nut Brown Ale this is always the first one that comes to mind. Great auroma, great flavor,... great in every catagory. Also great head retention, it lasted as a thin layer of head throughout the whole pint."
"Burgandy, caramel color. Malty smell, thick, tan, lasting head. Deep roasted nutty and malty flavor, with some bitterness to balance it out. Very smooth. Nicely carbonated. Lasting roasted aftertaste, and easy to drink. This is a good brown ale overall."
"I could drink this all night and into tomorrow morning. I also think this would be a great introduction beer for those getting away from the macro stuff."
"Poured this from a 550 ml brown bottle into a pint glass. This is one fine-looking beer. Deep reddish brown with a fluffy head that lasts the entire time. Nice, sticky lacing. Nice malty smell. Hints of nut and some fruit (I think I detect notes of cherry). Very smooth. Quite a balanced drink. Malts predominate, but there's just enough hops to even it out. Lighter medium body with just the right amount of carbonation. Great for the style. This would make a great session beer."
"Dark amber brown with ruby highlights. Quarter inch tan head. Amazing aroma that is sweet, nutty and bready. Taste is not too sweet but otherwise accomplishes what the aroma promises. Frankly, I wouldnt want it to taste any sweeter, has a very balanced flavor. Finish is kind of nutty. Mouthfeel is medium with decent carbonation. You could not drink too much of this, but you should try."
"The taste shines through as being very sweet, a hazelnut taste is evident, quite a smooth and buttery beer for the most part, but has a dry finish as to not overstay its welcome."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This is the best brown ale on the market...hands down."
"As a 47 year old who's been drinking beer for 30+ years... you can do better than this with a USA brew for half the price."
"Honestly...I think my new drink may be this insted of newcastle. Simply put the best brown ale I have ever had. very drinkable with the tastes of nuts that never stop. Wonderful beer."
"I was expecting carbonation problems after the pour, but I was instead rewarded with an excellent mouthfeel and drinkability. The beer settled down nicely. I will probably try this one again."
"This beer is really easy to drink. A little sweet for my taste, but I had no problem finishing the bomber. If you're into sweet beers, or belgian beers, you'll love this brown."
"W/ the almost dessert beer taste and low ABV, I would gladly have a few of these w/ friends or at the pub."
"This beer pours a deep mahogany brown with a one-finger foamy head that recedes after a bit...The chestnut appearance gives way to a caramel, nutty aroma that leads to a smooth, buttery taste that is simply outstanding... I love all Samuel Smith brews and this one definitely does not dissapoint... scores for taste and an exceptional drinkability that goes down smooth and effortlessly.. Got a 18oz bottle as part of a gift-pack and loved all three brews I received... The taste and aroma are not overwhelming, but it is a pleasure to drink... Definitely recommended..."
"D - A smooth beer that would be very easy to drink."
"Poured a dark transparent brown,with a nice tan head,I instantly smell sweetness,rasins,chocolate,it has a bold smell.A suttle nuttiness(go figure)is followed by a whirlpool of sweet whisky,quality coffee,and creamy carmels aged in a wood barrel.The mouthfeel is outstanding,a little thinner than it appears when poured,but it makes for a great beer that is more than drinkable,I cant wait to check this one out again...till next time Mr.Smith"
"I usually love the Sam Smith stuff but I just didn't like this one at all."
" All in all another great one from the old brewery, Tadcaster.one thing is for sure though; weather you like a particular thing about a sam smith or not, you know that its not an oversight, they mean to do everything they do."
"The bottle erupted once it was opened. I was very surprised how much carbonation was in this bottle. I poured it into a goblet and noticed the creamy head that was a good inch in thickness. The smell is very mild, but has the hint of nutty bread. Taste pretty good going down with just a faint aftertaste. Not overly hoppy or strong. Not the best nut brown ale, but pretty damn solid. Maybe I am a little more critical of this beer because it is a Sam Smith.I still would buy this again."
"When this fresh (as this one was), this is a superior nut brown. I worry about the clear glass and the possibility of skunking."
"D: A little too mild and underdeveloped for a good nut brown but the drinkability is there. Would have like more structure and maltiness in the background overall."
"D:	I came to enjoy this ale more and more with time - gradual warming certainly helps bring out the nutty sweetness of this brew. This is quite a complex nut brown that does not disappoint the senses - I would love to have another sometime, but one is enough for me tonight. I would love to try some other beers from this brewery!"
"D-overall a nice beer and a very good brown but I would have to move on to soething with a hop zing after two."
"D: This is one of my new favorite beers, I could drink these all year long"
"this is the style example i believe ; pours a deep cooper-brown w/ a creamy tan head that lasts and lacing all the way down ; a very pleasent toasted caramely/nutty w/ hints of butterscotch/dates perhaps ; the flavor reflects the smell as the sweet, complex malts blend well w/ the hops to make up the nutty bittersweet flavor that it's famous for, combined w/ the slightly sour yeast flavours ; a nice robust yet light body w/ dextrins to make the flavor last quite awhile ; this is my fav. ale, so to say it's drinkable is an understatement..."
"D - This was a very drinkable beer and the hallmark of when I know when it's really good...I was sad to take the last sip because it was all gone"
"Pours a clear, toasty mahogany brown with some pale amber highlights and a surprisingly lasting head. The nose is chock full of caramel malts and some nutty notes with bitter chocolate hanging around the edges. On the palate, thin, metallic hops assert themselves first, then the chocolate notes come out. Caramel malts come through, but they stay dry and finish nutty. Toward the end, a nice English ale sourness crops up to finish things off with an acidic tone that entices for another sip. Mouthfeel is wonderful -- medium bodied, light carbonation, not too heavy in the malt column. What a wonderful beer. My third-favorite offering from Samuel Smith (behind the oatmeal stout and IPA)."
"that's an awesome brown ale"
"A drinkable beer, but not something to chase after I'd say."
"D- Very easy to drink. Has no real flaws or off notes but it could use a bit more punch."
"This beer's easily drinkable, but it doesn't have you crawling back to the fridge for more as others do."
"I have to agree with some of the reviews I've seen here. I tried this one after hearing that it was so amazing, and while it's not bad, I really wasn't terribly impressed. The name says it all: Nut Brown Ale. Visually, it's a bit dull- brown body with a tan head. Smell was actually quite nutty... Should this be a shocker? I'm not really sure. The mouthfeel was thin, although it could simply be my preference for a thicker beer that lead my to this conclusion. The taste was not bad at all, but nothing remarkable. Really, there is nothing wrong with this drink, but there is nothing amazing about it either."
"Decided to try this beer after hearing people rave about it and seeing it readily available at my local liquor store. Poured into a pint glass. It poured a dark brown color with a creal colored head that lasted most of the way through the drink. The smell was kind of nutty, with a strong malt scent. The overall taste was malty with a little nut aftertaste. The mouthfeel of this beer is quite light and easy to drink. And the overall drinkability is quite favorable. I wouldn't call this my favorite brown ale, but It will be one I would like to go back to agian and agian."
"Overall, I'm not terribly impressed. It's not a bad beer but it's not great either. Just average, I guess. I don't think I'll buy this again."
"D: Have not had a brown ale in a while but I really like what is going on in this one, perhaps my favorite offering from this brewery. Not heavy or filling, just fresh and refreshing."
"Very high drinkability"
"355 ml brown bottle, now available in Norway (Vinmonopolet). ABV is 5.0%. Chestnut coloured beer, large and lasting off-white head. Moderate aroma of hazelnuts, malts, caramel and chocolate. Malty flavour, moderately sweet with plenty of caramel, nutty finish with moderate hops. Nice enough, definitely better than Newcastle ""Broon", but not really outstanding."
"This is a pretty smooth beer and I feel it would be a great ale for sitting around with friends. I wouldn't drink from bottle, def a pint glass beer. I'd recommend a pork tenderloin."
"D - Very drinkable."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer. Tastes good and was not heavy to drink. Definitely a good beer."
"Another solid beer from Samuel Smith's. This is an excellent session beer. Light, crisp, good malt taste. Pours a clear brown color. Big light off-white head from a hard pour. The head fades down to a covering of the glass. Good lacing, not much aroma. The taste is good. Malts are predominant with just enough bitterness to ensure it don't wind up too sweet. The mouthfeel is fairly rich and the overall effect is a nice, crisp refreshing beer. Drinkability is excellent. This is a good all occasion beer - either with food or as a session beer. Very nice."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a clear mahogany-brown color with a dense, brown-tan head comprised of many fine bubbles. The smell is mostly of roasted malts, slightly smoky and a bit nutty. The taste is all malt with the only hops being for bitterness; no apparent flavor. Pretty on for an English Brown. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a very gentle carbonation. A very drinkable beer, this is worth trying for sure."
"Sam Smith has done a fine job with this brew."
"Appearance is a rich brown with a thin creamy head. Aroma is lightly sweet with roasted malts. Taste is caramel sweet with roasted malts, nutty and light chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium with plenty of carbonation with a slightly burned aftertaste. Not my favorite brown, but worth a try."
"This is exactly what I want from English brown ale! But Didnt the bottle use to be clear?"
"drinkability is good. this isn't a thick or overpowering brew, but more restrained. it is smooth and mild, which is true to a good nut brown ale. the taste seems watered down at first, but the flavors show themselves and the complexity as the drinker familiarizes his/herself with it. a solid example of a nut brown ale."
"Not a huge fan of english browns, but I am trying to keep it from skewing my review. Overall from what I have had so far this one is very middle of the road."
"12 oz. bottle- color of medium to dark brown , with an alright tan head - nose of , nutty , malts , sweet burned , dark cherries , and ginger  taste of nutty , sour dark cherries , and burn coffee - body is medium , and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of slightly burnt , sour cherries , and malts"
"Medium brown pour with light tan head that didnt hang around for too long. Thin mouthfeel and not overly carbonated. Very flavorful-nut flavor is evident. Nut is also evident in the aroma with the slightest bit of hops. A very well-balanced and satisfying beer. Drinkability is good."
"The beer is good. There is not much of an aftertaste, and its not very complex. It is tasty, however, not overwhelming in hops or malts, but does provide a distinct taste. It is very drinkable, leaves you wanting another sip. I can not quite figure out exactly what I'm tasting in beer, but I'm not complaining. Its definitely an ale, no misleading there. I would recommend the beer for you."
"I used to drink this often, then moved away from brown ales as my hophead nature came to the fore. If, as the brothers say, ""brown is the new black", then this, in my opinion, is the standard bearer. Hands down, my favorite brown. T'ain't a cheap beer in many locales (I paid $5.99 for the single bottle ... or would have had the bartender not bought it for me for being willing to trade seats with a couple at a crowded bar) but it's well worth it.Seek it out and try it, especially if you're the least bit interested in browns."
"550ml clear bottle from Lou's in Augusta. More-or-less opaque brown bottle with a bit of chill haze and a half inch or so of light tan head. Smells roasty malty just the slightest hint of skunk. Roasty maltiness dominates the flavor as expected, with chocolate, caramel, and other malts playing major roles with just a hint of British hops. Creamy mouthfeel doesn't really hurt the drinkability. A pretty decent beer, and probably the best English brown I've had (apart from the hints of skunk)."
"Pours a dark brown color with a tan head. In the nose, I got a sweet aroma with fruity hints. It the taste was somewhat white grape-ish sweetness with a dry nutty end. The aftertaste was a bit fruity and small stickiness. A smooth and easy to drink ale, quite sessionish."
"D: A good English Brown, I'd buy again, but wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Bottom line: This Ale has everything going for it: great and complex taste, great nose, looks great in a glass and is so *darn* drinkable. It's a *must* try!!!"
"I was looking forward to trying this one becaus of the good experiences that I have had with Samuel Smith. It is a good brown ale, but it does not stick out as anything superior... in all actuality, I like it more than Newcastle, but for the price, I'll drink the Newcastle if I am looking to drink a decent brown ale."
"Even a light pour caused an aggressive head off white, brown-tinged head, but this settled down quickly to a thin, light brown film. Solid lacing. Light, clean brown with just a touch of red. Complex smell that got to my nose w/o me even putting my sniffer in the glass: nuts, molasses, grain, and a bit of earthiness too. Taste was mild, light, but quite nice. There's the nuttiness, and a creamy buttery quality too. Sweetness comes of more as caramel, but it also has a light touch. Low, low apparent hops that are there only at the very end. I might describe the taste as ""delicate," but that gives the impression that I don't like it. I do. It's delicate, but not fragile. Carbonation gives it an added crispness in the first part of the taste (and also at the finish). That is it peaks on both ends, with the creaminess coming through in the middle. As the carbonation dies down towards the end of the glass, the creaminess takes over. I think I actually prefer the lower lighter carbonation feel of the end of the glass. (That's why the mouthfeel sinks below the other scores.)"
"D- This beer is very drinkable. Easy to enjoy a pint just about anytime."
"This one is very easy drinking and I can easily polish off the 550ml bottle. I wish I had more."
"It poured out beautifully. The head didn't last too long though. It smelled quite good, except something in there did seem a bit off, which made me a little worried that it was going to be skunky. However upon tasting, it was definitely not. As for the taste, you know when when cartoon characters fight, and there is a ball of dust with arms and legs poking in and out. Well, thats what it seemed like was going on in my mouth. 3-4 different nutty and earthy tastes were fighting with each one taking its turn to jut out and show its flavor all in fast succession. Multiple different tastes going on at once, but they worked very well together for me. I could drink a few in one night, but it seems best to save and savor with only one per night."
"Overall a nice and very drinkable brown ale. Not a flavor explosion, but very nicely done."
"Picked this up at a Fresh Harvest store in Nacogdoches and poured it into a pint glass. It is a unique brown ale to me in both taste and color."
"This one poured from the bottle with plenty of creamy, foamy head that dissolved into thin lacing. The color is great - a deep brown, almost ruby color. The smell is definitely diacetyl- strong butterscotch, maybe a little citrusy. This thing is very complex on the taste, nutty for sure. Chewy, very filling. The hops come through at the end to end with a crisp note. I could drink this one forever."

"From trying the SS stouts, I am noticing a VERY similar taste in all of them. I find that odd. I will have to sample the Porter, as I only DRANK it out one night, at a concert at the Downstairs at the World Cafe Live in University City, Philadelphia. (yes, a nice beer selection there...) not fitting for a rating, after having multiple 60 Minute IPA's."
"Very drinkable, could probably have quite a few over a couple hours. It doesn't leave me craving another, though."
"M/D- both Ok. I don't find this to be the most interesting beer, so I would have to force myself to not only want to finish an entire bottle, but also drink more than 1. There is nothing really offensive about it though."
"D: 2-3 in any one setting. The sweetness does it in for me. I prefer to to be killed by roughness when it comes to brews."
"I was excited to try this one, since it was the top rated brown ale. However, I was a bit let down. Maybe it was a bad batch, or maybe the glass I poured it into hadnt been cleaned well enough. Poured into a pint glass from a 25oz. bottle. The beer poured a deep brown, forming a medium 1/2 inch head. Slight spots of lace along the glass. The aroma is of slight sweet malts and raisins. Not exactly what I want in a brown ale. The taste is very much the same. Very light sweet malt, followed by a less-than-pleasant raisin/prune taste. Medium mouthfeel. Easy finish and low alcohol content would make this an easy session ale. Overall, I must have had a bad batch, because this was exactly the opposite of what I expected. I will definitely be trying this brew again."
"Nice appearance, thick and persistent head (if you get this in a bottle, beware, because it fizzes like all-get-out!). Aroma is simply heavenly, with strong molasses overtone and some burnt hints. Taste does not quite match the aroma, but I did let the bottle sit for a bit before drinking. The flavor is very good, malty with a touch of bitterness and also a hint of sweetness. Thick, smooth, it is a delight to drink."
"Mouthfeel- awesome malty body with some caramel and the hops are about medium with a great balance to the malt. Earthy, nutty, and besides the price per bottle would be a go-to beer any day. A good froth on the palate does not change much and the nuttines comes out a just a little more. Fist SS I have had in the new dark brown bottle."
"D - As drinkable as it gets."
"Very smooth. Not too thick, not too thin. Very well done. When I think of an English Brown, this is the beer that comes to mind."
"Overall, I could see myself buying this somewhat often. I can imagine overlooking some of the subtle flavors if someone were to drink it too quickly. In fact, I was somewhat disappointed when I first started drinking this beer. Combined, perhaps, with the beer warming up, there was a lot more standing out. There is a certain talent in knowing how to drink beer, I guess."
"so drinkable, I really loved this beer, the nut flavors are delicious!"
"Taste is like fresh baked whole grain bread, there is a nice nutty flavor, there is a touch of sweet brown sugar, and just a tad of hops. Pretty well balanced beer. Mouthfeel is smooth, pleasantly carbonated, and medium bodied. A very easy drinking beer for sure. A classic Brown Ale, and one that originally turned me onto the style."
"Poured from a 550ml bottle into a Mug, the beer pours a dark brown color with a nice frothy one finger head with light lacing. The initial smell is of nuts and hops, and the first taste shares that with additions of caramel and a light toast taste. The beer is light bodied, with seemingly no warming behind it with little feel of carbonation. Gets better as it warms up, the beer opens up with a fuller body and fuller warmth than the first taste. A nice buy which I would like to have again."
"I could drink this again and again."
"Overall, this is a classic nut brown with awesome flavor. The flavors are bold, balanced and complex. A personal favorite. Easily one of the best nut brown ales out there."
"Drinkability - OK."
"I've never had it happen before, but it seems I've finally encountered a skunked Sammy Smith bottle. I really wish there was a freshness date on the bottle so I could see just how long this has been sitting. Disappointing."
"D: this is a great beer, very easy to consume and enjoy the flavors. truely a great brew, if anything the clean finish makes it more drinkable. very good. I think there is a faint tast of apples, but im not sure."
"Hmm, the appearance rocks, but I'm not getting much else from this bottles. Perhaps it needs to warm up? Not so much. This ale just doesn't come alive for me. There's a nutty, caramel malt flavor, but its too subtle. It's also a bit on the sweet side in aroma and flavor, almost like sugar was added. I can imagine this might be better by cask, but I was sold a bottle, alas."
"one of my all time favorites, pours a dark amber color with an average head with steady lacing. smell of dark malt, chocolate hints as well tastes amazing, complex and full, just a great beer all around. i can drink this stuff in the middle of the summer or winter day or night. best part is that it is easy to get my hands on and is relatively inexpensive"
"Comments: Another hit from Samuel Smith's. This may be one of my faves, alongside the Oatmeal & imperial Stouts."
"D - very flavorful beer. follow this one with a porter or a stout."
"D: It's smooth and sweet finish along with the touch of nut flavor makes this beer easy to drink for a long time."
"Overall really a great beer. I know I could have a couple in a sitting."
"D - A good brown ale, but not the best offering from Samuel Smith's."
"Well, as you'd expect, it's brown. It has a very nutty aroma, interweaved with rich, sweet malts. Imagine going to one of those buffets with the soft serve ice cream machine, and filling your bowl with the assorted sticky toppings mixed with peanuts. It also has a little alcohol kick at the end of each sip, more so as the beer gets warmer. The hops keep the sweet taste in check from being too sweet, and it makes for an overall pleasent drinking experience."
"Pours one finger head, tan, deep brown red color. Sweet malty odor, some nuts and mild spices, light coffee. Taste is mostly nuts and malt up front, some mild spicy hops to close, a little drying, a good amount of salt. Okay flavor, although fairly uneventful given the stronger aromas. Carbonation, for me, is too strong, definitely overpowering the flavor. Overall, an okay beer, but definitely not one of my favorites from Samuel Smith (that would be the Oatmeal Stout). I'd definitely drink it again if it was offered, although not sure if I'd go out of my way for it. Too much carbonation, too little flavor."
"Poured dark brown with a tan head that left average lacing. Big nose of roasted malts and caramel. Mouthfeel nice and rich and flavor followed he nose and there was a nice bitter finish with a hint of hops. Overall this was a very nice brew that is one of the better Browns I have seen."
"I could drink this brew for any occasion and want more after finishing each one. This is a very well balanced brew which, if just wanted to sit around and have a beer, is the one I would choose."
"Pours dark amber with two finger off white head.. Very pleasent malty, nutty, carmel flavor. Bitter & dry finish. Medium body, low carbonation. Drinkability is high, in others words I could drink this beer all day! In my opinion sets standard for this style."
"Drinkability: This beer is refreshing as hell, very light flavors, but nothing bad. Easy to drink and pleasant, I'd like to give it another go."
"Overall, this is just what I expected...a solid Nut Brown with many redeeming qualities that I would never turn down in a social setting."
"D - Good drinkability. Very enjoyable. Sweetness is low enough that I could go for 3 or 4 of these."
"brown in nature, brown in color. small head on my pour, cream color. smells sweet, and malty. tastes like caramel, and maybe chocolate. nothing here tastes nutty to me. Carbonic mouthfeel, light on the tongue but more on the back upper roof of the mouth, almost the throat. Drinkable, as a sipper, on a snowy night, and luckily this is one. Selected for such an occasion, and pleased with the choice/setting. will investigate other smuel smith beers... jury's still out here."
"I really like this not so distinguished beer. The classic nut brown malt, chocolate and smoky nut flavors. While this may be a bit thin for the purist this is a great everyday beer with a good combination of alcohol, bitterness and blend of ingredients. A good card playing brew if there ever was one."
"Good malt character with some caramel overtones on the tongue... bitter on the backend... sweet throughout with linger flavors long after it's gone."
"D - Really a very nutty beer, good all around and fun to drink."
"Stylistic Accuracy: Excellent"
"This is smooth stuff. It goes down so easily. It also seems to satisfy my appetite as well as quench my thirst. For me, this is one of those ""complete package"" beers; it tastes and smells great, isn't too light or strong, and can be enjoyed any time."
"This is the first brown ale I tried years ago and none other has been able to compare to it."
"This brown ale is heavy on taste and everything else. Poured a dark amber with generous lacing and head. Malt aromas dominate while some roasted characters come through. Taste was sweeter than expected, but well rounded out by the cool ale profile- some tree nut flavors coem from slightly roasted malts, on the verge of chocolate. Somewhat sticky on the mouth, and heavier than most brown ales but very flavorful."
"This beer pours a very nice dark brown color with a lot of red highlights, it has decent off white head which laces a bit. The smell is of wood, biscuit, butterscotch, toasted malt, hazelnut, walnut and hops, almost a bit of a brandy smell in there too. The taste is rich maltiness it is not sweet but not overly bitter either. The nut flavor comes through nicely. The mouthfeel is very good for a brown ale rich and deep with medium levels of carbonation the beer leaves a slight bitter aftertaste. Drinkability is very good, I'm a brown ale fan to begin with and this is a great example of what an english brown should be."
"Normally I could drink this all night, but not this particular beer. This one was not up to snuff. I know it is better than this, and I hope to review a fresher one soon. I wouldn't submit this review at all, but Samuel Smith and his crew need to be taken to task for their bottle coloring. This happens way to often. I was also recently burned by a heavily oxidized 4pack of the Winter Welcome. Shape up boys, or people will start thinking your beer actually does taste like dollar bills."
"Poured a dark brown color with decent tan head leaving no lacing. The smell is of roasted malt, almost coffee like, buttery toffee. The taste is of toffee, roasted malt, earthy. The mouthfeel is moderate, fizzy, no bitter aftertaste, a bit dry. This beer is quite good, nice complex flavors, great balance."
"Final Statment: A quaffable english brown ale with a nice flavour and not too heavy. I recommend this with some pub fare."
"D: Probably one of the most drinkable beers on the planet. Would make a great session brew. Also, would pair very well with a wide variety of foods. In my opinion, this is the current benchmark for the brown ale style. Well done."
"A very drinkable, sessionable brew. I feel it is a great example of the style, and would make a great brew to introduce an eager novice to the potentials of malts darker than standard macro fare. I've enjoyed this one before, and will gladly enjoy it again."
"Drank a large bottle of this before a football game Sunday. This beer pours a copper/amber color with a nice fluffy white head. Nice looking. Smells immediately like nuts and sugars. I worried it may actually be too sweet after the smell... Wrong, it as a nice taste. Some nuts and a slight spice with a mild bitter ending. This one has a strong finish, leaving an aftertaste that you do not want to wash down. I enjoyed this beer."
"I think the beer would benefit greatly from a brown bottle to get rid of that odd egg note but other than that the beer is a fine mild nut brown ale."
"Returning to this beer after over two years, it's apparent that sometimes it takes experience to appreciate a simple beer like this one. Back then I didn't know what to think, but now I appreciate it for its simplicity, it is exactly what it should be. However, I'm not a huge fan of the style and I didn't find this beer all that compelling."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a brown/reddish color with a thick off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. It smells like nuts, toasted malt, and caramel. It tastes the same way to me, except that there's some butterscotch I can taste, along with a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a small amount of carbonation. The drinkability is good, it's not hard to drink at all. Overall it's a good brown ale, one I'd definitely drink again."
"Note: One of the craft brews i've been drinking for over a decade, so this one gets sentimental points from me."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability  Not much hop flavor here, full, creamy body. Pleasant sweetness on the finish. Very enjoyable and drinkable."
"Nice to see this in a brown bottle now. Pours brown with a reddish tint. Nice tan head which it retains quite well. Aroma is bread like malts. Malty & nutty flavor with some roasted malt flavors. Mild hop bitterness. Medium bodied. Nice flavor. This is a good brown ale."
"Drinkability: This beer is extremely drinkable! The flavor it has makes me want another large sip as soon as i set it down. It really does leave a lingering flavor of fresh nuts. Iv'e yet to have a brown ale that can beat this one."
"Pours a very deep ruby red that goes brown if viewed from an angle, perfectly clear and with a big and frothy medium-light tan head that lasts very well, leaving lots of thick lacing. Smell is a bit faint, light roasted malts and breadiness, a hint of alcohol, mild chocolate and hazelnut. Taste is a bit of a letdown. Light caramel and breads take the lead, not much else. Slight bitterness, rather metallic, and a dry finish with little of the nuttiness that I'd been waiting for. Mouthfeel is full and rich, perhaps a bit flat, and drinkability is good. A bit of a disappointment from Sam Smith's. I'm a big fan of their beers, but this is rather middling and doesn't really make an impression."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass from a BROWN BOTTLE. Finally! Hopefully I never see another bottle of Sam Smith in a clear bottle. The beer pours with a tiny off-white head that leaves some lacing as I empty my glass and fill my gut. The aroma is minimal, with a bit of sweet, caramel malt aroma. Honestly, not much there in terms of aroma. A little swirl brings out some more sweet, malty aroma. The flavor brings on more sweet malt, bread, some roastiness and a slight acidity. Mouthfeel is what one might expect in a brown ale... not terribly heavy, but not light, either. This one goes down smooth - not quite silky or creamy, but definitely smooth. Drinkable? Yup. I can finish a bomber without much effort and could probably down another. Overall, not a bad beer, though not anything I'd deem special, either."
"i must say, yay for brown bottles! after a few skunked sam smith beers, i'd resigned to only buying their gift boxes to get the nicely protected beer inside. so i was very happy to see that they had switched to brown bottles. this one definitely doesn't disappoint. another fine brew from sam smith."
"No element of Nut Brown Ale stands out as being wonderful. Alternatively there are no flaws. All the flavors compliment each other and are modest. This is a beer I could drink everyday."
"D: Would enjoy another, especially if in the mood for an English brown, but there are some other Sam Smith varities I'd prefer. Nevertheless, a quality offering."
"Pours a dark deep slightly transparent brown with small off white head. Smells of rich toffee, hazelnut, and almost caramel immediately jump from this beer. Has strong nutty/chocolate/caramel flavors with a rich malt finish. Not much in the way of hoppiness, which is typical of a nut brown. Its a little too sweet and sugary in the palate, feeling like they added molasses at the end. Good beer, nonetheless"
"Notes: My local grocery store just started carrying Samuel Smiths. So if you live in the University area of Charlotte, NC check out he Lowes Food Store on Davis Lake to get this treat."
"Dgood. A solid brown ale. Glad I bought this gift pack!"
"Decent beer from a good brewery. Perhaps it is the ""old style"" of brewing, but this just has WAY too much diacetyl/butterscotch for me. I don't think I'd buy it agian."
"A pleasant and very drinkable brown ale."
"Overall, quite drinkable. The beer has a nice balance that will not offend. Good session beer. Also, goes nice with a variety of food [e.g. veal, burgers, etc.]."
"D- Very drinkable. Not too strong, not too bold, not too weak, not at all boring. Great beer for anytime."
"Slainte!"
"D - This is the strong point of this one for me. Easy to drink, being neither too sweet nor dry, and tasty without being over the top."
"A great beer, and certainly one of the pinnacles of the English Brown Ale style."
"A nice ale. one I'd definitely get again."
"Pours a deep, rich syrupy/honey like appearance into the mug with a bit of lacing. The aroma is perfect, of a light sweetness mixed with toffee, malts, syrup and nutty flavors. The taste is rich and pure with smoky toffee, malts, and just a slight bit of bitterness for a nice balance. Mild in the mouth with good, crisp balance. This is very drinkable, you have to be careful to pace yourself so that you can enjoy it and not gulp it down. One of many great Samuel Smith brews."
"Overall, a very pleasant and easy drinking beer."
"Very good beer, and yet another great product from Samuel Smith. I recommend this one."
"Easy to drink, classic english session ale."
"Appearance is deep brown, with reddish highlights and a thick tan creamy head and excellent lacing. Aromas are sweet and nutty, with a hint of toast. Tastes much like it smells, big toasty nut malt flavor up front with a slight hoppy bitterness in the finish. Overall a very drinkable beer, definitely worth storing in my memory bank as solid beer."
"Pours a medium to dark brown with a white head, semi malty aroma with a white head that would have been bigger if i didnt fill my pint glass to the brim. A solid standard for this style of beer, medium bodied biscuity malt with a touch of hops. Very drinkable and very enjoyable. Another beer that makes me re-evaluate the need for extreme beers, sometimes simple is just as enjoyable."
"I just noticed that this is my 50th review and I'm glad that I had such a fascinating beer on this mildly important occasion. Cheers!"
"Very sharp and crisp, this is one fine brew from the lads across the pond. Pity the importing raises the price of this drinker to $2.50 for a 12 0z brew. This would be a great session brew at 8-10 dollars for a sixer."
"This beer poured a clear brown color with a small but persistent head. The taste is malty with a definite hazelnut characteristic. The mouthfeel is thick and slightly chewy. This is a highly drinkable beer that would be appropriate on most occasions. (A personal favorite)."
"Overall, this is quite a darn good little brown ale. It paired quite well with my extra sharp cheddar. I love the nutty character it has that rides with the very mellow bready malt character. Definitely recommended for fans of the style or similar."
"Note to Self: Ranked #1 English Brown Ale when I tried it."
"550 mL clear bottle. Orange-tinted chestnut with an impressive undulating sandy foam cap. Very nice head retention. Slowly-rising, sparse carbonation. An earthy and toasted character forms the base of the aroma, but I'm surprised to detect a considerable amount of leafy and grassy smelling hops. A sweetish hazelnut aroma appears as well. Unfortunately I don't pick up any of the famed nuttiness of this ale in the flavor at first. More than anything, I taste slightly sour, doughy malts with a bit of caramel, and a bracing finish of hard-as-nails Burton water. However -- as the beer warms, the soft nuttiness slowly emerges as does a demure leafy hop flavor. Greatly improves as it warms. Lesson learned: don't chill this beer too much! The mouthfeel is soft and velvety smooth. After more time, a pleasant fruitiness comes through in the flavor. When served properly (i.e., only slightly cool), this is a fine, sessionable ale. My guess is that this one must be outstanding from a cask."
"D - Drinkable if not particularly complex. Solid beer."
"i did this in a side by side comparison with sweetwater's sweet georgia brown. they are very similar but i think the SGB is slightly better. and then when you compare the price $7 for 6 of SGB compared to $9 for 4 of the sam smith. SGB is the clear winner but this is one i would still pick up from time to time."
"This beer has a really nice malt character to it, the interesting malt tapestry that this beer weaves is its selling point. It is quite easy drinking, and I am enjoying it, but it could use a bit more oomph, or even a bit more character. Not bad, and certianly a touch better than the pale ale from the same brewery."
"Mouthfeel is very thick and nicely carbonated. I could drink this beer all day. Definetly a session beer."
"I was really looking forward to this beer. Picked one up at Half Time in NY. Pours a beautiful brown and the smell is sweet with hints of nuts & toffee. Leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass with a small, foamy white head. The taste is sweet & it goes down smooth. I enjoyed this beer a lot, but would probably take a Brookln Brown over it."
"Pours brown-maroon with excellent clarity. Two and a half finger pale biege head, sinks to one finger of dense soap bubbles and holds well. Leaves light spotty lacing. Toasted pale malt and crystal nose, nutty aroma is prominent with faint english hops in the background. Sweet crystal malt flavor, some pale malt, and roasted chestnuts. The semi-dry aftertaste presents appropriate fuggles flavor and just enough hop bitteness to keep the mild diacetyl note a pleasent accent in the overall tone. Low carbonation and medium-low body, very smooth with an unrivaled drinkability. Mild finish, lingering malt sweetness but non-residual and a balancing herbal hop character. This the first beer that comes to mind when I am in the mood for a brown ale, and also, the best example of the style I can think of."
"I loved the way this beer looked. A very nice dark red color with a little head from the pour. Just beautiful. The smell wasn't overwhelming to me, and I had a hard time getting much out of it, which left me a little disappointed. That disappointment was gone once I got a taste of this, though. I could definitely see why this beer was called a ""Nut Brown Ale."" You can definitely taste some roasted nuts along with some other fairly sweet undertones. Combine that with a great mouthfeel and you get a beer that I wish I had the opportunity to enjoy more often."
"In summary, an excellent representation of a nut brown, by far one of the best I've tried."
"I've been impressed with other nut brown ales before, as well as other Samuel Smith beers, but this is exceptional. Great smell, great taste, etc. Definitely a beer to be enjoyed if you like darker ales and a bit of hops too."
"Cheers!"
"A nice brown ale. Will have to re-review it and hope for a better bottle next time."
"Pours a very dark clear copper color with a nice creamy head. Nutty aroma with malt and caramel. Taste starts out sweet and finishes dry and nutty. There are also some caramel and buttery flavors as well in there. This is truly a delicious beer. I really enjoy dry malty brews and this one sure does not dissapoint."
"Very good beer all around. Quite sessionable too."
"Overall - An excellent beer... Very drinkable and definitely worth a try. If only they would do away with the clear glass bottle...."
"Pours a clear and very dark brown/amber with a small but persistant slightly off-white head. Aroma is heavy nutty and malty. Flavor starts with sweet malt and finishes a bit nutty with some dry spicy hop bitterness. Medium mouthfeel with heavy carbonation. Quite smooth. Very nice flavor but is a little heavy to be very drinkable."
"Eric"
"Drinkability - Yes, it goes down easily, but for me personally, I'm just not that into the taste, so I'm not going to drink a lot of this."
"A very drinkable brew and an excellent example of this style."
"Overall I would rate this beer as a great session beer, one that I would definately drink again but again one that I could not drink all the time lest I get spoiled on the taste."
"Overall Impression: Solid brew. Ive always had a soft spot for Samuel Smiths, and their nut brown in particular. Finally coming back around to review it I can see why. Wonderful balance that lets each taste come through. Simple and clean, an easy session beer. Nice to come back to visit."
"I feel like this beer is bascially a standard, defining for it's style. It is pale/brown in appearance, slight head. Smell is kind of sweet and carmely. The taste, well all I have to say about it is sweet nutty goodness. The mouthfeel is kind of a weak point, lower carbonation, not really watery, but something like that. Quite drinkable, a good inbetween season beer."
"A fantastic English Brown Ale, kind of expensive but worth the cost."
"Drinkability is above ave. This is an anytime beer. Quench your thirst, wash down a meal or just savor the flavors slowly in your big chair."
"Drinkability is high! It's a good thing this comes in a 550 ml bottle, because just one 12 oz serving wouldn't be enough."
" Medium bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Definitely one of my long time favorites for the style. I plan to continue drinking this one whenever the chance comes along."
"A very drinkable beer that I would gladly have again and next time I might not share!"
"D- This beer had a good strong nutty flavor which many nut brown ales lack. That was a very nice part of the beer but there were some slight off flavors in the toasted malt and I don't think the clear glass bottles helped."
"D: The definition of a flavorful session beer. Low alcohol, good carbonation level, clean finish, mmm."
"Overall- a tasty Brown Ale that slighty pulls its punches. You'll not be disappointed."
"Very nutty taste upfront, followed by outstanding hops character. This is a nice, nutty brown ale, my only problem with it is, IT IS WAY OVERPRICED!! 9 bucks for 4 beers at 5% is outrageous. I don't mind paying that amount for belgians or a great DIPA but enough of that. This beer is good, but a little boozy considering the low alcohol content. Whiskyish finish and very dry. A good beer overall."
"This brew pours a dark brown color with reddish hues around the edges of the glass. The head is one finger in height, creamy and recedes slowly into a thin layer of lacing that covers the whole glass. The aroma is of milk chocolate, caramel with a touch of Samuel Smith's house aroma but not as much of it as other Sameul Smith beers. The taste is...well, it is nowhere near as good as the aroma. The caramel and the house taste are still there, but the chocolate isn't. The mouthfeel is what would be expected from a brown ale: medium-light bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this might not be the best brown ale in the world, but it is damn good nonetheless."
"A credit to it's style, and a beer that screams attention for it's being."
"Mmmm. I love finding a Sam Smith's beer without their trademark scent/flavor - that licorice or herbal quality. This is definitely missing that, and benefits from being without it."
"Poured a crystal clear deep mahagony color with large creamy tannish head. Attractive lacing as the head slowly fell to a thin surface coating. Smell is extremely nice with strong notes of ripe fruit, caramel, toffee, and toasted malt. Very pleasant mixture. Taste is slightly malty with a bit of caramel. Suprisingly dry with a very strong bitterness. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Easy drinking but too much hoppiness and bitterness for my liking."
"It poured a deep brown with a little red, a big frothy head, and lots of lacing. The aroma was nutty and malty, just as one might expect. The taste really can't get much better - well-rounded flavors and just the right amount of hops. It had sufficient body and a decently long finish. Very enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Excellent flavor, although a bit stiff tasting in terms of alcohol. Rich nuttiness accumulates on the tongue producing a finer and finer taste. Not at all filling. Superb."
"This beer poured with a thick frothy head. It is a deep rown color. The smell is of similar to coffee with cream. The taste is a little sharp for a brown ale. There is a lingering bitterness. Not too bad though. The drinkability is fair. As far as brown ales go, this one is mid pack. I could drink again if need be. Overall, an average brew."
"mouthfeel is nice, full and creamy. very smooth and drinkable also. one of the best brown ales by far."
"This is a fantastic beer and before you jump on that Sam Smith is in a clear bottle and should be boycotted wagon, consider this, I have never had a skunked bottle. This one was no different. A very sexy beer in my opinion. A nice dark brown body, still tansparent and all, and a really thick creamy tan head on top. I poured it into my favorite imperial pint with just enough head to allow the aroma to form. Smells grassy and nutty. I love the taste of this one. Very well balanced, and an excellent kick of nutty aroma. I get a lot of vanilla type flavors and something I best describe as butterscotch. It has a syrupy body. A very nice beer to just chill out with at the end of a long day."
"Aroma was a difficult one to judge as I am a little congested from allergies right now, but it seemed to be a quite mild aroma on the malty side. Flavor was good with that usual Samuel Smiths aftertaste in the swallow. A good English Brown Ale with a dryness in the finish that enhances the drinkability."
"With no real offending trademarks, a pleasant flavor and mouthfeel, low ABV and fairly wide availability, this can only be considered easily drinkable. Very straightforward brown ale that doesn't leave much for the imaginative drinker to interpret, but that's cool. It is what it is."
"Drinkability/mouthfeel: This beer is really smooth and easy to drink. Very balanced in terms of malt and hops, and have a wonderful finish. Its not one I pick up too often, but when I do I am always happy."
"I haven't had a ny Samuel Smith products in like forever. This is what a nut brown ale should taste like. It's a medium brown color with a moderate head and some nice lacing. It has a chocolate/ malt odor, and a coffee taste with a small bit of hoppiness. Good body, not thin tasting. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: This is not my favorite beer it is a bit to bitter for my taste but I would say it is certainitly average as far as drinkablitly"
"Very drinkable. Certainally had better nutbrowns, but this was my first & still shines as great example of the style"
"I'd drink it again, but probably rather try some other brown ales."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Disappointingly mundane, in that the carbonation is too weak to keep the beer exciting. It is consistent, not dying off into nothing... but a boring kind of consistent. For an English Brown, is drinks easily and the low ABV promotes session drinking."
"Aroma is fairly strong, with heavy malt sweetness. Nuts and caramel almost make this smell like desert. Medium body with a fairly carbonated mouthfeel goes down with some hoppy bitterness toward the end. Taste is sweet, nutty, toasted malt with a bitter dose of hops to balance things out. Lots of flavor and depth make this a very enjoyable brown ale. Not too sweet like American browns tend to be. I like this beer for it's great appearance and bold flavor."
"Another great offering from Tadcaster. Is this the best premium brewery out there?"
"The beer pours a clear chestnut brown color with a 1/4 inch head that lingers in the glass and leaves a nice bit of lacing too. Aroma is malty and slightly caramelly. Taste is sweet and malty with hints of caramel and toffee. I could taste a light hop bitterness. This beer was smooth on the palate and quite drinkable. It reminds me of a stronger English mild. Quite tasty."
"A reddish brown color with a nice head that diminished, but a good portion of it stuck around the whole time. A good amount of lacing also. An excellent flavor, nutty,malty, ever so slightly fruity, not too heavy and very drinkable. Mouthfeel was nothing special, but overall this is a great brew that I could drink year round. Very pleased and will definately buy again."
"Appeared a dark rust color in my pint glass with a soft, off-white colored head that left quickly and left behind some lacing. Low level of carbonation is present. Aromas of pine nuts, peanuts, and fruit juice seemed apparent to me. The taste was a bit sweeter than I expected with fruity undertones that contrasted nicely with the bitter flavors in the beer. Relatively thin in my mouth without a comprehensive texture or feel. A bit sour in the aftertaste. I had one of these and that's all I wanted for quite awile."
"This beer pours a translucent brown with a nice frothy off white head that dissapates but leaves a thin film for a while which eventually dissipates. The smell is priarily roasted nutty malts with hints of sweetness. The taste is the spotlight of the beer. The taste here is primarily hazlenut roasted malts. This is a fantastic flavor in a brown ale. there is a good thickeness here with a good carbonation. Overall this is one of the best brown ales I have had. I would certainly prefer Rogue's Hazlenut Brown nectar but other than that Brown ales do not get much better than this."
"Mouthfeel is mid bodied and lively. Perhaps just a tiny bit thick. This is a light, playful, but still very complex beer I could drink gallons of."
"Notes: I will have to hook up my friends with this one when they come up to visit. This is the standard for brown ales everywhere!"
"While this is a good beer and perhaps the standard by which many brewers judge their own brown (nut-brown) ales it certainly doesn't reach out and seduce me. This is more of your casual sipping beer to enjoy on a lazy evening. Drinkability suffers a little in this respect."
"."
"This, my friends, is my favorite beer."
"Samuel Smith does not disappoint."
"This beer pours an amber or chestnut color with foamy off white head. Smells of floral sweetness, undertones of malts, sweet grape smells, and bits of butterscotch. Clean malty tastes with a buttery taste. There is still a dryish sweetness to this beer that reminds me of grapes. Medium body with earthy tastes and an aftertaste that is dry and a little bitter. Very drinkable beer and right on the spot for a nut brown."
"Slightly dry, creamy smooth and very drinkable. One won't be enough."
"I had two in about 15 minutes, it was good."
" Not my favorite nut brown ale, but I'm also starting to think it's not one of my favorite styles. Well made and decent but not top notch for me."
"Extremely drinkable. Possibly addictive...?"
"Extremely easy to drink this beer."
"For any one who likes Brown Ales, or wants to develop a greater appreciate for the style, you cant afford to pass this one up: its not the best Brown Ale out there, but it is widely considered a classic and is, at least my opinion, the example to which all others of the style should be compared. Recommended."
"Opinion: I am a pretty big fan of Sam Smith's beers...but this particular one is not my favorite. It seems to be a bit too light for the water and ingredients they use. I believe that the water has something to do with the harsh flavor you get from this beer. I prefer to stick to Sam Smiths darker beers."
"Overall: Another wonderfully pleasant Samuel Smith offering, and one I'll keep drinking."
"What I have come to expect from Sam Smith, especially the non-stout Sam Smiths. Once you get used to the yeast character (at least that is what I think I am tasting with the must) it is great. Really grows on you."
"D - A nice beer to drink, both as a session ""quaffer"" and one that has enough going on to make you want to sip."
"Very balanced, smooth and drinkable, an almost flawless nut brown. Delicious."
"A very good nut brown ale...a little better than Newcastle but the difference is not huge in my opinion.."
"Pours with a thin, wispy white head. Nose is malty, accented with overtones of toffee and caramel. The same characteristics follow through in the taste. Hops are in the background here, the big maltiness takes the lead role here - toffee, caramel, a bit of coffee. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but fits the style well. A tasty nut brown ale that's a pleasure to drink."
"The smell is quite nutty and slightly roasty, as compared to say Newcastle. Also has a bit of the sweet buttery toffee aroma that seems to be a trademark British flavor, particularly with brown ales. The taste is very much the same, adding a small bit of a caramel flavor to the toffee. This is still one of my favorite brown ales of the English variety."
"Perhaps a fresher sample would favor a better offering. Not bad though. Finish did it for me; somewhat. This was a slightly above average Brown. It has some interesting characteristics that do bring to mind the more English style, which this most certainly is."
"I think that this is the cookie cutter for nut brown ales. This is the one. Other breweries base their beers on this one. If you arent sure what a nut brown should be, give this a go and dont be surprised if you fall in love. Good stuff!"
"D: Very drinkable. Moderately full body & carbonation would prohibit the consumption of multiple gallons."
"Pours a bronzish color which has ruby delicate ruby tones in the light. head is high and lasts with sticky lacing everywhere. Taste is oh so nice, hitting the mouth with a surprising and delightful milkiness which is uncommon in a beer that looks like this one. Taste is spot on for the style, smooth, rich, and full of complex flavor components ranging from strong cinnamon type spices to malty butterscotch and definitely nuts as the beer warms up. I definitely reccomend trying this a bit warmer than normal because it really allows the depth of the flavors to be on display. Probably a bit rich to sit and make a night of this beer but the first one goes down so fast that you'll have to drink at least one (or five) more. A fantastic example of the syle, a superior brew as is expected from this brewery which almost never seems to miss the mark."
"Had this on tap at the Flying Saucer in Fort Worth. Appearance was good, deep brown with some red highlights and a nice foamy head with a few minutes of staying power. Aroma is sweet and nutty. Hazelnut, maple syrup, malt, perhaps a bit of cinnamon or nutmeg? Taste is a bit syrupy, with definite nuttyness. I would say mostly hazelnut or chestnut. Some dark spices floating on top of a yeasty undercurrent. A bit lighter than one would think in the mouth - somewhat over-carbonated, maybe because it was on-tap. I could have one of these, but it's not something I would like to drink several of."
"Goes down easy, a little to easy ;-) I like this much better than all the other nut brown ales I've tried. I'm actually pissed that I split the bottle with my wife. This is probably the best beer I've had to date."
"Mouthfeel is rich and with a pleasant aftertaste. This beer is more filling than I would have guessed. Not my favorite style at all, but certainly not a bad brew. If you like Newcastle, try this."
"This is my first reveiw of a beer. All and All I have to say it tastes much like most brown ales. The flavor is smooth and it is drinkable, but so are all brown ales. I gave it an average rateing because nothing deffertiates this beer from the others I've tried ( although until recently my experience has been whofully limited). I can honestly I don't yet understand all the terms that most of you use, but it looks a dark brown amber in the glass. It smells like it tastes. Its bitter when it first touches the tongue, and then becomes smother the longer it's held there. As for drinkability I would choose this before some but after some. Please bare with my reveiws, as I am new to this."
"Overall = This is above average but nothing really to talk about. Reminds me of many other brown ales and doesn't have enough to push it above the pack."
"Drinkability: If someone offered me this beer I would not refuse. Its a nice nutty earthy beer but the beautiful color raises your expectations only to dissapoint with an average taste."
"Edit: This is absolutely divine with gruyere."
" This would effect the taste and how it pours. Always does pours great , does not have much to any head and with some bubbles at the end of each bottle. The stone effect would also awsomely increase the flavor and tastes as well, for as samuel smith's but brown does still remain One of the best's!"
"Not a session brew, but a very good and malty brown ale that I would like to have again."
"Fairly creamy smooth mouthfeel. Nicely drinkable, but for $8, I felt a bit disappointed to be sure."
"Drinkability: Sure its easy drinking, but I'm just not thrilled by it. While I would not hesitate to have the Oatmeal Stout, this one I will not rush out to get again. Somewhat disappointed by it."
"Smells light, aley and deliscious. Almost nutty. Very enticing. The head is tightly and loosely bubbled at the same time with an off-white hue and it lasts quite a while. The flavor is light with sweet malt and light but present hopping. Somewhat of a nutty aftertaste that begs you take another sip. Not an overly complex flavor, but quality. Recommended"
"Still, a good beer even on it's worst days."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. I could have a few of these in a sitting."
"Overall impression: Very enjoyable brew - very distinctive from other nut browns I have tried."
"Mouthfeel is very nice, full and easy to drink. Hoppiness reduces overall drinkability a bit for me (although I know not everyone will agree)."
"Man, this is the epitome of what a good Nut Brown Ale should be. Poured out to a brown color with a nice 1/3 inch head. No lacing in the glass. Medium-low carbonation. Aromas of roasted nuts, grain, toasted malt and molassas. Taste was similar to the aroma, with a few unexpected flavors. Complexity is abound; flavors of nuts, hops, mild malts and a touch of butterscotch sweetness. Great aftertaste of bitterness and sweetness. Mouthfeel was good, but couldn've been a bit thicker. Nonetheless very nice all around. High drinkability. I will be seeing more of this beer. Recommended."
"d - excellent! this is what good beer should taste like! complexity on the palate with a strong (but not overpowering) finish. i could drink this all day and all night."
"Pours a dark brown color with nice carbonation, small head, a little bit of lacing afterwards from a clear bottle. Scents of malt, sweet caramel. Nice taste sweet, malty, and nutty. Medium body with a dry finish. At 5% ABV would make a good session brew. The clear bottle throws me off."
"Pours a very deep ruby red colour. An average offwhite head quickly settles and laces the glass like a champ all the way down. Smells of sweet maltiness with caramel and faint traces of coffee. Tastes like heaven. Sweet and creamy maltiness up front is gorgeously followed by a clean and dry finish. Absolute luxurious mouthfeel. Smooth as a baby's ass and smooth as all hell. I could drink this one all day, every day. The best Nut Brown money can buy, and as far as I am concerned one of the best brews out there."
"(No head as poured at bar) I can tell this is going to be a redundant review, for poured from the tap, is pretty similar to from the bottle. Dark brown body with a tan head. Toasted malt nose. Flavor is sophisticated; toasted malt and hops with good bitterness. Mouth is watery, leading to good drinkability. Theres a nice bitter finish. A good bitter ale."
"Pours a brown color with a medium head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is a little nutty with some biscuit-malt character and not much hop. The flavor is much the same - lots of nuttiness and low carbonation. The body is moderate and the drinkability is very good."
"Samuel Smiths Nut Brown Ale pours to a dark brown color reminiscent of cola. The thick, creamy head helps reinforce that image. The nose suggests lightly roasted malt, and the palate is very malty, creamy, somewhat nutty (hence the name) with a unique mushroomy character almost akin to a Ringwood ale. Theres a touch of butter albeit a light one, and a surprisingly fruity finish, which strongly hints at melon and pear. A light toffee character and subtle roastiness permeate the beer as well."
"Pours a nice hamagony color with a 2 finger head that fallst of a finger over the beer. The nose is slightly skunked with a nice mellow toasted nut aroma. No real sweetness is found. The flavor is okay. I get good nutty flavors with some light grapeskin flavors as well. The mouthfeel is moderate with a light carbonation. Overall, I find it to be an okay brew. The skunkyness in the initial aroma was not all that nice. There is someting in the flavor that is not doing it for me. I can't place it, but its a little harsh on the finish. Not bad...not great."
"After drinking a lot of high gravity beers lately, it's nice to have a lower bodied beer with the roasted complexity, well brewed, matured, and handled beer that's more easily drinkable and less alcoholic. The look is of solid brown with deep amber highlights. Aromas and flavors of good old barley malt, nicely roasted or toasted. Good caramel, toffee, and butterscotch flavors. Cashews and hazlenut flavors deep into the body. The body is smooth without being thick or cloying. Sweet, but balanced with light hop bittering and slight yeasty sour notes. Finishes mildly sweet and bitter from hops and grain. A good beer to get back to basics."
"Pours a ruddy brown/garnet with a short off-white head and some decent lacing. Smell is grainy malt, a little metallic, with a hint of nuttiness. Taste follows this trend, roasted malts, bitter hops, with the lightest hint of nut. I would have liked to see a little more caramel malt, nutty character, it all seemed a little too subtle for me, but I've found this to be the case with most of the British ales I've tried. American micros just tend to have the balls to try new and exciting things in old traditional styles like the brown ale. Rather drinkable overall, but nothing phenomenal here. There are certainly more interesting American examples out there."
"Notes: Sole US distributor - Merchant du Vin"
"After completing the 550ml bottle I'm craving more....this is truly an exceptional beer that has most likely taken alot of time/care/respect to produce."
"from the way it starts, it should be a better brew. Most of the beers I've had from Sam Smith seem to have a strangely astringent finish. I'll give it another go sometime in the future."
"This one is a good beer, I found myself most dissapointed with the head of all things, but I also have no way of knowing just how old the sample I acquired from the store is, because the bottle lacked a drink by or freshness date of any kind. The taste is not over powering and neither is the abv too high. I could find myself drinking a few of these at sitting if the mood struck me. A very enjoyable beer."
"Appearance is a dark mahogany with good foam and lacing. Aroma is, indeed, nutlike, with some rich scents of caramel. Initial taste is composed of creamy smooth yeast balanced by bitter hops that work well. Finish leaves a pleasant taste on the tongue  dry and creamy, like Baileys Irish Cream. Well done!"
"An average dark brown, slightly cloudy brown ale. Did have a pretty, even white head and excellent lacing. Smells earthy, musty, dank and alcoholic. Mostly just tastes sweetly alcoholic. Though it's called a nut brown ale, the only nuttiness in this is in the aftertaste, which is by far the most pleasant part of my experience with this beer. It reminds me of the Tommyknocker Imperial Nut Brown, but that at least had a 10% ABV to explain its unpleasantness. I really don't understand why this is rated so highly; apparently I just don't ""get"" this particular kind of brown ales."
"Note: half an hr. later, I developed an allergy. could it be the nuts in it? dunno. I had to drink more beers later during the night, so to rest assured that it's not related to beer in general. Still, this was ok."
"Overall, more drinkable than a Newcastle, but nothing I'd seek out in a bar."
"Drinkability: Due to the low alcohol content, this would make a good session drink. This is a very common brown ale that exerybody should try and something that I would buy again. Keep up the good work Samuel Smith!"
" Overall a very smooth, easy drink'n nut brown. Great job Sammy!"
"500 mL bottle with no freshness date - served chilled in a mug. Pours a ruby/garnet color that kinda looks like tea and it's topped with a 1 inch tan head that keeps a thin blanket throughout but doesn't leave lace on the glass. Sweet grains and hops in the aroma along with some sweet chocolate, nuts, dark fruits, apples, and perhaps cherries. Toasty malts on the palate contribute caramel, molasses, biscuits, dark fruits, apples, and maybe even chocolate covered cherries. The hops leave a nice bitterness and leafy/floral flavors. It has a medium body and very nice carbonation. Wow. It is complex and delicious, constantly reminding me of the flavors in Rochefort 10. I've had this once before but it wasn't near this good - I think the first one may have had some skunk due to the clear bottle."
"I had this beer out of the clear bottle, the beer was a red-brown and smelled sweet with a nutty tone to it and formed a decent head. The taste was very nutty, the carbonation was low, very flavorful but with little emphasis...if that makes any sense. A very creamy and smooth drink, not very crisp, but quite delicious. Highly recommended."
"I was VERY impressed with my first Samuel Smith. It has a very pleasant smell and appearance, with its dark brown color in it's clear glass bottle made it very tempting to drink. The mouthfeel is rich with a bit of a bite at the end. The first taste is of a well brewed ale with a touch of roasted almonds and brown sugar then finishes smoothly with alittle spice and a bit of bite. A very good beer for the winter season and an excellent beer to ponder. It is available in a case of twenty four or a four pack of twelve ounce bottles, just enough beer to come up with your own review."
"Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale is classic beer. I can imagine a better version, but I don't know that I've had a better version. There is very little wrong with this one and I'm sorry it took me so long to find that out. I'm grateful to be able to add another beer to the depressingly too short list of locally available worthies."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink and a darn good nut brown."
"Pours a deep red-brown with a finger of beige head and a little lacing. Smells sweet and nutty with a hint of roasted malts. Taste is sweet and malty upfront fading into a dry hazelnut aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little thin and watery, with a rather low carbonation level. This is as good of a English brown ale I've had, but there's just something about the style that comes up short for me."
"A super easy-drinking brown ale. Very nice session beer."
"Drinkability is ok if one can tolerate the slight astringent finish."
"A very drinkable brown ale, not too bitter and not too heavy. Actually I am surprised it is not rated higher. I think it's quite good."
"Smaller clear bottle, without any freshness dating to be had. Pours dark honey amber and just about clear. Light almost white head and some non-descript lacing left behind. Nice nutty/malty nose. Lovely malty, subtle nutty ale, clean and refreshing. Classic British take on the style, IMHO, fine, fine sessioner."
"Very nice chestnut colored beer. Quite nice head that receedes for the most part leaving a small tan covering on the beer. Moderate aroma-somewhat bready and yeasty. Nice, nutty malt flavor. Traces of caramel. Very low bitterness. Deliciously smooth body. An excellent beer overall. Nicely balanced on all points. A classic for sure."
"Definately something one should have around at all times."
"Pours a nice, stained mahogany colour with a firm, bu thin head. Lace sticks to the glass like veneer. Sweet smell. Butterscotch, sweet malts, walnuts, pecans, hazelnuts and a dry hop smell that's not quite grassy. Delicious. Starts sweet. With some malts, butterscotch, and english toffee, with a blend of mixed nuts. Ends dry, with the nutty taste dominating and an earthy texture. Smooth, creamy, even a buttery mouthfeel. Drinkable? Oh hell yes. I'll be buying this beer, and this style, more often."
"Mouthfeel is nice with enough carbonation to keep the palate clean. Also despite the looks this is not a heavy beer and seems medium to light bodied. Drinkability is good. This would go well with foods, but I dont see this as a session beer as the flavour would grow a bit weary after a few."
"Drinkability: Nice complex flavors make it wonderfully drinkable. Serving it too cold robs it of most of its good flavors and complexity. It sits well with food."
"SS Nut Brown is dark reddish-brown with an average-sized brown head. Head is creamy and has above average retention. The aroma has a light malty sweetness with touches of nuttiness and spice. The taste has the malt profile of a good brown ale with a subtle nutty flavor. Hops provide just a tiny hint of drying and spice. Drinkability is great, however I was expecting more from Samuel Smith with this beer and I was hoping that Nut Brown would be more robust."
"It's brown alright. Reddish brown; auburn. A decent head which lingers a bit then leaves a bit of clottage. The aromas are of caramel, sweet malts, a flowery, grassy note; nutty, of course, or toasted grain. The taste is simultaneously clean and earthy; roasted malt and a pervasive gentle bitterness; yeasty and buttery. Medium bodied and smooth. It all works together to deliver a heavenly brew. Session beer? Absolutely."
"Medium bodied, good drinkability."
"Pours a clear dark reddish-brown, with small and slow carbonation bubbles making their way up. A small tan head that doesn't last. Smells of zuchini bread, with a whiff of cola. Malty taste of molasses and walnuts, with a very pleasant, creamy texture. Medium bodied, finish of a light coffee bitterness and a deep nuttiness."
"The beer poured a robust dark amber with a wonderful ruby glow, and developed a small tan head. The aroma was classic Samuel Smith. It had plenty of malt and hops and got you ready for what was to come. The taste was pretty straightforward and again classic Samuel Smith's. It had a rich malty taste up front with just a dab of sweetness to it, then rounded out into a nicely balanced hop finish. That small sweet kick was really all that I saw different between the Nut Brown and the Tadcaster Ale, so loving the one I had to love the second. In fact that slight difference might put me in the Nut Brown column instead of the Taddy. It had a nice medium body to it and as usual you got a nice quenching and satisfying fullness to the taste and feel. Samuel Smith consistently delivers really quality beers that you can truly enjoy. The taste and feel show excellence in both the brewing and the ingredients. This is the type of beer that would show anyone the light of quality beers."
"I received the Gift Box containing 3 Samuel Smith beers, this is the first time I am trying this brand. The ale poured beautifully into the pint glass provided in the gift set. A nice foamy light brown head, not a huge head but very foamy looking, if that makes sense. A very woody/roasted nut smell, and a clean pleasant taste. A decent mouth feel but almost that of a cold soda. It's a nice beer to sip but not to drink too fast. The head disappears rather fats and leaves a slight lacing on the glass. It's a decent beer to drink but maybe not one I would go searching for."
"Pours chestnut brown with red hues and lots of frothy tan head which dimishes rather quickly to a layer of bubbles. Lots of sweet malt and some nuts in the aroma. Taste is very nicely balanced with the sweet malts and the nutty flavours developing to a nice subtle hopped finish. Not too overboard on the nuts which is good considering some of the poorly balanced nut browns I've tried. The mouthfeel is a little overly carbonated for my palate - a little less in that regard (maybe bottle-conditioned?) could be an improvement. All in all a tasty pint, and a decent brown ale from Sam Smith."
"Pours a very dark copper color with a full tan rocky head that hangs around for a while. Smells of roasted coffee and faint hop aroma. Taste is much like the aroma - strong coffee flavors and hops predominate, with a nice, bitter and dry finish. It is not really that drinkable. Overall, it reminds me of a much smoother and lighter version of their Imperial Stout. Another winner from Sam Smith."
"I used to think this was THE nut brown ale. The past two bottles havent wowed me though. I mean, it is very good, but I still think theres plenty of room for improvement. Good representation of its style though."
"550 mL clear bottle with no freshness date."
"Simply satisifying. Pours reddish brown with a healthy head. It tastes as billed; the caramel malts are balanced with a subtle nut flavor. This one is the hoppiest of the Sammy Smith's, which isn't saying much. The balance is simply elegant. The hop finish is slight enough to add a refreshing crispness without detracting from the more prominent malt flavor. As solid as they come. Cheers."
"Verdict: Another excellent brew from Samuel Smith. Samuel Smith beers are widely available, so I can always count on this brewery whenever I need an interesting go-to brew."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is a kind of regular. No huge tastes that are good. Bland. I don't know, but I don't really enjoy it. Try Sam Smith's Oatmela Stout instead."
"Great pub beer."
"If I had the money, I would make this my number one session beer. What perfect English brown ale!"
"A clean brown colored beer with ruby highlights. Has a small beige head with some lace effect. The aroma has a malty sweetness and some carmel in the background. A good roasted malt flavor at the start. With some bitterness along the sides of the tongue and a smooth bitter and toffee sweet finish."
"This is a deep chestnut brown ale that has a hint of caramel and chocolate in its complexity. It's not as great as some small batch brown ales but is really top notch for a more largely produced one. The flavor is deep, the brew is well done and it is significantly better than a Newcastle."
"Pours a light tan, three finger head, fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Light-medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Deep, clear amber color. Nose is not distinguishable. Starts with a light mellow sweetness and finishes with a good balance of malts and hops. $2.32 for a 12oz bottle from Northend Superette Manchester, NH."
"Mmmm, this, for me, is the signature brown ale. Very quaffable."
"This beer looks, smells, and tastes great. Has the best head out of all the Sam Smith beers, and has some of the best aromas."
"On a side note... there's a flavor here I just couldn't figure out... and now after writing my review and reading a few others, another reviewer made me realize what it was... root beer! Not the major component of the flavor, but it's in there..."
"All in all my new favorite brown ale. Samuel Smith makes consistently good beers."
"This beer has a nice brown color with reddish hues. Only a small head that goes away very quickly. On the nose, I get some faint maltiness, maybe some nutty characteristics pretty much what I would expect to find in a Brown Ale. The taste is pretty good, I get the nuttiness, with some malt and a nice hoppy finish. The mouth feel is oily and bubbly. I could drink a few of these in a sitting."
"The smell is leafy and minty, kind of grassy too. The taste is nutty with a metallic aftertaste. I will try another when they cool more and possibly update this review. Not as good as other I have sampled from Smith."
"Smooth drinking, not too fizzy. Would make a good session beer, but a bit pricey to buy in quantity. Comes in a 550ml bottle, tasty and smooth drinking."
"Pours a clear dark brown with thick tan head, that never completely goes away and laces very well. Aroma of malt and some hops, nothing much else, but that's good. Taste was a great toffee malt with a buttery feel and nice hoppy finish, hints of chocolate and nuttiness as well. This would be great session beer if it were more readily available around here."
"This brew pours to a dark but clear brown color with a huge frothy tan colored head that breaks down very slowly and leaved incredible thick, clump lacing on the sides of the glass. It is a fine looking brew! The aromas are intoxicating, scents of malt, sweet toffee, caramel, with a nutty scent that goes perfectly together. This is a very nice, pure smelling brew! The taste is very nice, a heavy malty taste that leads to a sweeter sensation in the mouth (not overly, a very nice balance) along with a nutty taste and a modest hoppyness. Together with the flavors that this brew has it is a simply incredible tasting brew and one that is extremely well balanced. If you have not tried this brew, give it a whirl, I am sure you will not be disappointed!"
"This is a fine English Brown Ale. It pours from the bottle as a rather dark brown color. The head was some what disappointing in being both small and short lasting. The smell was certainly pleasing as was the taste, a pleasant malty sweetness with a nice nutty undertone. Definitely a beer to search out and enjoy."
"It poured a beautiful translucent black-brown and had a decent head that over topped my SS glass. The nose contained hints of caramel and roasted malts puncuated with nobel English hops. The taste was everything that the smell promised and more the only thing that detracted from this beer was a metallic taste the came through in the after taste. I guess the English water around Yorkshire has more than I am used to. Very delightful to drink and not heavy on the alcohol. These beers would make for a good night of drinking."
"Deep Red. Moderately aromatic, fruity and fresh, with a strong fragrance of hazelnut along with a hint of caramel and fruit. Taste begins with a note of browned red apple. Immediate mid-palate flavors of caramel take place followed by a long and satisfying finish with notes of hazelnut and vanilla. A wonderful tasting brew and a pinnacle for its style."
"1/2 liter clear bottle. poured a reddish chestnit brown with a rocky 2 finger cap that laces well. moderate carbonation. Hints of caramel and nuts in the aroma. Nice mix of malts sweet caramel, some roasted tones...hops tamed back (as should be) in this brown...finishes mild ...nothing unique here...this is the secons Sm smith's ale that disappointed in expectation....maybe a standard for the style but there are better domestic browns with better character..no need to go back here at the import price."
"Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale is an excellent beer, and it's a shame I hadn't tried this beer before. Truly an excellent brown ale, and one I wish wasn't sold only as a single. A wonderful session beer."
"Pours a burnt amber ruby color with a nice sized almond head that literally coats the glass. The aroma is of deep caramel and bready malts and floral english hops. The taste is a remarkable blend of toffeeish malts and floral herbal hops. Quite hoppy, especially in the finish. Theres a great crisp a fruity yeastyness, as well as a pleasan subtle diacytel flavor. The aftertaste is a lingering caramel, hop bitterness and fruity yeast flavor. The mouthfeel is full and creamy. This is one hell of a good brown ale. Its definitely my favorite example of the style. Anyone who likes English Ales should like this."
"Smells like roasted malt and caramel. Tastes the same. Nuts and malt up front, a more dry caramel malt in the back. Just sweet enough, but not very complicated. Good, smooth body, very light carbonation. Goes down smooth. I could drink this stuff all night--at 3.99 a pint, though, I think I'll switch to something else."
"Great presentation of a beer that automatically ups its appearance...nice 550 ml bottle wrapped in gold foil at the top (also, only $2.79 a the local grocery store). Pours with a ncie head and medium carbonation. A little too amber colored to remind me of a nut brown. Smells of strong hops and no nuttiness to speak of. A bit too bitter, almost tastes like an ESB. I've had this a few times and each time I've tried to be impressed but it's just not making the grade in comparison to other local nut browns."
"Pours dark reddish-brown with a small tan head that dissipates pretty quickly. Smells of toasted malts and sweet carmel. Taste is toasted malt, nutty, with a little carmel sweetness. Also some mildly fruity esters make a welcome appearance and just a little bitterness on the finish. Very tasty. Good session beer! I liked it a lot."
"Although this beer calls itself a nut brown I would call is more of a dark amber. Has an off white head sitting on top. Smell is of malt and esters but there is a sulfury note reminincent of wine and an unpleasant one at that. Taste is of roasty malt throughout. Hops are there for bitterness only. There is a slight fruity ester with a winey acidic twang but very mild. Moderately carbonated and thick syrupy body. As it is very mild on the palate it could make a great session beer."
"Overall, a good brown ale and definitely one worth trying. But the clear bottles have a tendency to leave some ""euroskunk"" from time to time, and until the brewery changes their ways, I can't give this any higher marks."
"Drinkability: The carbonation limits my appetite to drink more than one of these, but overall it is a very nice brew."
"Very complex but not very exciting."
"Pours a nice brown with tan head, lacing will mark the glass. The smell is of hazelnuts and cream, a hint of cinnamon lurks, caramel and chewy thickness reside in the glass. The taste is a dark chewy sweet with nut thickness, a hint of lightly toasted grain. Not bad, had better."
"Poures a rich reddish brown color with a a thin off-white head. I think that I got a skunked one as the aroma reminded me of a heineken, with a skunky, musky aroma. The taste was nothing like the aroma as it was full of light sweet malt in the front which segues to a dry, nutty lingering malt flavor.The dry finish of the malt flavors is accentuated by a low carbonation level and I believ that they use a bit of kettle sugars in the recipe. The hops are present but only as a balance to the initial malt sweetness. Dry in the finish yet sweet in the begining allows this beer to be very flavorful and very refreshing. Malt is the flavor that gets showcased in this brew yet it has a nice balance of flavors that gives it a complexity not normally found in malt oriented beers. An excellent session beer as well as a very good example of a brown ale as long as you can avoid a skunked one. Clear bottles are cheap and should only be used for cheap adjunct lagers."
"Taste starts with a ripe fruity flavor goes bitter for a second and ends with and incredibly smooth nutty flavor. I was truly sad when I took my last sip. Must buy more!!!"
"Not quite what I expected from a nut brown by Samuel Smith. It has a pleasant ruby brown color with a nice 1.5"" tan head. As for the smell, it was hard to tell since I had been using spray paint part of the day. It was not as rich or smooth as I am used to with other brown ales. It did go down quite well though. I think that I will re-visit this beer again soon to see if my senses were just off."
"This, once again, is a Samuel Smith jewel."
"Sienna hue with a slight ring on the crown with no lace to see. Smelled roasted nuts, perhaps toffee and a slight coffee charcter. A bitterness comes out at first bt is soon smoothed out with hints of caramel and coffee. Althoug average the mouth feel was pleasently smooth with a small slickness left afterwards."
"From a clear 12 oz. bottle pours a brownish/red clear liquid with a nice foamy off-white head. Smells are of slight toasted malt, along with butterscotch. Taste is a nice toasted hazelnut along with hints of toffee and butter. Medium body with good carbonation, give this an almost creamy feel. Overall, this is one great nut brown. A true classic and standard."
"Notes: Right now this isnt something I want to drink all the time, but I definitely want to try it again when Im a more experienced BA."
"Very tasty brown ale with some malty sweetness and a dry completion. A little bit of hop bitterness, but minimal in the overall profile of the beer."
"Poured into previously acquired Samuel Smith's Imperial pint glass. My new favorite beer word is ""garnet"" because it's kind of that clearish deep ruby red with tendencies towards brown. Or, at least, the way I've been describing it. This is how this one pours, with the ever so slight head. So much for that, but it's proper, and has a really really nice colour. The nose is this coffee caramel kind of like the way candy caramel smells but much more subtle. Moving onto taste, I kind of have to take issue because it tastes like... watered down coffee. In a good and bad way. It's kind of like a [gasp!] light porter! The roasty caramel flavour wraps itself around one's tongue, and the bitterness finishes off by sticking itself to the tongue. It has sort of port/sherry overtones. I know I've been saying this a bit lately, but it's kind of like, yeah, like port/sherry. As with all Smith beers, mouthfeel is wonderful, but the carbonation almost promises to fill one up prematurely. Drinkability? We don't need no stinkin' drinkability. Let's quaff this one all night as long as the ""4" lets us."
"A good ale, not enough hops for me though"
"The foamy head looks quite silky. The body has a nice dark amber-purple color, maybe mahogany. The smell shows a round dark maltiness; it reminds me of a good chewy toffee, the kind that stays in the mouth forever or at least on your teeth. Also a toasted nutty aroma, with hints of chestnut and maybe low diacetyl. The taste is nicely malty, but didn't show the same toffee aspect as the smell. I got more of a toasted impression, and then the round nutty-chestnutty aspect appeared, together with the thick hops and a certain dark chocolate bitterness. Mouthfeel is quite consistent, quite creamy and enjoyably carbonated; it is a nice balance of the ingredients, with a hop presence and thickness a bit more pronounced than I would have expected. A very enjoyable beer."
"Final Thought: Wow, just as stated above, a Newcastle++ one plus for the full taste the other plus because it's just that good!"
"This is a great beer, I hope I can try it on tap some day."
"Exciting stuff, and another classy as hell Sammy Smith."
"Three fingers of light tan, flat, dense, doughy head. Dark, deep, red-brown, clear body. Sweet toffee, bread dough and caramel in the nose. Caramel toffee in the front leads to a butterfest caramel malty middle. Finishes bitter with some fruit. Nice. Fun alcohol fruit burps. This is a great, malty, caramely, buttery ale. One of my favorite Samuel Smiths."
"Pours out dark brown with a huuuge, fluffy, tan head. To me, this is how a beer was meant to look. When I picture a beer, the image of a Samuel Smith Nut Brown Ale comes to mind. Simply gorgeous. The smell was extremely subtle. No real aromas stand out. The taste is a bit like caramel. Good balance between the hops and malt. Leaves the mouth slightly dry, but isn't really too bad. Can't drink too many of these. No real complaints about this beer, but maybe a touch overrated. Nonetheless, I would recommend it to just about anyone."
"Excellent deep cherry-brown color and creamy tan head, not as much carbonation as some of their other offerings. A nice nutty smell, smooth taste of roasted almonds and buttery toffee with a hint of brown sugar, topped with an even hop bitterness. Great mouthfeel with a chewy nutty aftertaste, leaves you wanting more. Very drinkable, quality beer, I haven't found a Samuel Smiths I don't like yet."
"I only got one 550ml bottle to try this out and I wish I had another because this is a very drinkable ale. This isn't my favorite style, but this particular brew is one to visit."
"This brew is great and I'm glad I grabbed it and gave it a shot; Brown Ales are back on the list of categories that I need to get into -- I know the English are masters of this style and there are some great US makers as well. Although the beer is complex and dark and extremely flavorful it doesn't bog down and seems quite drinkable. I could easily session through a number of pints of this... very nice indeed."
"Pouring from their 550 ml clear bottle, the ale looks delicious, and just as a nut brown style should. Rich reds and dark browns meld to create an amber brilliance which appears every bit as good as it tastes. Nice, dark-cream coloured head, which leaves a patchwork of lace clinging to the glass. Absolute perfect appearance. This is how a nut brown should look. I smell faint roasted flavours, almonds, sweet grassy, musky hops, caramel, chocolate, and some others I cannot identify readily. An aroma full of different nuances. The taste is a superb balance between some toasted malt sweetness and earthy hop bitterness. The malt is dominant, but the hops add exactly what they should to the taste. At first it is all caramel malt sweetness, on the middle more of the same, but the finish is where it all comes together; this is where you taste the full bready malt, and feel the bitter hops. Slight spices, chocolate caramel, banana, tangerine, and slight fruit-brandy flavours are what I detected. Peppery grainy feel in the mouth. It leaves the mouth with a dry but not unenjoyable sensation. Highly drinkable, since the style is likely to offend no one, and please every good ale drinker. Good carbonation and smooth creaminess favour it highly for drinkability."
"This beer basically epitomizes the style in my opinion. I could definitely handle more than one of these. There are other styles I appreciate more than this one, but this is my definite recommendation for someone who is a big fan of Brown Ales."
"This brew is surprisingly a brown colored brew, small tight brown bubbly head on top. The nose has some bitter hops and sweet malt notes. As for the taste we got smooth malt, bitter hop, some nutty tones, possibly slight roasted malt. This is probably the best brown ive have to date, but i cant say that ive become a major fan of the style. I think if youre into browns then this is a good one to try."
"this great beer poured reddish brown with a fluffy and creamy light brown head from a 550 ml clear bottle. Couldn't notice much smell. Very well balanced taste with a sweet malty flavor with a pronounced hop flavor from the beginning. Very drinkable while being hoppy enough for my taste and having a creamy texture. I really didn't expect this kind of hop character from a Sam Smith. I am impressed with this one."
"Poured a very smooth ruby/brown color with a small tan head. Smell is very malty with small hints of alcohol?? I wasn't expecting that out of this beer, pretty pleasant aroma. Taste is a truck load of malt but very well balanced. While there is a strong malt presence this beer is pretty subtle, could easily be a session beer as it's anything but palate fatiguing."
"May be the best beer I've ever had... tastes great. I could easily drink a few of these."
"Hate that damn gold foil on sam smith's beers. Usually a little flake falls into the glass. Anyway, pours out a nice brown color. Aroma consisted of nice toffee, butterscotch, and buttery tones. Taste was pretty much of what the aroma consisted of. The buttery tones mixed in with the toffee. Blends very well. Quite a decent brew, blows Newcastle's brown ale out the water."
"Creamy head, a light tan, leaves an equally creamy lace. Pours a mahogany shade. Smells of caramel, slightly nutty. Feels similar to other of their brews, a full, creamy feeling, with gentle carbonation. Tastes a bit on the sweet side, caramel or crystal malts the majority of the impact, with hops there, as an afterthought. Buttery aftertaste with a clean finish. A distinct offering of the style, but not outstanding enough for me to buy more than one at a time."
"Interesting as a change of pace."
"Drinkability: an interesting beer to try, but I'm not going to sit around drinking many of these"
"Bought a 4 pack of this. I've had it many times but decided to finally write a review. Poured a dark amber color with a dark tan head. It settled quickly and the smell came. Sweet malts in this one. Very good mouthfeel too. Drinkable but very sweet. You could take em down easy but would you want to? I like to savor this one."
"My new favorite nut brown, an excellent brew!"
"Taste is malty with light sweet nut flavors. The flavors play a nice slow exit ... they linger for abit and then slowly fade away. So fine."
"Taste is slightly bitter and malty up front. Caramel and sweet malt. Some metallic flavors. Quite bitter, more bitterness than I was expecting but not a lingering bitter aftertaste. Pretty complex yet smooth. Very drinkable and tasty."
"Very drinkable, mild yet not bland."
"Bottle - Poured a clear brown colored beer with a medium head that has very little retention. Smells of hops is clearly present with a very subtle touch of nut sweetness. Taste is very ''creamy'' with again a sweet touch of hazelnut. Medium body with standard carbonation. Overall, this is a good beer but I would have enjoyed it more if the hazelnut taste had been more accentuated."
"Poured it into the glass to discover a not-so-brown appearance. I was thinking to myself, where is the brown in my nut brown? Other than this strange scene, the rest of the experience was great. It smelled wonderful - a full nose of matly and bitter, but not over bearing...subtle really. but i like subtle. Taste was a great combination of bitter and malt...very full bodied and rich. I could easily lose myself in a case of these."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, a creamy light beige head forms on top of a clear mahogany liquid. The head was short-lived, and there was little lacing during the drinking experience. Minimal aroma, maybe the slightest of hops essence, but the taste is a good match of malt and bitterness. The flavors kind of swirl around the tongue duelling for superiority, and the bout ending a pleasing draw. Not surprisingly, another worthy ale from Sam Smith..."
"This is a very drinkable brew and I think it would be a very nice match for the main course of Thanksgiving dinner."
"A good beer with food, its astringency or is it bitterness works to add to roast beef and patatoes meal. Haven't done a sample but I bet UK reviewers rank this higher. Canadians can try a couple of more balanced lighter versions of this type such as Wellington's. Brown colour looks like matter is there and suds on top look like dish soap. Also strong carbonation begs for food relief."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thin off-white head. The aroma is good. It is malty and full of roasted and victory malts. The taste is also good. It is malty, but a bit watery. It finishes dry, but good down smooth. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. It is an excellent nut brown ale. It is refreshing and not at all bitter like most English ales I try."
"This is one of the first beers I really loved. It will always be a point of comparison for other brown ales, especially nut browns. I've never tasted another beer that has replicated the flavor."
"Deep chestnut brown color with thick brown head that lingered for a long time and left clingy lace. Mouthfeel was very good with velvety texture and above average body thickness. The taste was dominated by rich malts with hints of coffee and caramel thrown in for good measure. PAs it warms up, more of the much anticipated dry nutty favor comes in. True to the styly, this beer has a very light helping of hops, so the smell was a bit unremarkable with a sour yeasty note. The best that I've had from this brewery so far."
"Deep brown color, with a tan head. Smells of coffee and malt, which matches it's taste. A very deep flavor that changes as it warms. Just a little hint of alcohol present. This is a very good beer, a benchmark to which all other Brown Ales should be measured."
"This beer is similar in some respects to Newcastle Brown, but it is much more flavorful, and perhaps even smoother. Only on very rare occasion has Samuel Smith's let me down, and this brew does nothing to disparage me from their beers. Another respectable beer from the Old Tadcaster brewery."
"Note this beer gets better as it airs out. A pretty good English brew."
"$2.99 for the biggin."
"Comments  I felt the key to this ale was its balance. I enjoy the one-sided extreme beers as well, but this one was right on the mark. By far the best Brown Ale that Ive tried to date."
"A solid and dependable nutty brown ale. Classy beer."
"Not a session brew IMHO."
"Poured a deep reddish gold with a medium thick dark tan head that dissipated slowly to a thin, very bubbly layer. The nutty malts are immediately apparent in the aroma, nicely balanced by a floral hoppiness. In taste, however, the ale was a bit dull; the malts were evident, but it seemed to lack the balance promised by the smell, and the taste faded too quickly, leaving nothing really to savor. The mouthfeel was, as anticipated by the visible and active bubbles, effervescent. I wish it had more body."
"Medium brown in color with large head that dissipated to a thin tannish layer.Smell was wonderful full of malt but it also left with the head, strange. Taste wonderful malt with light nut taste and a pinch of hops to finish it off. Nice well rounded medium mouthfeel extremely drinkable finished the beer before the review. Do these guys make a bad beer? Only thing missing is a brown bottle."
"Garnet in color with a slight head that disappears almost immediately. Hazelnut aroma with some caramel. Taste is nutty and malty, maybe a little chocolatey as well. A good beer from a solid brewery. No complaints here, just nothing that blew me away though."
"Out of the 18.7 oz. Victorian pint bottle. Translucent coppery-brown color with a thick tan head. Mixed aromas of toasted malt, English noble hops and a delicate nuttiness. An earthy, almost bark-like aroma in there as well. Roasty malt flavors again balanced with a delicate nuttiness. Slightest diacetyl butteriness interlaced with the malt. I could venture a couple guesses as to which nut(s) the brewers use, but I suppose that isn't really important. Definitely smooth and balanced. Drinkability fairly high. A quality brown ale. Classic example of the Nut Brown style."
"Nose is almost sweet, very enticing with malts and definitely some walnuts. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and there's plenty of carbonation here. Taste is not overwhelming, but it's a nice balance of roasted nuts and hops. Crisp and clean finish with a touch of hops. Nowhere close to the richness and creaminess of the Sam Smith oatmeal stout I fell in love with yesterday, and seems light for an English brown ale. Alcohol seems absent for a 5%abv, but makes for excellent drinkability."
"Drinkability - great taste, reasonable abv, and all around just a very easy beer to enjoy."
"This is the best brown ale I've had and should be what other browns aspire to be! This great brew poured a nice dark brown color with a supprisingly big head that lasted about 2 min before turing into a nice lace around the whole glass. The smell was of grain and burnt nuts, very nice. The taste was out of this world, with a great mix of nut, hop, malt and toffee/carmel flavor. This is a great beer to kick back and enjoy, and one could eaisly make a session out of it. Good stuff!"
"Drinkability: Extremely drinkable. Well balanced, flavorful, and always consistant. This is a mainstay. A rock, a shelter to always seek refuge in. Another excellent brew from a brewery that does it the way they always have."
"Enjoyable, much better than a lot of the stuff out there."
"Good brew, but I'm not ready to rate it as high as everyone else.Amber brown color, foam exploded out of the bottle, malty aroma with a fruit tinge. Intial taste slightly sweet then quickly went dry.Nice lace on glass. I didn't get the nut part.Good but a little pricey to buy for what you get."
"something was missing here...and i do believe it was a distinct nutty flavour that i remeber this brew once having. it poured a nice amber colour but was lacking in much of a smell other than hints of nut and malt. the taste stepped it up a bit, but there was much less here than i once remember, but it did retain that yummy 'samuel smith' taste that i find in all of their brews. can't pinpoint what it is, but it's always there and instantly noticeable. goes down very smooth and is a definite session beer. still good, but not as good as it once was."
"pours a clear dark amber with a light tan head that quickly recedes. The nose is of malt, nut, and slight alcohol. Upon first taste there is sweet malt, changing into an slightly unpleasant acidic hoppiness that lingers until the finish. Honestly, not impressive in my opinion. Bold, but wanting. Could use more malt, and the balance is a bit off. Mouthfeel is chewy and lightly bubbly, very suiting for the style. Drinkable in most occasions, but not particularly pleasurable."
"Hits the glass offering a fluffy medium-tan head that recedes over lightish clear brown liquid, gently carbonated. The nose is sweet maltiness with a slight diacetyl noted. Taste is at first sweet and indeed nutty/chewy. Then the taste dries out somewhat, allowing for a brief shot of hop bitters to show up. Finishes with a sweet and nutty flourish. Easy to ""put away"" quite a few of these!"
"Poured a reddish brown color with a thick bubbly head. The aroma was somewhat lacking as hints of malts were present. The flavor was of a nice malt, nut, and slight hop balance. There was a sharp bite on the tongue which gave a crisp sensation. The malt lasts quite a bit on the tongue. Very drinkable and quite enjoyable."
"It smells nutty, sorry not an expert in nuts, and hoppy, can't pick them out either. I know, I suck. The smell is just right, not too overpowering, just enought to make your mouth water. Love the taste, the hops really balance out the nuttyness. What really makes this beer good is that when you lift the beer up to your mouth, you get this rich nutty aroma, and then when you drink it, you get the slightly sweet and hoppy taste of the ale. It's this combination that makes this one so enjoyable."
"Flavor: The taste is nutty, malty with a clean finish. The body is light, but the flavor is full. This is a very good beer."
"The mouthfeel is somewhat acidic at first. It becomes smooth and a touch watery. It is an easy drinker. It could be a session beer for the brown lover. I would not turn one of these down. I would just look for a different brand first."
"Probably one of the best brown ales available. It's fairly easy to find, although a bit pricey, but well worth it."
" My review feels like I am understating the virtues of this beer, and I am. Not overly complex, but lets leave that to other beers. When I want a nut brown, this is the standard bearer. Really, the Nut Brown all others desire to be...Exceptional.."
" I got a clear bottle and It wasn't skunked!!"
"Medium brown color. Medium white frothy head. Aroma is malty and nutty. A medium bodied brown ale. Malts are nutty and slightly sweet. Hops are evident but mild. This is a fairly typical example of English brown ale. Everything is sort of mild and middle of the road. Not that there's anything wrong with that. A decent very drinkable beer. Milder flavor, smooth taste. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"At first pour, the beer comes out a deep brown with a tanish head which lasts but not overly long. As far as the taste went, roasted malts, with a little, very little amount of hops. One thing i did notice however was there was an almost chemical like taste, not overpowering by anymeans, but it was there so i took some off of taste for that. All in all however a good brew which I will buy again."
"I could definitely have more of these. Keep em' comin' and if the clear bottle skunked the flavor I am in for a treat when it comes to the unskunked version."
"Appearance: Pours with a an attractive deep ruby brown and forms a massive tan creamy head in my imperial pint glass, speckled lacing forms as the head dwindles. Aroma a nutty soothing tone under slightly caramel malt sweetness very nice and mildly robust in the aroma department, where this beer shines though is the taste. Taste: Smooth slightly sharp sweetness partially dry but overall awesome nut tones in the background what an awesome beer this is by far the staple for the style. Mouthfeel: Perfect amount of body easy flowing carbonation great beer. Drinkability is effortless only wish there was another bottle sitting in the fridge, what a wonderful English nut brown to be tried by everyone this is the type of beer that turns people on to craft beers and remains part of the beer diet for eternity."
"What a beautiful color-deep,deep brown with a lovely red glow around the edges. Aromatics include milk chocolate, sweet toffee and a touch of butterscotch. The mouthfeel is heavenly and includes a nice buttery viscosity. Flavors are complex and hint of sweet butter cream, some light maple undertones and a bittersweet hop component. I can't help but finding maple cream chocolates on the tail end? This is a nicely done brew that has gone well with many a fish and chip dinner!"
"like i said a good beer, but i wouldn't say it is the best Brown Ale out there or Sammy SMith's best brew, but certinly worth trying, perhaps with a grreat big juicy steak."
"12oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep brown color with two fingers of head. There is a good bit of lace rings left on the glass. The smell is very nutty and malty. A fairly sweet smell. The taste is also a sweet malty flavor, with hazelnut and caramel present. Not too much hops present, but good nonetheless. It has a nice heavy and smooth mouthfee. It also has a good drinkability. The one nut brown on which all others are based."
"In the mouth it feels fresh, tart, and medium-light with a smooth dry finish. It's good, but I find it more appley than nutty. Hm. I would never describe this as a nutty ale. Weird, and kind of disappointing."
"dark copper and brown color under a simply gorgeous half-inch head that is creamy light brown. great lace inside the glass. the scent is nutty and malty, not very much hoppiness in the smell and a bit of sweetness is detected. the flavor is rich and nutty with a bitter bite. it has presence of walnut, brazil nut and almond (among other nuts i'm certain but these i could pick out clearly) a host of herbal tones but not at all over pronounced. a dry maltiness really bitters on the finish and the hop profile isn't at all strong, it's more of a thought than an expression, just a little help to dry it up in the end. mouthfeel is creamy but crisp in the finish. the only problems i could have with these are wateriness (perhaps) and some strange chemical flavor that seems a bit metallic toward the final development. a great beer as far as i'm concerned though, i'm just groping for flaws i guess, sometimes i do that to those who are supposed to be real good. to hell with that though, i'll drink these again and again when the mood strikes me! have one."
"Pours a medium brown color with red highlights and a frothy head. Smell is of sweet malts and hazelnuts. Taste is exactly what the smell makes it out to be. The only other real noticeable flavor is the yeasty dryness that comes forth in the finish. This is a solid beer but not spectacular by any means."
"Clear 550 ml bottle with gold foil wrapped around the cap and neck. A thick creamy off-white head sits atop a dark brown body with reddish hues. Aroma consists of dark fruit (fig?), caramel malt and molasses. Mouthfeel seems thin for a brown. Hard water taste can be detected. Caramel malt dominate the body with a light hop bitterness. Mineral water flavor is a turn-off for me. Seems to lack some of the sweetness of other brown ales I've sampled in the past."
"Pours a medium brown with a medium sticky head,the aroma is of course nutty and malty sweet.The taste is pretty rich for the appearance pretty nutty and earthy with a sweet malt backbone.Somewhat with a lighter looking brown ale with such a rich taste to it.Not a bad brew but maybe a little overated."
"maybe the greatest session beer ever in my book. definitely a great great ale. super complex malt taste. beautiful nutty aftertaste that is scrumptious. goes great with food. great on a hot day. great on a cold day. just an amazing all-around beer. what's left to say. my favorite sam smith beer."
"an exceptionally drinkable Nut Brown..wonderful stuff..how do the English put so much flavour into such medium strength beers?"
"I don't drink browns or nut browns too often, but what a way to start! This one may be tough to beat. Pours a cola-brown with a light tan head. Subtle malt and nut smells detectable. The taste is sweet, nutty-chocolatey with hints of cherries (?) on the palate. The finish is roasty, woody, and bitter. Mmmm... The mouthfeel is surprisingly big. I would love to try this on tap. Another great Samuel Smith concoction."
"It's sad that the bottle was skunked as it was, but amazingly a lot of the flavor still fights it way through and make this a damn good beer."
"When this beer was poured into my glass, it had a tan head with medium sized bubbles. The body was clear and the hue of this beer is dark brown. A good brew with a good smooth taste which is much to my liking. I have found another brew that I could drink all night at a bar or party."
"Notes: I'm always disappointed by this brew. I love nut-browns -- hence my willingness to give this puppy shot after shot. I attribute these bad experiences to skunkage. Darken your friggin' bottles, Sam Smith. Mustard is irritated."
"This is a beer I keep coming back to. It is well balanced and is consistently very drinkable. It has a great texture that gets creamier as it warms, yet remains quite lively. In fact, it seems to change character dramatically with the temperature (more of a bite when it was cold than when it warmed). The color is a reddish brown. The head was a little disappointing and petered out about midway."
"Nice malty aroma. Its initial pour yielded a nice light brown head full of medium bubbles with a dark brown transparent body. Initial taste was full of flavor and went down very smoothly while leaving the remains of a subtle after bite. All in all, it is a very nice first brew to sample this evening."
"Overall, a well put-together beer I could enjoy these on a daily basis. Very tasty!"
"A solid and dependable beer, this is a classic example of the Northern England-style brown ale."
"I found it highly carbonated, but quite refreshing. Not a ton of flavor, but it's mostly in the finish; nutty taste, pine, caramel. Very subtle flavoring. The body was quite thin, but I would say fairly typical of this style - similar to a Newcastle. Drinkability is way up there, though! I could see myself downing this all night if not for it's price. A very fine example of the brown ale style!"
"Clear brown with good head that leaves decent lace. Some light skunkiness in aroma that carries over into the flavor, but not enough to be a real drawback. Also some great British mustiness in the aroma from the yeast (for me it is a highlight of any good UK beer). This is a mellow beer with quite a bit of flavor but you have to dig for it, it doesn't hit you over the head. Caramel flavors are sugary, strong, buttery, complex, severely tempered by minerals from water and dominant musty yeast. Some tartness towards the very end but this is more of a sour quality than any hop bitterness. Quite fizzy on the mouth and this doesn't feel right for a British ale to me. Mellows a bit in the glass and becomes creamier. If this was all there was to drink in the world, I could certainly manage, but it doesn't quite jibe with my personal tastes."
"The color of this beer is a light scarlet red. A thin and whispy beige head caps the beer off. The nose is herbal, earthy, sticky sweet and a little skunky. The flavor is pretty heavy on the English Toasted Malt tones. Bitterness is a little too sharp. And there's the slightest hint of an acrid off flavor. There's also some carmelized sugar and light nut tones. All in all, this is pretty bland, especially when compared to the beauty I just had (the New Glarus Fat Squirrel Nut Brown). The mouthfeel of this beer is too carbonated and thus it hinders drinkability some."
"Why they insist on bottling this one in a clear bottle is beyond my imagination. Looks nice poured, brown/amber color with a decent frothy head. Aroma is overpowering skunk with a hint of more skunk. Flavor is malty and skunky. Thin on the palate with a watery feeling. I'm sure this was good before they ruined it putting it in a clear bottle but I have to give it an honest review. A dissapointment for me and hopefully one day I'll have the opportunity to re-rate a better sample."
"A very smooth brown ale, one of my favorites of the style, Samuel Smith does not disappoint."
"A nice colored beer. Lightish-brown, lots of reds. The head is fantastic, though. Choppy and offwhite, it settles even more unevenly and leaves beautiful lacing. Not at all an overpowering aroma, but it is very good. Rich and cherry-ish. Heavy taste, a little smoky and a little (tiny) bit sweet. Complex. Godd mouthfeel, but a little bit of a mettalic aftertaste. The other flavors (coffee, chocolate) make up for this. Wonderful brew."
"To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed with the nut brown ale. To me, it tastes too similar a dry-hopped Winter Welcome. The head retention is great - clears to a ring that sticks with the brownish red beer all the way down. Aroma is nutty with a nose of hops. The taste is very smooth, tingling the tongue with bubbles all along the leading edge. I'm beginning to wonder if my bottles of Samuel Smith that I picked up tonight are a bit skunked. This is my second type of Samuel Smith tonight, and they are just too similar for it to be coincidence. Come on, I'd be willing to pay extra for the beer if it didn't come in a clear bottle!"
"This is a great beer to drink on a cold winter day. Pours a dark brown color with a thin off-white head that fades away quickly, leaving a thin lace. The aroma is extremely nutty with lightly toasted malts and subtle fruit undertones. The taste, like the aroma, is very nutty with some sweet caramel undertones. This is beer has a lot of character. Its a very smooth and easy drinking brew."
"commitment to quality and drinkability. It is hard to not salivate when a fresh shipment comes into the Liquor store,"
"Poured a deep amber/brown color(iced tea color) with a thick head that slowly goes down to half its original size. Aroma was not strong at all but there were hints of mixed nuts and roasted malts. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy easily drinkable. Tastes of mixed nuts especially walnut, some malt and little after taste. Very good beer."
"Slender, 355ML clear bottle, foiled cap. Looks like tea in a bottle, looks are deceiving! Pours a deep amber with a rapidly disappearing head, tons of lace left in the bottle. Beautiful roasted, nutty aroma. Smooth roasted malt, a light hazelnut, slight coffee taste. Very smooth and balanced, a rich caramel aftertaste. Tasty, delicious, this is an awesome brew!"
"I liked it, just not as much as the stouts I usually drink."
"It's always a little scarey to sample from a clear glass bottle. This one seems to have turned out okay. Nice somewhat complex aroma of sweet caramel that moves to a mild roast quality. Nice appearance although the head after pouring medium had very little retention. Dark golden to red and brown. Clear. Really pleasant taste with remarkable smoothness. Nutty, roasty (but not too strong) with caramel qualities too. A little rich, but not sweet. Terrific blending of flavors. Just enough dryness in the finish with nice lingering. The feel is quite expcetional with good carbonation balance. Best example of style that I've had so far. A good nearly anytime beer."
"Dark brown color, with light getting through around the edges of the clear bottle, and a thick, sizzling tan head. Aroma is nutty, herbal, with a notes of caramel, butterscotch, and almonds, and the lush feel of the deep woods. On the palate: sweet and buttery, with a mellow and medium body. Small hop presence here, more a malt emphasis, and a great balance between. Sweet enough to please the folks, but with a solid enough body not to disappoint the serious ale lover. Quite unlike the ever-present, flimsy and bland Newcastle. Very pleasing, and rewarding."
"Sammy Smith's has never disappointed me. This brown ale is simply a beautiful experience to drink. It's a medium bodied brown with a creamy tan head. The taste if of hazelnuts, toffee, and toastiness, with a creamy sweet mouthfeel; just very easy to enjoy and drink. There are no bothersome qualities at all. This is my session brew of choice when I have the money to afford it."
"Pours a dark brownish ruby color with a creamy tan colored head that dissipates into a nice sticky lace. Nose is butterscotch and lightly roasted chestnutsvery nice. Sweet malts come through up front in the taste with a touch of caramel followed by a nice creamy and buttery nuttiness. Medium creamy mouth feel with a nutty finish and walnut-like aftertaste. This is one of the finest brown ales in the world."

"I'll admit to this point that the Samuel Smith phenomenon has been a bit of a mystery to me. Drinking this one, however, led me closer to the appreciation expressed by so many others. It's a really beautiful brown with just a slight hint of red and a pretty tan head. It does have that wonderful nutty smell, but has other things going on too. A hint of toasty aroma and taste is noticeable. The mouthfeel is wonderfully alive. I could drink this stuff all day."
"To quote Father Jack: ""Drink!!"""
"A most excellent choice."
"Ruby-brown in color with a creamy, light brown head. Fruity hop aromas and nutty malt aromas are most noticeable. It has a buttery malt texture and a nutty malt flavor with coffee notes. It fades to a balanced bitterness. It is medium-bodied, smooth with a creamy texture, not overly carbonated. Overall, it is an easy drinking, smooth ale. Delicious nutty flavors that are perfectly balanced by the hop bitterness. Another great beer from Samuel Smith."
"One of the best English Nut Browns I have ever had."
"This beer was a pleasure to drink. In the glass the color was rich, deep, and clear. Initial notes of toffee gave way to a full but not overpowering bitterness. This was followed by a most pleasant sweetness that lingers on the palate. This is a beer that tastes better and better as the glass empties. An excellent choice for a nut brown ale."
"The first brown ale I ever tried. I was pretty impressed. Nice dark brown color with a creamy head that lasted for some time. Very full mouthfeel and smooth on the way down. The label shines through with a nutty smell and taste. A malty aftertaste which left me wanting more. I like to get this beer during cold weather .I bet it would be even better fresh from the tap. Its not a best seller at local stores so its hard to get it very fresh."
"cheers!"
"Clear medium brown, 1/2 inch pillowy head. Sweetish aroma, some nutiness and a little carmelized sugar. Medium body, low carbonation and an upfront malty sweetness. Looked hard for a flavor impression and mostly came up with a sense of sweet vanilla and a sense of hazelnut. Hops are nicely spread across the late taste and finish, nice balance. Malt lacks a lot of distinction, so this beer is not a huge favorite, though its quite well done."
"Something of a skunky aroma on first opening the bottle. Disappears after the beer sits for a while but leaves you with a scent that is a bit thin, overall. Appearance is nice, dark brown/reddish with a thin, creamy off-white head. The flavor is malty sweet, with a muted nuttyness and a pleasantly balanced finish. Medium-light body. Decent beer, but not one of my favorite Browns."
"Musty swet roast malt smell.  Dark red color with an airy brown head.  Light malt notes on the front of the tongue followed by a slightly bitter sweetness on the back of the tongue.  There is a clean finish to the brew but not a ton of complexity to the taste.  The mouth is also needs some body.  This brew did not impress me very much.  I expected more layers of nutty flavor.  I would very much like to try this on tap and compare."
"Clear deep brown on the pour, the head magnificent, and the lace in thick glutinous sheets that are long lasting, both a nice light chocolate brown in color. Nut like tones, malt, caramel, clean and fresh. Front is malt sweet, the top is moderate in mouth feel, the finish is pleasingly acidic, modestly hopped, the aftertaste droughty. A decent brew all around as far as I'm concerned, but not one I try very often?"
"Note: Don't try and drink this beer cold! Slightly cool, maybe. Even better when it gets to 75 F."
"Very smooth and palatable...anyone could probably drink many, but I don't find it something which is very tasty or complex. Good by many beer standards, but somewhat disappointing for the Old Brewery Tadcaster."
"Deep brownish-amber hue, translucent, off-white (tan) head, superior retention with a healthy amount of lace. Nutty, malty nose with a light buttery backdrop inviting. Excellent nutty-malt flavor, hint of raisin on the palate, semi-sweet in the middle, tasty hop bite for a crisp, yet nutty, finish bitter undertone to create balance. Samuel Smiths Nut Brown Ale is incredibly easy to drink. Its a tasty session beer that Id drink it again. Recommend? For sure!"
"Reddish-brown appearance rather like clay soil with a fine, compact head that dissipates rather quickly, leaving minimal lace.  Smell is pleasant and smooth with no particularly remarkable notes beyond an inviting whiff of hops.  Taste is wonderfully smooth--rather creamy-sweet at first and with a dryness at the end that lingers for a surprisingly long time.  The smooth taste also means a smooth mouthfeel, though it lingers a bit longer than I would prefer.  Nevertheless, this is a niceably drinkable beer--the best brown ale I've had thus far."
"Nice clear caramel brown color with a heavy malty aroma and very light loose foam. A taste of malts with a medium to light bitterness. This beer didn't not have the taste or intensity as the aroma. Color and aroma were the highlight's of this brew and the rest was average. Another white bottled beer. Could that be it?"
"Again with the clear bottle and slight skunking! I am really disappointed that their stouts can be so good but their Pale, Nut Brown, and Winter Welcome can suffer so much from the clear bottles. Granted, this one was not skunked as badly but it still detracted from my enjoyment of this beer. There were some nice nutty tones in the aroma as well, but they were masked by the skunk smell, same with the flavor. Decent hazelnut flavor imparted with malt, but again, change the bottles!"
"Walnut color accompanied by a nutty aroma and hazelnut taste. Great tandem work by the malt and hops. Really clean tasting and engaging to the palate. A crisp finish. Makes you think of England, Wood furniture, autumn evenings, Old World charm. This one is best enjoyed with a few friends and a good glass. Samuel Smith does a great job with this one!"
"Deep copper color with a frothy head. Nutty and floral aroma. Excellent creamy mouthfeel. Sweet taste with some hops to balance it out, also had a nutty flavor. Interesting beer and very smooth."
"Nice appearance. Russet brown in color with excellent clarity and a full, but not very dense, tan colored head. The head holds well and leaves some very good lace. Light bodied but somewhat creamy. The aroma is of sweet caramel malt with a lightly mineral character and just a touch of diacetyl. The flavor is as the aroma suggests, with a fairly dry, softly biscuity malt with some light caramel undertones and only a very slight touch of hops. There's no chocolate or toasted malt character present. A firm bitterness balances and it finishes quickly, dry with some residual earthy hops. A very memorable beer that keeps you coming back for more."
"This beer poured with a very thick head.  It had a slightly roasty aroma and flavor, which did not last long.  This nut brown was not as good as the Pony Express, and on par with a Newcastle.  Just not ""nutty"" enough for a nut brown in my mind."
"smooth dark and delicious. somewhat creamy and nutty with a smooth maltiness that just slips right down your throat. a bit smoother out of the larger bottles, this one is worth having."
"Big clear bottle..deep amber to brown clear color with a big fluffy tan head that kept. Smell intially was very harsh, bitter, and skunky. Smell improved as it warmed. Nice malt, nutty sweet taste with a surprisingly crisp dry finish.Roasted bitterness and hazlenut tastes linger.  Medium bodied, full flavored, not overly syrupy like other nut browns. I think I may have got an older bottle, that made it smell bad. Didn't notice any freshness dates. Overall, very good, and worth a try."
"This beer poured a nice dark amber color.  Formed a large, nice white head that formed some nice lace when it subsided.  Slight aroma of malt and nut.  The taste has elements of butterscotch and chocolate.  A little bitterness, but nothing that impacts the finish.  A good beer."
"Had this from a bottle at a nearby restaurant.  The beer pours with fairly large white head.  Aroma is of roasted malts...with surprisingly little hop presence.  Taste is subtle and malty, with a bittering hops finish.  Solid, well-made, and enjoyable.  Not, however, the best beer from this brewery."
"Dark amber colour. Big frothy head full of nooks and crannies. Alcohol, yeast, hops, and some dark fruits in the nose. Some-thing there that my mind associates with British.  Creamy taste. Wonderful malt presence. Years ago, when craft beer was new, my cousin recommended this to me, saying it was the best beer he had ever had. It may have been surpassed for both of us in the best ever description, but I had forgotten just how good it is. A marvelous beer from one of England's great breweries."
"Great beer from a quality English brewery.  Nutty brown in color, with a nice head.  Sweet and fuity up from taste with a nice finish.  A little bitter aftertaste sometimes. As with most ales, this tasts best a little warmer than you would drink a lager."
"Here's some brilliant eye-candy for ya.  The name accurately describes the color.  It is a nice dark-tea color with excellent clarity.  It pours a nice had that dissipates fairly quickly yet it still leaves a lace down the glass.  The taste is fairly mellow and slightly dry.  Very smooth with a hop bitterness that is balanced nicely.  While a good beer, I'm still a young amateur advocate, I will have to try many many others before I have a repeat of this good brew."
"I was very reserved about trying this tonight. I just recall having a bad experience with it a year or so ago. Must've been something else. Nice medium brown, has hints of hay/wood on the nose. Small tan head (bad pour?). Roasted malts, smooth finish. I look forward to re-trying the rest of the Smith's lineup."
"Very calm, almost flat carbonation.  Penetrating alchohal and butterscotch aromas.  Semi-sweet start, finishes with a powerful persimmon astringency.  I enjoy browns, but I found this to be a let down.  Always happens when we have high expectations."
"Light brown color w/ a definite chill haze. The head retention is poor.  Light nutty and toasted malt notes in aroma w/ a mild yeast ester fruitiness.  The mellow hop nose is mildly earthy and pleasant.  The taste is sweet initially, but is followed by slightly toasted notes from the conservative use of chocolate malt.  Carbonation is quite low, providing for a smooth mouthfeel.  Definite signature Sam Smith diacetyl from the yeast strain is perceptible, but it's in the background and complements the overall malt profile. Hop character is very mild, and allows the toasty malt flavors to be clearly distinguished from hop bitterness.  Finishes slightly sweet.  I got an unskunked bottle!  Although not a complex beer, the light body, nutty malt flavors and overall balance make for quite a drinkable brew."
"There was a nice head on this one. It was foamy, stiff-looking with big bubbles. It also hung around for a while. The beer was a dark red brown and very clear. There were flowery hops and some roasty maltiness on the nose. The taste was good - roasty and bitter - but not exceptional. Mouthfeel was a little thin. Good drinkability, though."
"This beer is excellent, it ranks up at the top of my list now.  I love the color of the beer, and the head is just icing on the cake.  A match made in heaven if you will.   Very drinkable brown ale."
"Presentation: Packaged in a Victorian-era style custom bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
"deep amber in color, cream color head that dies down to a thin lace.  nutty, malty aroma without much hops to speak of.  has a medium body which shows off some caramel malt character....nutty undertones and an almost sweet buttery mouthfeel make this seem so silky smooth.  some very soft hops break up the smoothness a little bit in the end, like frosting on a cake.  this is what americans browns should strive to be like.  almost like candy in a bottle. delicious!"
"Red to brown in color sweet and nutty flavor. Overall a really good brown ale. I don't think it's worth the price tag of a case though. By me it's almost $60"
"Deep red to brown beer with slightly off white thin wispy head, no retention. Smells like burnt caramel and slightly astringent. Light thinly astringent taste up front, followed by a strong rich caramel and toasty flavor. Bitterness is bold and clean with no percieved hop aroma. Thin clean finish and mouthfeel. Very quaffable brown ale, with more character than many other brown ales."
"Notes: Truly one of the best brown ales in the world ... this is the cast and mold for lots of brewers trying to come up with a nut-brown ale. The lasting nutty finish leaves a pleasing hazelnut or walnut aftertaste."
"Nice ruby brown color.  Good carbonation. Malty, complex, nutty aroma.  Sweet, malty, nutty, roasted flavor.  A tad thin on mouthfeel.  Very clean, smooth with a slightly dry finish.  Lingering nutty aftertaste."
"A little less sweet and more dry than most other browns I've run across."
