3.87,7.2,3.5,3.25,4.25,3.75,4,"Pours a deep brown with garnet red accents. 2 fingers of cream colored foam settled with no lacing in to a thin layer and attractive collar. There's a little bit of nutty aroma with some faint smoky accents. Some toasted bread. Not a lot happening in the nose. The taste brings some sweet toffee malts with a little buttery diacetyl. Traces of pecan nuttiness and a little bit of mineral water flourish in the flavor. Scant bitterness with a slightly drying finish and touch of roast. The flavors are all pretty subtle, but artfully constructed. The mouthfeel is medium-full with mild carbonation. This entire beer exhibits great balance. With the moderate ABV and pleasant yet gentle flavors, this would make a spectacular session beer. I am typically not a fan of the brown ales that I've sampled from throughout the United States, but this one got my attention. Simple, tasty and uncontroversial. Many American browns have gone too far with the hops, and in my humble opinion, it takes away from what makes them delicious. It's good to see another East Coast brewery that puts the Carolinas on the map.","JohnnyI","Dec 31, 2014"

Flavor is fairly sweet and underattenuated, with toasted, nutty malt dominating, finishing sugary sweet, but then countered by hop bitterness, which borders on piney. There are light chocolatey notes that make me think this would go very well with a peanut butter sandwich.","barczar","Sep 26, 2014"

Aromas of roasted nut sweetness, woody characteristics, and some light, sweet cream highlights. The nose is subtle, and it takes some getting in there deep to pick up characteristics. Flavors are very sweet forward, with an overall roasted character giving way to a blend of nut, chocolate, and subtle toffee notes. Very sweet characteristics, but remains light and drinkable. Roast characteristics build towards the end of the palate into the aftertaste, and are joined by a subtle, mild bitterness. The body is light, and slightly effervesced by the carbonation. The finish has a sweet linger, with a subtle bitterness that provides a clean and dry finale. Very easy to drink.","GarthDanielson","Oct 01, 2013"

The head is a modest off-white cover with respectable lacing. The aroma brings pretty standard roasted malt with a touch of burnt wood ash. Mild but pleasant enough. The first mouthful delivers a somewhat diluted brown bread, malt-charcoal medley. Well blended but kind of watery without being unlikeable. There is a bit of tart swampy hop going on here, sort of cider like maybe, but the roasted malt charcoal lead the way on flavor. As I get used to this I pick up some honey sweetness and leafy edges. This brown ale is medium-light bodied with subtle, tingly carbonation and somewhat aqueous feel. Not bad at all, a little weak for my tastes but drinkable and worth a try.","Durge","Nov 16, 2012"

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, and powdered chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, powdered chocolate, dark chocolate, and nutty. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I really liked the chocolate aspect to this one that came across in both the flavor AND aroma. The aroma was quite pleasant on this one, but the flavor just fell a little short. A solid brew that I would drink again and if you haven't I suggest you do.","thagr81us","Jan 12, 2012"

3.83,6.1,3.5,3,4.5,4,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass. My last beer of 2011! A little disappointing with the pour- Very small off white/tan head that faded quick and left no traces. Smell was very underwhelming, some nutty malts and a small bit of chocolate. Taste is where this picked up a bit. Something about the coffee/chocolate stout characteristics mixed with the nutty/carmel brown hit the spot on this one. A pretty complex taste which made it hard to sit down. Not too schooled on the EBA's and perhaps that is where the stout qualities come in, but this was very smooth and full flavored. Feel was decent with a good bit of carbonation and stout like silk. Overall- An interesting beer that tastes better than it looks and smells. Complex and rich- I will be hitting another one soon-","TheDinger","Dec 13, 2011"

The smell was an improvement over the appearance, with a pleasant combination of caramel, nuts, and citrus. The taste is well-balanced between malt and hops - I'm picking up some chocolate, nuts, and some fruity earthiness. Hops are noticeable but not overpowering.

The nose is almost completely chocolate, actually smells like a German chocolate cake, caramel pudding, whipped cream, touch of roasted chestnuts, minimal, if any, fruit, citrus scents, any hops-based elements hiding better than Al-Queda. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is semi-sluggish and doesn't add texture as the weight is shed swiftly. More chocolate, caramel, toffee, whipped cream, molasses, manages to come across as sweet but not necessarily sugary. Pinch of apricot and cherry fruit as well as cereals, granola.

Granted the roasted flavors are there and in particular a flavor of bittersweet chocolate but it seems a little one-dimensional. Not a whole lot of complexity. The feel is surprisingly more carbonated than I expected. It had a decent scrubbing bubbles thing going on but I would have liked it to be softer and more coating than cleansing. Perhaps that would have allowed some more flavors to come out. A decent beer that is worth a try if you're in the Raleigh area.

Within the malts there was a strong presence of candied hazelnuts and chestnuts. Even some slight hints of spices. This would make a nice winter/Christmas beer. Medium mouth body which was nice because it was not particularly filling. Woul definitely order again.","MuddyFeet","Beers"

The beer was served a decent crisp brown with a thin head that diminished to a ring. The aroma was of dark malts with some undertoned pine hops. The taste was well balanced with a slight nut texture. The beer was light and crisp, an enjoyable brown ale.","atsprings","0"
