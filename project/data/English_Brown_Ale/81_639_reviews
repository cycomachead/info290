"4/2/15 Draft (Finley Dunnes Chicago) - Nice black pour, minimal carbonation and whit head. Malt aroma and taste, very smooth beer to drink. Roasted malt and chocolate taste but not strong. Overall good beer offering."
"From a bottle, pours a transparent dark mahogany brown.  Very smooth and silky.  Malt forward for sure, very little hops coming through.  It is a brown ale after all.  Its good for the style."
""
""
""
"I've come across rumors that this supposedly goes extremely well with chocolate cake. The combination was ok, but nothing special. By itself, though, this is a decent drink that's worth having again."
""
"Pours a Mahogany color with 3/4 inch of light bubbly head. Smell is quite sweet with heavy hints of caramel and the small of roasted malt. Carbonation in moderate and feels quite bubbly on the tongue. Not quite as smooth as id expected.Tastes much like it smells. Roasted malt, caramel, and a slight bitterness of coffee.Lacing is quite nice. Head dissipates rather quickly.Overall its a delightful refreshing dark ale. Not too heavy on the belly."
""
"One of the better mass production beers out there. Rather neutral malty taste but goes down smooth."
""
""
"This is a dark beer with out the nasty after taste. This beer is one of my favorite kinds of beers,most people will not drink them because they are scared of dark beers, but this dark beer is yummy, plus because most people will not drink it when they see the dark there will be more for you."
"Love me some New Castle, great beer...solid, and different in flavor.  Good stuff!"
"12 oz. bottle from Trader Joe’s. I don’t mind a brown ale, even a mass produced one. Unfortunately this one has a metallic bubble gum sort of sweet taste that I find nauseating. They could not have possibly planned this so it must be from the brewing process. Oh well!"
""
""
""
"It is my Budweiser."
"Great brown ale. Drink ice cold!"

"On Draught poured into a Geordie Schooner at my local village British pub. Has a dark-brown body, and a slightly caramel-colored head. Smell is a roasted ""burnt"" (I tend to like the burnt, smokey aroma in all mt alcoholic drinks) with a sweet malt aroma and it tastes how it smells with very little hoppiness. A perfect feel with a medium body, not too heavy or light. Overall, this is my go-to beer at most eateries and pubs if they have it, very drinkable, and I'll sometimes do a ""BlackCastle"" when transitioning to a stout. I used to put the bottles in my bilge when sailing long distances as it can be drunk at a higher temp than American ales (seawater is close to 55-60F and my cast-iron keel moderates the bilge temp)."

"Deep amber (15) with beige top and good lacing. Smells like a Strohs. Watery malt and lite mouthfeel. Good lite beer to start the day."
"Pours with a small, white head. Is reddish brown in color. Initial taste is of malts combined with sweet, floral flavors. Malts and floral flavors persist through final taste as a nutty flavor enters. Sweetness from the floral flavors are a bit high and throw the beer off balance. Overall, a slightly better than average brown ale."
"Had one and will never have another. Nuff' said"

"(Draft, revisited) at Canyon Club in Agoura Hills. Cream of mushroom soup. Some brown sugar maltiness comes through after awhile; 3/8/15"
""
""
""
"Overall: On tap I have no problems drinking this beer.  It's not great and not awful.  I wouldn't get it in the bottle."
""
""
"Pours golden brown with a quick dwindling off white head. Smooth crisp taste. Light on the pallet. Not my first choice... Although enjoyable."
""
"its changed over the years but still a good beer doesn't have the red dye colour in it any more"
""
""
""
""
"An acquired taste, which I never managed to acquire - and I tried!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is a very bland beer."
"I like New Castle Brown ale, it has a great wheat taste. Very fulling, but if your buying it in the states its just to much of a price for a pint."
""
""
"This is my ""grocery"" bought beer."

"Very easy drinking beer with a sweet taste and pleasant"
""
""
""
""
"All around easy beer to drink being a malt beer every beer guy would enjoy this everyday after a long day at work"
""
""
"My favorite brown ale. As I read the previous ratings, and reviews I am wondering if I am doing something wrong.  I absolutely love this beer.  It is best on tap though, tons better then from the bottle but isn't that the way it is for most beers?"
""
"New castle??  Where is this castle people keep talking about? All I see is an old moat of a beer."
"It's a boring cemical tasting joke of an ale. Never worth to buy"
"No complexity at all, easy drinking, reasonably enjoyable."
"Easy drinking but boring, sessionable brown ale."
""
""
""
"Very good beer o Like so much"
"A really enjoyable beer, goes down easily"
""
"Very good brown ale with pretty good quality."
"This was my brown ale of choice a while back that I would get in 12 packs before I got into all the dark brown ales, stouts, porters etc. Actually a decent beer if you are quaffing a few and doing stuff outside in the summer. It's not the sort of beer you really want to sit down with to analyze all the subtle complexities and richness."
"Nice caramel color with above average flavor"
""
""
""
""
"O) Not amazing, I would like to try it from a can, but they only sell them in 4 packs.  I had a smaller bottle in Las Vegas with a burger and fries and that format works better for me."
""
"Overall I find the Newcastle Brown Ale badly crafted and stale."
""
"First off let me state, I like this ale period! I don''t care about heads or lacing at all, I drink beer for two reasons only, the taste and the buzz!  I get just a hint of something floral and just the right amount of bitter(even though I do like a hoppy beer) the taste is very pleasant, the mouth feel is silky,honestly the aroma is rather weak, but i don't like strong smelling beers. I have been searching for my brand of beer, including making home brew and I have found it, we are all different and this brown ale suits my taste beautfully! we all have our opinions this is mine, I'm a fan, and because of the region i live in there really isn't a lot of choices. And for the buck of a mass produced brew it's for me!"

"A nice classic."
"People are too harsh on this classic daily beater."
"Metallic taste almost, faint hint of it. Good all purpose beer, drinkable."
"I am really surprised by the poor reviews on this beer. It really makes me question the ""expert's"" expertise. By no means is this the best beer I have ever drank, but it is a really good all purpose beer. It goes well with food, relaxation, refreshment, and just to fill that beer craving."
"Very soft mouthfeel but it's not really compensated with an overly crisp and refreshing feel, either. It's just kind of blah. The taste is much the same. If there was a malt liquor that made a brown beer this wouldn't be far from it. Very grainy and unpleasant alcohol feel even though it's quite low. Would not drink this beer for free."
""
"My introduction to the style, and still a really nice beer when I'm in the mood. Clean, subdued nuttiness and easy drinking. Good stuff."
"My go to beer at Buffalo Wild Wings."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Kind of an unremarkable beer. Sort of flimsy and not very pronounced in the flavor department. An OK beer to have when everything else on hand is BMC or Fruitarita-type nonsense."
"One of the best 3 beers I have ever tasted."
""
""
"Think bodied, reminds me of a Light Twisted Tea. Nothing really going on in the nose. Taste is sweet with a little skunkiness that reminds me off a Heineken. Not a great brown ale."
"Most industrial pale lagers are tastier than this!..."
""
""
""
"The type of beer you buy and drink in large quantities"
"Pours a reddish brown color with a one finger cream color head that disappates quickly to leave little lacing.  Aroma is malt sweetness a bit like dulche de leche.  Taste is sweet and malty, a small hint of nutty flavor.  Not much hop bitterness or yeast flavor.  Mouthfeel feel is thin, but drinkabke.  Overall the beer is average but holds a soft spot in my heart."
""
""
"Tastes great; very light and refreshing"
"A relatively aggressive pour results in a one inch off-white head, and a strong malt aroma wafts up. (A gentle pour results in not much of a head and not as much aroma.) Dark brown coffee color, the head dissipates fairly quickly with clinging lacing that follows the beer down the side of the glass as you drink. Sweet malt aroma if you take a whiff with your nose ""in"" the glass. Taste backs up the aroma with a dusty, English malt flavor. Full malt taste, with some bitterness in the coming through, just a touch of hops that fades quickly. The English yeast does come through, but I would have liked to have had it be more assertive to balance the malt dominance. Even though a bit one-dimensional, it is very flavorful. Lightly carbonated, as is typical for an English ale. Aftertaste is sweet and (you'll never guess) malty, and it lingers for awhile. While it is sweet, it is not overly or cloyingly so. This ale is meant to be consumed at English pub temperature. If you drink it too cold, it will taste thin and watery. It needs to be at the proper temperature to be fully appreciated. So, if you refrigerate it, let it warm up a bit and the body and mouth feel improves noticeably. At 4.7% ABV, this does meet the ""session"" criteria here in the USA, but it is a bit to strong for that in the UK. This ale, while pleasant and flavorful, it too one-dimensional for me."
"Pours clear, deep amber color. Very small head that dissipates quickly. Hardly any lacing. Malty flavor with a tart aftertaste that lingers for quite a while. Not bad, but the aftertaste is a bit unpleasant."
"This is my fourth favorite beer."

"fave beer ever and I have tried a lot!"

"Affectionately known as The Newkie in my group of mates. This to me is a perfect brew to have when having a chat in the pub. Admittedly there is a fairly strong initial taste when first trying and it is effectively a marmite scenario in that you either love it or hate it, there is no real inbetween on that front but in regards to my opinion (which lets be fair my review and all that) it is a good drink to have when relaxing in the pub with mates. As well as that I found it to be a good opener before a night out but I would say don't drink repeatedly all night as it has a tendency to make you feel heavier and perhaps more sluggish. Best thing out of Newcastle since Ant and Dec"
""
""
""
"I've enjoyed this brew before it was popular in the U.S. and will continue to do so.  Been to Newcastle.  Best pour came from a local pub with awesome company."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: quite a nice English Brown Ale, if a little to sweet for my liking. Definitely not a sessional, which is good at AU$72 a case or $22 a 6-pack."

"I've always wanted to try this beer and ending up grabbing a pint of it from my local store the other day. I was disappointed in this brew to begin with, but it grew on me. Has a distinctly corny smell and flavor that I'm not in love with, but isn't bad per se. An unusual aftertaste too, maybe due to the lack of hops. Very sweet. I'll gladly finish the pint, but I don't think I'll be picking up a six pack."

"My favorite aspect of this beer is the mysterious, but pleasantly sweet aroma. Nothing special about the lacing, tan head, or brown body though. Overall, Newcastle is a very, very easy beer to drink with little risk and little reward."

"Used to be one of my favorite beers. I have since learned New Castle is made with inferior ingredients. It is not very good quality and made with brown coloring. It has become beer pong beer for me. Great taste tho."
"Lacks body and flavor. Lots of adjuncts. Skunked from the clear bottle and this is the dominating flavor."

"Drinkability: Though not a great offering in my very humble opinion but solidly drinkable after a hard day’s work. However, it did not go well with typical fried appetizers but I’m thinking could add some nice dimension to fall/winter soups or stews. It may also cut greasiness of dishes such as roast pork."

"O - Clear bottles equal skunk taste and smell. I think this is a terrible beer. It is probably not light struck on draft, but I seldom choose this beer to consume. I bought a six pack to remind myself of why I never drink it. This is probably my least favorite English beer."

"O: Newcastle needs to ditch the clear bottles. I can't stand skunked beer. This beer would probably be in my top 5 if they'd put it in a brown bottle."
"This is what I like to call a two brew review. Two 12 oz brews are being reviewed. I do this to give you a honest opinion of this brew. From start to finish. I feel this brew would be better on tap or if it was in brown bottle."

"Overall, this beer functioned for us as a night cap. We had enjoyed dinner, trivia night, and some local Michigan craft, and decided to stick around for the show. Despite taking place in the same establishment as the first part of our evening, this was the closest thing to craft that we could find, and since we hadn’t yet reviewed it we figured why not. Having had this beer many times in the past I’m not sure what we were expecting to be different this time, but for some reason, now we found it to be much less enjoyable than in the past. Perhaps we are putting up our noses a bit, but nothing seemed authentic about this beer at all, through either the nose or the mouth. This is fine if you’re just shooting the breeze and don’t really care what you’re drinking, and likely much of this will be swilled throughout the World Cup events, but turn elsewhere if you’re looking for something a little less commercial."

"Overall: I really, really wanted to like this beer. Thank fuck I've tried other English brews, because if this is all I've had to judge English beers by, I'd say no thanks. Instead of buying this, get some Samuel Smiths, I just tried their Imperial Stout and it was pretty damn good. If you live in the midwest you can find a lot of Sam Smiths easily and they make some GREAT beers. This is probably the Bud Light of English beers, don't let it skew your opinion, England makes some great beer. Sadly, this isn't one of them, and It's one of the most available over here in the states."

"On-tap at BWW. Pours a dark amber color with a thick, foamy head. The aroma is mild with mostly malts. The taste is thin, simple, and watery. At the end of the day this is one of well-known brews that everyone carries that lacks real depth in the taste department."

"As to those with skunking issues check the code. 31-10-y means the beer was produced October 31 (shelf life of 6 months but I'm drinking at 7 with no issue) if you purchase from a reputable buyer there won't be an issue with temperature abuse. (Don't purchase6packs as the light gets to them. 12 or 24 only. )"

"Has a nice taste. More flavor than most other light beers. Easy to drink and even more delicious on tap. It has a tendency to get skunky in the clear bottles so it's hit or miss as far as tasting it from a bottle. I highly recommend it on tap. When served in an iced glass it's delicious. I would like to see the brewery use brown bottles as it keeps the light out, and will give a truer taste than it does in the clear bottles."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-This beer does not hold a candle to a craft brown-style ale, but it beats the crap out of drinking a Bud Light. The lightly skunked character did not hurt things too much, but the husky, malty, flavors weren't terribly impressive, either. All in all, a middle of the road brew."

"Beautiful and brown. I like an easy to drink beer that still has a full flavor. This isn't my favorite beer but it is damn good. Great to have on a hot summer day. Perfect to warm you up on a cold winter day. Appropriate for all climates. Casual drinkers and alcoholics both enjoy."

"Appearance is the best looking part with an obvious brown body and good enough head that has a bit of cascading to it. Flavor is decent, mild nuttiness, easy drinking but pretty ordinary obviously. Still, an ok selection."

" A very easy drinking ale with some light, rather simple, but nonetheless interesting flavors that can be a nice break from the ultra hopped craft brews or the typical AAL out there. This is considered a simple working man's beer in England, as I understand. It probably fits that definition, because I think this beer would quench thirst pretty well."

"Overall: Can't go wrong with newcastle there are plenty of brown ales but this is definitely my go to brown ale. It's not the most sophisticated but probably a nice and simple beer to have to knock back and enjoy. Great beer to have any day of the week for any occasion. Can't go wrong!"

" This beer just reminds me of one of my favorite gas station beers and I can get it in Illinois. Unfortunately, the closest place to get Yuengling is Ohio so this would do in a pinch. Able to put down a few easily. People who might like Newcastle are people willing to try a Honey Brown, Dos Equis Amber or perhaps an Michelob Amberbock."

"I had it in Oxford England while on a business trip and I have been a fan ever since... Of course it was a little better on tap in England then it is in a bottle in the States... It is smooth and doesn't have as much carbonation as most brews I have had in the US..."

"I used to really enjoy this beer when I was younger, but if you close your eyes while drinking this, you will see it is actually quite bland. The artificial caramel color that is added to this beer does deceive your senses into thinking there is more to this beer than their actually is, so their is something to be said about the eyes having the first taste. Since I cut out all artificial ingredients in my diet, this beer will no longer be in my fridge, nor ordered while out, and I also think it's a shady practice for a reputable brewery to be taking shortcuts on flavor while dosing some artificial crap to compensate for lack of quality."

"I bought a keg can 5l of newcastle brown ale. this beer is very enjoyable. it has an iron taste initially and finishes with a sweet honey aftertaste. this beer is lightly carbonated and very smooth. i had a large creamy head and it was a nice amber brown color. this beer sort of reminded me of boddingtons pub ale, only newcastle brown is a little darker. overall it is smooth and creamy and a great beer for sipping or drinking all night."

"Pours a light brown, clear with a decent head of loose white foam that fell pretty quick to a ring and film on top. Light little ruby blush. Nose is shy. Light sweet grain and a fruitiness. Bit of grass and toasted grain. Tatse is earhty with a light sweetness and a very light mouthfeel. Sweet grain that's drying in the middle. A little buttery and a bit of fruity flavor. The malt is very light and not as smooth and rich as some other browns. Little bit of hop bitter to finish it. The mouhtfeel is a bit slick and it's crisp with a bit of refreshment. There is a slight metallic bit underneath as it warms but by the time you finish your pint that is a vague memory. Has a surprising bit of refreshment to offer. Really very good and while ti is not rich or expansive in it's malt it is very easy to drink and extremely sessionable."
""
"Overall: Obviously not the greatest beer in the world, but it is a nice classic to have once in a while."
""
""
"Since I came to Newcastle I wanted to taste this beer, because everyone talks a lot about it over here. In my humble opinion it's overrated. It's just a nice Ale, quite strong, very good looking bottle, but not as cheap as it should be although the bottle is 500ml."

"New Castle Brown Ale is one of my favorite beers around. I don't know why it gets poor scores and ratings. Nice nutty aroma and very well balanced. I've started getting my brother in law in this beer and he only drinks Budweiser. although the ABV is low you can still enjoy socially and not worry about pissing every 5 minutes like most other beers here in the states."

"Although I haven't tried as many brews as the majority of people on here, I must say that of all that I have tried, this is by far my favorite beer. I have nothing but good things to say about this brew. I only wish that the other products from the same brewery were up to par with this one."

"I felt compelled to revisit this beer since it became available in cans. In the days before good beer was readily available in bars and restaurants in my area Newcastle was always my first choice when out for dinner/drinks, as it was commonly the only non-BMC brew available. I loved it on draft but always hated the terrible, clear bottle skunk flavor when I tried to buy it for home. I don't recall ever getting one that didn't taste that way. Fast-forward to 2013, poured from a can it tastes just like the draft Newcastle I ""grew up"" on. Although I now have what some call a snobby palate, Newcastle is going back in the rotation."

"Miller lite and bud light has more taste and cost less. I will taste other English brown ale then compare it to them . In future might be better or worse."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours as it looks with an off white head that laces well. Aroma is light, but of yeast, caramel malt and a slight sweetness coupled with a note of fruit. The taste is balanced, with very little hop influence, but almost bland - no complexity at all. Light bodied and reasonably carbonated. Finishes cleanly with just a hint of hop bitterness."

"Pours light brown with a little caramel colored foam that quickly breaks. Aroma is surprising fruity, not unpleasant, minimal malt and caramel. On the palate the beer is mild brown sugar and dry sweet malt, hints of vinous fruit, vanilla notes, tea. Minimal nuts or chocolate. People taste strong nuts in this? Maybe if your taste buds have some form of Olympic level training. Gustatory illusion based on style expectations I think. Watery tepid body and drinks more like a lager than a brown ale. Finishes with a fairly dry bitter earthy note. Beer with a lofty reputation that is not born out in the tasting."
""
"Its a smooth brown ale that does the job when you want a cold one. I wasn't a fan of brown ale beers or brown beers til I had this one, then I started to have more. I love that its smooth and it has a taste of its own. But that should be expected when it comes to Newcastle"

"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a ruddy brown amber with a thin, fine off-white head with decent retention and lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, nuts, a hint of sourness and whiffs of skunkiness. Flavor follows, with light caramel, slightly biscuit malt, hints of toasted malt, walnuts, slightly sweet. A lightly hoppy, malty finish with faint skunkiness. Light bodied. A lightly, but satisfactorly flavored English brown that is well suited for its purpose as an entry level English brown. It is refreshing that Calendonian has not succumbed to the fad of brown bottles that would prevent the delightful addition of skunk butt to the beer over time. Or not. Not a bad light mealtime beer. A good choice if you stuck somewhere with limited beer selection as it's quite well distributed and more interesting than most mass produced beer. Buy the ones in the dark cooler."

"O: frankly, i love it. it's not overwhelmingly good, but it's all i need to get a decent English brown ale fix. the nose is especially correct, but the taste is solid. for $9.36 a six-pack, it's a decent enough buy when put in context ... and as solid a session beer as I've found at 4.7% ABV"
"Good mouthful, not much on the nose. I taste roasted nuts and some oak. There is some burnt sugar as well. I was already acclimated to English Ales so this one did not particularly stand out but nevertheless a good solid beer. Perfectly suited to the mass market but better than your typical mass market beer."

"Taste: It's just OKAY. My dad said that in the '70s he used to drink this a lot and it tasted a lot better (citing that they probably changed the recipe, and that the beer was in brown bottles). It's light like it ought to be given the ABV, but it just doesn't taste very good. It's not bad thanks to the fact that there's nothing off-putting and that it's not super sweet, but it's pretty mediocre."
""
""
""
"O - The can is really cool looking, and if you're going to a gathering where MCBs are the norm (bbq, sports, beach, hike, crappy house party), this might make for an interesting but safe change of pace. Honestly, it seems like people will just be happy to hold this new almost-pint can and look different/slightly more tasteful than the innumerable MCB can-wielders. Aside from it's exterior looks, you could do some hand waving and say that this tastes better out of a can than the bottle. The bottom line is that there's a lot to be desired. No coffee! No cocoa! No toasted flavor! Poppycock!"

"Overall Impression: This is the Quad to end all Quads. An immediate dark fruit punch in the mouth with slowly developing dark malt and yeast character that somehow manages to stay medium bodied and a slightly dry finish. Although it is very similar in taste to most well made quads, its nimble body and drying finish take the Westy XII to another level. This is a malt bomb that is amazingly drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel was thin and watery, almost like a light beer. No real toastiness or nuttiness that goes along with the beautiful style of beer that is an English Brown. Very bland taste that didn't improve at all as the beer warmed. The watery taste gave way to a faint graininess that faded away into a hop bitterness that just didn't compliment the thin beer at all. This is a pathetic excuse for the style. Avoid this brew. Go with a Samuel Smith's or a Boneshaker instead."

"Kind of a hard beer to review. It's pleasant and by no means undrinkable -- it's sort of eccentric, too, in it's nose and flavor profile. Still I can't imagine scenarios where I'd be trying this again. Probably worth trying once and deciding for yourself -- I find it genuinely odd that such a mild, eccentric little beer became the favored brand of working class toughs, but history is filled with such oddities."

"Newcastle is a name synonymous with the brown ale style. This should be attributed to the brand's history and no other reason. Presently, it's a brown ale with a lager's outlook on life. The brewery's aim is no longer to produce the best, most flavourful brown ale but, rather, to market a dark(ish) beer that is still insipid enough to have mass-market appeal."

"Oh how the mighty have fallen. I remember this beer 20 or so years ago when you could only get it in pint bottles. It tastes nothing like it once did.

"Overall-Wow, I used to love this beer. Revisiting now is kind of eye opening, my palate has came a long way. This beer isn't horrible but its not anything other than beer to drink to get drunk. The flavor is better than most lagers but compared to other brown ales it is falling very far behind. Lots of other fish in the sea.2.75"
"Poured a 12 oz. bottle into a Sam Adams glass. Poured a clear, medium-light brown, with almost no head and even less retention or lacing. Aroma is malty, with what I thought smelled like caramel. But there's not a whole lot to it. The taste is about the same. Not much distinctive or notable about it. Oddly enough, it had a nice mouthfeel. There's nothing bad about it, but there's not much to it, either."

""
""
"Food match: A nice hot vindaloo curry will completely overpower the flavour of this brew... which isn't such a bad thing."
"Always buy the 12 pack of bottles or the cans because the packaging shields the beer from the harmful rays. If you buy the 6 packs, there is more surface area exposed to the light which will skunk the beer faster."

"I really do like the brown color to this beer - a burnt caramel is what I would call it. The smell was mostly a muted mix of the normal barley and malts, but at least it wasn't overpowering. The beer can pour a tall head if your not careful, and has you would think, it had little staying power. Surprisingly, the lacing was very evident and stuck all the way down the glass. Mouthfeel was like most others, a high level of carbonation evident the moment it hits your tongue. What really stands out is the smooth taste of the dark ale, it was very, very drinkable - that just stands out to me. Overall I really do like this beer - strong taste, little after affect, and was simply happy to be reunited."

"i like this. i bought it on a bet. my buddy swears by the brown. thought id dislike it...but .after a year or so of trying to decide, this has become a goto when iam in the mood for something with a little meat on its bones, not the best option as far on the darkside (much more of a dunkel fan) but there is something to be said about how easy drinking this beer is, its endearing mix of malts and grains, its almost perfect amount of carb for the style, the classic can, overall id say, if you like the darkside, give this one a sip, you probably wont be dissapointed. pairs nicely with a roast.

If you didn't tell me what this beer was and simply put it under my nose, I'd tell you it was British. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and wet with a little carbonation toward the finish.

"Overall - A nice, easy drinking beer. A little lacking in character. The odd thing is this beer tastes a little like a German lager. Seriously, it looks and tastes like Shiner Bock. Weird."

"Newcastle Brown Ale Beer is a cult classic in our college town. When I ask my lady to pick-up some Brown Ale this seems to be her throwback to make us both happy on flavor and price. This beer is best served cold into a pint glass for a mild pleasant maltiness, although somewhat thin and empty, still easily drinkable when fresh."
""
"O: Easy drinking, light yet has good flavor. Has what all ale should have but in a light presentation which lends itself to session drinking. I find it quite pleasant because it is so easy to drink mulitiple glasses without feeling bloated in spite of the sweetness. This beer has a place in my rotation of ales."
""
""
""
""
"O- A very popularized (industralized) Brown Ale with a large cult classic style following. Does not possess the typical Brown Ale qualities that I enjoy (Malty and Toasty). As it warms, it seems as if I'm sipping on a black tea."
""
"Overall Impression: It tastes almost as good at room temperature as it does when chilled."

"This has an intense ruby cola color with a nice cap of foam. There’s a light somewhat malty aroma to it that’s not overpowering, but just enough to make its presence known. The flavor has a mild roast and a mild sweetness, followed by a clean finish. Overall it’s an innocuous and harmless as can be."
"Overall, an easy beer to drink but only because it resembles thick water. Would be good with a really flavorful pizza though since it would still taste like pizza as you drink it. Then again, this is where they had it on tap; the pizza place. There are better beers for the money."

"The beer pours from the keg a candy caramel brown, much like maple syrup. The head is big and smooth with a couple of craters and sticky Styrofoam-like lacing, though it mellows out into islands of foam. The beer smells cloying with sweet malts that have a tinge of sour in them and slightly skunked smell. The beer’s taste is much like the smell only less cloying. Caramel malts and biscuity malt are present in the taste, and there is a slight roasted flavor also present. Bitters are slight an nearly not present except in the aftertaste where there is a slight medicinal play in among the sweet malts. Mouthfeel is slightly harsh with carbonation in the initial sip, but mellows into a thick and slightly chewy feel that is quite pleasant though has a slightly watery feel and it does leave a slight sticky feel in the mouth. Overall this beer is a nice English brown, the mouthfeel is a little weak, but overall it’s worth a taste."

"O - This is a nice, light for style beer; very drinkable. I've had it in bottle too and picked up the same metalic smell and taste. Must be me, because I don't see others mention it."
""
""
""
"O - A simple beer, in the best way possible. As a darker beer that's lower in alcohol content than a lot of its relatives, it's great for having if you want more than just a couple. Nothing crazy, but a step above most and a good everyday beer."
""
"Body is medium-light with a slightly watery finish. Effervescence is medium. I used to drink this by the case, well, buy it that way at least. Now I'm wondering why I loved it so much. Never really noticed the metal note then. This is much better on tap, the difference is so pronounced, more so than any other beer I've ever had."

"What a boring beer! How did Newcastle end up getting this beer into virtually every bar in America? It's not that good. It's a beer that someone with no knowledge of beer would drink when he/she's in the mood for a ""premium"" beer. It's a little watery for starters and then doesn't really boast any of the nice nutty profiles the style is appreciated for. Oh well, nothing I can do about it!"
""
""
"Pours a medium reddish brown color with a thin off white head that shows little retention. Smells of light brown sugar, fruity esters, a hint of butter, and a bit of mineral water. The flavor is sweet and fruity with caramel, light brown sugar, a hint of chocolate and a touch of diacytyl. Medium body with a moderate level of bubbles and a sweet crisp mouthfeel. I used to drink these a lot when I was first getting into craft beer, but its been a long time since I've had one. Decent brown ale, but really could use a bit more chocolate or caramel to back it up."

"Poured from an 18 oz bottle into a lager glass. Pours a dark ruby with a finger worth of head. Leaves decent amounts of lacing. Smells of faint caramell malts and some slight corn grains. The taste is of tons of caramel malts with some ripe apple in the background. Some slight grains and even slighter adjunct. Tastes better than how I describe it. The mouthfeel is very creamy, although it opens up no new flavors. Overall, It was easy to drink, And I would definitely buy this stuff again as kegs for a party."

"I'm new to beer-drinking so I don't know fancy terminology to describe it. The bottle looks great to me, it's bright and fun. Packaging makes you want to drink, which is important to me in choosing a beer. Even though I drank from a bottle, I've seen the way it pours and the head doesn't last for very long. It dissipates about 1 minute and a half after it's poured. So you're better off having it from the bottle. The smell was like a dull yuengling (which I love how yuengling smells, but I'm not a fan of the taste). The taste was very bland and bitter. Almost a little too robust. Like drinking extremely strong tea without sweetner (yes I'm a southerner). And the mouth feel was a little too bubbly to me. I like a dull carbonated feeling. If you're more about hops and robust-ness then this is your beer. But if you look for more of a well-rounded flavor that expands when it's in your mouth this is not for you."
""
"The appearance was rather rusty ,but very good body and a nice bubble top. The first whiff was a bit odd,but it improved the longer it sat. It has a good fruity ,malty odor and taste and robust finish that didnt leave me thirsty,very satisfying. I would recommned this beer for anything. Heavy enough for a good jolt an light enough to be refreshing. Great beer"

"O - This beer is not good. I’m not sure it’s because of the long trip from England in clear bottles, but there’s a ton of skunk in this. It looks very nice and has a decent mouthfeel, but the aroma and taste leave much more to be desired. I hope this isn’t what most people think of when they hear brown ale."

"A friend of mine had me try this. It's one of his favorite beers, and I trusted him up until this point. I took the first sip (out of a bottle), and I hated it. I asked him if they had been sitting in his car for the last few months, because it tasted like the worst skunk beer you could possibly drink. And, too my surprise, he said that was exactly how it was supposed to taste. I can't get down with a beer that's supposed to taste skunked."

"Overall / Drinkability: Nicely drinkable, went well with a meal (Mushroom meatballs). I've had this many times over the years, but there has always been something ""off"" when I drank it all those other times (skunky, metallic, etc.). This time I suspect it was fresh enough to properly convey the flavor of this beer. Overall - just above average. Not deep in flavor, not complex, but a good steady beer."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability: this isn't a beer I would seek out, but it's not too bad, and it got me pleasantly buzzed, even accompanying a ribeye and potatoes. The flavour is manageable, in that it at least has one."
""
""
""
"O=I had low expectations for this beer based on others' reviews and, while better than I had anticipated, was still left hoping for more. To me, browns should be robust and packed with malted flavor...this was just not present here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a great beer if you like bitterness of a dark beer but don't mind a bit of sweetness as well. Feels like a well deserved treat that should be earned rather than bought. Definitively choose tap over bottle, feels like every bottle I've had tends to leave the taste of the cap in my mouth. Nevertheless a great beer!"

"It comes in a clear bottle so the colour is no surprise. The body is clear and on the yellow side of brown. There is a good amount of head (maybe two fingers) which is beige to brown. The aroma is heavy on the malt. I smell mostly cereal grains and bread, maybe a hint of peanut butter. The taste is light and not complex at all. To me it tastes like caramel and ash. It definitely has a buttery taste that seems to coat the tongue which is probably responsible for making it taste light. There is a hops sensation in the aftertaste. I find it has a medium body and appropriate carbonation. Overall, I'm somewhat disappointed in the lack of taste. A brown ale could accomplish much more. Actually, it reminds me of a lager with a little more of a dull taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this is one of those beer mysteries to me. how this product became world renowned is absurd. its average at best, lacking a lot of flavor, and being unsatisfactory in many ways. it pours the same as it looks in the clear bottle, thin and light brown with a small off white head. smells like english malts and caramel malts, but nothing assertive. just kind of smells like a beer. flavor is similarly bland. i much prefer robust brown ales, and this just isnt it. some sweeter malt flavor up front and a metallic taste on the back end. not real nice. mouthfeel is fine, fair carbonation and a drinkably medium body. overall though this beer is a constant let down. more flavor, more body, and more life are all necessary here. pass this one up if you can."

"When it comes to this beer it's all about finding a good six pack or 12 pack. If you get a new six or 12 pack that just got put on the shelf you are in luck. I loved this beer. The smell can be skunky. The taste is nutty and kinda of caramel like. Honestly I don't know why I like this beer so much. It's an easy beer to get drunk off of and it's also a good beer just to have a few of. I rated it pretty eye for my opinion. I think people should at least try this."

"Pours a nice chestnut brown color with a small white head that does not last too long. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aroma is of dark malts and nuts. Taste is prominantly nutty with a minimal bitter finish. I was expecting more from this beer. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side. Overall not a bad brew and just average brown ale."
""
""
""
"I poured from bottle to glass. The head was thin finger thick and light tan in color. It disappeared rather quick but left some lacing. The color was of a tea, amber mainly. The aroma had a metallic note with faint malt and no describable hop notes.The taste was mainly of the metallic note described in the aroma that faded to a bready malt aftertaste. The mouth feel was medium with little residual carbonation. Overall not a bad beer. The low marks may have been due to age as the stuff probably doesn't fly off the shelves here quite as a fast as other specialty brews. Overall I'm given the impression that this is the UK version of a Budweiser or other mass produced brew."

"O: Just as tasty as I remember it from years ago when we first discovered it in England. Very sessionable. Smooth."

""
""
""

"Poured from bottle to Newcastle glass the beer pours a rich dark brown color, translucent, with a small 1/2 finger cap, some retention and lacing. The aroma is a bit muted but consists of a distinct caramel malty sweetness, small earthen hops, and a nutty character. I would prefer a bit more volume as it's not bad just mild in nature. Similar the nose the beer starts and ends with the thick caramel malt sweetness with a light but noticeable earthy hop and mild bitterness. The nutty character provides a gentle yet fulfilling and balances everything out well. Finishes a bit watery and thin but crisp and clean. Lighter bodied. Overall, it's been a long time since I've had a Newcastle. This was more enjoyable than I remembered. The malty sweetness hit the spot!"

"This is too sweet sometimes. Also, this doesn't strike me at all as what I think of as a 'brown' ale. To give color to taste, Golden. But it has a certain crispness. Something weird about this one -- It used to taste skunked every time I had it until I had it on tap. Since then, have never had a skunky one. Maybe it's a coincidence. When I don't want to think too much before grabbing something, I know this will be fine: enough of a distinctive taste worth coming back too. ...If you like it a little sweeter."

"I have never gotten into this one. The clear bottle pours a medium colored brownish red with a lightly cream colored head. This always gives a bit of a tequila smell from it, with some hazelnut and a bit of tofee malt. Flavor follows suit, and for some reason I get a tequila flavor from this (I do NOT like tequila). A watered down brown ale that seems to almost have a tequila aftertaste. Color is faint. Not a win in my book."

"This beer tastes like nothing to me. I really want to like it because it's a beautiful color and nicely presented and widely available. But every time I have it I wind up sucking it down really fast because I keep straining to extract some flavor from it. I wonder if the clear glass bottle means that whatever flavor it has is zapped out by the time it gets to me. It's a waste and a shame."

"Slight hint of hoppy aromas and more than a touch of bitterness in the aftertaste. Some of that European cat pee aroma. It's pretty beery in a nice way. But that dirty, mushroomy taste is not to my liking. More of a lager than an English Brown."

OK if it's the best option at a bar, with burgers, on a hot day, etc. But I probably won't buy on a whim anymore. If you're getting someone going on better beer (that's in your neighborhood grocery store), there are lots of better options."

"I read somewhere that they've been making this beer since 1927. You'd think that in all that time they'd figure out that putting beer in clear glass bottles is a recipe for disaster. I'd like to try this on tap someday (unless it comes in clear glass kegs - which wouldn't shock me), but I will never, ever drink a bottle of this stuff again as long as they sell it in clear glass. It smells like Pepe le Pugh's arse. It's a shame, since the flavor might really be good. Hmmm. Perhaps this is how the English get back at us for winning our independence."

"Newcastle Brown Ale from The Caledonian Brewery Company Limited is an English Brown Ale that is unremarkable in every aspect. ""The One and Only""?

"This beer should not be considered craft, but I guess to the masses it is. I had this at a hockey game, this was the best of the worst. It poured a dark red with brown highlights. Head was 1 finger that vanished quickly. The smell is of light roasted malts and a little bit of a ho presence. Taste is like malt flavored water. I do not pick up chocolate, caramel or any other flavor in this beer. Mouthfeel is thin with mild carbonation and it leaves a metallic tinge in the mouth. Overall, it is better than BMC, but not worth drinking."

"O- For such a mass-produced beer, this really is a nice change of pace. I've had it before and I'm sure I'll have it again."
"O: Not bad, not great. Can get it pretty cheap at my local pub, but usually don't."

"O - An okay beer that seems to not quite have what I want. Not enough flavor and the sweetness in it seems unbalanced. But, it is better than a Bud."

"O- Seen this on the shelves forever and finally got around to trying it. It is NOT worth the 10$ sixer asking price but it isnt a bad beer, just nothing remotely special."
"O-an average brown ale that is a little thin in weight and flavor"
"Overall: In addition to the regular bottles, I've now had this from a minikeg and from a fresh bottle from the UK. These latter two versions are slightly better, but not by much. I'm thinking that this just may not be that good of a beer. Theres a difference between 'balance' and 'boring'."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with decent flavors and aromas."
"Very thin/watery taste. Not much on the nose either. It's okay and doesn't taste bad, just a bit watery. Had it on tap and in the bottle. Doesn't seem to travel well. Not too sure this comes from a great water sourse, so that might be a factor... it's pretty much ""meh"" for me."
"O: I like my brown ales thicker and nuttier. But I will not frown when my brother hands me one."
"O: I find it enjoyable. It may not be the sexiest pick, but you can't argue with a classic. This is a nice beer."
"Cheers! Mike"
"O) I could drink a bunch of these, and I have in the past. This is the beer that made me realize there was more to drinking beer than bonging and slamming Milwaukee's Best. Beer is also meant to be appreciated and really enjoyed, and I still really enjoy this one."
"Short to medium length decently consistent aftertaste"
"O: Not bad definitlely would have on tap again, although, I wish it were a bit stronger."
"O - This is a simple brown ale. Not much on the nose. The taste is good, but plain. Mouthfeel is ok, but lighter than the style and appearance would have you believe. A mediocre ale."
"Overall: I tend to find Newcastle a reliably refreshing tipple when I'm in the mood for a brown ale. For me, it will always be an old stand-by."
"It's all right. But why is it in clear-glass bottle?"
"This beer seriously surprised me. It pours a pretty nonexistent head. Look like a deep mahogany in bottle and glass. Taste is subtle but gets better after finish. It is a good Brown Ale. Not mind-blowing but rather enjoyable to say the least. Better than I expected."
"O: I know it's fashionable to hate on popular beers, but ""Newkie Broon"" is still pretty solid. I've had it numerous times on-tap and out of the bottle, and it is always reliable. I've yet to get a skunked bottle, but then again, I may just be very lucky in this respect. I like this one with bangers and mash."
"This may be a lightly skunked review. Having had this before I will balance my critique. Clear ruddy brown with a respectable head. Some lace to boot as well. Smell is light sweet malt and faint earth. Taste is lightly sweet malt and earthy hops. Some mild butterscotch as well. Firm bitter finish is clean and dry. Feel is finely carbonated and refreshing. Certainly drinkable but the clear bottles affect the freshness too much. A decent brew but only that. A step above the BMC/Hiney-Licken but not a very big one."
"Overall-This used to be one of my favorite beers. After drinking other Brown Ales this is kind of disgraceful."
"Mediocre at best flavor and a pretty poor aroma for a premium priced brown ale. Something I'm glad I grew out of drinking now that my palate has matured. There' just much better options out there for the price."
"I had this again at red robin and to me the flavor and moutfeel were better than I previously had entered in the review. I adjusted but felt the smell was muted so took a 1/4 point away."
"(O) It's a decent, go to brew. Not huge in the craft world, but it's one of my overall picks at places that don't have much of a selection. Pretty solid for a decent flavor and satisfying brew, but there are definitely better brown ales out there, but this one is a good base."
"This is a type that is meant for people getting into beers with taste. It's far from anything special, but if you want to get a keg of it then I'm sure that no one would complain of it at a party. I would not buy this if I want to be amazed though."
"Not a whole lot of depth. But an easy drinking, wholly average beer."
"D: ""drinkable"" in the sense that downing one of these won't make you ill or leave you with a pounding headache in the morning. My girlfriend and I finished the six-pack I got for old time's sake, but it took effort. When English browns have proliferated so much, particularly on this side of the Atlantic, you can afford to skip this one."
"Overall: An ok brew but mediocre as a brown ale. Flavors could be fuller and darker."
"O: I like it. It is very drinkable. Because of its not that strong taste, this beer is good to pair with any food."
"Overall: A bit underwhelming."
"Smells of caramel, bread, skunk and brown sugar. Taste is watery carbonated caramel skunk.. sweet and skunky. I used to really like this beer until I tried it in a can, it was so much better... it didn't have that skunk flavor."
"Generally recomended but don't think this is some keep-at-bay heavyweight. Buy a 6-pack and have it around."
"D - Drinkable and enjoyable ale. The flavor profile feels full and interesting, and the color looked great."
"Overall: I think that brown ales either go the way of lots of alcohol or sweet. This one is sweet, maybe a little too sweet but very drinkable. It takes knocks for the macrobrew watery feel I think but it is a decent beer."
"A poor excuse for an ale. Incredibly bland and watery, with an insubstantial body - not to be upheld as an example of the style. Perhaps it was a better beer in times gone by, but I find it hard to believe that this enjoys the reputation it seems to have among many. Avoid in favour of something better."
"Enjoy!"
"EDIT: I've lurked here for a long time, and have come to trust certain posters' reviews when looking to try a new brew. So, a big ""Thanks"" to y'all!"
"A very nice beer. Easy drinking, easy to get along with no matter your taste. Let your Budweiser-drinking buddies try this one."
"Though a traditional beer, there are far better English browns out there."
"O - An easy-drinking dark beer for those who are tired of lager and ""typical"" styles of beer. Compliments seafood dishes wonderfully."
"All in all not a very good beer. The first one is bearable the ones that follow become harder and harder to swallow."
"D: A very drinkable, tasty, reliable brew that is like comfort beer. Familiar brown ale that is not setting the world afire, but is good."
"O- not a bad choice when immersed in a BMC locale, but not nearly as good as most other brown ales."
"Overall: This beer does not compare very well with Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale, but I would stop short of saying it is less than average. If I was craving a brown ale at a restaurant that served nothing else, I would drink Newcastle."
"Fine dining needs to increase their beer knowledge like they have their wine knowledge and food pairings."
"O- a good beer, something I enjoy when I'm wanting an ale that's not over the top with hops"
"O: Overall, having had it in can, bottle, and on tap, the tap is the better of the three, followed by the can, then the bottle. The bottled version always has that skunky smell and taste, whenever you get it. So if you can, get it from the can."
"Hits hard with a heavy sting of carbonation, Then slightly sweet molasses and slightly bitter citrus, and some astringent alcohol, finishes dry. Very well balanced and easy drinking, but it is unremarkable and short on flavor."
"Final Grade: 3.02, a C+."
"Nice dark brown color with dark amber red highlights. Small head less than inch, dissipates quickly. Does not have a big nose; what light smell it has is sweet and malty. Medium body with good carbonation but not much complexity to the flavor. Some caramely sugar is evident in the maltiness. Only light hoppy bitterness. Very drinkable, nothing particularly memorable."
"Overall = B+"
"Overall: Nice to try, bit single dimensional"
"I was surprised by this beer, better than expected. A good brown ale, very light and easy to drink, tastes good, actually a bit sweet, and not entirely too spendy. Probably a bit overpriced, but so are it’s competitors. This is one of my defacto fridge beers and is an all around great simple, refreshing brew that is easy to drink and quite tasty. I’m happy I can find this on tap at most places I go as it tastes a lot better on tap than in the bottle."
"For me, this is fairly bland other than the sweet bread/caramel. Half pint would do me right."
"Overall this is a very boring beer, but extremely drinkable, especially at only 4.7% ABV."
"DRINK (3/5)"
"Newcastle Brown Ale has character and a good body, but the adjunct qualities start to surface after a bit. I’d still choose this over an actual adjunct produced beer, but I’m not a huge fan of the amber similarities."
"not something i could get into. even if this bottle wasnt skunked, i couldnt see this being too enjoyable, just way too bland and average. the only way ill drink this again is if its from a can."
"Overall this beer is a good one. Not great, but good. Definitely a brown ale, true to style. This is a drinkable beer to say the least, I might buy this brand again if I am ever in the mood for a brown ale."
"I can't tell you how many times I've had this classic, but now I've decided to finally sit down and review it. It pours a clear light sienna topped by a finger or so of off-cream foam. The nose comprises light caramel, dusty biscuit, and a touch of light grass. It's all pretty meek, lemme tell ya. The taste refuses to change things up very much, save in the intensity department, and it's not like it went crazy with that particular decision. This isn't to say it tastes bad, it just doesn't really taste all that much at all. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta smooth feel. Overall, a real easy-drinker, something that doesn't pretend to be more than it is. I'll likely have many more in the future."
"Caramel and sweet barley malts that are the main character of the beer. A light hop bite is present in the back that round out the flavors, making this a beer that anybody could like. The fact of the matter with this one is the amazing drinkability of it. It goes down super smooth, and that's one of the main reasons its so popular. Its a decent beer, macro or not. As smooth as it is, its got a really nice zest to the mouthfeel that furthers along the rounding out of the beer. It makes the malts pop. Overall, just a good drink, and one that the world can appreciate."
"Overall: good beer! Delicate but tasty could have a sixpack and would want to"
"Overall: Easy to drink. Not dynamic. A total mass market product. I once thought this was an excellent beer now I think its fine for washing down popcorn."
"O- It's perfect balance and it's refreshing feel make this beer a standout in terms of drinkabilty. It's not everyday that you can find a beer that feels delicate, complex and that you could drink in loads without getting tired"
"Only lightly carbonated, it goes down pretty easily. Overall not terrible, a decent macro-type brown ale. If I'm going for a cheaper beer, I can handle a Nukie Brown, much better than most American macros, but if I were getting beer for myself, I would only pick it up if there wasn't anything else and I really needed to get something (for whatever reason)."
"overall: simply a brown-colored lager; very little to remember except for slight hops making it a modicum more tasty than a regular light lager; nothing to write home about."
"D: A pretty drab, if passable, brown ale lacking body, flavourfulness, and complexity. A bit gassy, but otherwise very sessionable and best for social drinking."
"Had NewCastle at the Keystone Pub for the first time on 3-2-2008. I saw it on the bottle list there. After having most of what was on the list already, I chose to try something new. The beer pours out as a light brown color, very clear looking with a fizzy whie head. The smell of the beer is a little skunky but not enough to hinder the beer. The taste of the beer is sweet up front with a nutty caramel flavor going on that fades into a bitter dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel of this is pretty light and has a low carbonation to it. Overall I like this beer, It's good as a casual or social beer."
"Overall - A pretty good brew. Not up there with the craft beers as far as complexity of taste (being that it was really single-faceted with just being a malty beer), but it was better than other wide-distribution beers nonetheless."
"I would call this a very mediocre beer. I was hoping for more."
"Overall- a decent brown ale. Certainly not my favorite, but I've certainly had worse."
"Overall, a good, easy drinking brown ale. I think the convenience of the DraughtKeg system goes well with a session beer like this. A great combination for a party!"
"Overall, this beer is of the upmost drinkability and quality taste, especially being a macro beer. But like all other imported beers, this is just another wonderful beverage to have. It's well worth the price. This is a beer to always keep in the fridge."
"O: I didn't like this brew, but the flavors were somewhat pronounced and balanced and they seemed to transition well. There wasn't much I got for hops in it, bittering or aroma. It's an okay brew that some will love, but it's not the brew for me. If you like a bread like brew that ends with a smoky kind of burnt taste to it this would be an awesome Ale for you."
"Overall- I enjoyed it. Nothing extraordinary, but it's alright. Definitely an iconic brown ale. Worth trying, and coming back to when you're looking for something basic to drink mindlessly."
"It's a decent generic type of beer, it's the beer that got me into trying different beers other than the giant beer companies. So in that sense it holds a special place. It does not have as much flavor as other brown ales, but it is slightly sweet and simple. A good starter beer for a beginning beer drinker. I like how the label looks, and it makes me want white castle burgers. (Which by the well it does go well with)"
"O: Looks somewhat promising but the further you get into the drink the more your let down. WAY to watery."
"Pours a clear dark brown color with a 1 inch light brown head that fades to a thin cap. Foamy sheets of lacing form on the glass on the drink down. Smells of toasted malt, some nuttiness, and an off metallic smell. Taste is of the toasted malt, some slight caramel, slight nut, and subtle hops. The metallic smell I got is also in the taste somewhat. This beer has a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. A bit coating in the mouth after each sip. Overall, this is a pretty average beer that is widely available. Nothing too great or too horrible."
"I'm not huge on brown ales, and this one's no superstar among them. Pours a cola brown with a finger of off-white head. Somewhat weak aroma, toasted malts and plastic-y. More of the same in the taste, with touches of chocolate perhaps. Light-medium mouthfeel, a bit thin, and not very drinkable."
"Very drinkable."
"nothing remarkable about this beer but very tasty and heads above most macro lagers."
"This is a good brew that again MUST be enjoyed from the tap before making a final ruling. On-tap is where it shines not in a bottle."
"Newcastle Brown is to an English Brown as Becks is to a German Pils. Actually, it kind of reminds me of a fruity version of Shiner Bock."
"Overall: Easy to drink. Not too complex. Should be an easy transition beer for BMC drinkers coming to the craft side. I could drink several of these, it's not bad, but I would probably move on to more interesting flavors after one or two."
"I don't know why Newcastle makes there beers in clear bottles, it's f-ing stupid as shit. I know this beer is going to be skunky, but it's not my fault they decided to make a beer in a clear bottle, so I will grade it accordingly. This beer pours a small one finger white head that disappears pretty quickly, it looks like I will get good lacing out of it, but I'm not sure. The body is dark brown with hues of red. Overall it looks pretty nice accept for the head disappearing fast. Smell is slightly skunky, slightly malts, with hints of coffee, cocoa, molasses, etc. I'm pleasantly surprised by how many different flavors I am getting on the smell, we will see if it translates to the taste, but for now it's not too bad. I can't say it's a great smell because of the skunk, but it's not very much skunk, just a little bit, noticeable, but not unbearable by any means. The taste however is not very good at all. For starters there is not nearly enough carbonation, it feels like strait water in my mouth. Secondly, the taste is just all over the place, the three most detectable flavors I get are water, skunk, and maple syrup, but not a good maple syrup taste, a fake, watery, thin male syrup taste. There might be a tiny bit of malts and a smidgen of hops in the finish, but not nearly enough to save this beer. Overall it's just way too watery, frankly it tastes like mineral water that has lost it's carbonation. Drinkability is pretty low due to the bad mouthfeel and the not so great taste. Overall on this beer: bad taste, HORRENDOUS mouthfeel, and all around just not that great."
"O - This is a beer that has been ""dumbed down"" for the macro masses. Not a bad beer, but certianly not what one would recommend in a brown ale."
"Overall: This a good beer that is very drinkable. While it doesn't have a ton of depth or flavor it is easy to drink, refreshing and satisfying. A decent go to beer."
"DRINKABILITY: Well, it wasn't too bad but there was nothing about this beer that stood out either. Because of the low alcohol content, it goes down easily enough and isn't especially filling but I wouldn't recommend this for a session beer because it's just too bland. Recommendation: if you're looking for a session beer, keep looking -- find something more interesting. If you're committed to an English Brown Ale, try a Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale instead."
"Overall - I'd love to get this in a can and have it on tap to see the difference without the slight skunk the bottle gives, hopefully its richer. That said go grab one and see for yourself."
"O= very drinkable in session if you're in the mood, great for parties or dinners where beer isn't the main feature. Essentially a great table-beer but nothing earth-shaking. A good not-yellow stock ale to have around. Should go well with anything from fish to fowl to beef and pasta, and almost anything else."
"not the best out there, but something i keep around on a regular basis."
"Not bad not great."
"Overall - Good smooth ale. No off flavors."
"D - Cold, this is a lawnmower beer. Warmer, it's a decent sipping beer. The flavors are much more complex at 55-65 degrees. It's an OK beer, and something I'd order if there's nothing better available, but not something I'll stock in my fridge. Besides, I don't trust those clear bottles."
"If I were in the upper Midwest in the middle of February, snowed in and days away from a thaw, a fridge full of these might be just the ticket. Unremarkable, but drinkable and just enough going on to keep things a little interesting."
"An easy drinking and accessible ale, but these days I feel it lacks depth beyond that."
"This beer was very good and very light which suprised me because of it's dark brown color. I had it from one of those 5L keg cans and loved every liter of it! It was very light and smooth and was able to drink it all night long. Definitly will keep this in mind if I see it on tap. I wonder how it compares in the bottle?"
"D: This isn't terrible, but I am disappointed. I haven't had this in years, but I remember it as one of my early gateway beers. I distinctly recall it as seeming a fair step up from a Heiny. Funny that, as the skunkiness really hurts this beer. It is probably better in a can (or even a boxed in 12-pack). Still, it is decent and drinkable enough - but it is not living up to my memories."
"In a pinch this swill could be consumed, I guess."
"An underrated brew. I highly recommend it."
"Needless to say, I was disapointed in this beer."
"M/D) medium bodied beer with a smooth, non-carbonated feel in the mouth. A good choice for a session beer, but that sweetness on the aftertaste hurts the drinkability."
"Poured this Newcastle brown ale from a pint bottle into a pint glass. It pours a light brown color, very clear. It has a thick off white creamy head. The head quickly vanishes, head retention is poor. Lacing is average at best. The aroma is not very appealing, i don't smell any ""nut"" to speak of- it actually smells more like a czech pils then it does a nut brown. The body is very light and the mouthfeel is very ""watery"". This beer is very disappointing because the last time a had this(about 4 years ago I loved it, it was a staple in my fridge). I just remember it being so much better. It's amazing how much your tastes evolve. This was one of my first ""gateway beers""- I'll have to give it respect due to the fact that it put me on a path... a path to better beer- unfortunately for New Castle, I found it....Prost!"
"Dr: It's standard ABV, low price, and in dire need of attention in the mouthfeel department. Skip it. I do look forward to trying this brewery's other beers, because they seem to have some idea of what they're doing. It's really disappointing; I bet they're just catering to what customers want, and that's thin shite beer that can get them loaded."
"Poured dark brown in color with a small light brown head that dissapated rapidly. The aroma was that of sweet malts with a bready overtone. It tasted slightly bitter and watery with hardly any aftertaste. The mouthfeel was a very light and bland. Overall an average beer. Have had much better Brown Ales"
"This is a great drink. It goes down very well. Super creamy, and just a great mixture of flavors that refreshes the palate and leaves you wanting more. Its got a decent ABV allows the drinker to consume a few. Great brew"
"D: Tastes like New Castle. It is what it is. Very standard edition of the style."
"D- Easy drinker for me, goes down smooth. Good session beer for sure."
"D- There is nothing offensive here its plain. Like an amish beer, nothing fancy and showy, just a plain beer."
"D Could drink many of these, but not really sure I would want to, just an average brew - went pretty good with spicy sausage spaghetti sauce."
"Lighter medium body, higher carbonation, puckering awfulness after swallowing. I can't believe there was a time when I actually enjoyed this beer. Atrocious flavor, unattractive scent, and an overall poor experience."
"One of my first non adjunct beers, and a beer I have fond memories of. Unfortunately as my palate develops my fondness for Newcastle has not. Still, its better than many of the other readily available beers."
"One of the better beers readily available. A happy inbetween of not too filling, not too light. A skunk bottle may ruin a 1st impression of this beer. A great introductory brown beer for those who drink Bud and Miller out of habbit. Just a hint of nutty brown flavor and creaminess. At its best when it is just a little cooler than room temperature."
"Drinkability: Well If i wanted a beer and this was all they had at a party i'd more then likely drink it. The carbonation effects the drinkability because it fills you up and too much and too fast. I more then likely won't buy this again for myself but I am happy I took the time to try it."
"D-I was a bit underwhelmed by this beer, it's not that the taste was offensive or a bad beer, it was just like someone took a good brown ale and mixed it half and half with water."
"Taste is a very mild one for style. There is a slight nuttiness with a little bit of toffee. A small crispness with hops at the back. A little toasty malt can be observed in the finish. Notice everything is ""small"". A restrained beer. Drinkable, but light."
"M & D - stays with you a while. Sweet side of things. But the metallic taste is unlike any other. It is not like most nut browns. It's really it's own style. It's a good old standby- easily accessable, always dependably the same, better than most macros."
"This beer is my go to. It has a great taste and is easy to get anywhere for the reasonable price. I have had this on draught as well and its even better. If you are an ale fan this is one to try or retry. I would like to try and make my own personal brew similar to this one."
"Medium body. Good balance of nutty flavor, maltiness and bitterness. The higher level of bitterness on this brown definitely gives it more character and makes it interesting."
"D: Well balanced, but I wasn't a fan of the taste. Maybe Newcastle should try dark bottles, see what happens."
"I'll never buy or probably even accept a Newcastle again. I'm drinking it, but it is really a terrible beer."
"Pours a medium brown color with a thin off-white head and a bit of lacing as it goes down the glass. The nose brings some light toffee and caramel plus a faint bit of nuttiness. The nutty character comes through a bit more in the taste along with plenty of the toffee. Light to medium body with good carbonation. Drinks fairly well, but isn't something I'd go after with other choices available."
"Drinkability: Maybe as a closing beer after you're drunk this would be considered drinkable."
"M&D- A slightly heavy beer but not heavy. Easy to drink and quite refreshing. Slides down the throat and coats the pallet."
"D: The beer goes down very easily because it has a low alcohol content and isn't very filling, however I wouldn't consider this to be sessionable because the flavor isn't interesting enough for me to want to have more than one of these at a time."
"This is a good session beer. One of the first beers to expand the American market and I think it does a pretty good job for a beer that almost every bar/restaurant has."
"Usually drank straight from the bottle. Appearance shows a clear brown copper color. Slightly roasted nutty flavor. Flavor is nutty a bit bitter and toasted. Very simple but very well-balanced. Light body with medium carbonation. A bit watery thin. Overall: kind of boring but very seasonable and flawless."
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured reddish-brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt and nutmeg. The flavor was of roasted malt, sweet malt, nutmeg, and pecans. It had a light feel on the palate with low-mild carbonation. Overall I was not overly impressed with this brew at all (never have been). Just glad I didn't have to drink a full pint of this. This might be a good gateway brew for some people, but not for my palate at all."
"Drink is low. Why import this stuff when you can get much better locally brewed beer."
"Nice looking beer, darker amber that glistens when held up to the light. Nice amount of carbonation as seen by the bubbles making their way up to the surface. Head is pretty full, recedes down to a good covering after a few minutes. Pretty good lacing throughout. Bit of ragweed in the smell, faint floral hop aroma, some sweet malts, not much else going on here. Nice malty sweetness in the taste, a bit of grains and just a touch of roasty flavor. Slight hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is fairly light to medium, with a crisp and refreshing feel to it. Carbonation is quite high, adds a tingling effect to each sip. Quite different than what I've had on tap, more crisp and light in the mouthfeel. Overall, it's a good choice when in a pinch or at a restaurant that has a poor beer selection."
"Easily one of my favorite. Does not leave any bad aftertaste."
"Suitable for times you don't want to take notes or for social gatherings, but too sweet and one-dimensional to be a regular."
"Brown with a hint of red and no head to speak of, this smells lightly roasted but then tastes like sweet nutty malts and a kind of buttery or metallic quality. Mouthfeel is watery. Not a huge fan--I find that this is way too sweet for me to drink a lot of it quickly, and it took a long time for me to get through my glass. Won't be repeating."
"D: Very drinkable with a grilled burger."
"D - Average. This is an average import beer that I imagine would go well with multiple different types of food.. But it doesn't really shine on its own."
"D - Drinks super easy, used to not like this brew at one point, But its got a balanced malt/barley/hop thing going for it. I got gifted 15 bottles of this stuff from a neighbor coming back around, he had enough I guess? Not my pick of brew, but better that some miller/bud! FREE!"
"Overall: What happened to this brew? Has it changed that much since I used to enjoy it 10-15 years ago? Or have my tastes evolved? This was a big disappointment. I already know enough to never buy this stuff in an open sixer as the clear bottle leads to skunkiness very quickly. Thus....I bought a closed 12 pack thinking this would be, at least, a sessionable beer (from memory). Bad choice. It was hard to finish one. This will be my last memory of ""Newckie Brown""."
"Overall, a good beer to drink at a small bar that doesn't have much selection. I wouldn't pick it up at a store though. Especially with that clear glass bottle."
"Presented in a standard pint glass with a thin whisper of head. No retention or lacing. Dark amber/brown color with sharp clarity. Smell is very mild. Toasted malts and buttery toffee. Palate is balanced and pleasant. Mostly toasted malts with a kiss of earthy hops. Mouthfeel is light and fluid. Good drinkability and wide availability make this worth try, but it's a far cry from being great."
"It tastes & feels good but the smell could be better in my opinion though. Definitely give this a try, I think you'll like it."
"Big Ben draft is excellent. Very nutty, slightly sweet, but very drinkable."
"Not something to have regularly, however, in some situations I might find myself having this again."
"Overall a nice approach of a sweet beer."
"Tried this because a lot of my friends drink a lot of it. So my impression of the beer in one word is ""ehhh"". Aroma is grainy, taste is malty sweetness, a bit caramelly with an ever so slight bitterness in the end. I dont think i would want to drink a six pack of this. But i do think is a great intro to craft beer for noobs."
"tho they don't have a art/label rating i'd rank it as ""pretty cool"". I really like it. quite charming. :)"
"D: recommendable, a soild beer will order more often, wife even liked it."
"A mild and somewhat insipid brown ale. I can see why some people like it but I find it dull."
"I used to love this beer, but that was before craft beer ruined my palate. Rather watery and boring."
"D - not bad,  it's ok on tap and it's a good choice for a drink at a restaurant if there isn't anything good on the menu."
"Not a bad choice at all, but it lacks any notes that could be considered memorable"
"perfectly carbonated with that great ale finish. a GREAT beer that is readily available at most stores that sell beer. Great year round."
"D - one of my favorite brown ales could sip all night, reasonably priced for an English Brown Ale. very good at warmer temperatures aswell."
"Poured from the clear bottle. Dark medium brown color with one finger tan head quickly dissipating. Smell was toasty and roasty with a bit of sweetness. Taste was nutty and malty with only minimal hops. Mouthfeel was creamy and easy drinking. This is probably much better on tap but not so bad from the bottle either. Kind of average. More cult than substance."
"Just an all around great beer. Love it! Winter/Spring/Summer/Fall it is fantastic."
"Newcastle is truly at its best when chilled considerably. I started drinking this in bottles, but one I found out it was available for the Beertender, I immediately purchased on and began buying the mini kegs. The only complaint I have since switching to the mini kegs, is that I cannot control the temperature on my Beertender, other than that, the beer itself speaks for itself. Its the kind of beer you would expect to come from northeast England, good on a cold night, especially in the winter time you get here on the east coast."
"very refreshing, best on tap. I must admit i absolutely love Newcastle Brown Ale and there's nothing better than watching the footy with a few bottles or even a few to start the night off. It seems to have a distinct taste and is up there with the best in the market. Usually supermarkets such as Sainsburys and Asda do a deal 4 bottles for a fiver which is a good"
"D: It's a decent brown ale that isn't spectacular but isn't bad. It makes for a great session beer."
"D- Yes, its a drinkable session beer."
"Newcastle is my absolute ""go-to"" beer, that I know I can find in every supermarket and beer store nearby. I'm trying not to be too liberal with my rating on this, but it's hard to give it a low rating."
"Pours a clear medium brown color with a frothy two finger slighlty off white head. The head gives way to a decent amount of lacing. The smell is very faint there is a hint of caramel and hops. The taste is of a caramel malt backbone along with a roasted malt. There is a slight hint of woodiness/nuttiness. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and slightly creamy. The drinkability is average it is very easy to drink, but there is nothing to make you dislike this beer, but there is nothing to really make you want more. It is an average beer all around."
"Drink - A really good session beer that is worth trying. Nothing spectacular, just a good solid brew."
"Drinkability: Pretty good, low alcohol, nice."
"Drinkability: Simple and uninteresting, but not bad."
"enjoy this one all year around ."
"D - This is not a good beer. I don't know if this is an old example that is oxidized, or if this is a US version that is inferior to the original. If this is how it always tastes, I don't know how it got famous."
"Brown ales are good B grade beers. They don't have to be amazing to be great, and they can be passable even when they leave certain things to be desired. That in mind, for being from a larger brewery, this isn't half bad!"
"12 oz bottle. Pours a reddish-brown with negligible head. Aroma is very weak, mostly earthy hops. Very thin for a brown ale and very dry. Not much is going on a flavor side. I love brown ales but this one is terrible beer. I could not finish a bottle. The beer is easily available everywhere but this is the last time I try it."
"This is one of the greatest ""easy to find beers"". It is available pretty much everywhere. The first thing I notice about this brew is the amber reddish hue. The beer's smell is slightly weak, but has a strong finish, minimal head, and a smoooth taste."
"D. You can drink a lot because it is weak. Why do people rave about this beer? There are better British beers, better brown ales, and better imports; just can't wrap my head around it."
"Contains barley & wheat. Pours reddish brown clear beer with decent off-white head, aroma is rather sweet - caramel & nuts, simple andnot very strong. Mild, kvass-like taste, sweet malt + unmalted ingredients, slightly metallic hint, alcohol is being perceived excessively. Neutral mouthfeel and drinking process is not an act of delectation."
"http://abarwithnoname.wordpress.com"
"D. I could pick this up again but realistically see myself buying more budweiser than this stuff."
"Mouthfeel thin but I'm no english ale expert so it has benegit of the doubt."
"Drinkability: Based on availability, cost and tastiness, this is perfectly drinkable. You can find it everywhere, it's only a little more than macro-brewed swill-water, and it's actually got a nice, unique character."
"medium brownish color, light tan head. Light roasted scent, hints of coffee, caramel, and dry yeast. Smells good all and all and definitely makes me eager to take my first sip of it. Overly sweet, nice malty profile but has a good, balanced taste nonetheless. Mouthfeel is light and well balanced, decent amount of carbonation that is just right. This beer is very drinkable because it offers up a lot of different characteristics so it can be enjoyed at various times of the day, seasons, or occasions depending."
"Overall, this comes off as a beer that should be thicker. But still, the blend of tastes and lightness somehow works making this a very drinkable beer"
"This time from a can. Newcastle brown is the archetype for the style, a classic. Pours a nice clear hazelnut brown colour with a thin but lastin beige head. Very clean on the nose, some roastiness, maybe some metal (from the can). Easy drinking brown ale, not very tasty but it's clean and refreshing."
"Unmemorable offering of a style I usually enjoy."
"Drinkability: Well, out of the mini keg, this guy is pretty damn drinkable. It's tasty and goes down easy. Not bad at all."
"I'm glad that I only had to buy one bottle of this because I was not impressed with this and I'll probably never buy this again."
"Poured from a clear bottle into my glass. One finger head of light brown billowy bubbles. Color is a 26 on the SRM chart. Smell of coffee, toffee, malt, chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt. I taste hints of coffee, dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, some hop and malt. Every sip reveals something new, interesting. Some boldness in my mouth, but not great. Pleasing flavor, good availability, decent price. I will drink more of this in some time and place."
"D- Very drinkable. Well balanced."
"Verdict: Really good, exceptional even, for a macro brew. Always worth having around."
"I quite enjoyed this beer. It's one that I've wanted to try for a while and I finally experienced the English malty-ness that everyone talks about. It definitely is sweet, but not overbearingly so. It still stays balanced while being less focused on hops and personally I enjoyed it. I drank it straight out of a bottle, not a glass, and would do so again anytime. It'd definitely one of my favorites now. You can still session with it or drink many of them at a BBQ but they aren't light like the BMC brews, nor is it too heavy to put down in large quantities. Overall, good, more full-bodied beer than the BMC usual suspects with a sweet/malty angle on a decent, darker Euro beer."
"Pass on this one."
"D- It's 'The One and Only', so what else is there to say? I love this brew. It has relatively widespread coverage where I live and I find it very easy to drink. It is one of the best mass produced brews."
"Medium light body. Moderate carbonation. Very drinkable. Not bad for a commonly available on tap brew."
"D - Sessionable and relatively quaffable... Loaded with a bunch of flavor and character for a sub 5% brew, but nothing here really reaches out and grabs your attention... Respectable and a valid option in a pinch, but not something that I would highly recommend or revisit on a regular basis..."
"I realize that this isn't the best brown ale out there, but I had to start somewhere. Fairly standard beer across the board, very drinkable, not offensive... a good one for those who are starting with darker European styles (like myself)."
"d - An ok brown ale that is very easy going down. Have had several times and something I would gladly order over Macros at a bar."
"D: Vinous. Can't get over it..."
"I'm not too experienced in English Brown Ales, but if this is a broad representation of the style, than I certainly want to try more."
"Overall good beer that is very flexible to have with food, in a session, or just something that is a little different. Could be something to ease session drinking friends into broadening the horizons."
"Back then Broon was a very regional beer, careful marketing has made it the huge international phenomenon it is now. It may not be as great as many of the beers you'll drink but it's not a bad place to start."
"Drinkability is very good--extraordinarily sessionable, but still quite bland and uninspired."
"D-goes down easy, the taste stays, a lot of it can be consumed but still not my choice for a session drinker"
"Definitely a mainstream brew, but a good one nonetheless. Beats BMC, beats Heineken or any Mexican beer like Corona. If nothing better is around, go for it."
"Transparent brown in color with off-white head that leaves lacing. Grains, cereal, sunflower seeds in the nose. Grains, cereal, a toasted note toward the finish, vague hop bitterness but no real hop flavor. Light in body and in carbonation. A very sessionable ale that doesn't take much risk in flavor."
"Sam Smiths Nut Brown Ale its a lot more bland. Its an ok beer I do like more flavor in my beer. One good thing is if your looking for a beer to pound down all night then this would work very well."
"An okay beer. I would put this offering much higher than almost all of the American mass-produced beers, but not a name to mention amoung the top beers to try."
"Pours a ruby brown colour with head that dissipates pretty quickly without much lacing. Smells of mild nuttiness with some toasted malt. Flavour is also muted. Ok carbonation. Just an ok brown ale. I used to like this a more before I was really into beer."
"D-A popular, overrated English import. Better than anything from BMC, so it is somewhat cheery to hear non-enthusiasts refer to this as a good beer, but this can't hold a candle to Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale."
"Overall this is a decent beer."
"D This could not be improved in my opinion. It is probably one of my top 5 most drinkable beers. I do not think that is by mistake. I think that it is brewed with this in mind! 5.0"
"D- Refreshing and simple. There isn't much to this beer, which is just fine. But it didn't do anything to excite me either."
"38 out of 50. Sounds about right. This beer is in the style guidelines after all."
"This is easily my favorite beer in the world. I love me some Newcastle Brown Ale. I could seriously drink it all day!!! Probably the easiest to drink and enjoy that I've ever had. It's just simply and amazing beer to drink. I would without a doubt recommend this one to anyone."
"D - Seriously, this IS A SESSION BEER!"
"Good example of how a beer doesn't have to be complex to be quite enjoyable."
"To quote Monty Burns, ""I know what I hate, and I don't hate this."" Definitely preferable to the bottle form, Newcastle is a drinkable, but very predictable brown ale. Overly sweet, a bit flat, but I can soldier through it. Way better than most Diageo-BMC stuff on tap around here, but the high import pricetag drives me away. If you can find it cheap in a can, it's not bad. Just don't pay too much for it - there's far better brown ales available."
"Pours a modest head which dissipates quickly. Brown. Very mild and a touch sweet. I once read a reviewer say that people have strong opinions on this beer and I'd agree - I'm strongly disliking it. Boring, except for the Russian roulette mystery of will it be skunked or not."
"Overall, not worth the premium import price. I would only drink this at a bar with a limited beer selection."
"D- look, it's a brown ale made for the masses. Smooth flavor allows this to be slammed though"
"All in all, it's not too bad, mainly due to the roasty character and hoppyness."
"It is only opinions of other beers that led to my experience of this terrible tasting and thick beer. Just not my style in any way."
"Drinkability: Overall an ok taste, they go down pretty easy."
"My wife loves this beer and was kind enough to let me ""borrow"" this one for a taste test hehe. The oddly 1 pint 2.6 FL oz bottle... not up to date on my conversions though I think it would be a British pint? Smells a bit skunked though I've encountered it before from this bottle size. Nutty, sweet roasted taste. Thin but very enjoyable. A deffinately keeper. I give thanks to my wonderful wife."
"RJT"
"D - Very drinkable, once again thanks to the sweetness and light carbonation. Not an offensive beer by any means, but does not have the same feel as other Brown Ales that I have had in the past."
"Taste is Meh. It's sweet and malty with no hops at all. It's pretty drinkable bit it's got a bit of a band aid taste that's sweet and funky. Ok beer but not great."
"This beer always seems to be hit or miss for me. Sometimes, it tastes delicious and full (a classic brown ale), while other times it just seems bland and blah. I'm wondering, per the review below, whether the mass production has affected things. Admittedly, my review is from the bottle, so I would like to taste it on tap and revisit."
"D-Relatively good drinkability if you enjoy the style.Not alot to look for or think about with this one."
"D: Newcastle is a beer that really varies for me; some nights it is really good and others it is shit. Tonight was really good and very drinkable, but I always hesitate to order one. Such a finicky beer when shipped overseas"
"Good ale. Tastes best out of a pint glass excellent laceing. Not overly carbonated makes for easy drinkability. You can govern how much head by how fast you pour it. The head stays around for a good long time. This ale would be good with a meal or just to get drunk on either way I recomend it."
"Can. Pours a mahogany brown color with a tan head. The aroma is fairly nondescript with hints of sweet malt. The taste is slightly sweet and reminds me of apples for some reason. Medium mouthfeel. Used to like this beer prior to getting into craft but since experiencing more beers, this one really doesn't appeal to me anymore."
"Overall I enjoyed this beer."
"Well I didn't pour it from the bottle so the apperance is what I seen through the bottle which is surley brown almost like a flat diet coke. The smell was nice but the one I that I had was quite skunky not sure if it should smell that way or not. It has a nice taste through the skunk you taste lots of malts like caramel notes or something sweet. The mouthfeel is nice it is very light on the palate which gives it a nice smooth drinkability!"
"Not a risky beer, i think this one would appeal to almost everyone. I remember it being slightly sweet compared to most, with light carbonation and a crisp taste. I always enjoy having 1 or 2 of these, but it's not the type of drink that you want to have all the time or several in a row of"
"A dark brown ale with a very creamy white head that smothers the glass in lace. Smells of grain and hay. It has a creamy and nutty taste with some sweets malt back end. Goes down like a glass of milk, very smooth and coating. This is thirst quenching and delicious. Solid overall."
"This review is for the Newcastle mini keg. This is the way to drink and enjoy a Newkie. Had a BBQ today and three of us put away a mini-keg with ease. Enjoyed every drop! The beer was fresh, creamy and very tasty. If you have only had this brew in a bottle, do yourself a favor and try a draft or mini keg. Great stuff!"
"A descent brown ale, but nothing to brag about. Keep it as a beer for parties because it is drinkable and fairly affordable."
"T: Nice taste, some bitterness at the end mix with the roast, there is no ending at all, would be better with a heavier body"
"D Good for a few. Not a bad as some would want you to beleive."
"M: Refreshing and pleasant at the beginning changing fast to a bitter hops ending."
"Poured chestnut brown, with less than a finger of off-white head, poor retention, and average lacing. Maple syrup, brown sugar, and milk chocolate were all evident in the nose. The taste revealed the same, mixed with an earthy hop backdrop, and finishing on a somewhat earthy note. Very thin, and modestly carbonated. A little too thin for me, but there's no denying that one could certainly session this brew."
"Medium light body with light carbonation is easy to quaff in quantity, which is perhaps the only reason to buy this brew?"
"Poured into a pint glass an amber brown with a two finger hollow head. Fairly good amount of lacing. Sweet fig tree smell. Roasted hazelnut taste with caramel overtones. A lighter bodied brown ale than I usually enjoy, if you can really call this a brown ale at all. All in all it is still a pretty decent beer and is reasonably priced most of the time. Definitely a year-round session brew. I keep finding myself coming back to this beer every few months if I'm somewhere with a not so good selection. It's an ok beer to fall back on."
"D/M: Nice beer, not too carbonated easy to drink. To be honest I really like there marketing campaign. Its what really drew me to try this beer."
" Bit pricey considering its low ABV, Im used to a bit stronger."
"What a great beer. Appearance is exceptional. Doesn't look like a beer per se. Smell of wonderul hops and the head isn't bad on this beer either. Taste of hops, but not too strong. It doesn't taste like you are drinking beer, but it is crisp and clean with a smooth taste. Mouthful, can't have too much of it your mouth, it will ruin the taste. Drinkabilty is good, but more than 2 the taste will grow a little old"
"Drinkability - Good solid ale, not too much on the palate. Easy to come back to for more."
"D: Decent cheap beer. Don't know why the bottles are clear, but whatever. Good with food or as a drinkin' beer. No exceptional quality here though."
"Since Newcastle has to be shipped to the Heineken plant and kegged there, I wonder if its economical to make beer in England, ship it to the Netherlands and then repackaged for Cali or in my case AZ."
"D: I'm still not a fan. The metallic, soapy notes in the flavor are enough to keep me away in the future. It's boring in general though."
"I think this is 1 of the most underrated beers on here. It is lighter than other Brown Ales we are used to...especially American Browns. But It is a great ""go to"" beer when pickings are slim, and is readily available. Not so sure about the clear bottle, though. I have had some skunky ones. But this one I'm rating was on tap at Buffalo Wild Wings in Ashtabula Ohio. 23 oz. of lightly roasted malt, nutty, and maybe a slight dry hop finish. not great body, but just a good solid drinking beer."
"Even though this is not a gourmet, this is the beer that opened my eyes to gourmet beers. This may not be the greatest beer in the world but it is very drinkable. It pours with little head, and dark copper appearance. Slightly sour smell, but with clean taste yet little watery. This is my first post, I know it's not the best, but, I am learning a lot. Hopefully I will be hearing a lot from everyone and vice versa."
"When first trying beer, Newcastle was my ""Great-Awakening"". It is still a personal favorite and will always have a place in my heart. I personally love the smell and the mouthfeel. It's not a great food pairing beer, in my opinion, but it makes a great beer to relax with in front of the television."
"I find Newcastle to be an average beer in most respects. It's my ""go-to"" beer if the only alternatives are macro lagers like Bud, Coors, etc. The appearance is pleasant, a light brown cola-like beer, with a modest head and carbonation. Mild, slightly sweet aroma and flavor, a bit of maltiness. Definitely could be a session beer, I prefer the flavor to a lager, yet it doesn't have a higher alcohol content like a stout. I didn't notice any skunkiness I was warned about because of the clear bottle, and prefer beers from the bottle over canned versions. I've also had this on tap and didn't notice much difference."
"It's very drinkable, but lacking in many departments. One of the worst English ales that I have tasted."
"D - This is the type of beer you drink when you need to be refreshed and cooled off. A ""no-brainer"" or something you don't have to think about."
"in conclusion its mild flavor is a good beginner beer for you friends that aren't used to craft."
"Not impossible to drink, but not that pleasant either, however I do like the slight coffee taste. I wouldn't plan on drinking a lot this type of beer."
"This is a very drinkable beer where the whole is better than the sum of the parts. Pouring from the bottle into a pint glass, the head quickly dissipates and the beer has the appearance of cola, which might be off-putting for some beers but didn't bother me with Newcastle. There wasn't much distinctive to note in the aroma. Dark malt and caramel flavors dominate, which together with a light body and more carbonation than one would expect from a brown ale, combine for a refreshing beer. I've found Newcastle is a good hot weather session beer when I am avoiding Corona, Red Stripe and the like."
"D - A go-to when I don't want something overpowering and just want to enjoy a few beers."
"D- Not a favorite of mine by any means. I guess I'd say ok at best and would look for something else to drink."
"I agree with one of the other reviewers, it was better when I first had it in a pub in England."
"M & D: Very good, sits well and fairly easy to drink once you get the first one down"
"Drinkability- Given its ingredients, it's not really a true Brown Ale; however, it's good enough to knock back one or two."
"D-Despite this beer just being average, its drinkability to me is through the roof. I could easily drink this for hours. It was one of the first beers I really liked and it has a fond place in my heart."
"D: Pretty easy to drink. but over all its not that great. not much to it. a little of a let down. for a beer that all my friends say is a good one. i would have expected more from. i would buy it again. but its real low on my list."
"D - Easy drinker, not hard to get down."
"newcastle offers an interesting flavor with moderate drinkability.. making it a nice choice now and then .. and luckily it is widely available.. the smell is a little off-putting.. from the bottle - on tap i would imagine it is much better.. there are some nice sweet caramel malt notes.. the taste is typical brown ale bliss.. sweet a little bitter/crisp on the finish.. for such a common beer to get ahold of it has an interesting palette.. It is on the light side for an ale.. but that is not always a bad thing.. this is a good introductory brown ale."
"D - this is my favorite session beer. i can drink them all night long"
"I really liked this beer so much in England I brought a 12 pack back with me to the States. Once in the states it has never been as good as in England, but still very drinkable. I have also noticed a difference in batches. Some batches are very tastey, and others seem watered down. Too bad because when you get a good batch this is a very good beer."
"The mouthfeel is fairly thin, but closer to a medium body and a relatively high amount of carbonation. Fairly easy to drink, but not something I'll buy again. On vacation and had a limited selection, so I figured I'd give it a try."
"cheers!"
"D- I could drink this beer trough the evening, it's a little heavy but not that bad where you can only drink a few, with that said it is a very drinkable beer, so hats off to my fellow Brown Ale friends and family."
"D: The sweetness would keep me at a half pint."
"On the reddish side of brown and never has much of a head. The smell is slightly sweet and immediately makes me think of malt, and then there's faint spice somewhere. Tastes malty as expected and a bit nutty, with a good balance. Body is between medium and substantial. If not for the small metallic undertone this would be very pleasant. Newcastle seems to skunk very easily especially from a tap at bars, which is unfortunate, since it is a decent choice among widely available beers, and goes well with food."
"Pretty drinkable. Not a superstar but for what it is, worth a try and not disappointing."
"Drinkability is not bad. Newcastle is quite simply a pretty tasty and easy to drink brew. Fills a niche quite nicely."
"I see people ask for this and I can only think: ""The power of marketing."""
"D-I never would have bought this on my own, but a friend brought this over to a picnic so I gave it a try. Have not had one in years, and I probably don't need to have one again for a long while. Said friend poured out a finely crafted IPA to quaff this when it arrived and I was a bit horrified, but I can't fault people for their taste...this one just isn't mine."
"D - Pretty high. Could, and have, drank several of these in one session when nothing better is available. That said, I wouldn't buy it in bottles, given that it costs about the same as much better micros."
"Drinkability: An average English brown that I am not a fan of. I would buy several others in the style first. Not overly complex and a little too grainy, I will pass."
"Over all I'm glad I only paid $3.99 for a six pack of this."
"Sweet malt, mild caramel, toasty in the back end and ends up drying but not bitter. It lacks the complexity I prefer, and the mouthfeel is thin, too highly carbonated, and overall not particularly memorable. Still, it'll do in a pinch."
"Drinkability - I like it alot for a session. Goes down easy and the sweetness is a nice addition to salty snacks."
"With low ABV and a light flavor, it's pretty drinkable, but I would love to try a better representation of the style."
"Drinkability was better than most BMC, but I'm not likely to reorder unless there was nothing else but BMC to order."
"I'm into craft beer and I really wanted to give this one a try. Good, but not great. Would order it again, but nothing to go out of your way for."
"D - A decent session beer however I like a little more flavor in my beers but still a good beer"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Good flavor and worth the money to upgrade from a macro."
"D - way easy to drink."
"D - Not a bad drop, relatively easy to drink. A better example of the brown ale style, but hardly the pinnacle."
"The color is really nice, and the taste is good enough, but I prefer a lot of other beers out there. That's probably the best I can say about it, it's good enough."
"I would compare this to Bass Ale with Newcastle having a slight edge. Overall I think this beer would appeal to the majority of beer drinkers."
"D-Very easy to drink, and enjoy."
"D--This is a real easy drinker. Straightforward, solid, and reliable. It may not be anything special, but it more than adequately does the job."
"Drinkability is great when cold, but the bitterness peaks when the beer gets warm, so imbibe cold. The ABV% is nice on this one too."
"D- I can see myself drinking a couple of these but not too much more than that. Overall is a nice beer with a full taste."
"hey what can I say this was a good excuse to use my Newcastle glass, an Industry standard and it's easy to find wherever you go. I've found myself drinking this over our Canadian macros when I have no other alternative in many of our lame bars around Calgary"
"The taste is slightly watery with a sweet roasted barley backbone. Nothing to write home about, but a pleasant and easy-drinking brew just a tad stronger than an English mild. Slightly thin bodied."
"- Just as good as I remembered it... and always worthy of a drink. Smooth, tasty... get it."
"Pours a true translucent brown color, some reddish highlights and a sturdy lasting brown head. Smells of nutty brown malts and a fruity yeast strain. Smooth, simple and malt forward with very little bitterness, a little nutty and a large yeast note. A go to for me while at hockey games, a solid brown ale time after time."
"Overall: Extremely disappointed by this due to the multiple rave reviews friends gave me. Would be better if a bit stronger."
"The malt gets me first, its the sweetness up front followed by what I imagine is some kind of woody nut but its not great. No aftertaste to speak of, not a lot of bitterness to mention, carbonation on the palate is low, its perfectly drinkable, its just boring and pointless."
"This something I will pick up when on sale for a $1 a bottle. Not a beer I crave but will order when selections are limited."
"Notes: Like I said with the drinkability, the whole beer hits me differently from time to time. However, I will say that I have a soft spot for this beer. It was one of the first beers I can remember drinking a few of."
"Taste is much like the nose, but overwhelming nutty and malty, without as much of the sweetness that would give this some balance. Definitely earthy, particularly in the mouthfeel, and the brew is somewhat drinkable, particularly with its lower ABV."
"Drinkability - For all of the cues pointing to extraordinary taste such as the aroma and rich appearance it drinks surprisingly...regular. Its not bad at all and the low bitterness character appeals to me, but there is nothing in the taste that gives any lasting impression. Its definitely drinkable though, if slightly boring."
"Drinkability: Something you might want after working in the yard to quench your thirst."
"One of my favorite beers - pours nicely but with a reddish brown color, not quite brown. The distinctive odor in no way effects the taste, which is bold but nothing to write home about. I enjoy keeping these stocked in my fridge and drinking them COLD!"
"D - A very nice brown ale that delivers in the malt and nut flavors but Turbo Dog is still my nut brown of choice."
"D: great brown ale if your looking for a great session ale that doesnt overwhelm your palet"
"Thin head, barely half a finger of creamy white foam, mostly larger bubbles leading to a quick dissipation, minimal lacing. Strong orange tinge lightens the brown base, consistent hue largely caused by overall transparency, few bubbles to be seen. The nose is semi-light with sodabread, scone, caramel and orange peel most noticeable, has a minerally patina, ends with a burst of green hay and straw, if it can said to have a ""burst"" of anything. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is flat enough to keep the liquid layered on the tongue like sunscreen before you shower. Watery as in mineral water, cleansing but without richness of flavor. The caramel and toffee actually diminish as it warms. Hint of white raisin or apricot fruit with blanched nuts. Again, not much flavor left by the finish, just metallic astringency and pucker. Nothing horrible but it is amazing how you can outgrow brews like this."
"D: not a bad session beer. Has some decent flavors with a very light body.. no depth or complexity though"
"Real easy to drink in it's simplicity. A classic light brown ale that is very enjoyable on tap, but just OK out of the bottle. This is a great fall back beer at any bar that only has mass produced beers, and this beer could very well be categorized as a macro-brew, but after 20 years I still enjoy a Newcastle Brown Ale."
"It is tough to review a beer you have had so many times, because I think you are biases for or against it. This isn't a bad beer, it's pretty average if you ask me, dark color makes it seem like it would have more flavor, but is actually pretty plain and non-descript if you ask me. There isn't much of anything that stands out about it except for the label and brown color. I never really buy or order it anymore because I've had it so many times, but for an import in the US the price is right."
"I like the mildness of this beer nothing is especially overpowering. The malty sweet flavor when it is in your mouth is not washed away by an overly bitter after taste. It is not a heavy feeling beer in your mouth, has a slight nutty smell to it. I was very happy when my favorite bar got this on tap, as it seemed like the bottled version was somewhat more bitter."
"Notes: Seems like an easy to drink inoffensive beer that is made for mass consumption. Average beer that may be a good stepping stone to craft beer."
"Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, sweet, and easy drinking. Mild zing up front leading to a ""rye bread"" like finish."
"This is one of those beers that fall under the category of ""If it smells bad, it tastes good."" At first sniff, this was a no go, but after I took my first sip, it was wonderful. A strong taste for an ale with an attractive appearance. Recommended if you like the Britons."
"Value: Available in grocery stores and even some gas stations but at a pretty steep price for what it is."
"When fresh, this is a great session brew. I could, and have, easily knock back several of these."
"Mouthfeel, too simplistic to enjoy. Drinkability, too expensive to be drinkable. For some reason, the thought of it makes me feel sicker than actually drinking the beer does. Its like once you get going, you know you're gonna make it, but beforehand, you kind of have this gag reflex nerves thing acting up."
"Cheers!"
"I would say this is the beer that kind of opened the door for me. Once again in a bottle, I don't find it to be terrible, in fact I find it awesome. I enjoy the dark brown color and malty scent. The taste has little to no hops. It's a nutty, chocolate, caramel flavor. Has a smooth taste, that goes down clean. Definitely a session beer."
"Overall, a bit of a letdown, but certainly easy to drink, sessionable."
"A true classic all-around."
"D: Very drinkable. Given the low ABV I am sure you could have several of these. I really enjoyed this beer. It was a very pleasant surprise over the bottled version. If you want to drink this beer make sure you get the draft version."
"Also, sometimes the brew exhibited a poor aftertaste."
"Overall, I was disappointed with Newcastle Brown Ale. I was expecting something with more flavor, but this came up rather bland. At best, it's average. I will say, however, that I'd be willing to try this again, but it'd have to be from a can or on tap - a bottle is not the way to go."
"Drinkability: It fills you up, but not in a bad way. I didn't feel like I needed to take a nap after 2 of these and a big sandwich."
"D - Refreshing. Easy on the alcohol. The bitter aftertaste would grow tiresome and keep me from drinking too many. Of course, I served this at wine cellar temperature (55-60), which might have been too warm."
"I will drink the rest of these but I wouldn't ever get them myself."
"i need to get something off my chest. This beer is so frieken horrendous, simply because i belive its to outlandish and sickening. Sure others might like it, and i can understand why, its not bland or anything like that. By far the worst feature of this beer is the smell and taste, and i dare any of you to drink this in large numbers. I ussually like beers with hints of coffee and chocolate but somehow they have managed to repulse me. Thanks for reading and publishing my review."
"Of the few brown ales I have tried, this one is the sweetest I have had. Nice brown color, small head that all but disappears quickly. Smells sweet, and the taste that goes with it is a kind of burnt toffee flavor. Comes in a clear bottle, so proper storage is a must."
"D: The light texture makes it easier to drink than other darker beers, but it feels heavier going down and the candy flavor gets sickly sweet. For the overall effect, something lighter would allow for drinking more beer and greater drunkenness, something heavier would allow for complexity and greater enjoyment"
"Nice brown color with little head. Smells like candy to me, really sweet aroma. The taste is pretty much the same, pretty sweet, we can also taste a little candy... Goes down easily but I am not a big fan of this beer afterall."
"I believe the beer I had was light struck because of a slight spunkiness. The bottle being clear glass does not help matters. If I was to try this beer again I would get it in a can or from a tap. The look of the beer was expectedly brown and clear. The taste was more defined by the malt than the hops. Served cold this beer is drinkable."
"D: Very well balanced. These go down smooth and quick. I don't prefer them, but Newkies provide a good startpoint for anyone wanting to explore English Browns."
"Poured a light brown, thin, no head, just flat as can be..not impressed. Nose is caramel, toffe and thats about it. Taste is nutty, toffee, caramel, light sweetness and crisp hop. No booze at all. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth and creamy. Drinkability is good as well. This beer can be consumed all day and is always a go to when there is nothing else around."
"D: Goes down smooth, could drink these all night."
"D- Goes down smooth. Sessionable, but the weak flavor could be a turn-off on the right/wrong day. Overall though, I would still take this over a macro lager any day."
"Not a bad beer at all, especially for beers that I would tend to lump with Newcastle (not by style, but by availability, relative popularity among non-beer drinkers, like Stella or something of the sort). Smell is relatively non-existent, a bit of brown ale maltiness, some metallic twinge too. Taste isn't terrible, some raisin notes, bready notes, slightly roasted malt, and maybe a few off-flavors. MF is thin, though not over-carbonated like most macros. Drinkability is high in that it goes down easily, though not the most interesting beer in the world."
"I have had this beer both out of a bottle and on tap at a local restaurant, being impressed every time. I do have a soft spot in my heart for heavier beers thats drinkability is exceptional but this beer conquers it all. I'll take one of these over almost any beer I have ever laid eyes on. very very exceptional"
"D -- Well, it's certainly not offensive and goes down easily, though I was hoping for more character. Goose Island's Nut Brown and Wychwood's Hobgoblin are much better to style."
"This is drinkable, but average. You could certainly drink plenty, but I doubt you can't find something better. The good news is that, like the bottle, it improves quite a bit on tap. In fact, I would suggest that this only be drunk from the tap."
"D - Definitely drinkable."
"D: sooo smooth, especially nice with my Powers."
"D: After smell the aroma, the taste disappointed me a little, homever is tasty."
"Flavor is somewhat bitter throughout and when it comes to personal opinion I would prefer more of a malt taste in a beer."
"D - Fine for a free beer, and that's why I choose it. It's easy to find all over Vegas and tastes way better than Heiny"
"Speaking of that, is this really an ale? The beer looks way too clear to be an ale?"
"D: I used to enjoy this beer, but I'm no longer sure why. It's alright in the flavor department, but nothing spectacular and the nose is quite off-putting."
"D: There is nothing too disagreeable about this beer, it is just so-so in every way pretty much. It's a nice smooth beer but I wouldn't go out of my way to have more of it. The only time I have this stuff is when someone else has it around; I'm not one to turn down free beer."
"D: This is an easy drinking brown; not the best representation of the style but okay"
"I don't really know what Brits think about it, but I suppose its like any other beer in the world-it all comes down to personal preference. Personally, I like this stuff."
"this beer is such a cult classic, and I have no idea why. I dislike everything about this beer, pretty much. maybe not the trivia and facts they put on the bottle, but as for the beer itself, well, it blows hard. the first english brown I had was sam smith's, and I have never gone back. having this presented as a brown ale is laughable. the only beer i dislike more is probably boddingtons. the body was not dark enough, there was head (minimal), the nose was corny with a touch of something else, the taste was lacking the most fundamental supports for the style, the onlything I could taste was a watered down biscuit/malt flavour. this is just a beer I tend to avoid when i see it at gallery openings, i'll take highlife, at least that one is being honest about how bad it is."
"D- Overall, a very drinkable ale. Its light body, low ABV, and its not over bearing flavor make it very easy on all systems."
"* Damn, what the hell happened? This was the first ""real"" beer I ever had, the beer that started my love of brew; now, wtf? This beer sucks!"
"*Side Note: Newcastle needs to stop using clear bottles! I had to go through alot of bad bottles that have been light struck or skunked to finally find a good one!"
"Very little head develops and what does develop does not last but a few seconds. Color is dark brown, kinda what you would expect from a brown ale. Flavor is overly watery and the taste is mildly nutty with subtle hints of caramel and syrup. This beer rides right in the middle of mediocre."
"Not the best, but defiantly one of my favorites!"
"Conclusion: This was one of my ""gateway"" beers and I loved it back in the day. Today, years later, I'm not sure how I feel about it. It's not bad, but somehow the dry, fruity, and bitter elements just don't quite work together."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Drinkability: Some people love this brew, and some people certainly don't. I do happen to like it, but mostly in those occasions where it's the only decent thing on tap (among the BMC and more popular domestics), or if it's the only thing decent at a gas station that I wouldn't mind sipping on if they're not going the craft or micro route (because even if not, they usually have Newcastle)."
"light bodied and watery. it's easily sippable, but i have a hard time getting through it due to that strange taste and sugary sweetness. it's not horrible, but it's not really that goood either."
"Drinkability is above average, but not as good as it would be for a beer that actually has a good flavor."
"Drinkability: This is the classic English brown ale for a reason. It is light and refreshing and very tasty."
"Mouthfeel/Drink: Nice carbonation, smooth to drink. May be better drink at a lower serve temperature."
"Overall, I was suprised by how much I liked Newcastle. It had been awhile since the last time I consumed one and was really impressed by the taste (maybe it was a nice change of pace from all the hopped up craft beers I have been drinking). The drinkability on it is pretty average becasue of its heaviness, but I would definitely suggesting trying it again if not for the first time."
"Nice brown ale, light carbonation. It does have a good taste and I have found myself having more than a few in a night. But again, nothing spectacular. So when I go to buy some beer, I usually won't be coming out with Newcastle because I can expect someone else to always have some and I can grab one off of them without spending the cash on it."
"Liquid is really easy on the tongue and the subtle scotch flavor at the end feels good going down. Lacks the body that most of its type have, but is really easy to enjoy and it's seriously one of the most drinkable brews on the planet."
"Drinkability> Easy, but the smell is rather offensive."
"Drinkability: Its very drinkable for sure, with its non-palate killing flavour, creaminess, and its low abv. But would I really want to drink a ton of this? Hard to say, but probably not. Certainly not after tasting anything bolder"
"Served in a pint glass it has a small head that leaves lots of lacing. The color is amber and clear. The aroma is of sweet roasted malt with spicy hop accents. The taste is mainly of malt with a little bitterness. The feel is a little on the thin side with moderate carbonation. It's very drinkable; one could knock a few of these back for an enjoyable evening."
"Notes: I was enamored with this beer for a short while when I was first starting to become interested in beer. I know now that it's not the end all and be all for English Brown Ales. However, as a cult classic of sorts, it could be a lot worse."
"O: Not my beer of choice, but gets it done in a pinch."
"This was a pretty good beer. Pours a nice even brown that allows light to glisten through and glow on it. Head is persistantly thin and pale. Taste is nutty, creamy, hoppy, sharp, swanky and smooth. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth and creamy. Drinkability is good as well."
"Despite me slamming this beer here, it's actually a drinkable session Brown Ale. It's better than an adjunct Lager, but it's not as good as a well made craft beer. Be careful when purchasing this beer because it comes in a clear bottle. There's nothing stopping the light from affecting your newly purchased six pack."
"Cheers!"
"The feel of this beer is pretty light and really goes down well. It is one of the best brown ales I have tried and it a really session beer."
"Maybe I just have to drink it more often, there's a huge difference between the standard German beer and this one."
"D - Sigh. It's a never-ending battle with euro-beers in clear and green bottles. Constant fear that they're' bad and my paranoia surfaces once again with this beer. Can I ever get one I'm confident will be good? It'd drinkable but only moderately so."
"Drinkability- Decent, not a light beer but not too boozy. I could definitely go for another glass."
"Smell of light malt, the first sip was the same as the smell, mostly malt. I did notice a light mouthfeel and the distinctive English Ale bitterness, slightly less than most other English Ales."
"My evaluation might be somewhat clouded by my long affair with Dog. When I was a lad in Central Virginia (20 years ago), it was one of the few British imports readily available throughout the region. It pours unimpressively: thin lacing. It tastes like just about any other macro English brown ale out there (I prefer Scotch ales--and Scotch whisky--I'm a Celt dude, don't jones me): moderately malty. Mouthfeel is nice and solid, not too far either way. It cannot be damned, nor can it be highly praised, but it is better than most American macros, has a cool history, and is pretty inexpensive. I'll go finish the six, now."
"D: Nice and smooth. The aromas leave something to be desired and the taste is rather plain, but what's there is good. This is a nice refreshing beer and I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these on a hot summer day. Not my favorite, but definitely a respectable brew."
"poured from a clear bottle it color was a cllear light brown lighter and clearer than most browns ive had.the smell was light some malt caramel and breads..the taste was the same not alot of flavor in this one the malt was light tasted very little hops..this is just an average brew just not alot going on in this brown..not recommended.so many other browns out their to have from ..bells DFH.big sky surly"
"It has a nice color. They go out of their way to show you this by putting it in clear bottles. Not much of a smell. Compared to other brown ales i have had, there is not much taste or flavor. People who aren't really into craft beer, would still enjoy a few."
"Ordered at a restaurant and poured into a fluted pilsner glass. Very dark brown body with a reddish rue and a tan head that didn't last very long. Aroma of clean malt and a slight skunked smell. Mouthfeel was rather thin with a low amount of sweetness and clean finish. This beer is easily quaffable, but lacks in the flavor department."
"A pretty drinkable brown ale, but nothing too special. It's likable because it's a solid beer."
"This is my go to beer when I just don't know what I want. I can always count on having this in the fridge as the price is right and it seems to fit many audiences (weak to strong, light to dark, cold to warm; it works for almost everyone). A very nice middle ground."
"Poured from a clear 12oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is slightly sweet, some malts. Taste is refreshing, sweet malts with a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and goes down with ease. Overall this is a quality beer."
"I really liked this beer, but I think you'd need to to spice it up by drinking other things, could see it becoming plain after awhile."
"Mouthfeel - full bodied - heavier than most with a syrupy feel. Smooth with little courseness. Low carbonation like a mild ale should."
"Had from bottle many many many times, thought it would be nice to review this one. medium to light brown in color, hedge on the medium side. Smells sweet and somewhat caramely. Taste is pronounced malt flavor with a hint of ""nut."" Pretty light in body all things considered. An excellent go-to beer."
"This beer is pretty mild and it feels like Newcastle just wanted to make a marketable and drinkable brown ale. There is no dominant flavor and this beer is subpar."
"Nice foam, aromas seemed tight, not getting anything interesting. Initial flavors somewhat sweet/malty, but had no finish, seemed over carbonated. Better than mass market beers but not in the craft beer league. It did get better the warmer it got. Forget the price but probably wouldn't get again."
"Drinkability: It's not a fantastic or memorable beer in anyway but very easy to drink and is a nice substitute to heavier beers."
"I will pick this up again and give her a gentle pour."
"Drinkability: Goes down very easy, however not much flavor, and that strange sweetness so I wouldn't want to have another one really"
"I consider this one a classic even though it isn't the most complex or flavorful brown ale. It pours from the bottle with a deep reddish-amber color and gives a creamy white head. There isn't much in the way of aroma, but the taste is smooth but not creamy, sweet but not sugary. The caramel flavor of the malts is nice but a bit one-dimensional. Overall, this is a good, easy-drinking brown that isn't full of flavor but satisfies nonetheless."
"Taste: Very crisp and clean for an ale. Could use a little more sweetness in my opinion. If it wasn't for the little bit of skunkiness this would have been a thuroughly enjoyable bottle of beer."
"Cheers!"
"Only ordered it because it was the best choice at the pub I was at...."
"Overall, the beer is smooth, but fairly simple taste wise. A decent drink, but not something to go out of your way for."
"Smell and taste for me isn't awesome.. It's ok I guess. probably wont be something that I'll stock in the fridge."
"D- Super easy session brew."
"I like beer. this beer is different. it's ok wien not ice cold. but when it is it is exeptional... smoth, easy to drink and ttasty. but Newcastle Brown Ale has a bitter after taste. I just wanna drink another and smoke a cig or go Crest my teeth. I guess it is late. overall good. Not bad."
"Not a bad beer nor a great beer. Has a medium brown appearance with a white head of foam. Has a smell of malts and sulfur which is much less then pleasant. Taste is sort of sweet but lack much other flavor and finishes almost like mineral water. The beer is really carbonated. Drinkability is ok, not a turnoff but not great either."
"d. but of course i'll drink it again, 'tis a great beer."
"The body is a couple steps from being full, but is still smooth easy on the tongue. Drinkability is superb, having several while at the pub with your mates is not a chore. Overall, this smooth and easy classic is the standard for the style."
"(Review from tasting notes dated 12 Aug 2009)"
"Drinkability- Well it's drinkable, for sure. Certainly much nicer on draft than in the bottle and a good staple beer to have if that's the best thing offered at any particular bar or restaurant (which is often the case at a local dive). Nothing too exciting though but decent."
"D- Definitely drinkable... but I am not going to go out of my way for this one, If I saw it again and there was nothing better I'm sure I'd have another go at it especially if it is on tap."
"Brown color with hints of red and a small head with poor retention. Not a lot of aroma. Some bitterness at first, followed by some sweetness as the beer warmed. Not a lot of flavor,some malt and hops, but neither were very assertive. Same as with the aroma. The drinkability and mouthfeel are decent, nothing to get too excited about."
"Reddish brown in color, in a clear bottle so you get what you see. Fair head that doesn't last, but leaves a collar while beer lasts. Not very aromatic. Had a crisp, medicinal taste. Slightly malty as an aftertaste. Good carbonation that leaves a little bite at the front of the tongue. Very drinkable, a poor man's Speckled Hen in taste."
"Drinkability: A very good beer. It's smooth and refreshing. It would work well with or without food, on a warm or cool day. Something I could definitely drink again."
"It's not as bad as my review sounds as it's a drinkable session beer. It's certainly better than the most popular beers in America (BMC), but not nearly as good as most micro brown ales."
"Drinkabilty - This was nothing to write home about. I would drink it again if offered to me, don't think I would buy it but would defiantly prefer this over any one of the ""Big 3"". Goes down somewhat smooth. All in all, while it wasn't great, it certainly wasn't bad."
"Average in every way. No head, but decent enough taste. I only drank this because a friend of Newcastle gave it to me. Would like to try it on tap, it might spice up the flavor a bit. Not something I could drink for long, though a couple won't hurt."
"D: A smooth, well balanced beer that's refreshing - I'll buy it again!"
"Drinkabilty - Very easy to drink, this beer IMO has the balance between flavour and mildness perfectly."
"I know it may seem sacrilegious to some, but mixing this beer in a glass with an IPA that lacks a sufficient malt backbone is a tasty combo to me and if I should ever happen to purchase a pack of this ale again I imagine that I will mix it again."
"Between light and medium bodied with fairly low carbonation. Not the best English Brown, but still easy to put away."
"I quite like Newcastle Brown Ale. It is a good beer, not a great one, very easy to drink, and something you can enjoy without thinking about it too deeply."
"this is a pretty good beer. it was given to me by a friend who moved (thanks meredith!) and i don't refuse free beer. I think the more i've drank the more its grown on me, but overall i don't really like this beer. somethign in the flavor just doesn't taste very good to me, i guess the malty, roasty flavors. I personally would love to have this on tap and a little fresher and see how much better it is. I think it being an import and in clear glass it could be alot better than how i got it. but for my bottle review i say its just ok."
"Overall- This is my first Newcastle from a can. While there have been many great brown ales since then, Newcastle will hold a special place due to it being one of the ""gateway beers"" that piqued my interest in drinking better beer. It doesn't blow me away that I ""have to have it," but it's one of those beers that still has it's time and place."
"D - Goes down easy, but it is rather high on the sweet side."
"This is a hands down winner for me in drinkabilty. I've settled down over a 12 pack of this and next thing you know I've got 12 empty bottles."
"Not the best, but totally respectable. Good brew. My only gripe is this beer seems to skunk easy. Not sure if it's the importation or the crappy vendors, but I've come across a couple skunked 6ers in my time."
"Pours a clear reddish brown with a thin tan head. Smell is vaguely of malt. Taste is sweet up front, with a caramel middle, and a hint of vinegar in the finish, followed by a bit of bitterness from the hops. The finish is also bone dry, it essentially fades to nothing, like a lite beer. Not much hop flavor though, just a hint of bitterness. Mouthfeel was a bit sickly sweet, average carbonation levels. Reasonably drinkable, this is a decent beer overall, though for the price there are much better choices. I also must be lucky, as this was a clear bottle, and I didnt detect any skunky flavors as can plague beer in clear glass."
"M- Light, but falvorful. Smooth even flavor making very enjoyable to drink."
"D-Pretty easy to drink a couple of these."
"D- Flavor is light and this is a refreshing ale. A very good session beer, but the level of sweetness limits the drinkablity for me."
"The Good Session Brown..."
"D: An OK brown ale. If you're a fan of the style, it won't blow you away, and if you're not a fan, it won't win you over."
"Drinkability: Not very exciting but certainly easy to drink. I used to enjoy this a lot more when I was in my early 20s."
"Overall- a decent beer thats easy to get, easy to drink in session, and light on the wallet."
"A poor example of the style. This used to be a standard of mine when I was younger, but having enjoyed true brown ales from the US & Britain, this pales in comparison. It should be much sweeter, less sour and more robust in body."
"I could drink a lot of these, but I don't think I will. Nothing offensive per se, just not a head turner. Also a pet peeve of mine is beer in clear bottles. There's no need for it. I didn't take that into consideration with my ratings, but still. Cut down on the chance of your beer being light struck."
"Personally, I love this beer. The color is a beautiful glowing mahogany with a small amount of creamy head. The smell however, is average to below average with an expected nutty/floral aroma (nothing too surprising or exciting). The real appeal for me comes in the easy to drink taste and good mouthfeel. Obviously, it's not the most complex or delicately crafted beer, but it's simplicity makes this my favorite beer to sit around a board game or an open grill with."
"Drinkability- pretty drinkable, goes down smooth"
"The pour is brownish-red with excellent clarity. Good lacing. The aroma is sweet and malty. The mouthfeel is of good medium quality. The taste is also sweet and malty with a bit of nutty character."
"The name ""Brown Ale"" says it. It's a warm brown, only slightly transparent, with an off-white head that foams up about two inches in a pint glass and settles to a quarter inch over about a minute. Not a great smell - strongly herbal, and not the kind of herbs I think I'd want in my food. The taste makes up for it though. I've never seen this kind of nuttiness in another beer. The herbal scent is still present, but it fades into the background. Unfortunately, it sticks around once the rich central flavor has dissipated, causing a solid knock to the mouthfeel score. Drinkability wise, it's pretty heavy. You could do a number in succession, but you'd feel it. A very interesting beer that's worth a try, but may or may not work for you. I've had it before, and honestly I remembered it being better. Maybe a bad bottle this time?"
"Drinkability: An easy drinking English Brown Ale, but nothing overly special. This will be many people’s first experience with a Brown, and it’s not a bad choice. There are just so many other great ones to try next. Good beer to drink at the bar though; usually much better on tap and with friends."
"Well this one bring back some memories. Back in the 80's, I drank a lot of that beer... not a bad beer but not to sip. This is more of a session beer."
"Serving type: bottle first then I used a glass thinking it might help. Wrong."
"D- Outstanding drinkability. Refreshing, clean and very sessionable. Good go to beer for any occasion and easy to find which is a bonus."
"Mouthfeel - the beer seemed not far from flat: perhaps by design, perhaps by bad regulator settings (see above and my Ayinger Octoberfest review). In any case, not much fizziness in the beer and a medium-light mouthfeel."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer seems to be very thin. The carbonation is low maybe a bit more fizzy bubbler action would lift this beer up. Inspite of the lack of a lot of aroma or flavor and the thinness of the body this is a fairly drinkable beer. I could drink several of these in a session but not repeatedly. This would bore me to tears if drank daily."
"This is a decent brew and a great session beer, both for the quality and the price."
"The mouth is a bit thin, but the carbonation is decent. I could drink a few of these, but I do not consider it anything worth writing home about."
"Comment I can drink this if offered but I'll not be getting any more of these."
"My buddy loves these and had a few extra for some of his friends, so I decided to give it a closer look. I've had it before, but did not pay much attention to detail in the past. I'm fairly happy with the overall presentation, but I think that the body is a little light for my tastes with respect to the style. This isn't to say that I won't try this beer again, but it's something I can only have every once in a while. I've heard varying things about its availability, but from my experiences it's quite common; try it if you haven't had it before."
"D- Again, very smooth beer. Drinks very nice. Crisp and refreshing. I'll take another, barkeep."
"D- Easy enough to get through...I seem to remember Newcastle having more to it, maybe my taste buds were a little off tonight, but I was expecting more from this beer..."
"Nothing exciting, but balanced and very drinkable. I'm down with this at the pub I think. I don't think I'll be keeping it in the fridge though."
"This particular beer i find to be highly enjoyable. I like it very cold (naturally) in a frosty mug. Poured from a bottle into mug - kind of a thin head that quickly dissapates. As far as brown ales go, this one is not too heavy, but not too light in body. It has a pleasant, alomost fruity taste upon first entrance into the orfice in which your toungue lies in waiting. Going down the hatch is very smooth - leaves me wanting another drink. The Finster winks and approves."
"Drink is good I've had my share of these at some of the these places and it is very drinkable."
"Light is the operative word here. Drinkable as such, but left me wanting for more."
"Overall: I could sit and drink these all night, a great british brown ale."
"First brown ale and from what i read it is a good gateway into other brown ales."
"My first time trying this beer as a craft drinker, and probably my last time."
"One of the first imports I ever took a chance on trying, Newcastle will always hold a special place in my journey into craft beers (and for that reason, it gets a slight bump in my overall score category).  When visiting restaurants and other establishments that lack huge craft selections, Newcastle is generally a safe alternative. It's not as flavorful as other brown ales (Sam Smith's in particular) but Newcastle remains an affordable and refreshing brown ale."
"A good example of its style; I would drink it."
"D- Very drinkable if not served too cold. Takes me no time to down a pint, and I'm not a fast drinker at all!"
"Medium bodied, with medium to medium low carbonation."
"Drinkability? A good break from the more substantial brews that I tend to turn to, I enjoy it every time I have it."
"i will continue to drink these when offered one (as with most beers) but probably wont be seeking any out soon"
"Nothing too amazing going on here, but there is absolutely no denying the drinkability of this beer. In warm weather or cold weather, a cold Newcastle is always a welcome sight."
"Still affordable at $8.99 a six-pack. Price hasn't changed drastically. I'm not a huge brown ale fan but this is always my staple when I do crave one."
"-Dotson"
"D- Overall pretty good brew. No weird aftertastes but having more than a couple might end up being a chore."
"D: an easy drink, good session brew"
"overall i find this ale to be sweet and very easy to drink. one could def pound a six pack in no time. not much impressed."
"D- An easy drinking sesion brown. Not a ""good"" brew... But not a ""Bad"" one either."
"very drinkable brew, one of my favorites that is widely available. very refreshing."
"Still a great ale, perhaps not among the best that I've had but definately a drinkable brew... Especially good to keep in mind for days that I end up in a bar with nothing but macros."
"I thoroughly enjoy this beer. I have not had the opportunity to try a lot of brown ale's but I find that I am consistently buying Newcastle. It is a rich flavor but the drinkablitly is very smooth. I feel like it starts out as a hoppier beer but when it ends, it is very good. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quality beer available most places."
"D - 4.5 - The most drinkable of any Brown Ale, can easily finish multiple Newcastles and they go great with steaks."
"While it is definitely a brown ale, it might just be a tad above mediocre. Only if it is present, there is nothing else and I really want a beer will I spend money on it again."
"I can go on and on about how great it is, but all that's going to do is delay you from going out and trying it for yourself. If you've never had it, find some place that has Newcastle on tap. It's a little spendier than regular domestic beers, but it's far better. Try a Newcastle Brown Ale and taste the difference."
"D: Overall, it's not bad. A good session beer. It's relatively sweet and a nice change of pace after a few bitter beers."
"Final Thoughts - This beer was a good experience, however the acidic qualities of this beer need to go. If it was available in a pub, I'd consider buying it again as I think I'd prefer a bottle or tap next time. If they could tone down the acidic nature, then it would probably be one of my preferred imports."
"Most browns ales I've had in the past tended to be full bodied and bitter. Newcastle is quite the opposite, light and sweet. This is a really enjoyable brew."
"I got a finger of tan head that reduced to wisps before I could blink. Color was a deep brown with ruby highlights and NE-quality clarity. Nose was rich and malty sweet. Mouthfeel was slightly on the thin side and had a chocolaty taste on the tongue. Finish had a chocolate/anise flavor, but it was kind of weak. It needs more Ooomph overall."
"D - a decent brown ale and a good session brew; always tastes best cold and on tap"
"D - this beer is oh so easy to drink, but it is pretty sweet (typical i guess), and rather watery, i think if sessioned the flavor and overall experience is just not substantial enough to keep you excited about crackin another, and the goin rate is rather pricey for what you get"
"Overall- This is a nice drinkable brown ale. Nothing to run home and tell your mom about but still a nice beer."
"I tend to drink these pretty easily. It is a big macro brew brown and I enjoy it for what it is, just that."
"Drinkability - one only. This isn't something you bang away at all day."
"Drinkabilty- Very high drinkabilty one I could see wanting to drinking many of in a nite, this is one I definitely enjoy having every so often and tend to like it even more on tap then out of the bottle. Its a tad sweet but not so much so it messes with drinkabilty being high. A good beer I enjoy visiting every so often as a break from the usual Hop beers i frequent lately."
"D - Easy to drink, a good stand-by beer if nothing else is around."
"A tasty, and easy enough to put back offering, if you don't mind keeping your mind otherwise occupied, which I seem more than capable of doing at the moment, colleagues and black-skirted waitresses so clearly abundant and engaging."
"I really don't know why so many people love this. Simply, it is a weak flavored stadium beer that dumps sweetness on top of brown water. In fact, if you ask for one across the Pond, you may get a disapproving reaction, as you might here with a Corona. I definitely prefer Budweiser's new ale over this, although can see drinking them late at night when the party winds down. Drinkable? Yes. Enjoyable. Barely. Not the worst, just something with a better fanbase than flavor, a la Heineken."
"Drinkability: Despite all of its flaws (and they are numerous), this beer still remains drinkable. The sum of its parts are somehow (slightly!) greater than the whole. The addition of corn to the grist helps here (and yes, I know I counted its thin body against the beer in the mouthfeel section, but only relative to style). Good ole Newkie Brown, just a slight step up from the american lagers IMO. It would definitely get a better rating if it was packaged properly! (I wonder how much better it presents itself in a can?) The truth of the matter is that I thoroughly enjoy this underappreciated style. I consequently have very mixed feelings returning to this paradigm, the origin of the northern english browns. But now having studied it as a homebrewer, I know the enemy and it is mediocrity. What I've learned is that the english truly understood balance (which is not to be conflated with blandness) even if this beer only poorly exhibits the virtues of british brewing. And now I take my leave of you oh reader to walk yet another dog, the Samuel Smith Nut Brown Ale!"
"cheers"
"Overall this is a good beer. Before I started searching harder for the world's best beers I was a big fan of this one. Now, I think there are simply better beers out there - for a Nut Brown, I'd take a Sam Smith or a Smutty over this any day. That said, this is a reliable beer to get on tap when the selection isn't much more limited than the more ""craft"" macrobrews."
"A nice chestnut brown body. Nutty, smooth and insanely sessionable sums up Newcastle. Nutty toasted maltiness with low hop character, but this beer is in no way about hops. Enjoyable sweetness. A bit lacking in complexity, but a nice break from all the high-complexity big beers that I have been drinking lately - definitely unique though. Ultra smooth slick mouthfeel, with a nice level of carbonation. If it wasn't for the import price, this would be my go-to session beer every time."
"Great beer to get on tap. Went well with my meal and is a great brew. I love the flavor, very rich and caramel like. Good head retention and very nice color. This is one of my favorite brews now. Will be coming back for more of these in the future, thats for sure."
"Poured from tap into 7oz pilsner type glass. Pours a deep brown with a finger of tan head. Smells like cherries and light malt. Taste is like bitter fruit, cherries mostly. Really dull beer. Very light mouthfeel. I couldn't drink much of this as it sits heavy for how light it is. I won't buy again."
"Newcastle is twice as good on tap! Poured a dark brown into a standard pint glass with a slight amber colour when the light moves through it. It had a 2"" head that lasted until the last quarter of the beer with good lacing. Smelled very malty with a faint floral scent, a tasted of caramel malts and slightly spicy hops...very balanced and smooth in the mouth. I love this one!"
"there are much better brews out there."
"Overall a tasty light brown from the U.K. I could see drinkers 2 or 3 of these in one sitting and still be quite functional."
"This was way better on-tap than in the bottle. I actually found this to taste damn good for an English Brown Ale. I still won't chance it in bottles but I may start getting it more often when I'm out and it's one of the better things on tap."
"A finger of head dissipates quickly, but leaves some lace on the glass; the color is dark brown with some red and ruby hues. Not too memorable an aroma--some sweet, roasted malts on the nose. The taste features toasted grains with a balanced malt and hop finish. This beer feels crisp and light in the mouth, which helps the drinkability factor. This is, no doubt, the perfect pizza beer. It's balanced, light and palatable. I would have more than one, but for those looking for a complex English ale, this is not the brew for you."
"this is a very good and very drinkable brown ale. This is a great beer to just sit back and sip a few. It is a very simple brew with a very good refreshing taste. This is one of the beers that is a go to beer when you just want an enjoyable, simple, refreshing and very drinkable beer."
"Overall it's a fine casual beer but I don't think it's worth the price at all, although it's very drinkable in large quantities I wouldn't pay the money...I'll probably have again on-tap at a restaurant with no good craft beers available."
"Drinkable, ya.I found it easy, simple and solid in body. I'd order this over a honey brown to avoid alot of unneeded sweetness."
"Pours a clear beautiful brown with a medium tan head with decent retention. Smells of biscuity and nutty malts; pretty simple but good aromas. Solid flavor: toasty and sweet malt, backed by a nice earthy bitterness. Body comes up a bit to watery but this is an eminently drinkable beer. A wonderful session ale that tastes great both on bottle and on tap. A classic."
"This is just a nice drinking beer. Nothing spectacular here, but a solid choice and one I would definitely choose in bars and restaurants that do not have extensive craft brew selections."
"Light bodied, low carbonation. The beer feels watery overall, with no outstanding flavor characteristic. Everything about it (aroma, flavor) seems like it needs just a bit more ""oomf."" I've had it on-tap and from bottles with similar results. Not a bad choice since this is available at most bars, but not that great of a Brown Ale overall."
"The bitterness in the short finish is low, if not inconsiderable, while the mouthfeel remains quite refreshing, but turning watery along the way and slightly sticky towards the end. Lacking complexity and depth, it's not a very interesting brown ale, compared with a few distinctive and more tasty brown ales I've tasted. Nevertheless it's a not-bad ""movie beer"" to quaff."
"D- Drinkability is ok. Depends on the weather and my mood. Doesn't necessarily leave me wanting more....more of a thirst quencher at times."
"Very light finish; can definitely drink a few at a time; will drink again but no rush"
" Drinkability: If u wanna put in a good long shift of drinking this is a good beer to do it with thats for sure."
"I've had this beer both in bottle and tap. I prefer on tap and not so frosty. Definitely a beer I could go out and drink with a few friends at a local bar."
"The price and availability of this beer make it that much better."
"Overall: This is a decent beer, and I am happy that it is pretty available since sometimes I am at a place with nothing better. I would never pick this over a good IPA or anything though."
"D: this one always goes down easy, great session beer, especially from a can, i could drink quite a few of these, and after sampling it from a can i have a renewed fondness for this beer."
"OVERALL: Definitely drinkable and sessionable, though one might get bored with it pretty quickly. It was enjoyable enough, but certainly not memorable, and certainly not something I'd go looking for. On the other hand, it's easy to drink and is not offensive in any way, so I can see why many people like it so much."
"D - there is no chance i would ever stop buying this beer...its one of the few beers i get in the mood to drink if i'm out...most of the other times i'll just try something different..."
"Bottle. Poured into shaker. Nice dark amber color, little head. nice taste, somewhat malty. easy to drink with a pleasant finish. Nice brew. A bit overpriced. My first experience with an English Brown Ale. Would enjoy again, more of a session beer for me."
"I could drink these one after another. The taste is nice, and it actually quenches your thirst. I'll get these again when I want to drink several at one sitting."
" Light Brown color with almost no head.Nutty,spicy,slightly skunk aroma. Flavor of dry grain and caramel with a touch of sweetness and a hint of burnt sugar.Loads of carbonation but none apparent in the mouth.Crisp finish.Drinkable but way overpriced for what it is IMO."
"Overall: This has been my usual beer to order if I'm ever stuck at at a BMC bar. Very smooth and drinkable. Notes of grandeur, but overall too commercial to make it there."
"in general the subtle flavor and refreshing nature of this beer makes it extremely drinkable, but nothing special."
"D: Pretty sessionable. Not as interesting as I had remembered but still good."
"It goes down smooth, easy to put down a six of these. Its a decent beer, but nothing to go out of your way for."
"Light palette, light nose, decent presentation. Easy brew to drink down if you're not offended by something flavor ""non-specific"". Does have a hint of sweetness. Decent quaff."
"Very drinkable indeed."
"Now I throw it in a mixed sixer and it's the cheapest one. Doesn't seem to taste as good now either. Just very watery and has an odd mouthfeel and finish to it. Has some decent nutty taste but the weirdness of it in your mouth kind of ruins it. Looks good with some minor lacing but it's a shadow of its former self.. I miss you Newcastle."
"Had on tap poured into chilled glass(damnit). This chilled glass caused the head to freeze, so good thing Ive had this before for a good review. Leaves a small head that dissipates quickly and leaves very little lacing. Smells malty, but not strong. Taste is similar, malty bitter, but not a strong flavor. It is a thin watery feeling beer, but its easily sessionable, and a lot of bars carry it. Its an old standby for me, if I don't know anything else on the menu, or if I dont like anything else. Its not good for much else though."
"D: Good party beer. Not one I'd buy for myself."
"(rated Nov 28, 2008)"
"Wow, wow, wow! I haven't had one of these in a few years and I can't believe I use to drink this crappy ass beer. The beer was fresh but tasted less than desireable. I think my tastes have changed or this beer got worse. Not a very good beer. If you are looking for a nice beer for a party and want your guests to enjoy a nice beer, this ain't it."
"But skunky is something I've never experienced with the Nukie!"
"Pours a clear dark brown. 1/4 inch to 1/2 head with poor retention and slight lacing. Strong sweet malt aroma along with a slight hoppiness. Fits the style. Tastes sweet with low carbonation. Overall a very smooth beer that fits the style - I'd recommend."
"Easy drinking brown ale, but it's mostly due to lack of any real flavor."
"An altogether unimpressive but decent brown ale. Goes down easily, is low enough ABV to session, and is readily available and fairly cheap. I don't mind picking up a couple cans of this brew every now and again, but there are much better brews to be found."
"Not a beer that will make it to my favourites, but I wouldn't turn it down if it was offered to me."
"D - More drinkable than I first imagined. Something I will definitely have again but wont make its way to the top of my list any time soon."
"The beer looks like it would taste good. It does not. Pours clear brown with a short off-white head. Brown bread aroma that is old and dusty. Taste is watery, just like the mouthfeel. Sour-sweet malt and a little Worchester-saucy. It is also pricey in comparison to other beers, thus sealing its fate as an underachiever."
"This might be good for the style, but its not my thing. Not something I would seek out of buy again. Way to sweet for me."
"I have had this on tap before, and it's much better, but I haven't gotten a chance to rate it yet."
"Enjoyed again (not for a few years) tonight at Texas Road House (great restaurant with a not so great beer selection). Brown with red highlights in the glass. Little head to speak of. Sweet caramel in the nose and the same in the initial taste. Touch of bitterness in the aftertaste, with a nice bubbly carbonation on the tongue. Nothing complex here, but a really enjoyable companion to food. Very drinkable."
"The is no head, a deep dark tan color with red hue. The nose is caramel, molasses, nutty and malty notes The taste is is nothing like the nose it is bland with hints of nuts and caramel and roasted malt with a slight hint of hops. The is an acidic finish kinda gave it a tarty mouth feel is a good beer but a bit overrated. There is no body and very thin a bit watery"
"Drinkability: Drinkable, and a good session beer. I wouldn't mind having it again, but not something I would buy regularly. I like it well enough, but it seems like it has something missing."
"Too sweet for my tastes. Hop it up a little to balance it out"
"Definitely one of my favorite ales. It has a very sweet, nutty/oaky, very slightly smoky flavor that doesn't get old. One 550 mL bottle is really nice at the end of a long day. And frankly, the only reason I don't enjoy this one more often is that I see it as a way to treat myself on a semi-special occasion."
"As I said before, this is an easy drinking, old reliable, on draft anyway, from the college days, when drinking Newcastle was heady. Now its lackluster."
"Overall this is one of the better widely available macros. It'll do in a pinch."
"i really dont know how i missed reviewing this one, im not even sure if the website is correct telling me ive never had it. regardless here we go... has a beautiful oaky color to it, slighty reddish amber color. smell is great, inviting malty aroma.. really unlike any beer. taste is great, newcastle has a unique taste of its own thats just great. its a cheap beer that is one of my favorites"
"D_Extremely easy to drink, completely unoffensive, a refreshing quality lends itself to drinking many of these brews"
"Drinkability: only had one available, but easily could've had several more; not great tasting, but it was a solid beer"
"The smell was also like an old skunky smell and pretty unpleasant i've got to say. Not recommended."
"Update! Tried for the 3rd time recently, and it wasn't all that bad. Missing body and a little carbonation, and those skunky/grassy flavors & aromas I mentioned where reduced down to earthy, herbal & grassy notes. Not real great in my opinion, but I say go for to see what you think. Cheers!"
"Pours a reddish-brown color body, with a smallish slightly off-white head. Has an aroma of some malts, hops, sweetness, some flowers. Taste of malts, some sweetness, molasses, and is slightly bitter. Clean aftertaste of malts?"
"I really wasn't impressed with this ale at all. It pours a clean brown color, that only smells faintly of tea. The taste is very watered down, and in fact this is probably the most watery import that I have tried. There is only a slight taste of tea. I've had it once, and probably will never have it again."
"Cheers!!"
"D: I can pound this down. Pour me another."
"shouldnt be too hard to find, and def better than some other macros"
"Poured dark reddish brown into a goblet. A thin head rises and then quickly fades, leaving no lacing. Aroma is of cranberries and malt. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a bit of carbonation, despite the lack of carbonation in the appearance. Taste is malt, crackers, nut, wood, with a faint hint of hoppiness just at the back end. Almost like the flavor wants to be there but falls just short. Drinkability is good due to the inoffensiveness of the brew. Overall not too bad. Despite all this, I think the rest of the sixer will be more suited for cooking."
"I am not a huge fan of this beer, my brother loves it and it's all he drinks unless i can talk him into something else. Pours a golden red color, smells nutty, taste like...I have heard people say sawdust and that is a fair thing to say. I dont like the finish of this beer either its not a good taste and it just stick around"
"(From a limited, dated journal): red/dark amber in color, nutty caramel nose. Hints of almond in the taste and a soft finish; good sweet/bitter balance; hints of apple and raspberry? Or was that dinner... pleasant honey aftertaste. Overall a solid brown ale and, given its availability, I'd pick this up a few more times."
"Drinkability: Not bad taste, low ABV, and light..so its good for a couple. Nothing excessively memorable though."
"My friends and the waiter suggested this beer and I am glad I took the advice. I will surely be having this again. I loved it."
"I've checked it off the list. No need to come back for more."
"D: Overall, this is an easy drinker. No dynamic flavors, but pleasent anyway."
"Everyone at our table in the restaurant told me I wouldn't enjoy this beer, but I can't wait to buy a case."
"Highly quaffable and extraordinarily desirable. Simple, yet splendidly balanced. The quintessential English Brown."
"M - Was good mouthful flavorful beer."
"Very easy drinkability, thoroughly enjoyed this & was a very nice surprise."
"Its a nice beer, but it could be so much more. But, it could also be much worse. Nice every once in a while."
"Overall- I would drink this stuff again, but I wouldn't buy. It's kinda pricey for a highly ok beer. Kinda a brown ale made to appeal to the masses, no one can't hate this, but I'm not sure who could love it."
"Overall this was a pretty good beer, I tended to like this one. Overall this beer is not a horrible beer but it was not my favorite, it happens to be my neighbors favorite beer, it seems to have an overall good taste, the flavor was decent, my neighbor loved this beer, and since the price is not bad I can have him help me on my new deck."
"Clint Eastwood's favourite beer. What else do you want me to say? Great beer"
"Drinkability is high, with some pleasant brown notes of malt and bread making it a pleasantly light change from domestic micros, but a huge step above most macros. All in all, in its class, it's hard to beat. And I just may have one or two more."
"Nothing spectacular, but very solid and rarely disappoints."
"12 oz clear bottle. Poured into a pint glass. Clear auburn color with a frothy tan head. Aroma is barely distinguishable from that of a pilsener. It's a faint, grainy, and there's a bit of toffee. Flavor is milky with some roast up front and chocolate tones and sweet nuttiness in the finish. Smooth, sweet, and easy to drink. Flavor is noticeably watery; this is basically a 'diet' brown ale in taste. With more robustness, this could be a good beer, but as it is, it's just another mediocre-but-drinkable beer."
"Overall: not very good. Too thin and watery. Avoid. There are many better brown ales (a style I like) out there."
"I was hesitant to try this beer. Popular European Ales usually let me down, but this beer was a pleasant surprise. The beer is a beautiful, translucent reddish-brown. The smell contains spicy, toasted malts, oils and that familiar skunky smell that comes with a typical European brew. The taste contains some nice spice (nutmeg? cinnamon?), but it is mild and balanced out by the oily overtones. The malt flavor is quite rich and the hops balance everything out nicely with a nice bite. Despite its richness it is a fairly light beer and that means I could drink it all day."
"I would reccomend this ale to anyone not completely preoccupied with numerous complexities in their beer."
"Drinkability- This was very easy to down. I give the British an A for this very simple, stylish beer."
"Newcastle Brown used to be the brown ale that I judged all others by. I don't know what happened though... The last 12-pack I got really let me down. The beer looks awesome in a clear pint, and has a decent head that quickly dissipates. The smell is nice as well - nice and caramel-like. The taste left something to be desired... I don't know what, but this beer just isn't as complicated as I thought it was, and the mouthfeel is pretty thin as well, which leads to a decrease in drinkability if you ask me. Decent beer, but I have had much better for the price."
"My best description is plain brown ale. A little too plain bordering on bland. It is very drinkable as there is nothing offensive about it."
"D--An easy drinker for sure, but just because there isn't much to offer. A remedial brown ale for the American Lager crowd."
"Drinkability: Better than the typical American macro, but this a brown ale and shouldn't be sompared to macro lagers. For a brown ale, it's sub par but still mildly enjoyable."
"Poured into a pint glass this beer has a sandy tan color with a slight white head that doesn't last and leaves minimal lacing. The smell is of malt and some slight roasted caramel. The taste is very thin and slightly nutty. Very light carbonation and not as much body as I would like. This brew is not as fantastic as I originally had laid claim. Hey as I get older my palate has gotten ""better"" in my opinion..."
"Excellent brown ale that's crisp and clean and full of carmel-y goodness! Smooth brew that goes well with most any pub food. I really enjoyed this one. It was a little smoky and nutty tasting. A very commonly found brew that I hadn't tried yet, but I will for sure visit this one again."
"Pours a dark brown color with a decent tan head and lacing. Altough I've had it before when it didn't generate any head. I kind of expected a stronger aroma and flavor. Kind of boring but solid. Subtle sweet malty flavor with brown sugar notes in the background. This is very easy to drink but sometimes I feel this could use an extra kick. Good Brown Ale that you can find just about anywhere."
"This beer is pushed in every hipster magazine out there, and we've all seen the ads on tv. I encourage people to give this a try if anything to understand what a poor mass market brown ale is. Know your enemy."
"Easily drinkable, at least one full step up from most macros. Good beer to have your Bud Light swilling buddy try as a trade up."
"Mouthfeel is a bit watery. Very easily drinkable, but I'll avoid it in the future."
"The beer looked great. It's dark and rich looking. The smell was decent, malty mostly. Taste....what the heck happened?? You get a quick hint of maltiness, then it disappears. It's like half a step above a macro lager. I had high hopes from the appearance alone. But somehow, this one just doesn't deliver. It seems like the flavor should be there, but it isn't."
"Drinkability is top notch. These go down like water and are always great to toast with over poker and gigs. Good stuff!"
"Poured from a clear bottle,a dark brown with red tinge,almost looks like root beer,the head was on the smallish side,tan in color that dissipates rather quickly and some spotty laceing.Aroma has a metalic kinda smell to it,which is kinda strange coming from a clear bottle,a hint of fruit and lite mollases.Taste,pretty damn good,lite sweetness,some fruits,a tinge of caramel,nuts and all going down with a creamy feel to it.Enjoyable brew with a moderate mouthfeel to it,will definitly have to get more of this,highly recommended."
"Drinkability is moderate to high. Decent flavor and low alcohol make this brew easily sessionable. It is however boring and uninspiring."
"This beer is worth trying, but there is really nothing all that special to it. Easy to drink, which is nice. But I would rather have something more complex if I am to drink a brown."
"D - I have had this a ton in the past, but I only just got around to getting another one for the purposes of reviewing. Not super exciting, but always very drinkable. It's an old favorite for me."
"ON TAP, I highly recommend this ale; perhaps I could also try the can version. The clear bottles are a poor choice for packaging."
"More like a soft drink than a good beer. Light and fizzy, with almost no body. Flavour and aroma dominated by spicy and caramel notes, especially cinnamon. None of the nutty character you often get with browns. No strong hops. Thin and sweet."
"This is a decent nutty brown ale. It is good ice cold, when your in the mood for something on the sweet side. It has a slightly creamy head, with good retention. It has a nice dark, but not devoid of light color. Its a decent beer for people who don't like a big, flavorful beer."
"This is one of my go to beers if I am at an establishment that doesn't offer anything that isn't mainstream. It is enjoyable with a good meal especially if you ordered meat or fish. Pours a nice medium brown color with good head and decent lacing. I like mine to warm up a little in the glass, if it is too cold then it doesn't smell or taste as good. The aroma is sweet and malty. Solid taste nothing overpowers this ale, it is very smooth and slightly creamy. Finishes well with a pleasant mellow aftertaste. I generally only drink this with a meal, cause if I am looking to just have a beer then I prefer a more complex flavor, but this brown ale has complimented a lot of dishes for me."
"mid body. adequate carbonation. i have been digging this beer for years. always drank this, on tap, at a past hangout (i miss that place). i could do a session and have many times. i will continue to drink this beer. easy beer to drink. good brown ale."
"I will need to try more brown ales from England to compare before judging it soley against American craft brewer's versions of English and American Browns. I am a malty, brown ale liking type of beer drinker, so I believe I am judging this one to the style. We'll see."
"Medium brown, low carbed, minimal white head. Lightly hopped limits aroma to light caramelly, butteryness. Taste is smooth & mild caramel malt, little sweetness but not too much to make heavy & filling. Very, very drinkable, especially if fresh & on tap. A classic English Brown - like a good neighbor always there for ya."
"Drank straight from the bottle on a hot summer day, very tasty and not overwhelming (especially considering I had a 'Poet' Oatmeal Stout earlier on ) Not my absolute favorite but it ranks up there now; a very refreshing change of pace and easy to drink with very light carbonation. I recommend at least trying it once! I just picked up another 6 pack tonight! Drinking one as I type!"
"my first dark beer. a great english ale. this beer opened my mind from only liking american macro brews into loving beers from all over the world. i have had many great dark beers, and this one by far is my favorite dark beer. its not strong in flavor like guinness and it doesn't have the hoppiness of sam adams but it is very refreshing. i feel its a good transitional beer for people who wanna expand into better beers"
"Drinkability - This one is an old-stand by if you're not in the mood for a heavier, bolder beer, and not quite in the mood for yellow fizzy water as well. Get a couple pints of these ice cold and you'll have a great evening."
"D: A decent offering that was spicy, fruity and easy to drink. Solid all around by style and worthy of a try."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a translucent brownish-red with a half-inch off-white cap that quickly dissipated into a thin skim; no lacing adhered during the session. Nose was malty with a hint of caramel for sweetness and a mild skunky character. Taste consistent with nose, but skunky quality is more detectable at the finish. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a kiss of effervescence across the tongue. I've always found Newkie brown to be a very easy drinking sessionable brew and it had been my go to beer for years. However, the more I explore the style the more I realize that there are better offerings out there."
"Gave it a big pour and got a huge head that dissipated at an average rate. Color of watered down coke, crystal clear. Not much in the way of aroma other than a bit of hops. Very light carbonation and light body. Balanced taste with a nice crisp, slightly hoppy finish. A very drinkable beer."
"Dark brown color, with an amber redness when held up to a light. Minimal head and lacing. Aroma was weak, largely floral, with a hint of caramel. Taste was by no means unpleasant, but still very unimpressive. Slightly bitter, with a sweeter finish, and leaves a fresh floral scent once swallowed. I'm not a fan of the mouthfeel - it reminds me of carbonated water from Germany. Just watery, and the tickle from the carbonation is more annoying than enjoyable. Still drinkable - goes down easy - but not far from a favorite."
"The one lesson I have learned from reviewing this one is that it is not worth its price. If it was the price of your average yellow beer, I'd drink it much more than I will from here on out."
"A fairly decent big name beer. Nice to find on tap at a bar when the options are few."
"Fairly middle of the road to me."
"Super smooth and light bodied. Great drinkability."
"boy was this one good, it was a light brown that had very little head when i poureed it, it dident have a strong smell but it was packed with flavor, good malty carmilised grain with a smouth hop kiss at the end, i couldent stop untill the 6er was gone."
"Obviously, my tastes have changed as I tend to lean towards bigger belgians, IPAs, and stouts. However, it's nice, every once in a while, to come back to an old favorite."
"overall,this is a fairly nice beer, very sessionable and not overwhelming"
"DRINKABILITY- It's a run of the mill beer in my book. Certaintly not as good as I had previously thought....and just drink it out of the bottle...you aren't gaining much by pouring it into a glass."
"Dark brown colored ale with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is a very faint nutty smell.Taste is faint nuts,butter and bread.I think this ale could be better by adding a little more flavor to it.A tad bit watery but overall slightly better than average,I would drink again."
"Pretty good balance of hop and malt, although both are on the lighter side. The body is thin and the carbonation is high. As a lawn-mower offering, this would rate quite high. As an English brown ale, it is not as robust as others. This also appears to be on the verge of skunking."
"Purchased in a 6 pack at a local grocery store."
"D. Fairly drinkable, but nothing to write home about. For the price, not really worth it."
"Not a bad brew, just a little over priced in my book. It has a brown color with a beige head. The nose is mostly malty with some nutty bread in there. The taste is more of the same. Mild malts and possibly soft bitter hops. A light body, but smooth after it opens up. A good drinker."
"Had on tap at UNO in a 22oz glass. Pours a nice amber color with a little head that left some light lacing on the glass. It gave off scents of sweet caramel and malt. The beer starts off sweet as the malt dominates and little else is going on as the beer finishes dry. The beer is light on the palate with medium carbonation and finishes with a dry taste. This is a decent brown ale that one could drink quite a bit, but I probably won't rush out to get this one again."
"I was able to still pick up a little of the sweetness at the beginning followed by a very slight hoppy bitterness at the end. At least the aftertaste didn't last long."
"This beer is what I would consider a better than average english brown ale. The auroma starts the second you open the bottle. I would love it if this beer had just a bit more powerful flavor but I definatly still like it."
"The taste and texture are very smooth and easy on the palate, yet uit has a nice, persistent character of fruit, caramel, a little wine, a hint of nuts and bread, and a toasty grain finish. It is a good balance of flavour, body, drinkability, and lightness. However, most of the character is lost if it's too cold, in which case it hardly seems to have much taste at all, so make sure it's not straight out of the fridge."
"D: A little too drinkable, if you catch my drift."
"Not a stellar review but here the catch.... This beer is incredibly drinkable. As mentioned in a previous review, most people I've introduced it to, like it. Even my mom who dislikes beer in general"
"enjoy"
"D: The lightness and smoothness also lend to this beer being more drinkable. It is not a complex beer, and by the end of the pint, I just wanted to be finished with it (bad sign). I would recommend drinking this at room temp or warmer."
"D - One of the easiest beers I can go to bar and drink. It goes down smooth with no aftertaste, and without all the carbonation to give me the hiccups right in the middle of a night out. Always a great choice."
"D: Very drinkable. Not a beer I'd drink alone, but with dinner out with friends, this stuff goes down very easily. Low ABV keeps it from going to your head."
"D: Great drinking beer. They don't get old as far as taste goes. I have this beer with meals, watching a football game or while relaxing."
"A little dissappointing. My memory failed me. I thought this beer was better the last time I had it. It's dark amber brown with a nice head but is lacking any kind of aromas that jump out at you. It smells sweet and malty and tastes very mild. Sort of a sweet nutty flavor with almost no hop bitterness. Good texture and easy to drink but I think the microbrewed brown ales that I've had lateley are superior to this one."
"A decent beer that's pretty readily available. I happened to buy these at a gas station for tailgating before a basketball game. I picked it because the only other options were bud, miller, etc. Bu it's a decent beer."
"D- Definitely drinkable. My drink of choice at shows with shitty bars."
"Drinkability- The skunkiness is terrible and really hurts the beer. I do not intend on having another one of these until it's on tap."
"To be fair, I didn't know what to expect from this. Am I asking too much from a beer that already isn't overly impressive to me? Maybe, but I figured that I'd give this one a shot to see if I found a format that I like. Obviously beer can take on different characteristics depending upon its packaging, and I wanted to give this one an honest shake. My suggestion would be to go bottle or tap with this one."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Upon entering the mouth, the beer prickles and begins to foam up fast, then it releases its microbubble carbonation and easily goes down. As far as choosing this particular English Brown Ale over other available brews of the same style... I wouldn't. Glad to have tried this with an open mind, though."
"Notes: I know this beer is popular and it spends good money on Ads,yet it failed to impress me and I feel this is just another beer I would avoid unless given to me free. It was highly carbonated and it lacked the hops and malt balance to give it respectability. I see many will disagree,but Brown Ales are my first love and this is not a good brown ale-just slightly below average. I will try once more in the future, but I distrust beer in clear bottles."
"Smell is malt first then hops. Malt taste then bitter hop finish. Taste is balanced. Its like this beer is brewed to be a little different but not to far off the beaten path. Brown ales are not really something I usually grab. This one came in an Xmas variety pack."
"While some snobs knock it, this is a classic. ""Ol' Nukey Brown"" is responsible for weening many of us off BMC, and for that alone deserves praise."
"Pours an ornage copper color from a clear bottle with a short and thin off-white head that settles pretty fast. Not much to the nose except some nice sweet toasted malts and a tiny bit of hoppy bitter at the end of the aroma. The taste is more bland than I was expecting with some malts and some hops present to round out the flavor. It has a clean and light mouthfeel which makes it pretty drinkable, but something I don't plan on getting very often."
"Pours a clear amber-brown with a light tan lid that settles quickly. A light nose is sweet and a bit fruity. Caramel malt flavors along with toasted grains and light earthy hops. A bit fruit and nuts show up as well, and the finish is lightly bitter. Not bad overall, this is a fairly tasty English Brown macro-brew that was a definite stepping stone for my journey from light beer binge drinking to quality beer appreciation."
"MF/D: An enjoyable brew, best served from the bottle. It's very drinkable, and my beer of choice in most ""English"" pubs. Perhaps a little ""generic"" for some, it's still a solid beer from a large(ish) brewery."
"The appearance is definitely this beers strong point, an inviting dark amber with a thick white head, which dissipated rather quickly. Smell of roasted malts, but nothing special. The taste is very distant, more malt, very little hop to speak of. Finish is slightly bitter, but not that great hoppy bitterness. Feels very watery, not overly carbonated, but bubbles hard in your stomach, not letting you drink too many of these."
"Poured at Disneyland Hotel restaurant (Hook...something)."
"Great malty aroma and a light crispness across the nose. Taste is wonderful and everything a brown ale should hope to be. Malty and nutty, finishes crisply and leaves a good aftertaste. Definitely a beer you can have any time."
"MF&D - Medium bodied and smooth. Coats the mouth decently and leaves a bit of sweetness on the lips. The fact that NewCastle is not overly carbonated makes it a top notch session ale."
"Drinkability: It sits like a rock in your stomach. One can be enjoyable as a change of pace, but it's very difficult to session."
"Taste has an unpleasant sickly sweetness on the very front palate which follows on nicely to a fairly hoppy mid palate with a slight burnt or roasted character, which would probably stand to be greatly increased. At the moment, with the quite sweet hit on the front it tastes like coffee diluted with lots and lots of sugar. Mouthfeel is watery and still. Not all that great, really. I guess it's mild enough to drink, but I wouldn't."
"Verdict: Certainly no where near as good as from a tap, but still a great session beer from the bottle. If you're looking for something a little darker, this is a beer with a real bite you can drink all night long. Good dog."
"Feel is decent, but uninspiring. It is, however, very easy to drink, and another one of those ""change of pace"" macro beers."
"Poured a dark reddish-brown amber. Aroma is of the sort of toast that will not trigger your smoke alarm, but is still toasty, faintly maltish, and nutty. There is also a bit of toffee and esters. Flavor is primarily lightly toasted malt with light fruit, cherry, raisin, and nuts. The carbonation is well balanced, and the mouthfeel is appropriate for the flavor and style. This is not one of my favorites, but it is frequently one of the best brews on tap in a lot of bars, and I'm just thankful it's there."
"D: this used to be a go-to beer of mine at certain establishments, but it's fallen out of favor over the years. perhaps something has changed. I keep expecting more than I get and perhaps it's time to stop ordering it."
"Drinkablity: Great staple brew. At home during a BBQ or any other serious session. A hot weather brew with plenty of character."
"Drinkability: fairly easy to drink with most attributes being mainly mild and difficult to detect. I've drank Newkie Brown for decades now, but few and far between lately. Somehow, I'm sure this is a much better beer in England, at the source. This is a brown ale ""light""."
"Creamy light mouthfeel, low carbonation, moderately sweet palate with nuts, some banana. Accentuating sourness and light bitterness. Finish is nutty and brown sugar sweet, not malty sweet. Flash of vanilla cake mix. A little weak on flavour. Too sugary-sweet."
"Poured this into my pint glass and received a small, creamy head that unfortunately died quickly on top of a seethru dirty brown. The smell is not too clear, as there are tidbits of malts and some sweetness (yeast?). I say this because Newcastle is always a little less dry and a little more smooth/sweet in the taste and mouthfeel (a light version of a stout if you will, made ""palatable"" to Americans). All I can say is I don't mind Newcastle, but it is on the cheap end for a reason. One of those beers that ""beer drinkers"" drink, when in fact they have no clue what they're talking about. I wish I could add more, but I don't really note anything specific in the taste region. It is just a sweeter version of a real brown ale and there are no discernable malts."
"This effort was not as good as I remember my other encounters with this beverage. An acceptable beer but I probably will not order from that establishment again. It was still better than the other mass produced offerings."
"D - Anyday and everyday, Great beer to relax at the end of the day or enjoy a nice dinner with."
"I only drink this one on tap because it's very hard to find a six that hasn't been skunked due to the clear glass bottles."
"Served on tap at Uno's in Harvard Square (hey, our 3-year old enjoys Uno's...but not this one). Clean, uniform, light brown color with decent yet thin head. Scent of a solid brown ale - English-style malt is abundant with minimal hops. Tastes very clean - the very light alcohol presence helps to make this a well-blended quaff - has mild depth with sort of a nut-bread backbone. Overall it's very moderate all-around - solid finish. Easy to drink but rather filling."
"I think the mouthfeel and the aroma are the big differences here vs. the bottle. Definitely prefer the canned, and now I have a new session beer!"
"Transluscent maroon pour with offwhite head. Smells skunky, like a heineken or st. pauli girl would, then a bit sour, vinegar-ish smell. A bit of the band-aid smell I've read about, but this was my first experience actually noticing it. Taste is a thin boring very lightly malty flavor that was much weaker than I expected, but at least I didn't taste the skunkiness. Even if this one weren't bad, the flavor was a very diluted brown ale."
"this was the first of many brown ales that i have tried. it was a refreshing change from all the ""lite"" beers i was drinking in college. it had more flavor and taste than most beers i had tried up to that point. its rich smoothness was a welcome departure from the ordinary. best served cold with calzones or pizza. and every time i have one, it reminds me of good times."
"D: Nothing too complicated, but a nice flavor, not too heavy. Easy to drink."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall a decent beer, but not as good as what I remember."
" ~ I really used to like this beer. The Final Score used to have it on tap when I was in college. I seem to have grown away from enjoying what this beer has to offer."
"An all around average beer. This is something to fall back on at a bar when there is nothing else to drink."
"Overall: first of all I always figured that English Brown Ales would not use this amount of adjuncts. The label states Water, Barley, Wheat, Maize, Glucose Syrup, Caramel, E150, Hops, Yeast. I did not enjoy this one and wont buy it again."
"Poured from a 12oz clear glass bottle into a pint glass. It was a brown color with minimal carb and no lacing. It had a small off white head that evaporated rather quickly. The aroma was sweet malt with some roasted and caramel in there. Not bad for a brown. The taste was pretty good for what it is. Had a nice bite to it. For me this is not gonna be an award winning beer but it is great session beer. Also, it can be a big player at a lot of local bars where this and Blue Moon are the only non macros on tap. (Occasional session beer)"
"I always love having a newcastle brown ale because it tastes so good when it hits the lips."
"Overall, I'm disappointed. Not what I remembered from a couple years ago before I started rating. I wouldn't but this again (I'm glad it was a gift from a thoughtful friend). Maybe if I served it warmer and let it breathe more I could have raised this to mediocrity."
"drinkability - Not a bad tasting beer, drank it at Long Horn , poured from the bottle. Worth a try."
"D: Easy to drink... not really bloating, and full bodied enough. Not a bad drink at all. Not a favourite, but not something to turn down."
"This is an okay beer - for a bigger name brand. It has a dark appearance and a somewhat strong smell to it. It has a nutty flavor, but it doesn't mask the alcohol enough to make it truly good. It's a drinkable beer. As another reviewer put it, it's a good standby beer if nothing else."
"Pours a clean copper/ mohogony color with a tan head. In the aroma, sweet small nuttiness and just a hint of fruit. In the taste, sweet small malty fruitiness. A smooth mouthfeel and a sweet fruitiness in the aftertaste. Easy to drink, it nothing fantastic, ok, a good stand by."
"Had this in a bottle form at Bonefish Grill in Pine Brook on Route 46... In my opinion, an awesome, easily drinkable brew that went down smooth and very refreshing... appearance was earthy brown, with a brown ale smell that included a slight toffee and caramel presence... tatse complemented the aroma, with brown sugar and toffee flavors that was very pleasing and satisfying... perhaps the ultimate session brew... went down like water with a refreshing taste that was very appealing... would definitely try this agiain... nothing exotic or above and beyond, but this is a solid, inescapable, time-honored brew that demands respect and recognition... Definitely recommended..."
"Pours an orange amber in color with an average head, and little lacing. The smell is sweet malts and caramel. The taste is also quite sweet with some nuts, and more caramel malts and a rather crisp finish. The mouthfeel is good while not being particularly watery but retains a good amount of drinkability. This one gets better the warmer it is, and a good stepping stone to better beer"
"Drinkability- A great beer to have a few of but not my choice if I was going to drink a lot."
"Poured this from a clear 12 oz bottle. Fairly dark reddish brown with very little head. Moderate lacing, but doesn't stick very well. Smell is very peculiar. Aside from a bit of skunk, there are some malts, but the smell is mostly...hygienic. It smells sterile, almost like latex. Taste is pretty weak. Very little flavor at first. Still a very sterile-tasting drink. Some burnt malts and nut flavors come in a little later. Mouthfeel is comparable to soda. Pretty thin and very fizzy. Leaves my mouth pretty dry. Not very refreshing at all. Just a lackluster beer overall."
"Drinkability: I'd have three."
"This is a great beer to eat with steak, ribs and heartier meals. A great beer for the New England winter time or anywhere cold for that matter."
"D: A straightforward brown ale with good drinkability, easily sessionable."
"That's funny this brown smells and tastes almost like a dark Euro lager with a sort of licorice edge to it. I really can't find much malt that resembles those normally found in an English brown. There are neither creamy or clean malts, just a sanitized sweetness. It's not a bad beer, but it's certainly not a good brown ale."
"Not too much head, which is a good thing if you dont like waiting 10 minutes to drink. Smooth as silk while going down, with a little bitter taste. A good session beer, you will have the abitly to drink a lot, but it will fill you up after a bit. A bit of nutty taste to it, good for the winter months. Overall, its my fav beer. not too thick, but not a very thin beer either. Drinking it from a tap is a world better than the bottle. Much sharper taste."
"Overall it's a decent beer. Very drinkable, it'd make a good session beer. I wish it had a bit more to it though, a little boring."
"Newcastle pours an orange red with a thin head that disappears quickly. The aroma is sweet and sulfury with vague hints of caramel malt. The flavor is sweet malt with a bit of toastiness, some sulfur but not nearly as much as in the aroma. The beer is smooth and drinkable, it almost can't be beat for that."
"D = Given the ABV and the smooth drinking nature, this is definitely a candidate for session drinking. However, if that is not your measure of drinkability, I'd say this is something I would choose over most macro beers, but probably after most microbrews."
"Pours a watery brown color with a rocky, and sudsy light brown head that disappears to leave no trace. Smell is a little sweet malty. Taste is sweet as well with a nice nutty aftertaste that lingers. Carbonation is nice and smooth making this an easy drink."
"Taste is light caramel, bitterness is low. It tastes more like a bottom fermented beer, with a clean profile that is a bit boring. Body is thin and it has low carbonation. There is nothing sticking out, but at the right temperature and at the right circumstances this is a very refreshing beer."
"D- All in all, an excellent choice and quite possibly a perfect session beer. It tastes great, goes down easy and has a very moderate ABV. If I had to describe this beer in one way, it would be perfect proportion. Not one aspect of it overpowers the rest and the flavors just seem to sit in perfect harmony in your mouth."
"12oz bottle drank straight from the bottle because I was at a pool hall and didn't care. Brown color, smells slightly nutty. Sweet taste with a nutty taste as well as some notes of vinegar that I often detect in English ales. Overall, this is a great beer to drink if you need a session brew. Also, I won five game sin a row so maybe the beer helped."
"Pours with a thin head, that vanishes fast. Theres a faint malt aroma; nothing all that strong. The beer is a reddish-brown color. It seemed darker than I remembered from the bottle version. Theres a smooth malt flavor with a bit of nuttiness. Very little hops. Not much after taste. This is one of the ""fall back"" beers locally when theres not other craft beers available."
"this beer is a classic. all those looking to try their first microbrew, I think this is a great one to start with. Newcastle pours a slightly hazy brown. The nose smells like skunk and weed. But in a good way. The taste is smooth and honeyish with slight hop and malt tones. It goes down like water but has a distinctly yorkshire ale taste. Not bitter in the least bit. A great micro to get hammered on, tastes like candy and smooth like water. If I was asked by a beginner to define a yorkshire brown, this is what i would give them first, then maybe some sammy smiths, old peculier, etc."
"Nice, semi-transparent brown body with sparse thin head tracing on glass...hints or green bottle metallics...the maltiness presents little uniqueness...tremendous carbonation! lively curving of the beer around the tongue...a bit of nut--and a lot of malt...a classic in brand name, smooth and aggressive...enjoyable and versatile, and mainstream enough to be served at barbecues and holiday parties..."
"Newcastle, or ""Brewcastle"" in some college circles, is very reliable. Not an impressive brown ale, but a classic one. Most American styles I find to be deeper and richer, but you know you can rely on what this one's going to give you."
"I prefer to drink this guy out of a can, but bottles are more common and also delicous. This is my favorite common beer. Delicious as can be and smooth as hell. Goes good with just about anything and the cans look extremely classy. It doesn't even look like a beer can! Great fun to be had here!"
"The bottle came from a freshly bought 12-pack, so don't expect the packaging to save the bottle from reeking. I'd skip the bottled version."
"D: Can drink it anytime with anything or nothing in any amount needed to be satisfied"
"Drinkability - this is not very good beer, and I would prefer something else. With all the skunky Euro hops and the cooked vegatables flavor, this came off as a dark hued mass market Euro Lager rather than any kind of brown ale."
"Not a bad ale overall, but there are some better, spicier offerings out there. Can't figure out why this one is more expensive, though..."
"This beer tastes much better on draft than in a bottle. The bottled version lack the carbonation and looks more like flat soda. On draft it has a thicker head and just overall a better taste. Kinda a nutty taste, but nothing overly special. Not very bitter, but not very sweet either.It seems to be a decent session beer, because you are not overwhelmed with anything. Overall it is not bad. I would order it again if I have limited choices."
"Reddish brown ale in an unfortunately clear bottle. Smell is fairly underwhelming. Taste is a malty sweetness that I enjoy. The taste thins out fairly quickly with little complexity, but I do enjoy the taste. Mouthfeel smooth but a bit thin. Fairly drinkable, though I'd rather they get dark bottles."
"Overall a servicable brown ale. Certainly not the best in the marketplace, especially considering the price."
"Drinkablity is high. Full of flavor but highly sessionable. The quintessential english brown, you can't go wrong with New Castle...unless it skunked due to the insufferable clear glass bottles!"
"Drinkability was average as the beer was smooth but because of the very sweet nature of the beer I couldn't see this as a session beer."
"Drinkability: I can drink these one after the other. Fantastic session beer, and tastes grest."
"Note: this seems like kind of a fragile beer. Seems to skunks easily, taking on an unpleasant grassy flavor."
"Nice brown ale, pours a good deep brown, although it has little lacing or head. Great aroma, a nice deep and robust scent with a nice mix of hops and malts. Nice deep taste, too, with a bit of a nutty flavor and a good, although almost too strong, bitter ending. Goes down fine, alhtough not as smooth as others."
"Was lucky enough to find this one on tap at dave and busters and ejoyed a couple glasses. This one is one of my normal everyday staples at home. But having it on tap fresh, trumps drinking it from the bottle. I truly love this beer and will continue to drink it. But I do have to say, the Tap is far better than the bottle. But other than that, it had all the same characteristics of my previous review."
"This brown ale pours a clean mahogany brown, with a sparse thin cap and fair amounts of carbonation. No lacing. Smell is malty with a faint bittering. Sweet and heavy. Nothing definitive. Taste is sweet and malty. Nutty. A touchy of hops. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Surprisingly refreshing. The beers most redeeming quality is its drinkability. A session favorite."
"D-I did not like this beer, maybe I purchased a bad bottle that was sitting in the sun for a couple of days. I'm not sure, but it was not very tasty at all."
"i hadn't had one for awhile, so i picked up a sixer to get thru this nasty weather ; pours a deep brownish-copper w/ a fluffy white head that dissapated quickly and left a little lacing in my glass ; a yeasty nose at first w/ some faint toasty malt present ; a rather crisp, thin flavor, but with some maltiness and a faint hop undertone ; light bodied w/ a good amount of carbonation, a dry finish as well ; a very drinkable brew, i should have got more..."
"On tap at Chilis. The color was transparent dark brown with a hint of red around the edges. Head was very meager and vanished within a few minutes. The aroma was just not there--probably because they served it very well chilled. The taste showcased sweet molasses and was malty with a touch of spice; and the hops, well not too much to speak of. Mouthfeel was fizzy, weak and watery. Finish was short and dry with a slight rubbing alcohol note. Better than the US macros, but not by much. I speculate that this product is subcontracted to some anonymous north American brewer. I this can't be the stuff they get on tap in GB. Overall: Look for other choices: Not recommended."
"This beer poured a reddish brown with almost no head. The smell isn't very strong at all with just a tiny bit of maltyness and perhaps a little skunkiness that could be due to the clear bottle and the fact I live a fair ways from England. Thankfully the taste doesn't reflect the faint skunkiness of the smell, with a decent amount of maltiness and a very small amount of hops. I am very underwhelmed by this beer. The only thing I think this beer really has going for it is how drinkable it is, I imagine it would be a great college or bar beer if you could find it cheap enough. I'd be willing to give this beer another shake in another format if I ever see it on tap or in a can, but I think I'm done with it from a bottle."
"Drinkability: This was a good beer for me while I was in college because it was better than the $9.99 30-pack of Keystone Ice. At this point in my life I'm not overly impressed with this beer. Maybe I'll try it again on tap sometime, but probably not. There are bigger and better fish to fry in my opinion. However if you like non-bitter, smooth beers, you might like this one."
"Drinkability : an average beer in the style brown ale, pleasant and well balanced."
"D: Overall, a pretty good beer. It has a very unique taste, but is still very drinkable."
"I have heard and read a lot about this ale and thought I had to travel out and far or get some one of my UK beer contacts to buy it for me haha. I stumbled upon it by luck at Beercellar which is nearby Oosters. I believe that a number of pubs in Singapore. I have been looking for this beer, so naturally I grabbed one bottle to go. This beer surprisingly poured out without much head; only a layer of foam with clinging lacing; color was a dark amber brown that can still barely see through. Smell was strong on malts with some nuttiness and some faint fruits. The taste was hugely malts with little fruit undertones and I think there was a little of apple which kind of became grapes as it progresses into a rather faint after taste. Also in the after taste was the malty profile which seems to be the feature of this beer which is nothing really special. The mouthfeel was really commonplace and nothing impressive too; a slightly above average carbonation greets me upon entry and the mouthfeel was kind of watery otherwise as it is fairly light on the body and there was no creamy smoothness. The drinkabilty here was someone water like smoothness with the exception of tingling carbonation as it goes down. Generally, an OK beer better than the local macros but definitely not impressive (I will choose a Stella Atois on the tap anytime) but still, I am glad I managed to find it and give it a try."
"Drinkability: Fairly bland and yawn-inducing."
"A little slick, thin body with a medicinal finish. Not great, but beery enough at certain bars."
"Pours a deep amber brown color with an average off-white head, some light lacing left on the glass. The smell is of diacetyl and not much else. The brew starts off buttery, works its way to grainy, and finishes a bit watery. Some light hops in the end to add some bitterness. The feel is light, almost watery, fizzy. The drinkability is ok, nothing very offensive though I am not a bit fan of diacetyl. Its very light so it is easy to swig back a few. This used to be one of my favorites but as I become more of a beer geek, the less I enjoy this brew."
"Pours clear brown with a medium head, some lacing on surface and sides. Aroma is sweet carmel and some herbal hops. Taste is nice and malty- carmel and hazelnut notes. A touch of British hops. Balanced and smooth. Mouthfeel is medium to light. Not overly carbonated. Seems about right for this beer. Quite drinkable- sessionable in fact. Solid commonly available British beer."
"nonetheless, a decent-enough brew and apparently a standard for many. i can understand why - as long as you don't rely on those damned clear bottles..."
"Got a hankerin' for a good pub ale? Newcastle definitely fits the bill for me! It's available at most decent bars, if not on tap then definitely in a bottle. I don't often go for it, but I always am pleased when I order one up. It's got a really classic, true-to-style taste."
"Color is a nice clear brown with a thin white head. The smell is nothing to write home about but the taste is malty with a sweet hint and no aftertatse. Very smooth and very drinkable. A good beer to have if you have some friends coming over and you're just hanging out."
"Newcastle is a very old and very solid beer. It has an acceptable appearance with a general lack of smell. However, the taste is very malty and smooth. The mouthfeel is the best in the business and incredibly smooth. This makes the drinkability very very good. This beer would be a perfect compliment with a rich, chocolate dessert."
"The ale is a beautiful clear brown, rather inviting. Aroma is strongly malty and pleasant if not complex. Flavor is rich, malty, with no bitterness or other hop hints. Smooth, delightful, plain and simple, a good beer for a party or as a companion to a tasty meal."
"Overall: This is a tasty beer. Like mentioned above the malt is a hearty malt with a slight sweetness and just enough hops to balance this beer out. Unlike some other beers that are tasty but begin to be overpowering after time this beer is a soild well made beer tha can be drank with out it getting ""old'. well done."
"Highly drinkable, There are better browns, but not near as drinkable or widely available. A good choice."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and drinkablility is very easy. The type of beer that you can enjoy a few of easily. This is one of my all-time favorites. Before all the micros my brother and I would share a case when we would get together. Enjoy!"
"D: I find this beer to be much better off the tap than in bottles, it's much fresher and full-flavoured, as opposed to the bottle, where it is much more pedestrian and stale."
"The Newcastle is a dark brown on the top of the pour and a little clearer on the bottom. It holds a nice head that leaves its sea foam as the glass empties. The odor is malty to the nose. Taste is a smooth balance between the malt and hops but leans a little to the maltiness. Newcastle leaves a little bitter taste at the back of the mouth. It would be redundant to call it a classic of its style since it has been around since the 1800's."
"Highly drinkable for a brown ale, does not make you too full like most others"
"I really like this beer. Its cheap, easy to find and something different from your normal macro lager. This beer pours brown with a decent head. Its a really decent brown ale. Mouthfeel is almost to watery, but really pretty good. Decent head nice lacing. I could drink it all night."
"Newcastle was my first introduction into good beers 20 years ago and it has remained one of my favorites ever since. It pours a beautiful brown color and is easy on the eyes. The resulting head is sturdy and tenacious sticking around well after the third or forth pull. The taste is pure malty goodness. It is as smooth as the label suggests and beckons you to repeat the procedure until you have drained either your wallet or the six pack. Enjoy!"
"Pretty easy to find kind of beer. Really easy to drink and pretty smooth. Has a light malt charactor to it. Pours cleanly, very brown with an okay head. Not a whole lot to it really. Just a good cheap beer thats really easy to drink but still has a decent flavor to it."
"Nice ""BROWN"" color....decent head....good, SMOOTH and slightly sweet flavor. Good flavor yet very drinkable, do to the ""thinness"" of the ale. They do a good job with this one, I believe. It has flavor...not a TON...but enough...and yet it's still thin and a tad watery for the drinkability. I love it. Wish it wasn't normally like $30 a case though! I'd buy it again..when it's on sale again...and recommend it to anyone who's not a hop-head...'cause this doesn't have a trace of that flower friends! I like it and think you will too! Looks like a freakin' bottle of rootbeer!!!! Neat one to serve dinner guests. Happy sippin' my drunk friends! Saaalute!!!"
"Pours a medium brown color with a head that fades soon after the pour. Aroma is malty up front. Some sweetness. Taste is pretty much the same except that it thins out towards the back of the throat. Sort of underwhelming and sweeter than needed at times. An average brown ale that is just a step up from macro lagers but not something I'd consider drinking often."
"D- I think that this light, flavorful beer is good, definately something that one could put back a few of in a sitting, just not me personally. It was completely different than what I thought it would be but that isn't a bad thing. A solid brew that I would have on occasion but I don't think I'd have more than 1 or 2 at a time. I may like it even better on tap but do give it a try!"
"Medium brown with medium carbonation. Thin white head decent retention. Smell mainly of sweet caramel malts. Taste is simple and good. Caramel malts and a minimal hop presence. Nutty finish. Mouthfeel is light and smooth. Pretty good drinkability here as well. An alright beer that brings back memories."
"A decent brown ale but that's it. Decent. Nice session brew though."
"D- refreshingly sweet, this is a good thirst quencher despite its dark color. seems to be a daytime or evening beer though because after midnight, for some odd reason, i rarely finish a newcastle brown. unless i'm extremely thirsty and there's no other option."
"D- This is my go to brown session ale. Very drinkable if you are in the mood to kick back a few brown ales."
"Attractive brown color with nice head that didnt last very long. A very drinkable beer, which makes it a good session beer. Not outstanding, but a good beer. Taste is nutty but has a sweet ending. Aroma is of malt and nuts and also with caramel notes. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. This is one beer that has become available everywhere."
"D: On a hot day, I usually reach for this mainstay. It's always a treat to serve this to the uninitiated and look at the pleasantness that it brings. It's the tops and always a grocery store definite."
"Im still looking for a english brown ale that i can really have more often(this is not the one). Not a bad beer very good to try."
"D-I could probably drink these all night. It was a little pricy, but under the right circumstances i would pay the money and enjoy."
"An overall good beer...nothing exciting, but definitely a decent session beer in a pinch. I actually prefer it out of the bottle (don't hate, this is an extreme exception) because the narrow opening of the bottle cuts down on the smell and puts the malty sweetness right upfront on the tongue."
""
"D  Wouldnt be too much of a hurry to try another bottle. Definitely would consider having it on tap."
"Had this beer the other evening with a steak at a local resteraunt. This was the closest this establishment offered in the way of a more robust beer. Offered a non chilled glass and the pour was nice with a very slight head. Had good malty aroma. Mouth feel is crisp and sweet and finishes with just a slight bite of hops. Overall a decent beer for when sophisticated brews are not on hand"
"note: even my bmc drinking dad was unimpressed by this, stating ""it doesn't taste like anything."""
"D: This must be better on tap, but that's probably the only way I'll have another anytime soon - well, unless they scrap the clear bottle."
"and I am EVENTUALLY going to buy myself a decent mug and be able to give a proper review or two."
"I wonder if this bottle was light struck or just old. Not really skunked but not much flavor at all. I haven't had this in a while but don't remember it being this bland. I'll have to grab a pint on tap to compare."
"man i love can night at the local watering hole cause of this beer ok well this and PBR about the best beers in a can you can get just about anywhere anyways pours light brown low head nothing to impresive there smells like sweet beer taste is most excelent sweet malty and slight bitter to close almost perfect for the can get this beer anywhere beer mouth feel is a little weak to me but the drinkability makes up for it in most cases this beer is just ok if its in a bottle but when its in a can you cant go wrong but thats just my opinion"
"Quite drinkable."
"Brown with a nice red tint. Small head on pour that immediately collapses to a collar with some lacing. The nose offers lightly toasted malt with grassy, floral hops and a faint cherry note at the end. The taste starts with a malt sweetness that has a faint caramel note to it. Earthy, floral hops provide a slight bite. Has some dark fruit flavor (cherry in particular). The finish has an earthy bitterness and a sweetness that I associate with corn beers like MGD. Cabonation is slightly crisp but gives the beer a rough mouthfeel. It results in a beer that doesn't feel thin despite the medium-light body. The beer's drinkability is harmed by the unpleasant corn taste."
"Dark red color with a small head that quickly dissolves, but with a fair lacing. Malty aroma of caramel with hint of nuts. Has a sweet taste of malt. Light body with a watery texture and average carbonation. Slight metallic finish. Why do they have to use glucose syrup to make this beer?"
"This ale is easy to drinkmaking a good session beer."
"i dont know why but this brew i can always count on, probably the most smoothest brown ales you can ever consume, the caramel and coffee like flavors bring out the best out of this fine ale, this is the perfect beer to let someone try thats never had an ale or dark beer, because its damn good!"
"Drinkability- I love this beer it is one of my favorites. I recommend this beer to everyone who asks!"
"If you're looking for a good beer you can find anywhere, I would definitely go with this one over a lot of the others."
"This beer pours a dark brown colour into the glass with not a lot of head. The aroma is not all that strong which surprised me given the strong colouration. The taste had a sugary tinge to it that made the beer unpleasant to me. This is not a beer that I will try again in the near future."
"Draft. This brew poured a light brown with orange tones visible through the edges of the glass. Slight tan head that quickly fades. Minimal lacing. Very light body and mouthfeel. Light carbonation with a subtle taste of nuts and roasted malts. The flavor is light roasted malts. Not much else. I was hoping for more, but this beer was average at best."
"The real magic of this beer is that it's incredibly easy drinking, has flavor, and is available friggin everywhere. While I may have been a fan years ago, much has been learned since then."
" Assuming there's nothing on tap that sparks your interest or taste buds, you can drink this beer all night knowing you made a wise enough decision."
"Pours out a woody brown with a thick head that leaves sheets of lacing down the glass. Smells of a mix of malt sweetness and herbal hopes. Not too bad. Overall, this tastes decent enough with some caramel flavors and a touch of diacetyl. Has a strange saccharine feel to the flavor, tough. Mouthfeel is kind of watery on this one. This is certainly drinkable enough, but it isn't that interesting or well made."
"This beer was a major disappointment. I would describe it as bland, tasteless and watery. It sort of reminds minds me of a Michelod Dark, which pretty much explains why I'll never buy this beer again. There is nothing complex or interesting about this beer."
"This rating is for a pint of newcastle served from the Griffon on Charleston bay in Charleston, SC. Best place to drink newcastle, in the US."
"Poured from the bottle, comes out a classic brown, deep in color, mild head and retention. Smell is good, with a nice nutty and caramel scent coming through, but those flavors come through even more in taste, which is the highlight of this beer. Mouthfeel is fairly light, which has its positives and negatives. All in all, very nice and enjoyable."
"This, and Killians, were what I used to think of as good beers back in college. I'm glad my palate has extended itself just a touch. Appearance is standard English brown, clear and brown with amber touches. Just a touch of head that goes away pretty fast. Nose is mild, some slight roasted malt. Taste is okay. Mostly the same as the nose, maybe a very slight hint of nuts as well, and a little bit stronger. Feel is pretty thin and nothing too interesting. Overall, this one is pretty unremarkable. Have advertised themselves into a 'good beer' category that they don't deserve."
"This is one of my favorite everyday beers. Englands most purchased beer. It is important to know that this beer has a variety of flavors depending on the tempeture. More hop flavor is present from the target hops and a smooth malt flavor comes out at colder temps. As the beer warms to a cool temp, the hop flavor becomes less intense and the malt flavor protrudes. Excellent beer on a cooler summer night or with barbeque. Infact throw half a bottle in with some barbeque sauce or marinade some chicken with it. And if you ever get the chance, 45th and broadway in NYC has a enormous newcastle advertisement on the corner there... a beautiful sight to see, prost!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" tan head over the clear brownish amber brew. Head lasts well, with ample sticky lacing. Aroma is sweet with a butterscotch tinge. Taste is malty sweetness upfront, with a touch of citrus in the middle, and a lightly hoppy close. Mouthfeel was is crisp and clean, and this one is iminently drinkable. Alweays a nice option when macros seem to dominate the scene."
"Had this brown ale on tap at The Bitter End. Wasn't in the mood for Guinness or Bass and this fit the bill. Very little head with a good brown color. A bit of a bitter smell. Good mix of sweet and bitter. This is a good fail safe beer if the options on tap are minimal."
"Anything from England has got to be good. Oddly in a clear bottle though protected 100% by the carton of the twelver. Pricy but like I saidnever had a bad brew from England. Bottle smell is chicory, honey, coffee and slight vinegar like most english brews. In the trusty chalice it foamed like a champ, 1 inch head in a 12 oz. chalice, big bubbled and full of structure. Very clingy. Color is a translucent dark metallic brown. Taste is sweet and toasty like a smores but not that sweet. Mouthfeel is good carbonation but not too much. This head really clings. A very drinkable brew, highly recommended. I think I'll have another."
"D- Because of the balance and wateryness, you could drink several... but why would you want to when there are so many better beers out there? If you want something like this, try a Sam Smith's nut brown or a JW dundee's amber lager. Both are far better."
"Drinkability- Goes down easy, could easily get a few of these down, very drinkable."
"Not a fancy or subtle beer, but it also isn't cheap tasting. This is what I drink when I just want a good beer and I don't want a workout of my senses. A well made, very drinkable beer, and a solid example of the Brown ale style. Recommended."
"While this is not the best brown ale I have a had it certainly is a good beer I would have again. I think brown ales are one of the most sessionable ales around. See the article in the May BA mag."
"D - This is the very definition of a sessioin ale...low abv, mild well-balanced flavors, light body, tasty but not very complex. Can get a bit boring though. After two of these at Salud last night, I was ready for something else."
"Transparent mahogany, head of the one-finger variety, and no retention whatsoever. The smell lets you know little more that the fact that you're about to drink a beer. Overall the flavor is of caramel malt, and a surprisingly slight tinge of the metallic quality that typically repels me from English brews. Mouthfeel is, well, nice. Totally unremarkable, but satisfying with no real flaws. Superbly drinkable, especially at a gig where this is their idea of a premium beer."
"Overall i dont think ill be picking this up again. Might be able to enjoy it with a nice pot roast or something along those lines but not by itself."
"Have seen this on tap and in bottles so many times, but for whatever reason I have avoided it. I found it to be highly drinkable, with a smooth and sweet finish. Lots of caramel and sugar come through, and the carbonation is medium to low. Let this beer warm and enjoy it on a summer night. Delicious."
"Drinkability - Medium bodied, goes down well."
"D- It is unoffensive but still pretty boring and lacks a lot of character."
"This one pours a nice copper brown color, with some head, and a little bit of lacing. The smell is a little nutty, maybe a little caramely too. The taste is a little thin, watery, on the dry side as far as mouth feel, a tinge of some sweeter malts, a little bit more bitter on the back end. It does have a slightly medicinal, nutty quality, that is okay, but not overly enjoyable. It totally lacks any carbonation, and you won't find hops anywhere in this beer. This is one of those beers which 20 years ago was more highly rated than it is today, because you can find much, much better brown ales from almost anywhere. It's not a bad beer to revisit, and for some people, there might be some sentimental connotations to Newcastle, since it was one of the earliest British ales with mass availablility on this side of the Atlantic. As with most things, time has passed this one by."
"Maybe it would work fine with food, but just on it's own this hardly an impressive beer. At times it's downright annoying in the flavor department. It's better than I remembered it, but that's not saying much."
"While I prefer Bass, you can't go wrong with Newcastle and its even a little bit cheaper which you can't complain about."
"This is a beer I could see having at a pub when one is more interested in the company than the beer. Certainly not bad, but nothing exciting here."
"Pours a clear red/brown, thin off white head forms, some lacing, decent retention, settles out to the sides of the glass. Smell is sweet, nutty, some caramel and fruits, not too complex, but half decent. Taste is sweet up front, lots of fruit character, little bit of roast and caramel through the middle, some bitterness, but more of a citrus character in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Not bad, but overall pretty average."
"It's a nice ""gateway"" beer for people who don't like beer or aren't accustomed to hops. I've had lots of success getting non-beer drinkers to drink this."
"This is certainly a decent beer.... maybe a touch too sweet to have more than a few.... kinda need a bitter chaser to cut through the lingering sweetness."
"Final Statement: After the somewhat lackluster smell, who would have thought that would be its high point? I used to enjoy this one a lot back in the day. After laying off it for 6 months or so I can really see how far my tastes have come. This beer isn't drain worthy, but it's one that should be left to the novice drinker. I don't knock these beers because I owe my appreciation for finer craft beers to crossover beers like Newcastle Brown."
"This is a good mild flavored session beer."
"This isn't how I remember Newcastle Brown, someone has taken the flavours away, it looks the same, but everything else has gone, what a pity."
"D: I know it's fairly common to trash this beer because it ain't what it used to be, but I can't really speak to what it used to be. What it is now: a decent, easy-drinking brown ale that's pretty widely available both in bars and stores. It is FAR, FAR better on tap, and my unscientific opinion involves blaming the clear bottles. It's just too much of a crapshoot to buy this bottled, and there's a skunkiness in the aroma (but not the flavor) when it ages a bit. On tap, it's actually quite nice, though usually served too cold."
"I guess I have been spoiled by other brown ales, so I was kind of let down by this one. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a light brown, forming a very thin white head, that quickly faded, leaving very light lacing on the glass. Very little carbonation. Expecting a sweet malty nutty aroma, I was disappointed to find the aroma very skunky, with little notice of the malt. The taste is better, but not great. Sweet malt, maybe a hint of hops, and a slight nutty flavor. Mouthfeel is not as thick as expected. IMO, this is like the Budweiser of brown ales. Not really bad, but with so many better brown ales available, why settle?"
"All in all one of my all time favorites!"
"P.S. I like this beer better on tap than from the bottle!"
"New Castle Brown Ale was my first brown ale ever. It was acutally the first beer I ever drank in full. At first sip it has a smooth taste and texture. It has just the right amount of fizz in it. And yes, you can even drink it warm in case there is a black out. It is best to drink this wonderful ale at around 45degrees F. I usually pour it from a bottle into a room temp glass to achieve the optimum setting. Many people are scared of such a dark beer, but it is the smoothest beer in all the land."
"Overall this brown ale is average. I would drink a newcastle again, but I won't be buying it for myself."
"some carmel malt with a touch of sweetness as well. Bitter earthy hops in this beer also. I failed to detect any nuttiness or butteriness. Not what I expected in an ale. With the bitterness and high carbonation it tasted more like a euro Pilsner than an ale."
"I love the appearance of Newcastle in it's classic clear bottles. You can actually see what your going to be drinking. I wish all beer were in clear bottles. This has to be one of the most drinkable beers i've ever had. I could drink this at any time or point in the year. Totally refreshing and great with any meal. Sweet malt and honey taste with a slight hop bitterness on the finish. Creamy medium-bodied texture that goes down smooth. Depending on how hard you pour it will determine the size of the head. A gentle pour will not leave much of a head, and leave minimal lacing. The mouthfeel could be a bit more crisper. Overall great drinkable beer that shouldnt offend the lightest of beer drinkers."
"Just didnt like the skunkyness and it ruined the beer in my opinion."
"D: Boring and straight forward beer. It really does need to warm up to let the flavors out."
"The taste is more of a nutty flavor, with a thin body and a slightly bitter finish. It is quite smooth though, and fairly balanced. As far as English browns go, it's slightly better than average. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but not bad. Overall it's a drinkable beer that has it's strong and weak points. Give it try."
"Much better than I remembered. This was my first contact with proper english ale back in the eighties, and my first love (when it comes to beer, that is). For me it lost it's allure way back, but maybe I should think again before judging this as an average, not so exciting ale. It's really drinkable."
"D - Overall a pretty tasty beer, not bad but not all that interesting."
"i like this beer. I've had a few big newcastle drafts in my day(clearing of throat)...this beer has a distinctive taste with bitter chocolate notes and a grassy bitter hopping towards the finish. the roasty malt flavor hits you immediately when it touches the palate...good....not too overpriced for an import....found a place in Ga. still selling at 7.99 a six...WOW. I need someone to design a computer program to find the best deals on beer....hmmm...back to that later....this beer's strong points are it's distinctive taste and it's drinkability...light for the style..but different...and preferable over others like Jdundee's and some other accessible brown's. Not as robust as 'Pete's Wicked' but perhaps a little better balanced. The only negatives are the light body and a little metallic astringency in the aftertaste...can be expected when the demand and quantities are so high."
"Drinkability: Great everyday ale. I have found beers that go down easier but this is still a favorite."
"Pours a dark red, with about a fingers worth of light brown foam on top. Head does last a bit. Smells of all grain toast, butter, peanut butter, and something a bit sugary sweet. Taste was quite surprising. Earthy bitterness, some dark fruits, like plums and figs, plenty of malts and butter, and a nutty aftertaste. Though not peanut, like the scent would suggest. Mouthfeel seems a bit... Sticky? Reminded me of sugar water. This would make a good session brew. It's drinkable, unoffensive, and not bland."
"Kind of a boring beer, leaves me wanting for something to liven up the taste buds. Not overly impressed with this one."
"Newcastle comes out of the bottle a dark reddish/brown with no bubbles( low carbination) , very clear and has a very thin head that quickly disappears. It has a woody scent that is mildly sweet, in fact it kind of reminds me of caramel. It really rolls on to your tongue smooth with a less than semi- sweet taste but it has a pretty sharp aftertaste. not a bad beer over all."
"Poured with a good chestnut brown color. Just a little and quickly collapsing foam. Ther smell was sour and spicy with a hint of licorice. There was not much taste but at the same time it was not watery. There were strong bread notes, bitter hops and a hint of caramel. Newcastle Brown Ale is a very British beer and both the smell and the taste brought back memories of my youthful and underaged exploration of south London pubs in the mid-seventies."
"Drinkability is average for the style."
"There are certainly better brown ales out there, but Newcastle is a safe bet and is very drinkable. Unfortunately, my local grocery store just upped the price so that it's about $20 a 12-pack, so it's not really worth it anymore."
"Don't drink and review."
"Appearance is good, it's a nice light brown. I had a very nice lacing on the glass which lasted the whole brew. The smell is also good. The taste is where this one takes off for me. I thought the taste was very nice, very smooth, I enjoyed the flavor. The mouthfeel was also very nice. It was a silky/smooth feel. The drinkability is pretty high for me because it's enjoyable and I could drink this one all night."
"I regard this as a great beginner beer as this was the one that got me interested in craft beers. Easy to drink, even if a bit watery. Pours a dark brown with a decent head. Has a fruity aroma with a strong bread/pretzel-like taste. Finishes somewhat sweet. This is my backup beer; I can usually count on its being on draft at decent restaurants, but I will choose a local brew or more exotic import over this when available. Still, not a bad brew."
"I tried this beer at a restuarant and they were serving from a keg. I bought a six at a store and was not disappointed. I am now mixing it in the rotation. I liked the overall taste of the beer compared to the majority of the beers that are sold in the area in which I live. ( bud light, coors light etc..) The first one is good the second is better. The color is a nice brown and the taste smooth not too bitter. This is a nice session beer."
"Pretty good session beer but there are better choices with a little more flavor."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin on carbonation but has a decent chewiness in the end. Still, this one is a legend due to its drinkability and it doesn't fail on that count. A definite session brew that doesn't require much thought."
"Not going back there."
"This is a decent brown ale I enjoy often. It pours are dark copperish yielding a thin light tan head and has little retention. The smell isn't too strong but with a bit of malty sweetness. The taste is a good solid malty, with only a hint of hops. It's not too full bodied and isn't over carbonated, and is very drinkable for me as it's often the only choice I'll take at many establishments!"
"Alright. Nothing ultra exciting. I imagine this is much thicker and more awesome when poured from a tap in the UK."
"Very drinkable and undemanding."
"Pours a nice brown color with a decent white head into a pint glass. A sweet caramel aroma is present, not very strong though. Taste is pretty sweet and a little nutty and toasted as well. In my opinion this is definitely a better beer on tap than bottled. Definitely drinkable when not much else is around."
"Poured a thick dark brown with no real head but some decent lace. Smell was of caramel and nutty Malt, with a bit of a hoppy hit in there. Taste followed suit well. Taste very full and actually well balanced. This one was always one of my favs before getting into the craft brew and still deserves a good reputation."
"Pours a deep redish brown. Head is light and short-lived. Not much aroma to speak of. Both the taste and mouthfeel are a bit light and watery for me. Not a whole lot of carbonation. Maybe the watery mouthfeel and lack of carbonation are supposed to account for the advertised ""smoothness"" of this beer. Taste is sweet up front, finishes quietly and has little aftertaste. It certainly isn't bad, but it's nothing special, either. There is nothing to complain about, but there is nothing really to recommend it strongly, either."
"Really nothing special -- not bad, not great. Particularly for the style. Many better options out there, but it's a better call if you're in a place with a limited selection. Not as good as I remember from when I was in my 20s and this seemed like a true premium. I didn't know much then. But perhaps this was a bad tap line too."
"In short, a very nondescript, but pleasant, brown ale. The kind you could share with mom."
"Notes: As I wrote above, there was a time -- when I was first getting into the whole craft beer scene -- when I drank lots of Newcastle. It makes sense in a lot of ways, as it was a ubiquitous find, not terribly challenging in flavor -- yet dark in appearance, and was light in body and so easily sessioned. I believe BA MRMOJORISIN's dad once said that Newcastle was the Brown Ale against which all others are measured. I understand the sentiment, as this is probably the first Brown Ale that many will try, but now that I've had plenty of better Brown Ales, I recognize this beer's weaknesses. Generally, I prefer a beer with a bit more heft -- in nose, flavor and feel. Still, it's drinkable and in some settings you can do far worse."
"My old favorite bar, The Alley (now closed down :( ) began serving this, which was awesome, since before then I only bought 12 packs for the house. I like this beer alot. It does have a somewhat funky smell, but I think that may be due to the clear bottle. The taste is great and is what a brown ale should taste like. It is highly drinkable. Most of the rednecks I hang out with like it once they try it. I'm the beer snob of the group, so I try to enlighten them with good beer, instead of the same ol macro-beer chug fest we usually have on weekends. If you want a good English Brown Ale, give this a shot"
"Carbonation is just right, it goes down easy, and the aftertaste is very mild, this is what I like about this beer. Pretty sessionable, worth a try. Cheers"
"It is a drinkable beer that is available in a lot of pubs in Scotland in bottles, I have never seen it on draught in Scotland (it may exist I just haven't seen it since I tried it for the first time 8 years ago). Worth a try, it won't win any awards or become many peoples favourite beer, but a good all round beer that most people would enjoy."
"Drinkability - It's worth trying, especially on a cool evening where you want a medium bodied beer."
"Nice, dark body with a white head that was fairly retained. Fruity, malty smell kind of reminiscient of an EPA. A nice, malty, honey taste with a slightly bitter aftertaste. A pretty decent mouthfeel although I expected it to be thicker. Pretty drinkable."
"D- Good flavour, reasonable ABV and light feel make this the definition of a session beer."
"I like BA GPHarris description of Newcastle as a gateway beer. It definitely was among my first crossovers into the wonderful world of craft brews."
"Newcastle is among my favorites - it's a a well rounded (if not distinguished) brown ale thats very easy drinking. I find that many people who typically drink low taste American lagers are still able to appreciate it, which is important to me since I have lots of young friends."
"Drank fairly good, just not comples enough to hold your attention. Had this in england & to be honest it didn't do much for me there. My wife, however loves this stuff"
"d - this was one of my gateway beers (as probably yours) and it has a special place in my heart. still solid if you don't have many other options. much better on tap than from a bottle."
"Obviously there's better examples of the style out there, but usually they aren't nearly as readily available."
"D: I had this beer on Tap and it was served in an extra tall Pilsner which really let me enjoy the beer. I found it to be quite decent ale."
"Easy drinking. This is a good beer to fall back on when not at a brew pub."
"12 oz clear bottle poured into an Imperial pint glass. Not a whole lot of head with this, and it quickly recedes to a filmy lace. Color is a dark nutty brown with a tinge of red. In all honesty, not much to look at. Smell is hazelnut. Taste is very nutty, mildly bitter, and a bit buttery. Mouthfeel is fairly light and smooth. A few of my friends swear by Newcastle as the go to session beer. It's not bad, but there are others I prefer."
"Body is crystal clear ruby brown, with a slight beige head that dissolves quickly to barely a lid, even after a rocky pour. Aroma is sweet, caramel-toasty. A hint of butter makes the scent seem thicker and somehow savory overall. Taste is cool and sweet, quite grainy and just the slightest touch roasty. No perceptible hop bitterness or flavor at all. Ah, the roast aspect comes in a bit more prominently in the aftertaste, which is otherwise smooth and clean. Body is light, bordering on thin, and only slightly carbonated, which complements the light body very well. Maybe a touch too sweet to be a true session beer, but otherwise quite amenable to high-quantity quaffing. This is more a commercial standby than a classic of the genre, but there aren't any metallic aftertastes or cloying sweetness that sometimes plague commercial beers... quite well done overall."
" Wavz"
"Pours a hazy, light brown with a thin head and a bit of retention. The smell is slightly nutty but unremarkable. The taste is quite sweet and watery, like a light syrup. The past several that I have had have been painfully close to crossing into being labeled as skunked. In comparison to most beers, this one actually lacks carbonation and is quite watery. Average drinkability, like the rest of it."
"I poured this 12oz bottle into a glass beer mug. Its dark brown body that does not offer much in the way of a head. In both smell and taste it is carmely and almost nutty. A bit of fruitiness to it as well. It is a bit bitter and it seems that it could be a bit more balanced. Fairly drinkable. Would like to give it a shot on tap."
"Drinkability: An accessible beer, especially for those with a sweet tooth, but unremarkable."
"There is a lot of mythology associated with this famous beer (just like Guinness). It certainly is not a bad brew; quite drinkable (it is what it is!)."
"Drinkability: This would be much more drinkable if I didn't detect metal. Decently smooth and clean."
"This beer poured a clear brown color with a thin head which dissipated quickly. The smell is sweet and caramel like. The taste is caramel and sweet. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with noticeable carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is, well..awesome!!"
"""Yea, I'll have a La Fin Du Mond. You don't have that? Just gimmie a Newcastle."""
"Looks like a great beer. But frankly the smell and taste surprised me. Smell was very faint but it didn't smell necesarily bad. I thought I was tasting a light lager, too. But as for me I like light lagers to an extent because they're drinkability and smoothness is above average. I wouldn't mind drinking this again."
"Mouthfeel is a bit too thin. The drinkability could be great if in the right mood. I usually can't session brown ales but one easily could be, if one were so inclined. Overall a decent brew that is really much better on draft. Also remember to let it warm up a little."
"I used to think this one was something special. Now it strike me as pretty bland. It was highly carbonated from the tap, too much so. Light brown, attractive. Not much going on with the smell. Initial tastes were sour, with a hint of malt sweetness. No hoppiness. After a couple sips, my interest fades fast. Would drink again for a thirst quencher, so long as I wasn't paying the premium import price on it."
"Taste  Far superior to American macro-brews but not very complex or remarkable in itself. Sweet with mild hoppy bitterness with some malt. Aftertaste of hazelnuts, molasses, and something else I cannot quite hit."
"Perhaps I was fooled by the color. The color reminded me of brandy, and perhaps that is what led me to expect a richer flavor experience."
","
"Pours dark brown with a small off white head. The nose has some malt to it, maybe a little maple syrup? The tastes follows through with this, and adds some hops too. It finishes a little syrupy and heavy on the tongue. Has some nice carbonation, and a decent moutfeel, but a bit heavy on the finish."
"It pours with a one inch head that did not last and It has a med red caramel color. Aroma is very light hopp malt mix, very smooth, very good balance hopps and malt also slightly sweet tasting. And lastly not much carbbonatation, but thats not a bad thing it is very drinkable and would buy it again."
"Taste is thin caramel malt. Some underlying skunk. Mouth is crisp with a sweetish finish. The skunk is so present in the Newcastle bottles, it just has to be considered in the review. Mediocre at best in bottle, I recommend on tap if at all."
"This poured to a very light brown-orange color, with medium tan head that lingered, and left a little lacing. Aroma was not real pronounced, but what was there were hints of malty nuts and honey, which then carried over into the flavor, and led to a nice, smooth finish. Overall, this was a mild brown ale, which is maybe why I liked it, as Im not of a fan of this type of beer. Newcastle hit the mark."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- y (if i'm rich(session))"
"D- One every once in a while might be okay. Not something I would be drinking one-after-another. Just doesn't rub me the right way."
"Dark coppery brown color that you can look through and still read a newspaper. Light tan head that fades very quickly to a thin film, then nothing. Some roasted malt and nut aromas, but not much. Very little noteable hoppiness. The palate shows some sweetness and roasted malt/caramel character with a creamy texture to go with a short finish."
"Overall a decent beer but nothing exciting. This is another one that could be a good gateway brew."
"I'm not as impressed with this beer as I was when I first encountered it five or so years ago. Since then I've learned to enjoy many bigger, stronger beers, and coming back to this seems a bit of a letdown. But, for what it is it's great, and I'm sure I'll get a hankering for this again."
"A ""session"" brown ale. Nothing great, but easy enough to drink a few and still get characteristics of the style."
"Dark brown translucent body with almost no head to speak of, just a tan film. Smells like caramel mostly. Tastes sweet and smooth. Less carbonation present. Tastes pretty good, but weaker than I expected it to be... Still a palatable pleasant beer. Not something to seek out though."
"A few years ago this beer suddenly became ubiquitous. A testament more, I guess, to a good distribution network than overwhelming demand. It's a light brown similar to the darker cream sodas with a small head. Little aroma to speak of, it has maybe a touch of caramel. Taste is bland, sweet with a bare hint of herb deep in the background, slightly cloying aftertaste. It's very light bodied and relatively low carbonation. Boring but not terrible."
"Newcastle Brown ale pours to a light brown, almost cola-like color with a pock-marked foamy head and a soft malty nose. The palate is smooth and nutty, slightly sweet, with a light cracker-like malt character and a hint of chocolate. The hops are just barely perceptible in the finish. This is a wonderfully delicate beer, and a classic English brown ale. Though not as assertive as American brown ale, which is a maltier, hoppier brew, Newcastle should be appreciated for its subtle delicacy. Its easy to throw loads of hops and malt at a beer and make it a big one. A far truer test of the brewers art is to produce a drinkable, subtly flavored delight the likes of this one."
"D-This beer is nicely balanced and easy to drink. Goes down smoother the more it warms."
"M&D - smooth and quenching, nearly as good as the bottle, a great beer out of a can"
"D: This beer goes down very easily, because it’s not too heavy and has a low ABV%, which allows you to drink a lot of volume. However, it’s that same quality that could cause you to look for something with more flavor and more kick."
"Drinkability - Very good example of the style and could drink this as a session beer. While not a stable beer it is nice when I am in the mood for a brown ale."
"D: If its on tap I can have this (and have had it) all night. First tried on tap at the Scholar's Lounge in Rome and at the British Beer Company in Pembroke. I would never buy this bottled."
"If you ever have the chace to try this beer on draught, jump at the chance. Bottled, it's okay, but on draught, it is simply amazing!"
"Overall a very nice beer. This one I will definitely pick up again."
"Poured a reddish brown color with a very small head that went away quickly. Aroma was malty and caramelly with a faint hop smell in the backround. Taste was fruity with notes of cherry, brown sugar and some winey flavors mixed in. Mouthfeel was smooth but kind of thin in the body. Drinkability was pretty good. Nothing too inoffensive or too aggressive either. I remember this beer being thicker and heavier during my early explorations into craft beer. Maybe my palate has changed or maybe the beer has been toned down over the years for the mass market. Regardless, there are better examples of the style."
"The beer pours a brown auburn color with a bright with head. The head settles into a medium lacing on the glass edges. It has a malty aroma with a little bit of a sugary quality. The taste is malty with a little bit of a hops bite across the tongue. The flavors are blended well. It has a smooth feel with a little bit of heaviness. The bit of it doesnt last long and it settles into a clean finish. In all the beer is easy to drink and tastes good. Its not too exciting but it has all the qualities of a fine brown ale."
"This beer is an easy drinking, great starter beer. It's the kind of beer that you order first in the night and every subsequent after. Don't drink other beers before this one, or the taste will be ruined. The flavor leaves dryness in your mouth that makes you want another. All in all a good beer."
"Everyone I know loves this stuff, but for some reason...never have had one! Poured it chilled, not lager cold. The appearance is some kind of pretty. Brown, with a ruby red tint; arrogant bastard-esque. Rich head that sticks around for quite awhile. The smell is sweet, leading to believe it will be a good time. Taste also goes the same way. Sweet, chocolate and caramel like in flavors. Very interesting, almost leads you to think this isn't beer?...alcohol is hidden like a champ! The mouthfeel is decent, a little bit watery. The drinkability is probably the best part of this beer. Not offensive in any way. You can probably suck down a whole six pack before you feel like youre at the yacking stage. The smoothness is definitely what sets this beer apart from other mass produced ales. Very Bass Ale like in character."
"poured into pint glass at cellar temperature. Color is a clear brown which forms a short lived spritzy head a light lacing. Subdued malt smell that features a diacetyl aroma. The front end is watery, slippery and buttery. Diacetyl and a mild sweetness dominate the entire ale. While this ale isn't totally bland, the lack of any hop quality kicks this ale out of balance. I drank three of these over the course of an evening."
"The pour is reddish-brown with a cream colored head. The nose is a little artificial. The main aroma is toasted malt and it's rather mild. The taste still has some of that artificial character, but it has more going on. Toasted malts, caramel malts, nuts, toffee, and chocolate are all present. There are roasty flavors, but this is mostly sweet with a dryer finish. It's not all that some people make it out to be, but it's a lot better than the backlash led me to expect (I've had it once or twice before, but I didn't remember it clearly)."
"This is a beer that I will always enjoy. Malty, slightly sweet, strong enough to not have to carry a carrier bag full bursting at the seams, quaffable enough to remember tomorrow. The years spent developing this classic were well spent. Not a live ale but certainly a lively one."
"D - Easy to like, easy to drink. I think I'll have another..."
"Solid brown ale, and a readily available one. What more could you ask for?"
""
"mouthfeel is heavily carbonated and relatively thin. taste of sweet malts and an earthy, cleansing hop finish. balanced if overly clean and straightforward. drinkable once the skunking fades."
"This is a good brown ale, reminiscent of the Grolsch amber ale. Good amber color. Pleasant smell. Nice caramel, toffee taste. Great aftertaste. A very pleasant drink. A bit expensive for the taste. I wish this beer was less expensive then it would be worth its price."
"Eric"
"I'm a bottom fermenter and when I seek bottom I climb underground. The dirt and clay taste better than the wispy little cloud poofs and you feel a little closer to the brown people who started this ignorant race of humansauruses. Drinking is afterall a method to kill or cleanse a bad day or a bum occurence. Hell it's even happy time for some elves. But I'm a particularly strange dwarf with my tufted ears and need for gravy and sirloins and sausage. This is what Guinness would taste like if you didn't have to drink it with a fork. Brown gravy soda with chunks of squirrel mixed in. The nutmeggy little squirrel you see hanging from a tree limb and eating all of your songbird's suet energy cakes and laughing as you steam from the inside of the window. Once you knock he'll look and then be gone and you're back to bird watching. Except that the little birds are twittering above your head and building a little shrine to tasty spirits."
"Drinkability: This beer is fine to drink, not especially impressive for a brown ale. Has an unexpected tartness and not much roasty toasty. But I'm going to consume it anyway with some colby and enjoy it."
"Had this on-tap at Miller's Ale House in Orlando. Pours a dark brown color with a small fizzy head. Taste and smell consist of sweet malt and a touch of brown sugar. This is definately not a bad brew on tap. Not the most interesting beer but it is enough to make a decent session beer on occasion."
"There was a time when I rather enjoyed Newcastle. For that reason, I'd say it's a decent transitional beer for those who might one day make the switch from macro-swill to beers with real flavor. But unfortunately by the time that switch is made, I think Newcastle's appeal has waned."
"this is a good beer to a certain point, but it gets old fast IMO. this is a 2 beer max for me."
"Not my favorite choice in this style, but I would gladly drink it when it's available."
"definetly, worth a try"
"Aroma is not too strong but enough to satisfy"
"12 oz bottle pours out a solid amber/brown hue. A decent size head. It smelled very malty. The malt flavor was accompanied by a hop bitterness, nutty flavors and a hint of caramel. The mouthfeel was fairly crisp and dry. Like most darker beers it is a little heavier than other but overall, I really enjoy Newcastle Brown."
"Not my favorite beer, but it's not bad and can be pretty enjoyable in a pinch."
"Bottom line: Excellent session beer."
"Even though this doesn't stack up as a great brown ale, it is one of my favorites. Even to drink and tasty enough. A good change of pace and widely available."
"My review: Yep, it's brown. Little off white head. Smell brings up a little hop/malt mix neither very strong and same with the taste. It's a middle of the road blend, on my tongue anyway. Not huge on taste. The carbonation and long lasting unpleasant aftertaste has been what's bothered me about Newcastle as of late. But having said that, I could pound one after another after another of these in a sitting."
"Newcastle Brown Ale pours a deep brown, with ruby highlights and a tan head from a clear twelve ounce bottle. Aroma is mild, but not unpleasant. Taste is pretty good, caramel is present and it has a nutty aftertaste. Hops are pretty much unnoticeable. A quintessential brown ale. If you've never tried this you should, if only to know what this style is supposed to be."
"Brown/ Amber in color with a slight beige head. A nutty, malty smell, with a slight tart smell. A very familiar taste. This was my first beer and I was lucky. I was 19 and in the Red Lion Pub in Chicago. It took me a good five years to find it again (Lived in Iowa, this was in 1989). Very smooth in taste with a sweet maly taste. A very drinkable beer."
"D: Can only handle so much of this, after a while it's just gets old, and I want something that screams BEER a bit more."
"This a dark tea colored beer with a quickly disappearing head. The nose is very faint floral hop and light brown sugar. Taste is very simple light caramel malt, nut, and herbal hop taste that is barely there. Finish is a little bready. Mouthfeel is watery, slick and has stingy carbonation. This is a very smooth, subtle beer, that is worth picking up if you come upon a deal, otherwise, we can do much better."
"Newcastle pours a very rich amber color, almost red. The head is nice, although slightly short lived. The smell is very sweet, but still maintains a welcoming aroma of beer. After smelling the beer, you should have a good idea of what it will taste like. It manages to have a very sweet taste without losing its edge. It has a very nice amount of carbonation, managing to give it a nice kick, without tasting like a soda. This beer is very easy to drink as it leaves a very nice after taste, however as you get towards the end it tends to taste watered down. Over all I think this is one of my favourite beers. I'll admit it is nowhere near as tasty or original as so many micro brews, but its reasonably priced, and readily available. This beer is rarely NOT in my fridge as it is my everyday drinking beer. If you haven't tried it, I highly recommend it."
"I had this beer on tap last night. I think is a great, tasty beer. I'm not huge on carbonation, and this fits well with me. It's not necessarily the best brown ale I've ever had, but I would get this again (especially on tap). A very satisfying beer."
"New Castle was once a beer I admired before I devoloped a palate. Now I'd say it's just average at best. It is very smooth helping it's drinkability score But otherwise low on my list of beer to buy or drink."
"D - Not bad. This is an OK beer, but nothing spectacular."
"One of my favorite common beers, Newcastle is always a good choice compared to what you typically find on tap. An almost carmel-like flavor, but not too sweet. Very smooth, and finishes nicely. Dark brown apperance, and an appropriate amount of head. Overall good, but not great."
"D: It's a very drinkable beer it's not offensive by any means so it's a good beer for people who are just starting trying brown ales to have to get introduced to the style."
"Cheers."
"This is a drinkable beer, but a bit filling. I would have it again, but in this instance I think it was over priced at $4.00 a bottle."
"Sweet malty taste, a little buttery, finishes with a bit of a hop flavor. Mouthfeel is OK, some fullness, crisp finish, touch of residual sticky sweetness. A little skunkiness gave it a slight taste of lime juice. A good sessional is this is one of the only options, just make sure it's fresh."
"This beer had a dark amber appearance with a medium head that dissipated after a bit. The smell was full of body and had a medium hop aroma to it. The taste likewise had plenty of malt flavor with a medium amount of bitterness. The mouthfeel was about average with an average amount of carbonation. I felt that this ale was fairly drinkable as I enjoyed it and would probably have another."
"Someone left this in my fridge downstairs, so I saved it to sample later. Seems more like a pilsner with some color added, to me...pretty boring."
", good clarity with a small light head. Malty aroma smells sweet with little to no hop nose. Malty flavor matches the aroma and leaves little aftertaste. A good Northern English brown ale, very drinkable."
"This beer is a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting much more. Pours a light caramel color with a thin off white head. Not much in the aroma department, just a little biscuity malts. Taste is thin and watery and too sweet for my tastes. This would probably make a good session beer for somebody, just not me."
"Very good beer. Enjoyed it the first time I had it a year or so ago, but became reaquainted with it recently for the Superbowl. The apperance & smell are its best attributes. Color is a medium dark, rich brown, with a small head. Not much lacing on the glass. Smell is of sweet malt -- very inviting. The taste is good--just a tad sweet. I could see the negative of this beer being that it is a little watery, but it goes down smooth, is tasty, and makes for an excellent session beer. I still prefer Brooklyn Brown Ale to this, but definitely worth a try."
"A very watery beer. One of my favorites. Flavor is slightly strong and noticeable, but very easy to drink. These qualities is what all of us look for in a beer. The carbonation is nonexistent. A beautiful brown color with an off white head. Please please try this beer..."
"Overall: Has some nice characteristics, but I wish it would simply step up to the plate a little. Everything seems to try to hide behind something else and while that makes it easy to drink, the flavor and taste never stays with me from one purchase to the next. Great session beer and probably a good threshold beer for those moving from macro lagers to craft brews."
"I tried this beer last night at my favorite watering hole (Summits in Sandy Springs). It pours into a barrel mug a slightly opaque deep cola brown with very little head that quickly fades into a ring. This beers carbonation is moderate to high. The smell is a very spritzy but musty maple scent. The flavor is of malt, maple syrup, and a bit of a citrus/floral note near the end of the flavor. This may be one of the few beers that I enjoy more from a bottle instead of on draught. The mouthfeel is medium but somehow flat and biting all at once? That's different. This is a good drinking beer. It comes out as average but not lackluster in any way."
"cheers..."
"Wonderful beer. Tastey."
"I will be on the lookout for this ale on draft."
"The ""rocket fuel"" of my youth comes in a clear half litre bottle with a freshness date. The colour is somewhere between tan and mahogany but a little redder. It smells of brewery emissions but more metallic and creamier. I really like the feel. It starts off with plenty of carbonation in the mouth before a warmer somewhat sweet maltiness takes over. This never becomes dry though because there is a pleasant metallic edge. This is disturbingly drinkable for such a seemingly simple beer and much better than most of the ubiquitous British beers."
"this is a brew which blindfolded I would hardly recognise as an ale ... the taste and mouthfeel are rather lager (or to be more precise 'export') like ... as the vision says something different, I do spot some nutty taste and a fine bitterness .... although the taste is not spectacular, I am most impressed with the smoothness of this brew ..."
"Mouthfeel is fairly light and wet, goes down smooth. Refreshing and easy to drink with a neutral finish. Flavor is malt and caramel with some noticable hops and a hint of a nut somewhere. Overall very easy to drink and refreshing. Always a good go to beer when not much else is available. Not as sweet or nutty as some other browns but more of a neutral flavor that doesn't really get your attention but is very easy to drink. A nice session brew if you will. . ."
"I tend to pick this beer quite often when I'm at the pub. The bright brown-reddish color is maybe the most appealing aspect of this beer. It doesn't smell very much for an ale. The taste is sweet and malty with lots of caramel and some semi-bitter hops. Very drinkable, you can easily have a couple of these over a few hours."
"Over the past couple years I have drank alot of Newcastle both on-tap and out of bottles. To me it is not all that consistent. Sometimes it will be slightly bitter(like the last 12pack I bought), or really sweet. Carbonation varies a little from moderate to high(the one I am drinking now is feels more bubbly than it normally does). No matter how the batch is, it always tastes good. This is a beer that is moderately priced that I like to have around to offer guests...much better than the macro lagers most people give me when I go their house."
"A decent all-around beer. It has a good flavor and is easy on the palate. The scent is not strong, but is enough to compliment the taste while drinking. Color was brown and consistent, head was a light tan. Newcastle is drinkable but would have to be in the right frame of mind."
"The mouth feel is very light and actively carbonated."
"Pours a perfectly clear and clean darkened amber to reddish hue, makes a thin offwhite head that fades quickly. Aroma is buttery caramel and nut. Flavor is very one sided, nothing but caramel malt, very little bitterness, no hop flavor detected here, rather boring. Moderate carbonation, light body and a clean crisp dry finish. Meh, there's so many better brown ales out there... I can drink it, but I'd rather have something else."
"This is the beer that got me into to beer. It'll always have a special place for me. Now, no doubt there are many better beers out there, in this style and others. But I always make sure that i have newcastle in my fridge."
"I really can't figure this out. How can anyone pay $15 a twelve pack for this? No taste, all water, nothing good to say. Very thin mouthfeel, very little flavors. A little brown sugar....maybe?? And all water. Bottle is cool, but that is about it. Avoid and buy a good microbrew."
"Beautiful appearance. Great color. Nice light maltiness. A pleasant, easily quaffable beer that appeals to many macro drinkers. Worth drinking, but not worth $4 a pint, IMO."
"Drinkable, but only when there's nothing else available at the local smalltown grocery or dive bar."
"I had this on tap locally at Mother Bear's with some pizza and chicken wings... It was delicious. On-tap it was a little less carbonated than what I am used to and what I like, but still had everything else going for it. This beer proves to be very versatile with going great with foods or just drinking it at home while watching tv. And it's not really expensive for how great the taste is. One of the best all around beers I know of."
"Da good beer IMHO, especially when there are no craft taps available at a bar or restaurant. This is the beer that helped my wife learn that there is more out there than Miller Lite. A good transition beer for those who are looking for a little more flavor as they journey towards the dark side."
"It is particularly smooth and would be most welcome on a wintery night rather than a mild mid summer night"
"If the carbonation were better this could be drinkable. It's not really offensive in any way, and it's a good introduction to the English Brown genre for non-BA types."
"D - I used to like this beer but my tastes must have changed. I dont think Ill being picking up another Newcastle Brown for quite a while"
"overall- pretty much what i expected with this, a watered down and almost flavorless beer that will appeal to the masses. only thing going for this is its refreshing and i would rather drink this then a macro though if it came down to it."
"Drinkability is where this brew shines. Newcastle Brown Ale is so smooth and so tasty that you can't help but have a second or a third. It's not, like others have said, a particularly distinguished or complex beer, but it gets the job done - good taste, good mouthfeel and a generally good beer."
"Very drinkable as a session beer. I've always enjoyed this beer on tap and will continue to order it when there aren't a lot of other choices. Not nearly as flavorful as other beers, however I don't think there were many negatives about it, either."
"This is a pretty drinkable beer. The taste is decent, but not overwhelming and it's easy to put down. Would make a decent cross-over beer or even a decent session beer if there were no better options. The flavor seems to stand out a little more when the beer comes from a tap."
"Excellent. Great with spicy food."
"The beer is a dark brown color with a frothy off white head that holds and laces nicely. The smell is of faint malts. It tastes of some sweet malts, no hops, and something that I cannot put my finger on but I do not prefer this taste. There is good thickness and carbonation. This beer does not hold a candle to another brown ale like Rogue's Hazlenut nectar."
"Mild, sweet maltly aroma that was not very strong or impressive, but pleasant nonetheless. Tasted mostly malty and finished with little bitterness. Flavor is not very strong, just like the aroma. The mouthfeel is light with medium carbonation, tastes slightly watered down. Overall, a very drinkable brew."
"Still a good beer that introduced me into broadening my beer horizons."
"This was a decent but undistinguished beer. It looked pretty appealing in that nice clear bottle, and smelled like a beer ought to- some roasted malts and some balancing hops, (not a lot of yeast that I could detect). Taste was ok, with some sweet and rich malts up front and some hops that were nicely balanced (if not really interesting) in the back. But there was a bitter aftertaste as well that negatively effected what would otherwise have been good drinkability. Mouthfeel was fine I guess. I have no complaints about Newcastle being too watery or too carbonated or too flat or too thick. All in all this would probably make a good session beer, though its not really a taste explosion (which is the point of a Brown Ale I'm given to understand). For that reason it is the best selling Ale in England. Bass, its nearest competitor is better though. It's got more depth and its more interesting. I don't hold the bitterness against Newcastle because my samples turned out to have been sitting in my host's fridge for quite a while, but until I try it again, I can't give it a great drinkability rating. Anway, this is certainly worth a try, but even I know there's a lot more to Ale than this stuff."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a nice dark reddish-brown, and builds a small off-white head that dissipates quickly, but leaves decent lacing most of the way down. Smells vaguely hoppy and has fruity hints, but there is a metallic note to it as well. Tasting one can see where the smell comes from. It is dominated by an unpleasant metallic taste, although hints of malty sweetness are present as well. Mouthfeel is thin and unsatisfying, and I certainly wouldn't go back for another, even if it's not terribly difficult to get through."
"12 oz. clear bottle with some code on the back. It pours a reddish/brown/copper with a 1 finger fizzy head that recedes then comes back as a thin layer of fine bubbles and leaves moderate lacing. It smells sweet and skunky/grassy - just as I feared - skunked from light-struck clear bottles. It has a medium to light body and tastes of caramel, skunk, green hops, bubblegum?, diacetyl?, malt sweetness, fruits, and a mild hop bitterness. Why, why do they use clear bottles?!? It's much better on tap or from the enclosed 12-packs."
"Had a 20 ounce Newcastle at the Red Star in VIrginia Beach. I am not familiar with the style and this is the first Brown Ale I have tried. Pours a nice reddish brown clear color with minimal head or lacing. Looks kind of like flat coke when held up to the light. Has a pleasant, less than overpowering smell. Taste is good....fairly mild, sweet with some malt flavor. This is not a heavy beer...not watery but less substantial than I was expecting. Drinkability is very good. The taste is not overpowering, ABV light and the beer itself is not too heavy. Even though I am primarily a hop head, I would have no problem with this as a session beer."
"Interestingly, Newcastle Brown is widely available on tap in the US, but in Britain (where it is brewed and where most beers come from the tap or cask) it is almost always found in bomber bottles."
"Pours a modest dark brown with a quickly disappearing head, and although no outstanding traits that make this ale a standout, still admirable in the areas of a fantastic session beer. Taste is sweet and toasted, nice malt present, finished aftertaste free. Carbonation level complements simplicity of beer nicely, not too much not too little, average on the nose. Would purchase this ale over any mainstream domestic as far as a good drinking night goes."
"Pours a mahogany color and forms a bubbly head that dissapears quickly. Smells like sweet malts, sugarcane-like, with some nuttiness as well. The taste is not impressive at all. Basically a sweeter, maltier version of an American macro. Has a faint hop flavor right when you swallow. I rate this a 3.5 in drinkabilitly only because it would be so easy to finish of a 12-pack of this. It tastes better than the average macro, but not good enough to sip and savor."
"The beer was brown and thining to an amber on the bottom half and edges of the glass. The beer poured with a finger of highly fizzing head that dissipated quickly and left no real lacing. The aroma has some caramel and nut hints as well as some toffee as well. The flavor is not that bad: plenty of malt and little to no hop character with a caramel finish. Very little carbonation to this, giving it a syrupy tecture, yet light mouthfeel. Newcastle's brown ale is 4.9 ABV, and I've found it to be quite different on tap than in the clear glass, easily light struck bottles. This is a drinkable, imported brown ale though."
"This beer came a glowing amber with a thin head. Nice color, but that was about it. Smelled of fruity plumbs, green grapes and a crisp brown ale-malt. Tasted of prunes, noodles, smooth molasses, green grapes and honey. The mouth feel with thin with a medium carbonation. Not too bad of a beer. Its definitely good, but its nothing to write home about. However, I can see myself drinking quite a few of these in a night."
"Poured this into a pilsner glass. small head with bubbles. This dissapates fairly quickly. No true lacing. smells of caramel and hazelnut. the flavor also has a malty taste with brown sugar or caramel. The mouthfeel is fairly thin so you can drink them quickly. I like this beer, its not that expensive and taste pretty good... thumbs up"
"very dar reddish brown brew with a quickly dissipating head. Newcast Brown Ale has kind of a simple taste that has both mellow hops and sweet undersated malt. The most prominent flavor is the nut flavor that blends well and complements the malt. Very smooth and drinkable and has a relatively low carbonation. Not bad."
"I must have had this beer countless times. Only now Ive taken the time to do a proper review. All things told, Im not sure Ive ever understood the hype over this brew. Thats certainly true today. Its a brown, wooden-colored, clear liquid, with a respectable, but unremarkable head. The aroma is just slightly malty, without much to add. Taste: roast malt, caramel, chocolate, and thats about it. Its sort of quiet and unobtrusive. The finish is silent. Moderate mouthfeel, with a little carbonation. All in all, Im still underwhelmed by this beer."
"Overall a solid brew and a step ahead of the regular macro. The only bad thing I can say about this is it was a bit watery but still solid."
"The taste is likewise low key but does have a pleasant sweet malt flavor that follows a brief hop assault. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I like in a brown ale but not damagingly so. Generally it has more life on tap and it has more bite on its home soil as well. Solid but not a superstar."
"Bottom line: If you like brown ales, try this, it's cheap."
"Drinkability: I really enjoy this beer. Doesn't get old too quickly and has a refreshingly candid flavor. Certainly recommended, and I think it would be a good crossover beer."
"Mouthfeel is watery, boring, and blahhh. Drinkable? Not so much. I didn't really want another. Yes, better than Bud, but... I didn't really dig it. Better than some, not nearly as good as most."
"-Cheers2Beers"
"Overall this is a good beer to sit down with a friend and have 2 or 3 of, definitely better than mass-produced american beers."
"The mouth is just short of medium, quaffable and I prefer the bottle to the draft version."
"This beer poured with a decent head. It is brown in color with a hint of red when held to the light. The smell is similar to pecans. The taste is fairly bitter with a aftertaste of smoke. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth. I could drink this beer again but I don't think I would have many at one time."
"I would recommend this to most anyone wanting to try a brown ale. For the price it ain't bad."
"Update: My opinion has not changed even after trying some other Brown Ales. This beer is unique."
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery, with little-to-no carbonation. Not impressed."
"This pours a dark reddish brown with a one and a half finger head that leaves nice lacing,but disappears quickly.The smell is very slight,but you can make out small amounts of nuttiness and spices.This has a nutty flavor with some spices,nutmeg,cinnamon?,but it is a little watery.The m/f is medium,a little watery,but not terrible.This is an OK brown ale,not great,but I would try it again because it was one of my gateway beers away from the big lousy macros,and it still is available in alot of resturants."
"Drinkability  Not a session beer but I do enjoy this. A nice change of pace from the standard beer."
"Drinkability: I say this is a better than average beer for the price, if you like brown beers, it should do you well, but a little shorter on taste for way cheaper, I'll take an american like JJ Wainwrights EE HB."
"What makes me come back to this beer time and time again is its light tastes and even balance. Hardly an aftertaste though. I would like more of that, but you cant have everything in life now can you? It, at times seems a bit watery. Which is why I gave it a 3.5 on mouthfeel, but the 4.5 on drinkability is due to the wide range of availability and its smoothness when drinking. Great session beer."
"Sampled at a beer tasting 9/7/05, tasted many times previously and since. The pour is of a deep ruby color with a whisp of an off white head. The nose has carmelly sweet tones and is nice. The sweetness carries on to the flavor, sweet malty, almost toffee-like. It is drying in the mouth and carries some chalkiness to the finish. Nice beer."
"Pours a transluscent brown with some ruby around the edges and a nice beige head that retains well. The aroma has notes of fruity esters, caramel, toasted bread and some hazelnut. Flavor has some toasted bread and a light caramel sweetness, as well as some mineral flavors and a slight nuttiness...sacrifices flavor for drinkability imho. Mouthfeel is light a bit watery with even carbonation. Drinkability is good, but only because it feels like they took a real english brown and added 25% more water. Descent but i wish i had gone with the brooklyn brown instead."
"The mouthfeel of this beer is fairly light. It almost feels like water in the mouth. There is very little carbonation in this beer, as a matter of fact it almost looks flat. It goes down fairy smooth and is easy to drink. I really don't think that I'll be buying this beer again. The reason being is because it is in a clear bottle, as a matter of fact when I opened this bottle I did smell an aroma that smelled very much like a skunk. I am convinced that it would taste 100% better from the tap. But as far as the bottles I don't think I'll buy them again. I really don't understand why anyone would bottle beer in clear bottles, sure its cheaper but the beer can become skunked mighty easily."
"Overall: A bit too mild and with too little bite for a true dark ale"
"Drinkability  The taste of this beer is not enough to carry it through to a good drinkability rating for me. Ill have to try it again, as I know a lot of people are very fond of it in the US. Im not experiencing it positively today."
"drinkability - very drinkable and I could have drank many more pints of this."
"Not great."
"The bottle version is still ok in my opinion. Very chewy and bready."
"A watery, though readily available brown ale. Perhaps brown bottles would help the condition of the beer?"
"Poured a golden brown, not much carbonation, small head. Nice lacing though. Scents of caramel malt. The taste is pretty flat, this might be skunked, not impressed at all. Medium body. I guess some could drink this stuff, but not me. Will not buy again."
"As I said before... nothing special, but entirely inoffensive."
"I've had Newcastle enough to know this one wouldn't be anything special, but it was on tap for $2 a pint today. Okay in every characteristic. None of my favorite qualities of brown ales were apparent here, especially regarding smell and taste. Nice creamy mouthfeel though. Better on draft than in a bottle in my opinion."
"When I was a young, innocent and inexperienced beer drinker, I drank a lot of this beer. Now, I find it very uninteresting and artificial. Way to go"
"Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of English ales....although I really like Bass, but this one feels weak all-around. Slight hop sweetness, I expected more bitter, but not really at all. Not even much of a roasted taste. Thin in the mouth, soft on the palate. That's a bit of a bad combination for me. Filling though. All these things make me think that I'd be hard pressed to make this a session ale, especially with all the great ales available out there. Not a big fan."
"Pours out fairly dark in color, but you can tell it's amber when you put it into the light. The head fizzles away quite fast, and does not really stay with the beer. The smell is quite nice, with very familiar hop smells. Not overpowering which is quite nice. The taste is quite good. Although it's a bit acidic when it first reaches the toungue, it mellows out nicely, with a blunt taste of hops. I find the carbonation in this beer a bit heavy, especially for an ale such as this one. The liquid is also fairly runny, not interesting to the mouth. This is very drinkable, and I think it is good for a full night's worth of drinking. Not especially filling."
"Pours a clear dark reddish copper. Creamy two finger head with outstanding retention and fair spotty lacing. Faint floral hops and crystal aroma. Timid malty flavor, sweet esters and just traces of herbal hops that produce a drying, clean finish. Light bodied and adequatley carbonated to fight off diacetyl. This is a very drinkable beer, but it seems a little bland even by english brown ale standards."
"Pours a murky milk chocolate brown with a small off-white head. Smell is sweet grainy, fruity malts and iced tea. Taste follows suit, leans heavily toward malts, very little hop presence, but I really don't miss it. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, though rather thin. I could still drink this stuff all day and still haven't found a beer that I could drink to my own oblivion that is so refreshing and tasty. There's nothing too complex about it, and it's a little unbalanced, but I still enjoy this brown ale, and I still compare all browns I try to this old standard."
"It was a dull brown with a lackluster head; didn't help that it was in a plastic cup. Smelled fruity and of esters/banana. Taste was also disturbingly banana-ish. It was a little malty, but there were no dark malt flavors like chocolate or coffee. Really dull beer for a really dull baseball game."
"Drinkability: I found it to be a very modest medocere brown ale but enjoyable. I enjoy this beer on tap more than out of the bottle."
"In reality, today's Newcastle has been relegated to a beer that can carry your swill guzzling buddies from Anheuser-Buschs' Amber Bock towards better Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale or Wychwood Hobgoblin."
"Appearance is  well,  brown! Not much foam to boast about, and it dissipates quickly. Aroma is roasted barley, malt, diacetyl (buttery) and is followed by a taste comprised of the same. Hops assert themselves bringing some bitterness to match the malt sweetness, fruit (plums) and grains are present. Body is about medium. Finish is dry and leaves a clean palate. Available on tap everywhere. An okay beer with food."
"The beer is drinkable but not one of my first picks. Slightly better on draft IMO, the beer from the bottle is a little light on the flavour potential it could have. An okay beer, but nothing too special. There are certainly much better and just as available samples of the style that I'd rather opt for."
"This is an easy beer to drink, and it does have some sweetness and bitterness to keep the taste buds involved. Unfortunately the flavor and mouthfeel are a little weak. The head at the beginning warns you that this beer is a little on the soda-pop side."
"I just came back from a cruise and this was the only beer they had that was drinkable. Needless to say, I consumed a hell of a lot of it. It looks and smells fine, but the taste gets horridly old after about 2 or 3 of these. The mouthfeel is slick, but honstly adds nothing to the beer. After 4 days of drinking nothing but these, I was about ready to quit drinking all together. Enough said."
"Had one at The Outback a few nights ago. Poured a clear reddish brown with a coarse white head. Left some lacing after the head diminished. I'll agree with others saying they found this to be a ""nutty"" beer, slightly malty with a light mouthfeel. Mild finish. This is on par with Killians IMO but with a little less personality."
"Drinkability is good light beer goes down quick and smooth would be a good intro to browns for someone who enjoys light macro crap. Not altogether bad but wouldn't recommend to fellow BA's."
"Note: Personally I prefer this on-tap. Also, sometimes these can be skunky as the bottle is clear. Try to do your best to get bottles that haven't been exposed to sunlight, and keep them in the dark until you drink them."
"Overall, not bad. Feels a bit harsh on the tongue, but otherwise is generally easy to drink and does not have a terrible flavour."
"Very nice beer."
"Ruby-brown color and a somewhat fizzy head. Head rentention is a thin lace. Roasted grains, a little bit of buttery diacetyl come out in the aroma. The taste is semi sweet and has a touch of roasted grains. Some buttery diacetyl and hints of fruit can be found. The mouthfeel is a little thin for the style. Finishes off dry and malty. An average brown ale."
"Pours a dark chocolate brown with an off-white creamy thin head that laces all the way down. I actually thought this was in a brown bottle til I poured it into the glass, hehe. Has a pleasant malty chocolate aroma. This beer has a great malty chocolatey roasty flavor. Not too sweet, and just enough bitterness to balance it out and have a clean finish. It's very creamy and not too carbonated. I really like this beer, I could drink it all day. My only regret is that I only bought one bottle."
"Drinkability - This went down really easily for me. Perhaps not as easy as most light beers, but compared to a good stout, this was a breeze. I could see myself pouding a 6 pack of these without any effort at all."
"Drinkability: Overall, this was an unimpressive, adjunct-heavy euro-macro, but theres something about it thats so good, and hopefully its not just the nostalgia associated with this brew for me. But I do prefer a meatier brown ale, but this thinner, crisper brown ale is still rather refreshing."
"Light to medium in body with a smooth and creamy texture highlighted by tight and easy carbonation."
"Great overall beer. Has a nutty smell and pours with a moderate white head. The color is a translucent brown-red color, but becomes much more red when held up to the light. Taste is pretty solid and there is not much variation, but still the taste of nut is what takes precedence. Great taste for anyone who is perhaps shy to brown ales and is looking for a good introduction."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown color with almost no head. Smells fruity and mildly sour, but not sour in a bad way...more of a pleasing sour. It tastes like it smells. Nothing overpowering, but enough flavor. This was one of my four staple beers before I became a BA, along with Guinnes and Fransikaner Hefe and Dunkel. It is not a bad beer, and it can be a lifesaver as it is often the only decent beer most establishments carry. Still, I think I will only drink it on those occasions. There is just too much good beer out there to be drinking mediocre stuff."
"Still in a class above the likes of Miller and Bud, but if you're going to pay $7.99 for a six pack I don't see why one would pick this over other beers."
"Newcastle is a nice dependable beer that's great with a meal. Pours a deep dark red with a finger of off-white head and a decent amount of lacing. The nose is very malty with just a bit of nuttiness. Taste is more of the same, a simple malt/nut taste with a little bit of butterscotch and tinniness as well. A little thin bodied with low carbonation for a creamy feel. This is a solid if unexeptional beer."
"One of the most unique things about the brew is that I've always felt that it had a bit of a wine taste. A lot of people that normally don't drink beer have found this to be one of the exceptions."
"This pours a nice dark red brown. The head is decent. A classic but whats up with the euro skunk smell. Somebody give me a lesson this. Europeans like nasty sewer smells in their beer? It is fairly malty and does taste pretty good. Nutty also.The body is limp, very light mouthfeel. Decent. But there are better ones out there."
"Pours a clear brownish red color with a light colored head that quickly dissipates then disappears. Slighty nutty aroma with a heavy dose of English malts. Taste is full of malt, with a hint of nuttiness, as well as some subdued English hops. I also detect a little butter mixed with the malts. Slight metallic taste melds with sweet malts in the finish. Overall, though uninspiring, it is a fairly smooth drinking English ale."
"Poured dark amber into a pint glass, very little head, very little carbonation.. Smelled a bit nutty. Taste was good, almost an unsweetened tea aftertaste. Mouthfeel was a bit runny. Definitely an everyday beer, though."
"poured a light brown color from clear glass bottle with only slight head and minimal carbonation.smell is of mild nuttiness. taste is enjoyable of malt with little hoppiness. Enjoyable in the mouth leaving nice aftertastes. A good drinkable beer but nothing that excels"
"This used to be one of my favorites. Pours a ruby red color, with a quickly diminishing head. Aroma is nutty and sweet, and faint. The taste follows the aroma, this is what I'd call a nut brown. Chocolate malt is present, but not in a starring role. This would be a good, if not great session beer. Mouthfeel is a little thin for me, and undercarbonated, if you ask me."
"This could be the freshest Newcastle I have ever sampled. I'm glad I have this one for my review. There have been many times when I have had this beer and the taste is off. Whether that can be attributed to freshness or the clear bottle, I don't know, but its too risky for me at $8.99 a six pack."
"Thin mouthfeel, clean aftertaste. Solid marks for this one all around, but it remains outside the upper echelon."
"This beer pours a beautiful dark brown and transparent amber color with a decent off-tan shaded head that dissipates quickly. The nose is very faint, its hard to sense any kind of unique aroma. The taste, however, is very unique. When it first hit my tongue I almost thought it tasted like tonic water. I then noticed some carmel notes followed by a nice bite and a nutty taste. It also has an almost woody, smoke-like aftertaste, not strong but something a little different. This beer has a very changing flavor from start to finish. The mouthfeel is a bit watery and flat, but not bad. Very drinkable beer here, I dont think I'd have much trouble putting away quite a few of these."
"On tap at the Grotto in Rolla just prior to 97th Annual St. Pats. Full pint drawn into a frozen glass dark brown color and an off-white head leaving lace. Good chocolate, roasted malt, and caramel aroma. It tastes about the same. The mouthfeel is good as was the drinkability. Wanted a Harp but not avaible this year. Interesting beer I would have had a second but I didn't care for the arctic temperature since I was about to head out on the street for a 1 1/2 hour parade."
"Drinkability- THis one is about 10 times better from the tap than from a bottle. No wonder you always see it on sale for $8.99 a 12pk. Pass on the bottle, give it a try on tap."
"A clean brown beer with deep amber highlights. Has a small beige head. The aroma starts out sweet and malty with a strong carmel backbone. A prickely carbonation opens the door for a nice roasted malt bitterness in the flavor with a hint of coffee in the background. There is a sweet malty after taste in the finish that makes this a pleasant session beer."
"Tastes like a much stronger version of the nose. Brown ale fruitiness against a stark malt finish. Nice, but nothing to write home about. Nice, full body and low carbonation make this a good session ale, but little else."
"Ahhh, I said to myself, what shall I drink today? I nice brown ale sounded tempting to my palate, so a Newcastle I had. It poured out a dark brownish amber with a slight layer of head. I took a smell and was reminded of, well...brown ale. The tastes cames at you immediatley, sharp and crisp, with light maltiness. It does down smooth, though mine seemed more carbonated than usual. The taste finished with what seemed to be almost a kiss of honey. Overall quite tasty and very drinkable, I felt satisfied with my British brown brew."
"Drinkable, but not excessively drinkable by any means."
"Drinkability: It was a good bottle who remembers me ales on tap. One of my best reviews. This ale is dark, but its taste is a lot more complex than just bitterness. Its sweetness makes a big difference."
"The biggest drawback? Too thin when compared to better bodied versions of the style."
"Sampled at about 50 degrees. Pours a cola brown color with not much of a light beige head. No lacing. Some chocolate malt aromas mixed with some generic ale-like fruity qualities. Weakly malted (mainly some mild biscuity, nutty flavor); the main character of the flavor is the water content, which comes across as being minerally. Some weak aley fruitiness. I used to drink this up many moons ago, but is seems really bland now. Tastes change and so do people. It is not bad, just not really that good."
"Fine to drink in a pinch. Just dont seek it out."
"A decent low-end brown, widely available. Not something to look for, though. Pours a mahogany color with no real head to speak of, even on an agressive pour. Aroma is of malt and faint dark bread smells, maybe a tinge of coffee and chocolate. Taste is rather bland. Has hints of doughy yeast and a bit of hazlenut or another nutty flavor. Malt is not well balanced with the hops - too much on the malty side. It just doesn't have much in the way of flavor going for it. The mouthfeel is very carbonated, but somewhat watery for an English brown. It is quite drinkable, though, because it goes down pretty easy and has a low ABV %. A good intro beer for the uninitiated, I suppose, and an alternative to swill if you ever find yourself in a bar with no selection needing a beer."
"Drinkability: I paid $8.99 for a sixer of this stuff. As another reviewer said...""overrated"". Fairly quaffable, but too expensive and not good enough to warrant daily consumption."
"Drinkability: This beer is ok, and serves a jump point into ""good"" darker beers for the average macro drinker. I have had better brown ales recently, though."
"This beer could definitely use some more dimension in the malt department, and also way more hop flavor. For a good Northern English Brown Ale pass this up for Samuel Smith's Nutbrown. That stuff rocks."
"average brown. Too sweet, mild hops and undertstated nuttiness. Ok brown colour. Lots of better choices in this style. On tap at Underground Bluz in Orlando. Thin mouthfeel, fizzy, eh. Dry but drinkable. Fizzy but better than in the can. Thin mouthfeel."
"This beer pours a nice brownish red, with only a small head that quickly dissipates to nothing. The nose has definate maltiness, I can't smell any hops, but I know they exist. The taste, I can get some hops somewhere deep down, but the malt flavours come through strongest. The mouthfeel is oily and effervescent, I could definately drink more than two. Overall and ok brown ale."
"Very drinkable, and good session material."
"Nutty and brown with a slight bitterness that finishes well. Not too bad, but not really more than average. A common brew to have if there is nothing better. Could use a bit more malt."
"This beer poured a copper color. There was little lacing left behind. Nose was very mild, almost nutty. The taste starts sweet at first then finishes with malty. The hop presence is very low. Mouthfeel is slightly full and easy to drink."
"Reflection: I'm amazed that this is an English brew it seems like something one of our big commercial breweries would produce. I use this beer to get people to try darker beers than they would normally drink."
"Pours clear copper under a very short-lived 1/2 finger tan head that manages three or four spots of lace before fading completely. The nose has a bit of an edge to it, not hops, perhaps caramel, definitely malt, and fairly mild. The mouth is mildly carbonated and very clean/light. Taste? Not much there, really. Definitely some caramel, but rather thin. There are some English hops lurking here, too, providing a slight crisp bitterness to the finish. Not much aftertaste, though, leaving a rather watery impression. Why this beer is so popular is beyond me..."
"It finishes leaving your mouth dry yet slick with lingering rancid butter. This is an aftertaste. Not a finish, an aftertaste. Gross. Gross. Gross."
"I usually fear establishments where this is the most interesting selection. Sadly, tonight my home is that establishment (how i long for my apt with FFF on tap). It pours a slightly burnt amber with a small, quickly disappating 1 finger off white head. Aroma is very sweet with a touch of malt. Taste is a little on the bland side. Starts and finishes mildly sweet. Has a decent malt backbone but struggles to leave you with a memory, be it positive or negative. Could session this beer fairly easy if I ever had the need to."
"Well I must say it is funny how my tastes have changed over the past number of years. About 7 or 8 years ago I had thought that this brew was so radical based on early beer drinking experiences. Now I can say it is a just an ok, decent brown ale. It is a brew that I have been able to use in the past to get people to try something a little different with pretty good success. The brew pours to a mid brown color with a fairly good-sized head that dissipates very quickly and leaves hardly any lacing except at the very top of the brew. The scent of this brew is somewhat sweet from molasses and brown sugar along with buttery overtones. Not a bad smelling brew but not overly interesting to me anymore. The taste is nice, subtle brown ale with good Malt flavors and a little hop bit. Over all it is a solid brew, just not one that I normally go after these days."
"It may not be the most extreme brown ale on the market, but it is one of the most mild, drinkable brown ales man has created. Maybe they used a bit of trickery to get the flavor, but it is all right by me. The beer pours a nice brown color and has a tan head that fades quick and leaves a soapy lace on the side of my glass. It smells very sweet, with hints of brown sugar and molasses. The flavor is sweet and a bit nutty and finishes dry with a little hop bite. This is the best session brown ale available, IMHO."
"Short lived, foamy, light cocoa colored head leaves a few strings of lace. Transparent pale brown colored beer with a light caramel hue. Mild caramel malt aroma with a pinch of chocolate. Flavor is mild as well. Mostly chocolate malt with a creamy base. Creamy flavor does not carry over into the mouthfeel; light bodied beer without much carbonation. An easy drinking beer that will carry you through the night."
"An all right ale, but not the best brown I have had."
"Overall this is a good beer, not outstanding, but a good choice for something lite. Very easy to drink."
"Brownish-Amber color with a thin white head that dissipated quickly. An almost watered down malty taste (let's consider that I am drinking this shortly after finishing a Sammy Smith Oatmeal Stout...) This beer is light and easy to drink. Not one of my favorites, but it'll do in a pinch."
"This is the most refreshing beer I have ever had. It was a 90 degree night in August in NYC, I stroll into the bar and order a New Castle and it was more refreshing than water. But then thing is that its not watered down! Great taste but not too heavy. Probably one of the few beers where I can down a pitcher and not feel bloated."
"Enjoy!"
"I did not like this beer. This is a darker beer, not totally dark like a stout just dark brown. On first taste it wasn't that bad and indeed the first part of each sip was ok, however the aftertaste was awful. It was watery but the taste you did get was indescribable. like a base, it was bitter but bad bitter, like your drinking soap. Each sip made me gag, hence the 1 for drinkability. I thought i would like this beer but i will never drink one again."
"I was expecting a little bit more from this beer for some reason, it ended up being only a little bit better than average. Newcastle Brown is medium brown in color and sports average head. Smell is mildy malty, not very interesting or strong. Flavor is sweet, seems more sugery than malty. Some dark fruit taste in finish, but not enough to make the beer much better. This is a decent session beer, probably a good choice for a newbie, but not something I'll pay $6.99 for again."
"This one pours a brown caramel color. It has an off-white to tan color head that disipates fairly fast. It smells malty and somewhat nutty. It has a sweet malty flavor. Not very complex. Mildly bitter. It has a light mouthfeel, medium carbonation. It's a good brown ale but I've never understood why it gets so much praise. Don't get me wrong I like a Newcastle every once in a while but it is nothing too special. It's a very drinkable beer. If you've never had it, try it. If you drink it all the time, knock it off and do some experimenting."
"Drinkability: Not unpleasant. While I would like to have more distinct flavor in my beer, the widespread availability of this beer makes it a decent selection in macro-wonderland places that are trying to show a little sophistication by carrying this ale."
"The head is small, grayish-tan-white, still and quiet. It dies flat. The beer is a nice, dark mahogany. Nose is sweet and nutty... quite nice. A fruity (grapesy?), nutty front gives way to a greasy, smooth, lightly malty middle. It's a little watery and a touch papery. The finish is fairly bitter and the aftertaste inky and nutty. It's kind of plain: a sweetish, nutty brown with a little nice bread when very warm."
"Drinkability: Extremely easy to put back. Goes down way too easily. Nice session beer."
"Can: Poured a clear light brown ale with below average head with minimum retention. Aroma is quite weak with light roasted malts being noticeable. Taste is generally quite refreshing, with light roasted notes and a slight dry aftertaste. Overall, this is a refreshing drink, better then your average macros, but that is lacking something to make it really special."
"Bottle in a restaurant. Beautiful deep brown in color, almost garnet, thin beige head with minimal lacing. Aroma is of malt with almost no hops, and a tinge of wine like alcohol. Flavor brings a toasted and wood like flavor, then a wine like aftertaste. Light in body and easy drinking."
"Before I was a real BA this was one of my favorite beers. Since then my palate has matured. I had this beer for the first time in a long time last night. What was once a potent beer to me now tastes very thin and watered down. It poured with a thin white head that dissipated quickly to some lacy islands. The color is a medium brown and is transparent. The flavor is sour and sweet but not complex. Very thin on the palate and it leaves a lot to be desired. The finish leaves a bit of a malty taste on the palate, which is not bad."
"Taste is candy malts, a bit syrupy, with some notes of burnt toast in the aftertaste. Lightish carbonation and watery, especially (shallow) for a brown ale. Highly drinkable and available at many bars where the ""bottled euro"" is your only option.."
"--Joey"
"Very clear, ruby-brown colour topped by a dense tan head that settles to a nice lace after a few minutes. Mostly malty and nutty aroma with little in the way of hops. Some hop flavour and bitterness, but malty sweetness and grainy dryness dominate. The finish is mild, with a light bitterness and sweetness persisting. The light carbonation level and mild aftertaste make it quite drinkable, and the can is much better than the skunkiness often encountered with the clear bottles."
"A decent brown ale. Color is rich chesnut. Decent head, but kinda short lived. Heavy malty taste. Sweet, slightly nutty, with little hop. Did you know this beer has corn in it? Well, at least its not rice. I like this beer out of the 20oz. bottle, there is usaly a bit more sediment on the bottom. Good on a cold winter night."
"Not worth trying again."
"It poured a tranluscent brown with a nice brownish head. The aroma was pretty much malt and alcohol, not a bad smell just nothing outstanding. Then came the pleasant surprise of the taste. A good winey malt taste that had an alcohol bite. I immediately turned to my friend and let him know I had erred in putting of tasting this fine beer. He laughed but kept on sucking down Harp's. The feel was light and oily. I have added this to my pantheon. It would never replace Petrus or Aventinus, but being available on the street it will definately get tasted again and again. In fact I put it into practice at the next tavern we visited, even getting my friend to give it a try."
"Overall this is better than drinking MGD or Lite but there is no way in hell I'll ever pay a premium price for it....an decentBrown Ale that is way overpriced.."
"This beer was on tap. Poured a nice chestnut color with a small creamy looking head. Smell was nothing special. Just grainy to me. The taste was very smooth and mild. Not much other than slighly sweet malt. Hops almost non existant. Fairly thin mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. Good for a session."
"newcastle brown ale pours a mohogany color with a decent head that falls to mearly a ring after the fist drink. smell is of sweet malts very faint though. taste is underwhelming enough, but is drinkable anyway. tastes sweet with buttery undertones. not much hop character - malts are on stage here. not bold enough in the flavor dept.. rather watery mouthfeel with little carbonation. drinkability isn't bad but not mind blowing. had on draft where there was little else availible. i say ok to this one."
"Thx"
"poured out a dark, but faintly see-through brown. Head started out looking sopay and ended up being a film on top the brew. first whif from this one had a sligth skunk smell to it. Not a horrid skunk, just a not so fresh skunk. second whif was MILDLY of bitter chocolate, and nuts. First sip i could have sworn was water. second sip...grainy adjunct. Corn? Not a really impressive bottle. im not bashing,. i just think that this bottle was not choice. maybe ill give it another try later. just tastes bland to me. Im sure alot of people like it, just not for me."
"had this on tap for my 21st birthday, i was impressed. sweet taste and smell, quite drinkable, smooth and flavorfull.good beer if you want to try something new. proublably too sweet for the taste of some, sweetness with flavor is all right by me, sweetness with no purpose can be a let down at times, but this is not the case."
"Pours into the glass with a very clear chestnut brown color...large frothy head that doesnt last long before lacing over the top. Sweet nutty toasty malt aromas are very subdued with a faint but interesting twang of musty pine...very faint. Starts mild where the malt body seems almost diluted...hops are barely detectable but always sit in the background. The finish is quick and uneventful without the lingering malt after taste one expects from a brown ale. This is an OK session beer if you like a malty drink but it is a very mild and subdued brown ale....there are so many others with the big malt body you crave in this style."
"This is a good beer to sit with and enjoy slowly before grabbing another one."
"Pours medium hazy nut brown. Little or no head and no retention. Smells of alcohol with tones of toast, hops, and nuts. The taste sticks with the smell, being comprised of nutty and slightly hoppy flavors. For its medium strength, its mouthfeel and smoothness was very impressive."
"Skip this beer. If you're looking for a good brown ale, give Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale a try."
"This beer was nothing what I expected, in fact it is horrible. It pours a light brown with a semi/tan head that materialized then quickly faded. Lacing was nowhere to be found. The smell was of grain and alcohol, other that that no other tones found. The taste was a dark grain/corn almost grilled taste, you can taste the alcohol as well. A semi sweet malt character is traceable and a hop tracing at the end, but nothing that makes you say ""wow"" or even ""okay"". Simply put this was not a good beer. Light bodied for an ale (brown ale) and light and crisp. Not very smooth. I couldn't drink anymore of these, there are great brown ale's out there, this is not one of them. Try Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale."
"Overall- a delicious, smooth, refreshing brown ale. An excellent beer to drink with food. Better than Smuttynose- Old Brown Dog Ale."
"Final Thought: Despite a weak apperence and faint smell, this ale is alright by me."
"An easy drinking average brown ale all the way around."
"Overall, not a bad brown ale I guess. I don't think this is the best representation of a brown ale but I haven't tasted a lot of others for comparison. But the few that I have are much better than this one."
"A chestnut brown ale served with only the ghost of an off-white head. It smells vaguely sweet. Mild nutty maltiness with an unexpected bit of spice swirling in the light body. So there's hops hiding in here after all. Very easy to suck down. Not bad."
"Overall I would say this is an ok at best beer, easy to drink, but too watery for my taste, especially considering its price. Also I think this beer might benefit from a brown bottle."
"this is one of the most over-rated beers in the world, imho. it's flavors do a disservice to brown ales everywhere. pass on this one."
"Pours a dark brown, nice head and good lace retention. Smells (as you would expect) nutty, earthy and there is a bit of chocolate in there too, I think. I like this beer only slightly cooler than room temp., it adds an extra element to the taste. Smoothy and creamy on the palate. A good solid beer."
"This beer was unbelievable! Had a bottle at bennigans because I had never tried it before and wow, this beer just blew me away. Looks great and tastes even better. Goes down really great w/ fried food. A classic brew I'de gladly pay a premium for anytime."
"Had this tonight, was alot better, might have been a skunky bottle before"
"No indication of the abv anywhere on the bottle. Had to ask the waitress for an unchilled glass as the chilled is the standard in most chain restaurants. Nice dark amber color. After pouring, very small to no head. Very little lace encircles the glass. I thought it was low on carbonation and only medium in the hop department. I liked the smooth mouthfeel, however and find it very drinkable. Fruity taste towards the bottom like a lot of ales. Overall, a good brew that I recommend to everyone."
"Famous clear bottle, no freshness dating. Pours clear, golden almond in color. Not much head, small bubbles and leaves a little lacing. Malt on the nose and tongue. Flavor of nuts,caramel, vanilla. Chalky dryness in the finish. Nothing special, decent English ale, delicate flavors. Good with salads, cheese and nuts. A pleasant enough quaffer."
"Better bet than the big boys, but just barely."
"Newcastle's wide availability has made it my choice on several nights out where there were not many choices beyond US Macros."
"I'm going to have to try some fresh on tap to see what it really tastes like."
"When expecting crap, which for me has become a tendency at times among ""experimental english ales"" as I refer to anything i've never tried from the rosbifs. Since certainly, most bitter ales, a mon avis, are crap. But no, the newcastle brown was a completely gratifying brew, full of porter-like smells and tastes, a sweet but slightly bitter and coffee scented taste with some carbonation *down at the end* that simply enhances what's already been percieved. This is certainly one great brew that I will continue to drink."
"This beer isn't hard to drink. If it were otherwise better, I wouldn't mind too many of these. It just isn't quite as good as it could be."
"It has an odd color--it's a dirty brown in color. Almost like dirty, muddy water. It is slightly transparent, but not because the brown becomes thicker the closer to the center of the beer you get. It teases you with the transparency. The flavoring is equal parts malty and sweet (almost like butter candy). The finish on the beer is quite smooth that leave you (or me at least) wanting more."
"Had this brew on-tap to go along with my dinner. This beer on-tap is not that bad, almost like Guiness. In the bottle it's just terrible but on-tap it's decent enough. A brownish color with a good head on it. Smell consisted of some nutty aromas mixed in with some malts and a touch of butter (which would of been better if it wasn't there, the butter that is). Taste was much of the same as the aroma. Nutty, malty and buttery. It was balanced somewhat but it was on-tap. If I reviewed the bottle I'm sure it would be a different story. If I had a choice between Bud and other macros and this beer, I would take the Newcastle."
"Had this on tap for the first time the other day, and I couldn't find too much of an improvement over the bottled variety. Appearance was the same dark brown, with minimum head. Taste was the same slightly sweet malt flavor, nothing too overpowering. To me this is a great session beer, very drinkable, nothing too complex, but not completely bland either. Sadly this is often the best beer you can find at a lot of restaurants."
"it went from bad to worst. at first glance it looks kinda good, but the longer you stare at it it's just an ugly watery brown. the head on this one is crappy. smell was astringent alcohol. taste was the same. i've had this before and wasn't that impressed. now i'm just disgusted. they're never getting another dime from me."
"Pours brown with nice off-white head. Just the right amount of carbonation, not too much, not too little. Not a huge aroma, but it is pleasant with a nutty/roasted scent to it. But what really stands out is the taste. This is a great tasting beer. It tingles your tongue without being bitter and leaves you wanting more. Highly drinkable, I love this beer and could drink it anywhere anytime. Delicious!"
"s.d."
"Not a bad beer, it is going to have a hard time comparing to Indian Brown by DFH which was my other experience with the style. I have to say I like this style a lot, this beer just seems to be a downplayed version of its potential. Drinkable in the session sense of the word, but not something Im stumbling over myself to get another of either. Wouldnt avoid it by any means, but I cant see myself buying more with all the other options that are out there."
"Overall a very drinkable brew but I would much rather have other brown ales."
"I know that a lot of BAs jump all over Newcastle in discussion threads, but this is one of my old favorites- when I first began drinking non-American Lagers, this is one of the brews that taught me that there is more out there than BudMillerCoors. And for that I owe a debt, and I enjoy this beer. I have since learned that there are a lot better brews, but this is one of my ""comfort beers""."
"Not an exceptional beer, but good for something so heavily produced. Good every now and then."
"Despite what one might assume after reading the above, I don't think Newcastle Brown Ale is such bad beer. The off-flavor wasn't that offensive and there's just enough character to nudge this English brown ale into slightly better than average territory."
"I'll have to be trying this one again 'cause I think this particular bottle spent a little to much time in the light of day. too bad."
"With little head retention this beer was a translucent brown with reddish hues. Little lace. A rich nutty smell to go along with the roasted grains and a hint of chocolate. Taste was a crisp roasted character topped of with a earthy nutty feel. A smooth beer with a medium body. This was one of my favorites before I started expanding my beer awareness. Still a classic."
"Pours a copper, brownish color into the glass. Smell of malt, bread, but not a very strong smell. Tastes just a bit sweet, with a hint of toasted malt. No particular strong taste of anything. Very thin mouthfeel. This beer is however, very drinkable and would be a good session beer. Low alcohol content and thin mouthfeel. This isn't really a bad beer, it just doesn't stand out much. Certainly a step up from an American macro. This would be a good beer to get someone on the road to being a BA."
"Excellent Drinkability, particularly if you can get it fresh on tap."
"Drinkability  Nothing fancy, but definitely one that I wouldnt turn down."
"Gotta thank the Bum for sending me this hard to find, highly sought after, gem of a beer."
"Pretty easy to drink but there are so many good beers out there, why bother. Appearances can be deceiving. This is much, much better on tap."
"Nice auburn with yellow highlights. Medium creamy head that doesn't have too much retention, but laces well. Nose is English hops with apple skin notes, a butteriness, strawberry and faint banana esters. Taste is a big let-down. Just not too much there - the dull hop flavor is there in equal force as the toasted malt, but the finish is fast, weak, and just a harsh graininess. Very bland malt flavors for a brown ale - do they use coloring?. Pretty full body but with a biting carbonation. I did not enjoy this beer, although I hear it is better on draft. I won't buy it again in bottled form."
"Poured a nice tannish-red color, very clear. I got about a half inch head that lasted maybe three or four sips worth before leaving. Never seen bubbles like that before, very small and almost oily looking (this might have been from the glass I poured it into, I'm not sure) Smell was a crispy sweet malt. Taste was very smooth, tasted malty with a bit of hops underneath, but had not a lot of presence, It wasn't watery, but I had to really pay attention, the flavors disappeared fairly quickly. Mouthfeel was crisp. Not a beer that I would go out and buy a case of, but I certainly wouldn't turn one down if bought for me."
"It looked good but smelled a little off. The taste seemed totally different. It wasn't horrible, just not as good as I remember. The good old malty flavor never showed up, and it tasted like some other beer. Maybe I'm growing out of Newcastle, or maybe the tap line wasn't clean. Whatever the case, this is quite a fickle beer."
"light chocolate color with fair looking head. Smell of toffee and cookie dough. Tastes sweet and nutty with little hop flavor. As the beer warmed, the flavors rounded out better, though always with the sweet buttery flavors. The beer is a little thin."
"Poured from a clear 12 fl oz bottle. Light brown in color with a hint of red. Small head that doesn't last. Smell is somewhat malty and not much else. The taste is sweet, in the beginning and then a bit sour in the end. I don't remember this sour flavor at all as I haven't had this beer in the bottle in years. Overall not much there. I do prefer this beer on tap."
"Pours ba nut brown color, with a creamy white head, that lasts. Smells of roasted malt and hops. Medium bodied with a roasted malt taste that is finished off by a nice coffee and hops finish. A good solid, widely available beer, that is a good stand-by when better crafts or imports aren't available."
"Bottom line, it's a pleasant but unremarkable beer. I like to have it when I don't want a complicated beer."
"Drinkability: I guess I could drink a few, but I'd probably switch before I got to my second one."
"This beer poured a clear brown color with a little hint of read that ended in a thin tan head. Kind of looked like a whiskey. There wasnt much of a smell but it did smell of malt and caramel. The test is sweet of caramel and malt. This beer does go down pretty smooth and it is very easy to drink. This is a beer that you can have out while on the town somewhere with a pour beer selection and feel ok in your choice. I dont see my self every purchasing this beer at a package store when there are better Brown Ales out there, but out on the town I could drink this if it came down to it."
"The appearance was clear reddish brown with a small and unimressive head. The beer was seved to me too cold with a frosted mug. At the initial temperature, it tasted like a non descript mass produced product, i.e, very sharp and acrid and lacking any discernible taste. I let it warm up, and it got much better. At the proper temerature, this tasted mild and sweetish with a hint of hoppyness. Still lacking any special character, but a passable ale, a cut above the mega brewery swill marketed to the dumbed down masses."
"I'm giving this a high drinkability score because it's been an available standby for years. I've never had a skunky bottle(yet), but have had a couple of regrettable pints on tap. This ale would have gotten a much higher score if not for the experience of sampling many of the favorites on the BA site. This particular bottle pours a beautiful clear, brown amber with an ample off-white head. Nose is subdued, hints of sweet caramel and remote apples. In the mouth, it's rather average, with light carbonation. Hazelnut and walnut ride on a nice balance of mild hops and sweet malt. Not a strong ale, and finishes nicely crisp. To me, it seems a little watered down after what I've been having recently, but I still consider Newcastle Brown a relaible old companion."
"Overall, a touch above the average, bland macro. While it doesn't compare in flavor to a DFH Indian Brown Ale, this is still a decent brew and often the best choice at local bars."
"Not a bad ale. Kind of bland, but the few flavors i detected were quite unique. A touch sweet, and equal parts smooth and bitter. This reminded me for some reason of a wimps version of Guiness. Best enjoyed with a meal, as it is not a brew to get drunk on for you college students (1. It's too expensive, 2. It would take far too many). For the experienced beer drinker I think it would be worth a try."
"It is readily available at most bars and is often the best of a thin selection."
"Drinkable, a little too sweet, nothing exceptional."
"Taste of caromel and brown sugar which lingers just a bit to long."
"The taste is slightly sweet and malty. I hate to use the word watery but it always comes to mind when I think of Newcastle. It goes down smooth and clean, easy to drink. Mouthfeel is fine."
"after reviewing a porter a while back, it seems this was pretty similair, just missing the roasted malt maybe. a bit more to my liking, but thats just me."
"In the mouth, it's light and clean with a dry finish. Overall, it's very drinkable and wonderful. This is a lovely brew."
"Served from a keg Chicago. I figure the geography should be mentioned as this is likely quite different from what's served in it's homeland. Anyway, I got a rather nicely pulled draught at Pizzeria Uno, though it was served a little too cold. Nice ""beery"" smell compliments the warm, slightly roasty malt taste. Hops are slight and match well with rest of the beer. A fruity ale taste, almost like a Pete's Wicked, shows up at the finish. A pretty good one to have."
"Nice brown appearance with a quickly dissipating head. Smell had a slight skunkiness (reminded me of Heineken). Taste was crisp with just a touch of bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was light to medium with a decent dryness at the end. Easy enough to drink, but there are much better brews. However, I wouldn't refuse one if offered."
"Avoid the bottles. Especially 6 packs. The clear glass means that skunky beer is quite common. The 12 packs are protected from the light so I buy them when I can."
"- Backdated tasting: I first reviewed this beer on 19JUN03, this post is based on notes from that review. -"
"Light brown cola color (tea brown?) with a downy, light brown head. Smell is lightly sweetened caramel malt, but rather subtle. Tastes of sweet toasted loaf malts. I swear I'm picking up hints of graininess though. Finish is moderately bitter with lingering nutty fruitiness. A little watery on the palate, but goes down pretty easy."
"my final thought on this beer- no wonder newcastle hospital has a ward that caters only for newcastle brown addicts. there have been a couple of times i would have been a prime cantidate myself."
"ng"
"I cant believe that its in a clear bottle, until I tried this one I thought it was a brown bottle. It poured heavy into the glass with a ruby/brown color. the head was a firm tan color not to thick. It smelled of nut and tasted like old leather with a subtle nutty flavor and a little winey in the finish, but the end was nice and dry!!"
"The is a slightly above average beer that is highly drinkable. The only real fault I could find with this was the clear bottles, but fortunately this wasn't heavily lightstruck. Yes, this is a macro, but this is proof that even a macro-brewery can pay attention to quality."
"White frothy head subsides fairly quickly atop a brilliantly clear deep carmel brown beer. Aroma is of a minerlly water character and a bit of english hops with a touch of diacityl and esters. Taste is a letdown as this brown ale exhibits none of the pleasant dark grain flavors. Tastes of adjuncts to allow a clean flavor with a little carmel sweetness to balance the bitterness of a good english hop flavor. On the subject of mouthfeel this beer is too light to be called a brown ale and might be brewed with a little more dark grain charachter to give us something to taste. Fairly drinkable though it does have some flaws in the formulation of the recipe. In my opinion this beer is not very good and it is only popular because of the noteriety."
"Sweet and pleasant. Very much a session brew, this is a classic northumbrian brown ale. Much, much better on tap. I could drink this all night, easily. The beer that started it all for me. It's good to go back to every so often. Still a good brew even after all the big beers."
"Dark brown, cola color with a creamy white head. Fine looking friend. Nut and sweet malt bouquet. Malt dominates with a mellow sweetness and some buttery flavors, not in a bad way like Yak butter Tea though. Some hops show up but don't overpower. Smooth finish. This is a good ""gateway"" beer. I have always liked this beer and still do."
"NewCastle Brown Ale brings back memories of being stuck at an Army base in Seoul, RoK on New Year's Day, 1997 instead of Sydney, Australia. Newkie Brown was available in bottles at the local base club and between six of us and an eight hour span of time, we polished off the entire supply. It was one of the first beers I had that pointed me away from the macro world. I remember thinking how great a beer it was then. It's still a good session beer and definitely one I use as a conversion aid to steer macro-drinkers down the right path."
"Medium Brown color, medium white foamy head. Aroma is nutty and sweet. A nice malty beer. Milder flavor, smooth taste. Good hop/malt balance. Some malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is malty and slightly dry. A nice session and/or transition beer."
"Pours a light brown ruby tone with a thin off white amber head and does an okay job of leaving some speckled lacing. Smell contains some light fruit tones and some deeper roasted malts just a little bland not much of anything other than some mildly nut tone sweetness. Flavor is lacking it's not off or bad just very mild from the clear bottles, that I must note if bought in a 12 pack or case are much better than experiences I have had from light struck six packs or 22oz bottles. When nothing else is available better this could have the potential of being a throw back I can't justify paying as much as most places ask for it. Mouthfeel is thin I wish it had some body to it would make it much more palatable for me. Drinkability like I said no off flavors nothing outstanding middle of the road in taste, but overall this one is overrated and overpriced for sure."
"Thinner and more tasteless than a lot of ales, it's maltiness makes it more tasty than most of the macro's it's usually sold next to. A solid ale, if somewhat less than flashy."
"Very dark brown color, quickly disappearing head. A nut vanilla flavor emerged on the first taste. It had a nice silky mouthfeel and upon swallowing , a carmel like taste remained on the tongue.By the end of the glass, a bitterness became evident that would prevent me from having more than a couple of these at a sitting. Drinkable, but overhyped."
"The beer pours a light brown color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is malty with that English dry yeast smell; quite good. The taste is smooth and refreshing. It has a bit of maltiness to it, but there is a great balance between base and specialty grains. The mouthfeel is good. This is a light bodied beer. Macros beers don't always have to suck. This is a fine example of a decent macro; a real good drinking ale."
"good ole newcastle. theres not much to say about newcastle except it rules. sure there are alot of beers that taste better, but everyone has a fall back and this is mine. its available everywhere, it has its own unique sweet taste (which i enjoy very much) and it always hits the spot. this IS the session beer/old buddy i will never grow too cool to enjoy."
"This draft brew poured a medium head of creamy fine off-white bubbles and a transparent brown body. It had an average strength malt-spice aroma. It starts off with a mildly fizzy malt-hop flavor that finishes with a malt spice aftertaste and an average lacing. I can only rate this sample as average, but I know I have had better samples of this brew. It is a good available beer that can usually be found in the typical places that Budweiser or Miller can be found."
"This had no real taste. The closest thing that I could say it tastes like is water. The only flavors I noticed were a grassy hop flavor and corn. Might have been skunked but the aroma was actually quite decent. I'm going to try this on-tap to see if it's any better there."
"Very smooth, perhaps the water is as good as they say. Drinkablity is fairly high, but I would search out something with a bit more taste."
"Notes: I love brown ales, but Newcastle never fails to disappoint me. Better on tap than in bottles. Prone to skunkage. Overpriced and overhyped."
"Although the bottle was dated 12/03, there was a noticible staleness to it. Musty and on the verge of going sour. Otherwise drinkable, and went OK with some fried chicken. Don't think I'll find myself seeking out one of these again, though."
"12 oz bottle. Poured a dark amber color, with a good head that slowly receded. Not muck lace to be seen. Aroma of malt and hops. Taste is weak and almost not there. Only a slight malt and hop hint in the finish. Fairly good carbonation, gives it a good mouthfeel. I just don't think these brown ales are for me."
"The taste and color reminds me of some red beers. Somewhat nutty but presented itself more as a typical light bodied brew. You really have to search for the flavors, as it's not an intense beer."
"This pours with a creamy light tan colored head that settles over very attractive clear brown liquid with a hint of red to it. The nose is rather light and non-descript...but it does have some lightly roasted maltiness, a hint of chocolate and a small amount of fruitiness nestled within. The taste is light bodied on the palate, with flavors of roastiness, a good dash of malt sweetness, some very delicate hints of diacetyl, and a minimal hop bitterness. This beer goes down way to easy...the ultimate session ale?? Perhaps! Before I realize it the glass is just about empty...""Hon, grab me another Nukey Brown would ya?"" The relatively low alcohol content makes this drinkable in great quantity. Finishes up with a nice lightly dry/bitter note that begs another healthy sip...cheers!"
"Brilliantly clear, ruby-red dark caramel in color forming a sea-foam light-beige head, requiring a vigorous pour to achieve this. The head has very poor retention and minimal to absent lacing. Aroma is very English...buttery and nutty with a fruity ferment, slightly skunked owing to the clear bottle, with notes of toffee, brown sugar, ""round"" English hops, and perhaps a little chocolate malt. Mouthfeel is spritzy at first, but then very mild and smooth with a suprisingly thin body. Taste begins with some carbonated acidity, followed by some herbal flavoring hops...toffee, chocolate malt, some mellow toasted marshmallow, followed by some earthy malts, ruddy hops, and a mild, slightly sweet bitterness in the finish. Last time I drank this, I remember it as being horrible, but on today's drinking, it's really not too bad. It's relatively easy to drink owing to it's smooth carbonation, thin body and light mouthfeel, and it's malts and hops are at least a little more substantial than other similarly trendy beers in the same price-range."
"Goes down just fine, and the mouthfeel was kinda watery. Not really impressed, but then again, wasn't expecting alot. A good all day swilling beer, to be sure."
"The first time I had this beer, quite a while ago, I thought that it was too strong. Now, I think it has very little taste whatsoever (and my brother, normally a lager drinker, agrees with me........which has to say a lot). All in all, a disappointment."
"I must admit I was disappopinted the visually a nice looking beer but once I drank it not much to talk aabout. Very middle of the road. Perhaps I am not a big fan of this style of beer but I found it too skunky and not enough flavour more of a washed skunky flavour. I'll try another one again to make sure it was not the bottle I had..."
"This brew had a small head when it arrived to the table. The body was copper colored. There was carbonation observed rising to the top. It had good lacing on the sides of my glass. The taste was smooth, watery and on the thin side. In my opinion, this brew is much better when it is bottled rather than when it is served on-tap."
"Deep dark red with off-white head. Very light cola aroma. Extremely light taste. This is one spent beer with no soul. There is no bitterness or hops. The mouthfeel is light, like old tea mixed with old cola and water. What is all the hype about? This is the second time I have had this beer, with the same results. I did not put up my first review, because it was so against the grain, but wheres the beef?"
"This was THE beer for me in my college days, me and my old roommate literally had a sea of spent, empty Newkie Brown bottles covering a good portion of our kitchen floor at all times (between trips to the bottle depot). These days it is rather mediocre, but a nice standby beer to fall back on. Colour is a flat mahogany, head pours big, tan and foamy, but disappears soon. Small amount of lacing. Aroma is sweet with a very faint hint of hops. Flavour is sweet malt, and a touch astringent (light struck from the clear bottle, or presence of preservatives?), with the slightest finish of floral hops. Mouthfeel is watery, but it goes down smooth. Nothing too special, but I could drink a lot of these in a sitting. I have in fact."
"Pours a brown/amber color, which shows red when held up to light. The head is puffy/foamy--resembling a cloud. The darkish color of the beer in contrast to the tan of the head makes for a nice looking glass of beer. Not a very strong or particularly good or bad smell. A somewhat stronger and somewhat unpleasant smell does emerge from a freshly opened bottle though. The taste is not bad, but nothing to be very excited about. This is a fairly smooth beer, but as with most aspects of this beer, the feel is not very impressive."
"I feel bad writing this because I used to love this stuff, but either my tastes have matured or this beer has gone downhill. Nice dark brown color with a thin beige head, but no aroma at all. Very watery mouthfeel leads to a slight malt flavor with very light hops bitterness. A little on the sweet side. Faint hop aftertaste. Low in character and flavor. Very bland. Time to move on."
"Bland and boring, yet fairly drinkable on someone else's coin."
"One of the few Brown Ales I actually like. New Castle has a distinct taste to it, a little bit different from most other brown ales. If I had to choose a dark beer, New Castle would definitely be my first pick, even though I am more of a domestic beer kind of guy myself."
"Drinkability: Nothing in this beer would make be want another. It's rahter plain and has a different flavor to it. Not one I'd suggest. The bottle states ""The one and only"" which applied perfectly to me. It's the ""one and only"" time I'll have this beer."
"It takes a lot for me to flame a beer, but this one deserves it. Marketing gone wild, this brewery has just earned a vocal detractor."
"What a difference betweent the bottle in draft. Had some bottles at home, but had a draft last night at the bar over a Big 3 or other Macros. What a difference. Still not the best brown ale or as good as it was in college, but I was know to drink Beast Ice back then. The color is a little richer, it actually has a head, and the taste is not nearly as watery. Much better than the bottle."
"This beer isn't too bad. Not nearly as good as some would have you believe. It pours a decent brown, with some nuttiness and maltiness in the aroma. Similar tastes as the aroma. Definitely nothing special, but decent as compared to many macros. It did make Maggie Thatcher rather tough!"
"Here's an absurd comparison for you: Newcastle tastes kind of like tea sweetened with brown sugar. Low carbonation, small head, handsome coloration. I found it to be almost too sweet; seems to be suffering from the J.W. Dundee's Honey Brown syndrome. I can see myself picking up a 20oz of this some time, but kind of like a mouthful of marzipan, it's almost too delectable to consume more than one of at a time."
"Pours a perfect head. 1/2 inch thick and almost all of it remains. The color of the beer is a little light for my preference. Smells strongly of coffee. More than I have smelled before. Also smells of toffee and butter pecan. Tastes very light. Has no kick, almost watery. Pretty drinkable because it's so light. Also kind of bland."
"This is an easy to drink beer, real smooth, no strong bitter after taste, no heavy sweetness just a smooth brew. This is one of those beers that dragged me away from the US macro crap, now with my new found knowledge(Thanks to BA)there are many other beers pulling me away from the ""one and only"". This is one of the fall backers though, one that if you don't see something you want but they have this you take it rather then macro crap. Pours out a brown in color with a medium beige froth. Only one aroma a slight malt nothing else, nothing more. Taste is pretty much the same a light malty taste slight nutty taste and a little roastyness. Like I said this is now a fallbacker."
"It pours out a dark brown color, with a bit of a creamy head. This beer tastes kind of roasted, not much of a hop presence that i can detect. Seems like some roasted malts in there. This is pretty expensive, i dont see it being worth the almost nine bucks that it costs for a sixer of these around here."
"Give 'em Hell, Newcastle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This beer pours an opaque brown as the name states. I've had this beer off tap and in a bottle and it is one of the few beers that doesn't have a large difference between the two. There is nothing too special in the aroma. For taste, this is one of my favorite beers. The taste is extremely smooth and easy to drink and it has more character than most beers that are that smooth."
"Poured a reddish brown with an off-white head that fades pretty quickly. Fruit, caramel and nuts come across in the aroma. Flavor of sweet caramelly biscuits are most dominat with a relatively subdued flavor overall. Moderate bitterness leaves a slight tang on the back and sides of tongue."
"Poured with a light brown head that didn't seem to stick around very long. Sweet and rich malty flavor with just a touch of hops. At crappy bars, it's always a great relief to see this on tap. When I go out to buy fridge beer, though, I never go specifically in search of Newcastle. It's just an average beer, and there are many better browns out there."
"I have really been looking forward to trying this beer, but had been a bit apprehensive because it seems to be available at just about every retail outlet in this area - a bad sign to be sure. As I suspected its popularity denotes that it is a bit more of a mass market beer than most BAs like. A pleasant enough dark amber color, clear, but with little off-white head, and that didn't last long. Very little lacing. A bit of sweet roasted nose and perhaps some maltiness. The taste was nice but very light and middle of the road; no strong palate sense here. A bit watery but smooth mouthfeel. OK for the type."
"Not a fabulous beer, but at the same time its not all that bad. I regularly enjoy this at my local pub for $2 a pint, and you won't find me complaining about it."
"Pours with little to no head. Zero head retention. Apperance is pretty nice, typical brown ale, nice rich amber color. Not much on the nose, a little malted roastiness, but nothing to write home about. Taste was sweeter than I had remembered. I have had this brew in England and wonder how different it is over there, or if it was about the same. Roasted malts with slight nutty finish, though it could use more nut flavor. Overall a very smooth beer, but one thats just a bit short in all catagories."
"PS: maybe the bars that I frequent here just have bad lines or something but I always think beer tastes fresher and generally better when it is on tap in Canada."
"Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale but put into perspective it won't disapoint."
"For some reason I thought that this beer would be enjoyable. I was wrong. Poured a light brown with a minimal head. Malty sweet aroma, some cooked veggies. Taste is mild malty to start out, with cooked vegetables, and a tiny bit of earthy hops. Kind of light-bodied, which was surprising, with a crisp mouthfeel. Due to the low-alcohol content this is a pretty good session beer, but I don't think I'll ever buy this one again."
"Comments: It looked good but it was all downhill from there. It was like watery sweet red wine with a bitter aftertaste."
"Brown amber in color with a nice head. Has a nutty aroma with some floral tones. Tastes of good malt with nutty flavor and some sweet fruity notes. Hops are present but lack a little. Smooth finish with good nut flavors and malt balance. Feels a little watery not to solid in the case of brown ales. Its a drinkable brown but I prefer more balanced nut body. It's a little on the weak side."
"later note: I was right about the corn and sugar."
"Quyite a drinkable beer..but not at all great or even very good."
"I do not understand the popularity of this beer. I can only assume that some folks think its cool since its an import, however, I find this beer to be average in every way. It looks like a nice brown ale but it has a very watered down mouthfeel to me. It also lacks any distinguishing taste that makes me want to come back for more. At best I would describe the taste as bland. It is a smooth beer, so I can see why you could consume a number of these, but why would you want to drink an average beer when so many good ones can be had."
"I can taste the malt but it is like it is slightly sour. Rather unimpressive stuff."
"This beer usually does not disappoint. I haven't had this one on tap for years. The beer poured a deep copper color and had a large lacey white head. This sample just tasted very fresh. There was a nutty sweet aroma to the beer. Almost perfect balance of hop bitterness to the sweet malt. Great tasting and still remains one of my favorite brown ales."
"Newcastle proves that dark color does not necessarily equal strong flavor. However, the flavor is good and even better after the first!"
"An average beer, period. Color is nice....clear brown with little to no head and no lacing. The aroma is a very mellow sweet malt. Mouthfeel is disappointingly watery. Taste is slightly nutty and toasty. This beer just doesn't excite me like a good brown ale can do to me like Sam Smith's Nut Brown. Drink this only if it's on tap or if you like watery brown beer."
"Many of my friends' favorite beer and used to be one of mine before I developed my palate. The color is a copper to brown color with a small head for an English Ale. The only thing that describes the taste is nutty, a little sweet, probaby why most non beer drinkers like it. Lacks sophistication, maybe I have enjoyed to many hoppy brews to enjoy the nutty maltiness of this one. It's wide availability has made it a mainstay at the college bars and parties I have frequeted for the past 4 years. It's a shame, those that think this is a great beer do ot know what they are missing. It is good, but just that."
"Clear brownish color topped by a beige head that retained well and left nice lacing patterns. Aroma was pretty benign, taste was malt accented ,slightly nutty, and a bit fruity. Mouthfeel not bad and drinkability is good as it was smooth and fairly refreshing. Not bad considering it's from a mega brewery. Glad I finally got around to trying it."
"EDIT: the malts really come out as this beer starts to warm up. I enjoy its taste and mouthfeel much more than when it came out of the fridge."
"Tried it again recently. I have to say it slips down alot easier now than it did before so I changed my ratings a little. :)"
"Pours a clear, deep auburn with a dense ivory colored head that slowly fades leaving a thick lacing on my pint glass. I think this beer was light-struck as it smells very skunky. I can smell some maltiness, but skunk prevails. Caramel taste, nutty too. Starts out sweet, but finishes dryer. Light to medium body. Its not too bad. I'll try to get a non-skunked one to review at a later date though."
"This English Ale is a deep reddish-brown color and does not leave much of a head. Upon opening the case I found clear bottles however, none were skunked (at least not at about halfway thru). The aroma seemed a bit week with caramel and some nuttiness. The taste had a caramel presence and I describe the mouthfeel as kind of thin, not much there. The drinkability is O.K and this is one beer that I will not consume this very often."
"Poured with a good sized, coarse, tan head on top of the clear, brownish-red beer. Yummy diacetyl, hops, and roasted malt on the nose. Toasty and nutty tasting with a decently dry finish from the mild hops and grains. This is one beer that should be consumed on the warm side rather than cold or even cool, especially the bottled version. The draught version is much better, especially the aroma."
"A rather disappointing brown ale. After sampling quality browns like Smutty's and Dogfish's I may have been expecting too much. A red hued light brown body and light and rapidly receeding head is the product of a hard pour into a pint glass. Aftertaste is sweet and mellow. Flavor is rather simple and characteristics are few. Carbonation may have been a little heavy and caused flavors to be less discernable than otherwise. Its a drinkable session beer, if you want a boring and rather expensive session. At 36 dollars a case and many better offerings out there for significantly less money I will opt otherwise."
"Pours reddish-brown with a finger's worth of cakey head that has an average but rather uneventful lifespan and minimal lacing. Smell is quite sweet and somewhat malty but is nonetheless rather weak and uninspired. Taste is likewise somewhat bland though drinkable. Quite sweet at the start and dries out to a crisp finish rather quickly. Malts are present but even less than in the nose. Mouthfeel is rather oily. At least in the bottle this beer is hardly a great one; my last on tap experience was much better."
"Drinkability & Notes: A decent brown ale and that is about it, quite easy to find this beer as a good session brew. Somewhat of a cult classic in the US as well."
"I don't hate it, I just find little to like."
"Cheers"
"Crystal clear reddish brown beer with amber highlights. It pours with a thin, off white head that fades quickly. The aroma has a sweet caramel smell with a hint of nuttiness. The flavor is very mild, with grassy notes and a touch of sweetness on the finish. The aftertaste is a bit bitter and metallic. The mouthfeel is coarse, with the carbonation dominating the palate. Drinkability is average. This beer is not as good as my memory thought it was."
"M"
"This brown ale poured a dark brown color with a half-inch foamy head and pretty good retention. Very nice, tight lacing around the glass. There was a very faint hop bouquet scent, but overall not too much happening in the smell department. The ale's taste was of lightly roasted nut, very crisp and clean taste. I detected a slight, nonintrusive licorice taste, too. The medium body had a creamy mouthfeel and a nice tingle on the tongue. My draught of Newcastle Brown Ale was a pretty good pint, overall. While I've had better brown ales, but this one's not too shabby."
"This is darn good stuff. It was my first taste of an imported beer when I was a wee lad under the age of legal consumption. It was good then, and it is good now. It will always be a stand-by for me, if there is nothing around I haven't had. I like the deep brown shade it is, with the light brown head. Being the good BA that I am, I had my fiancee give it a go. Boy did she dig it! It's now one of her favs. She went from Natty to Newcastle."
"This beer poured into the glass a medium brown tree bark color. The head was small and tan in color, no lace seemed to be present. The aroma was of a roasted malt, some sugar, and nuts, if you try real hard there is a slight slight hint of alcohol that is there. Not present all the time. The taste as watery with roasted malt and hints of nuts, finished some what lite sweet. It was better then drinking what else they had on tap."
"The tap version is far better than the bottle version but I think there are still better brown ales out there. It is drinkable but it still deserves the nickname of ""Dog""."
"The beer pours a nice limpid brown color, the head portly, the texture frothy; the lace left behind thick sheets to coat the class. Nutty sweet nose, caramel, with lots of malt, pleasing enough for me. Richly sweet at the start, top middling and the finish mildly acidic, patiently hopped and a nice dry malt aftertaste. Clean and satisfying, and a beer that is much better from the tap than the bottle."
"Poured a very deep brown color with surprisingly one of the best aromas i've ever encountered. It is sweeter than other brown ales i've tried. Though not quite as full of taste and the mouthfeel was kind of thin. This beer goes good with a burger and not to expensive so I will buy this beer again and I might eventually work it into the regular schedule."
"12 oz clear bottle. Poured a clear dark brown in color with a light tan head. Aroma consisted of malt, brown sugar and a feint nutty scent. Body was thin and watery. Flavor has a slight nutty taste with a sweet malt finish. Commercial appeal has helped increase this beer's popularity probably more so than it should, but other than the thin body, this is still an enjoyable brown ale."
"Pours a deep brown colour topped by a medium white head that leaves lace down the glass as you drink it. The aroma of this beer is sweet. The taste is also sweet with hints of grain and corn. One of the best English Brown Ales. Quite impressive brew..."
"Clear brown in color, decent white head, malty and nutty aroma. starts sweet with a mild nutty flavor, very bland, body thin and watery, I think this brown ale is overated there are much better ones out there, I have had it more than a few times and dislike it more each time."
"This was the only decent beer to be had at the Fridays in Hartsfield during a layover. I must have forgotten about my first few experiences. The color is brown (naturally) and there is less carbonation than other ales, at least IMO. The smell is not good and that may have to do with the clear bottles. The beer just tastes nutty and flat to me."
"With a fairly aggressive pour, I got a quickly dissipating off-white head atop a clear, light brown liquid. Smell is funky -- aroma is of dirty socks at first, but after it sits for a while, hints of nuttiness linger. Taste is above average. Starts off with a subdued nut flavor with some malt profiles. Mouthfeel is rather thin and watery for the style with an unappealing finish. Pretty easy to drink, but I wasn't up for another one. I used to love this beer, but I guess my palate has evolved over the years. Not bad, but there are much better brown ales out there."
"Took a chance on this last night. Always like it on tap, but alas, there are no taps at store 2-4. Didn't bother to pour it, drank it right from the bottle. Carmel, flat kind of taste. You could sense the hops if you really concentrated. It didn't take away from the taste of the anchovies on my pizza either. At least it wasn't skunked like my last 3 attempts. Always a last ditch beer, and pick from the back of the cooler if you know what I mean."
"Initial pour leads to a good head that lasts for a few minutes.  A darker than average color, reminds me of deep brandy.  The smell lends itself to a mild coffee with a hint of something sweater.  The taste is very smooth with good carbonation, then it opens up into roasted grain with a caramel overtone, regressing into a slight bitter aftertaste.  Overall a very good beer, that is extremely easy to drink."
"This brown ale pours a good deep brown color with a decent head which fades fairly quickly. Its unique aroma has definite flavors of caramel and even a little hint of coffee and/or chocolate. The taste has a rich maltiness to it with a lightly sweet caramel flavor. It is smooth and drinks down fairly easy. I like this brew okay and I'll probably end up getting it again, especially since I can usually only seem to find it in 18oz bottles."
"*Note:  One of my bottles of this was skunked and I mean skunked bad.  Why oh why do they use clear bottles???"
"I swear this looks darker in my clear beer glass than it does in the clear bottle (?!). As soon as the cap snaps off I get a nasal infusion of hops (?!). Strange. The nose offers complete toasted brown sugar even if it's a bit shy. Hops and spices are evident as well. Good, dry, nutty, charred sugar and crisp hop bitterness could be a little more integrated/smoother. The very active carbonation gets in the way a bit. Worth drinking."
"This use to be one of my favorites, but just doesn't really do it for me anymore, still a nice, somewhat unique tasting beer."
"Pours a nice clear brown with hints of red.  Head looked impressive at first but quickly faded.  Has a sweet caramel malt flavor accompanied by a slight nut flavor.  Very little carbonation, tiny bubbles tickle your tongue.  This buttery brew slips down your throat.  The finish is rounded out by a nice dry bitterness."
"Clear, russet in color with a tan head that holds OK but soon drops to a collar and limited surface covering. The aroma is of a gently fruity and lightly caramel malt. It's in a clear bottle but it's not skunked. The body is light with a moderate carbonation giving it a smooth mouthfeel. The flavor offers a lightly sweet, caramel maltiness and subtle earthy hop flavor (Fuggles?) that's supported by an underlying bitterness. There's also a nutty and buttery character that's very nice. It finishes fairly dry with a softly lingering residual maltiness. A very drinkable beer that offers some nice characteristics."
"Drank Gallons of ""Newky Brarn"" straight from the Bottle when I was an Undergraduate Student in Northern England 1987-1990. So I decided its time to try it again in the USA. Its not changed at all !!. Pours a dark amber, brown colour. A tight 1/4"" head at first, but this soon dissippated. Very little nose, but a solid mouthfeel, malty with that unique Newcastle Brown Ale trait. Dryish, almost nutty, with a faint hoppy bitterness in the lingering aftertaste. Moorish, and quaffable. My only complaint is that there are better, but lesser known, Brown Ales both sides of the Atlantic that are (incorrectly in my opinion) compared to this beer. Possibly over-rated, but a damn good Session Beer."
"Dar amber brown in color with a fabulously thick and creamy off-white head, thick sticky lace, lots of carbonation.  Possesses a truly strange medicinal aroma, not at all like any brown ale I have had, not a hint of malt.  Taste begins with toasted malts, followed by rather prominent alcohol notes, then strong, though not overpowering hops.  Finish is dry with a bit of residual bitterness.  In all, I am somewhat disappointed, brown ales are one of my favorite styles, I had expected more from this beer.  Newcastle is not bad, but there are many brown ales that are better."
"anyway, it is nutty and malty. pours nice with a foamy amber brown. like a brown should be, but there was just something i did not like."
"I am not a fan of sweet tasting beers like this one. It makes it a chore to drink. If the malt wasn't respectable I'd really hate it, in other words the malt saves the beer (saves it from being dreadful). The taste does grow on you."
"Beer #2 from the Bennigans outing. Tastes fresher on draft. The skunky ""Heineken"" flavor was absent. I did detect a bit of the infamous mediciney aroma this time. It reminds me of a certain brand of mouthwash. Flavor and drinkability was good despite the slightly ""off"" aroma."
"I can't quite put my finger on why I don't like this beer. There is just something about the taste that makes it hard to swallow, and the smell is very medicinal. The bright spot for this one is the apperance."
"The smell isn't good, the taste is something of a bitter medicinal blaaaahhh and I just don't like how the brown stuff looks in the clear bottle. Same when I poured it out...I dont know, it doesnt look good. This to me is just another bad English brown. Oh the dirty brown."
"The Newcastle Brown Ale 6 pack I picked up was on sale for $5.99 down from $8.99.  Had it not been for the price, Newcastle Brown Ale would have sailed off into my BeerAdvocate oblivion. Ive had this ale before (many times) and never really developed a taste for it, and I wouldn't do reviews without the Beer in front of me."
"This is one good brown ale.  The aroma and flavor are nice and nutty, but not too much so.  The head laces along the glass as you go.  One of the better btown ales I have had.  Prost!"
"Great color, somewhat thin but distinctively smokey flavor and I thought it had a better head than seems to be the general consensus here. I was worried about the clear bottle leading to skunk city but that wasn't the case at all."
"I found myself searching for something to like about this beer, but it just didn't impress me.  Better than a US macro, but that's not much of a compliment."
"Thin bodied, mildly bitter at start turning pucker/sour and evidence of corn adjucts in the finish.  One might think it's been ignorantly packaged in a clear bottle, however, I'm sure this is intentional.  Overpriced, overrated, why bother?"
"highly carbonated.  deep brownish amber color.  faint malt nose.  highly carbonated at first but soon subsided.  dark head but quickly dissipated.  this has a rich bittery caramel taste."
"Medium brown color, decent fluffy head. Definite funky, stale smell. I worry about the clear bottles. Middle of the road taste, I expected more malt taste. Some sweetness, maybe a little carmel malt hint. Slight hoppy finish. Thinner body than expected, a bit watery.  Overall, just a little off, of being a balanced tasty beer. Maybe a stale bottle, I will try it on tap sometime, it's gotta be better."
"Dark tan color with a head that dissipated fairly quick.  Malt nose with a medicinal overtone.  Has a sweet, toasted, lighty hopped flavor with a strong yeast presents.  Finishes dry with a slightly oily feeling. Nothing standouts and nothing offensive, just middle of the road beer."
"Newcastle Brown Ale:  To be honest, a “brown” ale doesn’t strike me as the greatest marketing ploy, but what the heck.  It’s a clear brown, with nice head retention, very nice Belgian lace.  Sweet molasses aroma.  Nice toasted malt taste but leaves my mouth feeling almost slimy, my tongue feels like I’m coming down from Novocain."
"Medium brown with thick lasting head.  Smells somewhat medicinal.  Somewhat sweet, but sweetness comes from corn, and not so much from the malt.  Mass produced tasting.  An average beer."
"Clear copper-brown, decent 1/2 inch head but its gone in 40 seconds.  Smell is a little funky/skunky.  Tame malt flavors, slight toffee.  Hoppier than some Browns.  Traces of off tastes.  Thin body and mouthfeel, a little roasted flavor in the aftertaste...mediocre, drinkable if nothing else is available.  I was surprised to notice the hops, though they were by no means aggressive."
"Boring really, personally i thought it was ok, no taste, not offensive or anything. but hardly worth the effort."
"I have a really good friend that drinks the hell out of these.. I see a dark brown beer.. with decent head and retention.  The mouth is good but could be a little smoother. Slight sweet nose.. It should have more flavor in the mouth and is a liitle thin."
"The aroma was slightly skunky, but of course, the clear bottle I am sure contributed to it. Slight head, but nice color. Tasted better as it warmed up, giving way to some malt taste. Bell's and Boyne River make a much better brown, but this is decent.  Not something I'd buy unless it was the best thing on tap."
"Not as good as I remember in the old days when it came in a stubby brown bottle.  The clear bottle, and brew now marketed to the masses, probably has a different formula as well.  This beer has a dark amber-brown, nutty malt aroma, smooth and mellow malt flavor, some bitter hops at the finish, long dry hop with a malt aftertaste."
"Clear dark copper / light brown hue topped by a respectable head.  I was a bit wary because of the clear bottle, but thankfully this bottle wasn't at all skunked.  Soft fruitiness, biscuity and nutty malt notes w/ a slight sugary sweetness in aroma.  Mild earthy fuggles hop nose.  Light bready malt notes and residual sweetness from the low hop bitterness.  Nothing outstanding flavorwise, but there's enough character to keep me wanting more. The real strength of this beer is its drinkability.  The light body, moderate carbonation and decent flavor make this an excellent session brew.  Watch out if you get a skunked bottle-- when you do Newcastle is repugnant."
"This beer poured a light brown color and formed a small off white head that left no lace. An aroma of malt and hops. A flavor of malt and hops. I always seem to give this one a benefit of a doubt, but I always am disappointed. Even off the tap in England and the bottle, it wasn't any better. Just seems to be a very weak beer."
"Found on tap at the Outback Steakhouse, always a good choice, a sweet brown, smooth an easy 16oz ale to drink.  The ABV is 4.7%."
"for an english brown ale, this is lame. for a commercialized, 'brewed for american tastes' ale, pretty good.  it has a light, pleasant english brown ale aroma and character,  a refreshing effervescent mouthfeel, and an easy drinking quality that makes it too easy to chug.  a definite good cross-over brew for those that are entering the world of ales.  i laughed at that print ad that proclaimed ""we don't use a dark bottle to hide behind anything",  that's because there is nothing to protect!"
"A very good English Brown Beer.  Slightly sweet with a hint of chocolate.  Smooth finish.  This beer looses its character quickly with age so the fresher the better (as with all beer and ales)."
"A good beer, but not great. I like brown ales. Definitely better on draft than in those clear bottles."
"Yeah, this is British ale, I should say."
"48"
"This is a very overrated beer, really quite bland with a buttery caramel sort of taste, which isn't too pleasant, i'm sure it was pretty good, 20 or 30 years ago though."
"Pours a clear brown color, with a small off white colored head.On the nose the aroma is of faint malt, light buttery or toffee aroma as well. The same story of the palate faint malts, buttery, slight grain, nice hop flavor. A decent brown ale. Very drinkable brew"
"Dark brown clear, wonder if there are spoilage issues with an import in a clear bottle. Pretty steady head.  Aroma is fairly strong and unique, neither malt nor hops.  Somewhat full carbonation, but thin mouthfeel.  Not a lot of taste overall. Dry feel to middle and end. In the past I have liked this brew with food.  I think I used to like this more than I do now."
"This is what people drink when they ""think"" they're drinking good beer and don't know any better."
"Bottled is pretty homogenized in character.  OK, but nothing special."
"Maybe not ""the best brown," but I like this stuff all the same.  very smooth."
"Notes: This brew uses corn grits, added liquid sugar and is pasteurised. Hardly a ""real ale"" from England. It's very much a commercial beer these days, and long gone is the age old ""goodness."" It's now another brew victim to global fame and demand. Despite this, it's drinkable. Not the best brew, or Brown Ale even. In fact, some might find its claimed ""special flavour"" hard to swallow. Newky Brown uses the tag line ""The One and Only"" ... let's hope so."
