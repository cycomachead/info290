"O: A nicely done English style brown ale."
""
"O: Very much an ""American"" style brown ale.  Robust roast, robust sweetness, robust bitterness.  Top-notch.  Still, not quite what I am looking for in a brown ale."

"Smooth for 7% ABV with a balanced profile of nutty, toasted and sweet malt notes. Hints of roast and sweetness but nothing really interrupts the Brown aspects of this one."

"Outlier review - too much carbonation for me"
""

"A solid all round brown ale. Pours a deep rich brown with a foamy head. Toasted nut on the nose, which really comes through on the palate. Smooth mouthfeel, disguises the 7% well here."
"Good But not the best"

"Overall, this beer is mild and sweet without being cloying, and very easy to drink.  You would never surmise the 7% ABV."

"Boffo Brown Ale's delectable nutty, malty notes make it the beer version of Pringles – once you pop you can't stop. Heck, I tried to resist but next thing I knew the whole bottle was gone. Of course, this also makes it pretty mainstream-friendly too - nearly as unremarkable as it is nice."

"Pours a dark brown color with a very small brown head that dissipates quickly. A little bit of lacing around the edges. Aroma is of sweet caramel malts and molasses, with roasted nuts and chocolate. A hint of booze. The taste is rather similar. Sweet roasted chocolate malts, molasses, a hint of coffee, and a hint of caramel as well. Has a nice earthiness to it. Some lightly roasted nuts. Has a very pleasant aftertaste and definitely improves as it warms. Medium bodied, a bit thick and chewy. Pretty drinkable. This is a solid brown ale. Not my favorite style, but one of the better ones I've had."

"I was interested by the layer of lees that sat in the bottom of the bottle, so when I Pop!ped the cap, my pour was rather light so as not to stir them up. There was nothing but wisps as a result, so I employed a bartender’s trick and stirred it up, creating just under two fingers of dense, dark-tan/light-brown head with good retention. Color was Dark Brown to Very Dark Brown (SRM = > 27, "

"Pours a black color. 1/3 inch head of an off-tan color. Decent retention and decent retention. Smells of strong sweet malt, slight hops, slight roasted malt, hint of oatmeal, hint of chocolate, hint of alcohol, and slight yeast. Fits the style of an English Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of strong sweet malt, roasted malt, slight hops, hint of chocolate, hint of oatmeal, and a hint of yeast. Overall, almost too sweet, but otherwise a decent blend, body, and aroma."

"It's not bad, but it's not really all that great either. It's solid enough in its own way, and pretty drinkable for its 7% ABV. It doesn't do anything particularly out of the ordinary, but it's certainly far from being uninteresting."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 3/19/2013. Pours moderately cloudy deep ruby brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, molasses, brown bread, brown sugar, nuttiness, light chocolate, light raisin, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown sugar, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, herbal, light raisin, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, light chocolate, and light raisin on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice brown ale. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O - Solid brown ale - Worth a shot."
""
""
"A flavorful brown ale. I pick up both American and English brown ale flavor profiles. A hearty breakfast beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This style is quite hit-or-miss, and thankfully this is a near-unqualified hit. It doesn't hit all of my buttons perfectly, but it *is* one of the better brown ales I've had so far."
""
"Boffo Brown pours a brown color with a small head. There is a licorice and shoe like aroma. The taste was a bit nutty, some toffee flavors, with licorice flavors. Flavors were a bit watery, and light. Overall its an easy to drink, brown ale that is light."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours brilliantly clear, dark mahogany brown. 1 inch creamy-off-white head forms and settles in at 1/2 inch. The nose is clean, sweet, toasty, and yeasty. Medium body with forward sweet malty notes. Hints of chocolate and char on the palate. Delicious smoky notes. Dark toast? Short with hints of hazelnuts and bitterness in the lingering Belgian lace is well developed although thin. The ABV is not noticeable on the palate. Moderate to low carbonation. I would re-purchase."
""
"O/D-Easily in contention for the prestigious ""Worst Label Ever"" ribbon. Looks like a coked-out Squidward from Spongebob. I digress, the beer was cool but Jesus, that label."
""
""
"The nose has a medium maltiness to it, some bread and a little sweetness, but there are also hints of wood and bourbon. This continues into the flavor but with more intensity. This beer is a wonderful, medium caramel, malty drink with huge bourbon and oak notes and a touch of vanilla. It is possibly the best brown ale I have ever had."

"Overall this is a tasty brown. It has some good subtle qualities that you won't find in the big corporate brands."
""
"Pours a deep, unclear brown color beneath a small, bubbly tan head. Creamy, nutty aromas upfront followed by malted milk, toasted grain, and berries. Lightly sweet chocolate and dark bread flavors and a bit of nutty roasted coffee as well. Some earthy hops join in and linger into the finish along with a dark fruitiness. Not as impressive as other malty Dark Horse beers, but this still manages to stand out from the pack."

"Overall, its a pretty good brown ale. The only complaint would be that none of the taste, such as the toffee or nutty upfront are gig enough. Seems like you get some nice small tastes then they fad quickly. I would pick this beer up again if it were in my area."
"O: Just a touch too strong to be sessionable but this is an easy drinking and enjoyable beer. I could see myself going to this one more regularly if it was more easily acquired (available across the river in NYC but not super easy to find)."
"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a dark brown coloring with chestnut highlights and a creamy, dense, low profile head that clings to everything. Aromas of cream and nut sweet, with a touch of roast. Flavors are heavily roasted, with a hazelnut sweetness and a bitter roast undertone. Bitterness helps to balance the brew. Smooth, creamy body with a light, sweet nut aftertaste. Slightly lingering, filmy finish, but pleasant."
"o: a top notch brown ale loaded with character and well balanced between nutty sweetness, dry roast, and earthy hops - carries an ethereal “bigness” that belies a relatively low abv"

"This is a malt-bomb...and I like it. This a simple beer in the sense that it doesn't offer layers of flavor, but what it does offer is really good. I'm not a huge brown ale fan, but this is one I could definitely drink."

"One of the better brown ales I've stumbled upon, but what else could someone expect from Dark Horse? A tasty brown ale. I'd love a head and some lacing on this beer, but you can't have it all. Would love to have this one again. Smooth, easy drinking, solid ABV, and most importantly -- tastes good."
""
"Overall - It must be because it follows the style of an English brown ale that I don't like this. It is the worst brown ale I've ever tried, but I'm used to mostly drinking American browns."
""
""
"This beer poured out as a deep brown color with some red highlights. The head is cream colored and thin just a bit of lacing on the glass and not much retention. The smell of the beer has some sweet malt aromas and hints of fresh wood. The smell is decent I just wishing it had a little more of something. The taste of the beer has a decent toasted flavor with a subtle coffee note. The mouthfeel is smooth, decent carbonation very drinkable. Overall it's a good brown ale."
"O - I'd have this again. Not a standout but yet another good beer made in Michigan."
""
""
""
""
"This is a very tasty brown ale. Not sure why BA lists it as an English brown though when the company lists it as an American brown ale."
"Besides the higher ABV, this is your traditional brown ale right here. It's fine, but not as interesting as I remembered."
""
"Mouthfeel is overly watery."
"O - Well done coffee roast taste without that roast bitterness. I'd get it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very roasty, nutty, bready, malty brew. Solid offering, perfect for cold winter weather.Not to style, but tasty!"
""
"Overall, an odd beer - some of the bottles tasted off in the mix pack i tasted from, but the brown was consistently sweeter, and lightly sour."
""
""
"O - Really good brown ale, very well balanced. I recommend it"
"Overall, this is a pretty good brown ale. Nothing to get excited about, but still a nice mild, yet complex and enjoyable, pour. I'm impressed by the finish, but I kind of wish it was a little sweeter up front to balance it out just a bit more."
""
"O - A good brown, especially if you like your browns on the dry side with some smoke and mild sweetness."
""
"This beer was a hazy brown/ dark amber color that I couldn't see through. The nose is mild and barely does the taste justice. There is a light amount of coffee, chocolate and roasted malts in this brown ale. It also has a lot of an earthy spice. There is a bunch of nutty flavors in this beer as well as quite a bit of toffee. The english aspect of this beer shines though in the yeast and I think the crisp yeast flavor compliments the flavors quite well. The mouth feel could be a bit heavier in my opinion but its still quite nice. This is a very nice brown ale, about on par with bells best brown."
""
"The complexities of the beer's alcohol makes me read boldness and better-ness, but the grain flavor and texture exposes it a bit and makes me think it's pushing a bit too hard. Despite the nitpick, the beer has won me over as one that straddles Avery's Ellie's Brown Ale and Dogfish Head India Brown Ale."
""

"In the bottle this has a deep sweet chocolate quality with some earth and some lively fine granulated sugar. A shame that that such a gorgeous beer to smell diliutesd so much once it hits the glass.. Still, it looks great in the glass being extremely dark brown with an easy effortless 2 inchg rocky tan head and rings of lacing with every sip. There is an interesting deep damp sweet taste here with some dry earth bittereness and a trace of the forementioned granulated sugar. Not at all heavily bodies but there is a siggestion of some weight there which brings something enveloping and dominant to the mouthfeel. Very interesting and thought provoking but funnily not a beer which really goes for pleasure."
"I tried this beer at the midwest brewfest. The beer poured a dark brown and a little murky with some reddish highlights. A thin tan collar formed during the pour -- the beer looked a little flat as it was filling the glass. A bit of spotty lacing. Malty aroma, big bread taste with brown sugar with some roast and caramel Fairly astringent, medium bodied with lowish carbonation. It was ok."
""
"What a nice brown ale. Really smooth and good character. The complexities don't stretch too far, but they do take a very nice ride. With all the stuff out on the market, brown ales seem to be taking the back seat as far as attention given through the brewing process. Hearty and deep and not thin at all. This is a really nice brown ale. Gotta give some love to Dark Horse."
""
"Overall a decent brown."
""
""
""
"O: This is a very good and very simple dark beer. It has a very few flavors, and those flavors blend together to create a very pleasant taste. It has a very good dark roasted malt flavor without much malt sweetness. And, the creaminess of the body is something that makes this beer standout from other dark beers."
"One of the better browns around."
"Notes: Very drinkable all the flavors are well balanced throught. Cheers."
"Dark raisin reddish brown in color and quite murky. Poured with a brief beige foam that quickly dissipated. Dark caramel malt, dark fruits and nutty aromas with hints of dark chocolate and coffee in the background. Thick, sticky, chewy feel with delayed, but rich carbonation that seems to pull the flavors forward. Dark caramel and roasted malt flavors up front that intensify into the middle. As the carbonation rolls through dark fruit, raisin and sweet fig flavors grow until a bitter hoppiness takes the taste buds for a turn down the stretch. Dark chocolate followed by dark roasted malt and coffee flavors with hint of nuts toward the end. Finishes with a dark roasted malt and dry pine hop bitter aftertaste. Very sweet smelling with roasty and bitter flavors. Great feel and flavor complexity. A fabulous brown ale."

"o - overall, not my favorite brown ale, but it brings a good amount of fruitiness that is really pleasant and different. i checked some of the other reviews and no one seems to be getting the fruitiness i noticed. wonder if i have a semi-infection going? this is a bit old, but damn if that fruitiness isn't a pleasant addition to the beer. really nice apple flavoring with the nuttiness and brown sugar you'd expect."
""
"Appearance is a dark brown with little head on it. Aroma has grains and malts. The taste contains nuts, malts, some hops, a bit sweet. Mouthfeel is low-medium with a clean aftertaste. This a rather simple brown ale, but a pretty good one from these folks out of Michigan."
""
"Wow this is one of the top browns I have had. I would love to have this next to Samuel Smith to see what is better. This one stands out for sure. Love the abv, the flavors and the mouthfeel here. Big time session ale here. A brown with lots happening. Great stuff."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very nice brown ale here. Great flavor, great drinkability."
""
"O-This is a decent rendition of an AMERICAN brown ale, meaning i get a pretty substantial amount of hops for an ""English brown ale."" Moderate vanilla, toast, booze, and earthy malt notes but mostly woody hops. Might be considered a Black Pale Ale? Not what i expected, and i was between a 3 and a 3.5 for overall, but the willingness to do something different in an increasingly stagnant category should be rewarded."

"Dark, chestnut brown with a pretty looking khaki cap of dense foam that settles quickly to a skim. Rich and malty, cocoa and roasty coffee like notes in the aroma. Nice flavors of fudge, cocoa powder and a roastiness bordering on porter territory. Full bodied for the style and creamy with a slightly chalky, bitter aftertaste. A really flavorful and well made Brown Ale."
""
""
"O~ A good brown ale overall, just a few things that I liked and didn't like. Good nose, lacing and others appearance traits, but it was pretty booze heavy for a brown ale. I typically think of Brown Ales as lighter on the alcohol and a little thicker bodied than this one was."
"O: While it has a bit more roasted character than is typical of English Brown ales, it is quite tasty. It is balanced well with the sweeter caramel malt flavors balancing out what I keep thinking is roasted barley, and that gives it a pleasant complexity that a lot of brown ales lack."
""
""
"Complex malt aromas, toast and caramel, nuts and grain husks. Slight sweetness at first, tempered by mild bitterness that lasts into the finish. Subtle dried fruit sneaks in and intertwines with nutty walnut notes. Dry and almost chalky aftertaste that lingers for a good while. Medium bodied and very smooth with a light carbonation level. Overall pretty enjoyable, a sleeper in the Dark Horse lineup."
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is primarily caramel malt, hints of toffee, finishes dry as expected for an English style, slightly slick, carbonation is soft with an above normal creaminess, nice roasted aspect with a bit of nuttiness."
""
"Overall (4): A pretty solid brown ale, but lacking some body and sweetness. I really like the malt notes, but it's just a bit too thin. Will have again, but won't seek it out."
""

"thick dark brown, almost black with a 1 inch caramel head, quickly fades, with some residual lace. Smell right off is chocolate, spice, and caramel. Taste is almost coffee like, very nice actually, with a good hoppy after taste. This was very smoothe, somewhat thick but not overally so at all. Its seems very drinkable and I was suprised"
""
""
"Many thanks to Kzoobrew for the chance to taste this one. Poured from bottle into DFH snifter glass. Pours a very dark brown opaque color, nice thick, chewy looking head recedes and a light tan ring remains and clings to the side of the glass. This looks like a great beer- barely any light gets through. Smell- nutty, toffee, faint brown sugar. Taste- warm, nutty, caramel, contrasted by a bitter roasted malt that hits the back of the throat. Maybe just a slight bit of astringency, but it works well with the balance. Carbonation is a little sharp, and makes it a little difficult to get all the flavors. Overall, I'm a fan. A nice beer from Dark Horse that I would have again."

"O: A very good brown ale. Good combination of flavors, nothing overpowering. Well balanced. A little thicker body and it would be a solid A- or even an A I think."
"excellent, creamy, but more importantly, an incredibly creamy, drinkable brown ale, my lord."
"Dark Horse is just another example of quality Michigan brewing. Kudos."
"Overall...I love a good brown ale and this is one of my favorites. Darkhorse hasn't let me down yet and I love what they do with maly forward beers."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a bold ruby shade showing up in the light. Half inch tan head and lace till the end are also present. The aroma is of hot chocolate, coffee, and light smoke. The flavor is complex with dark chocolate, mild coffee, and sweet roasted malt notes. Similar to a doppelbock with a hop tang. It's mouthfeel is medium. Dark Horse Boffo Brown Ale is a very good beer, well balanced, and quite drinkable. Highly recommended."
"O: A very different kind of brown ale, to me, anyway. I enjoyed it, though."
"Pours a very dark amber, small off white head. Aroma of caramel and earthy hops. In the taste, mellow, burnt caramel, toasted malt, even bitterness with tea like hops. Nutty, with light coffee flavor in the finish with some residual, chalky yeast. Medium bodied brew. Nice full, rich malty body. Hop presence is mild. A very nice brown ale overall, quite impressive."
"Overall, it's all right. I'm happy to finish the glass, but I won't go out of my way to drink this again."
"O- As the beer warmed it got better. When I first opened this and took a drink, it screamed infection. Though it wasnt infected, it did have intense flaws that unfortunately overtook the majority of the drinking experience."
"Brown body with a thin layer of tan head. Nose is nutty bread and some unsweetened chocolate. Flavor is a mix of roasted malts and a sharp caramel sweetness. There is a sharp roasted bitterness on the finish that is metallic and has a hint of floral hops. Beer has a light body and overall the flavor was alright but the finish was off."
"Overall: The aroma and taste was pretty solid. I'll have to give this one another try."
"Overall, this is an excellent brown ale, replete with finely nuanced and well-crafted flavors that burst delightfully on the tongue."
"O- One of the better Brown Ales I've had. If this is your style I'd say pick this one up for sure."
"D - I've been very impressed with a lot of Dark Horse's offerings, and this one certainly did not let me down. A relatively low ABV, yet packed with bold flavor. I would recommend this to my craft beer drinking friends any day of the week."
"O - This beer is pretty boring, but it's non-offensive, something you can pretty much drink and not notice. Not going to try to find this again."
"Nothing that will excite the tastebuds, but pleasant and well balanced for the style."
"Dark brown and a little murky with some reddish highlights. A thin tan collar formed during the pour -- the beer looked a little flat as it was filling the glass. A bit of spotty lacing. Malty aroma, bread and brown sugar with some roast, caramel and a hint of dark chocolate. Leafy bitterness with sweet malts up front, caramel and bread, dry roastiness in the finish, nutty. Fairly astringent, medium bodied with lowish carbonation. I enjoyed it, but the 6.5% abv is a little high and keeps it from being a good session beer for me, which is how I tend to like my brown ales."
"Overall ehh I pretty much had this since I had most of Dark Horses other offerings and it's clear that its a well made brown ale but something I wouldn't get again. Will stick with their stouts since I love em."
"Overall I found this to be a great brown ale. It has the classic brown ale taste and is well balanced with a very nice texture. This is very drinkable and would make a good beer to have with friends while chatting about old times."
"Overall-First few sips weren't all that bad, but started tasting pretty awful. Look and Taste is pretty unimpressive. I'll pass on this for now on."
"Brown ale is a style I approach with hesitancy because there are so many terrible brown ales on the market today: mostly watery, bitter pale ales with brown coloring. Fortunately, this beer comes across with some muscle but not so much that it terrifies the children or causes old women to pass out on the sidewalk. The aroma and taste both approach UK-stout territory: quite fruity with an emphasis on oranges, yet with a dry finish; plenty of charcoal and roasted whatever-it-is provide enough complexity without much intellectual hooey. A fine accompaniment to a big plate of pancakes."
"The beer is very creamy and very smooth. This is a medium to full bodied beer. The taste has all the great characteristics for the style, but there is a hoppy bite in the finish that may be warranted, perhaps no. I'm just really enjoying the creamy, roasted notes, and the bittering cooking chocolates, and then bam, this really leafy bittering hop and drying punch hits you in the finish. It's okay, but I'm marking it down as a flaw in the beer, although some folks may like it. The punch lasts well into the finish and is just more than i wanted. The beer is quite good, I just wish the finish were lest impactful."
"O. Not a bad drink, but nothing great either. This is probably my least favorite Dark Horse Beer. While Dark Horse is one of my favorite breweries, I think I'll stick with Bell's Best Brown Ale, or Michigan BC's Nut Brown Ale when it comes to drinking an English Brown Ale."
"NICE BEER, WORTH TRYING!"
"Boffo indeed."
"Overall: This is a very underwhelming beer for me. I thought it was a bit watery. Not my favorite from this brewery."
"Overall this was a pretty good brown ale that I enjoyed drinking. It had just about everything I look for in a brown ale and its one of the better ones I have tried. It had a heavier roast then most brown ales but I thought it worked well in this brew and I liked it. It went down smooth, if I had another one I would drink it, I would for sure buy this again. I recommend this to anyone who likes this style, Dark Horse has one solid brown ale on their hands."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a thin cap of lacing. The aroma is of lots of caramel, some toffee, and a hint of chocolate. The taste is similar to the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is a good beer that I would happily drink again."
"Overall a decent brown ale. easy drinking, nothing aggressive or out of place."
"Overall: This is a very smooth Brown Ale that seems a little more heavily roasted than typical for the style. Quite delicious and one of the better English Brown Ales I have had."
"Drinkability was pretty good. Nice smelling and tasting pretty good, but the bubbly quality takes it down a hair. Still, its a mighty fine brown."
"Pours coffee brown with everlasting off white head. Brown sugar with some brownies in the aroma. Brownies, brown sugar, spice, gingerbread, and tang towards the finish.  Heavy body with medium carbonation. Mild in flavors, not so aggressive but a good representation of the style."
"Had this on-draft $3 a pint night. The beer is a beautiful chocolate brown with a light head. Tones of nut and coal. Clean and crisp flavor of coffee, nut and coal. No after taste. Goes down nice and easy. My brother Sisupride would love this beer. My first brew I have had from Dark Horse Brewing Co. and they did great. Michigan is truly a great place for hand crafted beers."
"On tap last night at Canary Sq in JP. Served in a standard pint glass. Dark brown color, with a thin white head. Some lacing. Smell had a nice nutty coffee aroma to it. Flavor was very tasty. A hint of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and just a bit of toffee were blended in there nicely. Mouthfeel was decent - not thick but not watery. I thought this was an easy beer to drink at 6.5%. A well made brown ale that I'd have again."
"Overall, drinkability is good. This is a nice brown ale, but doesn't really stand out."
"Delicious. One of my favorite Browns."
"Pours a very dark brown with a quick diminishing head. Scents of sweet cocoa with some coffee hints. Very robust malts that again have the taste of cocoa and coffee. Very flavorful as it basically a step below the bold taste of a stout. If you're into dark and heavy beers, thois is a must try!"
"On tap at ChurchKey in Washington, DC. Poured into snifter glass. Served in near room temperature which is the norm at ChurchKey. Pours a soft brown color with a small off white head that quickly fizzles but retains thin lacing throughout the drinking session. Aroma is sweet and malty, bready with plenty of chocolate malt and a nice toasted grain note. Flavor is sweeter with an even bigger chocolate character, a bit of a burnt roasted note, but mostly sweet with caramel and toffee and a subtle but present earthy hop balance in the finish Medium body and a bit of a sharper carbonation. Pretty good English brown ale IMO."
"Certainly a great brown ale to have on tap."
"4.0 D: Pretty good beer. Lots of what I like in a brown ale. This would be a hell of a beer if it was a bit sweeter and creamier."
"Dark Horse Boffo Brown Ale pours a finger of beige foam over a very dark brown brew. The nose is really inviting- semi-sweet chocolate with a little tangy note of mollasses. Up front the flavor mirrors the nose- bakers chocolate, that note of mollasses, with a little touch of espresso bitterness off the back for balance. The mouthfeel is round but crisp, drying just a little, with a mellow herbal hop in the aftertaste. Brown ales tend to get overlooked- everybody's running after their IPAs, Belgians, or the newest/weirdest barrel-aged concoction. People tend to forget how good a Brown Ale can be- packing a lot of flavor in what is still a pretty modest, easy drinking beer- just like this one."
"M/D: On the lighter side with moderate carbonation, and slightly creamy. Overall, its ok, have had better, but an interesting mix of flavors."
"Dark Horse does not dissapoint."
"The Dark Horse website tells me this is actually 6.5%, which is fine, but as a session beer lover, I wish this brown were a tough lighter and less alcoholic. Not that I'm complaining, that's just personal preference. This is a mighty fine brown ale."
"Drinkability: An average English brown. I could have a couple but there are several others in the style I would have first. Not a bad beer, but not overly memorable either."
"D-A really pleasant, sessionable drinker."
"Overall - A pretty standard but good brown ale... worth a try..."
"D - Pretty drinkable, but your typical Brown Ale. Very smoky and roasty for a brown ale, but i like it. Would definitely drink it again."
"D: Not your typical malty/sweet brown ale. Welcome levels of roast, smoke, and bitterness. Classy."
"drinkability is solid - very good flavors low abv great mouthfeel"
"D: Good overall, but I probably won't be stocking up on it."
"This is a really solid all around brown and another winner from Dark Horse. Lots of flavor and easy to drink as well. I could tip back a couple of these with ease."
"Pours a nice brown color that is slightly opaque. Off white head with a pretty good amount of retention and some nice lacing. The nose brings sweet malt, caramel, toffee, a bit of fruit, and some nice earthy hops. The taste is a good blend of hops and malt, with the combination really shining through in the mouthfeel. Drinkability is quite good and it was a nice brew on my first trip (finally!) to the brewery."
"This beer pours with a lot of head on it, too much if you ask me, but the nice taupe head caps off a beautiful deep dark brown color that has faint ruby twinges when closely examined. The smell is coffee-like in nature, but with a blend of toffee mixed in as well as some cocoa powder. The flavor of the cocoa powder is strongest on the palate, but there is some molasses character coming through as well. There might be a hint of toffee. All of the flavors are really mellow in this beer nothing is potent or overwhelming, which also means that there isn't any distinct character as well. The cocoa flavor on the mouthfeel actually almost dried out the tongue, but the smoothness of the beer actually made it still a good drinking beer. This is a very good brown ale and something I would definitely look for again on tap."
"Overall- Would be a great food beer! This is a delightful brown ale, big and chewy with a great supporting hop bitterness. Great drinkability for a darker, heavier beer. I will say though, the first few bottles were a bit flat. If you buy it fresh, give them a few weeks in the bottle and they carb up nicely!"
"The artwork on the bottle is unsettling and inexplicable. What does it mean??"
"This brown ale pours very dark brown to mostly black. Its aroma is dark roasted malt, hints of coffee and mocha, with an apparent sweetness. Its taste follows its aroma directly. There is an almost cloying sweetness at the beginning but it fades into a nicely bitter coffee and dark chocolate finish."
"Taste: Roasted malts, dark fruit. More bitterness than you normally find in a brown ale. This beer kinda walks the line between brown ale and porter in my opinion. Another outstanding brew from the guys at Dark Horse."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch tan head. Head retention is excellent, but there isn't much lacing at all. Aroma is toasted and bready malt, nuts, toffee and caramel. Taste is pretty much like the aroma, and there's the addition of a bit of chocolate. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and creamy with good carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. I thought it was a good overall brown ale, now I'm sorry I just bought a single bottle of this. I'd definitely buy this again."
"Well done."
"Notes: very elegant brown ale. has a lager-like crispness and drinkability to it. awesome brown ale"
"This is one that becomes more enjoyable as you drink. Boffo falls right behind Best Brown and Bender as my third favorite brown ale. Very solid beer all the way are and easy to drink. A lot of flavor is packed into a relatively smaller beer. I don't drink brown ales too often but if I did this one would be a staple."
"Beautiful deep chestnut in color poured into my new DFH pint glass, with a thin, foamy tan head. The aroma is sweet caramel and chocolate with a touch of nuttiness, and a hint of hops. Flavor is malty with tones of caramel, Cocoa and molasses and just a hint of dark fruit. A nice Brown Ale. Creamy and smooth. light bodied for an American Brown. But one I would get again."
"Drinkability: No problem whatsoever. Glad I bought a six-pack."
"this brown pours a very dark brown color with a beige/black cherry head almost a stout like appearance,tons of sticky.clinging lace....smell is toffee ,burnt sweet caramel .baked bread and hops..taste is simply delicious ..its toffee,followed by burnt caramel and baked bread..then you get some roasted coffee notes with great hops and grapefruit notes..mouth feel is robust and full this is one tasty brown that drinks like a light stout/porter..its excellent so tasty..very recommended"
"D: Goes down ok, not much of a kick, ok representation of style. There was something slightly off with the blending of flavoring in this beer. There are better offerings out there of the style."
"D- This beer was a good above average try from Dark Horse. I really enjoyed it but wouldn't want to drink a sixer of it. The ABV is low enough to drink a lot of this but the style is really not for me."
"D: Meh. Its average at best. Not doing much for me, its not bad at all, its just.... average."
"D- A very unique brown ale. The more I get into it, the better it gets. I will be getting this again."
"D: Good, complex flavor, nothing overwhelming, but it feels like something's missing. It's very fruity and sweet, but it almost feels too sweet. Some stronger hop presence, or maybe a big dose of coffee might make this a superb beer. Just thoughts."
"D: A good beer that really fell apart just before the finish for me. Feel is great though and nose complements the flavor very well. Worth a try for a twist on the brown ale style."
"It's fairly drinkable, pretty light and sessionable, but that touch of briny salt at the end knocks down a bit of the drinkability."
"The flavor has far more hop presence than the smell indicates. Well-balanced with a dry, cocoa malt taste. Thin bodied and highly carbonated, the mouthfeel is the weakest aspect of this beer."
"I'd also note....a few reviews called it too sweet. Try it a bit colder. I prefer it a bit on the chill side and I think that's it's best balance. Dark Horse malts up their stouts,so you can ""fine tune"" to taste by having them a bit colder,or warmer."
"Bell's Best Brown is still the best brown ale in Michigan, but this Dark Horse brew is good beer in its own right. Whether or not you think Boffo is boffo will most likely depend on how much you like brown ales. Grab a single or a sixer and judge for yourself."
" D- Nice roasted flavor with some subtle hops support. There is not much depth but this beer is very quaftable. Not as heavy as a porter and it would be nice to see this on cask."
"Mouthfeel is nice. Medium bodied and nice carbonation. Overall, this is a good brown ale. I enjoyed it and would happily drink it again."
"The beer pours a nice brown color with a thin off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has an excellent mix of toasted caramel malts, victory nuttiness, and a dry roasted finish. The taste is decent. It has a dry, roasted flavor with a subtle caramel feel. It goes down quick and bone dry with a bit of bitterness in the finish. I'm not sure what's causing that. The mouthfeel is fine. It a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average brown ale, but nothing exceptional."
"Drinkability: A very nice English Brown that verges on porter territory"
"This is terrific and leans on the side of porter in my book. Really a pleasure to drink and I'll need to seek this out again."
"Nice and roasted, but lacks some sensation. Worth sessioning, but not exceptional."
"D - great flavors but smooth and easy to drink"
"D: Good, pretty tasty little brew."
"Toasted, nutty malts up front. Brown sugary sweetness and caramel follow. Earthy, woody, mild bitterness lurks in the background. Dash of maple syrup, a bit of chocolate milk, some toasted walnuts. Delicious! Medium-bodied with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. A nice session brown, on the sweeter side."
"goes down fine. nothing exciting, but nothing repulsive. fits the style well."
"I've enjoyed most of the regular Dark Horse offerings and this is no exception. Pours a cola brown, nearly opaque color with a thin light brown head that quickly fades to a thin cap with splotchy thin film and minimal lacing. Aroma is rich and sweet, heavy on malts and nuttiness. Thick and smooth body with a sweet nutty and milk chocolate finish. Flavor is molasses, caramel, sugar, roasted malt, light hops; in general very robust and pleasant for the style. Nothing too exceptional, but a very flavorful, enjoyable brown."
"A recent trip to Columbus proved the fact that Dark Horse is in full effect in the state of Ohio. I saw shot gun tap handles in every fine beer bar we stopped at. This one appeared locally, so I had to go with it and a couple bottles of Double Crooked Tree. Appears a deep cola brown with large tan head forming nicely. Speckled scattered lacing is left behind. Aroma is full of nutty dark chocolate and creamed coffee tones, very nice dessert feel to it. Creamy sweet upfront with some hazelnut/almond tones with background herbal hops kicking and a bit of dry bready yeast notes. Dark chocolate creamed coffee and ripe fruit collide to make some damn good brown ale. Body is a bit weired medium bodied lightly carbonated goes down easy but with a full on flavor ride. Drinkable as all hell, one of the most approachable brown ales I've come across in quite some time, this is some tasty stuff."
"Strong aroma has overtone of burnt brown sugar and a hint of caramel. Pours an opaque dark-chocolate brown with a thick, creamy fine-bubbled pale tan head. Lip-smacking flavor is malty with tones of caramel and molasses and just a hint of fruit. Texture is pleasingly smooth with a nice subtle tingle. Worth hunting down!"
"First flavor to come out is that of sweet (but not overtly sugary) cream. The mouthfeel of the brew also has a light cream to it as well now that I'm mentioning it. Right behind it is caramel malts, brown sugar and a bit of nuttiness. The finish has something of a porter taste to it with a slight touch of bitters and baker's chocolate."
"D_Great session brown ale. Nicely done."
"D- easy enough to finish, but this isnt the best example of the style ive had. im still glad they decided to bottle this."
"D - This is a really good brown ale and a nice surprise from Dark Horse. Definitely give this one a try."
"D-lots of nutty flavors going on, not a bad brown ale and has a good malt body with a solid feel to it. overall pretty decent."
"This is quite a drinkable brown ale and easily sessionable."
"Notes: Gotta love Dark Horse!"
"Overall, a nice drinkable brown from the boys at Dark Horse."
"Overall, a good beer that's worth a try."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is light but not watery. This is a very easy to drink comfort beer."
"D: The beer is relatively easy to drink and has a nice flavor, which could definitely make this sessionable."
"Good for style, even a bit porterish, enjoyed at the brewery. Dark brown,chocolate malty sweetish, a tad toasty, with a nice hoppy bitterness in the finish. Malty aroma and a tad above average mouthfeel from caramel. ANother god drinkable Dark Horse."
"D - This is a pretty solid brown ale - nothing that absolutely blew me away, but at the same time I really enjoyed it. Due to the excellent selections on-tap at Kelleher's I had to move on after one..."
"Conclusion: NICE...English...brown"
"Not bad; not great, but not bad. Served with a nice light tan medium sized head and some lace. Color is a very dark & hazy brown. Aroma is a rich brown with the barest hint of hop. Nice and malty. Flavor's pretty good too. Quintessential British Brown with a slight suggestion of fruit. Good stuff. Good body and carbonation. Good finish too. Full and satisfying. Session beer."
"D: Very very good brown ale. I could session this no problem."
"D- It's a really easy drinker. I could see having a bunch in a sitting."
"On tap at dark horse brewpub. Pours reddish brown and clear with a ring of a white head. light malt odor. some noble hop in the nose and not too aggressive. mmmm...a nice tasting brown. sweet malts, caramelly. some light fruitiness. very nice. a full beer too and satisfyingly so. fills me up. easy to drink."
"A very hazy brown beer with a small white-ish head. Good lacing. Nose is earthy but sweet malts. In fact, quite a bit of sweetness from the malts. Taste is malts up front, soem nuttiness, and fades into a slightly hoppy finish. Not bad at all. Mouthfeel is good, it's a little foamy. Drinkability is good. A solid brew form Dark Horse."
"from the bottle. poured a dark brown with mahogany hues with a small tan headthat left some traces down the side of the glass. aroma roasted nuts, cherries that are almost ripe (still has some sourness mixed with the sweetness) caramel, bittersweet chocolate, plums,as it warms the choclate started to lean more to sweet side, malt. flavor had my mouth all set from some good tasteing beer but this let me down big time tasted watered downabout the only thing I got out of it was a touch of cherries and chocolate. since this doesnt have a date on the bottle anyplace I dont know how old this is"
"Mouth takes a hit from the pungent acidity but otherwise pretty drinkable."
"This beer poured a very dark brown, almost black color and formed an off white head that slowly faded. The aroma was of malt, coffee and caramel. The flavor was of malt, with a elements of both the coffee and the caramel. The body was rather light for the style and the finish a touch bittersweet. Not a bad brown, but not great either."
"This is an easy drinking pleasant tasting brown."
"A cloudy dark brown out of the bottle. Head was minimal, as was the lacing. Neither one stuck around very long. Smell was of faint coffee and nut, (roasted malts) and a slight touch of sugary sweetness. Taste was of roasted coffee, spice and malt sweetness. Low bitterness i thought. Very drinkable. Carbonation was mild. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and went down very smooth. Very nice brown ale, less nuttier than others ive had but very nice."
"Another solid brew from the Dark Horse dudes. Most everybody else would call this a porter. Rich and filling. Recommended."
"Thanks to trbeer for the herd of Dark Horse bottles!"
"Original Review: 3/6/03 - 2.5/5.0 Poured out to a muddied brown in the glass with virturally no head. Aroma is that of light malt. Taste was disappointing. This was a very thin brown ale with nearly no carbonation. I am thinking it might've been a bad bottle. Not as complex as Newcastle even, which is very thin in its own right. I will have to resample this one, but overall, it was disappointing."
"This beer poured very dark, darker than most brown ales pour and was quite low in carbonation. The smell was semi-sweet but that was about it. The taste was simply an upfront maltiness with nothing to back it up. I can't find any hops or alcohol or yeast or ANYTHING other than a caramel flavored malt. Too thin, too bland. This should be a macro."
