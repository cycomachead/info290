3.8,5.8,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,4,"I wasn't particularly fond of the way that Long Trail used American hops in their Hibernator Scottish-style ale because they just don't quite fit. I didn't find that they worked within the overall balance of the beer. Inappropriate hops, however, are not the case here. They've used Northern Brewer and they work out just fine, regardless of where they were actually grown (I'm assuming Pacific northwest). Northern Brewer hops are, in fact, fairly traditional for an English-style brown ale. In this case they add a bit of leafiness, mint-iness, and subtle grassiness at a level that's just strong enough to stand out from the nutty, chocolatey, and lightly caramel-ish maltiness. One valid question might then be, ""have they used too much hop flavor as the style really calls for the malt to dominate, followed by the yeast character as the second feature?", and I think the answer is yes. However, this IS an American beer, not an English beer; and I feel that simply mimicking another beer or style really serves no purpose. If I wanted a true English brown ale I could buy one, and therefore this beer is unique. It remains ""English"" in nature but with a twist. As long as it works, and I think it does, then we should just let style go. With that said, hedonistically, I think it's quite a nice beer, and it's quite enjoyable. It's well-made with a good appearance and a nice balance. Additionally, it's fairly accessible and fits in with a wide variety of situations despite its darker appearance. Worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Jun 25, 2013"

I got a massive two-plus fingers of thick, deep-tan head almost instantly, requiring that I back off of the pour. It all finally settled into mere wisps, but I do not fault the brewers, and instead the broiling temperatures. Color was a deep reddish-brown with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a nuttiness to it, not a bad thing in a brown ale. Mouthfeel was medium and man, was this a nutty flavor on the tongue! Squirrels would die for something like this. As a self-avowed hophead, not so much. Still, it was appropriate for the style and it sure beat drinking a sugary malt bomb. Finish was semi-dry and while I may not want more than one, it was certainly not a bad beer.","woodychandler","Jul 17, 2012"

For example, I believe it is the exact same beer as the Church Street Tavern Ale Leunig's Ale et. al only under different names. The color of the beer was a classic copper with one finger of off-white head. The aroma was very light, toasted malt and only hints of hops. The flavors were very nutty, toasted malt, a little caramel malt and a touch of floral hops. Clearly very low in alcohol. Dry and slightly bitter at the end.

Slightly thin in my mouth, but coated my tongue nicely as the flavors stayed for some time. In terms of drinkability, I might be a bit bias as I happen to really enjoy Brown Ales (American & English) and find them to be among the most drinkable beers around.

But it's not my preference when it comes to brown ales in general--I want more nutty, more complex chocolate, more of a transition of flavors (see my Ithaca Cascazilla review), and it needs just a little work on aftertaste and multidimensional flavor.

The head is a little shallow and unremarkable, but the appearance of the liquid is truly enticing. The smell of this beer grows on you as you work though the glassÂ…toasted malt and grains come out in waves. ThereÂ’s just a little hops, and a nut and bread-crust character thatÂ’s terrific. Caramel as well. ItÂ’s a fairly dry beer, with a nice balancing bitterness. ThereÂ’s bit of metallic taste. The body is a little light, borderline watery.

Aroma is some slight floral hops, along with some nutty and chocolatey flavors. Taste is nutty and malty and roasted. Finish is off-dry with some undefined bitterness. Mouthfeel is rather thin. Goes down easy, but a pretty unexceptional brew. Not to say that it is bad, but this is not my first choice among Long Trail's offerings.","ColForbin","Dec 18, 2005"

The color is a dark amber as duly noted already. The smell of rich malt is present over the ale. In the flavor this maltiness opens up into a hugely complex taste. There aren't any apparent esters, so the malts and wheat in the flavor taste like what they are. Hit the Trail has a thin bodied mouthfeel. It's perfect for an early spring session.. but it would be acceptable in any season.","MrSeth","Apr 18, 2005"

The aroma is sweet with malt and touches of brown sugar. To be honest, the aroma is the worst part of this beer, because I love the taste. This seems to be a theme for me with Long Trail beers, I wonder why? The first thing I taste is brown sugar. This firms up into a beautiful malt backbone that has definite caramel highlights. The aftertaste hits almost as hard as the beer itself with the same malt composition. Even though all the tastes I've described are ""sweet"" smells, the beer itself isn't very sweet at all. This is a great attribute, sweet beers tend to be off-putting to me. The tastes are there without the cloying sweetness. This beer really surprised me in a good way. I wasn't expecting much, but this is a really great session ale that goes down easily and is never offensive.","Hagbard","Jan 20, 2005"

Not sure what the difference would be except maybe the hop profile.","Citadel82","Oct 30, 2004"
3.28,-8.6,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Clear, ruby-brown in hue with a bronzy highlight, what a beautiful color. The head developed poorly, at the apex it was a half finger in height but quickly dissipated to a thin cap. After a few moments the cap faded to a collar. There was no subsequent lacing. The nose has its charm, it does lack in potency a bit thus I canÂ’t completely grasp the aromas. I do detect some toasty, caramel malts. I absolutely adore this in Brown Ales. But I do not welcome the buttery, butterscotch notes. Strange sweet, flowery, fruity notes too. Airy finish. The bouquet is fair, not inviting but not off-putting. IÂ’m curious to take a sip even though I hardly know what to expect. I like my Brown Ales to taste like small porters. This one does not. So I will judge it accordingly. There is a wide butterscotch flavor that muddles the palate, IMO. This forces the toasty, caramel flavors to the background. Some sweetness is found at the back, towards the finish before a charred taste emerges. This odd combination lingers into the aftertaste. I can tolerate it but I donÂ’t love it. Weak hop bitterness; any true flavors contributed are not discernible. Overall, the palate is good enough but it needs to be paired with some grilled foods or at least some sharp cheddar cheese. Medium/medium-light in body, low carbonation but the mouthfeel is still pleasant. I like this beer. It is okay. But one 12-ounce bottle was enough for me.

I've had this beer a couple times, and it seems a bit different with each bottle. Retrying it, the diacetyl is less pronounced, with stronger hop flavor and graininess. In keeping with Long Trail's rough hewn sort of flavor, but with perhaps a little more complexity to keep you interested. A bit muddy, with an indistinct style, as is the case with most of Long Trail's beers. I just reviewed it for what it was, not following any sort of style guideline.","UnionMade","Aug 24, 2004"
