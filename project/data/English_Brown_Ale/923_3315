Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, roasted nut, and slight char aromas. Taste is much the same with char and roasted nut flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a nice aroma, but the flavors are a bit bland and watery in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Jul 05, 2014"

The nose ends on a sweet almond like nutty note. Light roasted grains dominate the taste but are balanced out nicely by bitter hop characters and a sort of sourness in the middle. Once again the taste finishes nutty. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Smooth and with fine carbonation. A fairly average brown ale. Its got just enough complexity to keep you interested. If I could find this in singles in my area I could see purchasing a couple now and then. Although I would never drop the cash for a six pack. Worth a try.","depechemode1983","Mar 29, 2012"

Mouthfeel is syrupy and very little carbonation. Very disappointed in this beer so far. I will have to give it a second chance though, reading a lot of these comments suggest something wasn't right for me here Maybe a wrong time, wrong place situation, maybe an old bottle that sat on the rack for too long, who know...","denver10","Jan 13, 2012"

The aroma is rich; full of caramel, toasted walnuts and hazelnuts, and hints of both bread and chocolate. On the first sip you know you'll be wanting more than one pint of this brew. This is definitely a nutty brown ale with tastes of both chocolate and coffee with hints of pumpernickel bread. Hints of hops come through on the flavor, but don't linger long enough to be distinguishable. This beer is very carbonated and that masks the flavor slightly, but thankfully the flavors continue to develop and grow stronger as you drink it. A nutty aroma lingers with you after each sip and leaves you wanting more.","jmvecchio1","Jun 14, 2011"

Flavor was a typical brown without the sweetness common to the style. This emphasized the hop bitterness and the dark malt, and was responsible for the lighter mouthfeel that other reviewers noted.
