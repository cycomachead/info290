Mouth feel is thin and moderate carbonation. Overall an above average brown ale. Enjoyable.","TBCE","Mar 28, 2015"

4.06,10.9,4,4.25,4,4,4,"I haven't experienced many brown ales other than Newcastle Brown Ale. I found this one to be very different. Deep brown in the glass with sweet nutty and malty aromas. Taste was mostly dominated by sweetness with malt flavours but otherwise a little bit thin. Mouthfeel fine with good carbonation. Overall a good beer but I don't have many reference brown ales to compare it to. I'd drink it again but probably won't remember it in a month. I think that sums it up for me.","Decko","Mar 16, 2015"

The nose comprises watered-down molasses, very light roasted malts, dusty biscuits, and cocoa powder. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light candi sugar and plenty of balsa. The added sweetness helps, but not too much. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel.

3.92,7.1,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is a nutty brown coloring that is semi-translucent when held up to the light. Moderate amount of bubble action in the glass, so the carbonation appears to be up. The beer started with a short-stack head, but that beat feet before I could even sit down with the beer. The nose is caramel and nut sweetness, but not overpowering. Some earthy sweet as it sits for a bit, too. In mouth, the beer is a nice, light balance for the flavors the brew showcases. The beer is toffee and nutty sweetness, almost like eating a Rolo. Very flavorful, and does a decent job of not being overpowering with all the sweet characteristics. The body takes on a creamy texture as it warms, while still remaining light in mouth. The aftertaste is all nut, almost like a little Nutella, only liquid form. The finish is fairly smooth, and leaves no overbearing trace of the flavors. Decent beer. I could see this pairing up with just about anything, but especially spicy foods where the sweetness can really take over and help sooth your tastebuds. Easy to down, too, if your in that kind of mood.","GarthDanielson","Mar 06, 2011"

It smells like brown bread with raisins. But the hops become more aggressive in the taste and the floral becomes more spicy a la allspice or clove, but remain in balance with the hops. Despite all the hops they don't dominate the aftertaste and the beer finishes dry and clean.

I get some great nutty flavor with light hints of chocolate and delicious malts. There are very little hops present, but the brown sugar makes up for it. Great tasting session brown ale.

The brown was my first offering from this brewery. Poured to a clear medium brown color, some reddish highlights. Had a somewhat small light tan head that had good retention though the lacing was minimal. The aroma was of roasted malts and a nice nutty scent also there seems to be a slight coffee and chocolate presence but they are in the background. Some hops seem to be there but for me they where not clearly definable. The flavor was similar to the nose; roast and crystal toffee/caramel flavors give it a nice drinkable flavor with a slight coffee roast that tries to peak through. The hops that are there give a nice finish at the end but I wish they where a little more pronounced. Now, I am not sure if it is the beer itself or possibly the age where the hops could have fallen out over time. Over all this was a pleasant brew but nothing there really grabbed my attention where I would look for this one again. To many other Brown Ales that hit my mark.","Stimack","Feb 13, 2010"

It has a slight hit of chocolatey bitterness when it first strikes the tongue. It's a very dark brown with a slight transparency that reflects a deep crimson.

I put it a notch below Lost Coast's Winterbraun due to milder taste and a notch below Big Sky's Moose Drool for not being quite as balanced or sessionable.

Soft and fruity melon aromas at first, with a fainter spicy nuttiness creeping in around the back. Whiffs of kiwi, too, I think. Could use a little more oomph in the nose. Definitely in the English tradition of brown ales, Lost Coast Downtown Brown features mildly spicy and earthy hop flavors supported by a variety of fresh fruit notes (tart apple, melon, green plum) and a soft, biscuit-like malt structure. If it were darker in color, I'd think this would easily ride the line between brown and mild ale -- two styles with many family resemblances to begin with, I know. Demure zestiness in the mouthfeel, light-bodied but peppery enough to provide a substantive quaff. Accordingly drinkable. Am I crazy, or is this one of the only brown ales available in 22-ounce bottles? There should be more, since it's such a sessionable style.

Mouth feel is surprisingly full and creamy, with a cling to the tongue feel and light carbonation.

After that though that almost fake berry fruit note starts to grip the flavor profile. Really quite interesting, if I had this beer blind I would swear to you that they added fruit extracts to this beer. The fruitiness has that same one dimensional, too intense fruit character to it that fruit extracts generally have. This is quite light on the palate, and if not for the uncharacteristic fruitiness would be quite quaffable. As it is though, it is a little too much, the fake berry fruit notes just is too much to make this really enjoyable. It is not bad, just unexpected.","Gueuzedude","Oct 02, 2006"

3.63,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This is a fine brown ale that pours a luscious burnt umber with ruby highlights and also a healthy tan head. Smell is all roasted nuts and hops. The taste is tremendous and spot on for the style. The flavor of a dozen kinds of nuts dominates, but a smooth caramel toastiness takes over toward the end in tandem with a sharp hoppy bite. Mouthfeel is bready and wholesome and drinkability is tops. Hoist one of these and you shan't be disappointed.","MobBarley","Mar 04, 2004"

2.77,-24.3,2.5,3,2.5,3,3,"This one surprised me a little. Both the color and taste seemed more like a porter to me than a brown ale. I have never had a brown ale taste like this or pour so dark. It was very nice tasting, but it was odd because of the style confussion in my head. This is a good beer, but maybe a little too much for a brown.","ALESwhatCURESya","Jan 27, 2004"
3.77,3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Rich chocolate aroma, maybe a little coffee in there as well. Oatmeal cream colored head that didn't last long. Dark cola brown colored beer that lets just a little light through. The flavor is a nice balance between smooth maltiness and chocolate, with a little hop bite to balance the sweetness. The body is middle of the road and the mouthfeel is clean and smooth. A nice beer, easy drinking.","HappyHourHero","Jan 16, 2004"
4.1,12,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I've never been a real fan of red and brown ales, but Downtown Brown is one that I've enjoyed for years. It's a nice change from the pale ales and IPA's that I normally enjoy. This one has a smooth blend of malt with a sweetness that is not at all overbearing. I sometimes am reminded of a Newcastle Ale, except this one goes down much better, has more character and is much more agreeable to the palate. The local watering hole in town finally has it on tap. Had one while enjoying the Purdue-Georgia bowl game and a submarine sandwich on New Year's Day. Lost Coast has some other tasty brews that I enjoy, such as 8 Ball Stout. It's a great brewery.","ChappyCubsFan","Jan 02, 2004"

4.05,10.7,4,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a deep amber brown hue with a full thicket of tan lacing just beautiful appearance, lacing is speckled and spread out with no pattern to it. Aromatics is key in this beer, undertone of floral hop presence and mild chocolate tones from the dark roasts used here and a very mild coffee tone to it. Tastes vary between milky chocolate notes and finishing hops adding a balancing bitterness the dark roasted malts add a great tone of bitternesss to the overall flavor pretty damn good brown. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied brown with a smooth fluffy texture, can't beat it. Drinkability: Really nice to sip on if your into brown's the only other one I've tasted that compares to this is Avery's Ellie Brown Dog Ale very tasty.","WVbeergeek","Nov 05, 2003"
3.83,4.6,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall, this was a pleasing brew. I liked the unexpected addition of smokiness to the flavors of malts and nuts manning the ramparts. The hops bite made this a well balanced beer that made me think I was given the wrong beer at first. Worth trying if you see it. Downtown Brown has sparked my interest in the rest of Lost Coast BreweryÂ’s line-up.","Boilermaker88","Oct 28, 2003"

4.3,17.5,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This was a supprising Brown ale. I am usually not a big fan of them, but this one tasted very good. It poured a very dark brown color and had a pretty good head but did not last long. The smell caught me kind of off guard with its smokey scent, but it intrigued me and I could not wait to drink. The flavor was great. It had a little bit of a nutty flavor which I expected, but it had a good hop bite and just a hint of smoke in there too which made this a wonderful drink. If I ever go for a Brown ale again, this will be my first choice","Dmann","Oct 09, 2003"

3.92,7.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Bottled Dec. 2002, 22oz bomber. This brew was dying to get out of this bottle, cap nearly shot into space. Deep brown with sizable head, light retention and only minimal lacing. This didn't detract from enjoyment. Lots of carbonation in this bottle yet smooth and crisp. Aroma is super malty and sweet. Smells great in fact and reminds me of a good German Dunkel. This Brown's easily better than Newcastle in my opinion and has improved since the last time I had it a couple years ago. Flavor is malty and nutty and body is light yet completely enjoyable.","BierReise","Jul 09, 2003"

Smooth in texture though the mouth feel is a bit on the thin side. Taste is roasted chocolaty malts followed by a mildly nutty flavor and a dry hop bitterness. Finish is a bit weak. A nice brown ale though nothing great. Thanks to Loki for the sample!","Morris729","Jun 21, 2003"
3.95,7.9,4,4,4,3.5,4,"The taste was watery, I don't know if it was an old bottle or if it was too cold. After waiting for it to warm up a bit, it was indead too cold. After warming up a bit, I tasted malt, semi-chocolate chocolate. Finished clean, crisp and a little dry. The mouthfeel is a little light, but the drinkability is right on. A good beer, make sure it is just slightly chilled.","Loki","Jun 12, 2003"
4,9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark brown in color. Aroma of fruit and a nice caramel. Slight chocolate aroma came through the more I was in contact with it. Moderate bitterness but not extremely noticeable as the beer is still all about hops. Chocolate, caramel and fruit flavors are the most noticeable. A very nice beer and bonus points for the cool label.","jreitman","Apr 17, 2003"
3.72,1.6,3.5,4,4,3.5,3,"Medium dark brown color. Minimal fizzy beige head. Initial smells of roasted carmel malt, and some sweet milk chocolate. Taste was smooth at first, toasted carmel, sweet chocolate smoothness. Some slighly harsh sulfer or metallic tastes present on the finish. Carmel malt sweetness lingers. Light bodied, water feel. Flavors and feel fall apart to a watery slick, and metallic second half of the glass. Brought a really good beer down to the middle of the pack.","StevieW","Mar 22, 2003"

Aroma is alternatingly malty and nutty. Sweet roasted malt and caramel flavors. Finish is pretty weak and was not sustained throughout the glass. I found myself uninterested by the end. Still it starts out pretty well so that is worth something.","Dogbrick","Mar 03, 2003"

Nice caramel malt taste comes on first followed by a nice hop balance.  Not a whole lot going on in this beer.  Nice smooth mouthfeel but it does leave a coating behind in the mouth.  Nicely drinkable.  Wouldn't be a bad session brew but that is probably the only scenario that I would like this, kind of dull, there are better brown ales out there.","Murph","May 19, 2002"
4.04,10.4,4,5,4,2,4,"Deep dark opaque brown.  A potent nose full of mature hops and cocoa.  Powerful kick of hops with chocolate malt notes.  You expect a sweetness, but it never comes.  Grows even more bitter in the finish, slightly dry in the finish.  Odd mouthfeel, very carbonated, soda-pop texture.  Claims to be smooth, there is nothing smooth about this brew.","Jordan","Jan 08, 2002"
