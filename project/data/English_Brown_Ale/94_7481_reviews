"I wasn't particularly fond of the way that Long Trail used American hops in their Hibernator Scottish-style ale because they just don't quite fit. I didn't find that they worked within the overall balance of the beer. Inappropriate hops, however, are not the case here. They've used Northern Brewer and they work out just fine, regardless of where they were actually grown (I'm assuming Pacific northwest). Northern Brewer hops are, in fact, fairly traditional for an English-style brown ale. In this case they add a bit of leafiness, mint-iness, and subtle grassiness at a level that's just strong enough to stand out from the nutty, chocolatey, and lightly caramel-ish maltiness. One valid question might then be, ""have they used too much hop flavor as the style really calls for the malt to dominate, followed by the yeast character as the second feature?", and I think the answer is yes. However, this IS an American beer, not an English beer; and I feel that simply mimicking another beer or style really serves no purpose. If I wanted a true English brown ale I could buy one, and therefore this beer is unique. It remains ""English"" in nature but with a twist. As long as it works, and I think it does, then we should just let style go. With that said, hedonistically, I think it's quite a nice beer, and it's quite enjoyable. It's well-made with a good appearance and a nice balance. Additionally, it's fairly accessible and fits in with a wide variety of situations despite its darker appearance. Worth trying."

"O - One of Long Trail's better beers, but still wayyyy off from the mark. I had a fresher one of these prior to now, but it wasnt much different."

"Real good brown ale. I'd like to see less smokiness, and more malty sweetness, but can't complain anymore than that."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a ruby-brown coloring, both vibrant and clear, with only a slight ring of film on the surface. Subtle, slightly watery nose, with hints of toffee rich and sweet, as well as some warming spices of nutmeg and all-spice. Flavors are light, as well, with a rich, roasty quality supporting sweet nut and subtle toffee characteristics. Very smooth and rich, but the lighter body keeps the palate manageable. Smooth, rich aftertaste that is light and sweet, with a crisp, clean finish."
"Pours a deep, dark copper with a finger of head that leaves little behind except a trace of lace on the glass. There is some subtle nuttiness in the nose. The flavor is bready, but generally light bodied. The finish is semi-dry and makes for a pleasant end to a good, but certainly not exciting offering from a solid, but not exceptional brewery."

"The heat and humidity of the day may be affecting these beers as well as me. I got a massive two-plus fingers of thick, deep-tan head almost instantly, requiring that I back off of the pour. It all finally settled into mere wisps, but I do not fault the brewers, and instead the broiling temperatures. Color was a deep reddish-brown with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a nuttiness to it, not a bad thing in a brown ale. Mouthfeel was medium and man, was this a nutty flavor on the tongue! Squirrels would die for something like this. As a self-avowed hophead, not so much. Still, it was appropriate for the style and it sure beat drinking a sugary malt bomb. Finish was semi-dry and while I may not want more than one, it was certainly not a bad beer."

"Taste is malty with nutty toffee undertones, high carbonation, nothing explosive, mild flavors but nothing to hate either, medium to thin body, easy drinking if you feel like having another."

"Overall, a solid brown ale flavors are pretty straightforward with a touch of some fruitiness to give a it a more cask type flavor"
"Overall this beer was typical of other English styles I’ve had. Rather thin with a couple signature notes that seemed to stand out."
""
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer but it seems to fall short on flavor. Nothing offensive, but there doesn't seem to be much going on."
""
"Really impressed with the things I've tried from Long Trail. Consistent in quality and hard to beat price-wise. Good choices for those wanting quality brew on a budget."

"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of what looks like 093011. Pours a dark brown with ruby hues and no head. Aroma is sweet and malty. Somewhat earthy with some caramel and spices. Taste is somewhat subdued. Spices and some caramel malts but its a pretty light tasting beer. Not a whole lot going on. Thin mouthfeel as well. If it weren't for the flavor of the spices you usually find in Winter beers I'd say this is more of a spring/summer beer. Regardless, its nothing special. Overall, its an ok beer in the Survival Pack but I wont be seeking it out."

"O: a good brown ale, very smooth and easy to drink. It could use more depth though"
"This has been made available on tap for the Barley House Restaurant in Concord, N.H. U.S.A. under the moniker of ""Black Ice Pond Ale."" Sampled on January 15, 2011. The pour was a decent looking amber brown/red with about a half inch of light tan head that leaves a delicate silkiness on top. The aroma is of sweet malts, yeast, and light nuttiness. The mouthfeel was medium. There is a sharp bitterness in the overall flavor coupled with a slightly hopped ending. Quite nice."
"Off tap at Monty's Old Brick Tavern in Williston this beer is a contract brew. Only available at four locations under this name it can also be found under alternate names as it is THE contract brew produced by Long Trail. For example, I believe it is the exact same beer as the Church Street Tavern Ale Leunig's Ale et. al only under different names. The color of the beer was a classic copper with one finger of off-white head. The aroma was very light, toasted malt and only hints of hops. The flavors were very nutty, toasted malt, a little caramel malt and a touch of floral hops. Clearly very low in alcohol. Dry and slightly bitter at the end. The mouthfeel was ok, the body light and the carbonation medium. Balanced and sessionable but unremarkable."
"D: This was my second favorite batch from Long Trail. A good mixture leaning towards complex."
"Fairly thick with a medium tan head and dark drown body. Sweet malty flavor with some spice but not really any bitterness. Smooth and easy drinking and a pretty good Brown Ale. If you like Newcastle then give this one a try, you'll probably like it as well."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style. The first time I tried this beer at a tasting along with the regular Long Trail Ale, I wasn’t very thrilled with either of them. Since then, I’ve grown a liking for most of Long Trail’s beers and although this beer tastes better now than when I first tried it, I’m still not liking it too much."
"Pours a darker amber with basically no head. Nose is woody with a touch of caramel and just a touch of dust. Flavor is a bit woody with sweet tones. Robust and thick with flavor. Off the flavor alone I would say this is worth trying. Feel is nice on the liquid and good with the carbonation too. Extremely drinkable. Off the flavor alone, worth going for. This on-tap might be interesting. On cask...who knows."
"I usually judge Long Trail for making all of their brews just a hair different from the standard Long Trail Ale, but Hit the Trail is unique enough to be certified as an English Brown, and not a bad one to boot."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable- easy to quaff. Low alcohol content and li/refreshing nature would make this a great brew to take along to, say, a camping trip?"
"What a great surprise to find this on tap in the hospitality lounge of the Sierra Suites Hotel in East Fishkill, NY this week! Had a couple and was hard to leave for dinner that evening. This had a fairly light, cider-like look. A little cloudy but I didn't notice much of anything sizable floating about. A fair head that held pretty well. The aroma has a light hops and slight citrus tone to it. I tasted a bit of lemon in this and a mild hop, fairly light with fine carbonation. This is very drinkable but tastey. Went well with our salsa snacks as well. Very clean stuff for something that's not filtered! Another hit for Long Trail."
"Very smooth mouthfeel with a grainy feel from the tartness.Goes down extremely well. Could get some lower ratings from a slight watery feel. I thought it was a good English Brown really enjoyable and highly drinkable."
"Pours a redish brown. Looks watery, not much head or lacing. Smell is weak. Some roasted malt, and chocolate. Body is thin,and watery. Taste is ok,but weak. Malty, with some hints of fruit. This beer tasted watered down. Maybe I picked up a bad bottle."
"nice dark brown color, one finger head that fades to a ring on the glass, with a nice lace to the finish. smell is caramel and toasted malt. taste same with a faint semi sweet chocolate in the balance. mouthfeel is light, smooth, good carbonation and a clean finish. great session beer. wish i had a couple more right now."
"Don't know if I would drink a full sixer of this particular beer, but makes a nice change-of-pace brew in the Long Trail 12-pack. Perfect to balance you out if your last few brews were a classic over-hop. None of the Long Trail selections blow me away, but the price is reasonable and all their selections are above average."
"Bottle: Poured a dirty brown color ale with a rather large head with average retention. Aroma of caramel malt with some sweetness. Taste is also dominated by some roasted malt with a nice lingering caramel-like sweetness. Body is just above average with some good carbonation. Better then most standard brown ale out there but nothing to write home about."
"D: The ale is very drinkable, especially when bottled, with the nuts and caramel really standing out."
"A nice dark ale with a good amount a coffee malt and very little head. Rick Dark color and decent aroma, with very little hint of hops, the malt takes away from it. Sticks in your mouth after the swallow, so if you are going to drink it i would say dont switch to other beers cause it stays there. For me i think it would be a definitely decent winter type beer."
"Long Trail decided to take a great tasting and their best selling beer and spruce it up a bit. They kept it unfiltered and dry hopped it creating a nice offering. Nice dark brownish cloudy orangy red color with a nice creamy white head. Mild lacing around the glass. Smooth crisp light maltiness and hop smell. Nice mouthfeel light taste of malt very clean and refreshing. Had a nice aftertaste with some hoppy tones in the flavor. Great drinkability and very enjoyable. I would drink this beer if they offered it again. Good overall beer that I think anyone would find delicious. I had it on tap at the 2006 VT Brewers Festival. I was able to really enjoy it in the VIP tent. Sometimes one 3oz. taste is not enough!"
"D - Not too bad but not enough flavors standing out."
"This was a dark brown beer with a medium head that lasted. A tiny bit of lacing. It had a roasted malt and slightly grainy aroma. The taste was sweet, raisin bread-like, with a little bit of hops coming in. A pleasant beer, kind of middle of the road for this style of beer."
"Medium-dark brown with a reddish-copper tinge. 1 ½ cm of head after a fairly aggressive pour. Head is pillowy, antique white and diminishes to a moderately thick film. Smells of warm, smooth roasted malts with a light hop bite. Lots of sweet caramel and butterscotch, along with dark bread, light nuts, chocolate, citrus and very light sweaty yeast. Taste-wise, more bready malts up front, with a nutty finish and a little dark fruit in the middle. Its body is a little thinner than I like and English brown ale to be (but its still ok), it has a lightly dry texture, very slight metallic finish and low carbonation. Overall, its not a bad brown ale. Nothing all that exciting, but a very satisfying and easy-drinking beer."
"This pours a darkish red brown with a medium tan head. There is alot of carbonation in this beer. The smell is average with some malt sweetness to it,but nothing outstanding. The taste is a creamy malt sweetness with alot of carbonation. This is an interesting beer. The m/f is light with the aftertaste being somewhat watery. This is a decent beer that I would try again and one of the better American Brown Ales."
"Drinkability: The taste is laid back enough to make this an easy session brew, but the bitterness makes it harder to throw down the hatch. I think it's a little too bitter, but overall I could quaff it easier than most beers, let alone sweeter brown ales."
"I must admit that in general I'm not fanatical about Long Trail's offerings. This brown ale, however, stands with Double Bag and their unfiltered IPA at a cut above the rest."
"Musings: Another typical nice offering from Long Trail. Given the price point and availability - well worth the effort."
"Not worth seeking out on its own, but worth a try overall if its made available to you."
"Poured a lovely dark brown color that was suprisingly translucent. A soft head developed quickly, but dissipated quickly as well leaving behind little bits of lacing. Aromas of nuts, burnt toast, coal, and brown sugar seemed apparent to me; above average, but not entirely enticing. The taste was as might be expected with pronounced roasted flavors that were bitter-sweet. A rather smooth finish with lingering bitterness that added depth and texture to the beer. Slightly thin in my mouth, but coated my tongue nicely as the flavors stayed for some time. In terms of drinkability, I might be a bit bias as I happen to really enjoy Brown Ales (American & English) and find them to be among the most drinkable beers around. An enjoyable beer that represents the style fairly well."
"I had this beer for the expressed purpose that, I wanted to drink more than just winter seasonals. So I tried this one. The color was a rich cola brown, nice head. It was quite smooth going down, much to my surprise. Overall I'd say this is a very good brown ale."
"-maybe my tastebuds are too conditioned to IPA's"
"For a beer, it's good. For an English brown, it's good (exemplifies quiet but smooth but tasty and pleasant characteristics). But it's not my preference when it comes to brown ales in general--I want more nutty, more complex chocolate, more of a transition of flavors (see my Ithaca Cascazilla review), and it needs just a little work on aftertaste and multidimensional flavor. How's that for a vague hippy review? Solid beer, excellent transition beer, beautiful artisanship, but needs depth. Hooray Beer!"
"This brew pours a beautiful brown color thats tinted with an amber-bronze tone. The head is a little shallow and unremarkable, but the appearance of the liquid is truly enticing. The smell of this beer grows on you as you work though the glasstoasted malt and grains come out in waves. Theres just a little hops, and a nut and bread-crust character thats terrific. Caramel as well. Its a fairly dry beer, with a nice balancing bitterness. Theres bit of metallic taste. The body is a little light, borderline watery. All in all, though, its a very enjoyable and drinkable brew."
"My bottle of Hit the Trail Ale is dated 10/06/05, so it is perhaps a little past its prime. It pours a crystal clear brown with a tinge of red and a uniform white head. Aroma is some slight floral hops, along with some nutty and chocolatey flavors. Taste is nutty and malty and roasted. Finish is off-dry with some undefined bitterness. Mouthfeel is rather thin. Goes down easy, but a pretty unexceptional brew. Not to say that it is bad, but this is not my first choice among Long Trail's offerings."
"poured a medium amber color with moderrate white head that fell to a thin coating. Left very nice lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is toasty, carmelly, with some fruitiness also present. Taste is strong on malt with some more caramel showing through. Finished sweet and fruity. A good , easy to dring beer. Good example of an English Brown Ale."
"The bottle specifies that this beer is a northern English style brown, and as such is intended to be drier and hoppier than the southern variety, and this brand seems to fulfill those characteristics."
"Mouthfeel is slighty towards the watery side, and lightly crisp at the start and finish. Drinkability is OK, but this is a little weak and dull on the tastebuds. If you want a very mellow brew for a session, this is one to get."
"I would buy this again in a heartbeat for regular hanging out. Sure, it isnt as challenging as belgians etc but it is a damn fine drinking brew with enough to satisfy the beer dork within you when you arent being hardcore writing down ratings etc. I would serve this with something hearty like beef stew or ribs, maybe even italian red fare like chicken parm or caccitore."
"A very mild version of the style. Odd combination of flavors, but nothing too unpleasant. Another?...I'll pass."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"poured a clear brillant amber red witha a thin weak watery head. hints of chewy malt in the aroma along with some toasted and chocolate and caramel grain. More carbonation than expected witha thin mouthfeel...over all nothing great about this, it's ok if nothing else is available."
"Feels kind of watery and a bit chewy all at once, as if it can't make up its mind which direction it wants to go in. Decently drinkable, but I can see the metalic qualities become increasingly annoying and unappetizing. Not a bad beer by far, but certainly not one of my favorites. If you're going for Long Trail, check out their other beers first."
"Another solid offering from Long Trail... worth a try."
"Overall-while not the most breathtakingly flavorful brown ale out there this ale is refreshingly smooth and incredibly easy to drink for the style. Recommended to those new to the style or to craft beer."
"A 1/4"" tan head forms while pouring, but it doesn't stay long. Now there's just a tiny ring of suds around the glass and a few patches on the surface. The color is a dark amber as duly noted already. The smell of rich malt is present over the ale. In the flavor this maltiness opens up into a hugely complex taste. There aren't any apparent esters, so the malts and wheat in the flavor taste like what they are. Hit the Trail has a thin bodied mouthfeel. It's perfect for an early spring session.. but it would be acceptable in any season."
"Pours with a dark amber color. The head is a bit on the thin side, but the smell is quite nice and sweet. The flavor is sweet, a little hoppy, and slightly on the bitter side but very nice. The feel - at least this batch - is a little on the flat side, but goes down quite smoothly. A very enjoyable english style ale."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery at times, though overall this one is very smooth and a touch creamy. I can't say that I was thrilled with it, but was far from disappointed as well. It's basically a solid, above average session-type brew from LT, which is not so surprising. I'm not running back to this one anytime soon, but I'd be happy to drink it from time to time as well."
"Pours a dark brown with nice ruby highlights. A small white head forms and a nice continual stream of carbonation winds up from the bottom of the glass. The aroma is sweet with malt and touches of brown sugar. To be honest, the aroma is the worst part of this beer, because I love the taste. This seems to be a theme for me with Long Trail beers, I wonder why? The first thing I taste is brown sugar. This firms up into a beautiful malt backbone that has definite caramel highlights. The aftertaste hits almost as hard as the beer itself with the same malt composition. Even though all the tastes I've described are ""sweet"" smells, the beer itself isn't very sweet at all. This is a great attribute, sweet beers tend to be off-putting to me. The tastes are there without the cloying sweetness. This beer really surprised me in a good way. I wasn't expecting much, but this is a really great session ale that goes down easily and is never offensive."
"12 ouncer tried, with bottled on dating on the label. Clear almond flows out of the bottle, insipid white head, dissolving to nothing, no lacing to write about. Nose is fairly weak, just perhaps a wiff of doughness. Not getting a great amount of malt/hops/flavor/complexity here. Clearly a subtle, British style Brown ale. Not impressed, LT makes better stuff then this."
"I had come to expect more from Long Trail."
"A bit more robust in comparison to the Long Trail Ale. As with most other LT beers, this would work as a good session beer."
"The taste was slightly bitter, lightly roasted, and a hint of caramel. Overall a very nice beer. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and recommend it highly."
"Medium bodied, easy to drink but a bit too sweet."
"Pours a rich copper brown with two fingers of rocky white head. Abundant lacing is evident. The smell is sweetish malt with a hint of floral/citrus. The taste is slightly sweet at first with a short dry finish. Very mush a good specimen of an English brown or a German Alt. Not sure what the difference would be except maybe the hop profile."
"Clear, ruby-brown in hue with a bronzy highlight, what a beautiful color. The head developed poorly, at the apex it was a half finger in height but quickly dissipated to a thin cap. After a few moments the cap faded to a collar. There was no subsequent lacing. The nose has its charm, it does lack in potency a bit thus I cant completely grasp the aromas. I do detect some toasty, caramel malts. I absolutely adore this in Brown Ales. But I do not welcome the buttery, butterscotch notes. Strange sweet, flowery, fruity notes too. Airy finish. The bouquet is fair, not inviting but not off-putting. Im curious to take a sip even though I hardly know what to expect. I like my Brown Ales to taste like small porters. This one does not. So I will judge it accordingly. There is a wide butterscotch flavor that muddles the palate, IMO. This forces the toasty, caramel flavors to the background. Some sweetness is found at the back, towards the finish before a charred taste emerges. This odd combination lingers into the aftertaste. I can tolerate it but I dont love it. Weak hop bitterness; any true flavors contributed are not discernible. Overall, the palate is good enough but it needs to be paired with some grilled foods or at least some sharp cheddar cheese. Medium/medium-light in body, low carbonation but the mouthfeel is still pleasant. I like this beer. It is okay. But one 12-ounce bottle was enough for me. Thanks for the sample UnionMade and the glass!"
"A decent beer, definitely one of Long Trail's better offerings, but nothing I'd go out of my way to buy again. I've had this beer a couple times, and it seems a bit different with each bottle. Retrying it, the diacetyl is less pronounced, with stronger hop flavor and graininess. In keeping with Long Trail's rough hewn sort of flavor, but with perhaps a little more complexity to keep you interested. A bit muddy, with an indistinct style, as is the case with most of Long Trail's beers. I just reviewed it for what it was, not following any sort of style guideline."
"dark copper/brown witha tan head. light raosted coffee aroma ith some other roasted malt characteristics, and some butterscotch. bitter coffee flavors, with slight nuttiness, chocolate, and caramel. faint burnt and smoke flavors too. medium bodied with relatively strong carbonation. it sort of interrupts the flavors a bit. overall pretty mediocre, but drinkable. needs less carbonation, a little less dryness and a little more flavor to make a decent brown ale."
"Pours with an off white head of foam. Clear, light auburn liquid. Nose of very light coffee, roasted malt and brown sugar makes for an appetizing aroma. Bittersweet roasted malt with bubbly carbonation, nice subdued flowery hop zing follows. The finish dances on the line between sweet and bitter/dry. Super session ale...I put away a sixer of this stuff while in NH with no problem whatsoever."
"Pours with a decent head, which dissipated rather quickly. Lacing all along the sides of the glass. Smell is rather sweet, malty. Taste is of sweet malt followed by a hoppy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is slightly spicy. An easy beer to down more than one at a time. Recommended."
"Over all I feel it is a good beer nothing to get overly excited about but one that I would not mind having once in a while!"
"This beer pours a nice red/orange hue. There is little to no head. The nose is quite sweet and malty, but with a good hop balance. The taste is thin but loaded with bitterness. This is uncommon for brown ales. There is a winy, almost faintly vinegar quality. The mouthfeel is a decent, not very impressive. Drinkability is the hey to this beer. It would be a great session beer. A nice hoppy brown ale."
"The beer pours an amber color with an offwhite head that fades to lacing. The aroma is fruity from the yeast and sweet smelling from the use of several specialty malts. The taste is refreshing. It has a slight brown sugar feel to it. It's a refreshing ale that is light yet retains a malty character. The mouthfeel is good. It is a light/medium bodied ale with good carbonation. This is a fine ale to break out for the part-time beer lover."
"A ""safe"" beer if that makes any sense. It's taste seems pretty cookie cutter. It does nothing to disuade you from drinking it, but it doesn't make you want to run out to the store to get it either."
"The head looks just like the one you get on root beer. Sweet malty aroma, almost like a lager. Dark amber in color, with a moderate amount of lacing along the glass. The taste is mildly malty, offset by a light dry hoppiness. Fairly light body, not much in the aftertaste besides the original flavors fading. Very drinkable, although I could go for a little more hops."
"I wouldn't buy this one again, but it is well made and if you like this type of brown go for it.."
"Notes: Chalk this one up as another great session beer, paired well with a lightly spicy blackened chicken and caramelized onions."
"Nice looking clear auburn. Slight beige head recedes to a collar in seconds. The lacing is pretty nice. Nice yeastiness on the nose mixed with brown sugar and toffee malt characteristics. Very nice. This beer has almost a full body and a nice little silky smooth mouthfeel. The flavors blend together nicely. Caramel and chocolate. Dates and yeasiness. Dry hoppiness and toasted maltiness. Very nicely down. Good solid brown ale. I like this brewery."
"A pretty average brown here in my humble opinion,pours more of an amber than brown color with a pretty light head aroma is lightly vinagery and kinda funky.Taste is pretty harsh when cold as it warms becomes more of the style lightly earthy and sweet but nothing spectacular.A prety average brown nothing really sticks out."
"Tastes kin of tart and sour. Solid maltiness. Spicy and hoppy with a sour finish. Sticky and sweet with low carbonation. Nice brown ale but nothing special. A solid session brew as it is very drinkable."
"Long Trail brews this beer for the Church Street Tavern on Church Street in lovely Burlington, Vermont. It is a mild brown ale with a beautiful mouthfeel. This brew is oh so very drinkable. It rolls down into my belly with love. The 17 malts and hops give this a nice malty balance with some more subtile overtones. A great brew to drink all night!"
"I like this beer because I like hops, not as a brown ale but as a session beer. A six pack of this may be on hand for the next football Sunday. Cheers!"
"Overall, a decent, light-bodied brown ale, but not one I'd search out."
"Thanks to Mikeys01 for the sample."
"Still gotta give thanks to mickeys01 for the bottle."
"It pours a nice dark amber color with a foamy off white head sitting on top. A faint malty aroma with a hint of hops greets you before each sip. The beer is medium bodied, creamy and mainly has flavors of caramel. Some hops make an appearance towards the end of each sip. A mildly bitter-sweet aftertaste is all that is left behind."
"Pours with hardly any head and no lace, light carbonation. Light crystal clear, copper color, malty and medium bodied with a hint of brown sugar in the aroma. Smooth (no roughness found) slightly sweet flavor and just a hint of hops. The best so far from Long Trail."
"Dark amber/copper color with an appetizing frothy beige head. The head settles very slowly, and leaves nice lace on the glass. Smells of sweet malt, a bit of yeast, and mild hops. Flavor is semi-sweet malt, nice and roasty, a bit of caramel. Brown sugar aftertaste. Very warm flavor, with smooth and creamy mouthfeel. This is really nice, one of the best I've had from Long Trail. Got to get more of these."
"I was able to purchase a single of this, it usually must be purchased in a twelve pack. It poured a nice amber reddish color. It was pleasant enough, good hops, tastey malts. This is a good after activity session beer. I could picture myself drinking this in front of a campfire. I wonder how it goes with s'mores?"
"Well I was glad to find a 6pack of this stuff - three in a mixpack was just not enough. Pours a coppery-reddish color with a filmy off-white head that dissapated quickly. It had a crisp malty nose, with the tiniest bit of floral hops and spices. Very smooth refreshing mouthfeel, and the taste is very good as well. Perfectly balanced, it very quickly moves from roasty malt to crisp hop bite, accompanied with a hint of spices throughout. It tasted almost like a winter brew crossed with a brown ale. Very good, I liked the picture of the hiker on the front too. This would be great to finish off a hike with - very refreshing."
"Note: Just a bit more hops to balance out the malt"
