"Ruby colored with a light tan head. Smells of raisins, molasses and burnt bread crust.  A bit of that continues in the taste, but the addition of caramel is what stands out, as well as some stale hop bitterness that I found a little off-putting.  Surprisingly light bodied compared to the strong aroma.  It's good, but I would have liked a bit more in the body to match the amazing aroma."

"Overall: Perfect fall beer. Picked up 3 bottles to compare to a clone I tried to make. Definetely picking out the chocolate malt in the flavor and black malt in aroma, and perhaps the sugar additions gives it that molasses flavor. A little surpised at the light booziness. Pretty sure it's there but perhaps just my palate tonight."

"Great Brown Ale; Smooth, sweet at times, hoppy, balanced.  Looks dark and seems like it should be heavier but it is very easy to drink.  Up there with DFH Brown and Smuttynose for me. I'll be grabbing this again soon."

"Best brown ale I have ever had...not really into the style but THIS beer just plain 'ol rocks."

"O - I like the comforting earthy qualities of this beer. While I find it a good example of the style, I still think I would pick a Sam Smith's Nut Brown over this. But, this will definitely slake my thirst of the style."

"overall, I liked this. a little unsure of the sediment I allowed by storing on its side, but it's got a very beautiful color to it. the color alone drew me in. the taste is certainly not the typical 'brown' taste, and I really like that for a change. good beer! but $15 a pop here in California is a killer for me... especially at 5.9%"

"o: A very nice English style brown ale. However, there are cheaper options of quality in this category (Woodstock Inn's Pig's Ear remains my favorite English brown, at about half the price of St. B's), so despite enjoying it, I would probably not buy this again."
""
"The ale is an effortless ale to drink as it is highly rewarding in flavor but crisp and semi-clean and palatable to finish. The 22oz bottle was no match for this thirsty guy!"

"O: A very nice English brown ale. Not the most complex, but that's not what most English or English-style ales are. Very easy to drink and quite quaffable. Pretty Things also never disappoints with their price point. Recommended if you're into the style"

"A light, clean, malty odor floats up from this nicely-turbid medium-brown ale. Saint Botolph's has a rustic character indeed, with sharp, very-slightly sour notes effervescing above the rich sweetness of the malt. I've had darker browns, but perhaps not truer; the roasting is exquisite and not at all overdone, like some browns, nor is it overly rich or sweet or in any other sense trying too hard to hit the ""brown"" mark. I'm a fan of this style, and this crisp, clean, softly piquant offering is one of the best iterations I've tried. The only downside is it isn't sold in six-packs."
""

"Deep chestnut brown. Very nice head and lacing. The mild and pleasant toasty raisin smell leads nicely to the first sip and becomes more noticeable thereafter. If malt can be described as nectar, this comes close - not so much because it is thick or too sweet, but because the sweetness is so well integrated with the aroma. So are the yeasts, the herbal hops, the roasted flavors. This is a remarkable brown ale. Though it is bitter, this is a textbook example, for me at least, of how elegantly bitter flavors can be integrated into the overall picture. Amazing."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink and quite sessionable - in fact, everyone at the table enjoyed it and most people ordered a second glass with lunch."

"Poured a hearty, dark brownish color with minimal head but some decent lace that stuck around. Picking up slight hops in the aroma along with roasted and bready malts, touches of something like dark chocolate, caramel and maybe something burnt and/or toffeeish (not real specific, I know). Thicker, fuller-bodied than most browns, smooth and goes down easy, I enjoyed this beer but it was just a tad off for me. The sweetness from the beer seems to derive from dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, and yeast and is balanced with not only a larger-than-normal earty hoppiness but roasted, toasted, possibly burnt malts and a cracker-like dry breadiness that almost creates a chewey sensation. Unfortunately, as I slowly sipped the beer and it warmed, the taste (I won't say the ABV b/c it is not even at 6) seemed to go towards the dryer parts of this beer and the smoothness dipped a little, so basically the beer became dry and husky and the sweetness and the touch of hops subdued. A good beer but not my personal favorite for this style."

"I HIGHLY recommend it!"

"Pours a dark brown color with a hint of red. Small amount of head. Smell is a fruity caramel malt, but not overly sweet. A fruity brown ale. Bit nutty with a bitter finish. The bitterness is on the intense side. Just a touch of toffee."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from 22oz botle into tulip. Nice chestnut brown color with a bit of off white head. Great toffee and sweet malt aromas. Taste is sweet english style malts, toffee, and a bit of honey. Really easy to drink, and has a nice balance of sweet malts to noble hop. Really nice."

"The beer pours a beautiful caramel brown like a light roast coffee with a light creamy head that sits at a sticky half of a finger’s width and leaves a thin sticky wall of spatterwork lacing. The beers body is dark but seems clean, and there are lots of bubbles coming up the sides from carbonation. The beer smells richly malty with a nice lactic souring to the back of the smell. The nose is reminiscent of brown sugar and dark fruits or craizens (cranberry raisins). There are faint roasty notes, but the lactic sour overpowers them swiftly and is a little off-putting. The beer tastes wonderfully roasty and nutty with notes of brown sugar and biscuity malts. The tastes begins with faint lactic sours and then opens up into big roasted nut flavors before closing back to roasted burn with hints of lactic sugars, like in a milk stout. I am, of course, aware that these aren’t really lactic sugars or sours that I taste, but that is the best I can do to describe them, so bare with me. The sour gives hints towards slight pear, raisin, and apple flavoring before it is burnt away. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, kissing the tongue with barely any hint of prickly carbonation, and only a smooth blanket of chewy beer. The tongue is left quite dry and slightly burnt as the beer leaves, which definitely encourages more liquid to calm it down. There is also a slight tea astringency/tightness to the tongue reminiscent of hops bitters, but different and slightly earthy. Overall this is a tremendously odd ale that perfectly defies definition in true Pretty Things style. It is a delightful sipper, weighing in just above a session ale, but goes down nicely. Another great beer from Pretty Things, and worthy of a sip, though I liked Collaboration #3 with Boulevard Brewing more in terms of similar beers."
""
"Overall (4/5): Pretty Things' Saint Botolph's Town is a solid brown ale, one that I think is pretty unique in its hoppy dryness and rustic earthy tones. While I favor Dogfish Head's Indian Brown, this is also a very good American interpretation of a traditional English style. Perhaps not the best Pretty Things beer, but a good choice as the seasons change and the cool fall air settles in."

"O: this was really yumy, nothing over the top, just very well balanced and all around delicious. I will deffinatly be drinking this one again and again."
"In fact, the finish is quite bitter and even becomes dry. This drinks, really, like a coffee-chocolate liqueur with a hint of the creaminess of Bailey's. As much like a liqueur as a beer, but not as thick."
""
"O: Delicious and unique beer. Thoroughly enjoyed the entire bomber. The differences between English and American ales are such a gift to beer drinkers. I love the contrasts of the styles on each side of the pond."

"The body is full and smooth with soft carbonation. Overall this one is solid. One of the better browns on the market."
"Taste is much less interesting or satisfying than the aroma promised. It is spicy-raisiny slightly burnt prunes, fermented brown bread, spicy woody bitterness. The aftertaste is vague toasted brown bread and some prune. It has too much of a burnt-bitter spicy quality that tends to dominate too much and ends up, after initial promises of complexity, being rather one-dimensional and thin of character, whilst at the same time being rather heavy. It settles on very much a simple but heavy burnt bread/prune character with vague spicy bitterness and nothing else."
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. Carbonation is moderate. Overall I thought it was a very good beer. It was very flavorful but also pretty easy drinking. Very good version of the style as well."
""
"O- To be fair, not my favorite style, but an enjoyable Brown. Would not mind having again."
""
"poured a clear extremely deep amber with 2 fingers of tan head. smells of grapes, plum, chocolate. a very nice roasty flavor with a delicious caramel/nut/fruity backbone. this beer smells and tastes like autumn. medium bodied with a nice carbonation feel - nice amounts of lacing on the glass. this is a very solid and enjoyable dessert beer.. but for me, tonight, this is my dinner. a very filling sweet brown ale with a very traditional feel to it. malty, fruity, sweet and roasty. this really is a pretty thing!"

"Found at the Wild Horse in Beverly, Massachusetts, this brown ale is a dark brown with yellowish edges and a light tan head and nice lacing. The aroma brings malty coffeee-charcoal with some nice citrus hop nuances . The flavor is much the same with grapefruit blended with the brown bread malt. There's a nutty brown bread backbone that evolves into more coffeee. This is a medium body brew with an easy drinking and low carbonation feel. Flavorful for sure, one of the better brown ales I've had in a lonf while."
"O: Nice example of a brown ale. Not as nutty as some, it's focused more on the toasted/roasted malt character. Well balanced, smooth and tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Starts nutty and chalky on the palate, then turns rich and fruity before finishing hoppy and nutty again. Strong, almost metallic minerals, pure malted barley, dry roasted peanuts, bitter greens (almost mustardy or radishy), honey, oak, and tobacco all check in. The overall impression is toasty, fortified, and brown, but also dry and somehow light, and it leaves a long, fruity, woody aftertaste. Very interesting and unique without being odd – a beer for all seasons, and one you can drink if you can't decide between something English, something Belgian, or something American."

"Easy flowing combined with improving quality with warmth makes this a great choice for a second or third round. However, at almost 6% ABV, one should take their time with this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"While the yeast isn't a hugely obvious or brash factor, the whole thing is such a classy blend of complex, rich malts and yeast that I am almost totally charmed."

"O: Overall, I found this beer pleasant, but not really notable. Would be hard pressed to buy again at $6 a 22oz bottle."
""
"One of the best non-bal browns I've had. After the aroma was afraid this would be a malt bomb, but it's very well balanced and not overly sweet. Will definitely be seeking this one out again."
""
"Overall, a good brown ale. On the hoppy and higher alcohol side for an English brown, but quite good for what it is."
""
""
""
""
"O: a really nice brown ale. could drink lots of this."
""
""
""
""
""

""
"This is a big, malty, English brown ale with plenty of malt backing. Despite the relative size of this, it is still decently easy to drink with the nutty sharpness at the end doing a great job in counteracting the sweetness. Quite nice for a big English brown."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pretty good brown we have here. I think it represents the northern England style brown ale nicely because of the lite cloying and toffee aspect."

"O - Love this beer. Sweet smell. Big malty taste, with a fun funky bitterness."
"O-I def think this is better than the other sampling ive had from this brewery and i could drink all night cheers."
"Nice save, Pretty Things."
"Overall: this is a solid sessionable brown ale. Full of flavor, this one is easy to drink. One of the more flavorful brown ales I have had in a while."
"O: Great price points on this one! I think I paid $5.99 for this bomber and would have gladly paid a dollar or two more. I've never had a bad beer by Pretty Things."
"O: 4"
"I wonder if this really needs to be fresh to be so good. This had some pleasant characters, but everything was muted, mild and a little flat. This helped it all integrate, but also made me shrug a little bit as well. So what?"
"Overal, I like this beer a lot. Big fan browns. Great very rich flavor, however, I wish the carbonation was less, or slightly less bitterness. These two things with strong mineral character make a sharpness that take away from flavor for me. As I let the glass sit and release carb, its gets really good."
"Recieved in a trade, I think $6 bottle."
"An amazing brew. A brown this big, but this tight almost never happens."
"Pours a very deep amber with a thick tan head which slowly recedes, some lacing. White chunky sediment appears at the bottom, looks awesome except for this. Smell is subtle, sweet caramel, some cherry and not much else perhaps due to its age? Taste it good, not too forward, subdued. Sweet caramel malts, slight nuttiness, not much bitterness to speak of, a cherry and raisin aftertaste, ends a little stale. Medium mouthfeel. Overall this is ok, flavors are subtle and work well. I definitely want to try a fresher bottle."
"O/D-This is one of the better Pretty Things brews. Smooth, complex, and begs to be imbibed. I have pushed off trying this one because I have minimal interest and experience in the specific style of beer. I am glad I tried it."
"O - A nice offering from Pretty Things. A nice, clearly english offering that was clean and fresh."
"My first Pretty Things beer and man was I impressed.Poured a deep roasted chesnut brown with amber highlights showing thru,a 1/2 finger tannish colored head atop,malt lovers rejoice from there.Brown sugar,molasses,roasted walnuts,and chocolate all over the place,great malt complexity in a ""small"" beer.Roasted nuts and cakey flavors at the onset with molasses sweetness coming into play,again great malt complexity.I put limits on certain styles of beer because Iam a hophead who likes extreme beers,this wowed me being an English Brown wich I think has never happened,a great beer."
"A good English brown, but bitter enough to be an ESB or something at least."
"Poured into a Duvel tulip, Botolph's is a dark, dark brown with a touch of tan creamy faom left sitting on top. The aroma is simple and clean, with sweet malt and alcohol and a touch of roastiness. A large sip reveals earthy, roasted malt flavors, with the warm alcohol from the aroma in flavor this time. Tastes like a belgian style yeast, considering the pronounced phenolic presence in the flavor. The mouthfeel is full and smooth with a moderate carbonation level. It finishes with lingering bitter roasted malts. Overall a nice beer for a cool evening. The phenolic/warming alcohol presence hampers the drinkability and for me leaves this as a once in a while cool weather sipper to share with a friend. A nice, hearty beer, but drinkability leaves something to be desired for me."
"Just a lovely ale for a cool evening! Very nice!"
"Overall - A superb example of a brown ale... very well balanced and drinkable... definitely recommended..."
"Overall: A good brown ale with lots of character."
"O: A very good brown ale. Well balanced, great flavors, and very drinkable."
"This brew is quite nice, The pour comes out as a nice deep brown color with a fluffy light tan head on it. The lacing was minimal but still not too bad. The smell of the beer was a little bit on the nutty side but also had a subtle sweetness on the nose. The taste had a light hoppy character in there, along with some chocolate too, really interesting tasting brown ale for sure. The mouthfeel had a smooth, richness to it, medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall this is probably one of the best Pretty Things I've had. Really worth checking out."
"The bottle was pretty much the same but with a little more interesting flavors and aromas on the malt end of the spectrum."
"Drink- Pretty good old feeling Brown Ale. This had a nice balance and symmetry to all the flavors. Wasn't a complete roast beer and one sided. Had a nice creamy feel and it was a little chilly in So. Cal last night so this was a good choice in my new dimpled mug."
"O - A decent english brown, but nothing that stands out. If you like the style it is worth trying. Otherwise it is average."
"Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head that disappears quickly. Scent is very nutty with some lovely malt and grain aromas. A bit of a roasted chestnut aroma. Taste is initially very malty, then a shitload of nut flavor comes in. Hints of espresso linger throughout each sip as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a surprisingly crisp finish. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, if brown ales were my thing, I'm sure this beer would get all 5s. This is one of the best brown ales I've had, even though I can't see myself ever getting real into them. But I'm gonna rate this one for it's style."
"O- not a gigantic brown guy but this thing is pretty good (see what i did right there)."
"O - Nice drinker, but nothing that stood out to me."
"Overall: I liked this beer a lot, but felt it was a bit too dark and heavy (more like a porter), and not quite as refreshing as a brown ale should be. It was also a bit pricey."
"O- I really love this beer, beers like this are why I revere brown ales as the ultimate session brews during the fall."
"Overall: What a great take on the English Brown Ale. Very well balanced with some great malts that shine through and a great roast bitterness, with some tartness thrown in for good measure. Another Pretty Thing in the Pretty Things Beer & Ale Project."
"o - overall a nice english brown ale. nothing too crazy. pretty much just good across the board...not mind blowing."
"O: One of the better brown ales I've had. A hard style to distinguish yourself in, but Pretty Things does a memorable job. It's so roasty and thick it's a borderline porter, and it is complemented by a spicy sweetness I associate with Belgian styles. Very enjoyable. Don't hesitate to try it."
"-this is a very good beer. the price tag is a bit of a bummer, considering the assumed cost to make it compared to others in their line-up, but i am glad i drank it"
"Overall this is a very good beer for the style, with a good deal of complexity. Well worth a shot."
"O - Not bad, I guess I really need to drink an English Brown next to an American one so I can experience the differences, but this is a solid beer."
"Saint Botolph's Town is my favorite beer by Pretty Things, and by far. It's rich, toasty, and a bit chocolaty with some nice fig flavor to round it out. The body's medium and it's creamy-smooth once it's warmed a bit. It reminds me of an English-style ""Old Ale"" rather than just a simple ""brown ale"". It's got a kind of brown malt character going on, and it's got a lot of dark caramel that borders on being almost like burnt sugar. It's a hint sweetish but there's a fairly solid bitterness behind it, and a hint of dark malt acidity as well, which lends to the balance and leads into a dry finish where the leafy hops finally appear. You can drink it straight-forward, or you can relax and sip it. Quite charming!"
"Beer is medium bodied and sweet with a mildly dry finish. Overall nice but I've had better browns. I'd have this again. Lots of esters in the midpalate."
"O-Very nice stuff. Will be drinking more of this in the future."
"Notes: Nice brown ale, rich and with a long sense. Now, would I have it again? Sure. Is it worth getting out of one´s way to reach for it? Not so sure about that. But that is me."
"O: My first from Pretty Things. A really good brown ale that made a good first impression. Reminds me a lot of Alesmith Nautical Nut Brown."
"Overall this is a pretty beer to be drinking and hits the spot, just wished it felt a little better."
"Drinkability – This beer is quite incredible. Balance across the board, deep dark fruits, and a unique charred character. It reminds me of the dark fruity characters of a Belgian quadruple. A pretty bold brown ale and a homerun for Pretty Things."
"The complexity may be appealing, but it is a very intellectual pleasure. I find no sensuality here."
"This beer is a surprise. I bought it because I'd tasted two of their beers a while back and had liked them; but I was really just guessing on what it would be like, memory of beer after tasting so many being what it is. It is an excellent, full-flavored beer, something I'm always looking for these days, having tired of the massive overhopping of American craft beers. This is a beer with a strong malt profile, more aggressive in its flavoring than most of the English ales it takes as its progenitors. Were I drinking it in a pub with lots of beers, I'd be ordering it over and over again."
"D - An outstanding English Brown Ale... Beyond solid in all facets... I will gladly stock up on more bottles of this... This really shouldn't be a surprise and Pretty Things continues to impress me with each and every offering..."
"O: A very nice English brown ale kept in line with tradition by withholding the heavy hand of American hops. A bit jacked up still at nearly 6% ABV, this brown ale has smoky, sweet flavors that played nicely off the BBQ brisket sandwich and spicy horseradish sauce I had. I'd definitely pick up a bottle in the future."
"Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and light-bodied. Prickly-feel on the tongue. A good and wholly interesting beer."
"A very flavorful and balanced English Brown. One of the better versions I've had in a while."
"O - loved this beer from the second I popped the cap, I have yet to be discouraged from Pretty Things."
"O: Nicely done beer that I'm glad that I picked up. If I'm in a mood for a different type of English Brown ale, I would definitely get this again. Very easy to drink, perhaps 1-2 at a time."
"You can obviously smell and taste the British influence on Pretty Things beer. This is probably the best Brown Ale I've ever had. Great beer."
"Overall pretty good, a bit on the sweet side, decent hop addition light but earthy, just a touch of a briny taste, but a decent drinkable brown."
"Note: Bottled March 2011, Batch 10"
"The high price point ($9.99 in bombers only)and the dashed expectations were disapointing."
"Drinkability: Easily drinkable"
"O/D: It won't blow you away, but this is one of the better brown ales I've had in a while. Very solid offering by Pretty Things. Might have to pick up a bomber."
"Overall an excellent brew. One of the most complex brown ales I've ever had. So much going on that really clicks together. Very nice."
"O: This beer is very drinkable and would probably be a great dinner or social beer."
"O - This has good drinkability. It goes down easy and has great flavor. I could easily drink a few of these in a sitting. This is my first beer by pretty things, and I'm excited to try more. I would recommend giving this one a try."
"D - Very drinkable. Smooth and balanced flavors, and though they are a touch mild, it is different and interesting. Very nice nutty flavors."
"O: One of the finer 'sessionable' brown ales there is.. Loaded with great earthy and nutty/smoky flavors while the alcohol is almost completely hidden. This would probably become a staple brown ale for me if only it was locally available."
"Awesome brown ale! Drank about a bomber's worth on-tap. There's not too much to speak of as far as looks go, but looks aren't everything. Great malty smell with a light spicy hop scent and dark fruits. Everything compliments everything in this beer There's a touch of booze in here as I've come to know and like in many brown ales, English or American. I never knew how many excellent brown ales there were out there."
"Pours a dark brown, nice subtle redness in the color as well. Coffee colored one-finger head. Decent lacing and retention. Aroma of dark fruits primarily. A bit of toffee and chocolate powder as well. Flavor starts off with nice sweet malts. Unsweetened chocolate, hint of nuttiness, sticky molasses. Toasty bread characteristics. Dark fruit flavor carries the beer until the finish where a decent amount of hops shine through (citrus/pine)."
"Drinkability- Really nice beer. I love how the beer has all the makings and flavor of a sort of English/Belgium Dark Ale but it's not sweet at all and very dry and balanced. It's super easy drinking and very enjoyable. I'd be really interested to try a super fresh one just for comparisons sake. Thanks very much Adam!"
"drinkability is good. a lot more dark fruit than you usually see in a brown, even an english one, but i suppose they call it a ""rustic dark ale", and i think it sort of fits that title more. seems to have a bit of a belgian/farmhouse flare to it. i like it."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, pretty smooth going down. A little plain for me and alright for an English brown but a little too much straight raisin. Not bad though, I could drink this. Thanks Russ!"

"D - Wish it had a little more malt - a little dry for my taste but a fine beer."
"OVERALL: A pretty good brew for sure. Calling this an English Brown Ale is a bit of a stretch; a Belgian Dark Ale would make more sense. Regardless, this was an enjoyable, drinkable brew that I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try out. Though I wouldn't seek it out again, I certainly wouldn't pass it up if I was offered. Good stuff. Thanks again for sharing Doopie!"
"Creamy and smooth drink. Fairly full body with a good amount of carbonation. Low ABV makes this very drinkable. Glad to have been able to try it."
"d: Thanks for this one Eric. I forget how big small beers can be sometimes."
"I like Saint Botolph's Town and I recommend it to the malt-bomb lovers out there."
"D: Pleasant surprise, and can easily finish the bomber."
"All said and done, I'm more curious about the history of the name and the label than the beer. But it's a Brown. What did we expect?"
"This beer is not sweet and malty all the way through, it ends with a hoppy twist and a hint of what they describe as ""eclectic yeast strains."" Definitely an interesting beer, and I would definitely drink it again particularly with a burger or steak or some other grilled meat."
"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy brown color ale with a huge medium brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of caramelized malt with notes of toffee and light residual sugar with light funky yeast notes. Taste is also a complex mix between some light funky yeast with heavy caramel malt with balanced residual sugar in the aftertaste - I don't know if it is the color or what else but I almost had the feeling of drinking a stout though I knew full well it wasn't. Body is quite full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very interesting beer with no real appurtenance to any style I know."
"M/D: Medium bodied, very smooth with nice carbonation. A very nice beer, my first in the style. Would certainly get this beer again, goes down easy."
"D= Pretty Drinkable would enjoy a bomber of this but would probably just drink one of these but then again this isn't my favorite style but really enjoyable."
"Thick and almost chewy mouthfeel for a sub 6% abv beer. Overall, another top notch beer from Pretty Things. Really wishing I didn't have to drive to Massachusetts just to buy their beer."
"So far my favorite from Pretty Things. A really nice dark brown malty colored brew. Smell of sweet malt and nuts. Flavor is very creamy and smooth. Little bit of brown sugar, hazelnuts and a hint of milk chocolate. A super creamy mix of malt and nuts. Yummy. A great example of the style. I could drink these all night!"
"Overall a tasty brown ale. Not an overly exciting style, but good in its simplicity."
"A solid English Brown Ale and among my favorite offerings from Pretty Things. Good beer."
"A bit high on carbonation, but it adds a nice near effervescent character that is well played. Incredibly drinkable. A great brown ale and one of the best I've had thus far. Very enjoyable."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer with flavor and substance making it worth drinking for a long time if you're in the mood for the style."
"D: Goes down very easy, very tasty, somewhat filling, nice kick and nice representation of style. This is a damn fine beer to enjoy for a while."
"D = Really a pleasing warmth to this ale. The pecan pie references make me want to come back for more. A real winner!"
"D- Pretty easy to drink. Nothing out of this world or crazy just plain old solid."
"D - Too syrupy to session this beer, but I can absolutely finish one bottle."
"Drinkability: Drinking a glass or two of this is easy. Putting this on my Christmas wish list is not going to happen."
"Overall this is a very solid brown ale, especially nowadays where I feel this category is skipped over/mailed in by many breweries. A little heavier in style, almost bordering on being a brown porter, but without the astringent qualities. This beer has nice layers of flavor with a rich creaminess that works wonderfully."
"The Saint Botolph's Town pours a deep cola brown color with a huge pillowy tan head that never goes away. Smells of sweet malts. Some chocolate and coffee come out as it warms. Also a nice nut aroma throughout. Taste is delicious. Plenty of roasted malts with hints of cocoa and hops. Quite refreshing as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with solid carbonation. Drinkability is spot on. Great tasting beer from a new brewery for me."
"Anyway, lots of nutty english ale flavors , a good amount of carbonation, and a light mouthfeel. All very good things for this style. Cocoa is not overpowering and doesnt need to be with a 'lighter' ale here at 5.9%. All things considered I would definitely get this again."
"Overall this is a solid choice - if you're going to drink a brown ale, this is the way to go. Full-bodied with excellent, hoppy attitude. Choice in all respects."
"This is very drinkable brown ale that I'm looking forward to having again."
"This is a delightfully complex beer. Earthy tones meld with cocoa powder, dark fruit sweetness, a hint of citrus hops in the finish, wood and nuts, hint of licorice. Biscuity malt, brown bread, almost as blend of brown ales and Belgian darks. Highly drinkable, smooth mouthfeel with just a prick of bubbles to kick it up a notch. Really the top tier in browns."
"D: Very drinkable. Actually sampled this one at my local store and enjoyed it enough to buy a bottle. Quite good, will definitely be finishing the bottle."
"D: Very easy drinking, and I look forward to trying some other offerings from Pretty Things. If they are as good as this one, I won't be let down! Abv is low as it should be, making this one a perfect beer for a chilly fall day."
"D - Definitely something thats great to sip on a chilly Autumn night. The rich, malty flavors made for a real treat, almost warming in fact. The bottle was easily finished. Another great from Pretty Things."
"Drinkability -- Pretty Things, pretty good! Tows the line between a traditional English Brown and a robust Baltic Porter with an extra boost of roast flavor. Very unique, very tasty. Definitely an above average brown."
"Drinkability: Very impressive take on the Brown Ale. I've been drinking a lot of this style lately and this is one of the better tasting ones. I will definitely pick up again and not hesitate at all."
"This is a pretty awesome beer. Has some stout-like qualities mixed in with the great brown ale qualities (the bottle calls it a ""rustic dark ale", which seems fitting). Complex and unique. I look forward to having it again."
"The feel of this beer is a bit medium bodied but never knocks you off balance. There is a nice even feel to this beer it seems to just go down so well."
"Overall: Brown ales are usually one of my least favorite styles of beer. They tend to be bland and somewhat boring. This beer from Pretty Things Beer and Ale Project changes all of that. This is a terrific beer with tons of amazing flavors and mouthfeel. I'm completely impressed with this beer and will seek out more asap. I highly reccomend trying this."
"a lot of caramel malt, hmm, just noticed some mold or something under the cap, great. doesnt seem to have any affect on it though. has a bitter finish... this is very dark for a brown ale, not bad though. not great, as there really isnt much here, roasty etc... but all seem a bit subdued. Not bad for a session."
"there is something wrong with this beer and i think is has to do with the hop choice: something harsh and even medicinal. makes for a weird tactile experience. you know, this thing is fading, but endures. it can be experienced as blackcurrant in the hops right up until the end, when it gets a little iffy. yet it is still only so offensive"
"medium-plus body with moderate carbonation (a lot heavier a body than i was expecting); a bit creamy. pretty drinkable, although i can see myself getting bored after a couple. all in all, a really respectable beer, especially in a style i don't necessarily seek out."
"As far as English brown ales go, this one is thick enough and loaded with enough flavor to remind one of a good complex porter. A thick, mouth-filling malty character takes over at the first sip, while the aftertaste and subsequent sips give way to the flavor of raisins and brown sugar, balanced by a mildly-bitter hop taste. A very nice sipper, especially around the fall season."
"Price = $7.99"
"D: it has alot going on for something that i thought would be simpler. so i would not want to sit and have more than one of these in a night but if i could drink one daily i would."
"More!"
"D,notes: A full robust, earthy brown ale from a top shelf brewery."
"D - I really am impressed with this one. Pretty Things makes some good stuff."
"It's certainly a drinkable beer. While I'm not rushing to track down another bottle, I'm glad that I had this one. I'll drink this again sometime, but now I'll search for some other beer from Pretty Things."
"D: Very good."
"Top notch brown ale. Pours dark brown, thick looking, with off-white head. Malty and some roast aromas. Very tasty malt job, supporting by light roast. Yeast is there and that taste builds up over a few samples. Very drinkable, made even more so by its sweetness. Recommended."
"D - Great drinkability. Complex enough, but enjoyable all the way."
"Pours a very pretty deep rich brown with red highlights. It's got some haze to it and really looks classic to the style. Really dark body yields a light brown fluffy 2finer head that is thick and rich. Really looks like a dubbel to me. Nice lacing. The aroma is very nice also with sweet malts, toffee, caramel and hazelnuts up front. A fruity ester takes over on the back end and lightens this beer up nicely. The taste is near perfect. Iconic to the style, this has the body of a Belgian dubbel and the flavors of a really nice American brown ale. Rich roasted malts, a touch of coffee and toasted almonds and hazlenuts on the palate. Has a real buttery finish that coats the palate nicely. Mouthfeel is very full bodied, a real food friendly beer. Nice on a cool night and will definitely be making another appearance in my fridge. Really love the the alcohol is restrained on this one. Would love to finish this bomber and maybe another by myself. Highly drinkable and worth seeking out."
"This was a very smooth beer, very drinkable. I wish I could find this in Maine."
"d - A decent brown ale. Would give another shot."
"D - Very smooth and very favorful. I was very pleased by this beer and am hoping to investigate more from Pretty Things."
"The bottle describes the brew as a rustic dark ale but their website describes it as a ""Yorkshire-inspired...big malty brown ale."" The beer pours a deep dark brown with a light tan head. The aroma is very malty and has some toasted notes. The beer is very easy to drink with a smooth mouthfeel and medium body. The malt character dominates the taste with toasted, sweet caramel and slightly burnt flavors."
"D-this is a tasty brew with great drinkability, not a lot happening and pretty singular...malts and more roasted malt."
"Pours a deep, rich brown with a pleasant, creamy head. Notes of toffee and caramel, but not cloying. Underlying hops contribute to a pleasant bitterness and surprisingly clean finish. I would not mind seeing the ABV increased a touch to give it a little more bite, which might also tame the malt just a touch more. Overall very good."
"It's delicious and superbly drinkable now, and perhaps a delicate tweak or two away form being masterful."
"Served cool in a 16oz pint glass. Hazy reddish brown in color with a very small tan head. Smell was of an English yeast strain and a hint of chocolate. Taste was velvety smooth toasted malt flavor, with a ripe fruit middle and finish. Hint of earthy hops in the finish. Mouthfeel was super rich and smooth, very low carbonation. Excellent drinkability, an excellent beer to have on cask, even though it was slighty cloudy with yeast."
"D-A solid offering whose body of work equals up to one mighty fine drinking brown ale. Plenty of flavour and a pleasant smoothness makes this one go down easy."
"Quite a tasty beer with plenty of character to offer the palate. Great traditional brew."
"D - Well rounded, fairly complex for the abv, and well balanced. Easily just found my new favorite brown ale."
"This has rapidly become one of my favorite beers. It has a powerful, but not overwhelming malty taste, and a very clean finish. There is not a lot of competition between hoppy and malty tastes, so each flavor can be savored separately. An extremely fine and drinkable beer."
"This is definitely a mashup, English brown + old ale, and it captures the hallmarks of either style perfectly. Stylistic nonsense aside, this is a well-envisioned recipe that is also brewed well, with a kind of voodoo magic that few can fathom. The flavors are intense and well-integrated, everything about this beer screams excellence to me."
"D - This was a very nice brown ale...definitely on the English side with all the malts and very little hops...the low ABV makes it sessionable and I liked the chocolate flavors as well as the balance of the beer"
"Poured a deep dark brown with a half finger of head that left good sticky lacing on the glass. Great roasted malt aromas with caramel, and nutty accents. There was also slight faint toffee and hop notes. The roasted malts dominate the flavor with a nice almond nutty accent and faint caramel , toffee, and slight hop character. The beer was medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a sweet nutty and slight hop bitter finish. This beer style reminds me of high school cause I use to drink lots of english brown ales. It still drank pretty good and took me back to the good old days. The beer did justice for the style."
"Drinkability was quite good. This is a tasty, well balanced brown ale with a rather intriguing flavor profile. It would likely pair well with most any pub fare."
"D: A very easy beer to drink. Before knowing the style, I thought it could have passed for an English Mild, and could easily drink this like it was."
"Bartender was very enthusiatic about this so I hated to let him down when I didn't find it to be so fantastic. Poured with a thick foamy frothy tan head and plenty of lace. Color was an opaque brown black. Aroma was very malty a bit roasty and a bit of sour. Flavor was the same. Tartness seemed inappropriate unless it woulda been a Flemmish brown. Body was good and ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor and I was noticing the tart more. Not a session."
"Drinkability-It's a bit too dark and bitter and it's flavors a tad too strong to be considered very drinkable, especially when compared to others of its style; it drinks slower than average, at least for me anyway."
"D: Fairly low ABV plus a pleasant mild taste makes it very drinkable. Given the opportunity, I would like to try this one on cask."
"This is a really good beer. It looks fantastic, but a little light on the aroma. The flavor is mild and well rounded. My only real complaint is the lingering dryness."
"M & D: very good"
"Full mouthfeel, a little tingly, finishes a bit tannic. Tasty and drinkable, good beer."
"EXCELLENT!"
"This is pretty complex for an english brown; it brings a ton to the table. I really enjoyed the flavor profile and mouthfeel. I will definitely seek this beer out again."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a dark brown with a small reddish tint. Head was a light caramel color that clung extremely well, but didn't last long at all. Aroma was of molasses and burnt sugar with small amouts of acidic bitterness. Taste was slightly sweet, rich vanilla flavor. Reminded me a burnt rye or other strong grain. Mellowed out very nicely. Coated well, a bit thin, and perhaps slightly overcarbonated, but not bad. A very drinkable beer. Needs a few minutes to mellow out and breathe before drinking."
"D - Bigger, bolder flavors then I'm used to with brown ale. Complex, but very drinkable; strength of flavors makes it a slower drink for me."
"DB- Great price for 22oz. Awesome brown ale flavors. I really like the blend of the flavors. The only flaw is the semi-weak aroma. Not a session beer (strong flavors) but a good one. Worth trying again on tap."
"Drinkability: A really surprising ale that covers a range of styles and is just gosh darn good"
"Poured into my Duvel tulip, Botoplph's pours a dark brown that turns ruby at the edges when held up to light. There's a large toffee head that leaves behind a good amount of lace. The smell is off bready malts and a hint of yeast spiciness that's very reminiscent of a belgian beer. This is a wonderfully complex beer, with some malty sweetness and the aforementioned spiciness that show up in the nose, as well as some earthy hop flavors lurking in the background. It's like a well done blend of a brown ale and a belgian strong dark ale. The carbonation is nice, stopping appropriately short of being prickly, but the body is a little thin, and I find myself wishing it was a little creamier. All in all though, a quality beer (as I've come to expect from Pretty Things) that's disappearing remarkably quickly from my glass."
"D: Very enjoyable. I love a nice <6% ale that delivers flavor. This is up there."
"This is a nice beer that, despite the poor attenuation, works quite well in a balance manner; there is an ample fruitiness here (a product of hop, malt and yeast), a rich rustic malt character and a supporting, though substantial hop character as well. Thoroughly enjoyable and one that I find quite easy to finish off a 22oz of while preparing dinner."
"Overall I was not impressed with this beer and would not recommend to try. By the way, I do like Brown Ales and have nothing against them, I just thought this was not a good representation of how good this style of beer can taste like."
"Overall a somewhat enjoyable beer, but not great. Drinkable at least."
"D- Nice and sessionable. This ale gave me an old school feeling."
"It's been awhile since I really explored English brown ale (offhand I remember liking Sam Smith and Smuttynose). I know that I didn't find any I liked as much as this one. Drinking it actually reminded me of the first time I tried Ayinger Celebrator. I recognized some of the flavors, and thought, ""This is emphatically NOT up my alley... but I love this beer."" An eye-opener to how certain flavors can work. Very well done."
"Pretty Things has impressed me so far, but this beer is merely average. Not sure why it's so highly rated -- maybe it needs to be fresher?"
"Started off as another regular Brown ale but as it warmed up it developed into a complex beer with all sorts of interesting yeasty notes and different tastes of caramel and nuts. Like most Pretty Things beers nothing is by the book and this is a most unique Brown Ale."
"Serving type: on-tap"
"Extremely enjoyable and easy to drink, I got through a bomber without a moments hesitation."
"Chocolate malt and suggestions of cherry and other red fruits. A lot of balance and pleasant flavors; can't really pick up anything harsh or unsatisfactory. Definitely has a chocolate milk lingering in the back of the throat. Very pleased with this brew!... Like every other Pretty Things brew."
"D: One of the better English Brown Ales I've tasted. At 5.9% ABV, this brew is dangerously quaffable, plus it is interesting enough to warrant a second and third pint."
"Taste starts out malty but then the hops take over and you are left with a very dry, roasted coffee end. Little to no carbonation. Medium thick mouthfeel with some malt and hops lingering in your mouth. Another really great beer by Pretty Things."
"From a 22 ouncer that was bottled Dec. 2009 and comes from Batch Four. Sampled on March 16, 2010. The pour is a handsome mahogany with ruby and pine hues thrown in for good measure. The light, puffy head is about three inches thick and it eventually simmers down. Nice clarity though. Right after I removed the cap I got this instant burst of fruitiness on the nose. Then when I began to pour it, the aroma segued into a toasted bready, creamy, yeasty, and neutral hopped balance. I was sold before I even tasted it. Fortunately the taste was just as endearing with a bold body and a sharp bitterness nut-like quality concluding with a pleasant dry hop finale. This beer really hit all the pressure points in a good way and is highly recommended."
"D: Overall, this was a very nice beer. I split the 22 oz bottle three ways, but wish I had not. It was just right for this 60 degree afternoon with spring right on the horizon."
"A very solid brown ale, bordering on being a brown porter. Nice layers of flavors throughout, rich creaminess works wonderfully with everything. Most brown ales i find are one noted and fairly thin on the mouthfeel, this is not one of those beers. Another solid effort from Pretty Things."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sugary, semi sweet, flowery, and slick in the finish."
"Mellow yet with unexpected depth, this is a pleasant example of the style."
"Looks nice, light brown cap of fine bubbles capping a chestnut brown beer. Malty aroma, roasty and nutty, dry cocoa, light notes of dried fruit and spice. Moderate bitterness throughout, really giving some balance to the brown sugar and milk chocolate sweetness up front. More of a caramel and bittersweet chocolate flavour towards the finish with a fair bit of clove spiciness hidden behind the malts. Less roast and fruit in the flavour, but they're there. Smooth texture, carbonation was a little rough to start but mellowed as the beer warmed. Medium to full bodied. Quite enjoyable."
"Drinkability is quite nice, flavor keeps you coming back, and only the lingering bitterness strings it out some. Tasty either way."
"Very dark, deep brown with a retentive, pillowy tan head. Aroma is very nice for a brown, dark fruits, roasted malt, mild hops, some clove spiciness, all nicely balanced. Rich, full body for a brown, malty, dark fruit, hops in the finish and some surprising chocolate/coffee roast flavors mix in too. Another interesting, slightly different take on a familiar style from Pretty Things. I still haven't found one I'm crazy about, but I'll keep on trying any new ones I come across."
"Pours a nice chestnut brown color, off white head leaving decent lacing. Smell is of roasted grain and nuts with a presence of dark dried fruit (plum and raisin), carmel and a lsight herbal quality. Taste is an exception blend of roasted grain, roasted nuts, crust bread and dried dark fruit a nice carmely sweet backbone. Does not approach bitter as many in the style do. Nice medium body with perfect carbonation for the style. A great, finely crafted English brown with lots of flavor and charachter."
"Pours a milk chocolate brown color with a big pillowy tan head that slowly dissipates. The aroma is of a musty malt with some chocolate and caramel notes. Brown sugar adds some sweetness to the aroma which is followed by a lemony citrus twang. The first sip is lightly roasty and woody, almost like a schwarzbier. This is followed by a sweet brown sugar flavor and a dry bitter hop. In the end the malt comes back out reminding you that this is indeed an english brown ale. It has that dry/lemony malt that I find in a lot of english ales. The feel is light to moderate with tingly to soft carbonation, finishes slightly dry and bitter. A good english brown ale, nice flavor profile. Not the best one that I have tried but still quite good."
"Yet another great beer from The Pretty Things."
"Pours kind of murky, cloudy, and very thick bodied. Initial smell is of roasted nuts, caramel, and some maltiness or coffee. Taste is definitely roasted but not overdone, the coffee flavor comes out and an aftertaste of something like sambuca or black licorice with hints of earthiness. Adds to its complexity as it goes down and warms. Can definitely taste the yeast combo used which adds to the flavor. Rather creamy and smooth as befits its ABV."
"Coffee and toffee up front, cereal, toast and carob. Very roasty, almost burnt in a subtle and pleasant way. Hints of leafy hops and minerals. Carbonation is a bit too high for the style, which makes the body seem a tad thin. The yeast profile is unusually prominent, giving the beer a fruity undertone. Finishes lightly hoppy and roasty with a big coffee kick and a faint mineral aftertaste."
"It's a tasty beer no doubt and I would say is a more complex version of Dogfish Head IBA. Very good beer."
"St. Botolph's Town is a good beer, and interesting at that. Clearly a unique brown ale, and if you like this sort of thing, well worth your time."
"Saint Botolph's Town may not be the best English brown ale to have entered my glass... on second thought, it might be. It's definitely the most interesting. This is a brewery to keep an eye on. Make that two eyes. And a nose. And a tongue."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice dark brown color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy two-finger light tan head, with some awesome thick/creamy sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, nice little touch of dark fruits, light toffee note, caramel. The taste is awesome sweet, malty, with a nice touch of dark fruits, toffee/caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this brew really surprised me, an awesome EBA. Thanks John!"
"It is a great drinking brew easy to finish and I was left wanting for more"
"Drinkability: I had tried this first on tap at a local homebrew shop and liked it. After picking up a bottle, rather dissapointed I didn't get a second at the same time."
"Every beer from Pretty Things is a good one, so far. They manage to be subtle and versatile in way that few other American breweries can manage. Definitely worth your attention."
"Overall a decent beer- a bit sweet but tasty."
"Overall, I'm impressed with this ale. Definitely looking forward to picking up a few more bottles next time I head to Whole Foods for lunch."
"Overall really a superb, superb offering here, not really sure how to classify it totally, but superb,"
" simply, this is a crazy, messy but complex brown ale."
"D: Suprisingly refreshing, Has a balanced flavor of sweet and light bitterness, but at the same time is clean tasting and goes down really easy."
"M/D - Light to medium bodied. Very lively carbonation. Very easy drinking. Nothing spectacular in the taste, but a very solid beer."
"Balance is seen across the board here, event the level of charred grain is perfect. Not massive or in your face yet this is of demi-epic material. Love it."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, what a great beer. Bomber is the perfect size, as you are glad there is more to come after the pint is drained. Will be trying more from these folks."
"Overall, this is a good beer. Not sure I've ever had one that was so all over the board, a bit tough to drink for the style, but heavenly on the nose. Very odd. But leaves me happy."
"D: What an excellent Brown Ale. It truly was hard for me to put this beer down once I started drinking it. Excellent balance between dry, bitter, spicy, fruity, and whatever else you choose to draw out of this one. I'm officially hooked on Pretty Things beer!"
"M&D - light to medium bodied, with a nice shifting complex flavor, a very nice beer, this PTBAP is brewing some impressive beers, cant wait for them to expand into their own place so they can experiment."
"Not typically a style I go after but I'm glad to have sampled this offering from Pretty Things. As far as an English Brown Ale goes, it does well. Not sure I'd actively search this one out, but I did enjoy it and would recommend it to those who enjoy a good brown ale."
"Seems to be more of a stand alone ale or desert beer to me. I can't imagine what I would pair this with. Pretty things is an understatement - this beer is gorgeous!"
"Bomber from Batch 2 (April '09). Pours dark, slightly cloudy mahogany with a huge, creamy head. Great lacing. Dark roasted malt on the nose with chocolate. Light molasses. Tastes more impressive than it smells. Toasty malt and chocolate again. A slight bit of dark fruit. Very dry finish with slight astringency. Fairly full body. Very nice brown ale over all."
"My least favorite of their beers, due in part to the fact that brown ales are not one of my favorites. If you like the style, you are going to really like this one."
"A beer for Boston, ya gotta love that. I also love the fact that Pretty Things' beers can change drastically between batches, so that it is almost like you are drinking a new beer with every release. This is batch #3, brewed last month. Pours a very dark brown color. Not close to black, but as dark as brown gets. Big and creamy tanned heading with some staying potential in the appearance. In the nose, one gets some caramel, cocoa powder, freshly baked bread, and many other interesting complexities. Sweet brown bread with powdered sugar comes to mind first in the aroma, followed by Christmas pudding and all sorts of spiced cookies. Overall much sweeter than previous batches. About medium to heavy, and it feels much larger than it is. Alcohol is virtually untraceable, which is a little disappointing for me only because that was one of the qualities I really liked in the older versions. Overall this is a bad ass brown that is on the threshold of the porter style. It has lost some of the rustic qualities from other batches, but this is still really well crafted, and a brew that they should serve at all Boston pubs. Not just for the nod to Boston, but for the overall quality. Cheers"
"Botolph has a dark brown body that does not quite make it to black. A small dark tan head stuck around for a few minutes before capping, leaving some sticky lace. The smell consists of dark roasted malts, brown sugar and some old coffee. The taste is huge on the malts with alot of nuttiness. Some coffee with a nice amount of hops to round it out. The feel could of been a tad fuller as I found this to be a bit light/watery. The carb was not so high also. I enjoyed my glass and drank it in no time, but im not a big fan of nutty brown ales so this will do for me."
"I'm thinking this would be a great beer for a rainy cold New England fall afternoon. Now we just need them to brew another batch."
"Typical Pretty Things arty and neat-o presentation, with the thin label strip over the cap, ""Bottled April 2009 Batch two"" Pours darker amber, medium brown, robust and retentive light mocha head, then thick film, a mottled ringed collar and finally respectable lace. Nose is yeasty and bready, with sweet malt notes just below the surface. Chocolaty brown. Sweet malt, powdered sugar, dusty dark chocolate, toffee, all come to mind. Creamy and luxorious mouthfeel, smooth as can be all the way to the finish. Very tasty and pleasurable brown ale. More quality and quite ""artisanal"" suds from the PT beer and ale project."
"D: Very easy drinking and the bomber went down way to fast. There is nothing bad about this beer, but there is also nothing memorable."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and somewhat flat."
"Woody campfire hop compliments a black chai bitter twang. Brown sugar and light roast esspresso fade. Rich and creamy this beer is incredibly complex and flavorul for %5.7 abv."
"Drinks alright, the coffee accents cost it points in drinkability & flavor"
"D - Great representation of the English brown ale style. They really nailed it with a great nutty taste."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" light brown head over the slightly cloudy reddish brown brew. Frothy head recedes slowly, with heavy coating lace. Aroma is sweet and lightly chocolatey. Taste is rich grain character from beginning to end, overwritten with nutty chocolate and complementary hops. Mouthfeel is soft, smooth, low carbonation in a good way, with drinkability oh-so easy. Let it warm a touch out of the fridge, and you've pretty much got a cask-like experience. Yay!"
"The mouthfeel exhibited within St. Botolph's Town features the same top quality all other aspects of the beer carries. Pretty Things crafted this brown ale nicely and ensured that the mouthfeel fell somewhere a little bit more robust than most brown ales but not as heavy as say a smoked porter or a stout. There is a really whole beer mouthfeel to this ale in the sense that what you can tell just by the mouthfeel alone is that the entire bottle and all that has gone into making this ale is nothing short of brilliant."
"this beer pours a dark brown with red highlights that support he tan head beautifully. the aroma is caramely malt all the way. i'm wondering if the color and aroma was from the grain or carmalization in an extended boil. very tasty either way. the sweet tasty malt flavor works well with the roasted malt astringency. the medium body and good co2 make this a really drinkable brown."
"The beer pours a nice dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful chocolate and roasted malt scent along with a dry nutty feel. The taste is good. It has a nice dry roasted feel with a light crystal malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average brown, but nothing too special."
"The taste is quite good and surprisingly mild given the nose on the beer. The beer is sweet, a touch cloying so, there are definite molasses notes, caramel notes, some brown sugars, some dark chocolate notes, some raisin flavors, some spices maybe a touch in the coriander family. This is a substantial brown ale, very nice, not too carbonated, medium bodied, reasonably complex. Worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"D - A very well-crafted brown ale. Nice balance, with no one element coming to the fore and overshadowing the others. I would love this brew with BBQ - beef brisket or spicy pulled lamb with this brew would make you very happy."
"D: Very drinkable. I've tried the entire line since the ACBF. They are a solid brewery."
"Reviewed on 06/04/2009. Bottle at PPRBSG09. This beer pours a cloudy brown. It has an aroma of indistinct sweet malt. The flavor is of super sweet caramel malt. I found it to be pretty bland, overall and much too sweet for me (like many poorly made brown ales...)."
"The feel is smooth at first, then dry, earthy and ashy on the back end. It's a decent dark ale. Sugary, sweet and grainily dark."
"i find the brew to be very enjoyable and ease to drink, full smooth flavor ease on the palate ."
"It's a rustic dark session ale. It borders on so many styles without deciding to choose any one style. Not my favorite of Dann's new beers, but a killer session beer for sure."
"Picked up a bottle from Abe's Cold Beer after enjoying their saison. This beer, unfortunately, is less impressive. I suppose it's a little rustic in the sense that the malts have an earthy, dry bitter taste that's certainly not unpleasant. Still, this beer just seems to linger between and brown ale and a porter for the dry roasted malt that consumes the aftertaste. The aroma has more of a candy dark chocolate character, but the flavor and feel is very dry. I guess that aspect is more Belgian. Still, a pretty tasty beer, I'm just not sure what's going on."
"An excellent beer, I came back to this after a few months and found it to hold up to my lofty expectations and hazy memory. Well worth seeking out."
"This is an Brown Ale with some balls. I am not talking extreme, just a bigger beer with loads of flavor yet still remains easy to drink. A pleasure."
"1136"
"Pours a rich medium brown, like a typical nutty brown ale. Huge head billows up with a flourish of bubbles. Great retention, and leaves some intricate lacing. Has kind of a belgian yeasty smell to it, and the sweet aroma of slightly darkened malts along with molasses. Bit of toffee as well. Taste... this is a flavorful yet mellow sessionable brown. A bit of toasted toffee, some nuttiness, a bit of coffee. Some more flavours as it opens up a bit, I noticed something fruity in there as well. Maybe some burnt caramel. Nice gravitas, filling and bready, goes quite well with dinner tonight (sirloin tips). On the heavier side of medium body while lacking the density of a porter or stout. Nice and drinkable, but had a bit of funkiness at first. I hope Pretty Things becomes a New England staple, Dann deserves it."
"Overall: Really good drinkability, nice roasty flavors, and a nice moutfeel. This beer has some really nice subtle flavors."
"22 oz bottle says it is the first batch!"
"22oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Bottled April 2009 Batch Two indicated on a paper swatch covering the cap. Poured a murky chestnust color with very little light penetration. One inch, tight, frothy off-white head with good retention, eventually settles into a thin, consistent cap. Some thick stands of lacing coat the glass during the session. Nose is malty and suggests dark fruit, perhaps prunes, and maybe a little cocoa. Taste consistent with nose, but some roasted coffee flavors also come out and a kiss of hops is revealed at the finish. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a nice, consistent level of background carbonation. Nice English Brown with a decent amount of complexity, particularly in terms of the abv. Too bad it's not available in sixers; it would make a great session brown."
"Oh the glee when I saw this....First Batch! ...Dan Paquette brew!...St. Botolph (aka Boston...like the great label depicts- well from the colonial period)...Nice big bottle that poured an unfiltered opaque, hazy ruddy-brown, leaving a thin whitish head for a short bit. An aroma full of wet grasses, dry grains, sour fermenting and lemon peel. The aroma had a bit more of a nutty malt to it and a nice mildly sour rustic farm ale taste, hearty and full of denseness. I really should've brought out the stein for this one...now, to find it on draught!"
"Pours a cloudy dark brown with ruby highlights and a big bubbly head that sticks around for a bit before sticking itself to the glass. Smells of chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and sweet malts. Tastes is sweet malts with lots of brown sugar and chocolate. has a hint of spicy yeast in there as well. Crisp carbonation, medium body, light syrupy mouthfeel. Great little session brown, I wish they put this in a six pack I'd buy it all the time."
"Enjoyed on tap at Vee Vee where I believe it has a permanent home."
"Pours a one finger light tan head that fades very slowly leaving some lace. Deep cloudy amber color, some yeast settles out. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Earthy nose. Flavor is a strange grainy coffee, some sweetness. Burnt coffee finish. $6.45 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"This is solid, but not outstanding, brown ale."
"Dense, yet a fluffy tan head rests on the surface for a good long time. Rather hoppy aroma with some citrus and flowers, with malt in the background. The taste was overall rather unbalanced-- rather, perhaps it was *too* balanced. There was no differentiating between the malt and the hops for me, so there was no real flavor one way or the other. It was just beer. I expected something malty and instead got something... not so malty, but not so hoppy, either. Worth a try, especially if you live in MA and want to support your local brewery. I preferred the PT saison over this one."
"Sorry, I hope chapter 3 of the Pretty Things book is a ore enjoyable one."
"Another successful offering from Pretty Things, that makes 2 for 2 thus far."
"This brew has a good, malt profile and sweetness. The malts are balanced by a good roasted component that still leaves a nice lingering sweetness in the finish."
"This is an easy drinking, tasty brown ale. I'm a sucker for a brown ale with some character and this has it. I'd certainly have this again. Pretty Things is now 2 for 2 in my book."
"it's got a nice drinkability to it. plenty of interesting things going on, but mellow, refreshing and very approachable. an excellent beer, and i'm not even a huge fan of the style. i'm officially really looking forward to the next release from pretty things."
"Nice one. On cask would be a treat."
"I'd love to try this in a flight of Browns; I think it would fare well."
"Overall a good brown ale or old ale. Complex, but not necessarily memorable."
"D: A very drinkable beer. Very hard to catagorize, but definitely one to toss into the mix when it comes to beer, wine and cheese parties!"
"Drinkability: A very good and interesting beer which i will have again. Not as tasty as some English browns I have had, but it is a winner."
"Mouthfeel is good, and this beer is pretty drinkable. Another quality beer from Pretty Things that will keep me picking up their offerings in the future."
"again, you need to know the intentions behind the brew. it's not really meant to be a ""typical"" english brown. dann paquette actually said that this uses an altbier yeast and is finished with a relatively ""neutral"" belgian strain. this would certainly explain the fruit and spice characters."
"D: Very inviting and drinkable. I imagine as a session beer different notes and subtleties would come out."
"This drinks pretty well for the flavor profile; another well-constructed effort from the gentlemen in Holyoke."
"Picked up a bomber at the Bauer tasting for $5.99. Poured into a stemmed glass. Huge, creamy tan head. Very dark brown in color. Slight carbonation on the edges of the glass. Smelled like a whiff of cocoa powder. Taste was quite pleasant, but mild. There was quite a lot of malt, with a nice flavor of chocolate biscuits. Flavors did not stand out immensely, but I can see how that would help to make this a very drinkable beer. Did not really notice the abv. After hearing what Mr. Paquette had to say this evening, I can really see his British brewing style influenced here, as well as his idea to brew an old-school style, historical Boston-inspired brew."
