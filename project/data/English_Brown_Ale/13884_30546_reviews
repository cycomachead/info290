"Dark brown pour with thin tan head, color is excellent. Smell is mild malt and slightly nutty. Taste is also a bit underwhelming with a sweetness that quickly fades to a clean nut finish. Only real nit is it seems a bit overcarbonated. Otherwise very drinkable in quantity!"

"It's crisp all the way and moderately smooth in a dry medium body.  It thins a little into the finish."

"What an extremely accurate name. Its nutty, but the aftertaste is a bit sweet, almost like a hint of honey, making it a perfect complement for some fiery wings or even some of the sweeter flavors of wings available at some pubs. Carbonation is a bit higher than average, but its pretty well balanced with the taste. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth, before I even finished my first bottle I was thinking about picking up another."

"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice amber color and it smelled really good. I had high hopes for the beer. The beer had a nice bready smell however the taste was just not there. Watery weak coffee hit. Lacing was good but that's about all the good I can give it. No nut did I get!. I will not buy this beer again."
""
""
"Overall this is an average beer that taste OK, with nothing that really stands out to make me want to buy it again."
""
"My favorite out of the 12 pack sampler that I purchased. I always saw Peak Organic on the shelf but was never inclined to throw it in the shopping cart. With my budget a little tighter now than years past, I tend to search out reasonably priced twelve packs instead of pricey six packs. Peak Organic is a great tasting beer at a reasonable price. I would definitely purchase again although I just snagged the Magic Hat Summer Scene sampler for a little variety."

"Another offering from this brewer that implies lazy shortcuts and a dumbed down target audience. The nuttiness of the title is just too understated, and the whole affair is altogether restrained, too afraid of putting it all out there for the world to see, becoming nothing more than a mote in the proverbial dust in the wind."
""
"Just weak, pass on this one."

"O: I haven't had this beer in years, but this is not at all what I remember. It's oddly hoppy and bitter, with what tastes like a strong noble hop presence. This hop presence is at odds with the buttery house ringwood taste. But the biggest problem is that it's desperately in need of a beefed-up malt bill. There just isn't enough backbone to hold everything together."
""
"Overall this a tasty one and probably my favorite in the mix pack I got. Could use some more body but it is one you can sip on all afternoon."
"This is a poor example of Nut Brown Ale. It is watery, flat and has no body. It is very similar to Trout River Scottish Ale which is the worst dish water (not worthy of being called a beer) known to man. At $10.00 @ six pack, I can think of a whole bunch of better ways to use 10 bucks. The take away here is that there is a lot of room to start a micro brewery because this sucks!. This is lousy and there are better ways to make a quality beer."

"O- I think the only drawback to this beer is that there's nothing overly exciting or impressive about it. That being said, it's a decent session ale and one of the better organic offerings I've had."
""
""
""
"This beer poured a relatively light brown shade, a bit translucent, its head was there and then it was gone. It did not over power you with its scent but there were some nutty, burnt brown sugar notes, just not many. Taste was solid. Again, nothing overwhelming here, but some coffee and some dry bitter sweetness can be detected. Mouthfeel was on the dry side, it did not leave any lingering aftertaste either. Overall, this is a solid English Brown, and can be easily drunk."
""
""
""
"Overall: actually a pretty tasty and successful nut brown ale. I'd have this again."
""
""
""
"Overall - Perhaps a little too bitter to be really sessionable, but still pretty tasty. I won't rush out to get more but I'm glad I gave it a shot."

"This is a decent beer, but it's a bit dry which effects the flavor and the drinkability. For those getting into the style or are new to craft beer, this would be a good offering."

"Another beer from Peak that does nothing in particular special other than having been competently made and ""organic."""
""
""
"O: A decent beer, not great. It has some good flavors that just come through as being rather muted. I wish the maltiness was more potent."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a decent enough beer but not very exciting."
""
""
""

"Peak Organic Nut Brown Ale is a clear, sparkling copper ale with a lumpy beige head that has outstanding retention and lacing. The aroma is mostly sweet malt and caramel with a sharp grassy note. It's medium bodied and foamy with a very dry, slightly abrasive finish. There really isn't much flavor. There is a little malt that's almost sweet and a hint of bitterness at the finish. The aftertaste is nutty and chocolatey. It's not a very exciting beer, but not unpleasant at all."
""
"O: The beer is very sessionable and goes down very easily. I would have no problem having a few of these in one sitting."
"I would only drink another if all other choices were Bud or something of the same ilk."
""
""
"A dark brown color with slightly yellowed edges with a decent egg shell colored head and speckled lacing. The aroma is a malty, nutty vanilla and thick brown bread. Much stronger than expected and pretty good. The taste offers thin charcoal molasses with raisin brown bread and pear. I pick up some sour fruit as well. It’s on the acqueous side, light to medium bodied with very fine carbonation. This is a somewhat gutsy brown ale while being plenty drinkable. I’ve grown a bit weary of this style as a general rule, but this wasn’t bad."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a dark auburn-brown coloring, vibrant and crisp, with no head. Aromas are rich and bready, with strong caramel, nut, and molasses characteristics. Very inviting nose. Flavors are roasty, with nut and toffee profiles, and a hint of dark roast coffee. The body is very light and crisp, with a hazelnut flavor creeping in. Good, clean, crisp finish. Very easy to drink, and very tasty."

"I cannot stress enough how much I love Peak Organic beer. Expect to see many more of their beers on Active Beer Geek for they are worth their weight in gold!"
""
"O: decent for the style, but I actually liked this enough to probably have it again"
""
"I like this one. It's a solid brown ale. Peak Organic continues to win me over.."
"Overall - a very forgetful nut brown ale, but easy to drink and pleasant. Nothing bad to say about it..just forgetable."
"Really disappointed with this beer. Had it on tap at Kinsale in Boston. Thought the appearance was pretty watery, though the mouthfeel wasn't as much so. In terms of taste, it was a pretty run of the mill nut brown: malty, caramel notes, definite nuttiness, little bit of toffee. However, the killer for me was the aftertaste. I just couldn't shake a horrible lingering of cigar/cigarette smoke in the aftertaste. Had my gf try the beer, and she didn't notice it as much. But I couldn't get past it...every sip. Pretty much ruined the beer for me. I'd probably prefer Newcastle to this..."
"Medium body. Excellent carbonation. Semi-dry finish."
"O: a good brown ale. nice, middle of the road."
"D: Strange brew smells and looks like a brown, the first shot is brown and then everything just shuts down. A little disappointing."
"brown in color with a huge tan head Seriously this had to have looked better then damn near anything else I have run across recently Aroma is dark fruits, lots of sweet brown sugary notes, hints of clove and light earthy hops, all mixing together nearly perfectly at this point in time. Nice smooth, even carbonation and feel here now as well, really well placed I have to admit. Rich warm flavor here, nice mix of pear, light spice, hints at brown sugar and a nice even caramel flavored dry finish."
"Overall: Very refreshing and the nutty finish made me crave more. This beer has a better aroma that Newcastle Brown Ale, but I was pretty disappointed in the head."
"O-Its a solid but unspectacular beer. If I'm in the mood for a brown, there are others I'd rather have."
"D - A perfectly decent brown ale, I have no objections and can't really come up with any suggestions to improve the beer. It is kind of a hard style to review, but this has as much depth as any other brown ale that I have had with multiple shades of brown malt and just enough hops to keep it balanced and drinkable."
"Grabbed a bottle at EuroMarket along with all my weird Eastern European beers. There was a big nutty cocoa aroma and flavor. Sort of a session-strength dessert beer. I like it. There's malty caramel in the background with just a hint of citrus hops that carry through the finish. The body is a little light and oddly acidic, but it's nearly full enough without approaching heavy. You could certainly enjoy a few bottles after dinner."
"O- Very good beer with just enough complexity not to distract the drinker from its pleasures. Great for drinking on a warm late spring day."
"Nothing bad all all, but quite mellow and lacking in any robust flavors. Really doesn't taste much like a brown ale."
"O: I want to like this, but it just misses the mark. If you blindfolded me and told me this was an American amber craft lager, I wouldn't doubt you at all."
"DB- One of the lightest Brown Ales I can think of. The flavor feels a bit diluted or something."
"Appears more of deep amber than an actual brown color. Head billows with chunk cream colored lacing, left clinging to the sides of my imperial pint after each sip. Aroma has some cereal grain sweetness roasted malts are evident, with a hint of toasted nuts hanging around. No real hop accents just a hint of underlying earthiness coming through. Flavors are light restrained, some caramel malt/darker earthiness with cereal grains and a but of husk character. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, moderate carbonation levels, the Peak Organic brews as a whole have confused me. Twist off bottles, certified organic decent beer overall just nothing awe inspiring that's never been done before. There's no point in drinking this except if you really want organic, even though the hops probably aren't actually organic."
"Verdict: I'm not incredibly knowledgeable about brown ales (yet) but this one is acceptable on several levels. The taste is lightly roasted with flavor. The mouthfeel sticky & dry. The appearance was also pretty good. This beer did a pretty good job at impressing me. It's a worthy drink, especially in the limited range of the organic beer department. B (3.6)"
"D: I enjoyed this brown ale, the sweet smell. Mild, could have several in a row."
"D - One of the more drinkable Brown ales I had. Hops were nice and flavor was natural and creamy. Overall a great brown ale that is mighty tasty."
"D: a decent beer overall, but the hop flavor is a tad high for the style. It seems as though there was an unnecessary hop addition around the middle of the boil that gave this way too much emphasis on the hop flavor. Overall, not bad, but the recipe needs tweaking."
"Drinkability- 	Great brew! Has a complex, evolving taste that makes the nuttiness of the beer a subtle flavor to search for rather than one that smacks you in the mouth. I would buy a few of these."
"D: Very..I really enjoyed this beer. I could see having a few of these and not feeling too full. Goes down very smooth, no real aftertaste."
"O: Very non-offensive. Plus side of the thin mouth feel is that it isn't a meal in a bottle."
"Overall I enjoyed this brew and thought it a great representation of the nut brown style. It warms the body from the first sight of the color after it is poured to the last drop gliding across the tongue."
"Drinkability: A nice beer- nothing outstanding, but very solid. Tasty and highly sessionable."
"D: inviting for repeats"
"Overall-Ignoring the politics, this is well done. Another keeper, not outstanding but holds up to other versions of the style. I find the flavor similar to Troegs Nut Brown Ale, a nice beer to be similar too."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, 12 oz. bottle. This beer treads a very fine line between amber and brown in my opinion, especially when held up to the light When you do so it has nothing to hide with excellent clarity. In the initial pour there is a light off-white creamy colored head that slowly fades throughout the session, small amounts of lace slowly tread and trickle back to the liquid after each sip. The smell is good, like most in this style it's well malted, slight hints of toffee, hops make themselves known but don't exactly jump out at you, some slight herbal tea aromas as well. Tastes better than it smells. Again well malted possibly some chocolate malts here. I think there are certainly some blended malts here, both roasted and smoked, possibly peat but as strong as it tends to be. Like English Browns the malts outweigh the hops but hops are present and provide a good combination of all the flavors, burps up nice too. The mouthfeel is good, slightly lighter than I expected, but still good. I find some of this style to be a little buttery at times but this one is mostly clean, well certainly finishes that way. Drinkablility is good."
"Overall this is an easy-drinking brown but it's just not robust enough to make it above average."
"M/D: Medium body, appropriate carbonation, dry finish. Fairly drinkable. Pretty unremarkable, nothing great. Not much to say about it. A bit of a let-down compared to other Peak brews I've had."
"D- I liked it but at $8.50 a 6 pack or $34.00 a case it will remain just a brew that I tried, to add another one to my reviews and to broaden my beer horizons."
"One of the lightest nut brown ales I can recall, but still very tasty and highly drinkable. It's not the most exciting beer, but it was very easy to drink and quite enjoyable."
"D: Overall it doesn't really live up to a ""nut brown ale."" This isn't a bad brew by any means, it just shouldn't bill itself as something it is not."
"Certainly passable; easy to drink and, without a doubt, an easy session beer. But there's no wow here, nothing to set it apart from other Brown Ales, besides the fact that it's organic. Pair this one with a nutty Canadian cheddar on herbed water crackers, or baste a free range chicken and root vegetables."
"Pours a pretty clear coppery-mahogany with an average light beige head. Aroma is yeasty and malty with a hint of brown sugar. Flavor is strongly yeasty, perhaps too yeasty, with a bitter overtone and a malty undertone, OK if no great shakes. Texture is fairly smooth, a little tingly, maybe a bit on the thin side, and leaves a slightly tinny but not unpleasant aftertaste."
"4 across the board. good beer."
"This beer is typical brown with with a dark amber color. It starts with a good white head and lacing. the aroma is slightly malty with hints of chocolate. The taste starts with a sweet maltyness and ends with a slight chocolaty maltyness. This is a very drinkable beer, I wanted more nuttyness as the name indicated. I want to try this beer on draft as their reviews seem to be much better."
"D: A nice, approachable brown ale. A sessionable, easy drinker. Sometimes it's nice having a basic option like this. Brown ales are a somewhat forgotten and neglected bunch, but this is worthwhile."
"D- Because of the flavor I only got a couple of sips into this one before it went down the drain. Given the other reviews, I'm chalking this one up to a bad batch and I'll pick up another to review again."
"Value: I paid $1.59 for a single at Whole Foods. Not bad, not bad."
"Great Nut Brown, very drinkable - having to drive home prevented me from doubling up."
"Pours a coppery brown color with a moderate off white head. Moderate lacing. Smell is of carmel and lightly roasted nuts, also a noticeable hop presence. Taste is somewhat mild blend of carmel, lightly roasted nuts, butter with a op background. Medium bodied, slightly undercarbonated. Decent beer, does nothing wrong, but lacks punch."
"Review from notes taken on: 10/11/09."
"Pours a clear brown with a small tan head. Smells of warm, buttered toast. The flavors are initially bitter - a woody, earthy bitterness - that gives way to a very pleasant, sweet finish. This is not the most complex beer in its genre but enjoyable nonetheless."
"D: Overall, quite mild for a brown ale. Their amber ale is more intense than this, but the brown is still very drinkable and enjoyable."
"Drinkability: Not a bad lil' brown, really, and one I could cheerfully consume a lot of."
"On the plus side, it was very easy to drink and would probably be a good session beer. It kind of reminded me of a ""good"" beer you would drink in college, but when you go back to try it again, it isn't anything special."
"This poured a brown (SRM22) clear with a persistent light tan head supported by a moderate carbonation. Very sweet malty aroma with little hops noted. Malty brown sugar/toffee flavor that is sweet without being cloying and a low hop bitterness. moderate body and a clean finish. Very drinkable."
"D: A pretty mild English brown that would be sessionable for the organic fan. I prefer Wolaver's to this, but it's not all that bad. Hopefully a better taste comes from the bottle. I'd like to give it another shot sometime."
"T- Crisp, almost...watery, which is probably a sin for a beer. But it's a decent flavor. It's just tastes too ""clean"" for a beer. Slight smokeyness to it. Malt in the back of the mouth."
"A good beer if you like the style. I've been eager to try an organic beer but wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleased, but not blown away."
"A very good brown ale in my opinion, very classic. Recommended."
"D) A decent brown but not a standout."
"The taste is not bad. There is nuttiness to it, and a sort of burnt sweet aftertaste that turns ashen over time. On the other hand, it also seems actually chemically imbalanced. It has a sort of soapy feeling, that leaves my lips and throat feeling parched and scratchy rather than simply dry. I found this increasingly distracting as I finished my glass. I would not seek out another."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, there are several other beers in the style that I would drink first."
"The aroma is toasted with some chocolate, nuts, malt, and vinegar. The appearance is medium red brown with a small head. The flavor is like the aroma and not to my liking. The palate is smooth but the finish is acidic and astringent. It is like sucking on a bar of soap. Overall it's not even average."
"Red/brown color with a medium-sized white head that left a bit of lacing. Caramel malt aroma, some nuttiness also. The taste was not as strong as the aroma suggested. Caramel and hazlenut, but in a muted way. A little bit of hops. I would say medium-bodied. An OK beer."
"D: I would seek out another brown ale as there are many better exmaples."
"The beer pours a nice deep chestnut brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a caramel and dark malts, slight nuttiness to the nose as well. The taste is of a solid malt base with a nice nutty flavor. It goes down easy and finishes a bit dry with some malty notes. The mouthfeel is great as well. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. The beer is a solid feeling without being filling. This is a good drinking beer. This is the first organic beer that I have tried, and am impressed thusfar."
"Anyways, that rant aside this brew came off as a decent enough brown ale. The coffee aftertaste that comes in brown ales is usually what turns me off. I think in this brew the coffee taste isn't so bad, sort of muted by a decent mouthfeel. I would drink this again. Aside from that I don't see much else to add, I mean everything else is there in this ale, really standard, no frills, no special features."
"D- A decent brew, but I don't think I would want to drink more than one bottle in a sitting."
"Drinkability improves as it warms."
"Pours a nice chestnut color with almost ruby-like highlights, decent sized foamy tan head dissipates slowly, leaves a few patches of lacing on the glass. Big caramel nose on this beer, some faint cocoa powder. Flavors are pretty robust, chocolatey, brown bread, faint coffee. Medium-bodied with some busy little bubbles. This is tasty, easy-to-drink, and a no-brainer at the dinner table. Good stuff!"
"D: Great start, with looks and smell, but once I really got to know this beer, its palatability went downhill. Great for a one night stand, but not a long-term relationship."
"A nice beer, one worth trying, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Overall, a nutty brown ale that's a bit watery for the style. The color seems a bit golden or bronze, and shimmering to be a nut brown. Smells like wonderbread, no hops sense at all really, which is fine, with a light malty smell that strengthens a bit on the tongue. Mineral taste and smell as well--a bit off. Not bad, but nothing I'd order a second beer of--the bottle seems a little stale as well, so a trying a fresh draft some time is in order if I get the chance some day."
"Overall- Quite tasty for an organic and went well with my cheese and herb flatbread. Definitely would drink again."
"I liked this beer very much! It isn't the most complex nut brown ale out there, but a solidly-executed example of the style. Recommended."
"I wouldn't really recommend this beer. I bought this bottle at Woodman's in Oak Creek, WI."
"D - very easy to drink. a nice beer in this style."
"Easy drinkability due to the lack of cloying flavors and relatively low ABV, however, as far as the organic factor is concerned, it was hard to appreciate it in the taste..."
" I would not buy this again and for those of you who disagree I will tell you that my beer was fresh and why bother with some beers when there are other beers in the style that have more to offer. I am done with being diplomatic about so-so beers. Life is short and I do not have time to buy beer that does not satisfy my taste. If you like this beer then I say to each his own."
"D: Very good drinkability with a great malty backbone, spiciness makes this a great drinking brown that was truly delicious. Perfect to sip by the campfire. Earthy, woody, making for a true organic experience."
"Pours with good clarity and a dark chestnut color with a few lighter highlights. Collar of head that leaves some nice lacing. The aroma has a pleasing coffee element, along with a sweetness that is almost lactose-derived in character. Slight hops and a touch of graininess, but the aroma seems a touch disjointed and a tad sour. On the palate, smooth, chocolatey malts start things off, then some hard carbonation and hop oils provide for a tough, almost astringent flavor and mouthfeel. It's not soft at all, and for some reason I think that a brown ale ought to be."
"Taste is slightly bitter with an emphasis on the malt, not the hop. Dark caramel, and some nut flavors, hazelnuts? not much though. Not as satisfying as other nut browns I've had in the past. A little over carbonated for my taste in an English style beer."
"Don't drink and review."
"Not a bad beer by any means, but it isn't the most interesting or complex brown ale you're likely to find. The beer pours a ruby brown with some tan creamy head, some retention, minimal lacing. The smell is malty, caramel, buttery, perhaps a little toasted or slightly roasted grain as well. The beer is a light to medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation. The taste is toasted malts, caramel, a slightly burnt brown sugar flavor, some hops in the finish, and a slight nut flavor or maybe butterscotch in the background. This isn't a particularly complex brew, but it is light enough to enjoy a few, and has no distinctive aftertaste one way or another."
"This a fairly good english brown ale. Not too complex and it could use a bit more flavor. I'd still buy this beer again."
"Pours a true brown with tinted head that is full, foamy, and holds a bit. Aroma smells like candy? So odd, not bad in and of itself, just not a beer smell. Possibly there are only early addition hops so the aroma is all malt aromas and residual sugars...? Taste is very sweet and likable at first sip, but too sweet, and the lack of hops reveals the roasted charred malt as a detectable flavor in and of itself, as opposed to having some hops in there for a clean finish to mask the charred flavor directly, where it would instead be part of the mix of flavors that adds to the complexity and smoothness. Two extremes, syrupy sweet/nutty, and charred malt. Sad; the more i drink the less I like it. Good in a sample size. Mouthfeel is standard medium-light. Drinkability - this could be impressive if tweaked and ANY hops at all were present in the flavor - I'm no hophead, but I mean this is not even ""English"" kind of hop amounts, its more like ""theres hops in here?"" NOT a winner."
"Pretty light and crisp, this wouldn't be a half bad choice on tap."
"D: A pretty drinkable beer. Good mouthfeel with a nice taste that I just hoped stayed with the whole beer. First organic brew I have had, so I was pretty impressed overall."
"Pours a nice clear dark brown with a tan-nish head. Nose isn't as robust as I would love for it to be, but there are still tones of nuts there. Flavor is very earthy with a massive robust and consistent flavor profile. Great body to it. Never falls off at all. Feel has a full and slightly biting carbonation to it. Liquid is fairly thick and bodied. Overall a very drinkable beer. Easily sessionable and something I would hunt down on tap and definitely if it were on cask."
"The flavor here is a roasty toasty smoky woody brew, even the malt had a maple sugar sweetness to it. Drinking a forest here! Malt and some mild hoppy bitterness in good balance. Very enjoyable and drinkable, interesting to the end, a complex interplay of different woody and smoky aspects."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice small one-finger creamy tan head, some nice small islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, slightly bitter, with some caramel. The taste is malty, bitter, slight roastyness, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, better than I expected."
"Drinkability: a definite session ale but a bit too dry to have several of these."
"Pours a deep brown ruby with good clairty and a sturdy film of head that covers the whole top of beer.Even a little lacing. The nose is a mild hint of pecan and butter cream. These scents lower a bit when the beer is sipped. There is an overall nutty, grainy mixturefinished with some mild English hops. The start and middle of each sip is brunt of this beers flavor profile. he finish is a slow then than a soft watery note. Perfect session beer in any English style American pub."
"This is an easy beer to consume--great for a flight."
"T-Sweet roasted malts up front that lead into a dry more defined level of the roasted and chocolate malt charachter of this beer faint hop taste from the middle to finish that works well with the malts."
"It's a decent, tasty, easy-drinking brown ale."
"Pours a clean copper/ brown color with a tan head. Aromas of a sweet malt, a bit nutty, and a hint of caramel. In the taste, a sweet malt with notes of caramel and chocolate. A smooth malty mouthfeel with a sweet malty aftertaste. A nice brown, not too heavy with a nice balance. Easy to drink, nice for fall."
"Drinkability: Kind of a cross between an amber and a brown ale; just OK"
"An nice enjoyable brown ale."
"Not a bad beer, but not even close to being my favoriate nut brown. It did have a nice brown appearance with a decent head, but that was its best attribute. The scent was fine, but nothing spectacular; an all right malty scent. It had a good flavor, but I wish there would've been a more nutty aspect to it. That it was organic was a nice touch, though."
"Pours a hazy translucent brown/copper with nearly an inch of off-white head. Smells nutty and fruity. Tastes nutty and fruity at first, with a pleasant roasty coffee and chocolate quality emerging toward the finish. A slight astringency toward the finish too. Very drinkable - one sip definitely invites another. Medium creamy body with a decent amount of carbonation. Wow, what a good brown ale. A new favorite for the style!"
"D-highly drinkable, a delicious nut brown beer. The sourness lends it a unique touch which will lead me to seek it out when i am in a mood for roasted malt."
"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Poured a reddish brown color, was definately translucent. Had a foamy head that lasted a few minutes, but then left a small layer of bubbles, as well as tracings down the side of the glass. Smell was of oatmeal and wheat bread. Tasted earthy, and had a sweet ending to the taste. Felt way to watery in the mouth, and left a bitterness that wasn't noticable anywhere else. It is very easy to drink, almost goes down to quick."
"I had this on tap with dinner at Ruby's Oyster Bar in Rye, NY. The appearance was OK, dark reddish brown hue, somewhat clear, with a thick and fragile looking white foam. The aroma had all kinds of things in it, hard to distinguish from a porter in my opinion. There was a little bit of nuttiness (go figure, the name probably put that in my head) and some chocolate, and also some roasted malt. The taste is chocolate and caramel, but not as good as those two descriptors would imply. Still, those are the first adjectives which came to mind. No real bitterness detected in the after-taste, whatever hops are in here are for balance alone. Pretty well done overall, but I just don't get the ""organic"" thing when it comes to beer. Beer is already pretty organic I think, the ingredients are pretty simple and actually sound hippy-ish and organic on their own."
"Very tasty, very drinkable. Lots of flavor and pretty complex without getting extreme in any respect and without trying to knock anyone down with malt or hops or alcohol."
"Overall a tasty brown ale. The flavor profile was a bit light however."
"($1.79 / 12 oz.)"
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful pale and crystal malt scent that is sweet and malty with a nice English yeast fruitiness. The taste is decent. It has a solid malt base with a nice nutty flavor. It also has quite a bitter finish, that is a bit out of character for this style. It goes down easy and finishes a bit dry with some malty notes. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's a bit out of style, but not a bad session beer. One of the better organic beers I've had."
"Pours a clear, reddish amber color topped by a light brown, thick head. There is some pretty decent lacing. The aroma is sweet and fruity accompanied by apricot, caramel apples and berries. The taste is nutty and bready with some decent hop bitterness and sweet malts. A good example of the style."
"D- I couldn't finish this. I was in the mood for an english brown and this didn't taste like one to me. If it were a blind tasting where I didn't have a style in mind I would give it another chance. It's not terrible...just not very good."
"Pours a dark brown color with a head that seems too fizzy. Aroma is malty and sweet, almost like molasses. Taste is also too fizzy. Hints of malt and some coffee notes come out of the taste. Not much else follows. The bottle is good until August of this year so I have no idea why it seems so carbonated. Somewhat dull overall though."
"I could drink several in a sitting and go away happy. I'll buy more but I like the Peak pale ale a bit more."
"pours a meduim brown with a very large tan head that held to one finger and left large patchs of lacing to the finish. fruity aroma with some coffee and citrus. taste is roasted malt and coffee some nut flavor with a slightly bitter ending. mouthfeel smooth, light, good carbonation. good session beer."
"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Clear mahogany color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Nutty nose. Starts with nutty bread flavor some hops, finish has hints of bitterness. $1.25 for a 12oz bottle from Smiley's Beverage Dover, NH. Best by Nov 2005"
"body is medium. easily drinkable, very smooth brown ale."
"Very standard taste, but quality nonetheless. Yet, why did I pay $9.29 for a six pack? The organic quality doesn't seem to live up to the expectation."
"D- An all around good brown ale, tasty enough to go back to again ... but I don't really care about the whole organic thing when it comes to beer. Malt, water, hops, yeast ... simple as that."
"This was a fabulous beer. More bitter than the typical nut brown, and finished with a great nutty flavor. The bitterness was balanced perfectly by how smooth it is. Both chocolate and munich malts are detectable. It has characteristics similar to both the Dogfish Head India Brown Ale and Samuel Smith's brown. I will definitely drink this again. The 4.7 ABV is perfect for the style."
"12 ouncer, with best before dating notched onto the label, this one pours typical light brown, with some reddish hues, clear and supporting a thick tan head, that leaves behind thick, scattered lacing. Nose is of nutty malts. This is another tasty creation from Shipyard, brewed under contract, with the Peak Organic label upon it. Nutty, malty and flavorful, with notes of vanilla, honey, cashews, caramel and malty goodness. Subtle, drying hops late finish off this classy sessioner. Well worth a try and recommended highly."
"Drinkability level is solid; easy to drink and enjoyable."
"Flavor starts of fairly sweet with brown sugar and caramel, allows just a bit of roast in the middle and finishes with an unexpected herbal hop finish. pretty tasty stuff. A nice englishy version of the brew. maybe the organics make it come together so nice. Definitely worth a shot if you like the style."
"This is a great Nut Brown Ale! Not far off from a Samuel Smith's version but with a little added hop bite and some more roastiness. Really satisfying and easy to drink. This would make a great session brew for sure. My first Peak Organic experience and I must say I'm impressed. Cheers people!"
