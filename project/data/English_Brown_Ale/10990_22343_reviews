"The color is a beautiful ruby/amber. The smell has strong toasted nut aroma, and after an initial shockwave on the tongue it mellows out and balances very nicely. Ales are not typically my favorite, but this beer is unique and great for what it is. The toasted nut flavor on the aftertaste is quite pleasant."
""
"I think this beer is underrated. Not a lot of head, but it has a deep mahogany color. You can smell the pecan and it has a subtle nutty taste. I'm a fan!"
""
""
""
""
"Great tasting beer, very unexpected"
""
"Good brown ale. Nothing bad to say, I would recommend. A touch sweet for my taste but still pretty good. Def worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was surprisingly a pretty good beer. Really smooth. Nice genuine pecan taste. Id recommend"
""
""
""
""
"A very good brown ale with a subtle pecan flavor."
""
""
""
""
"This was a one sip drain pour and the girlfriend felt the same way.  I can't even specifically say why.  It was synergistically bad."
""
""
"3.29/5: Not a world beater, but very approachable and easy to drink"
""
""
"This glass is so cold I may over rated this."

"Nice pecan taste. Not much lacing. Very tasty."

"There's nothing bad about this ale, but it doesn't have anything that will make me come back for more. There's almost no pecan taste to it, the main reason anyone would initially try it. I can barely smell any pecan aroma either. The few things that I did like is it doesn't linger, there's almost no bitterness, and it's got a good color. I'd take Newcastle over this any day."
"On tap. Pours clear light brown with no head. Aromas of malt. Nut certainly comes through on the flavor, with smooth sweet malt."
"Slight pecan aroma. Very light pecan taste. Not much alcohol, but smooth and tasty."
""
""
""
"Looks pretty, but the flavor was bland and too sweet."
"God damnit, Jesus made this beer."
""
"O: I believe you should give it a try very smooth wish I had another"
"Overall: a pleasant easy drinking nutty brown ale that has a nice balanced flavor."
""
""
"Seems pretty underappreciated on here, though I did have it on tap in Mississippi"
"Smooth ale with a balanced nutty flavor.  Brewed in good taste."
"Overall:  This is a pretty decent brown ale, possessing good, if subtle, flavors of nuttiness, malt and sweetness, all nicely balanced, but not pronounced.  It was certainly worth a try, and I’d certainly drink it again if offered, but I won’t be picking it up again on my own."
""
""
"Overall:  Not a bad beer.  No bitterness.  But there's just not enough nutty flavor to market this as a pecan-ish beer."
"It was drinkable but I expected much more flavor.  Didn't give what the label said.  No pecan in smell or taste.  Ok but not a stand out in anyway."
""
""
"Didn't really do much for me. No aroma, tasted like a regular brown ale with just a hint of ""pecan"""
"Pours clear copper with small white head, smells of pecan, malt caramel and yeast, tastes nutty with maltiness and slight hops, average mouthfeel."
""
"Overall - Below what I had hoped for, but not bad at all. I probably wouldn't spend my hard earned money on this, but would gladly drink one anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
"Definitely notice the pecan flavor. Good bit of malt flavor and sweetness for the low ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Rather tasty, very smooth and easy to drink.  Session Brown that is tasty enough to enjoy and drink all night."
"I really enjoyed this beer.  It's light in body but the pecan and brown ale flavors are very pronounced.  Excellent brew."
"Nice red color. The pecan definitely comes through. Gets better as you drink it but it should be better."
"What a disappointment. This is my first Lazy Magnolia beer. I’m hoping it gets better."
""
""
""
""
"Just a solid beer in any weather."
"Overall: Very drinkable, very nutty, sweet, but not too sweet. Really like this."
""
""
""
""
"This is a beer great for people who love beer and even those who don't. Sweet but not syrupy and it's a surprisingly easy to drink beer. Perfect to have when firing up the grill in the summer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"nothing special ok English brown"
""
""
"A nice pecan nutty flavor in a milder brown ale.  Well balanced and just a nice little beer."
""
""
""
""
"Though, as I keep drinking this, the sweetness becomes a bit over-pronounced.  It's like a cumulative sweetness; it lingers in my mouth and every sip becomes a touch sweeter.   That's disappointing.  In a smaller quantity, this was excellent.  My guess is the low hopping means there's nothing to counteract the sweetness of the malt."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Had high hopes for this but began the let down spiral on pour. Not much head at all, even with a fairly aggressive pour. No lacing to speak of either. Nose was nearly nonexistent, save for a whiff of toasted malts but not much a whiff at that. Taste was at best, boring. Nothing pecan or intriguing about this at all. Even that which made it a brown ale was not really good. Body was thin. Just not something that I enjoyed, obviously...."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a bronze color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is nutty, bready. Taste is of pecans, malts, mild sweetness, easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Not as bitter as expected. Lightly sweet. Not very hoppy. Smooth. Pecan flavor is not prominent but it does have a nutty scent."

"Dark Brown in appearance. A very small nose on this beer that has very few hops for scent. The flavor to me makes this beer special. You can really taste the pecans with a very nice malty flavor. Has some yeast and very little bitterness. Can almost taste a little buttery I think, which can be the oils from the pecans. Gives the beer a nice creaminess. Mouth feel is medium to light. One of the first beers from Mississippi I have ever had. Being from Mississippi, this is by far the most common local beers and very solid choice for any occasion. When I think of Mississippi, this is the beer I go to."
""
"A friend brought these to have round the campfire. Had it out the bottle. Mild, smooth and pecan-y. Usually I'm bored by Browns, so this is a nice alternative. Would have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: 3.68 - A decent beer, deserving of a C rating. There's a time and place for this beer, but I'd certainly have it again!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overly sweet aroma and taste.  This beer is thinner than one would expect for the sugary content.  Small head, but decent spots for lace.  No notable hop, cloy aftertaste of white cane sugar."
""
""
"Thin head, low carbonation. Sweet finish. Not a beer I would buy again."

"Not sure what to say about this beer.  Has little flavor.  Do taste and smell pecans.  Dark brown.  No head.  Light.  Drinkable but nothing memorable.  No hoppyness or bitterness.  Thought it was bland and unfulfilling.  Just there.  No bad, not great either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: Light body but slightly gritty."
""
""
""
""
""
"This a smooth lighter tasting brown ale. Taste is mildly bitter with a nutty finish. Pleasant after taste lingers and you really pick up the pecan on the finish.  Overall not a bad beer, but I wouldn't call it great either."
""
""
"Great Beer!"
""
""
"Overall - A solid all-around brew. The additions of pecan do well to add a distinct pecan flavor, so that's a plus. Overall it's a bit lighter than what I like in a brown, but as an English style it's to be expected. I'd likely buy it again if I ever saw it, but I'm not going out of my way or making a trade to get it again."
""
""
""
""
"This is, by far, the worst beer I have ever had."
""
""
""
""
"O 3 - cloyingly sweet at times. It's not bad, but nothing I would get again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability:  Sounded like a very promising beer, but by the end I feel like it fell short.  Like a pecan soda with alcohol in it.  I don’t think I’ll have again.  Not a bad beer, just not a good one, and I like pecans.  Oh well."
""
""
"Overall a very pleasant drinking experience. It is quite good for the price it's sold at in NOLA. I almost always have a bottle somewhere in the house since its such a nice beer to sit back and relax with. It has depth and complexity, but not to the extent where drinking it is a task to focus on. Cheers Lazy Magnolia, on a very solid solid beer."

"Weighting (percentages): 20, 20, 40, 5, 15. Avg: 3.81"

"This is a good break from some standard beers. It has a sweet taste that makes it a very good dessert beer, or just a change of pace from some others. I'm typically a hoppy beer lover, but this one surprised me. I wouldn't make it a permanent fixture in my fridge, but it is a welcome visitor!"
""
"Nice overall beer, but lack the advertised pecan taste. Very similar to other nut brown ales but was looking for the pecan to be a difference. I served this beverage at 38 degrees and that may have been a little to cold, so I will try it later this week at 42 degrees to see if the pecan flavor stands out. The low IBU's at 19 makes this beer good for a social setting  because their is not bitter hops."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a very good beer."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I don't think the sweetness is overpowering, but rather straightforwardly brash. The pecan flavor plays into the novelty, and so does the fact I think it a fitting beer for a Saturday match-up between Ole Miss and Auburn."

"Pours a deep amber brownish color with nice clarity. A bit on the reddish side for a brown ale. No head at all present. The nose starts with some brown bread, oatmeal, and light nutty notes. Not sure that I would pick the nuttiness out as pecan, but there is definitely some influence from the adjuncts. Taste is watery with nutty notes and hints of grain. No hops noted in the flavor but some bitterness at the finish makes for an unpleasant finish. Mouthfeel is light and low carbonation. Overall, this beer is not well executed. It tastes like a really light watery beer with some adjunct flavors added. Would not return to this beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The dry and powdery aspects build up a little to ease off the strong sweetness in the middle of every sip and makes for a much more pleasurable finish than it seems destined to have in its medium body."

"I must say that you have to try the tap if you are going to rate this beer.  I had bottled first, and was disappointed.   It seemed like another lazy Porter at best.  I was reluctant to try it at a Gulfport pizza joint but since it was on tap there, I went for it.  It seems to be popular in the area and I wanted to give it proper test.  And was I pleased!  This beer is so good on tap.  The pecan really shines in this nutty ale.  Another party at the table said they had had it before and was un-impressed, so I told them my experience.  They decided to try it on tap here and they agreed that it was decisively better."

"Pours a light brown color with a white head. The aroma is a bit nutty, grainy and slightly sweet. In the taste, light nuttiness, sweet dough, light herbal hop. Finishes on the sweet side with pecan in the finish. Light bodied, a little watery, but easily drinkable and good flavor. This is a good ale and holds up nicely in the warm weather."

"The sharp/acidic bite is offputting, but great depth of nutty flavor. Truly a unique beer. A hint of diacetyl in the aftertaste drives the nutty presence home."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a reasonable brown ale, not my go-to style for sure, would like more (some) pecan in the taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a brilliant mahogany brown with a 1-inch tan head, that dissipates rather quickly, settling in at 1/16th inch. Caramel with hints of roasted nuts and restrained malt in the nose with an ever-so-slight sour note. Medium-light body with suggestions of cocoa and toasted bread. Very little hops. Expecting more pecan on the palate. Slight, pleasant lingering, with restrained, but balanced malt and hop notes. No Belgian lace. Nice brown ale, unfortunately, it is not as moreish as would be expected of a Brown Ale."

"Also had on tap recently, so this review is sort of a review of both, although the final review is from a bottle."
""
"I had this at the Atlanta airport. Pours light brown with white head. Taste is nutty, earthy. Nose has some brown sugar, root beer, bread crust, but artificially sweet. Flavor is the same, frankly. Artificially sweet, brown sugar, root beer, root veg. Sweet finish.. I was hoping for a nice nut brown type flavor, however, I thought this was not good. I would not drink this again."
""
""
"Overall - the style is a bit boring to me, and this one is about par for the course."

"I don't like pecans, so initially, I was a bit hesitant but this beer is really good. It's almost dessert-like. Also, the couple that started the brewery are the perfect combination for this business: one is an electric engineer and the other is a chemical engineer!"
""
""
"Overall - For my first pecan infused beer, Lazy Magnolia delivers the right roasted nut and malt flavour. Very enjoyable beer with all the right elements."
""
""
""
""

"O - An ok beer. Its not bad, just nothing special. I was really looking foward to trying this beer but was dissappointed. On a positive note, one could definately put back seera lof these in one session"

"Overall: a decent beer overall, not particularly flavorful or aromatic, but definitely smooth and easy drinking. It is refreshing to have a beer everyone once in a while that doesn't punish your palate or blow your mind. This one is just that. Nothing wrong with it, nice bready notes and pecan hints and a little residual sweetness."
""

""

""
""
"Bottle  Appearance: Redish brown  Aroma: Some malt, very faint nut  Taste: Slightly sweet  Palate: Light body, somewhat flat. Has a slightly sweet finish  Overall: I don't pick up the pecans at all, and it ends up being a fairly non-descript sweetish brown ale."

"O- While it's not necessarily an unpleasant beer, it's just not worth drinking when there are so many better options out there."
"Purchased from the Total Wine store in Pembroke Pines, FL. Pours a nice dark brown chestnut color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of sweet pecans and caramel and the taste is also of sugar coated pecans. A very malt forward brew here. Overall, not a bad offering from Lazy Magnolia."
""
""
"Can't see myself ever drinking this again."
""
""
""
""
"o: to be honest, i think its good not great. this is a really sweet beer, so if you're not into sweet beers stay away. sweet malt and carbonation dominate this beer. i think i'd like it a little more if the mouthfeel was a little less carbonated. not bad though, an alright pub beer"
""
"There's a degree of originality in the sweetness and oilyness, but it's a bit uneventful/flat for me, and I just don't care for the taste."

"I actually like this beer a lot and wish it wasn't 1500 miles between me and another one."
"Thanks to metter98 and his parents for bringing this one back to NY for me."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, yah, get no pecans here, and that metallic tinge to it. Not a fan."
""
"Lastly, like some beers I have tasted before, there is a distinct metallic taste to this beer another mark against it."

"Beautiful dark amber color with a thin head (dissipates in a matter of seconds), with a smell of wheat barley (minimal to no pecan smell). Flavor reminded me a lot of Sam Adams Boston Lager with a hint of nuttiness (but barely). I wouldn't exactly call this an ale because it tasted so much like a lager. An overall good and safe beer to have. However, I was expecting more than safe, but rather an unusual hint of pecan since I haven't had pecan-brewed beer before. Tasted like many other good lagers (not ales) I've had before."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a nice dark amber. The beer poured a small head that was gone pretty fast. The beer did have killer lacing though. A nice caramel smell oozed from the tumbler and when I took that first hit I was pleasantly surprised. Nice sweet hit but not overbearing, sorta like a handful of kracker jacks. I reall did not get much of a pecan taste, but that might be a good thing. I liked this one and would buy again."

"O - This is a damn tasty nut brown ale. I'd put it right up there with Sam Smith's."
""
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a much lighter color than I expected. It's a light brown, basically a deep orange. There is a decent looking tan head on top. The smell of the beer is roasted and has a subtle nuttiness. The taste of the beer is malty, very gentle bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth, lighter bodied and drinkable. Overall not a bad brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Would recommend for fans of the style!"
""
"This pours a clear, medium brown color with a fizzy, beige head. Not really getting much for pecans in the aroma, just a mild scent of malts. The taste is mellow and slightly sweet. Not at all complex, this is a simple nut brown ale. Actually, if it wasn’t for the label I would have never guess there were pecans in the beer. It finishes very smooth and clean!"
"Overall: On of my southern favorites! Very happy to have gotten this on a trade to enjoy again."
""
""
"pours clear dark amber/light caramel with mimimal off-white head. nose is filled w. sweet caramel, vanilla, banana, clove, malts. it smells a bit too sweet for me. it ain't christmas afterall. surprised by the taste which is better than i would have expected: minimal bitterness, clean, crisp on the front which fades to caramel malts. fortunately all of that aroma isn't indicative of the taste. usually the English style is a bit too bitter & harsh for me, but this is very drinkable. carbonation & mouthfeel are on the mark."
"Not really what I was expecting in this beer and regardless it isn’t very good. I have no need to finish my bottle. Regardless of what I think about this beer I am very thankful to finally try it. Thanks Mindy for the bottle. I’ve now tried and reviewed a beer from Mississippi. 49 states sampled… I need to try a beer from North Dakota."

"possibly the first beer ive had from the state of mississippi. i wouldnt call it a brown ale either, maybe more of an english pale ale. it pours real light brown in color, but its more tan or bronze in color because of its radiance and the penetrating light. theres a nice slowly fading lace head on top. the nose is quite nutty, but also lighter on the malt roast than i expect in a brown ale. no yeast or hops to speak of at all, but i do smell what must be the pecans, and they are sweet and woody. the flavor is equally light, with the pecans really beign featured a lot more than the abita version (which is the only other pecan beer ive had). i like that this isnt spiced at all, just flavored with the nuts, which are tasted more on the back end of the trip. really light in body, id say too much so, but in the context of a steamy mississipps swamp or somethiing (sorry for the stereotype), i think its lightness would be a pro rather than a con, which it was in a denver january. smooth feel though, relaxed carbonation, and overall a beer and a brewery id really like to drink more of. who knew?"

"O: This was a very enjoyable beer to relax with on a warm Florida afternoon. I could have two or three of this beer without getting tired of it- it has just enough of a twist to make it different from your typical brown ale."
"Brownish/dark amber pour, small off-white head sank to a ringlet, leaving just a few spots behind on the glass. Malty nose, toasty, bready, nutty. Simple but non-offensive. Taste was similar, bready malts hinting towards caramel, toasted nuttiness, light notes of yeast and fruit rinds. Body was about medium, kind of lagerish, not great, but pretty easily drinkable overall."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I really liked this beer! Will definitely try again. Enjoyed the pecan taste/smell. Good beer."
""
""
"Overall this is very drinkable and fairly enjoyable overall. Not really as nut forward as I was hoping for or expecting in either the flavor or the aroma. The fruity English yeast aspects really came out here and elevated the candy sweet malt base almost too a fault."
""
"Pours a clear brown with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt and toasted nut aromas. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is fairly mild and drinkable."
""
""

"Edit: While I have been reading others' reviews of this beer, I have been savoring the aftertaste from the one I had been drinking while reviewing. The aftertaste may be the best I've ever had in a beer. For that reason, I'm bumping up my rating ... and opening up another!"
""
""
""
""
""

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter for reviewing purposes. Off-white head, low to moderate retention on a mahogany body. Looks almost like an amber more than a brown. Lacing is soapy and slides down the glass. Aroma includes caramel malts, some nuttiness I suppose, and a slight roast. Taste is caramel maltiness, slightly sweet, again with a slight nuttiness and roast. Mouthfeel is a bit thin as expected after viewing the beer. Not jam packed with flavor but nothing off-putting and very agreeable to the average person."
""
""
"Lightish body with medium high, assertive carbonation that robs the beer of any smoothness or creaminess I enjoy in the better brown ales; falls a little on the watery side. Ultimately unsatisfying. Not terrible but totally unexceptional."
"O: This beer could have been decent, but comes off as mediocre and forgettable. Not nearly as well made as Holy City's Pecan Dream."
"The sweetness is initially cloying and rather simple in nature. Some obvious nutty and grainy notes come out in the aftertaste. Thicker in texture than most from this style, but it doesn't seem to improve the drinkability. Certainly interesting, maybe even unique, but not very good from a session drinking perspective. Craft brew still in its infancy in Mississippi."
""
"Served from growler into a sampler shaker. Poured brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pecan, slight roasted malt, and bread. The flavor was of sweet malt, pecan, roasted malt, subtle milk chocolate, and bread. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. The pecan aspect of the one really managed to carry through which is surprising due to the intensity of them. This really made the brew enjoyable on my palate as I’m a huge fan of them. The aroma wasn’t quite as great as it was kind of hard to pick up on just about anything. Glad I got the chance to try this one again in a different format."

"A mixed feeling for this English Nut Brown Ale, good or bad, depends. Popped this bottle open cold into a glass and gave it time to breathe. First taste I was expecting pecans, but was presented with an overly sweet caramel syrup that put me off, nevertheless this quickly fades away to a mild nutty taste and nice smooth finish. Overall I think this is a good specialty style Brown Ale that should be tried at least once."

"O/D-Liked it once, Either way, I was happy to try it. Consistency is key."
"this beer seems pretty inconsistant. this is my third time to taste this beer, and I have to say it is probably the worst of the three times. I must preface that this was bottled 10 months ago, and although that may have been a part of why it didn't fare well (even with the others doing the tasting tonight), but it tastes more like a mild contamination. It seemed to have a metalic aftertaste, like the PH spiked. Please don't judge this beer by this review because I have enjoyed it in the past, but this batch was definitely not what Lazy Magnolia should be proud of."
"Light brown color, which was lighter than expected. Very little head and poor retention. Seemed far too highly carbed. Mettalic finish which suggests some sort of contamination to me or a high pH kind of issue with the beer. Then I checked the bottle and it was dated December. Since it is October now this must be a distribution problem or some organization issue within the brewery itself as the store I purchased the beer from is less than a month old."

"O/D-Liked it once, HATED it the second time. Maybe the second keg was screwy? Either way, I was happy to try it but would probably avoid it if I ever saw it again."
"I was excited to try this one, and it turned out a bit flat. On draft at Vello's in Gainesville. Pours a light brown color with a creamy off white head. Aroma is slight nut, maybe a little grain, and some skunkiness unfortunately. Thin mouthfeel, a little watery, with low to medium carbonation. Flavor is lacking, with watered down grains, no sweetness, and a finish that is a bit unpleasant. I wouldn't go after this again. Maybe worth a try once for the Mississippi tick."

"overall - nice for a pint or too, but could get cloying after a few."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- an interesting concept, I would prefer it to be a bit stronger, everything seems a bit contained. This would serve as a pretty good dessert beer as it is very sweet, it overpowers the nuttiness a bit."
""
"This beer pours an absolutely beautiful deep deep amber with a fluffy 1 1/2 finger head, leaving extensive lacing. The smell was very citrus and I did detect some nuttiness but it was buried beneath the fruit. Mouthfeel was pretty good, but nothing special. The taste was very average. I expected more nuttiness since this beer was brewed with pecans, but I mostly tasted sweet malt with grapefruit signatures and some hops. Worth a taste, but nothing too special."
""
""
"Taste isn't much better as English yeast imparts its typically dry profile over the sub-par malt base. Some nuttiness creeps in to impart a small amount of alternate flavor, but nothing can save this from mediocrity. Not worth your money."
""
""
"O: Not too bad, but a little more malt character would help this out a lot. Still an interesting beer."

"Body is weak, almost watery with a decent carbonation load. Some, albeit slight, warming. This is their first recipe and should be revisited, revamped or recycled."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours dark amber with a tall, biege head that dissipates quickly. Lacing is not left on the side of the glass as the head dissipates. There are roasted malts and pecans in the aroma. The nutty smell is prominent and there's a mild sweetness as well. Sweet bready malts and pecans come through in the taste. There are some hops on the back end. The flavor is also quite clean. The body is light to medium with low carbonation. The beer is very smooth. The drinkability is high. This is a very good and refreshing beer."
""
""
""
""
"Flavor is crisp and juicy with English yeast esters and toffee/nutty maltiness. Still not getting much Pecan, per say, but for the style this is highly quaffable. Thin body, medium carbonation with fine bubbles. Southern Pecan is an easy drinker, but I don't get much Pecan...they should take a line from (512)'s Pecan Porter and crank that flavor up!"

"O: An interesting beer but it doesn't live up for the name! I didn't get any pecan flavor or aroma just a common brown ale! Give it a try"

""
""
"This was a decent beer, I thought the brown sugar was a little too much though."
""
""
"Overall: It's decent, and an interesting concept. I feel though that the beer needs a stronger, more robust body to support the pecan. More roasted malt might work, perhaps even some chocolate malts. Now the beer remains a curiosity. It was nice to try it, but I won't go out of my way to look for it."
""
"Taste I gave just above average because of its uniqueness...it tastes of that macro style malt we all love :) but I do taste the pecans. Well, its closer to roasted peanuts to me. Either way, its different and +1 on that. Overall, drinkable but no award winning brew for me."
""
""
"Overall: Very drinkable and refreshing. The nuttiness is appreciable and a nice difference maker for this beer."
"Overall - Not a bad brown ale, but I've certainly had better. I might give it another shot soon and hope that I just grabbed a bad bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is fairly medium-bodied. It thickens up pretty good if you swish it around your mouth. Very sweet; no dryness here. Overall, this brown ale is pretty meh to me, despite its fairly unique quantity of nut flavor. A true ""nut brown ale," but lacking in depth and character in spite of its innovations."
""
"O - Yeah, its nutty. Mostly average across the board."
""
"O: This is totally forgettable. I do get the pecans on the nose and the taste, but it is mild at best. Almost zero malt or hop presence to back the brew up. Super light drinking and not at all offensive for a warm summer's day. But an English Brown is an English Brown, and I expect more on the malt front, even if we want to keep it at 4.5% ABV. Disappointing."

"An overall very tasty little beer."
"Overall, a decent brown ale. I like the mild sweetness addition to the nuttiness."
"o: Loved it, very glad I got to try it."
""
"D/O- Very drinkable, so bonus points here for that. Enjoyed! The only thing I can see improving is it's appearance...a sustained head would do wonders. Thanks for the extra sommersb!"
""
"Overall. Not a big fan of this beer, which has its fans. Both fresh and dated, this beer did not do it for me. I might try Lazy Magnolia's other brews but i'll do a pick six next time. This beer is a rare drain pour. Just can't stomach the rest."
""
"Drink- It was good but I wanted to like it more. Just didnt wow me even though had good flavor and well layered."
""
"Pours a clear light brown, letting in lots of light, moderate cap of faintly off-white froth, little lacing. Scent leads with sweet brown sugar, honey and roasted and toasted nuts and grain. Taste follows suit but quite mild, sweet and nutty. Lighter side of medium bodied, thin and almost watery. The combination of weak flavor and light body didnt provide enough enjoyment."
"D - Easy to drink, but ultimately pretty average. That this beer is #26 on the top beers from the 'South' says more about how bad the beer culture is down there than it does about the merits of this brew. Passable if you're desperate for a MS tick."
""
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is very thin, a little sweet and oddly astringent."

"Not a bad beer at all, just a bit sweet and ordinary."

"Overall - This beer is good to try once, but I would never drink it again. It's not very often I find a beer that I wouldn't drink even if it was free, but this is one of them. Way too sweet. If you are expecting a mildly sweeter version of Newcastle, this is way off the mark. Not recommended"
""
"O: I can dig. Lazy Magnolia's Southern Pecan is a nice little beer, something I'd drink fairly often if in it's Southern distro network. It didn't rock my face, but certainly makes for a flavorful session brew."
"O - Not a bad beer for such a unique flavor addition."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy mahogany brown with a thin light tan head. Malty aroma has a caramel note and a nutty hint. Mouth-filling nutty, malty, woody flavor has hints of caramel and horehound. Firm-bodied texture delivers a lively, sassy fizz to round out a satisfying beer."
""
""
""
""
"OK carbonation and so forth. The main thing is that its sort of a sweet mess, I think one is more than enough."
""
""
""
"This brew has a unique flavor. The pecan flavor is fairly strong and seems to consist of the pecan nut as well as the shell. This brew will not be for everyone."
""
""
""
"Not half bad, a bit too sweet. Just because it has nuts in it does not mean the sweetness had to be amped up which I think actually takes away fromt he pecan flavor. Good to try once."
"D - Interesting beer with some complex flavors. Mouthfeel was a little thin for my liking, but a respectable variation on an English Brown."

"Comparison/reference: Reminiscent of a lighter-bodied Samuel Smith Nut Brown ale or a Newcastle on tap that has pecans added to it. Highly recommended!"

"O: A nice Brown Ale with a very smooth and rich roasted pecan flavor. I really liked this beer. Nice on a cold night....recommend it."
""
""
"Pours a nice transparent amber to copper with a foamy off-white head that retains through the duration. Typical brown ale notes with a distinct but balanced/not overpowering nuttiness and pecan sweetness. Not a lot of hops, but it's in balance. This is my first experience with this brewery, and I like it a whole lot. Looking forward to trying more."
""
""
""
"I had this on-tap with dinner in Tupelo, Mississippi. This is good stuff. It has the taste of pecans without being a praline/desert beer. I'm really glad the brewer didn't decide to get cute with it. It went well with the crab cakes. I would gladly have a couple more again."

"O. A well balanced brew and a good flavor I would have this brew again if given another oppurtunity."
"O – Overall this was a good beer. Brown ales are one of my least favorite styles if you can call it a style. It seems like when someone doesn’t know what to call a beer it gets grouped into the Brown Ale category. This beer however really obviously deserves to be in this category. Its very simple and yet refined and tasty."
"O-It's hard for me to give a negative review, so I will say this beer is not ""bad"" perse, just not a brown ale... Very off from the style imo."
"O: This is a pretty solid brew. The sweetness could become a bit overwhelming after having a few of these beers. It's not bad by any means, but I don't see myself going after another bottle or two."
"Overall impression - not much to complain about aside from the feel. It's solid and well-constructed. I'm in no rush for another bottle, but I certainly wouldn't mind having it again."
"Nonetheless, this was a disappointment. I expected more pecan character to be integrated with the brown ale, but didn't happen."
"O: Overall, a fairly simple but tasty beer. At only 4.25%, this would be a nice session beer. Too bad it doesn't make it to my market."
"Overall: This is a pretty good brown ale. The aromas and tastes of it are very enjoyable; definitely it's high points. The appearance and mouthfeel are pretty usual for a brown ale. I had to let mine stand for a while before I could really separate the scents and taste it was giving off. The only thing that I could detect when it was cold were the caramel on the nose and the hops in the taste. It took a while for it to open up, but it was worth it. I will buy this one again."
"O: We were a little disappointed that we had to look so hard for the advertised pecans. They're in there, but temperature is key to bringing them out. Let this one warm up."
"O: Goes down easily, tasty, not filling, not much of a kick, ok representation of style. The sweetness to this beer sticks a bit in the finish, which makes this a 1 or 2 pint and done for me."
"An above average brown ale well worth seeking out."
"A very pleasant summer find."
"Overall: One of my favorite go-to beers. Southern Pecan is great from bottle to glass, but even smoother on tap. Definately Lazy Magnolia's best brew."
"Thanks to Tolann and her friends for sharing beers a month or so back at her basement party. This one poured a dark brown color with a thick light brown head. Aromas of smoke, nuts and chocolate. On the palate, this one was medium bodied with flavors of smoke, chocolate and pecans."
"Overall - a solid beer."
"O- I like this beer. A very nice addition to the Nashville market a couple of years ago. It is a very nice sessionable brown."
"O - Not a bad beer, better than what I was expecting coming out of Mississippi. Easy drinker."
"It's a brown ale so of course it's meant to be well balanced. Not big and malty, and not a hop bomb. It does this very well. A really great session beer. Delicious and refreshing. I suggest picking this up anytime you're in an area it's available."
"Mouthfeel / Overall: The beer is medium bodied with adequate carbonation. A very nice malt driven beer. I really wish this beer came to Cincinnati. This beer and Hopitolous from Nola was a very frequently ordered beer while I was in New Orleans. Very well done."
"D/O - pretty easy to drink if it's readily available (it'd definitely be pretty easy to throw a few back at a bar), but I won't make a special effort to get it again. Sorry, but Abita does it better with their Pecan Harvest, and I can get that in Texas."
"O- I thought this was a nice beer but I expected a little bit more nut flavor to it. If you call it Southern Pecan I expect a little more nut flavor. Other than that I thought this was a good tasting brown ale."
"Whole roasted pecans are, allegedly, included during the brewing process but you’d never know. At least offer a bag of nuts or something so I don’t feel like I’ve been taken advantage of. Or some Planters trail mix. Mmm, trail mix."
"Poured into my ccb pint glass. No head at all, very little lacing. Aroma of malts and pecans, slightly sweet in the nose. Aroma of pecan pie but very feint. Mouthfeel is ok, nothing special. Taste follows the nose, average brown ale with a little bit of a twist. Not bad but nothing to write home about."
"O - Pretty one-dimensional. Clean and caramelly, with a hint of nuttiness that could be from the pecans, but then again it might not be. Not bad, but not worth going out of your way for."
"Overall- Easy drinking beer. Overall pretty good nut brown, can at times seem too sweet."
"D - A very good brew, I'm glad my friend was able to bring me some since I can't get it here. Worth a try indeed!"
"Pours like a somewhat flat Dr. Pepper with a limited tan ring of head. The smell is decadent and unfortunately, betrays a forthcoming over sweetness. It smells fantastic. Like really phenomenal. The flavor is really, actually like candied pecans, almonds. It kind of smells like those booths that sell the roasted nuts based entirely on smell that just draws you in. It's pretty decadent for the ABV. This is a good beer to order if you can't drink - just sit there and smell it for a while and you aren't missing anything. The flavor is way to sweet atop a thin body, it really doesn't pull together. Im really belaboring the point, but if youn plug your nose, it tastes like nothing at all and suddenly your tongue is coated in thin bodied lingering sweetness. Without being rude and plugging your nose, the flavor is like a super poor mans version of the nose. I don't see anyway I could drink more than one of these with how sweet it finishes without even rewarding you with that in the taste. That said, the nose is worth the price of admission - swirl it up and enjoy your night as DD."
"Overall - This is a good beer. It is not great by any means and definitely has its faults. Overall it does live up to its name as the nutty character is definitely there. My only complaints are the beer's macro-y characteristics, without them this would be a great beer. 4/5"
"D - Interesting beer with some flavor complexities. It is a little too far from the English Brown Ale I was expecting for my liking. The nuts come across with a tannic bite that dominates the flavor."
"Overall this was just OK. Its definitely drinkable, but I don't know if I could ever make this a habit of drinking. Nonetheless, I'm glad I got to try it."
"Not a bad brown, though I actually find this to be a bit more complex straight from the bottle...preferably at a casino gambling in Mississippi. Can't be beat that way."
"overall: tasty and simple. nothing special."
"Pours light brown, with small head. Smells of malts and nuts. Taste is very nice a combo of malts and nuty sweetness with a little bitterness at the end.It is very smooth in your mouth and leaves a nice nut flavor. I rate it 4.5 overall a very nice and different beer."
"O - a little bit different, otherwise not much to recommend."
"Picked this up on a road trip down south, might have gotten more if the abv was a bit higher, doesn't seem to have much shelf life. If it were more available to me I'd probably get it more. Oh well, enjoyable for now, certainly worth a try for any craft beer drinker."
"O: Overall a very enjoyable session beer. Well done, Lazy Magnolia!"
"Overall- This one really surprised me. I can see this becoming a summer fling."
"D: Pronounced nutty flavor is delivered by this brown ale, making it aptly named but also perhaps at some significant cost. A lack of intriguing qualities and the presence of rancid off-flavors are limiting factors here. Since the intensity of sensory qualities is respectable across the board considering the style, the sweetness and oily aspects are especially comfortable in the presence of a variety of foods."
"O: poor, poor job. change the genre and I can raise abit, but this is waaay too sweet to be good."
"Overall this is a decent English brown. The added pecan doesn't do anything amazing, maybe a slight boost to an otherwise average brown"
"The carbonation is fizzy up front, but largely settles out, giving a sweet-leaning beer the sense of mouthfeel it needs, though it still feel very thin and transparent. A bit more muscle and girth would help round this out."
"Overall: Very English tasting. This one is good not great. I was actually hoping for a bit more nut here. I could have a couple but my third favorite of the Lazy Magnolia offerings I was able to try."
"O (D) - reasonably drinkable, great smelling, not bad tasting. an ok beer for sure"
"D - pretty solid nut brown ale, the pecans added a new layer of complexity / take on the style that worked really well. I can see why this is so highly rated on this site...good stuff!"
"Pours a nice orange with some slight reddish tints. A bit of white head. Vey crisp and clear. Looks very pretty. Smells very sweet and malty. Light roast and caramel on the nose. Tastes sweet and almost banana flavored. Nice pecan as well. Vry drinkable with a nice solid mouthfeel. Vry solid"
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Mouthfeel is light, which is to be expected. The carbonation is very nicely done. Lower carbonation than I expected leads to a very smooth drinking beer. Overall, I like it quite a bit. Something that I would have again in all likelihood."
"O: Extremely easy drinking, at 4.25% it has great flavor, a great session beer. Just a really nice beer that goes down nicely."
"D: I think if the tangy notes I am picking up were a lot less prevalent I would like this better. As is I don't think this is one I would go back to"
"It is not brown, however, a glowing amber would be more accurate, but its sensuous nose of roasted pecans, earth, and some fruity esters combine into a luscious bouquet. The pecans are absolutely present in the mouf, and the beverages is easy drinking and nutty. As it warms, the roasted pecans come out even more, showing off their stuff. A quality beverage from these fine folks in Mississippi. Perhaps the only quality from there I will ever know."
"Overall, this is pretty good beer; a definite recommendation."
"The appearance is a nice pretty clear copper red with a pale sandy foam on the surface. I would think brown ales as this is labeled to be a touch darker. The aromatics are pretty sweet and malty. There isn't much but a touch of nuttiness to the back of the nose. This beer has an odd mineral taste up front, but the sweet maltiness and the nutty finish help overcome. As the beer warms from fridge temp that odd flavor goes away. The mouthfeel is pretty on target but there is a touch of acidity that really ruins the experience. Overall a good beer, something Mississippi can be proud of, but overall not really anything special."
"The CPJ"
"A little too sweet to quaff, but some great flavors."
"Overall, it's not bad at all, but it doesn't stand out either. I drink this all the time as it make as great session beer, but it also leaves a lot to be desired."
"Beer is medium to light in body and minor league sweet up front with a clean thin finish on the end of almost nothing. No aftertaste, minimal carbonation. Unoffensive mediocrity."
"The beer is a radiant shade of dark orange, with random pockets of effervescence present throughout the glass. The head is small and leaves a fair amount of lace in its wake. The aroma is subdued, with a slightly sweet malt presence and a hint of nuts, though I couldn't pinpoint pecans. The flavor is decent, with a slight malt sweetness and a bit more of the pecan aspect in the flavor than the nose. The carbonation level is slightly less than average. A decent beer, but not something of which I would want more than a pint."
"Pours a beautiful transparent red colour with about a finger and a half worth of head that disappates quickly. Lacing is below average, but that colour is so good! The smell is kinda funky, I get sweet malts and some very spicy hops, with some astringent spices. Bizarre. The taste is better, with the nutty aspects coming out quite a bit more. The sweetness and spicy hops never quite mesh though, doing a bit to drown out the (rather good) nutty, pecan flavors. The mouthfeel is coating and thick for such a low ABV brew with such a watery body. The drinkability is pretty average, I mean it goes down easily, but there's nothing here to make you go back for more. This is jut a slightly better than average nut brown, if you see this on the shelf just put it down and get Sam Smith's Nut Brown instead."
"D - A very American interpretation of an English Brown Ale. Pecans aside, this is one great brown ale with a lot of flavors going on. A good beer to show that you don't need a beer to be 10% to have a lot going on. Plus, you can drink two or three in a night. This would be a regular in my fridge if I could get it locally."
"Atmosphere is pretty good here. Appearance is a nice rich brown /red with a decent enough head. Nose has a lot going on. Grains, nuts, and sweets. Flavor is similar in character to the nose. Grain, nuts, sweets, peat... very well balanced. None of the components overpower the others. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"D- Very easy to drink. Nicely balanced beer."
"I love English Brown Ale's so in this category my expectations run high. This one was ok but did not meet my expectations."
"Overall a beer I'm glad i tried but not one i would seek out in the future."
"Drinkability- decent, mediocre. But a bit sweet for my taste."
"Drink is pretty good, very sessionable, would be a pretty good spring beer. In fact, a little too light for my tastes, but a decent beer."
"Drinkability: Meh. Not bad, but nothing I would pick up on my own. Glad I got to try it though."
"Pours a fairly-light brownish color with a small off-white head and not too much lacing or retention after that. A few bubbles on top. The nose brings forward a bit of lightly-sweetened malt, caramel, and some nutty character. The taste was about the same, mostly just general sweetness and some bread with some lingering pecan flavor. Mouthfeel was thin and water though the carbonation was fairly adequate. Okay, but nothing too special."
"Clear Brown/amber colored beer with a pretty fine white head that goes away after about 2 minutes leaving some lacing around the edges and a pretty thin film on the top. Very clear. Smell is pretty malty and balanced. Sweet and includes some nutty and caramel hints. Sweet caramel malty taste gives way to a smoked pecan bitter finish. The taste is pretty unique and very good. Light bodied with medium carbonation. It's one of my favorite fall seasonal beers and I just happened to pick one up in winter and it's still great. If I had to pick I would take the Abita Pecan but this one is good too."
"I wouldn't go out and get this outside of the MS tick or if I was there, decent."
"All in all this is a decent brown and I good step forward for craft brewing in the souh."
"D - For sure, this is a great summer ale. A nice session beer"
"Reviewed on 3/4/2010. Bottle thanks to alexsdad06. Pours a clear deep amber with a small tan head. Aroma of sweet malt, light nuttiness. Flavor is pretty sweet with some bitter hops and nutty malt in the finish. Light palate, easy drinking. A pretty decent brown ale."
"I keep giving pecan brews a chance because, in theory, it sounds like a good combination. What I keep finding, however, is that the fats in the nut do some odd things to the beer, lending a slight oilyness to the beer. This is the case with this beer - poured a pleasant light chestnut. Short-lived rather flat head. Some roasted malt flavors up front, but the nuttyness of the malt and pecan is offset by a slickness to the beer that is off-putting."
"Reddish caramel color with one finger of head that held on for a good while before settling to a thick cap. Not much for lacing is left on the glass. Unique color but otherwise not that exciting looking. Aroma of caramel and nuts that combined, gives a true toffee note that is unmistakeable. A touch of earthiness completes the aroma. The flavor is on the sweeter side and I would of liked some darker malts and less caramel malt to compliment the nuttiness, but otherwise a pretty good English brown ale. I do not detect any roastiness from the pecans. Light body and nicely carbonated. Suitable for a low ABV, lighter flavored beer. A good English style brown ale that is very easy to drink."
"This is one of my favorites. It has such a great style about it. Once i poured it into my glass and took a sniff or two it was heaven. It has a really sweet nutty smell to it. The pecans really work well into this brew. The head was somewhat foamy and dissipated rather quickly which was sad. But the taste made up for it 4 times over. It starts off real malty and the the finish is nice and sweet. No disappointments at all other than the head."
"D-- Quite drinkable. Excellent fall or early winter beer. Had this last year when in New Orleans and really liked it. Easy to have multiple bottles of and not get full of or tired of."
"D- This is one of the better brown ales I have had. Very good flavors and great mouthfeel make this a winner. At the current ABV I could see myself having no problem putting away a few of these. Makes me wish this was available to me all the time."
"Pours a medium/dark reddish brown with two fingers of light tan head. Smells are sweet malt, some pecans. Tastes are sweet, wasn't expecting that! I can taste nuts, sweet malts, and more nuts, pretty interesting. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is kinda low, i could only drink maybe 2 of these in a sitting, pretty damn sweet. Overall an interesting beer and I'm really glad i had the chance to have a bottle."
"As far as nut browns go, this is pretty good. Not the top of the heap but very drinkable. And I don't even like pecans!"
"Pours a clean copper to deep orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet nuttiness and caramel hints. In the taste, kind of like sweet tea and a small hint of nuts. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry nut presence in the aftertaste. OK, small nut and very English like."
"Southern Pecan is a straightforward brown that I could drink a few of. Solid brew."
"12oz. bottle courtesy of injuredreserve served in a standard pint glass. Pours a deep, translucent, brownish-copper with a loose, off-white head the quickly disperses into a thin broken band around the edges and a soapy slick across the middle. No lacing on this one. Nose is malty, earthy sweet and nutty with a hint of brown sugar and/or molasses. Taste follows nose - flavor profile starts out as you would expect an English Brown to express; however, towards the middle and back an earthy, slightly acidic quality comes out, and the pecans finally assert themselves. Mouthfeel is light-medium (but closer to light) with a lively carbonation. Really quite flavorful for the style and abv; however, the pecans start to get to you after a while."
"Thanks to injuredreserve for the trade!"
"Poured a clear, coppery amber with minimal head that quickly bubbled away. A malty nose that invoked a brown sugary autumn/Oktoberfest ale. Some nuttiness there, though I might not think ""pecan"" if I didn't already know. The smell translated cleanly into the taste, which was malty and somewhat sweet with a pleasant nuttiness to make things a little more interesting. A fine mouthfeel that's neither clean nor clingy; it fits this beer. I'd be happy to have it in my rotation of fall beers, but it's not the first I'd reach for."
"All in all, this is an ok brew. Not much special. Maybe good to try once if you have access. Otherwise, avoid."
"Overall, a nice, solid nut brown ale. Tasty, but not very memorable. I liked all the components and I would definitely drink this again, but not good enough to seek out on its own."
"D-For a session ale it's really decent. Big aroma and good taste. Not too complex. I could enjoy a few of thes at a nice BBQ."
"I definitely recommend at least trying it. Nothing too special, but highly enjoyable."
"Pour is a pretty-clear amber. Looks like a dark amber ale or an Octoberfest brew. Aroma is malty, a lot like an o-fest brew. There's a good bit of dark sugar in there, like a good English brown. Taste is nice, light and malty; a nice sweetness, some brown sugar before a subdues hop presence keeps the brew balanced. Hard to pick out the pecan taste, but there a definite nuttiness. Definitely a sessionable brown ale here; not quite the rival of Sam Smith's, but a pretty darn good brew."
"Medium body with a creamy feel. Very easy to drink."
"D - This is the only place where I can fault this beer in a major way. I can't drink a lot of it. 12 oz will probably be plenty for me."
"D-I think this beer would be much better with just a little more carbonation. I'm wondering if the beer just hasn't had enought time to condition in the bottle."
"This beer hasn't put me off of Lazy Magnolia and I'm interested to see what their other offerings can bring to the table."
"Not as good as I was hoping, but not bad. Could have been a little sweeter. A fine beer to chill and have a six pack of but there's much better nut browns to be found."
"Shiftless magnolias! This brew pours a clear red amber topped by at best a half-finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises biscuits, toffee, caramel, rye bread, a touch of sugar, and a decent mixture of flowers and greens. The taste holds notes of brown sugar, very light maple syrup, walnuts, caramel, hot cinnamon, and an undercurrent of citrus hops, leaning toward the orange-y side of that spectrum. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a very fluid feel. Overall, a solid brew, one that I could see chain-drinking on a nice Southern summer night."
"D: extremely drinkable. would make a great dessert or session beer."
"At the Flying Saucer in Memphis, TN. Poured a reddish-brown with one finger of white, decent retention, and good lacing. Modest visible carbonation. Smell consisted of sweet maple syrup, caramel, brown sugar, and almond/amoretto. The taste was sweet blend of nuttiness (hazelnut, pecan?) and caramel/maltiness, with a sweet finish, and a nutty aftertaste. Again, the key word here is balanced. Unique flavor profile, and very pleasant. Smooth, not overly-carbonated, medium body. A little too sweet to session, but a great beer."
"Loved this beer, and I'm saddened that I saw it for the first time in Nashville it probably won't see it anytime soon in DC. Whether for session, taste, refreshment, whatever... this beer will give you what you need."
"Solid brown ale."
"D= Insanely drinkable. This is one of the better session beers I have ever had...I could easily kill a six pack before I knew what happened."
"Think we got one from a bad line: Served with a small, off white head and some lace. Color was a clear, amber brown. Aroma ( my snooter don't work so well, so I think I'm able to give this beer a better, but inconsistant score compared to other qualities) is decent with bananas, brown fruit, caramel, toffee, and malt. Flavor is absolutely DOMINATED by bleach, + the traditional nut brown flavors. It was hard to focus on the other aspects of the beer because of the bleach. My friend couldn't drink it either."
"some smooth body to this in my mouth. quite drinkable, but not my favorite."
"D: Easy drinking, light body brown ale here. Good, but nothing memorable. A little sweet to drink too many of these."
"A drinkable beer, a little too light of a brown ale for me."
"Got this while visiting NOLA. Yeah, we don't get this beer in Charleston, so I figured why not. Anyway, it had a nice malty smell, with a caramel/peacan quality interlaced. Taste was similar, but the caramel/peacan taste coated the back of the palate, thus giving it a pleasant finish. It was a perfect nightcap for the humid and hot night, very refreshing. I was glad I tried this one, might have to pick up a 6er before I leave."
"Overall, one of the better examples of the style that I've had in terms of taste."
"D- Above average only because of the disperation of a pecan flavor in the beer and it's easy to drink"
"Body feels a bit lighter than medium. Stinging carbonation. Very sessionable at just over 4%. Not particularly memorable, but solid nonetheless."
"Pours to clear, reddish brown color and thin off-white head with minimal lacing - forgivable for having oily nuts in it. Aroma is sweet caramel malt, and slight hint of chocolate and nuts. Flavor is sweet, malty and slightly nutty with a pecan-like finish. Pecan bitterness and hops balance out the malts. I could tell there are pecans in it after a while because my tongue had that certain feeling I get from eating pecans. Overall, this is a clean, tasty brown ale on the sweet side with no off-flavors or technical miscues. The nut flavor and aroma really shines through as it warms up a bit. It is very easy to drink and would be a year-round favorite if it were available in my area."
"Drinkability - very much so!"
"Nut brown is not my favorite style, but this is a very interesting interpretation. Well worth a try."
"O A good drinking brown ale, Definiyely worth trying, especially if you like brown ales. Needed more carbonation! "
"D. Really easy drinking beer - made for the masses but still enjoyable enough for a BA. Reminds me of some English brown ales that are on the market. Enjoyed and would drink again when visiting Mississippi."
"Comments: A beer of the month selection. It is distinguished as a beer that involves the pecans in the fermentation process, rather than introducing them merely to add aroma. It works for me!"
"I could drink a few of these. It's not so heavy like a lot of browns, that I feel like one and done. I got this from the Beer of the Month club, but if this were available in Virginia, I'd pick up a six-pack pretty quickly."
"A clean amber beer with copper highlights. Has a small off white head, no lace. A light fruit aroma with a caramel malt note in the background. Toffee and light nut like esters make up the flavor. A nut skin like bitterness on the finish. I didn't really have pecans jump right out. But that would be silly."
"certainly serviceable, especially at 4.25 abv."
"Overall: Would be an excellent desert beer or a good session beer. I can't think of many beers that are fit for both."
"D - This is really quite a nice brown ale, good example of the style. It's too bad I don't have more, because this would session very nicely"
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with medium carbonation that's on the smooth and watery side, and it has a slight bitter finish that's on the dry side. This is a highly drinkable beer that is a very tasty nut brown ale. A solid beer."
"This flag ship beer marks new territory in Mississippi. The obvious nutty aspects pair with the light body, and easy drinkability to create an afternoon brown ale. With decent head retention, the nose never escapes a sip. Very clear in it's light brown color, a pint can be gone in an instant. Flavors outside of the nutty malts are vague, but present."
"Another unique Deep South selection from BOTMC, lets give it a whirl. Popping the top this brew does smell like a pecan pie. Brown sugar, spices and pecans. Pours into a pint with a foamy three finger small bubble head. Colour is an orangeish bonze. Taste of this brew is outstanding. Nice malt sweetness but not overly sweet, balanced by a chaulky but not bitter hopping followed with a nice nuttiness and a semi sweet aftertaste with a hint of bitterness. This is not all unlike a pecan pie but not as sweet. For a nut brown ale this hits the mark and is one of the better examples out there. With the taste of this brew combined with a 4.25 ABV this is a session brew without a doubt. I will buy if available here locally."
"D: Actually, there's not a lot of pecan or nuttiness flavor as you would expect. BOMC says that pecans are used as fermenting agent, not as a flavoring agent. I'd prefer a little more carbonation, but outside that a very solid enjoyable beer."
"The Southern Pecan pours an amber/copper color with a very small white head that leaves no trace behind. Aromas are dominated with sweet nuts. Some malts and sweet syrup are also present. Taste is woody and sweet. Some nut characteristics that linger and finish off the palate. Up front it is sweet syrup and malts. Mouthfeel is fairly thin. Drinkability is pretty solid. This beer taste much different than any other I have tried before and the uniqueness attracts me to it. New brewery for me and a very good first impression."
"This is a medium bodied beer that's starts off good and ends good but the middle burnt flavor kinda turned me off. All in all a descent beer. Not quite sure I would call it an English Brown Ale. Maybe it could be a spin off? ""Southern Brown Ale""? For some reason I imagined myself drinking this in an old cabin deep in the Mississippi woods. Worth a try for something different. High drinkability."
"Very easy to drink, goes down smooth with a milky quality."
"D - Refreshing, but in the sense that it is more of a nutty flavored water than a beer."
"This is a nice beer to try. I love seeing southern brewers making good and getting their beer distributed. The flavors are good without being too aggressive and would be a good transition beer for BMC drinkers. On a side note, I blended one of these with a Sweetwater IPA and got a sum was better than the parts. The increased carbonation and hops in the IPA helped the problems with Southern Pecan by itself and still showcased the pecans well. Try it at least once and you will not be disappointed."
"I may just have my new favorite beer."
"D-I was very excited to try this beer. About what I expected. A little more body would do wonders for this beer...not much..just a little...not saying it needs to be porter like or anything but it comes off as a little watery....great aroma...that is the highpoint...reminds me a little of the old Longshot Hazelnut Brown of about 1996 or so..."
"This is one I will revisit once my extreme beer quest calms!"
"Drinkability - An easy drinker this one. Would be good as a spring/fall offering. A bit too sweet for a summer drinker."
"D - This beer is not for the first time beer drinker, but is wonderful for someone looking for a alternative to the typical, middle of the road ale"
"The taste was a lot like a very nice brown ale that had disolved some maple nut goodies candies into it. I love brown ales and I love maple nut candies. If you don't like either, don't get this."
"drinkability: solid but not the best I have had"
"D: This is a session beer if ever I'd had one. Ultimately, the roast of the pecans might be more overwhelming than anything else in the beer. I'm happy with my six-pack, and will pick up more the next time I'm in the south."
"-Bye"
"This one won awards for a reason. It testifies to balancing style and flavor. It could only use some improvement on the head build. A beer designed to be enjoyed specifically for its flavor, not confound the senses with complexness."
"D - This is real easy to drink... because there is hardly any flavor. It doesn't taste bad it just tastes like it is lacking. I have tried a variety of brown ales lately so I believe I know the style even if it isn't my favorite I can enjoy brown ales. I have a 6 pack of this and if this bottle was bad for some reason then I will re write this review. I will also check to see that this isn't way past its expiration date. I don't ever remember being so disappointed by a beer with such a good rating."
"D = This was highly enjoyable. If I could get this in the midwest, I would drink it often."
"I don't think I would drink this again, just because it's not my style. A person must decide for themselves I thought this to be okay."
"Drinkability is well goes down pretty quick like a bit more body in my brown ales but this isn't bad at all. Not a go to beer but wouldn't turn it down."
"Overall a very nice ale with a classic style that is accented nicely with nut notes."
"Comments: A nice representative of the brown ale style, which is one of my favorite styles. I personally prefer a little more mildness in a brown, but this ain't too bad."
"Average looking brown color with a slight head. Low aroma-somewhat nutty and biscuity. Nice malty flavor with a distinct nutty flavor. Somewhat bready and biscuity. Nice lingering sweetness against the nutty flavor. Very full flavored for the lower abv. Nice body to match. Have wanted to try this for a long while and it has lived up to my self imposed hype. Very nice beer-great session beer for this kid."
"D - Light in abv, very drinkable. Overall very sweet and I almost felt like I was drinking a liquid pecan pie."
"Light copper color in the glass with a thin head. Nose has some unexpected aromas that are somewhat funky-herbal, almost like a weird mushroom or something. Caramel flavors are present on the palate with that interesting herbal hop quality in the balance. Something atypical about this IPA but hard to pin down."
"D - Nice and sessionable, and a good intro to the style. I like the flavor profile, very similar to many other much heavier beers."
"Light toasted nuts, crispy grains, syrupy caramel malts. Only a hint of apple hoppiness after the drink. Sryupy, sticky feel and would be viscous is not for being somewhat flat."
"A very nice brown ale that drinks easily and quickly. The pecan adds a unique touch."
"M/D- light/medium body with ample carbonation for the style. the carb. makes it especially crisp for a brown ale. the low ABV and subtle flavors make this an excellent session brew. very easy drinking."
"tastes up front has some sweetness to it, more of a malt or carmel, and some roasted nutty flavor. i really could not pick up on the pecans, but hey maybe i need another. cheers."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, this was an easy drinking and delicious beer. The pecan flavor was unlike anything I ever tasted in a beer and it was very flavorful but not overpowering."
"Cheers!"
"D – I would drink quite a few of these, given the opportunity."
"Overall a very easy drinking beer. I think I took three or four gulps and it was gone. I wish I could get this beer by the case load. Great session beer."
"This was a tasty brown ale. Easily drinkable and pleasant."
"Overall this is a nicely done beer, and my first from the state of Mississippi."
"Pours a clear, red/copper color. 1/3 inch head of an off-white coor. Decent retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, toffee sweetness, and slight citrus (raisin). Fits the style of an English Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slight creamy with an average carbonation level. Tastes of toffee, sweet malt, slight hops, and slight nut or caramel. Overall, too sweet for me."
"(D)- An interesting idea for a beer, but there is really nothing I like about this beer. Too disjointed and sugary to enjoy."
"Taste of heavy roasted pecan from the start, roasted brown sugar. Light english hop presence, very light chocolate malt flavor. After Tommyknocker Maple Nut brown ale, this may be the second most 'nutty' flavored beer that I have had. Definitely a good brew and one that would not be too difficult to put a number down of. Low abv with this much flavor is definitely a plus and not something that is easily done. Great job by LM brewing"
"Thanks to my uncle for bringing this one back from Mississippi - 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. Brewed with whole roasted pecans, Maris Otter, crystal malts and wheat, and hopped with Magnum and Tettnang. It pours a dark reddish hue, with medium carbonation and a half-inch of light tan head that reduces to a collar. Decent looking, but doesn't quite look like a brown ale. Malty sweet aroma, with light pecan, just a touch of aroma hops, chocolate malt, and a bit of an aged vinous character. Malts dominate the palate, with pecan flavors increasing as it warms, perhaps even masquerading as malty notes. There is a bit of sweetness, a mild hop bitterness and perhaps some chocolate malt on top of a light, crisp and tingly body that smooths out very well. This is a unique, easy to drink brown ale, but you really have to let it warm up to let all the nuances come through, despite the recommended serving temperature of 43 degrees."
"The aroma is sweet toasted malt. At first I didn't find much nuttiness, but as it warmed caramel coated pecans started to come through (or maybe it was just my perception). Light and thin tasting brown ale, but a unique nutty flavor. You can taste roasted pecans, so it doesn't need to be really heavy. Moderately sweet caramel is more prominent than any hop bitterness, but it still works well. The mouthfeel is light, good carbonation, a very drinkable beer."
"D - The pecan gives the flavor more of a, ""whats going on..."" interest than a, ""wow, this is good, what is it?"" Not a huge fan, but its not bad, just really different. It would go great with pecan pie!"
"D = This goes down smoothly and lightly inviting more drinks. A very easy drinking brown ale."
"M&D - super crisp and refreshing, a great flavor combination, delicately sweet, great malt profile, super drinkable, one of the better session beers i have ever head"
"Slightly watered down medium body with some soft carbonation up front followed by a roasted malty backbone with a touch of syrupy sweetness and a slightly dry subtle hop finish. Lots of sweet caramel and rye malts but the dominating flavor is roasted nut, especially pecan and hazelnut. Possibly a bit too sweet and syrupy but the roasted nut character provides a nice balance that makes this a pretty drinkable decent session beer."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with low to medium carbonation, very drinkable."
"This beer surprised me. It's slightly one-dimensional, but I'm impressed at how well they balanced the pecan flavor with the base beer; it's prominent but not overwhelming to the point of detracting from the foundation. I'd drink this often if it were locally available."
"I got this from piginapen. I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my SA perfect pint glass. It pours a light clear red with a sticky little white head. The aroma is full of sweet malts. The flavor is caramel and roasted nuts with a sweet lingering finish. The beer is light bodied and the carbonation is a bit low, but still OK. The beer really is a great session brew."
"D: I probably am understating the drinkability on this, but I rarely mark niche flavored beers too high on the drinkability. Still, next time I happen across a sixer of this, it is on!"
"I like this quite a bit more in the bottles....this seems much sweeter and a little cloying here..."
"d- really nice, much better than i thought it was going to be, i wish this was a local for me, this is a perfect fall beer, i'm gonna have to seek out another trade for some more of this, mmmm."
"Pours a medium brown color with a small tan head that quickly disappears. Smell is malty - a mix of malty sweetness and roasted malt. The flavor is malty, with some nutty flavor as well. A very drinkable beer that is a great example of a nut brown ale. Highly recommended."
"I thought this was one of the better versions of a style that I typically avoid. The pecans and the citrus hops give it a good flavor. Would recommend this one."
"D - Good drinking beer, even if it is a little on the sweet side."
"Drying yet quenching at the same time - sort of like chilled mineral water. Lower ABV than I am used to in general - but this might make a nice session beer if you have ready access to it. Really happy to get a chance to try this beer."
"The mouth is a little thinner than I would like. Lacks carbonation play on the tongue. This is much more mellow in flavor than the scent would lead me to believe. This is sweet, but not cloying at all. Very well-balanced with a sweet start, and a nice warm bready finish. Hints of roasted pecans throughout, but nothing overpowering. I could have a few of these for sure, and thanks to the great trade with Christopher, I just may!"
"D and overall impression: I could session this beer. I liked the flavors the pecans imparted, it wasn't over the top, just nice. Overall, I think this is a fine offering. Something that goes well with the changing of the season. Will being buying agian. Skal."
"Drinkability: Thin mouthfeel, ample carbonation, and a really low abv makes this one a session brew to say the least. If the flavor was a bit more rewarding I would have given it a 5.0 in this department."
"I wanted more pecan, but it's still a fine beer... although I feel this is merely a good first attempt at trying to redefine a style that is somewhat boring and formulaic. For that, Lazy Magnolia deserves some recognition."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smooth and a bit creamy even. Good carbonation makes for high drinkability here. A winner for a session brew in my book, I found myself drinking a lot of this when I was on vacation down south. If available this is one I would have stocked in the fridge."
"D - extremely drinkable, easily one of the better brown ales I have had. Wish I could get some in Pennsylvania"
"A good sessionable beer for the cooler months, I imagine."
"Thanks Freethyhops!"
"Very tasty, got some sweet nuttiness to it with some sweet toasty notes. Very tasty and I really like this taste. Awesome beer for a new beer drinker. Again, an excellent surprise from Mississippi!"
"I would probably try this again paired with a meal, but on its own it just didn't do it for me."
"This beer was great, but I wonder if I'm the only one wishing for a Pecan Pie Stout. Perhaps with a hint of cream. A man can dream."
"D - A very nice, malty brown ale. There is a very convincing roasted nut quality to this beer; a combination of candied pecans and peanuts. The sweetness is a bit much and sticks to the palate, but nonetheless it is a unique beer that is well worth trying."
"D - This is a really smooth beer. Low, sessionable alcohol level and low/moderate bitterness make this go down really easy. This is a beer for the long haul. Could easily have several in a session."
"I was very excited to see this beer and brewery make their way in to Florida."
"D - This one is tasty and goes down pretty quick."
"Not bad, but nothing special either. An easy drinking beer at a pub. Nothing more."
"On tap at the Flying Saucer Memphis. Copper body served with a thin ring of off-white foam clinging to the edge of the glass. Aroma of brown sugar, molasses, and a slightly grassy note. Flavor starts lightly sweet and fades with a bit of bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of bakers chocolate. Bitterness gradually becomes more medicinal. Mouthfeel is middle of the road. Drinkability would be good if it weren't for the lingering aftertaste."
"D: This is one I'd buy a case of and drink. An excellent brown ale."
"First time I've given a beer uniform ratings. I found it to be just above average in every category. Poured a hazy, brownish red with caramel head that faded quick and left no lacing. Smelled nutty, with caramel malts and slight bit of hops. Tasted the same with a little bit more hops and a roasty finish. Pretty smooth, just ever so slightly oily. Overall a good session beer, great for having with a meal, too."
"A good brew. Quite drinkable."
"I am going to let this warm a bit and see if I can get any other flavors from it. Its very tasty stuff and I'm glad I got to give it a try."
"A very sessionable brew as expected with its 4% alcohol."
"Pours a very light and clear ruby color with a bit of a struggle to get the head to form. Aroma is minimal but a nice and refreshing. Had a hopy and sweet malt aroma to it with a hint of pecan. The taste was very light and refreshing. Flavor was not sacrificed wich was a great thing for a low Alcohol level brew with such a light body. Flavor was great and not over whelming on any level. The Hops/malt balanced nice and the subtle flavors behind were nice. Drinkability is pretty high due to low Alcohol, light body, Would love to have this again and will pick it up when I am around the state."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and flat."
"D - If you don't like butterscotch and cow's butter diacetyl flavors then you probably wont care for this. I, however, have been known to shoot little tubs of coffee creamer whilst waiting for breakfast at any given diner, and used to eat sticks of butter like candy bars as soon as my three year old hands were able to open the 'fridge door. This is probably a love it or hate it sort of brew and I love it!"
"Sweet pecan nutty aftertaste leaving a very smooth undercurrent of nutty malty goodness in your mouth. It tastes like someone took a big spoonful of pecan butter and smeared it on the roof of your mouth. Excellent session beer."
"D- This beer is a nice built nut brown ale with some subtle complexity and a soft hop support but I don't know if I would get pecans out of it if it wasn't printed on the label."
"overall - There's not a lot of pecan, but there's just enough to compliment this well done brown ale. Good for casually drinking after a long day, when you just want something simple and slightly dessert-like."
"Pours nice deep amber brown color with a small white head that fell quickly with no lacing. Lightly sweet aroma with a hint of caramel and nuttiness. Flavor is right on with the nose, light caramel, a hint of nuts, light bitterness, dry on the finish. Medium mouthfeel, good carbonation. This is a good, very drinkable beer, but I'm not getting very much pecan flavor. Tasty, though and glad I had the chance to try it. Thanks go out to deepsouth for the extra!"
"D: This is a very good brown ale, goes down very easy and given the alcohol, you can reach for another without a problem, an ideal session beer. Very recommended. I wish I could get this in KY."
"Pours a brilliantly clear light brown. Bubbles almost fizzy - very large. Head drops quickly (maybe cause there's pecans in there?) Smells malty, but right now that's all I got probably due to the bottle being so cold. Taste is very nice - have to search for the pecans and there is a slight burnt taste upfront but overall a sweet, good tasting beer. Mouthfeel is not as fizzy as I expected from the pour."
"This beer pours a reddish brown with a small almost nonexistant head that quickly disapears. The smell is sweet with roasted malts and some nuttyness. The mouthfeel is light to medium body and a little chewyness. The taste is a tad to sweet for me with carmalized sugar and a nutty finish. Drinkability is decent. I enjoyed this beer, and am glad I tried it. it. Im just not a fan of beers this sweet."
"I'm very grateful for Nelson including a second bottle of this. I highly recommed this to brown ale and session beer lovers."
"Taste leans heavily towards smoked nuts...pretty amazing pecan flavor that makes it worth trying just for that. 5.0 on the novelty scale. A bit one dimensional and definitely under carbonated, but this is a one of a kind beer that is easily enjoyable. Did not take me long to roll through a 6-pack."
"D- I could drink a couple of these in a row. This would be a good beer on a hot day. I wouldn't drink this after having drank another beer. I feel like the flavor would be lost on a dirty palate."
"Bottle: Poured a clear brown color ale with a rather large foamy head with good retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of caramel malt with some light sweet toffee notes. Taste is dominated by quite rich caramel malt notes with a nice malt presence with no discernable hops presence. I can't say I really detected any pecans though kudos for trying something different."
"This was a great beer, it honestly tastes amazing and is very easy to drink."
"T + M + D: Pecan, certainly, along with a nice and soft malt profile. Both offer a subtle sweetness that doesn't overpower, but makes for a nice experience. A quick little sting of carbonation lasts for just moments before smoothing out for the finish. With the low alcohol content, it would make for a good session choice."
"Overall: The mouth feel is carbonated and slightly creamy. The body of the beer is medium. The finish is bitter and wonderful. This beer is a descent beer that I would have like to seen."
"This beer is not excellent. It's just above average, almost good. But it takes me back such that it just reminds me of home... The home I'll never return to, the state of mind that I had on those warm days under the pecan trees in my childhood. Life is too fast. Drink one of these, and try to slow down. Remember what it was like when you were young... and long for the country in the summer."
"This would be a great session beer. Low ABV, which is undetectable, when drinking. Good, smooth and easy to drink."
"After about month of enjoying this beer, I have moved it into my mythical ""top five"". Ok, maybe I'm a little prejudiced since this beer is made in the hometown of Brett Favre and right down the road from Baton Rouge. Nonetheless, it doesn't take being a southern boy to appreciate a great beer when we drink one. Here's to all you Yanks who don't mind crossing the Mason-Dixon line to try this one out!"
"Overall, the beer was slightly abover average. I would probably drink it again, but maybe not until it gets a little warmer in the summer."
"D: How do I go on? Simply put, I'd rather see this on every shelf that now holds newcastle."
"D: Very easy going down. A summer beer for sure."
"12oz bottle courtesy of deepsouth, thanks man! Nice brown-red color, good head and lacing. Smells sweet and tastes nutty and sweet at the same time. This was far too easy to drink on a lazy Saturday afternoon. This was an interesting brown ale and I believe my first beer from Mississippi."
"D - Very low abv, very unoffensive. Easy session if ever there was."
"D- Easy to drink, but kinda strange how it is so much like a tea."
"HV"
"Pours a reddish amber with a bubbly off white head that sticks around for a while. Smell is sweet and malty. I pick up caramel and brown sugar, slight nuttiness as it warms. Taste is sweet with malts a bit of a nuttiness in the background. Body is medium to thin, mouthfeel is creamy/bubbly, carbonation is a bit on the high side. Would make a decent enough session beer, but nothing really remarkable."
"M & D: beer feels more like a light beer, but that also makes it more drinkable."
"O- Very drinkable. For something a little different than ""mainstream"" browns, this is very drinkable, and in the right situation it would be sessionable too. Actually, would be a great beer for with a burger."
"Very relaxing and flavorful brown! Tastes of brown sugar, mild vanilla and toned down pecan pie. All meld well together and LMSP is very balanced. None of that tea-like flavor that most English style browns tend to have (I think that's a good thing). Hearty, creamy mouthfeel. Nice low abv. This would make for some great summer porch drinking--a new fav."
"Drinkability is superior to many beers in it's class. Macro and craft beer drinker appeal. It's interesting, but simple enough to drink a bunch of without overanalyzing. A good beer for parties, sessions, and fans of malty brews. Thanks and cheers!"
"D - If this is indeed an American Brown Ale (I'm not convinced after tasting it), it's lacking some hop character and a bit more malt to be a good example of the style. Though styles aside, this is a very tasty brown and I could easily enjoy a couple more. Cheers to PerzentRizen for the generous trade!"
"A solid, refreshing offering that goes down easy. Low ABV and smooth feel make this an ideal session beer. Being from Louisiana, I'm somewhat obligated to have some Abita offerings throughout the year, but sorry guys...Lazy Magnolia has you beat when it comes to pecan brown ales. Definitely worth a try when you're down south."
"Very drinkable, I could drink these all night long if I didn't want to save a few for later!"
"Drinkability: This is a great brown ale. For not being a BIG beer, there is a lot of aroma and flavor. I picked up more nuttiness as the beer warmed, especially in the nose. Smooth and satisfying. Worth seeking out."
"Having had some other beers brewed by LM, I'm starting to think that they might be a bit inconsistent or maybe they need to investigate their distribution/freshness."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, it is exciting that many MS bars have this on tap, great session beer. Stopped after one because it needed more body."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, smoth and a bit oily and a bit on the fizzy side with carbonation but not unpleasantly so. All in all a very nice brown ale, very drinkable. Being from the South I've been wanting to try more Southern breweries and Lazy Magnolia did not disappoint me with their Southern Pecan which seems to be a peculiarly Southern style of beer."
"Drinkability: A very solid beer, and as a Georgia boy originally I'm enjoyin' it a whole bunch. It's nutty without being over the top, is well balanced, and is very low in alcohol - very sessionable. And it's from Mississippi! Recommended."
"This has a subtle strength to it but drinks quite easily and with cleanliness and huskiness. Doesn't need to be a dessert beer at all...this is solid and sessionable. Good stuff!"
"This is highly drinkable, and as the only ""local"" brew, it remains a staple in my home."
"D - This is a very good session beer all the way it has a good taste thats easy to drink worth trying if you can get it"
"Bottle thanks to Joe, my first beer from Mississippi. Pours a very pleasant amber red/brown/color with a medium off white head. I really love the aroma; pecan pie, very sweet, loads of toasted malts, and caramel, but very strong pecan notes What an aroma, pure goodness The flavor is pretty sweet; loads of rich caramel, toasted malts, a light hop bitterness that is refreshing, and light vestiges of pecans. More of a roasted nut flavor. A medium and smooth mouthfeel. Very nice. Leaves your palate clean and with a bit of sweetness."
" This is the first pecan flavored nut brown that I have ever had and I have to say that it's pretty decent. The aroma is slightly sweet and the pecan flavor which I expected to be bitter was actually a little sweet as well. As was stated before me, this is a particularly southern beer, something that I would like to see more of. My friends back in Tennessee are going to be excited when I bring this home with me."
"D - I really enjoyed this one, only regret is that La can't make a pecan brew like this one! will have much more of this in the future"
"Drinkability: An interesting take on a brown ale. The nuttiness of the pecans is a nice addition to the already present nut flavor from the malt."
"All in all a really nice twist on a classic style."
"The body is moderate with a light carbonation. A good sweetness that isn't over attenuated. Overall a good base but would like more of a pecan flavor/aroma."
"M/D - very drinkable in my book, the only problem is the nutty sweetness can become overpowering after a few. very nice beer though."
"Pours a slightly hazy dark ice tea color with a shallow wispy off white head that fades quickly, leaving spotty lacing patterns. The smell is nice; very unique. The nose is sweet and malty and the pecans are quite apparent. The flavor reminds me of those little hand-sized gooey pecan pies. The mouth feel is a sturdy medium body that finishes with a smooth rich caramel after taste that lingers appropriately. A really fine nut brown ale that's quite drinkable."
"Pours a very clear dark brown with some red and gold hues. A fairly light head crowns the beer. First sip is very light on the body with a nutty bitterness dominating. No doubt about the low alcohol as I can’t help but think how good this would as an Imperial Nut Brown Ale. It would pair well with some 5 or 6 year old gouda. For the style it is quite good. For me, I need a bigger bang."
"Not sure if I found myself a bottle that was a bit off... from the pour it acted up, wanted to do its own thing, etc. As it settled down, like a young black lab, it became more approachable. A good beer, would like to try it again"
"Overall this is a very distinct beer and I'm glad I finally got to try it. Definitely worth a try, and thanks again to ShrLSU."
"Decent nut brown, this time with real nuts."
"Muddy light brown, kinda the color of pecan pie. Faint scent, caramel and roasty. Caramel malt and nutty flavor, pecans only contributing a slight sweetness particular to the nut. Pretty subdued with a gentle bitterness tickling the tongue as the dry finish arrives. Medium body and lightly carbonated, a tiny bit slick at the end. Decent, easy drinking brown right on par with Abita's similar offering, perhaps a little better in the mouthfeel. Cheers to RblWthACoz for the bottle"
"poures a thin redish brown color with a three finger yellowish head on it that slowley disapers. the smell is hops and caned corn. the taste is a tuch to bitter for me, the pecan gets lost for me. the flavor is hops some rich malt and cerail grans, this is smoth like a cream ale and some earthey tones come in at the end. this is far better as it warms. this is a beer that i am glad to have tryed but not in a real hury to get more"
"Pours a clear red-brown with an off-white head that lasts quite a while. Decent lacing. Smells of sweet toasty malt and a pronounced nuttiness. Some brown sugar comes through as well. Taste is slightly stronger, with a lot of malt, and a strong pecan presence. Slightly sweet, overall. A nice, flavorful beer for the gravity."
"Update: Had a much better experience -- a bottle packed with a bit more flavor and, I dare say, more smiles. Score bump!"
"Thanks, BuckeyeNation, for my first Mississippi brew!"
"A nice drinking brown ale. Definietly nutty, but not as much pecan character as I had anticipated."
"Big ups to BA RblwthACoz for another tasty hookup!"
"Pours medium to pale caramel color with garnet highlights and displays a tan crown that dissipates quickly. Pleasantly sweet aroma of roasted nuttiness and a soft fruitiness. Rustic bread crust, roasted pecans, maple syrup, and light caramel along with balanced hop bitterness help round out the flavor profile. Not much carbonation and a medium bodied mouthfeel. An outstanding ale that is amazingly drinkable. When in Oxford, Mississippi, head to Murff's and get a pint of this brew with a Muff Burger and fried egg."
"d: really interesting with good tasty and sweet malty notes"
"Light-medium in body, smooth and a little sticky. Nice level of carbonation. Great drinkability - after finishing one I would have definitely had another. A beer brewed with nuts that is done right."
"Thanks to yesferro for the trade (which arrived about 4 hours ago...hehe...)"
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Boulevard Smokestack goblet. This beer pours a dark, nutty brown with a nice 2 inch head that melted into a thin rim around the glass. The aroma is nutty up front, with notes of roasted malts. The taste is much the same. It is very straight forward. I definitely get the pecan. This beer almost tastes like shelled pecans. The mouthfeel is pretty light for its color. I was a bit surprised. This is a really sessionable beer. I would love to try it on cask."
"On-Tap at the magic mushroom over in Auburn, AL on work a few weeks back. I had several of these, and the notes I have written right here say ""nuttier newcastle"". Which is an apt description for this beer. It's a light tawny brown/auburn with a small whispy head of off-white. Aromas of caramel and malt, with a bit of the pecan nuttiness. Taste comes through in the same vein. Sweet, caramelly, and nutty with a nice smooth mouthfeel and a good drinkability...Certainly decent for down-a-this-way"
"I've heard many MS BAs talk Lazy Magnolia up, so I decided to pick up a sixer of this--the only LM beer available in bottles--on my way to S. Carolina. The smell is nutty, of course, but pecans are not the only nut scent, there are others. Lots of malts, caramel. Taste is nutty, and again, malty, buttery, an oddly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is sticky, rather flat. This is a pretty good beer, a lot like Newcastle but slightly nuttier."
"Mouthfeel is where that carbonation comes back to hurt it. Almost like a Pop Rocks in soda kinda feel. Very effervescent. Low abv and good flavor makes this one a easy drinker. Have to see if the other bottles have the carbonation issue that this one has...hopefully not. Thanks, Brian!"
"D: The ale is surprisingly mild, just 4%. The nuttiness is the best feature and I'd glad to have another one in the fridge."
"This one could use a little more body. Its kind of thin and wispy. Creamy mouthfeel but the body just isnt there. I know that doesnt make sense but thats what it is. I am normally not a fan of brown ales but this was a real treat. This would be great while enjoying a cool fall evening watching football or after raking leaves."
"An inch of spicey light tan head quickly fades to a skim in about a minute. Body is a deep attractive brown. Nose is hugely malty and very sweet with a balance of even nuttiness. A mellow richness rushes the senses with a tingling nutty feel. Big carmalized sweetness is sticky thick all the way through the palate. They were shooting for a nut brown ale and they hit it right on the nose, although it may be a little to sweet for some. Mouthfel sticks with the thick nutty sweet feel. Nicely drinkable."
"Drinkability- The thin mouthfeel and the complex flavors do make for quite the drinkable brew. The flavors are very pleasant and I could fly through a sixer of this and not even be drunk, which is great considering the amount of flavor. I wonder what a vanilla ice cream float would taste like using this beer? Wish I had more so I could try."
"It packs a good amount of flavor in this fairly light, highly drinkable brew. Improving the aroma would go a long way, but it is still a worthwhile beer."
"Overall a very nice brown ale."
"An interesting beer that has just enough character to keep me interested. By far the best beer I have had from Mississippi (ok it is the only one too, but it is still good)."
"Overall, this was a very solid brew. I usually do not expect much from an American brown ale but this beer delivered in a big way. While pairing this with a slice of pecan pie might be a bit of a stretch, nuttier cheeses would do quite well."
"Drinks pretty easy, I could do a few of these before the lack of body drove me away. I'm sure I'd pound this if I lived in MS, but just an alright brown in my book"
"Drinkability - Hey if this beer's trying to accomplish a refreshing pecan tasting beer that you can hammer home on a summer night, then we have a winner."
"d - i expected a lot more from this beer than I got out of it. I got this in a trade from some belgian fans in the heart of Mississippi. I was expecting more robust pecan flavors but really didn't get but a slight hint of it. I really expected more from the hype this beer gets around the south. It's from Mississippi so I guess it's about what you can expect."
"Recieved in a trade with gregc. Pours a deep brown color with fairly good tan head. Small amount of lacing in the glass. The aroma is a mix of nuttiness and malt sweetness, not much Pecan as I had hoped for. The taste is pretty much like any other Nut Brown. Again, was disappointed that there was not more Pecan in it. Had some caramel and toffee sweetness. Pretty well balanced with a fair amount of hops. The finishes a little sweet. Good mouthfeel. Overall my expectations were too high for what the beer gave me."
"Love nut browns and this one was a must try for that reason, had not heard much about this brewery but I am impressed so far, pretty much exactly what I was expecting, would drink again, recommended"
"Drinkability is top notch. A sixer of this certainly will not do. In order to stock up next time, you'd have to have a case, minimum. It's a great brew to enjoy the summer nights."
"Drinkability is high. Low alcohol and good flavors make this a perfect session and very easy to consume."
"I would tell you more about how good this beer is but unless you've had one, you wouldn't get it. No really, it's nothing personal, you really wouldn't get it."
"Thanks again to barefootbrewer for the chance to try this beer."
"D - An awesome session beer, in my opinion. Low abv, great flavor, and a fairly light body. Definitely can down a couple of these in a sitting."
"Very drinkable. I'd buy this again if it were available near me."
"This was my favorite brown from the bottle so far. Highly sessionable, if I had more than one that is. Very pleased with this one added it back on my wants list if that means anything"
"Overall I thought this one was outstanding, and one of the best session ales I have had in a long time. I would love to see brewers turn more to doing things like this as it really shows off what can be done without going to the extreme. If you can get a hold of this, I would and quickly!"
"D : Easy one to drink"
"It has light to medium heaviness on the palate and is a little oily. Still, overall a delicious beer."
"Thanks, brianj555, for the opportunity"
"Thanks again brianj555!"
"D- This is a great brown ale. Definitely a session beer. Not a lot of complexity but today at 102 degrees in Gilroy, it's just what i'm looking for."
"D - Pleasant brown ale with a distinct nutty flavor and nice sweetness that offers an interesting twist on the style with the addition of pecans."
"EDIT 6/16/08: Got a new 6 pack of this stuff and the head retention and lacing were much better this time around. Consequently, appearance score raised to a 4. Drinkability raised to a 4.5 because it's so light and flavorful (and I just put down a pint of it in less than 5 minutes)."
"This beer shows that a beer doesn't have to be big to be good. This is a top notch session ale that I'd recommmend to anyone."
"Pours a semi dark and semi clear brown. The first whiff I took was total pecan. It wasn't so much like sniffing a handful of pecans, but more like the filling of a pecan pie. It's not overwhelming but it's enough to stand out. The taste is really a lot of toasted malt, finishes slightly sweet. It's possible to forget you're drinking a pecan beer because after a while it doesn't stand out a whole lot. A nice beer overall anyway though, and the pecan works well in a brown ale."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my Imperial pint glass. Appears a translucent ruby reddish brown with about a finger of light tan head. Aromas of lightly roasted caramel malt and nuts. Tastes of unsalted, roasted pecans and sweet malt. Medium in both carbonation and mouthfeel. Quite drinkable. My glass was empty in a short period of time leaving me craving another. Seek this out if you can."
"Glad to finally try this beer. Picked up a couple of sixpacks in Birmingham at Whole Foods- they seem to have it when others are out. Pours a reddish brown with good clarity, a decent head and some okay head retention as well as some spotty lacing. Mellow, malty, and nutty in the nose with a yeasty, bready smell in the background. Pleasant, but somehat light. Very pleasant taste, the elements in the aroma are echoed here, but there is also a lovely creaminess and a hint of restrained nuttiness, but there is a touch of sour graininess at the end as you continue to drink. Smooth mouthfeel with nice creaminess, but a little light at the end as it falls off. Very drinkable- nice to see such a well made session beer."
"D: I can only drink a couple pints of this in a sitting because of it being a bit sweet. It is still quite tasty and refreshing. Damned good beer."
"M/D - Medium bodied but a little thin on the mouthfeel. A very refreshing brown ale."
"brown with ruby highlights, head is of average size and is light-brown. The aroma is rather weak and is malts and a strange pecan smell. The taste is maltyand unique. Mixed in there are flavors of a mild roastiness and some spice. The finish initially has a off-flavor, but that goes away as Southern Pecan warms up."
"I am undecided as to whether I'd buy this again...but I'm sure I wouldn't turn it down if offered."
"Nice! I was suprised by the richness and full body of this Brown Ale and I must say that this was one of the better ones that I've had lately. Good stuff from down South."
"D: I could drink this one all night. I would rate this as one of the better nut brown ales I've had and would definitely seek it out. Would love to see what other goodies are coming out of this Miss. brewery."
"Agreeable enough, I guess, but not a favorite."
"*Taster's Note: Thanks to barefootbrewer for the bottle."
"Poured a copper/amber with a small head on top. You can really smell the pecans in this one-it dominated the smell but there was some floral hop character. The taste matched the smell with the pecan dominating. There is a little bit of sweet malt and some bitterness on the swallow. Also the floral hop character came out as it warmed. The mouthfeel had a slickness to it that was reminded me of eating pecans and the oil that is left over. A little low on carbonation but not bad. Very sessionable. A solid brew and one that I think most would enjoy."
"Thanks to deepsouth in the Brews 'n' Tunes 3 BIF for the opportunity. Pours a deep brown red with amazing clarity and carbonation, head was a little lacking. Nice nutty nose that also incorporates a pleasant roasted maltiness. I notice the hops on my tongue as it swirls in my mouth. As I swallow the nuttiness that is lingering in the background becomes more apparent there is some nice malty sweetness mingled in there. Very well balanced. Nice medium body even though it is a lighter session beer. Could see myself putting back a few of these at a pub."
"Drinkability: It's a popular session beer down here, that's for sure, and they've just recently began distributing the bottled version. Its low alcohol percentage, plus its smooth, sweet taste and medium body makes it a highly drinkable beer, unless pecans aren't your thing."
"D: Tasty and easy drinking. Would m ake an excellent session brew."
"I should add again the SP I had on-draught would have probably scored about .5 higher in most categories, but I wasn't taking notes that day..."
"D: A fine session beer."
"Kudo's to Lazy Magnolia for becoming Mississippi's first brewery since prohibition. I've heard alot of great things about their brews and look forward to trying the others. No Southern Pecan's not my favorite but that's just me. My wife liked it though."
"D - I liked this beer, the balance of sweetness and the roast was something I don't get a lot of around here, but I would definately try again."
"Poured a dark clear ruby with little to no head. Smells of sweet caramel malts with hints of nuttiness which one would assume is the pecans. Has a sweet taste at the start which is well balanced my the dry nutty flavor. The sweetness takes over and the pecan flavor seems to fade and hang out in the back. This is medium-bodied that is somewhat thick but not too much. I believe it is a great session beer. Its a great southern American rendition of a great brown ale style. I would like to try other Lazy Magnolia brews. Hopefully they start bottling others."
"This is a wonderful but very heavy beer. It's one of those beers that i love to have one or two of, but it's almost like drinking a meal. I usually get this beer on tap at local bars and restaurants in town. Not a beer i would recommend for trying to get drunk off of, but a great beer to pair with a meal, or when just having a few drinks after work. A beer i highly recommend, but might make you a little sluggish or tired after drinking."
"So...maybe brown ale wasn't the perfect choice for pecan infusion. Maybe a big bold stout? Bell's? New Glarus? Terrapin? Anybody wanna give that a shot?!"
"Medium-bodied and smooth, the pecan is integrated well into the balanced maltiness. A nicely crafted brew!"
"D- Oh yeah! I am think I should have gotten more from trill. This is a great session beer. I love brown ale so this fits the bill. Definite must have from the Deep South."
"Overall: Been wanting to try this one for sometime and got it in a fantasy football prize package. I really enjoyed it. Quite possibly my favorite brown ale to date."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, sweet, slight spice, nutty, and lots of caramel. The taste is sweet/malty, slightly spicy/nutty (pecans), and a good dose of caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a very tasty brown ale, one I would seek out again. Definitely recommmended. Thanks Ken."
"Thanks again, John!"
"Thanks to barefootbrewer for the sample."
"Flavor is slightly sharp with carbonation sting and a strong biscuit and toasted grain taste. Beer comes to a very dry and sharp finish that lingers for a long while."
"Thanks to deepsouth for helping me out..."
"Drinkability is good. An intriguing beer, doesn't blow me away, but if I had the opportunity to buy more, I would."
"This beer came with a thin, medium-tan head with light retention. There was a definite malty sweetness on the nose. The color was a light-brown with ruby highlights, I experienced a good, malty sweetness in the mouth, but especially so on the finish. My server described it as ""close to a Newcastle Brown"". Close, OK, and a decent brown ale, but ... Quick, does Woody like malt-driven Browns? NO! And yet, for me, this was the best of the lot. Moving on ..."
"D-For a sweet malty brew (which IS NOT my style) this is one easy drinking puppy. Couple that with the low 4% ABV and this is a beer I would take over a BMC anyday....and could drink quite a few of. A very nice job done by MS first craft brewery and first bottled beer since prohibition."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, very mild kick, good representation of style, this is nice beer to drink when your in the mood to knock back a few in this style but you want something substantial that won’t get you hammered."
"Overall- A tasty brown ale. Would make a good session beer with an abv of 4%. Solid."
"d - nicely done, this goes down smooth and leaves you wanting more. great session beer."
"This is definitely a session type beer if you like the flavor. I am not sure at this point how much of the nut flavor i can take.. but i will certainly drink a few more to and see how it goes. Glad i was able to try it."
"Thanks to my man Andrew(acrwf6) for bringing me a bottle! The beer poured a deep, mahogany color with small off white head which disipates quicly. Had descent lacing. The smell had a faint roasted smell to it and thats about it. The taste was a very malty taste with roasted coffee and a slight bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel was medium carbonation and a medium body. Overall this wasn't a bad beer. Very drinkable."
"D- The bottled version of this is much better than the party pig version. It seems more flavorful and lively. Not much of a pecan presence, but I personally do not think that pecans in and of themselves are that flavorful to begin with. Good choice if you can find it."
"Not overpowering, just a great brew - as many have asked for on BA, this is a SESSION brew!"
"A very nice beer beer indeed. A fine representative of Mississippi."
"This beer pours a nice brown color with a decent head. It smells and tastes pretty much as it's labeled on the bottle. Nice aroma of sweet nuts without being overpowering and malts. The taste is very well balanced, it's not too sweet like other brown ales and the hint of pecan tastes very authentic. It's pretty light bodied for a brown ale. I really love this beer and it is superior when compared to the Abita Pecan Harvest Ale. I could drink a sixer of these with no problem."
"this was my first review."
"This competes for title of ""Quintessential Southern Session Beer."" Beautiful."
"Overall: A very good brown/nut ale, with fine sweet-nutty character. Recommended."
"I wish I could rate this a little higher but there are definately some off-flavors here. Having said that, I like them, I think they play well together, and this makes for a very warm and homey take on the brown ale."
"Had to come back and add that this is now available in bottles. They have also corrected the ABV on this site since my last rating. Tastes better than the draft or party pig. Very little carbonation to this beer, hard to generate good head with even the most aggressive of pours. Very drinkable. (12/15/2007)"
"Poured a light brown color. Smelled of pecans. Had a one inch head that fell quickly. Had a very clean taste. There is a strong aftertaste of pecans, which is very delicious. Some carbonation but not a lot. This is a good beer. I had it at a local bar and then went out looking for it in bottles, which can't be done. I was able to pick up a ""party pig"". Because of the low ABV, I found this to be an enjoyable beer when having a get-to-gether. Another not, it looks like this beer can be found in just about any bar in MS."
"Light brown appearance with thin head that dissipates quickly. Smells nutty and lightly roasted. Taste was a little off at first but once the smooth brew coats your throat it's all malty, pecan-flavored brew. It's an interesting taste, especially since it's actually a very clean mouthfeel."
"A uniqe and great-tasting beer. Poured a deep brown with a nice head. Aroma consisted of a toasted barley presence as well as light hops. Taste brought forth sweetness from the malt, but then a bitter bite that reminded me of pecan hulls; a truly unique experience. Give this one a shot and you won't be disappointed."
"Served a great brown with a decent head that slowly diminished to a ring. The aroma was dominated by malts with a very pronounced nuttiness. The flavor of pecans comes through nicely in then taste. The beer is light and crisp, combined with a great taste, this is a truly enjoyable beer."
"Pours a deep mahogany color with a bit of garnet highlights and a thick and frothy light tan head that settles into a solid sheet of lace. Nose is sweet and malty with notes of brown sugar and a roasted nuttiness. Taste is caramel malt and buttery toffee followed by the roasted pecans to which I was so looking forward. Initially, I was a bit disappointed that the pecan flavor wasnt stronger, but it becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. The texture possesses a bit of a silky quality that coats your tongue and remains until the next sip. I really enjoyed this beer. In fact, I will have to stop myself from finishing the entire growler tonight so that I can enjoy it again tomorrow. Thanks to barefootbrewer for the sample!"
"I'm sitting here drinking my second glass from a growler of Southern Pecan, a Southern classic (or at least a Mississippi classic) out of my own gen-u-ine Lazy Magnolia B.C. pint glass and am having a grand old time. This is a wonderfully drinkable beer and should go well with whatever I decide to eat today. Thanks go out to barefootbrewer for making this possible."
"This beer poured a brick brownish color with a thin head. The smell is malty and nutty. The taste is malty with a definite pecan note. It is very well balanced. The mouthfeel is slightly full with an alcohol/carbonation zing. This is a deliciously drinkable beer!"
"Overall, this is a decent brown ale. It has a unique flavor and is quite drinkable, but there are others of this style that I'd prefer over this."
"Notes: As being from this type of climate, this is an amazing beer to be coming from Mississippi. This is one of the finest Brown Ales I have tasted. Puts Newcastle and others to shame."
"I have a party pig of this and its better then the ""on tap"" ones I have had. It seems that some of the local places just dont know how to clean their lines who knows. But, I really enjoy this beer and would go buy another party pig for sure."
"I'll have to give this beer props since (as far as I know) it comes from the only brewery in Mississippi. it pours a nice, deep amber colour. smells ok... can't exactly put my finger on what is wrong... but it may have something to do with the ""party pig"" it came from. It tastes good, very nutty taste but it has a slightly ""artificial"" aftertaste. this beer is easy to drink though. I enjoy it and I like to support the company. wouldn't mind seeing a few more in Mississippi pop up."
"Knowing that something this good came from Mississippi makes me happy. Pours nicely, with a good medium head, which is long gone before the glass is half empty. Take a heavier nut ale, and just lighten it a bit. Not that it's seems watered-down, it's just a bit lighter and still has that nice nuttiness that makes you go back to the fridge to refill your Tervis Tumbler (or maybe that's just me). Hopefully Lazy Magnolia will be followed by other breweries in Mississippi, and maybe we can start seriously contributing some day."
"A decent beer, but something about the carbonation keeps me from giving it a 5 for drinkability. Acquired in a trade with aracauna."
"Maybe this style isn't my cup of tea, but I probably would have enjoyed it better if it had more body, more chewyness, or even more alcohol (no idea about the ABV of this one)"
"The color is brown with ruby highlights, head is of average size and is light-brown. The aroma is rather weak and is malts and a strange nut smell which I guess is pecans. The taste is strangely malty, not bad, just different. I'm guessing it is because of the pecan presence. Mixed in there are flavors of a mild roastiness and some spice. The finish initially has a off-flavor, but that goes away as Southern Pecan warms up. Drinkability is okay, however I wouldn't go out of my way to get this again."
"This is probably one of the best brown ales since Boyne River closed and their brown was killed off. Its not on that level, but then again, no other brown ale is. Its a nice dark coppery brown, clear with a good head that has good staying power. The aroma is rich dark malts, caramel, slightly cake like. Theres a nuttiness that isnt really obviously pecans. Its kind of like hazlenut without that slightly cloying quality of those. The flavor is lightly sweet, rich malts and the added complexity of the roasted nuts make for an easy drinking beer. The body is a little light for my tastes, but I had the first beer and couldnt keep myself from pouring a second. The beer is gone in no time and Im still wanting more. Not for hop-heads or others with tastes for over the top beers, but if you have an appreciate for solid, malty brown ales, youd like this one."
