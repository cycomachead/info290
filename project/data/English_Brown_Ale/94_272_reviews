"I Pop!ped the cap and gave it a solid pour, creating a dense finger of light-tan head with decent retention. Color was Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, "

"Mouthfeel is light and smooth.  I could drink a lot of this in a session.  Not bad at all!!!!"
""
""
"Not flat, but not really carbonated..."

"Not something that I will order more than one of per autumn, but damnit if it's not a great example of what it is: a roasted, smoky fall offering that's something other than ""pumpkin"". Hint of maple; not sweet, not too bitter. Well done. Drink one on a cold night around the fire."

"O- I'd like just a little more body on this one, and the roast was a little too over the top. However, solid, and a great drink for a cool night."
""
""
""
"One of the better fall beers!  Smooth with a hint of maple.  Easy drinking and a nice change from all of the pumpkin infused beers. If you like brown ale and like a hint of fall flavor. You can't go wrong with this brew!"

"DATE TASTED: September 2, 2014... GLASSWARE: Brew at the Zoo pint...OCCASION: O's bust open a 10-3 lead in Game One of the ALDS... APPEARANCE: intimidatingly dark mahogany body; swiftly descending off-white head; flat, inconsistent up top... AROMA: thick, intense, sweet syrupy punch that encompasses a beautifully smoky embrace; hickory also mates with flattened hops to approximate a brown ale/porter mash-up ... PALATE: weighty, rather flat cola mouthfeel; teeth must withstand some energy, but the warmth sits idly on the tongue--heavy.....TASTE: sweet and malty with the syrup  and smoke mitigating a rather uneventful flavor; a bit of biscuit late, but not what the aroma promises... OVERALL: Autumnal, yes--but the allure of its scent doesn't measure up when sipped; low alcohol content makes it sessionable--with toffee and gritty malts, good for (a couple of) night caps...."

"Nice deep brown color. Head is decent with minimal lacing. Aroma is light with some maple and malt sweetness coming through to tingle the nose. Interestingly enough, the malt sweetness and maple are not too overpowering like I would have expected. Nice balance with an ever so slight bitterness back. Sweet but not too sweet. Do I get a few hints of brown sugar, coffee?"
""
""
"Pours a clear and deep ruby-tinted brown. There a short-lived fizzy white head that still manages to leave some lacing. The aroma is malt-oriented, with some nice light dark fruit, a nice nutty quality. The taste is great, especially for a low ABV beer. It has a robust malt profile, with the nutty quality dominating, supported by some nice roasted undertones and a good earthy hops quality. The body has a nice weight a little carbonation. A great fall session ale."
"soapy head dissipates quickly. deep amber-brown color. a very nice looking brown ale. smells of chocolate and roasted malt typical of a traditional brown. very balanced, some floral hop to go along with the roasted malt, coffee, choc notes. light-med bodied. easy drinking. perfect campfire beer for autumn."

"Overall:  More interesting than I thought it would be, I find this to be a decent presentation of what is usually a boring style"

"A decent enough brown with a nice flavor and average body.  Nothing special, but nothing really to complain about and drinks very easy.  Also very sessionable at its strength while remaining flavorable.  Worth looking into and viable as a go-to brew for people looking for a darker session ale."
""
""
"Tremendous low abv brown ale. Pours medium brown with a off white head. Great nutty, grape nut like flavors in this.  But there are enough hops to provide a clean and dry  finish.  The smell is rich like fresh toast and cereal. This is super sessionable. I could drink this all day on a nice fall day."

"Pours bright dark amber, just a hint of light gets through. Malty nose, some caramel. Bready and nutty. Maple, malt taste, thin. Light carbonation. A little sweet, nice balance with the maple and the nut brown flavors. Good autumn beer, admittedly I waited too long to enjoy this year,"

"I love this beer. one of my favorite fall releases. brown ale brewed with maple syrup, just right for a chilly Adirondack evening. deep brown to red on the pour, a faint caramel glow in the light, and an inch of khaki colored head with decent retention that produces ring lacing each sip. nose is caramel malt based, with a hint of dry cocoa and an unmistakable maple sweetness. the sugar contrasts with the almost bitter malt really well in the flavor, as the rich grains drive the flavor until the finish, where a warm maple vanilla complex gently rounds out the taste. its not overly sweet, and as such a real drinkable. a sixer of this is no problem. medium bodied for a brown, and carbonated just enough. this is a patient beer through too, and improves as it warms a little. probably my favorite beer from long trail, and its beers like this that make fall my favorite season to be a beer lover."
""
""
""
"Chewy, tasty, pub style in a bottle. Creamy slight vanilla wash, full taste. Not much to say other than, I'd get this one again. It's a standard brown."

"Overall: Decent brew, I belive that the nutty characteristics of the beer reflect the maple syrup, making for a more subtle flavor. I would have this one again."

"The taste has the slightest bite right away with a nutty, albeit soapy malt character at first that perks up a tad with the slow hop finish. Pretty easy drinking."
" The flavor is good with nice toasted grain and honey type sweetness with a light herbal element with nice caramel and light corn pop elements with slight biscuit in the finish. Overall I enjoyed this and would get it again, it has nice flavor and is pretty drinkable considering the low abv and I like the honey in this as it adds to the dry body."

"O: its just as I remembered it and makes me glad I got some this year. This is very drinkable, in fact, I'll go out on a limb and say this is probably one of most drinkable browns on the market."
"O - Part of the sampler pack. The price on this is great. I find this a slight downgrade from a Sam Adams, but a solid beer from a decent brewery."
""
""
"O: A nice version of the style, had all the flavors that I was anticipating. The coffee bite was a nice surprise, but was hoping for a bit more thickness in the taste. Seems a little watered down. But overall, a pretty good Brown Ale!"
"This is light to medium bodied. The carbonation is soft. I like this one. It's nothing special, but I'm apt to buy it again as it is a solid brown ale from a solid brewery at a reasonable price."

"There's obviously a large difference between the reviews of this beer posted by regular users and those posted by The Bros. According to the one Bro review, the reviewed bottle apparently contained ""A blurb about using 17 different malt and hop varieties."" However, a quick check of Long Trail's website reveals only five malt and hop varieties: Two-Row, Wheat, Amber, Nugget, and Mt. Hood. I'm not sure if the recipe changed, or if a review was posted incorrectly."

"Nicely done. Should be a crowd pleaser. Normally I prefer more substantial beers, but this is a nice change of pace. It would make a good session beer."
"This poured out as a nice looking brown color, it had good clarity to it along with a nice thin white head on top. The smell of the beer gave off some autumn spice along with some roasted nutty aromas. The taste of the beer wasn't too bad either, it had a semi-sweet roasted quality to it along with a dry bitter finish. The mouthfeel of the beer was on the lighter side even for a darker brew, the carbonation wasn't too overpowering and the finish had a light tingle to it. Overall this beer wasn't too bad."

"Pours a transparent brown with white head that fades. Aroma of toffee, light brown sugar, and slight nutty. Tastes of toffee, light brown sugar, subtle cola, and light cinnamon, nutty and caramel towards the finish. Medium carbonation with light body."

"Had an opportunity to have this beer the past two years while vacationing in Vermont. We went to Long Trail and they had this and all of their beers on tap. The color was a nice amber color with a sweet smell. The taste was amazing....it finishes off with a subtle hint of maple syrup. I have had this in bottles, we brought home a case, and it is very good from the bottle too. If you get up there, go to the brewing company and taste it all...the Good Night Irene was even better."

"O-I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I wasn't going in expecting much and found the beer enjoyable. Wont say I'd get it again but was worth a try."
"o - not bad, not great.. there's a lot of brown ales out there i'd drink before grabbin another LTBC Harvest, but I'm glad to have tried it..."
"O - Pretty decent beer, could use a little less carbonation and heavier flavor. Pretty good fall beer though."
"Overall a very smooth and drinkable beer. Taste is very well balanced and isn't very filling. Another solid beer from long trail. Highly recommended to malt lovers."
"O: This beer is pretty dull. I like to give extra points to beer with abv below 5, but a higher abv might have helped here."
"Overall a more medium to light bodied beer, very drinkable, but not much out of the ordinary. Good brew!"
"The body is light with good carbonation. Overall this is probably the star of the variety pack right now. Not to say any of the others are bad."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'd happily sip on this again, but the money won't be coming out of my wallet, as there are many superior options as far as Fall seasonals go. I'd like to see a little more in the way of maple syrup in the one."
"O: Damn, Long Trail, I expected a good, competitive brown ale and this is what I get? Watery and tastes strange. Your (good vs bad beer) record is now 2-3. I want to like you since you're a New England staple, but you're going to need to do better than this."
"This beer pours a clear, Coke brown with bold orange in the light. No head or lacing. The aroma is nuts with dark roasted malt. The flavor has notes of burnt toast, nuts, and a hint of root beer leading to a roasted nut finish. The mouthfeel is light. Long Trail Harvest is a good beer, perfect for a fall evening. Recommended."
"I am a big fan of Long Trail, Double Bag, Ale and IPA, while this beer is good it is not in the same league."
"It is very drinkable"
"i buy this beer every season and i'm never let down. this is one well balanced brown ale! recommended."
"Deep reddish-brown color. Nutty, slightly smoky nose that also has a hint of the maple syrup used... this beer really smells like autumn to me. Crisp, well-balanced taste, dominated by fresh malt. A very sessionable beer that has some complexity to it. No fireworks, but this is really pleasant stuff for a fall day."
"Pours a slight white head, nice lacing down the glass. Dark, deep rich, colour. Nutty on the palate, almondy mouthfeel. Only problem is, a bit watery. Body a bit thin, but you can drink a bunch of these in one sitting. Very smooth, nothing offensive. Crisp and brisk. A good fall beer, would be even better with some hazelnuts! Nothing to shy away from, but nothing overly special, either. I think, however, pretty good stab at the style."
"Into a pint glass on 8/14/11 this yields a crimson brownish color under a well kept white head. A moderate aroma carries notes of sweet toasted nut malt and perhaps a bit of vanilla cream or lactate. A crisp and mild toasted malt background quenches the palate with notes of mild coffee, roasted nut, and toffee. A very drinkable brown ale that really does express its flavors best nearest a cellar temperature."
"Lighter than most brown ales and less flavorful, but would be pretty refreshing when you aren't craving something real complex. I typically like more flavor than this and, in comparison to other brown ales, it feels a little underwhelming overall."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and rather sessionable, especially with its low alcohol content."
"Had this on tap at Pony Bar in New York City. Pours a light brown colour with almost no head or lacing. Smells of caramel, nutty and a mild hint of some hops. Sweet flavour, with some mild chocolate in the aftertaste. Body is quite thin for the style. Just an ok brown ale."
"Taste is high on malts with a hint of bitterness. Pretty light, easy to drink and mouthfeel is good. Definitely worth a try."
"Overall: The medium body with the light carbonation makes this beer extremely drinkable. I could easily down a few of these. All the flavors work very well together."
"A very drinkable beer that surprised me. I did not expect to like this so much. One of the best harvest beers I've sampled this season."
"Excellent medium bodied beer, totally sessionable, very drinkable."
"m - as said, its a bit thin. not too bad if you want a lighter beer."
"Notes: I first had this on tap but this one is from a bottle. I decided to pick some up and the verdict is dam tasty. Cheers."
"Long Trail Harvest Ale is an okay brown ale. After drinking a mild stout having this beer was like drinking nothing. The roast and toasted flavors seemed pretty muted, the color was nice and there was alittle head stand. But beer didn't have the richness and chocolately flavor that I was expecting. In the new tradition of bold, flavorful browns, this falls short."
"Drinkability is high due to the lack of substance in the mouth, and the abv is relatively low. Would be a good quenching beer after some leaf raking."
"this drinks really nice, i might not buy this again, but i could see myself enjoying some more of it. this was the best in the variety 12, the blackberry wheat was a close second however."
"There is nothing offensive about this beer and I could gladly drink if offered one. But if I have to go out myself and spend $8.00 on a six pack then I'm taking something a little more special. I would say this would be the taste if you took a good brown ale and cut it with water."
"I poured this awful beverage from a bottle into my mouth, you could taste the nasty rubbing alcohol that Vermont has to offer, since on the bottle they use local Vermont ingredients the only thing I could think taste worse is the Longtrail unfiltered IAP. Very very bad!"
"This beer pours a very dark amber color, with very little head. It smells sweet, and malty. The taste is very watery at first, but then finishes with a malty flavor that is very sweet A very different taste for a brown ale. Flavor is weak, and lower carbonation, but this makes it very easy to drink, a good brown ale for the light beer drinker. Overall, not bad, I was expecting, and hopeing for a stronger flavor though, but unquie flavor."
"Clear reddish brown with a large head that hangs on for awhile before settling to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is slightly fruity and nutty with a hint of roast underneath. A little lighter tasting than what I expected. Slightly fruity and buttery with some nuttiness in the finish. The flavor seems to be dominated by the yeast. Definately more Enlish than American in nature. The body is also on the light side. But it is enough to carry the flavor and has good carbonation. Easy drinking brown ale that has a reasonable ABV for a session."
"Not bad at all. Certainly a sessionable ale."
"DB- I am a bit torn here. I really enjoy the roasty nutty malt but the adjunct seeming fruit and corn flavors throw it off somewhat. It just feels light and a tad artificial, but still not bad."
"D: This is not a complex beer, but it is a nice change of pace on a cool autumn day."
"D- this is a very drinkable brew. This will be a go to fall brew for me."
"This has nice toasty flavors but it's watery and thin. You lose everthing on the finish."
"This Harvest Beer doesn't feel that bountiful. A bit thin for a fall beer, but nonetheless drinkable and goes down easy. Compared to other brewery's fall specials, this one isn't one I'd run back to, but if someone offers me up one I'm not going to say no. It's just average, for me."
"While I little too green tasting at first, this actually balanced out nicely as it warmed, and the earthy hop character coupled with the easy feeling body made for a decent thirst quenching experience. Nothing mind-blowing here but this was a decent drinking Brown Ale for the fall season."
"Very drinkable as a session beer."
"Very drinkable and sessionable. Enjoyable for the season and the reasonable price tag but there are no strong dominant flavors. I expect more in my beer and from Long Trail to be honest. Relatively balanced but light for a brown ale."
"Overall, this is an enjoyable fall brown ale. I still like the Sierra Nevada Tumbler more, mainly because it has more of a hop bite to it. I hope Long Trail makes a pumpkin ale some fall."
"drinkability for me is just ok...have had much better autumn beers..."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slick, and a bit thin on the finish. Not my favorite offering from Long Trail."
"drinkable. probably better with food. that would make it more drinkable."
"This beer needs more roasted malts and should be brown or a deep amber if is going to be a brown ale.Could also use a bit more carbonation to help keep the head afloat."
"Thanks John!"
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice caramel notes, slightly nutty. The taste is sweet, malty, nutty, with a nice touch of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a pretty tasty brew."
"D: Overall a very enjoyable brown ale for cool autumn days."
"D- Mild and easy to drink. A bit unrefined and rough around the edges but sessionable none the less."
"Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. It comes out a nice brown color with a beige or off-white colored head. When held up to the light it turns out to be more of an amber red color. It has good clarity to it, well filtered. The head goes away after a few sips and leaves a ring with a little layer of foam over the middle, small random patches of lacing that seem to try to work it's way down to the liquid. The smell is very good, it smells very well hopped, pine and floral notes. There's a lot going on in the taste department. Much sweeter than anticipated, can clearly taste some roasted caramelized malts. There are also a slight chocolate taste to it, more like coco, very interesting. Only a slight hop aftertaste, it doesn't taste anything like the smell that's for sure. There's also a smokey taste to it, probably some roasted/burned malts involved with the flavor. It's a very complex taste, but quite good. The mouthfeel is good, despite the complex flavor I'd still call it a medium bodied beer and closer to the lighter side. This is an incredibly drinkable beer, and another solid brew by Long Trail. Still haven't decided whether or not I'm going to pick up another six pack this season because there are so many seasonals I like this time of year. If not than I have something to look forward to next year. On a side note, I really enjoyed the label on the bottle, the husband and wife farmer bears really make me think of the fall/harvest season."
"Drinkability: I really enjoyed this Long Trail offering, as I do most of their seasoanal offerings. This beer features a huge dose of malty goodness to get you through those cold fall months. Very balanced all around with the huge malt backbone being the star of the show. At 4.7% ABV, this beer drinks bigger then the ABV indicates. Huge drinkability here, I think I'll have another!"
"Served in a nonic. Poured the color of cola with some cranberry juice highlights at the base when backlit; no head on this one. Nose was mild - some dark malts and wheat, but that's all I'm getting. Taste - not much in that department either - malt, some caramel notes, but fairly bland. Mouthfeel was light-medium with a light background effervescence, almost flat, and a fairly clean finish. Very bland; I actually struggled to finish this. I was hoping this would be better off the keg than from the bottle, but I was pretty disappointed."
"This beer is easy enough to drink and will probably taste better after the first bottle."
"Cheers!!"
"Drinkability: this was an interesting offering and the flavor profile is different from other harvest ales. Easy to quaff."
"really great autumn session."
"Perfect autumn session beer, I can already imagine the leaves and that autumn smell in the air."
"Poured a clear, dark brown (SRM27), very thick moderate sized bubble off white head supported by high carbonation. Moderate brown sugar aroma, low hop aroma. Moderate carmel.brown sugar flavor that is slightly cloying in the sweetness. Moderate body with low bitterness in the finish with some low level spiciness at the very end."
"Not really sure why this is under American amber/ red ale - it calls itself a Brown and I think it fits very well in to the American Brown ale category. Call it what you want - I call it superb!"
"D: Seems pretty drinkable. No strong flavors. Relatively balanced. Clean for a brown ale. Low ABV."
"Big and smooth, malty and thick. But not too much. Theres also a bit of a smokey camping type flavor to it. A tinge of bitterness to it, a very solid fall beer."
"Poured a reddish amber hue with light white head leaves quickly with minimal lacing left behind. Aroma has some sweet cereal notess a touch of caramel with a pretty much absent hop nose. Taste has caramel malts with heavy cereal rains, somewhat of an herbal hop finish very light on flavor. Finishes semisweet I was excpecting a lot more sweetness than was actually there just from the smell. Mouthfeel is light-er bodied with even carbonation nothing too interesting here. Drinkability all around a session seasonal that I could pass on next time and not feel bad about it."
" I'll pass on this one next time"
"Aroma is nutty with light brown sugar and cocao powder. Taste is similiar: very clean brown sugar in front but has a nutty herbal hop finish which makes for a soapy swallow. Carbonation is a bit higher than I'd like."
"Long Trail Harvest is nice and malty this year. The dark grain stands out this year more than it has in the past 2 years. I am not sure if they use the same recipe every year now or not. This year seems to be a bit sweeter. The story of the the beer is that they use 'what they have left over' to make it. So I am under the impression that they use or try a different grain bill each year, because it is a tad bit different every year. Overall this year's batch has a chocolate maltiness that stands out. A well balanced Brown Ale"
"I remember this beer being better earlier this decade however it has fallen flat on its face. Nice Brown color but a little lacking in the nose. Taste was your classic Brown Ale flavor but it leaves the palate quickly and the best way to describe is watered down. If you're looking for a good seasonal try elsewhere."
"[Sampled at the 2009 Flower City Brewers' Fest at Frontier Field, Rochester, NY]"
"Poured out of a bottle, very dark brown ale, light brown finger thick head. Smell insinuates a heavier beer, until you drink it, then it's just kinda bleh. Very light mouthfeel, nothing outstanding, would be a good beer for someone who's stepping into fall/oktoberfest beers and doesn't want an in your face flavor right away. Kinda boring, but easy to drink."
"Dark, but clear ruby red with an inch of quickly dropping foam. Nose is malt and fruit. Slight band-aid and caramel in the nose as well. Flavour is dark fruit and caramel with a decent hop bitterness. Somewhat raw on the tongue with a sharp carbonation and dryness, but a bit of husky grain keeps things in check. Odd tongue-numbing anise flavour. Medium body is unremarkable."
"Earthy taste with tart fruitiness not real malty some metallic carmell not offensive. Good balance nice tangyness leading into the finish. Light bodied and smooth to the finish. Wish i could have tried this a few months ago like i planned. Will have to pick more up next year."
"Thanks for Reading"
"Drinkability: Not a bad red ale but not one that jumps out. I could session this beer just as easily as I could pass over it."
"Pours a glowing orange, amber brown color with a small white head leaving next to no sticking. Subtle nose of clean, quality malts, semi-sweet, with good lively carbonation. Roasty and just nutty enough with an earthy, slightly leafy hop note going on by itself very quietly. I remember previous years showing a bigger texture and having more body with lower carbonation. Still damn good and damn drinkable nonetheless."
"Drinkability: This is a great brown ale. I could drink quite a few of these, and I'm not a big fan of this style."
"Pours a very good looking dark copper. Semi-large, fluffy off-white head with intermittent lacing. Very good looking beer. Smells a bit sweet, like candy, cinnamon, but the aroma overall is weak and very laid back. The second the beer hits my lips I can tell that the palate will please me. Smooth, creamy texture with a very nice, tingling carbonation. This brew doesn't do anything too special, but it's adequate in all areas and very enjoyable as a fall seasonal."
"Notes - On the whole, a pretty decent seasonal brew. It should be noted that a biscuity and toffee aroma as well as flavor become more evident as the sample warmed. I had picked up a 12-pack a bit ago and have just gotten 'round to reviewing it. I honestly thought it was a brown ale the first few times I had it since it mirrors one in certain aspects. Anyway, A nice sessionable brew for the autumn to winter season that tastes decent and won't break the bank."
"D - Not one I'd pursue again."
"I enjoyed this beer very much, too bad I picked up a single."
"Pours Auburn or Redish Amber with a decent, quickly diminishing head. Vague aroma of nut and malt. Body is light, smooth, with a abrupt bitter end. Like drinking water with a mildly good smell and an aftertaste. Not impressed, but I rarely am with amber's. Oh well."
"Clear brown to slightly amber color with almost no head and just a halo of foam. No lace. Smell is biscuit maltyness, with some nice nuttyness. The nuttyness really comes to the front in the taste for me. Also some toastyness and some maple syrup notes in the taste. Thin mouth. Overall i would rate this as just an average beer at best. Nothing to get excited about."
"Pours a clear brown with next to nil head. No lacing to mention. The Aroma smells of light toffee, caramel, and a touch of hop spice. Flavor is very thin. Notes of some toffee and caramel, maybe a bit of cocoa peaks through in the front but fades off very quickly to not much of a flavor at all. Thin mouthfeel, watery, not much carbonation. I didn't enjoy this beer very much."
"Body is light, mildly carbonated, but a touch chalky and dry. Drinkable? Yes but I'm not sure what it would go well with."
"Pours a mahogany color with a one finger off white head of little bubbles that dissipate down to a thin line that lasts throughout, minimal lacing. Toasted and carmelized malt, chocolate in the aroma. Lots of biscuity, toasted flavor, caramel, chocolate, tea like hop quality comes through with a strong malty finish. Medium body and carbonation, this is a crisp clean drinking beer. Great seasonal offering."
"Light and drinkable, but flavor leaves something to be desired, slightly sweet and nutty, but disappears rather quickly."
"Had this on tap. Poured an almost clear reddish color with a foamy white head that didn't last too long very little lacing. Aroma was that of roasted malt with what I thought was a hint of coffee. Carbonation was good through-out. Taste (to me) was malty hazelnut, I hate hazelnut, I cannot stand the taste and the smell of it. Since I hate it, I can say I wasn't impressed with this beer, I know it has received some good reviews but I'm sorry, I just didn't enjoy it. I would probably try it again, I was drinking a few Ofests before I had this, maybe that had an effect on my taste buds."
"M&D--I'm not a fan of the mouthfeel one bit. It's watery, thin, and flavor-stealing. Just too slick for me. As a session beer it would be decent, though with so much forgettable in the second half of the tasting spectrum you'd do better with a decent lager or mild or bitter. Speaking of which, the website said this is based on an English brown style, but it looks like an American amber. What's the deal? I don't mind crossover styles, but when the brewery tells you it's one thing, then goes on and on about all the malt varieties and organic local ingredients, it gets kind of confusing. A better feel for backbone and not promo would have improved this brew."
"12 ouncer, pours clear darker honey amber, minor head/lace, seems to be pretty low on the carbonation scale. Minor malty nose, none too interesting on the tongue. Very so so, middle of the road brown in my book. This bottle also tasted to be on the oxidized side to boot. Not too impressed with this one. Ended up as a drain pour..."
"D: It was a fine beer but one without distinction or defining character. Suitable bar session beer but definitely a second choice if another is available."
"Don't drink and review."
"D: A see-saw affair with the nose but comes back strong with the taste and mouthfeel. More complex than I expected and look foward to having on draft."
"Light-medium in body, smooth, and slightly creamy. Great drinkability, as the beer is not overly complex. Solid session brew."
"Bad batch? Warmed-up/cooled down too much between the brewery and my casa? And what about all the folks that really liked it? It wasn't offensive but the complete lack of interesting smell/flavor/taste was sure a bummer. A mystery to me."
"M/D - I felt this one was slightly overcarbonated. I don't think i'll be seeking this one out in the future. It just seemed almost bland, not what i was expecting from Long Trail."
"This is a fairly light bodied Brown Ale that is very smooth, clean, and well balanced. Toasted sweet malts, brown sugar, maybe even maple syrup in the taste, with a nice bready background. The hops are present and complement the more malty body of this beer but they ought to have come on a touch more strongly. There is modest carbonation, which is just right. This is a very smooth, eminently drinkable Brown ale that hits all the right notes. The mouthfeel is a tad sweet from the maple syrup and/or brown sugars, and the aftertaste is very mild. Very worthy selection. L'Chaim."
"Average brown ale, with some standout malty characteristics."
"D-Pretty good. I could definitely kick pack and drink a few of these in a row."
"Note: Seems to actually be better in bottled format, who knew? More well rounded and better feel definately."
"Medium bodied and very smooth with just enough lively, fine textured carbonation to lighten up the mouthfeel. Velvety and very clean. Pleasant and lingering with a slightly dry finish. The drinkability is outstanding with a low ABV and a taste that's hard to get tired of. Really exceptional and a fantastic way to ring in the fall."
"A nice seasonal beer right here from a good brewery. The best part about it is the appearance as its a nice hearty, fall color. Lacking a little bit on the smell but the taste has all the usual fall spices in these seasonals. Very drinkable and balanced with a nice body to it. Along with the lack of smell, there's also a lack of carbonation I thought, which would have improved the score. Good overall though."
"Once you taste it though, you'll be a believer. It is a slightly sweet brown ale, with a subtle caramel flavor behind the more prevalent taste of Vermont grown hops. Its quite simple in character, but this simplicity and balance are its greatest strengths. It has a medium body and terrific mouthfeel. I had a hard time not drinking the entire six pack all at once. This is really a phenomenal beer, from a great little brewery. If you get the chance to try it, don't pass it up. You won't regret it."
"Drinkability - Modestly drinkable, if I had to."
"D-Not really sure about the harvest ale moniker but...this is a pretty good beer, especially from Long Trail, a brewery I have never been overly impressed with. This is a drinkable session brew that has enough going on to hold my interest. Wouldn't mind having a bit more in the aroma to make it more enjoyable."
"D: Just like pancakes...nothing altogether outstanding, but utterly satisfying."
"Not bad..."
"D - Pretty safe red ale that's easy to drink, as most typically are. Nothing stands out, really... this is simply your typical malty seasonal for consumption during the autumn months."
"This beer is a great representation of fall and harvest. Lots of tastes in this that remind one of the season."
"Notes: Over all its very good but I would like it to have a little bit deeper, more assertive flavor."
"This beer is hard to review. They claim that they have 17 different varieties of hops and malt in the brew. Poured a nice dark brown-amber color with a medium sized tan head. Adequate amount of lace but I wouldn't say it was a lot. The aroma is hard to detect. It's malty and maybe a little woody as well as grainy. The flavor is not as rich as the look, more malty than hoppy but both are there. The finish is slightly hoppy and dry. Very smooth beer but this is hard to judge. Maybe it's something you have to be in the mood for."
"Pours a clean copper/ orange-ish color, with a white head. In the aroma, roasty malt, sweet lager like notes, and a very small hop. In the taste, small hop and a roasty malt, quite balanced. A small hop bite and a medium mouthfeel, with a dry malty, and small hop in the aftertaste. Light for a harvest, somewhat lager like in the aroma. Balanced and decent session."
"Poured out of the bottle a pleasant clear copper brown with a cream colored head. Little retention but some intermittent lacing. Smells of wood and caramel malts. Flavors are a little spicy, mostly malt, hops seems lacking, a little nutty, and toffee or caramel. Definitely fall-ish. Decent mouthfeel, medium carbonation. Finish is a little tangy when the hops finally show up. A mediocre beer."
"The carbonation is tough to get past for me, but the taste and smell are worth the bubbles. I could enjoy a couple of these while camping or tailgating."
"D: Average at best drinkability, finishes dry but lacks the sweetness per style. Drinks more like a standard ale then an amber."
"Spicy and woody quaff, with more of those roasted nuts tossed into the barrel. This one slides easily and would make for a nice summer session brew."
"pours a clear medium amber or medium brown in color with about a one finger beige head with some decent lacing. slight caramel and malt nose. toasted biscuit, with a slight caramel dry taste, mouthfeel mostly malt medium body and carbonation ok. drinkability is good but its not special by any means."
"Very drinkable due to nice body and very mild flavors."
"Pours a crystal clear brown with minimal crÃ¨me head. Nose is unusual. A part of me wants to say it smells like the butter that amasses in those bags of microwave popcorn. I take a more observant whiff and it seems like those Danish cookies you always get in the cans at Christmas time. Apparently I am all about the snacks today. Flavor is tangy, and a bit too much so. Has some hearty and earthy aspects, but that zing just overpowers it too much I say. Good feel, but a bit thin. Overall this is decent at best I have to say. Well made, yes. But the almost citric tang that yells a bit too loud just doesn't do it for me and ends up killing the experience."
"Good, but not my favorite Long Trail brew. I had a few but the beer never really grew on me. There are a lot of other beer's I'd recommend ahead of this one, but it's certainly worth a try if you visit the brewery."
"Sample at the Mill Hill Saloon in Trenton, NJ: This beer is a clear pale amber color with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. Spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma of fruit and caramel malt. Medium-bodied with sweet malt and caramel flavors along with some nuts and hops. The finish is moderately sweet at first with a mild hops aftertaste. Drinkable, although mediocre overall."
"Drinkability- A decent beer, nothing spectacular."
"D- I could session this beer if I chose to."
"Smooth but dry, and with a sweet-bitter bite. Major yeast, full of flavor. Like an Oktoberfest combined with an ESB. Really great."
"Final Note: the 'Farmer Bears' on the bottle label were cute, but there wasn't a *label cuteness* catagory in the review."
"Agressive pour lead to a two finger head that is a off white/eggshell color.Very clear amber body,looks like every other amber ale.Small amounts of lacing.Caramel malts,small amount of fruitiness in the smell.I taste some fruit(berrys) chocolate,caramel and some bitter hops.The mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery,once the taste leaves your mouth its gone.Clean taste.I dont think I will have any of these long trail beers again.They werent too great.Sorry Fellas."
"Poured a a healthy, hearty color: a dark brown that looked like stained wood, plus a rich, creamy head. The smell was rich and deep, full of roasted malts and nutty tones. The smell reminded me of some British Brown Ales. The taste was well balanced: sweet roasted malts with the taste of nuts, but also a rich, hoppy aftertaste. The carbonation tingled the tongue a bit, and the mouthfeel was medium-to-light. This is a beer that I could slowly sip on for hours."
"D: Tasty but too sweet for me, goes down easy, not too filling, itâ€™s a decent beer to stick with but only if youâ€™re ok with the sweetness and you want something with just a mild kick. Personally, I wouldnâ€™t drink too much of it, but I can see why other might."
"Easy drinkability. Roasted malt is what this one is all about. Mixed feelings about it, personally."
"The pour was good...a light brown with a thick white head, which lasted the entire drink of the beer. The smell was absent...even when first opened. Dont get me wrong...it had a smell, but the first smell was of a beer that was left out on the table all night...not impressed. Nonetheless, I kept on, as anyone with an open mind (and open beer) would do. The taste was pretty good...a real fall flavour of nut and maybe a hint of apple. Easy beer to drink; smooth with a pleasant flavour. I would call this an average beer. Nothing to write home about...although I am writing to you about it...hmm."
"Though not a really great fall beer, Long Trail Harvest proved to be a decent brew, if only for being an interesting take on the Amber/Red style. Though, much like the label states, they didn't really seem to know what they were doing, so how should we be expected to either?"
"this is one of my favorite local seasonals. it's very well balanced between a caramel malty brown brew and a lighter beer. i think it even says something like that on the bottle. very drinkable, subtle sweetness but overall kind of a refreshing brown beer. definitly better than some other fall offerings but nothing i'd kill my mother for."
"Very drinkable and somewhat thin lifeless mouthfeel. I'm glad I only bought one, although it seems as if other reviews have found this to be better than I. Maybe things have changed with the recipe?"
"Poured a brilliant clear light bronze color with some deep burnt orange hue a frothy,tight 1/2 finger well retained head atop,somewhat muted aromas some caramel and butter with an underlying light roastiness not much hop presence to it.Flavors tend to be on the malty side the hops provide some earthiness mainly starts out somewhat sweet and buttery like caramel corn almost with a defient toatiness underneath the earthiness finishes this beer out in a drying finish.Not a bad brew seems to be pretty basic in the amber category I personally would have liked a more hop presence in a harvest ale but this is a quaffing ale. Thanks to Sam and Jeff from Red White And Brew in Florence for reccomending this beer. It is yet another enjoyable that they have steered me toward"
"Another good beer from Long Trail."
"Pours a dark amber color with a one-finger head. Aroma is nice and malty upfront with some smokiness (sounds too familiar). Taste is very strong at first with almost little or no malt flavor at first. After allowing the beer to warm up for a few minutes, the taste becomes somewhat more complex and smoky. I would say it's drinkable and would be a good beer for a feast or a fall barbeque on a warm day (which by the way, are rare in VT during the autumn)."
"Brew pours to a nice brown highlighted color with a smallish head that left only a slight amount of lace. Has the look of fresh brewed ice tea. The aromas seem to be very inviting, nice heavy toasted malt scent mixed with a slight bread dough scent mixed with cocoa? The flavors are nice, malt is very noticeable which seem to give off a slight fruit like flavor, which seems to break quickly to a nutty like taste. The feel is very smooth as well as possessing a slight dry like finish. Over all I feel that this is a very good offering, a highly drinkable brew."
"Rosey copper color with very little head but some OK lacing. The aroma brings fairly distinct malt with some yeast and carmel. Pretty sweet smelling. The first taste hits me with a more sour combination of wheat and brown sugar. A bit fizzy and a little watery. With a few more mouthfulls it tames down to more of an even bread & citrus blend, still a bit sour though. Easy drinking and somewhat refreshing but not my favorite taste for an ale."
"A sturdy offering. Pair this one with a hamburger. A definite selection if you want more then one. An above average beer in a very crowded style. Try it but don't expect the best ever."
"D: Good smooth easy drinking session brew."
"Think 3/4 busch light mixed with 1/4 post road pumpkin ale. Not enough good to outweigh the bad."
"Pours amber red. Not much head,and almost no lacing. Smell is weak, sweet nalts mainly. Body is thin with some carbionation. Taste was just alright. Watery malt, with a hint of spice in the finish. This beer was not awful, but I would not buy it again."
"Sorry, but I had to eighty-six it after a couple of sip's."
"On sale at Shaw's for 10.99 a twelver. Pours dark golden brown. Smells very weakly of malt (or maybe my sinuses don't work) Taste is a lot better, very malty, some hop in the background, balances well. Overall a pretty good beer, doesn't blow me away but a nice drinkable beer. Worth it."
"Overall a very easy drinking amber. Very quaffable and sessionable. A good autumn brew."
"Poured a brilliant clear light bronze color with some deep burnt orange hue a frothy,tight 1/2 finger well retained head atop,somewhat muted aromas some caramel and butter with an underlying light roastiness not much hop presence to it.Flavors tend to be on the malty side the hops provide some earthiness mainly starts out somewhat sweet and buttery like caramel corn almost with a defient toatiness underneath the earthiness finishes this beer out in a drying finish.Not a bad brew seems to be pretty basic in the amber category I personally would have liked a more hop presence in a harvest ale but this is a quaffing ale."
"DA: Easy to drink. not very interesting."
"Cheers!"
"M&D - full bodied as i mentioned, a great complex, smooth and satisfying beer, Long Trail perpetuates their great reputation for me with this offering"
"Overall- A blah Amber. Not worth the $10 price for a 6er. Doesn't do it for me!!"
"This offering from Long Trail pours a deep red clear with a thin head off-white. The nose is caramel, nutty, faint hop presence that continues sweet with a strong floural and fruit background. The taste is somewhat bitter with a strong hop citrus rind bitterness. The mouthfeel then moves to a malty sweet caramel, maple syrup balancing act that finishes somewhat tart in nature. This is a quality session brew one that you can drink all day."
"Par for the course for a Long Trail offering: slightly above average. Dry and a little too buttery for my liking."
"I had this on tap in upstate VT while on-site for work. MUCH better than out of the bottle, I'm not sure if they have a problem with their bottling machine or if I just got a bad batch but after enjoying this beer very much I bought a case to bring home and it turned out disappointing at best. Average amber, the taste from the tap is delicious. I wouldn't say I'd buy it again but if it were on tap next to say a Sam Adams Seasonal this would certainly be my first choice."
"A good cross-over beer."
"A classic red ale. Simple and yummy. I can picture this beer being amazing on cask. A great session beer."
"The poor was smooth and formed a nice white head. The foam faded to a thin layer fast, but still left good lacing on the sides of the pint. The color was rich copper and quite clear. The smell was nice and malty with few noticeable hop tones; true for the style and the Â“apparentÂ” style this beer is meant to mimic. The taste was malty and somewhat complex with a good selection of malt varieties including biscuit and possibly some Vienna malt. The hop balance was right on, not enough to make the beer bitter but enough to make this brew not too sweet. The mouthfeel was clean and somewhat creamy but not rich or heavy. Very drinkable but nothing to get excited about here."
"Smells very malty with almost a smoked or peated aroma. Smells quite good. Taste is mellow with a smooth feel. Malts hit the palate and please the tastebuds. The malts add a nice characterstic to this beer and really make this beer. Flowery hops are present and add to this tasty brew. I really enjoyed this beer and will try to get it again. The aftertaste is very malty and pleasing. Delicious!"
"This is a balanced and tasty brew. I love all the Long Trail Products that I have tried including thier flavored wheat. Scary, but true. Pours a dark transparent amber with a short lived off-white head that was rather short-lived. A profile that is balanced toward the malty side with a nice floral nose and biscuits and and sweet malt up front some bittering afterwards. Another fine product that is mellow enough to enjoy as an every day or a session beer."
"Pours a reddish copper with a two finger white head. There isn't a lot to say about the aroma...it's malty with an underlying sweetness. The taste is very similar. It starts off malty and a prodigious volume of carbonation brings on the underlying seetness. This is a decent beer in the sense that it is very clean and smooth, but it certainly won't challenge your palate. It seems like it would make a nice beer for Autumn tailgating or for around a campfire...something with a little substance but still easy to quaff. It just isn't something to sit and savour, in my opinion."
"This is an easy drinking tasty beer. It almost reminds me of a mild brown ale. I've got to go get another one now that my glass is empty!"
"Amber-brown color. Small head of 5mm holds pretty well. Smell is true to the harvest description --somewhat malty and rustic. The taste is caramellish malt with some slight sourness in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and drinkability is average. I guess everyone has to make an amber ale. They are not my favorite style and this is far from the best of them that I have tried. Still-- worth trying."
"Poured a dense, cream colored head that left patches of lace. Icy, copper colored beer shows little sign of carbonation. Lot's of malt in the aroma, toasted bread, some caramel and some tree bark (?, something strange). Solid doughy malt mixed with a some banana and caramel, yum! I swear there is a bit of chocolate and a few raspberries in the finish. Body is solid, which is impressive for the amount of malt you can taste in this beer. Tastes like an amber and a dunkelweizzen got buisy!"
"Overall = A great ale that I highly recommend. Would be a perfect everyday ale that doesn't overwhelm you at all but is full of flavor and character."
"buy it, it isnt a typical american amber, it leans more towards a blend of amber and a brown, and does it very very well. I will be getting more of this tommorow."
"Good Fall beer...it tastes like the season."
"This is a great fall Amber. The slick caramel malt presence compliments the style very well. The warmer it gets the more complex it seems to get. Very tasty - recommended."
"Tapped at Pool Factory in Manchester, CT for the Fall. Make sure you ask them to not give you the iced and dripping glasses which seem to be their only consistent feature. Reasonable amber tone with an off-white head that held and smeared. Heavy malting on the nose with something that reminds me of old wet cedar. The malts hit solidly on the tongue fading and giving way to hoppiness at the back of your tongue. There was a certain aftertaste that was slightly heavy (like it was heated or something) that didn't bode well. Good carbonation and somewhat chewable, well overwall. Drinkable but I suspect it'd be better if the Factory itself was better."
"D - Aside from the over-effervescent mouthfeel, the gentle and balanced tastes in this beer make it easy to drink up. A decent, but decidedly pedestrian offer from Long Trail."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Smooth and just slightly prickly in the mouth, this one goes down too easily. The texture is so nice and easy, certainly not watery but not too beefy either. After finishing this bottle on nearly an empty stomach, there is absolutely no trace of the alcohol's effects, guaranteeing that this will be a session brew this fall. Another win for Long Trail. Cheers!"
"The beer pours a nice clear amber color with a light coating of head that falls to barely coat the brew. The nose is moderately buttery with a caramel base behind it. The flavor is also slightly buttery without a whole lot more going for it. The body is moderate with a light carbonation. Overall, an easy drinking brew, but I'm not overly keen on the flavors or aroma. IT might work better as a scottish. I expect at least some hop in a harvest ale."
"Pours a dark amber color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of caramel malts and some American hops with some butterscotch. The flavor has a lot to be desired. It's slightly drying and the flavor just isn't very interesting. There is some caramel malt and some hop character, but it just doesn't meld well and it doesn't have what I want to taste. The body is sligthly thin and the drinkability is ok."
"Medium bodied and smooth, a real standout amoung the fall/oktoberfest beers."
"Dark copper-amber with a small, off-khaki head. Smells of toasted caramel malt, some nuttiness, slight maple syrup sweetness, and a small hop spice. Roasty-bitter hop twinkle of flavor up front. Toasted, caramelly malt mid-palate that grows breadier and sweeter into the yeasty, lightly bitter finish. Not bad. Light-medium body, with a crisp, dry feel. A nice session beer."
"The taste was of medium malts and bitter hops, and it was crisp and dry. A very good brew. Mouthfeel was a little watery, but overall it was nice."
"CheersÂ…"
"Nice stuff to quell spicy chili."
"It has a flavor that reminds me of a cool morning in New England."
"The aftertaste is excellent with a buttery malt flavor that is beautifully counter-balanced with a sharp hop balance. Worth seeking out."
"This is a great Fall session beer from a VT brewery. I look forward to most of this breweries seasonals every year and this one is no exception."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" beige head above the deep copper brew. Head somewhat short-lived, but great lacing. Well-balanced aroma with caramel malts and mild hops character. Taste follows the nose, with a little less depth of malt character than I expected. Mouthfeel is good, and drinkability is great. A nice seasonal from the guys at Long Trail, worth getting if you see it."
"The beer pours a nice amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is awesome. It has a very sweet and fruity smelling malt aroma that refreshes. The taste is good. It has a sweet, yet slightly dry malty flavor that boasts of pale and crystal malts. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine harvest brew. It has good flavor and aroma; a good drinker."
"Freshly imported from Vermont, this ale pours a nice dark amber color with a nice thick head with nice lacing. The smell was nothing spectacular but the intial sip left a nice smokey taste. The flavor is very subtle and not overpowering in anyway. This ale is quite smooth and very drinkable."
"Pours out a deep copper color with a shade of gold in there. Light carbonation can be seen with turns into lacing afterwards. Smell was nice. Toasted malts, caramel, nutty aromas, and some light hops are in the background to balance it out. Taste was good. Pretty much the same as the nose but with a little more hop bitterness comes up in the end. Some nice toffee and toasted flavors show up in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was light to medium. Mouthfeel got a little ding because it was a little bit watery in the aftertaste. But other than that, a top 3 fall seasonal for me. Just goes down too fast."
"Using all of the malt and hops from their other beers is kind of a gimmick, but they pull it off."
"I must say I was shocked by this beer, didn't expect much. Poured brownish auburn with a big thick lasting head. I loved the smell, had hints of honey. The mouthfeel was wonderfully fluid and mouth coating. The blend of flavors is quite impressive (honey, woodsy, roasty). Very drinkable and quenching brew. Highly recommended!"
"Thanks to rabidawg for it."
"Not a super flavorfull beer....taste profile is subtle but nice....well done amber...there are better ambers around but this is solid....I don't think I would seek it out again though..."
"beer."
"Nice offering from Long Trail. Dark amber in color with decent head, receding slowly. Coming right at me are the spices and the hops. I want to open the window to let the October New England night air in here. I will drink this again as it is available all around here."
"The beer cascades from the bottle in the form of a limpid dark copper color, the head is modest in size, bubbly in texture, and a light tan color, the lace is a covering sheet. Nice malt nose, caramel and fresh, sweet start with a rather thin top. Finish is crisply acidic; hops are resplendent in their spiciness, quite dry aftertaste, and a decent drinking beer."
"Very similar to the bottled version, with a touch less diacetyl through the flavor. The butterscotch isn't so overwhelming. Pleasant toasty caramel maltiness, with mild herbal hopping in the finish. The beer still retains that signature Long Trail coarseness and grainy finish, but it's a bit better on tap."
"Taste is bitter hops up front, followed by big rich malt and followed again by a big hoppy bitterness. Lots going on here. Nutty and thick feeling, like syrup. Sticky. A bit unbalanced with the hops overpowering the malt at the end but otherwise is nicely conceived. Very nice fall brew for chilly New England falls."
"Pours out a deep amber brown with a light head. The varity of malts and hops in this brew is vast and it shows in flavor for it. Tastes bold and beautiful. Very well balanced, but not as smooth as I would have liked. Certainly a very drinkable brew. A worthy substitute if the store is sold out of Jinx."
"Reddish amber with a thin disappearing head. The smell is interesting with a touch of maple and fresh bread. Interesting. A chewy caramel flavor runs throughout the profile with flashing hints of dark malts, crystal, and either Special B or a touch of chocolate. Slight hops but only in flavor, not in bitterness or aroma. Nicely balanced. The finish is sweet. An interesting beer that is very smooth and drinkable. The commercial version of a ""kitchen sink"" beer that home brewers do with leftover grains and much better. There is a flavor I canÂ’t identify still that adds a bit of mystery to the brew, causing me to have another."
"Dark copper color with an off-white frothy head that sinks quickly. Low aroma of sweet malt and flowers, a little buttery. Flavor is light and sweet, mild malt, also a bit flowery with some notes of popcorn. Low hop presence. Smooth mouthfeel, carbonation a bit on the low side. Flavor is a bit too mild for me."
"The taste was a bit of a letdown. Very flat across the malt profile, thinish mouthfeel, and very little hop character that was enjoyable. I'm really suprised how much I didn't like this beer after reading previous reviews. Thought it would be my kind of brown."
"Poured a deep brown color with a medium head with low retention. The nose was awesome, a mix of caramel notes and piney hops. The flavor was very bitter, balanced by a bit of sweet malts and finishing with an astingent sourness. It was very smooth drinking and plenty refreshing. So far one of my favorite Fall seasonals. Though I wonder how this is categorized as a PA."
"Pours a clear auburn amber with a small tan head that sticks around and leaves good lacing. Aroma is all over the place with the maltiness - bready, caramel, and lots of nuttiness. Flavor, again, is dominated with maltiness - nuttiness up front, some caramel and bread, and a bit of chocolate show up in there. Hops flavor and aroma are at a minimum here, but the flavor is still pretty large and diverse. Body is medium-full, and it goes down dangerously easy."
"Poured a beautiful chocolate creamy head. Smell was nice and malty. Taste had a hint of tartness embedded in a nice malt base. Mouthfeel was light to medium bodied, but had enough kick at the end to let you know it wasn't that light. A nice ""sit down"" beer well worth sipping through and leaves you with a nice aftertaste."
"Notes: I truly wish this weren't so carbonated, but it's still the beast fall seasonal I've had. Certainly my favorite of Long Trail's offerings. You won't be disappointed with this one, although the greenness might stand for some mellowing."
"This is a terrifically tasty brew.  Pours a deep amber, almost reddish color, with a thin, clingy head.  The head falls quickly, but the wisps that remain leave decent lace.  The smell is fantastic:  toasted malts and a background of floral hops.  Medium body, great malt character, and a slightly bitter finish.  It's one of those beers that I can keep sniffing and sipping all night."
"i love this beer. it was at the latest sampling session, and it was just marvelous. smooth creamy malts just melt into you as you throw it back. not that alcoholic malty taste, but a nice clean sweet maltiness that just makes you tingle"
"Smooooooooooooooooooooth. Creamy amber beer that goes down like butta. Lots of malt flavor, and comes out with some serious sweetness, but not sugary-sweet. Definitely a winner with me. Did I mention the maltiness?"
"Aroma is malty - almost like toasted whole wheat bread with hints of hop & sweetness. A nicely complex brew - flavors of cocoa, toast, nuts, some fruitiness, and a decent amount of hop bitterness combine to keep your entire mouth interested. A beer that's perfectly suited to its release - you can practically taste & smell fallen leaves on a Vermont lane. Stupidly poetic, yes, but that's the image the flavor of this one conjures up. A fall favorite, and one of Long Trail's better efforts."
"Gotta give props to pbrian for sending this one my way."
"While probably inspired by an Octoberfest, that is just a starting point. This brew forges it's own path. Probably my favorite Long Trail."
"A clear russet body is topped by a creamy, light tan head that drops fairly quickly but holds an exceptional collar and light surface coating, and leaves some nice lace as well. The aroma is gently fruity, lightly chocolatey and somewhat nutty. The body is light with a very fine & gentle carbonation that leaves it quite smooth and creamy in the mouth. The flavor starts with some fruitiness (summer berries, very light cherry), mellows into a toasty & nutty maltiness, and then turns lightly cocoa-ish character. It finishes with a softly fluttering bitterness and lingering biscuity & nutty character. Light, and far from rich, but full of character that keeps it interesting. Exceptionally drinkable."
"Pours a great bright amber color with a nice light tan head that sinks but never disappears and laces the glass very nicely.  Very nice toasty malt aroma with a nice citric hoppiness of grapefruits and some other hoppy fruitiness.  Nice toasty maltiness that carries all the way through the beer and holds it up nicely.  The chewy resinny hops come through about half way through and have a nice piney/citrus character that is almost chewy.  The smoothness of the malt balances nicely with a crisp quality that the hops provide and make this one excellently drinkable brew.  Yet another big winner from Long Trail, excellent beer.  A big thanks to pbrian for the brew."
"Ahh, my first fall beer of the season.  Life is good.  Looks beautiful in the glass - clear reddish amber with thick sticky head.  Toasty, nutty aromas with small amounts of flowery hops.  Malt profile is deep and complex, toasted and biscuity with some nuttiness.  Drier overall but a little sweetness coats the mouth.  Nice beer."
"By far, my favorite in the Long Trail family.  Let this one sit for a while after taking it out of the fridge, or else you're depriving yourself of the true greatness of this beer.  Flavors/aromas galore.  A great seasonal and a great ale overall."
"Notes: A fall seasonal sure to please the hard core ale drinkers. Serve at cellar temp and it is to die for. A smorgasbord for the senses to make for a truly great brew."
