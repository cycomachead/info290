Aroma is caramel malts, hints of roasted nuts and a nice shot of piney hops. Well put together and definitly more robust then I thought it would be. As I take the first sip a light to medium body washes over me and thoroughly impresses with its depth. Caramel, bready tones, hints of light hops all seem to come together nearly perfectly as it fades in and out of the palate.

That might appear to be the case here, as this ale has very little flavor to speak of, and this leaves some unfulfilled expectations for the style. All that can really be tasted is a dry, all-purpose flour and water mix with a sawdusted finish. It might be said that the minimal flavor at least achieves a certain benign cleanliness. But there's nothing sweet or nutty here and the malts lend no enticement or pizzazz.","RedDiamond","Mar 29, 2009"

Malty for sure with a light caramelly, toffee malt base and a mild nutty, chocolatey undertone. Balanced with bittering hops, but no real flavor or aroma from hops. Medium body, but thins toward the end. Finishes pretty clean and crisp for a malty beer. Weak looking, similar to a cola without the fizziness. Head retention wanted to stick around, but wasn't really able to. Would have again, but won't go far out of the way for it.","BEERchitect","Jul 25, 2006"
3.35,-3.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Pours an amberish light brown with about half of an inch in rather thick foam head on top. The head is a nice treat actually, not expected. Strong nutty aromas permeate the nostril cavities, along with a touch of caramel toffeeness. It's not a sock-loser, but no disappointment either. Mouthfeel is average, if a bit thin without being too watery. Flavor is dominated by a sweet buttery toffee, and a slight background of nuttiness. Finishing the swig is enough hop character to be noticed, not really expecting more than that for this style. All in all, seems to be a well balanced brew for the style, falls short of the brews from England, but is also cheaper than those brews, so there's a reason to try it, other than a slightly above average session brew here.","AudioGilz","Jul 14, 2006"

Clarity is excellent, with a healthy carbonation cascading up from from the bottom of the glass, helping maintain that head. Nose is caramel and brown sugar sweet, with a underlying nuttyness and melanoidan toastyness that meld well together. Its a good balance of roast/toast and sweet. Flavor is more dominated by the nutty charcter, but with a light brown sugary sweetness there to balance. It finishes very nutty, with a mild toasty melanoidan character. I like how the flavor really stays on into the finish. Its very clean, with nothing in there to get in the way. As I drink more of it and it warms up, there is an almost orange tinge to it, that I could do without. Feel is moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. I could stand a touch more carbonation to keep it from feeling too thick and break things up a bit. Its not bad, just what I would do differently. Drinkability on this one is good for me.

It has a light, yet malty flavor that is smooth on the way down and dry on the finish. It has a light crystal malt sweetness and a nutty aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine.

Flavor is a bit creamy and nutty with an aftertaste that lingers and reminds me of a macrobrew attempt at a nut brown. Not terribly pleasing. The mouthfeel is thin, borderline watery.

The nose is a nice blend of english hops, caramel and a nutty aroma. Packed with crystal malt flavor and a mild nut taste in the back, the aftertaste shows both herbal english hop flavor and dry american citrus.

The beer has a clear chestnut brown appearance with more than ample carbination. Too much in my opinion for this style. Has a slightly nutty, toffeeish malty aroma up front. The malt disappears fast in the middle and is overtaken by herbal hops. The finish leaves some of the nuttyness behind. I feel that the body is way too thin and the hops and carbination are taking centerstage where the malt should be.

3.25,-6.1,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Nice deep brown color on the pour, the head modest in size, frothy consistency, lace adequate, both a light beige color. Malt dominates the slightly nutty sweet nose. Sweet start, relatively skimpy top, delicately hopped, sparingly acidic, dry aftertaste, Ive had both the bottle and draught versions, seem to be about the same to me, drinkable, and would make a good session beer.","Gusler","Nov 14, 2002"
3.13,-9.5,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"This brown ale pours a nice, dark brown color off the tap, but there's no head to speak of. Tastes of sweet maltiness and possesses a nutty character, as well. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, leaving much to be desired. Due to the rather watery mouthfeel, this drinks easily, but it isn't one that I plan on coming back to in the future. Fairly standard fare all the way around.","Jon","Oct 17, 2002"
3.82,10.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Ed.'s note: add a pinch of granulated brown sugar right after the pour, let it settle into the head. Adds a nice big fluffy tan head and balances the watery finish. Happened by accident as I was cleaning my kitchen.","StevieW","Jun 03, 2002"
3.44,-0.6,3.5,2,4,3.5,4,"First off, I've never had a beer that smelled this bad while tasting so good.  It had a caramel scent, with very heavy undertones of wet dog.  At this point I was sure I'd hate it, even though it looked pretty appetizing (nice dark reddish amber, with a healthy head).  Anyhoo, bottoms up.  Surprisingly, the brew tasted pretty good.  Chocolate and hazelnut flavors combine to form a smooth, tasty beer.  Maybe I should actually drink this from the bottle?","Viking","Apr 22, 2002"
3.88,12.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a nice brown with a light tan foamy head that sticks around pretty well.  Smell is caramely with some roasted malt in the background.  Roasted malt and some light hops are the first to hit the tongue.  The hops are soon subdued by the caramel and background nutty flavor.  Smooth across the palate and very drinkable.  I really like this brewery.  They don't ever make anything that blows my mind but all of their beers are at least great session brews.  Consistent quality and very widely available.  This or another Redhook brew are often what I fall back on when I am at a bar with poor choices.","Murph","Apr 05, 2002"

4.06,17.3,5,4,4,4,4,"Clear medium-brown that poured a two-finger head and held a serious lace. Big time malt nose. Malt start with hints of chocolate and an underlying roasted barley flavor finishes with bitter hops. Well-balanced and toasty. A touch of roasted barley mixed in with the sweet malts give this beer its nutty taste. A fine American Brown. I'm honestly surprised the average review is as low as it is, This is a mighty tasty brown IMO.","inebrius","Mar 26, 2002"
3.33,-3.8,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Looks good in the glass.  Smells like, well, beer.  Not a terrible malty brew, with hops barely peeking its head now and again.","pbrian","Mar 25, 2002"
4.12,19.1,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"I'm not real big (or real experienced) with brown ales, but I like this one as an easy drinking beverage.  I love the toastiness of the malt..Not overly sweet either, and after binging on doppels the past month this hits the spot nicely.  Not a powerhouse of flavor but pretty tasty for a brown.  Easy drinking with a twinge of hop bite on the back of the tounge...seems very balanced and easy drinking.  I really think this is pretty good compared to the handfull of brown ales I've tried.","ZAP","Mar 13, 2002"
2.93,-15.3,3,2.5,2.5,3.5,4,"Drinkable, not harsh at all but thin it is. More or less riding on the lightness with a slight toasted malt flavour. There are far better brown ales out there.","Jason","Feb 24, 2002"
3.95,14.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Notes: Very drinkable, an excellent ale for light beer drinkers that want a little more.","BeerAdvocate","Mar 06, 1998"
