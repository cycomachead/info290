"2014 bottle. First I really enjoy brown ales, maduro being a common occurance Every year I get Bolita and it's been good. This years was a step above. Pours dark brown, slight cream head. Smell is sweet"

"Poured into a glass from a bomber.  This beer was extremely dark for a brown ale and very heavy.  Nutty and malty with hints of chocolate in the aftertaste.  Also a tad woody and finishes clean with a dash of bitterness.  Had this beer awhile ago and hope to see it on the shelves again."

"Pours a deep brown with a tan head that leaves nice lacing. Aroma is rich and malty, with dark fruit notes. The taste is similar, with a delicious malty sweetness that really hides the 9% abv. A nice medium mouth feel with little carbonation. A really good imperial brown ale."

"Poured at a good temperature with a modest, thick, light tan head that soon settled and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a clear cherry brown with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is cocoa, malt, leather, mild tobacco. Flavor's not as good as nose as there are notes of raisins and molasses which I don't find appealing in this kind of beer. Body is hurt by those Flavor's too which clashes and leaves high points. Finish like taste, is longish, and a tad boozy."
"Pours a clear brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toast, and metallic aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour caramel and toast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but nothing too memorable in my opinion."

"Nothing great about this beer, just ok for a brown with a slightly bland but confusing mix of flavors. Pours a dark brown almost mahogany in the light with a ring of brown lace. Smells a bit of toffee with a similar taste of nuttiness, sweet caramel, burnt brown sugar, coffee and a touch of chocolate. Mouthfeel medium carbed with a bitter aftertaste."

"O - Glad to try this, and a very different beer from the core Maduro Brown. This bottle had a good year of age on it so a fresher bottle might be a bit different."

"Pours dark brown with nice head. The smell doesn't really smell like a nut brown. Kind of doesn't smell much like anything I've had actually. Luckily the taste came through and was very good. Kind if heavy and thick with some chocolate notes coming through. Very smooth on the tough. Overall, I enjoyed it. Might not be world class but its definitely one that I enjoyed."

"O/D - Very much what they tried to put together, I think. A nice beer that was pretty drinkable for the ABV."
""
""
""
""
"The nose is rich, with notes of notes, chocolate and molasses. The palate mainly follows the nose but is sadly less expressive, a bit faint with not much length in it. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky but a bit thin."

""
""
""
""
"O) This was a very nice higher octane Brown Ale. I could see myself reaching for this one on occasion if it were available here in Wisconsin. Glad to recommend...."

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/22/2012. Pours almost black dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, prune, light nuttiness, and earth; a bit of estery alcohol that reduces a bit as it warms. Pretty nice aromas with good malt complexity and balance. Taste of caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, nuttiness, roasted malt, dark bread, molasses, light dark fruit, and light earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, molasses, nuttiness, dark bread, light dark fruitiness, and light earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of malt flavors; some slight estery off flavors, but not too bad; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good imperial brown ale. Huge robustness of flavor with good balance; and quite smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering."

"Overall- There's definitely loads of malt here, but the all-around package is just... bad. I've never encountered DMS at this level in a bottled production brewery's product, but if I had to guess that's what this one is displaying. Quality control, please. This never should have even made it into the bottles."
"Overall: A pretty good brew, definitely one of the better brown ales I've had. Crisp and strong with a sweet feel that still makes you appreciate quality. Salud!"
""
""
"O - Definitely infected but actually still pretty decent - just different than intended, a bit of a twang on the tongue...but some smokey and roasty and earthy malt still comes thru. A bit dry overall from the infection."

"This a truly outstanding beer for the style. I am not generally a fan of the style but this one circumvents all preconceptions of the style. Absolutely loved this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – One of my favorites here. Never disappoints and is a fairly complex brew. Tastey all day long but works well with desserts. Nice."
"Pours a dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma of roasted nuts, light roasted malt, caramel malt, and light fruitiness. Flavor has a nice smokey/oaky edge with roasted nuts, roasted malt, and maybe a touch of coffee. I like the smoked aspect of this beer, very tasty! Robust palate and creamy too."
""
""
"One of my first CCB brews when I moved to Florida. Pours deep brown with a small cream colored head. Not a huge aroma, but nice faint roast, some sweetness, and a bit of hazelnut that overtakes anything else. Then you drink it! Flavor is excellent, slightly chocolatey, light roast, and with a complex nutty finish. Medium high carbonation and medium mouthfeel, very easy to drink. Really excellent brown ale. Yum!"
""
""
""
"Not my favorite offering from CCB, but still very good. A bit like a stronger version of Maduro with more of a roasted peanut taste."
""

"O- bolita may be the best brown ale I have ever tasted. The presence of sour flavor compliments all the extensive flavors in this brew. I need cigar city to come to syracuse asap!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"CHEERS!!"
"D - pretty decent double brown. I wish the weird flavors weren't present because I could tell what was under them was a really nice brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown with a thick, foamy head that slowly recedes leaving light lacing on the glass. Smell is toffee and chocolate. Taste is nutty and chocolately with some carbonic bite and a raisiny finish. Feel is medium bodied with light carbonation. This is a nice sipper that's heavy, but not too boozy. It could stand to be a bit heavier-bodied to match the taste, but overall this is quite good."
""
""
"Pours a dark cola brown with a ruby hue against light; mostly clear. Massive rocky, foamy light tan head that dissipates slowly with soapy lacing. Slightly tart, fruity nose lurks under the robust brown ale notes; molasses, peanut, brown sugar and ash. Syrupy thick body, highly carbonated and fizzy. Much more berry fruit in the flavor and tartness in the finish. I assume there is a nice imperial brown ale hiding here, I get some milk chocolate, brown sugar and peanuts in the flavor, but the infection ruins it."
""
""
"O- Wish this was available to me in NY. A fantastic take on the classic English Brown Ale. Big alcohol bite, wonderful warming cocoa and charred wood and spice. Really nice creaminess with a surprising hoppy punch."
""
""
""
""
"O - A little on the sweet side, but hat seems to work really well for this beer. Still has elements of a traditional brown ale, just amped up a bit"
""
""
"o - very pleasurable"
""
"O - What a treat. It's mild like most browns yet has several subtly interesting and pleasant things going on. Nice gentle buzz. Really a great beer. They say it would pair well with a cigar and they're right. I've never heard of a double brown but I'm so on board with the idea now. Turns out it's exactly what I wanted. This brewery continues to impress."
""
"O - fine tasting beer if you like sweet ones; for me, the drinkability suffers a bit due to the thick, sweet body; really nice nut flavors come through sweet base"
"O- This beer was decent, but not my favorite. I definitely prefer the Maduro. I liked the smoothness and creaminess of the beer, however it was slightly too nutty and the chocolate taste was a little bit too syrupy. The ABV was well hidden and the beer was easily drinkable, the only improvement they could make is to take a little bit of the chocolate syrup flavor out. Overall a good beer, but some improvements could be made."
""
""
"O: Strange beer to me because it came across much sweeter than expected. The sweetness was interesting but I wanted more malt. Alcohol was well hidden well and I did enjoy drinking it. However, in a bar situation one pint probably would have been enough."
""
""
"O- terrific. unusual style to be hoppy for a brown ale."
""
"D= Not a bad beer, but the oxidized/wood/paper notes in the aroma and flavor were disappointing."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Liked this quite a bit. Loved the heavy chocolate aroma and flavors. On the heavier side for style, but makes up for it in terms of taste."
""
"This is a really solid beer. The flavor is excellent and complex. It loses some points because the nose wasn't particularly appetizing, but overall I really enjoyed it."
""
"O: A pretty good beer, overall, though more like a stout than a brown ale. Still, it smells great and tastes good."
"O: Really enjoyed this one, just a flavor bomb, and nice warming effect along with it. I want to say it's like a good brown ale met a good strong ale."
""
"This might be my first double brown ale, but Bolita seems to capture the idea of the style nicely. A bit sweet, but it shows off some decent brown flavors."
"Not a ton of experience with this style, especially the double/imperial version, but I'm really digging this one. Sam Smith was my fave English Brown... until some crazy brewery from FL decided to make a double version. YUM!"
"Overall: This is one of the better brown ales on the mark. I don't think I would change anything about this beer"

"Bottle: Poured a deep cloudy brown color ale with a nice light brown foamy head with great retention and very good lacing. Aroma of caramelized nutty malt with light dry hops is very interesting. Taste is a nice mix between caramelized malt with balanced level of sweetens and a light dry hoppy finish. Body is full with great carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Very easily drinkable brew with nice level of complexity."

"I can't give 1's across the board because I know this beer's actual potential. Hopefully CCB has done a little better with their quality control since the time I purchased this brew. I had heard stories of random infections in CCB brews but this beer confirmed it."
"This pours a cloudy espresso consistancy with a beautiful coffee cream colored lacing. The foam head lasted a few minutes, and from then on had a thin lacing. The aroma that comes off this has sweet coffee, malty, and herbal hop notes. The taste has a lot of english yeast notes, along with a beautiful sweet coffee and herbal hop taste. The mouthfeel is rich and thick with a medium carbonation. Overall, this beer is one of the best brown ales I have had so far. It is really rich and malty along with a nice herbal hoppiness. This also very drinkable and it would be very easy to drink 4-5 in one sitting. On a side note, this would very good with a nice steak, because it would bring out the nice caramelized flavors of the steak. This beer is very good, and very drinkable."
"750ml bottle Pours a very dark but see through brown colorn with nice nice thick cream-like dark head. The smell is of roasted malts and sweet caramel, this is a complex smell I get some different ever time I smell I even get some like woddy shell like smell. Taste isn't too sweet like I was thinking it was going to be I get a roasty nut flavor with some bitter sweet chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel with a nice smooth finish. This was a good complex beer and not too boozy considering the alcohol."
"Cheers!"
"Overall: A very drinkable, complex brown ale. I was quite surprised by the complexity and the mouthfeel of this beer. I highly recommend it to anyone who can get their hands on some."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side and carbonation is low. Overall, in it's current state it was a pretty bad beer. This unfortunately seems to be a trend with too many Cigar City beers I've tried. The rest of this one is getting poured out after this review."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"O: A very good beer, hard to say that it is a good example of a ""style"" since they call it a double nut brown, but it has some of the nut brown character. This reminds me of a dryer/ less sweet version of Young's Double Chocolate Stout without the massive chocolate, by that I mean there is a lot of richness that I don't associate with an english brown or porter, but the flavors match pretty well with a brown. I would not mind a sixer of this on occasion, but a 750ml is too pricy/hard to drink. Highly recommended, definitely worth trying."
"Pours a fairly solid dark brown/black with no highlights when held to light. Creamy tan head slowly dissipates to a cap with moderate lace. Smells like a brown ale. Brown Sugar, caramel, hints of chocolate, dark fruits all play a role in the nose here. Taste is fruity, sugary, earthy, caramely, mineraly. Taste starts off with a bit of brown sugar, milk chocolate and sweet dark fruits, then a bit of ethanol hits, quickly more of the fruit comes back in, then an earthy flavor mixes with a bit of caramel that lingers long after every sip. Medium to thick body, light carbonation with a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Great big brown ale, I loved it!"
"D: This is a perfect after-dinner drink."
"Pours a deep brown, with some mahogany highlights. Creamy tan coloured head, fades to a thin film and fairly thick collar - both retain well. Nose is brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger and an assortment of other spices. Some large caramel notes as well. Taste takes on more roast and nut character, caramel and sugary notes with some dark fruits, which take a back seat to the sugar and spice going on in the forefront. Some bitter chocolate notes as well, more spicing finishes off on the palate. Mouthfeel is moderately thick, roast and spices linger on the tongue. Quite nice, although it feel like it lacks something to take it to the next level. Overly spiced perhaps? Maybe. A pleasant and interesting 'double' brown ale nonetheless."
"There are all the flavours there of a thick, big flavour bomb, but it just falls short on the wham factor that I otherwise expected."
"Jason's bottle. Another big CC beer, vold taste, rich, earthy, yeasty. The aroma was industrial level funky sour. Dark with a great soapy head. Ginger, chocolate, vanilla,lots of roast. Imperial brown. Carbonation right there. Decent drinkability, but another CC I would have only once.Full mouthfeel."
"Nice beer, but I wish I loved it more. It has a lot of nice characters, but it's missing cohesion for me."
"Please Cigar City, come to New Jersey!"
"Overall, it's not too bad. Not too drinkable for me though. It's quite a thick mouth feel & a little much to me. It's my first real rodeo w/ this style. I enjoyed the first glass by itself & then paired this w/ a piece of Riesen chocolate. That really helped get ride of some of the burn. Seemed to play w/ each other really well."
"Drink- It was 90 degrees outside and poured into a foam cup. Good times. This was actually my first beer from CCB not counting Marron. Nice beer."
"O - I'll definitely re-review this beer, but as for now this was a huge disappointment."
"The mouthfeel is very nice, it's got the full sticky CCB body that I know and love, and the drinkability is downright dangerous for the ABV. Overall, this is a great beer marred only slightly by a bit of off-taste on the finish. I'm looking forward to trying some from the next batch to see if it's just batch variation."
"Pours a brown-ish to black color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet nuttiness and a small roast. In the taste, a small roast, nutty, and a small alcohol and boozy flavor in the end. A small alcohol bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry nut and alcohol in the aftertaste. A big brown ale, nice hints of alcohol, watch, it sneaks up on you too!"
"4/4/4/4/3.5"
"D - Count me as a big fan."
"O: This beer is almost creating a new genre. I'd call it a nut brown stout. It was a really enjoyable experience even though I was drinking it on my balcony on a nice summer night. This is more of a winter sipper."
"O: a great beer that doesn't quite hide its imperial strength well enough."
"O: I had a hard time reviewing this one. I bought this bottle last December and just decided to finally open it up (this one was not infected in any way), but I just wasn't in the mood for such a deep heavy beer on a summer day. Also, if you were to rate this beer to the style, it doesn't fit it in the least, but it really doesn't claim to either. Overall, I found this beer to be rather enjoyable. Complex, but not overly so. Very well balanced and quite flavorful."
"O - I may have gotten this at the beginning of an infection or maybe it's just overcarbonated and the tartness is supposed to be there. Either way, I enjoyed the bottled I had. Will have to grab another bottle in the future and compare."
"It is a medium bodied brew boasting a modest level of carbonation. Easy drinking despite the green character surrounding it with a light tingle of alcohol that keeps things in check."
"It poured a dark, dark chocolate brown in color with a one finger, creamy beige colored head. The beer poured full in body and was very viscous. It smells of lightly roasted malts, moderate sweet chocolate, light nuttiness, and some cream. It tastes of sweet chocolate, light roast, and has a nice nutty finish that isn't too much and finishes quite sweet. Like their other beers that come in 750s that I've had so far, it drinks very, very smoothly. Overall I do enjoy this beer but after awhile, it does get to be a little sweet. That's keeping me from rating it higher. It's a solid beer and from what I understand, a steal for the price."
"I'm a big enough Cigar City fan to be almost counted a homer, but I'm grossly disappointed with back-to-back bad bottles. Good thing there were a hellacious amount of other excellent beers in that box Mike!"
"O: great tasting all-around beer"
"O- well this is one bad beer. Totally infected and barely consumable. I'm fighting my way through the glass but I'm not sure if I can do it."
"Good medium body on this bordering a bit on the heavier side. Nice soft carbonation here too. This is a well crafted beer. Probably one of the more enjoyable ones of the style that I've had. Tone down the yeast and this one is rock solid."
"I like this, but I wish it had a little less yeast spice. The malt flavors are nice."
"O- Very happy with this take on a brown ale. The alcohol is well-hidden, and the mouthfeel is thicker than almost any in its category. A fine offering from Cigar City, as they continue to impress me."
"I took an 8oz sample from 1 750ml bottle and poured into snifter on 04/25/2011. Dark brown and black topped by a mocha head. Great retention and good lace. My nose immediately picks up an off flavor- not much else going on here. This is bad. I taste a metallic off flavor, slight malty caramel- a bitterness bites the tongue. An inspection of the bottle shows rust on the cap and on the mouth of the bottle which could explain the bad taste. Full body with decent carbonation. Clearly I had a bad bottle and a definite drain pour. I will try again with another bottle in the future and edit my review."
"O: CCB's Bolita Brown is a really killer interpretation of a fairly played out style. Good drinking all around - one of the best brown's on the market."
"O-at first, i was drinking this, amazed, thinking of how lucky i was being able to sip on such a fantastic brew, but then i remembered i bought this for $7.99 at a world market. to me thats an amazing price for a perfect CCB 750mL beer, and to find it at a world market, no less. this is an amazing brown ale. it is so completely drinkable."
"Beer is thinner than i expected and boozier than I expected, the flavors are dominantly sweet malt followed by ethanol followed by a mild bitterness on the finish. It almost tastes like it was aged in a barrel but not quite. I enjoyed it but the booziness got to be after a bit. I'd have (a small amount) again."
"TONS of roasted nuttiness. Unbelievably smooth and creamy. I could drink 6 of these massive pint bottles and still want more. A seasonal brew with no specific release time(whenever they feel its ready i guess). If you can find this I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it."
"My first Cigar City beer fell a little short for me, but that doesn’t mean I will not be trying more of them. The sweetness is just a little too over the top for me."
"Dark brown with off white head. Nice lacing and retention. The smell is sweet, fruity, with notes of chocolate. The taste is nutty, some cocoa characteristics, sweet malts, dark fruit, some woody and roasted notes. Simple but good. Earthy hops in the back with a little floral character. Thick and a bit syrupy. Overall, very drinkable."
"D/O- Started on this without knowing as much as what style it was. It grew on me over 11 ounces to be blunt. Recommended for Brown Ale fans. My first Cigar City."
"Rich dark brown pour, just menacing looking with a huge tan head that just towered over the top of the glass. Fading slowly it left behind tons of side glass lacing and a huge amount of spider like webs. Aroma was sweet and spicy at the same time. Notes of rye, brown sugar, molasses like touches and hints of coffee are all coming through very clearly. Each sip now seem to get a bit more complex then the one before it, really very well done here. Rich chocolate notes blending well now with huge malts and a touch of rye that are just fantastic. Light suagry finish with a touch of hops in the back, just enough to push it over the edge for me. ABV is very well hidden and had no issues at all with polishing this one off."
"Picked up a large bottle at Abe's for $9.50 and split ti with a friend. I generally love Cigar City beers, but this one fell flat for me. There was a big fruity, wine-like character with a little roast and chocolate. But it was disappointingly simple. The body was heavy and smooth for the most part, with just balancing bitterness. For the weight of this brown ale, I'd expect more varied notes. Maybe it just needs time is a cellar, or has had too much. Either way I like this brewery enough to give this another shot eventually. To be continued."
"D - Very drinkable, great blend of roasted malts and sweetness. I highly recommend this brew. I would get this brew again"
"O- A delicious English Brown Ale with interesting flavor profiles. The lack of noticeable ABV makes this dangerously drinkable. Though this has got to be a clichè I could really see enjoying this with a cigar. Can't wait to try other Cigar City brews."
"Overall this is a delicious beer, but I still prefer the regular Maduro Brown from Cigar City because of availability and sessionable ABV. Definitely a great beer with ZERO indication of the 9% ABV. This is worth trying if available, I don't NEED to revisit it and you don't have to break you back to get it but still recommended."
"the beer was very nice some very nice well put flavors my only problem was the molasses flavor towards the end of the bottle of a little annoying"
"definitely a unique and tasty take on the classic style."
"Overall: I thought I remembered enjoying this beer more the first time I had it. I thought it was good and I would have it again. The flavors I'm picking up with the malt are nice together."
"Not sure I really ever fully understood or completely enjoyed this beer. Nothing wrong with it, but I'm just not sure there is anything really right with it either."
"DB- I suppose it does feel like a double nut brown. Huge all around brown ale flavors. A bit sweet for my taste though."
"There seems to be a really rich, satiating, tasty beer here somewhere, but that is slowly being consumed by something that shouldn't be here. This is still not full blown infected yet, but it is on its way and with all the residual sugars these bottles might get quite explosive."
"Basically a brown ale on steroids. At the time I didn't know this was an English style nut brown, that explains alot, this may be the nuttiest beer I've had. Maybe a little too sweet for my tastes, definitely a beer to split, but good."
"Very good beer, it balances nicely. Very rich. A good buy for sure."
"O- eh. The booziness comes off pretty strongly, and I don't like how the combination of flavors really jives all that much. It's not BAD...but I've had better"
"Chewy, tasty, and sweet - this is a huge dessert of a beer. I will enjoy every one of the 25 ounces in this bottle!"
"Drinkability is really good here despite the high abv. Would love to try this on tap."
"Falls a bit short on drinkabilty (for the style), but in general, it's a tasty treat that I could find room for 50oz of."
"Drinkability: This was a treat! While JustinA1 and I weren't too impressed with Bolita Double Nut Brown early on, it really grew on us as it warmed. Delicious!"
"I poured from a bomber into a snifter, deep brown pour with a slight white head, no lacing. The aroma has chocolate, toffee. The flavor is pretty much like the nose, chocolate and toffee, with a lingering nutty/chocolate finish. The beer is medium in body, adequete carbonation, well hidden alcohol. Even though it is not my favorite style, I did like this beer, nice interpretation of the style."
"I would try this again as it is an interesting example of the style."
"D--This beer really falls flat. It really does smells and tastes like dirt. Not recommended."
"Overall a very nice brew from CCB, this is not my favorite style in the world as is the case for many BA however i found this to be quite enjoyable and will be able to finish the 750mL bottle no problem."
"Overall: Very good beer overall. This reminded me more of a milk stout than a brown ale, but since Imperial Brown Ale isn't a real style I won't deduct any points for that. This is a beer that is worth trying. Another good offering from Cigar City."
"Shared with my brewing partner. Pours super dark brownish black, amazing looking creamy head chestnut in color. So dense it leaves lacing reminicent of guiness. Aroma is nutty, with some wafts of alcohol. Taste is chocolate and hazelnut forward with a medium long roasty finish. Highly drinkable and smooth for such a big beer. Creamy and smooth over the palate. I don't like brown ales, I keep telling myself that...but this beer begs the question, do I?"
"D: A pretty good imperial brown ale with light bitter hopping and a lot of attention to the nut side of the flavor equation. I liked CCB's standrad brown ale about as much, but I am glad I could try this one."
"Ultimately it's one I'd revisit upon aging, because the malt character seems to be pretty interesting and could develop some nice roasty notes. Plus the guy on the bottle is old."
"I find this beer to be very enjoyable and even more so as it warms up."
"Average drink. Good for a tasting but not for everyday use"
"I think it tastes like a jacked-up Maduro....lots and lots of roast, coffee, nuts, with more obvious thickness and alcohol. Good, but I'd probably rather have a Maduro, as I find its flavor profile similar, with less alcohol."
"Mouth is wonderfully smooth without being too heavy or chewy. While not the most intricate CCB beer, this is a very nice representation of a typically under appreciated style. This would make a great candidate for an addition to CCB's six pack lineup."
"Very interesting and good beer. Subtle flavors that blend well together."
"M - On the fuller side of medium bodied, viscous, chewy."
"This is a very easy drinker for 9% and a very good brown ale. Highly recommended."
"D: The drinkability is very good as the 750 went down with no trouble at all. Another solid offering from Cigar City. A likely repeat purchase."
"Cheers..."
"Poured a beautiful drk brown with an inch of medium brown head with good retention. Surprising dark fruits, toffee, nuts and cocoa hit the nose. Chocolate, dark malts, toffee, butterscotch and hazelnut compromise the taste. Chewy mouthfeel, low carbonation, and a smooth aftertaste with a slight bit of alcohol warmth. Very drinkable, an excellent sipper."
"I could sip this, but I don't because I like it and may have issues with self control. The body is on the heavier side of medium, it has substance without feeling like a meal. It does have a nice creamy mouthfeel, as anything Double Nut should. The carbonation is good as well. Overall a great brew from Cigar City. Also, a great nut brown, a style I feel has been lacking in quality examples my entire drinking career."
"Drinkability: ABV be damned, this is an all night kind of beer -- really great set of flavors and a body that isn't too heavy or thick or chewy or anything."
"Full-bodied, rich and creamy. Very light effervescence (see above). Smooth with a slight coating. An extremely good brew."
"This beer pours a dark, opaque brown, with a nice tan head, that laces the glass. It's a very complex beer, with little aroma. I'm surprised that will this big and complex a beer, the aroma isn't more. The taste makes up for this though! It's a bit sweet. Chocolate, molasses and brown sugar dominate the taste. A great beer to drink on a cold night. This will warm you up! Another hit for Cigar City."
"Drinkability: The alcohol makes itself known in this brew. Overall, it goes down easy but it does pack a punch."
"D- Great brown, VERY easy to drink"
"(63rd)"
"Overall this was a nice beer to end my long day with. I feel like brown ales get a bad wrap becuase they ""rarely ""wow"" people but I would say that this was a great version of the style. If you come across this or get a chance to trade for it I'd say go for it becuase this is another solid beer from the CCB line up."
"Draft. Pours a clear darker reddish mahogany brown color with a tan head. Nutty dark malt aroma in the nose along with some cereal/bread notes with a touch of cocoa. Good lace left on the glass as I drink this down. Sweet chocolate nut at the start balanced with a nice roast bitternss quality. Slight hop finish and ends rather dry. Medium mouthfeel with nice carbonation."
"D: Definitely a sipper because it is thick and almost too boozy. Very enjoyable, but I don't see myself drinking a lot of this in one sitting."
"D: Not the easiest drinker in the world, but quite tasty and worth a try for sure. Another great offering from Cigar City!"
"D: Once again, I am absolutely amazed by the craftsmanship exhibited by CCB. I normally don't indulge in brown ales, but this one is a masterpiece. Absolutely worth checking out."
"Overall this is still a great beer. Seek it out."
"All in all, this is an ok beer. Probably one of my biggest disappoinments from CC. Funny, it was followed by one of my biggest good surprises from CC. Anyway, I'd say try this if you like other CC stuff just to give their lineup a try. If you do not like the black licorice taste, then avoid."
"Another great beer from CCB!"
"Awesome beer, cigar city continues to impress me."
"Oct 2010 bottling."
"Thanks to Grant for bringing a growler of this to one of our gatherings. Pours dark brown with only a slight head. Smells of tobacco, cocoa, cherry, hoppy citrus. There are notes of leather and tobacco on the finish, as well as a light roastiness. I love the fact that these guys have a house style and that it comes through so often in their beers, yet everything is still so fresh and interesting. The taste is a nice combo of cherry, tobacco and vanilla, progressing to notes of cocoa, roastiness, and wet earth. A tad sweet in the mouth, but the earthy notes help balance things. Another nice beer from this quite interesting brewery."
"F: Finishes pretty dry despite the initial sweetness, but leaves some hints of brown sugar and molasses, as well as syrupy slight stickiness. Then more porter like dark roast, coffee, with a little chewy malt lingering, more creamy oatmeal, and very porter like tasty finish. The wild contamination is practically gone at this point, it started out on the finish but quickly fades, except for the spicy dry finish that most likely came from the wild yeast. A slight bitterness comes through as well. Despite the wild yeast contamination, it's delicious. I can see what it was supposed to be, and what it is now, and both are delicious either way. I actually love it the way it is and if they said they did it on purpose I would believe them."
"Pours a nice, rich muddy brown color with decent cap of khaki head. Scent is of chocolate, carmel, toffee, roasted nuts, fresh bread. Taste is more agressive then scent dictates with a nice big sweet chocolate and toffee taste backed with a solid roasted nut background. Perfect level of hopping. Medium bodied, smooth and clean. A very good brown ale."
"D: A very savory brew, high ABV, which kind of sneaks up on you as there's not much heat from the 9%. Overall this is a very enjoyable brew."
"Drinkability- Not too shabby. The awkward tartness in the nose sort of threw me (think infection) but it didn't translate to the taste. The hops may be a tad too much for a Nut Brown but all it all it's pretty tasty. Thanks much Joe!"
"Drinkability: I don't think that this was the Brett infected batch, but it has some elements to it that I wasn't crazy about; the cedar and nut skin elements were negatives to my palate"
"Bolita was unexpectedly fruity, almost like some of the Belgian styles, and delivered quite a bit more complexity than I was expecting out of a nut brown. However after reading more about the English Brown Ale style, it makes sense. Not your typical brown ale, but one to sit back and savor. Like all of the Cigar City beers I have had, this was well-crafted and unique."
"d - I thought this was a very interesting ale. I thought it was an odd combination of smells and tastes, but it was still pleasant. Would try again."
"What stood out for me about this brew is the aromas and flavors burst with a variety of nuts including: walnut, almond, pecan, and hazelnut. Hints of earth and alcohol and just an undeniable presence throughout. The finish is dry and not without hops, really a fine beer, as long as you share it."
"Drinkability for this one is near perfect - like a beautifully put together dark chocolate bar with hazlenuts and coffee beans. Only the very light alcohol keeps this from a perfect 5 in this category."
"D: This was really cedary, but it worked better in this beer than it did for the cedar-aged Zhukov. Everything was well harmonized and delicious. A great offering."
"Drinkability? Too damn strong for what I'd call an English Style Brown Ale, something I should be able to drink in fairly large quantities and not find myself feeling buzzed. Yeah, I've had strong ESBAs before and thought the same thing about them but this particular beer, combined with the strange tartness, brings the drinkability down big time. I'm super happy that I got a chance to try it but it is not my ""cup of tea""."
"D: Drink in a pint glass at chilled level."
"Overall: Tasty. Had the BA version and happy to have tried the regular, which I actually prefer."
"D: Likable drink, a pleasing sipper that ended a relaxed Wednesday evening. Subtle warmth goes to the head a little too noticeably, but an otherwise fine nightcap. Glad to have a second bottle, thanks to fine Florida BA Sebastien!"
"D: Excellent! CCB has taken this style to a whole new level!"
"Poured from a large bottle into an Ommegang glass. Cloudy dark brown with a creamy light brown head. THe double nut gives it more body, thickness to the beer. Superb flavors mollases, spice, (the nuttyness of course), and a nice finish. HArd to get but.... I live close to the brewery."
"4/4/4.5/4/4.5"
"Deep chocolate brown in colr with a nice tan head. Second pouring from a 750 ml was quite muddy actually. Nutty and toasted aroma. Slight lactic or sour tinge to it. Beefy malt upfront with quite a pronounced nuttiness and woody flavor. Lingering cocoa notes. Again has a lactic twang going on. Grainy tasting. Decent enough body. Overall an ok beer. Double brown doesnt strike me as an easy style to pull off. Would rather try some other Cigar City beers going forward."
"Drinkabilty: The mouthfeel and the abv are a bit of a challenge but I think I could get through a 750ml myself."
"D: Strong flavor profile would limit but it hides the 9% well. I think this was a great beer and another winner by CCB. Hoping I make it to Tampa at some point to check these guys out."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich , roasted and crystal malt scent along with a light English yeast fruitiness. The taste is good as well. It has a very rich crystal malt flavor along with some mild hops and a bit of esters in the finish. The alcohol is well integrated and provides a bit of heat in the finish as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an interesting beer. I can't say that I've had too many Imperial brown ales. That said, I feel this would be a fine example of the style."
"Reviewed on 09/06/2009. Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma of roasted nuts, light roasted malt, caramel malt, and light fruits (apple, fig). Flavor has a nice smokey/oaky edge with roasted nuts, roasted malt, smoked apple, and maybe a touch of coffee. I like the smoked aspect of this beer, very tasty! Robust palate and creamy too (however it gets slightly wearing and a little acidic as you go through the beer). Overall, a brown ale I actually enjoyed."
"D - Scary smooth for 9%! I am really enjoying this one and I'm glad my first CCB beer has turned out to be a winner. I am looking forward to trying more styles from this brewery and would recommend this one, no doubt about it."
"Another nice, big, bold Cigar City brew. Much enjoyed."
"I genuinely enjoyed the nose, I really did. The palate, OTOH, is a bit of an infected mess right now, with some of the rich chocolate, toffee and nutty sweetness clashing rather poorly with the mild funk that's grassy with wet hay. Despite all the negativity here, I'm really digging the malt complexity in this beer, and would love to try an uninfected version of this beer. Drying on the finish with some nougat and chocolate, this is solid. Carbonation is a little high for such a big brown ale, but that's probably due to the infection. The body is on the fuller side of medium and compliments the flavors quite well. Sourness is low, it's more funk than sour. Not the most drinkable of beers, but I drank about half the bottle, which isn't bad."
"Poured into a chalice a very nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus creamy tan head, with some nice small islands and sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with some chocolate/toffee notes. The taste is sweet, malty, lots of chocolate/toffee going on, slight vanilla. Medium body, very nice slight bitterness/dry finish, you would never know this was a 9% ABV brew. Very drinkable, an awesome brew, highly recommended."
"Medium body with a lot of smokey roasted malt and sweet caramel notes. Hints of toffee, slight spice and hazelnut with a subtle dry hoppy finish."
"Bolita casts a brownish dark copper color with a 1/2 inch vanilla beige head. Small amounts of coating lace that drips over time. Smells consist of malt, chocolate, toffee, a bunch of nuts. Taste is the same with some added roast and some barley. Somewhere in the medium area. Carb is nice and the alcohol is out of the way. I had no idea this was 9% till I looked. I thought it was in the 6 area. A nice strong brown that does not stray far at all from the style."
"At best, this is a somewhat better then average brown ale. Can't imagine why I'd want to order this beer again."
"This is a good brown."
"Edit: upon examining this beer a little more, I get some vinegar and wild funky notes. I really didn't expect this, but in reality it is quite obvious. Not something I like very much coming from the style. I gotta take the drinkilibilty down a bit, because I just don't feel it."
"drinkability: another world class beer from CC. So far everything I had from them has been fabulous."
"Out of a 750ml capped bottle. Pours a a deep brown color with a tight tan colored head that settled into a chunky ring. The aroma is of mocha and milk chocolate, wet wood and pepper. The taste is big on the milk chocolate and mocha, light roasted malt, some smoke and nut flavors. Has to be one of the tastiest brown ales that I have had. Nice moderate body with semi-soft carbonation give the brew a silky feel, sweet yet with a bitter edge, perhaps a touch sticky in the end. ABV well hidden. This is a mighty fine brew, big and bold for a brown but very drinkable."
"A great brew here, good to see more brews flowing from Florida, now I just need to get my hands on them."
"Overall this is a very nice brown ale. Certainly one of the better ones ive had in a long time. The Barrel Aged version of this beer is an excellent beer, but this one is no slouch either. I got a bottle of the BA bolita to age, and actually i should have got another one of these too. A very complex and interesting brown ale. Very tasty."
"M/D - Palate is fairly light for the ABV, adding to the drinkability. You really don't notice the 9% at all. This is a great beer."
"750ml bottle shared by mfielden recently. Thanks, Mark. Dark hazy brown appearance with two fingers of tan head that retains well. An attractive brown ale. Nutty, malty, toasty aroma; nice but honestly a bit muted for a 9% beast of a brown ale. The taste is inexplicably mellow - if I didn't know any better, I would guess that this was a standard 5% brown ale. Whether that's a good or bad thing I'm not sure, but I'm impressed with how deceptive it is. How does it actually taste, then? Nice but very basic. Toasted grain and nuts, light roastiness and a touch of chocolate in the finish. Smooth from the oats but perhaps a touch overcarbonated for the style. The finish is dry and yeasty with a mild lingering roastiness. Pretty good stuff, one of the better Cigar City beers I've tried so far."
"This beer is very drinkable, not quite as drinkable as the other treatments, but still a great beer."
"This dark brown ale had an enticing aroma with very little head as we poured it for a small group tasting in Bellport last night. The big bodied ale appeared to be very dense in the glassware and the first taste further explained the commotion around its arrival in my area. It had a very enjoyable taste that one could pick out a variety of stronger ale notes, such as elements of coffee, smoke, bourbon, and caramel. The dry chalky aftertaste also reminded me of cocoa bars and I thought a little Partagas cigar might go well with this ale."
"Overall, a nice 'double' brown, and very enjoyable. Wasn't disappointed with this brew, really nice."
"D- Bolita isn't a beer that you are going to drink all night long, but it is a very complex and tasty sipper that seems like it would be the perfect beer pairing with a cigar. Overall, yet another fantastic brew from Cigar City. Keep 'em coming guys!"
"Very excited to find this bottled."
"D - Wow, this is a thick, rich malty beer that has enough hop presence in the finish to balance and keep it drinkable. I don't really get much nuttiness from the malt, but the surprisingly dark chocolate and tobacco notes are better anyway. Not exactly a session beer, but pretty drinkable nonetheless; a complex and thoroughly enjoyable beer."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is huge here. It dosen't at all feel like a 9% brew. Overall, yet another top notch offering from CCB. Kudos again to Joey and Wayne. Skal."
"Pours a dark brown to black in color with a decent sized creamy, medium tan head which slowly fades with some nice lacing. Aroma is a deliciously sweet maltiness, strong molasses, sugary caramel, toffee, and some cola as well. A bit of woodiness and dark ripe fruit too. Taste follows and lives up to the aroma, big malty beer, sweet caramel and sugary toffee mixes with some nutty and earthy qualities, molasses in the finish. Big and creamy, medium to heavy mouthfeel, a bit of hoppiness balances with a slight peppery feel on the tongue and a very nice dryness in the finish. Very good brown, the alcohol is well balanced and it drinks way too easy for a 9% beer, delicious and sweet, hope this one gets bottled some day, one of the few browns that I would definitely keep in the cellar. Big thanks to Jay for the sample."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of things for a brown ale and I've probably describe this one more as an imperial brown than a traditional English brown. Either way, it's tasty and I've enjoyed both the brown ales I've had from CCB."
"Overall this is a very good ""imperial brown"" that melds a bunch of flavors together very well. Certainly worth a shot."
"I have to say this is one of my favorite brown ales I have had."
"D-I which I had ordered a second instead of the IPA that ordered when my food came. I also can't wait until CCB starts bottling the Bolita Brown so I can take it back home with me."
"This brown ale pours a nice, comforting deep brown with a tan head that fades fairly quickly. Aromas are of warm malts, fruity esters, and a hint of cantaloupe? Mouth feel leaves nothing to be desired... creamy and substantial. Roasty, slightly sweet malts dominate the flavor with hints of almonds and pecans and just a bit of warming alcohol at the finish. This is an extremely drinkable ale and a definite ""must try"" if you're looking for worthy brews from Florida."
"Pours clear, but quite dark brown. Thinner tanish head. After letting it sit out for a short while I get toffee on the nose. Flavor is slightly sweet. Minor roasted and coffee tones, but the sweet character stays dominant here. Feel has a pretty vibrant carbonation on there and the liquid is thicker on the body. This is a pretty thick beer. Brown Ale? Sure I guess. Seems like an Imperial Brown Ale if you ask me. Thick and hearty. Not a traditional interpretation."
"Growler courtesy of JRedner. Pours a dark milk chocolate color with a thin tannish head. Aroma is malt, toffee, spice, some chocolate. Flavor is much of the same with some rip fruit and cinnamon notes. Medium to full body with a lingering malty finish. Nice ale."
"D: Not my favorite style, but this is one of the better examples."
