Really the cocoa powder is the, I use this term loosely, dominant aroma. The flavor is much the same. Unsweetened cocoa powder, just a slight nuttiness, and toasted grains. Due to a rather thin body for the beer, the toasted grains give just a slight astringency to it that's noticeable on the finish.

The feel is rather light and watery for the style, fizzy carbonation, finishes fairly balanced. A nice tasting brown ale, good nut flavors. The appearance and feel are a bit subpar.

Rich malt flavor with hints of chocolate and caramel. Nuttiness shows up in the finish. What's weird to me is that the alcohol comes through strongly and is somewhat harsh. Not expected from a lower ABV. Would have thought it was nearer 8% or so. Thinnish body, also unexpected when considering the dark appearance. Overall pretty good and drinkable. Worth a try.","Hoagie1973","Jul 12, 2008"

A delicious malty, nutty aroma, which the flavor can't quite deliver on... Perhaps a little too much bitterness at the end, or not enough hops to balance the malt, maybe a little too much carbonation.

Roasted flavors - but none of the burnt business and way light on chocolate or coffee. Maybe just the bit of a tang of cascades as you're starting to swallow but the finish is all that roasty sweetness. Sorry if I give it low drinkability - it just seems a little off to me. I mean...

3.27,-8.9,3.5,4,3.5,2,2.5,"Drinkability is medium, but is hindered by the carbonation and is far too sweet to be followed by a second.","Naes","Jul 26, 2005"
3.75,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,3,"Tasty. The smell is of coffee and chocolate and the head barely makes it to half an inch. It pours a really nice dark brown amber color. The taste is greatttt. I noticed chocolate flavors and nutty malts. Also a little coffee. It is smooth and syrupy while at the same time a tad watery. Im not really picking up the fruityness that the others are but this is really sweet. Anyways in my opinion this is so much better than a Newcastle plus you don't get that nasty English Sewege smell.","kbnooshay","May 01, 2005"
3.67,2.2,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured a transparant brown/deep ruby color. Not much head but pretty good lace. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate. Taste is of course roasted malt with coffee and chocolate tones but it also has a "fruityness" to it. I can't quite put my finger on it but its very unique. Adds another dimension to what would otherwise be an average brown ale. High carbonation. Leaves a nice roasted aftertaste on the sides of the tongue. Decent drinkability.","sabrills70","Apr 11, 2005"
3.64,1.4,3.5,4.5,3,3.5,4,"Bender Factor: Another sweet session brew from Ithaca. Interesting that the smell is so complex and the mouth is so intermixed. Perhaps some smoothing out in needed? I truly enjoy their sampler pack now it's available here in the B'lo. Looking forward to a long awaited trip to Ithaca Brewing.","wailingwench","Mar 12, 2005"
2.91,-18.9,3,2,3,2.5,4,"Boring. Probably good for someone who doesn't like "dark" beers. Might be a nice gateway brew.","krberg","Feb 08, 2005"
3.38,-5.8,4,3.5,3,3,4,"Had this brew last evening, actually finished the 6 pack that I got a few weeks ago. The brew poured to a dark brown color with a nice thick off white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing around the top half of the beer glass. The aroma has what I call an earthy tone with highlights of coffee roasted malt and chocolate a pretty nice smelling brew. The tastes seem to be highlighted by chocolate, coffee and caramel that lead to a nutty like flavor. I do not notice much of a hop taste or aroma from this brew. Over all I like it, not a favorite but it is a New York product so I have an interest. I would get this again but it will not be one that I would go out of my way to locate.","Stimack","Jan 16, 2005"
3.33,-7.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Finger Lakes Nut Brown is a decent dark lager, but as an English brown ale it falls short. One could give it the benefit of the doubt and say that perhaps the brewers were shooting for the light end of the style spectrum, but I'm not inclined to be that generous. While not by a large margin, it's worse than (my) average.","BuckeyeNation","Nov 10, 2004"
3.57,-0.6,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"It may have been affected by travel and storage, but the mouthfeel, carbonation, body, and texture of the beer seem bruised. Dangerously close to (but not actually) syrupy, not enough bubbles, and thin in some unidentifiable sense. I remember enjoying the first bottles of this sixer a lot more than this one. Reminds me of the Czech lagers I had that tried to mimic a roasted ale's tastes. The chocolate does mix VERY well with the cheese, I'll say.","cooter","Oct 22, 2004"
3.47,-3.3,3.5,4,3,4,3.5,"Pours a coppery brown color with a short-lived beige head. Grassy, nutty and malty aromas with some hints of chocolate-coated hazelnut and brown sugar. Initially sweet, then turning oddly astringent in its malt, maybe it's hops, though not completely detectable. Nuttiness pretty non-existent in its taste. Leafy hoppiness showing up more as it warms. Pretty good, but not the best example of its style.","crookedhalo","Aug 30, 2004"
3.35,-6.7,3.5,3.5,3,3,4,"First imperial pint glass pours with a 1/2" beige head, which laces well. Deeply reddish brown brew, with a slightly nutty caramel malt aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma, caramel malts with a slightly nutty aspect, but there is also a slightly sour fruity flavor. Mouthfeel is average, I would want a bit more heartiness of grain in a nut brown. Drinkability is a bit better, with some interesting flavors to catch your fancy, and smooth yet somewhat thin body that lets you enjoy one after another.","ppoitras","Jul 31, 2004"
3.57,-0.6,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Good malt characteristics, slightly nutty though not overtly. Little to no hops. Pleasant everyday brew, that I wish I had had more of while up in Ithaca for college...","cbl2","Jun 21, 2004"
3.32,-7.5,3,3.5,3,3,4,"Strange that the flavor could be so simple when the aroma was rather complex. A very nice beer that did not blow me away, but one that pleased me. Quaffable.","waughbrew","May 25, 2004"
3.08,-14.2,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Not a stellar brown ale, but I didn't hate it. I had this and their apricot wheat in the same sitting, and I actually liked the wheat ale better. A bit more body would help immensely, with a lower, more english style carbonation.","UnionMade","Mar 29, 2004"
3,-16.4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,2,"This is a middle of the road ut brown. It's not bad, but it had a few flaws that could easily be fixed. The taste was chocolate with a coffee aftertaste. I was slightly bothered by a slight metalic taste.It kind of tasted mediciney. The colour was nice dark brown with a thin tan head that didn't last too long. The smell was of chocolate. I don't feel good drinking it. I feel very uncomfortable with it.","CBFanWish","Mar 13, 2004"
3.46,-3.6,4,3,3.5,3,4,"very dependable brew, but do not expect something mind blowing here. Just a basic brown ale. Color was dark mahogony with an off-white head. Smell was roasted without too much in the way of distinction. Taste had a nutty beginning moving more into a roasted malts taste in the middle with a small hop bite in the finish. Carbonation was a problem here as there was waaaay too much of it considering the style. Good beer to wash down some BBQ with and I did just that.","GreatPondBrewer","Oct 30, 2003"
3.43,-4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"The taste is a lot of nutty roasted malt, as you'd expect by the name. It's also got a certain sweetness and a little pear at the end. Hops appear to be an afterthought, but that really adds to this beer's smoothness. Carbonation is just wee bit too much for a malty dog like this one. A very drinkable beer.","yankeeheel","Oct 29, 2003"
4.47,24.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"I should note, I've heard this is not nearly as good in the bottle as it is on tap. Since I live 5 minutes from the brewery, I've only ever had this on-tap. I will buy a bottle soon and do another review for that, so that I may address these questions.","ithacabaron","Oct 02, 2003"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with an offwhite head that laces the top of the glass. The nose is of toasted malts and nuts. The taste is good. A nice balance between pale, crystal, and victory malts. There is low hopping and a nice "brown type" aftertaste. The beer is medium bodied and is quite drinkable. I'm from this area and drink this beer often. The Nut Brown Ale is one of their best sellers and best tasting beers. It's not the best one of this style, but it's also not the worst.","WesWes","Jun 20, 2003"
3.77,5,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Bottom Line: A good core offering from Ithaca Brewing.","Dantes","Jun 19, 2003"
2.85,-20.6,2.5,2.5,3,3,3,"This is a good nut brown that is rather drinkable and would definitly buy again, however I think I was looking for stronger malt flavors and more lacing.","WanderingFool","Jun 07, 2003"
3.98,10.9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"There's toffee, malt and a little chocolate in the nose. The front is deep and malty toffee. A nice touch of fruit pops up in the middle: plums? There's also lots of chocolate and a little coffee with burnt sugar. The finish is fresh, leaving toasted grains, coffee and chocolate. I really quite like this.","kbub6f","Jun 04, 2003"
3.37,-6.1,2.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"Notes: Not a bad brown ale, but not entirely inspiring. It's basic to its core, but that's just fine with me. Still tasty and worth a try.","Todd","Sep 16, 2002"
3.47,-3.3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had this on a visit to the Finger Lakes.  Overall perception is of chocolate malt and roasted grains.  Deep brown color with very little head.  Not much in the way of hops.  Enjoyable beer.","Suds","Jul 07, 2002"
4,11.4,4,4,4,4,4,"A fine example of the brown ale style. Medium-full bodied, rocky tan head.","John","Oct 18, 2001"
