"Pours medium brown with a tinge of dark maroon. A good colored, dark tan head unfortunately dissipated very quickly. Deep aromas of brown sugar, dark fruit, and sweet malt. Taste was underwhelming, some roasty, sweet depth but not much. Small amounts of bitterness and no alcohol bite which was good. Feel was creamy, but with medium high carbonation which was off-putting. Overall a fair brown ale, it met the standard of brown ales well, just left a little to be desired in richness and depth."

"Easy drinking but not bold enough. Does not feel like a craft beer"
"Pours a clear medium brown producing 1.5 fingers of frothy, tan, shortlived head that leaves a slim surface ring & a thin wash of pasty lacing. Aroma dark malt, toast, chocolate, toffee & faint roasted nuts. Taste is fronted by toasted brown bread, a hint of cocoa, roasted nuts, caramel & dark fruity notes at mid-sip & finishing with a note of toffee & bitterness. Aftertaste is burnt malt bitter cocoa & cola caramel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, smooth & creamy with a nice prickly bite."

"Not my favorite. It's bland and almost tastes flat. I really like a couple of the other Real Ale beers"

"O - This is a substantial, thick and malty brown ale in the English style. It is very close to a porter in many ways, which is just fine by me. Extremely clean and well-made. I highly recommend it."

"This beer seems like the halfway point between Bud and Guinness, not sure if that's a compliment or not."
""
""

"O: very black IPA-like; not an English brown ale ... too many hops. it's not bad, just mislabelled stylewise. a brew definitely worth investigating, and for the price not bad at all, especially if you're looking for a more American-style brown ale"

"O: A very dry brown. Kinda gives it a bland flavor that I wasn't a huge fan of. Still a nice easy drinking and flavorful brown."

"Very good for a Brown Ale. Smooth and delicious."

"On the whole this is better than some Brown Ales I've had, but for the English style it's nothing to brag about. On tap at Cricket's in Lubbock. [From notes overlooked after 11/07/2012 tasting]"

"Served in a pint glass, a little under 1/4 inch head dark brown/black color. Smells like nuts, coffee, and syrup. However the taste and feel is very light, it smells heavier than it feels. I can taste molasses with a hint of caramel and subtle smoke. The carbonation isn't bad. All and all not bad for a brown ale. I'll definitely have this again."
"Overall it's quite enjoyable. I have enjoyed beers from this company so far, and plan to try more of them when I can."
""
""
"Popping the top this brew has a smell of pancake syrup and molasses. Pours to a root beer color with a tan head. Taste is sweet yet with just the right bitterness to cleanse the sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth and carbonated just right to bring up the dry milk chocolate flavor. Finish is well balanced as well as it is flatly sweet wit some bitterness. A very smooth drinker. I shall return."

"A decent brown ale, although I would have preferred a more nutty taste which would have kept it more true to style."

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, best by date 9.12.12. This pours a dark brown slightly hazy with a lace leaving tan head which quickly dissipate. The smells are of roasted nuts, caramel, toffee. The feel is medium. The tasts is good enough bitter hops and malts, a little nut flavors with caramel malts."
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours dark toffee brown with a creamy, biege head. The beer is not completely opaque because some ruby brown color is visible along the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates, leaving no lacing along the side of the glass. The aroma is of dark roasted barley malt with some nuttiness and chocolate. The taste follows the nose very well. There are rich flavors from the dark roasted malts that carry some mild sweetness with the roasty character really coming through in the back. There are flavors of chocolate in the front and that nutty character I picked up in the nose coats the tongue really well. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. There is a dry finish to this beer. It is smooth and highly drinkable. This is a very good beer. It is a satisfying brown ale."

"O. It's a solid, smooth brown ale. It's very basic, but it has a nice sweetness to it."

"Another part of my first beer trade with Dolph1979..."

"Served from a bottle into a room temperature mug. Nice nutty flavor. Great mahogany brown color. Not much in the way of a head and is a bit fizzy for my taste but a good overall beer. Some lacing. A beer that is definitely worth another go. Maybe not a regular, but one that will meet a need in a pinch."

"Mouthfeel is somewhat thin. Not very impressive overall."

"O: Pretty decent brown ale. Nothing wrong with it at all but nothing setting it apart either"
"O: I have had this beer a million times and it never gets old. It is a very solid beer and has different qualities that you dont find in other beers. Pretty tasty."
""
""
""
"Have to thank Dave for this one. Pours brown with not much light getting through. Head was off white and went away but laced a little. Smells malty with no hop. Tastes nice and malty with some English hop. Starts sweet and ends semi-dry. Not bad I'd take another if offered."
"O: Would definitely drink this again a big winner for this beer and sadly not available back home."

"Well crafted"
"M:very drinkable with nice sweet beginning and changing for a little bittersweetness."
"O- No off flavors, but there's nothing special about it either. I can't help but think that this is a very safe interpretation of the style. I got it as part of a Real Ale sampler, not a bad beer but I won't be buying it again."
"Overall I'd say it's ok. I am not really disappointed, but it doesn't really excite me either. I got it as part of the sampler pack and I don't regret it, but I probably wouldn't really buy a sixer of this on it's own unless there wasn't really anything else to drink"
"This is a nice brown ale that isn't too sweet. It plays everything safe mostly but still has an interesting taste. I have no real complaints except of the slightly oxidized character. I'd buy it again."
"Drinkability is pretty good, I really enjoy the full flavor, and don't get to drink to many browns in the PNW, so am really enjoying this. Well made."
"Mouthfeel is good as well. Full bodied and slightly complex because it's slightly creamy with a bitter finish. Well done overall. Thanks depechemode1983 for the trade, happy to get to try a good brown ale that isn't available in my area."
"O. I liked this brew, good balance and a good representation of the style. I would definately try this brew again."
"Overall Drinkability - Mild. Astringency stomps all over any delicacy this mild beer attempts to convey."
"Overall, this is a decent brew, though I do find it to be more watery than I would like. Also note that this brew will probably be extremely difficult to find outside of Texas--I only found it near the San Antonio area while visiting my parents."
"Pours opaque brown with translucency around the edges with around 1 finger of head that dissipates to leave a foamy ring. No lacing. Nose is almost nonexistent, deep breaths bring about tiny amounts of coffee notes. Taste is slightly toasty and coffee-y, not very complex but also not bad. Mouthfeel is pretty good, actually, it isn't too thin or dense. Another easy drinker by Real Ale."
"M: Rather good straight from the bottle, smooth & refreshing."
"D - Low ABV, not overbearing. Clean finish. It's a do'er."
"Cheers!!!"
"7.5/10"
"A bit less than average mouthfeel. Silver X's bottle."
"O - A very drinkable brown ale. Slightly above average. A good beer all in all."
"Pours a very dark reddish brown with a one finger light khaki head that disappears rather quickly. Very small amounts of lace. Color looks like a dark iced tea or a weak coffee. This beer has a sour chocolatey smell like baking cocoa. Beer has a light carbonation, and just the right amount of alcohol burn. Taste is where this brew excels. Has a very nutty, caramel taste when it hits the tounge and finishes as a chocolate cake with no icing. Very nice beer. Very good drinkability. Buy a six pack you won't be disappointed!"
"This ale is very dark mahogany in color. A bit cloudy. With fairly small light brown head. Low carbonation. Aroma is malty - reminds me of some baked chocolate dessert. Taste is milder than aroma. Still chocolate. Maybe a bit of coffee and nuts as well. Some hoppy bitterness at the end (too much for my taste). Still fairly mild and very drinkable. Malts and hops seem to diverge at the end."
"Overall pretty good, lots of nice toasty reddish malts, light hops, little sweet and sticky but nice, drinkable."
"Conclusion: This beer isn't trying to blow anybody's mind in any way. It isn't extreme or pretentious. It is simply tasty, smooth, easy to drink, and for that I love it. If I lived in Texas, this would be one of my corner-stone fall and winter session ales."
"O- Mmm. ok, not impressed."
"Overall-Definitely my favorite out of the 3 Real Ales in the sampler pack. Would pick up a 6 pack of this over many others and at a cheaper price. Pretty good brew."
"Overall, a decent effort by Real Ale, but not my favorite from them. If you're ever in South Texas, I recommend Real Ale's Full Moon Pale Rye Ale, and this would make a decent, maltier companion."
"Cloudy reddish brown with little lace and poor head retention. Light coffee aroma. Malty middle and a mild amount of bitterness in the finish. On the dry side with a medium body. Mouthfeel is medium to medium-light carbonation. Not a whole lot going on, but not bad."
"Overall: A very true-to-the-style brown ale. Not the best out there, but there is certainly worse out there and worse for more money. A very sessionable beer and one I could drink all day."
"Enjoyable beer and above the average for it's class. I love getting new to me beers like this as extras."
"Drinkability was pretty good, nothing to write home about...but certainly much better than your typical BMC."
"Pours a dark mocha brown color with a creamy tan head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice bit of lace on the glass. Smell is roasted malt with caramel and not much else to speak of. Taste is nice with some sweet caramel up front and a nice toasty finish with hints of coffee. Mouth is a little too carbonated and slippery for me. Overall a very drinkable beer that was a pleasant surprise."
"D: Decent drinker. Quite good for a small Texas brewery in a beer starved state."
"4/3.5/3.5/3.5/4"
"D - Quite drinkable. Nice and tasty."
"D - Man, this beer was weird to me. It has a really nice appearance and smell. It also opened up nicely but finished terribly. This bottle was ""best by"" 3-6-11, so I wonder if age had something to do with this. Either way, I don't know if I would drink it again."
"I got this in the Real Ale sample pack and it was the 3rd of the 3 that I tried, and midway though the glass, it's my favorite of the 3. Poured slowly into a glass and had a small head that went away fairly quick. I was expecting something similar to a Newcastle, but this is much different than I was expecting. The aroma is very malty and chocolaty. This beer reminds me of a stout with the deep chocolate smell and flavor, somewhat like a Guinness actually. My favorite beer from Real Ale so far."
"Overall damn decent drinkability. Couples good."
"D- Although browns are not my favorite style this one was good enough that I didn't know where the beer actually went. Not bad Real Ale..not bad."
"drinkability - sure, yeah, i guess. but its one and done for me on this one."
"Brewhouse brown ale is a beer that I got in a sampler pack from Real Ale. The age on this beer is fairly good. The color is obviosuly brown with a hint of reddish hue. It tastes relatively average but good none the less. It tastes like a mild dark beer with a moderate hops flavor which reminders me of a cross between Zeigenbock and Shiner. I recommend this as a once in a while beer. It isn't anything special but still pretty good. Not bad. But had better. I'm curious as to how the rest of the Real Ales taste like."
"An average brown, wouldn't go out of my way to have again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a bit below average. Drinkability is good, I enjoyed this one a lot. I really liked the roasty nuttiness it brought with it and thought that supported the caramel sweetness nicely. A pretty good beer overall."
"D=very smooth,i consider this as one of those types of brew you chill out with watching some good football games!!!!Cheers to all!!"
"Honestly this beer is nice & a fine example of the style, but it's a little boring compared to some of the other browns I've had & loved. However, I'd get it over non-local ""boring"" browns (like Newcastle), just 'cause I like supporting the locals. It's a solid brown."
"Overall, a fairly average brown. Nothing to special or out of the ordinary. Somewhat drinkable."
"The beer pours a brown color with a tan head. The aroma is very good. In addition to the caramel and toffee, I also get some earthy hops and a little bit of coffee. I don't get any coffee in the flavor, but it was replaced by chocolate which is a welcome surprise. The flavor also has some caramel and earthy hops, lightly toasted malt. The beer has a very creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A great brown ale."
"Pours a pretty clear brown color with a slightly reddish tinge. The head is small and is tan. Nutty malt aroma in the nose but not really a whole lot more. The taste is sweet up front with a slightly bitter end. Light/medium mouthfeel. Prety dry finish. A fairly ordinary beer that somewhat reminds me of a homebrew."
"D: Well-constructed beer with good flavor profile, goes down easy and would be very sessionable."
"Overall I was satisfied with this beer and I think it's on the better end of average for the style. I'm not sure if I would purchase a 6-er. However, I would happily order it again at a bar."
"I don't know... there's nothing wrong with this beer, but it strikes me as ""cookie-cutter"" brown ale. This isn't one of my favorite beer styles, and it literlly tastes like pretty much every other decent brown ale I've ever had. Nothing wrong with that I guess, and once upon a time I was a fan of Newcastle brown ale, but these days there are just so many other interesting options out there. Mehhhh..."
"Overall a decent brown ale. Nothing exciting but drinkable."
"D: Drinks easy and is pretty good, just nothing spectacular. I'd live more roast and body but this is pretty good."
"Very good beer overall."
"Not outstanding, and neither my favorite brown nor my favorite beer from Real Ale, but not one I'd turn away. I could see really being in the mood for this one - strong flavors, decent moutfeel and a delicious aroma combine for an easily drinkable, nicely sessionable brew."
"Mouthfeel is less carbonated than I would like, but still a decent brown."
"It's good but the flavor on the tongue leaves a little to be desired."
"~Cheers"
"Overall I thought this was a solid brown - nothing spectacular but a nice effort. Worth a shot."
"Overall a tasty brown if browns are your thing. Oi have nothing against them I just would rather drink others beers with more flavor."
"drinkability: highly sessionable with a relatively full flavor. try it."
"While I'd choose other beers over this, it's pretty good overall. Nothing too spectacular or special. I'd probably reach for a newcastle over this, but they are pretty close. Perhaps I'll give it another shot as my tastes and palette expands."
"T/M - Very balanced, slight tea-like tannins, coffee like bitterness in the end, very smooth, light carbonation, medium finish, medium body"
"D - Serves its purpose for a deep ale, fairly filling.."
"+ i've almost forgotten how good this beer is, since i haven't had it in such a long time. i'll have to slide this into rotation again."
"Here's to many more years of drinking this special beer!"
"Worth tracking down by the case-load."
"This beer is decent but not exactly my type. Worth a try."
"Pours with a dark brown color, minimal head, and a semi-transparent body. Has a mainly malty smell with a smidge of chocolate. Taste was very clean. Although it was a darker ale and hard dark qualities it had a nice, crisp finish. Wasn't overpowering or too bitter, it was a nice balance compared to other English brown ales I've had"
"I'm not a big fan of English brown ale, but this is an especially tasty and drinkable example of the style."
"An average brown ale. A bit thin in texture and I was hoping for more in the nose and flavor both."
"Thanks Exiled."
"As is it's an ok beer, I'm sure it's much better when it's not expired :-/"
"D: It's a decent english brown that can be enjoyed for a few servings with friends."
"Pours a redish brown with minimal head that fades away to very spotty lace and a thin layer of bubbles across the top. Smells of malts, molasses, a bit of brown sugar. It has a slight astringency in the nose as well, which unfortunately does appear in the flavor as well. Has a hearty brown ale malt taste to it with a cloying sweetness. There is slight oxidation and astringency and sort of an off chemical flavor to it as well. The chemical taste really stays throughout the finish and into the aftertaste. I can't say that this is my favorite Brown Ale. It's got a nice mouthfeel, but that chemical thing that's going on sort of kills it for me."
"M - Another well done ale from Real Ale Brewing Company. I could have drank much more than the two of these that I had."
"This could be a super sessionable brown if it weren't for the wateriness..."
"Taste gets much better as a nice smooth cocoa flavor comes out and is complimented well by a decent amount of citrus hops. Makes it more than just a one-dimensional brown, if not exactly complex. It is a bit on the lighter side body-wise, and the flavors do feel a bit muted...but what is there is pretty tasty. This is a decent brown ale that I would not mind trying on tap."
"D: This is the best beer out of the Real Ale sample. I could definitely drink six of these."
"Decent atmosphere. Pretty nice appearance, and a subtle but full nose. Flavor is also fairly basic, but full and hearty. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"D: This is a basic brown. There is nothing earth-shattering here. I like to keep it on hand, though. It is a respectable beer that can be had in bunches and enjoyed by all."
"This beer is really drinkable and is fairly light on the mouth. I would recommend a little bit of a higher temp so the flavor comes through. An above average offering, but I could use a little more."
"Verdict: Brewhouse Brown is a tasty, but thoroughly middle-of-the-road Brown Ale. Like the other Real Ale brews I've tried so far this is drinkable and true to style, but at the end of the day, forgettable."
"D: Overall it's an average beer. It is pleasant to drink. Yet, there does seem to be something missing from the beer. Maybe it's just that special pizzazz that remains nameless."
"D: If the hops were dialed down a touch, I'd drink a lot more. Good beer."
"Has a light nut smell to it. Taste brings that scent along with a nutty taste that mellows to a sweet malted flavor. Mouthfeel is light in carbonation, and the consistency is a nice balance."
"All around decent Brown Ale here. I think that I enjoyed the hop profile of this the most, as it played nicely off the roasted notes. Another solid brew from Real Ale."
"Pours a dark brown with a quickly disappearing white head. Sweet smelling; caramel-like. A bit of earthy, metal like hops in there too but the malt smells dominate. Sweet caramel flavors, mild hop bitterness, and maybe a bit of roasted flavor. Not at all cloying, very well balanced. Paired real well with grilled sausage and onions."
"Poured a clear dark brown with fluffy tan colored head. Sweet roasted malt mixed with a nutty, fruity aroma, also some earthy hop. A good nutty roasted malt flavor. It starts a little sweet and then bitters out towards the end. There are some earthy hop flavors going on also but they are masked by the roasted malt flavor. the mouthfeel is rather smooth, and the drinkability is ok. I noticed a slight tang and that is the only thing i didn't like about the beer, otherwise it's ok."
"Nothing too phenomenal about the flavor on this one, but it's solid for the style. A light, peppery caramel and dark fruit sweetness starts things off, giving way to a thin-bodied finish of earthen hops and brown sugar. Mouthfeel has a hard time making up its mind, switching from refreshingly juicy and bubbly at first, to dry and thin on the finish. Still, Real Ale has crafted a tasty, drinkable brown ale with this one...they definitely have the talent to take on more exotic styles and bigger beers (now if only they'd employ that strategy!)"
"Would be a great sessional."
"Overall impression: Decent session beer, nothing to go to far out of your way for."
"I just remembered why I don't like Browns. The mouth smacking mediocrity. There just isn't much going on at all with this beer outside the look. Its just a stripped down beer. No sweetness, no bitterness, little malt, little hop. Its smooth and drinkable. Quaffing this thing may be all its useful for, outside of looking at it. But now, I'm upset that it looked so good only to be so lackluster."
"Overall impression: Pretty straightforward brown ale, but that sour flavor and smell was a bit weird."
"There's a little roughness to this Brown. Nonetheless, it is easy going, not much trouble really."
"This is the first time i've had this beer in a bottle. I regularly have had it fresh on draft and it is way better. The drink by date is expired by 11 dates so maybe thats a reason. Still a good tasting brown ale"
"This brew pours up a dark brown color with a small tan head. the nose is very faint. I get very clean Lager smelling malts, a bit nutty too. the taste is nutty, subtle malts, nice hop balance, medium to light bodied, low to medium carbo. A decent session brew..."
"I think that's enough. There's apparently something about the yeast, or the water, or the process, of this brewery that I just don't care for. No more for me, thanks."
"Thanks Bryan (BigBry) for sending this!"
"Clear brown/burgandy color, thin tan foam. The smell is roasted malt, a little nutty and earthy and maybe just a little chocolate. But mostly roasted malts. The taste is the same as the aroma, lots of roasted malt character which gives more bitterness than the hops if I'm not mistaken. A seriously drinkable brown ale, but not exactly rich or deep (not that the style requires these characteristics). A good representation of a style I don't usually prefer."
"Fairly drinkable, nothing special but not bad either."
"Pours a respectable medium brown. Thin whitish head disappears quickly leaving no lace. Aroma is lightly sweet and malty. Taste is lightly sweet with a good malt body. Good balance with clean finish. Nice and mild brown, excellent session beer and good with food."
"Ok drinkablilty."
"A standard-ish, mild-ish brown that is fine despite small ""detractors"" (a bit of ""wet cardboard", lighter maltiness for style, a touch of yeast and astringency - however - all ""small"" detractors that, despite them is still pretty drinkable/enjoyable)."
"Medium brown, translucent, offwhite, tannish head. Good, soft lacing. Bit of a DSL aroma, sweet malts. Nice malty flavor. The whole flavor fills yr mouth, very nice. Some roast as well. Very round tasting. Complete. Smooth and luscious. Easy to drink. Maybe a bit too much alcohol to be a session beer, but I could see this being just that."
"Overall, one of the better browns I have had... A very underrated beer."
"Decent beer, and quite good for the style."
"Overall a decent beer by Real Ale. Not the greatest Brown Ale I have ever had, but passable."
"Nice easy drinker and another tasty session beer from this brewer. Well done!"
"D: This would be a great session beer, hands down my favorite brown ale that I've tried. All around delicious and spot on, the nose is a little weak, but really everything else is great."
"Pours a clear brown/red with a small off-white head. Little retention and no lacing. Smells lightly of sweet malt and nuts, as well as some pepper. Taste is largely malty with earthy nut notes. Spices here again. Mildly bitter finish. Well balanced but unspectacular. Feel is decent, but a slightly astringent, tongue-curling finish. Not a bad beer overall."
"I like this beer. It's a solid session beer for the house and totally drinkable. Oddly enough, I got this beer because I had fond memories of a few bottles of it I drank over a month ago. Now, I'm not as crazy about it on tap (again, weird) but it's still a nice, sessionable brew. I prefer the Real Ale rye pale ale a bit more, but this is nice. I'll return to the Brewhouse for this again in the future."
"Pours a dark black/burgandy colored body, with almost no head, tan brown in color. Has a weak overall aroma, but very malty aroma, reminiscent of Newcastle. Reminiscent of a porter or a stout, coffee, bitterness, some maltiness."
"D- Eh, decent, but not great."
"Drinkability: It's a pretty basic brown -- take it or leave it."
"D- Drinks well with no offending qualities"
"Gotta love them browns, and don't get enough of them. A ultra-dark brown, almost black pour is finished off with a one-finger bubbly tan head that takes its time retreating, but doesn't make you wait too long either. A thin layer of rolling lacing clings to the nonic. A whiff reveals toasty notes of dark chocolate, malts, and a bit of tea. On the palate there's a slight toast to the malts. Also apparent are some notes of caramel, black licorice, maybe some pine and spice as well as some nuts. The mouth-feel is a little more on the crisp side than most browns, but it works well here, as this one goes down well and has just enough taste to keep it interesting throughout."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a dark cola like brown with a 1/2"" tan head. Didn't get much in the way of lacing. Aroma is swiss chocolate with a little earthy muddiness. Mouthfeel is substantial. You know you're drinking an ale. Taste is mostly chocolate here. Also, some nuts and malts. Not much complexity here."
"Drinkability: Nice beer."
"from mhewes in the Pre-Season Football BiF...notched as best by Dec"
"Pours a foggy brown with a eggshell creme head. Nose is sweet with a nutty edge. Flavor is a bit tangy. Nutty tones are there. And especially show up on the aftertaste. The whole tangy aspect is a but too much, but nothing is ruined really. Feel has a slightly boisterous carbonation and the liquid is slick and sticky. A pretty nice brown ale. Another Real Ale brew I think would be interesting on cask."
"Drinkability: A pleasant surprise, I actually enjoyed this one, despite it not being my favorite style. The alcohol was perfectly manageable, and it was surprisingly complex in both the aroma and the mouth. Dial down the carbonation a little and fix those few slightly funky notes, and we'd be talking about a truly superb English Brown. Give it a shot."
"Mmm, there are great chocolate flavors here. There's an especially nice Swiss chocolate note as this beer transitions to the aftertaste. There's also a nutty, chocolate roast flavor, but this is a very cocoa-centric brew - though it's not overly sweet. For fans of brown ales, chocolate lovers and folks looking for something a little different, give this a try."
"Not a have-to-have favorite of the brown ales, but very drinkable, and one to order if available at a bar."
"Good drinkability on this one is great. A good brown ale all around would be a excellent session brew"
"M/D - Full flavors bring it to life in your mouth but it is just a little on the thin side. A very good brown ale."
"I forgive you though. The bacon pizza more then made up for this. :P"
"Brewhouse Brown Ale is pretty typical Real Ale Brewing Company beer. In other words, it's style accurate, tasty, drinkable... and well short of great. I'd still love to have them relocate to this craft brewery-deficient, craft beer-starved state. Thanks to mhewes for another solid beer from down Texas way."
"Drinkability: Not a great beer. A rather pedestrian attempt at a brown ale. If you like a light tasting brown ale that is not overly malty this is a beer for you. This is the second Real Ale product I have bought since moving to TX two months ago and I found them both underwhelming."
"Drinkability - very sessionable for the fall, a tasty brown."
"The first thing that comes to mind when I pour this into a glass and raise it to my nose is a freshly cut slice of good quality bread. That aroma comes across in spades until the head subsides, after which I'm getting plenty of roasted coffee. Both the taste and the body are a bit of a disappointment after the promise of the nose, but not bad for all that. A slightly sweet flavour with a nice bitter aftertaste. Not much in the way of carbonation. It would be very easy to drink several of these at a sitting."
"Next I popped open a Rio Blanco Pale Ale from the same brewery and found my match. Good brewery but the brown is just not my favorite style these days. This one is average or slightly better. Compares well with Newcastle IMO, this one slightly better."
"Tastes dull chocolate, blackberry hoppy, dry roast. Some burnt grain, like I'd expect in a porter...not sure this fits into a brown ale. No flavors jump out at me, like the personality of a non-descript pothead, ""yeah, man, it's all good"". Sweet and wet on the pull, but dries rather quickly and has a bit of acrid sting from the modest carbonation. Some nut and cream upon further review. Old nut, like been baked in the sun and is flaky dry (mealy?). I know I'm making this sound like an unpleasant beer. It's not unpleasant, it's mildly pleasant. Watery feel in the mouth, even though the beer is md to md-light. Modest carbonation and modest drinkability."
"D: Pretty smooth easy drinking brown ale. It is not one of my favorite styles but I must admit I enjoyed this one."
"Its dark brown with some red showing through on the sides, 1/2 inch light tan head that receided but did leave a small frothy covering. Smell is roasted barley that gives of some slight charcole and coffee smells as well as nutty tones. Taste is pretty much as advertised in the nose its arich grilled coffee tyoe of flavor with some chocolate that I didn't smell and a little bit of a bitter aftertaste but otherwise very little hop preasance. Solid in the mouth rather smooth for being slightly over carbinated. Pretty average drinkability."
"D - Good when not looking for something filling but darker"
"Drinkability is fairly high. Low alcohol and simple but pleasing flavors make this beer quite drinkable."
"Thanks for this beer in our 6-pack trade, brewdlyhooked13!"
"Easily drinkable, quite enjoyable."
"Thanks to turbine2475 for the chance to try this beer. Pours extremely dark brown, almost black with a head that fades quickly. Smells quite malty with a bit of roastiness, molasses, and chocolate. Pretty gentle flavors that are fairly similar to the aromas. Sweet malt and a light roastiness, well integrated, but a bit too mellow. Mouthfeel is smooth rather than creamy. Decent brown ale, but a bit too light, even for the style, to truly enjoy."
"Thanks again Jonathan!"
"D : Really good. Easy to drink."
" not a bad brown."
"I had this on-tap at the Houston Flying Saucer Draught Emporium."
"Drinkability: High, although this is not very interesting."
"Wow. surprised I didn't remember this one. Pours a dark fluid, opaque, but not heavy. One finger head on an aggressive pour that fades quickly. Smell is a rich roasted malt, that personally I'm not a fan of but the taste is the winner here, sweet and light roasted malt flavors. Very drinkable beverage."
"I'm so excited about RealAle, as many Texas brewery's leave a lot to be desired."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a dull, opaque, hazelnut brown. Quarter-inch head dissipated almost immediately into an oily slick; watery lacing with no adhesion. Most prominent scent was chocolate followed by a subtle presence of hops. Flavors were very understated, but well balanced - malt and grain backbone with a slight hops presence and a little bit of nuttiness somewhere in the mix. Mouthfeel was a little lackluster and watery, but not unpleasant. For a Brown Ale, there's not much pop, but this is pretty solid and sessionable all and all. Could do with a little more carbonation though to bring out some of the flavors."
"Overall not a bad brown ale at all, and has renewed my intrest in this little texas brewery. I really thought the flavors came off quite well and that the overall package on this was quite sessionable, The only thing I could say was to put a little more carbonation in it, but other then that, this is totally a beer you should try if you see, dont think it will dissapoint."
"This beer has a deep amber, almost dark ruby appearance with a small, but lacy head. It smells like malts and a hint of coffee. The taste is malty, roasted, rich and a bit acidic. There are hints of coffee and burnt toast. There is a nice creamy mouthfeel with nice carbonation. A very drinkable, delicious brown ale with a great balance of sweetness and bitterness."
"Poured a rich chocolately deep brown with just a bit of head. Smell was subtle at first but became more apparent as it warmed and was a nice almosty equal mix of sweet maltiness and light hoppiness. 1st taste was of slight hoppy bitterness but on the back end it was a very enjoyable sweet, malty, nuttiness, that made for a good smooth aftertaste leaving me wanting more. A great brown ale."
"I concur with my previous review."
"D: Drinkability is pretty good.Although after it warmed it wasn't as pleasant."
"Slightly murky, cola brown with a thick, creamy, long-lasting, light khaki head. Great lacing. Toasted malts, roasted nuts, caramel sweetness, and light vanilla on the nose. Light cardboard and herbal, slightly bitter hops up front. Toasted malt and doughy sweetness mid-palate. Hints of dark chocolate and lacto sweetness before a slightly roasted, moderately bitter, nutty finish. Gently carbonated with a slightly creamy feel. Not bad!"
"Thanks again, Deniz!"
"If this beer (or ale since it is texas) was available in my local grocery store i could see myself picking up a couple sixers to have on hand for my BMC drinking friends as i think this would be an easy transition beer for anyone like that. also a decent session beer with a fairly low abv."
"Bought in a Real Ale Mix 6. Pours a nice dark brown color with a finger of light tan head with some lacing. Smell is rich with aromas of malts with a taste around the same. Their is not much special about this beer but i would consider it a wise choice."
"The second beer I tried in my mix pack. This one is not nearly as good as the Full Moon Pale Rye. Not the worst beer I have tried, but once is enough."
"Easy to drink, with a decent flavor, The mouthfeel really just ruins this beer."
"Pours dark brown--almost black--with red highlights at the edges. The tan head dissipates slowly. It smells of chocolate and malt. It has a chocolatey taste with a nice roasted malt/coffee finish that is not overpowering. I thought it was a little thin, but good. This is a smooth beer, and one I can drink all day long."
"The beer pours well with a nice brown color with a tan creamy head. It has good carbonation for a brown, but the aroma smelled of lightly roasted malt and a little of slightly rotten wood (although the beer was fresh and not skunked). The beer tasted fine; a slightly sweet caramel-malt flavor with an touch of hops at the end."
"Color was near reddish dark brown. Fair head that settled fairly soon. Not much to offer the nose but the flavor was more robust with an initial tang on the front of the tongue. Then a more familiar smokey taste to the back of the mouth. Average sweetness. Small, steady carbonation, fades over the last half of the pint to be a bit more watery but goes down nice enough. Not bad, not great."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date of July notched in the label into a pint glass. It was a dark brown color and had an average tan head that quickly settled to a thin partial film. The aroma was roasted malts with a woody undertone but also had a really weird kinda rotten smell that popped up as well. Couldn't really identify it but not pleasant. The taste was pretty good and on par for an average brown. For me, Avery's Ellie is still the Brown standard. Overall, not a bad beer but not something that I'll be running out to get often. Since it's a local Texas beer and I want to support local beers it'll find a home in my every so often rotation. (3.5, RB, T, Y)"
"M&D - smoother than the smell prognosticated, however nicely malted and with a nice rounded sessionable flavor, quite good, surprisingly so"
"Poured it into a pint glass, it had a nice thick tan head that eventually dispersed into a thin layer along the top of a good looking reddish/brownish body with good carbonation. It has a pleasant roasted malt aroma mixed in and has a nice rich semi-sweet roasted malt flavor thats really refreshing, it is a bit dry and has a fruity bitter aftertaste; the flavors did weaken as the ale warmed up, but it was nothing unbearable."
"Not a bad Brown Ale, more English than American in style. This is a good brown ale to support locally. Recommended."
"Pours out a chocolate brown with a creamy beige head. Leaves rings of sheet-like lacing. Aroma is nutty, chocolatey, toasty, and roasty with some herbal hops and fruity esters. Flavors start out roasty with chocolate and fruity esters following suit. Finishes dry, mildly bitter and ashy from the roastiness. Isn't cloyingly sweet like far too many browns (and this itself is kind of too sweet for me on tap). Nutty aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light to moderate with moderate carbonation. Could be a bit thicker. Excellent drinkability. Not really complex, but I like it. Goes well with some gruyere ."
"An easy drink, a good pick for a hop vacation, and not a bad counterpoint to saltier or more savory food."
"Pours a clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice two finger creamy tan head, tons of sticky lacing throughout the drink. The nose is of malts, slight chocolate, and caramel. The taste is malty and slightly dry finish. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice brown ale, glad to have had a chance to try it out."
"This is one of several beers, that I was all too happy to take from my brother-in-laws refrigerator, when they announced that they were moving, and would not be able to take with them. I'm not sure how old this particular one is, but if memory serves me right, I remember seeing this one in the fridge, and the others, at least three years ago. Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a dark brown, forming a 1 inch fluffy head, that faded rather quickly, but left medium lacing on the glass. The aroma is full of rich malts, sweet, but not much else. The flavor is great! Rich malt, a slight hop aftertaste, and a hint of nut flavoring. The mouthfeel is about average for a brown ale. Overall, this has to be one of the best English brown ales that I've tried! Definitely a great session ale."
"D - Not bad...definitely stronger at the colder temperature. I'm glad I got to try it."
"Nice Brown Ale. Distinctive taste and its good."
"Opinion: This is a pretty good brown ale. I like the depth of flavor and the fact that it isn't overhopped with citrus. This beer is pretty fruity, and that is about the only thing that I think would keep this beer from coming across more like a Bock. I would certainly drink this beer again."
"A good session beer. I would certainly have it again."
"Picked this up as part of an assorted 6-pack during a recent visit to Austin. I guess the alcohol is higher than a mild, but this one is mild in other respects. Aroma and flavor consists of a smooth chocolate that is not overly roasty or sweet. Outside of the choclate, it is clean. No fruitiness. There is no hop aroma or flavor, but just enough bitter to give it balance. This is a good brown. I had it as part of a fairly traditional Thanksgiving meal/dessert. Paired up nicely."
"Medium body, low-to-moderate carbonation. Good balance. Drinkability is good, could easily session this one."
"The best thing about this brew is that it's very flavourful, but at the same time highly drinkable. Believe it or not, you could even drink this if you were thirsty, as it's defenitely not a heavy beer. In my opinion, this is how a brown ale should taste, and it's a must try for anybody who likes this style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the almost clear brown (with burgundy highlights) brew. Head lasts nicely, with prevalent sticky lacing. Aroma is chocolately sweetness. Taste is not short-changed by the nose, the same rich chocolate flavors flourish immediately, and carry on after swallowing. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Not always impressed by browns, but this one is very nice. Worth noting that the bottle label states this is an ""American Brown", but probably only by location. Hops, or comparative lack thereof, makes this perfect for the ""English Brown"" style."
"Easy drinking brown that has some character, very impressed. This would be a nice session ale for sure"
"Cheers2Beers"
"Real Ale is ready to explode, and it's because of quality beers such as this one."
"Drinkable? Sure, if you're looking for a dark beer that is lighter on the tastebuds. Got this one in a sample pack and it's the first I've tried. Hopefully, the Rye Ale and Pale are a better representation of what this place can brew."
"12 ounce bottle."
"This is good session ale regardless of the weather."
"Great flavor and awesome drinkability. It has been a while since I tried this local beer, I need to put it back in rotation."
"Deep dark ruby color with a thin but lasting head. Medium body. Mouthfeel is full and smooth, not too much carbonation to get in the way. Smell is roasty, mellow, chocolaty malts; taste is much the same with coffee and toffee coming in. Much more complexity as it warms. Pleasant drink."
"Poured on tap at JP Hops House. Color is dark brown. Thin head and alluring look. Smells of malt, nuts, and sweetness. The taste is thin but good. Tastes of slight nuts, malty, mildly sweet. Very little hops in this brew. Overall a decent beer. I would have another one."
"PS - The current brewery looks just like this label."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck with a pop top cap. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Clear, brown in hue with a shinny ruby highlight. It is a lovely color. The head was light beige and very bubbly, like a cola. At the apex the foam was two fingers in height and then it faded fairly quickly to a fizzy cap. This cap lasted forever. However, there was no subsequent lacing. Overall, the appearance is solid, I mean, it is just a Brown Ale! What do you expect? Beer porn? The nose is fruity and slightly acidic from the roasted malts, I assume. Largely clean with some modest earthy, nutty notes. I also detect a kiss of herbalness. The nose has poor potency and it fails to be articulate. What a shame. Dammit! Speak up and say something. The palate is very nice; unlike the nose the taste is clearly Brown Ale in nature. I love the style and this one has all the proper flavors. Fruity with sharp acidity from a healthy roast; the malt is like a small porter. Slightly nutty. Clean. It could use a little yeasty residue. The hops offer slight bitterness and some earthiness. The palate is tasty and it is put-together nicely. Long aftertaste. It would be a good beer with a steak or stew. Medium in body with firm carbonation helps produce a sturdy mouthfeel. This beer is drinkable; Id sit back and quaff a six-pack anytime, anyplace. It is a good session beer, plenty simple. I realize this beer isnt earth shattering but I like the style and this beer is decent. Thanks Bdc for the bottle. Worth a try this is yet another solid beer from Real Ale."
"Mouthfeel is a little slick but clean, medium heavy with some carbonation keeping it from getting too thick. Above average for the style but not at the top of my list."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, except that after one or two, i think I would start craving something more interesting. Like beer from many small regional breweries, this is a fine, well crafted beer. It just isn't that exciting, groundbreaking, or extraordinary. But a boring craft brew beats the pants off of just about any American Macro."
"Nice flavor. Slightly sweet with a fairly pleasant malty flavor giving notes of berries and roasted malts. Not offensive."
"Drinkability: A well crafted beer. Easy to drink for me but I'm just not a big fan of the English Brown Ale. Still, I think there is room for improvement with this particular beer."
"A dark, dark brown beer shows reddish highlights. It's mostly clear and sports a big, 3-finger head: pale beige, café-au-lait, dense, thick. Roasted chocolate nuttiness in the nose. Dark cocoa up front turns thinnish through the top. Some nice chocolate malt goes tangy for the roasty, nutty, bitter chocolate, toffee finish. It's just a nice, tasty, roasty, chocolatey brown."
"This is a pretty good brew, maybe not complex enough to be a great beer. Brewhouse Brown pours a nice dark color with dark ruby highlights. The aroma is slightly sweet, but not too strong. The starts moderately sweet and ends with some hops bite. This is a beer I could drink again, but too many in a row would be a little too filling. I enjoyed this beer and can't wait to see what the other Real Ale Company offerings taste like."
"The letdown here was the mouthfeel. The beer felt way too thin on the palette, with an empty feeling that grew with each sip. This was a real downer, as the taste had the beginnings of a good beer. In the end, the watery mouthfeel became the most dominant character. As a result of the light mouthfeel, the alcohol was up front, and not well hidden. I wish that they had worked on the recopied a bit more to get some more malts in the bottle."
"Pours a dark brownish mahogany color with a short light tan head that soon fades into a tight lace. Nose is chocolaty roasted malts and fresh mocha. Moderate in body with a fine carbonation that gives the beer a bit of a crisp mouthfeel. Taste picks up right where the aroma left off with the same chocolaty malts as well as a bit of burnt caramel and dark fruit. Some unusual, though not unpleasant, earthy mineral notes follow along with some mildly bitter hops leaving a dry finish. A pretty nice brown ale that needs to make its way up to north Texas. Thanks to Bentley for the sample!"
"Good mouthfeel. The initial sample seemed to be a bit watery, but this sample is holding up better. Good, smooth finish. Very drinkable. Not quite as good overall as the other Real Ale offerings, but certainly not a disappointment in any way. Good stuff."
"Its hazy mahogany body is topped by a light tan head of foam that holds quite well and leaves some jagged and craggy rings of lace at the outset. The nose is yeasty and fruity above a mildly caramelish and nutty malt. The body is medium/light and its very fine, natural carbonation is lightly zesty in the mouth. Chocolate and caramel mingle well together in the flavor along with a slight fruitiness, a light yeast bite, and some leafy hops. It's well balanced by a low-key bitterness and it finishes short and dry with just some residual nutty malt. This is probably quite excellent in cask conditioned form, but it seems to fall a bit short in the bottle."
"Re-Revisited: I'm liking the beer more and more each time I try it. The mouthfeel has a fairly creamy profile, and the taste has some nuttiness that I didn't get before. I'm not sure if they are playing with the recipe or I'm just starting to pick up on subtle notes."
"Thanks, kbub!"
"This one pours a very dark brown. There is a thick and long lived head with a moderate malt nose. The flavor is a well balanced blend of malt and hops. The mouthfell is fair and smooth but not exceptional in any way. The after taste is fairly decent and not too bitter. Overall a better brew from this brew house."
"Id like a touch more body from this beer, as several consecutive sips resulted in my mouth frowning over the slight, but building thinness. Still, I enjoyed the complexity, the modest subtlety and the balance in this beer. Of all the standard Real Ale offerings, this one might be the most solid."
"Pretty good dark beer. Recommend this one as a good sample from this brewery."
"Dark brown with an OK head that fades quickly. Arome is nice and dark with a hint of citric hops. A bit like cocoa puff and grapefruit juice. The hops fall out in the flavor but it picks up a nice earthy malt. A bit chalky in the flavor."
