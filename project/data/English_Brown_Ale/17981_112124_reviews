"Another great beer from Cigar City Brewing.  I hope this company expands their distribution to New England. Excellent brews!"
""
"Overall when I tried this with some coworkers everyone liked it. Easy to turn people into craft beer drinkers with this one. Too bad its only available in Florida!"
""

"An awesome, more traditional brown ale, but still with some perfectly tweaked.. twists. Awesome stuff as usual from Cigar City."
""
""
"Final Thoughts: The drier aspects of this beer, really lend it towards fish or moist rich chocolate deserts. I think the picture on this beer really speaks volumes to what it is. I would want to drink it at the same that I would want to have a cigar, typically in the twilight hours after dinner, or during a hot day by the pool. I've been so far pleased with everything Cigar City has offered."
""
"Appearance: Deep brilliant chestnut under a 2” off white foam cap that descends to a thick film. Smell: Light roast malt, chocolate aroma, dark fruit. Taste: Plum with traces of chocolate for support and hints of sour. Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium body and carbonation."

"smooth taste , coffee notes ,easy to drink , a really nice ale"

"one of my new favorites, super coffee overload, no bitterness outside of the minor minor minor bit from the coffee. easy drinking, light feal and light carbonation, uncomplicated, a great overall ale"
""
"A little metallic. Canned, served at Conchy Joe's in Jensen Beach, FL."

"Overall: great brown ale"

"Thick head that dissipated quickly. Chocolate and coffee on the nose. Malty coffee taste builds into sweet chocolate and ends with a dry malty flavor much like newcastle. Mouthfeel seemed thin for the style and flavor, which was disappointing. Overall, an above average brown ale that would do good for sipping with dessert/ice cream. Good, not great."
""
""
"Can.  Pours dark brown, touch of mahogany; tan head doesn't last long at all.  Smell is chocolate and toffee. Taste is chocolate, some sweetness but not too much, no coffee but there is something darker and roasted.  Smooth and very good texture.  Not sure what brown ale is supposed to taste like ideally, but this is an enjoyable beer."

"12oz can poured into Styrofoam hotel coffee cup. Clear deep brown with thin tan head. Aroma is toasted malts, nuts, dark fruits, coffee, brown bread, and toffee. Taste is light malt sweetness including caramel, toasted bread, nuts, and a new chocolate note. Some roasted malt, espresso, and tobacco bitterness. Medium body, great mouth-filling creamy texture, moderate carbonation, and a drying roasty finish."
"This is a rich, complex, malty heavy hitter. Great by the fireside"

"Fantastic beer -- world-class brown ale."
""
"O- Keep sending Cigar City Brewing to Upstate New York!  For the first time I found their stuff in my area tonight, and I sincerely hope more is on the way.  I had heard great things about these brews, and they do not disappoint.  If you are a fan of brown ales, this needs to be on your list. (4.16)"

"Tastes to me like a cross between a porter and a brown ale.  Not bad, but nothing exceptional."
""
""
"Has a rather light feel to it with a good carbonation to it."
"o: Rather more like a coffee porter than an English brown.  Flavor is dominated by increasingly bitter coffee rather than caramel malt.  Ok as such but not a favorite for the style."
"Overall: Don't get me wrong. I cut my teeth on this style of beer, but after having so many beers in varying styles over the years this style has become kind of boring and commonplace. However, this one is better than most. I do appreciate this extra in the trade but I would not seek it out again. Cigar City does makes some above average beers but this one is in my opinion solidly average."
""
"Not my top brown ale but I will certainly purchase it again."
""
""
""
""
"Price Point - $10.99/6 pk 12 oz cans"
""
"Altogether not a bad interpretation for the style, and with a nice heft.  Worth a try, but might not be worth seeking out."
""
"Nutty, toffee, espresso, complex yet drinkable. Reminds me of Dukes Cold Nose, but with more complexity. Overall a satisfying brew from Cigar City, would drink again."
""
"12 oz. can purchased in mid-6/14 in the greater Miami area, FL; dated """Sep 12 2013," poured into my Rustico Novemberfest mug, drank over 30 minutes"

"Solid coffee tasting beer from a kick-ass brewery."

"On sight, Cigar City Brewing Maduro pours a bright mahogany that’s relatively clear with a tannish head.  The head dissipates relatively quickly, but the brew gives off a deep scent of caramel, toffee, nuts, and brown sugar with a hint of spice.  The scent is deep, complex, and adds notes of woodsy elements, molasses, espresso, and cigar wrapper.  Being able to draw something off the top isn’t a stretch, but it is wonderful in it’s complexity.  On the palate, it starts out a little light,  and maintains a slightly thin body.  The flavors are balanced between nutty flavors and the more sugary malt notes, like brown sugar, caramel, and molasses.  There’s an underlying bitterness that’s vaguely coffee inspired.  On the end it finishes quickly with just touches of caramel and cigar wrapper."

"Really kinda average. Aroma was outstanding, lots of big roasts, then the flavor was rather bitter and ashy almost."

"O – A milder brown ale punctuated with roasty coffee, it kind of ends up as an in-betweener.  I like it, but not that excited by it.  Still, a good brown ale."

"One finger off white head that slowly dissipated. Aroma of coffee and chocolate. Tastes as it smells but with some smoky flavor and maybe some oak. Much maltier than I would expect from your average brown. Medium/light body with smooth mouth feel. Taste of dark chocolate lingers on the palate. Probably one of the best browns I have tried."

"Very good brown ale. Better CCB beers though."

"Overall I am impressed  with this beer in bottles not sure if the can is a different recipe but it's still very tasty stuff a world class Brown ale for sure."

"Poured from a can medium brown with a small head that dissipates quickly with little lacing. I'd like to try a draft nitro version of this one. The aroma gives a hint of mocha and is very pleasing. The taste is , to me, what an English brown ale should be. It combines  nuttiness with traces of coffee and chocolate with a low hop presence. Very drinkable"

"Pours a dark brown with minimal head. The nose features moderate roasted malts, light coffee notes, and some creamy oatmeal character. The taste mild up front with increasingly strong roasted barley as it passes the palate. Chocolate and oatmeal present with mild hop bitterness towards the end. Moderate to high carbonation with lightish body. Overall, good flavors, just a bit on the mild side in terms of flavor."

""
"Overall, a really nice beer. Would be a great beer to have when your enjoying a nice smoked brisket or something similar or when the weather is a little cooler."

"O: nice malt heavy brown, good flavors of nuts"
""
"o:much sweeter than i expected...and juicy? its an interesting brown ale. not as boring as some, but i usually like the caramel malts to be featured a little more. nice twist on the nuttiness in here as well though. worth a try, but nothing you should go out of your way for"
""
"Mouthfeel is smooth (velvety came to mind). Overall, this is a pretty darn good brown."

"A good friend of mine had this beer to split with my beer guru and me. They both liked it so my expectations were high. Typically I am kinda luke warm on Browns but really liked this one. I would have to put it right there with Samuel Smith's as my favorite brown. I will certainly look to buy this one again in the future."

"355ml can. Nonic glass. Enjoyed @ Freiburg (Barcelona). Deep brown color. Tan head shows fairly good retention. Intense caramel & toasted malt, toffee aromas, notes of herbal infusion & fresh black tobacco. Caramelish upfront rounded by hints of licorice & coffee infusion. Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation. Dried & velvety mouthfeel. Candy & sweet roasted flavors touched by smoked malt hues resolve in a sweet malty finish. Strong flavors of bitter chocolate infusion on the aftertaste. Complex & flavorful!!"
