"Solid brown ale. Drink it."

"Had a 1/6 keg of this and is very crisp and drinkable!"
""
"Just a good solid Brown Ale!"
""

"Overall- A really good beer from Legend.  I will definitely drink this again."

"Had my first one of these 15 years ago, and it's still one of my ""go to"" beers.  Love it in the bottle and adore it on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's better on-tap than out of the bottle, but it still isn't the best ale I've had by a long shot. Still, I'd order it again if I absolutely had to drink something I knew was decent, and if I wasn't in the mood for untested beers."

"O: This beer is rather malty, but its lighter mouthfeel doesn't make it seem heavy or filling and is therefore relatively easy to drink. It is a good representation of the style."

"Nothing outstanding but I am always happy to see it on a menu."

"Surprising balanced and very drinkable. Very pleasant color and very nice thick head (from tap). Caramel, nutty, and sweet notes, hops is present, but not overwhelming like so many microbrews; low on the IBU scale. The beer was good enough for me to take the time to review it, which is saying something, as I have never reviewed a beer before (at least not publicly!)... Now back to drinking... I will definitely be having another one. :)"

"Overall, one of the best brown ale's I have had."
""
""
"O: Quite nice brown ale. Very balanced; great rich flavors and the crisp finish really plays off the richness well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brown with reddish hues; a thick 2-inch, tan head with lots of staying power. The smell is surprisingly hoppy and brisk. The taste is an interesting blend of the hops and malts; citrus-grapefruit, nutty, a little bitter after taste more in line with a mild IPA but still a very good on the palate. Dry and high carbonation mouthfeel. Overall: Although the taste, aroma, and mouthfeel don't track with most brown ales, this brew is very good and enjoyable."
""
""
"A decent beer overall, but far from the best brown ale I have ever tried."
""
""
"Overall impression: A solid American Brown Ale. It seemed to bitter to be an English Brown even though that's where it's slotted here. I'd try it again but in general, browns don't get me too excited."
""
""
"Clear, deep brown with a reddish hue topped by a thin beige cap. Good head retention, some lacing. Not much other than grapefruit citrus in the aroma, perhaps a bit of malt and brown sugar. Moderate bitterness, citrus dominates the flavour, fainter notes of dark malts, nuts, and brown sugar. Medium/light bodied with moderate carbonation, a bit dry. Decent overall, particularly if you like a lot of citrus in your brown ales."
""
""
"Pretty decent brew. Nothing amazing, but it's satisfying and refreshing. I would try it again."

"O: An easy drinker and a good version of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I was very impressed with this brown ale. Nicely balanced, very tasty and very drinkable. I’ll certainly pick up a few more of these."
""
""
""
"O-decent if not great brown ale, easy drinking"
""
""
"edit: As I have a bomber and a tiny glass, it has taken several refills, and each refill has caused it to try to overflow with head, while the beer part stays in the bottom inch or so of the glass. This coupled with some other things that came out as I drink make me wonder if there's something up with this bottle (I admittedly don't know much about what can affect a beer/what effect it can have). Is this a possibility?"

"Overall sort of missing the nutty character and malt depth, but it's not a bad brew though and certainly not a horrible brown that's for sure."
"""Our most popular beer, Legend's is a full bodied version of a British Brown Ale. Expect a rich, malt-forward brew with a beautiful mahogany tone. Generous amounts of specialty malts bring flavors of sweet caramel, toasted nuts, coffee, and molasses, all perfectly balanced by a steady but cautious hop dryness. Fruity undertones provided by our house yeast strain bring the final flavor element to round out this world class ale. 5.8% Alc. By Vol."""

"An aggro pour resulted in a brief finger of light-tan head with limited retention. Color was a mahogany brown with NE-quality clarity. Nose gave off notes of milk chocolate, nuts, caramel and toffee. Whee! Mouthfeel was unexpectedly effervescent with a very nutty flavor on the tongue. This was turning out much better than I had expected. Finish was semi-dry with the nuttiness being offset by a butterscotch-caramel-toffee flavor. For not being my cuppa tea, this was quite a nice beer. It just reinforces my need to diversify whenever possible."
""
""
""
"Clear, medium brown pour with a small white head that fizzled out pretty quickly, leaving a few spots of lacing on the glass. Very little in the nose, toasted cereal grains, and not much else. Buttery off-flavors, caramel malt sweetness, grainy, phenolic fruitiness, and a tiny hop bitterness coming through. Thin body, not very drinkable. I'm not a big fan of brown ales to begin with, but this one was just flat-out poorly made."

"wow just wow my mother in law pick this up in virgina dam she can pick good beers out. just a great tasting beer a very sexy brown ale in a glass, brown , very little head smells boozy but its not and the taste is wonderful find this beer and bring it home just wonderful"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts, a bit nutty. Taste is well balanced hops and malts, a bit of nuts, just a touch of caramel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."

"O: I admit, this one caught me off guard a bit. Aromatically, it's not much cop, but the flavor and texture helps compensate. Very good in general."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - enjoyable ale that does not overwhelm, taste is sweet yet subtle at the end"
""
"O- I like this one. The sour tangy flavor is hard to place but it plays well with the nuttiness and it's definitely an easy drinker."
"Drinkability is ok, a little to much like a milky way candy bar for my taste, I tired of the sweetness quickly. The fairly high ABV is well hidden though."
""
"Overall: A fairly average brown ale. A bit of a sentimental favorite because it's semi-local and definitely something I wouldn't mind having again."
""
""
""
""
"Pours mostly clear ruby with a beige thin head that has some retention and little lacing. Medium to light in body, smooth, finishes with lasting pine bitterness. Taste and smell rounded out by sweet bready, cookie dough with a little roast to it. Nice brown ale, but nothing too memorable. Paired well with the Q at Buz & Ned's."

"3.5 D: Decent beer with a great mouthfeel, but could use more intensity in the taste."

"Overall – Very easy drinking with great flavors and aromas."

"Pours a chesnut brown with a thinner white head that is gone pretty quickly.Nice roasted nut and brown sugar notes in the nose,one of the more appetizing aromas for a brown ale that I have come across.Praline flavors are very nice but the mouthfeel is a little prickly,in saying that the flavors are still pretty rich and satisying.The abv% is high for the style but it's very well hidden,a solid offering from Legend."
""
""
"Overall: Not a very exciting style, but this beer makes the most of it"

"Overall: Very good and easy to drink. Nothing I didn't enjoy."
"O - This is definitely Legend's most popular beer, and with good reason. It's very well rounded with a pleasant flavor, aroma, and smooth mouthfeel. Having just consumed one bottle, I am left wanting to have another for sure. Overall, this is a very nice offering from Legend Brewing and certainly one of the top examples of the style."

"Big thanks goes out to the BA who sent this one my way as an extra in a past trade (can’t remember who, but will look it up soon)! Served from bottle into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Poured a deep red-orange with a five to six finger cream colored head that subsided to three finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, subtly roasted malt, nutty, earth, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, tart, caramel, nutty, and wood. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. I was concerned that this one was going to be infected based on the amount of head that formed upon being poured gently into my glass. Upon smelling the brew it didn’t seem like there was any infection evident. But on the flavor there was the slight tart note that one would not expect. It was not sharp or strong, but it was definitely present. Still a fairly easy drinking brown ale that I wouldn’t mind having again sometime."
""
"The body is a perfect medium for me. It's light enough to give it great drinkability, yet heavy enough to let you know you're not drinking a lite beer. Carbonation is on the lighter side but headed towards moderate. I really think this beer stands out as a favorite Brown Ale."
""
"Overall, decent, but not impressive enough to ask for another. Got as an extra and am glad I got to try it."
"Enjoy!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A very good beer for its style and an excellent session brew. I was pleasantly surprised."
""
"O: Light flavor and body makes this a rather drinkable ale, but the aroma is slightly off and in the end this one is just not very interesting."
"Overall--Very drinkable, creamy and lightly sweet. Not especially flavorful, but hard not to get along with."
""
""
"O: Not bad but at the same time fairly meh."
""
""
"Overall a mild tasting and well balanced Brown Ale that possessed an excellent drinkability."

"O - I have to say I've always had a soft spot for Legend Brewing Co. As a Richmond local and a lover of brown ales, this beer has been a favorite of mine for a long time. Make sure to try the Porter if you have the chance! 4.0"
"Overall a really good brown ale that I'm glad to have gotten as an extra in a trade and that I'd definitely like to enjoy again!"
"all in all, I'm definitely impressed. I'm not a big brown fan, but this one has enough malt carachter and a touch of hops that it really works while keeping things interesting. I'd drink this by the growler if it were local!"
"As far as brown ales go, this is a little above average. I would drink this again, but I wouldn't seek it out. I don't find it legendary."
"O: Good beer; very drinkable. Still, not especially compelling. Would drink again, in the right circumstance. Recommended."
"Pours the color of root beer. Good head that settles slowly. Plenty of malt in the nose. Good sweetness too, perhaps caramel. Taste up front is strong, perhaps a little coffee and chocolate. The ending is sweeter but finishes just right. There is a small taste of hops for balance. Mouthfeel is a little light, but fits with the style. This is quite a surprise from an in-state brewery. Never tried any of their stuff before but this is one of the better brown ales I’ve tried."
"O: I enjoyed this beer. I tried it with a margarita pizza and the beer complemented the basil and olive oil tastes. I would have this beer again when in VA."
"Pours a lightly hazed brown with moderate cap of off white foam. Scent is wonderfully nutty with light touches of caramel and roast, mild earthy hoppyness with a kick of herbal scent. Taste follows scent, slightly less aggressive then the nose would lead to believe. Medium bodied, lightly creamy but a faint bit of wateriness and the carbonation escapes. A nice brown ale with a good chunk of different scents and tastes."
"Still, it's a better than average example of the style."
"Overall this beer is an amazing E Brown. I could live on this beer. really."
"O - For being a local beer, this one stands up with most any Brown that I've had."
"DRINKABILITY: This was a tasty, well-balanced, brown ale but certainly was not best of breed. It was easy to drink, could be consumed all night long, and was a reasonable value, even at the restaurant's sizable markup. I'd order it again and wouldn't hesitate to serve it to friends."
"O: I appreciate the fact that the brewer(s) craft this one more towards the entree (bread dough) side as apposed to the candy, sugary one. This was a different kind of brown ale for sure. Good stuff!"
"HV"
"Brown in Color, nutty rich aroma with a good half inch of head. Good carbonation and nice lacing on the glass all the way down. The nutty aroma carries over to the flavor. Robust flavor you'd expect from a brown ale, but finishes mild. Just shy of bitter but not sweet, very well balanced. I had it on the recommendation a bartender, on tap, a while back and had to look for at my local Total Wine. Great beer! I took a six pack to a friend's and they where a hit even with the MGD die hards."
"Dark brown leaning toward amber. 1/2 finger head. Smells caramely chocolate with some sweet tobacco and dried fruit. Tastes sweet with a semi-sweet finish. Nice and malty with just enough hop to bitter. Adequate carbination and a creamy mouth feel. Pretty solid offering and quite drinkable. I'd recommend it without any reservations."
"Overall, this one surprised me a bit. Researched Legend Brewing company before arriving (being from CA where it is not distributed to my knowledge) and am glad I had the opportunity to try this one. Also a plus that I get to take one of these back to share with friends at the next tasting."
"Give this beer a chance and it'll be something you regularly stock from here on out."
"This beer poured a mahogany brown and crystal clear with a short head that dissipates rather quickly. The smell was nutty and malty, and although the aroma was there, it was light and humble. The taste was spot on average for a brown ale. Nutty and malty. Nothing to be too impressed with, but definitely better than a Newky Brown. Light on the body, and easy to sip, this one you can definitely drink a bottle or two and not have to worry about not making the evening news at 10."
"OVERALL: My only issue with Legend's Brown Ale is the carbonation (or lack there of). It made for a weak head and gave it an oily feel. In terms of flavor, however, this is one of the better brown ales I have had. So, if you are not as sensitive to texture as I am, pick one of these up next time you find yourself in Richmond, VA."
"Malterrific!"
"D - Very Drinkable. Matchs with a lot of dishes."
"A good brown ale overall. Not amazing, but good enough."
"D- Overall drinkable... while it fails to break the mediocre barrier in all other categories, it's refreshing enough to drink in quantity on a hot day."
"Nothing exceptionally or noteworthy about this beer, it's just a good beer."
"D - If you have a hankering for a brown ale that brings some sugar to the party, this is a highly drinkable beer. The aroma and taste make it a pleasant experience."
"I had this beer in a 22oz draft at the Quaker Steak in Newport News VA. It was a good beer, nothing super special to remark about, but in a town where bud, bud light and yeungling are the readily available beers on draft. Would drink it again if I were looking for a good brew that wouldn't over power my wings, yet maintained a good body and mouth feel."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's a very nice and enjoyable brown ale. it really had some nice caramel, toffee and nutty flavors to it."
"thumbs up."
"Overall a tasty and well done brown ale."
"D: quite easy, makes me wonder why i had not tried it sooner."
"Drinkability is just ridiculous when you consider the accessible 6.5%, the bigness of the flavor, and the fact that none of its characteristics are cloying or out of whack. A sensible and, most importantly, delicious beer."
"Deep copper color-not quite brown still retains a coppery hue. Big foamy head that fades fast. Low aroma-somewhat of a mild chocolate/metallic mix. Some soft malt notes. Nice malty flavor upfront. Just enough hop bite to cover the malt. Mild residual sweetness. Nice lite mouthfeel-suprising for the somewhat higher abv. Enjoyable brown ale. Another decent brew from Legend."
"On-tap at Capital Ale House in Richmond. I didn't realize this brew's strength until seeing it hear. If it were lower in booze, it'd make a heck of a session beer. It's got a roasty edge, like a brown porter, and then underlying cocoa and toffee flavors. It's dry, drinkable, and tasty. Just watch yourself, a few too many will put you in a ditch."
"Review from notes taken on: 12/5/09."
"It has a nice dark reddish brown color, with a decent head that sticks around. Not a lot of aroma, a little bit of malt. Very thick, creamy. Roasted coffee fills the mouth with notes of chocolate in the finish. Mouthfeel is fairly heavy. Very drinkable, I am quite impressed with this one."
"Drinkability: A great brown ale. This beer is complex and satisfying. It's certainly worth a try if you can find it."
"Wow. Legend makes easily the best beer around, and this is the ""go to"" beer of their collection. Heavy, but very drinkable, great smell and taste. It's very Sam Adams ""esque"" in the quality, but just has better drinkability than most brown ales out there. The color is a darkish brown and has nice tan lacing. Just a fantastic beer."
"On tap at the 2nd Street Bistro in Williamsburg - an hour from the brewery, so maybe that helps. At any rate, the bartender described it as ""kind of like Newcastle, but with a little more bite less syrupy", and that's a pretty good description. Foam leaves lots of lace as it recedes, and the ale is a very dark golden amber with enough translucency to differentiate it from a heavier style. Has a good deal of carbonation, and some hop bitterness, leading to the aforementioned bite. It also has some of the caramelized sweetness you'd expect, though, and lots of malt, although not as heavy as some browns I've tasted. I just had a pint, but easily could have had more. All in all a very solid beer."
"exceedingly drinkable and enjoyable."
"D: good accompaniment to a meal. I'd have another."
"drinkability - Always a good brew. Enjoyed this one. Easy drinking."
"D: Very nice English brown ale with a superb balance of toasted and caramel malts combined with a edgy but smooth hoppiness. Very good brew from Legend's.... Right up there with Chocolate Porter."
"A one-finger frothy on top of a see-thru brown body. Subdued roasted malt smell mixed with some toasted and sweet malt smells as well. Nice smoothness with a subdued dry backbite. Has caramel sweetness and maybe some sugar cane with a little tartness from the hops. A low-key quality brown."
"pours a clear earthy brown body and a slightly brownish head. the smell is nice and malty, bready with some caramel and molases, a little toasty-ness. nice and smoth, balanced overall flavor. the front is mildly sweet, hint of alcohol. not as much maltyness as i would have expected. just a hint of a hop kick at the end, but still within balance of the rest of the flavors. the most interesting flavor is the hint of burnt toast in the after tase. Mouth feel is chewy, frothy, slick. and drinkability is pretty good, this could be a session beer."
"I always love this beer."
"D- Overall a and tasty great beer. This one of my hometown favorites."
"Preety freakin' good. Had it at the Taphouse in Hampton, VA and it was very nice. At first sight, it is a brown ale, nice color. The scent left a little to be desired. Not what I expected. Kind of like old beer, but when I tasted it, yummy, very nice. The taste of malt filled my mouth, followed by an ever so slight hops. Very nice finish. And each time a drank it, I think I enjoyed it more. Nice."
"Overall- The wood/ leather taste and feel limit this to the 1 bomber."
"This is a solid Brown Ale that isn't too watery, and isn't exactly like a Porter, which is something that's hard to find sometimes. Good solid flavors, with just a touch of complexity. Recommended."
"D: Overall, this is a pretty good beer, though not my favorite among Legend's output. The taste was good enough, but bordered on mediocre."
"I enjoyed this beer alot. I have enjoyed all their beers thus far. Smells of cherries and faint chocolate. Some floral hops in there as well. Taste is slightly sweet with a subtle bitterness balancing it nicely. There is a very faint bitterness on the tongue. Light to medium body. This is a very good brown ale. I will definitely buy again."
"d: this seems to me to be a virginia gentleman's beer; smooth and classic-i bet tj would have loved this one"
"D: Although not very interesting, it would be easy to make this a session brew. Not offensive and certainly an improvement over most macros."
"Overall, I really like this beer. Some brown ales get too sweet, but this has a nice balance between the sweet and roasted malts."
"Pretty good for a brown ale. Worth a try."
"standard pint at Taphouse on Queensway, Hampton, VA"
"Overall an interesting interpretation of an English Brown Ale that for me, lets down only because of this tartness that I find out of place. Other than that, it sure is easy enough to drink. I'd say, try it if you see it."
"A fairly drinkable brown ale."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy off-white head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, slightly sour, bitter, with some caramel notes. The taste is malty, slightly sour, nice touch of bitterness, and caramel. Medium body, the finish is bitter/slightly dry. Drinkable, this is my first from Legend and not too bad, thanks Joe/John."
"This is a nice, malty, drinkable brown ale. Interesting."
"Easy drinker, sits well. Perfect with some hot dogs watching the afternoon ballgame."
"Legend Brown Ale is one of my absolute favorite brown ales. Plenty of malty character with a touch of hoppiness - beautifully balanced. The warm, inviting color coupled with a light tan head makes a very pleasing presentation. The aroma is sublimely malty with a slight chocolatey note and a hint of hop aroma. The hop presence in the flavor effectively supports the maltiness for a very well-balanced brown ale."
"Can't remember the smell exactly, but was about average. This was very smooth to drink and pretty sweet, with a good brown ale flavor. The texture was a little thin, perhaps from lack of enough carbonation. Overall it was one of the better brown ales I've had, but still nothing too spectacular. (Drunk straight from the bottle, so I don't have notes on the appearance.)"
"Good take on an English Brown. Nicely done. Recommend a try."
"D: A very accomplished English brown ale with a superb balance of toasted and caramel malts combined with a edgy but smooth hops spiciness. This is one of Legend's best."
"T/M/D: A big malt front here... nice, round body, maybe even a touch heavy for its class - I personally like the attribute, so don't see it as being a negative thing. Not noticing a caramel flavour like I found in the aroma. Rather, an earthy, somewhat buttery flavour of malts. They seem to diminish a touch in the finish, but don't know if making it 'bigger' would change that or ruin it all. All around, it's a nice and straight forward brown, and something that could show further potential with tweaking over time."
"Pours a reddish-brown color with off-white short lived head. The aroma is caramel with a bit of brown sugar. Caramel malt flavor, not too sweet. Some citrus hops come through at the end giving the beer a bit of a zing. A decent but not outstanding english brown ale."
"D-as above, this beer is pretty much the status quo around town for the bars and restaurants. it's not a bad brown ale at all, in fact quite good. have used this a couple of times session style."
"Served a crisp brown with a decent sized head that was somewhat quick to diminish. The aroma was of roasted malt, slight burnt caramel and a hint of hops. The taste had a great roastiness to it along with some subtle caramel and a hint of chocolate. The hops were quietly doing their job in the background. The beer was medium to light bodied with the alcohol well hidden. This is a very enjoyable brown ale and certainly worth trying if you're in the area."
"oh brown man. Your crystal maltiness, your faint sweet roastiness. Your hazelnut appearance and sometimes light diacetyl aroma and finish. Your low hop profile and lush mouthfeel. How I miss you at times, but when you are fresh in my mouth on a good November evening, I am happy. I recomend you to others. Those that like classic brown ales, but yearn for a colonial twist in the plot."
"Nice micro brew brown ale. Highly recommend if passing through Richmond. It has a flavorful malt bill along with some decent hop and yeast flavors. My pour had little head, but some lacing on the glass. Nothing sticks out with this beer--it is just a good beer with good flavor overall. Complex malt nutiness is present that makes it somewhat unique. Very drinkable beer."
"Its overall a pleasant beer thats always fresh as it has a short expiration date and cant be left unrefered. Its always a good solid standby in the Richmond area."
"This beer is a nice clear brown with a fair head that leaves little lacing. The smell is of brown sugar and cappachino. The taste is caramel and molasses. The mouthfeel is smooth and this is a very drinkable beer. If I visited this brewpub, this would be a beer I would order each visit for sure."
"Cheers!"
"One of the best tasting brown ales Virginia has to offer. My only complaints are that there is little to no head or lace, and the body could be a bit fuller. But, as it is, this beer is fantastic. Highly recommended."
"Aroma is very fruity with apple dominating and notes of a more sugary sweetness. Red/brown body holds a world champion fader of a head that leaves tiny white slick. Lots of caramel malt, fruity apple and pear along with peantu skins and meatier nut notes. The flavor is spot on for the most part, but the alcohol is a touch more noticeable than expected for the style. Still a decent Brown."
"22 oz. bomber with no freshness date. It pours a reddish chestnut color with a dense 2 finger off-white head that looks very nice, reducing to a half inch and leaving some lacing on the glass. There is a lot of diacetyl on the nose, mainly butter and caramel, along with some perfumy hops and maybe some nuts. It has a medium body that is tingly and it tastes like leafy hops, diacetyl, some malt in the background, and a distict bitterness that is not quite controlled by the malts, though it tastes low in IBUs. Overall a pretty drinkable brown, but the body wasn't thick enough and it wasn't too complex. However it did pair well with some Pepperidge Farm Milano cookies."
"Drinkability: Very well done, and very fresh tasting. ABV seems less than listed here. I had never heard of this brewery before, but they've gained my attention with this fine offering."
"This beer was a dissapointment for me. Ordered it with a sandwich. In the low lighting it appeared a true brown color with no head or lacing on the pint glass. Smell was barely perceptible with some maltiness showing up. Taste starts out like a typical brown ale then the aftertaste ruins it for me. In an effort to be bitter it merely comes across annoying like a kid trying to get a attention by acting up rather than just saying ""excuse me."" I found the aftertaste distracting and it discounted any hope I had for this beer. Mouthfeel was about right, not quite full, but coating the palate up front. I left about a third of this in the glass."
"Overall: This is an excellent beer."
"Pours a nutty brown colour with just a tinge of amber. Decent fluffy white head. The aroma is nutty with a bit of sweetness with a decent back end of bitterness. Taste is initially subtle caramel sweetness. A middle note of toasted hazelnuts comes in followed by a kind of bitterness found in burnt sugar ALA creme brulee. The flavour is nice and deep and not water or too sweet like some brown ales I have had recently. Mouthfeel is good. One thing about legend is that they seem to always taste fresh. Drinkability is good as well. While not a session brew in my eye, I wouldnt mind a couple of pints of this in an evening. The best Legend I have had so far."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" beige head over the burnished copper brew. Head is resilient, and laces well. Aroma is is malty, with a sweetish component, vanilla, perhaps. Taste is sweet caramel malts, with that vanilla flavor so strong as to seem artificial adding a bit of depth. Mouthfeel good and drinkability high. And interesting take on the style, I like it, and would love to find it on cask..."
"It arrived in a 20oz. English Imperial Pint glass with an amazingly thick and creamy white head that really reminded me of a nitr-tap brew. Distinct and impressive rings of lace on the glass as this one was drained. Color was indeed dark golden. Aromas were very different from what I'd expected. I was thinking I'd be able to pick up something resembling a hoppy note but all I got was a very pronounced ""applesauce"" aroma. I'd be curious to see what hops they used in dry-hopping this. Flavor, too, was not very influenced by the hops, IMHO. Pretty mild, and toned down by the conditioning in the cask. Quite malty-caramel sweet up front, tempered nicely by the hops. Finishes with a sweet, tangy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice...creamy smoothness coates the palate. I really like cask-conditioned beers and this one was easy to drink. One that I would certainly order again."
"I've since had this brew on tap a number of times at the River's Inn Restaraunt in Gloucester, VA, and have grown to enjoy this brown ale quite a bit. I'll also have to add that I enjoy it more on tap than from a bottle. The mouthfeel is a bit fuller and smoother on tap. The malt charateristics are more dominate. The malt is a little on the sweet side, but doesn't take away from the brew. The hops while still present, tend to have a less citric quality then I had noticed in the bottle. With no other craft brews to choose from at the River's Inn, I'll continue to be a happy customer as long as they keep this one available. Good session brew."
"This is a nice, well balanced and highly quaffable brew. Living in the Richmond vicinity, you find it on tap in a lot of local restaurants and pubs. Hints of nuts and a little malt on the palate, with a clean finish. Goes great with a variety of foods. Legend doesn't pasturize it's beers, so it always has a pleasantly fresh taste."

"When in the Central Virginia area, make sure you treat your tastebuds to this smooth, slightly sweet concotion.  The deep brown color says it will be heavy.  It is not.  The aroma says nutty, and it is, but its in the back fringe of the flavor profile.  Stops just short of making your mouth giddy.  Can be dangerously seductive which leads to mass consumption.  Then when you stand up the alcohol kicks in and the world spins.  Tap version far superior to bottle."
