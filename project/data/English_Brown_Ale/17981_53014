4.4,6.3,4,4,5,4,4,"Poured on-tap at the Cigar City Brewing tasting room in Tampa. Served in a pint glass, the beer has the same body and color of Maduro Brown. A deep, dark brown color with ruby highlights and a light, thin, foamy head. Smells like an oatmeal creme pie, which made this fat kid very happy! My poor pregnant wife hates me right now. Slight cinnamon aroma, too, and the smell is amazing! The taste is great! The flavor has a baked sugary sweetness, cinnamon spicing, and creamy undertones. Wow! All of this while remaining light bodied. Brown-sugar sweet aftertaste, with a quick, clean finish. Delicious! Would make a wicked milkshake!","GarthDanielson","Jun 06, 2011"

Certainly worth a try, Cigar City continues to impress me.","stakem","Jun 06, 2011"
4.94,19.3,4,5,5,5,5,"This beer looks like any other Maduro, but it's not. The aroma is that of cinnamon, oats, and large grains of sugar - and boy oh boy is the best yet to come. I know this kind of sentiment is tossed around a lot on BA - but I have never drank anything that is closer to a liquified dessert than this. It absolutely captures the taste and the mouthfeel of an oatmeal raisin cookie without any of the crumbs. Big molasses sweetness, cinnamon, raisin, grain - this, to me, is the perfect example of what a brown ale can aspire to be. Bravo, Cigar City. This is the Maduro to try.","mfunk9786","May 21, 2011"

4.05,-2.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a very deep burgundy brown with a bit of head from the start but the head dies off almost instantly. When held up to the light it is barely visible to see through, but it is not like its motor oil Stout relative. Smells at first like it has a dark cherry and a slight vanilla bean flavor infused into it, and then a cinnamon warmness follows. Taking deeper inhales it almost smells like an apple pie with tons of cinnamon infused into it. Admittedly Brown Ales never muster much a smile from my face because they all seem rather bland to me, but this one is surprisingly tasty. Taste is a very nutty brown ale with just a touch of some dark stone fruits. The cinnamon and raisin contributions are very light to the taste and play really nicely into the overall flavor of the beer. With more and more sips you realize there is a nice tingling in your throat I think partly to the subtle carbonation but also from the cinnamon. Cigar City really set the bar with this Brown Ale, to make it interesting to the palate(in a rather boring field) but to also balance the spice profile and not make it a bomb of cinnamon. The mouthfeel is light due to the not over robust carbonation and as mentioned before the nice light play from the spice added to the beer. Overall I like this beer for the style and wish more Brown Ales tasted as good as this one, I wouldn't pass on them as much then!","deathcharms","May 15, 2011"

This beer does smell like cookies, mostly hot raisins, cinnamon and vanilla. There is a nice roastiness to the flavour along with what I smelled in the nose. The raisins come through as well as the other spices, mainly cinammon, nutmeg and vanilla. Mouth was a touch over carbonated in my opinion, medium. Overall an interesting beer and I liked the concept. The cookie recipe wasn't played up and was a nice mix of spices and smells.","OakedCanuck","Apr 21, 2011"
4.25,2.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Aroma is both fruiter and nuttier than the original Maduro Brown is. A dash of spice and some chocolate rounds out a solid brown ale nose. Flavor picks up some cinnamon that accentuates a dry finish. A nutty and slightly chocolatey malt base backs up a sweet mid palate with a grape like flavor coming from the raisins. Full bodied mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. The exotic ingredients seem to be added with a very gentle hand, as this doesn't taste over the top at all. The flavors of cookies are all there, but it doesn't come together to actually taste like the cookie. Still a nice treat with some freshly baked oatmeal raisin cookies.","jeffthecheff","Apr 21, 2011"
3.7,-10.6,4.5,4.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Pours a dark raisin color with a light tan head. The head bubbled off quickly, but the rush of carbonation bubbles from the bottom kept a small part afloat for a good while. The beer also left a great ring of lacing around the glass. The beer smelled almost identical to an oatmeal raisin cookie. Not sure if the name clouded my judgment, but the smell was right on point to a fresh out of the oven oatmeal raisin cookie. Also faint smells of vanilla and ginger. The taste was very sweet, reminded me of an oatmeal cookie with a vanilla icing with cinnamon sprinkled on top. The biggest let down of the beer was the thin body. That held this back from being a top tier beer in my opinion. Overall another great offering from Cigar City. Glad I had a chance to try and look forward to trying more Cigar City beers in the future.","brian44556","Apr 19, 2011"

3.6,-13,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. Pours a brownish-mahogany with a half inch creamy head that dissipates into a sudsy skim with clumps and clusters of ringlets and bubbles. Some specks of lacing adhered to the walls of the glass during the tasting. Nose expresses big cinnamon aromas, followed by raisins, all eventually yielding to the total cookie experience. Taste follows nose, but much more muted. Some brown sugar also comes out in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with a slightly watery consistency and a finish that falls just short of dry. Decent, but overall flavor and mouthfeel are a little lackluster.","Jwale73","Feb 13, 2011"

Cinnamon, nutmeg, all sorts of spices rush in, leaving a pleasant spicy aftertaste. A very good, very complex, very unique beer. The mouthfeel might be a little thin for the spice rush here, but it all works. The one part where this beer suffers is the drinkability. This is definitely a brew to end a good night of drinking. I don't think I'd ever have more than one of these a night. It's just a bit too much to keep drinking all night, I'm glad this is in 12 ounce bottles instead of 22.

Recommendations to increase the mouthfeel of the beer. The watery mouthfeel is a little bit of a let down. Otherwise a great recipe!!","adkirkish","Sep 10, 2010"

4.23,2.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"You can tell brewers are getting inventive when they make a beer taste like oatmeal raisin cookies. This version of CC's Maduro comes out a ruby red color, with a handsome looking white heading. The oatmeal certainly shines through in the nose first. Cinnamon and a hint of raisin follow, along with some must and brown sugar. So far not quite there as far as smelling like the aforementioned cookie type. At this point the brew is still a bit on the cold side, so I will let it sit for a few moments. The more it warms, the more of the oatmeal comes through. Upon first tasting it is almost like a Winter Warmer with all the spices, but the aftertaste is what really makes it. After swallowing, the nose is totally overcome with what an oatmeal raisin cookie tastes like. Hints of cola come off in the beginning, but again, as the finish makes its way in to the senses, it is nothing but oatmeal, raisins and cookie crust. Mouthfeel is medium, with just a hint of hops, bittering things only slightly. No real detection of alcohol is present, which is appropriate, as this is a moderately strong beer. Although I am sure this would work perfectly with dessert, from where I am sitting, this beer is a dessert in itself. Please let this one warm up to room temperature to fully enjoy the range of flavors it has to offer. This is easily the most interesting beer I have tasted this year. It further solidifies why Cigar City is one of the front runners for best up and coming brewery. Huge thanks to bobby8405 for sending me this gem.","jamie2dope","Sep 03, 2010"

4.62,11.6,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"On-tap at the Cigar City tasting room in Tampa. Pours a dark brownish black color with a nice light tan colored head. The aroma is amazingly similar to what you would imagine an Oatmeal Raisin Cookie to smell like. A lot of sweet malts and dark fruits with a ton of raisin in the aroma. Absolutely amazing they pulled off the aroma the way they did. The taste like the aroma is really delicios. Sweet malt and dark fruits with a real smooth finish. This beer is very drinkable. Would be an awesome breakfast beer, or even a tasty dessert beer as well. Didn't think I would enjoy this one as much as I did but it was fantastic!","cjgator3","Jul 20, 2010"

4.47,8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Has this fine draft at the CCB tasting room. Poured into a pint glass. The appearance on this beer has that brown hue to it, with minimal head that leaves a slight lace the glass. Smell is of cinnamon, fresh baked cookies, nutmeg, vanilla, the smell from this beer is out of this world. Taste is dead on with the smell, it litteraly tastes like a cinnamon cookie in a liquid form, very refreshing and smooth with a nice overall coffee raison type finish. This was amazing offering from CCB and one I hope they release in bottle form.","gunnerman","Mar 14, 2010"

4.03,-2.7,4,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,"Pours a deep dark brown with a one finger light khaki colored head. Bits and pieces of stick cling to the side of the glass, but not much. Aroma is sweet with cinnamon, nuts, and some brown sugar. Some chocolate malts and a touch of earth underneath the sweetness in the nose as well. Not really what I was expecting in the aroma, but the Maduro is definitely there. Taste, ok...that's what I'm talkin' bout. Oatmeal, sweet sugar, vanilla, and raisins (and I mean straight up raisins). The taste of this beer so accurately represents the name, I love it. What I love most about this? It's not overly sweet which is actually what I had anticipated going into this beer. Light to medium body with a slick carbonation. A bit watery in the feel, but not terribly so. I like this beer a lot, although I'm a big Oatmeal Cookie fan so I might be slightly biased. Big ups to CCB for not making this insanely sweet and surprisingly drinkable.
