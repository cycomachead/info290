"Liked this beer and the guy behind me blew the tap! He said it was the last one they were getting! Didn't cry over it but If I could have got the last of the keg for free I would have been fantastic! It was a very lite and smooth for a dark beer. I could drink a few different then a heavy stout!"
"A very nice solid Brown Ale"

"Taste-Toasted malt, caramel, toffee, milk chocolate, and a nice little undercurrent of hops that balance everything out. A very enjoyable, tasty brown ale."

"Interesting take on a brown here, more of a caramel toasty base than a nutty chocolate roast one, making it a lighter and more easy drinking, but equally flavorful example of the style. Nice frothing head on it with decent retention, an amber hue, and a nose of sweet medium crystal malt. The yeast is nondescript, unlike other English style browns out there, but u don't miss it as the beer is dry enough for me in the finish and not seemingly missing anything. Medium bodied with average carbonation, this beer isn't going to change the world, but it's a plenty serviceable warm weather brown, and that's all good in my book."

"Smooth, great caramel and chocolate notes"
"Overall- This is pretty good, one of the better beers Sweetwater offers."

"Not exactly smooth or enjoyable."

"Sweet Chocolate comes through. Not much else. Nothing special here."

"This is probably my favorite beer right now. I love Brown Ales and this is the best I've had.  I buy it regularly. I am from Georgia, and of English decent, so I'm basically who this beer was made for.  Plus, this  is readily avialible in my area. Thanks Sweetwater! It really looks beautiful in a glass.  Clear ruby red and brown. Satisfying from the first taste to being plastered. This ain't sipping ale."

"Bulldog in Jackson MS. Hefty lacing that quickly dissipated. Smooth with hints of molasses and caramel.  Delicious brown ale. Reminds me of KM Brown.  Can I get some more?"

"Pours a 1 inch head. Smells richly of malt and chocolate. Sweet tasting. Chocolate and caramel-ish flavors really stand out. Moderate lacing. No bitter aftertaste. Recommend this beer to anyone who has tried other browns and come away unsatisfied. Will definitely be buying this beer again."

"Overall: Decent Brown Ale that could us a little more hops and/or nuttiness to combat the sweet malts."
"Overall, where's the toast and nut? Comes off like a neutral beer which is even more surprising for a brown ale."

"O - This actually reminded me more of a Porter but nevertheless it was enjoyable and certainly worth giving a try if you are a fan of this style."
""
""
"overall OK, nothing too special, but a decent drinkable brown ale, that slight herbal raw molasses flavor and corn syrup like similar aroma are the real things that detract from it, but still pretty tasty, still wish there were a bit more hops and bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Good malt character, English hops. Floral notes are a nice change, though the fruity malt character is slightly overdone."

"Overall- a nice american brown, good to the style and full of flavor. I'll have another pint when I find myself with another layover in Atlanta"

"Overall, this is a well balanced beer. It's pretty sweet and thin and it goes down very smooth. This would be a perfect session brew. Not my favorite from SweetWater, but nonetheless this is a very good brew."
"overall: An average brown ale, highly drinkable. Non craft beer enthusiats would love this, very accesible flavor profile, not a whole lot happening. Great for a hot summer day, would buy again but no need to seek this out or anything."

"This offering from Sweetwater pours a medium mahogany brown with about a one finger taupe colored head and not a whole heap of lacing. Smell is bread, nuts, and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is pretty satisfying. Taste is pretty mild. Sweet and malty upfront followed by a nutty bitterness on the finish. Very drinkable, maybe too sweet if anything."

"Not a bad choice for our last night in Atlanta bringing it with Sweetwater brewing but this was a little too ordinary of a brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Nice degree of sweetness. Nice aroma with the taste less complex."
""
""
""
""
"The taste just falls in line with the smell. The dry nutty flavors are hidden by the slick and sweet malt. I actually really like the flavors, although its not overly complex. Its a simple, easy to drink, slightly sweet Nut Brown."
"Overall, this is a pretty solid brown ale. Not spectacular by any means but a decent representation of the style."
""
"O- fantastic brown ale, one of my favorites. Criminally underrated"
"Enjoyed this one while building a Browning M2 machine gun and tripod! :D Served from bottle into a shaker. Poured dark brown with a one finger khaki colored head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, nutty, and cream. The flavor was of roasted malt, dark chocolate, cream, and nutty. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I was really quite pleasantly surprised to find the nice roastiness mixed with the dark chocolate in this one. I really did not expect it to be there. The aroma was pretty much the same story with a nice well balanced profile going on. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance or are lucky enough to receive this one as an extra during a trade."

"Overall I thought that this was a mediocre beer and a pretty average English Brown Ale. There were no off flavors, but it didn't have enough of those great English Brown Ale flavors. This beer had ok drinkability. it went down pretty smooth and it wasn't filling, but the flavor couldn't hold my attention so one is all I would want. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma and the slight hazelnut aspect to this beer, they were the highlight of this beer. What I liked least about this beer the light body and the lack of head and lacing, they were both out of wack and need some work to make this beer compete with some of the better English Brown Ales. I am glad I tried it, but I don't think I would get this beer, it wasn't a memorable English Brown Ale, and I don't really recommend trying this beer, it isn't hard to find some better English Brown Ale. I wasn't too impressed with this beer, it just felt too watery, and the flavors were a little bland and didn't stick out like they should. I am starting to like this Georgia brewery, but this beer failed to impress me, better luck next time guys, I know you can do better."

"Growler fill at GBX poured into a snifter. Nice solid deep brown with a decent 1 finger off white head. Adequate lacing and retention. Smell is nice roasted malts and some hints of nuts and a touch of carmel to add to the aroma. Taste follows the nose and mixes malts and hops quite well. A fairly complex EBA IMO. Sits well on the tongue with a good bit of carbonation and a medium feel which is nice a creamy. Overall- It's a nice example of the style and has a very balanced taste with some sweet and some bitter. A soild effort by Sweetwater and I would hit another one of these. It's pretty sessionable and refreshing-"
""

"Easy to drink, but nothing special. Not bad, might buy again when I visit the South."
""
""
"Pours to a thin tan head and brown color. Aroma is chocolate malt, smoky malt and earthy hops. Flavor is hershey syrup followed by mellow hops and sweet malts. Mouthfeel is good. Overall, this beer is easily accessible due to low hop bitterness and maltiness. Mass appeal. Recommended."
""
"Drink- A nice small brown ale. Had good layers of flavors and overall very smooth. Non grainular like most and not overly malty. I would like a couple bottles of this."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a really solid beer. It's flavorful, complex, drinkable, refreshing, enjoyable. I would definitely have this again."

"Beer has a good bit of carbonation and is well bodied."
""

"Overall:	It was an alright beer that I don’t think I would put in to my personal rotation."
"Overall a pretty straight forward Brown Ale. Bold and tasty, but with no surprises. Most definitely a brew you could drink a few of."
""
""
""
""
"Tastes Sweet, mildly roasty, caramely and touch of Chocolate, No hops at all for balance. This is a pretty straightforward American brown ale, no surprises in the flavor, but no flaws either. Not as much in the nose however, just some lightly roasted malt, more aroma wouldn’t hurt. Medium bodied and well-carbonated. The beer’s color is on the border between light brown and dark amber, and the light tan head settles to a ring. A few small patches of lace are left on the glass. Decent, but not amazing."

"This beer has a unique taste that I have never experienced in a brown ale or any other beer for that matter. There is a sweet sugary taste that is typical of brown ales. However, there is also a fruity and maybe somewhat tangy flavor that follows this sweetness. The hop profile is not as noticeable, though it may be there and just covered up by the other bold flavors. Overall, this is a unique beer that I would recommend at least trying. I personally like it, though I feel that not everyone will like this different combination compared to other brown ales."

"Overall, a solid brown ale with no objectionable qualities. These beers are always mild and well-behaved and are probably not what most beer fans reach for. However, if you are a fan of this style, don't pass this one up."

"Ehh I could probably drink it again, but really not my type."
"O - excellent for style"
"O- A nice take on a English Brown Ale and very drinkable. I could see this being very enjoyable on a cold fall night."
"I quite liked this brown although I wish it had had a slightly fuller body on it, but that's ok with me."
"Light mouthfeel. Not too exciting but not a bad brown overall."
"Pours a cloudy amber-brown color with a small tan head that settles into a resilient film and leaves some lace. Aroma of wet dog, roasted malts, mud, rain water, wet grass, and soggy cereal. Flavor of toasted malts, nuts, root beer, lots of earth, and a lingering woodsy note. Light-medium bodied, with medium-high carbonation and a wet, earthy mouthfeel. Bad smell on a brown ale- this one is off."
"D- Highly drinkable. Relaxing, quality brew. Just enough body without being too heavy."
"O - This'ns a year rounder for sure, very tasty, excellent balance"
"O: Liked the malt character and overall balance."
"O - good brown ale that falls back to the middle of the pack but still offers good flavor."
"I'm not usually a brown ale guy, much less an English brown ale guy, but this is really good. I ordered one at a restaurant on tap the other day, but my wife was in a hurry so I didn't really get a chance to enjoy it, but I vowed to pick up a sixer to give it a fair shake. I'm glad I did. Dark brown with a big khaki head. (Did I just write khaki?) Lots of lace and stickiness in my Sierra Nevada Becker. Darker and richer than many big-named porters like Bell's and Sierra Nevada. Delicious, caramel aroma and taste. Not too thin on the palate, again, better than a lot of porters. Not a lot of hops, but after all it is an English brown ale. I really liked it and it was very fresh. Consume by 07/20/11. A great rich, malty brown ale that is better than many porters. I see a lot of these in my future when I don't want a lot of hops."
"not bad, more fruity similar to their porter."
"D - Very good. I could have numerous of this beer. As a matter of fact, anytime I am in the mood for a brown ale, Georgia Brown it is."
"The flavor on this one is solid, but not too special. That said, this is a good, very drinkable brown ale-I would be happy to stick with this for a few pints and it wouldn’t fatigue the palate."
"O: It is an above average brown ale. I tend to prefer more malt and toasted flavors than the fruity esters. That being said, it is still a quality beer for those that tend to the fruitier side."
"Smells malty with a little nose hoppiness. Pours thin and brown with a light tannish head. Notes of nuts and roast in the malts. Slightly hoppier finish than a typical brown, as is typical with most Sweetwater products. I don't enjoy the hops in this brew - they just don't balance this brew out."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty decent American brown. I tried Bells Brown today as well, and I would have to say that this one is a little easier drinkin'. I can definitely appreciate the balance, and think that this would make a pretty good regular session beer if I lived in the area. I would drink it again for sure, and would recommend that you give it a try if you like your Brown ales more on the malty side like I do."
"A nice brown that I liked well enough to order a few times during my trip to GA. Refreshing and tasty."
"Overall, probably the sweetest brown I've ever had. I could see this being a decent English brown if they balanced it a bit more, but as it is, it is way too sweet for my tastes. The malt flavors are good though and would make this a good sessionable brew if they scaled it back a bit. Cheers!"
"D - I am not a big fan of sweet beers, but this was pretty drinkable. Smooth and quite refreshing. Not my style, I won't buy it, but I'd drink another one (from the fridge) with a nice beef brisket."
"D - Fairly heavy on the palate. I'd get again if I could find it."
"The beer was a brownish, copper color with a thin white head that left some good lacing on the glass. I could smell lots of sweet caramel malt, brown sugar and toasted bread. When I took a sip I first tasted the sweet malt, just like it smells, toasty, bready with hints of sweet fig. It has a medium body with just the right amount of carbonation. I thought it was just a little too sweet, but still a worthy drink."
"D - pretty good beer here. I had it with a lamb shank and it seemed to pair pretty well. I enjoyed it, however I think I would go with something else by Sweetwater next time."
"D- Easy to drink. Interesting, but a little on the biscuity side for my taste."
"overall really very well done and i would have no trouble at all with polishing off a couple of these."
"D: One of the worst brown ales I've ever tasted. That's a shame, but I had liked every Sweetwater brew I had ever tried up to that point."
"D - Nicely drinkable and entry-level, like most Brown Ales. Nicely sessionable."
"This beer is a fairly clear mahogany brown with umber shadows. The head isnt shy about leaving sticky bubbles everywhere. The aroma is simple, but in a beer like this that is just fine. Its nicely balanced with an earthy nuttiness and spicy hops on the back. The flavor is just about the same. A nice even nuttiness lays an earthy base under a spicy hopping. Dashes of coffee and chocolate are interspersed."
"D: If you're in the mood for a smooth, sweet brown ale this is a good option. Very drinkable, mellow, and refreshing."
"Overall, not something I'd purposefully purchase. Not a bad beer, but nothing special."
"This is a plenty tasty, easy-drinking brown ale. Not too shabby. Maybe this would fare better as an American brown ale; docked a bit for style."
"Verdict: Straight up the best Sweetwater product I have tried so far. It is plentiful with flavor and both tastes and feels great. Any improvements to this beer would need to be in the appearance factor or the smell to bring it up to the level of the superb taste. I would recommend this to anybody regardless of the beer types they enjoy. Great flavor balance. It's all around a very good beer. B+ (3.95)"
"Simple mouthfeel. Smooth, not too carbonated which really let's the nutty flavor come through. Easy to drink and a perfect session beer. Simple and flavorful, well worth giving a try."
"Drinkability- very good mouthfeel helps this beer very drinkable."
"D- Overall, Sweetwater Georgia Brown is a solid Brown Ale that is worth a try."
"D - Overall I think this is a pretty good brown has a good taste thats easy to drink worth a try if you like browns and can get it"
"I'm afraid it is hard for me to be more evocative about this beer than to simply say ""it was average."" Moderate malt with a touch of brown sugar. Although little hopping is expected for the style, what there was seemed watered down. Mouthfeel was mid-range, with a little sugaryness."
"drinkablity: Probably not something I'll go out of my way for. A nice but run of the mill brown."
"d - One of the better beers I've gotten in the club, this was an above average brown ale. Lots of caramel and toasted malts in the smell and taste and very easy to drink; could definitely have a few of these. Would have again."
"The last time I had Georgia Brown was at the Sweetwater brewery 2 years ago so I did not remember much. The pour yields a transparent ""watered down coffee"" look with minimal head that dissapates quickly. Aroma and taste are up front nutty and malt forward with minimal hop presence. Nothing out of this world, goes down smooth and enjoyable. Drinkability is quite high and would be easy to drink quite a few. Not as good as Big Boss Bad Penny, but enjoyable none the less."
"Overall impression: Could use a tweak or two, but goes down just fine."
"Pours a hazy mahogany color, with a nice tan head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma has a bunch of sweet malt notes, with chocolate and caramel, cafe mocha, sweet cream, toasted pecans, earthy hops and a hint of alcohol. The flavor is similar with chocolate and coffee notes upfront, along with caramel and toffee, toasted pecans, honey wheat bread and some earthy hops to keep things in balance. The mouthfeel is smooth and drinkability is excellent. Really easy drinking brown ale that has enough going on to keep you interested...perfect fall beer."
"you can prob drink these all night long....with little abv%"
"drinkability- 3 a night/ one night a month"
"Overall, this is in need of fleshing out. But you could do worse, and the brewing process seems spot on."
"Notes: Definitely not the best SW offering or brown ale, but this is sessionable. Glad I tried it."
"Nice medium brown color with frothy light tan head and good carbonation. Light nutty aroma. Flavor is lightly sweet and malty with a slight hoppy bitterness. Exactly what a good sessionable brown ale should be. Smooth and drinkable. My thanks to Glid02 for this one!"
"D: Very drinkable, nice blend of flavors and a modest abv making it a pretty sessionable brown ale."
"Mild and easy-drinking, this is quite the quaffer. A great example of the style, plain and simple, though best served at cellar temperature to bring out its best and truest qualities."
"I must say this is one of my least favorite from Sweetwater. Maybe it was produced to have a beer in the style in order to meet demand, but it doesn't go as far out as some of the other Sweetwater beers. The head quickly dissipates, from thin to void, unless you put on a heavy pour. The off white head provides the caramel to the nose, but not the hops. This easy drinking beer seems to be built for six-pack drinking, rather than some thing as extreme as Dank Tank. Still good enough for me."
" D- This beer has a nice aroma and flavor but it is just very muted."
"Looks good, smells good and tastes good, but leaves me wanting a little more."
"D - Overall too one-dimensional to be a great beer. With the dominating roastiness and no malt to round it out, it reminds me more of a watered-down stout than an authentic English brown. I appreciate the attempt at a style that is not copied much commercially in the States, but this one misses the mark."
"This beer is another point in Sweetwater's favor. Well done, guys!"
"Over all this is good Brown ale but I wonder if this six pack was a little old. I believe fresh this would be amazing. The mouth feel is not too thin or heavy."
"(Bottle into pint glass -- Sampled 2/27/10) Pours a solid brown color with a small creamy head that falls fast. Nose is heavy with molasses and caramel and a hint of a toast in the mix. There is very little hint of hops, both in the nose and the flavor. A smooth drink, it tended to the sweet side, but was overall rather pleasant. A decent session beer, but you might find yourself reaching for something with a little more bite to complement the sweetness of this one."
"Thanks to my friends who brought this back from Atlanta. It's a simple brown with toasty dark bread crust and hint of toffee. It's a touch sour, but the label says it's good for another month, so it might just be a little black grain. Worth a try if you dig brown ales."
"Excellent brew! The appearance was like the bsp from sweetwater it has a nice lace that definetly sticks to the glass the whole way down. The smell is of malts and full of hops! The taste wow I was not expected the sweet caramel taste but man it is good. The mouthfeel is medium but very nice which makes for a great drinkability goes down so smooth!! I think this definetly worth having the wonderful state of georgia in its name!!!! I advise you to try any of the sweetwater brews beings that I have not found one that is bad yet!"
"D - Overall I think this is a pretty good brown has a good taste thats easy to drink worth a try if you like browns and can get it"
"Overall, a decent beer and about what you'd expect to get in these BOTM clubs (got as a gift not a purchase) - safe, middle of the road to appeal to the masses and not push any boundaries. Recommend if you can get one from a friends fridge. Rotation - not available here in TX. If here, wouldn't make the rotation [N;N]"
"-Bye"
"Drinkability: I thought these were pretty good to drink. The flavors of anything special really didn't blow me away but that's okay. I'd pick one up again. I'd like to try it on tap."
"The second bottle of this beer was better when I just drank it from the bottle and didn't sip and savor it as in the review style - it's just one of those beers that's just better to drink than analyze the taste and smell."
"D-I think this is a pretty solid English Brown Ale. I really like the aroma and taste. I could drink a lot of these during a hot summer BBQ of Indonesian Pork Satay."
"This beer is very drinkable, however, it didn't leave a lasting impression."
"Mouthfeel is decent enough, light-to-medium bodied, & doesn't just lay there. This was a weird one for me; started off well enough, but I don't understand the transformation in the smell, & the taste was not blowing me out of the water anyway. Maybe I got a bad bottle, & I'd be happy to edit my review in the future if I find this was the exception rather than the rule with this beer."
"I figured I have been in Atlanta long enough that I should give this beer a try and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Really a plain old, no frills brown ale that's a little shallow malt-wise, but is a nice smooth-drinking beer that goes down easy."
"D - Good session beer if you are looking to drink without really paying much attention to the flavor. Won't wow you or disgust you."
"I got this as part of my BOTMC. Pale,clear brown in color with a fizzy white head, slight lacing. There is a breadiness? on the nose, maybe some damp hay. The beer is light and sweet. The beer finishes with a lingering bitter hop, very slight. The beer is on the thin side. A very easy drinking, non descript brew."
"Cheers!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is ok, a little sweet for my taste."
"This is a fair representation of the style, with a good flavor that would be even better if there was more substance to the body. Not bad."
"Drinkability is okay, it's a generic American brown ale, good enough but forgettable."
"Notes: While this isn't as good as an actual English english brown ale, it is a very enjoyable recreation. It stays true to the style of mild earthy hops. The mouthfeel is a little heavier than some light english style browns, but it makes this beer better."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, pale hops, slight citrus, and slight yeast. Fits the style of an Englsih Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, hops, pale hops, and slight citrus. Overall, a good body, blend, a little more like an Americna Brown Ale, but still good."
"Overall, a decent beer. Glad I tried it, but will not cry if I don't try it again."
"Pours a copper color with a two-finger thick head. Very enjoyable, balanced brew. I don't have too much to say - it's simply a pretty good beer. It doesn't take many risks, but it doesn't really do anything wrong either. Simply a well-rounded ale. If this on tap at a restaurant, it'll probably be my go-to."
"D- Nice easy flavor with just enough kick. Sweet, roasty, and balanced."
"Drinkable, but for a Brown Ale - not up to expectations."
"Pretty easy to drink."
"Glad I got to try it, I doubt I'd have another"
"Overall: The mouth feel of the beer is not flat but not carbonated, although there is effervescence bubbles present. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is nil. This beer is different there are grassy/straw note in the beer that give the beer some harness to it. I really cant explain it."
"D - I really like the flavors, but I can't help feeling that they went a little half-assed with this one. What I'm smelling and tasting is excellent, I just wish I could smell and taste more of those aspects. But, this is intended to me a mild brew based on the style so I really can't fault it for that. This is a tasty, but underpowered. A decent session choice though!"
"The feel is creamy and substantial, but not thick. Minor fizz, but smooth too. A good beer overall, easy to slug down but not wimpy. It's a complex, malty concoction."
"I had this beer before bedtime last night and I'm surprised it didn't give me nightmares. This beer was just plain awful. It had a freshness date of 5-22-09 so it wasn't out of date. But there wasn't very much good about this beer -- smell, taste, mouthful and drinkability were way under par for what I believe a Sweetwater brew should offer. I really felt I was sniffing the glass of a macro, and mouthful, I found to be very thin and unappetizing. I will definitely avoid this one in the future."
"D :: I'd say this was drinkable but it lacked any depth and I really wanted more from it. I didn't find this offering unpleasant nor pleasant. Not my favorite brown, but it is still drinkable and worth at least one try."
"Poured a cloudy copper color with a small modest head, frothy in texture and the lace adequate to coat the glass. Nose is mostly malt, sweet, fresh and pleasant enough, start is ambrosial, nicely malted and the top middling in feel. Finish is stinging in its acidic bite, the hops moderate in presence and bite, dry lingering aftertaste."
"Overall, very solid drinking and I would not have trouble taking a few of these down as part of a session. Decent, solid, but not a brainbuster. Pick it up if convenient."
"It is medium to full bodied with a heavy malt taste with a hint of caramel in the middle before a slight hop finish at the end."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, with some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, with some caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, nice touch of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, a tasty English Brown Ale."
"On tap (at Pub 71, Atlanta, GA) - brown in appearance with a slight white head that was not well retained. It had a very light roasted malt aroma to it, but again, very weak. The taste pretty well followed the nose, a light roasted malt flavor, pretty simple and not much flavor to it. It had a light body to it, seemed almost a little watered down. Still, if you can get past that, the beer was smooth and about average drinkability. I probably will not order again and this beer does not appear to do the style justice."
"Let's see, it definitely has what I would expect for the style (English Brown Ale), which involves a bit more hoppiness and not too much emphasis on malt. It could almost pass for a barleywine as well. I conclude that it's drinkable and one could enjoy quite a few in a sitting without having to turn it in for the night."
"Drinkability: A fine example of the style and a perfect accompaniment to some fresh cut garlic fries."
"This is my first beer from Sweetwater and I'm not overly impressed. Hopefully the next one will be better."
"The drinkability of Sweetwater's Georgia Brown in my opinion is somewhat low. The taste of the beer has a bit too much sweetness to it for a brown ale and a bit more of an emphasis on the faint roasted flavors in the beer could have made this offering a real winner. The crafting of Georgia Brown is just too loose and light in nature to really impress as a top notch brown ale."
"drinkability: not good"
"This was very smooth and drinkable. I hope to come across this one again, as I had 3 bottles from the microbrew beer of the month club. I will try more brown ales because I liked this so much"
"Notes: A successful brown ale. I recommend it."
"Fairly clear, amber brown beer with a one finger cap of off-white bubbles that quickly settled to a collar. Just a bit of lacing. Caramel and brown sugar aroma, nutty with some butterscotch. Same in the flavour, bitterness was present but restrained. Bread crust and mild fruity notes, definitely balanced towards malt with hop flavour just out of focus. Medium to light bodied, average carbonation, fairly smooth. Quite drinkable and easy on the palate."
"I'm a fan of this one, very nice brown ale!"
"Drinkability is good on this brew I enjoyed it with a big bowl of cheddar soup wish I had a few more for the rest of the day"
"M/D - Very thin, almost water mouthfeel. A little too sweet for my liking which knocks the drinkability down a step. Not a horrible beer, but nothing great either. The weakest offering I have sampled from Sweetwater."
"D - This is a pretty average English brown and a bit too sweet for my personal tastes for a sessionable beer."
"D - Very high drinkability with the moderate alcohol and balanced taste."
"Another sample poured by the busty black girl at the Juke Joint in that Atlanta airport. Off the tap this beer displayed a mediocre tan head of mid-size bubbles and a copper colored liquid leaning towards the red side. It laced like a jigsaw puzzle all the way down my glass too. No visible carbonation rising in the beer. As for the aroma... where is the aroma? Musty malt and faint grains; too subtle in my opinion. Malts are the most distinct flavors in the beer with a bready quality in particular, some nuttiness and again that horse-saddle mustiness. A farmhouse style flavor palate. Feisty carbonation neutralized some of the flavors. Not as deep as it could be for a brown but above average for an airport beer."
"D: Fairly easy to drink, one i'd seek when i head down south"
"Thi"
"I would weakly recommend this beer. I got this bottle from the Microbrew of the Month club folks."
"This has elements of a porter, but overall it is a crystal malt tasting beer. There is balancing hop in the swallow and aftertaste. Good rich body with a high level of carbonation."
"Tasty brown. Deep leather brown (some have suggested ""chestnut"") color in the glass (slight haze); small head that disappeared quickly. Malty nose, with just a hint of something (hops?) that, when tasted, leaves a veggie/ caramel/ nutty aftertaste. Nothing bad, just difficult to classify. Carbonation is mild, with decent mouthfeel. All in all, a decent brown, but the more you sip the more you wonder what you're tasting. Probably better on tap."
"For a hot muggy day in the southeast, this could be good."
"Nice light malty flavor that is very easy to drink. Nothing too exciting here, but very quaffable."
"Easy drinking brown ale due to the lightness of the brew. It's okay, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"Drinkability is moderate. Low alcohol makes this brew easy to consume, but flavor is lacking and uninspiring."
"D: It would be more drinkable if the mouthfeel was a bit improved, but this is still a decent brown ale. The flavor has some real potential, it just needs to be allowed to develop better without all the carbonation. Still a good beer that would make a nice casual session."
"D- A good brown ale no doubt, I prefer Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar over this but it is something I would buy again."
"D: the best beer by Sweetwater in my opinion. Good brew for a southern brewery, and worthy of a try."
"Another so-so brew from Sweetwater. Terrapin is passing Sweetwater pretty quickly in my opinion. Anyway, onto the review, pours a murky brown without a much in the way of carbonation. Sweet smell. Can't pick anything out of it though. Taste is mediocre at best. A watery, sweetish mixture that doesn't deliver. Overall, a watered down brew that is pretty drinkable. Not my favorite style or brew."
"Beer pours a very a nice chestnut color topped off by a decent head that left a trail of lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is sweet malt with some nuttiness and a very slight hint of hops. The flavor is again malty and nutty. Not much in the way of hops. The flavor comes across as a tad weak, but not too bad. Smooth and medium bodied, one could easily stick with this beer for the entire night."
"Thanks to Maria for picking this up for me during her travels."
"Drinks fairly easy, a decent not great brown ale. Was looking for roastyness or some nuttyness. I could put 2 or 3 down before boredom set in"
"12 oz. bottle: This one pours a fairly clear, brown color. Mine had a pretty good size off-white head on it, but didn't leave much in the way of lacing. The nose is malty with a little nuttiness in there also. The taste is also pretty decent. Malty with a bit of nuttiness . Very drinkable. Another good beer from these guys."
"D - Not particularly interesting, but well balanced and easy to drink. It has plenty of malt, but I was surprised to find that it is fairly bitter as well. If there are any flaws here, they would be a slight harshness to the bitterness and flatness to the hop aroma, but neither are a big deal in a brown ale."
"On-tap at the brewpub. Another sweet brown beer, clearly a malt play.Caramel,and on the sweet side, even a bit thin though sitable carbonation. Some soapy head and lacing was nice. Kind of a root beer, with licorice. Unnnecessary as the blue gives all the sweet beer drinkers their fill."
"Overall: My first Sweetwather brew and it is pretty drinkable. I am not a huge fan of brown ales, but this one was rather enjoyable. If I ever saw it on tap I would order it without any reservations."
"Ok...what to say...this beer pours a fading copper brown with minimal head...there is some lacing and the beer appears to be a little high on the carbonation. Appearance is alright. Nose? not alot here....a little buttery toffee, nuts and malt on the nose...but barely detectable which could be a sign of conservatism(happens alot with this style)...taste...yep....not alot going on here....like the nose a little butter toffee...a little sweet roasty maltedness ...unfortunately, it all leaves like a leer jet and ZERO aftertaste.. and not so high on the mouthfeel.. Not all negative though... not much taste but also not any bad stuff in here... just not enough character. A very clean tasting, highly drinkable Brown Ale that is light, in every way, for the style. You could go through alot of these but style-wise I prefer a flavorful lager...just as underwhelming I know, but for the same price, I'd rather have a Red Stripe. Overall-above average for cleanliness and drinkability but nothing to write home to ma about. I can smell and taste the slightest hint of a MrGoodbar with this but if you want a no-holds-barred but still yet drinkable for the style brown try Columbus Nut Brown Ale...thin like this....clean like this...but much higher on appearance and taste and it tastes like the Mr.Goodbar is actually in there! ahng."
"Overall I give this slightly more than a passing grade. A good effort."
"Definitely a beer you could sit and have several of while talking to friends or to have with supper. Since it is a Southern brewery and perhaps the nearest to me, I think I will be having these frequently. A good solid beer. (Easily read freshness dating on the bottle is always a plus to me as well, I wish they all did.)"
"Although like I said it's not what I expected, it's a quaffable brew. I would imagine being 60 miles from the source helps in the freshness dept. as it does taste very fresh... no stale flavors detected."
"D- Very drinkable and easy going down. A very nice session brew for sure. I have had it bottled before, but this was the first time on tap. I really enjoyed it, and hope to have it again soon."
"Nice aromas of coffees, toffee and caramel  all subtle. Tasty pop of a raspy, woody and earthy dry brown  English style. A fine drinker, she went down smooth and easily."
"D: With both the Brown and the IPA, Sweetwater is a pleasant surprise. This is a good session beer with a crisp flavor and a manageable alcohol body."
"D - An easy to drink and well made brown. Very average and nothing phenomenal, but very quaffable and worth a try nevertheless."
"Taste was balanced well between mild hops and the malts overall a good beer. This is a good dinner beer or something casual to have when wanting to relax overall it was a good beer and a good call for a casual beer"
"Found this quite by accident at the TGIF in terminal B at the Atlanta Airport. Big old fashioned microphone tap handle spoke out for a try. I was quite pleased. The appearance is a solid chocolate brown brew with a sturdy head that held firm to the very end of my 22 ounces. Lacing is also decent. Aroma is modest but is a bit of brown bread and malt. The flavor jumps out as brown sugar and charcoal with a bit of chocolate. There is a slight orange tang at the tip. Somewhat aqueous with friendly carbonation throughout. A very nice, mild, drinkable beer which I will certainly sample again when given the chance."
"On tap at the Vortex, Atlanta. This is a very nice, non-offensive beer. Nothing outlandish or unusual about it, just simple and nice. Standard to all English Browns, this pours with a tactile quality, promising creaminess and texutre, with moderate carbonation and is well headed. Faint aromas of chocolate, malt, and toast. Flavors rely on sweet barley malts, followed up by chocolates, bready / toastiness, hop balance, and a touch of lactose. Mild textures of smoothness and richness makes the brew pleasant to drink, yet round enough to keep from thinning. A light alchohol cooling and a lingering sweetness fades into cleanlines late."
"D  This beer is non- offensive but interesting enough to want more.goes down easy."
"Aroma has a hint of molasses, and is beery but not overwhelmingly so. Color is a pretty brown. Taste is malty and mild with a smoky undertone and hints of caramel. This beer works by itself, or as a party drink, or as an accompaniment to a nice meal."
"A good session beer, but a bit light on flavor."
"Quite drinkable, a very nice fall session beer."
"Overall: I would avoid this generic brown ale as anything other than a gateway beer for your macro friends."
"Drinkability: The combination of clean feel and low ABV make this beer very drinkable. Hopefully, other newer bottles had more pleasant carbonation levels."
"Overall, a solid but forgetable beer. I would love to have this again, but could live without it. good beer when i have a sugar tooth."
"i did this in a side by side comparison with sam smith's nut brown ale. they are very similar but i think this beer is slightly better. and then when you compare the price $7 for 6 of SGB compared to $9 for 4 of the sam smith. SGB is the clear winner."
"Above average from one of my favorite out of reach breweries."
"Drinkability: I really didn't want to admit it to myself, but I had no choice at that point. I threw down my pint glass, looked up at the sky, and yelled with every last bit of energy I had left: ""This is the white bread of brown ales!"""
"Pours to a bright copper color with a hint of red, medium white head, and minimal lacing. Okay aroma of malty nuts and honey. Flavor somewhat on the toffee side, and this beer ahd a little bit of a bitter finish. Not bad for a brown ale, which Im not a real fan of."
"this one has set in my cellar for some time, a year I have had it."
"Medium to thin bodied with a good deal of crispness. Easy to put down. Quite refreshing. I can see why so many locals pick this up. Its a good transitional brew that can break the summer heat."
"Very Drinkable. I like this one quite a bit. It's not so nutty like other style English Browns are. Defineitely worth another visit."
"The mouth is a trifle thin, but this is a nice session beer. Worth a try for sure!"
"Clear brown beer with a big head with very little retention. Slight lacing. Sweet malty nose with a pinch of nuts and dark fruit. Smooth feel coupled with the sweet malt and nutty taste. There is a hint of ripe fruit in the finish balanced with a bitter note on the way down. This is probably my favorite brown ale to date. Great local brew for me. Good to see beers like this coming out of the south east."
"Small and medium tan bubbles form a modest head atop the burnished copper liquid. There are but a few sporadic carbonation streams. The head is sticky and slowly settles to a thin skim coat. The smell is of sweet roasted malt, nut meats, with hints of honey and coffee/toffee. The taste is vacant up front, just plain empty. It finishes slightly bitter with some hints of roasted malt, but none of the rich flavors suggested by the smell. There was even a touch of sour bitterness in the finish. Light body and light mouthfeel, modest carbonation. Drinkability is OK, but this one left me wanting more."
"I had this beer in a standard pint glass. It is a deep rich brown with very little head and a bit of lacing early in the session. The smell is a very light malty chocolate smell. The mouthfeel is a medium weight and fizzy on the edges of the tongue. The taste is a smooth, light, malty flavor with a very light hoppiness. The finish is of chocolate and lingers for a while. This is a very drinkable beer! Another great beer from Sweetwater!"
"All round good brown ale. Superior to Newcastle brown that makes it to the USA, a very good beer to convert a macro drinker with."
"Moderate mouthfeel leads to a fairly decent overall drinkability score. This one's straight 3's all the way down. To paraphrase Miles from _Sideways_, I've learned never to expect greatness from a Brown Ale, and this is no exception. A pity, given how much I love Sweetwater's IPA and 420 Pale Ale."
"Aroma is almost citrusy with hints of almoand and cake. Amber/copper hued with a slowly diminishing thumb thick tan head. Fore is mildly hoppy then the smooth malts come in. Some nuttiness, but more sweetness and very mild toasted bread flavor int he finish. Very good brown."
"It's easy enough to drink, but instantly forgettable."
"Thanks Andy!!"
"If I was looking for a traditional English brown ale, I would probably choose this. However, it is a fairly drinkable and unique brew. As the top of the page already told you, it's worth a try."
"Comments  Thanks to Uncle Flip for including this in his WTF BIF package to me. It was a thoughtful gesture and made me almost gasp when I saw it in the box as I had always wondered how I could get my hands on another bottle. Cheers, mate!"
"Pours as described--a brown ale but pretty average in the looks dept. I do like the 45 rpm record holder logo. No lace or head to speak of. Smell is brown sugarry malt. Slight woody hoppiness. A decent brown but nothing to get too excited about. Mouthfeel is dry and deteriorates as you drink more of this beer. Not in a hurry to buy more of this one."
"Thanks anways to rajendra82 for the shipment."
"Thanks again to lostbearbrew for the generous shipment. Pours a dark amber and the head is thin and quick to leave the scene. The smell is of sweeter malts with dark fruits and a wee bit of chocolate coming through, though very lightely. These tastes come through on the palate as well, as it is a little sweet and a little nutty, but not overly so. This reminds me more of a Dark Mild than a Brown. The body is a bit thin and the malts are subdued. It finishes very clean with very little of the lingering flavors I would like to see in the beer. It has potential, it just needs to have the volume turned up. Sweetwater can do better."
"Although it is hard to pin this to a style, I would love a full keg of this in my house."
"Pours a deep amber with a thin slightly off white head,I had to wait for my bottle to warm a little to start to pick up on the aromas mainly of caramel malt and roasted nuts.Flavors are mainly intune with aromas caramel and roasted nuts mainly somewhat earthy in the finish but nothing out of the ordinary.Really thought this beer was quite watery and I think that took away from it,nothing horrible but not something I would search out agin."
"Overall, a decent brew that I would occasionally buy again if I had the opportunity. With just some minor changes it could be an outstanding beer."
"Picked this up at a beer store in Athens, GA for $1.59 a bottle. Had friends over for dinner tonight and a young lady wanted to try something dark and different. I'm glad she enjoyed this (and allowed me to pour a taster). Tastes of chocolate and caramel malts. Almost as good as the Cottonwood Low Down Brown. This affirms my ultimate preference for English Brown Ales."
"Acquired via trade. This beer pours a clear dark copper color with a medium thin off-white head. Very thin lacing. Aroma of mild malt, roasted nuts and caramel. Medium-bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Roasty grain character with malt, caramel and nut flavors. The finish is mildly sweet with just enough hops to make it nicely drinkable from start to finish. Overall this is a pretty good Brown. It isnt big in the flavor department but it is very easy to drink."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Not the kind of thing I'd turn to too often, but not bad, not bad at all."
"Overall, not for me."
"Pours a white head that dissipates quickly leaving no lace. Light carbonation. Clear copper color, smooth, good mix of hops and malts. Not a heavy beer, could be a good summer drink. Gold medal winner at the 2001 Great American Beer Festival for English style brown. No ABV in sight."
"A decent nut brown, but I've had better."
"I drank another the next day at a different temperature by warming it under tap water. At near room temperature, the unpleasant notes in the smell disppeared and it became a much better session beer. Still not the best brown ale, but much more passable."
"Tasted: 12/14/03"
"On tap at the Mill in Birmingham, AL. Medium carmel color of brown. Clear and shiny and not murky and dark, like I like. Much lighter than I expected, and lighter than most brown ales I have had. Medium nutty sweet smells. Some carmel and toffee. Hints of hazelnuts. Nice taste, good combination of the same smells. Nice slightly toasted carmel malts, toffee sweetness, but not slick. Very easy to drink. Lively carbonation and good body. A good version, but nothing spectacular. I expected more flavors. The 7 Bridges Magnolia Nut Brown Ale is far better."
"Crystal clear dark bronze hue. Off white, well retained one fingered head trails decent lace. Aroma comprised of soft medium lovibond caramel malt with a subtle, rounded nuttiness. Lightly earthy hop nose with trace of wood. Clean, understated aroma, much like most brown ales. Baked biscuit sweetness initially in flavor is ensued by mellow caramel with tinges of toffee. Sweetness becomes briefly honeyish mid palate, and remains relatively dominant, being only partially offset due to the paltry hop bitterness. Lightly bodied, with a thinnish, well attenuated mouthfeel shy on dextrins. Finishes mostly dry, with quickly fleeting notes of toasted malt sweetness. True to its name, Georgia Brown is sweet, but not cloyingly so. Tame, better than decent and quite drinkable. A stereotypical stepping stone microbrew for those who haven't yet ventured beyond beer darker than piss yellow."
"Poured a dark caramel brown with a thin head that left quickly. The nose immediately offered caramel, chocolate, and malt with a slight hint of coffee/espresso. I rated the taste a little lower because the aroma promised so much. While still a great taste of malts and hints of caramel with a smooth finish, it just didn't live up to the smell. Good Brown, but would be great if it tasted as good as it smelled."
"Pretty average for a brown ale. Not Sweetwater's best offering (see their Exodus Porter and IPA)."
"Overall an average brown ale that seems to need help in its balance. To sweet IMHO."
"The beer is a cloudless copper color on the pour with a modest head, frothy in texture and the lace adequate to coat the glass. Nose is mostly malt, sweet, fresh and pleasant enough, start is ambrosial, nicely malted and the top middling in feel. Finish is stinging in its acidic bite, the hops moderate in presence and bite, dry lingering aftertaste."
"Malty with some caramelly aspects. Too light in color and too thin in flavor an palate to be a good brown. After drinking Rogue Nutbrown and Boyne River Brown, this can't get much over average for a brown."
