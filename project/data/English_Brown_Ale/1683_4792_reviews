"I enjoyed this beer more over the summer but my palate in changing.. for the better.  Heck, I'd recommend this to someone if the other options were wither unknown or terrible.  It's worth a drink i suppose :)"

"Serving type: bottle."

"Pours to a permanent head that laces well. Aroma is brown, crystal and chocolate malts with nutty, roasty notes. Flavor is more of the same with a nice balancing low-impact hop bitterness that is distinctly English. Dry, crisp, nutty finish. Mouthfeel is medium and CO2 is on the high side for style. Overall a pleasing Brown."
"A fair though unexciting brown ale. The flavors and mouthfeel appear on the weak side of things and lacks a certain 'oomph' as far as overall impact. The beer doesn't fail as far as coming across as a brown ale, just lacks depth and distinction."

"I was heavy-handed in my pour until I realized that this one held a good bit of carbonation and I had to back down fairly quickly. I still got a pseudo-cascade which settled into two fingers of dense, light-tan head with good retention. Color was a lighter shade of brown than in the Messiah (SRM = > 17, < 22), but with NE-quality clarity and copper highlights. Nose had a distinct cocoa powder quality. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was fairly sweet, like chocolate, peanut butter and marshmallow. You might think that I would dislike this, being a resident hophead, but I actually thought that this was more aligned with the style. I liked it more than I did with Messiah, frankly. The finish was relatively sweet, but it is what I expect in the style. It was mostly chocolate, but I was still getting a nuttiness, especially on the extreme finish."

"It's pretty good beer."

"Poured a rich, semi-clear amber brown with a thin off-white head that stuck around. Quite nice looking, very true to style. Scents of nutty, faint caramel and bready malt, along with a slight hint of toasted bread. A light and malty aroma, true to style, but not the best. Flavor begins moderately malty sweet, with nutty and slight caramel malt flavors, balanced with a medium-low level of bitterness with a low floral hop character. This moves into toasted malt flavors and some toffee along with nutty flavors, balanced again by a medium-low bitterness. Finish is toasted and nutty malt flavors with the same medium-low level of bitterness and some slight floral hop flavors offsetting some malty sweetness. Aftertaste is nutty and toasted malt with a medium-low bitterness. A good malt-hop balance throughout, malty sweet with a balance of medium-low bitterness, not bad. Good and true to style, but not the best flavor for the style. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. The body is true to style, but the light carbonation hurts the feel. Still nicely drinkable. Overall this is a good English Brown Ale, that fits the style well enough. It just doesn't do enough to stand out. Still a good session ale, and I don't regret having it."

"The flavors work but are on the faint side. There's not a whole lot to get excited about here. This is, overall, a pretty forgettable beer but one I wouldn't turn down if offered. Something good enough to drink while doing other activities."

"O: This beer is quite malty but is easy to drink because it doesn't have that heavy of a mouthfeel."

"This beer has a lovely reddish-brown color to it. There wasn't much head on the pour and it didn't stick around too long. There's a nice toffee and roasted malt smell to this beer. There's a good toffee/nut flavor initially, after you let it sit for a minute, you get a bit of sweetness out of it. The carbonation is nice on this beer, with a good amount of bubbles lasting throughout; something enjoyable in the mouth."

"O - Better than I was expecting, and this was my first Santa Fe brew. A good solid brown ale, not too sweet or roasty, but lacking a bit in the mouthfeel."

"Almost, an excellent session beer."

"O: Would be much better without the bitterness, but that's what you get in an English Nut Brown."
""
""

"Overall: A nice drinking beer that’s a bit above average. Always, glad to have the chance to try a new brewery."
"O- Nothing special about this brew."

"Beer is medium in body, nutty and tobacco on the palate, an interesting beer with a nice nonbitter finish. Not the best brown out there but great on the flavor profile."
""
""
""
""
"Dark caramel brown in color with a reddish hue and hazy. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Roasted malt aromas with hints of nuts and charred malt. Medium bodied with a smooth feel through the middle and a tangy, crisp, dry finish. Sweet roasted and toasted malt flavors from beginning to through the middle. Bitter hop flavors just before the crisp dry finish. A solid brown ale. Easy to drink with nice flavors."
""
"Aroma is sweet and malty, unfortunately that is the best thing about this beer! Poured a brownish amber body with a thin (1/4 inch) head. The head lasted fifteen seconds and there is no lacing of the glass whatsoever. The taste is ,I think unintentionaly, sour with notes of maybe Alka-Seltzer. The mouthfeel is slick and oily. Drain pour."

"It was a good beer overall. Just smooth and consistent. Wanted to bump it a few of the ratings up a bit, but I couldn’t pull the trigger."
"a lighter, very drinkable english brown. pours a see through weak coffee color, thin in appearance, with a foamy tan head that fades quick. smells quite nutty, hazelnuts and even almonds in the nose and taste. flavor is rounded out by a great roasty malt body with plenty of earthy characteristics. the finish is on the dry side, with a nice hazelnut aftertaste. im not sure ive ever loved a beer from santa fe brewing co, but this one is maybe as close as ive gotten. very light in body and so extremely drinkable. not too heavy for summer drinking. affordable and a bit different than most."
""
"Nut Brown Ale pours a translucent almost transparent brown color, with a nice frothy head. There is a malty, nutty smell; not very strong. There is a nice full taste, a subtle malty flavor, but a nice hazelnut flavor. Not overpowering and rather easy to drink, and could easily go for another. Overall I found this very enjoyable, its not overpowering, it has a great blended taste, and the nut flavors fit very nicely."
"Overall Drinkability: Not my favorite brown ale."
"A fine and average brown ale."
""
""
"A medium brown tone with slight head. A very smooth and subtle flavor profile to this one. Sweet and roasty malts are the emphasis with a touch of nuttiness to the flavor. A creamy, medium body. Overall, this is a very simple but smooth brown ale. Easily drinkable, though not bold and not very memorable."
"O-An easy to drink, quick finishing brown ale with some nice toasted sweet character. Not overly complex, but a nice clean beer."
""
""
"Overall I'd say this is too mellow. I like my brown ales to be a little more robust and memorable. No a bad brew by any means, just not something to chase after."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability - The off characters of this beer really detract from this beers profile."

"Very drinkable, but unremarkable."
"12oz bottle purchased for $1.50. Light brown color, short wispy head. Smells very faintly like malt and caramel. Taste is equally faint, weak, malty but just not much there at all. Very easy to drink but the flavor is so lacking why bother. I've noticed the bottled Santa Fe offerings are not as good as the canned beers, I wonder why?"
"sweet, with lots of caramel malts leading the charge on this one. Hints of nuts, and a touch of molasses as well had me going right away. As it warmed we then were able to pick up some notes of bready malts, nice rush of sweet caramel, and this was quickly coating the inside of the mouth, leaving everything with a nice sweet film to it. As it passed the aftertaste gave in to much of the nuttiness that I had been looking for. a nice vinous like bitter bite to it. Very interesting indeed. Some notes of bready malts, and grain in the back and a nice slightly hopped, and a touch dry finish to it"
"The appearance was good ...I think for a nut brown ale,again I'm a nube. Its funny how different the same beer can be to everyone. It difinitely tells me to always give someone or something a second chance. MY bottle poured a good head and very good lace. I could smell a malty,nutty,fruity odor that also is in the taste,but there's a bitter hoppy taste that followed. I liked the fullness and body,but a little too much hop. Overall I would try this again and again"
"The beer pours a brownish color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the sweet toffee with a little bit of hazelnuts or pecans mixed in. There is also a little bit of grass from the hops in the aroma. The flavor is more of the same. I get a lot of toffee and caramel malt with a little bit of nuttyness in there as well. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A basic nut brown ale. Not bad."
"Impressive looks and a good nose although admittedly weak, but all in all this is only a slightly better than average beer. The beer came off flat and a tad off the mark in both taste and mouthfeel. By no means a bad beer, just not something memorable enough to warrant shelling out $8.50 a six."
"Nice warming flavors of roasted malt. Small head in the pint glass. Dark amber color. Touch of sweetness. Actually does taste like filberts, but also a touch of wood. Light hop note, more more bitterness from the grainy dark fired malt. Quite agreeable quaff for summer on the patio at Cowgirl in Santa Fe. Could use more carbonation but is quite drinkable. Better than lots of others in this style."
"O: I wasn't really impressed with this ale. It seemed true to style, but the flavor profiles were really lacking."
"Not an overwhelming amount of flavor. Probably wouldn't order again unless regs beers were the only other option."
"Good choice - certainly seems ""brown"" enough for me."
"D: This is an OK, if not great English Brown. It fits the style fairly well. Its lightness makes for easy drinking."
"Just when I thought my New Mexico stockpile was dry, I find two more. This one pours a clear russet topped by about a finger or so of light ecru foam. The nose is a nicely mild melange of flowers, greens, wood, and walnuts, with what I think to be toffee hanging in the rafter, waiting for the chance to spook some Ghost Hunters wannabes. The taste tacks on a nice bit o' maple syrup and brown sugar, rounding things out rather nicely, I must say. This is some tasty nut brown goodness, baby! The body is a rather light medium, with a light carbonation and a very fluid feel. Overall, a very nice and tasty nut brown, the best of the NM bunch I've had so far. That Marble Red's got a lot to live up to..."
"I don't think I'd put it on tap at home but I'd certainly love a case of it. Good drinkability, flavor, etc."
"D- Solid drinkability. Tasty, solid and pretty drinkable."
"It's a good drinker, not hard at all. But it's not the greatest of te style."
"D: Admit this is not a favorited style. Pleasing malty flavor, but quite muted. Hops character underwhelming. All that said, an easy drinker."
"D- wouldn't rule out trying again."
"Nice drinking brown with a solid complexity and a subtle English touch."
"Slightly hazed and reddish brown, topped by a beige cap. Looks good, sheets of sticky lace. Very malty aroma, almost bock-like, and not a lot of depth. Taste was better, mild bitterness with sweet caramel, lots of malt and a bit nutty towards the finish. Medium bodied with average carbonation, decent texture. Not too bad overall, but the malt character, particularly in the aroma, didn't work for me."
"Taste, a little sweeter than expected, seems like a hodgepodge style of a bock and an ale. Good sour feel. Not much for hops. Malt bill was a little thinner than the appearance, nothing discernable changes downbottle, expensive for what it is. Meh."
"I am not a fan of this. It reminds me of a bad bottle of Fat Tire. Nothing here to recommend."
"D - This is a solid nut brown ale. It doesn't bring a potent hop bite, but I don't think this style should. It is a very quaffable brown ale."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my standard shaker glass. I'm digging the shape of the label, quite unique. The brown ale appears a clear chestnut brown color with about an inch of ecru foam. Nose and flavor consist of medium toasted grain, hazelnuts, walnuts, caramelized malt, toasted bread, earthy hops. A bit thin bodied with ample carbonation. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: Average at best. A relatively lighter, easy-drinking brown ale with it's biggest fault being the fact it's just so timid, so ho-hum. I'd shout an enthusiastic, inspiriting ""BRING IT"" to Santa Fe's Nut Brown Ale, but it would probably either faint or crap its pants. Tsk tsk!"
"D- Good, sweet drinker without anything offensive"
"Poured a dark brown with a decent head that faded quickly. Did not smell right, kind of musty and smelled well....a little bit like urine. This had a sweet tangy metallic flavor that did not settle well. I noticed that there were crystals and gunk all under the cap and around the top of the bottle. Probably shouldn't had tried it after I saw this. Had to dump this one out. Maybe it was a bad bottle."
"A dark brown pour finishes off with a huge tan head. Some garnet hues skirt the edges. Retention is good, but there's not much in the way of lacing. Smells of stale nuts mixed in with some hops and pine. A certain mustiness pervades the aroma. Tastes of slightly toasted malts, sour apples, roasted nuts and some hops way in the back. Body is a little thinned out and watery, as is typical with this style. Not digging on this one."
"Notes - This one had potential, but the sour, coppery taste is not good, and the mouthfeel isn't doing it for me either. I'm not planning on buying this again."
"Pour Medium Dark Brown color, 1 finger head that was light brown. Getting just a little bit of a nut aroma but not much. Taste is just a bit nutty again, but has a stronger metallic taste than anything, and oddly enough kinda of tart or sour taste going on. pretty light even for a brown ale. light mouthfeel. this is just okay, nothing special at all, probably the worst brown ale i have tried actually. this is only my second offering from santa fe, but neither were impressive."
"Drinkability: Blek. Not much good about this one. Just, pretty bland, pretty sour, pretty broken. Maybe a fresh bottle would be better, and perhaps this one was bad, but still."
"The mouth was not too thin but was far from substantial. Still this is a great beer to have while you are in or around the Santa Fe area, especially at the Ski resorts during a mid afternoon break."
"Flavor is a big letdown on this one. Thin and watery with almost an almond extract flavor. Goes down easy enough, but is a pretty unexciting beer from an already basic beer style. Bitterness is there, toastiness is there but it is lacking on roastiness and sweet malty flavor. Also could use more body."
"this brew pours up a dark brown color with a nice foamy tan head. the nose is faint metallic malts and a lil bit of booze. the taste is subtle dry chocolate malts and slight chewy malts in the finish (which I do enjoy in my Nut Brown Ales). light bodied, low carbo, a clean finish. Kinda boring but decent nonetheless."
"I can drink them, and I'm sure I'll put some more down in the future (it's pretty cheap here!), but I'd probably go for a sierra blanca nut brown or something a bit stronger if I had the choice."
"Small beige head. Cloudy dark coffee brown color. Aroma is light, buttery caramel sweet, almost like a candy bar. Taste is also light, chocolate toffee, caramel and hazelnut. Somewhat watery. Med light body. Slightly toasty finish. Alcohol slightly warming."
"Drinkability is ok. This is pretty bland. Almost like a dark beer flavored soda water. It's not awful, but I'll pass on this next time."
"Overall I didn't really like this beer. Unbalanced. The malts were far too overpowering for me to really enjoy this brew."
"i had this in taos, new mexico over the holidays and really enjoyed it. had a great dark brown color, descent head, and great taste. maybe the mouthfeel was a little thin, but not much. drinkability was also pretty descent with this brew. i would for sure give this beer a try if you get the chance."
"A deep reddish brown hue a thick head but dissolves quickly. The aroma is malty earthy caramel with nutty hints. The tastes is a nice nutty roasted malty taste with a smooth finish. Very east to drink but I thought it was a bit thin. Will drink again"
"Bottle thanks to mmm///beer. My first brew form New Mexico. Pours a dark ruby hue with a small white head that goes down to nothing. The aroma is full of sweet malts and fruit. The taste really reminds me Rogue Hazel Nut Brown Nectar; smooth and rich malts, some chocolate, a ton of fruit and nutty flavors, almost akin to grapes. Really smooth and nice. I enjoyed this one."
"D. A damn fine brew with more flavors as you drink."
"This brew has a delicious smell of peanut brittle and roasted malts. Pours to a deep metallic brown with a huge foamy head. This one pours like a TV beer. Taste is a deep bitterness balanced with a very roasted malt. The finish is slightly bitter. The mouthfeel has way too much carbonation and detracts from the smoothness of the flavor. Upon the start of the review this beer appeared to have great potential, but fell short."
"Reviewing the hometown brewery at last! Off the tap this beer was a dark brown with a sandy-colored tan head. The retention was not much to speak of, nor was there much lacing. The aroma was a pleasant mix of light hops, malt and nuts. The flavors were muted however, caramel malt, roasted malt and some nuttiness but all of them too subtle. The hops presence is also lacking. The mouthfeel was ok but could have been a bit heavier in body. Hate to hate on the hometown but I know that crew does better than this."
"D: Easy to mash. Were it only available more."
"This beer poured quite a bit darker than I was expecting. It looked more like a porter than a brown, almost! Modest head, the smell was sweet and maybe somewhat butterscotchy. It was flavorful and packed much more off a punch than I anticipated. Noticeable hop presence. Brown's should be a little more subtle in my opinion, but not bad."
"D- This beer has no offensive flavors just no real flavor at all even when it warms quite a bit."
"Another good showing from Santa Fe, something you can have a couple of while sitting outside at night with your friends."
"D - Overall I think this is a pretty average beer nothing about it really got me excited if it had a stronger taste and smell with a little thicker body it would be way better"
"Pours a pretty dark brown with a thin tan head. Nose is sweet and nutty but leans more towards the nutty side at first. Then it switches to a earthy tone, though the sweet still remains. Flavor carries a sweet nutty tone as well. Not overly complex or severely robust, but it's noticeable and nice enough. The carbonation here really attacks my mouth in a way that makes it a bit unpleasant. It's almost like a carbonation aftertaste. Liquid is standard. Overall a nice nut brown ale. The carbonation is the only thing that is off."
"Santa Fe Nut Brown Ale is lazy beer. It's a lackluster version that could stand an infusion of just about everything. More malt (especially) and more hops would be great places to start. Bottom line: forgettable."
"D - Reminds of New Castle but not quite as good"
"D: nice, easy drinking brown ale. decent, but nothing spectacular."
"All in all, this is very easy to drink and I could consume many in a session, but I wouldn't."
"This is the most uninspired brown ale I've had to date. It's drinkable for all the wrong reasons, none of the right. If you like watered down one trick flavors this is your beer."
"Drinkability: It was an easy enough beer to drink, but it was just an average experience. This is not necessarily something that I will look to go back to again."
"This is drinkable enough and a decent session beer, but there are better Brown Ales out there."
"I discharged the contents of the bottle into a large wine glass producing a small dirty white head. There was some lacing as the glass emptied but not much. Dark brown chocolate color and smelled extremely yeasty with very small hint of almonds. Nothing jumped out at me as far as the taste goes some roasted maltyness but other than that noting too extraordinary. Easy drinking beer and could easily empty a few bottles of this in one sitting."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Chimay chalice. Pours a dark brown with a creamy white head that melts into a thin layer after a few seconds. Aroma is slightly nutty (duh) and then goes into a sweet malty aroma. Taste is slightly chocolaty with nuts, and cream. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation. This is an extremely sessionable brown ale."
"Sante fe nut brown ale isn't anything amazing but that is what makes it so drinkable. Its smooth and not too malty or overly bitter. This is a middle of the road beer that is mild enough for the most novice of drinkers but also interesting enough to keep beer savants into it."
"Update 11-7-10: Nose is different, almost a metallic nutty hop flower with malt base. Malts have a chocolate slant. Hopping used results in a nice dry finish. Nice beer for a Sunday afternoon after having too many at the Coyotes-Pens game last night!"
"Pours quite dark brown with a fairly healthy head that settles to a ring. Very roasty smelling- a bit more than usual even for those brown ales that have that characteristic. Some sweet malt in the background as well. Tastes a little more balanced. The roastiness is there, but there is also a larger hit of sweet malt to even things out a bit, as well as some gentle hops. Fairly robust for a brown, but not extreme by any stretch. Fairly nice. Mouthfeel is fairly creamy and a ttouch sweet without being sticky at all. Drinks nicely, a fairly dsolidd brown ale."
"Tasted on 2/19/08."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was very black and since I ama nut brown nut I was ver hopeful of this new beer. Thetaste was a littlr malty with a nuttiness ever so slightly. The taste was faintly sweet. It was an okay beer but tasted fake to me like not real flavours. I will not buy again."
"I wasn't too impressed with this brown ale, but it was very easy to drink, not that I particularly enjoyed any of it. It just went down rather quickly. So it has that going for itself."
"A fine representation of a nut brown ale, tasty, easy drinking."
"Drinkability: This is a pretty tasty beer. If this beer ever makes it to the midwest, could be a session beer for me."
"Pours a dark red-brown color witha short off-white head that laces the glass a little bit all the way down. It had an aroma of deep roasted malts some faint hoppy bitterness and a hint of nuts. The taste was really good. It had flavors of roasted earthy roasted malts layered with some very faint hops followed by an aftertaste of nuts. The mouthfeel had a nice crisp and smooth feeling with the right amount of carbonation for a beer like this. The drinkability is good as I would definatley have a few of these before the night was over."
"D: Good flavor, low ABV, easy to session."
"Subtle fresh malty smell from a rich dark brown pour with average lasting head. Taste is a nice rich brown taste with very subtle bitterness, a touch of sweetness, and I can actually taste a nice walnut like nuttiness. I really like this beer. Its not too watery or rich, not artificial tasting, and is all around enjoyable and easy drinking. Leaves a subtle pleasant aftertaste."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style. This is a good beer to pound for a while if you’re in the mood for the style."
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a small tan head. Smell is of toasted malt and faintly of brown sugar. Taste is malty and earthy, with hints of coffee. A slightly yeasty character is there as well. There is also a slight sour twang, though nothing offensive. The hops are there but mild (as should be for a brown ale). Mouthfeel is slightly watery, but not bad. Pretty drinkable beer, smooth and refreshing."
"The beer departs the 12-ounce bottle an opaque brown, the head a decent two fingers, tan in color, creamy in texture, as it fades away, the lacing provides a concealing sheet. Nose has a sweet malt aroma, caramel and a hint of Black Walnuts, clean and fresh. Front has a pleasing malt profile, with a touch of hop bitterness at the back, top feels moderate to the palate. Finish has a defined acidity, the hops gentle in their spiciness, very dry, and a drinkable brew, would make a nice session beer."
"flavor is much more of the same, with a creamy mouthfeel and a slightly sticky finish, not too much to detract from the brew."
"12 oz bottle. The beer pours a nice deep brown color with a small coat of head over top that dissipates to islands over top. There is good clarity in this one and very few bubbles seen in the brew. I woulld like a larger head with the aggressive pour I gave it, but otherwise it looks nice. The aroma is solid, with nice caramel and nut coming through behind a fairly solid roasted malt. The roast is a little dominant in this one for a nut brown. The flavor brings more of what I am looking for. There is a decent nuty sweetness with some caramel notes laying below that. What I find interesting is that these flavors really take a long time into the aftertaste to really come through. Initially, this one just comes through as bubbly and neutral. I would like to be hit with more on the start and not have to wait for the finish. Mouthfeel is on the lower end of moderate with a modertae bunch of very fine bubbles attacking my tongue. Not too bad. Overall, this brew is servicable. To me, the flavor really needs to come through stronger initially. It could use a little boost all around I think."
"Pours out a dark hazelnut with constant cascading bubbles and a thick khaki head that leaves some raised rings of lace on the glass. Aroma is a mix of chocolate, walnuts, dried fruits, and just lots of fruity esters in general. Caramel is really big in the nose. I think I get some melon in there as well. The darker malts don't hold much presence in the flavor aside from a fleeting chocolate character in the finish. Mostly, what I taste is a mix of stone fruits and nuts. Maybe a little maple syrup too. Hops quietly appear in the aftertaste. Finishes kind of sweet. Mouthfeel is fulsome and the carbonation is really smooth. Drinkability is just fine. There's not much special about this beer, but it would be good for just when you want a couple."
"Okay. Not highly flavorful. Shows some of those Northern English Brown qualities. Could be more solid."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with no dating info into a pint glass. It was a dark brown color with mahogany highlights. The head was just over 1 finger and tannish. It settled to a collar with a constant carb fountain in the center. The smell was toasted malts with an underlying nuttiness. The taste was above average and had a good nutty bite but was a bit bland. It's not an overwhelmingly flavorful beer but does go down smooth. It would be a good candidate for a session - probably even for your friends who live the macros. (3.5, RB-BOT, T, Y)"
"Pours clear dark-brown with no head and very light lace. The aroma is light, with earth-toned caramel and a hint of metallic sourness. More flavorful than suggested by the smell. Husky grains blend into medium-toasted bread. Finished with burnt toast and hard water notes. Medium to light body is a bit strongly carbonated. Pleasing and drinkable, though not especially outstanding."
"FYI - After revisiting Santa Fe a few times, I have to mention that this beer is much better on tap, actually. I'm not sure what it is, but on draft this beer goes from pretty good, to virtually stellar. Just a heads up for anyone visiting the area. Luckily, this is like the Santa Fe version of Fat Tire. You can find it anywhere and everywhere there."
"Drinks pretty good, not a great brown, but not bad. I've had this before when it wasn't too fresh, I'd say this was an improvement"
"D - Good drinkability. I like the full body and the chocolatey flavor on this one. A little sweet."
"Looks just like what everyone else says...but really when did you last have a brown ale that you took a drink of and thought...hmmm..tasty."
"Pretty average Brown Ale. Seems a little thin and not bursting with any flavor or complexity."
"D- this brew just isn't doing it for me, seems to me, there are just not too many good brown ales out there. I'll pass over this one, unless i could try it fresh from the brewery, until then i'll be just fine."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Overall Impression: British overtones, some enjoyable mild tastes, but the metallic edge and grainy husky notes coupled with the light fizzy texture really didnt float my boat. I would look at water chemistry or exposed metal in the system and drop the mash temp (website lists a high mash temp) to address the husky note. Not trying to play brewer, just trying to give some positive feedback."
"Decent brown ale, quite drinkable."
"The taste is lightly sweet, with a fruity mix of raisin and cherry notes. A sort of nutty malt note is quickly followed by the hint of cheesiness that was found in the aroma, though luckily it is a bit more muted in the flavor. A bit thin on the palate, it keeps it easy drinking, but seems like it could use a bit more richness, especially for a Nut Brown. This beer is riding the line between being good, and not worth trying again. If it picked up a bit more body and got rid of the stale cheesy note I would be happy drink a pint or so of this beer again."
"Just an average brown ale, almost newcastle-like. No real hop presence."
"Pours passable brown amber with a medim-thick head. Body hints slightly at toasted malts and hop profile, while going down in smooth ignomyny."
