The beer pours a hazy brown with thin off-white head that is leaving a lace. The scent has fresh hops that lean towards pine with hints of bitter citrus. The taste is even through the entire drink....there is presence of sweet malt with bitter hops with touches of pine. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall I would try this again and it would be a great fall session beer.","WoodBrew","May 04, 2014"

Smell is of malt, tea, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a slightly better citrus hop presence in the aroma.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 02, 2014"

Bottle conditioning gone wrong, I hope. The amount of sediment in the beer is actually pretty shocking, and it's definitely trub and hop particulate. Very bad- I feel no regrets about pouring this out other than the $1.75 I spent on the bottle. All that and it wasn't even the dark English-style ESB it was advertised as- two shades more caramel and this would definitely be classified as an American IPA. Off for the style and completely undrinkable.","Lawl3ss","May 29, 2013"

3.64,-2.7,3.5,3.75,3.5,4.25,3.5,"O â€“ This is a decent beer. I think it may fit better in the brown ale category, albeit with a few more hops than the usual example (picture a brown IPA). Because of this, its characteristics are kind of out of the ranges of good ESB characteristics. Iâ€™d like to see more sweet caramel and less toasted and nutty malts. This would also lighten the color into a more ESB-appropriate range. Iâ€™d also like to see more earthy and floral hops rather than citrus and pine. Some earthiness was definitely present in the taste but not so much in the aroma. Regardless of all of this, itâ€™s not a bad tasting beer and itâ€™s certainly drinkable. I just think that this beer would be better suited in a different category. I think Grand Teton could make a better beer that would be much better suited for the ESB style.","BlackBelt5112203","Feb 19, 2013"

4.06,8.6,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Medium brown color and is somewhat hazy. Pours with an enormous head. Smell is different than a typical brown ale - chocolate malts present but a hint of sour. Taste incorporates the chocolate malt and the sour smell may be derived from a citrus hop. Mouthfeel is great with fine bubbles that probably contribute to the large head.","Oakenator","Aug 28, 2012"

The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, sweet malt, and nutty. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, nutty, dark chocolate, subtle coffee, and citrus. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I was really quite surprised by this one based on the flavor. There was really a lot going on in this one that I usually donâ€™t find in this style that was a very welcomed change.

3.03,-19,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,"Loved the XX version of this, high hopes for the everyday version. It pours a deep russet-brown topped by a finger of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises toffee, light maple syrup, very light toasted bread, pine, greens, and plenty of cilantro. The taste brings in more of the same, but then finishes with a strong bitter/charry/leather character that malingers for a while and ruins any good that precedes it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta-kinda dry finish. Overall, a decent brew that turns all Hyde on ya. Shame, really.","TMoney2591","Nov 06, 2011"
3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Cloudy brown/mahogony pour with a nice 2 finger tan head. Adequate lacing that remains throughout, very good looking brown. Not an overpowering smell, but notes of carmel, citrus and a mix of malts and hops. Taste is similar to the nose, but a strong fruity initial surge followed off by subtle hops. A good combination of malts and hops with a full body taste. Maybe a bit too strong on the fruity/citrus end. Feels great on the tongue with a decent amount of carbonation. Silky and smooth with a little bite. Overall- A solid ABA with an interesting taste. Good mix of carmel/fruit malts and a little hop bite at the end.

It does leave some rings of lacing behind on the glass. The aroma of the ale features caramel, fresh baked bread, orange peel and spicy hoppy goodness. Medium body, grainy, chocolate, caramel, toasted malt flavor. Sweet, semi dry finish.Awesome session beer....nice way to get away from the run of the mill brown ales that are out there.","GossageBrewery","Oct 28, 2011"

3.92,4.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours out mahogany in color with a light brown head on top. The aroma of this beer is largely hoppy (54 IBUs of Pacific Northwestern hops), but it has some underlying sweet malty tones. The taste of the beer is of roasty biscuity malts, with a splash of hop bitterness towards the end of the drink.

I go for the nutty English browns usually, because the hops that brewers choose for American browns just don't go together; but Grand Teton Brewing pulled it off. For some reason this reminds me of a DFH ale. Very hoppy and experimental without being an IPA.

Now that I've gotten that out of my system, a more serious note: there aren't many American brewers anymore who can grasp the English pub-style ale (and most who do can't often pull it off).

Aroma consists of dry caramelized sugar with nice notes of biscuit. Taste is dominated by a solid malt backbone of dry caramelized sugar with a nice biscuit finish.

3.86,3.2,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D/O: This is an interesting brown ale that serves as Grand Teton's work-horse dark beer. Its combination of qualities give the impression of a blend between an English-style pale ale and a really good American porter. It is full-flavored and obviously well-crafted, but it may struggle to stand out amongst their strong series of seasonal offerings and one-off bottlings.","beagle75","Jun 06, 2011"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4," Biggest flavor right off the bat was a caramel that you caught right up front along with a burnt or roasted wood flavor. Almost had a touch of oaked flavor in it.

Smell had a nice aroma of dark biscuits. Taste had some nice flavors of fig, coffee, chocolate, and dark malt. The problem was that all of the flavors were so subtle. I was expecting a much more hearty presentation of flavor from this bottled format. Was there a bit of oak aging here? I got just a slight taste of it.

2.89,-22.7,4,2.5,3,2.5,3,"For a brown ale this was too bitter, while the malt profile was good, the dryness/bitterness took over as the main flavor.

Flavor is like american brown pushing the limits - in fact, maybe too far. Too me the hop is at least equal to the malt and dominates it in some ways. That crosses it over into some other beer style. Body is good and good carbonation, but the jacked up bitterness is more astringent and pucker in the mouth. Finish is a little on the sharp side, but still overall a great drinking beer. Just a little outside aba. Oh, and the ESB moniker needs to go, not witty or clever at all. Seems to me a cheesy attempt at humor or marketing guy's got to get canned.","drpimento","Nov 21, 2010"

I don't have any problem with hopping up a style that usually doesn't display major hops, but doing so at the expense of the original heart and soul of the beer ends up being a trade off without benefits. If the hops balanced a more with the malts this could be beneficial.","allforbetterbeer","Nov 18, 2010"

Good notes of pine, grapefruit, and some other citrus hops. Light caramel and toffee in the nose. The flavor has a nice hop bouquet along with a bit of light caramel and bread.

4.03,7.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The scent is punctuated by grapefruit and pine hops backed up and balanced by caramel malts. That balance is lost somewhat in the taste with the hops bitterness taking over, but that's what an ESB is all about. It's supposed to be overbalanced in favor of the bitterness, hence the name. I'd pan any other style for that excess, but this seems just about right for the style and will satisfy just about any hophead or bitter bitch.","Naugros","Nov 08, 2010"

The bitterness doesn't fit that well with my perception of ESB, the flavor doesn't fit that well with brown ale. Finally, it is too highly carbonated. These add up to a beer that isn't particularly drinkable, though I'd be happy to sip one again as it definitely deserves further contemplation. My current preference would be for less caramel malt flavor, little lower gravity, less stickiness, lower carb, and if any was used, perhaps less sulfate or whatever is accentuating the hop bitterness - perhaps it is just the hop variety. the current version reminds me of a homebrew we made called "WTF" where we combined many many different things and made a unique, flavorful, but not particularly drinkable, beer.","udubdawg","Jun 03, 2010"

There's a big caramel and biscuit malt backbone. The flavor is rather bitter and a bit surprising. It could use some more malty sweetness to bring out more depth, but it's a mild complaint. If I recall correctly, the XX version had that depth and it was quite successful. The beer has a fairly creamy feel, probably better on tap.

3.82,2.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Hazy dark amber color with a creamy beige head. Aroma is big, I mean like barleywine big. ESB my ass. Smells like caramel and toffee and citrus hops and earth and fruitcake. Flavor is equally robust. Earthy and sweet malts blend with candied orange and grapefruit hops dusted with cocoa powder and lead into a bready, bitter finish. 54 IBUs seems too low for what I'm tasting. Mouthfeel joins every other aspect of this beer in being 'not-to-style,' as the heaviness on the palate detracts from the expected drinkability of an ESB. So does a dose of astringency. I'm pretty perplexed by this beer. On BA it's a Brown Ale (and has won several awards in GABF under that category), and on RB and the label it's an ESB. But it doesn't taste like either. India Brown Ale? Unimperial Barleywine? Whatever. It's pretty good.","illidurit","Jan 27, 2010"

The aroma is of earthy, english hops and a bit of roasted caramel. The taste is nicely balanced - rich maltiness up front and then a bitterness kick at the end. The yeast seems to be American and not English - it imparts a more fruity taste than bready. The carbonation is a bit low, which I prefer with this style. Overall, pretty drinkable and nice American interpretation of the ESB.","DousedInStout","Jan 16, 2010"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Bold and full-bodied on the palate, opening with flavors of coffee, herbal hops, toffee, pine and orange peel. Well-hopped but balanced by a substantial malt backbone.

Smells of floral hops, sweet malt, and slight caramel. Fits the style of an ESB (not quite sure why it is called a Brown on this site?). Mouth feel is smooth and slight creamy with an average carbonation level. It is also fairly bitter. Tastes of pale hops, strong hops, slight roasted malt, slight citrus, and some sweet malt.

The flavor is slightly piney with a bit of sour fruit and a bread like maltiness in the finish. Seems kind of funny to have bitter in the name when the beer isn't really bitter.

Bitch Creek has a bitter hoppy aroma, which smells like Kent Goldings. Along with this is slightly sweet apple aroma from the malts. As for taste, very nice malt backbone, followed by some great mild bitters from the hops. Some apple flavors, but mostly just a well-balance of English hops and crystal malts.

This ESB is definitely hoppier than a pale ale, and has much better malt background than most IPA's. Furthermore, it pours a dark caramel color with a fluffy two inch head.

4.32,15.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Bright, citrusy, floral, leafy, grassy, piney, and metallic hops leap out at you in Bitch Creek's ESB, almost challenging you to take a sip! There's also some berry-like yeasty fruitiness, and some mild chocolate and dark caramel malt underneath, giving it quite a round and welcoming nose. The body is medium; and it's delicate, median carbonation caresses the tastebuds. The deep chestnut body has a crimson and ruby cast that's reminiscent of old, polished leather furniture; and the creamy tan head holds long enough to make an impression, and then continues to leave walls of spotty lace once it's dropped. Rich, caramelized sugars and a bit of nuttiness dominate the malty side of the flavor; juicy yeasty fruitiness livens it (apples, red berries, prunes, pear); and citrusy, leafy, grassy, mineralish, floral and subtly piney/minty hops round it out with a raspy edge. A bold bitterness anchors it, but there's enough girth to the maltiness that it doesn't appear as "bitter!". It finishes drying as the sweetish and distinctly caramelish maltiness fades, and the piney and resinous hops rise - both softened along the way by a soft, smooth cushion of underlying orange-like citrus. Nice!","NeroFiddled","Feb 13, 2007"

Lots of malt in the taste some caramel and burnt/roasted flavors also with a bit of a watery taste and old stale hop presence in the back ground. Mouth feel like the taste seems thin and watery.

Oh my, I just thought how great this would be on cask! Lordy! Anyway, I sought out this beer because I wanted to cross-off Idaho from my Â“must try a beer from all 50 states list.Â” I did. But this beer is more memorable than that. This is really good! Thank you Bitterbill!","bditty187","Apr 05, 2006"
4.65,24.3,4.5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Taste was similar, nice balance. The citrus cuts the chocolate apart so that the thickness is clean. Remains a bit thin, however that adds to the drinkability. One of my favorites in the region.","Mebuzzard","Apr 03, 2006"

4.2,12.3,4,4,4.5,4,4,"The taste is very well balanced and hits my taste buds just right. Sweet caramel tones in the malt with just a touch of bitterness with the hops. Good stuff!!","Bitterbill","Nov 24, 2005"
3.53,-5.6,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"The carbonation is light, which is expected. Also there was a medium body that blended well. Good beer. I should make a clone of this beer and call it Son of a Bitch.","Oxymoron","Oct 08, 2005"
3.9,4.3,4,4,4,3,4,"Otherwise a good standby beer, with an interesting hop character. Go try it at least once.","beersarang","Sep 04, 2005"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"One inch of dense, tan head leaves lots of small sticky spots. The beer is clear, dark red. Nice. Sweet pruney aroma: tangy, with dark malt. Almost a little barleywine-ish. Tangy and chocolatey in front. Rich, thick, big chocolate malt in the middle with a fruity, bitter chocolate finish. Overall: tasty, with very dark malt and bitter chocolate. But I don't really get the "ESB" out of this (more like a chocolate brown ale).","kbub6f","Aug 31, 2005"
4.33,15.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I gotta admit, I didn't expect a brew quite this good. I'd never sampled anything from this brewery before tonight, and I just had the Sweetgrass IPA followed by this impressive brew. They've left quite the good impression.. Glad my local store is going to have this on stock from now on. Well worth trying if you find it.","hero27","Aug 19, 2005"
4.1,9.6,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This beer pours a brownish red with a tan head. The head fades slowly, leaving thick laces. This beer smells piney. The hop aroma is strong, but not overwhelming. Behind the piney, slightly floral aroma, I detect some caramel malty aromas. This beer does not taste as hoppy as the aroma leads you to believe. It is actually rather malty. The hop flavor is there, but just not the strongest. The blend of hops and malts balance quite nicely. It has slight caramel and toasted malt flavors also. This beer is carbonated quite nicely. It goes down smooth, leaving a sweet, but also hoppy aftertaste. I think this beer would make a great session beer. It is not too high in alcohol, and the flavor is smooth and mild. I am glad that this beer has recently been made available to my area. I will more than likely buy this one again. Try it if you can find it.","OStrungT","Aug 15, 2005"
3.87,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Overall a solid thumbs up....cant wait to try another from this brewer.","DogFood11","Jul 29, 2005"
4.15,11,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Dark, singed amber body with a small, yet persistent, guaze of light brown head. Darker than expected, and looks great. Nose is quite malty, with sticky brown sugar, and a whiff of cotton candy, mixed with toffee. Fresh hop aromas back it up; slightly citrusy, but mostly resinous and herbal. Toasted malt flavors up front. Sweetish toffee makes a fleeting appearance mid-palate, followed by swelling hops. Bitter, herbal, resinous, and slightly minty. Oh, and delicious. Medium bodied, with a minerally to slightly creamy feel. A big ESB in the vein of Belk's. Nice.","alexgash","Jul 18, 2005"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"This Bitch Creek Ale was a pleasant surprise. When poured in the glass, it was an amber color with very little foam. The smell of hops and roasted malts, filled the nose with a very pleasant aroma. The taste of hops and roasted malts was very evident with a hint of a caramel flavor. Like I said, what a pleasant surprise this ale was. Watch out, here I come for a case next purchase.","BeerManDan","Jul 18, 2005"
3.58,-4.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The taste was also predominantly malted though it was complimented but a robust bitterness perfect for a summer afternoon. There was a slight sweetness to the beer but most of the profile was of older, thicker malt flavors. The malt also imparted a slightly sour, astringent you'd get with an amber, and complimented by the bitterness, it had a crisp flavor. Decent beer though, and an odd option in San Francisco.","freed","Jul 17, 2005"
4.08,9.1,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Overall impression: This is a bit bigger than many of the ESBs I have tried before, but it is very well done. Nicely balanced and drinkable - could be dangerous with the relatively high ABV. Definitely worth a try if you can find it!","rowew","Mar 16, 2005"
4,7,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice name. Thanks to kmpitz2 for this one. This one pours a light brown color with a small head that leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly hoppy, as it should be, but I think they used American hops in here. Flavor is right on. Slightly strong bitter with a good malt backing to balance out the flavors. Drinkability is good and the mouthfeel is pretty right on. Good brew.","clvand0","Jan 04, 2005"
4.22,12.8,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"This one was brought back from Idaho on a trip a few months back. The beer pours a slightly rubied brown color, a bit too dark for my liking. Much darker than expected. The nose is mostly grapefruity hop, with some dirty hops playing in the background as well. I think it smells nice. The flavor is a nice burst of citrus hop, followed with a touch of caramel, finishing with a nice bitter kick. I do like it. Wow. A really nice beer. The feel is a little thin, well below a moderate feel to me. Drinkability is awesome. The nice residual bitter that the hop leaves keeps me wanting more and more.","kmpitz2","Dec 31, 2004"
3.62,-3.2,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours to a ruby brown color with a tan head that diminishes to just a ring. The aroma is citrusy and fruity with a sweet malt backbone. The flavor is malty and citrusy with a nice hop bitterness in the finish. It is medium in body, and easy drinking. Better than I was expecting.","BeerBuilder","Nov 25, 2004"
3.36,-10.2,4.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"This beer is NOT a British ESB and to my judgement leans far too heavily on the American hops. It is an interesting beer which I would call an American Brown Ale or an American IPA rather than an ESB.","LarryKemp","Nov 22, 2004"
4.01,7.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"I've been impressed by Grand Teton. Sweetgrass IPA was a good one and I still have Teton Ale (APA) to sample. If things hold true to form, it'll be a keeper as well. Many thanks to Ragsdale for a trio (I'm hoping) of wonderful Idaho beers.","BuckeyeNation","Oct 21, 2004"
3.41,-8.8,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Consumed in October 2004. My girlfriend bought this back for me from Montana. But, she was unaware of my dislike of ESB beers. I'm not sure why I don't like them. I love IPA's and double IPA's and similar bitter beers. But, I have had a few ESB's and usually can barely get them down. Maybe I just need to experiment. It pours very nicely. A deep reddish-brown color and with a big head that just now went away (after about 5 minutes). The lacing is very nice too. You can smell the bitterness. Some piney hops as well. Afraid to try...here it goes...Hmmm, definitely an ESB and it was hard to swallow that first gulp. Definite pine hop taste and HUGE toffee or burnt coffee taste with a dry stout like finish. The aftertaste won't go away. Kinda like that cigar aftertaste, it just lingers. I guess for an ESB it's not too bad. I wouldn't get it again, but will rate it accordingly. Different and if I did like ESB's, I'll bet I would like it.","GClarkage","Oct 19, 2004"
3.15,-15.8,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"One of the guys at Brewers of South Suburbia brought over this bottle to our meeting. Interesting yellow-brown color and a fizzy head. Pretty tasty, actually overhopped for a bitter, but at least it's not aggresive not aggresive like an American IPA.","DrunkMcDermott","Sep 01, 2004"
4.25,13.6,4,4,4,4.5,5,"Ruddy garnet hue with a light haze. Burly, two fingered, dogged tan head leaves intricate lace. Notes of orange zest drizzled with pine sap hit the nose at first. Following are gentle wafts of lightly buttery dark toffee and trace plum ester hints. Quite appetizing and well rounded aromawise. Dominant in flavor is a balanced combination of sweet grainy biscuit, juicy ripe tangerine and moderate, citrus pith notes. Dark lovibond caramel malt with a drying, toasty edge surfaces as the beer warms. Mellow red apple like ester add subtle, complementary fruit hints. Dextrinous, with an agreeably creamy, viscous, yet brisk mouthfeel. Apple character augments late and tartens slightly, but this only aids the drinkability and isn't at all obtrusive. Finishes with marmalade and burnt toast hints fading quickly. A delicious brew with both American IPA and traditional ESB elements. Very well crafted, unique, and superbly drinkable, indeed.","marc77","Feb 09, 2004"
