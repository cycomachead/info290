"Overall: Terrific brown ale. I got this in a mixed six and would get a full six pack for sure. The perfect beer for a chilly autumn or winter night."
""
""
""
"Overall - Not awful, just not a stand out. Tends toward the quaffable."

"Overall not a bad pint to be enjoyed with some good BBQ on a Saturday afternoon. It would make an fairly decent session beer on a cool fall afternoon."

"Overall: This is a style I tend to overlook, so I'm glad I picked this beer up. Very good example of the style, although a little more body would have been ideal."

"O: This was one of the 4 original beers offered by Ithaca beer. No outstanding qualities but a solid brown ale. Hard to find on tap but readily available in bottles in the Northeast."
""
""
""
""
"O - A decent nut brown, very easy to drink. The overall flavor is a tad too subtle and the hops are buried by the malt, but it's still a relatively tasty beer."
""
""
""
"notes; like the Dundee this is a nice, simple malty brown from Upstate NY with just a touch of sweetness. Easy drinking."
""
""
"O- I really liked the nutty coffee flavors in this one, probably not for non-coffee drinkers but I enjoyed it"
""
""
"O: I wished that this beer could have been a little heaver, but it is very easy to drink and has some nice flavors."
"well it looks great in a glass but that a about it if you like english brown ales look else this offers little to good drinking beers the last sip taste wonderful but the rest of the beer lacks my wanting to drink so move on and keep looking for some great beers pass on this on"
""
""
""
""
"It's ok. I don't get much nut out of it. I was expecting more of a hazelnut-ey flavor. Not that great, but not bad. I wouldn't get it again but I'm not pissed that it's all I have to drink during this blizzard. Ooga chakka booga filling up space for two hundred fifty words."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This goes down really easy and is pleasant in its unassuming way, but there's no oomph to it, nothing special. Easy to drink and totally inoffensive. A little more body and better head/carbonation would go some ways towards making it an entirely average brew."
""
"overall: great malty toasty taste with a touch of roast, easy to drink, goes down smooth, mine was very flat"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Either I was just in the mood for this type of brew or maybe I'm just more of a fan of this style than most. Nevertheless, I thought this was tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
"Impressive aroma of roasted dark malts, with espresso/coffee tones and even a hint of smoked oak. The flavour isn't as well balanced as I'd hoped, the toasted malt sweetness transitions rather abruptly into a bitter finish, with pleasant nuttiness in the aftertaste.`"
""
""
""
""
""
"overall I'd say it's a weak offering. It's good but lacks complexity and flavor. That being said I'd still drink another. Probably at some chain restaurant."
""
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler, the beer is an auburn-brown coloring with a filmy, yellowish ring of head. Aromas of roasted mocha and hazelnut. Flavors of hazelnut and peanut, blended with a coffee backbone that is dark and bitter. The aftertaste leans more towards the roasted coffee character, with a bit of an Amaretto type presence. Slick, roasted, and slightly bitter finish. Different."
""

""

""

""
""
""
""
"The stale coffee taste kinda ruins this beer. If it didn't have that acidic gas-station coffee twang, it would be damn good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is like a dry stout- medium bodied, a little watery, and nope actually no carbonation. I got a single bottle of this and I won't likely get it again."
""
""
"O - One of the first craft beers I ever loved, so I'll always have a soft spot for this one, no matter how many better beers I try. All biases aside, this is still awesome."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Smell of coffee and dito coffee taste. I also thought that there were some hazelnuts in this beer. Soft sweet."
""
""
"O: pretty good, would purchase again. nothing earth shattering here, but solid beer from a solid brewery"
""
"O: I do like this beer quite a bit from a taste perspective. It's also very drinkable, half the beer is gone in a flash. But, while it is very good... it could have been great."
""

"The dark almost porter-like appearance, along with the hints of coffee on the nose lead you to believe this will be a much heavier and stronger brew than it is. The very thin head should have been a dead give away that this would have a very light mouth feel. Overall it was very malty and I found it to be heavily carbonated. Not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, but nothing to write home about either. There are light notes of chocolate -- primarily in the aftertaste -- but they're easily lost in what is an overwhelmingly grainy and molasses-y flavor."
"Overall: one of my better favorites already when it comes to the brown ale category. I would say my 3rd favorite...might be a go to in almost any occasion, hope you enjoy....Cheers to all!"

"Ithica’s Nut Brown isn’t a bad example of the style at all. Smells great but tastes just bit too tangy for me."
""
"This is a pretty good beer, but for the style the roasty, coffee-like notes are a little intense. It's definitely worth checking out."
"I had this beer on tap in a pint glass. The head on this beer was thin upon initial presentation and didn't really lace at all. With the first sniff of this brown ale I was very excited about the smell of molasses, coffe, and chocolate. I am not going to say that I didn't enjoy this beer but I will tell you from the first smell to the last drop I was left less than fulfilled. It lacked the body to back up the nose. This would be an okay beer to finish a night of drinking."
""
""
""
"O: Smells great but overall just a disappointment"
"O: the nose is quite nice with this brew, but that's where it ends. The taste just doesn't add up, very bland."

"Medium carbonation, fairly short and dry finish. Easy to drink, a nice brown, nothing earth-shattering but very pleasant on a cool fall evening in upstate New York."
"I was certainly impressed with this underrated entry into the brown ale category. It's complex and drinkable, making for one of the best of type available in my childhood stomping grounds of Central New York."
"O: Nice casual beer for the style. Good for a couple."
"O- Certainly not a great brown ale by any means... worth a try for sure, but I've had way better. Nothing impressive here, a decent coffee/nutty taste."
"This beer pours out as a nice looking brown color with a light tan colored head on top. The smell of the beer is slightly sweet and a little nutty. The taste of the beer is a little sweet up front that fades into a subtle toasted dry flavor in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer is nicely carbonated and has a good drinkability to it. Overall this beer is well balanced and is easy enough to drink several in a sitting if you choose too."
"Overall: Disappointing head, but I loved the aroma and flavor, and found it to be very refreshing. Wish I had another bottle."
"SkÅL!"
"D: A tad thin and clean. Not really watery, but at times it feels that it is leaning that direction. Needs more malt backbone – maybe with a nice toasty grain & biscuity flavor. Still it does grow on you and is not bad overall. I really do like the roastiness."
"O - It's a great nut brown. Definitely one worth trying if this is a style you enjoy."
"The Rest: A decent nut brown that suffers from being just a touch too thin which is surprising given all of the malt flavor and aroma in this beer."
"O - Fantastic beer. I'm a stout/porter lover, and this is right up my ally. Nut brown from Ithaca is a beer I will absolutely buy again."
"O- This is a wonderful beer that really captures the nut brown malts and has so much depth that it makes me want to drink more and more. Great session beer and I can't imagine this on cask but I would love to try it. It seems like the bottle was gone before I even realized it."
"O- Not had such a big roasty presence in this style and I dig it"
"Pours a dark brown color with a moderate off-white head and a slight bit of lacing on the way down. Thin collar throughout. The nose brings a bit of lightly-roasted malt plus chocolate and a touch of coffee. The flavor has some brown malt and mild sweetness. Some caramel and a bit of brown sugar. Light chocolate and a bit of a dry roast coming through toward the finish. Actually, a bit too dry for what the flavor had. Medium body with average carbonation. Pretty standard brown; I'd have it again."
"O: A very nice English Brown Ale. Not my favorite style but that doesn't mean this wasn't good. In fact, it was excellent."
"O-This beer starts well but seems to fall flat as you continue to drink it."
"Pours a clear copper with reddish highlights. Thin off-white head, lacking retention. Moderately toasty caramel malty nose. Berry fruity esters very light, in background. Milk chocolate. Moderate bitterness. Caramel nips and toast continue through into palette. Butterscotch background. Short, dry finish. Medium bodied with a moderate/moderate high carbonation."
"The CPJ"
"Pours a thick dark brown, almost black with a 1 inch caramel head, quickly fades, with some residual lace. Smell right off is chocolate, spice, and caramel. Taste is almost coffee like, very nice actually, with a good hoppy after taste. This was very smoothe, somewhat thick but not overally so at all. Its seems very drinkable and I was suprised"
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are for the most part nicely balanced and I like the nuttiness in the beer. The sweetness and roasted flavors are also really nicely balanced."
"Price = $4.00 at The Stag's Head (NYC)"
"Overall, nicely nut brown ale, flavors are all there and balance well together."
"D - I've had this on several occasions and have always had some feelings of ambivalence towards it. But this review has opened up some nice characteristics I haven't noticed before. Ithaca BC likes to put this in many of their sampler packs, and is a fine exhibition of their work. Well done."
"The reveal - Ithaca Nut Brown Ale. I get it, its got nuts and a backbone. Any single ladies would be best to jump on this one. This is a great gateway craft beer."
"D - Nicely drinkable, one of the better English Brown Ales I've encountered!"
"just kinda average. maybe it was better when fresh?"
"very easy to drink and quite sessionable. overall, a pretty average nut brown, the best part of this for me was the aroma."
"D/N- This one has awesome drinkability. Its comparable to Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale, one of my favorites."
"Beer poured a medium brown with a thin tan head. Aroma of dark fruits and coffee. Promising. Taste predominantly sour. Thin in texture with a tinny aftertaste. OK, but not great. The taste never delivered the richness of the aroma. The malts were not as predominant as I had hoped."
"12 oz bottle. Pours brown with foamy, short lived, brown head. Aroma of nuts chocolate malt with hints of bread and molasses. Medium body, slightly crisp, some sore notes. Nutty, dark fruit and brown sugar flavor with some hints of citrusy hops. Medium finish is dominated by chocolate and sweet dark fruit. Some metallic notes throw off the impression at the end. Otherwise tasty (although very average), easy drinking brown."
"**I used a bottle of this for a couple red meat marinades, and worked out well there too.**"
"Drink - I was on the fence with this one, I think it might have a little too much carbonation but it was still a decent beer. Probably worth a try if you haven't tasted it already."
"A great winter drinker."
"This has an amazingly dark pour. I was very aggressive and poured into an Guiness glass. The head dissipated very quickly with a very nice faint lacing. The taste is an amazing dark Chocolate flavor. almost as if someone burnt the chocolate. finishes kinda nutty, but has a distinct coffee aftertaste. I wasn't all that sold on the mouthfeel. seems to have too much carbonation in it. Drinkability is normal. Definatly would be good ham or some other kinda pork product. I didn't allow this beer to have a bitter bottom because i drank the last fourth all together. I did however think it finished VERY well."
"Drinkable enough, but a bit thin and overly carbonated."
"D: Thought this beer had a Dunkel-y sweetness to it, which I don't necessarily look for. But it's a decent fall beer, you could easily drink a few."
"If not for the thinner mouth feel I would say that this beer is mislabeled as a brown ale."
"Overall, it was okay. I wouldn't want to have more than 1 in a sitting and there are other brown ales out there that are a lot better. I'm glad I tried it but probably will not have again once our six pack of it is killed."
"Eric"
"Poured very dark brown with an average light brown head. Aroma of nuts and coco. Taste starts off with some unsweetened chocolate and a bit of earthy hops. Nuttty malt kicks in next. A good deal of hazelnut was noticeable. Solid flavor profile, well balanced, good nut flavor. Nice, creamy mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: Medium to high. This has some weight and ingredients that make it a but heavier, but one goes down very smooth."
"Ithaca has better offerings for sure."
"D - An excellent example of this style. Will definitely buy this one again."
"This Brown has good potential in flavor but the thin body, astringent graininess, and lack of true malt base leaves the beer unnecessairly harsh, roasty, bitter, and bitey."
"Notes: There is a lot of sweetness in this one but for me it just stayed on the good side of cloying."
"Pours a dark opaque colour. Not much head or lacing. Tastes of dark chocolate and nuts, and some coffee. Very nicely mixed. A bit of wateryness, but not much. A bit thin on the body but very easy to drink. It will be purchased again, probably for the fall!"
"D- good brew. Not many profiles out there like this. The biggest advantage for me was that the beer stayed true to it's malty flavors that was expected. I recommend it"
"Off tap at the brewery this beer was a gorgeous garnet color with two fingers of khaki-colored head. The retention was ok and the lacing in thin sheets. The aroma was of nuts, roasted malt and toasted malt. The flavors were similar with a delicious kick of nuts at the end. However, it was very one-sided and pretty watery. A session beer, sure, but not a good one. The mouthfeel was creamy but a bit slick, the body medium/watery and the carbonation medium/low."
"Overall, a decent beer, but not one of my favorites from Ithaca."
"D - easy drinking brew."
"D:"
"I wasn't expecting much from this brew, but I was more than impressed. Considering I have been drinking a lot of Imperial Stouts lately, I am still impressed with this beers strong, complex, and robust flavor. The only other Browns I like are Mikkeller Jackie Brown, Rogue Hazelnut, and Dogfish India Brown. This one is right up there with the best."
"Overall: this fits the case well, as did the Cold Front--warms and reveals texture as the glass drains...nice ale-ish activity at the finish...however, nothing really sets this beer apart from its class or its competition..."
"Especially after Cascazilla, this one is completely unimpressive."
"Dark brown colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is cocoa and nuts.Taste is chocolate,club soda and nuts.The taste is kind of watery and a bit weak.This is a slightly above average beer which probably will not wow anybody.It's probably nice to try once but there is no need to try two."
"It has a thin mouth feel however it is very drinkable. It is smooth on the palate, light in alcohol and very approachable for both a malt and hop lover."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Dogfish Head snifter. This beer pours a pale, translucent brown with a slight beige cap that quickly disappears and leaves just a little bit of lacing. The aroma is a bit of a let down. Honestly is smells watery. There is a slight toasted grain aroma mixed with just a little bit of unsweetened cocoa powder and a hint of cola. Not much nuttiness or bready aspects involved. Really the cocoa powder is the, I use this term loosely, dominant aroma. The flavor is much the same. Unsweetened cocoa powder, just a slight nuttiness, and toasted grains. Due to a rather thin body for the beer, the toasted grains give just a slight astringency to it that's noticeable on the finish. The mouthfeel, as stated before, is rather thin with a medium carbonation. This is an OK nut brown, more on the light brown side of things."
"Drinkability: heady feel makes it hard to pound a few of these in one night"
"This is a good Nut Brown and very easy to drink. It has a nice dark color to it with an off white head. It has a plesant nutty taste with a good aroma to the beer. It sits lightly on the palate and goes down smoothly. I will compare this to Indian Brown Ale by DogFish Head and Nut Brown Ale of RoosterFish brewing. In order I would drink RoosterFish, Indian Brown Ale, then Ithaca. Its a good beer and not to far behind the other two."
"Too burnt for my tastes - though it does have a ""nut"" character. Mediocre."
"Pours a dark brown color with a 1/2 fnger off white head that dissipated quickly with no lacing. Nutty aromas-hazelnut, chestnut with roasted malt and molasses all very sweet. Strong nutty flavor as well with toffee, light roasted malt and some sweet chocolate. Medium carbonation, light bodied there is a syrupy mouthfeel. Solid drinkability, the aromas and flavors match really well enhancing this beer."
"Drinkability- Overall, pretty refreshing and well-balanced."
"Cheers, Dexter. We loved you and will miss you my big brown long eared friend!"
"Drinkability: I really, really like this beer. The malty and roasted flavors make this an excellent drinker with plenty of flavor. I will seek this out again."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite style in the world, but I like what they're doing with this and could easily drink a few, especially in the colder weather, as it seems like a good one for the upcoming fall since I'm now in New York."
"just finishing off this nut brown with the label on upside down for some reason, and thought i should mention it... actually I'll give you points on the appearance for that... but with the dark color, nice highlights, and bit of tan head that's quickly sinking away... the aroma is chocolate roasted goodness, the taste is malty with hint of nut in the dry finish. the mouthfeel is a bit light, but then it's a brown, so good for you. good co2, a pretty good drinker."
"This beer pours a deep brown color and has a nice tight white head that leave a little lacing. It smells like roasted toffey, making you want to take a sip. The taste is pretty good, but the bottle I have may be a little old. It has a firm bitterness to back up the beer with a slight bit of astringency. It has a decent body, and a nice creamy mouthfeel. This is a pretty good beer overall--I would love to try it on tap for sure."
"rich roasted sweet toffee-ish taste with sweet dark chocolaty undertones and a slightly nutty bite. also some notes that resemble the taste of a coke. slightly watery as well. the taste doesnt seem authentic, and doesnt mesh with brew. taste is also not very true to the style and too sweet at times. some breweries would brand this as one of their porters. light in carbonation with a medium body."
" There are better Nut Browns out there, but there are also a lot worse. I would pick this up again if in the mood for the style."
"This beer poured a dark brown with a thin head and lots of visible carbonation. The smell is toasted malt with a definite overtone of nuttiness. The taste starts off with a bit of citrusy hops that give way to some sweet toasted malt with some hazelnuttiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and slippery with a decent amount of carbonation. This is an interesting beer that frequently comes up in my rotation."
"12 ounce bottle, best before dating notched onto the label, but come on, if you only have notches for months and nothing about the friggin' year, what good is that ?!? Pours pretty typical brownish amber, typical dark tan head/ring/minor lace. Mostly some bread and also chocolate in the nose. Pleasant enough, chocolaty brown. Easy going sessioner, worked pretty well in a marinade of some chicken. Enjoyable, balanced brown. I like. Decent beer to turn on some newbies with."
"Dark, red amber glow up to light, light coffee left alone. Decent head retains for most of the session, barely lacing. Aroma is faint, light hazelnut and milk chocolate; really have to dig in to retrieve it. The taste is soft, notes of chocolate, hazelnut, hint of light roast ending with a slight tang. Quite airy and conservative. Mouthfeel and drinkability remain positive due to the straight line this ale walks. Very English and not adventurous but satisfying nonetheless."
"D: THis beer is ok. It feels so light that you could probably drink a lot of them, but there are better brown ales."
"M + D: A little sting on the front before smoothing out slightly with a somewhat oily body. The carbonation doesn't even totally mellow out, though, and continues to have some bite all the way down. I find this to be a pretty pleasant, and very approachable nut brown. Maybe not the best of the nut browns I've had, but a solid choice and one I'd happily go back to without hesitation."
"(rated Mar 6, 2007)"
"Not bad."
"D: Low abv and light bitterness make this easily drinkable."
"Drinkability- I read a few of the recent reviews and I think they were a bit unfair to this brew. It's a nice nutty brown ale that really satisfies what I was looking for. Good drinkable brew that could be above average if it just had a little more body. Thanks again to Adam for his never ending generosity."
"Faint nutty aroma, thin on the palate with just faint caramel and nutty taste. Very weak, did not even finish mine. Disappointing."
"Pours a chocolate brown color, fairly light, small to average tan head that settled into a sparse cap. The aroma is of a light roasted malt, a nice nutty scent, and a hint of smoke. The flavor is of roasted chestnuts, brown bread malt, and a touch of metal and lemon. The feel is rather light and watery for the style, fizzy carbonation, finishes fairly balanced. A nice tasting brown ale, good nut flavors. The appearance and feel are a bit subpar. Overall a decent English Brown Ale, nice nut presence."
"Typical brown ale here... very drinkable and full of nutty goodness. This one seems to be carbonated sufficiently, because I've seen other brown ales having problems with that. It is what it is, a nice session beer that was in the mixed pack but I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to buy on its own."
"Great beer and very nice.I would love this on cask.The abv is great also making this a great session beer."
"D: I'd drink another and regret not drinking this sooner"
"Pours extremely dark for a nut brown, almost opaque. Medium head. Smells sweet and malty with a touch of alcohol. Definitely on the sweet side, but maintains a fair balance. Rich malt flavor with hints of chocolate and caramel. Nuttiness shows up in the finish. What's weird to me is that the alcohol comes through strongly and is somewhat harsh. Not expected from a lower ABV. Would have thought it was nearer 8% or so. Thinnish body, also unexpected when considering the dark appearance. Overall pretty good and drinkable. Worth a try."
"Pours a clear deep ruby red color with 2 fingers of bubbly tan head that settles into 1 finger of creamy tan head and good lacing. Smells of nuts, chocolate, roasted grain, and a hint of citrus. Tastes of molasses, nuts, toffee, chocolate, and roasted grain with a touch of citrusy hops in the finish. Medium in body with good carbonation, sweet, nutty, and roasty with a slight citrus finish. More sweet and less roasty than other nut brown ales, but quite enjoyable and easy to drink with a good balance of flavors."
"Enjoy..."
"Pours a two finger light tan head that fades slowly, leaving some lace. Almost clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Slight nutty nose. Flavor starts malty, nutty and just on the sweet side, brief hops at finish. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Who says you need to be big to bring on the flavor? This beer is more flavorfull than some impy stouts I've had. Good stuff."
"Overall - This particular batch, like I said, was expired last month, although I don't know how much one month's difference will affect the taste. It tastes rather washed down but has lots of potential. Hopefully my next tasting of this beer will be better."
"Recommended!!"
"Drinkability: Maybe not quite to style and tastes a bit like a really nice dunkel, but still a very tasty brew that I really enjoyed drinking"
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a dark brown with copper highlights; not quite opaque, but pretty hard to see through. Quarter inch off-white head thinned into a consistent skim of foam. Generous watery lacing with some spotty adherence. Scent of malt and slightly nutty, but fruity esters are also detectable (reminded me of a belgian-style brew for some reason) in the nose. More flavors of malt; caramel flavoring is now pronounced, with a touch of sweet nutty goodness. Slightly effervescent mouthfeel makes this a very good session brown."
"O- i like the brews that Ithaca has and this is a good buy in my case."
"Had a 2 oz. sample poured from the tap at the brewery into a glass tasting glass (much better than the plastic cups that some breweries use). Pours a medium amber color with a white head which dissipates. Minimal to no lacing. Aroma of hazlenut and roasted barley. Flavor of roasted barley, malt sweetness with the hazlenut and hop flavors coming through in the finish. Medium-bodied mouthfeel and a slight malt sweetness lead to a decent drinkability."
"Pours a brown color with a a short light caramel colored head. The aroma is of sweet caramel and some nut flavors. The taste is just that. A sweet malty base with tones of caramel and some nice nut flavoring. It is has a nice smooth feel and it isn't over or under carbonated. I could drink alot of these if I were so inclined which makes this beer pretty drinkable."
"Pours a clear but very dark ruby with no head. Nose is subdued. Just barely a touch of nut, but not much else really going on. Flavor is nutty, but oddly sweet at the same time. There isnt much going on with that either. Unfortunately. Feel is kind of thick with a slight syrupy feel. When it first hit my mouth, my genera; reaction was - ick. Drinkable I guess. Could be sessionable. But overall it is pretty boring and leaves a bit to be desired."
"I think this is the beer I liked most out of my 12 pack, but definitely nothing to make me pick up that sampler again."
"D - The low alcohol and low hop bitterness make this easily drinkable. Would go well with a bowl of beef stew in the autumn months."
"D - Very drinkable. With the 5% abv could be a great session beer."
"Excellent, excellent, excelllent english brown ale! Pours a beautiful dark brown color with a thin foamy head. Considerable lacing on the glass. Taste is beautiful, with a chocolate, mocha coffee dominance. Sweet and JUST enough of a bitter kick to it. Can't say enough good things about this one."
"T: If the caramel and nut flavors were stronger in the middle, I'd be ecstatic."
"D--I would not go out of my way to drink this beer, its ok but nothing to write home about. Certainly not a bad beer and worth a try if you are curious."
"Pours well with a deep ruby red color, and a quickly fading tan head. A little lacing on the the side of the glass, but the smell is what really gets me excited about the beer. A delicious malty, nutty aroma, which the flavor can't quite deliver on... Perhaps a little too much bitterness at the end, or not enough hops to balance the malt, maybe a little too much carbonation. However if you breathe deep, it would be easy to drink trying to figure it out."
"A dark brown pepsi type look with average head and lacing . Instant smell of toffee and Worthers candies,nice. Mouthfeel was medium texture but did fizz on my tongue, was expecting more mellowness. Taste was of toffe and coffe a bit of chocolate and sweet but not overwhelming. Solid. Looking forward to more brown ales with summer winding down here in New England."
"A nice dark coffee colored brew with a healthy tan head and average lacing. The smell is wholesome nut brown ale stuff. A little toffee, hint of chocolate. And mostly it's that good old nuttiness that you taste. A very smooth feel with perfect carbonation for the style, refreshing but tastey. I got a touch of bitter finish but not much. This is just a nice, pleasant brown ale, probably a good introduction for the uninitiated, on the sweet side. Very nice."
"DA: This is a good brown ale."
"Cola brown color with just a tint of red around the edges. Tan head that dissapears instantly. No lacing to speak of. Faint cocoa smell and not really anything else. Taste of cocoa, toasted maltyness and a faintly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is kind of thin, also is a little flat on the carbonation side. Nothing special with this one and I wouldn't really recomend it."
"Drinkability possibly one of the most drinkable American brewed Nut Brown ales I've come across the secret of course is hops in my eyes takes the rough edges of these colored malts and blends them perfectly together a delicate hard to pull off style Ithaca has done a great job here go try one and compare it with some of the classic versions ie Brooklyn, Sam Smith's, and for me Wildgoose."
"Part of an Assortment 12-pack (4 different Ithaca brews) I picked-up at the Beer Zoo outside Hershey PA. This was one of the best of the 4, though it was a little bit one-dimensional in the taste. Dark brown color, little carbonation, though decent foam on top (didn't last long). Moderate mouthfeel, smooth with a lot of carmel roasted malt in the nose and in the taste. But that's about it. Like a thick Newcastle. Not a lot of complexity. Drinkable, however. I could enjoy this again. And I guess I will. I have the rest of the 12 pack to drink."
"This is an easily consumed ale. Very flavorful and aromatic--a beautiful brown."
"Deep brown with a very small tight cream head that is gone quickly leaving very lasting lace. Clear enough that you can see through it (with some light, eh?). Smells sweetly of caramel but more sweet than really overbearing caramel. Yeah. Tastes, well. Sweet and caramel but not like caramel... There's a lot of other stuff going on in there. Roasted flavors - but none of the burnt business and way light on chocolate or coffee. Maybe just the bit of a tang of cascades as you're starting to swallow but the finish is all that roasty sweetness. Sorry if I give it low drinkability - it just seems a little off to me. I mean... I mean... That little tang (and the aftertaste) are a bit weird. And, oddly, it seems sweet without much body. Of course, the perception of sweetness could well just be hops..."
"D- It's nice to know that a beer can be this nutty. It's not all that nice to drink more than one beer which is this nutty. If the carbination issue was fixed I would enjoy this brew much more right now its more like an Almond Joy Corona."
"I've brought this beer to a few gatherings and all the people that have tried it have enjoyed it."
"Pours a nice clean/clear brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, not much sticky lacing at all. The nose is malty, with some toffee/caramel. The taste is malty, nice touch of toffee/caramel, slight bitterness/dryness in the finish. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little brown ale, glad to have had a chance to try it."
"Thanks to beertruth for this bottle."
"drinkability - Real nutty taste, nice sweet malt, I liked that. Would purchase this again."
"Drinkability - Definetly a worthy Brown Ale, and I one I can say I very much enjoyed despite not being the style's biggest fan (I'm coming around though). Prob a bit too sweet, but better than ending up on the other end of the spectrum. I'll give this the thumbs up and recco it if you're looking for a good Brown brew."
"Ithaca Nut Brown Pours a deep red/brown with a wispy head. Aroma is grainy, almost sour and slightly astringent Taste is sweet lightly toasted malts with a rounded bitterness. Some nutty flavor as well, but that might be just because of the suggestion. Not bad overall."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Easily the best part of the beer, goes down nice and smooth with a good level of carbonation. I could easily drink a few of these."
"With the exception of some brew pub browns, this is one of the best I have had. It isn't my favorite style but this one is good. This came in a mixed 12 pack but I would almost by it on it's own."
"Medium thickness, quite dry for a brown. Nice feel; not too thick or bitter. Smooth and even a bit buttery. A solid brown, strong but not too much. Healthy, ""meaty"" ... but drinkable."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with no freshness date to be found. No real head retention but it had a decent tan off-white color when it first was poured. No real lacing present. Smells of roasted malts and a slight chocolate scent in the back ground. Hints of toffee sweetness and maybe some caramel tones. The taste is smooth and malty with a sweet caramel aftertaste. The flavor had a touch of roasted malt flavor. Some chocolate tones were detected. Not a very full bodied beer, I found it to be rather thin. It is smooth and drinkable no real outstanding notes. It was enjoyable but not my favorite brown ale."
"Soda pop Sweet brown, not my type of beer. Above average carbonation. Tiny wisp of a head. Nutty aroma. They advertise, and I get only a minimum of:chocolate malt, caramel malt, and four other malts , and hints of coffee. Northdown and Fuggles hops, but I do not get much hops."
"Also was a bit lighter on the tounge that most porters. Very drinkable, great with flame cooked meat."
"Its also a beer that can compliment a nice grilled steak  which is always a plus."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, excellent representation of style, this is easily the second best beer in Ithaca’s mix 12-pack behind Cascazilla and one of the better beers that I’ve had in the style."
"Overall, a good brown ale; not the best, but good nonetheless. Also nice that it is from NYS."
"Had this on tap at Red's in Seneca Falls. This is definitely a brown ale you have to try. Pours a dark mahogany with a thick off-white head. Smells of chocolate, coffee, and nuts all mixed into one. The taste of this delightful brew is of carmel with strong malt character. I'm not normally one for malty beers, but the drinkability is amazing with how smooth it flows down your throat. Surprisingly it is quite refreshing as well."
"On tap at Mammoser's here in Hamburg,poured a medium chesnut brown with a tight but thinner slight off white head.Mild aromas a touch of roastiness and hints of cocoa mainly,basic brown flavors somewhat roasted with a faint cocoa flavor that lingers nicely fo a bit and rather food friendly it went well with some bbq grilled wings.A basic but flavorful brown ale and it warmed me up a bit wich is always a plus."
"Bottle from a 12pk sampler picked up at Wegmans in Syracuse. Medium gold brown brew with an off white head. Aroma off sweet malt, and plummy fruit. Taste is nice and balanced, with malt flavors, plum, apricot, and lightly floral hops bringing up the rear. Nice medium body, with a slightly sweet finish. Well made and a solid brew."
"Nice beer with good drinkability. Nothing out of the ordinary."
"This is an easy drinking beer with tasty toasted and cocoa flavors. Amora of light chocolate malts and grain. Just a good, quality English brown. Nothing amazing, but a great session beer. Sure beats the pants off of Newcastle. If you're really into the syle, give it a try, otherwise dont worry."
"As for drinkability: it's not a bad brown ale at all. The nice finish and sweet malt flavors save it from its watery thinness, but as a fairly light-bodied beer, I think it's pretty drinkable overall."
"Drinkability is high. Crisp taste. Goes down easy. I could drink a bunch of these."
"A little more carbonation than I would like to see for an English Brown. Light to medium-bodied. This would make a pretty good session beer, nice flavor and drinkability."
"Seems like a well done version and one of the better nut browns that I've tried. Pretty easy to toss a few of these back."
"Comments: I truly enjoed this, my first sample of Ithaca's lineup. Very full flavored without being too heavy or cloying. Very nicely balanced. Look out for this brown ale. Its worth it!"
"Artificial tasting; offensive at times, but mostly just an uninteresting version of the style. An average offering not worth another try."
"D: Drinkable Nut Brown, but a bit too ordinary. Not many things stood out on this one for me, but still worth a try."
"Drinkability: overall an above average beer, but not one I thought I could quaff all day."
"The mouth is just thick enough and the carbonation is a bit high. Mildly sessionable brown ale."
"Very drinkable. Because this brew is so dry, you are forced to quickly take your next sip. It's going down fast and furious."
"Nice dark brown color, thin head that holds on just barely throghout. You can see and hear the high level of carbonation when you pour - lot's of bubbles. Smells earthy and nutty; very satisfying. Surprisingly smooth, with a nice hop/malt balance, but tastes almost a little syrupy. A few other reviews wondered if the nut flavor was natural, and I do too. Stays sweet on the tongue and the nut flavor lingers, leading me to believe that it's an extract. A little too sweet and too much carbonation for my taste, but not bad. <I'm editing my score down a bit because the more I drink this beer, the less I like it...and I only bought a 6 pack>"
"This pours a dark brown with a smallish white head that's gone quickly. The smell has coffee aroma that's almost like a porter. The taste has a creamy coffee flavor that's very strong.. Yet I wonder how natural the flavors are? The m/f is light and the flavors are well mixed. This is a decent brown ale,but the strong flavors make it hard to have more than one at a time."
"not a bad looking beer, crystal clear brown ale with nice white head that is there for the entire beer. Malty taste, some chocolate, nice taste. Nothing amazin or actually very good but thisis a nice drinkable beer. I wouldn't be dissapointed if I had t drink this in a bar."
"Had this at a real nice resturant/bar in Newark NY My frst impression was the weak head how ever once getting a wif of this ale i couldnt help but think of deep rich wanut trees. The lacking mouthfeel was more than made up for in flavor however I was hoping the whole time this was naturally produced flavor and not from extract. Nice brew worth another one just for the smell."
"As nut browns go I feel this is on top of the list. With most of the Nuttys I have had this one is not to seet and has great mouthfeel. It is actually one of the smoothest beers i have ever had. Dont know if I could sit down and drink a lot of them in one sitting but still very very good."
" It's very drinkable; not so watery that the flavor seems muted or diminished, but its easy going enough for two back to back in a short period of time. It's good drinking, and while I like this beer, I doubt my brown ale-loving friends would enjoy it, as it would be too roasted malt for them. I like it for what it is, but it fails as a 'classic' brown, which to me, succeeds when it lets no one malt type dominates the flavor or aftertaste this noticeably. Otherwise, ignore the name and down a few of a tasty brew."
"This is a good beer. Nice subtle smokiness behind a nice malt start. Mouthfeel is good for a bottled beer, and this one is very drinkable. Ithaca stuff has recently been introduced to Litchfield County, CT--so far this one and the Apricot Wheat are my faves. This one is a good version of an English Brown."
"Clear ruby-chestnut colo with a beige retiring head. Inviting aroma of sweet toasted malt and some hops. flavor is surprisingly smokey upfront, some toasted malt and resinous powdered cocoa, charred bark, and faint hints of honey and maple syrup. mouthfeel is smooth but somewhat tannic, moderately carbed. Surprised by the smoke in a nut brown, but it's a decent drinkable beer."
"I should preface this by saying that I'm not a big fan of brown ales, and therefore perhaps not the best authority on them. The appearance was my favorite part of this beer -- brilliant, deep, dark, clear brown with some golden highlights at the edge of the glass. Also has a nice head. Very pretty. The nose is huge and grainy, with little complexity -- not very appetizing. Taste is malty and quite sweet, with just a bit of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick and hearty, with lots of frothy carbonation. Quite easy drinking. I would imagine fans of brown ales would like this one."
"Last swigs: Brown ales tend to be boring, IMHO but this one actually has some grainy oatmeal goodness. Tasty but still a brown. Thanks to IthacaBaron for the chance to try this one."
"Feel is smoothly set within a light/medium body with a easy carbonation thats not boastful for a brown. Toastyness is light and paled, nuttyness is touched on with grace and finishes better then it starts. A welcomeing little brown ale. Drinkable and sessionable with an open margin to boredom due to its lack of depth and light flavors."
"This beer was just average for me.Pours a nice brown color. Tan head went away too quick.The beer was a bit too sweet for me. It has a dry finish that left a chalky taste in my mouth. It think this is a personal taste issue with me. Other folks my like this beer,so give it a shot."
"Had this beer on tap at RoguesHarbor in Landsing. Served in a typical pint serving tumbler. When it came to my table, it had a dull off white ,flat head. It was a dark ruby/brown color held up to the light. The head quickly faded and with little fanfare. Not much lacing. It had a nice malt smell, a great start. Not much of a bitter hint to it at all, although not much of a nut flavor (not like a Troegs nut brown) Hops were toned down nicely. It had a delightful semi-creamy mouthfeel and went down way to easy. Although,at this point there wasn't much carbonation left. Don't know if it was the tap system or the brew itself. Overall, I would have another, and am excited to try one out of the bottle this weekend. A nice,yet uneventful product."
"Give it a shot some day"
"Drinkability is medium, but is hindered by the carbonation and is far too sweet to be followed by a second."
"Tasty. The smell is of coffee and chocolate and the head barely makes it to half an inch. It pours a really nice dark brown amber color. The taste is greatttt. I noticed chocolate flavors and nutty malts. Also a little coffee. It is smooth and syrupy while at the same time a tad watery. Im not really picking up the fruityness that the others are but this is really sweet. Anyways in my opinion this is so much better than a Newcastle plus you don't get that nasty English Sewege smell."
"Poured a transparant brown/deep ruby color. Not much head but pretty good lace. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate. Taste is of course roasted malt with coffee and chocolate tones but it also has a ""fruityness"" to it. I can't quite put my finger on it but its very unique. Adds another dimension to what would otherwise be an average brown ale. High carbonation. Leaves a nice roasted aftertaste on the sides of the tongue. Decent drinkability."
"Bender Factor: Another sweet session brew from Ithaca. Interesting that the smell is so complex and the mouth is so intermixed. Perhaps some smoothing out in needed? I truly enjoy their sampler pack now it's available here in the B'lo. Looking forward to a long awaited trip to Ithaca Brewing."
"Boring. Probably good for someone who doesn't like ""dark"" beers. Might be a nice gateway brew."
"Had this brew last evening, actually finished the 6 pack that I got a few weeks ago. The brew poured to a dark brown color with a nice thick off white head that leaves a fair amount of lacing around the top half of the beer glass. The aroma has what I call an earthy tone with highlights of coffee roasted malt and chocolate a pretty nice smelling brew. The tastes seem to be highlighted by chocolate, coffee and caramel that lead to a nutty like flavor. I do not notice much of a hop taste or aroma from this brew. Over all I like it, not a favorite but it is a New York product so I have an interest. I would get this again but it will not be one that I would go out of my way to locate."
"Finger Lakes Nut Brown is a decent dark lager, but as an English brown ale it falls short. One could give it the benefit of the doubt and say that perhaps the brewers were shooting for the light end of the style spectrum, but I'm not inclined to be that generous. While not by a large margin, it's worse than (my) average."
"It may have been affected by travel and storage, but the mouthfeel, carbonation, body, and texture of the beer seem bruised. Dangerously close to (but not actually) syrupy, not enough bubbles, and thin in some unidentifiable sense. I remember enjoying the first bottles of this sixer a lot more than this one. Reminds me of the Czech lagers I had that tried to mimic a roasted ale's tastes. The chocolate does mix VERY well with the cheese, I'll say."
"Pours a coppery brown color with a short-lived beige head. Grassy, nutty and malty aromas with some hints of chocolate-coated hazelnut and brown sugar. Initially sweet, then turning oddly astringent in its malt, maybe it's hops, though not completely detectable. Nuttiness pretty non-existent in its taste. Leafy hoppiness showing up more as it warms. Pretty good, but not the best example of its style."
"First imperial pint glass pours with a 1/2"" beige head, which laces well. Deeply reddish brown brew, with a slightly nutty caramel malt aroma. Taste is similar to the aroma, caramel malts with a slightly nutty aspect, but there is also a slightly sour fruity flavor. Mouthfeel is average, I would want a bit more heartiness of grain in a nut brown. Drinkability is a bit better, with some interesting flavors to catch your fancy, and smooth yet somewhat thin body that lets you enjoy one after another."
"Good malt characteristics, slightly nutty though not overtly. Little to no hops. Pleasant everyday brew, that I wish I had had more of while up in Ithaca for college..."
"Strange that the flavor could be so simple when the aroma was rather complex. A very nice beer that did not blow me away, but one that pleased me. Quaffable."
"Not a stellar brown ale, but I didn't hate it. I had this and their apricot wheat in the same sitting, and I actually liked the wheat ale better. A bit more body would help immensely, with a lower, more english style carbonation."
"This is a middle of the road ut brown. It's not bad, but it had a few flaws that could easily be fixed. The taste was chocolate with a coffee aftertaste. I was slightly bothered by a slight metalic taste.It kind of tasted mediciney. The colour was nice dark brown with a thin tan head that didn't last too long. The smell was of chocolate. I don't feel good drinking it. I feel very uncomfortable with it."
"very dependable brew, but do not expect something mind blowing here. Just a basic brown ale. Color was dark mahogony with an off-white head. Smell was roasted without too much in the way of distinction. Taste had a nutty beginning moving more into a roasted malts taste in the middle with a small hop bite in the finish. Carbonation was a problem here as there was waaaay too much of it considering the style. Good beer to wash down some BBQ with and I did just that."
"The taste is a lot of nutty roasted malt, as you'd expect by the name. It's also got a certain sweetness and a little pear at the end. Hops appear to be an afterthought, but that really adds to this beer's smoothness. Carbonation is just wee bit too much for a malty dog like this one. A very drinkable beer."
"I should note, I've heard this is not nearly as good in the bottle as it is on tap. Since I live 5 minutes from the brewery, I've only ever had this on-tap. I will buy a bottle soon and do another review for that, so that I may address these questions."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with an offwhite head that laces the top of the glass. The nose is of toasted malts and nuts. The taste is good. A nice balance between pale, crystal, and victory malts. There is low hopping and a nice ""brown type"" aftertaste. The beer is medium bodied and is quite drinkable. I'm from this area and drink this beer often. The Nut Brown Ale is one of their best sellers and best tasting beers. It's not the best one of this style, but it's also not the worst."
"Bottom Line: A good core offering from Ithaca Brewing."
"This is a good nut brown that is rather drinkable and would definitly buy again, however I think I was looking for stronger malt flavors and more lacing."
"There's toffee, malt and a little chocolate in the nose. The front is deep and malty toffee. A nice touch of fruit pops up in the middle: plums? There's also lots of chocolate and a little coffee with burnt sugar. The finish is fresh, leaving toasted grains, coffee and chocolate. I really quite like this."
"Notes: Not a bad brown ale, but not entirely inspiring. It's basic to its core, but that's just fine with me. Still tasty and worth a try."
"Had this on a visit to the Finger Lakes.  Overall perception is of chocolate malt and roasted grains.  Deep brown color with very little head.  Not much in the way of hops.  Enjoyable beer."
"A fine example of the brown ale style. Medium-full bodied, rocky tan head."
