"This beer is delicious!  It has a great dark Amber taste and the caramel and oaky flavors really shine through.  It's dark but not too heavy!  Great choice for all seasons!"
""
"Nice rich malt flavor.  Smooth, very tasty brown ale."
""
"O: A solid brown.  Tasty, malty, and simple in the best way possible."

"I'm not a brown ale fan, but this was pertty good."
""
"Overall - this is a great go to brown ale that can easily get possible brown ale fans start drinking brown ales.  Great balanced beer!"
""
""
"Pours clear with a small creamy head, light brown with a reddish tint.  Has a mild malt smell with a hint of honey or molasses in the background.  Has a malt taste with the molasses/honey coming through.  Mild carbonation with a nice finish.  A very good brown ale with quite a lot of depth."
""
"Really a fantastic brown.  Much more dynamic and drinkable than most reds and browns.  Bell's is up there in quality in the craft scene."

"Love Bell's. Not the biggest brown ale fan, admittedly. Open minded I like to think! Poured from a pint can into a pint glass. Can was dated, but I couldn't read it. Sweet ass owl on the can. Clear brown with a full finger of tan head. Medium bubbles and good retention. Aromas of bready, rich malts. Mild nose. Pretty clean on the palate. Nutty flavors on the mid-palate, bready note on the end. No noticeable hops, as advertised. However, this had balance in spades. Mouthfeel was top notch. Extremely smooth. This was by far the best brown ale that I have tried. In terms of browns, this was excellent."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is a damn good brown ale!  Great balance between malt and sweetness and hops.  Iâ€™d certainly get it again!"
"Basic brown ale ok drinking beer"
""
""
""
"A well balanced beer. Has a nice level of toastiness balanced with some hops."
""
""
"This is a great brown for any time, and it will go good with any food. My sample was fully four months old and it is just fine. I think I had this before as I remember it being exactly the same. Great quality stuff that is very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I don't know why my review is an outlier. Smooth, fragrant ale. Strong hops. Pleasant brown ale."
""
""
""
"My favourite brown. Richly malty, but surprisingly bitter. Like most Bell's beers, very well balanced."

"O - A good beer to tip back over a cold afternoon in fall, this is a decent, subtle take on the English brown."
""
""
"O - very good brown ale.  Not quite as good as Smuttynose Old Brown Dog IMO"

"Overall, my second try at Bell's and I was impressed.  Great quality in a bottle, and as I said earlier, good brown ales, need no additional flavorings."
""
""
"O: Easy-drinking, crowd-pleasing brown. Not the best I've had of the style, but a solid entry."
""
""
"Very pleasant and balanced Brown Ale, quite faithful to the English style, with controlled hop addition. Nice drinkability as well."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Typical Brown Ale.  Very drinkable and a definite drink again."
""
""
""
""

"Overall- this is an average ale for me, Bell's is usually killing every beer style they try but this was average to me."
"Overall: Not as sweet as I expected, coming from the aroma. The aroma gives off very sweet scent, and you think you're in for a very deep, roasty sweet flavor. I was surprised to see the hop flavor upfront like it is. nonetheless, it's a great beer, just not what I had expected."
"A wonderfully done example of the style.  Very drinkable but still full of flavor.  Should be a year round for Bells."

"Toasty, nutty malts the whole way through. However, the deep brown body had some floaties/residue at the bottom of my glass. Overall, I'd be happy to have this beer again, but not one of Bell's better brews."

"Bell's Best Brown brewed by  Bell's Brewery, Inc with an ABV of 5.80% This brew pours out a brown color with a nice off white head.  The brew has the look of root beer. Best Brown is filtered brew you can see though it. There is a lot going on in the smell of this brew. You pick up on rich spices and malts, also some sweetness in this brew. The taste is rich with hops and grains, but it has a nice balance to it.  There is nothing overpowering in the taste of this brew. The mouthfeel is bold with flavor with a clean smooth finish.  Overall I'm giving this brew a  4.25 out of 5.  This was better than what I expecting. I would buy this brew again."
"  Overall a 4.25 for Bell's Best Brown - Bell's Brewery, Inc. I'll probably pick this brew up again."

"O: I'm surprised by how much I like this. Some of the finest malty notes I've ever had, and well-integrated hops, which feels a little ridiculous saying for a brown ale. Small things were a letdown, such as the head and soap on the nose, but still a very enjoyable and even sessionable brown. I'll be revisiting it this season."
"Pours a medium brown with a slight 1/2 inch head that dissipates to just a thin layer very quickly after pouring.  Smell is sweet with a robust hint of malt and a slight hint of chocolate and grape.  Taste is a little sweet, slightly bitter, with a subtle chocolate aftertaste.  Dry finish.  Very solid brown ale.  Perfect for fall and winter."

"Overall - excellent brown ale with an earthy feel and taste. Very easy drinking beer that you can enjoy a few of. A perfect compliment to a cool fall evening."
""
"O - Probably the best Brown I have had, no pun intended.  Bells kills it once again!"
""
""
"Muddy brownish copper. The nose has notes of malt and bread. The flavor follows the nose for the most part. The finish has a nice dry bitterness to it."

""
""
"solid head sticks around for a few quaffs. hazy, light brown color. floral hop aroma mixes with roasted malt/caramel/maybe a little milk chocolate. taste is fairly hop-forward for a brown, floral up front, caramel malt, a little choc. light-slightly medium body. drinks easy. love this one, know its obvious...but another great fall weather camp fire brew."
""
""
""
""
""
"A very tastey fall beer...again bells wins"
""
"Bell's Best Brown pours a deep, translucent brown with auburn highlights and very little head. The nose has a full malty caramel note with a hint of toasted wheat bread; there is, however, an underlying bright floral/citrus quality that keeps the beer from being too one note. The mouthfeel is full and smooth. The taste largely mirrors the smell- notes of toasted bread, caramel, sweet malt, and roastedness. Solid beer and great for fall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Quite soft nose of rich, sticky caramels with a touch of butterscotch, and fresh toast.  Taste is fully toasted, almost roasted malts.  A bit nutty, with dark caramel in the background.  Just a touch of dried floral bittering hops on the finish.  Body leans to the thin side.  Drinkable and enjoyable, but lacking any distinctive quality."

"Bottle from Lazy Dog Macon. Pours hazy reddish brown with a tan head. Aroma of malts, brown sugar, caramel and plums. Tastes of dark fruits, caramel and a mellow hops, with a slight carbonation. Great beer to drink while watching football."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid brown and nice notes of caramel."
"medium carbonation and body."
""
""
"Warm malts and slightly sweeter caramel notes really make a delicious fall beer. Almost no hop taste, which makes the beer very smooth and clean, but a touch bland. Not quite Sammy Smith quality, but a great fall beer that I am always going to be happy to drink."

"I have had this one before. I wanted to give it more time and give it a review. I love that they are now including it in the 16 oz cans. This is a nice brown ale, really the best, no pun of the brown ales I have had. Sweet, but it has enough bitterness in there to balance it out. I love Bell's I have had just about every beer they have made and liked almost all of them. This one is a great beer and worth seeking out. Its reasonably priced and made with quality."

"One of my favorite beers. Medium carbonation and medium body dark beer. I wish this beer wasnt seasonal. Small notes of cocoa characterize the flavor of this dark beer and allow for the caramel flavors to be recongized. Overall a must try for any beer drinker!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent malt character, but the bitterness is a little dominant for my liking."

"O - A solid, straight forward brown from Bell's. Nothing fancy, just a great example of the style. I defiantly like it."

"Pours a pretty dark brown with ruby highlights in color with a a 1-finger beige head that lasts for a while then settles down to a thin head. Decent lacing was seen with each sip that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of sweet maple, malts with a hint of spice. The taste is even better with a toffee and caramel hint as well. Perfect carbonation. Goes down easy with no bitter aftertaste. One of the BETTER brown ales."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The only thing wrong with this beer is that is seasonal it comes out in the fall and is gone by the beginning of winter. From the smell to the taste I can't find anything wrong with this beer. It has the perfect hint of coacoa and open up your taste buds enough and you get the caramel. I've also had it out of the mini keg but still prefer the bottle."

"Overall: Another great, high quality beer from Bell's, who are probably my favorite brewery at this point. So I might just be biased. With Sierra Nevada's Tumbler being discontinued, this might become my go to fall seasonal beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I do not like this beer. It seems to have taken the brown ale tradition and forced it down the American Ale Cascade hop road to attempt to make it taste like many of the woefully unbalanced American Craft beers out there that favor bitter over balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This may not be the most exciting Bell's offering, and I blame that on everyone's love of big styles of beer. This is quite the offering for the autumn seasons, made for a crisp autumn evening with friends and loved ones."
""
"Nice amber brown hue. Head is minimal and slowly fades. Good carbonation. Amber malt aroma with hints of caramel is inviting. Fairly carbonated and crisp mouthfeel that leaves a lingering tingle on your tongue. There's plenty of amber malt and caramel flavor. A pretty straightforward session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Another fine product from Bell's. It's not the absolute best brown ale I've tasted, but it would not be out of place at any pub in England. I'll be buying more of this one."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pretty straightforward brown ale that does not disappoint!"

"I love this brown ale. It isnt my favorite but a close 2nd and you will understand why if you had koko brown by kona. Simply the best that Bells has to offer. Nice brown color and a nice tan lace. Taste is irresistable only the koko brown hais more of an addictive flavor and i consider best brown and koko brown in the same category. the taste is so similar its uncanny but i love coconut. i want to people to know thiese two beers are almost hand and hand and bells in my area is big. I live in Indiana. not too far from the Michigan line. Kudos, Kudos, Kudos"

"A hazy medium brown. The creamy off white head leaves a thin sheen and nice lacing. Aroma is a sweet malt with a little bit of hops in the background. The taste is very malt forward with a hint of nuttiness and hops. Thinner feel is good with the overall sweetness of the beer. A nice brown ale that doesn't overawe but doesn't disappoint."

"Overall â€“ A rather enjoyable brown ale. It has a nice level of sweetness, hop and roast to make for an easy drinking and tasty brew."
"I don't know if it is truly the best brown but very good and worth getting again."

""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: It's okay, but I would not buy again. I think it's categorized as an English brown, but it's too hoppy for that. The caramel malt and earthy hops do not mesh well in this beer. The ingredients do not complement each other."
""
""
"O: this is a nice beer. I guess you could have it in the warmer or colder months, but I personally would rather have a nice stout or the aforementioned winter solstice. Glad I tried it, but don't imagine I'll be buying six packs of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A fairly typical brown ale: there's nothing wrong with it at all, it's just not very impressive or inspiring to drink. Wouldn't buy it again, most likely."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - one of my favorite Autumn brown ales. It has everything needed to give you a nice warming experience when the days start getting shorter and the nights longer. A real classic brown ale that finds its way to my fridge every Fall."
"O-A pretty good brown ale. The nose is fantastic and well-blended, but the taste could be improved. The earthy notes (nutty, oaky) mix well with the sweetness and is why Brown Ales are so delicious, but this one finished with an uncanny acidic taste. Still pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a pleasant, dependable brown ale. I would have preferred a little more character in the flavor profile. But I'll definitely have it again as it's readily available here in Michigan. This beer should go well with many foods. It struck me that this would be a good session beer, but the ABV is a little high (5.8%) for this."

"Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its flavor and its drinkability. Really what is most remarkable about this beer is how appropriate it is for the season. It is hearty enough in the grain and sweetness to keep you happily sipping as the air starts to cool and the leaves start to change. The aroma was a bit dull, but fit generally well into the big picture of it all. To note the feel was also surprisingly creamy, and this definitely had a good part in why we had such a positive experience with this one. So, go grab a six-pack and share with some close friends, because this guy will hit the spot right about now."

"Overall, not a favorite especially for Bells, maybe my expectations were too high."
""
""
""
""
"O- A good brown ale that fits right in with fall, easy drinking with crisp light roast flavors"
""
"Pours a nice even brown, with a 1 1/2 finger khaki head that sits awhile. Lacing is everywhere as you drink. Lots of roasted caramel up front in the aroma. Some toffee and hints of chocolate are also present. Very sweet nose to this. The taste is also very roasted in nature. The caramel and toffee stick out the most. The feel is light and easy to drink. Maybe a tad to thin but still not bad. This is a great brown ale, one that may be the perfect for the fall."

"UPDATE 1/24/14: Had put away the second bottle in basement storage and forgot about it until recently when I reviewed storage to find brews I had saved for winter. Bottled 1/7/13, so it's now over a year old! Only things about my review I'd change are: the aroma was caramel malty, it had more body and a definite hop presence which mellowed out. Still think it's a c.4.0 brew. Outstanding, but not moreso than a number of NE brews in the same category which I can buy regularly. If I want more Bell's I'll have to go to Pa. or Western N.Y. and probably pay a premium. These I bought in Michigan last June in a mixed six for $1.69 each."

"I had this out of the bottle in South Carolina, after attempting (and failing) the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island. Really just an excellent brown. Smooth mouthfeel with a nutty, burnt caramel flavor. I can't comment on the appearance because I had this straight out of the bottle at night, so I've assumed for the purposes of this review that it probably looks similar to most other browns. Solid after dinner beer."

"O: Overall I was very impressed by this beer. It had a wonderful flavor that made it a pleasure to drink. I do recommend it, and I would obviously drink it again. This brown ale has a bit more bitterness and hop flavor than you'll probably find in most other browns. It is not overdone in this respect, but takes a backseat on the palate after you taste the light caramel and toast flavors."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled 11/14/2012. Pours fairly cloudy brown copper color with a nice 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, light cocoa, brown bread, floral, brown sugar, and light nuttiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance; but are fairly weak. Taste of caramel, toast, cocoa, brown bread, floral, brown sugar, light nuttiness, light pine, and light citrus hops. Lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, cocoa, brown sugar, light pine, and light citrus on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors with a fair amount of robustness; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a good brown ale. Nice balance with fairly robust flavors; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering."

"Brown ales tend to be low on my list, but rating this among other beers in its style I found it to be quite enjoyable. Not something I'd get again, but this is a very good brown ale."
""
"Enjoyed with the man who put Humpty Dumpty back together again (my orthopedic trauma surgeon)! Served from bottle into a flared pilsner. Poured a deep red-orange with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, and dark chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, toasted malt, nutty, nutmeg, and subtle caramel. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. I was really quite intrigued by this one once I smelled the dark chocolate notes in it. However, to my slight disappointment, this note did not carry over into the flavor. Despite this it did not kill the brew at all. This one was rather easy drinking and quite enjoyable. Definitely one of the better browns Iâ€™ve had in awhile as most are hit-and-miss that Iâ€™ve had recently with other flavors infused into them. Worth your time trying without a doubt."
"Had this with lunch at the westwood tavern in schaumburg. Nice transparent brown with good lacing on the pint glass. Smells.of brown sugar and tastes the same. Fairly solid brown ale. Nothing mind blowing. Some nuttiness. Easy drinker. I like a good brown and this is good, but a bit of a let down from a brewery that seems to knock every style they take on out of the park."
"This is an easy drinking brown ale. Yet another great offering by Bell's."

"O: I always enjoy Best Brown whenever it's available. I don't necessarily drink a lot of browns but this is probably one of my favs when I'm in the mood."

"Nothing frilly, just a really well done brown ale. The balance is great - there's no hop smell, but they nicely cancel out the sweetness that could easily be in this beer given the amount of grains they pack in. I think the taste is great, but personally I think it's almost on the verge of a porter in darkness and alcohol content - not quite as light as most of the brown ales I'm used to. Nevertheless, this is a great choice if you're in the mood for a no frills well done brown."
""
""
"Pours brown with a bit of a red hue. Medium head that looks creamy and fades somewhat quickly. Smells sweet like a red ale, cherry amd roasty presence here. Flavor is nutty and smooth, different from the aroma. A bit of chocolate with the nut and a bit of fruit on the finish. Nice easy drinker. Good beer."

"Best brown ale pours a cloudy copper to brown color with a nice cap of creamy foam. The nose is light and grainy, fitting for a brown ale. The aroma that it does produce is a pleasant darkly roasted malt with nutty overtones. The brown malt theme continues on the palate with a creamy smooth malt texture. A slight bitterness provides balance toward the end. This brew has all the makings of good beer."

"12oz bottle, poured into a tulip glass just for the heck of it (this one is a warm up to an imperial stout - why dirty 2 glasses?), pours a rusty brown color topped with a thin, off-white head that recedes quickly leaving a little lacing on the glass. Aromas are malty, brown malt, brown sugar, grain, earthy. Tastes are malty sweetness, brown sugar, burnt caramel, earthy hop, toasted grain. Thin-to-medium mouth-feel, moderate carbonation, finishes with an ample piny bitterness to keep the sweetness in check. Overall, it was just as I remembered: good brown ale, but nothing extraordinary."
""
""
""
""
""
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. Big, fluffy, light khaki head, high retention with soapy lacing. Aroma includes sweet caramel malts and light roasted notes. Taste has a nice caramel sweetness, some walnut and cashew, faint coffee and roast. Crazy drinkable and sessionable. No off flavors at all and very nice."
""
"O: Extremely easy to drink and enjoyable - one of my favorite beers in the style (which is not all that exciting but is always solid). A very nice offering for the winter and one will likely have again when I find it."

"Bells Best Brown pours a dark brown with nice lacing as its consumed. The smell is nutty. The taste has a roasted character and is earthy with, chocolate, caramel and some sweetness. It finishes crisp with the hops adding a citrus element and a bitterness. A good example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""

"O- This was pretty good. I loved it when I first started tasting beers, but now that I'm trying it again, it is just a little too light for my tastes. I would certainly drink it if offered, but I probably won't be buying again."

"Rich nutty and bready flavor with subtle dark fruit. English hop presence to balance. Refreshing and good flavors but a little thin. For being a smaller beer though it has some mild tannic qualities which is nice. Good but not for me."

""
""
"Bell's Best Brown is an awesome beer all-around. This being my first Brown Ale, I didn't know what to expect. I feel like this tastes a good bit like a porter, but it doesn't rely quite as heavily on the coffee/chocolate notes. It's just a big, malty beer. I actually really enjoyed this beer. Not surprising... Bell's knows what they're doing."
""
""
""
"This was a solid Brown Ale. Very flavorful but still sessionable. This beer would pair extremely well with your typical holiday fare like ham or turkey."
""
""
""
"O. Really flavorful. I tend to find brown ales too dull and boring, but this has a real nice flavor to it.."
"O: Overall, it might not be the ""best"" brown ale that is out there, but it's pretty darn good. Buy it and try it."

"Overall - Nothing about this beer really stands out. It's just an average beer. I don't see any need to seek it out, but if you see it around and want to try something different you won't be disappointed. I personally want more sweetness or nuttiness out of a brown ale. 3.5/5"

"Pours a slightly translucent brown/amber with a dark brown head that fades to about one fingers and settles out to almost nothing. Nose is caramel, brown sugar, molasses, burnt sugar and there also seems to be just a hint of piney hops. The taste isn't nearly as malty and heavy as the nose. There are caramel flavors that are immediately overpowered by piney, slightly citrusy hops. Then it fades into a slightly bitter molasses flavor. It fades out with the hops still sitting on the tongue and some slight hints of brown sugar. The mouthfeel is medium with kind of a heavy feel behind it. The carbonation is perfect for this type of brew. I'm usually not too big on a lot of Bell's day-to-day brews except for Two Hearted but this one is actually pretty delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This offering from Bells pours up a ruby red/brown with about a two finger head and minimal lacing. Nose is primarily pine and floral accents. Mouthfeel is pleasing, but not much carbonation. Taste is fairly mild with some malt and coffee flavors, but not much in the way of hops. This is a good beer as you'd expect from Bells, but honestly it is fairly indistinctive. I prefer Samuel Smith's ESB to this."
""
"D - An outstanding world class English Brown ale... This is something that I'll make sure I invest in each fall when it is released... No weaknesses... Very good in all facets and off the charts in terms of mouthfeel... Highly recommended..."
""
"Solid brown ale overall"
""
"O â€“ This is a really nice brown ale. I think the additions of cocoa, caramel, and complementary hops give this beer some nice nuances that not many brown ales have. All the usual toasted and nutty malt flavors are there, plus more. Bellâ€™s doesnâ€™t disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
"overall: I liked this. Don't want to overstate, but it's a little too meh...good but better Brown's out there for sure."
""
""
"The appearance was an inch of head and a dark brown in color. The smell is dark fruits with malts. Nice nose. The taste is an expresso/coffee tongue. The mouthfeel is medium. This is a decent brown. If I was a coffee drinker this offering would be even more attractive to me but since I'm not this is one that I could have again but will not go out of the way to have."

"Bottle to Nonick pint. Solid two finger foam with good lacing. Color reminds me of sweet tea but I poured the whole bottle, cold, so it clouded up a bit. Notes of caramel, maybe toast, and just a very slight bit of hops. Taste is sweet and caramelly. Body is OK, nothing great or bad here, but it does finish smooth. Beer improved significantly as it warmed up"

"Dark amber pour, light medium-fine frothy head. Little smell, a little bread a little nutty. Tastes much the same, very much a generally pleasing ale. I could see how this would be a crowd pleaser. No notable overarching notes on first taste that aren't uncommon for an ale. Great aftertaste though, a little vanilla and oddly a little melon, very smooth."

"Flavor-packed. Forget Newcastle; my notes say, ""This is the shit."""
"Overall, Bell's Brown ale is a switch up from the average English Brown Ale. The carbonation is what threw me off. I guess I am used to the traditional lightly carbonated almost chewy in body brown ales. But, never the less Bell's brown ale is a tasty dark brew."

"Bell's Best Brown pours a very nice mahogany, with plenty of red highlights. The cream colored foam quickly billows up to over three fingers in height before slowly creeping down. The lacing is left behind in sheets, and if the head retention were just a little more impressive the looks would be perfect. The nose has plenty of caramel and toasted nuts, but the spicy/herbal hop aroma is just a little too intense/misplaced. My comments for the flavor profile would be largely the same. Some of the classic flavors from the style are nicely rendered, but the hops (which the website calls ""American", but I would have guessed Fuggles or some other English varietal) are a bit too forward, both in bitterness and intensity of flavor. The body is nice and full, but the carbonation is just a little too bright for a brown ale. Bell's Best Brown is an alright brown ale, but I can't say I was particularly impressed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Pretty good, but nothing that will blow your socks off. It's very drinkable but the higher abv would keep it from being a session type brew. Worth a shot but I wouldn't pick it up again."
""
""
""
"Notes: Maybe IÂ´m a bit condescendingâ€¦ This is all sorts of decent, just not really my thing. Worth having around for a mellow, generic and quality malty offering, just nothing to really keep on the radar."
""
""
""
"-Overall 4.0: Very good ale bordering on excellent. I really like the balanced tastes and the semi-dry finish. This is an excellent session beer and goes great with foods. Recommended."
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I don't think this beer was a fresh as it should have been. The flavors were all subdued and somewhat flat. It was still quite drinkable but I think if it had been fresher it would have been better."
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel: This feels a bit thin but being a brown ale one doesnâ€™t want it too thick and hard to drink."
""
""
""
""

"O: Fits the style well. Good English Brown Ale."

"It has the right balance to make nearly every drinker happy, without the usual blandness of a run-of-the-mill amber ale."

""
""
"Mahogany color, with a very thin white head. Some sparce and spotty lacing. Floral hops come out in the nose. Accompanying that are some sweet malts. Flavors are about the same, but now the hops have an additional citrus to them. Lemons mostly. Smooth palate, medium body"

"It's easy to polish off a few of these with out thinking about it. The Northern Saw-whet Owl on the label is outstanding."

""
""

""

"O - A tad disappointing from what has otherwise been a great experience with this brewery. Could use a bit more caramel to balance off the earthy hop flavour. Still rather drinkable and non-offensive though, just nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mostly dark fruit with bits of coffee bitterness and astringency. It's nice and creamy. The brew isn't so big bodied, but it's very rich."

"O: Not a huge fan of brown ales, but this one is quite nice. I haven't ever had it from the bottle, but I'd probably only want to drink it on-draft if it were up to me."

"A nice beer, but not one that is going to make a brown ale your fav style."

"O-I had this on tap a couple of weeks ago so I thought that I would pick up a 6 pack so I could review it. On tap definitely a 4+ bottled not so much but it is still good"
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium bodied and tries to coat the mouth, leaving a little filminess, which is the only reason I gave it 3.5 instead of 4. More on the sweet side but leaves you a little bitter at the very end."
"Overall: Really enjoyed this one. Not a super sexy style anymore but so well made and tasty. Memorable, for sure, not something I thought Iâ€™d say about a brown ale these days. Another winner from Bellâ€™s."
"Overall - So sessionable at 5.8%, I really enjoy the flavors in this beer. Very flavorful but not heavy at all. There is such a wonderful mineral and hoppy flavor in my mouth between sips, I could easily drink these for an evening and be completely satisfied. Try this, and you may agree that this is the Best Brown ale too."

""
""
"On tap as part of Old Chicago's WBT. Mahogany pour with a persistent half-inch of khaki head that leaves lacing. Light sweetness, nutty and caramel malt nose. Taste is a nice dose of toasted biscuit, nutty malt, light sweetness, creamy, earthy. Nicely balanced and isn't a sweet malt-bomb.. In fact it finishes fairly dry. Creamy, smooth mouthfeel. Tasty, easy drinking."

"Brown in appearance with a nice foam, that is carmel in color. The smell is flat, with a acidic floral tone. This is a rather interesting smell. Mouthfeel is verymuch a brown ale, smooth.

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with decent slightly off white head that laced nicely. Smell is mild, with sweet and roast malts bolstering it with some hops being present.

"Out of single bottle. One of the better brown ales I've tasted. Not like Newcastle but more like a Hobgoblin or Americanized brown with good brown beer taste that works for my palate. Not overpowering, not sweet, but very smooth with a hearty brown ale taste."

"O- Not too much to say about this beer, but sometimes the plain ones can be the most enjoyable to session. Definitely another win for Bell's, although the name doesn't necessarily live up to the execution."

"I had to re do this one because I loved it the second go around."
"Just because this is a brown, doesn't mean it needs to err to middle of the road flavor profiles. Either bump it up, or put something on the taste buds that makes it interesting."
"(reviewed 10/21)"
"O: For a style I really don't enjoy, this is not half bad. I would drink it again."
"Overall, the flavor is good, but that is not this beer's most defining feature. It has super-model looks and divinely fluffy texture. This is as a beer should be, and what makes Bell's one of the best around."
"O â€“ Good stuff, I donâ€™t always drink the brown ales, but this I would rank up there. I think I still prefer Lost Coast Downtown Brown over this, but itâ€™s still really good."
"Overall, Bell's Best is a great easy-drinking brown ale. The style tends to bore me if it's not done properly, but there's enough flavour here to keep things interesting. I would buy this again."
"Overall - Not really that great of a beer. Aroma and flavor both leave a lot to be desired and the carbonation level is a problem for me."
"Medium body, decent carbonation, slightly chewy and dry on the tongue. A drinkable, smooth brown ale with a nice nutty flavor."
"Overall, basic, simple, but enjoyable all around. A good beer to dig into no complaints I could have another anytime."
"This brew poured out as a brown color with some red highlights in it. The head doesn't really do too much for the appearance here. The smell of the beer is a little sweet and just a little bit of roasted grains on the nose. The taste of the beer doesn't give off too much of a nutty flavor, it actually had more of a roasted cinnamon kind of flavor in there I think. The mouthfeel of the beer was decent I though nothing too exciting though. Overall it's not a bad brown ale, but I can't say it's my favorite."
"I've had this beer on cask before, and it was pretty fantastic. From the bottle, it's not too shabby, but nothing to write home about. A standard American brown with some nice malt character in the flavor and aroma, but not too much beyond that. Still, a solid beer."
"Overall / Drinkability: Quite a tasty beer. Simple in flavor profile and very drinkable. I could easily have another. A little weak in aroma, but this is made up for in taste. Went well with chili and cornbread, and I'm sure it would be good with a lot of other food as well, and of course, by itself after the meal."
"O - This is a nice brew, at first was going to say it was a bit watery, but the more I drink the more I like the profile and the balance of the beer, this is one you can definitely have a couple of in a row."
"Overall: A pretty solid brown ale. Well balanced and pretty tasty."
"This beer is well balanced. The subtleties make it complex. There's a good, strong malt character. It's a little sweet at times, but good overall."
"O - A good brown, not sure it is the Best."
"Overall - A pretty solid brown ale. The taste could become a little metallic, and it might have been a little too bitter, but overall, good beverage from Bell's."
"O: Good beer, especially for the season we are currently in. I will gladly pick this beer up again"
"Overall I thought this this was a pretty damn good English Brown Ale. I haven't had a lot of this style but so far this beer seems to be the closest example I have had to a true English Brown Ale. The flavors were nice and malty and had a really nice nutty complexity that really made this beer stick out from the other English Brown Ales I have tried. It went down really smooth and combined with having no bitterness at all makes this beer have some great drinkability, I would have no problem drinking three or four of these in a night. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, it just seemed spot on for an English Brown ale and the extra nuttiness was a very nice added touch. What I liked least about this beer was the color, it wasn't bad, but I would have liked it a little browner, not a big deal though. I buy this beer every fall and will continue to do so since I find that this beer really hits the spot on late fall/ early winter evenings, and it is the best local English Brown Ale I have had. If English Brown Ales are your thing, this is a must try, it does a great job at representing what an English Brown Ale is all about, or so I think. So far this is the best English Brown Ale I have had so far, everything was pretty spot on and the extra nuttiness put this beer over the top. Bell's did a great job with this beer, they do a great job of brewing a style the way it is intended to be, they are a jack of all trades and that is why they are one my favorite brewery's."
"The taste is amazing. For a while brown ales where my favortire style but over the past year or so I haven't been able to find the right one that caught my attention. This is it. The smoothest, rich flavor... Sweet caramel flavors with some biscuity flavors in there too."
"Cheers!"
"Overall this is a good brown, but far from the best. I love the owl on the label, he/she looks ornery as hell. While I did like this beer, it didn't scream out to me, and I honestly expect something with a little more complexity and depth from such an accomplished brewery. Recommended to any Bell's fan or BA new to malty ales. Cheers!"
"I had this one before from a bottle, this serving is from a 16 oz. can. And yes, that can is from the legendary woodychandler. Has a mahogany color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of bready malts, some caramel. Taste is malts, nutty, light hops, very easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"O- It's a decent to slightly above average brown ale for me, but it's not particularly anything I need to revisit."
"Some caramel sweetness tempered with a hop spice. Smooth but thin body. High finely bubbled carbonation. The swallow is a superior blend of bittering hop and toasted malts. One of the finest aftertastes I've ever had. An overall top-notch brown ale."
"O: This is a very solid beer. Consistent, too. As far as style, this is a great representation, smooth, sweet and very sessionable. I've yet to try this with food, but it seems like it could be an outstanding pairing."
"Pours a reddish caramel brown with a white head. The smell isn't too powerful, but is mostly malty with some sweet and nutty notes. The taste follows the smell with the nice malty backbone, some sweetness and a subtle hint of smoke. This one has a nice medium body, and is smoother than most. This is a good brown ale, the flavors are interesting and well done. A nice offering that I would have again, but not seek out regularly."
"O- A very nice brown ale that I'll probably pick up again."
"O: this is a nice and drinkable brown ale. It is rather mild and drinks like a brew that is 4%."
"O: A nice brown overall. I mostly notice how smooth and rich it is. Almost creamy."
"Overall - Not a remarkable beer but I don't that's the goal. A well made balanced brown ale that's adequate if a bit boring."
"O: Looks good. Smells kind of weird, but not bad. I was hoping for a nutty more roasted flavor. Not bad overall."
"O- a good beer. Not as good as I expected coming from Bell's but good none the less. Nothing against this beer but it was nothing special and I honestly don't know if I would buy it again."
"Seems more like a American brown. Perhaps not ""best", but definately unique and at minimum very very good."
"Overall: An excellent session beer. Easy drinking and refreshing with a sweet subtle complexity that makes you want to go back for more."
"Overall: Bell's does not disappoint. Their Brown hits the charts once again."
"o - one of my favorite go-to browns. For the style, immensely drinkable and flavorful."
"O - Not a bad brown ale. It just doesn't have a lot going on, but I guess you could say that about most brown ales."
"O: Excellent brown ale. I"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. Almost mahogany color with a thin, less than one-finger off-white head. Lace was tight and clingy. The nose was well more malty than hoppy, more like bread. Taste was very grassy intially with phenols definitely noticeable. Medium bodied with taste in the back of the mouth with average carbonation. Still waiting to try Hopslam, but this one is not that memorable from Bell's."
"Overall: I like Bell's but this might be my second favorite next to Two Hearted Ale."
"Reviewed from notes taken. Mild scent of malt poured into pint glass 1/8"" head dissipates quickly w/a rich brown color. Well blended malt flavor w/an initial hop flavor in the front, good mouthfeel and decent drinkability. Bell's w/another solid entry w/o being an average kit beer wrapped in a pretty label. I buried Smuttynose for their brown ale, I much prefer the Bell's entry"
"M - Medium carbonation, medium body"
"**I ended up drinking a single from my six pack, and letting the rest sit for 2 months. I can say that there was a big improvement in the taste, which is represented in the score. Much sweeter, with a slight nutiness - caramel, brown sugar, and toffee made this Brown Ale much more balanced and enjoyable."
"O: Pretty decent beer. I dont like to drink more than a couple of these at a time as I move to other more interesting things. There are a couple more Browns that I like better than this."
"O: Pretty good. No off-flavors, just a simple sweet toasted caramel malt flavor. No nuttiness to speak of, this one is more fruity and sweet."
"T- I can dig this, can you dig it?"
"Brown beer that has a beige head that left behind a tiny bit of spots and lace. It smells of caramel and sugar with some raisins or figs or other type of dark fruit. Taste is about the same, and quite pleasant. Really focuses on the brown sugar aspect. Mouthfeel is slightly over carbonated but not bad. This is an above average brown I would drink again"
"hard to go wrong with Bell's. I enjoyed this beer and one of the better browns that I've had."
"Beers of this style don't really stand up and draw attention to themselves. The good ones are meant to be tame, mild, and well-behaved (like this one). This is a great beer to drink on a chilly, rainy afternoon (like this one)."
"Overall - Nice easy drinker with plenty of flavors. Low alcohol adds to drinkibilty. Slighty sweeter then typical english brown ales, but is a great example of the style. Another quailty beer from bells."
"BTW- I skipped using the spoon."
"Overall, it is a pretty nice beer. It does not stand out as amazing, but I'd buy it again."
"O â€“ Almost tastes like too much water was used in the sparge."
"O: Solid English Brown Ale, easy drinking and pretty sessionable. For a style that can be bland, Bells does a good job here."
"light to medium in body. a bit syrupy. almost has a belgian like feel to it. drinkable, but nothing i would come back to."
"Overall- a really fine brown ale, that's very easy to drink. I would have no problem buying this again. Very good."
"Overall, a solid brown ale."
"Overall this is quite drinkable, but forgettable. The flavor profile is just not on par with other brown ales I have had recently. English brown ales aren't supposed to be as malty and full-bodied as American ones, so I guess they accomplished their goal of creating a fairly tasty sessionable brown ale, but I won't be revisiting this anytime soon."
"Overall, a good brown. Maybe not the ""best", but it's a good version."
"I think Bell's did did a stellar job at making a brown ale. I don't know if I'd call this the ""Best Brown"" ale I've ever had, but it's pretty tasty."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied but a little tough to have more than one or two."
"Finish is somewhat dry with hops coming to the fore. A Slightly metallic hint floats by, a la Newcastle Brown, but just in passing. A good, MOR brown. Certainly sessionable."
"D- Enjoyable, and easily could have several of these but there isn't anything to exciting and there are better browns out there."
"Overall a really solid brown ale That has a really unique flavor. Definitely will seek out again if available."
"D: This comes across lighter and hoppier than I expect from a brown ale. I'm not that impressed with the flavor, which is fairly simple and a bit on the bitter side for the style. It's a decent beer, but there are plenty of better brown ales out there."
"This beer appears to be pretty true to the style. Although it may not be the sexiest style to most palates, this beer is a pretty nice representation of what it claims to be."
"Drinking wise, the beer had a smoothness with minimal complexity. ""Your average Brown Ale."""
"D - I had 2 of these in one sitting and it was enough for me. I enjoyed it, but don't know if I'd seek it out again."
"Poured a very dark brown color with lots of creamy tan head on it. Smells like caramel malt with some hops coming through. Taste is pretty good, classic brown ale flavor. Not much aftertaste. Very smooth and drinkable beer overall. Brown ales may not be my favorite style but this one is pretty good as far as they go."
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and silky, and the drinkability is pretty decent. A slightly above average brown ale, I didn't see anything too special here, but there's nothing bad in this brew as well."
"medium body. carbonation is there, but its extremely smooth. quite easy to drink and refreshing for a fall/winter brew."
"D: A little sweet and heavy to be a session brown. However, Bell's got a good take on the style. Bringing lots of caramel, toastiness and sweet sugar in balance with bitterness."
"Overall, a decent session beer, but not something I would purposely seek out."
"This beer pours a deep brown color with a nice creamy beige foam head on the surface. The smell is of sweet malts and a tad bit of chocolate in the background. The taste has many of the same sweet malt flavors to the almost extreme. I've actually had milk stouts that were less sweet than this beer. The chocolate flavors do shine through in a milk chocolate fashion with the sweetness. There is a tinge of bitterness on the back-end but for the most part this beer goes down fairly smooth. The problem I have in drinking it is it's far too sweet for me. It's a good thing my father, who's birthday it was, didn't like the Daisy Cutter I recommended he get, so we switched to each other delight. I respect it, but it's not my favorite Bell's beer."
"While Best Brown is, for some reason, not as popular as the Winter White or Two Hearted over the winter monthsand not even in the ballpark of Oberon, in terms of sales--it remains one of Bell's finest and most consistent offerings and is one of my personal favorites among their lineup."
"D - smooth drinking and perfectly fine; nothing wows me -- would not seek this out, but would not refuse; probably be better for a cooler night and a hearty meal (stupid FL ""winters"")"
"Looks very good. Creamy, patchy, tan/eggshell head. Superbly clear mahogany color. Smell is subdued malts and a tinge of mineral. First taste is toasty malts, then abruptly tankard-tasting. Not what I wanted. The aftertaste is still metallic, with a bit of hops, and bit cool-feeling, creamy, and smooth. Drinkability not as good as that of other brown ales. For a beer that looks (and smells) this good, I am disappointed in the taste."
"D - Very drinkable. I didn't think I'd like this at first, given the weird (for me) thin body and minimal aromas. However, I think this is supposed to be a sessionable, entry-level Brown Ale, and it succeeds at that nicely."
"Honey, sunflower seed aftertaste, husky grain and malt sweetness. Light caramel flavor. Creamy and slightly astringent at times, but not a defining characteristic overall. Easily drinkable, seems well suited for cask serving."
"Verdict: A half-decent Bell's brew. B- (3.4)"
"M/D - Has a good medium body to it, sticks to the tongue and has a semi dry finish. One I could drink several of. Enjoyed this one"
"A smooth sessionable beer despite it coming in at 5.8 ABV."
"Overall: Better than many I've tried but not on par with other Bell's beers as far as ""out of the park"" performance. Given that I have access to both brews; I would choose a NG Fat Squirrel over this for my go-to brown...until something better comes along."
" Due to the balance this beer offers I could be paired with just about any food or meal."
"D- A nice example of the style, easy to drink and return to"
"It might not be the best brown ale ever, but it might be their best, and that's not bad. Every beer of theirs I ever tried was way above average to great. Full of flavor, and no ""off"" flavors or funny aftertastes, this beer is smooth, tasty, and refreshing. I'll buy more of this."
"Drinkability: Drinking this a bit warmer lets the flavors loosen up, and I dispensed of my glass relatively quickly, but I am not sure if I would order this again."
"D: I really enjoyed this. I haven't had a lot of Bell's, but I have yet to be disappointed."
"D - Not the best brown (HAHA!!1) I've ever had, but a solid offering and a great bridge beers for non craft drinkers. A couple friends remarked that it reminded them of Leinenkugels Fireside Nut Brown and Fat Tire. Not quite, but at least they're distinguishing flavors. It's worth noting that this would be an unbelievably easy 6 pack (hell, minkeg with some help) to finish; tasty, great mouthfeel, drinks quickly."
"D: Overall, a very good brown ale, but I wouldn't consider it the best. This one, in my opinion, would be better enjoyed with food rather then by itself. Very easy to drink."
"The flavor is lightly sweet, with caramel, bread, and some nut flavor. Light to medium bodied. Proper carbonation. Has a slightly nutty aftertaste. A good effort from Bell's."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability: Medium body with very light carbonation fairly rich and creamy."
"Bell's appropriately named this beer, excellent example of a brown ale. Highly recommended!"
"Bell's as usual has produced a very good beer that is tasty yet easy to drink."
"This is alright, but not the BEST BROWN I've had. The sediment kind of kills the appearance for me. This is a decent brew, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get this again."
"D: nice session beer, 1st cask beer and it tastes like fresh fruit just picked from the tree. Solid brown ale, not world class, but worth a taste."
"Good beer, not perfect though. Very drinkable."
"D: easy to drink and pleases, not many surprises though."
"D: Yet another great beer from Bell's. Recommended for fans of brown ales and/or good beer. Still, not one of my absolute favourites -- in the future, I will probably give this a miss and pick up another Bell's instead."
"D. A medium body beer that is pretty drinkable and would suggest trying this for those that like this style of beer. However, Michigan Nut Brown Ale is the one I prefer over Bell's Best Brown Ale."
"D- This beer is pretty good. Nothing over the top with this beer which makes it an average brown ale. I don't really care to drink more than a couple of these before moving onto something else. It's bland and muted at times which seems to be a Bell's trait at times. ABV is a little bit held back but still agressive in the middle to ending of the beer."
"very good offering in this genre"
"Pours a dark coppery brown with a slight bit of head that lingers on the edges of the glass. Lots of roasty malt and nutty aromas present. The flavor mirrors the smell, lots of nuttiness and lightly roasted malted flavor, and a bit of yeastiness too. There is a pleasant hop flavor at the end of the taste as well that balances the sweetness out well. The mouthfeel is just right, not too light, not too heavy. Good for sipping, this is a great session beer."
"As for the drinking ability of this beer it is excellent. The beer is smooth, and there is not a lingering taste in between sips. I greatly enjoyed this beer and would recommend others to as well."
"For a 5.8% abv, this beer has a lot going on. Very interesting and very good. Would make for a great fall session."
"D: Hampered by sweetness a bit, otherwise no problems here."
"Overall impression: Not bad at all, but loses points when reviewed as a true English brown ale. Definitely would have scored this higher as an American version, which honestly seems to be a better fit."
"D - Easily one of the best beers I've tasted out of a keg in a long time. The beer falls down your throat. The only bad part about this brew is the empty glass when your finished. I definitely recommend trying this one, you won't be disappointed."
"it is always a fall/ early winter fav, for a cold afternoon when you have a hour or two to kill before dinner, it's heartiness will tide you over till its time to eat and then goes great with any meal. bells has always done right by me, and i wouldnt expect anything other than great from one of my favorite home town breweries this years batch is just as great as years past. thanks Bells."
"Drinkability: The best brown ale I've ever had, which makes the name perfect."
"This is the beer that man would drink. Every day. Forever."
"Beautiful two finger head of light brown medium build bubbles. Lace that goes on for days, just an extension of the head up the side of the glass, cling power city. Color is a hazy 19 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells of caramel, toffee, molasses, citrus, and malt. Tastes of coffee, toffee, caramel, citrus, cinnamon, malt, and molasses. Wow great impact in my mouth, cream and whip cream texture with a nice zing from the carbonation. Oh yes I will have to have another please. Good job Bell's."
"Pours a hazy, light chocolate color with tan head. The nose is pretty standard brown ale but with a mild citrus note in the malt. Medium malt flavor with a textured malt, a little spicing, slightly bitter roast. Finishes with a fading malt bitterness. Medium body, easy to drink, unique light malt with citrus impressions, pear and apple in the background, overall very delicious."
"D - Drinkability is good. It goes down very easy. I would have no problem drinking a few of these in a sitting. This is a good beer, and I recommend trying it."
"Pours down the neck like honey dew vine water."
"The kkipple bottom line: (kkbl) : Recommended, no matter the serving type. The next time you see some sucker toting a 6 pack of NewCastle at your booze-dealer, slap it outta his hand and steer him towards the Bell's Best Brown."
"So how drinkable is this? Well, if you're not a fan of brown ale, Bell's Best probably isn't going to convert you. It's not innovative but it is a very well done representation of the style that I so love. 5.8% ABV make it an unlikely choice for session drinking and the lingering earthy bitterness means that this isn't for everybody. However, I could treat myself to Bell's Best Brown from time to time."
"I am a novice with this sort of delivery system, so I had to a) follow the directions VERY carefully and b) decide on the best pour for it. With regards to b), I tried a straight pour, allowing it to run from the tap into the glass, but I ended up with a massive amount of head, which I kept for myself. I then tried angling the glass and allowing the beer to flow into it without letting it impact the bottom of the glass. Either way, I had a buncha head. Allowing it to settle from its original, light-tan state into something more manageable, I still had a good bit of foam and a lot of sticky lacing to go along with it. The color was more of a ruby-red with NE-quality clarity than a brown, but it still looked enticing. The nose was definitely malty sweet with a bit of maple sugar included in the mix. Mouthfeel was slightly thin but I could tell that it was a sweet brown ale immediately. I am not averse to the style, but after a day of sampling hoppy beers, this really stood out from the pack. Tasty. A steady diet of AALs while furthering The CANQuest (TM) has honed my palate to the point that anything and everything tastes good. The finish had a slight smokiness to it, reminiscent of my PapPap burning leaves in his outdoor brick fireplace when I was a kid. Are you even allowed to burn leaves in this day and age? Man, I am getting old. The young lady visitor who just left laid it on me that she was born when I was leaving for Boot Camp. Oy vey!"
"Drinkability - Pretty good brew. Doesn't blow my socks off, but definitely worth a try. Went down easy. Bells creates solid brews and this one is no different. Not much else to say, except I can drink it no problem."
"D - It's a very good beer in it's own right and a good change of pace brown ale."
"I poured into a pint glass to three inches of tan head. It is brown. The aroma is earthy, nutty, and bready. The taste reflects much of the smells. I get lightly toasted malt and some nutty/earthiness. It is a very easy drinking beer. It makes a great session beer."
"Overall, very simple. Mostly sweet, but not bad in any way. Just pretty standard. Worth a try, and a good fall back if this is the only good craft available."
"D: Man this is just a good beer... a very solid brown. Good ABV, good flavors, smooth (when warm), good session beer. Worth a look at."
"Overall - Not the ""Best"" Brown ale as the name states but a pretty solid beer."
"D: This was a very nice brown ale, like an English barleywine cut in half. Solid malty scent and flavor, with decent body. It was very easy to drink and was quite enjoyable."
"D - The drinkability on this brew is off the charts. I should have gotten another 6-pack of this stuff before they're gone."
"Poured this brew into a sifter to check out the aroma,but nothing really stood out. Now the taste is smooth,not bitter at all.The ale has a beautiful brown color.Looks so good in this glass I think I'll try to drink it as slow as I can so I can enjoy it. Definitely something I'd buy in the future."
"This is a very drinkable brown ale that is not overly hoppy, or laden with too many specialty malts. If you are looking for something really robust, this may not be what you desire, but for a nice sessionable and impeccably made brown, Best Brown is definitely a great choice."
"This is a good fall beer. One I will likely come back to."
"Drinkability -- I had higher hopes for this one. I mean, look at the name! In all seriousness, it's a better than average brown ale, but in my mind it isn't one of the best, let alone *the* best."
"D - A pretty nice brown ale. A touch on the dry side with lots of caramel and an increasingly roasty character towards the finish. The hop character is light and does not get in the way of the malt but it is sufficient to balance the mild level of sweetness. A nice example of the style, I can't find anything to complain about other than the fact that I'm drinking it out of a bottle instead of a cask."
"Very nice Brown Ale - Easy going down with a nice aftertaste - Great brew for Autumn evenings sitting around the fireplace."
"My first brew here at the WF bar. It pours a clear rich auburn topped by a finger of light ecru foam. The nose comprises biscuit, rye bread, toffee, walnuts, flowers, and greens. The taste holds notes of light roasted malts, walnuts, oak, nutty toffee, and a strong hoppy bitterness in the background. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda dry finish. Overall, a very nice brown, maybe not the ""best"" around, but definitely tasty."
"A very solid style example and overall beer."
"The color is ruby/brown, thin head and just a little lacing. Smell is surprisingly light: brown sugar, prune juice, marshmallow, woodsy, faint smells of burning leaves. The flavor is malty, with rich caramel, nuts, slight hops, buttered rye bread and corn-tinged grain, which lends a bit of a dry bite. Rich but not overdone, good balancing act between the heavier malt vs. crisp, dry mellow hops. The mouthfeel is very smooth and inviting and this beer goes down quite nicely. The aftertaste is a bit syrupy, with brown sugar lingering on the back my tongue which might be bit of a detraction in terms of drinkability. Good stuff."
"D: This isn't the tastiest brown ale I've ever had but it is quite sessionable."
"Definately recommended."
"Pours a nice dark brown with a small tan head that disapears quickly. Aroma is ok, a little toffee and malts, but nothing earth shattering. Taste is also average, Some roasted coffee and malty toffee, but it doesn't really stand out. Its also a bit thin, which doesn't help the flavors build up in the mouth. This is just an average Brown ale."
"Poured into a pint glass. Nice dark brown color, small head retention. It has a sweet, malty aroma. Pleasant smell. The taste starts out stronger than I had expected, plenty of malt, only a little bit of hops. At first I was reminded of New Belgium's 1554 black ale. But the finish was disappointing. What started out strong evaporated quickly, leaving nothing but a bitter (but not displeasing) aftertaste on my tongue. I feel that this isn't a very well-balanced beer. It isn't a bad beer by any means, it just goes down a bit too quickly, and doesn't let me savor the flavors for long enough."
"O: A bit below my expectations for Bell's."
"T- To reiterate, this beer has a great balance between hops and malts. Some chocolate comes out at the end just before a dry finish."
"Pours a hazy brown-amber, with a bit of a light off-white head. Fairly spicy toasted malt flavor & aroma. A bit like a cross between a brown ale and an Oktoberfest beer. Medium-bodied and smooth, with light carbonation. A tasty and really nice beer, but not your typical brown ale."
"D - This beer is outstanding. I'd even go as far as to suggest that it is worthy of Supertasters formerly from Kalamazoo, suitable for imbibing with Friars, and acceptable to haters of beers with sin and devils all over them. Actually, come to think of it, the owl is a pagan symbol, so scratch that last part."
"Solid brown that is easy to drink."
"on tap at Some Guy's pizza, always have two bell's on tap. dark amber, not too dark that you can't see through it. Nice caramel malt in smell and taste. A bit of chocolate as well, but heavy on caramel and toffee in the aftertaste. Very solid brown ale, just what it should be, nice balanced malt profile and easy drinking."
"Serving: I poured it from a bottle to a chilled pint glass. I suggest that the beer be made very cold before consumption."
"D- Very drinkable, good brown ale, exactly what the style should be in my mind. Good beer to chill with."
"D. High. I used some of this with my cheddar cheese beer soup for dinner and drank some with it. I've been really digging some brown ales lately. I'll certainly be looking for more after this."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a pilsner glass a crisp light brown with a thin diminishing head that leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is slight sweet caramel malts. The taste is a amount of sweet caramel malts and subtle lingering citrus hops. The beer is quite light and crisp with smooth mild carbonation. This is an enjoyable brown ale, one I would certainly have again."
"Overall- I enjoyed the beer. I love browns but like a more roasty, nutty flavor profile and finish. This beer was a little light for me. Enjoyable and drinkable. I would recommend drinking a bottle of it but I'm divided if I will buy another six pack. It's a good better, above average beer on its merits and also in the style but I feel there are better products on the market. Like most of Bell's line, they have solid beers and this is one of them."
"Batch 9981 bottled on 9/16/10 pours a slightly hazy mahogany with a thick tan head that retains impressively. The aroma is pleasant and nuanced with notes of caramel and toffee, dark fruits, milk chocolate, hazelnut as well as toasted bread. The flavor has seriously malty goodness going on, with treacle and brown sugar, as well as plum and fig, mild coffee, milk chocolate, herbal hops and some toasted bread. I've had this beer a number of times before tonight but never really GOT it, but this sucker is smooth and super drinkable with a bunch of malt depth...this is what Tumbler should have been."
"Overall, a refined, somewhat reserved example of a brown. Looks as though ""drier"" and ""nuttier"" aren't all that uncommon among certain browns - suppose I just haven't come across too many of them and/or they didn't make much of an impression. Either way, this was a nice ale but one I don't see revisiting."
"Pours dark red, almost brown topped by off-white head. Aroma of toffee, molasses, rubber, alcohol, and burnt grains. Tastes of burnt grains, hops, pie crust, spices, and some light chocolate chips. Medium bodied brew that sits heavily on the palate and the stomach. A milkshake of a brown ale."
"D - This beer is alright, but not something I can see myself drinking a lot of."
"All in all, it's a pretty good and distinctive brown ale, which is a style that I often find can be dull or repetitive."
"The beer is a medium brown color, with a thin off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thin lace on the glass. The aroma is of caramelized malts, maple, nuts, honey and a touch of hops. The taste starts out sweet with flavors of maple, caramel, honey and nuts that are followed by a hearty malt character. The hops presence is decent for the style and brings a good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet. Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky."
"Notes: Overall a nice brown ale that has a lot of toasted, earthy, and nutty flavors. A nice fall beer."
"Excellent Brown Ale, perhaps my favorite of the style!"
"D= It's a ok beer kind of boring to me because nothing really stands out to me or defines it probably wouldn't buy this one again."
"Drinkable enough and clean enough in the mouth feel, but both are just off. It's a touch too thick in mouth feel for the flavor. The flavor is pretty light and ready to a day of drinking but the body isn't. it's not something I'd drink 4-5 of in a night. Just too thick and not flavorful enough to have me keep tipping my glass."
"Cheers!"
"D: This would be great for....I dunno? I'm sure it would be enjoyable in some situation but I can't think of any. It's unexciting, and I probably wouldn't buy it again for the mere fact that nothing makes me say ""wow"" about it, or even ""ooh."
"Drink: Dispite all the freakin' yeast you can see and sometimes taste. This beer is pretty drinkable, and very sessionable. Probably my go to brown ale."
"A tasty and nuanced brown ale, very nice."
"Drinkability is good. Drinks fairly easily."
"Drinkability- Good drinkability. I would prefer this for a colder time of year, but it is still nice and easy to drink. Enjoyable beer for sure."
"D - enjoyable, nothing out of the ordinary, but is a good example of an English Brown"
"D - very drinkable like any (seemingly) light beer would be, but why bother?"
"One of my favorites during the winter. A perfect balance of caramel, toast, nuttiness, soft sweetness, and soft hops. This beer pairs amazingly with food. Nice frothy head, great aroma, medium to light body, silky mouthfeel, and a pleasant, refreshing finish. A very nice brew!"
"D: this beer is very easy to drink, especially in the fall before a football game!"
"D: Very drinkable; goes down so smooth and the flavors allow for lengthy enjoyment"
"DB- A good beer with a very nice nutty aspect to it. The price was not bad but I can't get any of this in MA. The nutty flavors are strong but do not overpower as more of the beer is consumed. Definitely an enjoyable Brown Ale with good, balanced flavors."
"Notes - Not bad but not great either. The mouthfeel was just OK."
"Mouthfeel, nothing much, some brown colored beer, so surprises, no letdowns. A little costly for what it is."
"Pours a kind of murky carmel color with about a one finger foamy head that fades quick. Has a nice roasted nut smell with plenty of sweetness. Has lots of malt flavor with hints of fruit. This is a pretty smooth medium bodied brown. In fact it is one of the better brown ales I have had."
"This is an extreamly sessionable brew, and a very good one at that. One of the best brown ales I have had. Has a great drinkability, with a great finish and taste."
"very drinkable and a good contender if you're looking for a malty session beer. seems very true to style. yet another quality beer from bells."
"Flavor: roasty caramel with slight spiceyness tranistions to a more saltly nut flavor a little ripe fruit hanging around."
"Pretty drinkable. This is decent, but I have to say it's not one of the better Bell's beers out there."
"D- Super easy to drink. I've hit this one up a couple times and have no complaints at all."
"Very drinkable solid beer, could easily have a few more."
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a 1/2"" tan head above the cloudy orangey brown brew. Pillowy head fades slowly, with good lasting lace. Aroma is malts with a light earthy hoppiness. Taste is a touch tart to start, settle in with some rich grain character in the middle, and comes back to the mild tartness at the close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is pretty good."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a solid sessionable beer that is worth drinking for a while if you're in the mood for the style."
"Flows a creamy dark brown then clears up a bit, a light fading head. Nice toasty sweet nutty flavor,smooth mouth feel, I think a slap of hop at the back of my tongue on the finish, rounds out nicely. This is in my top 5 or 6 Brown ales, along with Dogfishhead, Sammy Smiths, Goose Island, Avery and a couple of others."
"Pours a dark red amber, looks almost like tea. Head was tan and about a cm in thickness though it dwindled to a little more than a ring. Aroma was pretty feint, although I could pick up hints of caramel and alcohol. Taste was pretty good and strong though. A mix of caramel sweetness, nuts, and alcohol. For some reason the taste is a bit too strong for me, at least the alcohol part, so I wouldn't call it too drinkable."
"Definitely a beer which you could have a nice session with."
"Damn fine brown ale. One of my favorites and is highly sessionable."
"Not what I look for in a brown ale. Better domestic offerings from Goose Island, Avery, Sam Adams, etc."
"Cloudy brown beer with a brown-sugar-molasses nose (although a bit sour, for which marks down) and taste, with enough spiciness to keep it interesting, sweet but with a dry finish (a little bit of chocolate in the finish?) and a chewy mouthfeel. Very drinkable, an awesome brown ale."
"Overall, the on-tap version was a bit thin in body, with the overall flavors more subdued, but with a bit more of a hoppier profile than I recall with the bottled version."
"D: A very drinkable ale, sessionable even. Makes me appreciate the non-extreme styles."
"D - Easy to get down, and nice tasting. Could do a few of these, but more a winter than summer beer."
"Very good English Brown Ale, my favorite style."
"Overall, a pretty nutty nice brown ale."
"I decided to re-review several months later, now that I've seriously gotten into the world of craft brews and understand what to look for. That said, it's nice to find a brown ale with some character, but not so overwhelming that it wrecks the easy-drinking reputation of the style. The modest, but noticeable hop finish really does a good job of balancing out a style that I think is often too sweet. This is my go-to brown ale, and I give it a hearty nod of approval."
"One of the better browns definitely try this out if you can and support a fantastic brewery."
"D: Very drinkable smooth, nice everyday beer, but at 5.8% cannot be considered a session beer."
"A great choice, especially for those who are fans of brown ales."
"Khaki colored head that flattened out and formed a collar around the glass. Little bit of lacing. Seems a little lighter colored for a brown ale. Nutty smell that is slightly malty. Taste is pretty much as it smells. Pretty average mouthfeel. Nice and smooth drinkability. Pretty light for this style of beer. Not my favorite brown ale, but pretty good overall."
"Slightly sweet smelling, malty with a tinge of nuttiness. Taste reflected much of the same, was a little lighter than I was expecting for the style. A little crisp in the mouth, a little more carbonated than I would have imagined, but still very good. This is a smooth beer that I found very drinkable, would definitely purchase again. Pretty much can't go wrong with anything from Bell's."
"This beer has a lighter than usual brown color to it for a brown ale, with a very nutty taste and smell. It is not the heaviest brown ale i've had and seems to be highly carbonated. I am very fond of Bells Brewery and find this to be one of their better beers!"
"I love every Bell's product I've tried so far!"
"Picked it up in a bottle as a mixed 6er. Appearance was a hazy darker brown. Smelled very nutty. Tasted alright, almost like drinking a newcastle. Althought, I would probably prefer a newcastle to this. Felt good in the mouth, but just didn't have the slam dunk finish I was expecting. Would drink it again if it was offered though."
"The Best Brown pours a deep amber almost brown color with a nice frothy ivory colored head with lots of lacing. Very good start to the beer. Aromas are sweet caramel and lots of malts. Taste is well balanced with sweetness up front and a bitter crisp finish. Some earthy tones come out with the warmer of the pint (it was poured much too cold). Very solid sweetness that consists of brown sugar cane. Mouthfeel is crisp while quenching. Drinkability is high. Not an overpowering ale with the ABV being moderate. I must say I drank several pints and enjoyed them but yet drove home safely."
"Overall the best the variety had to offer so please give it a try!"
"D - A friend said, and I agree, that this is probably what Newcastle is meant to taste like (before it is imported and spends months in clear bottles). Not near as good as Oberon, but very easy to drink. A very pound-able minikig."
"Notes: Brown ales are one of my favorite styles and this one impressed me. I love the balance. It's got a good traditional feel, but also some Bell's flair."
"D: This is a nicely blended and tasty brown ale. It is a solid and sessionable, I haven't met a Bell's product that I haven't liked yet."
"Drink is high I could have these all night long. Wish I had a sixer on hand."
"carbonation bubbles are a little big for my tastes, they sting the tongue too much, which seems to conflict somewhat with the overall concept of the beer."
"Drinkability: Not to heavy or skunky with decent flavor, I would definitely have one of these again."
"D - Very drinkable. I could easily put away 4-5 of these if I weren't careful."
"D: Certainly a session contender. I could drink a few of these back to back during a brisk autumn day."
"D: This is definitely the best English Brown I've had thus far. It's subtle, but still quite flavorful and complex. Most significantly, though, it's got a great body to itself, and not as watery as some English browns get. I still prefer the stronger American Browns, but the balance and complexity here are respectable enough to be enjoyed."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium with good carbonation. Drinkability is high. Brown ales aren't something I crave often, but I can easily throw back a couple of these. Recommended"
"Overall, this is a really good beer, as you would expect from anything bearing the Bell's logo. It's very tasty and the smell is superb. Nicely complex but still would make a fantastic session brew. This is a beer you have to try."
"Pours a brown body with an offwhite head and moderate lacing. Nose and aroma are mostly sweet malt, toffee/caramel with a mild hop bitterness on the back end. Not quite as bitter as you might expect from an English Brown. Overall fairly balanced and easy drinking. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. Very drinkable - I drank this down almost too fast...probably didn't allow myself to get enough impression of the beer as I should have. Regardless, very enjoyable brew."
"Notes: Everyone reading this review should find and try this beer!"
"I quite like it. Not as good as the Two-Hearted, but a keeper. Also, I like original ideas/fresh takes on a beer, and this works."
"D- Overall, this is a very drinkable English-style Brown Ale that is definitely worth a try. Recommended!"
"Drinkability was exceptional, not too heavy as noted above, and not too light so you don't just breeze though it. Unassumingly complex, and exceptional. Great for a ""come down"" beer, or an autumn tasting."
"Nice body and carbonation. Very enjoyable, haven't had this in years - a solid beer from Bells."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and has a creamy amount of carbonation."
"bottle with a great dinner at Poole's Diner, Raleigh - surprised that this review had slipped by me for so long"
"Cheers."
"Pours a copper brown with a hint of Red. Pretty dark but you can see through it if you hold it up to light. Nice sized head - near white. Lots of lacing. Smells nutty and malty. Taste is full of flavor - malty with a wheat bread taste. Maybe a hint of metallic flavor. Very drinkable as the mouthfeel is perfect."
"Thoughts- This is a nice brown ale, it is not top shelf but would be a good session beer on a crisp September afternoon."
"D: Good. The ""lightness"" of this beer makes it very approachable, though I would have liked to see a bit more character in this one."
"Drinkability: Very nice, could enjoy a few before getting tired of it."
"Pours a clear brown color body, with a big tan foamy head, very lasting. Malty nutty aroma, some toasted notes and earthiness, mustiness. Some sharpness too. Somewhat creamy, nutty taste. Very brown ale like, some earthiness and slight sweetness. Some sharpness from the hops, and finishes pretty smooth. Wow, a pretty good beer, nearly session-like."
"Drinkability is good , sure a few of these would be great"
"Tasty, even keeled brew, one that delivers a nice deep nutty flavor and aroma. While far from outstanding, it registers as good and balanced. What more could I expect from a good brown ale?"
"overall, i really enjoyed this one bells does a great job"
"It was light with really no carbonation, just too low. It's a nice brown ale, not very sweet like some others but not as bitter as most English Brown Ales."
"D - The relatively low ABV lends to it's sessionability. This is a good beer, I've seldom been let down by Bell's which is why they are a favorite brewery of mine. I will be recommending this one to all of my friends!"
"Drinkability is high... I could sip on these all night in front of a warm fire while watching the Lions lose and the Wolverines win. Michigan winter in a bottle!"
"Drinkability is good, not overpowering in any flavors but yet very flavorful."
"Taste: Really wonderful. Toffee and nuttiness. One of the best brown ales I've ever had."
"So I've given this sucker a ""B" -- and it's easy to forget that B does not mean Bad...it's actually Good! The catch here is that ""good"" is below the average of the usually excellent Bell's. Ultimately, Best Brown is very drinkable and certainly enjoyable, yet here I am looking more forward to my next Third Coast Old Ale, Two Hearted, or Expedition Stout. C'est la vie..."
"D - This beer scores major points on drinkability! At 5.8%, it's not a heavy-hitter, goes down smooth and still has enough flavor and darkness to it to qualify it as an Autumn beverage. I tore through two of these over lunch, so it's a session beer for certain."
"Deep brown with a one-finger tan head. It falls away quickly but leaves a moderate amount of lacing. Could have looked nicer but definitely not bad. The aroma was malty but faint. A modest amount of caramel and a hint of chocolate intertwined with a hop aroma. The flavor was a bit of a downer as I'd hoped for more of a malt presence but got more hop bitterness. There was also an astringent, grainy character that didn't really add anything to the beer. This is the first offering from Bell's that I was somewhat disappointed with."
"this is a very good brown ale and once of the easiest drinking brown ales i have had."
"Another great beer form Bell's"
"This is an autumn beer, for sure. It's a very pleasant brown ale. It's not very complex, but it works for what it is."
"Mouth feel and drinkability: It iis fairly smooth, but it does have some crispness to it. Overall, I would drink it again (in fact I have five more at least to drink). A good, but not great brown ale that's worth trying and easy to drink."
"Drinkability and mouthfeel: Very crisp and easy to drink. Not too harsh on the palate."
"D: I wish Larry would brew this one year-round. I'm not the biggest fan of the style, but this is one that I can sip on time after time."
"This was the first Bell's Best Brown Ale I've had. I won't necessarily be seeking out more. Not all that more interesting than Killian's Red. Fairly light & bland."
"Overall, one of the better English brown ales I have had. Very nice flavors to it. Very hoppy as well so it was well balanced. Easy drinking beer. Gotta love Bell's."
" in cooking and barbeque sauces."
"CHEERS!!"
"This is very drinkable; I don't doubt that the nose would really pick up and the body would firm up a little from the bottle."
"D- A little heavier than most browns but tasty and smooth enough to session through."
"if its fall bells brown is back as a seasonal ..pours a dark brown color with a nice fluffy head as most bells brews have it had a nice beige ring with lacing til the end the smell was malts and toffee some chocolate and some roasted coffee..the taste was the same chocolate and coffee dominate with hops and malt its kinda like a lite stout..this is a tasty brew for the fall one i look forward to.. a tasty brown for sure its a winter warmer"
"D: Perfect, as far as a simple, uncomplicated, sessionable ale is concerned. This is one to be admired, not in spite of, but because of, its simplicity."
"Medium-full body. Soft texture. Smooth, easy drinker. Yet another winner from Bell's."
"A nice sessionable brown ale from Bells. Was a perfect companion with pepperoni lovers pizza."
"Drinkability: A slightly above average to average English brown. The mix of hops to malts is fine but this beer is indistinguishable from others I have tried. One that I would have again if I am in the mood for a brown, but nothing I search for."
"Overall- not to shabby of a brown ale. no samuel smith's but worth a try."
"Comes out of the tap a semi-transparent chocolaty brown with a fine-bubbled pale tan head. Aroma is of average strength, malty and slightly chocolaty. Rich malty flavor has cocoa undertone along with nutty and caramel hints as well as just a whisper of fine coffee. Texture is thick, fairly smooth and nicely fizzy."
"(D)- A good to solid brown ale for the fall season when you tire of oktoberfests or wet-hopped beers. Nothing fancy, just classic drinking."
"Poured a cloudy, medium brown with a one finger head that slowly faded to a solid skin. Unfortunately, my nose has failed me again and I didn't get anything. The taste was nutty sweet, safe and comfortable. The feel was medium bodied with sufficient carbonation. Drinkability was quite good. Best Brown was a good beer that doesn't require you to be a risk taker to enjoy. That said, it's not very exciting either. I would definitely drink again, reminds me of Newcastle."
"MF/D: Medium/full in body, lingering nutty finish"
"Drinkability: Very solid example of a traditional Brown Ale. If it wasn't for the aftertaste, this would be top-notch."
"This is a highly quaffable brew! Easy to drink and extremely satisfying."
"D: I'm not the biggest fan of brown ales - the style is not the most complex - but this is a solid, drinkable beer."
"Appearance is a medium deep brown with some haziness and little floaties from the bottle conditioning. Good carbonation and head retention. Smells of rich malts with bready/bicuity characteristics rise up. Taste some caramel and coffee tones. Feels creamy with a little carbonation bite at the end. Really like this brown ale."
"Overall, not my favorite Bell's beer or example of the style, but pretty solid nonetheless. Worth a try for sure."
"Drinkability: This is pretty good. I could certainly get this again and enjoy it, but I think I would prefer something that is a little more balanced for my tastes."
"Overall, it seems to me that this brown ale is almost too heavy for mass comsumption(both on the wallet and the stomach) Flavors were really nice and has a good American (hoppy) characteristic that I like. Though would like this one to be less filling."
"One of the best brown ales I've had because I prefer the milder taste instead of overpowering burnt/caramelized flavors associated with most brown ales."
"Slightly watered down with a subtle smoked maltiness along with some oatmeal, chocolate malt, hazelnut and subtle hop notes. Finish is slightly dry. Pretty drinkable session beer but not something I would seek out again."
"Supposedly a seasonal fall-winter beer, but available mid-July. The brown ale pours a beautiful clear brown with a tan-colored, thick, mousse-like head. The head persists and leaves intricate Belgian lace when sipped. The nose is both delicate and noticeable with hints of toasted bread, toffee, malt and ginger. The malt notes are light and sweet but not cloying. On the palate the ale has a medium body, perfect balance and a wonderful lingering finish that wants you to go back for. This ale is totally moreish! The carbonation pleasant and the alcohol is not noticeable."
"Bell's Best Brown Ale is a clear, dim red ale with a dense, frothy coffee-cream colored head that's elastic and retains its form well. It coats the glass. The nutty chocolate aroma has a light floral note. It's a little roasty. It smells great. It's pretty full bodied and incredibly smooth with a clean, dry finish. It feels soft and fluffy. It tastes dry, roasty, nutty and chocolaty. There's enough wooden, leafy bitterness to balance it out perfectly. It's incredibly drinkable-- an excellent beer."
"Poured from a bottle into my pint glass. Color is deep amber with head that only sticks around for a short while. Minimal lacing on the glass. As noted from other bell's products it has the familiar particles floating in suspension (not just near the bottom of the beer.) Mild but pleasant hop aroma. Slight hop bitterness that is nicely balanced with malt sweetness. Slightly more bitter than it is sweet, it invites you in for the next sip. Very drinkable and a fine beer overall."
"Poured from bottle to the trusty pint glass. Pours a hazy dark copper or dark amber in color, I cant decide which. 1 finger off white creamy head, good retention, minimal lacing. Smell was very nice. A nice blend of dark caramel, sweet malt, toasted grain, and even some dark fruit. Taste was good, relatively similar to smell. Sweet caramel, almost a little too sweet, with some toasted grain, and dry malt. Mouthfeel was fine, not too thin but a little dry. Overall a good beer and easy drinker. And I'm not a huge brown fan either."
"Hazy dark reddish amber color with a thin tan head and nice lacing. Scent of sweet, roasted malt. Nice roasted chocolate taste with a slight bitter aftertaste. Reminds me somewhat of a dry irish stout. All the floaties were somewhat off-putting but overall some great flavor and a quality session beer."
"D - Another quality offering from Bell's. Excellent balance of buttery/caramely sweetness and a touch of spiciness to dry things out. A good interpretation on a sometimes underwhelming style."
"D: I could drink a few of these.. and I just might ;)"
"being that we don't get Bell's in NJ i had to travel over the bridge to PA for some....picked up a variety case to see what Bell's was all about....this is my first offering from them"
"D- This is one that I could definitely keep drinking all night."
""
"Overall: Mouthfell was good, just as you expect. Quite drinkable, the wonderful flavor makes it hard not to have a few. I can't believe I got a 6-pack for only $3.50...I love 1/2 off sales."
"Great stuff - drink it!"
"D - A damn good Brown Ale, I could drink these all night. The beer goes easy on the hops, but throws in enough other great flavors to keep the beer interesting. A definite winner which makes me want to try the other Belles varieties, though a little spendy at around $9.00 a six."
"Drinkability: Amazingly drinkable, as a brown ale should be. Solid malt backbone is flavorful and refreshing, really feels like there is something substantial to this beer."
"Notes: Excellent brown ale; great representation of the style."
"This brown pours a deep chestnut color. These is thin tan head that dissipates quickly. There is not a whole lot a smell, but what is there is nuttyish. I get a solid brown flavor, a hint of chocolate/nuts. Highly drinkable. Very smooth. The flavor stays on the middle of my tongue for a bit, then leaves. Great brown."
"Superbly drinkable and delicious beer, I would buy this by the case if I could get it."
"Ever slight on the bitterness at the finish."
"mid to full body. good carbonation. i like this beer. will drink again."
"Also, the bottle is different than the photo."
"D - Good balance between the sweet malts and hops. Would be able to drink a few."
"batch # 8749.A brownish amber color with a thick off-white head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some excellent lacing. Aroma of roasted nuts and caramel malt with a touch of citrus and grassy hops. Taste is smooth, medium bodied, lightly carbonated with flavors of light caramel malt, some citrus zest and a touch of pecans.maybe a hint of grass. Finish is smooth, creamy with a more malty aftertaste than any bitterness.Very quaffable,and quite enjoyable."
"D: I wished I had bought more than 1. I look forward to trying again. It's not so heavy as their slow-sipping stout (or any stout, really), and that could make it a good session beer, if a bit on the heavy side."
"Nice medium bodied brown, maybe a little hot for the style, but what do I know? I guess it's on the high end. Really a very drinkable and quality brown ale."
"Of course it is malty...roasty and flavorful, but it has a nice hop balance to it. Very smooth and drinkable...it's crisp with a surprisingly dry finish. Just a hint of fruitiness adds to the complexity. A most delicious session beer. One of the better brown ales I have had."
"Pours a decent light brown color, getting lighter as the beer drains; some good head and lacing, nothing great. Nice scent, very sweet and malty, but not as Earthy as I like. Great taste, though, fairly deep, nice maltiness, with a great hoppy bite towards the end fading to a nice sweet aftertaste. Goes down quite well."
"This is a pretty good, but conservative -- staple, even -- example of the style."
"A very fine example of all that can be wonderful about this style. A very solid and thoroughly delicious brown ale that should not be overlooked in the presence of bigger beers."
"Pours a nice brown color with a small head that quickly dissipates. Small is of a light nut smell. I let it warm up as I thought is was too cold from the fridge to start getting a rightful taste test of this. A decent nut taste but a bit too weak. A decent brew to drink if you don't feel like spending the money on sam smith nut brown ale."
"D: Pretty good, could be mistaken for a session beer even I would say if I just tasted it. Something I would buy again."
"Huge, whipped up head, looks like the foam sealant you use to insulate cracks, light brown in hue with tenacious lacing. Opaque mud brown which drops off to redder brick and then orange at the rims, lightening just enough to see the active beads. At times sherry-like nose of nuts, dates, figs, followed on by caramel and brown sugar, root beer, never slumps nor loses pacing but hard to credit the absent hops for this, simply sticks to a smaller array of scents and deepens them. Medium-bodied, the carbonation level is fine and allows for flavor saturation. Coffee, toffee, milk chocolate on hand but too watered down for much effect. That root beer thing remains. More grain, oats here, texturally tightens towards the finish. Hazelnut and brazil nut too. Creamy, soft texture appealing but cannot make up for how the flavors drop up through the mid-palate. Nothing wrong with a beer aiming to be tactful but you still need a reason to pop another."
"Poured into a pint glass, this brew is a nice caramel brown color with a tall off white head that leaves great lacing on the glass. The aroma was full of malt character with hints of roasted almonds, light chocolate, and some burnt caramel. The taste was a little thin, but full of flavor. This has a nice balance and a good finish. Could drink a few of these."
"D:	The taste is a little underwhelming and lacking in complexity, but overall a quite drinkable beer. I would definitely have another, although this is not the best example of the style. Unfortunately I'm having this in February instead of late Fall, when I could see this going well with blankets and a campfire."
"Poured beer into a pint glass. Has a fluffy off-white head and dark reddish brown color. First smell is sweet and malty hardly any hops. Mild sweetness continues in the taste and the hops becomes a little more present. Medium mouth feel with plenty of carbonation. Overall it is nice drinkable beer. Has enough character to stand out from other English Browns but still true to form though ABV at 6.60 may be a little high for the style."
"definitely a solid beer to have around"
"I think the flavor of this would be awesome to give to a BMC drinker as a gateway."
"Overall: Bell's makes solid beers and this is one of the best browns (no pun intended) I've ever had. Pick it up."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable because of the balance of flavors. The alcohol is not very high, but Newcastle drinkers will be surprised by it. This could easily be a session beer."
"On tap at a little bar just south of Wisconsin (Bell's is truly back in IL). Poured a hazel brown, minimally cloudy with a thin head, only some lacing throughout. The smell was of fresh dark bread and toasted nuts. This carried into the taste which was of rustic brown bread and caramel/malt. Some hop-spice gave a plesant balance. None of which was overly strong. It was satisfyingly full on the tongue but marred by an overabundance of carbonation (I'll blame the bar). Not a style I normally reach for first, but thoroughly enjoyable through 2 pints. 6.6ABV is a slight caution against drinking these all night, especially with friends having 4.4 macros."
"Three finger's of tan, creamy head sit atop this deep red-brown beer. The head last for awhile leaving lacing throughout the duration of the drink. Smell is of caramel malts, with a bit of sugary sweetness in the background. Taste is much the same, with a bit of nuttiness added to it. Mouthfeel was exceptional, very smooth, with a decent body and good carbonation. Overall, an excellent beer and a definite recommendation."
"Drinkability: great session beer"
"Poured to a big head that lasted quite a while. Head was offwhite in color. Also had some good lacing. Lacing left its marks with every swallow. Ale was brown in color with reddish highlights. Very light smelling. Just of some malt and chocolate with a slight alcohol smell. Tasted of chocolate, malt, butter or perhaps butterscotch. Had a slight pine flavor with that hoppy bitter aftertaste. Felt good in the mouth, carbonation was right. This is going to be my brew for superbowl. I plan on staying home and enjoying a few."
"Great choice for a fall day...i could imagine myself buying again on a 60 degree night..."
"D: Another winner from Bell's, even if it isn't in its upper tier. Still a good one to go to for brown ale lovers."
"Drinkability is decent as the sweet buttery taste mat become overwhelming after a few."
"Good drinkablility. Tasty enough to enjoy throughout an evening, enough alcohol to act as a social lubricant, yet low enough alcohol to not destroy you. A good, albeit on the high end, session beer."
"Notes: great, well-balanced brown. nothing over the top. everything in balance. great beer to get someone to move from pales to something with more character."
"D - A well-put-together brown ale. Good sessionability, good flavor without being too complex or demanding."
"Drinkability: Somewhat more a typical brown ale than anything. I can't detect much that distinguishes this otherwise."
"D= Drinkability was ok, but the flavors would not make me want to have it often. About my least favorite Bell's beer so far."
"Overall, a great beer that I highly recommend. Another great one from Bell's. Oh how I wish they were available here in the Great Beer Desert of Texas. Can't wait to try the other Bell's I brought back. Will definitely pick up more of this the next time I'm in Indy."
"Pours a solid dark brown with a little light brown head that dissipated pretty quickly. Smelled malty but not too strong really. Had a nice, medium body and good mouthfeel. The flavor is really good! A malt kick but it's not something more.. some sort of spiciness perhaps that really makes a nice finish. Definitely a drinkable beer. Not sure why I took so long to try this one of Bell's, but I'm glad I finally did."
"Drinkability suffers from lack of taste."
"Beer was poured from a 12 oz bottle into a goblet. Had a dark brown/weak coffee color with a foamy thin head that quickly dissipated. Smells like roasted malts, yeast and nuts. Flovour is heavy on malts and nuttiness. Some hints of yeast and bread in there too. Goes down easy."
"Had Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale right before, and the Bell's Best Brown seemed way less interesting."
"average drinkability for me on this one."
"D: Drinkability is good, not doubt it's sessionable."
"Pours a solid brown with garnet highlights when held to light. Small mocha head sticks around for a bit. Smells of chocolate and a earthy nutty bready kind of thing going on. Tastes malty chocolaty faint bread and caramel. Mouthfeel is creamy, body is a little thin carbonation on the low side. Great little sessionable brown ale."
"Pours a dark copper brown with a somewhat small head. Aroma is very light. Toasty malt with a hint of hops. Taste has a nice malty character with just a slight background sweetness. Toasty and a bit bready. Some herbal hops in the finish. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Easily drinkable. Overall a very solid and pleasant brown ale."
"Overall - Hmmm... A very well balanced, creamy and delicious brown ale."
"Not a bad beer, not sure I would get again but wouldnt deny a free one."
"D: Fine enough, once again. Certainly a very drinkable beer with I'd say broad appeal. Just not a stand out Brown Ale for me. Perhaps my palate has changed in time as I try more and more beers, and I've moved on from the Brown Ale style? Not sure if that's it. I'll have to try more beers to be sure."
"I could by this stuff by the case, a wonderful winter beer, tasty but just the slightest bit too big to be an endlessly sessionable beer, but it is really easy to knock off not only a glass of this stuff, but a couple bottles as well."
"Could definately drink a few of these in a session no matter the season"
"Very tasty, nice sweetness that doesn't overwhelm. Don't get one, get the 6 pack. You'll wish you had more than one for sure."
"Overall, this is a good brown ale. I do think there are several components that could have been better but as expected, Bell's produced another good beer and I will drink it again."
"Definitely tasty and sessionable -- a good spin on the brown ale style and a solid fall seasonal."
"D- i could have a few of these in a sitting without wanting to switch. nice flavor and low ABV makes this one very sessionable."
"D: Very drinkable. A nice representation of an English Brown Ale."
"Nice sessionable beer."
"Finally, after reviewing several beers from quickly scribbled notes, it's time to review beer that's sitting in front of me. Pours a dark amber/brown color, orange highlights with lots of suspended particles and a tan head that recedes slowly leaving some above average lacing. Lightly toasted malt aroma, backed up by some toffee and caramel notes, and slightly fruity. A faint metallic aroma is in the background. Taste is pretty similar to the nose. Some light toffee flavors, light fruitiness, some caramel and faintly metallic. Medium mouthfeel, leaving a little to be desired. Not a bad brown ale, but pretty one-dimensional."
"Notes from 10/23/05"
"D: I used to drink this on draft when I lived in Indiana and it is nice to see this brown ale out in the Mid atlantic region."
"Good brownie by Bell's. Aroma is of delicate caramel and toasted dark malt. Lighter brown pour with a sizable light tan head and spotty lacing. Rich medium bodied mouthfeel, slightly creamy and oh so smooth. This is a pleasant easy drink. Good malt flavor, lightly hopped. Sweet malts with a nutty affect. Good dose of caramel with a sprinkling of coffee. Recommended for everybody this beer should easily appeal to all."
"Medium body with a crisp/dry finish. There is a slight sweetness left over from the caramel malts."
"After drinking several very hopped up beers, this is exactly what I wanted. Its smooth, malt dominate beer. It smells like a day in the forest and looks like a pile of freshly raked leaves. I like this beer a lot, and I am sad to drink the last of them."
"D: a very nice brown ale almost bordering on a porter. I was able to drink a few."
"D: very easy going down, good everyday drinker."
"The beer is smooth, and has no taste of sour, hops are evident. The mouthfeel is not overly heavy, yet not crisp. It is a very drinkable Brown Ale. If you can find this one, give it a shot, even if you don't like say New castle brown ale."
"Overall, a pretty good brown ale that doesn't overdo things. It is light and airy, but gets the job done."
"A solid English brown from the folks at Bell's. Easy to drink after a long day."
"Overall this is a solid brown ale. It's not as complex as others that I've tried but it does what it does very well. Worth a shot."
"its a hazy medium shade of brown with no head on it. it smells like carmel and biscuits. it is light and refreshing but there is a certain thickness to it that hides well. an odd sweetness sticks out, i can't put my finger on what it is. also a spicyness to it. medium body with decent carbonation and mouthfeel."
"Drinkability: As solid an English brown as I've ever had. Definitely ""Bell's Best Brown," at least. Abv% is reasonable and fine for the style, tastes and aromas are pleasant, both sweet and dry ... I'm gonna call this one a recommend."
"A good session beer and a very enjoyable brown."
"This beer pours a dark cloudy brown color with a nice big fluffy white head that sticks around for a while and leaves nice lacing on the glass. The smell is toasty and nutty with some roasted malts. The taste is oily hazelnut and the mouthfeel is medium to full body and is oily as well. Overall another good offering from bells and certainly worth a try."
"Different from other brown ales I've tasted, this one is less sweet with more hops. The malt profile is still there, but this one mixes it up with other elements. Enjoyable."
"Well I ended up drinking five of these tonight, so I suppose it's pretty drinkable. Overall, it's really not that great - I made a homebrew that I tasted side by side and mine was similar but better. My friend agreed in a blind taste test. This stuff is good but I'd rather drink Goose Island Nut Brown, even though it's a totally different kind of brown (much sweeter)."
"Brown ales never really explode with flavor, but this one shines in an understated maturity of flavor."
"Smooth and soft with a fullish medium body, the drink is nicely carbonated with superb drinkability."
"Pours a reddish brown color with a small beig head. Smell is very nutty, toasty and has a great fresh maltiness about it. Taste is nutty, drying and malty with a light hopp bitterness and an almost nutty chocolately taste. Good body to it, and a really nice brown ale!"
"D: a great drinking english brown by style."
"Overall: the bottle advertises this as a beer for late fall or winter, but I'm still enjoying it even as I'm in the middle of a summer heat wave. Highly recommended to those who like brown ales, and everyone else as well."
"I would definitely recommend this beer."
"I've never been a fan of English styles but this one is excellent. A flavorful experience with a nice medium body that keeps every sip interesting. I would definitely buy this again and have it on hand, especially in the winter time. The nutty, toffee, caramel flavors and scents bring a holiday warmth with it."
"D - This is a very good brown ale. A nice sweet malty taste."
"Not a bad beer at all. I'd call it a slightly above average brown ale that gets the job done but is one that would barely stand out in a crowd. Worth a shot."
"This brown ale has a light mahogany color with a huge light tan head and major lacing. There is only a very mild malt aroma, disappointing. It does follow with a nice charcoal toffee taste though. I detect midland cabonation and find it to be very drinkable. There's a hint of orange and chocolate nuttiness. Bitter grassy hops in the back. The hops tend to dominate toward the end, maybe too much. Sweet malt, a nice blend."
"drinkability is good. this is a solid brown ale, easy going and smooth on the palate. a great offering from Bell's. cheers!"
"D - What an excellent brew! I could seriously have one of these everyday, but I wish the abv was a bit lower, for this could be an awesome session brew. Definite reco here."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full with an expected bit of ""weight"" on the tongue. This beer is very drinkable. Try it when you find it."
"Bell's never ceases to amaze me. This is the first chance I've had to try this particular beer and, as is the case most of the time, Bell's does it right and very well. Pours a deep, dark brown. Smells sweet and malty and tastes the same with a touch of chocolate for good measure. This is one of those beers I could drink all night without a problem. Good stuff. Recommended."
"D- Good brown ale. Nothing overly complex. Seems like it would be a good ease into winter."
"Poured a deep red with perfect carbonation, more sediment than I anticipated. The smell was interesting--some vanilla and flowery perfume in addition to the expected maltiness, etc. The taste is delicious at a moderate chill--I don't think I'd like this one overchilled--and I could drink this all night. Just had one tonight, though. Very nice."
"Oeverall a nice drinkable Brown"
"I could drink a few of these in a sitting. I don't know that I would actively seek this brew out, but this is certainly not a bad beer."
"Poured into a glass with a 2 finger head. Dark brown in color with a very fragrant smell. You can really taste the high malt content. The mouthfeel is what is a disappointment to me. It doesn't really have a lot of depth for flavor. The after taste remains on your tongue for a while and can be quite bitter."
"Eric"
"Poured a murky dark brown with a reddish tint to it. There was a one finger off white head that dissipated to a thin ring with some slight lacing. The smell is mostly malt with a little caramel and sweetness. The taste is strong for a brown. There is mostly malt with a bitter kick in the end which is carried through by the carbonation. The mouthfeel is creamy but not too thick which coupled with the smooth flavor and great carbonation make this one a great warm session ale."
"Very disappointed with this beer, especially since it's from Bell's."
"This is a very malty beer that has an interesting character that is more like a marzen or a winter warmer than a brown ale. Dry finish and light mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to give a slight bite at the end. Not great, but not bad. A bit disappointing coming from Bell's, but who can complain with their other fantastic releases?"
"I like most of Bell's offerings a lot but this one really caught me off guard. It is a great brown and should be recognized among the top few of the style. It is quite unique, incredibly drinkable, and thankfully I picked up more than one bottle as I definitely did not grasp all that there was to experience in this brew. Bell's Best Brown will in fact hold that title in my book until I come across a real rival."
"This one seemed to have some of its body missing, and some of the complexity. I tend to enjoy brown ales that have a little more of a roasty characteristic. This one seemed a little watery."
"Overall this was definitely a quality brown ale. I would not say it was the best I have ever had, but it was certainly above normal for sure. I would love to try this on tap, as I really feel it would bring out the best in its character when poured fresh. Definitely a high quality regular rotation offering from Bells here and something I would really like to try again."
"d: A very tasty brown ale. Great example of what a brown ale should be. Nothing extravagant, just some solid nutty toasted flavors and one easy drinking beer."
"D: Easy to drink, not bad over all, I probably wouldn't drink two in a row as the depth isn't quite there"
"Poured a brown color {hmm} very light, with a great amount of fizzy off white head. It goes away quickly, but does leave light traces of lacing, and slight bubbles on top of the body. Smell is very sweet with malt and caramel coming through. Taste is smooth and sweet with malt, and some cocao coming through. Mouth feel is very smooth."
"No real faults, but not a stand out in any way."
"Mouthfeel is very thin for a brown and overly carbonated, this is my first real big disappointment from the folks at Bells."
"D-Smooth and easy to drink, with a perfect texture and airiness if you plan on putting back more than a couple."
"D: I'd drink a couple of these in a sitting, but the ABV is pushing on getting a little high, so it might keep it a bit on the more easy-does-it side of things."
"This is a fine Brown Ale. Nicely balanced. Great session beer."
"Overall Impression: A solid, easy drinking brown ale. A fair session beer and one that a non beer geek (but not a solid BMC drinker) would appreciate."
"d'ability - A rich, malty brown ale. Would like a little more hop flavor for further distinguish it from a porter. But still very drinkable."
"Insanely drinkable. This is a classic example of one of those great-tasting beers that I could knock back all night without getting tired of."
"Excellent brown ale, one that stacks up well with Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale--no mean feat."
"If you like your Brown Ale on the nutty side this is a must try."
"12 oz bottle. Pours a deep amber with a 2 cm bubbly tan head that is slowly diminishing. Aroma of roasted malts and a hint of caramel. Initial flavor has malts with some caramel. Flavor closes with some nuttiness that is lasting. Some lacing, light carbonation, light on alcohol. Light to medium body. Drinkable and simple, good beer for non-craft beer drinkers."
"Overall- It's a flavorful and versatile brown ale. It's a safe and solid offereing that's missing a bit of the ""wow"" factor of some of Bell's more eccentric offerings. A nice fall/winter beer."
"D: A solid, smooth drinking brown ale. A nice beer got the winter months."
"D - Not bad. this is a pretty good beer that even non-beer geeks could enjoy, and I would recomend it with out hesitation to those people if they wanted to try a ""dark"" beer."
"Appearance is, not surprisingly, brown. Aromas and flavors of caramel, nuts, brown sugar, and oats. Mouthfeel is excellent and the carbonation is just right. Amazingly drinkable for a rich and fairly malty beer - I can easily down 2 or 3 of these. In fact, this is one of my favorite session beers in the winter. What I love most about this beer is how approachable it is - I recommend serving this beer as a great example of the American craft brew style to anybody who is used to Bud/Miller/Coors. There's enough hops to balance it out but very little bitterness that might turn somebody off. Those of us who are used to craft brews forget that many beers we like, such as IPAs, are not palatable to most people. I went to a party a while back where the host was serving this beer along with Stella Artois, and I noticed people switching from the Stella to this beer after they tasted it. Bravo to Bell's for making a craft brew that both beer geeks and your everyman beer drinker can enjoy."
"D: While most of the aromas and flavors are very mild, there is a still a deep, strong taste that is very persistent in the aftertaste. For me this start off very unassuming and disappointing but became a very nice brown ale."
"D_This is a dangerously good brown ale. I would drink this if available around here. I would say this falls somewhere between the British and American versions of a brown ale."
"With full deep flavors and good balance, this is one tasty and quaffable Brown Ale from Bell's. Solid."
"Hazy coppery brown with suspended particles. Decent head that falls down to a thin layer. A nice drinkable brown ale. Not overly rich to be very sessionable. Nutty, malty goodness, with a bit of a hoppy finish. Not as chocolaty as many American browns tend to be. Very good English style brown ale."
"Nice brew. Very drinkable."
"D - Completely un-stellar in most concerns. Not your typical Bell's. Oh well."
"First, I need to say that I have been a big fan of several brown ales (from my all-time favorite Tilburg's Dutch Brown Ale to the fairly common Newcastle Brown Ale), so this one comes under intense scrutiny. And Bell's beers have a history of not pleasing my palate. So the cards come stacked against this one. Nonetheless, this one comes up strong. There's a rich, deeply roasty feel to it, actually a bit heavier and more robust than other brown ales, but it's still smooth and nutty, as it should be. My favorite Bell's brew yet."
"Pours a slightly fogged ruby hued brown that only gives a small creme head off a firm pour. Nose is very leafy and earthy. Flavor is very full. A lot more vibrant than I had figured it would be. Much more of a sugar-like sweet tone to it. Almost like there was brown sugar thrown in the mix. Feel has a full carbonation and the liquid is well bodied. This is easy to drink. A bit too sweet IMO, but still an enjoyable experience."
"Drinkability: This one really opens up as it warms up. Drinkability is high. One of the better brown ales out there, very well balanced, nothing over the top, but still retains full flavor. Recommended!"
"This is an excellent example of a solid style. Rich and full of smell and flavor, this one goes great on those cold winter nights. One of the best brown ales that I have tried so far. Another winner from Bell's."
"Drinkability: A charming, easy drinking brown from Bell's."
"Mouthfeel displays appropriate thickness yet the finish is slightly waxy/soapy again. A weird brown which displays a well above average flavor delivered with amateurish flair."
"D: Good brew and very drinkable. An easy choice for a session beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied and creamy. Nicely sessionable. Warm and toasty, perfect for cold weather."
"Nice foggy chestnut color with a small creamy head. Sweet, nutty, toffee-like malts and molasses in the nose. Mild flavor, but tasty. Gentle caramel malts and a tiny bit of roasted chocolate in the end. Simple and balanced. Medium-light body. Nice English brown."
"D: Very good. Yay."
"While brown ales are not my favorite style of ale, I am certainly pleased to try another good seasonal from Bell's."
"Pours a deep copper/ amber/ brown, with a small white head. In the aroma, a small sweet malt, but somewhat bland. In the taste, a sweet maltiness, yet quite thin. A smooth mouthfeel and a dry malty aftertaste. A bit sweeter than a standard brown, however not a big nose. Easy to drink and non offensive."
"It is mostly malt in the taste but with a slight hop bitterness on finish. Neither of which is very strong and overall this beer has a weak taste. It also is a little thin but carbonation is decent. This isn't a big brown ale but enough of the beer is done well to make it one to at least try."
"Durable head thats diminishes but doesn't totally leave. Good ""tick"" marks down the glass as it is enjoyed, always a good sign. The nose is hard to decifer, sweet and slightly nutty. Taste initially leans toward the hoppy side (not overly so, just hoppy for the style). A nutty sweetness soon takes over. A good body to it.The aftertaste is tight and and short lived. Would really like to have a few of these in some hole-in-the-wall pub in England somewhere. Highly recommended if you are in search of a good brown ale."
"My only complaint is that I yearn for a bit more maltiness."
"Drinkability: Solid English Brown Ale from Bell's... although not among my favorites for the style."
"Another solid Bell's beer!"
"So much better than in the bottle! Lazy brown color with a head that was rich and creamy and lasted half way through. Aroma of mild juicy caramel malt and restrained nuts and roast. The flavor was slightly fruity with a nice caramel malt middle that finished with more nuts, fruit, and juicy malt. Well balanced - not too sweet, but not too dry either."
"The nose was pretty much undetectable. All in all, a disappointing beer that probably would have tasted better under circumstances. [The following beer was a bottle of BellÂ’s Porter Â– and it was delicious!]"
"Overall, a little boring at first, but it grows on you. Very sessionable and keeping around."
"I dunno, I'm not so impressed with this beer. Although, I've read so many good reviews, I think it must be me. Proly a plugged shnoz or something. Has a hazy brown color. Seems kind of blase to me. Do pick up the typical english brown body and aftertaste. Had a nice head and some lace."
"A strong pour brings a perfect tan head to the top of the glass and almost over the lip. Bodsy is a super dark brown. As the head fades you get crater sized lace spots. Nose has candy sweet notes with soft malt tones and a hint of fresh dough. A very dry mineral richness wakes up the mouth on first sip. Nutty burnt malt rounds out the initial palate. A bit thin on the finish. Does bring about a slight thickness on the mouthfeel after a few sips. Nicely drinkable overall."
"A nice deep brown with a decent head. The smell is a molasses and caramel. The taste is caramel and there is a nice hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is smooth with a lasting aftertaste. Drinkability is good as this is a good beer of the style."
"Drinkability- Very nice drinkability here. A bit overly hoppy for a brown ale, but I'll let that slide on the beer this time. I'm a fan of the hops used and it goes down smooth."
"I poured this beer into a tumbler at 5o degrees. The beer was cloudy brown like dirty water with a thin head fast and fast decay. There was no lacing at all. The beer had a bit of a fruity smell and a slightly bitter taste. I really like the label though but the beer was just average. It was good mind you but I guess I will most likely not buy again."
"This has a nice brown body and the smell is enticing. It has a good heavy malty aroma with some biscuit in there. The flavor is much the same, nice and malty with some biscuit and a good sweetness. There is no detectable hop flavor but some bitterness; just enough to balance. It has good mouthfeel, about medium but the body seems lighter than it should. All around a great example of a Brown Ale."
"Deep amber color with some fairly light tan head that dissolves very quickly. No real lacing. Nose is fairly weak, a little bit of a surprise for a Bell's beer. Just a bit of hops and malt, fairly balanced for an English brown. Taste is solid. Lots of sweet caramel malt, but a nice mix of fairly fruity hops as well. This one's pretty sour too, which is unique to most of the English browns I've had. Feel is medium bodied with good carbonation. I like this one a lot. I've yet to have a Bell's beer that I wasn't impressed at. This one isn't there best, but it's a good beer, a little high in ABV to be sessionable, but definitely one I could drink a bunch of."
"Opinion: Like all of Bells beers, I am not disappointed in this one. It has a good clean flavor that isn't too bold as to be annoying one way or the other. In flavor, it may have more American ingredients, but retains the British balance of flavor...except in the finish where the water is clean enough to leave the palate fresh rather than dry and chalky. This is a pretty good beer, and I wouldn't mind trying it again if the opportunity presented itself."
"Smell of the beer promised more than the taste could offer. Not the best of beers."
"Well rounded beer with a good amount of hoppiness that prevents any chance of excessive sweetness (which might be my only criticism, i.e.needing a little more maltiness). Nicely done."
"A solid brown ale. Much better than Newcastle...looks better, less sweet and very smooth. Pours a dark brown with some ruby highlights, medium size tn head with some lacing. Primary taste is roasted malt, there is enough hops bitterness to kill the annoying sweetness of some brown ales. Mouthfeel is rich and drinkability is very good. A fantastic candidate for a session beer."
"This pours a very thin head that dissapates quickly and leaves no lace on the glass. It is a very dark brown with more carbonation than I usually associate with a brown ale. The smell has hints of a dark brown bread. The taste is smooth and malty with a hint of roasted malts. The alcohol does not come across at all. The mouthfeel is just right, it coats the tongue but, doesn't feel thick. It does not come across as overly carbonated but, there is still more than I expect in a brown ale. This is an excellent brown ale and it stays true to the style. I could drink this all day. This is my ideal ""session"" beer, assuming that someone else will drive me home from the session :)"
"Bottle into tulip glass. A: Cloudy brown with a little orange. Moderate head that went down pretty quick, some lacing. S: Malty with some citrus overtones, canÂ’t detect the presence of hops. T: Strong caramel taste, hops barely make an appearance until the dry, slightly btiter finish. Very clean. M: Moderate carbonation, nice and smooth. D: A deceptively simple, very tasty, crisp-and-clean brown ale. Really enjoyable and easy to drink."
"Dark amber/brown color with full tan head that leaves a tan lace on the glass. Smells sweet and of roasted malts. Taste is also of roasted malts with a slight bitterness to it. Feels somewhat thick and smooth in the mouth with just a bit of tingle. A nice beer from New Belgium. Definitely worth having (often)."
"D: Well, this wasn't as good as I recall, the previous one had a lot more character, but a solid brown nontheless."
"This is a pretty light beer with lots of carbonation. Despite its mild taste, this is highly drinkable. Not my favorite beer at all, but still good and definitely worthy of a session."
"The beer pours a nice brown color with a 1/2"" tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful bisquit scent that blends well with the burnt toffee crystal malt aroma. It has a toastey feel. The taste is good also. It has a roasted malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes toastey and dry with some bisquity qualities. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking brown ale. I'm a real sucker for brown ales that are dry and bisquity."
"RecommendedÂ…"
"D- Not really a session beer in my book, but a worthwhile beer to try."
"Could drink a few of these not much more,not a bad beer just nothing to get excited about."
"Brown body with red highlights to it.The tan head stood for a couple minutes then fell.I really cant smell anything from the beer.The taste is malty and and taste like Tea.the tea tatse is probally the malts and I dont taste any hop flavor at all.The mouthful is creamy and very smooth, carbonation is very inviting.I dont think this is Bells beer by far from looking at the reviews so I didnt expect a ""Outstanding"" beer but its very solid none the less.Nice job Bells!"
"Appears a medium brown color with a finger of light tan head. Smells of nuts, caramel malts, and fruity hops. Tastes of sweet caramel malt, tree nuts, a hint of cocoa, and pleasantly bitter, floral hops. Medium in both body and carbonation. This brown ale drinks very smoothly and certainly does not show it's leaning towards almost 7% ABV."
"Pours a simple brown color with amber highlights and a creamy, rocky cream colored head that leaves some good sticky lacing to the end. Aromas of dark sweet fruit, nutty malt, and raisons. The echoes the nose with fruity to nutty malt backbone and nice spice that's reminiscent of nutmeg or cinnamon. Really good floral hop esters that fade somewhat towards the bottom. Cocoa powder lurks in the background and is more detectable in the finish along with short lived dryness and some tart dark fruit notes. Thin body and medium carbonation leaves a slightly watery mouthfeel and fizzy edge. Richer malt flavor picks up as it warms with a bigger emphasis on roasted nut character."
"Verdict: like eating a caramel apple. Brewed close enough to style to be called a brown, but more fruity and tangy than most I have had."
"Pours out a darker brown than I remember, almost mahogany in color. Not much head, but what's there is nice and creamy. Good retention, as well. The aroma consists mostly of dark roasted malt notes, maybe a little banana(?). A little nutty, too. Upon tasting, the nuttiness and a bready flavor comes through. Nice bitter finish, balancing nicely. Finely carbonated and pleasant in the mouth. Goes down pretty easily, as well. Overall, this is just a good beer. Nothing real spectacular, just Good."
"-Oelergud"
"Mouthfeel was smooth, however, the swallow revealed robust carbonation. Medium to light body. This is not one I would seek out again, but brown ales are not one of my favorite styles."
"Purchased at John's Grocery, Iowa City, IA"
"I found this beer to be quite lacking in flavor, a completely worthless review by me (sorry!) and at a loss for words. It'll score better than other (bad) beers I've had, but only because those beers actively sucked for one reason or another. This one had nothing discernibly bad to make it repugnant. Average, average, average."
"D - An excellent sipping beer, but I wouldn't want more than maybe two."
"Fresh bottle enjoyed a few hours ago. Pours a slightly cloudy brownish, red. Faint yellow highlights in a few spots. You can see a bit of sediment floating around. Fluffy white head that didn't hang around for long and left a bit of lace around the glass. Good lookin beer. Aroma is a tad faint, but sweet and malty. I wish there was ust a little bit more pronounced malt aroma. This beer tastes great though. Not amazing, but really really good. Super smooth mouthfeel lets the toasty malt flavor cover your pallate. There's a faint fruit flavor as well, can't put my finger on it. No stringency whatsoever. A really good session beer. Drinkability is perfect. What a brown ale should be."
"In the mouth this brew is full bodied with a creaminess to it. Lower carbonation levels are well within the boundaries for this style's accepted profile. All-in-all this is a great brew that I could drink all night long. I recommend this brew to anyone who just wants to kick back and drink a good brew. I'll definitely be buying this one again next time I see it. Its a good anytime beer, perfect with lunch."
"Drinkability is high here because of the nice flavor and the low abv."
"I poured this twelve ounce bottle into a pint glass. As usual with Bell's this beer pours a strong head. It forms a rocky looking surface and the melts in on itself, for a slight head for the rest of the ride. It is a beautiful amber in color with an off white head. I was expecting a bit more malt character in the nose and taste of the beer, but solid none the less. A bit more hop flavor than I expected from the style but not out of order. Low in sweetness, with a solid backbone of both hop aroma and bitterness. For 6.6% there is no trace of additional alcohol. Overall a solid beer."
"Pours a two finger light tan head that fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy amber color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Slight malty nose. Starts sweet with caramel overtones, becomes more balanced with smooth finish but somewhat bitter aftertaste. $1.89 for a 12oz bottle from Chalet Party Goshen, In."
"(Batch 7723, bottled Nov. 15 2006)"
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a brownish/red color, with an off-white head. Lacing is pretty good. It smells like toasted malt and nuts. It tastes the same way, except for some caramel and breadiness in the taste, along with a bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is light/medium, with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's good, smooth and easy to drink, and I think it would be a decent choice as a session beer. Another good beer from Bell's!"
"Not the best brown ale i've ever had, but not the worst either, i prefer a fuller malt presense."
"12 oz. with some code on the back - checking the website tells me it was packaged on 9/26/06. It pours an unfiltered deep copper/rust with medium carbonation and a half-inch of yellowed-tan head that leaves light lacing. The bouquet consists of light, toasted malts, chocolate?, and green/piney hops which seem almost oily on the palate. It tastes essentially the same, but with a low bitterness and, although the flavor is a bit mild, it leaves a medium finish on top of a medium and tingly body. Overall an easy to drink brown, but could be more complex."
"Drinkability - this is decent, far from great, but decent enough to drink, and so somewhat sessionable."
"I have had a number of english browns I was never really impressed with, but this is the first time I have actually enjoyed a beer of this style. This is well worth trying!"
"Although I prefer most American browns to British Browns, I really like this beer. Well made, and very drinkable. Nice representation of the ""restrained"" british style of brewing. Nothing sticks out as being incredible, but I think that's the point. Well balanced and easy drinking, I say once again.... I am VERY happy that Bell's is now in Virginia!"
"Overall: Good, but not great. From Bell's and the name of the beer, I actually expected more."
"Definitely a very drinkable beer. Would make for a great session. Glad I went out of my way to get this beer, it is pretty solid."
"Drinkability- This beer is very drinkable. I wish the taste were a bit more complex or bold but it is very pleasant throughout. Good Brew."
"Definately an English brown, as it's a mellow tasting beer. I don't know what's ""best"" about this. I don't get much complexity of flavor, just some nice chocolate malts. It's nice beer, don't get me wrong, I just wouldn't invest in a 6'er. It is a nice stepup from Newcastle, however. Give it to a friend as a gateway beer."
"Poured out of bottle into a pint glass, beer is really more of a deep crimson-amber color than brown. Beer had a very nice overflowing off white four finger head, with small amounts of lacing. Smell is of caramel and nutty chocolate. The taste is exceptional; pleasing with a malty start, perfectly balanced with a slightly hoppy and smooth finish. Never offensive throughout the taste, wonderfully balanced. The mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy and delightful. Overall I would have to say that this is an extremely drinkable beer and have to toast this one to Bells!"
"The mouth is medium-bodied and well carbonated, with enough complexity to keep it interesting. It is very drinkable, not overly sweet. A solid example of the style and overall brew."
"Pours a hazy red/brown, thick tan head, settles to a ring, nice lacing and great retention, head really sticks. Smell is sweet, toffee, grains, roasty chocolate, very rich flavour, little bit of floral. Taste is toffee and chocolate, grainy, some floral and citrus in the finish, nice roasted dry finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, very smooth and enjoyable. A nice brown ale. Thanks biegaman!"
"Rich flavors without getting trashed sold me on this beer. Like I've said in the past I usually don't get down with drinking darker beers just for the sake of drinking, but I could certainly make an exception for this beer."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable and goes down well."
"The taste more than makes up for the lackluster appearance and near lack of smell. Nice burnt caramel flavor with some bready notes. Quite nutty. Sweet malty heaven. The aftertaste fades away very quickly leaving only a hint of a nutty, bready finish. Very quaffable. I'm going to enjoy drinking this often."
"Pours with bounteous head that would becalm into mere bubbles. A sort of glowing, umber colour. I couldn't see my finger through the other side. Aroma with cola-root beer like properties, smells sticky and syropy. Lots of hops too though. Taste far more subtle that aroma. Mouthfeel rounds out nicely, leaving a caramely roast. A lot of malts come through on the finish too. Not so much light nor dark malts, the sort of in between ones - not nearly roasty - maybe 'toasty'. Smooth and very enjoyable to drink. A well made American style brown ale. Thanks HogTownHarry."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink with enough character to make this generally insipid style interesting"
"D: This beer would be great as a session beer. It is smooth and easy to drink. Flavorful, but not overpowering. I only picked up a single bottle, and when I finished, I wished I had bought a sixer. However, given a choice between this and Bell's Porter, I'd go for the porter every time."
"D- This beer doesn't have a lot of flavor and the malt notes are pretty soft but the hops, all though soft, have a bright fresh flavor."
"D - Not something I would drink all night. Also A bit off for the style."
"Overall, nothing too exciting, but it is a solid, very well done brown ale."
"Smells of a malt bisquit, and has lackluster mouth appeal and the only reason I'm drinking more than one is because I had to buy six."
"Overall a pleasant and interesting brown ale. A solid brew."
"A pretty good brown from Bell's, I will drink this again."
"This is reminiscent of the Hacker-Pschorr that I just reviewd but encumbered with beer-nuts and I do mean cajones. Dense as a Polaroid picture and brown gravy and rye. Hack off some marble cheddar and hot pepper jack and make yourself a feast of post-fermentables and livestock. Please put away your virgins though because Moloch reigns supreme here."
"Thumbs up to drinking this one. It'd make a nice Friday evening growler brew. I'd definitely drink this if I had more access to it on a regular basis."
"Bottom line: yet again, a solid effort from Bell's. Worth a try."
"Wow, what a great looking brown! I wasn't as impressed with the taste as the smell and appearance. Medium bodied with nice malts just a bit of alcohol thunder to it. This was a pretty good one though, brown sugar and spices! A very filling and drinkable brown, with all kinds of spices floating around in the glass. Worth a shot or two!"
"the beer is brown. i believe it is also an ale. so far so good. billowing head and a nice reddish brown. i wish the malt aroma were a little stronger; a nice earthy hop aroma, but the malt doesn't play a huge role, as it does in the flavor. very smooth; very balanced with a slight roasted whisper"
"A single bottle from a make-your-own-six-pack purchased at the Bell's general store. Brown with yeasty protein floaties and a small head. sweet, almost fruity malt and toffee smell. Pretty inviting. Mmmmm. this is a tasty beer. no massive amounts of anything, just some sweet toasty malt and balanced hops and a smooth mouthfeel. Very nice. Only complaint is a slight excess of carbonation. Glad i bought one because now i know its worth buying a whole six pack."
"D - Intensely quaffable. I think I drank 3/4 of it before stopping to think and take notes. A beer that I could drink every night and not be disappointed."
"Very easy drinking brown, good session ale IMO, a good brown. My 1st beer from bell's, pretty nice"
"The body is mid to high. Good dextrin flavors. Carbonation is light but overall a good beer indeed."
"Bottle purchased at the old brewery about 2 weeks ago. Bright copper color, with a small head. Very apparent oxidation in the nose; lots of sherry and wet cardboard, with light malts, honey....etc...but not much besides oxidation. Oxidation is less present in the flavor, thankfully, which I usually tend to experience in my tasting. Honey and dark malt flavors. The oxidation ruined the beer. I wouldnÂ’t rate it, except that I purchased it the brewery a week or so ago."
"Lingering soupiness on the mouth drags down mouthfeel, but quite smooth and pleasingly weighted on the tongue. This sixer won't go down particularly easily, but then again brown ale is one of my least favorite styles."
"Pours a medium to dark brown with a tinge of red and a thin, tan head that quickly goes away. The first smell gives the impression of sweetness and the taste delivers on that, with a good malty character all the way through and then a small taste of hops as well for the finish. The taste is very balanced, with nothing dominating the palate. It feels light and smooth in the mouth and is generally very tasty. A good, relaxed beer that doesn't overpower, and definitely pleases."
"overall very tasty and an easy drinker."
"12 ounce bottle. Bell's Brown Ale pours out a dark amber color with a medium sized head. The aroma is toasted malt, fruits (especially grapes), and floral hops. Nutty, spicy flavor. Not as malty as I expected, but the maltiness is definitely there. Toffee flavor, but not overly sweet. There is a bit of an acidic twang in the middle. The finish is hoppy and bitter. This beer has a creamy mouthfeel, which I really enjoyed. Drinkability is good too. This is a fine example of the Brown ale style."
"A must try!"
"I wanted to like this beer because I like Bell's and I like brown ales, but there's really nothing here to separate from the masses of mediocre brown ales. Not sufficiently distinct or satisfying to warrant drinking again unless it were free or there were no better alternatives."
"Pours a deep and intense amber color with a finger of off-white head that falls to a full coat over top. Nose is nutty and caramel, with just a hint of roasted malt. I'd even like to see a bit more nutty character to this one. Flavor is working well. Very solid nutty character, with a moderate caramel sweetness and just a light edge of roast. Pretty nice English brown. Feel is moderate with a carbonation on the lighter end of moderate. Bell's always seems to hit things pretty well with their brews. This one satisfies, thought I really would like a stronger roasted character. Not that it detracts from the brew, but it keeps it from what it could be."
"D: Very pleasing in all aspects and quite easy to drink."
"This is an exceedingly good brown ale. The taste is not complicated, just really, really good. Proof that you dont need anything other than great basic ingredients to make great beer."
"Notes: Not a bad beer as far as brown ales go but it doesn't do anything to make me go out and buy it again. I am glad I tried it but I think I am still on the quest to find the perfect bottled brown ale."
"Chocolate cabinet brown with creamy head, fresh leaving lace in glass. Caramel, a touch of graininess and roasted barley and molasses and licorice in aroma and in taste. Very easy drink, understated hoppiness and maltiness so just some bitterness and sweetness. Some of each in aftertaste, but more sweet. Creamy mouthfeel. Good example of this style. Thanks Dr. Jay."
"Pours a cloudy dark brown with a 1/4"" tan head. Sweet nutty malts and mild hop bitterness in the aroma. The taste is dominated my the nutty malts and balanced out perfectly with a mild hop bitterness. This is one smooth beer. Feels creamy in the mouth. It's also warming and filling. This is a very drinkable session beer that would be one of my regulars if it was available in NC. Many thanks go out to Dertbert for providing me this excellent brown ale."
"Brown beer with a reddish hue, the dark cream coloured head was very fine and showed a bit of lace. Malty aroma, some nuttiness with a bit of toffee. Same in the flavour along with mild bitterness and muted hop flavour towards the end. Bitterness really lingers in the finish. Dry overall, medium-light bodied and decent texture. A solid brown ale."
"D: Okay beer, could drink a bunch in a sitting, but would probably pick another brown ale, if I had a choice. I might revisit this one to double check my thoughts on it when Sam Smith's Nut Brown isn't my most recent beer memory."
"I really had a tough time finding this beer, but finally got my hands on a sixer. Pours a hazy brown/dark cooper in color. Nice tan head that gives way to good amount of lacing. At the beginning you taste sweet roasted malt. Its has a balance amount of hops. It's finish is dry.I edit my review of this beer after drinking this beer a few time and having a few other brown's under my belt. This beer is just a bit over done for my taste in what a brown should be. To me it borders on being more like a porter than a brown ale."
"A 12 oz bottle poured into mug, pours a copper brown with good head lasting a few minutes, shrinking to a thin film for a while, then nothing, with little lacing, mostly following rim of liquid. Aroma, though I found it subtle and hard to define, is nice and of malts, chocolate and toffee, and maybe some brown sugar. Taste is of malts, with chocolate and toffee and brown sugar. The middle has that typical brown ale as I swallow, and has one of the better aftertaste I've observed, smooth and fading to nuts. Nicely carbonated, good body, though a tiny bit pasty halfway through. Forget the session beer ABV cut off at 5%... I'd drink this beer all night long."
"THE BLOODHOUND FACTOR: Due to the subtle nose, neither hound was immediately interested. Peaches tasted it, and decided she could take it or leave it. Benji didn't even seem interested."
"Bought a mixed case of Bell's while visiting the folks, seeing as I can't get it in Boston. The brown is pretty solid. A nice, dirty, rusty brown amber color holds up a decent head which leaves a thin layer of foam on top for quite some time. Smells of lightly roasted malts under a nice array of nutty, carmelly, brown sugar aromas. Taste is solid, but perhaps a little bland compared to the smell. Still interesting enough though. All of the nutty, carmel characters mix nicely with a definate English style hop profile, mellow and spicy. Perhaps just a tad thin or watery around the edges, but nothing too much to complain about, this is a good beer."
"Drinkability- This beer would be could for a couple of sessions."
"Drinkability: The beer is a smooth drinker and great for sessions. It is also moderate in terms of alcohol content, so you can really hand out with a friend...say..over a game of chess, or maybe some Dead or Alive 3, or maybe play Bach fugues and preludes...and still drink lots of them."
"This is my second English brown ale and I like it. Another great offering from Kalamazoo Brewing Company!! Keep up the great work."
"A very approachable and sessionable Brown that hop heads will enjoy."
"Definitely worth a try."
"This brew pours a solid brown color with amber hues around the edges. The head is creamy and white with speckles of tan. The aroma is of roasted malt, chocolate, and nuts. The taste is sweet and nutty. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall, this brew lives up to its name, as it truely is the best brown ale I have had."
"On tap at MoJoe Lounge in Easton. Clear dark brown color with a medium tan head and thin sticky lacing. Sweet toasted malt and caramel aroma. Medium, smooth body with dominant malt flavoring. Sweet caramel and a bit of hops and coffee is also present. The finish is roasty and sweet at times. A great session beer that is enjoyable all around."
"Overall: Not mind-blowing, but a very, very good brown ale that definitely has a legitimate claim to calling itself ""Best."""
"taste of roasted malty sweetness and some nuts, balanced with a bit of hops, but they don't stand out very much - they just give it some life. This is a real warm, friendly drinker. If I were to rate it within its category, I would say its one of the best brown ales (no pun intended). Maybe I have had better beers, but I still really enjoy this one."
"Overall, another impressive product from Kalamazoo. As I've said, browns are far from my favorites. But this one has to be up there among my preferred representatives of the style. Malty, a bit hoppy and nutty, with a good amount of bite. Good job."
"Well, I wont be buying this again...definately the most boring Bell's ive had"
"Good balance between the bitter and sweet flavors. An an enjoyable and highly drinkable brown."
"Smell is pretty faint, with just a touch of caramel, brown sugar, and must. Taste is again rather muted, and reminscent of an Oktoberfest, in that it's all caramel malts and mustiness. Does have a subtle toasted finish. Hugely fluffy mouthfeel owing to the crazy carbonation. Completely lacks the roasted, nutty, baby-porter/stout characteristics I like in a good brown ale. Nothing much to see here--it may be Bell's Best Brown, but it's hardly the best brown overall."
"Overall a fantastic and original interpretation of the style. I'm very pleased with the spiciness & dryness, which it 'different' from the others in this style. Balanced and masterful. Autumn just isn't the same without Bell's Best Brown."
"Pours a mahogany/amber with a one-finger tan head and decent lacing. Smell is nice and sweetly malty, caramely and nutty. Taste starts off with the strong caramel malts, some brown sugar, cinnamon, and an alcoholic bite at the end that made me think this was stronger than it is (though at 5.75 it's still stronger than most english browns). Mouthfeel is smooth and light-bodied but not watery. Overall this was a tasty little brown. Probably the most flavorful ""English Brown"" that I've had, even though this is an American rendition. Reminded me fondly of New Glarus' Fat Squirrel and Big Sky Moose Drool."
"Smooth and very easy to drink."
"This is a good beer, and a fine representation of the style, although I imagine a sweeter version would be even better. Still, it's an interesting beer. Recommended."
"This beer is slightly drying to the mouth, so I'm not sure I'd want more than one or two, but they'd definitely be enjoyable."
"This is a rich-tasting brown, not what you'd expect if you are used to Newcastle or Smuttynose Brown Dog. It's a little dry, with tastes of caramel and coffee. The head was rich and foamy, but not overly, mustache-inducing foamy. A little more sweetness would have been nice to balance things out and make it more drinkable (I felt a small tinge of drinking fatigue by the end of my pint), but this is still a nice beer and yes, I did want another."
"The second I popped the cap, a big earthy aroma started to pour out from the bottle. Lots of roasted malts and very nutty. Nice appearance as well. Medium brown color which I could surprisngly see my fingers thru on the other side of the glass. Great light-tan head. Lively carbonation keeps the head in tact for the duration of the beer. A simple swirl of the beer brings it back to life instantly. The taste is very nutty. After taking a sip, my mouth feels and tastes like I just ate a peanut. Slight hop bitterness in the aftertaste, yet very drinkable for a brown ale. True to the style and certainly unique, worth a try for any brown ale fan."
"This is a very nice beer and quite true to style. Big toasted malt character both in the aroma and flavor. Bittersweet chocolate, caramel, toffee, and a low roasted flavor. Ripe fruits of figs and dates fill the nose and palate. Nicely heavy and creamy on the palate. Nice brown / amber color, almost opaque. Low hop flavor and bitter that adds to complexity. A little more estery than I expect from both hop flavor and sweet alcohol. Finishes lightly malty and lingering. Go get one."
"I mean, I guess I could drink a few, but if my review wasn't any indication, I wouldn't be too excited to."
"Reddish-brown in color with a thick foam of tight bubbles. A sweet, malty aroma with some fruity esters. The flavor begins with a creamy, malty, chocolatey taste followed by a slightly dry, hoppy aftertaste. This medium-bodied ale has just enough hop bitterness in the aftertaste to balance the whole beer out."
"As for brown ales, I've easily had better. This is just run of the mill. There's no way this can be their ""best."""
"The beer is very easy to drink and fairly mild overall. An easy session beer for sure."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a chewy palate. Definetly on the heavy side for a brown ale but I enjoy it that way. I could easily have a few of there..but there are other Bell's brews I'd probably pick first. Definetly worth a try. Thanks to kmpitz2 for hooking me up!"
"Mouthfeel is medium nice amount of carbonation. Drinkability is good overall a nice little english brown ale"
"Overall- just too sweet for me. Nice nutty, caramelly, woddsiness but made my cheeks hurt. I'll pass on this next time."
"Pours a brownish red with a two-inch head that dissipated into nice layer on top of the beer. Bottle had a ton of sediment at the bottom and some is still floating in my beer. Not sure if this is good or bad. The store I buy from turns over inventory quickly and I have no reason to believe the sediment is abnormal for this unfiltered brew. Smells is a bit soapy, with a slight leather aroma as well. Taste is a bit subdued but still has that nice nutty, English toffee aftertaste like a good brown ale should. Mouthfeel is fine. Drinkable but not overly so."
"Pours a murky coppery brown color with a tan colored head. Definitelt unfiltered. Slightly nutty quality to the aroma, with a light grassiness and some biscuit and caramel-like maltiness. Medium bodied. Residual sweetness is cut nicely with a lightly bitter finish. Trace amounts of diacetyl, which is fine. A nicely balanced brown ale that's easy to drink."
"Very drinkable for smoothness and flavor, maybe a bit strong for session drinking."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"This beer poured a clear, deep red-brown chestnut color with creamy, tan foam that persisted and clung to the inside of the glass and coated it. The smell was malty with notes of caramel and a bit of hops. The taste was rich and malty with a bit of caramel and a nice hoppiness to balance the malt, and beneath the malt was a light fruitiness. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium body and moderate carbonation. This was a great brown ale, and seemed very much like a German altbier to me. Thanks to feloniousmonk for this one."
"This is one I keep in my fridge for year round drinking. A great ""go-to"" beer."
"Drinkability and Overall: This is very nice tasting beer, but the yeast is overboard. Too much. This is a problem that needs fixed. Other than that I loved the flavor of the beer, and it smelled among the best. Hopefully this is just a bad bottle."
"Hazy, dark shoe-leather brown with a small, creamy, khaki head and decent lacing. Aromas of mild brown sugar, caramelized fruit, toasted malt, and yeast. Toasted loaf malt flavors up front. Light nuttiness, mixed with some dried pears also noticeable. Earthy, spicy hops come on stronger than expected and add a pleasant kick to this brew. Finish is bitter with light toasted fruit sweetness, and yeast. Nice. Medium-bodied, coats the mouth well. Another winner from Bell's."
"Final Thought: My first English Brown Ale was a success, what more could you ask from this first-rate brewery... proud to be an American!"
"It poured a deep brown, mildly hazy with some ruby highlights. There was just a hint of a tan colored head, but the beer leaves a light lace on the side of the glass as I drink. The aroma is dominated by malt. A mild roast aroma up front with slight candy hints on the finish of the aroma. Great balance of roasted malt and sweetness in the flavor. Based on the nose, I was expecting a dominance of roast flavor. It has a surprising balance of roast and sweetness (50/50 all the way). The hops show up on the finish, just there to brighten the flavor a little. This beer has the same velvety mouth feel IÂ’ve had in other Bell products. I canÂ’t wait to try the Double Cream Stout. That will be a smooth mouth feel. A very drinkable beer. A very nice tribute to this style."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I would rank this one up with any other EBA that I have had. Deep brown color, that is murky and slightly maroon. Smell is nutty malt and hoppy, reminiscent of hazelnuts. Taste is very malt and full, again very nutty, like a EBA should be. Versus the style, i think this is almost the perfect beer."
"Not a bad brown, in fact, it's pretty damn solid. Consumed with pride and pleasure. A step, at least, above the rest."
"poured reddish brown with little head.aroma, malts ,choc. caramel. flavor dark chocolate like the kind that covers a chocolate covered cherry, molasses. got a nice sweetness and a little bit of a bite at the end. had nice mouth feel bells does it again for me"
"This beer looked and smelled so good. I liked the fruitiness but was a little turned off by the astringency."
"A friend brought over a sixer of this to watch some Trailer Park Boys on BBC. Although not my favorite style what kind of BA would i be if i didn't try one? It pours a solid brown with a rocky slightly off white head which has excellent retention and leaves a nice lacing all the way down the glass. Aroma is rich with a malty nuttiness. Taste was a bit chocolatey and nutty. A bit of wit-like spiciness comes through in the finish as well as something that I can only describe as the Bell's ""house flavor."" Fairly decent beer and the six pack was finished off in very little time. A solid beer."
"This beer pours a cloudy dark copper/bonze with a minimal tan head, but with good lace effect. The nose is of sweet caramel and tofee, and these repeat in the flaor. It is an almost chewable heavy brew with good notes in the finish - almost candy-like. a good all-around drinkable brew."
"Bell's Brewery continues to grow on me. Brown ale is an often overlooked style that is sometimes short on excitement, but Bell's Best Brown is phenomenal stuff and has impressed me to no end."
"Thanks to the MonkyFeloniousOne for supplying this Bell Ringer of a Brown!!"
"Poured a somewhat muddy brown color with a nice tight head.Good aroma of malt with great chocolate and caramel notes-a hint of hazelnut?Great flavor-toasted malt,slightly bready.Nice lingering bitterness.Decent mouthfeel.A very drinkable beer-I really like the aroma.Could see this being my regular everyday brew.Enjoy."
"Thanks to CRJMellor for another kick-ass trade!"
"I went through a phase this winter in which this was my ""regular everyday type"" beer. Pours a very nice cloudy medium brown, with a one-finger thick, fluffy tan head. The head diminishes somewhat quickly, but sticks around enough to leave some nice lacing on the glass. Smells sweet, with very nice malt aromas coming forth. Tastes nicely of sweet, toasted malt, with some hints of carmel and perhaps a bit nutty. Smooth and easy drinking, this is a very enjoyable beer. Overall a very nice beer which I would definitely recommend."
"Pours a deep auburn, copper cloudy liquid with an off-white foamy head. The head disappeared quickly, and there was little lacing on the glass. Smells of toasted malt, not much else. Taste of sweetness, followed by a slight roasted caramel flavor. No bitterness. Medium body, nice amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink, very little bitterness at all. Good offering by Bell's. I suppose I would have enjoyed a deeper toasted/roasted flavor, but this one was good."
"12 oz bottle, no dating on bottle. NIce soft amber color with an off white head, leaves some lace. Pleasant doughy/malty aroma. Malty/bready flavor profile. Nutty, hints of rye, biscuits, almonds and oatmeal cookies. Moderate hops round things off. This is another tasty offering from Bells. My wife brought a mixed six pack back from Michigan, each beer has been tasty! Wish I could get more of these guy's brews here in NY state."
"A fine winter offering from Bell's."
"Yup. The 12 oz bottle with the inquisitive owl on the label. This is one of the few reviews I've written without knowing anything about the beer, or reading other reviews. It pours a muddy, dark, iced tea color with a tan head that likes to hang around and mingle, and sheds some lasting, patchy lacing. Nice aroma of dates, and a few other dark fruits....followed up by a shower of floral hops and some soothing pecan pralines. Wow...! Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, nutty, well carbonated, and has a mild hop bite. Taste is out of this solar system. Bittersweet spices smeared onto some banana nutbread, chocolate fudge, some smoked kalamata olives, and some pleasant bittering floral hops. Geeez..I wasn't expecting much to write about here, but this one has blown me off the planet. Beautiful and complex, it finishes with a bitter cocoa taste accompanied with a touch of mandarin orange rind burn. Also, there is a smoky, wood aged feel that is difficult to explain, but adds to the surprisingly noble character to this Bell's offering. Wow!"
"Very drinkable but no world-shaker. They can't all be."
"Drinkability: This would go great with a big chunk of roasted beast, or just sit back and have a few. This is a very well crafted beer. The only thing I would have liked is a bit more presence in the nose."
"Dark, slightly cloudy amber hue, thick clumpy tannish head, retains and sticks in patterns. A very clean nose, some caramel and malts notes. Up front, a great mixture in tastes of nutty, caramel and syrup/sticky molasses. Medium bodied, very creamy, and slick at the same time. Biscuitty, toasty, perhaps some deep roasted malts tucked away. Rather mild and tame, nothing jumps at ya', decent mouthfeel, overall a pretty solid brown, a good go-to-brew."
"If you're looking for Bell's, buy the Expedition Stout instead."
"Hell yeah! Beer number two in my Bell's adventure, thanks to feloniousmonk!"
"Not a bad little beer. Definitely one of the better brown ales out there...actually has flavor! This is one that I'd have again in the future."
"The beer pours a foggy burnished copper color with a huge head. Creamy in consistency with a light tan color, Sweet malt with a hint of walnuts, crisp and clean nose, with the start nicely malted and somewhat sweet, top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is apparrent in its acidity; hops are pleasing and spicy, slightly tart and dry aftertaste, quite tasty.. but that aftertaste.. is like all the other Bell's beer... Is it the water??"
"Sampled 10/17/03"
"The beer pours a foggy burnished copper color with the head dinosauric in size, creamy in consistency and a beauteous light tan in color, as it unhurriedly evaporates the lace forms a thick and glutinous sheet upon the glass. Sweet malt with a hint of walnuts, crisp and clean nose, with the start nicely malted and somewhat sweet, top is moderate in its feel to the palate. Finish is stern in its acidity; hops are pleasing and spicy, slightly tart and dry aftertaste, quite tasty."
"Drinkability: Mediocre for the BellÂ’s lineup but one of the most intriguing brown ales I have taste at the same time, save room for their Two Hearted Ale now thatÂ’s a session ale."
"What a very good interpretation of the brown ale style. Pours out to a very, cloudy brownish, amber in the glass. The aroma is that of baking bread, light yeast and malted milk balls. The taste is wonderfully malty and hoppy without either taking over. Incredible balance. Very slightly sweet with a light fruit taste present, but not overly so. I enjoy this beer and recommend drinking it on a cold, autumn evening."
"A decent tasting beer. Flavorful, as are nearly all offerings from Kalamazoo Brewing, Best Brown is one of the better brown ales around. Worth the time to check it out. Brought two home."
"Solid Brownie here."
"ng"
"Good, balanced beer. Appearance as avertised, decent head, some retention. Good balance, slightly towards the bitter. Almost reminds me of a darker IPA (like Indiga). Bell's beers tend to be very flavorful (the one's I've experienced), and this is no exception. Another one I'd probably buy regularly if it was available down here. Thanks, Al."
"Drinkability: A nice quaffer. I liked it, but wasn't overly excited."
"Poured a deep mahogany with plenty of visible yeast. Smells malty but subdued and not overpowering. The taste agrees with the scent, nice nutty and sweet malt without being too much. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy and drinkability is fantastic. A great brown ale, and the best I've had yet."
"Pours a murky brown with a decent off white head that leaves some light lacing,smell is of roasted malt with a light sour smell in the background(Iam not sure where that comes from) with some light chocolate hints.Nice flavorful beer with a nice roasted malty taste with some underlying earth tones that keep it from being to sweet.A nice beer drink it each time I go home to Michigan when given the chance."
"Poured a dark brown color with a small tan head that left quickly. Smell was quite nice of toffee and caramel and some roasted nut flavor. The taste was somewhat similar to the smell except for a mouth-puckering astringent flavor that came and stayed in my mouth for the duration of the drink. I don't know if this batch was spoiled by something but the flavor could have been really good had that flavor not been so prevalent. I'm going to try this again at a later time."
"This beer was a murky brown color. It looked kind of like tea. A creamy off white head simmered down to a thin sheet. What a great aroma, a mixture of sweet malt, toffee, dates, and caramel. Taste wasn't bad but not near as good as the aroma. The taste starts with roasted malts which is followed by a bread flavor along with a nutty caramel. Towards the finish there is a a sweet/sour taste. Sort of different, not bad. This beer is great up until the finish which just threw me off a little. A nice creamy smooth mouthfeel. Definately a drinkable brew."
"Overall, a good brown ale with a detracting sour flavor and aroma. I'd like to give this one a try again from a different batch."
"This brew has a very nice malty aroma with a light head that disappeared before I could take my first taste. It was lightly carbonated with a caramel taste. It has a nice light brow transparent color and left a good lacing on the glass. ANother fine brew from Bells!"
"I think this is one of the better brown ales and should definately be tried by all. It has a real nice appearance in its brown nutty color. Its on the verge of being a little red. I like the head on it. It sticks around and leaves a fair share of lacing all the way down to the bottom. It has a nice hoppy aroma to it. I've had this beer in a bottle and on tap. I noticed that whenever I have it on tap it seems that I pick up more on a spice flavor almost like a nutmeg, something you'd find in a good christmas brew. Really nice. It has good carbonation, quite a bit actually. A few of these will do you well after a hard day at work."
"I found this to be quite an interesting Brown Ale; not the best I've had, but right up there for the style. Poured it into my glass, a bubbly chestnut brown beer with a moderate, quickly-fading head. Great aroma of peanuts (nuts in general) and a thick bready malt aroma. Quite complex as well in flavor! Nuts, caramel, and a wallop of toffee start things off, finishing with a mild but still tasty hop note. Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated, but is very well done and balances well. A great brew, and well worth a try. Can't wait to get some more Bell's beers!"
"This beer pours a wonderful murky brown color with a small and uneven head that dies off quickly. It has a lot of little floaty things in it, which I am not used to with brown ales. The aroma reminds me of some type of nut - but I cannot figure out exactly what kind - and also malts. The taste is fairly smooth, but slightly watered down tasting - weird because it tastes watered down, but still has a rich flavor. Reminds me a lot of a chocolate stout because the taste has a very strong coffee/chocolate finish to it. This is not your typical brown ale. Not so sure I like this one. Of course, Bells brewery is not one of my favorites ... but I'm still looking for their shining one to make me change my mind - this just isn't that one. This is a decent beer, but I don't think it stacks up to other browns that I've had."
"Sweet, caramel flavors, leaves thick layered lacing down the glass. The mouthfeel is not as heavy as I thought and quite smooth. An appreciable hop finish, which I didn't detect at all in the aroma, balances out this fine beer. Taking into account the varied tastes of the full cross-section of beer drinkers out there, this will come across as drinkable to a large percentage of them."
"Pours a deep brown with a good head that lasts for minutes. The nose has aromas of butterscotch, caramel, burnt sugar, and roasted malt. The flavor is more bitter than the nose. This deep brown ale tastes of malt, semi-sweet chocolate, and bitter hops. Good mouth feel, comes across the tongue smooth and finishes slightly dry. Great brown ale, Bell's Best Brown is a fitting name."
"Thick and hazy brown body, topped by a creamy, mountainous off-white head. Chocolate mingles with herbal hops in the nose. The taste is somewhat like making chocolate milk, using skim milk, and adding hops sufficient to tingle but not overwhelm the rest of the beverage. A somewhat strange description for a really fine beer. Not a style that attracts much interest, not one of the Bell's beers that generates a lot of buzz, but a brew I can heartily recommend."
"Thick amberish brown is the liquid. Tons of chunks float about. A small but thick head is ok, but a little disappointing. The aroma is pleasant; nutty/toasty/caramel...and this translates pretty directly to the flavors of the beer. And an awesome bitter kick finishes the beer off, a very awesome surprise for a brown ale. It's no Sammy Smith's Nut Brown, but it's an awesome beer in it's own uniqueness."

"If there is a beer equivalent of ""comfort food"" - this is it. Brownish amber color with light tan head that quickly faded. Aroma of Hershey's chocolate milk wafts from the glass. Pronounced milk chocolate notes in the flavor, with deeply toasted malt flavors. For all the chocolate character, the beer was surpisingly moderate in sweetness and finished with a sharp bitterness that cleared the palate. This is a fairly subtile beer, and if you were drinking a variety of beers during a session, this would be the lead-off."
"Color is a brown with a maroon tint and pours out a medium foam head thats biege in color. Nice roasty aroma with caramel tones in the back of my nose, very nice. Taste of caramel balanced well with roasted barley and gives a sweet malty flavor. Finish is a fresh hop note and kind of earthy with a dark nut sense. Reminded me of a nut brown just a hint darker. Good feel of tangy bite and medium body, not heavy. Drinking it warm apposed to cold favors this Best Brown. This brown would make for for a good chilly evening capper."
"Again, an expertly brew from the wizards at Kzoo. Highly recommended."
"Pours a rusty dark brown color with a substantial cake of light beige foam that clings mightily to the glass. Sweet caramely aroma is quite pleasant and rather strong even when the beer is well chilled. The bitter, dry finish is the most striking component of the taste. Starts somewhat sweet and milk chocolatey. Combination of creamy texture and lingering crispness makes for an appealing mouthfeel and another Bell's success."
"Bellâ€™s Best Brown Ale: Twelve-ounce bottle. Pours a very hazy brown, underneath a huge tannish head, that lasts. Nice Belgian lacing as well. The aroma is very strong, of roasted malts and weak coffee and cream. Wow, this is the best tasting brown ale Iâ€™ve ever had. Very smooth and pleasant, with roasted malts that add a nice rich flavor. Very easy to drink. A slight kick of hops bitterness at the end. I believe that this was well aged, and the tastes have smoothed out, and my somewhat old beer has become very well balanced. Really nice."
"I thoroughly enjoyed drinking this beer, but IÂ’m wondering if the sourness so frequently discussed on the forum has crept into the Brown at my house. If so, itÂ’s very slight. Still, it is evident and the resulting tiny hint of twangy green apple is enough to knock a half point or so off a couple of categories. Still, overall this is a great beer and one I'm really looking forward to drinking again."
"Ruddy brown in hue, with a light haze. Thick, bumpy, stiff light tan head leaves fluffy lace. Earthy and citric hop nose coupled with the yeast strain's signature slightly unripe pearish fruity esters dominate the aroma. Mild biscuit malt and medium caramel are secondary, but biscuit becomes more pronounced and almost savory in nature as the beer warms. Tart fruit and toasty grain initially are followed by a leafy, woody, tobacco like hop flavor, which then oddly morphs, becoming more citrusy in nature. Faint notes of chocolate malt. Non descript caramel malt provides the bulk of malt sweetness, since the high attenuation lends a dry finish low in residual sugars. Mild hop bitterness leaves the caramel malt profile unhindered. Medium bodied for style, with a relatively dextrinous mouthfeel. Finishes dry w/ notes of biscuit and salt. Certainly a flavorful brown ale. Slightly lacking in overall balance, but tasty and unique nevertheless. Perhaps the most tame Bells beer."
"This hazy brwon beer with red highlights pours with a thick tan head that slowly fades. A nice lacing is left on the glass as you drink. The aroma is of caramel, molasses, and malt and is very inviting and smooth. The first taste is heavy on the dark molasses and a husky malt flavor. Smoky brown sugar notes and a nice bitterness follow. Not as much sweetness as the aroma would suggest, this is more of a dry brown ale. The mouthfeel is a bit harsh from carbonation, and the beer has a moderate body. It improves a bit as the beer warms. The drinkability is good, as this would be a good session beer. Another nice beer from Kalamazoo."
"Deep, dark brown to near violet with a fine, simmering tan head. Aroma is unique and slightly unfathomable! I'm getting dates, plums, roasted nuts, caramel, sweetness, but on the dark side. Chewy mouthfeel, medium body, great texture. A very substantial brown ale that stands on the opposite end of the ubiquitous Newcastle. Sits proudly on the palate, and lingers on the tastebuds. Low carbonation. Altogether excellent! Bell's does their brewing business with a certain je ne sais quoi, y'knowwhatImean? There's a lift, a beautiful bouyancy that I often associate with the best products of Belgium in almost everything they do at Kalamazoo."
"A rough pour brings up a full creamy light tan head but rouses the yeast sediment leaving it fairly hazy. The head then holds exceptionally well and leaves some nice lace. The body is an appropriate russett brown. A rich but soft aroma welcomes you with softly sweet cocoa. The medium body is accentuated by a very fine and moderate carbonation from bottle conditioning. At first it caresses the tongue, but soon becomes more creamy as it warms. The flavor starts softly chocolatey with an underlying fruitiness from the yeast and a lightly spicy and grassy hoppiness. It's sweetish, but well balanced by a firm bitterness that becomes quite apparent in the lingering dry finish (it is, after all, a Bell's beer)! The residual chocolatey malt combines with the bitterness and takes on a coffee-like character. Very nice! It's quite charming, well brewed, balanced and enjoyable. Well worth trying."
"Pours a deep cloudy brown with some floaties. Decent caramel colored head that stood up well and left a nice lace. Roasted malts & nuts come to the forefront on the aroma. First sip is slightly spicey and nutty. Not much hoppiness but still balances well. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with a medium/heavy body. Overall very drinkable."
"thanks to BA kennywoodbrew for providing me with this sample as part of his BIF venture!"
"Murky brown color, has a small off-white head, nice fruity malty aroma. Mild nutty and malty flavor, has a nice hop bite in the finish. A bit of a watery mouthfeel, not bad for the style, a little on the hoppy side."
"The finish is long with a minerally component which keeps the malty palate from becoming too much, and really helps this beer have a very good drinkability. A very nice example of a style that is simply not one of my favorites. This bottle was purchased at the Brewery on the day of review."
"All in all, a very solid brown ale. One that bucks tradition a bit and gives a bit more to the drinker's tastebuds. A good beer from one of my favorite brewerys."
"Looks good. There is a wild, sour gaminess on the nose that reminds me of some lambics. Nutshell, used coffee grounds, fur and metal weave together there as well. The flavor is frankly sweet with a heavy dose of roasted grain flavor to balance the sugar. More stale coffee emerges on the finish. Overall a thoroughly rustic experience. One to drink while on a hunting trip, decked out in flannel, sitting at a campfire, gnawing on a turkey bone."
"Mostly opaque brown color, slightly garnet with the trademark yeasties floating around.  Good head of almost a 1/2 inch, holds some shapes well.  Nutty aroma.  This is seriously one of the best Browns I've ever had, bolder caramel and maple flavors and a nice, if not huge, amount of hop bitterness at the end and in the swallow.  In some ways, it starts a little slick and ends dry -- an impressive feat for a brew."
"Pours a brown color, with a tint of orange. The head is a beige color, rocky, creamy, and long lasting. On the nose there is aromas of roasted malts and hints of caramel. On the palate there is a nutty flavor, slightly grainy, dark toasted bread, and just a hint of molasses. Not as good as the brown ale I had from smuttynose a couple of days ago, but still very enjoyable."
"This beer poured a cloudy, reddish brown color and formed a huge nice light tan bubbly head that left some nice latticed lace. A heavy amount of carbonation is present. A slight aroma of malt, hops and caramel. A flavor of hops and caramel. A farily light finish but dry finish with a touch of caramel sweetness. Another good beer from Bell's."
"This beer's a ruby color with a nice rocky head that has great retention.  Very nice nutty/caramel tones on the nose with sticky molasses making its presence known also.  A bready yeastiness is present on the palate.  Some of that trademark lactic sourness as well.  Seems to fit alright however.  Some slight chocolate tones also.  Very subdued roasted nut taste is also making an appearance.  Pretty unique tasting Brown."
