"Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a clear glass tumbler. Purchased at Million Dollar Cowboy Bar (Jackson Hole, WY)."

"Will not seek out and purchase again."

"Overall – A nice and quite enjoyable ESB with a good blend of dank earthy hop, sweet, and toasted tastes.  A nice drinker overall."

"Hmm, I am not sure I like the fact that ESB is on the label. To me this is a well-made American Brown Ale with hefty malts and a good deal of hops working off of those grains. A good beer but the label threw me off initially."
""
""
""
""

"Dark brown color and yet still somewhat penetrable to light. A quarter inch of tightly knit beige head sits on top. Brussels lacing. I smell dark malt and just a faint whiff of caramel. The flavor is dark malt, toffee,and caramel. The mouth is slightly creamy and smooth."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - good example of the style. It's at least as good as Honker's Ale."
""
""
"The body is a solid medium with the balance of crisp and smooth that works for this brown ale, right in the median between sweet and dry."

"Oh Yes...I like hoppy alternative beers such as black IPAs or India Browns....this is in that category or ""nice""! The beer pours a hazy brown with thin off-white head that is leaving a lace. The scent has fresh hops that lean towards pine with hints of bitter citrus. The taste is even through the entire drink....there is presence of sweet malt with bitter hops with touches of pine. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall I would try this again and it would be a great fall session beer."

""
""
""
""
"O- Overall a good beer, not really a brown, but I imagine they were aiming for their own style. I buy it from time to time and will drink it again."
"Dammit, a lot of potential wasted for love of a dank green bud. There are worse faults I guess...Save it for the pale ale boys!"

"Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, tea, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a slightly better citrus hop presence in the aroma."

"Enjoyed the beer and the company. Staff was knowledgable and helpful, look forward to another visit. I loved the dark rich flavor, the apperance was beautiful, felt great on the mouth, the smell made me want more. Wish I could get to the point of brewing a beer like this."
""
""
"Some people are comparing this to a good homebrew, and I would agree. It's a well-balanced, interesting beer that could be sessioned or enjoyed alongside dinner."
""
""
"Body is good. It's the only thing about this beer that I would consider above average. Sorry, Bitch Creek, I didn't really enjoy you. I didn't dislike you either, but damn if you weren't boring."

"Overall:This one drinks like an imperial red. Not a bad brew, especially if you like burnt caramel, but I have had better from the brewery."

"Overall- Well, this beer's just a hot mess- reminds me of bad generic hoppy American amber homebrew. Sharp, poor balance, and well... gross. Bottle conditioning gone wrong, I hope. The amount of sediment in the beer is actually pretty shocking, and it's definitely trub and hop particulate. Very bad- I feel no regrets about pouring this out other than the $1.75 I spent on the bottle. All that and it wasn't even the dark English-style ESB it was advertised as- two shades more caramel and this would definitely be classified as an American IPA. Off for the style and completely undrinkable."
""
""
""
""
"I rate it 4.25..."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a damn fine beer. It's very delicately balanced, while maintaining a very full and forthright flavour profile. What's more, it's remarkably easy to drink, and oddly moreish. I'm a big fan."
""
""
""
"Bitch Creek pours a dark reddish color, with a nice long lasting head. Their is a malty aroma, with hints of a harsh sweetness. The taste has a malty flavor, and a bit harsh, with a slightly hoppiness that comes through at the end. Full flavor, but a strange harsh sweetness to it. Overall not a bad beer, worth another go."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Interesting take on an ESB with a nod to a brown"
"O - Good beer, interesting take on the style. I'll have no problem finishing the 6-pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O-This was a drinkable and slightly different take on the brown style with decent flavor and a concentrated smell. I would have preferred more malt in the flavor profile, but nothing here was completely out of place. It paired nicely with the chili I was eating."
"Overall - A good, fairly interesting brew. A lot more hop character than I expected. Definitely a beer I'd consider trying again, though it's not high on my priority list."
"O – This is a decent beer. I think it may fit better in the brown ale category, albeit with a few more hops than the usual example (picture a brown IPA). Because of this, its characteristics are kind of out of the ranges of good ESB characteristics. I’d like to see more sweet caramel and less toasted and nutty malts. This would also lighten the color into a more ESB-appropriate range. I’d also like to see more earthy and floral hops rather than citrus and pine. Some earthiness was definitely present in the taste but not so much in the aroma. Regardless of all of this, it’s not a bad tasting beer and it’s certainly drinkable. I just think that this beer would be better suited in a different category. I think Grand Teton could make a better beer that would be much better suited for the ESB style."

"I like it. It's a nice mix of an ESB and a brown ale."

"i liked this one a lot, unconventional hoppy brown ale. the pour is a decadent looking hazy reddish brown color with a lively off white head as tall as you want it to be. aroma is hop heavy on top of well roasted chocolate malt and an ale yeast that lends some seasonal vibe to it. flavor is great i think, the heavy hops on top of a sturdy brown ale is just what the early fall is calling for, its perfect really. i love the sweetness of the malts grappling with the bitterness of the hops. its got a great bite in the finish as well. feel is fuller bodied for sure, but the carbonation is rather bright, and the combination is great. its a little filling, but its perfect for this time of year. get some."
"Medium brown color and is somewhat hazy. Pours with an enormous head. Smell is different than a typical brown ale - chocolate malts present but a hint of sour. Taste incorporates the chocolate malt and the sour smell may be derived from a citrus hop. Mouthfeel is great with fine bubbles that probably contribute to the large head."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours kind of cloudy. Well, not kind of cloudy. I'd say a bit too much so, really. This one is pretty earthy with bark tones to it when you let it warm up. Much more pleasant than I was anticipating. Only draw back is a mild bitter and citric thing that strikes me as slightly not right. But not really so much that it even matters. This is a nice beer."

"Pours a very dark brown with a tan head and excellent, beautiful lacing. Smells is excellent - malty, caramel, cinnamon, and butter. Taste is quite bitter up front. Loaded with both malts and hops imparting powerful flavors. The sweet caramel smell doesn't come through in the flavor, it is much more bitter, toasted, earthy, grassy. A very interesting beer, haven't had many like it."
"Overall this one is good. It's not my favorite style, but I found it to be very drinkable."
""
""
"Overall a really nice ESB, not quite as blown away as I thought I might've been (could be the bottle age) but really enjoyed the beer"

"This is a great beer that is extremely drinkable with it's 6.0% ABV and 54 IBU. A great place for someone looking to start with craft beer, or a very pleasant American Brown."
""
"Served from tap into a sampler shaker. Poured ruby red with a minimal brownish off-white head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, sweet malt, and nutty. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, nutty, dark chocolate, subtle coffee, and citrus. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I was really quite surprised by this one based on the flavor. There was really a lot going on in this one that I usually don’t find in this style that was a very welcomed change. The aroma on the other hand could have used a little work as it was quite simple. Nicely done brew that I wouldn’t mind having again in the future."
"Got a bottle of this from a friend. Cloudier dark amber color, a slightly hoppy/metallic aroma. Initial wet mouthfeel with a nutty/malty profile that then moves into a dry hoppier finish. The 6% alcohol is present but not overpowering, overall a nice beer."

"Overall, this brown ale is just a bit too heavy for me. I definitely don't regret trying it, but one is enough."
""
"A very drinkable and enjoyable brown ale. The finish is better than the mid, but it's not as good as the immediate attack. Well balanced with a good malty and savory quality as well"
""
""
""
""
"Final thoughts - nice 6% abv, low price of a little over a dollar a bottle. Well done beer for sure!"
""
""
"Wife picked this up for me...mentioned it was especially from her. Uh-oh. Pours a dirty cola/brown color with a nice fluffy beige head. Good lacing. The smell has some nice brown sugar, apple, light citrus and malt. A very big malt presence on the taste with some splashes of citrus. A light dose of leather in the aftertaste. Nice hop presence in this one. Pretty full mouthfeel. Overall I liked this. I am not a huge brown fan but this one has enough to keep my interest and consume multiples. I can definitely see why the awards keep coming to this ale. Definitely worth a shot."
"Nice offering but nothing special. Seems to be more of a brown ale than an ESB as stated on the label."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very good in a classic way. Not overly impressive in the sense that it wows me but definitely a solid output. I don't see myself buying this too often, however if it was offered to me I would very gladly take it."
"Serving type: bottle"
""
""
""
""
"O - Great taste to it, nothing really jumps out at you but its a real nice blended taste, different than other brown ales I've had, but still a good choice, especially since it was on sale when I got it"
""
""
""
"The taste was very good. Hoppy for a brown ale. Taste was like smell. Low carbonation, and medium mouth-feel."
"D: Nice little brown ale with a good hop profile. Goes down pretty smoothly with a nice transition from slightly sweet and nutty to hoppy and slightly bitter. Overall, not bad. "
"O – A good beer with nice balance, one on which I enjoyed the smell more than the taste, good drinkability 4"
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied and on the low side of carbonation."
"overall: perfect dark nutty beer for a wintery day, such as today is."
"Interesting beer, but not for me. Seems, like a black ipa to me, rather then a brown ale."

"Overall a good beer. Not a typical brown, but enjoyable."

"Overall - This is a beer with some very rich flavors that don't come off as bitter or artificial, which alone makes this an excellent Brown Ale. If you're into brown ales and are looking for some flavor to your beer, this is the beer for you!"
"Loved the XX version of this, high hopes for the everyday version. It pours a deep russet-brown topped by a finger of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises toffee, light maple syrup, very light toasted bread, pine, greens, and plenty of cilantro. The taste brings in more of the same, but then finishes with a strong bitter/charry/leather character that malingers for a while and ruins any good that precedes it. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta-kinda dry finish. Overall, a decent brew that turns all Hyde on ya. Shame, really."
"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Cloudy brown/mahogony pour with a nice 2 finger tan head. Adequate lacing that remains throughout, very good looking brown. Not an overpowering smell, but notes of carmel, citrus and a mix of malts and hops. Taste is similar to the nose, but a strong fruity initial surge followed off by subtle hops. A good combination of malts and hops with a full body taste. Maybe a bit too strong on the fruity/citrus end. Feels great on the tongue with a decent amount of carbonation. Silky and smooth with a little bite. Overall- A solid ABA with an interesting taste. Good mix of carmel/fruit malts and a little hop bite at the end. Would not turn one down, tasty-"
"Poured this American Brown Ale from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The Brown ale poured a dark reddish brown color. It produced a nice tan head, below average retention. It does leave some rings of lacing behind on the glass. The aroma of the ale features caramel, fresh baked bread, orange peel and spicy hoppy goodness. Medium body, grainy, chocolate, caramel, toasted malt flavor. Sweet, semi dry finish.Awesome session beer....nice way to get away from the run of the mill brown ales that are out there."
"O- A tasty beer but it needs more on the nose, and I might change the hops up a bit to add more flavor and less just general bitterness."
"The beer pours out mahogany in color with a light brown head on top. The aroma of this beer is largely hoppy (54 IBUs of Pacific Northwestern hops), but it has some underlying sweet malty tones. The taste of the beer is of roasty biscuity malts, with a splash of hop bitterness towards the end of the drink. Bitch Creek finishes surprisingly dry, but has a lingering amount of hop oil left on the tongue. Overall, this is a sturdy American brown ale."
"O - Definitely an above average brown, which are hard to find these days. Stressing the serving temperature, as it makes a big difference."
"Overall, I'm glad I got to try a bee I really otherwise wouldn't have had but I have no intention of drinking the other two out of my sampler. Bitch Creek definitely will bitch slap the taste out of your mouth with the herbal bitterness. They could definitely tone that down and this would be a great beer."
"Medium to light consistency in the mouthfeel that works well. Just a rock solid brew overall and I'll be looking for more beers from this brewery."
"I have a hard time liking some browns, but this is a good example of an American Brown Ale. I go for the nutty English browns usually, because the hops that brewers choose for American browns just don't go together; but Grand Teton Brewing pulled it off. For some reason this reminds me of a DFH ale. Very hoppy and experimental without being an IPA. I'm going to have to remember to get a sixer of this when I want to mix it up in the winter when the malts are king."
"Wow, good beer here, I like it and I got a ballcap from the rep to boot."
"O- Quite surprised by this one. I really enjoyed this one."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this one so I made it a point to grab a pack at the store when I got the chance. It's definitely better on tap, but I am enjoying the pack at a leisurely pace, especially since it came off the rotating tap at Gastropub."
"I promised myself I wouldn't write this when I bought the bottle, but I'm so impressed by it that I just can't help myself - Bitch Creek is one bitchin' ale! Now that I've gotten that out of my system, a more serious note: there aren't many American brewers anymore who can grasp the English pub-style ale (and most who do can't often pull it off). But this is exactly the kind of offering that tempts men to sneak out of the house for cheeky pint."
"Overall Impression- great brown like always. Wish it wasn't called an Esb... But for those who drink this know what it really is."
"The finish is where you get just a hint of the hops for me. There is just a touch of citrus on the finish that really completes this one. I keep licking my lips afterwards like I just took a bit of sundae. It may sound like the sweetness is over the top but it is not. This nails the line between bittersweet and over the top. Very drinkable, wish I could get it here in Texas."
"O-Enjoyable beer, good taste. would recommend not taking to small of sips to get the most complex flavors."
"O - I'm glad I tried it and the nose was impressive, but I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"I wish we could get Bitch Creek ESB without first taking a trip of several hundred miles."
"Overall this a Great beer. Very easy to drink. I could crush a six pack easy. This is an everyday beer that should be at every bar."
"Overall, a very nice glass of beer though maybe a bit out of place in the heat of NC right now."
"O - Very impressed by this beer. Would definitely buy again."
"Bottle: Poured a cloudy brown color ale with a medium foamy head with good retention and limited lacing. Aroma consists of dry caramelized sugar with nice notes of biscuit. Taste is dominated by a solid malt backbone of dry caramelized sugar with a nice biscuit finish. Body is full with limited filtration and good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Well brewed though it doesn’t really fall close to a particular style."
"D/O: This is an interesting brown ale that serves as Grand Teton's work-horse dark beer. Its combination of qualities give the impression of a blend between an English-style pale ale and a really good American porter. It is full-flavored and obviously well-crafted, but it may struggle to stand out amongst their strong series of seasonal offerings and one-off bottlings."
" Biggest flavor right off the bat was a caramel that you caught right up front along with a burnt or roasted wood flavor. Almost had a touch of oaked flavor in it. Some hoppiness in the finish, but nothing distracting from the primary notes. A good solid brown ale flavor as best as I can describe it. Finish was a little nutty and dry."
"The mouthfeel brings down what started very well. Still worth trying, but I would rather see something this light more towards 5 percent."
"Definitely worth a try but more for curiosity than to fulfill your brown ale fix. Low score mainly because this isn't even close to what a brown is. It tastes decent, but it's just an odd combination in my book."
"I really enjoyed this beer and would happily drink it again."
"O: I expected a blend between ESB and brown ale and ended up with a hoppy brown ale - think a slightly sub-par DFH Indian Brown Ale."
"O - I was kinda dissapointed with this one. The whole ""Extra Special"" name kinda got my hopes up, but really, it's just a pretty descent brown ale. I do like how the hop tastecreeps up in the aftertaste. That was kinda special."
"Drinkability is OK. Not outstanding though, just OK."
"On the take home scale a six paxk on hand for all occasions."
"o - decent beer, pretty attractive, aroma a bit lacking, but an easy drinking beer"
"Interesting for this style but not for me. It's certainly a drinkable beer but not one I would crave or desire to have again."
"D - This is my third time buying Bitch Creek. I am impressed with the simplicity and taste of this beer. I find this a staple in my fridge. Good work Grand Teton."
"High quality brown but not as outstanding as other browns I've had in the past."
"paired well with a rich lamb burger"
"D: Definitely an unusual take on a brown ale that won't always appeal to fans of the style. I, for one, thought it was very drinkable."
"Hazy, dark and brown pour. Solid tan head that builds strong then sticks around. Aroma is thick and hoppy, like an IPA or APA. Lots of citrus, pine and cocoa in the nose. Taste is smooth and malty like an English brown ale, but the hops and bitterness come on strong and fast. Definitely a hophead's brown ale. It gives Dogfish Head;s Indian Brown a run for its money as hoppiest American brown ale. A great and tasty brew."
"D: This one is heavy. A meal in a glass for me. I couldn't drink more than one of these. Even though it is only 6% ABV, it wears it on its sleeve. You know you're drinking alcohol."
"D - Usually hoppy browns are not my style but this is going down pretty easy."
"Overall, a great surprise from a beer I was not expecting much from. Definitely plan on buying more of this from time to time. Worth a shot if available at your local store, but I wouldn't go too far out of my way to find this one."
"Aromas of roasted malt, caramel and citrus hops. Rich toasted caramel malt flavors predominate. Moderate hop bitterness. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Traces of semi-sweet chocolate and cocoa on the finish. Artfully balanced between roasted malts and bitter hops. Full flavored and complex, Bitch Creek is one bitchingly sessionable ESB."
"Just a tad of richness and a slight sharpness to the hops decrease the final category, but having another is not a problem."
"It is decent."
"OVERALL: Good stuff for a brown ale.  I would drink this again in a heartbeat even though it isn't normally my style. I'm looking forward to the Pursuit of Hoppiness. "
"A gift from joshman for Xmas 2010. Poured into stemmed glasses from the bottle. The color was dark brown with a medium sized head. Smell had a nice aroma of dark biscuits. Taste had some nice flavors of fig, coffee, chocolate, and dark malt. The problem was that all of the flavors were so subtle. I was expecting a much more hearty presentation of flavor from this bottled format. Was there a bit of oak aging here? I got just a slight taste of it. Mouthfeel was smooth and drinkability was just fine for a brown ale. A nice take on the style, but nothing earth shattering to report here."
"Taste starts sweet, strong citrus in the middle, and closes with grain husk malt and a light lemony bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, although the lemon does get a bit dominant, and drinkability is pretty good. Interesting brew that has me enjoying at one sip, cursing the lemon at the next, and back again."
"M- A very full brown ale. A great drinkability that makes this ale one of my favorite brown ales."
"Fairly harsh, the mineralness was quite strong, i'm assuming its from the amount of hops in this beer. Not a fan, needs to be simpler."
"The body is medium to light with a lightly carbonated chalky feel. It's smooth as smooth gets, the light hearted body makes for carefree drinking. Awesome effort here."
"Serving type: bottle"
"The hops caught me a little off-guard, as this was my first American Brown. It grew on me. Not too shabby."
"Overall- Maybe this was towards the bottom of the barrel, but it was a rather underwhelming brown ale, I have been pretty impressed by Grand Teton, but this did not do much for me. There are much better browns out there."
"Overall: This was my first time trying this beer. It was a step above what I expected. It wouldn't be my first choice, but definitely an option worth consideration."
"D - Not incredibly complex, but taste was good and I can definitely drink lots of it."
"D: I find this a decent beer now, and plan to review again in the future. I know have enjoyed on subsequent occassions since this review, and feel as thought an update may be in order."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin for my liking by it stands up well in its own category of brew for sure."
"Overall/notes - So, I must plead ignorance here: I did some quick shopping and bought this thinking it was an extra special bitter. Needless to say, I was caught completely off-guard when I drank it. It isn't a bad brew at all, but I don't think it's quite up my alley."
"d-Not the most drinkable brown but I didn't have any problems with the bottle"
"Serving type: bottle"
"Not too much to say about this one. Enjoyable and drinkable enough, very light for a brown, but nothing especially noteworthy for me. Good but not too memorable."
"Pours a hazy deep amber to a copper color with a light tan head. In the aroma, grapefruity hops, almost IPA like. In the taste, a nice citrus to pine hop and a nice dry malt all the way through. A bitter to smooth and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi drysmall citrus hop in the aftertaste. Almost an IPA, but I can dig it."
"For a brown ale this was too bitter, while the malt profile was good, the dryness/bitterness took over as the main flavor. It poured nice at first, extremely heady and looked great. Its smell was weak and did not match the first tastes. For an ESB this was not soothing although if your a fan of extra hoppy browns this may be for you."
"Served with a nice, large, foamy, frothy, light tan head that lasts a while and lots of lace. Color is a clear amber brown. Aroma is malt n hops. Flavor is like american brown pushing the limits - in fact, maybe too far. Too me the hop is at least equal to the malt and dominates it in some ways. That crosses it over into some other beer style. Body is good and good carbonation, but the jacked up bitterness is more astringent and pucker in the mouth. Finish is a little on the sharp side, but still overall a great drinking beer. Just a little outside aba. Oh, and the ESB moniker needs to go, not witty or clever at all. Seems to me a cheesy attempt at humor or marketing guy's got to get canned."
"Conclusion: I feel that this take on the style missed the mark. I don't have any problem with hopping up a style that usually doesn't display major hops, but doing so at the expense of the original heart and soul of the beer ends up being a trade off without benefits. If the hops balanced a more with the malts this could be beneficial."
"Pours a nice moderate brown color with some copper streaks. White head with a bit of lacing. The nose is quite strong and nice. Good notes of pine, grapefruit, and some other citrus hops. Light caramel and toffee in the nose. The flavor has a nice hop bouquet along with a bit of light caramel and bread. Pretty good body with a nice level of bitterness and a good finish. Drinks quite well and was a solid nice first beer from Idaho."
"The scent is punctuated by grapefruit and pine hops backed up and balanced by caramel malts. That balance is lost somewhat in the taste with the hops bitterness taking over, but that's what an ESB is all about. It's supposed to be overbalanced in favor of the bitterness, hence the name. I'd pan any other style for that excess, but this seems just about right for the style and will satisfy just about any hophead or bitter bitch."
"Highly drinkable beer, but a little heavy for a session beer. A little over the edge for what I would consider sessionable."
"Bought a single in Missouri and it was on the bottom rack with all the other lone single, that they didn't have multiples of. It has a section for when it was bottled on, but no information there, suspecting that it is a bit old."
"Overall, this is a very good beer, one I'd love to always have around. They came close to hitting a home run; by bringing out some of the brown ale characteristics a little more, they would've done it. As it is, I would classify it as a delicious, extremely unorthodox IPA."
"D An excellent beer which I'll be having more of. 4"
"Note: 6.0% and 54 IBU's per bottle..."
"Drinks: appropriately. The odd title ""extra special brown"" is fitting here -- it's a bit odd, but nicely complex, for a brown."
"Overall- I liked the beer but not as much as I figured I would. The bittering hops seems a little over the top for the style. A little less bittering hops for me would make this beer taste better in my opinion. It is a unique beer and I'm glad I bought it but I probably will not buy another six pack of it."
"Drinkability - a little too bitter for my taste, but decently complex and good-tasting."
"Bitch Creek ends up being a quite tasty, old-school microbrew style, which we really dig. If you are looking for a full-flavored, bigger-bodied session beer, here it is."
"Got on tap in a sampler at the Burger Bar in Vegas, and was impressed enough to come back for a pint. Advertised as a brown ale, but definitely has the feel of a bitter in several respects. Beautiful garnet brown color, surprisingly thick head sticks well to the glass. Maybe not the best pairing with their complex burgers (maybe an IPA?) but a strong showing"
"Could use a little more roast but this is still a decent session-able brown ale. Faintly bland for the style, but still worth a try."
"Mouthfeel is pleasant and I definitely would have had another if I had one."
"It's reasonably good, but not great by any means and certainly not my kind of beer."
"This is a more bitter style of brown ale, perhaps it could be described as a brown IPA. A great combination for a superior beer."
"D: Not my favorite style of beer, but I think they did a worthy job. I would try again."
"Love the balance, the pleasant bitterness, and the finish of this beer. One of my go-to B+ six packs."
"This beer is easily drinkable, it's affordable and comes in six packs, which is nice. I always thought it only came in bombers until I saw this single at my not-so-local liquor store. I paid $1.60 for the beer so that's not that bad at all."
"It finishes with a little spicy hop flavor, some more earthy and herbal hops but they get a little spicy here and are somewhat bitter but not heavy bitterness. It dries a bit, quite a bit, but leaves a slight sticky sweetness feel. Some lingering malts, and even a touch of minerality. It has a slight creamy feel to it at this point as well. Drinks well, tasty, I could drink a lot of this."
"I came in with no expectations & no history with Grant Teton, and I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. I will drink Bitch Creek again, without a doubt."
"Overall, I thought this was going to be a bitter, but it was a brown. So I rated it as a brown and it still wasn't that good. I just wasn't very happy with this offering. Not to drinkable."
"D - Awesome with some good ABV and great flavors."
"Final Notes: Now I know why they call it an ""Extra Special Brown"" - think of this as a cross between an actual ESB and a Brown Ale. Rather interesting flavor to say the least. Very sessionable and easy drinking."
"drinks pretty good, i might be done after 4 or so of these. a decent session beer, but it might lay a little heavy in the stomach after awhile. a great tasteing beer non the less and if it wasnt so hard to get a hold of for me, i might drink it more. not really distributed in my region(well not that i know of)."
"But seriously, this is what an ideal ESB made in the traditional English style should taste like."
"My one qualm about this review is that its miscategorized. This beer is not at all a brown ale, but an ESB. That is what I'm basing my review upon."
"Had enough hops to be interesting, but not as sharp as an IPA, a warmth to the flavor. For some reason the carbonation fascinated me - large bubbles settled into a soft smooth head with interesting topographic features. I would have thought this beer might have a little more heft, but it was an interesting try."
"D) A decent brew. A cross between an ESB (with some extra hop bite) and an English Brown ale."
"Dark brown colored body, very big khaki colored head leaves some stickiness on the glass. Dark malt scent. Almost seems more like a brown than a esb. Dark malt front, some bittering hops balancing it out. Lighter side of medium bodied, very wet drink. Its not really a bad beer, but like i said, it reminds me a lot of a brown ale, which is probably my least favorite style out of the commonly found styles of beer."
"Drinkability is quite average, especially for the price. Not that impressed with this one."
"Drinkability: Not a true ESB as it is called an Extra Special Brown. It really is a cross between an English Brown Ale and some kind of bitter American beer - I would call it an American Brown Ale. Quite good, but the mixture is just slightly off-putting."
"Medium bodied, resinous, and properly carbonated. Another nice beer from Grand Teton Brewing"
"One very dark ESB. Dark chestnut color that I cannot see through. Two fingers of head that quickly settles to a thin cap. Not much for lacing. The aroma consists of a lot caramel malt. Slight citrus and floral notes. The flavor is on the sweeter side. A lot of caramel and some citrus. The body is also fuller than others in the style. Well carbonated. Quite filling. A bigger ESB that drinks nicely. But the bigger body and higher ABV lowers drinkability."
"Drinkability is pretty decent. Tasty beer, albeit a little too sticky, and very easy to drink."
"It's not clear despite the careful pour, and relatively strong and quite sticky. anyway, it's tasty, but a little rough around the edges. The bitterness doesn't fit that well with my perception of ESB, the flavor doesn't fit that well with brown ale. Finally, it is too highly carbonated. These add up to a beer that isn't particularly drinkable, though I'd be happy to sip one again as it definitely deserves further contemplation. My current preference would be for less caramel malt flavor, little lower gravity, less stickiness, lower carb, and if any was used, perhaps less sulfate or whatever is accentuating the hop bitterness - perhaps it is just the hop variety. the current version reminds me of a homebrew we made called ""WTF"" where we combined many many different things and made a unique, flavorful, but not particularly drinkable, beer."
"Overall not a bad little beer. I enjoyed the heavy maltiness more than I would have predicted, maybe because it was paired with such a big hop hit."
"The flavours hung around for a pleasant aftertaste. My taste buds liked it, but I couldn't have another, my mission was only just starting!"
"I rather enjoyed this beer's limited bigger brother, the XX Bitch Creek, and this beer is similar enjoyable. This beer pours a cloudy mahogany, a nice deep color, full of promise, with a good ecru head. The aroma is bright and hoppy, a bit more floral than most ESBs but lots of mineral hoppiness, too. There's a big caramel and biscuit malt backbone. The flavor is rather bitter and a bit surprising. It could use some more malty sweetness to bring out more depth, but it's a mild complaint. If I recall correctly, the XX version had that depth and it was quite successful. The beer has a fairly creamy feel, probably better on tap. Easy to drink, if you like the style and don't mind a bit of American innovation."
"D- Moderate. Interesting and enjoyable. I'd revisit it, would prob. pair well with food, lots of interesting flavors going on."
"Mouthfeel, I liked the beer more as I got used to it, settled down, picked up more bitter feel, but still a little heavier than I like my esb. Decent price, just kind of one of those middle of the road beers."
"pours a brown slightly hazy color with a tan head..i smell fruit toffee caramel some biscuit notes some brown sugar..the taste is hops and malt a little bitter with some toffee and malt some fig and brown sugar..the mouth feel is robust like a brown ale maybe.its ok drinkable its just not my style or one that ill buy..i will say try it if you like browns esb or wee heavys you might like this one ..worth a try"
"Overall - A solid effort from Idaho!!"
"The 6.5% may make it hard to session, but I'm willing to try."
"D - Not to drinkable in my opinion, maybe 1-2 pints with an appetizer, not too much balance for me, I would of liked more malts in both aroma & flavor. There was this sharp citrus that sorta cut through anything in it's path. Gets a little better when warmed but still not great in my opinion. I would recommend looking for something, I know I wouldn't buy this one again."
"Mouthfeel was medium in body. Adequate carbonation."
"A good beer with the perfect taste in my opinion for its style."
"D: Bitch Creek ESB is a good beer, but there were certain things about it I just couldn't get past. It's worth trying, though."
"It may look scary with all that sediment, but after that you get yourself into a good ESB. Well done."
"Drinkability - I'd have this one again for sure - just be careful as its 6.5% ABV will not make it a session beer. But if you've had a hard day at the office, this one will feel real nice going down. - 4.5/5.0"
"Alesmith ESB is a much better ESB. Just saying."
"Not a bad beer at all. At 6.5%, it's a little too strong to be a session beer. I'm not a huge fan of the style, and I think it's a little too hoppy for an ESB, but it's tasty enough that I would drink this again."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Hazy dark amber color with a creamy beige head. Aroma is big, I mean like barleywine big. ESB my ass. Smells like caramel and toffee and citrus hops and earth and fruitcake. Flavor is equally robust. Earthy and sweet malts blend with candied orange and grapefruit hops dusted with cocoa powder and lead into a bready, bitter finish. 54 IBUs seems too low for what I'm tasting. Mouthfeel joins every other aspect of this beer in being 'not-to-style,' as the heaviness on the palate detracts from the expected drinkability of an ESB. So does a dose of astringency. I'm pretty perplexed by this beer. On BA it's a Brown Ale (and has won several awards in GABF under that category), and on RB and the label it's an ESB. But it doesn't taste like either. India Brown Ale? Unimperial Barleywine? Whatever. It's pretty good."
"Pours deep mahogany with a white head - darker than most ESB's I've had. The head dissipates quickly, and leaves a faint white lacing. The aroma is of earthy, english hops and a bit of roasted caramel. The taste is nicely balanced - rich maltiness up front and then a bitterness kick at the end. The yeast seems to be American and not English - it imparts a more fruity taste than bready. The carbonation is a bit low, which I prefer with this style. Overall, pretty drinkable and nice American interpretation of the ESB."
"Bold and full-bodied on the palate, opening with flavors of coffee, herbal hops, toffee, pine and orange peel. Well-hopped but balanced by a substantial malt backbone. Nutty, biscuit-like finish with herbal hop bitterness. Drinks easy despite the full body and rich flavor, very good stuff."
"Pours a cloudy, dark brown color. There is a lighter red along the edges and bottom of the glass. Also, there is suspended sediment evident. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of floral hops, sweet malt, and slight caramel. Fits the style of an ESB (not quite sure why it is called a Brown on this site?). Mouth feel is smooth and slight creamy with an average carbonation level. It is also fairly bitter. Tastes of pale hops, strong hops, slight roasted malt, slight citrus, and some sweet malt. Overall, one of the better ESB's I've had in quite some time. There's a great balance of ingredients, good body, good aroma, and easy drinkability."
"Surprisingly robust flavor profile and mouthfeel on this one. I can say it's definitely not what I was expecting (style?). A nice beer, but not one that I would look to for sessioning."
"Notes: Despite what this beer is rated if you're a fan of big, bold beers don't pass this one up. This is brown ale is fantastic!"
" D- This beer has a great rich malt flavor with a nice fizzy and hop finish that cleans up the beer. There is good depth and I would love to have this on cask."
"This is a beer to be reckoned with. It's all over the board with hop and malt flavors. The aroma starts with lemon and floral grapefruit with dark bread crust and caramel in the background. The flavor get a whole lot earthier with leather and herbal chocolate with graham crackers upfront. The hops enter with more lemon citrus and grapefruit that soon turns to fruit rind and bitter flowers. This is clearly a complex beer and worthy of consideration."
"D-oh so easy to drink very smooth and I could see myself having several on a sitting."
"Mouth is heavy for a ESB and incredibly well carbonated. drinks well but not too fast because of the ABV, whoa good!"
"It has a dark body and a rocky dark tan head. There is a lot of sediment in the body. The aroma is mainly of hops with a little bit of caramel malt. There was a little bit of a chemical like aroma too. I thinking maybe I have a bad bottle. I am going to rate it anyway but I want to try this one again. The flavor is very toffee and coffee like. It is pretty bitter it reminds me of more of a Porter. I like the flavor. Creamy mouthfeel with good amount carbonation."
"A bit of a hop kick to it, but not overpowering. Pretty good drinkability. This is an excellent Brown Ale."
"Drinkable?> Yeah, sure!"
" There wasn't anything memorable about this but it wasn't a bad choice for the warm weather either. I wish that were more beers of this style brewed here in the states, but this is a good launching point nevertheless. Just don't know when I'll get back out to Bitch Creek again..."
"Medium bodied, smooth and very drinkable."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0907-Sean"
"Overall I like the complexity of this beer and would drink again if I have the chance. Try it out with an open mind."
"D -- Very drinkable, especially in colder weather...a perfect compliment to MN. Overall, a very enjoyable beer with good character. Very much worth trying."
"D - Overall this is one easy to drink enjoyable beer if was available around me it would be in my regular rotation of beers worth trying"
"Poured into a pint glass the beer is a rusty brownish red. The head is plentiful and a creamy beige color. A nice ring of lace is left behind after the head slowy recedes. The aroma is a mix of malt and hops. The hops are much more aggresive of the two but, not overdone. There's hint of sweetness in the nose as well. The flavor is slightly piney with a bit of sour fruit and a bread like maltiness in the finish. Seems kind of funny to have bitter in the name when the beer isn't really bitter. Medium body not much carbonation. Overall a decent beer. The style is still a bit of a mystery to me. I will have to try a few more ESB beers to get a handle on them."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. Could easily do a session with this one, especially in fall or winter. Love the complex flavors in this one. A beautiful example of the ESB style. Easily my favorite of the Grand Teton beers I've tried (but the Sweetgrass IPA is nice, too)."
"This is a great ESB. One of my favorite styles, and Grand Teton did it right. I enjoyed this with lunch at Yelloystone National Park. Highly recommended."
"My first sip was all bitter tasting. It grabbed my tongue and held tight, but as I sipped more, the more flavors came out. There is actually a lot of completxity and big flavors to be had here once you get past the initial bitter shock."
"This beer was poured into a pint glass. When first poured the head of the beer was decent, not to ambitious. Sedimentation is present when pouring the last of the beer out of the bottle. The aroma of this beer is great floweral, hoppy and coriander is present. The taste of the beer good bitterness, a hoppy sweetness to the tastebuds. Overall a really great beer."
"The body was good, typical for the style. The drinkability was good as well. Overall, a solidly decent beer that if it were more regularly available to me, I'd mix into my regular rotation."
"Overall, this is a really good beer and the first ESB I've reviewed. You get the best of both worlds if you're a maltlover or hophead."
"D-I love this beer. I'll have to reach for it more frequently. Smooth and easy, whle also a little bit different."
"D-This is a pretty big ESB...I was surprised with the color and the profile overall. An ESB to savor and enjoy rather than to session with..."
"D=good beer, sessionable, and enjoyable."
"Blipped ""Life's a Bitch"" by Motorhead"
"Drinkability: easy to quaff. Definite session beer. Nice ESB that is worth trying."
"D - The extremes of this beer make it less drinkable for the average beer drinker...but extreme beer lovers with love it."
"Overall, this is a very good beer and one of the best on my Yellowstone/Grand Teton/SLC trip."
"A great take on an ESB from Grand Teton. At first I was concerned this beer was just a mediocre brew with a catchy name... but then I tasted it. This is my favorite ESB right now."
"All in all, a good drinkable ESP. This could use a little more body though... still a beer worth trying, and quite sessionable."
"This beer was a nice surprise and one I'd have again."
"This beer was a gift from a friend who had been to Idaho. I'm don't have a lot of experience with ESB's, but I know what I like, and I liked this beer a lot!"
"Dark brown with nice creamy head bottle poured into imperial pint glass - excellent lacing. Smells malty, earthy. Taste reminds me of a brown but with somewhat of a bitter finish - really not what I expected from an ESB. Mouthfeel was heavy - again not what I was expecting from an ESB. Drinkability diminished because it is very heavy. Can't see finishing two."
"Pours a clear red with a nice foamy medium beige head. Aroma is light malt with a little orange hop. Flavor is initially quite malty followed by a blast of bitter hops, the finish is long and kind of bready. Quite drinkable and a decent example of an ESB.."
"D: Good and tasty, still pissed about the pour though, it was an absolute mess."
"D - Good, but needs to be creamier. The color is a little dark and the alcohol content is high for the style."
"D= This was my first Grand Teton and though it was heavy for an ESB, it was a damn good ale. I would now like to try many other Grand Teton beers as well as have some more of this one!"
"Drinkability: My first beer from Grand Teton and I am thoroughly impressed. I can honestly say that I have never seen a beer with such a resinous, sticky head and lacing."
"Pours amber brown with a thin tan head. Some retention and very nice laceing. Aroma is bready with hints of carmel. Body is lighter than I expected with a good amount of carbonation. Taste is bready,and malty with some hops in the finish. Very good stuff."
"The beer pours a dark amber color with a 1/2"" offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a complex malt scent that screams burnt toffee and bisquits. The taste is decent. It has a smooth crystal malt and hops taste that's mildly bitter and a bit thin in the finish. The aroma suggests a heavier, warmer beer, but it doesn't carry over to the taste. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinker. It's complex, yet thin and easily quaffable."
"Excellent brew! I haven't had an ESB yet that could hold a candle to it, but now I'm going to have to start looking harder."
"Poured a weird orange-brown red with a non existent head. Aroma is of strong of hay and rabbit pellets. Im glad this doesn't taste how it smells. Flavor is of earthy bitter hops and weirdness. feel is tingly from the carbonation. The oddness of this beer will prevent me from ever buying another. There are much better ESBs out there."
"D: Goes down really easy, would love this on a summer night, very crisp and refreshing. I enjoyed this beer."
"M + D: Soft carbonation with a bit of tingling carbonation noted later in the mouth. Medium body, easier drinking. Not bad at all, and I'd be happy to try it again."
"D- very drinkable ESB. Well balanced with the right amount of bitterness. One of the nicest ESB's out there."
"thanks donkeyrunner!"
"Plain and simple, the best ESB I've ever had. Very complex and flavorful but still retains subtlety that is characteristic of style."
"D: not quite a session beer, however the alcohol is very well camoflauged, very very tasty"
"Overall, a nicely drinkable ESB. After having Fuller's ESB last night, I have to say this one lies between that and an American IPA/Pale Ale. Still a nice beer that shows off some caramel malts, and a nice mixture of bitter and flavorful hops. Certainly more aggressive in the bitterness department than its English counterparts."
"This was OK, but at a place like Roman's, it wouldn't be in the first 5 beers I'd recommend."
"Medium bodied, lightly lingering finish, ...tasty stuff. I'd drink one again,for sure."
"Flows well with mild bubbles and nice finish. I could probably drink another 2 or 5 of these because it has a nice refreshing quality to it. All in all, a decent brew."
"D: Drinks really easy with malts, hops and carbonation in pleasing balance. Might be a bit stronger than al lot of ESB's, but very tasty."
"Fairly drinkable beer, something I enjoyed trying for sure."
"For the style, I consider it very drinkable. This is the second ESB I've tried this week. I wasn't expecting much in the way of drinkability but I was surprised on both accounts. Craft beer from Idaho, why not?"
"D - Goes down smooth for being as hoppy as it is. Very drinkable."
"7/4/7/4/14 (3.6/5)"
"D - On the hoppy side. Tasty. Goes down easy."
"Drinkability: A solid ESB, a little strange in places, but interesting nonetheless. Alcohol may be a little high for the style, but it doesn't really matter - the spiciness of this one gives it a unique twist that's worth it. Give this one a shot. Idaho - done!"
"D: this one goes down easy and makes for an okay session. A little stronger than most esb's but still tasty and easy drinking. This is a revist to a beer I used to hate. Still not crazy about it but it is growing on me."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. This is a very good ESB. It is one of my favorite daily sippers. I am glad I have access to this beer."
"D - What a pleasant beer. Great flavors, balanced nicely. I could drink like 18 of these."
"Drinkability: Really more of an American take on the ESB style, with a flavor profile is dramatic and interesting"
"Bottle from Park Lane Liquor in Lancaster, CA. This beer is a dark brown color with ruby around the edges. Medium beige head that dissipates slowly, and spotty lacing. Aroma of bready malt, hops and touches of fruit. Medium-bodied and moderately bitter with flavors of hops, caramel malt and grain. The finish is hoppy with a lindgering bitterness. Not too bad for my first Idaho beer."
"Drinkability is fair - I could go for a second."
"Jk"
"A very nice beer and the first I've had from grand teton, definately gonna try more."
"Overall a very tasty and extremely easy to drink ESB, which sports a relatively robust ABV."
"All in all this is a very drinkable very sessionable ESB. A little more hop presence than one might expect, but a very nice brew just the same. I'd have it again."
"D - This is a very good ESB. A little hoppier than most."
"Pours a clear deep amber with a rocky beige head. Aroma is lightly sweet with caramel, earthy hops, dark chocolate and light nut. The flavor is medium sweet chocolate, earthy, caramel, floral and toffee. Medium body, chewy texture. Finishes long and nicely bitter."
"12 oz. bottle served in a shaker pint glass. Poured a dark amber with a finger of tan head. Nice malty aroma with caramel/molasses and some hops. Medium bodied with a rich malt profile. More caramel and a lingering chocolate malt flavor. Dry finish from both malt and hops. Fair amount of hop bitterness for the style. Very drinkable. Great beer for malt lovers."
"D - exceptional... that is if 51 IBU's does as much for you as it does for me."
"D: slightly higher than average ABV, but overall a good tasting ESB with a nice nutty aftertaste."
"Wow, it's been awhile since I've had an ESB. This was really good. It's a style I've have to look into revisiting more often."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D: Drinks good. You must not crave extreme hops for hate dark fruit, though."
"An okay ESB, certainly an american frankenstein on the style. A good enough drinker, though its so full and thick that it goes down slow."
"D: Didn't really care for this one so much. I'm not hop-averse by any means, but I do like more balance in an ESB than this one offered. Also, its 6.5% ABV raises it above being 'sessionable' (i.e. even if I really liked this one, I couldn't go for more than a couple at a sitting). May give it another try somewhere down the road."
"If you love the hop though, you'll be well satisfied. And you gotta love the name..."
"The taste is malty up front and has some good caramel tones to it. You get a very slight bitterness on the back end but not much. In the mouth it is light and carbonation is pretty low. Overall a nice beer but I will have to stick with the brutal."
"very nice and smooth, yet with more character than most esb's I've had and much more memorable. a very tasty and different ale"
"This is my first Grand Teton experience and it's been a good one. I honestly didn't know what to expect from an ESB crafted in Idaho. But, it's good. The nose could stand some work. Other than that, it's a fine effort. It's a little left of center from most ESBs out there and I'm a fan."
"D: Nice as a session beer or with food."
"Poured into a snifter, nice amber color with some ruby hints. Tan head on top with a nice retention level. Bitch Creek has a bitter hoppy aroma, which smells like Kent Goldings. Along with this is slightly sweet apple aroma from the malts. As for taste, very nice malt backbone, followed by some great mild bitters from the hops. Some apple flavors, but mostly just a well-balance of English hops and crystal malts. Mouthfeel is very smooth and damn near perfect for this style. In my opinion, it is a very nice drinking ESB and a good representation of the style."
"d: I like it. I would say its growing on me. My initial impression was just another ESB. But I now feel it is solidly above average. Nice hop kick, the malt and hops pair well together. Highly drinkable."
"D: It was a pleasant brew that was a bit hoppier than I anticipated but reasonably well balanced and a pleasure to sample. I could easily see spending some time drinking this brew."
"I don't know how well this fit the style but it was interesting enough to be enjoyed. Worth a try..."
"This beer continues to grow on me as I drink. I don't visit this style too often and truthfully I'm not sure why. This is an excellent beer that would make a great quaffer if the abv wasn't so high. The 6.5% is unnoticeable."
"Edit: As it warms, it is really reminding me of recent tasting of Stone's 8th Anniversary (an aged Imperial Mild?)... simply very good and very balanced."
"Pours a dark ruby amber with a nice tan two finger head that slowly dies down. Stickiness is great, very full all over the sides. Smell is a big caramel malt with an earthy hop mix. Great nose for this style, very inviting. Taste is quite bready with good malt flavors of caramel, chocolate, and a bit of licorice. Could use some more hop flavor, but pretty good balance overall. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied for this style, I'm liking it. Carbonation is fairly mild as well. I was very surprised by this brew, I really look forward to trying more from this brewery. I have the waxed flip-top Maibock waiting for a special occasion. Thanks again Dan!"
"Tangy with shades of an oily finish, this was a great way to start off the 2007 NFL season! This would be a great six pack afternoon sipper."
"D: A great ESB, came right out of left field, I never had anything from this brewery before, so I continue to look forward to trying more of their brews in the future, thanks to Hi-Times for finally having some of their brews in single bottles, so I can try them. A great find if you are in the West."
"Reviewed from notes."
"This is a stellar brew. I always wondered about this style. I used to feel that pale ales and IPA's really covered the necessary requirement for these beers and that ESB's just blended in either way. Boy was I wrong. This ESB is definitely hoppier than a pale ale, and has much better malt background than most IPA's. Furthermore, it pours a dark caramel color with a fluffy two inch head. I had this about a year ago at a friend's house in Denver, but couldn't find it here in the Springs. I finally was able to acquire a handful and will savor each and every one."
"Mouthfeel is a solid medium body with good carbonation. Bitter, slightly drying finish. Thanks to Boolshot for this bottle. I would grab this if it was available in my area. Smooth, easy drinker."
"A delicious ESB and one that should not be missed."
"Medium-full body, fairly low carbonation. Coats as it goes down, but not syrupy. Balance is good, even though both malt & hops are very prominent, neither overpowers the other. I'd rate drinkability as good, and could easily see downing a few of these in an evening."
"from Boolshot for my Anny bombing"
"Other notes: Nothing wrong with it really, I am having it again as I write this review, and I shall have it again. It has a body that is toward the medium side of things."
"Drinkability - Very quaffable and highly refreshing, but after a couple I'm ready for something different."
"Drinkability- Very good. A very ABV to give you the opportunity to drink more normal. Got a very pleasent taste and a lightness to it. Really enjoyed this beer."
"Overall, this was a very nice surprise! I usually don't like ESBs, but this is a lot fruitier with the west coast hops. It's more like a weak barleywine or Arrogant Bastard."
"Bright, citrusy, floral, leafy, grassy, piney, and metallic hops leap out at you in Bitch Creek's ESB, almost challenging you to take a sip! There's also some berry-like yeasty fruitiness, and some mild chocolate and dark caramel malt underneath, giving it quite a round and welcoming nose. The body is medium; and it's delicate, median carbonation caresses the tastebuds. The deep chestnut body has a crimson and ruby cast that's reminiscent of old, polished leather furniture; and the creamy tan head holds long enough to make an impression, and then continues to leave walls of spotty lace once it's dropped. Rich, caramelized sugars and a bit of nuttiness dominate the malty side of the flavor; juicy yeasty fruitiness livens it (apples, red berries, prunes, pear); and citrusy, leafy, grassy, mineralish, floral and subtly piney/minty hops round it out with a raspy edge. A bold bitterness anchors it, but there's enough girth to the maltiness that it doesn't appear as ""bitter!"". It finishes drying as the sweetish and distinctly caramelish maltiness fades, and the piney and resinous hops rise - both softened along the way by a soft, smooth cushion of underlying orange-like citrus. Nice!"
"Good drinkability really. Nothing turns me off about this beer. Its pretty straightforward and easy to put down."
"D - Not what I expected from an ESB, but the bitterness showed after I drank more. Most enjoyable one I've had from Grand Teton, and it would make for an excellent session beer."
"Pours a nice clear dark amber color, nice carbonation, nice little creamy tan head that lasts awhile, nice islands and sticky lacing throughout the brew. The scent is malty, hoppy, and lots of caramel. The taste is sweet/malty, with a very nice bitter/caramel finish. Medium body. Very drinkable, a very nice ESB, one of the best I've had. Highly recommended."
"12oz. bottle poured a very dark amber with a large off white head that stuck to the glass. Big caramel malt aroma. Lots of malt in the taste some caramel and burnt/roasted flavors also with a bit of a watery taste and old stale hop presence in the back ground. Mouth feel like the taste seems thin and watery. This one is so thin it goes down easy but the stale hop taste is not pleasing and kills the drink ability."
"ESB means Extra Special Bitter. And Bitter is what Bitch Creek is all about. Nice coppery color and a subtle aroma waft up from the glass. Low head and moderate carbonation are to style. The bitterness is a little pronounced, even a little astringent. The brewers may want to spend a week in London putting back a few real pints of the Bitter to see what the taste is all about."
"Beer poured a nice looking deep ruby red but had no head. Nose is nice, of citrus and floral hops. Taste is a wonderful balance between the malts and the citrusy hops. Mouthfeel is lively on the palate with a medium to full body. Overall drinkability is very good. This is a fine example of the American ESB style!"
"A friend gave me this, I was wary since he said it tasted metallic and I dislike metallic tasting beers. I was pleasantly surprised by this one though, the bitterness came through more like tea than metal so it was pretty good."
"Pours dark translucent mahogany, reminds me of Coke. No head, not lacing, lightly carbonated, almost looks flat. Smell consists of slightly sweet caramel malts but is overpowered by stinky hops and alcohols. Taste isn't as gross as I would have expected from the smell, surprisingly balanced compared to the nose. Again, light caramels, not very malty with a fair amount of hops and some alcohol peeking through. Reminds me of a cross between an IPA and a watered down stout. Overall, not as bad as I would have thought."
"2004 GABF - Gold - American Brown Ale"
"Great drinkability. Excellent example of the style."
"D - Yeah, I could drink a lot of this. ESB is one of my favorite styles, and this is one of the best I've had."
"I don't know this brewer, although I've seen several offerings at BevMo. But, you know what? This is one of the better ESB's I've ever had. A nice cloudy red-clay brown with a small but decent head, with aromas of slightly sweet roasty caramel malts, and a hint of bitter. But the flavor retains these nice aromas with a solid but not overwhelming hop bite that really brings it all together. I really like this one. Glad I got a sixer- I may need to get some more!"
"Looks like flat coke with a hint of red when it pours. not very appetizing. taste, on the other hand, is quite good. perfect amount of hop bitterness and some nice fruity sweetness to balance it out. mouthfeel is a bit too thin, but that only detracts the slightest bit. a very quaffable esb, that i would enjoy having the pleasure to sip throughout the day."
"Doesn't fit the style guidelines strictly, but it is very good."
"Deep brown in color, but with some attactive ruby highlights. Large frothy cream colored head forms, drops a bit, but sits on top pretty well. Caramel malty aroma with resinous,earthy hops. In the taste the hops are quite resinous as well, piney and flora, with just a little lingering citrus. There is a crisp sweetness from the malt, crystal and/or red malt flavors, some apple like sweetness as well. Pretty darn good ESB."
"D: Tasty, easy-to-drink, not very filling, I could drink a few of these in a row. This style isn’t one of my favorites, but this particular beer is one of the better ESB’s that I’ve had."
"May be my favorite of ESBs...very bright and clean tasting with great drinkability and some incredible complexity for this style. Revisiting this one after several months just makes it better."
"Thanks to bitterbill for this one!"
"Dark reddish brown with a really nice thick creamy tan head. the nose has lots of floral, bitter hops, but a good amount of malt too. I pick up a litle caramel as well on a last sniff. There is plenty of those hops when I take my first taste. There's some balance provided by some nicely roasted maly, again, a little caramel. The beer itslef is a little mouth heavy, along with the bitterness of the hops and the alcohol, makes this too big for an all night type of beer, but it is otherwise really enjoyable."
"Pours with a tannish, yellow head that is fluffy, thick, like the top of clouds, and fell with a solid lace. This a clear American interpretation of the British style, seemingly doubling up on the malt and hops. Very solid hop smell, but balance by an equally strong malt presence full of fruity esters-raison and caramel along with the citrusy hop character. Thick mouthfeel makes is very fun to drink, though clearly overhopped for an ESB--don't try to turn a macro drinker on this one (give him a Redhook)."
"D - Good stuff."
"Poured into a pint glass from bottle. Color was a deep copper with a one-finger head. Fine streams of small bubbles and some lacing. Aroma was mild caramel and toffee and a barely noticible hop aroma. Taste was primarily caramel malt with some hop flavor. It was very drinkable and a nice representation of the style."
"Thanks to blitheringidiot for picking this up for me while on his travels."
"I found it to be a pleasurable experience and will refer to it the next time I pick up an ESB."
"Thanks to bditty187 for this one, it's just as good as you said it was."
"Pours a nice copper red hue with medium crown. It is a little bit hazy with a few rising streams of bubbles. Head retention is average. A nice hoppy aroma. The taste is good, with a bit of malt at the front and a nice hoppy finish to balance it out quite nicely. This also gives the beer a nice layering effect. It's easy to drink and refreshing, I would definately drink more but unfortunately I only have one."
"A super quaffable, I think this leans towards an English style ESB with American style. No matter how you slice it, one of the best ESBs I've had!"
"This is extremely drinkable. Again, screw the style I could buy a six-pack and go to town. I bet this would be great with burgers or any grilled meat. Oh my, I just thought how great this would be on cask! Lordy! Anyway, I sought out this beer because I wanted to cross-off Idaho from my must try a beer from all 50 states list. I did. But this beer is more memorable than that. This is really good! Thank you Bitterbill!"
"Taste was similar, nice balance. The citrus cuts the chocolate apart so that the thickness is clean. Remains a bit thin, however that adds to the drinkability. One of my favorites in the region."
"Good beer, great with Italian food."
"The taste is very well balanced and hits my taste buds just right. Sweet caramel tones in the malt with just a touch of bitterness with the hops. Good stuff!!"
"The carbonation is light, which is expected. Also there was a medium body that blended well. Good beer. I should make a clone of this beer and call it Son of a Bitch."
"Otherwise a good standby beer, with an interesting hop character. Go try it at least once."
"One inch of dense, tan head leaves lots of small sticky spots. The beer is clear, dark red. Nice. Sweet pruney aroma: tangy, with dark malt. Almost a little barleywine-ish. Tangy and chocolatey in front. Rich, thick, big chocolate malt in the middle with a fruity, bitter chocolate finish. Overall: tasty, with very dark malt and bitter chocolate. But I don't really get the ""ESB"" out of this (more like a chocolate brown ale)."
"I gotta admit, I didn't expect a brew quite this good. I'd never sampled anything from this brewery before tonight, and I just had the Sweetgrass IPA followed by this impressive brew. They've left quite the good impression.. Glad my local store is going to have this on stock from now on. Well worth trying if you find it."
"This beer pours a brownish red with a tan head. The head fades slowly, leaving thick laces. This beer smells piney. The hop aroma is strong, but not overwhelming. Behind the piney, slightly floral aroma, I detect some caramel malty aromas. This beer does not taste as hoppy as the aroma leads you to believe. It is actually rather malty. The hop flavor is there, but just not the strongest. The blend of hops and malts balance quite nicely. It has slight caramel and toasted malt flavors also. This beer is carbonated quite nicely. It goes down smooth, leaving a sweet, but also hoppy aftertaste. I think this beer would make a great session beer. It is not too high in alcohol, and the flavor is smooth and mild. I am glad that this beer has recently been made available to my area. I will more than likely buy this one again. Try it if you can find it."
"Overall a solid thumbs up....cant wait to try another from this brewer."
"Dark, singed amber body with a small, yet persistent, guaze of light brown head. Darker than expected, and looks great. Nose is quite malty, with sticky brown sugar, and a whiff of cotton candy, mixed with toffee. Fresh hop aromas back it up; slightly citrusy, but mostly resinous and herbal. Toasted malt flavors up front. Sweetish toffee makes a fleeting appearance mid-palate, followed by swelling hops. Bitter, herbal, resinous, and slightly minty. Oh, and delicious. Medium bodied, with a minerally to slightly creamy feel. A big ESB in the vein of Belk's. Nice."
"This Bitch Creek Ale was a pleasant surprise. When poured in the glass, it was an amber color with very little foam. The smell of hops and roasted malts, filled the nose with a very pleasant aroma. The taste of hops and roasted malts was very evident with a hint of a caramel flavor. Like I said, what a pleasant surprise this ale was. Watch out, here I come for a case next purchase."
"The taste was also predominantly malted though it was complimented but a robust bitterness perfect for a summer afternoon. There was a slight sweetness to the beer but most of the profile was of older, thicker malt flavors. The malt also imparted a slightly sour, astringent you'd get with an amber, and complimented by the bitterness, it had a crisp flavor. Decent beer though, and an odd option in San Francisco."
"Overall impression: This is a bit bigger than many of the ESBs I have tried before, but it is very well done. Nicely balanced and drinkable - could be dangerous with the relatively high ABV. Definitely worth a try if you can find it!"
"Nice name. Thanks to kmpitz2 for this one. This one pours a light brown color with a small head that leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is slightly hoppy, as it should be, but I think they used American hops in here. Flavor is right on. Slightly strong bitter with a good malt backing to balance out the flavors. Drinkability is good and the mouthfeel is pretty right on. Good brew."
"This one was brought back from Idaho on a trip a few months back. The beer pours a slightly rubied brown color, a bit too dark for my liking. Much darker than expected. The nose is mostly grapefruity hop, with some dirty hops playing in the background as well. I think it smells nice. The flavor is a nice burst of citrus hop, followed with a touch of caramel, finishing with a nice bitter kick. I do like it. Wow. A really nice beer. The feel is a little thin, well below a moderate feel to me. Drinkability is awesome. The nice residual bitter that the hop leaves keeps me wanting more and more."
"Pours to a ruby brown color with a tan head that diminishes to just a ring. The aroma is citrusy and fruity with a sweet malt backbone. The flavor is malty and citrusy with a nice hop bitterness in the finish. It is medium in body, and easy drinking. Better than I was expecting."
"This beer is NOT a British ESB and to my judgement leans far too heavily on the American hops. It is an interesting beer which I would call an American Brown Ale or an American IPA rather than an ESB."
"I've been impressed by Grand Teton. Sweetgrass IPA was a good one and I still have Teton Ale (APA) to sample. If things hold true to form, it'll be a keeper as well. Many thanks to Ragsdale for a trio (I'm hoping) of wonderful Idaho beers."
"Consumed in October 2004. My girlfriend bought this back for me from Montana. But, she was unaware of my dislike of ESB beers. I'm not sure why I don't like them. I love IPA's and double IPA's and similar bitter beers. But, I have had a few ESB's and usually can barely get them down. Maybe I just need to experiment. It pours very nicely. A deep reddish-brown color and with a big head that just now went away (after about 5 minutes). The lacing is very nice too. You can smell the bitterness. Some piney hops as well. Afraid to try...here it goes...Hmmm, definitely an ESB and it was hard to swallow that first gulp. Definite pine hop taste and HUGE toffee or burnt coffee taste with a dry stout like finish. The aftertaste won't go away. Kinda like that cigar aftertaste, it just lingers. I guess for an ESB it's not too bad. I wouldn't get it again, but will rate it accordingly. Different and if I did like ESB's, I'll bet I would like it."
"One of the guys at Brewers of South Suburbia brought over this bottle to our meeting. Interesting yellow-brown color and a fizzy head. Pretty tasty, actually overhopped for a bitter, but at least it's not aggresive not aggresive like an American IPA."
"Ruddy garnet hue with a light haze. Burly, two fingered, dogged tan head leaves intricate lace. Notes of orange zest drizzled with pine sap hit the nose at first. Following are gentle wafts of lightly buttery dark toffee and trace plum ester hints. Quite appetizing and well rounded aromawise. Dominant in flavor is a balanced combination of sweet grainy biscuit, juicy ripe tangerine and moderate, citrus pith notes. Dark lovibond caramel malt with a drying, toasty edge surfaces as the beer warms. Mellow red apple like ester add subtle, complementary fruit hints. Dextrinous, with an agreeably creamy, viscous, yet brisk mouthfeel. Apple character augments late and tartens slightly, but this only aids the drinkability and isn't at all obtrusive. Finishes with marmalade and burnt toast hints fading quickly. A delicious brew with both American IPA and traditional ESB elements. Very well crafted, unique, and superbly drinkable, indeed."
