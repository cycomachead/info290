In terms of taste, it was a pretty run of the mill nut brown: malty, caramel notes, definite nuttiness, little bit of toffee. However, the killer for me was the aftertaste. I just couldn't shake a horrible lingering of cigar/cigarette smoke in the aftertaste. Had my gf try the beer, and she didn't notice it as much. But I couldn't get past it...every sip. Pretty much ruined the beer for me. I'd probably prefer Newcastle to this...","Brewblues","Sep 29, 2011"

Flavors are light restrained, some caramel malt/darker earthiness with cereal grains and a but of husk character. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, moderate carbonation levels, the Peak Organic brews as a whole have confused me. Twist off bottles, certified organic decent beer overall just nothing awe inspiring that's never been done before.

3.83,10.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, 12 oz. bottle. This beer treads a very fine line between amber and brown in my opinion, especially when held up to the light When you do so it has nothing to hide with excellent clarity. In the initial pour there is a light off-white creamy colored head that slowly fades throughout the session, small amounts of lace slowly tread and trickle back to the liquid after each sip. The smell is good, like most in this style it's well malted, slight hints of toffee, hops make themselves known but don't exactly jump out at you, some slight herbal tea aromas as well. Tastes better than it smells. Again well malted possibly some chocolate malts here. I think there are certainly some blended malts here, both roasted and smoked, possibly peat but as strong as it tends to be. Like English Browns the malts outweigh the hops but hops are present and provide a good combination of all the flavors, burps up nice too. The mouthfeel is good, slightly lighter than I expected, but still good. I find some of this style to be a little buttery at times but this one is mostly clean, well certainly finishes that way. Drinkablility is good.","AndyAvalanche","Aug 09, 2010"

Slight hops and a touch of graininess, but the aroma seems a touch disjointed and a tad sour.

Possibly there are only early addition hops so the aroma is all malt aromas and residual sugars...? Taste is very sweet and likable at first sip, but too sweet, and the lack of hops reveals the roasted charred malt as a detectable flavor in and of itself, as opposed to having some hops in there for a clean finish to mask the charred flavor directly, where it would instead be part of the mix of flavors that adds to the complexity and smoothness. Two extremes, syrupy sweet/nutty, and charred malt. Sad; the more i drink the less I like it. Good in a sample size. Mouthfeel is standard medium-light. Drinkability - this could be impressive if tweaked and ANY hops at all were present in the flavor - I'm no hophead, but I mean this is not even "English" kind of hop amounts, its more like "theres hops in here?"

Malt and some mild hoppy bitterness in good balance. Very enjoyable and drinkable, interesting to the end, a complex interplay of different woody and smoky aspects.","kenito799","Dec 29, 2007"
3.53,1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice small one-finger creamy tan head, some nice small islands and sticky lacing follows. The nose is malty, slightly bitter, with some caramel. The taste is malty, bitter, slight roastyness, and caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, better than I expected.","Wasatch","Dec 22, 2007"

3.81,9.5,4,3,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours a deep brown ruby with good clairty and a sturdy film of head that covers the whole top of beer.Even a little lacing. The nose is a mild hint of pecan and butter cream. These scents lower a bit when the beer is sipped. There is an overall nutty, grainy mixturefinished with some mild English hops. The start and middle of each sip is brunt of this beers flavor profile. he finish is a slow then than a soft watery note. Perfect session beer in any English style American pub.","scruffwhor","Dec 02, 2007"

In the taste, a sweet malt with notes of caramel and chocolate. A smooth malty mouthfeel with a sweet malty aftertaste. A nice brown, not too heavy with a nice balance. Easy to drink, nice for fall.","OWSLEY069","Oct 21, 2007"

3.33,-4.3,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Not a bad beer, but not even close to being my favoriate nut brown. It did have a nice brown appearance with a decent head, but that was its best attribute. The scent was fine, but nothing spectacular; an all right malty scent. It had a good flavor, but I wish there would've been a more nutty aspect to it. That it was organic was a nice touch, though.","JamesS","Sep 16, 2007"
4.11,18.1,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a hazy translucent brown/copper with nearly an inch of off-white head. Smells nutty and fruity. Tastes nutty and fruity at first, with a pleasant roasty coffee and chocolate quality emerging toward the finish. A slight astringency toward the finish too. Very drinkable - one sip definitely invites another. Medium creamy body with a decent amount of carbonation. Wow, what a good brown ale. A new favorite for the style!","MrHurmateeowish","Aug 18, 2007"

3.13,-10.1,3.5,3,3.5,2,3,"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Poured a reddish brown color, was definately translucent. Had a foamy head that lasted a few minutes, but then left a small layer of bubbles, as well as tracings down the side of the glass. Smell was of oatmeal and wheat bread. Tasted earthy, and had a sweet ending to the taste. Felt way to watery in the mouth, and left a bitterness that wasn't noticable anywhere else. It is very easy to drink, almost goes down to quick.","mountdew1","Jul 24, 2007"
3.65,4.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I had this on tap with dinner at Ruby's Oyster Bar in Rye, NY. The appearance was OK, dark reddish brown hue, somewhat clear, with a thick and fragile looking white foam. The aroma had all kinds of things in it, hard to distinguish from a porter in my opinion. There was a little bit of nuttiness (go figure, the name probably put that in my head) and some chocolate, and also some roasted malt. The taste is chocolate and caramel, but not as good as those two descriptors would imply. Still, those are the first adjectives which came to mind. No real bitterness detected in the after-taste, whatever hops are in here are for balance alone. Pretty well done overall, but I just don't get the "organic" thing when it comes to beer. Beer is already pretty organic I think, the ingredients are pretty simple and actually sound hippy-ish and organic on their own.","TurdFurgison","Jul 20, 2007"
4.1,17.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Very tasty, very drinkable. Lots of flavor and pretty complex without getting extreme in any respect and without trying to knock anyone down with malt or hops or alcohol.","far333","Jul 20, 2007"

3.65,4.9,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a wonderful pale and crystal malt scent that is sweet and malty with a nice English yeast fruitiness. The taste is decent. It has a solid malt base with a nice nutty flavor. It also has quite a bitter finish, that is a bit out of character for this style. It goes down easy and finishes a bit dry with some malty notes. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer. It's a bit out of style, but not a bad session beer. One of the better organic beers I've had.","WesWes","Jul 06, 2007"
3.8,9.2,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a clear, reddish amber color topped by a light brown, thick head. There is some pretty decent lacing. The aroma is sweet and fruity accompanied by apricot, caramel apples and berries. The taste is nutty and bready with some decent hop bitterness and sweet malts. A good example of the style.","abcsofbeer","Jul 04, 2007"
2.36,-32.2,4,3,2,2,2,"D- I couldn't finish this. I was in the mood for an english brown and this didn't taste like one to me. If it were a blind tasting where I didn't have a style in mind I would give it another chance. It's not terrible...just not very good.","PittBeerGirl","Jun 19, 2007"
2.9,-16.7,3,3,3,3,2.5,"Pours a dark brown color with a head that seems too fizzy. Aroma is malty and sweet, almost like molasses. Taste is also too fizzy. Hints of malt and some coffee notes come out of the taste. Not much else follows. The bottle is good until August of this year so I have no idea why it seems so carbonated. Somewhat dull overall though.","Brad007","Jun 05, 2007"

4.3,23.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This was a fabulous beer. More bitter than the typical nut brown, and finished with a great nutty flavor. The bitterness was balanced perfectly by how smooth it is. Both chocolate and munich malts are detectable. It has characteristics similar to both the Dogfish Head India Brown Ale and Samuel Smith's brown. I will definitely drink this again. The 4.7 ABV is perfect for the style.","n0rmann","Aug 16, 2006"
4.2,20.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"12 ouncer, with best before dating notched onto the label, this one pours typical light brown, with some reddish hues, clear and supporting a thick tan head, that leaves behind thick, scattered lacing. Nose is of nutty malts. This is another tasty creation from Shipyard, brewed under contract, with the Peak Organic label upon it. Nutty, malty and flavorful, with notes of vanilla, honey, cashews, caramel and malty goodness. Subtle, drying hops late finish off this classy sessioner. Well worth a try and recommended highly.","Billolick","Jul 18, 2006"

4.3,23.6,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This is a great Nut Brown Ale! Not far off from a Samuel Smith's version but with a little added hop bite and some more roastiness. Really satisfying and easy to drink. This would make a great session brew for sure. My first Peak Organic experience and I must say I'm impressed. Cheers people!","generationmy","Jul 05, 2006"
