The nose comprises nutty toffee, light graham cracker, and a twinge of dark greenery. The taste brings in more of the same, with the toffee coming through a touch sweeter, and a tiny rivulet of cocoa powder peeking its way through every now and again. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly slick feel. Overall, despite being a touch thin, this is an enjoyable little everyday drink.

Aromas of tangy sweet nut and toffee, blending well but coming off as cloying. Hints of roast in the nose, but sugary characters overpower. Flavors are roasty, with a hazelnut backbone that is rich and sweet. Some creamy highlights throughout, also. The light body is made almost thin by the carbonation levels.

The aroma is lightly brown sugar sweet, with a moderate roasted grain edge, and a kiss of caramel. It is a very subtle smelling brew, which I like for this one. Taking a drink, I find a light caramel balancing a moderate roast, moving into a caramel and brown sugar sweet again, finishing with a mild bitter bite with a touch of herbalness in the hop. Mouthfeel is moderate with a mild carbonation. It feels nice and full and compliments the flavor nicely. This is easily a session brew.

Fruit aromas up front: apple, melon, and other tart estery scents, with bready malts lurking in the background. Green apple and tannic green grape flavors right at the start of the sip yield to an expansive earthiness, with floral hop notes dancing along. Slight mineral twang near the finish, which is overall mildly sweet and reminiscent of whole-grain bread. Spicy hop flavors lend a rather sharp aspect to the mouthfeel; smooth, perhaps a bit overcarbonated. Light to medium body. In all, a very solid session brown. I'm more a fan of these earthy/spicy browns than the nutty ones, so I may be predisposed to like this. Would be very nice on cask, I imagine.","orfeu","Nov 16, 2006"

A fluffy two fingered head forms and gently recedes to film. The aroma is dominated by brown sugar on top of a fairly nice malt bed. The taste is full of a very complex malt base with a nice blast of brown sugar. There is a nuttiness in the background, coming from the malt. No discernible hop element. It finishes much the way it starts, but with maybe a touch of a metallic taste to it. There is a hint of chocolate in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but a surprisingly strong burst of carbonation holds everything together. Drinkability is great because the brown sugar and malt base never become too sweet, a common problem in browns, especially without a hop element. This is a very enjoyable beer that would probably be sublime on cask.

Occasional fat bubbles pop off here and there, but overall it is a pretty calm brew. The nose is very pleasing and mild. A somewhat oaken ambiance supports brown sugar and nuttiness. A bit of hop character comes through in the nose as well lending a fresh air of peaty earth. The flavour is very pleasing and mild also. The sweetness of malt and brown sugary texture make up the brunt of the taste. Hops lend a nice subtlety and tip the scales to equilibrium. Enjoyable to say the least.

Earthy hops come in and provide excellent balance. A biscuity yeast flavor lies underneath along with some notes of almonds. Finish is moderate and balanced.

Palate is again quite roasty on the front, mellowing into a more balanced profile as the hops come out mid-palate. Finish is slightly smoky, but disippates quickly.

Initially this beer starts out a bit earthy, but quickly moves on to a full malt flavor. There's a decent amount of roasty malts that mix back and forth with a slight molasses flavor. In the middle there are some smokey ashy tones, with a bit of astringency and yet more roasty malt. Where the initial flavors lack, the finish to this brew makes up for it with a crisp bread and biscuit like flavor and just a hint of bitter spiciness from the hops. Carbonation was a little over the top to this brew which took away a bit of the flavor and mouthfeel to this brew.

The head eventually recedes to a thin cap on top but does have some retention and leaves thin wisps of lace on the way down. The aroma is faint, some subtle caramel tones, really light toasty and coffee aromas, and faint esters. The taste is basically the same thing, maybe I pick up a faint smokiness in here, and the finish has a smooth toasted nuttiness.

The beer poured a light brown color with very active carbonation, although the large head dissipated somewhat over time. Very little noticeable lacing here. After a whiff of slight metallic smell, a strong malt aroma dominated. Subtle hop bitterness arrived in sporadic pcokets here and there, but this wasn't very sustainable. A drier finish and aftertaste was noted. The noticeable fizziness on the tongue almost made this feel like ale soda - this was somewhat detracting to the overal taste. I was somewhat disappointed with this brown ale. While I did expect a stronger malt presence, the hops seemed even more suppressed or weakened than usual. The Real Ale wasn't Really all that bad.

Mouthfeel was nice, but I thought the hops on tap were a bit muted. I also noticed some coffee notes with this one. I think I will go for this in the bottle before I go for it on tap again. Not bad, but not great. pat","PatandDavid","Jan 04, 2004"

2.94,-16.7,2,3,3,3,3,"Notes: Ive had this brew op tap and it was excellent, the bottled product is average and seen to me as a travesty to what the brewery really is.","Jason","Sep 27, 2003"
3.88,9.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Taste is spicy and malty. I swear the first taste that comes to mind is spicy BBQ sauce. Nice body and fizzy with a light hop aftertaste. Medium bodies and tapers off at the end. I have always loved that this is Atlantic's flagship beer. They didn't make a pale ale or a light lager to sell to the tourists like many other Maine breweries. They made their signature beer a brown ale. Ballsy. Not the strongest brown ale I have tasted but complex and solid. Dark yet drinkable.","ViveLaChouffe","Sep 23, 2003"
3.48,-1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The taste is initially nice. Very malty up front with a sweetness in the middle, then countered with some hop at the end. Mouthfeel was average with some mild carbonation. Not a bad beer by any means but nothing to go out of your way for. A decent session brew.","yankeeheel","Sep 06, 2003"
3.85,9.1,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Light mahogany color with a beige head that settles quickly. Faint smell of dates, brown sugar, and molasses. Roasty flavor of dark malts, coffee, and hot chocolate. Aftertaste of raisin, and a trace of a lingering hop presence. Smooth mouthfeel, but could have more fullness. Not an over-the-top beer, but very good, and very drinkable.","far333","Aug 08, 2003"
4,13.3,4,4,4,4,4,"A good ale, but for some reason it's neither here nor there. Don't know if that makes much sense, but go ahead and have a beer while you scratch your head over what I just wrote.","86MonteSS","Aug 06, 2003"
3.85,9.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Not a bad beer at all, but nothing I'd make a serious effort to find. Very drinkable, and would definitely make a great session brew. This would be a great beer for fishing or the beach, if you're in the mood for something a little more robust.","UnionMade","Jul 26, 2003"
3.87,9.6,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"A very dark brown ale with smallish head and good lace. Fruity aroma with dark roasty qualities. Lots of brown sugar in initial caramel rush, some raw grass qualities which taste infinitely more appealing than they sound. Despite big sweet caramel malt presence this beer is not at all cloying; hops step in at the right moment to cleanse the palate and leave you with a bitter finish that calls out for another sip. This is a serious beer for serious Maine weather; a bright summery day like this, while delightful, does not allow this beer to let its colors shine.","Thrasher","Jul 13, 2003"
3.48,-1.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste: Initial rush of carbonation folds away to a certain sweetness, just a hint of hop bite. As the carbonation dies away and the beer foams in my mouth, the sweetness continues, again with ever-so-slight bittersweet chocolate notes. Finishes tight, with a definite lingering sweet, raw grain ""feedbag"" taste. Hops dry things out nicely in the end.","rabidawg","Jul 10, 2003"
3.78,7.1,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"A very decent beer. Nice brown color with white head makes for an appealing beginning. Fresh smelling, without any hops jumping out at you. This beer is all about tase; sweet and malty, there are clear flaovors of brown sugar and maybe even molasses. This beer is not too sweet, as it dries out a bit into an even smoothness. Even though it's a little heavy for me to drink more than one or two, it is a solid American brown ale.","AaronRed","May 29, 2003"
3.5,-0.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"As it sets in the glass an incarnadine color, the head is prodigious in size, the structure made from a googol of tiny bubbles, makes me want to put on a Don Ho 8 track tape. The color a winsome tan and as it erodes a fine coating of lace is left behind to conceal the glass. Sweetly malt is the nose, crisp and fresh, the start malt and somewhat sweet, the top skinny in feel to the palate. Finish has a mild acidity, the hops perky in the spicy bite, dry and long lasting aftertaste, a nice session beer me thinks!","Gusler","May 10, 2003"
4.2,19,4,4,4.5,4,4,"A creamy brown ale, well, that was my take on it's taste. It was wholesome, as wholesome as a beer can be. Poured a nice brown color, but it had a character all of it's own, one that I will be meeting again. Great balance of malt and hops, but primarily the malts are what give it it's great taste.Just plain good.","bewareOFpenguin","Mar 09, 2003"
3.1,-12.2,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"This ale pours a light brown with a tan head that dissipates fast. The aroma is of roasted malt with hints of smokiness. The taste is light and refreshing with little or no after taste. The body of this ale is also light with no real mouthfeel. Personally I would like to see a little more body and maltiness to this ale. The brewers have done a decent job creating a real ale product in a bottle. It just needs something to make it a little more special and beyond average, IMHO.","purplehops","Nov 23, 2002"
3.88,9.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This ale presents with a deep dark brown color and a foamy tan head.  The lighter body falls into line with the dry malt character, which is what I usually prefer in a brown.  Drinkable and pretty tasty.","beernut7","Nov 04, 2002"
4.3,21.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Nice tasty beer with a dark brown color and a good light beige head. Sweet toasty malt aroma with some flowery hops mixed in and a toasted malt flavor to match. Just enough hop bitterness helps to balance the flavor and make this a very drinlkable brew.","MaineBeerMan","Oct 25, 2002"
4.05,14.7,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Brown coloring with an off-white head that quickly vanished. Primarily toasty malt aromas with a bit of earthiness. Light carbonation contributes to the slick mouthfeel. Taste is the  picture of balance. Sweet malts up front are quickly sliced into by a crisp hop bitterness. Notes of fruit and a slight paper taste. Finish is pretty short and dry. Another high quality beer from the state of Maine.","doerickson","Sep 19, 2002"
3.88,9.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Notes: Indeed a ""real ale."" I thoroughly enjoyed this brew and its completeness. An ideal session ale. 5.2% abv.","Todd","Jul 24, 2001"
