4.56,22.6,3.75,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,"On tap at the Troegs Brewery, bit too dark for a brown ale, but still a nice brown, and not amber, color, wonderful silky white foam, very tasty, and with pleasing lacing to the bottom of the pint. The flavor profile was robust, a good smooth blend of grain flavors, with a nice hop kick. The word was that the batch had been more highly hopped than in the past for Rugged Trail. It was posted as 5.2% ABV and 50 IBU. This is a very drinkable and satisfying brown. It's too bad brown ales aren't the American Beer du Jour these days.","ravenwork","Feb 11, 2015"

3.84,3.2,4,3.75,3.75,4,4,"Back on tap at the brewery after a couple of years on hiatus. Pours a deep clear ruby with a foamy off-white head. Nice retention that leaves a rich smattering of lacing down the sides. The aroma smells of floral and green citrus notes with a light sprinkling of toasted nuts and cocoa along the back. The taste switches things up, being more sweet and nutty (and just a smidgen of dark fruit) up front before giving away to bitter tingle of earthy citrus flavors. Dry and bitter on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium with a firm creaminess to the carbonation that flows nicely in the mouth. It's good to have the Rugged Trail back, as it is a nice and slightly Americanized take on an English Brown Ale. I'd hoping this is the first of many return appearances for this beer.","Kegatron","Apr 26, 2013"

3.45,-7.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"A copper color with a larger one finger head to it. It has a smell that contains roasted nuts, malts, carmel, faint hops.

3,-19.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Yeah, it's a brown ale...not really my style at all. Pours a murky walnut brown with a small layer of white bubbles for a head. Nutty, sweet aroma, a bit buttery. Toasted malts in the taste, nutty again, sweet, diacetyl, and a bitter finish. Not entirely bad, but just too sweet for me perhaps. Medium body, and not something I'd want to drink again, aka most brown ales.","Rifugium","Mar 25, 2011"
2.4,-35.5,3,3,2,2,2.5,"Had this back on 3-22-09. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. This beer was a nice brown color with a tan colored head. So far so good. The aromas weren't bad it was semi sweet with some bitterness on the nose too. The Flavor just wasn't all there for me. Not sure why, it just didn't seem right. Kind of a little disappointing.","Knapp85","Feb 17, 2011"
4.2,12.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D - Very drinkable. Lots of nutty flavors that blend really nicely with the rest of the flavors. The beer is fairly sweet, but not too sweet. Nicely balanced.","ngeunit1","Feb 10, 2011"
4.32,16.1,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Served in a Pint Glass. Rugged Trail pours a deep brown color that is bordering on black. The head of this brew is about a half-inch thick, foamy, and disappears quickly leaving a small amount of lingering lacing on top of the beer. As the beer is drank, however, it leaves absolutely no lacing on the glass which is quite typical for the style. This nut brown ale has the exact scent I had anticipated for the style with nice scents of roasted nuts and a slight underlying caramel or molasses note. The taste of the beer is absolutely spectacular. The nut flavor is perfectly balanced with the slight sweetness and the roasted character giving an incredible depth to the brew that I have not seen in many other nut brown ales. The only other Nut Brown I have had that could match up with this brew is Samuel Smith's Nut Brown ale which I thought was also astoundingly flavorful. Contrary to what I had expected given its depth of flavor and distinct character, Rugged Trail drinks impeccably smooth and light. Overall, I absolutely loved this brew and I must say I'm quite disappointed to find that it is retired.","BigPlay1824","Dec 04, 2010"

3.97,6.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Pours a nice, clear, dark-tea brown. A tan head soon becomes a patchy ring. Smells good, of brown sugar, caramel malts, and a hint of nuttiness, like a good piece of brittle. I detect more of the chocolatey richness and bitterness from the first sip. May be just a bit thin, but the taste is filling and good. Nice dry but smooth finish. Easy drinkability.

Aromas are chocolate maltiness dominating, but not explosive by any means. Acidity discernible in the aromas as well. Flavors are definitely chocolate. A nice tang that balances out, but the emphasis here is definitely on the chocolate biscuit malt, just what I'd expect from an English brown. Mouthfeel is high carbonation, seemingly making whatever acidity is there pop out. Lighter body, all in all a really easy drinking beer.","washburnkid","Jul 02, 2010"

3.45,-7.3,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. There is no freshness date on the bottle, but I've had it for a number of months, so it may be past its prime. The beer is a very dark brown; not as dark as dark chocolate, but close to that. There was a modest head of tan bubbles that quickly settled to something that's less than a skim of foam, just a few small bubbles and a little foam lacing, but I can see bare spots as well. Swirling the beer around gives a minimal amount of lacing. There's a little sweet malt in the nose; maybe some raisin; and some warm, toasted grain. All of the aromas are very slight though. The beer has some sweet malt flavor up from to compliment the aroma. This gives way to a nutty, biting flavor. At first I thought it was an off taste; but after taking a few more sips, I like it. The flavor is a bit watery for my tastes, and I'm the first to say that I'm not a big fan of brown ales, but I like this one. This beer has a light body, but it is also complex. The watery flavor makes it feel light at first, but the robust, nuttiness in the finish gives the beer some punch as you swallow. Very little mouthcoating, just a hint of sweetness can be found if you go looking for it. This beer drinks very easy. I can't think of any real objections, other than it's not a challenging beer. The Rugged Trail will never command your full attention, but would be great to drink whilst engaged in other activities.","ToasterChef","Jan 27, 2010"

Medium-bodied, the carbonation rises above the level of prodding forward, instead kind of disperses the flavors. Malt, milk chocolate, creamed coffee and then brazil nut, walnut flavors. Has a mineral water type of freshness that more or less cancels out the underlying roasted notes. The lemon and orange citrus has a tenuous presence, but there.

Taste starts out all right- just the beginning tastes like a really nice brown ale or porter with all the nice roastyness involved, but it soon diminishes to just plain wateryness. I was excited to see Troegs initially when it first started getting distributed here but all their beers seems like watery beer soda (save the time I had Hopback on tap, which I thought was great). This was the last bottle I bought from them and while I don't find them all out bad, I do not think they're particularly good.

The malt flavor becomes more restrained through the drink. Medium in body, and a little rough in mouthfeel. The carbonation is moderate. Decent bitterness that lasts long into the aftertaste.

The flavour was weighted towards malt with a mild caramel and chocolate base, toasty and nutty, plus a delicate roast character that added complexity in the background. Bitterness was restrained yet balanced the malt and spicy hops became a player in the finish, along with lingering bitter cocoa. Medium/light bodied with average carbonation, decent texture overall, but seems just a little thin. This actually helps make it very drinkable and highly sessionable.

Beyond that the nice earthy and woody stuff. Minor caramel mixed with almost a wood/bark flavor. Amazing levels of flavor here, but you really have to be ready to seek them out.

Also some light smokyness and some toasted nut notes. Finished with the just a faint earthy bitterness. Only complaint is that at first it seamed a little thin in the mouthfeel but the complexity of flavors takes over and I loose the sense that it is thin.

Watery mouthfeel and almost a watery taste and aftertaste. Reminded me a little of Guiness without being creamy. Hardly any bubbling going on in the mouthfeel.

Taste was rather odd when cold, but as it warmed a bit of nuttiness and a bit of a dry somewhat muted hoppiness came through. The consistency was very odd, had a slick, oily feel to it that was rather off, and could also feel a bit syrupy at times.

Tasted a little bit on the bland side which is nto what I was expecting from an English Brown Ale; I was hoping for a little sweetness or a nutty taste to it but neither appeared. The mouthfeel was pretty good, it went down rather smooth. Overall drinkability, I would have to go with not too impressed.

Again, hops played hookie this day. Too spritzy and overcarbonated for its style, a little too burpy. Just a bit of earthy dryness, but almost not noteworthy. I'm guessing this beer was simply geared towards being a sweeter, less attenuated beer, not out of the realms of its style.

Smells sweet with chocolate and a hint of nut. Tastes caramel, chocolate, mild nutty, and a hint of sour (roast grains?). Bitter from the hops competes with fine carbonation on my tongue (a bit of acidic forms). Later tastes reveal chocolate and some roast character that comes across as toffee-like. A bit more burnt grain than I like in my brown ales. The ending is dry, and is where the roast character makes itself most noticable. Medium bodied with a creamy quality usually found in oatmeal stouts. Moderately carbonated, but the carbonation that's present forms sharp fine bubbles on my tongue. The head quickly settled to a tiny ring around the glass and a minimum of lacing is present. A nice beer, a bit too roasty for me.

Balanced very well and feels great in the mouth. As with all Troegs, quite drinkable. This is my favorite of all troeg's offerings I've tasted. Unbelievably nutty and chocolatey.

No head to speak of, just a tiny ring of foam around edge, and a thin film of foam at the center of the beer. No carbonation, no lace. Aroma starts out with dark, rich maltiness that lasts its way through the entire nose. Faint smell of hops emerges after agitation; otherwise almost entirely a sweet, dark malt scent with hints of toffee and perhaps coffee. (A scent of hop freshness starts to emerge as the beer warms.) Taste is thankfully not as sweet as some other brown ales. Coffee is much stronger as a flavor than a scent, as are dark, roasted nuts. Prominent flavor of toasted almond skins up front gradually gives way to a slightly creamy, mellower maltiness in the back of the palate that becomes more apparent as tasting progresses... Mouthfeel a bit thin; slightly syrupy around edge of palate with a nice near-creaminess in midpalate accompanying warming malt.

It was served in a strange glass, similar to a hurricane--not what I was expecting for a brown ale, but I attribute this to the fact that I had it at an upscale tavern that was pretentious and geared towards fine dining. The beer is a mahogany brown that almost looks red (not amber) in the light. There is a faint head that quickly subsides. The smells are nutty and burnt. The beer is incredibly smooth and mild, in the fashion of most brown ales. The beer also had a certain sweetness to it, while still offering tastes of burnt nut, almond, faint choco, and malt. The beer was suprsingly thin considering its character, and it had a very watery feel across my palette. This is not to say it was watered down, but it does have a very subdued feel with just enough flavor to keep the mouth interested. A very good brown ale, though I can't really say how it stacks up against the classic English Nut Browns, as my experience is limited. I'd have it again, especially in the late summer and early autumn as it would pair well with many seasonal nuances in foods and atmosphere.","99bottles","Jul 22, 2003"

The hops are quite subdued and the malts are warm and mellow. The carbonation is very thin and that makes for quite a session beer.

Relatively complex palate for a Brown ale chocolate malts, spicy (but subdued) hops, nutty, distant caramel tasty!

3.98,7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This beer came to me a crystal clear mahogany/nut color that had an orange hue to it, and was well carbonated. It created a light tan/beige colored head that was fairly thick, dense and creamy. The foam left behind a faint lace behind that was spotty in areas. The aromas were fairly simple and light: roasted nuts and malt, flowers, and a light cocoa powder. Flavors had more of a dimension to it: roasted malts, light floral hops, nuts, fruit, some sweet malt (as it warmed and detected in the mid of the sip), cocoa powder and burnt chocolate at the end. It left a roasted chocolate nut flavor behind on the tongue. Light to medium bodied. This beer became nuttier and creamier as it warmed.

The flavor, however, is much softer with a mildly sweet chocolate and caramel malt that's only fringed with roastiness and very mildly infused with hop character. Similar in many ways to a German-style dunkle. Bitterness is kept to a minimum to accentuate the malt, but still balances. A soft note of cocoa lingers on the palate in a short and dry finish.

I expected a well-developed nutty scent from this ale, but only a small hint of burnt nuts and malt filled my nostrils. I was a little disappointed, but the smell was still subtely pleasant. The burnt, nutty aspect was also present in the taste. While malts and hops worked intricately before swallowing, the nut character really becomes apparent immediately afterwards. The medium body makes for a nice mouthfeel, too. The Nut Brown drinks very easily, like a lighter ale, but encompasses all of the characteristics of a good nut brown.
