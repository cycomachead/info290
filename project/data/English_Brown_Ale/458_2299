Deep aromas of brown sugar, dark fruit, and sweet malt. Taste was underwhelming, some roasty, sweet depth but not much. Small amounts of bitterness and no alcohol bite which was good. Feel was creamy, but with medium high carbonation which was off-putting. Overall a fair brown ale, it met the standard of brown ales well, just left a little to be desired in richness and depth.","Cuttlephish","Jan 28, 2015"

Aroma dark malt, toast, chocolate, toffee & faint roasted nuts. Taste is fronted by toasted brown bread, a hint of cocoa, roasted nuts, caramel & dark fruity notes at mid-sip & finishing with a note of toffee & bitterness. Aftertaste is burnt malt bitter cocoa & cola caramel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, smooth & creamy with a nice prickly bite.","mothmanscott","Dec 03, 2014"

The beer is not completely opaque because some ruby brown color is visible along the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates, leaving no lacing along the side of the glass. The aroma is of dark roasted barley malt with some nuttiness and chocolate. The taste follows the nose very well. There are rich flavors from the dark roasted malts that carry some mild sweetness with the roasty character really coming through in the back. There are flavors of chocolate in the front and that nutty character I picked up in the nose coats the tongue really well. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. There is a dry finish to this beer. It is smooth and highly drinkable. This is a very good beer. It is a satisfying brown ale.","acevenom","Jul 08, 2012"

It has a slight astringency in the nose as well, which unfortunately does appear in the flavor as well. Has a hearty brown ale malt taste to it with a cloying sweetness. There is slight oxidation and astringency and sort of an off chemical flavor to it as well. The chemical taste really stays throughout the finish and into the aftertaste.

A light, peppery caramel and dark fruit sweetness starts things off, giving way to a thin-bodied finish of earthen hops and brown sugar. Mouthfeel has a hard time making up its mind, switching from refreshingly juicy and bubbly at first, to dry and thin on the finish.

A thin layer of rolling lacing clings to the nonic. A whiff reveals toasty notes of dark chocolate, malts, and a bit of tea. On the palate there's a slight toast to the malts. Also apparent are some notes of caramel, black licorice, maybe some pine and spice as well as some nuts.

3.62,1.7,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Picked this up as part of an assorted 6-pack during a recent visit to Austin. I guess the alcohol is higher than a mild, but this one is mild in other respects. Aroma and flavor consists of a smooth chocolate that is not overly roasty or sweet. Outside of the choclate, it is clean. No fruitiness. There is no hop aroma or flavor, but just enough bitter to give it balance. This is a good brown. I had it as part of a fairly traditional Thanksgiving meal/dessert. Paired up nicely.","pweis909","Oct 20, 2006"

4.38,23,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The best thing about this brew is that it's very flavourful, but at the same time highly drinkable. Believe it or not, you could even drink this if you were thirsty, as it's defenitely not a heavy beer. In my opinion, this is how a brown ale should taste, and it's a must try for anybody who likes this style.","AustinBeerLvr","Jun 27, 2006"
4.2,18,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2" tan head over the almost clear brown (with burgundy highlights) brew. Head lasts nicely, with prevalent sticky lacing. Aroma is chocolately sweetness. Taste is not short-changed by the nose, the same rich chocolate flavors flourish immediately, and carry on after swallowing. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Not always impressed by browns, but this one is very nice. Worth noting that the bottle label states this is an "American Brown", but probably only by location. Hops, or comparative lack thereof, makes this perfect for the "English Brown" style.","ppoitras","Apr 23, 2006"

3.26,-8.4,3.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clear, brown in hue with a shinny ruby highlight. It is a lovely color. The head was light beige and very bubbly, like a cola. At the apex the foam was two fingers in height and then it faded fairly quickly to a fizzy cap. This cap lasted forever. However, there was no subsequent lacing. Overall, the appearance is solid, I mean, it is just a Brown Ale! What do you expect? Beer porn? The nose is fruity and slightly acidic from the roasted malts, I assume. Largely clean with some modest earthy, nutty notes. I also detect a kiss of herbalness. The nose has poor potency and it fails to be articulate. What a shame. Dammit! Speak up and say something. The palate is very nice; unlike the nose the taste is clearly Brown Ale in nature. I love the style and this one has all the proper flavors. Fruity with sharp acidity from a healthy roast; the malt is like a small porter. Slightly nutty. Clean. It could use a little yeasty residue. The hops offer slight bitterness and some earthiness. The palate is tasty and it is put-together nicely. Long aftertaste. It would be a good beer with a steak or stew. Medium in body with firm carbonation helps produce a sturdy mouthfeel. This beer is drinkable; Id sit back and quaff a six-pack anytime, anyplace. It is a good session beer, plenty simple. I realize this beer isnt earth shattering but I like the style and this beer is decent. Thanks Bdc for the bottle. Worth a try this is yet another solid beer from Real Ale.","bditty187","Dec 09, 2004"

3.49,-2,3,4,3.5,3.5,3,"Drinkability: Very drinkable, except that after one or two, i think I would start craving something more interesting. Like beer from many small regional breweries, this is a fine, well crafted beer. It just isn't that exciting, groundbreaking, or extraordinary. But a boring craft brew beats the pants off of just about any American Macro.","poundboy","Jul 27, 2004"

3.9,9.6,4,4,4,3,4,"A dark, dark brown beer shows reddish highlights. It's mostly clear and sports a big, 3-finger head: pale beige, café-au-lait, dense, thick. Roasted chocolate nuttiness in the nose. Dark cocoa up front turns thinnish through the top. Some nice chocolate malt goes tangy for the roasty, nutty, bitter chocolate, toffee finish. It's just a nice, tasty, roasty, chocolatey brown.","kbub6f","Jun 15, 2004"
3.53,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This is a pretty good brew, maybe not complex enough to be a great beer. Brewhouse Brown pours a nice dark color with dark ruby highlights. The aroma is slightly sweet, but not too strong. The starts moderately sweet and ends with some hops bite. This is a beer I could drink again, but too many in a row would be a little too filling. I enjoyed this beer and can't wait to see what the other Real Ale Company offerings taste like.","Gagnonsux","Mar 16, 2004"
3.8,6.7,4,4,4,3,3.5,"The letdown here was the mouthfeel. The beer felt way too thin on the palette, with an empty feeling that grew with each sip. This was a real downer, as the taste had the beginnings of a good beer. In the end, the watery mouthfeel became the most dominant character. As a result of the light mouthfeel, the alcohol was up front, and not well hidden. I wish that they had worked on the recopied a bit more to get some more malts in the bottle.","rajendra82","Mar 04, 2004"
3.75,5.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a dark brownish mahogany color with a short light tan head that soon fades into a tight lace. Nose is chocolaty roasted malts and fresh mocha. Moderate in body with a fine carbonation that gives the beer a bit of a crisp mouthfeel. Taste picks up right where the aroma left off with the same chocolaty malts as well as a bit of burnt caramel and dark fruit. Some unusual, though not unpleasant, earthy mineral notes follow along with some mildly bitter hops leaving a dry finish. A pretty nice brown ale that needs to make its way up to north Texas. Thanks to Bentley for the sample!","Morris729","Oct 23, 2003"
3.88,9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Good mouthfeel. The initial sample seemed to be a bit watery, but this sample is holding up better. Good, smooth finish. Very drinkable.

3.61,1.4,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Its hazy mahogany body is topped by a light tan head of foam that holds quite well and leaves some jagged and craggy rings of lace at the outset. The nose is yeasty and fruity above a mildly caramelish and nutty malt. The body is medium/light and its very fine, natural carbonation is lightly zesty in the mouth. Chocolate and caramel mingle well together in the flavor along with a slight fruitiness, a light yeast bite, and some leafy hops. It's well balanced by a low-key bitterness and it finishes short and dry with just some residual nutty malt. This is probably quite excellent in cask conditioned form, but it seems to fall a bit short in the bottle.","NeroFiddled","Jun 15, 2003"
3.43,-3.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"Re-Revisited: I'm liking the beer more and more each time I try it. The mouthfeel has a fairly creamy profile, and the taste has some nuttiness that I didn't get before. I'm not sure if they are playing with the recipe or I'm just starting to pick up on subtle notes.","HardTarget","Mar 23, 2003"
