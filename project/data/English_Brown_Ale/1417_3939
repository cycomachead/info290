3.71,-3.6,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"A solid, nicely-balanced example of a strong ale. In fact, Riggwelter forms my mental template of the style. Looks alright, while the aroma and flavour have a rich malt presence accompanied by a considerable hop bitterness. Subtle roasty and fruity notes mingle on the palate. Mouthfeel is OK but could be slightly more substantial. Well-crafted and traditional; shame it's filtered as I imagine live yeast would add an extra dimension to the character. Doubtless a cracker on cask. Worth sampling if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Mar 06, 2014"

It has depth in the feel, too, with dryness underneath a sweeter overtone and a certain richness to it. Crispness is light but firm and consistent from first hitting the tongue to the back of the throat in every sip, while it goes creamy smooth for the duration.","Brenden","Jan 03, 2014"

Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, oatmeal cookie dough, and a spiced rum alcohol aroma. Taste is much the same with a toasted bread flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is fairly tasty but I think this one has a slightly better smell going on.","UCLABrewN84","Feb 01, 2013"

3.91,1.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Another score for Black Sheep. Deep brown, excellent volume to the head - you'll have to wait it out to pour the whole thing. The smell is more evident at room temperature - roasted coffee, as others have noted, and sweet carob. Good earthy flavor with more than a touch of umami and a whole lot of English yeastiness and malt. I guess coffee and malt are the predominant characteristics. It is a little astringent, but I wouldn't say bitter in the least. Robust is a great word to describe this beer. The roasted malt stays with you long after the last sip. Certainly an English brown with character.","angusdegraosta","Jan 31, 2012"

A hearty aroma of dry, roasted, bready malts as well as a touch of caramel and dark chocolate along with a leafy, grainy hop presence. The roasted malts and bitter hops give this beer a dry, roughish edge, even slight coffee notes hit my tongue. Medium to full body, a heavier brown ale that places the emphasis on dry malts and bitter hops as that's the predominant taste and it finshes with a sry, crisp bite. Some caramel and dark chocolate in there for sweetness but they're overpowered. The carbonation and dryness made a few sips rather unpleasant or else would've given this beer higher rating.","clayrock81","Dec 10, 2011"

Caramel & dark malts, scotch, peat, alcohol, hardwood, this is one of the best smelling beers I've yet had. Taste has a sharp , almost acrid bitterness that lessens as you progress through the beer. This is what many will notice first off, but after a while you realize it's balanced with a lot of sweetness - again caramel and toffee, some vanilla. This is a wildly complex beer.

Bit of dark amber and ruby show through when held to the light. Big, firm head peaks up and settles down to about 2 1/2 fingers. Strong malt smell, with some sweet brown sugar, black berries, and floral hops. Strong malt flavour, with some dark berries, floral hops and a hint of smooth butter to even out the strong flavour. The mouithfeel! Oh wow. If this had no flavour, I would drink it for the mouthfeel alone. Pleasantly coarse, raw and granular. Something I've never yet experienced in a beer.

Nutty and wet fruit (green apples, bruised plums, sour cherries) aromas with a subtle malt character. The sour fruit character continues in the taste with a strong herbal and earthy hop flavor. There is a slightly bitter mineral finish. As it warms, the beer develops more of a pronounced nut flavor, with an emphasis on the dryness of black walnuts and hazelnut skin. This is detectable primarily in the aftertaste. Medium body, with a tannic, dry mouthfeel -- rather crisp for a brown ale.

It's a medium-light tan, and a bit rocky. The ale is a dark copper gold, and quite transparant. Leaves some very nice, sudsy lacing. The nose is of a sugary, shortbread character, with some peppery notes, possibly from the hops. Lemons come through as it warms. The taste is incredibly pronounced, very dry at first - a great shock to the palate. I'm intrigued. Notes of cocoa and espresso waft around this light bodied ale. I swear I detect wheat toast, as well. The dry bitterness hits the most when the beer leaves your mouth for the throat. Carbonation is very low, affording an incredibly smooth body.

The flavors starts with sweet caramel malts and strong butterscotch, slowly developing toasty and yeasty qualities, and finishing with good hop dryness and lingering woody, smoky, and almost port-like notes.

This beer for me was too middle of the road. I was looking for something sweet and or tart and would have been happy with something sharp and bitter.

4.15,7.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"The bottle has a great label, detailing the word "riggwelter," which is really rather comical. This Yorkshire ale looks heaven-sent sitting in the glass: thick, almost unmoveable cream-with-brown patches head; creamy, puffy, and everything a head should be on a good strong ale. As solid and smooth looking as thick caramel icing on a cake. Deep hues of coppery red, amber/maple syrup, rust, with the solid look of a glittering precious stone. I cannot imagine many other beers that fit the word "ale" in appearance so exceptionally. The aroma at first smote me with spicy nuttiness, creamy coffee, bitter baker's chocolate, raisins and dates and even cinammon. Behind the frontal aroma there is a noticeable aged leather smell, or meat, with chemical-like pungency. Also some saltiness, and a sweeter pepper, perhaps cayenne. The aroma is similar to some good British stouts, but not as a strongly burnt or chocolate/coffee-filled, which pleases me personally. This manages to combine a hearty, robust and spicy stout aroma with the milder, more fruity sweet brown ales. Throughout two or more glasses of Riggwelter, you will never bore of the aroma, that is certain. The taste is nicely grainy at first, with some caramel and/or crystal malt giving some sweetness, but quickly the darker malt and strong hop bitterness assert themselves, leaving a pleasantly dry palate. Very well balanced, with the malt only subtlely more powerful. Syrup, oats, molasses, some alcohol, raisins, rich coffee--but all these less bold than in a stout, and it constitutes this beer far more drinkable. Leather tastes, salt, and a hop character felt more by its dryness than its taste. Smoked and meaty sometimes. Mouthfeel is full, though not so heavy, with low carbonation, leaving little gaseous feel. Though strong and filling, it passes through the mouth quite easily: nicely drinkable on a colder autumn or winter night.","Cwrw","Aug 10, 2004"

The body is a little thin for what looks like a meaty brew.","marburg","Jul 15, 2003"
2.98,-22.6,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,"It poured a nice reddish copper in color and with very little to no foam or lace. The smell and taste was just like a Scotish Ale and I'm not overly impressed with Scotish Ale. So the taste was below average. I thought I could taste a sort of vinyl flavor to this brew. I'll pass on this style of beer!","BeerManDan","Jun 15, 2003"
3.65,-5.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer pours with an off white head that leaves a good lace. Dark ruby red color. Starts and finishes with a mix of malts and hops. The porter style is here but it is a mild version. Don't let the wierd label with a helpless black sheep throw you - its a good ale. 500ml is $4.29.","jdhilt","Apr 24, 2003"

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"Taste is good, malt feels dominant, flavor is full, rich, delicious. Good texture and body, wholly satisfactory. I liked this beer, in a generous 16.9oz. serving, all the way down. One of the best brown ales,( or is it "porter, robust/baltic"?) I've had in a while, and a delightful surprise. Horray for uglyradio, who sent it out to me.","feloniousmonk","Mar 06, 2003"
4.38,13.8,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Ed's Note: I was really surprised this one fit into the Robust Porter Category. It lacked any chocolate flavors that I usually associate with Porters. Also it was lighter bodied, and more in line with a dark ale, or maybe a scotch ale. Tasted like a barleywine or scotch ale, but lacked the warming abv. Very interesting, unique, flavorful beer and worth a try.","StevieW","Mar 03, 2003"
4.37,13.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Rich ruby-brown/mahogany color. Creamy head. Toasted grain, bordering on dark roasted malt, fruity (concord grapes) aroma. The aromas are further defined with the first sip. The flavors consist of a blend of caramel, toffee, chocolate, coffee and dark ripe fruits. Alcohol is underlying, providing a subtle warming. Hops provide a leafy character and a dry snap. Mouthfeel is medium-full with moderate carbonation. I'm particularly fond of these type of English ales...brilliant. I'd stop short of catagorizing this as a robust porter, but no points off here, this is a fine brew.","John","Feb 10, 2003"
4.06,5.5,5,4,4,4,4,"Wow what a quality made yorkshire ale,nice chesnut hue witha a good rocky head.Good medium body with a nice almost rich malty flavor,good sour tinge to finish it off.First Black Sheep ale I have had the pleasure to try looking forward to many more.I will be sure to get this again.","oberon","Feb 02, 2003"
4.53,17.7,4.5,4,5,4,4.5,"500 mL bottle. Impressively thick and rocky head in a light beige (more annoying than impressive as I poured hard expecting a thin head, but it would have been great from a normal pour). Dark, slightly murky brown, with garnet tinges. An expressive aroma, some malts and fruit. The flavour is something, though. Early currants and blackberries, moving to heavier fruits like dark plums (like a plum pudding), following through with a slightly sour finish. GWAR has a good word for this: Sexcellent! Absolutely Fabulous (wait, why did I reference that, I never liked that show...)","the42ndtourist","Jan 15, 2003"
3.53,-8.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The beer poured a very dark choclate looking color with a average head. Had a sort of burnt coffee aroma to it. The taste was hard for me to put a finger on but I would say roasted malt with a hint of coffee. Even though not very high in alcohol I could taste it. This beer went down very well but not as good as others from this brewery that I have tried.............CHEERS","tigerpaws","Nov 20, 2002"
4.15,7.8,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Ruby red body topped by a huge frothy, rocky, sticky beige head. Awesome lacing. This does not look like a porter. Of course, the bottle doesn't say it's a porter. But it is classified on this site as a porter. The beer certainly smells like a porter. Nose is coffee and liquorice. Taste adds butter notes, and dash of hops to the coffee and candy. Creamy mouthfeel. Hell of beer, whatever style it is.","RonfromJersey","Oct 23, 2002"
4.08,6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"A fine dark ale to say the least, complex without taking away from drinkability. Went well with apple wood smoked turkey breast.","Jason","Jul 31, 2002"
3.92,1.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Slightly hazy, dark reddish-amber body.  Thick cream colored head that kind of gave the appearance of a float.  Rich roasted barley aroma with a hint of smoke.  Subdued earthy hops smell also detectable.  Nice malty flavor with perhaps a bit of a chocolate taste.  Earthy hop taste also present, adding balance to the brew.  Overall, a pretty solid English ale.  Definitely something to try if available, but not necessarily to seek out.","Viking","Jul 29, 2002"
3.68,-4.4,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Pretty nice stuff, a lot more character and a little more elegant than their other brews, nice roastiness and maltiness, medium bodied, light hop bitter finish, not mind blowing, but  certainly nice.","rastaman","Jul 24, 2002"
3.51,-8.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Regardless ... a really decent brew from the UK, not exceptional, just classic of the style with all of the traditional flavours. Good drinkin' here.","Todd","Jul 21, 2002"
4.45,15.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Nose of coffee, with nice long lasting head. steady carbonation, even long after being poured.  Served cool, this beer is rigged and mighty tasty.  Malty, roasty with a complex hop finish.","stoutman","Jun 01, 2002"
4.68,21.6,5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"Label claims this beer's name is derived from lazy English sheep or something. Pours a deep mahogany with a creamy bone white head that leaves a sticky lace. Really nice looking brew! Nose of coffee, raisin and fruit. Malty, roasty and complex finishes tasty English hop and lip smacking good. Awesome beer! Highly recommended.","inebrius","May 30, 2002"
