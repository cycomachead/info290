"Pours a clear super dark crimson-brown with a foamy tan head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, roasted nut, and slight char aromas. Taste is much the same with char and roasted nut flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with a nice aroma, but the flavors are a bit bland and watery in my opinion."

"Pours a dark reddish-brown in color with a very thin off-white head. Spotty lacing is seen with each sip that clings to the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts for the most part. The taste is the same with the malts up front with a slight nutty (hazelnut & almond) finish. Very slight dry finish as well. Overall, it was OK."

"Wow, blown away by this beer! Ska really hit this one out of the park on all counts; looks, tastes, style-wise. Very tasty brew here."

"A pretty tasty malt-forward beer, not too sweet yet packed with excellent caramel and nut flavors."
""
""
""
"Not bad, a brown ale that slides down nicely. Despite being a tad old it seems alright. The aroma and flavour are dominated by sweet chocolate and caramel notes, which make for easy drinking. Somewhat undercarbonated, but otherwise OK. Worth sampling if you come across it."

"Served on tap in a Duvel glass. Appearance is dark brown with no light passage. A cm of tan head and thick lacing. Nose features mellow roast and caramel malt, no hops to speak of. The taste is mild with a watered down roasted malt profile and a slightly nutty character at the end. Mouthfeel is light and moderately carbonated. Overall, this is a pretty run of the mill brown."

"Roasted almonds don't pair as well as one would expect. But dark chocolate does. So do peanut butter and bananas."
""
""

"well, the beer wasn't all that fascinating however, i'm glad i got to try it and i will be keeping the bottle. growing up listening to ska makes me appreciate every beer this brewery makes whether it be hit or miss (so far this is really the first miss)."
"WOW!... just read a few reviews, I may have gotten a bad beer, it looked good and was not skunked at all...I'll have to get another one and re-review."

"Overall, this beer has it's ups and downs, but it's alright. Too sticky and definitely not good on a hot summer night."

"O - A good, easy to drink nut brown. Slightly above average example of the style."
""
""
"O- Good but not great. obviously a steal for the price."

"Dark brown in color. The head is tan and retention is very little. Lacing is scattered unevenly around the glass. Lightly toasted malts take stage with a faint hop bitterness. The nose ends on a sweet almond like nutty note. Light roasted grains dominate the taste but are balanced out nicely by bitter hop characters and a sort of sourness in the middle. Once again the taste finishes nutty. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Smooth and with fine carbonation. A fairly average brown ale. Its got just enough complexity to keep you interested. If I could find this in singles in my area I could see purchasing a couple now and then. Although I would never drop the cash for a six pack. Worth a try."

"A solid English ale from Ska brewing, but a far cry from veterans of the style such as Samuel Smiths. The real problem is that the beer just didn't come off as rich, creamy, and complex as some other English browns, plus the art on the bottle kinda creeped me out. I might have this again on tap if I'm in the mood for a brown, but I don't see myself picking up a six of it anytime soon."

"nothing special here. pours a cocacola colored brown with a small off white head which fades away to nothing in a minute or two. smells honey sweet and medium roasty, caramel malts dominate. flavor is rather bland, on the sweet side but not much of that roasted character comes through from the smell. no hops to speak of. mouthfeel is fuller bodied and kind of filling, with a little less carbonation than maybe it could have. leaves a funny aftertaste too. overall definitely not one of skas better beers, ive come to expect more from them. still, a sessionable brown ale that would pass muster in a lot of other states, but it doesnt cut it here in colorado."
"Poured from a bottle into a chilled pint glass with a minimum amount of head, which dissipated rather quickly. Nice warm brown color, but a lighter brown. The smell of roasted nut with a hint of sweetness on the nose. Medium bodied feel in the mouth. Nice smooth malty flavor, with a bit of a lingering aftertaste. Very nice brown ale in my opinion. Been looking for a nice solid brown to be a 'mainstay' in the bar. This is a keeper."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass, best by 1/27/12 (a couple of weeks past date). This pours a nice amber color with a decent sized foamy white head. The smells are of brown sugar, a little nuttiness, other malts. The feel is medium. Taste is brown sugar, nuttiness, some roasted malts. Not bad."
"Pours brown with very little head. Sweet swell to this thing but nothing distinct in the aroma. Taste is pretty flat and I get very little distinguishable flavors from it. Maybe a blend of brown sugar and malt. I think I might have to buy another single of this in the future to ensure I simply didn't get a bad bottle of this. Mouthfeel is syrupy and very little carbonation. Very disappointed in this beer so far. I will have to give it a second chance though, reading a lot of these comments suggest something wasn't right for me here Maybe a wrong time, wrong place situation, maybe an old bottle that sat on the rack for too long, who know..."

"#4 on Christmas is the Buster Nut Brown from SKA. The colors is a nice brownish clear amber with thin slightly off-white head that is lacing!!! The scent includes malt, maple sugar, and some nuttyness. The taste includes a good push of sweet molasis type malt with hints of peanut butter. The mouthfeel is ok, lighter in body good carbonation. Overall it is a decent beer....I think I would prefer a little more body."

"Overall this was a solid English Brown Ale - slightly more hops than in some of the others I've had, but it's just a hint and melts away into the big caramel and malt finish. Definitely tasty and worth a try."
""
""
"I am glad to have tried this brew. This is a tasty enough beer. Buster Nut is far from being a world class brown ale. It's just a bit light all the way around. That said, there's no major missteps here. Props to Ska for making a nice easy drinking quaff."
"Nuts galore and even goes so far as to remind me of a hazelnut liqueur, not quite Frangelico in its richness and sweetness though. Toffee and coffee are secondary flavors, but still there nonetheless. Hops are very low and its hard to distinguish any yeast character. The body is fine and leans a bit toward the sweet end of the spectrum. Its quite baffling, Ive had at least twelve of these over the past couple years and the components all add up to something I would really like...but for some reason it just doesnt all come together perfectly for me."
"This was my fourth bottle of a six-pack. I started to review the first, but held judgment until I was sure. Sadly, all four bottles had the same results. I won't share this with my friends, and I'm too tight to pour the last two down the drain. The beer looks good, but seems to have been rushed out the door."
"M- nothing stood out abt the mouthfeel"
"The beer pours a brown color with a small tan head. The aroma is full of toffee and caramel with a little bit of nuttyness mixed in. Straight forward but enjoyable. The flavor is more of the same. There is a little bit of brown sugar to go along with the hazelnut, toffee and caramel notes. There is a little bit of grass from the hops but it is hidden well behind the malt. Medium mouthfeel and low carbonation."
"Picked up in a pick your own six pack, so only one to sample. Pours d dark brown with fair head and moderate carbonation. Taste is of roasted malt and it does have a distinct nut flavor. Overall a pretty good nut brown , not the best offering from Ska but a good not great beer."
"{Revised with bottle consumed in June 2013)."
"Overall: While it is true this brown ale is pretty straight forward, it does at least go for a more original interpretation of a brown ale. That roasted flavor could even be called endearing if it was done better. The malt profiles are just too small. You could do worse for browns, I'm sure. But ultimately, you could also do much, much better."
"M-Very good. Doesn't kill your palate and leaves you wanting more."
"Overall Impression- A light, refreshing mild brown that didn't have much characteristic after the nose... Liked it but SKA has much better brews than this. Would recommend for some people trying to get into new craft beers and need a lighter brown ale."
"Buster Nut pours a dark brown with hints of red and deep copper coming through. The head is fairly light in color and sticky. It slowly gives way to a few spots of lacing. The aroma is rich; full of caramel, toasted walnuts and hazelnuts, and hints of both bread and chocolate. On the first sip you know you'll be wanting more than one pint of this brew. This is definitely a nutty brown ale with tastes of both chocolate and coffee with hints of pumpernickel bread. Hints of hops come through on the flavor, but don't linger long enough to be distinguishable. This beer is very carbonated and that masks the flavor slightly, but thankfully the flavors continue to develop and grow stronger as you drink it. A nutty aroma lingers with you after each sip and leaves you wanting more."
"Heavier side of light, adequate carbonation. I found this very drinkable, pleasant with the low abv. A session English brown, not many around from US brewers. Worth a try."
"overall really very well done"
"Wetting to the palate, nice carbonation, and a spicy snap with a powdery finsh."
"Light brown color with ruby highlights. An inch of tan foam that left nice lacing and good retention. Very nice looking beer. The aromas were sweet grainy malts, and a slight nuttiness. The flavor is sweet at first, then the roasted malt and nut flavors come forward. Dry, clean finish, crispness keeps the sweetness from being too sugary. The body is medium, good carbonation and mouthfeel. Easy to drink, a good session brew."
"2.5 D: Certainly worse that average. They need to throw in some more malt and mash a lot higher. Too light and watery to appreciate."
"There isn't a strong smell, but light sweetness and malt is detectable. pours brown and has very little head and lacing. I taste brown sugar and there is a nice crispness. It is pretty sweet, there is some bitterness, but it finishes nicely. This is a well rounded brown ale with a medium body."
"Pours a very dark brown with a fast dimishing head and thin lacing. Scents of some robust malts and nutty hints. Drinks rather lightly for being a dark beer. Rather mild roasted malts taste with an awkward nutty finsh. The way you expect this beer to taste and the way it actually tastes are two different things. Not completly horrible but definetly needs some work on its taste and texture."
"D: Really easy drinking; this isn't always my favorite style but Ska does a decent enough job with it; I like the nutty flavor but it does become a tad wearing after a while"
"On-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a crisp brown with a thin diminishing khaki head that leaves decent lacing on the glass. Aroma is mild brown malts and cocoa. The taste is a smooth subtle blend of dark malts, cocoa, nuts and mild caramel. The beer is quite light, crisp and smooth with mild carbonation. This is a surprisingly enjoyable brown ale, one I would love to have on-tap again."
"Drinkability: I have to admit, this Brown is really drinkable as it's quite good; there are nice flavors that really live up to the name on the label; moderate ABV and a body that isn't too heavy, hell, I think I'd be able to get through 2 or 3 of these in a sitting if I had to."
"Medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. Could benefit from a bit more carbonation as the lack of carbonation imparts a bit of a watery feel."
"Pours a clear, brown color. 6/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight nut, slight wheat, slight grain, and slight hops. Fits the style of an English Brown Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight yeast, slight grain, slight nut, slight wheat, and a hint of hops. Overall, good appearance and complexity, but average aroma and body."
"Poured a leather couch brown w/ 2-finger head that quickly receeds and left no lace on top of a faint aroma of burnt sweet malts and sour hop bitterness. Taste and mouthfeel are light and quaint as there isn't much going into this; light, sweet caramel and chocolate malts w/ slight roasted edge and a hint of hops lead to dryness (and breadiness). An alright brown ale that was nice to have on a summer day."
"It pours a bit too light and clear for my standard of a brown. Toasted nuts and grains in the aroma. I'm having to reach to smell it. The body and flavor are a little richer than I expected after the lackluster aroma. As it warms up caramel malts and an undefined nuttiness bring forth a charming quality and a gentle hoppiness can be found in a dryish finish. Probably more of an intro brown in my book."
"D: Solid nut brown ale. Not the most common style in the craft brewers repertoire so it was nice to see. Another good ale from Ska."
"I would not buy this again. I don't care if I paid less than 2$ for this bottle, it is not worth it in the least. I would rather pay double the price for something far more enjoyable than try this beer. Hopefully, future brown ales can bring my spirits back up to what they used to be before I was dashed by the angry mod suited man and his army of crazed bottles."
"Final Words: Great choice for a lighter bodied full flavored brown ale."
"Drinkability - I have had better but this is a good beer none the less."
"Drinkability? Easy drinker, plain and simple and the head retention is good as is the lacing. A good beer overall."
"Pours from the bottle a nice light to medium brown, with a good light brown head. Aromas of nuts, sweet malt and milk chocolate. Nice creamy mouthfeel, with flavors of cocoa powder and brown sugar. A solid, sweet nut brown ale, nothing more, nothing less."
"D: A pretty decent beer overall. Low ABV makes it a good session beer. I'm glad I had the opportunity to have it."
"Served in a Dillon Dam shaker pint. Two finger light brown head. Medium carbonation. Clear light brown mahogany color. Smells of molasses, dried fruits and ethanol. Light body. A says the flavor is like a dark brewed iced tea (I disagree). Moderate caramel nuttiness. A little more bitter than expected. Slight nuttiness in the finish, moderately bittersweet aftertaste."
"D: Not a bad brown ale, but not a great brown ale, either. Too watery for my tastes."
"D: a decent offering from a company just now available in the midwest but would still prefer a modus hoperandi any day"
"D - This is an excellent, if not exactly outstanding, brown ale. I like the sweet caramel and maple syrup notes, and the hops and woody notes are enough to keep it from being overly saccharine."
"Thanks Ken."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable nut brown that I would have again. The nut is not too overpowering. A bit on the sweet side."
"D - This is an okay brown okay. It really didn't have the nutty flavors and aromas that I expect in an ""English"" brown ale."
"Pours a medium brown with a thin beige head. Nose has bready malts, nuts and molasses. Taste has toffee, molasses and bready malts. Light to medium body has average carbonation. Finish is a bit thin. Not a bad brown ale, just nothing special. Decent session beer."
"D - Nice light beer with some roasty notes. Very drinkable. Has some nice stuff going on, but is not too cluttered."
"Drinkability: Brown ale is a tough style to get excited about, but some brewers manage to add something to it to make it interesting; Sky, unfortunately, does not"
"Drinkability= High. No alcohol detected, smooth brown ale on the thin side, good flavor, good nose. Just not my style."
"Overall impression: There are some good flavors, but something overall doesn't work .. its not bad, but I won't be looking for it again."
"D - i wouldn't reach for a second one, if something else is available, but not painful to get through"
"Glad to see more of Ska's beers finding their way to my neck of the woods."
"I like this beer and could drink these often and regularly. If only I could buy this in Missouri..."
"The aroma is dusty and papery with hints of malt, toffee, and hops. The appearance is light brown with a huge head. The flavor is like the aroma with a touch of sourness. The palate is thin but OK. Overall this is a true buster. I wonder what they were going for this is not what a brown ale should be."
"D: Drinkable -- yes, but many other with more heft and flavor with equal drinkability are out there."
"This beer didn't do me much good. Keep the esters and faint alcohol out of the flavor, and don't forget to pep the carbonation level. Then we have a much more enjoyable beverage here."
"Overall this was a good beer, but one that I probably won't revisit again."
"this is not bad at all... sadly i had to drink five bad one's to get it! this would be a nice go to session brew in the consistency were upheld. 6/3/6/4/14/3.3"
"I will definitely be buying this again, and trying even more from Ska. Its near my hometown, so I am looking forward to going home for Christmas this year."
"Off the tap at Lady Falconburgh's in Durango, Colorado. Poured into the pint glass an ever so slightly hazy brown color with ruby highlights. Two fingers of tan head, good lacing and good retention. Great looking overall. The aromas were sweet malt, dry grains and a nuttiness. The flavors were sweet at first then the bready malt and nut flavors (chestnut?) kick in. Dry finish as the sweet malt fades out. The body is medium to light and perhaps just a bit watery but the carbonation is good and it lends itself to being quaffable. A good session brew."
"snifter. rich brown mahogany color with some ruby tones. good lacing and good retention. some nutty tones from the sweet malts, light hints of molasses. great flavors, sweet at first, but a dropoff in the end. mostly molasses and chestnuts. medium to low body. light to mild carbonation level. smooth and creamy. very well-balanced. this is a very drinkable brown ale."
"This is some decent brown! It goes down easy, just short of creamy, and is just so mellow that it seems like it would go with so many things. I can see this as a good session brew. If your into browns, check this one out. Pretty good."
"Superb drinkability and flavor place this beer among my favorites from Ska. The drink is crisp and refreshing."
"Very middle-of-the-road. Needs to be a bit more aggressive."
"I only wish I could visit the taproom to see how things went down there :D"
"Not a bad brown ale, and one that I can easily drink."
"buster nut brown ale, has a pretty cool label, reminds me of some punk rock albums from the mid 90's, think mighty mighty bosstones or reel big fish. looks great, a reddish brown color with a small weak head. smell is good, has a very strong chocolately malty aroma. taste is very coffee like, has a nice sugary malty flavor. no hop presence at all, mouthfeel is kinda watery, good beer all around."
"Comes across almost like chilled coco, an interesting and fun beer, should work great for breakfast."
"Great lloking beer, except for the insane overflw of head after a very light pour. But the crazy, light beige head does hld up well throughout all twelve ounces. Medium brown with ok lacing. The aroma is a little moldy. Very malty bready arom with just a hint of mold. ust a hint though, so it doesn't make wanna dump the bre. Especially if you've had a couple of lambics under your belt. The taste is a bit old tasting bread with lots of toast and medium roasted malts.The palate is smooth yet musty. It is still pretty easy to drink."
"Poured a cola brown with overwhelming carbonation that required multiple pours and patience to finally get 12 oz into a pint. Head was a dark tan with a meringue-like texture after a few pours into the glass. Aroma was biscuity with just a hint of dark malt, no hops to speak of. Flavor was a typical brown without the sweetness common to the style. This emphasized the hop bitterness and the dark malt, and was responsible for the lighter mouthfeel that other reviewers noted. This was a pleasant change for someone who prefers drier beers, so if you are a little put off by the sweetness in most browns, this beer may be the way for you to better enjoy this style. Very sessionable."
"Some more chewiness would have gone a long way to improve this beer for me. Not terrible but in the end, I was defintley expecting a little more."
"Overall, it's an easy to drink brown and isn't by any stretch a bad beer. Still, in a crowded pack this doesn't do much to differentiate itself."
"I have had this brew before in passing at a local bar and was not impressed. Found a sixer for 5.99 and figured what the hell. I like it better than I did before now that I'm less intoxicated, but overall I will not buy this one again when there are nice Hobgoblin ales to be had."
"Drinkability: easy to drink session ale. This will not blow you out of the water, but a worthy beer to try."
"Drinkability: I'll tell you what, it was surprisingly nice, at least on-tap."
"The beer is fairly drinkable, but again the carbonation gets in the way."
"Not a bad beer at all. Certainly drinkable. These Ska folks haven't really wowed me with anything, but their brews are certainly drinkable and session worthy."
"This has received sub-par reviews here, but I thought it was a solid beer, yet I prefer a Newcastle."
"This beer is a nice deep brown with a small head that quickly dissipated. The smell is slightly rancid. Deffinatly thw low point of this beer. The taste really ain't too bad. Caramel and just a bit of hops. The beer has no bad aftertaste. I could drink this beer again. Mid range for the style."
"Way to thin - one and done with this bad boy."
"Overall a pretty thin and boring nut brown."
"Overall an inoffensive, but average nut brown. Nothing unpleasant here. Nothing to get too excited about either. Worth a try."
"Drinkability: This beer is kind of unspectacular, but not unpleasant. If this beer is to live up to its awesome appearance (and awesome name), it needs to be much more robust in all departments, especially mouthfeel."
"The smell is alright. Fairly nutty with a bit of a malty sweetness and some subtle fruity esters. The taste is the same. Very watery. I suppose it would make a decent session ale, but I know of many more that I would love to drink in place of this."
"Ska Brewing Company's Buster Nut Brown Ale (I keep wanting to call it Nut Buster, a name that would be more appropriate if it was bigger and better) is an decent version, although I can't bring myself to recommend it. More malt is the obvious fix. As is, cast your brown ale lovin' eyes elsewhere."
" An excellent example of its style and a great introduction to the Ska Brewery. If only it didn't have such a horrible name...I'm far from a prude or anything--I just don't like to be reminded of semen while I'm trying to savor the flavor of something, is all."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a sweet, malty scent that boasts of crystal and roasted malts along with a nutty aroma. The taste is decent. It has a light, malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes a bit weak with some residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low/medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking beer, but just not the best nut brown. The aroma suggests lots of malt flavor, but the actual taste is a let down. Overall, a pretty good beer."
"D- I'm not a fan of Brown Ales because they are usually bland and shallow. This one has good grain qualities and complexity that give it lots of depth in the flavor. I would like to see a little hops or other grain in the finish but it was very nice to drink."
"Deep brown in color with a huge fluffy tan head. The head leaves a clumpy lace on the glass as it settles. The nose has some toffee, figs, hazelnuts, and a little nectarine. The flavor has milk chocolate, more hazelnuts, nectarine. Not much bitterness. The flavor is a little jumbled. The mouth feel is a little thin. Drinkability is only average in this beer."
"Overall average. There wasn't anything that makes want recommend or tell you not to try it. I would drink it again but i wouldn't go out of my way to buy it. I would suggest that you try it for your self"
"Pours a clear dark brown with some particles floating around , small foamy tan head that leaves some lacing in my glass, roasty nutty-bready aromas. Nutty caramel flavors, finishes on the sweet side. Medium bodied with a kind of watery mouthfeel, an average brown."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed an overpowering 3"" light brown head above the dark amber brew. Head fades very slowly, with areas of frothy lace. Aroma is minimally of effervescent malts, I expect some sort of nuttiness from a nut brown. Taste is lightly nutty, but other than than little character to note. Mouthfeel seems quite thin, with drinkability being a bit better, but overall not much redeeming here. Lots better brews in the cooler..."
"Found this very drinkable, but made thirstier for something heavier..."
"This is a cola colored brew that poured a small head and is leaving some lacing. Nose is slight hint of toasted malts and chocolate. Taste is not overly complex, a combination of tasted malts and a slight hint of chocolate. Mouthfeel is pretty thin and not overly lively. Drinkability is pretty good. I am not a big fan of the Nut Brown style but this has a taste that is pretty good."
"The beer emigrates from the 12-ounce brown bottle a somewhat hazy brown with a portly light tan head that is semi-creamy in texture as it fades away; the lace forms a concealing blanket upon the glass. Nose is malt with light caramel tones, fresh and somewhat tobacco like, start is lightly sweet and the malt profile light to moderate with the top light in its feel. Finish is mildly acidic, the hops benign in their spiciness, somewhat sour aftertaste is also dry, a drinkable beer, but not a real hit with me."
"tiny bit of hops noted in the short finish. Probably wouldnt buy again."
"This is a pleasant nut brown ale...I like the chocolate, minerals and grain husk, though it's a touch thin bodied. On a side note, their busy labels annoy me. I can hardly tell what the freakin' beer is. Get it? ""Buster nut?"" Yawn..."
"This beer pours a clear ruby amber color with a light brown head. The aroma is malty with roasted notes, biscuits, caramel and even perhaps a hint of cherry fruitiness. The body of this beer is light, actually a bit lighter than I was expecting. The taste is a mix of malty sweetness, lightly roasted barley notes, and a cherry like fruitiness. There is certainly nothing wrong with this beer, and it does have a nice mix of fresh flavors, but it is a bit thin and it is missing a little something."
"Pours a mediumish brown with red highlights a nice tan head leaves light lacing. Aroma is toasted malt and a good nutty smell with some light hops noted also. Taste is malt lightly sweet to start then nutty notes come to the front it finishes with light fruity hop flavor and a touch of bitterness. Overall not a bad beer but nothing really great going on either. Mouthfeel is a little light with drinkability being good they go down easy enough it is just lacking a little something to push it into the good category."
"Pours with light brown, two-fingered bubbly head, fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Light-medium carbonation. Light bodied. Deep amber color. Not much of a nose. Starts hoppy finishes very hoppy and bitter. $1.69 for a 12oz bottle from Super 7-Even Raleigh, NC."
"Pours a light caramelly root beer brown with a fizzy light tan head. Decent lacing. Smell is brown sugar biscuit, light nuttiness, with a hint of bitter cocoa. Taste is mild, buttery, slightly sweet toasted malt up front. This is followed by a minerally, kinda bitter finish, with a touch of caramel-flavored coffee. Not bad, like other brewpub browns I've had. Mouthfeel is light-med., and the carbonation is a bit much. Less fizz, and a creamier, less watery consistency would be good."
"12 ounce bottle. The flavor was so average I forgot to drink the entire glass."
"Drinkability: A solid beer but nothing impressive."
"Not what I was expecting, imminently drinkable, but lacks anything that would make you want to."
"Thanks to prAna for the sample."
"The Buster Nut poured a dark reddish brown, with a smallish fizzy head that quickly went down to a small top. It has a very nice roasted malt aroma with chocolate and coffee mixed in - almost like a porter. The taste was kind of bland - malty and acidic up front with a sweetish malty finish. As it warms, more malty nuttiness comes out. It had a kind of watery mouthfeel. Overall, a decent drinking brown, but nothing special."
