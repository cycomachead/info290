Smell is a roasted ""burnt"" (I tend to like the burnt, smokey aroma in all mt alcoholic drinks) with a sweet malt aroma and it tastes how it smells with very little hoppiness. A perfect feel with a medium body, not too heavy or light. Overall, this is my go-to beer at most eateries and pubs if they have it, very drinkable, and I'll sometimes do a ""BlackCastle"" when transitioning to a stout. I used to put the bottles in my bilge when sailing long distances as it can be drunk at a higher temp than American ales (seawater is close to 55-60F and my cast-iron keel moderates the bilge temp).","Capt_Pete","Mar 19, 2015"

3.08,-7.2,4,3.5,2.75,3,3,"A relatively aggressive pour results in a one inch off-white head, and a strong malt aroma wafts up. (A gentle pour results in not much of a head and not as much aroma.) Dark brown coffee color, the head dissipates fairly quickly with clinging lacing that follows the beer down the side of the glass as you drink. Sweet malt aroma if you take a whiff with your nose ""in"" the glass. Taste backs up the aroma with a dusty, English malt flavor. Full malt taste, with some bitterness in the coming through, just a touch of hops that fades quickly. The English yeast does come through, but I would have liked to have had it be more assertive to balance the malt dominance. Even though a bit one-dimensional, it is very flavorful. Lightly carbonated, as is typical for an English ale. Aftertaste is sweet and (you'll never guess) malty, and it lingers for awhile. While it is sweet, it is not overly or cloyingly so. This ale is meant to be consumed at English pub temperature. If you drink it too cold, it will taste thin and watery. It needs to be at the proper temperature to be fully appreciated. So, if you refrigerate it, let it warm up a bit and the body and mouth feel improves noticeably. At 4.7% ABV, this does meet the ""session"" criteria here in the USA, but it is a bit to strong for that in the UK. This ale, while pleasant and flavorful, it too one-dimensional for me.","MNAle","Dec 23, 2014"

Admittedly there is a fairly strong initial taste when first trying and it is effectively a marmite scenario in that you either love it or hate it, there is no real inbetween on that front but in regards to my opinion (which lets be fair my review and all that) it is a good drink to have when relaxing in the pub with mates. As well as that I found it to be a good opener before a night out but I would say don't drink repeatedly all night as it has a tendency to make you feel heavier and perhaps more sluggish.

Despite taking place in the same establishment as the first part of our evening, this was the closest thing to craft that we could find, and since we hadn’t yet reviewed it we figured why not. Having had this beer many times in the past I’m not sure what we were expecting to be different this time, but for some reason, now we found it to be much less enjoyable than in the past. Perhaps we are putting up our noses a bit, but nothing seemed authentic about this beer at all, through either the nose or the mouth. This is fine if you’re just shooting the breeze and don’t really care what you’re drinking, and likely much of this will be swilled throughout the World Cup events, but turn elsewhere if you’re looking for something a little less commercial.","TheBrewo","Jun 15, 2014"

Instead of buying this, get some Samuel Smiths, I just tried their Imperial Stout and it was pretty damn good. If you live in the midwest you can find a lot of Sam Smiths easily and they make some GREAT beers. This is probably the Bud Light of English beers, don't let it skew your opinion, England makes some great beer. Sadly, this isn't one of them, and It's one of the most available over here in the states.","brownbomber420","May 30, 2014"

The artificial caramel color that is added to this beer does deceive your senses into thinking there is more to this beer than their actually is, so their is something to be said about the eyes having the first taste. Since I cut out all artificial ingredients in my diet, this beer will no longer be in my fridge, nor ordered while out, and I also think it's a shady practice for a reputable brewery to be taking shortcuts on flavor while dosing some artificial crap to compensate for lack of quality.","GCBrewery","Feb 04, 2014"

Light sweet grain and a fruitiness. Bit of grass and toasted grain. Tatse is earhty with a light sweetness and a very light mouthfeel. Sweet grain that's drying in the middle. A little buttery and a bit of fruity flavor. The malt is very light and not as smooth and rich as some other browns. Little bit of hop bitter to finish it. The mouhtfeel is a bit slick and it's crisp with a bit of refreshment. There is a slight metallic bit underneath as it warms but by the time you finish your pint that is a vague memory. Has a surprising bit of refreshment to offer. Really very good and while ti is not rich or expansive in it's malt it is very easy to drink and extremely sessionable.","utopiajane","Jan 18, 2014"

In the days before good beer was readily available in bars and restaurants in my area Newcastle was always my first choice when out for dinner/drinks, as it was commonly the only non-BMC brew available. I loved it on draft but always hated the terrible, clear bottle skunk flavor when I tried to buy it for home. I don't recall ever getting one that didn't taste that way. Fast-forward to 2013, poured from a can it tastes just like the draft Newcastle I ""grew up"" on. Although I now have what some call a snobby palate, Newcastle is going back in the rotation.","AGust82","Nov 06, 2013"

On the palate the beer is mild brown sugar and dry sweet malt, hints of vinous fruit, vanilla notes, tea. Minimal nuts or chocolate. People taste strong nuts in this? Maybe if your taste buds have some form of Olympic level training. Gustatory illusion based on style expectations I think. Watery tepid body and drinks more like a lager than a brown ale. Finishes with a fairly dry bitter earthy note. Beer with a lofty reputation that is not born out in the tasting.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 09, 2013"

Aroma of caramel malt, nuts, a hint of sourness and whiffs of skunkiness. Flavor follows, with light caramel, slightly biscuit malt, hints of toasted malt, walnuts, slightly sweet. A lightly hoppy, malty finish with faint skunkiness. Light bodied. A lightly, but satisfactorly flavored English brown that is well suited for its purpose as an entry level English brown. It is refreshing that Calendonian has not succumbed to the fad of brown bottles that would prevent the delightful addition of skunk butt to the beer over time. Or not. Not a bad light mealtime beer. A good choice if you stuck somewhere with limited beer selection as it's quite well distributed and more interesting than most mass produced beer. Buy the ones in the dark cooler.","LiquidAmber","Aug 28, 2013"

Aside from it's exterior looks, you could do some hand waving and say that this tastes better out of a can than the bottle. The bottom line is that there's a lot to be desired. No coffee! No cocoa!

Very bland taste that didn't improve at all as the beer warmed. The watery taste gave way to a faint graininess that faded away into a hop bitterness that just didn't compliment the thin beer at all. This is a pathetic excuse for the style. Avoid this brew. Go with a Samuel Smith's or a Boneshaker instead.","Jsmick","Jun 08, 2013"

The smell was mostly a muted mix of the normal barley and malts, but at least it wasn't overpowering. The beer can pour a tall head if your not careful, and has you would think, it had little staying power. Surprisingly, the lacing was very evident and stuck all the way down the glass. Mouthfeel was like most others, a high level of carbonation evident the moment it hits your tongue. What really stands out is the smooth taste of the dark ale, it was very, very drinkable - that just stands out to me.

The head is big and smooth with a couple of craters and sticky Styrofoam-like lacing, though it mellows out into islands of foam. The beer smells cloying with sweet malts that have a tinge of sour in them and slightly skunked smell. The beer’s taste is much like the smell only less cloying. Caramel malts and biscuity malt are present in the taste, and there is a slight roasted flavor also present. Bitters are slight an nearly not present except in the aftertaste where there is a slight medicinal play in among the sweet malts. Mouthfeel is slightly harsh with carbonation in the initial sip, but mellows into a thick and slightly chewy feel that is quite pleasant though has a slightly watery feel and it does leave a slight sticky feel in the mouth. Overall this beer is a nice English brown, the mouthfeel is a little weak, but overall it’s worth a taste.","Maxwell","Sep 12, 2012"

Packaging makes you want to drink, which is important to me in choosing a beer. Even though I drank from a bottle, I've seen the way it pours and the head doesn't last for very long. It dissipates about 1 minute and a half after it's poured. So you're better off having it from the bottle. The smell was like a dull yuengling (which I love how yuengling smells, but I'm not a fan of the taste). The taste was very bland and bitter. Almost a little too robust. Like drinking extremely strong tea without sweetner (yes I'm a southerner). And the mouth feel was a little too bubbly to me. I like a dull carbonated feeling. If you're more about hops and robust-ness then this is your beer. But if you look for more of a well-rounded flavor that expands when it's in your mouth this is not for you.","Mikala","Jul 16, 2012"

There is a good amount of head (maybe two fingers) which is beige to brown. The aroma is heavy on the malt. I smell mostly cereal grains and bread, maybe a hint of peanut butter. The taste is light and not complex at all. To me it tastes like caramel and ash. It definitely has a buttery taste that seems to coat the tongue which is probably responsible for making it taste light. There is a hops sensation in the aftertaste. I find it has a medium body and appropriate carbonation. Overall, I'm somewhat disappointed in the lack of taste. A brown ale could accomplish much more. Actually, it reminds me of a lager with a little more of a dull taste.","maclean25","May 28, 2012"

It's an easy beer to get drunk off of and it's also a good beer just to have a few of. I rated it pretty eye for my opinion. I think people should at least try this.","Clones21","Apr 20, 2012"

The aroma had a metallic note with faint malt and no describable hop notes.The taste was mainly of the metallic note described in the aroma that faded to a bready malt aftertaste. The mouth feel was medium with little residual carbonation. Overall not a bad beer. The low marks may have been due to age as the stuff probably doesn't fly off the shelves here quite as a fast as other specialty brews. Overall I'm given the impression that this is the UK version of a Budweiser or other mass produced brew.","Rantingfury","Mar 25, 2012"

The aroma is a bit muted but consists of a distinct caramel malty sweetness, small earthen hops, and a nutty character. I would prefer a bit more volume as it's not bad just mild in nature. Similar the nose the beer starts and ends with the thick caramel malt sweetness with a light but noticeable earthy hop and mild bitterness. The nutty character provides a gentle yet fulfilling and balances everything out well. Finishes a bit watery and thin but crisp and clean. Lighter bodied. Overall, it's been a long time since I've had a Newcastle. This was more enjoyable than I remembered. The malty sweetness hit the spot!","hopfacebrew","Mar 22, 2012"

Something weird about this one -- It used to taste skunked every time I had it until I had it on tap. Since then, have never had a skunky one. Maybe it's a coincidence. When I don't want to think too much before grabbing something, I know this will be fine: enough of a distinctive taste worth coming back too. ...If you like it a little sweeter.","bob182","Mar 16, 2012"

This always gives a bit of a tequila smell from it, with some hazelnut and a bit of tofee malt. Flavor follows suit, and for some reason I get a tequila flavor from this (I do NOT like tequila). A watered down brown ale that seems to almost have a tequila aftertaste. Color is faint. Not a win in my book.","BMMillsy","Feb 15, 2012"

It pours a clear light sienna topped by a finger or so of off-cream foam. The nose comprises light caramel, dusty biscuit, and a touch of light grass. It's all pretty meek, lemme tell ya. The taste refuses to change things up very much, save in the intensity department, and it's not like it went crazy with that particular decision. This isn't to say it tastes bad, it just doesn't really taste all that much at all. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta smooth feel.

As smooth as it is, its got a really nice zest to the mouthfeel that furthers along the rounding out of the beer. It makes the malts pop.

The smell of the beer is a little skunky but not enough to hinder the beer. The taste of the beer is sweet up front with a nutty caramel flavor going on that fades into a bitter dry aftertaste.

I know this beer is going to be skunky, but it's not my fault they decided to make a beer in a clear bottle, so I will grade it accordingly. This beer pours a small one finger white head that disappears pretty quickly, it looks like I will get good lacing out of it, but I'm not sure. The body is dark brown with hues of red. Overall it looks pretty nice accept for the head disappearing fast. Smell is slightly skunky, slightly malts, with hints of coffee, cocoa, molasses, etc. I'm pleasantly surprised by how many different flavors I am getting on the smell, we will see if it translates to the taste, but for now it's not too bad. I can't say it's a great smell because of the skunk, but it's not very much skunk, just a little bit, noticeable, but not unbearable by any means. The taste however is not very good at all. For starters there is not nearly enough carbonation, it feels like strait water in my mouth. Secondly, the taste is just all over the place, the three most detectable flavors I get are water, skunk, and maple syrup, but not a good maple syrup taste, a fake, watery, thin male syrup taste. There might be a tiny bit of malts and a smidgen of hops in the finish, but not nearly enough to save this beer. Overall it's just way too watery, frankly it tastes like mineral water that has lost it's carbonation. Drinkability is pretty low due to the bad mouthfeel and the not so great taste.

Slight hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is fairly light to medium, with a crisp and refreshing feel to it. Carbonation is quite high, adds a tingling effect to each sip.

The nose is semi-light with sodabread, scone, caramel and orange peel most noticeable, has a minerally patina, ends with a burst of green hay and straw, if it can said to have a ""burst"" of anything. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is flat enough to keep the liquid layered on the tongue like sunscreen before you shower. Watery as in mineral water, cleansing but without richness of flavor. The caramel and toffee actually diminish as it warms. Hint of white raisin or apricot fruit with blanched nuts. Again, not much flavor left by the finish, just metallic astringency and pucker.

Not a great smell - strongly herbal, and not the kind of herbs I think I'd want in my food. The taste makes up for it though. I've never seen this kind of nuttiness in another beer. The herbal scent is still present, but it fades into the background. Unfortunately, it sticks around once the rich central flavor has dissipated, causing a solid knock to the mouthfeel score. Drinkability wise, it's pretty heavy. You could do a number in succession, but you'd feel it. A very interesting beer that's worth a try, but may or may not work for you.

The addition of corn to the grist helps here (and yes, I know I counted its thin body against the beer in the mouthfeel section, but only relative to style). Good ole Newkie Brown, just a slight step up from the american lagers IMO. It would definitely get a better rating if it was packaged properly! (I wonder how much better it presents itself in a can?) The truth of the matter is that I thoroughly enjoy this underappreciated style. I consequently have very mixed feelings returning to this paradigm, the origin of the northern english browns. But now having studied it as a homebrewer, I know the enemy and it is mediocrity. What I've learned is that the english truly understood balance (which is not to be conflated with blandness) even if this beer only poorly exhibits the virtues of british brewing.

I stumbled upon it by luck at Beercellar which is nearby Oosters. I believe that a number of pubs in Singapore. I have been looking for this beer, so naturally I grabbed one bottle to go. This beer surprisingly poured out without much head; only a layer of foam with clinging lacing; color was a dark amber brown that can still barely see through. Smell was strong on malts with some nuttiness and some faint fruits. The taste was hugely malts with little fruit undertones and I think there was a little of apple which kind of became grapes as it progresses into a rather faint after taste. Also in the after taste was the malty profile which seems to be the feature of this beer which is nothing really special. The mouthfeel was really commonplace and nothing impressive too; a slightly above average carbonation greets me upon entry and the mouthfeel was kind of watery otherwise as it is fairly light on the body and there was no creamy smoothness. The drinkabilty here was someone water like smoothness with the exception of tingling carbonation as it goes down. Generally, an OK beer better than the local macros but definitely not impressive (I will choose a Stella Atois on the tap anytime) but still, I am glad I managed to find it and give it a try.","basica","Oct 26, 2007"

Expecting a sweet malty nutty aroma, I was disappointed to find the aroma very skunky, with little notice of the malt. The taste is better, but not great. Sweet malt, maybe a hint of hops, and a slight nutty flavor. Mouthfeel is not as thick as expected. IMO, this is like the Budweiser of brown ales.

I understand the sentiment, as this is probably the first Brown Ale that many will try, but now that I've had plenty of better Brown Ales, I recognize this beer's weaknesses.

Body is light, bordering on thin, and only slightly carbonated, which complements the light body very well.

The palate is smooth and nutty, slightly sweet, with a light cracker-like malt character and a hint of chocolate. The hops are just barely perceptible in the finish. This is a wonderfully delicate beer, and a classic English brown ale. Though not as assertive as American brown ale, which is a maltier, hoppier brew, Newcastle should be appreciated for its subtle delicacy. Its easy to throw loads of hops and malt at a beer and make it a big one.

Sweet, chocolate and caramel like in flavors. Very interesting, almost leads you to think this isn't beer?...alcohol is hidden like a champ! The mouthfeel is decent, a little bit watery. The drinkability is probably the best part of this beer. Not offensive in any way. You can probably suck down a whole six pack before you feel like youre at the yacking stage.

It has a very nice amount of carbonation, managing to give it a nice kick, without tasting like a soda. This beer is very easy to drink as it leaves a very nice after taste, however as you get towards the end it tends to taste watered down. Over all I think this is one of my favourite beers.

It looked pretty appealing in that nice clear bottle, and smelled like a beer ought to- some roasted malts and some balancing hops, (not a lot of yeast that I could detect). Taste was ok, with some sweet and rich malts up front and some hops that were nicely balanced (if not really interesting) in the back. But there was a bitter aftertaste as well that negatively effected what would otherwise have been good drinkability. Mouthfeel was fine I guess. I have no complaints about Newcastle being too watery or too carbonated or too flat or too thick. All in all this would probably make a good session beer, though its not really a taste explosion (which is the point of a Brown Ale I'm given to understand). For that reason it is the best selling Ale in England. Bass, its nearest competitor is better though. It's got more depth and its more interesting. I don't hold the bitterness against Newcastle because my samples turned out to have been sitting in my host's fridge for quite a while, but until I try it again, I can't give it a great drinkability rating.

Taste is good....fairly mild, sweet with some malt flavor. This is not a heavy beer...not watery but less substantial than I was expecting. Drinkability is very good.

Malt is not well balanced with the hops - too much on the malty side. It just doesn't have much in the way of flavor going for it. The mouthfeel is very carbonated, but somewhat watery for an English brown. It is quite drinkable, though, because it goes down pretty easy and has a low ABV %.

The brew pours to a mid brown color with a fairly good-sized head that dissipates very quickly and leaves hardly any lacing except at the very top of the brew. The scent of this brew is somewhat sweet from molasses and brown sugar along with buttery overtones. Not a bad smelling brew but not overly interesting to me anymore.

Starts mild where the malt body seems almost diluted...hops are barely detectable but always sit in the background. The finish is quick and uneventful without the lingering malt after taste one expects from a brown ale.

Just not too much there - the dull hop flavor is there in equal force as the toasted malt, but the finish is fast, weak, and just a harsh graininess. Very bland malt flavors for a brown ale - do they use coloring?. Pretty full body but with a biting carbonation. I did not enjoy this beer, although I hear it is better on draft.

On the subject of mouthfeel this beer is too light to be called a brown ale and might be brewed with a little more dark grain charachter to give us something to taste.

Mouthfeel is rather thin and watery for the style with an unappealing finish. Pretty easy to drink, but I wasn't up for another one. I used to love this beer, but I guess my palate has evolved over the years. Not bad, but there are much better brown ales out there.","Jon","Nov 15, 2002"

Carmel, flat kind of taste. You could sense the hops if you really concentrated. It didn't take away from the taste of the anchovies on my pizza either.

The taste is very smooth with good carbonation, then it opens up into roasted grain with a caramel overtone, regressing into a slight bitter aftertaste.

The nose offers complete toasted brown sugar even if it's a bit shy. Hops and spices are evident as well. Good, dry, nutty, charred sugar and crisp hop bitterness could be a little more integrated/smoother. The very active carbonation gets in the way a bit. Worth drinking.","putnam","Oct 14, 2002"

It's in a clear bottle but it's not skunked. The body is light with a moderate carbonation giving it a smooth mouthfeel. The flavor offers a lightly sweet, caramel maltiness and subtle earthy hop flavor (Fuggles?) that's supported by an underlying bitterness. There's also a nutty and buttery character that's very nice. It finishes fairly dry with a softly lingering residual maltiness. A very drinkable beer that offers some nice characteristics.","NeroFiddled","Oct 05, 2002"

Its not changed at all !!. Pours a dark amber, brown colour. A tight 1/4"" head at first, but this soon dissippated. Very little nose, but a solid mouthfeel, malty with that unique Newcastle Brown Ale trait. Dryish, almost nutty, with a faint hoppy bitterness in the lingering aftertaste. Moorish, and quaffable. My only complaint is that there are better, but lesser known, Brown Ales both sides of the Atlantic that are (incorrectly in my opinion) compared to this beer. Possibly over-rated, but a damn good Session Beer.","TheLongBeachBum","Sep 19, 2002"

Possesses a truly strange medicinal aroma, not at all like any brown ale I have had, not a hint of malt.  Taste begins with toasted malts, followed by rather prominent alcohol notes, then strong, though not overpowering hops.  Finish is dry with a bit of residual bitterness.  In all, I am somewhat disappointed, brown ales are one of my favorite styles, I had expected more from this beer.
