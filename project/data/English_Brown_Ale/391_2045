3.5,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Ahhh, Trad. It's entirely possible that I've consumed more Traditional Ale than any other beer brewed in Alberta. The more I think about it, I'm positive that is the case. I'm reviewing this based on my most recent tasting (during the intermission of the Best of Banff Film Festival), along with distinct palate memory. Trad is far from the best brown ale you can buy. It pours nicely, smells like yeast and malt, and has a lovely Caramilk and walnut flavour to it. It's the granddaddy of Alberta craft beer and still a solid choice, 30 years later.","Bunman3","Dec 24, 2014"

Aroma is sweet grainy malt, artificial vanilla extract, a faint hint of earthy herbal hops. Palate is smooth, sweet corn syrup, mellow toasty malt, carnival peanuts, some treacle, vanilla toffee notes, faint earthy hops. Mouthful is quite nice actually, silky smooth and decent body, some chewy malts. An underachieving brown ale that is a decent sessional if one is in an old school pub mood.

Overall, I really liked this beer and would have some on hand at all times if I could.

Body was light to medium on the palate, and slightly oily/creamy, with lively carbonation. Nice flavor that starts off slightly sweet, but finishes with a light bitterness, yet short duration.

3.5,3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I think this is the best of the Big Rock beers that I had on my trip to Banff. Dark copper colored pale ale, it may be a little dark for style, but a strong malty base give the beer a good mouthfeel (sometimes hard to find in Canadian beer). Very reminiscent of northwest pale ales like Sierra Nevada. A strong aromatic hop but not overly assertive compared to the fruity esters and malty base of the beer. In many of the bars, this became my back up beer of choice, and on tap it opens up a bit more compared to the can I am reviewing now. If you see a row of Big Rock and Sleeman on the tap, go Traditional.","FightingEntropy","May 01, 2006"
3.08,-8.9,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Decent mouthfeel with some good cleansing and medium bodied. Overall, this beer is OK. Not bad in a pinch. Nothing too exciting.","atigerlife","Oct 06, 2005"
2.71,-19.8,3,2,3,3.5,2.5,"Appeared more like an amber ale with a translucent, copper color and a off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a touch of lacing behind. Moderate level of carbonation. Aromas of enriched milk, syrup, and burnt toast; not very appealing, the combo, that is. The taste was mostly sweet with a touch of bitterness in the finish. Flavors of smoked, roasted sugars seemed to come out. A bit astringent though and somewhat chalky in my mouth. Had a pint of this and I didn't want another. Seems like some artifical flavoring was added to this one with the subtle taste of syrup.","jaluria","Beers"

3.38,0,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A nice copper coloured ale with a good amount of carbonation. I tend to think of this one as a kind of "suped-up" and less adjunct ladden Labatt 50. Well balanced hop and bready-malt flavor, and the carbonation makes it quite refreshing. Tastes quite fresh, even though it came out of a can. A bit watery, but still a good everyday beer. Bottled samples I've had have been a little inconsistent, but the can and draft samples have been far more reliable.","fisherman34","Aug 24, 2005"

3.68,8.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Tastes nice and toasty. Bready, caramel, toasty notes and a good bits of hops at the finish. Incredibly drinkable with buddies, one friend commented when sharing the pitcher, "I have to stop myself, it just dissappears if I just get talking and forget not to drink". Very true.","niangelo","Mar 08, 2005"
3.58,5.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I had two of these, one each on seperate nights and each time they tasted slightly different. The one night it seemed quite bland and slightly sweet, the other night it seemed very sweet. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. While this isn't something that reaches out and grabs you, it is a decent beer and worth drinking on occasion.","Noxious26","Mar 07, 2005"
3.68,8.9,3.5,3,4,3.5,4,"D- I really thought of this more as an American Brown Ale than an APA. It had much more malt depth with hops playing a nice supporting roll. It was a nice session beer when sitting in the Canadian Rockies.","rhoadsrage","Dec 24, 2004"

3.38,0,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"355 ml can.  Probably the most popular Big Rock product. Color is a coppery red. Almost no head, leaves a patchy cap of surface foam, small amount of lacing. First smell is sweet, sugary malt with slight caramel. Taste is sweet and grainy, light bitter to finish, but overall well balanced and no after taste. Medium body, and easy to drink. If you are expecting a "traditional ale" you might be dissapointed because it is somewhat characterless. Has no overpowering strong points, just good all around.","BigBry","Oct 18, 2004"
3.43,1.5,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Poured with almost no head at all, but retained a small lace through the whole glass. Brown colour, not very pale at all. Malt and nuts on the nose. Taste is nutty with mild alcohol and a bit of sweetness in the middle. Mouthfeel isn't spectacular, but I like the taste, so I give this a higher drinkability rating as I find it a very good session beer. I much prefer it on tap as I have had many times on visits to Calgary. I usually start to crave this beer in the Autumn, when I want something a little darker, but not very. Not a bad offering from Big Rock.","trevorwideman","Sep 17, 2004"
3.12,-7.7,3,3.5,2.5,3,4,"Very clear coppery red colour. Off-white head quickly subsided to a thin lace. Malty aroma with some caramel and light nuttiness. The flavour was a bit disappointing, with some grainy sweetness to start and finishing with a very light bitterness. It's almost as if the flavour disappears part way through. Medium/high carbonation and light body with almost no aftertaste.","DrJay","Aug 17, 2004"

2.81,-16.9,3.5,2.5,2.5,4,3,"Pours a dull dark copper color with a crackly head that fades fast. Soft malts and some floral hops make up the aroma. The flavor is of sweet malts and some funny yeast taste. The hops are not very noticeable. This beer was a dissapointment to me. Its seriously lacking in the hop department and has a very bland run of the mill flavor. The finish is clean but way too watery. This beer is like an amateur extract hombrew.","CAMRAhardliner","May 15, 2004"

3.05,-9.8,3,3,3,3.5,3,"It's drinkable, and unthreatening. I guess that's why soooo many people drink "trad" here in Calgary. It's not a pale ale, and it's not a *great* beer, but it's not bad.","Garin","Apr 08, 2004"
3.35,-0.9,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Had this on tap in many Calgary and Edmonton pubs...flows like water here as BR has sewed up the draft market locally. Tapped a crystal clear darker amber, slight white cap that doesn't last long. Slight hints of citrusy and grassy hop, boiled grains in the aroma. Starts light and rather timid for a traditional english dark ale ale but then the fuller body kicks in midway with the well balanced hop and malt departure the finish is clean with a lingering "bread" after taste. As commercial Canuck ales go this is probably the best of the lot but still lacking. It's another attempt to "Canadianize" a traditional ale style for the mass market....it is always a compromise....but as compromises go this one has retained a modicum of ale character to make it king of the commercial Canuk ales.","pootz","Oct 14, 2003"

All malt nose, sweet and clean a satisfactory sniffer, sweet malt start, once again a bit thin on top for me, but nothing I cant live with. Finish is sternly acidic, the hops pleasant in their spiciness, quite dry and a fine drinking beer especially in the hot summer months.","Gusler","Apr 24, 2003"
4.03,19.2,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This is the first microbrew I ever tasted, way back in the day. It was also my standard as a teenager and in my early college days (I was a beer snob even back then). Better than anything else available at the time. I strayed away over the years, in pursuit of new brews, and feel I have come full circle. It's good to come home, been a while since I sampled a Trad. Now I can fully appreciete it. Pours out a clear reddish-amber tone, decent heat to begin with, but it fades away to a lacy ring in time. Nose is of rich malt, intense hops, wood smoke, a hint of spice, and an even fainter hint of melon. Taste is an impressive balance of malt and hops, one receeding behind the other, nice full mouthfeel, and goes down smooth. The golden standard of Big Rock, it lets you know what real ale should taste like. A perfect session ale, it leaves one satisfied. A close 2nd behind their McNally's Extra Ale for top quality.","IronDjinn","Mar 14, 2003"
