3.65,-2.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a dark, crisp, vibrant looking, ruby-highlighted brown coloring with a short-stacked head that quickly vanishes, leaving only the slightest film covering behind. The aromas are rich, and darkly sweet, with chocolate, caramel, and molasses aromas. There is a smokey tone throughout the nose, also. Flavors are extremely crisp, with a good, slightly sweet, nutty background, and some heavier sweet caramel and smokey overtones. A steady roast quality, with some dry, pepper hopping at the end of the palate. The aftertaste is slightly bitter, with a roast coffee character, and some dark chocolate flavors, as well as a slightly charred flavor. The finish is clean and slick, with a slight sweetness left behind. Good flavor profile and blending overall, making a tasty beer.

3.97,6.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"O: A nice change of pace from Oktoberfest biers and pumpkin ales that dominate the shelves during autumn. A well-done English brown ale that plays up the malt flavors in a big way with satisfying nutty and earthy flavors to match those falling leaves. Looks a bit flat and viscous, but take the Bros advice and give a hard pour in a big glass to achieve a head worthy of this well-crafted fall brew.","Gambrinus1184","Oct 16, 2011"

3.55,-4.8,4,4,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Clear reddish chestnut colour, quite dark, with a short cap of beige bubbles. A bit of lacing, decent head retention. Caramel malt aroma, sweet with brown sugar and apple, a bit bready with faint hops and a hint of cocoa. Nice flavour as well, bitterness was restrained and let the malts dominate. Not overly sweet though, more of a caramel meets chocolate and dried fruit character. Light, lingering bitterness with a bit of leafy hops. The texture was a little slick, medium bodied with carbonation that was slightly coarse. Not a fan of the mouthfeel on this. Overall it was pretty tasty though. I liked the malts and thought the flavours held together well.","DrJay","Nov 04, 2010"
4.2,12.6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Drinkability: One of my new go-to Autumn beers that I've had, this one has all of the characteristics to make a beer perfect for it's season.

At 5.8%, it's an easier drinker and a good one to have around on a cold autumn night!","thespaceman","Oct 29, 2010"

3.8,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The beer is a bit above medium bodied; it feels slightly thick. There isn't too much carbonation. What is there does give my tongue a tingle. I find this seasonal to be quite drinkable. I've found myself having a number of bottles in an evening. It's a tad too strong to be truly sessionable, but the alcohol isn't very strong (either in flavor or potency), which allows one to consume most of a six pack before you realize what you've done (that's why I recommend going straight for the 12 pack).","ToasterChef","Oct 14, 2010"

3.88,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. It's a deep brown, like a dark cherry/oak or mahogany color. There is a dense white creamy looking head with very small bubbles to it that sticks around about 3/4ths of the session. There is a massive sheet of lace that makes it's way back down to the liquid after a few seconds. The smell isn't very strong at first. It's pretty heavy on the malt with some hints of chocolate and followed by some pine hops. The taste is a step up from the smell. Like the smell it's heavy on the malt accompanied by chocolate and molasses, with a slight hop finish. It starts off sweet and finishes off a little bitter. The mouthfeel is good, it's well balanced but full bodied, and the drinkablilty is good as well.","AndyAvalanche","Nov 12, 2009"

Grainy, malty, and a hint of something spicy. Taste was grainy and malty, but not as malty or sweet as style would suggest, and it had a bitterness that came in through the middle and lingered.

The ringwood yeast is apparent, as is the roasted flavors, the nutmeg spiciness, and some residual tea like hops. This is one brown ale that I can skip. I think there might be some diaceytl in there as well, but the flat maltiness mixed in with some spices in the allspice family, is just too much for my palate.

Virtually no head, very little carbonation. As the name suggests, it's Autunm-ie, brown, with deep reddish hues. At 5.8%, a great session beer. Goes down easily. Seasonals are so good.

3.78,1.3,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"A very interesting Autumn Ale and one of the hoppier English Browns I can remember trying. This isn't to say this is a Brown IPA but this style doesn't usually have hops this noticeable. Its a nice change, and this would be a Brown that should appeal to hopheads and a nice change-up for maltheads. Can see this going great with aged cheddar, beef, root veggies, any sandwich on good bread with cheese. Anyone looking for a change of pace or just a nice, easy to drink beer that should appeal to hop & malt lovers alike should definitely seek this out before the winds of November blow it away for another year.","BuckSpin","Sep 24, 2007"

Nutty in the flavor as well. Think walnuts mixed with some pumpkin pie spice. A nice beer overall. Certianly plenty drinkable in the autumn months.

Really neat label on the bottle with no best by date. Really nice color of this beer. I was a bit disappointed with the head but the taste made up for much of its appearance. Smells malty and sweet with some caramel hints. Nice floral hop aroma mixed in with the malt. Taste is malted sweetness with a nice clean hop finish. Light caramel flavors with a mild floralness from the hops. It is rather thin and watery like. It seems like it is missing something from the body. It needs some perkiness is that aspect.

Had this one on draught at Bull Feeney's, J's Oyster (really good seafood & what a view from the outdoor tables!) and $3 Dewey's in the Old Port. WOW!! Better than I imagined, as I have loved this one from the bottle for a long time, and this year's draught version appears to be the best I have had. Carbonation is much softer with the flavor being much better than the bottle. In addition, the 3 places I went to, served it at a nice temperature. Nirvana for sure.

Bitter citrusy hops mingle with a mild metallic tang and a slightly peppery spiciness.

Not much hop presence stands out. Felt a little watery to finish. A good beer, I just had expected so much more after having the HSA earlier this summer and being at the GLB.

Tastes like a Marzen styled brew a bit with flavors and aromas of caramel malt-toasty and moderately extracted. Good weight in the mouth and just right for the season-not too heavy and not too light.

The body is medium but disappointingly fades quickly. Very thin on aftertaste save the hops. Very smooth. Easy to drink, especially if you don't mind the hops.
