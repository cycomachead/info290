4.19,2.9,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,"the vanilla adds a real nice touch to this already exceptional brown ale, and to have it from the nitro tap was awesome. cool little taphouse in stuart, florida called the crafted keg. its so creamy looking, darker than i remember it from the can, and holding its luxurious milky head leaving rings at every sip in the pint glass. it smells vanilla heavy, but not artificial at all, but some of the roast seems tamed by the sweetness it brings. the flavor holds true to that, and while the vanilla brings an awesome new flavor wrinkle, some of what made the original base beer special is lost to it just a bit. still, its a great base beer for vanilla, and i think the dosage is appropriate, except the sweetness that it brings lingers on the palate, maybe aided by the nitro feel less aggressive bubbles to wash the mouth clean. fuller bodied like a porter more than a brown ale as we know them. its not a negative, it just limits how much of this is desirable to drink, couple of pints tops for me, where regular maduro i was good for a sixer no problem. cool tweak, less nutty, more sweet, equally delicious.","StonedTrippin","Feb 15, 2015"

The aroma is very similar to the regular version but with a strong vanilla smell that takes center stage, other notes of dark malt, subtle sweetness, cocoa take a back seat. The taste is all vanilla for the first second then slowly transitions to the roasted malt and cocoa flavors. Lingering taste of vanilla. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium.

3.92,-3.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"On tap at Cigar City takes NYC event at Rattle 'N' Hum. Raters at my table were not so oy-yoy-yoy about the vanilla, but I appreciated the vanill's edge and smoothness,a rising above the chocolate and making it a decent drinker, owing to it being more on the sweeter side.Very dark with a whisp of a head, suitably carbonated.","Sammy","Jan 15, 2010"
4.12,1.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"D: As previously mentioned, I was expecting just a hint of vanilla, but was actually quite surprised by the amount of vanilla. My only complaint was the level of sweetness that it provided, but otherwise I found it to be quite nice.","womencantsail","Nov 28, 2009"
4.03,-1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Haha!! Crazy 32oz growler!! Thanks, Grant. It pours a barely translucent dark mahogany brown color with a deep foamy tan head that fades slowly leaving sheets of Belgian lacing behind. Smells like rich malty Hershey's syrup with a vanilla chaser. It carries over to the taste nicely. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is creamy smooth yet singular. The semi-sweet creamy chocolate lingers appropriately too. At 5.5% ABV this one is really easy drinker. Two pints are a tease!!.","jjayjaye","Nov 06, 2009"
4.03,-1,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Draft sample at Cigar City. Poured a clear brown color with an average frothy brown head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt and dark vanilla aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy cocoa and vanilla sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate duration. Solid complex brew.","tmoneyba","Oct 23, 2009"

4.25,4.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"D and overall impression: Drinkability, although high, will be limited by the sweetness from the vanilla. Overall, yet another good treatment of an already great beer. Can't wait to see what Joey and Wayne can come up with next. Skal.","Gtreid","Beers"
4.5,10.6,4,4,5,4,4.5,"drinkability is great. excellent balance. nice depth. even better than the regular maduro with the extra added character and complexity from the vanilla. i'll admit that i'm generally not a big fan of vanilla, so i was definitely not expecting to like this one as much as the other two, but it has definitely won me over and was my favourite of the three. this one is a real winner.","grub","0"
4.17,2.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"This is another solid offering from CCB though I probably prefer the original Maduro to this one. It's definitely sweeter and less roasty, but this coffee-lover prefers the espresso version in the head-to-head as well.","gford217","Jul 07, 2009"
4.05,-0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"sweet vanilla, almost creamer in a coffee-like, roasted malts, brown sugar, caramel, and light molasses, starts off with sweeter caramel than the other two versions, vanilla domiantes the middle with almost a root beer or cream soda feel, pretty bubbly and sweet rounded, the finish has more vanilla mixed with nuts and caramel, it never gets overly sweet which is nice, instead it enhances what is already there is the brown ale and provides a creamier overall feel, slightly sweet, roasted, and malty mouthfeel, medium bodied, moderate to high carbonation and especially for a growler, taste lingers quite well without being overbearing, could have drank a lot of this, very smooth and light feeling, good drinkability for any kind of beer containing chocolate or vanilla, would drink again, worth trying","Floydster","Jul 05, 2009"
4.67,14.7,4,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a clear dark orange/brown, some reddish hints, thin light tan head forms, settles down to a thick ring, touch less lacing than the regular, but still looks good. Smell is insane good, very fresh vanilla, tobacco and earthy, caramel, honey, light nuttiness, sweeter than the regular, some raisin, very nice. Taste is amazing, big vanilla at first, sweet and malty middle, caramel and nuts, woody, raisin, almost tastes like a Colt cigar, great vanilla character. Mouthfeel is the same as regular, medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, insanely smooth and drinkable. Wow, this stuff is good! Has a fine cigar and vanilla character to it that I really liked. Best of the three we had. Thanks Russ!","Viggo","Jun 19, 2009"

4.12,1.2,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall very, very solid. Great use of vanilla here and the light body of the brown ale underneath still shines through. I would not mind having this one every once and a while.","mikesgroove","May 30, 2009"
4.33,6.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"On tap at a CCB event at Brass Tap (Tampa, FL). Pours a dark brown with reddish highlights and thin off-white head that settles quickly. Aroma is sweet and malty with lots of vanilla and notes of chocolate, roast, brown sugar, nuts and caramel. Flavor is also sweet and malty with notes of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, wood, molasses, caramel and some hints of brown sugar and nuts. Medium body with a pleasing malty finish. A really easy drinking beer that would be great all night","Kiefdog","May 28, 2009"
4.37,7.4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"A tasty surprise during my crash course in CCB at The Brass Tap. Pours a deep, rich brown color with a tan one finger head. As I noticed in every CCB brew, nice lacing is left around the glass. The vanilla hits you right in the nose, and does so just right. It doesn't overwhelm, but it is present and is at the forefront, the sweet caramel malt smell is still there, though. Vanilla once again dominates the taste, but it really works well here. This brown ale, at its core, is far more robust than other brown ales I have had. There is a strong malt backbone providing caramel, chocolate, and even some coffee hints. This richness is paired perfectly with the vanilla. As previously stated, this is a bit richer than your average brown ale, so a bit denser, but still highly drinkable. The resulting sweetness is about the only thing that holds you back from going for too many of these.","bhalter8","Beers"
4.05,-0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4,"D: Ok, lots of vanilla keeps me at one or two pints. Tasty, but not quite as good as the Espresso Maduro I had a few nights ago at Datz.","tpd975","0"
