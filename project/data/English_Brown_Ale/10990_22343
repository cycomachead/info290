Gives the beer a nice creaminess. Mouth feel is medium to light. One of the first beers from Mississippi I have ever had.

The nose starts with some brown bread, oatmeal, and light nutty notes. Not sure that I would pick the nuttiness out as pecan, but there is definitely some influence from the adjuncts. Taste is watery with nutty notes and hints of grain. No hops noted in the flavor but some bitterness at the finish makes for an unpleasant finish. Mouthfeel is light and low carbonation. Overall, this beer is not well executed. It tastes like a really light watery beer with some adjunct flavors added. Would not return to this beer.","homebrew311","Jul 20, 2014"

I was reluctant to try it at a Gulfport pizza joint but since it was on tap there, I went for it.  It seems to be popular in the area and I wanted to give it proper test.  And was I pleased!  This beer is so good on tap.  The pecan really shines in this nutty ale.  Another party at the table said they had had it before and was un-impressed, so I told them my experience.  They decided to try it on tap here and they agreed that it was decisively better.","NeilTC","Jul 02, 2014"

Caramel with hints of roasted nuts and restrained malt in the nose with an ever-so-slight sour note. Medium-light body with suggestions of cocoa and toasted bread. Very little hops. Expecting more pecan on the palate. Slight, pleasant lingering, with restrained, but balanced malt and hop notes. No Belgian lace.

Flavor reminded me a lot of Sam Adams Boston Lager with a hint of nuttiness (but barely). I wouldn't exactly call this an ale because it tasted so much like a lager. An overall good and safe beer to have. However, I was expecting more than safe, but rather an unusual hint of pecan since I haven't had pecan-brewed beer before. Tasted like many other good lagers (not ales) I've had before.","shanny1981","May 11, 2013"

The beer did have killer lacing though. A nice caramel smell oozed from the tumbler and when I took that first hit I was pleasantly surprised. Nice sweet hit but not overbearing, sorta like a handful of kracker jacks. I reall did not get much of a pecan taste, but that might be a good thing.

Looks almost like an amber more than a brown. Lacing is soapy and slides down the glass. Aroma includes caramel malts, some nuttiness I suppose, and a slight roast. Taste is caramel maltiness, slightly sweet, again with a slight nuttiness and roast. Mouthfeel is a bit thin as expected after viewing the beer. Not jam packed with flavor but nothing off-putting and very agreeable to the average person.","KickbacksSteve","Nov 27, 2012"

Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, pecan, slight roasted malt, and bread. The flavor was of sweet malt, pecan, roasted malt, subtle milk chocolate, and bread. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a pretty decent brew. The pecan aspect of the one really managed to carry through which is surprising due to the intensity of them. This really made the brew enjoyable on my palate as I’m a huge fan of them. The aroma wasn’t quite as great as it was kind of hard to pick up on just about anything. Glad I got the chance to try this one again in a different format.","thagr81us","Nov 21, 2012"

3.11,-13.1,3.5,5,2,3,3,"Pours like a somewhat flat Dr. Pepper with a limited tan ring of head. The smell is decadent and unfortunately, betrays a forthcoming over sweetness. It smells fantastic. Like really phenomenal. The flavor is really, actually like candied pecans, almonds. It kind of smells like those booths that sell the roasted nuts based entirely on smell that just draws you in. It's pretty decadent for the ABV. This is a good beer to order if you can't drink - just sit there and smell it for a while and you aren't missing anything. The flavor is way to sweet atop a thin body, it really doesn't pull together. Im really belaboring the point, but if youn plug your nose, it tastes like nothing at all and suddenly your tongue is coated in thin bodied lingering sweetness. Without being rude and plugging your nose, the flavor is like a super poor mans version of the nose. I don't see anyway I could drink more than one of these with how sweet it finishes without even rewarding you with that in the taste. That said, the nose is worth the price of admission - swirl it up and enjoy your night as DD.","seeswo","May 20, 2011"

The smell is kinda funky, I get sweet malts and some very spicy hops, with some astringent spices. Bizarre. The taste is better, with the nutty aspects coming out quite a bit more. The sweetness and spicy hops never quite mesh though, doing a bit to drown out the (rather good) nutty, pecan flavors. The mouthfeel is coating and thick for such a low ABV brew with such a watery body. The drinkability is pretty average, I mean it goes down easily, but there's nothing here to make you go back for more.

Short-lived rather flat head. Some roasted malt flavors up front, but the nuttyness of the malt and pecan is offset by a slickness to the beer that is off-putting.","Brent","Dec 22, 2010"

Unique color but otherwise not that exciting looking. Aroma of caramel and nuts that combined, gives a true toffee note that is unmistakeable. A touch of earthiness completes the aroma. The flavor is on the sweeter side and I would of liked some darker malts and less caramel malt to compliment the nuttiness, but otherwise a pretty good English brown ale. I do not detect any roastiness from the pecans. Light body and nicely carbonated. Suitable for a low ABV, lighter flavored beer. A good English style brown ale that is very easy to drink.","morimech","Dec 10, 2010"

Nose is malty, earthy sweet and nutty with a hint of brown sugar and/or molasses. Taste follows nose - flavor profile starts out as you would expect an English Brown to express; however, towards the middle and back an earthy, slightly acidic quality comes out, and the pecans finally assert themselves.

Some nuttiness there, though I might not think ""pecan"" if I didn't already know. The smell translated cleanly into the taste, which was malty and somewhat sweet with a pleasant nuttiness to make things a little more interesting.

This is not all unlike a pecan pie but not as sweet. For a nut brown ale this hits the mark and is one of the better examples out there. With the taste of this brew combined with a 4.25 ABV this is a session brew without a doubt. I will buy if available here locally.","mooseisloose","May 02, 2010"

Some malts and sweet syrup are also present. Taste is woody and sweet. Some nut characteristics that linger and finish off the palate. Up front it is sweet syrup and malts. Mouthfeel is fairly thin. Drinkability is pretty solid. This beer taste much different than any other I have tried before and the uniqueness attracts me to it.

On a side note, I blended one of these with a Sweetwater IPA and got a sum was better than the parts.

3.74,4.5,2.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Thanks to my uncle for bringing this one back from Mississippi - 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date. Brewed with whole roasted pecans, Maris Otter, crystal malts and wheat, and hopped with Magnum and Tettnang. It pours a dark reddish hue, with medium carbonation and a half-inch of light tan head that reduces to a collar. Decent looking, but doesn't quite look like a brown ale. Malty sweet aroma, with light pecan, just a touch of aroma hops, chocolate malt, and a bit of an aged vinous character. Malts dominate the palate, with pecan flavors increasing as it warms, perhaps even masquerading as malty notes. There is a bit of sweetness, a mild hop bitterness and perhaps some chocolate malt on top of a light, crisp and tingly body that smooths out very well. This is a unique, easy to drink brown ale, but you really have to let it warm up to let all the nuances come through, despite the recommended serving temperature of 43 degrees.","mmmbeer","Dec 08, 2009"

4.07,13.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a semi dark and semi clear brown. The first whiff I took was total pecan. It wasn't so much like sniffing a handful of pecans, but more like the filling of a pecan pie. It's not overwhelming but it's enough to stand out. The taste is really a lot of toasted malt, finishes slightly sweet. It's possible to forget you're drinking a pecan beer because after a while it doesn't stand out a whole lot. A nice beer overall anyway though, and the pecan works well in a brown ale.","MiScusi","May 11, 2008"

Pleasant, but somehat light. Very pleasant taste, the elements in the aroma are echoed here, but there is also a lovely creaminess and a hint of restrained nuttiness, but there is a touch of sour graininess at the end as you continue to drink. Smooth mouthfeel with nice creaminess, but a little light at the end as it falls off. Very drinkable- nice to see such a well made session beer.","Georgiabeer","May 06, 2008"

The taste matched the smell with the pecan dominating. There is a little bit of sweet malt and some bitterness on the swallow. Also the floral hop character came out as it warmed. The mouthfeel had a slickness to it that was reminded me of eating pecans and the oil that is left over. A little low on carbonation but not bad. Very sessionable.

As I swallow the nuttiness that is lingering in the background becomes more apparent there is some nice malty sweetness mingled in there. Very well balanced.

Initially, I was a bit disappointed that the pecan flavor wasnt stronger, but it becomes more pronounced as the beer warms.

Its a nice dark coppery brown, clear with a good head that has good staying power. The aroma is rich dark malts, caramel, slightly cake like. Theres a nuttiness that isnt really obviously pecans. Its kind of like hazlenut without that slightly cloying quality of those. The flavor is lightly sweet, rich malts and the added complexity of the roasted nuts make for an easy drinking beer. The body is a little light for my tastes, but I had the first beer and couldnt keep myself from pouring a second. The beer is gone in no time and Im still wanting more.
