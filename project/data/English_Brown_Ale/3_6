I got a Turbodog, Purple Haze, couple Shock Tops, and a Cherry Chocolate beer. I refridgerated my Turbodog and angle/straight poured it into a 20 oz. mug. The head is incredible! Super retention, very foamy, bit of lacing. The smell was great, hints of chocolate malt, no cloying, bit of sweetness. It pours a very dark brown. I drank the first gulp...heaven. No over the top alcohol taste, despite it having a higher ABV than most beers. I felt no biting carbonation and the sweetness was not overpowering. I recommend Turbodog to everyone.

The taste is much more robust, with nice nutty notes and additions of caramel. There's a bit of carbonation on the mouthfeel, but it has an overall smooth mouthfeel and finish.

Just a little too dark for the season (early summer). I look forward to returning to this in the fall. Pretty much spot on for American dark brown ale. The closest thing I have mind to compare this to is Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald, but less roasty or bitter than GLEF, and much sweeter.","SaltofOH","Jun 14, 2014"

There's a nice caramel/chocolate/roast combination going on with a fairly high carbonation that makes Turbodog an easy drinker, but nothing made me too excited about it. I must say I'm shocked "the Bros." gave this a 90 rating, because it's almost the very definition of an average beer to my taste buds... hey, different strokes. I'd have it again if offered, but probably wouldn't buy it again. A pretty average brown ale that's not all-too satisfying. But hey, the price is right.","Alextricity","Jan 11, 2014"

Definitely some nice lacing here too. Smell is much more like a brown ale with some nice mellow malts, a little sweetness, and a tiny smell of hops but no bitterness. This is more malt forward too be sure on the nose. Taste is quite malty as in the nose with the sweetness I found in the nose but really nothing I can taste from the hop bill. This is just your basic brown ale. Mouthfeel is actually quite thick or more so than I expected. Overall this is an OK beer. I'm not a huge fan of brown ales so to be honest I might not be the best to rate this beer but it's not a bad beer, it's just not anything overwhelming in taste, smell, etc. Not a bad beer but nothing I would buy again. However this is close to style but just not anything special.","NeedBeerHere","Jan 02, 2014"

From the bottle to a pint glass out pours a dark brown ale with a mahogany hue. Swirling the tan head around the glass reveals a thin sticky lacing. A good inhale detects notes of a dark crystal malt in a brew of caramel, chocolate, dark fruits (kiwi, fig, prune or plum?) and a hops spice. The taste has a rich mouthfeel with a medium body. Dark-sticky-sweet malty caramel and chocolate flavors are dominant, with a light crisp hops bitterness that cleanses the pallet. To profile this English brown ale, it's not far off from today's stouts and porters, very similar to a Full Sail Session Black without the liquorice or a distant relative of Samuel Smith Nut Brown Ale, one that lives just down the road.","smokinyodas","Oct 27, 2013"

Pours a crystal clear dark brown with bodacious ruby highlights and a huge crop of fluffy tan head. Aromas of chocolate and caramel with a hint of earth and toffee. The flavor is a bit fruity with English yeasty esters dominating. Caramel toffee and chocolate maltiness off set with a hint of earthy hop flavor. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet slick creamy bubbly mouthfeel. I was worried that my palette may have changed in all these years, but this is actually a pretty good English style ale.","johnnnniee","Sep 20, 2013"

Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, chocolate, light roast, light nuttiness, herbal, and slight raisin. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malts. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, light nuttiness, roast, herbal, and slight raisin. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, light nuttiness, and brown sugar on the finish for a short bit. Very nice malt flavor balance that is fairly robust, with good complexity; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish.

When I returned, I was welcomed back to my seat by a wave of rich, caramel sweetness. Unfortunately, the wonderful sweetness somehow seemed to evaporate with the head, and my first deliberate smell of the beer yielded nothing but dull combination of mild lactose-like sweetness, some musty hops, and an afternote of dry cocoa. The flavor is marginally better but still sadly bland, with a light, sweet blend of milk chocolate and a mildest noticeable toffee character, although each characteristic seems to develop nicely as the beer warms. The texture is good enough, with a nice medium body that is lightened by a fine carbonation. Overall, although certainly drinkable, the superficial flavor profile leaves much to be desired.","devilben02","Jan 23, 2013"

Mild herbal and earthy hopping, mild nuttiness and bakers' chocolate. Not unpleasant, just not enough there. Taste: somewhat nutty and tannic (pecan seems closest), toffee, into an earthy and very slightly citric hopping with some vague fruitiness, then a fleeting hit of dark chocolate towards the finish. Body is light, feel is cottony, slick, and not terribly pleasant. At the end of the sip the pale malt base is almost the only thing left, which is disappointing, as there are some decent things going on here. Best by 3/13.","babaracas","Dec 29, 2012"

The body was a dark brown with moderate visible carbonation on it. The nose had notes of coffee (even Aly picked this up) and chocolate with a bit of roasted malts. The taste on the brew was almost exactly like the nose, except the coffee overwhelmed the other flavors a bit. The roasted malts and chocolate were detectable, but definitely took back seat to the coffee. The finish lingered with the coffee flavor. The body was moderately thin, decently carbonated and the alcohol was obviously on the lower end. As I sipped the beer, I may have gotten a hint of sweetness as well, but it was very difficult to detect. This was a very flavorful brown ale that I would definitely have again.","mgironta","Sep 16, 2012"

I detect toffee, cola, licorice, chocolate, coffee, and some bready qualities.

Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, milk chocolate, powdered chocolate, cream, and very subtle roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, milk chocolate, roasted malt, and cream. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. It was really nice what I found going on in the aroma in this one. However, I was disappointed with the flavor that I found as it was nowhere near as complex as the aroma. While the aroma was complex, it still wasn’t in the next tier for the style. Worth trying if you are in a pinch, but it wouldn’t be my first choice out at a bar.","thagr81us","Jul 06, 2012"

One thing to say about Abita in general...people in Louisian love their local brew.

I was so happy to be able to drink a local beer and always remembered it. When I saw it at the store this weekend, I picked it up and recalled that time. Unfortunately, this beer may have been sitting on the shelf a little longer than I would have hoped. It didn't taste as fresh as the first time I had it. Too bad. I remember loving it.

Nothing about this beer says "turbodog" to me, so I have no idea where that name came from, and, quite frankly, it's a pretty big turnoff. It sounds like some sort of alcoholic energy drink made to compete with Red Bull + vodka or something. Anyway, the twinge of hop bitterness here almost made me think I had a secret ESB on my hands, but layer after layer of malts suppresses it too much.

Drying chocolate malt is front and center giving it a character more in line with English Porter. Dark fruit and burnt sugar form the backbone while hops are mostly earthy and balance the malt evenly. The English Brown tag seems a bit off, but this a nice everyday drinker and great value.

Not the best-looking pint, dark brown with a cheap, fizzy head. Nose is slightly sweet, with solid chocolate notes. And Turbodog doesn’t hold the same mystique of flavor now, unfortunately, but the requirements for a solid Brown Ale do show up. Chocolate and a mild coffee bite, modest bitter finish with subtleties of mocha and hops. Thin texture hinders the malts; not my favorite anymore, but still worth the occasional roll in the hay.","DWilliams76","Jun 20, 2011"

Has good carbonation and a relatively thin mouthfeel. Really goes down easy and is a nice alterative to the BMC flowing around Bourbon Street. Not great, but decent and doable.

Pours a very pretty dark brown with reddish notes. Nice off-white head that produced some slight lacing, but lasted the whole glass. The scent of the beer is malt, some burnt sugar, light hops, and coffee. The taste of the beer mimics the nose---with a bit more nicely balanced bitterness---touch of sweetness. Malt is definitely dominate. I get nice coffee, cola, cocoa notes on the palate. All this being said, its a very easy drinking beer, one that even a lighter beer drinker may enjoy.

Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is roasted malt, toffee, bittersweet chocolate and some nuts and coffee. For the most part, the taste is just like the aroma except that there's a bit of hops noticable in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and smooth with good carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, it wouldn't be hard to drink a 6 pack of this. I'd buy this again in the future, I enjoyed it.

It pours a mostly clear dark brown topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, toffee, biscuit, grass, and light flowers. The taste starts out with a mild combo of toffee and biscuits, then strikes hard and fast with stronger-than-before grass, flowers, orange peel, and cedar. It's all a bit much, with the nicer malts getting drowned out by a blunt herbal bitterness. But, in its defense, things never get truly out of hand. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish.

For me, this is a difficult category, since I find that many of my favorite beers are very strongly flavored and only one or two max should be consumed at a time.

Plenty drinakable, near medium bodied, a tad lifeless but smooth and a little tingly on the tongue. I pick up some skunkiness with leafy-grass hop edges and a bit of chocolate perhaps but it's more toward the brown sugar in the final analysis.

There is a little bitterness in the finish. I can't taste much else, but as I said, it has been served way too cold. It has an above medium body and a good amount of carbonation.

The waitress told me it was a porter when she brought it and a good one at that. I was surprised to find that it's really an English Brown Ale. I enjoyed it overall. It looks and tastes very similar to a porter, but certainly has the drinkability and mouthfeel of an ale. Could be quite the neutral crowd-pleaser at a gathering of picky beer drinkers.","AndyAvalanche","Aug 29, 2009"

Drinkabilty is somewhat decent but doesnt have the burst of taste like the stronger ABV drinks do. However, the overall consumption is smoother with a nice chocolaty finish.

Although the good properties of the beer are the nice maltiness and the small bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, decent carbonation.

The label is not particularly intriguing, in fact there is nothing really to indicate you'd be drinking anything but an average beer. I didn't go in with respect for the beer, having prejudged it, and carelessly threw down a swig. I immediately realized my error. A delicious, sweet chocolaty taste that is far from overbearing, with a medium carbonation and moderate - but effective - aftertaste. Traditional malty smell but not particularly roasted.

The smell was strong and pleasant, and I could catch a whiff of it with the glass sitting on the table a few feet away. The taste was similar to the smell: a great mix of malts, which were simultaneously dark (chocolate), nutty, and sweet (toffee and brown sugar), plus a dash of hop bitterness to round it off and balance the flavor.

Extremely drinkable, definitely disappears before I'm ready to see it go. A flavorful quaffable easy drinking beer.

Some strands of lacing which gradually slid down the sides of the glass back into the brew. Nose is predominantly chocolate malt with perhaps a light floral hops aroma at the back. Taste consistent with nose, but chocolate is not as sweet as the nose insinuated; pleasantly bittersweet and earthy. Mouthfeel falls between light-and medium-bodied with a balanced amount of carbonation and a touch of bitterness at the finish to remind you what you just drank.

A sweet smell, like coffee, cocoa, caramel, honey, toffee...can't put my finger on it. Hint of hop spice too. A tad syrupy as it passed my tongue, but I'd still say it had a strong, medium body that wasn't overpowering and had some mild sweetness in it. Definitely some chocolate and a hint of coffee/roasted malt for a semi-dry backbite, although the backbite also had a little fruitiness to it.

The nose and taste follow suit: it doesn't have a ton of flavor or aroma but what is there is choclatey and malty. The taste is sort of dark/bitter, dry chocolatey and has malty notes, the hop balances this off though and keeps it from approaching the too-sweet range, though the hops used aren't anything known for writing home about. The mouth is pretty moderate with a good amount of carbonation and you really notice the bitter chocolate in the aftertaste. Drinkability is just a bit above average, it's def. not bad, but doesn't really make you want to drink more. The restraint on the chocolate and sweetness is really it's most impressive point.","BirdFlu","Aug 15, 2008"

Some light roasted malt and a hint of chocolate, a touch smokey/woody. The feel is fairly light and quite fizzy, reminds me of carbonated water; the brew finishes quite neutral and balanced.

Had no inclination as to what kind of style it was, so I was essentially flying blind into this one. Poured a nice deep hazelnut brown with a very fluffy and frothy off white colored head that grew to a height of around two inches or so. A gradual fade left behind some nice side glass lace as well as a touch of frothy stuff over the top. It was somewhat cloudy, obscuring most of the view of the interior. Smell was interesting. I definitely picked up a hop presence, some touches of orange and grapefruit, however they were very light and were mostly overpowered by a sugary caramel aroma. Lots of malt here with even a slightly noticeable roasted nut aroma. The taste followed suit nicely for a light brown ale. Main backbone consisted of earthy grain type flavors that were lightened up with a healthy dose of sugar. There was definitely some nice hops added in as there was a good little bite to it in the front and it gave a nice long drawn out finish. Great feel as there was more then ample carbonation in this one and it hung around until the very end. No slickness and a good medium to light body. An excellent session ale, it was neither overpowering nor too light to be noticed. Overall I actually thought this was rather nice. It was pretty much a nice normal light brown ale that had some hops thrown in for balance only, but stayed pretty much true to its roots. This was an excellent little brew and I would surely have one again. Would probably be top notch on tap and I will need to find that out one day. But definitely a good call and one you should try.","mikesgroove","Oct 16, 2007"

The taste was also strong on toffee and chocolate with plenty of black malt present as well. This beer is almost on the borderline between a porter and a brown ale.

The most noticable taste seems to be that of the alcohol. Not bad, but I expected a little more flavor from this brown ale. That being said, it is not too heavy in the mouth and not too light.

An almost scotch ale like aroma. Comes across as American - not like the classic British renditions. The combination of malts make for a rough ended flavour. Non too harmonious in the least. A coca-cola like character. Initially sticky mouthfeel, fades with the use of spring water. The alt yeast comes through on the finish and leaves a lingering distinctness from the initial flavour impressions. The flavours hold together quite well, but just don't blend as a medley... more of high school garage band practice. I appreciate the makeup, smart work but a dis-satisfying result.

Nice hop finish with the Williamette being a good choice for this ale. A more citric/flowery variety would have detracted from the above flavor components. Drinkability enhanced by the smoothness of this ale....a distinct slider...

Some brown ales are just a bit too sweet or too much, this one is a nice light crispy tasting mix of chocolate and toffee wheat without being sticky or boggy. It's refreshing, and that's not something you can say of a brown ale very often. The mouthfeel is pretty average for a brown ale, but is absolutely nothing to complain about.

Taste is mellow, but dominated by roast, to the point of the beer being more a porter than a brown. An enjoyable bitterness, though. Mouth is medium, with low carbonation lend a nice smoothness.

Probably my favorite of the Abita mix case so far.","ski271","Jun 02, 2006"

But take what I just said and taint and water it down a lot. The taste was of burnt toast mixed with a Dickens style grool. Please sir, I don't want some more. I shouldn't say that.

The beer is dark brown which has some redish highlights when held to the light. Malt, the slightest hint of chocolate, some roasted nut sweetness, and the smallest drop of some hops were in the nose. The first part of the taste of this beer is some sweetness followed by some nutty chocolate flavors and finishes with a small amount of hop bitterness at the end. The aftertaste is slightly sweet. Very little carbonation is in this beer. I really wanted to love this beer, but as it has been said by previous reviewers, it lacks some excitement that would change it from good to great.

The smell of of slightly sweet malt, and just a hint of hops....very faint smell....nothing that really stood out, but good none the less. The first taste to hit your tongue is of malt (chocolate, and maybe toffee or Carmel malts too) Lightly hoped in the body. The after taste is what does it for me....a nice dark chocolatey after taste that is slightly bitter. Mouthfeel:is thick, and wonderful....the light hops mellows the malt and makes it easy to drink.

As with the aroma, the hop presence is almost undetectable. This beer is medium bodied. It is carbonated well and goes down smooth. The taste leaves a lot to be desired from an English Brown.

The body and mouthfeel are appropriate for a nut brown, but the roasted flavors are more akin to a stout (albeit a light one) and it is quite clean, almost lager-like. It pours a dark, dark mahogany with a thin off-white head. The smell is strong with dark roasted malts and it also has that quality I can only describe as "beery". Roasted malt dominates the palate but comes with some light toffee sweetness. Mildly spicy hops are noticeable but never come to the foreground. A bit thin and watery. Not an exceptional brew, but exceptional in its originality. This would make an excellent dark summertime session brew and would pair very well with spicy food.","johnrobe","Jan 23, 2004"

Pour was very pretty with a deep brown bordering on opaque with splashes of scarlet around the bottom with a odd grey tan head that unfortunately did not last too long. Smell was sweet with caramel and roasted grains with a slight dose of butterscotch underneath. The taste was very odd as each time I sipped it it started with the sensation that it was liquified sushi rice. This morphed into a grainier more brown ale style with some coffee hints in the undertow, but the rice flavor never really subsided. There was just a little bitterness hidden in the aftertaste, but no where near overpowering. Went well with my bbq, but not a beer to write home about.","GreatPondBrewer","Oct 21, 2003"

I wanted this beer to taste like that the whole way through. If it would have this would be a whopper of a drinker. Its still very drinkable, a bit on the light side on the body, but I just can't get by that start.

Decent aroma and solid drinkability make this beer a refreshing choice with some spicy grub ro just for the heck of it!  Bottoms up!","goindownsouth","Jun 21, 2002"
3.61,-1.1,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Turbodog:  at the very least, I like the name.  For a brown ale, it’s as black a beer as I’ve seen lately.  Very nice rich head, clinging to the side the whole way down.  Strong malt (burnt/chocolate tastes).  Nice hints of licorice in the first taste, and throughout the aftertaste, although there are slight hints of grain as well.  Very nice.","jackndan","Jun 08, 2002"
4.23,15.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"On draft...... Deep dark brown, nearly black color, with a marshmellow soft tan head. Served in a skiny pilsner glass.  Deep roasted chocolate malt smell, some toffee in there as well. Tasted actually very sweet, chocholate, smooth, and creamy. Pleasant surprise, when the bartender sensed my interest and brought me a bottle to read the label. Nice touch ! Went down very easily and complimented the overpriced food rather nicely. I will definitly order this on tap, if I see it again.","StevieW","Jun 07, 2002"
4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a deep amber brown with a lavish tan head, lots of sticky lace.  Strong malt aroma with fruit and bittersweet chocolate.  The malt flavors form the foundation for this beer, but notes of toffee and chocolate are present as well, and towards the finish there are mild hops and hints of fruit.  An absolutely glorious brown ale.","Pegasus","Jun 04, 2002"
4.34,18.9,3.5,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"An excellent microbrew. I think of Turbo Dog as a specialty brew, because it really does not conform to any particular style. Chocolatey, toffeish and definitely malty; I can drink this stuff with just about anything. It does not have any outstanding negatives in my mind.  Definitely worth getting if you can get it fresh.","EagleTalon","Jun 02, 2002"
4.1,12.3,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a deep brown with a wispy off white head. The bartender was not sure exactly what style it was and my first impression was a porter/brown ale hybrid. A bit sweeter and thicker than your typical brown ale, but not as full bodied as a porter. Roasted malts leave some caramel on the palate, with enough hop complexity to balance the brew nicely. This beer was new to me and I had to judge it with no background. A brown ale but a hefty one.","QXSTER1","May 25, 2002"
3,-17.8,3,3,3,3,3,"The beer is a dark ruby with a nice tight beige head.  Musty smell.  Not bad though.  Taste consists of an obscure roasted flavor.  A bit of chocolate.  And small hop bite.  Medium body.  A bit of an eccentric brown.  Not bad but not good either.","Bighuge","May 15, 2002"
3.98,9,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"A very nice brown ale, especially when in New Orleans! Medium to deep translucent brown, with a slight off-white head. Faint chocolate and toffee aromas. Taste is mildly sweet, with hints of chocolate and toffee. Some bready flavors as well. Finish is slightly bitter, but not overwhelmingly so. Not a heavy beer by any means, this is actually quite refreshing and drinkable.","mophie","May 09, 2002"
2.88,-21.1,3.5,3,2.5,4.5,2.5,"I had this brew in Boston from the bottle.  It was harsh and not what I would call a quality brew.  It might have been old considering the source and location, but the whole sixer had the same qualities.","beernut7","May 02, 2002"
3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Light brown in color and very clear.  The dense persistent off - white head leaves Belgian lace down the glass. Slight buttery and caramelly notes along w/ mild chocolate malt notes make for a pleasant aroma.  The relatively low carbonation level for style facilitates the smooth mouthfeel.  Dextrinous and medium bodied. Chocolate, diacetyl butterscotch and crystal malt sweetness are the dominate flavor components, but hop bitterness provides sufficient balance.  The mildly earthy and slightly spicy Willamette hop flavor is quite welcome.  Turbo Dog finishes w/ a touch of roasted grain bitterness and sweetness.  It's been ages since I've had this brew.  Definitely better than a lot of American browns out there.  It was a nice surprise.","marc77","Apr 28, 2002"

4.1,12.3,4,4,4,5,4,"Beautiful and dark.  A rich pouring beer, pleanty of head.  Looks more like a dark lager, but aromas suggest otherwise.  Nice dark chocolate and malt- both in the aroma and the taste.  Not too sweet, but rich and warming, definetely dark brown sugar.  Overall a wonderful beer.","AaronRed","Oct 03, 2001"
