Flavor is very subtle and laid back, reminds me of a homebrew with a bit of a twang and slight oxidation note of cardboard. Not bad but not good either. No real fresh malt or hops evident. Balanced bitter and sweet so another plus for being on style. Mouthfeel is light and CO2 is appropriately restrained. Overall a boring brown, drinkable but not exciting in the least. Think Southern Pecan without the pecans. Beats a Newcastle, though!","EagleTalon","Feb 24, 2014"

This was a medium bodied brown with a balanced flavor and slender body that was certainly worth trying but not something I'd probably get much if it was available in my area. The honey and clove in the nose translate well into the taste and the hops are just noticeable enough to give it some character. I was a little disappointed with the thin texture.

Taste pretty darn good. Im a fan of brown ales and I think brewing this one with honey was a great addition. The carbonation is on point and has a great mouthfeel. The taste of honey is present all throughout the entire experience. Way to go Back Forty !! An overall great brewery from Gadsen, AL","Pantyologist","Apr 02, 2012"

3,-14.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours more of very dark amber than brown, with a fairly creamy off-white head that fades after a few minutes. Lightly hoppy in the nose, with some herbal notes. A touch of sour graininess, and a a very, very light roasty note, end with a bit of honeyed sweetness. Not a very robust brown. The taste is similar, with not enough body or roastiness, but a thin slightly sour graininess and some late sweetness substituting for those flavors. A slight herbal hoppiness helps things a bit. Too thin, too sour, not enough bite, or lacking that, roastiness. Even some honest maltiness would be welcome here. Fairly pedestrian.","Georgiabeer","Jun 24, 2011"

3.25,-7.1,3,3,3.5,2.5,3.5,"Had this on tap recently at Dram Whiskey Bar in Mountain Brook Village. Nice brown, coppery color. No discernable head whatsoever. Could have been the bartender not pouring out of the tap correctly. Notes of toffee and slightly nutty in the aroma. Taste was good, but nothing to write home about. I tasted a slight nuttiness, along with biscuity malt. Not much of a hope presence, which is understandable in this style. Slightly sweet, which may be due to the honey. Overall, I would drink this again as a good, sessionable, local brew.","Bamabrew22","0"
3.3,-5.7,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Beer is thin and mildly sweet with a toffee like finish to it. A little cidery, mildly bitter the more I drink, the second was better than the first the third was the same as the second. Overall, it's light and easy drinking. Nothing to see here though, an average brown.","drabmuh","Feb 14, 2011"
4.08,16.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"The aroma is sweet malts, hints of roast, and honey. Low hop profile. The taste follows the nose with a mild sweet malt, slightly watery, hints of earthy hops, sweet honey, faint chocolate note, light toast, and a hint of roasted malt. Quite nutty. Creamy but light texture. Refreshing and easy to drink. Quite sessionable.","JayS2629","Jan 31, 2011"
3,-14.3,3,3,3,3,3,"Clean tasting beer with a nutty, slight roastiness to it. Just a hint of caramel sweetness in the flavor and a bit of bitterness making it a nicely balanced brown ale. Not a ton of unique character, and no trace of honey, but a drinkable brown ale that could be sessionable.","mklinger","Jan 27, 2011"
3.55,1.4,2,4.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"D - Overall a pretty good brown ale. The flavor is good and it goes down smooth, but it could look a bit better and I would prefer if it weren't so light bodied.","SuperSpy","Jan 22, 2011"
3.44,-1.7,3.5,4.5,3,3.5,3,"I guess this is being brewed by Lazy Magnolia at the moment, so perhaps they'll tweak the recipe a bit if/when they end up brewing in B'Ham. Also, while I like LM's beers, consistency hasn't exactly been one of their hallmarks.","Domingo","Nov 30, 2010"
3.69,5.4,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Fairly easy to put away, overall tasty, not too sweet or filling, and a surprisingly decent rendition of a brown.","EgadBananas","Nov 25, 2010"

4.25,21.4,4,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"This is an excellent beer from a very small brewery. The added honey makes a unique twist that is characteristic to the beer. It is hard to find, but if you see it you need to try it.","hangh","Beers"
3.98,13.7,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"This light-bodied, sweet brown ale is easy to drink in one session. Its color is a thin brown, close to amber. The smell is non-obtrusive, but not revealing either. The taste is light, and sweet with a bit of nuttiness. Brewed with local wildflower honey, so it's good for my allergies. :) I'm glad to see another style from Back 40, as the pale ale is such a tough category to start in. I have enjoyed this 6-pack enough to have finished it in two days! Congrats to Back 40!","reeverbythespeak","0"
