I can smell chocolate,caramel, and earthy hops.  The flavor is very subtle notes of caramel and chocolate.  I don't taste the hops I could lightly smell.

I had this beer many years ago in Milwaukee and seem to remember it as more coffee-like in taste, but that was almost 6 years ago now and my palate has changed.  I'm still enjoying all the roasted malt flavors though.  Went well with food (stuffed shells with cheese and butternut squash) and I would not mind having another one, but sadly I only have the one bottle.  A very good brown ale.","damndirtyape","Jan 03, 2015"

It would be hard to argue against that decision, but I hope this makes an appearance as a seasonal, if that in fact turns out to be true. This is really tasty brown.

Aroma is consistent with caramel malt, along with some mild hops. Taste is also mild, consisting of caramel and nuts, with just enough hops to balance things out. This makes for a very drinkable yet unremarkable brew. I think I would have enjoyed it much more if everything about it was more concentrated--bolder flavors, thicker body, etc. As it is, it makes for a suitable session beer, but nothing to write home about.","MaximalC","Jul 28, 2012"

A mild nuttiness covers most of every other aroma, with only a slight caramel and bready malt presence noticeable. A malty sweetness begins and grows throughout, with hints of coffee and nutty flavors cutting through the sweetness. Medium-full in body, this English Brown Ale is also higher in carbonation.

Nice looking beer. The aroma is fairly complex for most brown ales. Up front notes of sweet caramel, toasted breads and just a hint of roasted nuts. Underneath all that is just a bit of sweet cherry. As it warms the cherry comes through a bit more and just a hint of chocolate. The flavor is much the same. The cherry and sweet fruits is just a bit more pronounced. Roasted nuts and toasted bread. This is a tasty beer. The mouthfeel is about perfect for the style. There is a nice creamy smoothness at the front part of the mouthfeel and it finishes fairly dry. Just about perfect. Overall this is a fantastic beer. New Glarus hits more home runs then any other brewery in my opinion.

The mouthfeel is outstanding. Surprising, I thought it was going to be similar to the Belgian Red, but I was wrong. Very smooth. I really don't know how a brown can get much better.

The nose comprises fish batter (LJS-style, seemingly), toffee, buttery biscuits, and some light orange zest. The taste holds notes of light walnut, light toffee, light orange peel, and some blackened biscuits. The body is a light medium (or heavy light), with a moderate carbonation and a sorta grainy feel. Overall, nothing overtly special, but a decent enough nut brown. A nice end to one helluva weekend ride.","TMoney2591","Sep 19, 2010"
3.75,-1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Was able to pick this up during the weekend in the Northwoods. It pours a brownish orange with light fading white foam. The smell is of malt and hazelnuts along with roasted caramel and hints of orange zest. The taste isn't too far off from the smell, but it is far less complex. The caramel malt is the main flavor and the roasted malt gives it a slight bitterness. The problem is I wouldn't go as far to say that it is a Nut Brown, as the label claims. I honestly don't taste the nuttiness that I was promised. There is also a souring from what I assume to be the hops. The carbonation seems a little weak to me, but it's not too bad. If you ignore the fact that it's supposed to be nutty it's a nice solid brown ale.","Vdubb86","Sep 19, 2010"

In keeping with the style, none of the flavors is particularly strong, but the balance is impressive, making this an extremely drinkable beer.","chicagobeerriot","Jan 09, 2010"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Pale brown and cloudy. It has a clean malty aroma. The two flavors are a roasted malt and a hop bite. Both tastes are very subtle and seem to flip flop. Fat squirrel is creamy and very easy drinking. This was my first New Glarus after reading about them and wondering how I could get a few for quite a while. I would drink this beer again and can't wait to try the others. Thanks to Nick and his Father-in-Law for bringing these back from Wisconsin and sharing them.","confer","Jan 01, 2010"

3.6,-5,4.5,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A nice medium pour yielded a small head that disappeared, but there was some really nice lacing around the rim of the glass as I drank. Great brown coloring. I'm not sure if it was the way I held it or what, but it appeared to be a bit darker at the top then it was at the bottom. This had a strong cider smell to it with just a hint of sweet malt. Very good appearance and smell overall. The flavor, unfortunately, was just so-so. It had a nutty, earthy flavor to it that was just a little heavy in the mouth. There was just a bit of an alcohol bite to it that seemed to grow the more I drank. At first, I thought that the alcohol flavor may have been a bit too much to have more than just one or two at dinner, but by the time I was towards the bottom of the glass I was ready for more, so the drinkability was higher then my initial thought.","billyzoom666","Dec 28, 2009"

Quite dull, not much other than malt in the nose. Starts off with a smooth chocolate like malt then a woody like flavor follows. Towards the end a bitter nut like flavor emerges that seems to come from the hops. Light to medium smooth body with little carbonation. Enjoyable beer.

Some tannins may appear in the end, tough to say as the carbonation rises a bit. The aftertaste is rich chocolate and gentle acrid carbonation sting on my tongue. While this beer is not complex, it sure is tasty. As I progress down the beer, what I thought was tannin is seeming as almost a roasted grain. Not quite coffee-like, but it's bot a bit of the burny quality about it. Mouthfeel is medium and the beer doesn't hang around long in the mouth. Moderate carbonation, perhaps a bit more than I'd like.","mentor","Aug 15, 2005"
3.75,-1.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Opinion: This really isn't too bad of a beer. I like the flavor, but I think that it is a bit on the assertive side for this style as I mentioned. It tastes a bit more like a London Porter than a Northern English Brown Ale.","SkeeterHawk","Aug 02, 2005"
3.67,-3.2,2.5,3,4,4,4,"Flavor is suprisingly robust for the color. The dark malts show up much better on the tongue than they do to the eye. Some astringency, but not enough to detract significantly.","bubrewer","Jul 30, 2005"
3.98,5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Pours a beautiful fiery dark amber color. Head was mearly a coating of foamy white, a little disappointing, but the color is still gorgeous. Smells of sweet malt, with some diacetyl sour butteriness and a hint of nuttiness. Not outstanding, but nice. Taste is much of the same, sweet, grainy malts, some hop bitterness to balance, with diacetyl and nutty notes to round it off. Mouthfeel is smooth, with fairly high carbonation that makes it refreshing. Drinkability is phenomenal, definitely a session beer I could drink all night. A solid nut brown, and probably my favorite beer from New Glarus, sorry to all you Spotted Cow fans out there.","Golden2wenty1","Jul 27, 2005"

3.91,3.2,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: Very good for a brown. I would happily drink this beer into my own oblivion. The sharp, bitter aftertaste, my least favorite character of the beer, would probably be considered a positive by many people on this site. The least interesting part of the beer was its scent (""odor"" sounds like feet). New Glarus is badass.","battlekow","Jun 21, 2005"
4.12,8.7,3,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer pours out a thin light brown. The aroma is malty and slightly chocolatey, but a little thin. My hopes were not high as I took the first sip. I was suprised, because this beer is pretty good. Malt, chocolate, and nut flavors. Just a bit of hop flavor. Although the beer appears thin, the taste is not weak. Very nice drinkability. This is probably one of the tastiest brown ales I've had.","beveragecaptain","Jun 18, 2005"
3.35,-11.6,3,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel had a chewy, medium body that was creamier than most nut brown ales I've tried in the past. Easily a drinkable brew, but there's plenty of others I'd choose first...just a bit too uninspiring to make me come back for more.","orbitalr0x","Jun 02, 2005"
3.77,-0.5,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Very light color for an EBA, light brown, clear body. Head is creamy and thick, tan in color. Smell is nutty, slightly sweet, and backed bylight floral hops. Taste is sweet and nutty, creamy and somewhat chocolatey. Hops are present, but are always in the background.. Mouthfeel isn't very well carbonated, and could use some more. I like the beer, a good EBA, if not a little too normal.","TastyTaste","Apr 19, 2005"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"This bottle is not bad, but different from most others I've had, which is many. The difference is the hops. They are much more pronounced than usual. I am a hop head, so this isn't a major problem. But, I drank a nut brown tonight because I was in the mood for a nut brown tonight. Oh well. So one batch is a bit different from another. Who gives a shit? This is still quite good.","GIVEMEBACKMYSON","Jan 21, 2005"

3.83,1.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours a brown color with almost no head and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma is very sweet. No nutty tones here, just sweetness. The flavor has some toasted malts and caramel with a bit of hop. This is lacking what I want from a nut brown ale. I really wasn't impressed with this. Drinkability is good and the body is ok.","clvand0","Jan 04, 2005"
4.06,7.1,4,3,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer pours a slightly brown amber color with no head and a slight ring over the beer. The nose is not what I expect from a nut brown or english brown ale. Lots of sweetness that I can't place. The flavor is better than what the nose would say. Good roasted malt with a nice nutty and roasted coffee flavor, Nice nice nice. The feel is right at moderate, maybe a bit more. Drinkability is also very nice. Another solid beer from New Glarus.","kmpitz2","Dec 31, 2004"
4.1,8.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Fat Squirrel pours a beautiful, subtly hazy (it's bottle-conditioned), light chestnut body with a crimson cast and glowing orange highlights. The frothy ivory head receeds to a thin layer of cream; and it leaves some nice, albeit it mainly transient, lace with each sip. The nose is loaded with toasty malt and welcomes you to take a sip! It's delicately zesty on the tongue due to it's very fine-bubbled, natural carbonation. The body is medium; and it becomes a bit creamier as it warms. Toasty and slightly nutty malt carries through the flavor from start to finish with some delicate, floral and mildly spicy hops appearing towards the finish. It's solid bitterness ushers in a dry finish; and toasted malt lingers gently in its long aftertaste with the occassional appearance of some floral and piney hops. Enjoy this one at just below cellar temperatures to get the most out of it.","NeroFiddled","Dec 26, 2004"
3.92,3.4,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Fat Squirrel is a well-crafted brown ale that (unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned) tastes more like coffee than anything else. It isn't overpowering however, and although I would never buy it on a regular basis, it was fine as long as the bottle lasted. Another good New Glarus beer for which I have Skidz to thank.","BuckeyeNation","Dec 14, 2004"
4.2,10.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"This poured with a big, tan-colored head that gave off a malty, nutty (think hazelnut) scent on the nose. The head quickly subsided, but it left behind a light amber beer. The first sip revealed a very sweet, very nutty flavor. It had a medium mouthfeel, but gave a great lingering, nutty aftertaste. I found it to be a great accompaniment to a meal of WI brats.","woodychandler","Aug 22, 2004"

3.85,1.6,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"12oz. bottle: This beer pours a fairly clear amber color with an off-white head. It didn't linger for long. The aroma is caramel malty with some roastiness. A bit nutty also.

4.19,10.6,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Brown and hazy, greenish head of rounded 1/2 inch foam. Laces in primary rings. Sweet malty aroma, almost a sugary pecan pie sense with caramel and associated ""pie crust"" biscuity qualities. Body is shy of medium, with moderate carbonation. Maltiness strikes first, and follows the aroma note-for-note, just a little sweeter than Schell Snowstorm 2003. Finishes softly, with slight hop, but more of the crusty breadiness lingering into the aftertaste. This beer is entirely pleasant and perfect for a drinking session.","ADR","Nov 23, 2003"

4.38,15.6,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"And I though I was impressed with the Native Ale(brown) but this is a solid beer all around. Nice light syrup brown with a amber tone to its slightly hazy color, tall one inch cream colored head that recedes slowly to a thin skim always present and thin whispy web stings and patches. Aroma is dry and woodish, slightly sweet and roasty with a nice overlay of nuttyness, hazel and almond I make out pretty well but I believe there is more here then I'm cable of putting my nose to. But its a pretty nice whiffer either way you put it. Nice taster too, flavor is mild but stays long of a nice little roasty maltyness with some nutty factions of almond candybar and hazelnut. A super fine drying quality just keeps sitting there on your palate which is quite extraordinary. The dryness produces a nice little wood-like dryness with a small bready fluffyness thats really nice. Solid medium body, bold, nearly full in the middle, lightly creamy in a way near the finish along with all the nice little drying qualities, which I'm really digging about this beer. Subtle but flavorful with lots of things going for it. Another New Glarus winner! A session beer all the way! Glad to have picked this up at Ciccone's, my new favorite place to venture on Sundays.","tavernjef","Oct 28, 2003"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Smells roasted and nutty. Taste is very subdued roasted and nutty with some caramel. The best thing about this is that the roasted and nutty flavors are subdued. Often nut browns provide too much of these flavors. My first New Glarus experience. Not blown away but a very nice example of a style I don't particularly like. The subtleness of the beer is very much appreciated.","mjohn27603","Aug 28, 2003"

4.3,13.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The beer is a dulled, hazy copper-brown color. A medium sized airy white head sits on top and sticks around for the duration. Rings are left on the glass for viewing pleasure. The aroma is pretty damn good for a brown. Roasted nut, toasted malt and cocoa are the domineering players. The mouthfeel is so creamy and nice. Body of about medium. Toasted malt comes to the forefront on the palete. Also a subdued roasted bitterness. A little bready yeasty touch is a appealing. And the nutty tones comes to play as well. This is really a pleasurable brown ale to consume. The epitome of a session beer.","Bighuge","Jun 09, 2003"

4.07,7.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This bottle conditioned unfiltered nut brown ale pours a slightly hazy caramel-copper color in appearance. The head is a fluffy off-white, light tan color. Decent carbonation apparent. Tantalizing aroma consists of caramel malt, roasted nuts and a touch of oak. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and somewhat fizzy. The taste has a nice rich roasted malt flavor in combination with a delicious toasted nuttiness. Midtones consist of melted caramel in addition to an almost pumpkin pie crusty goodness. More sweet caramel follows with a dusty oaken finish. Slight hop bitterness lingers. This is a must have for brown ale fans. Another excellent offering from New Glarus.","Winter","May 17, 2003"
