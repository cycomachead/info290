Pours lightly hazy deep ruby brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of raisin, plum, prune, fig, caramel, toast, molasses, biscuit, brown bread, herbal, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of raisin, plum, prune, apple, caramel, toast, biscuit, brown bread, molasses, light nuttiness, light chocolate, herbal, and toasted earthiness. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, prune, apple, caramel, molasses, toast, biscuit, brown bread, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with great robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice english brown ale. Good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 13, 2014"

3.21,-6.4,2.5,4,3,3,3,"Close to no head, just a think layer of light brownish tan across the surface, swiftly gone, virtually zero lacing as well. The liquid is murky enough to achieve opacity, otherwise some brightness to the reddish brown color, some lighter orange tones further out, only the merest trace of bubbles. The nose emphasizes soft sweetness in the form of caramel, molasses, brown sugar, roasted nuts and soda bread, some carob and cinnamon like spices too, no real fruit or citrus presence, you get more oats and general grains as it warms. In the mouth it’s full-bodied, somewhat bottom heavy, paucity of carbonation does not help this situation, just sort of lays there until it suddenly loses weight through the finish, ends short. More bitter dark chocolate and cocoa here, hints at a sort of burnt quality. There are softening vanilla, hazelnut, caramel, toffee, nutmeg, creamed coffee and some cola bean notes as well as that soft baked dessert goods quality. Given the general sweetness of the flavors curious how texturally dry it is. Nothing which meaningfully bespeaks the presence of hops. Flavorful, can’t say there’s anything wrong with it per se but you forget you’re even holding a half full glass, not a good sign.","farrago","Dec 09, 2012"

The flavor is a disappointment for me as it just seems to be very empty. Sweetness, caramel with a light touch of chocolate but that seems to be about it.

This one reminds me more of a porter, it's drinkable, but wished it were more deep and complex like many of their other beers.

There are only minor discernible notes of spice in this beer, but those that are present work well with the caramel malts to create subtle complexity. The roasted finish is well balanced by light hopping and is dry enough to keep the beer drinkable without making it taste like scorched toast.

Notes of molasses and spices throughout. Comes off as a Poter-lite. I can't say I look forward to this each winter, but it doesn't turn me off.

Nose is interesting. I get notes of caramel, chocolate and a light cardboardyness. Its a little light and not really reaching out and grabbing me. Flavor is chocolatey and nutty with a caramel and slightly fruity aftertaste. The aftertaste comes across chocolate and fruity. I've never been a fan of fruit and chocolate, and that keeps me from enjoying this more. Feel is on the light end of moderate, with a lighter carbonation that breaks things up just enough to keep this from being still. This one is okay.

Its medium body combines with a very fine carbonation to produce a mouthfeel that's lightly creamy and smooth. The flavor expresses a gently fruity and toffee-ish malt with a soft touch of chocolate and a mild roasty edge that's infused with earthy hop flavors.
