"On tap. 2nd favorite brew from this establishment. Pours brown with a tan clingy head. All malt and caramel in the nose. Flavors are the same – sweet, smooth malty goodness with a characteristic common to most of their brews that (others have noted maple) really works for me. Finish leaves me wanting more. This is what I pick for a growler to go."

"carbonation distracts from the malts, but room temperature brings out some nice dark flavors; the sweet finish is also compromised by the carbonation; still tasty and could grow on a person"

"O - I really enjoyed this. It is a bit lighter than I tend to prefer but it's very drinkable. Definitely a good barbecue beer."
""

"This is a nice easy clean drinkable brown ale, very easy to drink and interesting flavor, the lower alcohol makes this a very nice session beer."

"This is my favorite brown ale. I hope I can get up to Lincoln for the beer fest at the end of June and pick up some more Pig's Ear! So if you go, leave a few behind please!"

"This is just a solid brown ale. It's obviously no where near Rouge's Hazelnut Bron Nectar, but still a very enjoyable brew. Supper cheap in the New England area. I'd recommend it anyone that lives in New England for sure! Nothing about the Pig's Ear Brown is real off-putting."

"My pour got me a finger of fizzy, light-brown head with moderate retention. Color was a deep brown with ruby/garnet highlights. Nose was quite malty, reminiscent of something that eluded me, but perhaps it will come. Did I sense a slight buttery quality? I usually have a blind spot when it comes to diacetyl, so I may be mistaken. Plus, I really do not mind such a flavor. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was much more chocolaty than I had experienced on the nose. It had a powdery taste, like Hershey's Cocoa Powder right out of the tin and into the mouth. Do they even make that any more? I knew precisely where it was stored in my maternal grandmother's house and used to love it straight as a child. I sprinkled it on peanut butter to make a phenomenal sandwich. That's what the nose reminded me of - Ovaltine! Great Gar, but this beer really takes me back. I saw where Newcastle Brown is the standard bearer for the style, but this is drier than that. The finish was semi-sweet with the yeast having converted most of the fermentable sugar to alcohol. I was very impressed by this little piggy."

"This may be my favorite brown ale. Poured a 2"" beige head with long life. The body is a deep burnt umber brown and held to the light it's a clear lively maroon. Nice light smell of roasted malt. Taste matches the smell, richer than I expected, buttery and with some bitter hops coming through. Finish us a little sweet."
"Pours a dark clear reddish brown color with a huge bubbly tan head that slowly recedes before leaving some spotty lace on the way down. Smells of caramel and brown sugar with a hint of tart fruit, earth, roast and butter. The flavor is heavy on the caramel and butterscotch with an earthy hop bite that provides some balance. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a creamy bubbly mouthfeel. So far this is the only brew I've had where I feel the diacytyl actually adds something to the beer. This is probably my favorite beer from Woodstock, but its still just an average beer."

"This is medium bodied with crisp carbonation. I would get this again for sure."

"Overall its a nice beer, all around style, nice malts, decent hops with a nice bitter kick, very drinkable. Perfect beer for almost any weather, and always a good beer to grab a pint of at a bar."
"O: overall not bad would drink again but there Are better brown ales out there."
"O/D-A nice little brown ale. Will not wow you, but I drank my glass very quickly. I love the nutty aspect of this brew. A decent sip."
"From the 12 fl.oz. bottle. Sampled on February 28, 2012. The pour is mahogany brown with a conspicuous amount of foamy, long lasting head. The aroma is subtle but it has a nutty malted quality as well as sweet. The body is smooth. The taste is higher on the bitterness than in the aroma with a sharp lingering hop note. This is one of those beers that I drink a lot and I am surprised that it took so long for me to review it."

"O - Overall this beer makes a great impression. It is flavorful and drinkable while being very low in alcohol content, allowing to you have pint after pint. One of the better beers in the 4.3% category I have had."
"I bet this would go great with a nice burger."

"Poured from a 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. Dark chestnut colored body. Thin white head, with a look of creaminess in composition. Somewhat soapy hop aroma, which caught my attention in a bad way. Taste was on the good side though. Very malty, bready, and hearty. Very tiny bit of English hops in the background. Quite a smooth mouthfeel, which was the standout character of this beer. Low abv made this a very easy beer to drink. Pig's Ear is a no-nonsense brown ale that gives you what you want from a brown ale: flavor and drinkability."
"D: A sweeter and darker brown. Nice, fairly character malt base with plentiful accent notes. Makes for a good, well-rounded, and flavorful brown. Good drinking especially on a fall day. Almost rich enough to have a holiday feel, but with an easy abv."
"Standard brown ale, appeasing, tasty and good looking. Sits well after a good meal goes well with a steak or some other kind of grilled meat. Originally bought a case from the Woodstock Inn Brewery and went through it in a day with the roommates we enjoyed it so much. It's a very neutral tasting beer that can be drunk at anytime, the makers succeeded in making a great brown. A good addition to anyone's collection or ""To Drink List"" for the week."

"Mouth feel is a bit unique. The nutty flavor and feeling lasts forever, and that is definitely the highlight of it. Not the best, but a really good session beer."
"O - Very good brown ale that I highly recommend if you can find it."
"O: There's a decent amount of flavor in this beer for the abv. I really wish I liked this beer more."
"Overall a good brown ale that has good balance"
"Draught @ Infinity Bistro: This one pours a clear, dark mahogany brown color. There was a very small off white head that left some lacing. It has a nice aroma. Caramel malt, molasses, faint nuttiness and a hint of roast. The taste is good. Nutty, dry, faint roastiness. Nice malt body. An easy drinker."
"Overall quite refreshing for a brown ale, and one I could easily have again some other time."
"6. I wish I could get this locally, I would defiantly put it in the rotation of session beers. Got this from a friend that is in a beer of the month club. Great offering..."
"D-0verall this was just ok. Had alittle too much sweetness and not much going on in this brown ale. Was hoping for alittle bit more."
"All in all, a solid brown ale. I particularly enjoy the vanilla undertones mentioned above."
"M/D: Good on the palate and quite drinkable. Id have another."
"D- Nothing too bad but nothing too exciting. Could certainly have a few more but with better beers in this world why bother."
"DB- Solid brown ale for sure, full of flavor and easy to drink. Maybe just a tad bit too nutty for me but I like it."
"This is an average brown ale, enjoyable but not one that stands out."
"I poured from the straight from the bottle into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. The color was medium brown with small white laced head. It did not have the greatest head retention, but not the worst by any means. The aroma was a faint maple/bread with very little hop character. The taste was decent, but nothing super. There is a bit of a nutty breadlike taste that lingers on the way down. This beer has high drinkability because it is very smooth. If you like nut brown ales, then it is worth a try."
"The mouthfeel is probably the best part. Full bodied, rich and smooth. Carbonation level is well done. Very drinkable, depends on how you want to drink it though. This beer is worth a couple of chances, but I like it on tap better so far. As for the bottle I'd save it for Fall or Winter."
"Drinkability - Can pound down a few of these in a single sitting. It's a full bodied beer that is not too filling. Had a few of these samples at the ACBF, one of my favorite Brown Ales."
"I really enjoyed this, and I was very excited to have had a beer that I couldn't get down here while I was up there."
"Think syrupy body with a slight nutty hint. NO dry effects on pallet. Color was a nice medium brown. No a lot of head though. Very pleasant and had me wanting a second helping. Anxious to try more from the folks at Woodstock Inn. I'm kind od a bock guy and I really enjoyed this. Worth a try. Bet it's better on tap too!"
"12 ounce bottle purchased as part of a sixer on the recent Vermont trip. Has ""Best enjoyed before"" dating notched on the side of the label. Pours a typical brown ale hue, darker mocha head, that stays for a spell then drops to near nothing, just a thin collar over a near still. dull looking brawl. Bready nose, brash chocolaty flavor notes mixed in with a faint jammy note. Eh, not the greatest brown ale out there. On the unrefined side and a wee bit thin mouth feel wise. Will work fine as part of a marinade for chicken or pork, as I've found just about any brown ale will."
"Pig's Ear pours a clear brown with a brilliant ruby red showing through in the light. It's topped with a tan, fleeting head. The aroma is mainly molasses with some vanilla and biscuit notes. The flavor again starts as molasses but is well balanced with hints of anise and grain coming through. This beer has a medium mouthfeel over the palate but it's only knock is the high carbonation. It's not a session beer but try one or two with Cooper Sharp cheese. Recommended!"
"Dark brown brew reveals red highlights against a bright light. 3/4"" of dense tan head settles slowly to 1/4", sticks around quite well, generates some lace. Thick syrupy sweet smell, toffee, a bit of fake fruitiness. Taste is a bit like burnt toast and nuts, a muddy smoky bite in the finish. Lackluster, meh. Has the mouthfeel and tacky sweetness of mediocre extract-based homebrew. Reminds me of every disappointing house brew I've ever tried."
"Tasted this already on tap, which is usually too cold. At home from the bottle this malty dark brown brew recalled Belgian dubbels in the slightly sweet malt and a touch of smokiness that was really quite excellent. Very nice session beer, gets better as you drink more."
"D: This is a good brown ale and I would drink one or two but not buy a case of this beer. The metallic taste in the finish is not desirable and leaves room for improvement."
"D: Very easy to drink, similar to Newcastle....a good example of an English brown ale. A good session beer."
"Overall, this is a solid offering from Woodstock Inn. Follows the style well and has a decent amount of flavor. Nothing really stands out, but I'm having no problem finishing my glass."
"All in all a standard English brown. If I saw it at a party, I'd go for it over its macro twins."
"Nutty, sweet, with a little chocolate. Subtle woody hop in back. Standard brown."
"D: This isn't a wow in your face kind of beer, not many browns are, however it is rather tasty and well balanced and easily a beer to sit with for a session or two."
"Serving type: 64oz growler, and on tap at Woodstock Inn."
"D: EBAs have been, and always will be, session beers. This one is no exception."
"Friend brought a mixed sixer of Woodstock brews over the other night. This one was his favorite. It's pretty much a standard English brown. Fairly high carbonation might mask some of the flavor, which is mostly toffee malt with a touch of nuttiness. Mild hop presence. It's alright, but a little dull."
"Cheers!"
"I found it to be a little watery and metallic around the edges in places, leading me to believe it's not the finest crafted American representation of the style there is. Worth a shot, particularly for the none-too-discriminating brown ale fan."
"O: One of the better brown ales I've had, not a huge fan of this style but this one really seemed to hit the spot."
"More a beer for the fall or winter, but all in all an enjoyable brew!"
"Overall: I forced myself to write a review because i was pleasantly surprised by this beer. Definitely worth checking out."
"Overall I would and will drink again. It doesn't jump in your face but it also doesn't disappoint."
"Drinkability: This is just an OK English Brown. I had this on draft with a 22ounce pour and cannot say I desired another one afterwards. This one almost drinks like a bock."
"I've been disappointed by beer from this brewery before and this stuff is all contract brewed by Shipyard so I guess I should blame them?"
"D: Likable, flavorful brown ale. Unknown ABV, but seems suitably sessionable. Yeah, I'd have this again..."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Seems well balanced. Nutty characteristic seems to be the star of the show, not terribly sweet, and no obvious fruit esters. Overall, not bad and certainly worth having again."
"The feel is dry but smooth. Overall it's just a little to musty for my liking. Not bad, just not one I'd go out of my way to get another one of."
"D - Overall, this beer is very drinkable but could be improved."
"Probably one of my new favorite brown ales right up their with Ellie's Brown and SA Brown ale."
"D: While ho-hum except for the kick-ass nose, this beer sits well with me and I could dig on a few between bigger beers. If I run into it again I will not be displeased."
"12 oz Bottle. Dark brownish amber pout with a fizzy tan head. Aroma of malt, and spices. Taste of burnt malt, walnuts, faint sugar and a slight hoppy finish. Very easy on the palate, slightly thin but not a bad brew for a session around the campfire."
"D - Overall a pleasant brown ale. nothing outstanding, but a nice session brew as ever. Has more flavor than normal browns but a bit out of balance."
"Very drinkable. Enjoying during a snowstorm, in front of a fire with a football game on the tv. Perfect for the moment."
"I would say it's a decent representation of the style, although there are some other brown ales I would go after before going back to this well."
"D - Really good flavor, not heavy, so a few of these would go down with no problem. A style I am finding I enjoy a lot, distinct flavor and smooth."
"Pours a clear dark mahogony with a giant foamy tan head. The head really is big and leaves great lacing. The smell is just average with some malty scents along with roasted coffee and cocoa. The taste is very flavorful with roasted malt,coffee,cola,and cocoa. The m/f is medium with all the flavors mixing well. Not my favorite type of beer,but this is really a good brown ale."
"Poured much lighter in color than I am used to in a brown ale: a brown-amber color that was fairly transparent. It has a big, bubbly head to foreshadow the high carbonation level. The smell was a great mixture: there was nutty flavors up front, plus some dark-but-not-too-dark malts, a pinch of floral hops, a mild presence of alcohol, and ended with a touch of caramel sweetness. The taste was quite nice as well. The dominant flavors were the roasted nuts and the dark, coffee-flavor malts. However, it was rounded out by a mild hop presence in the background, and ends with some sweet caramel flavors (and maybe even some vanilla in there too). The last taste the beer leaves it actually a fantastic mix: it's malty, bitter, and sweet all at once. The thin, carbonated mouthfeel makes this beer go down nice and easy, and I could certainly drink a few more. It has enough flavor to be savored, but is smooth and light enough to have a handful."
"12oz screw-top bottle from the local Hannaford. Pours a translucent dark brown body with a quarter-inch of light tan head. Butterscotch, caramel, brown sugar dominate the aroma. Tastes sweet, with caramel, butter, and chocolate notes. Flavors are definitely understated, which is not uncommon for the style. Light in body, bordering on aqueous, with moderate carbonation. Fairly middle-of-the-road as far as drinkability is concerned, quaffable but doesn't go down as easy as it could. Overall a solid English Brown."
"Very drinkable! Plenty of nice brown ale flavors that don't over-stay their welcome. I might buy this again, and I will definitely look out for other offerings from this brewery."
"Drinkability: A wonderfully drinkable beer. I am really glad the beer of the month pack included this one, and sent 3. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone."
"The only offering from this brewery at my local beer store is this one so I gave it a try. A pretty good brown ale overall. Pours a very dark brown, deeper color than most other brown ales. Has a nice body and mouthfeel to it but does have an odd aftertaste to it that is different compared to other brown ales. It isn't bad, it's just different is all. Nothing special but a solid beer all around."
"Smell is tangy and earthy, some brown sugar. Pours to a deep metallic brown with a tan macrobubble head. Head holds up for a bit. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated and makes me pucker a little on the finish. Taste is more bitter than sweet, bitterness is even and balances a malty background. Strange finish, starts to finish bitter but then has a tangy almost zesty sweet and sourness. Light for its style, the strange finish makes it a refreshing thirst quencher. Different and unique."
"If you like the style and this is a convenient option - go for it."
"Drinkability: Not recommend. A bit under par for a brown."
"rom a 12 ounce brown bottle - Pours a reddish/brown with a small 1/8 inch head. Smells of malts, mild hops and spices. First sip has some spicy notes, nuts, malts and a nice bitter finish. Fairly light bodied, carbonated well, not too bad, not too great."
"Um, had this on tap years ago, and got lucky enough to raid a fridge and have a few from this brewery. This one is ok."
"A pretty good all around Brown Ale. Deep Brown color with a medium tan head and a lot of lace on the glass. Nice amount of spice in the flavor to offset the sweet brown sugary and nutty taste. A bit of a hoppy bite at the end which was nice and gave the beer a well-rounded taste. Solid."
"Seen this one around, finally picked it up after hearing it won some award. Poured out of the bottle a reddish brown color which appears ruby when held up to sunlight. Aromas are sweet and malty, hints of vanilla and banana bread. Tastes are of caramels, biscuity malts, a hop presence in the middle offers some balance. Finish is sweet, slightly off and it lingers. Smooth and a good American version of an English brown."
"Worth seeking out if you're in northern New England. I found it in a restaurant in North Conway, NH, where I had it with a big bowl of pasta e fagioli. Tawny color with a medium-light head, lots of toffee in the aroma, some coffee. The coffee was more apparent in the taste, as was a good deal of roasted malt, but overall it was still pleasantly light. Very nice finish, slightly bitter, leaving behind some burned taste with some chocolate. Reasonably carbonated, which gives the body some unexpected airiness."
"This seems to be my favorite style and this one is quite likeable."
"D - a bit too sweet to have all night, but it is a pretty good brown ale."
"A nice English Brown. Easy to drink. Easy to like."
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it's a decent beer but some might find it a little too sweet. Personally, it wouldn't be my first choice if I were looking for this type of beer."
"Taste is also very heavy on malt, as most brown ales are, crisp carbonation, could be smoother though, has a weird aftertaste that I can't quite place, if this was made creamier it would be much better."
"The first beer I had at The Woodstock Inn. Also the one I enjoyed the most. A medium brown color with a thick head. Some nice lacing. It had a caramel aroma with a tiny bit of nuttiness. The nuttiness came out more in the taste, but still had that nice caramel taste too. Some sweetness gave it a good mouthfeel. I could (and did) drink a few of these."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a translucent amber-brown in color with red highlights when backlit. Quarter-inch off-white head dissipated almost immediately into a spotty skim of foam; very little lacing. Scent of malt and something else. Flavors of malt, nuts and butter(yes butter), followed by a touch of hops at the finish. Nicely effervescent mouthfeel that left a clean, slightly tart presence at the end. Not a bad brew, but somewhat lacking. Buttery flavor was interesting, but made it a little less appealing for me as a session brew."
"What can I say? Its a nice, easy to drink beer. This is a very nice ""beer to have when you just want a beer"" beer, and as mentioned previously would be a great session beer or with any standard pub fare, as well as enjoying around the grill. The world needs beers like this. I'd definitely drink this again and wouldn't hesitate to grab a 6 pack to enjoy with friends. This Pig's Ear, while not a silk purse, is definitely no doggie chewie. Give it a shot - definitely recommended for those times you just want some beer."
"Bottle. Poured a clear brown color with a thick light-brown head. Decent lacing. Aroma a malt and a touch of hops. Mouthfeel is almost ideal. Nice amount of carbonation. Flavor is sweet and heavy on the brown sugar and malt. Slight hop finish. This would be a nice session beer."
"Drinkability  Very nice brown ale. Love the name that they gave it. Hope to try more from the company, good stuff."
"Drinkability: Mediocre."
"Poured a nice, rich, translucent brown color - not much head, though. Aroma has a nice, sweet, crystal scent. There seemed to be a little too much carbonation in this one, which dominated the sip. Tastes smooth - a nice malty aftertaste lingers. Not a bad brown, but seemed pretty unremarkable."
"Picked up a six while on biz in Rhode Island this week. My first bottle version of a Woodstock Inn beer. Dark brown/ruby color with about a 1"" head which dissipates to a film. Some sheet lacing which does stick well to the glass. A hint of choco in the nose. Flavor is pretty traditional English Brown. Some toffee and maly with a bit of a metallic finish. I liked the taste. The mouthfeel is quite good as it is full and rounded, pretty good balance. While the ABV is not published, this one is a good session beer. Good stuff. I'll have to score some other bottles of Woodstock Inn stuff, next time I'm is Rhode Island."
"Coffee brown brew with a big off-white head and good lacing. The aroma is of brown sugar, yeast and malt. Quite aqueous and a strong malty flavor with mild carbonation. There is a little charcoal in the back of the mouth, fairly sweet at the front. I would like to have better carbonation to cut into the watery quality. There is a very slight metallic hint but not really bothersome. Seems to grow on me with each swig, should be easy drinking these but I might tire of the sweetness eventually. Not too bad though. Definitely worth having another and worth you trying it."
"Pours a mild brown color with a thin head. Aroma is kind of malty and chewy. Taste is similar except that it's slightly thin on the tongue. It has a dry mouthfeel and the malt shines through somewhat. Not impressive enough for me but it's still solid."
"D: A nice average sessionable beer with too much diacetyl character."
"Appears a ruby brown mahogany tone with a large light cream head leaves specks of uneven lacing not too impressive but the head has decent retention overall looks like a nice brown. Aromatics a bit like cider with tart fruit notes coming through the moderately roasted malt additions that also bring mild chocolate and a woody tree bark barrage mild herbal hop additions noted mild and tame for sure. Flavors really clash the acidity of the tart character overrides the roasted malt and mild sweetness it should offer Im never big on this style but I think this ones poorly made. Pretty astringent yet it seems it hasnt turned its just how the flavors came together after production, which is weird. Mouthfeel is medium bodied really coats the palate and it sticks around sadly I might have to go brush my teeth but the carbonation was moderate and flowed well just the lactic character that sticks to your palate ruins it. Drinkability not so much as Borat would say Im going to stick other beers from this style when reaching for a brown ale pass on Pigs Ear from New Hampshire."
"A light mouthfeel,grainy texture,slightly watery. Goes down easy had a bit too much roughness to be real drinkable the sourness was also a bit much."
"Comments: I liked this Brown Ale, but it was slightly thin in the body for the style. I prefer a bit more fullness to the body for English Brown Ales, such as Sam Smith's. That being said, the flavor was good & it was easy drinking."
"Unfortunately for me, it's not available in my area.... yet."
"good drinkability, not at all harsh, or too rich, as some of this style can be."
"Pretty good brew. Pours a dark brown color with a minimal head that totally disappears within a minute. There isn't an strong smell to this beer but It has a smooth toasted malt aroma. Nice taste; heavy malt flavor, a little sweet, with a dry finish. This style isn't a particular favorite of mine but I could definitely see myself having another."
"D: Pretty drinkable brown ale, although a bit too sweet for my taste buds. I would like to try this on tap though to see if the flavors mellow out a bit or become more alarming. Worth a try if you can pick it up."
"Shaker 12oz glass presentation. 1/2"" beige head over an orangey brown brew, which faded down to an uneven layer of bubbles, and had ample sticky lacing. Aroma is lightly malty. Taste is well-balanced, medium grains, with moderate hopping. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth over the tongue, and drinkability is very nice. Not my favorite style, but I'm liking this one."
"I eventually mixed this one with a Harpoon unfiltered IPA which was one of the best combo's i've ever tried. Dubbed ""Pigtrail Brown-IPA...LOL!"
"Drinkability & Notes  At first I was not a big fan of this beer, but by mid-glass I was thoroughly enjoying it. There are some oddball flavors in there, but this one makes me want to try another beer from Woodstock soon."
"I like interesting beers; this is one. Whenever I find the experience difficult to describe, I find myself drawn to have the beer again. Hmmmm."
"Of all the beers I sampled at the Woodstock Inn Brewery, this one was the best. The problem was, none of their beers really impressed me. It had the fine medium red color going for it. But from the first sip, I noticed it was lacking any noticeable hop taste and aroma. It seemed somewhat watered-down for my taste. The malts were sweet and flavorful, which kept me interested. I declined the bartender's offer to pour me a pint. After sampling everything they had, I was ready for a better tasting cold beer sitting back in the room."
"Drinkability seems pretty nice. A different fruity and nutty kind of brown."
"Overall: An excellent microbrew. Whenever I'm up at Loon mountain I'm going to make the Woodstock Inn a required stop from now on."
"Medium bodied, nothing really special a middle of the road brown ale to the heavier roast side."
"Wyll-"
"Flavor is definitely heavy on the pale malt and esters. After three brown ales, this tasted like a pale ale. It's good in it's own right, but I'm not sure how closely it adheres to the brown ale style. Lots of fruitiness, with just a touch of roasted and/or caramunich malt. Body is slightly fuller than average, with a really nice small bubbled mouthfeel. I liked this beer quite a bit, but not as a brown ale."
"582"
"This beer is very drinkable and packed with flavor. I was a bit disappointed that the head dissolved so quickly and there was no lace to be found. Also, the bottle said it was brewed by Smuttynose in Portsmouth. That is o.k. with me since they make some fine brews on their own."
"Appearance a nice, mellow dark, brown-gold. Smell is well-rounded like smoky coffee. Based upon smell, I was expecting a stout-like mouthfeel, which was there, but with a lighter, easier to drink character. Mouthfeel was smooth with a very slight malty, smoky aftertaste. Had one with Italian food and it was an excellent complementt. Very drinkable. Got this six pack at market in town where it is brewed....next time will try on tap at the pub."
"Cheers"
"2005 update: Nothing has changed. Still an excellent session brew whose flavor still makes me smile... unless the growler's empty."
