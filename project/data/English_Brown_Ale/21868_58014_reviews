"Very good definitely give it a try with some vanilla ice cream"
""
"Not very hoppy at all. Introduction is light and energetic, though not much linger. The finish is somewhat stronger where smokey notes play mid-tongue. The honey is downplayed which is good, I was expecting the sweetness to overpower the palette. The stark bubble works well with the light, almost crispness."
"Good beer I enjoy it a lot, not favorite bit great."

"It was good...would probably go with the Lucky Town Pub Ale if I'm drinking a brwon ale. I'd drink it again."

"Great smell and body but taste flavored instead of infused"
""
"Enjoyable smooth brown ale.  Sweetness does not bother me, but may be too much for some.  Looks like iced tea in the glass."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown, iced tea like color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of malts, honey. Taste is bready, nutty, honey is present but not sweet. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a bit different, but an enjoyable beer."

"this is better than its ratings, but maybe im partial or feel nostalgic or overly stoked because this is (im pretty darn sure) my first beer from the curious state of alabama! cool! a decent brown ale, sure maybe its a bit thin in grain character for the style, but the english ale yeast is nice and the honey works really well. its vibrant and sweet and floral in the nose, adds a richness to a light beer, and brings the abv up just enough. it looks nice, albeit a bit light, but it holds its tan head well, and the nose presents chocolate malt and a nuttiness that makes me think almond. the honey goes great with that, and its a cool mix of textures and flavors overall. carbonation is high and its almost refreshing with how light the body is. a clean finish with just a little of the english yeast character. well made, maybe boost up the dark grain a touch, but i could drink a ton of these."

"Overall: Not spectacular but drinkable enough."

"O - I must have gotten  a bad batch based on previous comments but it was a pure butter bomb.  I struggled through 3/4 of a PBR before I couldn't take it any more."

"O: Found this one in Montgomery, AL and drank in Decateur, AL. I love to try local brews. I’d say its good, not typical for the style, and as some off flavours. Otherwise, its got a great label on the bottle, and is really not bad."

"Overall, a very nice Brown Ale. The honey taste is very slight, which I think is actually a good thing, or else the beer would probably be just too sweet. There's also a nice nuttiness, which I would expect for a Brown Ale. The mouth feel is a bit lighter than I expected and there's a slight bit of pleasant carbonation."

"Overall: This is an above average beer. The head on it isn't so great and the smell, I wish was stronger but it tastes great and has a really good presence about it."

"Bottled on date is December 11, 2013. Pours out to a quickly dissipating head and pale brown color. Aroma is very weak, there is some honey and nuts in there. Flavor is very subtle and laid back, reminds me of a homebrew with a bit of a twang and slight oxidation note of cardboard. Not bad but not good either. No real fresh malt or hops evident. Balanced bitter and sweet so another plus for being on style. Mouthfeel is light and CO2 is appropriately restrained. Overall a boring brown, drinkable but not exciting in the least. Think Southern Pecan without the pecans. Beats a Newcastle, though!"

"It pours out amber but there is no head to speak of and what is there disappears quickly. I got a sniff of citrus but not much else. The taste is nothing special but it does drink well on the palate - medium with an upfront fizz that is not too long. I couldn't taste the honey anywhere except maybe in the smell."
""
""
""
"A rather weak attempt at a drinkable version of the style - everything just seems wan and uninteresting, to the point of serious ennui. The honey is a nice idea, but barely makes a dent in the overall impression of this offering. If you see this particular honey giving you the eye, check yourself, and simply walk away."

"Truck Stop Honey Brown Ale is a decent representation of the English Brown Ale style, but consumers should know that it is not a robust brown ale. If that is what you want, then you should look elsewhere, for this beer is a little on the lighter side. However, it is not watery and has enough good qualities going for it to warrant a sample. It is much like other Back 40 beer products: Nothing amazing, but imminently drinkable and with enough good points to recommend."

"Overall: It's definitely a light, easy-drinking brown ale. I'm down for that, but, anyone looking for high hopping or a thicker, heavier brown might do best to look elsewhere."

"Taste is more of the same with this beer, tastes more like a graham cracker than probably any other beer I have had. Honey is not as apparent on the flavor and finishes drier than expected with a little bit of toast and a decent amount of hops. I am digging this beer. Mouthfeel is thinner than I would like to see as well and the malt depth could use a boost. But overall I think this is a fine brown ale that I will definitely seek out again next time I am in Alabama. I am a sucker for a good English Brown Ale...though this one could fit just as well as an American Brown me thinks. Both Back Forty offerings I have had have been impressive - keep up the good work!"

"Overall I like this beer. Maybe it's because of my local pride, maybe not."
"Cheers!"

"Trying the truck stop honey at the Pie Factory in Florance, AL. The beer poured a clear brownis h amber with no head and no lacing. The scent carries hints of honey. The taste his a nice combination of biscuit and honey. The m outhfeel is lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall this is a good session beer."
"O: Tasty and not overly sweet, but marred but an inexplicably harsh feel."
"Overall I'm glad I tried it and I would definitely recommend."

"From a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Best by dating on bottle. Poured an almost tea color with an initial one-finger white head that receded into a thin cap. Thin, oily lacing was present. Nose is full of malty bread. The taste follows the nose with a sweet bready flavor and some pepper. Mouthfeel is a bit less than medium with little to no aftertaste. Overall, one of Bama's best offerings. Is one of my go-to's."

"If you enjoy brown ales, this is an Alabama special. I find it very hard to believe that ""Brown"" by Good People is so highly acclaimed, when I much prefer the Truck Stop Honey Brown. Give it a try, I guarantee, you'll enjoy. It's tough to find, so don't hesitate if the opportunity presents."

"O-A good brown ale. Definitely the best one brewed in Alabama. Try it, you won't be disappointed."

"Found this previously unknown brown ale floating in the mixed six section at a Winn Dixie in Meridian, Mississippi. This was a medium bodied brown with a balanced flavor and slender body that was certainly worth trying but not something I'd probably get much if it was available in my area. The honey and clove in the nose translate well into the taste and the hops are just noticeable enough to give it some character. I was a little disappointed with the thin texture. A distinctive take on the style, but I don't drink a ton of brown ales myself."
""
""
"This offering pours up a nice amber with a one finger head, not much retention and leaves little to no lacing. The nose is pine, honey, and biscuit. Mouthfeel is very thin, almost watery. Taste is pretty watery too on the front though the finish is respectable. I honestly expected more from this. However it is very drinkable if perhaps a little one dimensional."

"O: Very enjoyable brown ale here, although I'd categorize it as an English version. I could see this being my go-to beer if it was available in my area. Recommended."
""

"O: I was expecting more from a brown ale. This tastes more like a weak American brown. The honey gives it a rich, smooth feel. But I wish there was more to it."

"Picked up a six'er from the piggy wiggly in Anniston, AL . Poured into a tulip. Good brown / redish color with decent head. You can smell light hints of honey and malt. Taste pretty darn good. Im a fan of brown ales and I think brewing this one with honey was a great addition. The carbonation is on point and has a great mouthfeel. The taste of honey is present all throughout the entire experience. Way to go Back Forty !! An overall great brewery from Gadsen, AL"
"Overall - not a bad brew, and fairly interesting."

"Pours more of very dark amber than brown, with a fairly creamy off-white head that fades after a few minutes. Lightly hoppy in the nose, with some herbal notes. A touch of sour graininess, and a a very, very light roasty note, end with a bit of honeyed sweetness. Not a very robust brown. The taste is similar, with not enough body or roastiness, but a thin slightly sour graininess and some late sweetness substituting for those flavors. A slight herbal hoppiness helps things a bit. Too thin, too sour, not enough bite, or lacking that, roastiness. Even some honest maltiness would be welcome here. Fairly pedestrian."
"Overall this was a decent enough beer, although it’s not something I would seek in the future."
"O- Fairly easy to drink and kind of boring."
"Had this on tap recently at Dram Whiskey Bar in Mountain Brook Village. Nice brown, coppery color. No discernable head whatsoever. Could have been the bartender not pouring out of the tap correctly. Notes of toffee and slightly nutty in the aroma. Taste was good, but nothing to write home about. I tasted a slight nuttiness, along with biscuity malt. Not much of a hope presence, which is understandable in this style. Slightly sweet, which may be due to the honey. Overall, I would drink this again as a good, sessionable, local brew."
"Beer is thin and mildly sweet with a toffee like finish to it. A little cidery, mildly bitter the more I drink, the second was better than the first the third was the same as the second. Overall, it's light and easy drinking. Nothing to see here though, an average brown."
"The aroma is sweet malts, hints of roast, and honey. Low hop profile. The taste follows the nose with a mild sweet malt, slightly watery, hints of earthy hops, sweet honey, faint chocolate note, light toast, and a hint of roasted malt. Quite nutty. Creamy but light texture. Refreshing and easy to drink. Quite sessionable."
"Clean tasting beer with a nutty, slight roastiness to it. Just a hint of caramel sweetness in the flavor and a bit of bitterness making it a nicely balanced brown ale. Not a ton of unique character, and no trace of honey, but a drinkable brown ale that could be sessionable."
"D - Overall a pretty good brown ale. The flavor is good and it goes down smooth, but it could look a bit better and I would prefer if it weren't so light bodied."
"I guess this is being brewed by Lazy Magnolia at the moment, so perhaps they'll tweak the recipe a bit if/when they end up brewing in B'Ham. Also, while I like LM's beers, consistency hasn't exactly been one of their hallmarks."
"Fairly easy to put away, overall tasty, not too sweet or filling, and a surprisingly decent rendition of a brown."
"D: Too drinkable. A well crafted beer and obviously didn't go unnoticed picking up Silver Medal at Great American Beer Festival this past year. Well-deserved!"
"Not all that complex but not a bad brown ale. Not nearly as sweet as I was expecting."
"Overall I liked the brew and it was an easy brown ale to drink but... It did come off as a rather average brown ale to me."
"D: I would drink this beer a lot. It's easy sipping, interesting drinking, and goes down swell. Would buy again; recommended."
"This is an excellent beer from a very small brewery. The added honey makes a unique twist that is characteristic to the beer. It is hard to find, but if you see it you need to try it."
"This light-bodied, sweet brown ale is easy to drink in one session. Its color is a thin brown, close to amber. The smell is non-obtrusive, but not revealing either. The taste is light, and sweet with a bit of nuttiness. Brewed with local wildflower honey, so it's good for my allergies. :) I'm glad to see another style from Back 40, as the pale ale is such a tough category to start in. I have enjoyed this 6-pack enough to have finished it in two days! Congrats to Back 40!"
