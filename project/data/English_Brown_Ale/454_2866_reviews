"Great color and finish. Also has a better than average carbonation level for a brown. I am an ipa and brown ale lover which effects my score."
"I poured it down the drain after a half of glass...something I never do."
""
"had this from 12 oz bottle.   A very nice brown ale, with more complexity than most.  Should appeal to most"
""
"Dark Amber color with mild head and very little carbonation. Strong nutty aroma. Hints of burned wood and toasted malt. Hop flavors that I did not expect. Sweet. Mild flavor. Tart with a spice at the of the sip. Easy to drink. Not the worst but there are better out there."

"Poured into a Kansas City Royals pint glass, but do not worry, the mediocrity of the team does not affect the beer. In this case, the beer was just mediocre. Thin, thin, thin and only slightly flavorful. Light brown in appearance (is this darker on tap?), and no head to speak of. Luckily, I only had one bottle of this in a mix-and-match 6'er. Won't try again from the bottle."

"Fair head for a brown with some lingering lacing on the glass. Color is very clear for a brown. A very mild nutty aroma. Not impressive. Taste and mouth feel are extremely thin. There's really not much here to satisfy. Given Arcadia's strong distribution in Michigan, I expected a lot more from them. This is way too bland. Pass it up."

"Overall- An interesting take on a brown, almost reminded me of a lighter bock at times, I'd like to have it fresh to truly give a definite say"

"Taste/feel: Average is as average does. It tastes like the smell... light on the aroma, light on the taste... easy drinking, but it's just a middle-of-the-road brown that's just not that interesting. Arcadia doesn't make the best beer, but they make typical examples of styles without trying to ""change the rules", so to speak."
"Overall: Not at all bad, but the thinness of the taste profile was a bit disappointing -- but not enough to keep me from drinking it again."
"I'd recommend this beer as something to at least experience but not when better options like New Holland Brewing or Samuel Smith are available."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 12/4/2012. Pours lightly hazy reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, cocoa, brown bread, light nuttiness, roasted malt, and floral hop earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, brown sugar, toast, chocolate, dark bread, light nuttiness, roasted malt, light raisin, and floral hop earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toast, chocolate, dark bread, light nuttiness, roasted malt, and floral earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and robustness of malty flavors; with hardly any cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, lightly slick, and earthy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice brown ale. Good balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering; though not as nutty as I would expect given the nut brown title."

"This is the sort of beer that you would happily reach for if this was the only craft beer in a cooler of Bud or Coors. As it is, it's a decent enough brown ale, but there are better choices out there."
""
"Wasn't expecting much from this one, so it was actually a bit better than expected. Certainly not bad, but this beer falls under the category of ""decent, but many better choices available"" and gives no real reason to choose it again."
""

""
""
"O: Overall, It's probably in the middle-upper range of brown ales that I've had, it's not the best but it's pretty good. Gotta drink the local beers."
""
"Overall nothing exceptional maybe a touch bitter than it should be but it has enough sweet malts and nutty flavors to make for a pretty enjoyable experience."
""
""
"o - not bad, but not that good either. i'm a little put off by the spiciness actually. i don't think i'd turn one down if offered, but i likely won't purchase this again."
""
"A decent brown ale, but doesn't work as a nut brown to me."
"This beer isn't bad. It's actually pretty good. It's not the best nut brown I've ever come across, but it's better than most. I'd be interested to try this one again when it's cold outside."
""
""
"O: A very decent beer that I think would be great to have with a meat and potatoes kind of meal."
""
"Tart, a little vinegary. Toasted mlat pops out in the middle and finish. Tart fruits and vinegar throughtout the whole flavor profile. Palate is light and tart. Odd for a brown ale."
"Overall a rather poor showing. The nut flavor is there but overpowered by alcohol which is disappointing given the lower ABV."
"Overall, this goes down smooth, and is very tasty. The bottle says it's 6% ABV, although the website states 5.6% ABV."
"Carbonation keeps the feel from flat and there's a smoothness, but I wouldn't call this beer lively. It does remain crisp all the way, but I want more creaminess too. The body is medium."
""
"Beer is light to medium bodied. Coats the middle to back of the tongue, slight dry finish. Carbonation not very heavy, just enough to keep it going."
""

"D: Starts out good for look and aroma. Taste too thin on malt background. Hops are a bit astringent and even medicinal. Mineral background note. Still manages to be okay, but it could be better."

"This beer pours a clear orangish brown color. It has a nice 2-figner light tan head on it. The head has decent retention, and it leaves behind some scattered lace on the glass. The nose is pretty faint overall. I am getting some toasted malt and nuttiness. There are also some caramel and faint chocolatey aromas. The taste starts off with some toasted malt. There are some flavors of caramel, nuts, and a small bit of smokiness. There is a very mild hop presence that just pokes through. The finish leaves some lingering toasted malt on the palate. This has a medium body, but it is a little on the thin side. The carbonation is average. There is some malty sweetness and just a touch of hop bitterness. This has decent drinkability. It goes down easy and the flavor is pretty good. The aroma is really lacking and the body is a bit on the thin side. Some of the flavors seem muted as well. It is worth a shot to try, but it isn't a stand out beer."

"I liked this well enough to buy it again, though I like other Aradia offerings better."

"I had this English Brown Ale on tap in a pint glass. Poured a very nice caramel color, thick tan head. Great head retention and decent lacing. The aroma was full of toasted malt and nuts. The taste of the ale was nice, nutty, dry, caramel, toasted malt and a nice amount of hops. Medium body, Wonderful session beer, very creamy, smooth. Very happy i gave this one a try....One of the best American craft versions of a English Brown that I have tried to this point."
"O: Goes down ok, somewhat tasty, not too filling, not much of a kick, mediocre representation of style. This isn't a horrible beer, but it just didn't do it for me."
"Overall a good beer I can see why so many people would think that it is a good session beer. I enjoyed it would keep it in the back of my mind if I ever wanted to try the style again."
"Pretty decent overall, this is yet another enjoyable brew from the Arcadia mixed 12 pack. I likely would not buy this on it's own, but as part of the mixed pack, I would definitely have it again."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and goes down well. IT has a nice drinkable feel but seems to stumble just for a moment but is gone and leaves a nice aftertaste."
"Overall - All in all a good brew, nice smell, with a sweet, hoppy taste. Would not be a go to for me personally but good none the less."
"O: ordinary brown ale, not a must have, but not awful. This would be a fine session brew, but just nothing to get hyped."
"Mouthfeel was ok. A little thicker than I prefer with a brown but its lighter style made it fairly easy to drink."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 2/3 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of citrus hops, sweet malt, slight earthy malt, slight pale malt, slight nut, and a hint of grain. Fits the style of English Brown Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight earthy malt, slight nut, slight pale malt, hint of grain, and a hint of citrus hops. Overall, good appearance, aroma, blend, and body."
"While the beer is clean, it lacked any semblance of balance and seemed to have been formulated with a heavy hand in the hop bucket."
"Ah, more cask ale! This one pours a mostly clear amber-sienna topped by a finger of dirty ecru foam. The nose comprises green apple, cedar, light maple syrup, red grapes, and light ruby red grapefruit. The taste holds notes of light maple syrup, light walnuts, brown sugar, figs, and dark greens. The body is a light medium, with a cask carbonation and a very smooth feel. Overall, a nice little nut brown that seems to benefit nicely from the cask conditioning."
"Overall I thought this was a good nut brown, it was an easy drinker and was well balanced, but I could have gone for more nuttyness. I Liked this beer but fireside nut brown still holds the title as my favorite nut brown."
"This is one that I will not purchase again. The bitterness really overpowers this beer."
"Arcadia markets as an English style brewery but to me this is an American Nut Brown with the hop-forward taste. Otherwise its a good brew."
"Drinkability: Above average nut brown. Could have a couple but nothing to go out of my way for."
"Drinkability - An easy drinker. Not much that makes you remember it however. Better than some, not a top tier however in my opinion."
"Pours a beautiful mahogany brown with a 1.5 inch thick tan head that settles at 3/4 inch. The initial nose is appealing and inviting. Medium body with a caramel and malty lingering that is moreish. Well/formed yet moderate Belgian lace. The subsequent nose provides hints of yeast, chocolate and dried fruit. The finish is clean with delicate hop notes."
"Overall, nothing special going on here, but a decent brown ale for the price"
"D: A bit bland, but inoffensive. You could give this to just about anyone and they'd probably drink it."
"First beer I had that night. Appearance is good, a lighter brown than I was expecting and not much head retention. Smell was a little on the weak side. You can make out hints of nuts but a bit of the weak side. Taste was average. Not strong enough from what I like to see in a brown ale. Taste of nuts and a bit of smokyness. Mouth feel was too light for my taste as well. nothing to really lwake-up up the senses. I think its their worst brew, but its not ""bad", just their weakest effort. I'll take a new caslte over this brew honestly."
"The beer pours a brilliantly clear chestnut brown with a dark red hue. The white head quickly diminished but left a bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is moderately malty, grainy, nutty with a hint of spicy hop. The flavor is highly malty, bittersweet and a bit of nuts then a bit of alcohol emerges at the swallow. The carbonation is medium-low and body medium. Overall a decent nut brown but nothing spectacular."
"D Good, which is, I think, the point of this beer. 4.0"
"It pours a deep, dark brown, with a non-existent head. Nonetheless, it appears to be well-carbonated, with tiny bubbles rising in the glass. The ale has strong, sharp hops flavors, but no aftertaste and nary a hint of bitterness. Full, rich flavor; blend of malt and hops. Notably, this is highly drinkable and exceedingly smooth. One of the better brown ales I've had."
"Clear ruby red with a big head of tan foam. Nose is sweet and somewhat crisp. Some musty malt, medicine, and herbal notes. Fairly fruity with a soft butter and nuts. Quite acidic, with a bit of a coffee edge. Toasted character loses out to tartness, but still managed to stick around some. Some astringency on the tongue with a moderate carbonation. A bit of a punchy brew. OK drinkability."
"Drinks easy, an okay brown, very sessionable"
"O) This was an older sample from Pegasus' massive cross country beer haul (Thanks btw!). I'm sure the hops have faded out a bit, but still a very enjoyable beer."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a copper/garnet color with a thin khaki head. Ok retention as a collar and the lacing was consistent in thin bands. The aroma was sweet and notably nutty with toasted malt, caramel malt and a light floral hops presence. The flavors were at first a flash of caramel malt sweetness soon followed by doughy malt, then the toasted malt, nuts, and a long bitter finish that coated my tongue provided by the hops (similar to coffee but not quite so biting). A nice flavor arc and well balanced. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body medium and the carbonation perfect. Quite sessionable and one of the best examples of a nut ale I've had; well worth a try."
"very good session beer"
"Pours a nice tree-bark brown with almost no head. Aroma is light of sweet brown sugar and toffee. Aroma is great but could just be a little stronger. Taste is dominated by a heavy dose of dark crystal malt. A little pleasant alcohol around the edges, but nothing extreme. Pretty sparing on any chocolate malt/roasted barley which keeps it nicely in the realm of a true British brown. Mouthfeel is dead on with a great amount of carbonation that is light on the tongue but prickly and cleansing down the throat. A very drinkable nut brown.. the kind you just want more and more of."
"A dark brown color with two fingers of white frothy head that falls to a rim,spotty lacing.Aroma is malty,slightly fruity.Flavor is very crisp,malty,nutty,with hints of rasins and other sweet fruit,very balanced.Smooth mouthfeel,very drinkable,I could knock back several of these at one sitting."
"Easy to drink, and smooth, but overall, pretty unimpressive. Wouldn't mind trying it in the bottle to see how it compares."
"d: I will be drinking 3 or 4 of these tonight, no problem."
"Brown-amber pour with a filmy tan head, little to no lacing. Enticing aroma lots of brown sugar and caramel. Medium bodied, kind of fizzy in the mouth, relatively smooth finish. Flavor is a reminder of the aroma, on the sweet side with a touch of sugary goodness, decent malt content. There aren't any prominant hop flavors present, this one seems to rely on the malt which is fine in a brown."
"Mouthfeel has a solid medium body. Mild creamy texture and crisp carbonation."
"The color was a very nice deep brown with a tan creamy head. Definite Brown Ale smells of roasts and carmel and little hints of hops. The tastes come through from the various smells of carmel and malts and yet the hops come into play. Very dry aftertaste on your tongue. I really liked this one and in fact ordered another from the bartender."
"Drinkability - two sips and done, this was very harsh. Label code has notches on the D and the 6, FWIW."
"A nice, easy drinking, brown ale. Another solid brew from Arcadia."
"This is one of the best brown ales I've had since they made the newcastles in brown stubbies. Nice nutty aroma with hints of raisin and wine. Pour was a nice deep brown with a thick frothy almost tan head. Taste was very nutty and delicious. Maple, caramel malt and wine with a nice thin mouthfeel. Delicious."
"Pours a nice deep amber with an off white head alot of foam which settles quickly, moderate lacing. The nose is soft, alot of apple cider, a little alcohol; nothing to get you really excited. The taste is cider again, but a nice nutty finish evidences the reason for the name. It's overcarbonated and too light bodied for a session, but the nutty finish is nice."
"D: Relatively average brown ale -- good but far from great."
"D - ""I don't really care for this one."" That's what my wife tells me to say in public instead of ""this sucks big fat hairy goat balls."" Once, I told her in front of herfamily that her aunt's root vegetable salad ""tasted like disease"" instead I should have just said...""I really care for this."" How can one of the best looking beers I've seen in a long time smell so offensive and taste so mediocre?"
"D-A very mild dark ale which makes for enhanced session drinking. This is the first experiance with Arcadia and while its nothing spectacular, will probably try again."
"D- Not over powering, and a good example of the style, so it becomes a decent session beer."
"Nothing above and beyond... Pretty mediocore..."
"D-this is a decent brew at best,not something I would seek out,but not one to avoid either"
"pours a very cloudy dark brown color with a big opague head, lots of foam from t his beer. the aroma is surprisingly hoppy for a nut brown ale, while it of course has some malty aroma, it has some nice mild hop aromas too. taste is a lot like the aroma a nice mixture of malt and hop flavors. taste is good overall, if it were more readily available, it probably would be a go to for me."
"Prosit, MK"
"Beer produced a good two finger head, with decent lacing throughout the duration of the drink. The high point of the beer was that it has a nice dark amber color. Smell was somewhat lacking, some faint nuttiness, but almost seemed like a metallic smell. Taste was nothing exciting. Once again the nuttiness made an appearance, but nothing really stands out. Beer was a medium body with decent carbonation. Overall the drinkability was okay, I probably wouldn't buy it again though."
"D: Not bad, complex but not as overall balanced as I would have liked, the nuttiness is there in spades, malt bitterness as well, not a beer to suck down, but a good beer overall. Enjoyable."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep amber brown with a soapy, two-finger head that dissipates pretty quickly. The smell is very light, not much to say about it - I think I can smell a bit of biscuity character and floral hops but that's about it. The taste is much sweeter than I had expected from a ""nut"" brown ale. It seems to lack the toasted, nutty character that one might expect from such an ale. There really isn't much of a hop presence to speak of either. It's not a bad beer, just difficult to classify in that it doesn't really have any discernable qualities about it. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth carbonation. Drinkability of this one is pretty high, but I don't think I would call it a ""nut"" brown ale."
"Beautful deep ruby brown pour out of the 12oz bottle in to my imperial pint glass foming with a white head. Carmel malt sweetness mixed in with a roasted nuttyness wafes forth from the glass. This medium bodied brew has a nice hop bite ballenced by a toasty toffie and carmel malt profile. Theres a nice play with the tofie hops and sweetness."
"Drinkability: This will probably be a drain pour. I have had other Arcadia ales and enjoyed them, so I can only assume something is wrong with this beer. But, nearly my entire mixed 12 pack has had carbonation issues. Maybe they are having some QC issues."
"Truth be told, this is a fairly standard, completely average brown ale. It is a bit watery, but that's not even too distracting. All of your roasted nut flavors, burnt caramel, a slight hop bite are here, all doing their job adequately enough. There's nothing wrong with this beer, but then again there's nothing too exciting about it either. If you're a fan of the genre, and have one at your disposal, go for it. But I wouldn't go out of my way to find one."
"Arcadia beer seems to be hit (London Porter, Imperial Stout, Hopmouth DIPA) or miss (all the rest). Unfortunately, Nut Brown Ale fits squarely into the latter category. I don't know if the sourness is intended or not, but it isn't a characteristic that complements very many styles. Better browns shouldn't be too hard to find."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thin tan head that fades to spotty lacing. The aroma is less than average. It has a contaminated scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts along with a sour, spoiled yeast aroma. The taste is less than average as well. It has a weak and watery ""brown"" ale flavor that goes down quick butt sours in the finish. There is definately some contamination here. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low/medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This one's going down the drain. I really can't believe that a brewery would distribute all over the country, beer that is clearly subpar and bacteria exposed. Where's the quality control?"
"Pours a nice dark brownish color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, some nic sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, slightly sour, lots of caramel. The taste is malty, sour/tangy, dark fruits, and some caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, there's a pattern with these Arcadia brew's that I'm not really liken so far. Of the three I've had so far today, there is a tendency to be sour, when not called for, in my opinion. Maybe bad bottles or just not what I was expecting. So, I'm not a big fan of this brewery so far."
"My guess is that this is not intended, but they should do this to more of their Brown Ales and package them under a different name. As an English Brown, I'd have to score this one quite low. As a Sour Brown, the scores would be near Jolly Pumpkin levels. But as a beer, it was only nice."
"Light and tangy on the tongue. Plenty carbonated, and a mild yet sharp finish. Not much smoothness and rather uncharacteristic of the style. Good though, very interesting."
"12 ouncer, no freshness indication, pours dark honey amber, semi cloudy, tan minor head and just a light smattering of lace left clinging to the glass. Malty nose with a wiff of an empty can of nuts. Softly sweet, more mild, musty nut notes, also with some cola and honey. Drinkable brown ale, works as a pleasing sessioner, with some nuts and cheese/crackers or would be fine in a marinade."
"Appears a ruby caramel brown forms a large tan head leaves uneven lacing around my pint, nice two finger depth at that. Aroma has herbal tobacco leaf hop profile with caramel toasted nut roastiness going on with a creamy sweet malt chocolate presence with a mild air of coffee roasts. Flavors some toasted almond with other roasted nut character a pleasant herbal earthy tone creamy flow altogether really tasty compared to most nut brown ales not a style I've gone for since Wildgoose started disappearing. Mouthfeel has a medium body even moderate carbonation rolls nicely definitely smooth session beer texure. Drinkability...English ale well done very comparable to the Wildgoose version I used to like so much."
"Pours fairly clear from the bottle, slight haze with a ruby/brown colour with a foamy off white head. Smell is a little weak, a light and sweet graininess is present with the backing of brown sugar, maybe a little hoppy in the background. The flavor is of toasty malts and nutty with brown sugar or molasses dominating the flavor profile, hops are hardly noticeable in the watery finish. This is a fairly light bodied beer and the Mouthfeel can really be described as watery. A decent offering from an otherwise very solid brewery."
"D- very drinkiable considering the light taste and the light body."
"Clear mahogany brown, tan head was kinda wimpy, and the aroma was on the subtle side of chocolate and walnuts. Quaff was a smooth and fine combination of aroma and tastes, even a bit of coffee in there. Medium bodied, finished fairly dry. A nice crossover or session brew."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not very filling, good representation of style while including a twist to make the beer a little bit different. Its a very good beer to stick with for an evening."
"Light to medium mouthfeel with some grainyness. Not a bad beer,a bit boring,nothing here to make me want to drink more of it."
"A decent offering in the style. This one is great to enjoy with a pork chop dinner. Worth the try, especially if you can get the mixed pack t sample a few other offerings from the brewer."
"Overall, nothing special happening here. Just a sweet light brown ale. Refreshing though."
"D - This is a very good brown ale. Nice hazelnut notes."
"At first glance of this beer in my glass, it was a brown/amber color. Darker than I expected. After pouring, there was nary a head to mention. The smell was not overpowering, yet not underwelming either. Definitley a hint of nuts along with a malty/hoppy smell. At first taste, I must admit, I was not a big fan (mostly because of what I was drinking before), but as I consumed more of this tasty beverage, my feelings started to change. It was very hoppy, a hint of caramel and malt as well. The more I consumed, the better it tasted. It had a very clean and crisp taste to it. All and all, a good beer and they have a fan in me."
"If you live near the Downtown BK area I recommend that you stop in and enjoy this delicious brew while its still being offered in their cask selection."
"This is a decent brown. It pours a rich brown with a very small head, yellow in color. Smells of just a hint of hop, with toasty malt, maybe a bit of caramel. Tastes just about the same. A real dry nut flavor is present. It is a clean drinker, average all round beer, quite easy to quaff. Not as smooth as it could be, but overall it isnt bad, but there are other browns out there worth drinking more than this."
"Overall a good drinkable brown ale. Sessionable for sure, but for the most part uneventful."
"Poured into a pint glass - deep brown with a moderately sized fluffy tan head. Good retention. Smells malty with a slight touch of caramel maybe a little nut as well. Taste is nutty and malty, kind of creamy. However, it stills feel thin - too much carbonation, not enough of the creamy texture. Not the most drinkable, but nothing to throw down the drain either. Give it a shot."
"Drinkability: I like it, enjoyable, sessionable, affordable."
"D- This beer has some good flavors but has some off flavors that balance it."
"Very approachable and companionable, this, a mellow and well-crafted brown ale that anyone can be comfortable with. A solid effort from Arcadia."
"drinkability: average to slightly above average"
"beer is very drinkable and enjoyable i most weather, goes great with veggie burgers."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, with a good, clean white head. There is not much lacing. The smell is mostly of roasted malt and nut. There is also a bit of hop presence. Nothing too bold. Flavor is mostly malt and nut. It is also pleasantly sweet, moreso than I remember most brown ales being. Well balanced and very nice. In the mouth, Arcadia Brown is pretty full and sweet. There is moderate carbonation and a ton of sweetness. Overall, I was mildly surprised by this beer. This is a pretty good rendition of a nut brown ale that to my mind is a step above typical Newcastle clones. An inoffensive and pleasant brew."
"Brown color, leaning toward burnt umber, clear. Big-bubbled head lasts only about half a minute, settles to a pale tan skim. Slipping thin sheets of lace, not a lot of stickiness. Pleasant aroma, sweet caramel bordering on toffee. Mouthfeel is less than medium but smooth with reserved carbonation. Flavor follows the aroma in most aspects, buttery diacetyl toffee tones with an unwavering profile. Lacks a hop signature as expected. Slight bit of raisin at the finish. Malty and fine for style, seems to be a well-brewed example from Arcadia and among their better beers in my opinion."
"From tasting notes on my blog Pilgrims Pub. This beer pours a paper bag brown, with two and a half finger tan head that spills over my glass from vigorous pour. The smell is quite sweet. The taste is toasted malt and a light almond like nuttiness. Soft and creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied. Really easy and delicious brown ale. Great session beer."
" The smell of this beer is good, giving off a nuttish aroma. The taste and mouthfeel/drinkability was exceptional. If I was able to distinguish detailed scents and flavors at this time I would be more discriptive. Good brew, bottom line."
"Here ya go Colin - This ones for you. Poured out to a deep mahogany color with a huge off white head that calmed down after a few moments. Lace litters the interior of the glass. Aromas of roasted nuts and sweet earth fills the nose. Nice. Taste is high on the Yum scale; flavors of roasted nuts, mild malts, sweet spices and young hops blend together very well. This is a much better sample than my last one. Mouthfeel is medium light bodied and smooth. Goes down very nice. A good level of drinkability. This is a good, easy drinking beer, and I thank my pal sopor for providing a fresh sample. Recommended."
"Moderate body and pleasant carbonation make this pretty refreshing. Not a seesion brew, and not super quaffable, but I could easilly see myself keeping a bottle or two of this around if I had my perfect cellar."
"Uh-oh. I suspected trouble when I opened the bottle, took a whiff, and checked to make sure I didn't accidently open a bottle of grape soda. The two smells are indistinguishable. So then I pour it into a glass and become downright suspicious. With a gentle pour, I was left with a glass entirely filled with foam. This must be a bad bottle, right? But it was part of a sampler, and the other beers were fine (OK, not very good, but fine). So now I'm pretty convinced that this is how the beer is supposed to be. After several minutes of settling, this beer has a nice copper color with an off-white head. The aroma, as stated, is sweet and fruity, like grape juice. The flavor is not far off from grape juice either. It's sweet, fruity, and tangy. The yeast tastes sour. Another weak beer from a brewery that is really failing to impress."
"I would like another of these but I only purchased one. I had avoided this just on looks for the longest time. I think Arcadia could use a new label maker as I truly believe it would help their cause. As unfair as it seems, good soup served in a dirty bowl doesn't always get the credit it deserves."
"This beer has possibly the worst bottle design I've ever seen. It's so incredibly bland and amateurish that I think I've unconsciously put off trying the couple of bottles I got from sopor in a trade simply because of the awfulness of the label. Thankfully, the label is by far the worst part. Pours a nice red-tinted dark brown with a pretty beige head and really excellent lacing throughout the drink. Not a whole lot of scent, a little roasty, a little mapley, but nothing jumps out. The taste is really good, a bitter, roasted base with sweet, mapley overtones. Aftertaste is quite pleasant, bitter with a little bit of the maple. Mouthfeel is exceptional; this beer is perfectly carbonated and goes exceedingly well with the flavors. Overall, this is a very tasty, smooth beer, sort of a lighter version of a porter."
"A bit thin on the mouthfeel...I could use some more body here. Carbonation is nice and works well. There was nothing that really stood out to me here. A decent brown ale that almost comes off as a lager to me. Not one I'll be seeking out in the future."
"The beer pours a dark ruby red to ruby brown color with a small ring of head. The nose is mostly caramel wtih a slight nutty quality, but not enough roastedness for me. The flavor is not all that good. It starts out with a slightly chemically, artificial flavor that moves to a slightly roasted nuttyness wtih an astringent aftertaste that really detracts from the brew. The feel is thin to light moderate with an active carbonation. Overall, this is one that I have been less than impressed with. The flavor and feel really don't do well for this. I won't be looking for this one again."
"received as selection of brew tour beer of the month club. Poured a nice brown color with minimal head and smell of roasted coffee. It had a nice taste but nothing extraordinary. Left a dry taste in the mouth that was not unpleasant. Probably will not try again"
"This beer is good but not great. I find that it would make a nice drink on occassion. Probably a bit too sweet for my tastes."
"Overall a middle of the road brew. I'll try another bottle and see if I get more carbonation."
"Throws a dark red accompanied by a decent yet thin brown head that will maintain a nice little sheet over this brew. Nose is very weak, yet some malts and toasted wheat crackers are detectable. Floral hops and toffee are noted up front; this brown is quite sweet. Nutty based body, some toffee and light coffee bean flavorings. A bit over-carbonated with fresh baked bread tastings left on the palate. All in all a decent brown."
"This beer is nothing earth shattering, but is an easy drinking brown ale. I'd say this is a good alternative for your Newcastle drinker."
"Cloudy dark brown with lots of particles floating around , small foamy tan head that leaves a some lacing in my glass, roasty nutty-bready aromas. Nutty caramel flavors, finishes on the sweet side. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel, a decent brown."
"Picked this one up in a recent mixed six pack kick. Although I'm not a huge fan of brown ales, I thought that I'd give it a shot. It poured with an absolutely massive, creamy, off-white head, which didn't dissapate over time. Aroma is full of malts. There is a slight nuttiness to the flavor which balances well with a slight cocoa-ish malt taste. Not overly rich but this means the beer could be a good session brew. Nice medium body is also present. Worth a shot in my opinion."
"Poured a nice deep brown color with a light brown head and decent lace. Smell is a nice roasted malt. Taste is also a nice roasted malt, with nutty overtones, slight coffee. Mouthfeel is perhaps a bit dry with a medium heaviness. A nice alternative when a porter is a bit much. Good drinkability for a cool evening. A fairly simple brown ale, but done right."
"A decent Brown, easy to drink but not particularly exciting. Malty aroma with a hint of citruicy hops. Red brown in color, with a thin tan heat that quickly recedes to nothing. Flavor is good if not overly engaging. Malty and a touch sweet with a hint of caramel. Hopping is noticable without standing out too much."
"Pours a dark amber, clear liquid with a nice off white foamy head. Good lace on the glass as the brew disappears. The smell is somewhat of a sweet caramel, with a hint of a toasted nuts. Tasteis a nice, nutty flavor, with some sweetness, and a slight hop bitterness. A good toasty flavor comes out in the end. Decent mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable. There is nothing that really blew me away about this beer, but then again nothing that would drive me away. A good session brown ale."
"Alas, the beer is a bit thin, and for some reason I can taste the alcohol a lot more than I'd expect for a 5.4% ABV brown ale."
"Mild lemon and lime bitterness and a taste of pear bandy round out the authentic Nut Brown style."
"A bronze body is topped with a very full off-white head. Decent lacing from the residual and lots of very nice aromas come from the rich malting. The nut sense is there along with some decent fruit notes as well. The somewhat thin body gives nice sweet malt flavor and the fruit comes into the taste as well as it did in the smell. Good drinkability."
"Poured a nice deep brown as one would expect. Aroma was malt with some nutty notes along with a faint hint of roasted barley. Head was thick and off white in color. Taste was mainly caramel with a nut finish highlighted by just a touch of bitterings. Felt a little bit weak in the mouht, beer seemed a little thin. For some reason the balance of malt, nut and bitter just didn't seem to work for me. Decent beer but nothing to truly seek out."
"Overall, a slightly better than average example of the style. While not horrific, there are a number of better brown ales to be found and savored."
"Nothing overwhelming about this brew. Pretty solid and well balanced. Has a nutty flavor (walnuts) along with some caramel. A bit of hops that seem to provide little flavor in the beer. I don't notice any alcohol taste in it. Pretty ordinary but easy to drink and still tastes good just not great."
"It's pretty murky brown in color and the head is tan and medium sized. The aroma is a little bit of nuts and caramel. Flavors are smooth and pretty enjoyable....nutty caramel, and some hop character in the finish. Seemed a little overly sweet at times, and not well balanced. It's pretty enjoyable though, worth a try, but there are many better nut brown ales out there."
"This beer pours a nice brown color with virtually no head and no lacing on the way down the glass. The aroma is a pleasant malt with hints of nuts. The flavor was a smooth maltiness with hints of chocolate and nuts. Like most brown ales I've had it isn't very heavily hopped and would probably benefit from more of a hop flavor. Overall a good beer, but there are better."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a thin but persistant head that produces some lace on the glass. Nose is buscuity and nutty... predominantly malt, but with a bit of herbal hop backing. Flavor is malty, with bread, nuts, and a backing touch of coffee. Finishes with a bit of hop bitterness and a slight alcohol flavor. Has a meduim body and low carbonation. This is an average or slightly above average brown ale."
"Moderately carbonated reddish-mahogany liquid, crystal clear with small bubbles forming a thin beige head which tends to stay around. Nose is dominated by chocolate, raisins, and prunes, similar to a strong ale or barleywine. Malty sweetness and mild flavor hops gives way to cocoa and round english hops in the wet finish. Very little astringency, and a somewhat firm, syrupy mouthfeel. Not being a big fan of American style brown ales, I was pleasantly surprised by the complexity of this beer, however I would much prefer Bell's Best Brown over any other beer of this style."
"Deep mahogany with a creamy light tan head that holds well and keeps a very nice collar throughout the glass. The nose expresses a sweet cocoa-ish maltiness and a floral hoppiness. The body is medium with a very fine carbonation that caresses the tongue. The flavor consists of a semi-sweet chocolatey malt that's well infused with floral and lightly citrusy hop flavor. It becomes sweeter with more cocoa-ish & toffee notes as it warms in the mouth, but they're quickly pushed aside by a rising, solid bitterness that ushers in a dry finish. More grassy hop flavor lingers in the finish. Very nicely balanced with the malt and hops working together but also appearing seperately throughout the tasting. Well done. I found it more enjoyable as it warmed and bitterness gave way to more of the sweetness of the malt. Definitely an American brown ale."
"Part of and Arcadia sampler: This was a pretty good nut brown, poured a dark brownish-amber with virtually no head or lacing. Strong nut aroma. Flavor was not very rich but was nutty with some malt. Lightly bitter and nutty finish. A better-than average brew."
"The beer pours a nice somewhat murky deep ruby red, satisfactory beige head, with decent lace. Nose is malt, slight hints of roasted grain, very light nut-sweet tones also noticed. Begins malt sweet, the top thin, the finish is discriminatingly hopped and discerningly acidic, the aftertaste dry, and long lasting. Drinkable, but pretty much an average Nut Brown, but then thats nothing to get upset about."
"A very enjoyable brown ale.  Pours out to a very dark brown with a light nutty caramel taste.  The hops don't overpower this, but really make it finish nice.  I could see making a session or two or three...out of this one."
