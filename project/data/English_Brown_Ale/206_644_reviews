"I am with the Brothers on this one.  I sure wish it was still available here in Central FL.  This brown ale is scrumptious."

"O: Very good brown ale. Excellent profile and flavors."
""
""

"Overall - Classic English brown ale. Not big on browns like these, but it's better than Newcastle. Just not enough interesting flavors going on here."
""
""
"overall i'm glad to get through this sampler pack. although the sale of this beer provides some funding to a local burn foundation, it doesn't make the beer any better."
""
""
""
"Mouth feel is about medium. Lighter than the dark color might indicate."
""

"O- I have never had a English style brown and this beer wants to make me try some other to better understand the style. It has some of the same qualities of a good porter or stout. Overall this a good beer and for a ""fireman"" themed brewery I was impressed."

"Overall this is a very drinkable brown ale. The dry malty character mixes well with the bitterness of the hops. I was a little surprised by this one!"
"O- Was pleasantly surprised with the well rounded taste of malts, hops and carmel. Would like it to have a little more flavor and some bite, but a decent effort and an easy drinking brown. Would have another-"
"Overall a very unexpected treat from this brewery. I have another beer by them and hopefully it's as good."
"Overall this is an above average beer, that is worth a try. Again Im not much on beers like this but it was still good, and it supports firefighters which since I am one is always awesome."
"O: The smell promised a lot but the beer failed to deliver. It is just weak, not enough substance to it, either flavor- or mouthfeel- wise to balance out the initial punch of flavor. Total disappointment. Not bad, just not very good or worth drinking."
"12 oz bottle into pint glass. Light brown in color. Alittle lace is found on the glass. Small malty aroma. Taste is watery caramel, toffee and then nothing. Watery feel, brown sugar, little else. Sessionable, if you like watery, barely carbonated beer."
"D - I had more than one and would again."
"This beer pours out as a clean looking brown color. The head is a shade of tan that doesn't have too much retention. The smell is semi sweet with some roasted nuts in the aroma. The taste is nutty upfront and fades into a light roasted flavor in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is pretty light very drinkable. Overall this is a decent brown ale."
"O: A nice, if slightly sour, brown ale. 3.5"
"Overall its a good beer. Could have a few of these easily and would be in the fridge if it was available."
"Perhaps I got a bad batch; it seemed to work better in their mixed offering."
"Pass on this one."
"good mouthfeel and very drinkable. Would buy this anytime, great job."
"However, it had great mouthfeel and I felt like I could sit and drink this all day."
"Pours a deep amber hue, flirting with brown, but when backlit is ruby red. The aroma is strictly caramel with a touch of sweetness. The flavor is also packed with caramel with a dash of buttery toast. It light in body and pretty bland overall. More representative of an English brown having little bitterness, light on hops, and just not enough depth for me."
"The first time I had Backdraft Brown, I was blown away. I still am! It's an insanely tasty brown ale. It has all of the characteristics I look for in the style. Highly recommended!"
"An easy to drink brown ale, will definitely consider it again."
"Taste is somewhat light and creamy with a bit of chocolate up front and some nutty notes on the finish. Sweet notes are more evident on the finish than elsewhere on the palate. A light bitterness peaks through briefly. Feel is a bit full yet a bit sweet which keeps the drinkability in check. A decent Brown Ale yet quite simple in nature."
"Somewhat thin mouthfeel, but very crisp. A little too highly carbonated, however. I was really impressed with this beer until...I took a sip. Mildly drinkable but not particularly memorable."
"D - This has a great look and smell, but the thin body and uninteresting taste disappointed me."
"Served in a pint glass. Color is a moderately-dark brown with a tan head that persists for a bit before falling. Nose is quite plain with a bit of caramel and bread. The taste is bready with some light sweetness. Decent body with normal carbonation levels. Really just don't have too much to say about this one."
"Nice balance of caramel and coffee notes. Hoppy but not overdone, finished with a pleasing coffee taste. To bad it was only a tasting, I could have had a few of these, mostly due to the fact that it drank nicely and is only 4.5%. I could see this as an anytime of the year beer, but I think I would prefer this in the Fall to Winter. Even at 4.5% it made me feel very comfortable."
"Drinkability: Wish I could walk into any bar & find this on tap. I'd drink several pints & sleep like a baby."
"Pretty good, not great."
"This isn't a great brown ale, but it's a very good one. For something which is named after a type of fire which is supposed to catch you by surprise (backdraft), I was expecting a bit more from the intensity of the flavors. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent, so that more than compensates for this shortcoming. I would definitely get this beer again even if it isn't an excellent one."
"Drinkability: This is an outstanding brown ale, one of the best I've had. Very drinkable, flavorful, and sessionable- I definitely recommend this one."
"D - Goes down smooth and having another one could very easily be done."
"Drinkability: This is an extremely drinkable, extremely sessionable beer and one of the better brown ales I've had. I could definitely see myself getting this again and really enjoying it."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a small head. Smell is of malts, some toffee. Taste is good, malts, toffee, and nuts. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this makes for a quality brew."
"Hook & Ladder Backdraft Brown is overall pretty tasty. Mouthfeel is lacking, but the flavors are right on, carbonation is complimentary. Not stand out...but what brown ale is. I think they definitely nailed the style."
"Low alcohol, good flavor, and really easy to drink. A very nice brown ale."
"Overall this was a decent brown ale that I would have no problem revisiting in the future."
"Poured a dark/clear with a decent head, aroma I thought smelled like a cleaning solution? and first sip was a little metalic, or soapy, kinda hard to describe, it was a clean glass too. But, once it warmed up a touch, it was a whole new beer. Dark roasted malt, with what seems to be a spicy dark belgian. turned out to be a nice Brown....but wait for a warmer brew, maybe upper 40's."
"I wouldn't go too far out of my far this one. It's not bad at all, just nothing tremendously noteworthy. I have to give the company a nod for their charity concept. This is a more well crafted beer than their golden. Thumbs in the middle for me on this one."
"Overall, I thought this beer was average for an English Brown Ale. The unbalanced flavor and overcarbonation make it a tough one to drink."
"Nice looking clear auburn body. Thin beige head. Spotty lace. Pretty weak aroma. Light brown malts and light roasted notes. Toffee based malt flavor gives the beer a nice base. A little roastiness and some light ""candied"" flavors give this beer a little depth. Unique and decent enough. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated."
"A brown ale is right up my alley but not as dark as I prefer. Poured an iced tea color with a fair head. Smell of faint caramel, nuttiness, and a slight hop pine. Taste is smooth but kind of one dimensional with a nutty sweetness on the tongue and a touch of hops in the back. Certainly a step up from their golden ale."
"D= well, I'm not blissfully impressed but this will be some decent stuff for the next few days in the absence of any porter's or stout's at our local beer store lately."
"D - A nice tasting brown ale. It certainly is worth a try. Brown ale isn't my favorite style but it is a good one for a session style and Hook & Ladder has a quality brown ale to fit the bill."
"I like this beer. Have only tried it a couple of times, but I could easily see myself revising my rating to boost it up a little. Would make a nice session beer."
"Drink a very drinkable beer. A good beer if you want to have more than a few."
"D - Low to easy drinking ABV. The flavors are just a bit edgy for me to session. A hair filling. The carbonation bite is bit unpleasant at times."
"overall, this is a decent brew i enjoyed a lot"
"D: Delicious English Brown that's oh-so-drinkable. I have to compliment Hook & Ladder on how easy this goes down."
"D- Goes down pretty easy but I'm not a fan of the roastiness or thin body of this Brown."
"Decent atmosphere. Appearance is pretty solid, although not all that exciting; and nose is pretty basic and subtle, but pleasing. Good flavor... again, nothing complex, but nice combination of components. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"This would make a good session beer. I will definately have this beer again. It has some very nice elements for a great price."
"D. Great brown ale, I like how it starts sweet, then goes slightly bitter, and has a short lasting sweet aftertaste."
"An all around solid Brown Ale. A sessionable treat."
"A decent brown ale. Brown ales are not my favorite and this one is okay."
"Review notes taken on: 7/29/09"
"Very tasty, great take on the style. Good drinkability."
"I've had it on tap as well, and like most ales it goes down better on draft."
"-enjoyed this very much and think everyone should at least buy a single if available"
"Drinkability: A good brown ale. Not a total standout, but certainly a sessionable beer."
"Pours a dark ruddy mahogany brown hue with a light beige head that forms thick and dwindles slowly. Chunks of scattered lacing are left clinging to the sides of my glass. Aroma a roasted caramel accent about it with light herbal hops, with a nutty finish to it all. Flavors are a muddled watery mess of roasted malt and weird chocolate caramel coated fruit, no real hops the finish tastes like muddy cocoa. Mouthfeel is watery and pretty thin for a brown, but finishes with the cloying residual sugar muddled mess I tried to describe in the flavor. I'm guessing this is a contract brew by High Falls but I'm not sure. Drinkability overall is pretty weak not something I will ever look for again."
"Pretty bland as far as I am concerned. Not bad, but nothing to really recommend."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color with a lighter brown along the edges of the glass. 1/2 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of yeast cleanliness, slight sweet malt, hint of hops, and a hint of roasted malt. Fits the style of an English Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of slight roasted malt, sweet malt, slight grain, hint of hops, and yeast cleanliness in the finish. Overall, good looking beer with a better flavor than aroma."
"Very nice beer. on of my favorite styles."
"Thanks to my pal chaz over at realbeer for this bottle. Poured into my Sly Fox shaker glass, the ale appears a clear medium chestnut color with about two fingers of dense, lingering light ecru foam. Aromas and flavors are of medium roasted grains, lightly nutty (hazelnuts), milk and bittersweet chocolate, nicely roasted and subtly smokey coffee beans, a good dose of caramel malt. Backdraft is approaching full bodied for the style with adequate carbonation. A tasty example of an English Brown. Newcastle should be ashamed."
"D- pretty good brown, easy drinking and smooth with enough hops to add spark. not at all boring, but not super complex either."
"D - Smooth brown ale with enough malt complexity to make it interesting. I could go for a few pints of this."
"D: A nice beer for any time.. It could go really well with some bratwurst and sauerkraut."
"i read the beeradvocate review with this beer and agree...very interesting beer...will buy again and spend more time with it....i think hook & ladder are on to something with this one..."
"The mouthfeel is good, low carbonation a nice chewy body, still just light enough to be sessionable. Very nice...plus some of the proceeds go helping burn victims...nice."
"Pours out a dark brown beer with ruby tones when viewed through lights.Has a decent malty smell to it,,no hop aroma to mention. Taste is malty but dry,,no sweetness to mention,,slightly astringent,,very little in the way of hops. Mouthfeel is pretty nice,,not too much or too little..Very drinkable."
""
"I like this one. I poured this into a pint glass, the head stuck around a short while. I had this after the Ember Amber from Hook and Ladder and I am much happier with this brew. It's everything a brown ale should be really. I can taste the hops ever so slightly and its roasted malty flavor is mild as well. It's not an overbearing taste at all, nor does it have an offensive smell. Some improvements could be the overall taste; however, it's not a severe problem."
"Notes: Overall nice beer and a standout from the mixed 12-pack."
"Very light flavor. Watery. The chocolate is just about the only noticeable flavor, and even that's watery. I'm not impressed. Good looking beer, but it's all downhill after that. Hopefully Ember Amber fares better."
"D = This is an easy drinking beer and one which would flow easily one after the other or on just about any evening."
"Eric"
"Pours a very nice dark brown with reddish hue with a 1/2"" tan head. Decent lacing and retention. Mild aroma dominated by the roasted malt smell, some sweetness. Slightly better that average flavor for the style, maltly semi-sweet, maybe a little chocolate hint, minimal hop bitterness. The beer has a nice feel and easy to drink in quantity"
"Pours a nice dark brown, but with no head or lacing to speak of. Nice scent, hints of malt, but no deep earthy aroma or real malt/hop characteristics. Nice taste, malty, very little hint of the citrus hop presence they promised on the label with Cascalde hops; not the deep earthy ent draught I like as a brown ale. Goes down nice and smooth with a tiny sweet finish. Not the best brown ale, although I would never turn one down, either."
"Pint arrived with little or no head, dark brown colored liquid. Aromas of sweet malts but not much else. Typical brown ale flavor, slightly sweet and roasted malt, with a touch of bitterness at the end. I would call this medium to light bodied, and kind of thin, average mouthfeel. Good drinkibility, smooth sessional."
"Poured brown with some ruby red tints when held to the light. Average tan head that dissipates quickly. Aromas were slightly malty & sweet, but rather faint. Mouth-feel was thin, but average for the style. Flavors were of mild caramel and toasted malts with hints of dry grass. Little hop character, although balance seems ok as far as drinkability goes. This one didn't do much for me - it was drinkable and not at all bad, but it's nothing I could recommend as a good brown ale."
"Drinkability: Light, crisp, and moderately flavorful. Easy to drink several of these in a sitting. Not a stellar beer, but one I'll definitely consider when I'm not looking for something more expensive."
"This one just needs some more flavor."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable, solid session beer."
"Overall-nothing about this beer really wowed me, an ok beer but not great. Disappointed."
"Overall, it's decent and drinkable."
"Final Thoughts - Hook & Ladder provides a decent entry into the brown ale category but it lacked individuality or flare. In a world of micro brews, beers like this can get lost. The price point worked well $6.99 for a six pack, which will make me give some more of these brews a second chance. I will grab a couple more of thse in the future."
"I was not to impressed overall, so I will not go out looking for this beer in the future."
"D- Not a great beer, but nothing terribly wrong with it either. I would not search for this beer."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours brown with a half-inch off-white head. Head retention is OK, lacing is good. It smells like caramel malt, nuts, toasted malt and brown sugar. The taste is similar to the aroma, however the beer also has a nice bitter hoppy finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick and has average carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's smooth and easy to drink. I think it would be a decent choice as an occasional session beer. Overall I think it's a decent brew, I'd drink it again in the future."
"If nothing else Hook and Ladder #2 makes a very impressive looking beer."
"Drinkability: nice sessionable brown ale."
"D - Less sweet than Newcastle, but it is a nice beer"
"D: A solid Brown Ale that makes a worthy session brew."
"D: Good not great, but a good beer when a group is coming over as it's solid good without being over the top at all. Not very interesting but has it's use."
"Drinkability: no off-flavors, in fact , flavors are too subtle. I'm not a big fan of brown ales, but this one seems average at best."
"This beer poured a dark brown color with slightly off-white head that was approximately two fingers and dissipated quickly. The aroma was of caramel, toffee, and roasted malt. The flavor was pretty much the same as the aroma. The mouthfeel of the beer was medium-bodied. This was a nice beer that was definitely sessionable. Nothing spectacular, but good."
"This brew is a pleasant surprise. A very drinkable and tasty brown ale. I'd drink this one again."
"Overall- Much better than their Lighter. Decent Brown. I would drink again."
"The beer fits the bill for an American brown, but could use some help in the malt flavors and roundness in the body. Still, I like the dry attenuation, but the acidic flavors and feel hurts in the end."
"(rated Aug 5, 2008)"
"Nikki"
"Despite its ""burnt""character and other small detractors, there is something of a drinkability - maybe its general mildness. Overall, a lackluster brown."
"D: Probably one of the better browns I can recall. The rating says it all. You certainly cant go wrong here and a case will certainly not go to waste."
"Poured a nice dark brown color with a 2 finger tan head with some lacing. It smells of roasted nuts and vanilla. It tastes of the same, roasted nuts, hints of malts with a somewhat buttery finish. the after taste is just a little warming nice balance, carbonation matches nice with the flavor. halfway done with the glass i start to taste green apple skins so slight hops but just barely a hint. The mouth feel is good, It goes down nice, could drink a few of these and not get bored. Overall a pretty good nut brown"
"The mouth starts well but thins a bit at the end."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink but for the wrong reasons. I expected more flavor from such a complex smell. This beer tricked me."
"D- Not a bad brown, but there are many more out there that I would rather spend my money on."
"Drinkability: I had 3 or 4 of these, and it was certainly a highly sessionable brew, especially if you're into the style. Nothing mindblowing, but pretty good overall."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Light in body, well lighter than it should have been. The beer has an overall watery quality to it, just not much there. Easy to drink, probably a good session beer, but I feel it definitely lacks in body, needs something more. This is one that I'll not be picking up, nice to try, but again I'm glad I didn't spend money on it. Nothing comdem it but nothing redeeming either."
"Hook & Ladder Backdraft Brown not only didn't set my world ablaze, it left me cold. I think it's great when breweries give a portion of their proceeds to such worthy causes as local fire and rescue teams. It would be even better if they would maximize those charitable contributions by brewing beer that people want to buy a second time."
"Definitly recommended for an American micro."
"D - a good brown ale."
"Tried this one on tap at Drink, thanks Travis! Delivered to my table, this beer was an appropriately beer-bottle brown color. The head was impressive, pillowy, two fingers thick and it both retained and laced well. The aromas were very faint, toasted malt and an ill-defined toffee/caramel sweetness. The flavors were toasted malt and nuts at first but a little floral hops showed up later. Rather simple but not unlikable. The mouthfeel was average but it does come off as quite sessionable."
"T/M/D- A smooth malt flavor initially, mocha, brown sugar and notes of apple and melon. Bright, lively carbonation and a light/medium body. Very good drinkability. Simple, but a damn good brown ale."
"This beer poured a deeper brown than I anticipated. It was actually almost opaque. There was about an inch off white colored head that quickly disappeared. There is definitely a malt scent to the beer and a very slight metallic after taste. The drinkability is definitely there. This is a good brown ale."
"Recommended with a good burger or marsala steak"
"Pours a nice, light beige head of over two fingers width. Great sasparilla brown with clear garnet highlights. Good, sticky lacing. Thearoma has good roasted and even faintly smoked malts. Then some very subtle coffee and shitty chocolate notes that would come from an American advent calendar. The taste is pretty bland for any brown ale. Light roasted malts, maybe a touch of coffee grounds. Very watery. The hops are the only flavor that lingers mixed with some burnt malt flavors. Would be sessionable if it had more flavor."
"Really nothing special from this brew. As far as a brown ale goes, it doesn't compare to any of the more well-established in the style. Nothing bad, just nothing to make it stand out amongst the crowd."
"I probably won't seek this one out, but its worth a try."
"Served in a pint glass at Bohemian Pizza in Litchfield, CT, this brew has a dark root beer color with a thin but steady light tan head and excellent lacing. The aroma is a mild coffee malt with a touch of citrus wheat. The taste is a fairly bright and aqueous walnut and sour apple, some light malt and floral hops. Spritely carbonation, easy drinking. Some caramel sweetness at the finish. Not bad, not great."
"drinkability - Very good brown ale, easy drinking, would try this again."
"D: On the whole this is a good beer. It didn't reinvent the wheel, but it's drinkable."
"Notes: Decent,I would have it again. Slightly thin mouth feel with some creamy texture."
"Full and creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable, a sessionable beer."
"Solid C+/B- Brown ale!"
"Cheers bitches..."
"D: It's OK, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"Dark brown colored ale with a thick foamy head.Aroma is toasted almond.Taste is nutty with a slight aftertaste of coffee.Very creamy,smooth and drinkable.I can see myself buying this again and would recommend to my buddies!!Good job by Hook and Ladder Brewing company."
"This tasting was from the last bottle of a six pack and may have suffered from age. I do remember very much enjoying the first sample. But I'll let the chips fall where they may and you can judge this one for yourself."
"Had a sample of this last night at the beer tent at Taste of Syracuse. Deep, clear chestnut appearance with a tan head and good lacing. Aroma of hazlenuts and butterscotch. Taste is balanced and smooth. The hop bitterness is there but the flavor is never overpowering. Again hazlenuts and butterscotch with a hint of chocolate. Medium bodied with good drinkability."
"d - nice brown ale and i would have rated this a 4.5 but it almost became too sweet towards the end. overall a very good beer. while the hops and the malts are each very pronounced, it's almost like they're fighting for supremacy with each taking their turn on the tongue."
"This is a solid brown ale offering. Good crystal and chocolate malts are featured in the initial taste. Excellent hop balance. Not as sweet as the smell would suggest, but not exactly dry either. The bitter hop balances the beer during the swallow. The aftertaste is well-balanced with some dry mocha flavors and mild hop. The body is this beer's weak point--it is far thinner than a typical ABA. Good carbonation."
"Taste follows with the same, but without the tin (thank god). Very light malts and a decent amount of hops. Altogether an easy drinking brown ale that has decent balance."
"The beer pours a nice brown color with a 1/2"" tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a roasted and caramel malt that's a bit sweet, yet dry to the nose. The taste is average. It has a very dry, roasted flavor that is quite thin and watery. It has some caramel flavor as well, but it's faint at best. The mouthfeel is average also. It is a low/medium bodied beer with a little too much CO2. This is an average brown ale. It needs more crystal malt flavor and more body. It's too highly carbonated with little malt character."
"This is a very pleasant brown ale, nothing exotic or overly complex, but a very solid beer. It pours a ruby dark color that is far from opaque. Plenty of light makes its way through. The beer is very clear with a tannish and smallish head, hardly any lacing. The aroma is roasted malts with some sweetish cherry notes as the beer warms. The sweet malts make themselves more pronounced at things settle. There might be a touch of spice in the aroma as well, but you need to let things settle down first. The taste is roasted malts, some sweeter caramels, some slightly burnt malts, a little brown sugar, toffee, with a bit of dryish hoppiness in the finish. This is a slightly medium bodied beer, a touch creamy on the tongue, with some charred flavors in the aftertaste. Not bad, but not my favorite brown ale either."
"The taste is a plesant malt with a nice balance of the hops - very drinkable, but also equally predicatable which could go both ways depending on your disposition. For me... I'm more than happy to go back for number two!"
"Body is a touch thin. I tend to like my browns with a thicker mouthfeel -- seems to mesh better with the flavor profile. Otherwise, a highly drinkable ale. Well balanced."
"Pour a reddish-black, like a porter with a decent but quick-evaporating head. The aroma is also porter-like, with a strong dark malt character, perhaps black patent malt. The flavor is likewise dark, with a slight smokiness, a trace of cherry. The mouthfeel is disappointingly watery considering the powerful color and dark aroma. I'd call this more of a porter than a brown ale. It is drinkable, but not one to lose sleep over."
"The mouthfeel is medium but with very little carbonation. Overall this one is well blended between the hops and malts, so nothing really stands out."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Color is very deep brown, almost opaque. One inch khaki colored head quickly disappeared. Smells of roasted malt. Tastes of roasted malt, with some bready notes and a hint of caramel. Faint metallic after taste. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Very easy to drink. A good brown ale."
"This is a great all around beer."
"I had with a bowl of chili and enjoyed every second of it."
"A decent session ale, but too tame to be anywhere near remarkable."
"Pours an extremely dark brown, borderline black, with a fluffy two finger tan head that dies down to a thin layer of bubbles. Spotty lacing left on the sides of the glass. Smell is pretty nutty with hints of caramel and chocolate malts. A fair amount of citrus hops find their way in the nose as well. If you stick your nose down there deep enough you can catch a nice coffee aroma too. Taste begins with a light nut flavor and some toasted grains. Some earthy hops and molasses with a woody aftertaste. Pretty basic flavor overall, nothing too impressive. The feel is fairly smooth with some bite here and there. Light to medium body with a full carbonation. Nice drinkable brown ale, I've had better, but I certainly wouldn't turn this one down."
"My final thoughts: This beer came out swinging and had me very impressed at first. But as i sipped I lost interest and thought of it as a regular local brew which it isn't. My hats off to all firefighters currently or formally in uniform. Cheers!"
"Very drinkable. Could be nice to session. Flavorful, without going too far."
"At this point i wouldnt recommend it... Maybe I'll try another. I hate to knock down a local, but this is pretty bad."
"D- Easy to drink and not very impressive over all. To me it tasted like a old boston lager with cascade hops."
"I sampled a pint of this brew on-tap during a recent trip back to the USA. It's a deep, chestnut brown color, with a whispy tan head. It's really a fairly average-looking brown ale. The aroma is of faintly roasted grains and a little malt. Very little hop aroma. The taste, though, is more intense, with the roastedness really coming through. There's a bitterness in the finish, and a lot of grain throughtout the taste. A very low crabonation helped the beer. Medium to full in body. This is a drinkable, and very applealing, if not extraordinary beer."
"The drinkability is great I will look for more of this and spread the word, Prosit, MK"
"Call me easy to please, but this was one tasty beer. Gorgeous deep brown color with a nice foamy head that left quickly and laced the glass a bit as it emptied. Carmel, roasted malt in the nose with a hint of Cascade hops (smelled like a nice German Dunkel). Taste was roasted malt and a mild bitterness from the hops that balanced the taste nicely. Smooth is the operative word here. Very tasty, a touch sweet (but definitely not too much), rich mouthfeel and a flavor that was consistent throughout. Really a great go-to brown. Drinkable. Would make a nice session beer."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this isn't really a bad beer but it certainly wouldn't be the first brown ale that I would select."
"deep copper/ brown color with a thin off-white head. Aroma of light caramel and nuts - very light. The taste was some slightly roasty malts, a little more caramel, and a somewhat distracting sour/ acidic note. Perhaps it was the soapy taste from their pale ale that in this instance was masked somewhat by darker malts, but I'm not sure. Medium body and I am sure that I did not care for this beer, and did not finish it."
"D - This could work as a session beer because it is not offensive in any respect. Very easy to drink and the first one left me wanting to have another."
"nice brown...smooth. I was hoping for a little more bite, but overall very nice and balanced..."
"standard pint at Crystal City Sports Bar Alexandria"
"Started out good but then came up short. This one may be good for those who like a lighter brown ale, but that's not for me."
"Overall, a good beer that is sessionable as a brown ale. Balanced with no overpowering notes. Maybe not as strong as others of this style but very solid."
"Pours with a four finger light tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Almost black hints of mahogany highlights. The nose is roasted coffee. Light carbonation and medium body. Flavor is roasted coffee with some hoppiness. $1.50 for 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience, Concord, NH. Label is Hook & Ladder Brewing - contract brewed by Mercury."
"A 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. It was a fairly dark brown with faint red highlights. Thin head, but still a little lacing. Nice caramel aroma. Caramel taste, but way too sweet, like drinking a Coca Cola. Just not a very pleasant beer for me. I'm gonna feed them to my son-in-law."
"Man, what's up with these beers? I've tried all three and they reek of minerals and phenols. It's like the brewing water is all out of whack. The flavor has a bitter chocolate flavor and a dry finish, but the medicinal phenol taste throws everything off. It seems like there might be a decent brown ale hidden under the massive phenols."
"Pours a nice reddish brown from the bottle with a tall and thick tan colored head that sticks around for a while and then laces the glass all the way down. It smells of deep roasted malts and balanced out with a piney hoppy bitterness for a nice Ale aroma. It tastes pretty good too with a deep roasted malt taste and a nice bitter and piny hoppy taste to balance out the flavor. It had a nice somewhat crisp mouthfeel and a good amount of carbonation. The drinkability is pretty good as I could have a few of these in a sitting and I would most likely get it again because for $7 for a 6pack, it really isn't a bad choice at all."
"Not my favorite brown ale but still worth buying again. This brew is just slightly lacking in complexity."

"pours a deep brown in color with a one inch light tan head with some nice rings of lace. smells of roasted malts with a hint of coffee. taste is same rich roasted malt and dry not sweet at all with a slightly lingering bitter after taste. medium bodied with good carbonation. one of my favorite styles of beer this one comes near the top on all counts."

"12oz brown bottle from Hannaford in Gardiner. Pours dark copper-brown, nearly opaque, with a quarter inch of light tan head. Smells malty, roasty, and somewhat nutty with strong coffee and chocolate notes. Tastes roasty, with dark chocolate and coffee playing big parts with some caramel and hints of nut. On the fuller side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Rather drinkable - one sip most definitely invites another. An excellent brown ale, and one of the best I've had."
"Overall, a decent brown ale that works quite well being enjoyed in the winter months, but is a bit more full than it should be."
"I was a sucker for this beer because of the firefighting theme. It pours a deep red/brown with a frothy tan head. The aroma is hoppy with bits of chocolate, caramel and other dark malts. The flavor is crisp and fairly dry with some of the same malty flavors as in the aroma. The maltiness is overpowered a bit by the hop bitterness and flavor. Overally it's a pretty decent beer, and the charitable donation isn't bad either."
"Taste starts off malty and smooth upfront with a lingering mild hop bitterness and roasty taste. A second sip detects the Cascades better upfront with only a slight hint of roastiness. Quite drinkable for a brown ale. Not quite my choice though but I could drink this in a session."
"Great microbrew from a Maryland brewpub. Surprised to find it here in CT, but damn glad it was. I wish I could get a growler of it someplace."
"Drinkability- A decent beer, nothing special though."
"I've been disappointed with ""browns"" in the past, notably New Castle. Overbearing, over-carbonated and overpriced. Backdraft Brown shatters all and will leave you begging for more. Has a welcomed nose of coffee and chocolate but is far more palatable than porters with the same aromas. Finish is a light coating on your palate that lingers a bit like Guinness but surprisingly does not compete with any food. Had it with garlic mussels and a burger and fries. The single-handedly best all-purpose compliment to food from a brown."
"On tap-Dark brown pour w/a little lacing. Faint Roasted malt aroma. Kind of a standard brown, roasted malt & nuts, had some carbonation & a little bit of a smoked flavor to it, but really nothing special. Not nearly as good as their wheat-surprised it is rated higher that the wheat (which is really a golden ale). Kind of thin mouthfeel."
"Per H&L website: Cascade hops."
"D- A good example of the style, goes well with food."
"Dark Brown color, small head. A medium bodied brown ale. Very malty and slightly sweet. Slight hop bitterness. Nicely balanced. Good flavor, nutty. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is nutty and slightly bitter, Nice Nut brown ale."
"Flavor is malty, with some toffee to it. Roastiness is a little underdone, so this beer comes off a bit too much like a pale ale. The balance is nice, with only light hopping and mild estery flavors, but boring and a little too plain. Body is medium, with rather high carbonation. Not terrible, but not up to par with the others in the tasting."
"12 oz bottle. No freshness dating found. Firetruck and Dalmation on the label, gotta like that. Shiny medium clear brown color. Bubbly beige head. Smell was pleasant toasted carmel, nutty and inviting. Taste followed up smooth and strong. Very rich toasted carmel malt, just a hint of chocolate and sweet hazlenut. No off flavors for me. Creamy and rich for the first half of the glass. It just got a touch watery on the finish, but maybe I didn't drink it fast enough, for that reason I gave it 3.5 drinkability. I would reach for this one again. A local company is starting to put these in Florida beer stores. Fine idea by me. It's worth a try. Very simialer to Smuttynose's Old Brown Dog Ale, and that's saying something."
"The pour a deep clear brown with a decent sized head, frothy in texture and a light tan in color, the lace forms a decent sheet upon the glass. Nose is malt dominated, crisp, fresh and sweet with the start also sweet and nicely malted, top is a bit thin for my taste. Finish is strongly acidic, hops are plentiful and spicy, dry lingering aftertaste, a drinkable beer, but just a bit more body need to please me."
"Notes: I could definitely vision myself sitting down and making this a session brew. Every once in a while a beer comes along and tweaks my fancy ... this is one."
"Pours a ruby brown color with a decent off-white colored head. On the nose the aromas were of toffee and caramel, and slightly nutty. On the palate you get more toffee and caramel, slight sweet coffee flavor, hint of chocolate, hop bitterness. Overall a very good brown ale."
