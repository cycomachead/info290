"Overall, a fine brown ale. It's easy to drink and hits the taste and look well."
""
""
"Moderately dark brown ale. Pours very little to no head. Smell is of smoke and malt. Taste is sweet and malty up front, a little smokiness, maybe a little fruit. Mouth feel is thin and moderate carbonation. Overall an above average brown ale. Enjoyable."
""
"I haven't experienced many brown ales other than Newcastle Brown Ale. I found this one to be very different. Deep brown in the glass with sweet nutty and malty aromas. Taste was mostly dominated by sweetness with malt flavours but otherwise a little bit thin. Mouthfeel fine with good carbonation. Overall a good beer but I don't have many reference brown ales to compare it to. I'd drink it again but probably won't remember it in a month. I think that sums it up for me."

"O: Can't say I was expecting much from this one, but it actually turned out to be a pretty drinkable brown."
""

""

""
""
"Overall:  This is a pretty good brown ale.  Itâ€™s surprising in how much roasted flavors of coffee and subtle smoke there is.  Like I said, this reminds me more of a porter than a brown ale.  Tasty."
""
""
""
"Pours to a generous beige head and patchy lacing. Deep ruby brown color. Aroma is English toffee, nuts and a touch of chocolate and caramel. Flavor is more of the same with a nice balancing subtle hop note. Mouthfeel is light-medium and quaffable. A very good choice for Brown ales."

"3.75 | 85 | B+"

"Feel:  This is where I differentiate a brown ale from a porter/stout.  This does not come across as heavy or thick like a porter.  It was very drinkable as a brown ale."

"Malty and sweet, clear deep brown color. Modest foam, that dissipates rather quickly. Nice refreshing brown, very clean taste, none of the mustiness that occasionally accompanies malty beers."
""

""

""
""
""
""
"O - This is a clean, well-made, enjoyable brown ale with an American rather than English tilt. Not exceptional, but good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: good"
""
"A solid malty brown ale with pleasant coffee, hazelnut, chocolate and brown sugar accents."
""
"Pours a dark brown color with ruby edges and a finger of beige head. The head dissipates fairly quickly but leaves some nice lacing behind. The nose is slightly bready. The body is relatively hearty. The flavor is bready with a faint touch of maple. The finish is semi-dry."
""

""
""
""
"2) A smoother mouthfeel."

"Overall, pretty good, though I'm not sure I'd order it again if there were other more preferable beers on the menu."

"One of my go to brown ales. 7$ for a sixer at Sprouts in Poway, Ca. Cant beat that price and this is a decent brew. MUCH better then the Newcastle that is being sold over here in the states these days, and cheaper too. A medium bodied mouthfeel with biscuty undertones balanced by malts and nutty accents. Basic, but really good and you cant beat the price."

"The secret in this beer is the wonderful smell and I can't get enough of it."
""
"Good moderately high carbonation. Could be a little higher."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my second lost coast beer, I thought it was a bit better than the other. I think its a good session beer. I could drink a few of these. Its not good enough to be satisfying if you are only going to have one. Its just doesn't have enough in any category."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium body, near medium effervescence with just the right amount of tang/tingle to it. Easy to drink and not heavy at all. Good stuff."
""
"O - Very good brown ale. Almost as good as Avery's Ellie's brown ale. Good stuff and a great beer when you consider the price."

"O- It's nice and malty, but clean. Not oversweet, as well. This makes a good seasonal transition beer. Coming out of those strong dark winter beers, and hopping right on Pales and IPAs can be a bit shocking. This brew carries you gently into the spring."
"O: refreshing and tasty. I normally don't go for brown ales, so it's not one of my favorites, but still a solid beer."

"The flavors were malty with strong undertone of nuts. More nutty than I expected but not harsh or overpowering. This was the best beer of the day and I immediately sought it out at the local total wine for home consupmtion."
""
""
"Following then, the taste also drew me into much warmer climates, with regards to both body and S(e)oul, with hints of Hops which are unfortunately lacking in many of the Korean Lagers so prevalent in these parts. Dark but not heavy, Downtown Brown, as with all good beers, was able to transport me to a time and place far removed from my current set of local circumstances. A reliable go-to back home in Killa Cali., and now, for some blessed trade clause, here in South Korea too!"
""
""
"Really good beer, great aroma and flavor. Mouthfeel was pretty pretty disappointing."
"Overall: This is a very good brown ale, easy to drink and pleasant. It's simple in taste and smell, so it won't win any awards for being bold, dramatic and different. But sometimes you just want to drink something nice and easy. This is what this beer provides, and it does a really good job at it."
"Overall a good brown ale."
""
""
"Aftertaste: The aftertaste is great. It lingers on for a good three minutes. It's dry, and has a burnt chocolate flavor to it. For as cheap as this beer is, I would totally buy this again just to experience that aftertaste. The brewmaster made this beer to pair well with food. I can totally see where this would pair well with pork or beef. Well done, ladies!"

"Overall - Simple tasting brown ale but it's still good."
""
""
""
"Overall, I'm really impressed with this brown, certainly as a session beer. In fact, it may be too sweet with not enough hops to balance it out, but that's alright."
""
""
""
"Overall a very good, above average brown ale. I would actually prefer this beer over newcastle. Definitely worth picking up and trying. One of my favorites. Cheers."
"Overall: A nicely done, sweet and enjoyable brown ale. I'd have this again and may seek it out if I'm in the mood for something sweeter."
""
""
""
""
"Brew is a good sessionable brown that I am enjoying very much. Has nice flavor and is a good brew. Case worthy."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not bad but a bit unremarkable. I'd still have this over Newkie Brown any day."
""
""
""
""
""

"O - A decent brew. It didn't knock my socks but it certainly didn't offend. I'd be happy if I were served this again although it's not one I'll be seeking out."
""
""
""

"Tasty and great-feeling nut brown ale, and my first from Lost Coast. Thanks to Brian for letting me have one from his stash as this is one of his favorite session ales. Heard a lot of great things, happy to have finally tried it."
""
""
""
""
"I poured this nice brew into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer poured a magnificent head that was very tan looking almost brown itself. The beer was a nice mahogany color. The beer also produced heavy lacing. beer smelled slightly nutty but was not really all that fragrant. Taste was warm and inviting with just a slight sweet finish. I liked it and would buy again."
""
""
"O: certainly a decent beer, but given a choice of English brown ales I would opt for DuClaw's Euphoria instead."
""
""
""

"DOA"
"Over all: I liked it way more then the first time I would get it again no doubt. I think it could be a little more crisp but what the hey"

"This beer pours a clear brown with a thin head and no lace. It's aroma is coffee and caramel. The flavor has notes of roasted malt & caramel with honey and a hint of pepper as it warms. The mouthfeel is light-medium and drinkable. Lost Coast Downtown Brown is a good beer, recommended."
""
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is nutty, some malts and caramel. Taste is also full of nuts, some malts, different but tasty and easy drinking. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is an enjoyable beer."
""
""
""
"Overall - A decent to good brown. Sessionable, at the very least. It's a shame because it has a great flavor profile, but it's watered down character detracts from what could be a great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O - Smell was right on target for the style. Loses points in flavor for lacking solid malt structure. Refreshing enough for a summer cookout."
"Single finger head on a clear brown body with lots of lacing. Aroma is mostly sweet caramel malt with a subtle but and bread note. Flavor is more sweet caramel malt with a stronger nut and smokey presence. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall drinkable and unique for the genre."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Kind of malty. No flavors that stand out really -- which I think would be good for a newbie. I'd probably drink this again."
""
""
""
"Overall: a tasty brown ale that I would gladly drink again."
""
""
"O - Not a bad brown ale at all...this one stands just above average for me...nice chocolate and nutty flavors"
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear super dark brown with a 1 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and some slight chocolate aromas. Taste is of toasted malt and some nice nutty and chocolate flavor. This beer has a crisp level of carbonation with a prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good brown ale with some nice toasty and nutty flavors going on."
""
"O: Decent brown. This one lacks the depth of flavor or the fullness of body of some of the better brown ales on the market."
""
""
""
"Probably my favorite Brown Ale right now."
"Notes: medium in body, and has a soft mouthfeel. Flavors are well-balanced and the finish is clean. Nothing real exciting about this beer, but nonetheless pretty good. Easy to drink in numbers, it's definitely a session brown."
"O - Pretty good Brown ale, I'd get this again. My favorite at Lost Coast."

"Very smooth and even with caramel undertones."

"Trying the Down Town Brown from the Lost Coast. The beer has a good appearance...poured deep clear brownish amber with creamy thin white head that is not really lacing. The smeel includes deep sweet malts. The taste flowws the scent....sweet malty goodness with good hop balance. The mouthfeel is light medium body with decent carbonation. Overall this is a good Brown Ale and certainly recommend it."
"O: The beer that started it all for me. Like your favorite recliner, Downtown Brown can show you a good time regardless of the situation. I will be always ready to head Downtown!"
""
""
""

"I again have to fault the nose for making this beer seem less than it is, because it really does taste great and drink very easy. Enjoy!"

"Overall, I'm probably going to keep this in the fridge all winter long. It's sweet, probably the sweetest brew I've had, but I like that."
"Solid brown ale from Lost Coast up in Eureka."
"this beer pours a light brown and smells like hazel nut with other sweet aromas and taste great goes down smooth with not too much bitterness i would try this one again and i would alsi like to try there other brews but the taste does not last to long in your mouth."
"This is one of those middle-of-the road browns; hits most of the points but doesn't really wow me. Probably will pick up a bottle now and again but won't make a fuss if it becomes unavailable."
"Initially, I catch a touch of smokiness. The flavor becomes a mild dark crystal malt with a lightly sweet touch. Low hop that comes forward during the swallow--appropriate for the style. Thinnish body but with a lower carbonation level."
"O: This was a very drinkable brown that quenched my thirst nicely. Would drink again."
"Overall: Not the best, but respectable. Would like more balance to the beer; it's very malt forward."
"The color when poured into a pint glass was a clear medium dark brown with a nominal amount of tan foam. The smell of roasted malts and caramel was evident in the aroma. The taste was of roasted malts, caramel with a touch of coffee. A nicely balance ale that did not have a bitter finish. Pleasant tasting!"
"Overall, a bit odd, don't afree with the molasses in the smell, plenty of other stuff there to enjoy. The mouthfeel is a bit inconsistent. Average beer that could be better."
"O) If you're looking for a pretty good brown to enjoy while watching the game or sitting around the fire pit, this is a solid option."
"Picked this up a few years back on a road trip with my dad at a gas station in the middle of nowhere in northern California. Packs more flavors and complexity than many brown ales i've had, but the limp mouthfeel and lackluster appearance leave something to be desired. However, I could see this making for an excellent session beer due to the low carbonation and great taste."
"Sweetness is helpin' me with yet another random TJ's single. It pours a clear sunset garnet topped by a finger of dirty cream-white foam. The nose comprises watered-down molasses, very light roasted malts, dusty biscuits, and cocoa powder. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some light candi sugar and plenty of balsa. The added sweetness helps, but not too much. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly watery feel. Overall, a decent brown, nothing close to special, but also nothing entirely offensive, either."
"Nicely balanced brown ale. A touch more bitterness would be nice here but it certainly ainâ€™t bad."
"O - This is a decent Brown ale. Nice...not fantastic. Solid."
"Pours dark amber brown with minimal, lacy head. Smells of roasted coffee, malts, cocoa, brown sugar and nuts... very earthy. Tastes are heavily dominated by the roasted coffee flavor, but there are ample notes of cocoa, malts and some hop presence. Itâ€™s a medium-bodied beer, a good mixture of heavy and light. It finishes quick with a sweet aftertaste. A very nice brown ale."
"Not bad but a bit too sweet for my taste. I tend to prefer by brown ales more on the dry side, leaning in the Porterish direction."
"Pours a very light mahogany hue with average carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and sporadic lacing,the smell is toffee,maple syrup,brown sugar and nutcake,it has a light body with average carbonation and has tastes of berries,toffee,roasted nuts,maple syrup and finshed with a touch of sweet nutcake and overall this brew is no standout but very quaffable."
"Easy drinking and tasty enough. More body would showcase the malts better, but that's probably a difficult task without increasing the ABV."
"l."
"A slightly better then average brown ale pours a clear distinct brown with an almost non- existent head and zero lacing. The nose is of your basic brown ale variety but with a bit more coffee and nutmeg showing up. The taste is a little muddled and specific flavors are hard to distinguish. However it is very easy and pleasant to drink as there are no bad/harsh ""off"" flavors and the smoothness(read ""light carbonation"") of the brew is excellent."
"O- if it was a little more on the creamy vs carbonated side I would really love this beer, but its still a great beer"
"O - highly recommended brew for beer drinkers of all tastes."
"D: I feel really let down with this brew, nothing else to note really. Decent at best."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is a nutty brown coloring that is semi-translucent when held up to the light. Moderate amount of bubble action in the glass, so the carbonation appears to be up. The beer started with a short-stack head, but that beat feet before I could even sit down with the beer. The nose is caramel and nut sweetness, but not overpowering. Some earthy sweet as it sits for a bit, too. In mouth, the beer is a nice, light balance for the flavors the brew showcases. The beer is toffee and nutty sweetness, almost like eating a Rolo. Very flavorful, and does a decent job of not being overpowering with all the sweet characteristics. The body takes on a creamy texture as it warms, while still remaining light in mouth. The aftertaste is all nut, almost like a little Nutella, only liquid form. The finish is fairly smooth, and leaves no overbearing trace of the flavors. Decent beer. I could see this pairing up with just about anything, but especially spicy foods where the sweetness can really take over and help sooth your tastebuds. Easy to down, too, if your in that kind of mood."
"9/10"
"D-Thought I would enjoy the beer much more than I actually did after I cracked it open. Not something I would order on tap anywhere."
"D- As with most brown ales, this beer has a good drinkability. At 5% it is a bit of a session brown. This would be a great tailgating beer in the fall during college football season. A bit of toasted malt with the crisp air of fall, and some bar-b-que chicken would be fabulous. A beer that you could enjoy in a parking lot time after time."
"A drinkable brown. Not blown away, but I'd have another."
"Easy to drink and solid without being heavy, my boy Downtown Brown is better than his ""B" rating on BeerAdvocate. Even if only for the simple observation that I danced to a white rapper while drinking it."
"D- Not bad to drink and worth a try for sure. Not my favorite by any means or style."
"D - a nutty malt bomb, strong flavour and still pleasing all around"
"Drinkability: Yes. I could finish a six pack and fall asleep. A good winter beer with a bite. A fine alternative to a stout."
"Big thanks to Gobzilla for sharing this the night of my arrival to Cali. Served from bottle into a Firestone Walker sampler shaker. Poured red-orange with a minimal off-white head. Maintained good lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt and nutmeg. The flavor was of sweet malt, nutmeg, and slight roasted malt. It had a medium feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall the nutmeg turned me off from this brew. It might be a personal thing, but nutmeg and my palate do not get along very much. Other than the fact that it had a flavor I didn't like in it, it wasn't that bad. Worth trying."
"My dad really seems to like this beer and now I can specifically ask him why. It doesn't have the coffee or chocolate flavors I expected. It is a unique Brown Ale in my experience largely due to the dryness which might be repulsive to some."
"Poured a chocolate brown in color with a half finger of head and left a little lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was huge on the nuttiness but I also was able to detect some roasty character but hints of coffee and toffee. The flavor was a bit more chocolatey but had coffee roasty accents and a touch of nuttiness. The brew was medium in body with a nice amount of carbonation which had a chocolatey, sweet, roasty, and nutty finish. Downtown brown is better than I remember. I just wanted to revisit the lost coast line up. It drank good and was a soild brown ale."
"D: Surprisingly good, especially after having the Tangerine Wheat. For a brown ale, this is pretty decent."
"D- nice beer to drink. If you were to sit down with a group you could put down a number of these without feeling too full. Definitely one of the lightest brown ales i've had. Would drink again."
"Picked this up at a gas station somewhere in northern California. Pours a dark brown colour with small off-white head. Not too much lacing on the glass. Smells of very mild milk chocolate. Fairly sweet flavour. This is a lot more mild in flavour than many brown ales, but it is still nice. Fairly smooth mouthfeel."
"My overall impression is a good Malt to Hops Balance, leading to making it drinkable. While it is not best of the style that I have had, but it beats say newcastle by a wide margin for the style."
"Poured a clear dark mahogany with some decent off-white head that retained well. Smelled of dark, bready malts and a slight hoppiness. Nutty as an English brown should be, but with a decent amount of toasted malts and some earthy hoppiness. Light body and moderate carbonation with little aftertaste that finishes somewhat dry, but it is one I could drink all night. Very solid brew from a part of the country more known for it's weed than it's beer, but well worthy of seeking out."
"D- It's an enjoyable brown, one that I pickup quite often. There are things I wish were different with it, but I enjoy it."
"Brown as brown can be with a light tan head that becomes 1/4"" thick with good lacing all the way down. The smell is malty sweet with floral hops and dark fruits. It smells like brown bread with raisins. But the hops become more aggressive in the taste and the floral becomes more spicy a la allspice or clove, but remain in balance with the hops. Despite all the hops they don't dominate the aftertaste and the beer finishes dry and clean. The body is a little on the light side for a brown but that equates to an easy drinking beer that I wish I could get back home."
"Stays true to its Northern California roots, hoppiness is more here than other versions of the style. Solid."
"Tan head. Aroma of sweet malts and light chocolate. Tastes smooth yet crisp, malts and toasted. Balanced with good flavor. Smooth on the palate. Enjoyable to drink. I'm biased to this style as Nut Brown Ale is my favorite above all. This isn't Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale but it's a rather good substitute is you can find Sammy. It's also cheaper and comes ins a 6 pack. This is the kind of beer you can keep in the fridge, have on hand and drink regularly. This is a darn good California version of a great English Beer style."
"Poured into a Lost Coast glass, it is a deep dark brown with a sticky lacing around the glass as I drink the beer. The smell is sweet in rich with hints of chocolate and dark malts. The taste is a bit sweeter than I expcted but it is packed with roasted malts with a caramel toffee flavor that lingers. Over all a darn good brown ale."
"Cheers..."
"A decent brown beer, neither stand-out nor disappointing in any respect. It's very dark brown with a lasting two-finger head and smells like roast malt and chocolate/licorice. Taste is sweet roasted malt, dark coffee, a bit of bitterness at the end but mostly sweet. Not particularly complex, but smooth enough and tasty."
"D-Unremarkable, but a good version of the style."
"D - Not bad, this beer has a fairly rich malt profile for the style and its sweetness is well balanced by a surprise dose of herbal hops in the finish. It isn't anything extraordinary, but it is a well made example of the style (though the hops may push it more towards an American brown than and English one) and it is really quite drinkable."
"A pretty bang-on Yankee version of this venerable English style - take the base brown ale, and ramp it up, right? Not too hoppy (duh!) and generally flavourful all around is what we get, the nutty and malt characters really the story here."
"d- decent standby brown. no qualms with Lost Coast from this humboldt resident..."
"Pors a medium-dark brown with a large off-white head. Scent is not too appealing to be honest. Kinda has a skunky scent (stinky) with some malt. Let's hope the taste is better. Thank God! The taste is SO MUCH better! This is a great-tasting brown ale. I just wish I could mix the scent of Sierra Nevada Tumbler with the taste of this beer. I get some great nutty flavor with light hints of chocolate and delicious malts. There are very little hops present, but the brown sugar makes up for it. Great tasting session brown ale. Mouthfeel is very nice. A little creamy, but not too thick. Drinkability is high, and I'm really hoping there's something wrong with my nose tonight, because this beer smelt awful. Maybe an off bottle or my glass is tainted."
"One of my favorite!!!"
"D: Good beer for someone who likes porters, one of the better browns I've had."
"Drink is very high with fall and winter coming on this is a perfect beer."
"Drinkability: Flavors are present in this ale, but seem that your waiting for more when really your not. I would drink this again, but most likely not. Did go down easy on a hot night, but hey most beers do. Not to knock this, but something that isn't for me at the moment. Cheers!"
"D - very drinkable"
"On our recent drive from Denver to San Diego, we spent a night in Mesquite, Nevada, so we could get out of the car, the kids could swim and we could drink. Browsing the selection at Lee's Liqours, I came across Lost Coast bombers for $3.49 a piece. Years back, when I first got into craft beer, I was always enticed by these beers due mainly to the labels, but was generally not willing to lay out that kind of money (I think they were around 4 bucks a pop back then). Anyways, my memories were fond, so I gave it a shot. Long story short, it was pretty good--nutty, chocolatey and refreshing after a cholorine filled afternoon."
"D : Highly drinkable, even says ""light brown ale"" on the bottle. Sessionable at 5%. Doesn't stand out as a fantastic brown ale, but so light it would be a great party beer."
"Pours a tawny brown with a quick dying head. Nutty with a slight chocolate and roasted malt aroma. Lighter bodied with mild sweet chocolate and maybe some caramel or toffee and a good dose of roasted malt snesation. Very little hops for balance and slight crisp backbite to finish off a slightly chewey light-to-medium body. A simple but enjoyable brown."
"Drinkability - the flavor isn't overwhelming enough to make me hold off on one or two more at a pub, but I probably wouldn't go out and grab a six-pack of it. Not a bad ale by any means though."
"Drinkability - It is not something i will hunt down but is a good beer none the less."
"decent beer but not cheap in this part of the world"
"D- i usually passed this one up on the shelf for some reason. i wish i had tried it sooner. a nice sessionable brown ale with alot going on in it. check it out if you like the style."
"Pours a clear reddish brown with a thin tan head. Smells of ripened fruit and toasted bread. Taste is brown sugar up front, with a bready slightly tart middle and a lightly earthy finish. Mouthfeel is light, low carbonation. Drinkability is great, light and refreshing, if alcohol levels were a bit lower this would be a great session ale."
"pours hazy dark brown, with a small head that recedes to a ring around the glass, smells of biscuit, grain, dark bitter chocolate, cold coffee. Tastes clean at first then a slight burnt chocolate, nutty taste with a sweetness finishes dry then the aftertaste of the dark grains comes back and leaves a slightly sweet chocolate nut taste in my mouth. No hop taste of smell this is all grain. Good on a cold day with a meat pie."
"This is okay for what it is, but I'd rather have a Newcastle."
"A good average beer but nothing I would search out."
"D-Very drinkable. No strong or offensive flavors getting in the way. Technically too high an abv for a session beer but this is close."
"The body was on the lighter side of medium, without much feel to it other than stiff carbonation. This one isn't offensive and the flavors are just fine... there's just not enough of them, and what was there was pretty weak. Good for beer novices."
" ~ This beer is decent. Probably not my first choise but a beer none the less."
"D: this is a nice refreshing brown ale with a very interesting hop profile. Lots of tea like flavors which is not my favorite"
"D i would drink over new castle. worth the price"
"After knowing that my local store has carried Lost Coast beers for a number of years and that the proprietor said that they sell a lot of this product I thought I would give it a try. The brown was my first offering from this brewery. Poured to a clear medium brown color, some reddish highlights. Had a somewhat small light tan head that had good retention though the lacing was minimal. The aroma was of roasted malts and a nice nutty scent also there seems to be a slight coffee and chocolate presence but they are in the background. Some hops seem to be there but for me they where not clearly definable. The flavor was similar to the nose; roast and crystal toffee/caramel flavors give it a nice drinkable flavor with a slight coffee roast that tries to peak through. The hops that are there give a nice finish at the end but I wish they where a little more pronounced. Now, I am not sure if it is the beer itself or possibly the age where the hops could have fallen out over time. Over all this was a pleasant brew but nothing there really grabbed my attention where I would look for this one again. To many other Brown Ales that hit my mark."
"D - This is a solid brown thats easy to drink with a good taste overall a well made beer thats worth trying sometime"
"A decent, somewhat thinnish, brown ale that is easy enough to drink."
"Medium bodied as the label says, easy to drink. Good transition beer, for the non-craft drinker."
"Clear, dark russett brown with a fluffy tan head that leaves blobs of sliding lace behind on the glass. The smell is toasted grain, anise and a mineraly quality I can't put my finger on. I'm giving the taste a score of four because it says ""light"" brown ale right on the label, what else could you hope for but a flavorful and easy drinking 5% ABV brown, and it does deliver that. Mild coffee and dark chocolatey malt balance nicely with a minty hop quality. Medium light bodied and a bit more carbonated than I would like in this beer. Extreme? not even close. Drinkable? yeah, it is and it's a pretty good session beer option."
"Overall Impressions: Easy drinking dark(er) beer. The appearance left me expecting more body and flavor."
"Pours a dark brown with a light ruby tint & an off-white froth. Moderate lacing...nothing spectacular. The nose offers somewhat sweet aromas of roasted caramel malts, coffee, lightly roasted nuts, chocolate, &, strangely enough, a definite raspberry character (maybe they tapped the raspberry brown instead?) The beer shows some malty weight (however, very crisp and easy to drink) on the palate with very little hop presence and a medium finish. Overall, this is a great gateway brown for people that want to try something new. Very smooth & easy to drink, but nothing too complex. A solid brew."
"It's a pretty hefty carbonation that keeps pungent flavors from being piercing (see DFH's Palo Santo Maron). This brown has some weight to it, but that's the nature of the type."
"Unfortunately the watery nature of this bottle takes away from drinkability. I would love to try it on tap or even a bottle closer to its source. This isn't the first beer I've had to not fare too well from its journey across the country."
"Downtown Brown. Another Lost Coast poster child. For a person who isnt particularly fond of brown ales, this one isnt all that bad. its appears alot darker than it tastes. it has a sharp aroma of hops with subtle hints of coffee and chocolate. its tangy on the tongue, more bitter than sweet, but keeps you coming back for more. Has a light feel, dark bite, and a descent finish. a beer that would a make a better dessert beer than anything else. the bitterness of it would pair nicely with sweets like chocolates or creams, although its not as heavy as a stout or porter, so you might catch yourself handling a few more than you anticipated before you realize it."
"I could see myself downing a six pack of these brews along with some ceviche... Hmmm"
"D: It's not too heavy, reasonable ABV, no big flavors, but still tastes pretty good, so it's a winner here."
"If the brewer improved the aroma and mouthfeel characteristics, this would be a very good beer."
"Drinkability is pretty good, about perfect for a Brown Ale"
"All in all not the most complex beer in the world but nice and well rounded. good for a relaxing drink."
"Good all around beer. This is my girlfriends favorite beer so far....Poured into a pint glass. nice dark color with brown creamy head. Tasted of dark malts and little nutty-carmel tastes to it. went down smooth with nice after taste. I had thsi beer on tap and in the bottle. I prefer it out of the tap....from a pint glass I think it tasted better...."
"Lost Coast Downtown Brown is a dark brown ale that has a shade of dim garnet. It's crystal clear with a dense, creamy, light coffee colored head. It has excellent retention and leaves thick sheets of lacing on the glass. It has a toasty, nutty aroma with notes of roasted dark chocolate, walnut bread and a fruity grassiness. It's medium bodied, soft and smooth with a slightly gritty finish. It's fruity and roasty tasting. It's chocolaty but only a hint sweet. It has nice balance and it's a bit warming. It's a well executed brown ale."
"M/D: Medium-thick body with quite a bit of carbonation. Still I've had a really hard time slowing down on this stuff. It's really tasty, really easy to drink."
"Definitely a decent beer, laid back and reasonably complex without trying to be too bold. Not quite as good as the Rogue's Hazelnut Brown, but it has its own unique qualities that would cause me to choose this one over the Rogue or the more aggressive browns."
"I cannot figure out why this one gets an overall B rating from other beer reviewers. I think this has been a very successful beer for a reason, and would chalk it up to both a nice intensity and a refreshing balance, with plenty of complexity in the nose and palate. Is it my favorite English brown? No. That would go to Rogue's Hazelnut. But I would come back to this one repeatedly."
"Drinkability - 2.5/5.0 - not my style of brown, so won't be picking this one up again"
"The logo for Lost Coast is very eye catching if you ask me. Their labels are not far behind in visual appeal. I hope what's behind those two stands out as well. Poured into my pint glass the beer is a reddish brown hue with emphasis on the brown. Nice thick creamy tan head that peaks right to the top of my glass. The head leaves a decent amount of sticky lace around the rim. The aroma is wonderful. Cotton candy like sweetness with chocolate and caramel. It smells like a melted candy bar. Or a mocha latte with five tablespoons of sugar. The flavor is nowhere near as sweet. Which is a good thing since it would be too much if it were. A moderate cocoa flavor that's nutty and malty overall. Very mild and easy on the tastebuds. Medium body with enough carbonation to keep my tongue interested. Overall this beer is very easy to drink. Maybe not a stand-out for the style but, a solid effort."
"Drink I had a few of these, 4, and could have easily finished the sixer in one sitting."
"Bought this for a friend that came to town and exclusively drinks stouts and porters. I too enjoy stouts and porters, but not normally during hot Vegas summers. This beer however is a good choice for summer drinking. It's easy to drink and doesn't over power the taste buds or leave a heavy after taste. It has a slight hit of chocolatey bitterness when it first strikes the tongue. It's a very dark brown with a slight transparency that reflects a deep crimson. As a side note on smell, it didn't have any outstanding aromas in which to speak. That aside it is a good beer that I would recommend as an alternative to most summer beers."
"This beer poured with minimal foam with a brown color (the name doesn't lie). I immediately noticed notes of nuttiness and later a mild cinnamon scent. The initial flavor is of walnuts and, despite the beer not being thick, I was surprised by the flavor which had a bold almost porter like finish. I will admit I didn't expect much from the beer, I don't remember being wowed by brown ale, yet, this beer was a nice surprise, great notes and flavor!"
"d. i will drink this beer again, it went down smooth, tasted good and was an overall awesome experience."
"D: Could be done, but I don't think I'd have too many unless it was free."
"This is Lost Coast's milder and less exciting brown ale. I much prefer the richer bolder flavor of the Winterbraun but would not complain if this was served. With so many great brown ales available in the West, I have this as a big step down from Rogues Hazelnut and Bear Republic's Tribute. I put it a notch below Lost Coast's Winterbraun due to milder taste and a notch below Big Sky's Moose Drool for not being quite as balanced or sessionable. It does stay ahead of run of the mill micros like Alesmith's Nautical Brown and mass produced imports like Newcastle."
"The body is typical for the style, full without being heavy. The drinkability is wonderful, a smooth long term sipper for a session at the tavern. Overall another very nice beer from a brewery that often gets overlooked amongst the hype of the trend of the week. Worth seeking out."
"I enjoyed this beer very much. It poured dark brown color with very little head. Its caramel nuttiness was delicious and very refreshing. The smell was of a sugarcane hopness that was not overpowering, in fact I hardly noticed it after a while. Smooth taste all the way down, with a slight lingering of hop aftertaste. Drinkablility was excellent, I could have had more. And I think I will."
"if you are looking for a good drinking English brown then you have found it right here"
"I'm usually not into browns and turn my nose up at them BUT, I must say, this has me wondering what else do I taste in it and if so its good! I like this one. Maybe I've not tried and English brown like this one."
"Drinkability- It was really easy to drink. I could definitely have more. I enjoy it pretty well. ( and it's named after me lol)"
"Drinkability - I had a bomber of this and was easily able to finish it off - had I another, it probably would have been the same story"
"Pours translucent brown with thin white head. Nose is tepid but has some sweet roasty malt, and a slight smoked aroma. Palate has that smoke aroma/flavor I mentioned, across a rather thin body, and a slight hopy character that comes up near the end. Finish is short and sweet."
"A 12 ounce bottle poured into my nonic pint glass. Appears a clear chestnut brown color with a finger of fizzy light ecru foam. The head fades to a thin layer within a few minutes. Smells and tastes of medium roasted grains, mild nuttiness, caramel, sweet malts, and a touch of brown sugar. This ale was medium bodied with ample carbonation for the style. Check it out."
"M/D - very smooth and drinkable, nicely carbonated and easy to drink. Overall the flavors just aren't prominent with this beer."
"Drinkability: easy to drink this one, but the flavors are a bit muted for the style."
"Notes: This is a very average brew. Nothing horrible but nothing memorable, either. Leaves no calling card to remember it by."
"This is a decent brown ale, but not great. Still, it's totally sessionable and does not offend."
"Not good, not bad is the best way to sum up this beer. I am not a fan of Newcastle, or any nut brown ales for that matter, so this is not one of my favorite styles. It is very light and I can see it being very accessible to a lot of people."
"Drinkability - Not a bad brew. Almost a little too sweet to have too many in a night but very nice beer."
"I'm not a huge fan of the English style beers, but this was nice."
"Nutty brown colour; honey, nutty aroma with traces of maltiness wafting through; a complex taste that is somewhat bitter, honey and malty tones that seem to hit the middle of the tongue more than anywhere else in the mouth, does have a slightly water taste; bitter-nut after taste."
"Overall,this beer is my go-to brown ale when the mood strikes me. There are much better brown ales out there, but for the price, this does what I need it too. I only see myself purchasing this brew on a sale price."
"This beer pours a nice chestnut brown with a creamy light one finger tan head to it - very nice head retention. Lacing is nic and sticky on the side of the glass the whole way down. Nose is of chocolate, some toffee, nuttiness and a bit buttery. Taste is very well blended - chocolate has the most predominant flavoring mixed well with roasted malts, nuttiness, and some sweet toffee flavoring. Mouthfeel is a medium bodied creamy beer - went down quite nicely. This is a highly enjoyable English Brown!"
"I could have a few of these in a sitting, but there are so many beers to enjoy."
"D: Yummy...One of the best Brown's I've had.... Very smooth and easy going down, pretty light on the ABV. This is a very good representation of style. This one is a keeper to me... I'll have to check out other Lost Coast brews."
"Not my favorite style, but one of the better examples of the style I've sampled."
"Over all very tasty, I would buy it again, if I can find it in Wisco."
"Drinkability: A fine interpretation of an often boring style"
"Hmm. Decent looking enough, but has a bit of a lackluster nose. A little bit of fruit and some toast but not much else. Flavour is better - some nuttiness, dark fruit and coffee toastiness. Hops are mild, leaning towards a bit of lemon/citrus, and a quickly disappearing bitternesss. Just an easy drinking, mildly flavoured brown ale."
"I may come back to this style one day and love it but for now it's not my glass of beer."
"I had this on a bitterly cold day overlooking a small, ice-filled gorge while water tumbled under an ice and snow-covered horseshoe fall."
"Smooth drinking, but nothing to keep my attention. A bit of a boring experience, which isn't all bad."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0901-Steve"
"M/D-I only have 1 of these. I will be seeking out a 6 or 12 because this is truly a good beer."
"D and notes: Neutral taste and light body makes this very drinkable. I'd have more than one but would only recommend on pizza night."
"This beer pours a pretty standard nut-brown color with decent head that dissipated pretty quickly. The aroma of the beer is roasted malts, chocolate, and maybe some caramel. The flavor is hazelnut and chocolate. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and nice. The relatively low alcohol and nice flavor make the drinkability pretty high."
"I won't have this again, ever."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a mug, the beer pours brown with a small 1/2 inch off-white head that went away pretty quickly. Not much lacing. The aroma is roasted malt, nuts, and molasses, it's a sweet smelling brew. Taste is the same as the aroma, sweet and malty. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it seems thin and has light carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's not hard to drink. Overall it's decent enough, but it's nothing special. It's worth a try but I wouldn't pick this up too often."
"Very malty and grainy taste with excellent hop balance. Taste leans towards the hoppy side with the malt and grain flavor as a finish. Slightly thin feel with strong carbonation. Good finish with a good aftertaste."
"Drinkability: High. Very sessionable, as it does not dominate the palate but is drinkable on its own. Will likely pick up a six pack of this in the future."
"Drinkability. Very. I could easily have a few of these and not think twice. Lost Coast's nut brown is a pretty tasty beer, and one that goes down quite smooth. However, it's not going to be winning any prizes for notable flavor, and if I had my choice I'd reach for Samuel Smith's version."
"The beer is poured and its a dark brown with a good off white head of about a centimeter. Its retention is okay. The beer almost looks like a stout. The nose on the beer is roasted malts, chocolate and a slight hoppiness. Most of the flavours are chocolate though. The beer has a slight nutty flavour with a lot of chocolate flavours. It's sweet, but in a good way. There is a slight hazelnut flavour in the beer, which is good. The mouthfeel is about right for a brown ale. Not thick nor watery. It's pretty drinkable as well. The flavours aren't too strong nor are they too light."
"The taste is similarly rich, and interesting yet very pleasant. It has full-bodied toasty malt, toasted whole wheat, hints of caramel and yeast. It's sweetish and a bit toasty, very smooth and very full-bodied, with lasting flavour. However, it is not very complex and lacks almost any semblance of bitterness to balance the sweetness."
"It's not an overly impressive beer, but it's tasty enough, and it's extremely drinkable. This would make an excellent session as far as I'm concerned. A decent, mild, English style Brown Ale."
"overall, i was actually a littl ebit pleasantly surprised but this beer. I had had a couple of other brews from this brewery, and had been underwhelmed, but this is actually a pretty tasty one. Would consider getting it again, but will not go out of my way to do so."
"Color is a dark brown with a bit of head but not that much. Smells of malt and caramel, almost like a scotch ale. Tastes of roasted malt, nuts, and caramel, with a medium amount of bitterness. A very middle-of-the-road flavor, a little bit of hops, but not much. Carbonation is about right. This one is a drinkable beer though it doesn't knock my socks off."
"Pours a tawny dark ruby with very little head after the pour and barely there bubbling. The Aroma has toasted almonds and walnuts dancingly faint in the nostrils. The nutty aromas add to the overall light roasted malt character of this aroma. The tase starts with soft and sweet roasted malts that evolve into some watered down coffe, a touch of hazelnut coffee in a very smooth finish. This beer feels and tastes great. Theres a lot going on in this small, session ale."
"It's drinkable, I suppose.. I'm halfway through my pint glass and not really looking foward to the rest of this. But I'm one mean MOFO, so down the hatch it goes."
"Decent carbonation, goes down nicely. Sessionable but a bit on the savory side."
"This is a pretty good Brown Ale. Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head that diminished quickly so there wasn't much lacing. Sweet, sugary notes with a bit of malts, caramel and maybe even some honey. Slightly sour aftertaste. Solid but not great."
"Drinkability: Moderate. Wouldn't mind having one or two of these on occasion, but that would be it"
"Oh man, at first this smells like Newcastle on steroids for the big, rich brown chocolate malt aroma. The body is light enough to make this a definite session beer and the carbonation is properly balanced to keep the beer somewhat smooth without feeling heavy. The flavor itself seems a bit plain, just a big maple brown sugar malt with a touch of cocoa powder mixed in. All in all, a tasty beer and crowd pleaser for the simplicity."
"Somewhat listless and a touch thin although I would imagine that it could translate better on cask. Still, it's very easy to drink and makes for an easy session brew."
"Drinkability: This is more of a porter (even a chocolate stout) than a brown ale. Still, it's tasty and smooth. Probably won't get it again."
"There are others I recommend before this one for an English Brown Ale."
"Plenty of carbonation that help the taste go along ways along with the sweet malt taste. Good fresh grain taste left on your palate. Went great with the fresh seafood I had in Eureka. One of my favorite brown's up there with the Sierra Nevada Brown ale."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it might not be the first brown ale that I'd pick but it's certainly worth drinking for a while."
"This is one of my favorite browns besides smuttynose old brown dog...solid taste, goes down smooth, I could drink a whole 6 -pack of this which is rare for me. Best brown I could find while living in California for the past few months. I can't think of anything that stands out when you drink it, you just have to say ""damn, this is good"" after every few sips."
"I found this one rather enjoyable. It's nothing extreme of course, but not every beer has to be (contrary to popular belief). Recommended."
"Nice, easy to go down, an overall decent rendition of a brown ale."
"I like it as a good with-dinner beer. For those who like New Castle and similar browns. Overall good and something I would buy again"
"pours a clear deep ""iced tea"" brown w/ a thin off white head which dissipates immediately leaving a moderate lacing in my nonic ; not a strong smell, sweet dates/licorice and nuts all blend w/ a steely grain nose up front ; a thin flavor, decent hop bite for the style, more of a roasted nut/coffee flavored type bitterness mixed with dark fruits and a def. licorice/anise(?)-type undertone, watery mineralish finish ; a surprisingly dry, light bodied beer, perhaps a bit too light even w/ the fair amount of co2 ; a quaffable beer tho, before you know it your pint's empty & you want another..."
"D-not bad, but I needs me some hops"
"D: Very refreshing!"
"Poured a nice clear dark brown an average head for a brown. Nose was roasty a little bit, good malts anh hops. Taste was some coffee and chocolate but very subtle and had a slight roastiness to it. It was a very subtle rown that waa easy to drink. I enjoyed it and I dont like browns."
"This was not a bad brown ale by Lost Coast. Poured a tannish color with an OK head. Smelled a malt sweetness with a hint of hazelnut. Tastes of breadiness and almonds but not much hopiness. The mouthfeel is kind on the tongue with low carbonation. Good to sip as an after dinner quaff."
"One of my favorite brown ales; better on tap, but good either way."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep mahogany with thin, creamy looking, tan head. The smell is of chocolate, crystal and toasted malts; present but not overwhelming. The taste has an initial bitterness that isn't too much but it caught me off guard, the flavor then transitions to a mild maltiness of previous said malts and a touch of black patent. A decently balanced beer but I was expecting something slightly less balanced, towards the maltier side from an English brown. The mouthfeel is light in body with a slightly viscous carbonation and a dry finish. Drinkability is pretty good, not a bad beer - just not a very convincing English brown."
"M/D - Somewhat thin but well carbonated beer. Very easy drinking brown ale."
"Pours a nice dark brown but not much of a head. Nothing outstanding in the aroma department. Nutty and very roasted malt taste. Light mouthfeel, good session beer. A little tart. Ok, nothing to write home about -- good traditional American Brown, recommended."
"Poured into a snifter. Rich mahogany color with a slightly tan head that retains rather well, which leads to decent lacing. Very nutty aroma, with some sweet complex malts, but nothing over the top. Very nice hazelnut flavor, sweet malts on top with a nicely nutty balance. No hop characteristics. Very smooth and creamy, not heavy at all for a brown ale. Very nice brown ale, very drinkable."
"This brown ale did not disappoint! Definitely up there with the best brown ales I've had (brooklyn and others) in terms of drinkability combined with a smooth, interesting taste. Good, balanced amount of strong, rich flavor with smooth aftertaste, and nice use of hops to spice up things without detracting from drinkability. Highly recommended for a relaxing meal or evening with friends--and definitely something I would love to keep on hand if I could find it back east."
"Miles better than Newcastle."
"Great drinkability. A perfect session beer."
"A nicely balanced american brown. A bit light in flavor for my taste but pleasant. Palate was a bit fizzy and thin."
"Dark brown pour, with short lived, light tan bubbly head that doesn't last. Smell is basically just nutty, and reminds me of a nut brown ale. Taste is a light coffee flavor, and nutty malt taste. Smooth body, but overall I thought it was just a very average brown ale. Easy drinking, not bad in any way, but I wouldn't put this high on my list."
"Nummy nummy nummy for my tummy tummy tummy. I grew up in Humboldt County and visit there once a year, each time visiting Lost Coast Brewery in Eureka. And each time I try their, tavern-only creations, as well as their standard bottled stuff, but I keep coming back to Downtown Brown as their best beer. Most of their beers are pretty good, but this one is exceptional. I don't know what they did differently, but they should keep doing it."
"A tasty brown ale."
"D - i like the taste, i'm not sure how the mouthfeel issues would pan out but i could see myself enjoying these in"
"Very tasty and full of great aroma. The mouthfeel is a bit lacking, but all in all, definitely a brown I will seek out and recommend."
"This beer poured a dark brown color with a tan colored rocky head. The aroma is sweet malt with caramel and brown sugar notes. The taste is malty and smooth. The mouthfeel is full and is excellent for this brew. Overall, this is one of the easiest drinking beers out there Â– just a smooth example of a brown ale."
"d: a little on the bland/flavorless side for my taste; i wouldn't go out of my way to drink this one again but it was worth a try"
"Drinks easy, but a tad too sweet at the end, plus some more body would be desirable. A solid brown, that really turned my head the first time I had it. Had a few browns since 95 or was it 97?? though. Still dig the label art"
"Poured into pint glass. Pours deep mahogany brown with rugy highlights. Small head with minimal retention and lacing. Smell is somewhat bland I thought and was really only able to detect subtle chocolate and a slight bread and nut smell. Taste is much better. Some tastes of malt, roasted grain, and nice chocolate and coffee flavor as it hits the back of your mouth. Moderate carbonation and a light mouthfeel, almost watery at times. Overall not a great beer but easily drinkable. I had a 6 pack over several weeks but could see having a few or more in one session."
"Overall: Outstanding effort in the brown beer niche. A great brown to give to a novice... full of flavor without being harsh."
"IÂ’m not a huge fan of the style. I think most would consider Newcastle as kind of the classic style, and this one certainly would hold its own against that."
"Not great.. not bad... but definately above average across the board.. a good brew that I should pick up more often instead of picking over it."
"Chicago"
"Browns don't tend to be too exciting, but this is a stand up beer, and certainy would be good for sessioning. Also works well in cooking, as my wife and I tried it both in a beer bread and a chicken marinade with great results."
"D: Maybe I had a bad batch, but I just didn't like this much at all. Much too fizzy and not enough going on with the flavor. I'd just as soon have a Newcastle."
"Poured a red-brown with a dark 1-finger head. The smell was malty and of roasted chocolate and roasted nuts. It had a more robust smell than most English Brown Ales. The taste was also a bit more full and well-rounded than the other EBAs I've had. It was almost like the taste of a stout without the heavy mouthfeel and with a bit more subtleness to it. There was the taste of nuts (maybe even hazelnut), a malty body made of burnt coffee and chocolate malts, a oak-like aged flavor, yet a light, bitter bite at the end of each sip that played with with the well carbonated body. In terms of EBAs, this one is the best tasting and most drinkable that I've had in quite a while."
"Overall this is a nice EBA, making it a worthy beer...Definitely not the best, but it is a very good beer"
"Brown colored ale with aroma of sweet caramel.Taste is mostly caramel and nuts.Pleasant aftertaste is of buttery toffee.I would purchase this beer again and recommend it to anyone who would listen to me.Overall a good job which I think could be even better if it was a little less watery!!"
"Went straight through a six pack with these and was impressed. A great brown ale with apparent tones of coffee and caramel. A highly recommended brew and will buy more of these in the future. Does much better than most other brews in its category. Will look to experiment with more Lost Coast Brewery beers in the future. Definitley worth a shot."
"This is a nice little brown ale. Simple and unassuming like it's supposed to be."
"d) very drinkable its light smooth has a decent amount of taste and a low adv making drinking a six pack or more quite possible. this would also be a good beer for people who are not used to some of the taste of high quality beer. i.e. my wife loves the stuff"
"I was expecting the worst from this beer so a pleasant surprise might get me a bit too excited..."
"I was impressed; this is a rare find for me. I'm always on the lookout for a good representation of the harder styles to brew very well, like a brown or a pilsner. Hats off to Lost Coast."
"Other comments: I'm so glad this American rendition of an English Brown Ale is balanced and actually fitting the style, as opposed to the usual American way of bastardizing a style and adding more hops than called for. Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just nice to see that there are breweries doing it this way, too."
"D: An OK beer, easily sessionable, just nothing special about it that reaches out and grabs you."
"Drinkability: Not too thrilled with this beer. A little too sweet; bitterness not well balanced. Not a great example of an English Brown Ale. This is no Hobgoblin."
"Dark brown appearance with a nice little head, this is a simple brown ale. Your toffee and sweet flavors exist here along with hop leaf and brown sugar, but nothing to get really excited about. I really don't have a whole lot to say about this one except I expected a little better."
"Thanks John"
"not much head, but i did pour it kinda slow. dissipates fairly quickly...no lacing. smells first of faint alcohol then more malty, even a little bit of chocolate. smells nice..the alcohol isn't too strong in the smell at all, not even noticeable until you stick your nose into the glass. color is dark brown/amber..not black like the picture. taste is good, medium to light body, similar taste as smell...hint of alcohol, feels kinda carbonated in my mouth, lightly roasted malts dominate the flavor..not really tasting the chocolate i smelled..just a tiny bit in the aftertaste. good stuff."
"Nice, fairly thick creamy head which takes a while to dissapate but leaves almost no lacing. Darker in color than I expected, very dark brown. The smell was good, sweet fruits, coffee, very slight burnt smell. Starts off thin and a bit wattery tasting, and ends decent strong leaving a lingering taste in my mouth. Taste is of coffee, burnt hops, slight sweetness however it didnt seem particularly well balanced. Mouthfeel was a little wattery, creamy, went down smooth. A fairly drinkable beer. Definitely not my favorite brown, but it would be easy to knock a few back."
"This was my first experience with Downtown Brown and it was a good one. Stopped in at Lost Coast Brewery in Eureka, CA so it really can't get any fresher. Note: I have also had this beer out of the bottle and on draft at the brewery is superior (no surprise there.) Goldilocks would like this beer, not too dark, not too light but just right. It does have a hint of sweetness to it; almost a root beer quality."
"This was a different beer, and not particularly a favorite of mine. Appearance was flat with a dark, nutty brown color and no visible head or lacing. Smell offers a bit more promise with a roasted nut malt smell and no recognizable hops. Taste was not that great but not bad either with the same nutty flavor as smell, but honestly tastes a bit stale."
"I quite enjoy the sweet American-style browns, and occasionally even the dryer English standbys. But this sample of Downtown Brown doesn't measure up to the best of either."
"Served up with a creamy, foamy tan head. It was dark brown in color and didn't have much of a smell to it. What is it with some browns that they just don't smell at all?? The taste is quite bitter up front, and then a bit bland - not much to this one."
"Easy drinking. Perfect session beer."
"This is a very drinkable and very sessionable brew. It looks and tastes a lot like a Coke. I'm not much on the style, but I would have this again. Seems like it would go well with pizza."
"12 oz. bottle- color of dark brown , with a thin white head - nose of peanuts , malts , milk chocolate , and faint spice Â– taste of nutty malt , mild milk chocolate , and slight roasted - body mild , and lightly carbonated Â– aftertaste of roasted malts , mild chocolate , and nutty"
"Drinkability- It's not a great brown. If you can find a pounder, try it, but don't invest in a whole sixer if you can avoid it."
"Drinkability- With its watery texture and underwhelming taste, this is no more than a middle-of-the-road brown ale. Easy to drink, but not very rewarding."
"Slightly hazy dark brown with a small, light tan, creamy, slowly diminishing head. Thick lacing. Smells is malt dominant, with roasty aromas of nuts, cookie, toffee, wood and a little molasses being supported by some light spicy hops and some very light earthy yeast. The taste follows suit but with the hops even more subdued at first. Dark bread crust, nuts and some chocolate. The hops show up on the finish a little more, adding a light citrus bitterness to go along with the thick malt flavors. An easy drinking, inviting beer with enough character, body and balance to keep my happy without being very cloying at all. A bit too filling to be a session beer, but a good brown nonetheless."
"Basically, avoid at all costs. While it looks nice, it tastes and feels horrible. Extremely watery, with some major taste issues. Fermented dirt. I don't think that I can finish this, which means there must be something really wrong..."
"nice dark taste, a little roasty and toasty. it's mild and slightly sweet. great balance and impressively drinkable. smooth and ever so slightly thick."
"Looks like a brown ale, nothing too unique or exciting here. Smells roasty and lightly sweet, but juuuust barely. Tastes... odd. Off. Sort of dirty. I can't quite pinpoint it... maybe like an unappealing scottish brew in the past? Just unpleasant. Mouthfeel is flat and boring. Ick, I'm not a fan of this. Pass on this one."
"Very middle of the road type stuff."
"That's a tasty brown ale. A style that doesn't make many hearts flutter, but this is clearly a well-constructed bottle of beer. Good looking label, too."
"22-ounce bottle received from b0ldfacelies as part of my BA Secret Santa 2006 package -- many thanks, Jason! Polished russet with a decently adequate tan head. Soft and fruity melon aromas at first, with a fainter spicy nuttiness creeping in around the back. Whiffs of kiwi, too, I think. Could use a little more oomph in the nose. Definitely in the English tradition of brown ales, Lost Coast Downtown Brown features mildly spicy and earthy hop flavors supported by a variety of fresh fruit notes (tart apple, melon, green plum) and a soft, biscuit-like malt structure. If it were darker in color, I'd think this would easily ride the line between brown and mild ale -- two styles with many family resemblances to begin with, I know. Demure zestiness in the mouthfeel, light-bodied but peppery enough to provide a substantive quaff. Accordingly drinkable. Am I crazy, or is this one of the only brown ales available in 22-ounce bottles? There should be more, since it's such a sessionable style. Anyway, solid offering, no-brainer as a choice to take to a laid-back Friday night party."
"This ale pours a reddish brown with very little head, but does have pretty decent lacing.Essences are of roasted malt with some nuttiness. ( Good but a little lacking in magnitude). Taste is aiso pretty much alligned with the essences on this one, nutty/ roasted malt flavor with very light hops, and just a hint of caramel as the brew comes up in temperature. Mouth feel is surprisingly full and creamy, with a cling to the tongue feel and light carbonation. Finish is very smooth with no negatives in the aftertaste.This is a nut brown ale that I wouldn't hesitate to order on an evening out.(I would have graded the appearance one notch higher if it hadn't almost completely failed to produce a head even with an aggressive pour!)"
"While this clocks in at 5% ABV, I'd still consider it a session beer--at least for me. This is a drinkable beer, smooth easy, enjoyable, and interesting enough to talk about. . .and still not forget. Well worth a try. And Eureka, CA just--barely--qualifies this as a Pacific Northwest brew. Well worth a try."
"Overall impression: Nicely balanced and drinkable - not the most exciting I have had, but it makes a nice session beer."
"This beer pours reddish brown with a light brown head and has a great look for for a brown ale. It has a very sweet malty aroma that makes me want to drink it immediately. The beer has very light hops and a sweet taste with and is surprisingly full bodied. I think I subconsciously expected this beer to be a bit thinner for some reason was I was very pleased. There is a slight fruity aftertaste. I like this beer and I would definitely drink it again."
"D - This is a pretty good Brown ale. The combo of nut and malt flavors is very tasty."
"Pours a dark brown color with a thin light tan colored ring of lace around the side of the glass. Aroma is sweet toasted malt with a bit of nuttiness as well. The taste starts our nutty with some toasted maltiness with a dry finish with only a faint hop presence to help balance it out. Overall, I find this to be a slightly better than average brown that is pretty drinkable."
"By no means unpleasant to drink, it nevertheless doesn't excite much."
"Overall a very nice brown. One of my favorites at Lost Coast."
"Up front this beer tastes like a normal brown ale; dry, lightly roasted grain, mixes with some nutty toasted malt notes, and a bit of caramelized malt. After that though that almost fake berry fruit note starts to grip the flavor profile. Really quite interesting, if I had this beer blind I would swear to you that they added fruit extracts to this beer. The fruitiness has that same one dimensional, too intense fruit character to it that fruit extracts generally have. This is quite light on the palate, and if not for the uncharacteristic fruitiness would be quite quaffable. As it is though, it is a little too much, the fake berry fruit notes just is too much to make this really enjoyable. It is not bad, just unexpected."
"It's a bit foamy, but goes down smooth. Chocolate and creamy is a nice combo. The only problem is that it might be too rich or sweet to drink too many."
"Drinkability: Not a sessionable beer for me, its a bit more rich in mind for that but for those who really enjoy the style could make a night out of these."
"I was a bit disappointed in this beer. It poured a nice but not really long-lasting dark tan head. The color was nice--somewhere between rust and chocolate, comparable to A&W Root Beer (which I like). The taste was fine up front, but finished badly. The aftertaste was a dirty, chemical taste that I really did not like. The smell was also chemical, though more sour than dirty or bitter. Only so-so for me."
"A decent example of a below-average style. Pardon the shortness of this review: there's just nothing much to say about this beer."
"D: Lost Coast never disappoints. All of there beers are very flavorful and original. This is an amazing brown, though people looking for something milder than a Porter or Stout may not find what they are looking for."
"D: Not as bold as I would like for a brown. Chalk this one up as ""ok"""
"Very drinkable. Surprised I found it here!"
"Very good brew, all around good brown."
"Cheers!"
"One was very good, but enough."
"The problem with this beer in my opinion was that it lacked the body I was expecting and felt a little watered down. The malt was there, but it just wasn't robust enough. An unexpected letdown, and I wouldn't get it again."
"The taste had a biscuit like sweet carmel flavor. Very smooth and light bodied. Would have prefered a little more body to it but it was quite good."
"Nice, sweet (but not cloying) brown."
"drinkablilty: i've had this beer one hundred times over the years. Around here it is very, very common and i've never seen anyone turn one down. A very good anytime, anywhere beer."
"D- hard to say no to this one. awesome desert beer, went very well with lunch also. one of the most memorable brown ales i've come in contact with"
"Average brown ale appearance. Somewhat murky brown/orange color. Low aroma-some sweet malt and slightly nutty notes. Decent malty flavor. Nice, toasted, nutty taste. Theres a somewhat anti-septic, or ""off"" flavor in the finish. Good body-holds up better then many other browns out there. An enjoyable beer. I have to knock it down a bit for the off flavor. While not entirely unpleasant, it detracts a bit. I wish I could nail down what it is. Will try this one again-might be an off bottle."
"Faintly reminded me of an American Brown I recently tried called Bootlegger. Darker in body than other browns I've had, and with more of a chocolatey flavor to it. Try one of these for sure."
"D - I didn't care for this one."
"Mouth feel is a bit thick and syrupy for my likings and the carbonation level is low."
"I made a mistake and bought a bottle that was packaged in 10/05. D'oh! However, even though it was bottled at least five months ago, it is enjoyable. It is slightly oxidzed. But the aroma sitll has some sweetness and chocolate. The appearance is slightly hazy, brown/amber, with a tight tan head. It was overcarbonated which gave a bite in the finish that was not necessary. The flavor has a good balance of hop flavor, slight chocolate tied together with a caramelly sweetness. The finish is bittersweet and has too much CO2 bite. The aftertaste, though, is like a slightly sweetened chocolate; dry, sweet, bitter & delicious. I'd like to get a fresh bottle next time!"
"Flavor is typial brown ale with a toasted biscuit twist but finishes with a cough medicine-like finish. Lots of toasted malts and biscuits going on. Can just sense some hops around the edges. But I cannot get overthat cold medicine. Medium body that is on its way towards watery."
"Lost Coast really messed up with this one. A bland taste and a smell to match began my disappointment with this brew, which had an appearance which fooled my tastebuds with its attractiveness. Mouthfeel is nothing special. To be fair I haven't had a brown ale I've liked but I have had better ones than this. Pick up some Old Rasputin instead."
"Downtown Brown poured a dark red with a light tan head that left some nice lacing. The aroma is very nutty and toasty with lots of rich malt character. The flavor is good and it begins with a soft, dark carmal malt and toasted malt flavor. There is a touch of hops in the beginning of the flavor but it is very quickly overcome by the malt. The mouthfeel is very smooth and there is a low carbonation level which accents the malt wonderfully. This is a great session beer which has a lot of flavors that go with grilled meats I also think that this is a great beer to cook with."
"pored a nice clear dark dark red almost brown color with good head retention threw out the time. the first time i smelt it, it smelt like a mellow form of coffee. once i went on my second bottle, i smelt more chocolate. i'm more a chocolate person then coffee, so this time it smelt a lot better. the taste is of roasted malts. a little bit of chocolate as well to make a relatively fine aftertaste. not bad. not too filling either. this is only my second lost coast brew, but so far they haven't been dissapointing."
"Another lineup's brown. And just another beer. Nice head, deep brown body. Licorice and malt, including chocolate.Not overly sweet. Offset by some roastiness.Nicely hopped. Grainy. Light instant coffee. Medium mouthfeel. Nicely drinkable at Pizza Plant Transit."
"Expect a nice brown thats well worth the money and this will come through."
"Pours dark brown with slight tinge of red, light brownish short head. Not much lacing, it's a little thin. Nose is good, not very hefty with sweet caramels, slight nuts, toastiness. Taste is nice, again not very heavy, medium bodied with nuttiness, sweet caramel malts, and slight toasts. Was expecting a little more bitterness for the style, but you know I liked this one's balance a lot."
"has a slightly nutty sweetness and caramel with a smooth finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall drinkability is quite drinkable."
"Tap@Lost Coast. Not a style i usually like, but this works well. Drier than most browns, like roasted chocolate, with some tangy hops, pretty easy to get into. Also more of an American style, with more hop tang, not quite as sweet as some of the English versions that i have had in the past, i prefer this style myself."
"Drinkability/Notes: I will not buy it, and may not take it if someone offers it. I have better beers to drink."
"1-finger ochre head on a slightly hazy brown body with amber highlights. Good retention and attractive lacing. Roasted malts, caramel-butter sweetness, a bit of citrus in the nose. Gentle carbonation, slight astringentness, medium body feel. The roasted caramel malt is nicely balanced with a refreshing hop citrus bitterness, orange citrus emerging on the way down, with a bit of pineyness and chocolate lingering, leaving an odd thin sensation. Not all that nutty, though rich, but the hopping seems to balance in a negative way. Fairly sessionable but not all that memorable."
"Overall: The wonderful aroma is not complimented by the flavor. The beer seems a touch watery and there is a unique flavor derived from the grains that really sticks out and lingers in the finish. The American hops also add a slight citrus character in aroma and flavor as the beer warms up."
"This is a really good rich beer, but it somehow has an odd slight watered down thing going on. It is nice and clean, but it does leave a bit of an aftertaste. Overall, I like the beer and would recommend it."
"When I visited the Brewpub this was a local favorite (I prefered the 8 Ball Stout), the balance taste seems off to me and the metallic/astringent finish lingers the grapefruit/orange. The twist off top probably affects the taste."
"Not the best brown ale in the universe. Pours a very dark brown with zero head. Smell is of alcohol and fruit. Taste is strong, lingering alcohol with suprising bitterness. Drinkability is decent, but why bother? I'll take a pass on this one - there are better brown ales out there..."
"Poured from a bottle a dark brown clear color. Highly carbonated , thick decent head, some lacing of head as I consumed. Malty smell with a hint of nut. Decent nut brown taste with a smooth finish. Not one of my favorite browns, doesn't leave much of an impression, but worth trying."
"This beer should be drunk at 55-60 degrees. Cold there isn't much there, but as it warms, it gets better and better. Recommended."
"Props to GClarkage for the trades!"
"Creamy tan head, good retention, deep amber brown and pretty clear with a few floaties. Nutty nose, a little toast, and a grainy twang. Thin, slightly sweet caramel malt flavor with a hint of peanut. Slightly carbonic tasting. Finely hoppy and a clean dry finish. Prickly carbonation. A very average brown."
"I first tried this beer in a bottle and was not very impressed, however I dismissed this to aging, perhaps. Then, I went to the brewery and got the sampler, which included the Downtown Brown, and this only confirmed my initial opinion. There was a ""watered-down"" sense to it that does not usually accompany browns. The hops were faint and the taste was decidedly unexciting."
"Entry is smooth with tiny COÂ² bubbles tickling the sides of the tongue. Midtadte is the nose multiplied by two...with the malt getting center stage. The finish begins with a quick glance at the hops before the long, slow, dry malt fade commences..."
"A terrific sample of a Brown ale. Perhaps a little sweeter than most (especially the english ones) but it makes the style more accessible to more people. Pours an opaque brown color that is only light around the edges. The smell is like a nut brown with a hint of sweetness to it. There is a tremendous full-mouth flavor that takes over and is pretty well rounded. There is also a long aftertaste like a double brown. Great for people who are curious about Browns."
"Drinkability: Besides its attractive head and vaguely appealing scent, this beer is pretty boring. It's not hard to drink--very easy to, actually--but completely lacks character. Reliably average."
"Another good brew from Lost Coast, rich and packed with flavor."
"I took my time enjoying this beer and it was a good stand alone brew. I'm not sure what I would eat this with but it wasn't bad with the garlic fries. It balanced the garlic well. I could have easily lounged with another one."
"This is moderately drinkable, but it's nothing to write home about. If it's not on sale, I'll probably skip it in the future."
"Looks like a root beer... not that that's bad, but just kinda weak. Very little head. Not much in the way of aroma, pretty clean and lightly malty, very little hops. Taste is a nice hint of caramel, a little nutty, and some brown sugar, but not terribly sweet. It would be nice if it had a drier finish, but it's not bad. Decent mouthfeel and drinkability. Not worth seeking out, maybe, but it's still a nice English brown ale."
"Overall- I like a Brown Ale to have a little backbone to it. This is much like candy. I'll pass."
"I was intrigued with the label art on this oneÂ…what the hell is that strange-looking guy doing with his chin? The beer pours a very clear ruby brown color. Respectable head, but very little lace. Roast malt aromaÂ…caramel and a little chocolate. Very nice aroma, with just a little hops sneaking in. A lightly sweet malty taste is pleasant, but not very complex. Caramel, a bit of nutty character. Low carbonation, and somewhat light body. ItÂ’s drinkable, and fairly good, but nothing to write home about."
"Pours a clear dark brown with some particles floating around , small foamy tan head that leaves some lacing in my glass, roasty nutty-bready aromas. Nutty caramel flavors, finishes on the sweet side. Medium bodied with a kind of watery mouthfeel, a decent brown."
"Goes down like an adjunct-free light beer."
"Overall: Can't really explain why I got so much hop presence out of this beer, other reviews haven't pointed it out. Certainly it wasn't just roasty bitterness for me. Not sure if I would call this English style in that respect."
"Beautiful brown color, hefty, frothy head which stayed. Smell was roasty, coffee-like, hops are in the background. The taste was of roasted coffee with one too many scoops of sugar in it. Sticky, gooey taste got caught in the back of the throat, and above it all was a surprisingly thin mouthfeel. I just don't think I care for the style."
"This beer came in a bomber. Cool label and cap. Pours a dark brown color with a tall head that has nice retention and leaves some good lacing on the glass. The aroma is very much mocha, as was stated previously. Nice chocolate, small bit of coffee. The flavor is much the same as a mocha shake. Nice chocolate flavors with just a hint of coffee and nut. Perhaps could use a bit more body, but I like it very well. Great brown ale."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with some nice ruby hues. Two fingers of head fall to a finger. The nose is nice mocha, little bit of chocolate, little bit of coffee, maybe a hint of caramel sweetness. The flavor is very nice. Intense mocha with just a slightly bitter coffee finish. Nice. The feel is a light moderate, a touch thin for my liking, but still not bad at all. Drinkability is very good here. As far as a brown ale goes, this is what I want to taste and smell. Good good beer. Thanks to clvand0 for sharing his spoils with me."
"Drinkability- One of the better brown ales I have had. Better than Newcastle. There are better ones out there though. Still worth buying a sixer and sharing with friends."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head above the slightly reddish brown brew. Head holds on well, with good lacing. Aroma is deeply malty, with some dark fruit/alcohol notes. Taste isn't quite as grainy as I would have hoped, and the dark fruit notes still pop up, which I don't think have much place in a brown. Mouthfeel and drinkability reasonably good, and this would be worth checking out if you find it available."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"As far as mouthfeel, this is one smooth beer. Simple and easy to drink. Maybe too easy."
"Pours a medium-dark brown with a thick, light tan head that hangs around for a while. Lots of roasted and chocolate malts control the nose. Some caramel notes also present. Very nice palate of roasted malt, caramel and slight smoke in the finish. Light and flavorful mouthfeel. A very pleasant beer. Quite easy to drink. A nice offering for a brown ale. Worth a try if you find it."
"If this is what browns taste like then boy have I been missing out. Pours a deep dark brown with an off white head that is nice to the eye. The smell is of roasted chocolate and butter, a nice floral hop refreshes. The taste is a nice caramel rich chocolate with a nice floral hop in the end that balances out the sweetness, the hops taste so good with this, great combo, great beer."
"Downtown Brown is a solid, well made, delicious brown ale. It doesn't step outside the bounds of the style, prefering instead to play it safe and win converts with simple quality. Mission accomplished."
"Pours a dark brown color with a minimal head. Smell is of Cascade hops. Taste is of caramel and chocolatly malts followed by hops. Aftertaste is hoppy. Very hoppy for a brown ale and very drinkable. A bit on the watery side but you could do alot worse than this beer. Cheers."
"Shooting out some props to the Grandest Bum of them all once again."
"12 oz. twist-off bottle graciously given to me by a co-worker to enjoy. Thanks Brett. Pours out a hazed deep chestnut brown color with a beige, sticky head that leaves good lacing. Good chocolate malt aromas with hints of nuttiness. No real hops to speak of in the aroma. This a a pretty good brown. It imparts all the characteristics a brown ale should have. It's roasty (toasty), husky and a bit nutty. Hops make a cameo in the finish, which brings everything full circle. Nice drying finish. Good stuff."
"The beer after its excavation from the 12-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a hazy brown with a modest semi-creamy light tan head and as it erodes the resultant lace a thin covering upon the glass. Nose is caramel and sweet malt, fresh and pleasing to the senses, start sweet with a decent malt presence, the top light to moderate in its feel. Finish is nicely hopped and the acidity acceptable, dry long lasting aftertaste, a drinkable beer."
"A middle of the road beer. There really isn't much to say. Pours a brown colour with little head, not much of an aroma other than a slight malt sweetness. I would say that this is about as average as you can get with a brown ale. Not bad, but not great."
"The beer pours a dark bown color with a thick offwhite head that slowly fades. The aroma is good. It a has a dry, yet sweet aroma of crystal and pale malts. The taste is good. It has a smooth and slightly dry sweet crystal malt flavor that goes down easy and finishes creamy. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good drinking brown ale. It has good aroma and taste."
"Overall: Another tasty brew from Lost Coast (at least when its fresh) that is a solid beer, nothing earth shattering but a damn fine Brown Ale that drinks extremely well."
"I think the bottle's logo is pretty stupid, but the beer is pretty good. The head on the beer is magnificent! Big, frothy, over the top of the rim head! It lasted quite a while too, but then died out to a laceing. I think the beer was just like Newcastle, but a little bit more concentrated on the nutty/fruitiness of the taste and smell. I dig this brew and plan on drinking some more in the future."
"Cheers to JohnnyDuvel for sending it out!"
"My 2nd Lost Coast beer, and this one doesn't comapare to their IPA. Very nice looking, deep brown with a very well retaining off-white head. Sweet, malty caramel aroma. Flavor has some toasty malt flavors but not much else. Slight bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel feels a tad astringent. Not the best Brown Ale I've had. Its OK, but not worth seeking out."
"why have i been avoiding this? recently being converted into a brown beer lover, i decided what the heck. pours out a deep drown with not much of a head, but all together it is a nice looking beer. the aroma is highly fruity, very nutty, pretty toasty and down right lovely. (zing!) flavor wise this is good stuff. strong nutty character with a light caramel sweetness that is tamed by a sharp but controlled hop bite. finishes a bit dry and overall is very balanced. the only down fall of this beer, even though its no biggie...it is a touch thin in the mouth. not bad, but could use a little more body. now that we got that out of the way, this shwaithe is drinkable as all hell and much tastier than expected. loved it."
"the first time i tried this i knew i loved it, i had to come back to more. very sessionable."
"It seems like there is no alcohol in here anywhere ... but the heaviness of ingredients seem to indicate a decent ABV. Up the mouthfeel and this could be one of the better brown ales around."
" An enjoyable, American brown ale that is more complex than expected."
"Drinkable, but not that great."
"This is a fine brown ale that pours a luscious burnt umber with ruby highlights and also a healthy tan head. Smell is all roasted nuts and hops. The taste is tremendous and spot on for the style. The flavor of a dozen kinds of nuts dominates, but a smooth caramel toastiness takes over toward the end in tandem with a sharp hoppy bite. Mouthfeel is bready and wholesome and drinkability is tops. Hoist one of these and you shan't be disappointed."

"One of my favorites from Lost Coast!"
"This one surprised me a little. Both the color and taste seemed more like a porter to me than a brown ale. I have never had a brown ale taste like this or pour so dark. It was very nice tasting, but it was odd because of the style confussion in my head. This is a good beer, but maybe a little too much for a brown."
"Rich chocolate aroma, maybe a little coffee in there as well. Oatmeal cream colored head that didn't last long. Dark cola brown colored beer that lets just a little light through. The flavor is a nice balance between smooth maltiness and chocolate, with a little hop bite to balance the sweetness. The body is middle of the road and the mouthfeel is clean and smooth. A nice beer, easy drinking."
"I've never been a real fan of red and brown ales, but Downtown Brown is one that I've enjoyed for years. It's a nice change from the pale ales and IPA's that I normally enjoy. This one has a smooth blend of malt with a sweetness that is not at all overbearing. I sometimes am reminded of a Newcastle Ale, except this one goes down much better, has more character and is much more agreeable to the palate. The local watering hole in town finally has it on tap. Had one while enjoying the Purdue-Georgia bowl game and a submarine sandwich on New Year's Day. Lost Coast has some other tasty brews that I enjoy, such as 8 Ball Stout. It's a great brewery."
"A very nice and drinkable brown ale..best brown ale i have had in a long time."
"Pours a deep amber brown hue with a full thicket of tan lacing just beautiful appearance, lacing is speckled and spread out with no pattern to it. Aromatics is key in this beer, undertone of floral hop presence and mild chocolate tones from the dark roasts used here and a very mild coffee tone to it. Tastes vary between milky chocolate notes and finishing hops adding a balancing bitterness the dark roasted malts add a great tone of bitternesss to the overall flavor pretty damn good brown. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied brown with a smooth fluffy texture, can't beat it. Drinkability: Really nice to sip on if your into brown's the only other one I've tasted that compares to this is Avery's Ellie Brown Dog Ale very tasty."
"Overall, this was a pleasing brew. I liked the unexpected addition of smokiness to the flavors of malts and nuts manning the ramparts. The hops bite made this a well balanced beer that made me think I was given the wrong beer at first. Worth trying if you see it. Downtown Brown has sparked my interest in the rest of Lost Coast BreweryÂ’s line-up."
"Notes: Have had this beer about ten times; have really enjoyed it fives of those times; have been turned off or indifferent to it the other five."
"This was a supprising Brown ale. I am usually not a big fan of them, but this one tasted very good. It poured a very dark brown color and had a pretty good head but did not last long. The smell caught me kind of off guard with its smokey scent, but it intrigued me and I could not wait to drink. The flavor was great. It had a little bit of a nutty flavor which I expected, but it had a good hop bite and just a hint of smoke in there too which made this a wonderful drink. If I ever go for a Brown ale again, this will be my first choice"
"Dark Brown color, small tannish foamy head. Aroma is malty, nutty and slightly sweet. Lightly hopped. Roasted malts. Smooth and mild. Full flavor, somewhat malty, slightly nutty. Light taste. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is mild and nutty, slight bitterness."
"F"
"Bottled Dec. 2002, 22oz bomber. This brew was dying to get out of this bottle, cap nearly shot into space. Deep brown with sizable head, light retention and only minimal lacing. This didn't detract from enjoyment. Lots of carbonation in this bottle yet smooth and crisp. Aroma is super malty and sweet. Smells great in fact and reminds me of a good German Dunkel. This Brown's easily better than Newcastle in my opinion and has improved since the last time I had it a couple years ago. Flavor is malty and nutty and body is light yet completely enjoyable."
"I detected, in the flavor, all those common to the brown except there was an uncommon roasted taste here that was interesting."
"A nice brown ale with a good chocolate balance and actually a nice hop finish. Dark brown in appearance with a malty nose with a hint of coffee. One of the smoother Brown Ales out there and these brewers are well known. Body is light and makes beer very drinkable."
"Pours dark brown in color with a creamy light tan colored head that dissipates into a good amount of lace. Nose is sweet and malty with a touch of chocolate. Smooth in texture though the mouth feel is a bit on the thin side. Taste is roasted chocolaty malts followed by a mildly nutty flavor and a dry hop bitterness. Finish is a bit weak. A nice brown ale though nothing great. Thanks to Loki for the sample!"
"The taste was watery, I don't know if it was an old bottle or if it was too cold. After waiting for it to warm up a bit, it was indead too cold. After warming up a bit, I tasted malt, semi-chocolate chocolate. Finished clean, crisp and a little dry. The mouthfeel is a little light, but the drinkability is right on. A good beer, make sure it is just slightly chilled."
"Dark brown in color. Aroma of fruit and a nice caramel. Slight chocolate aroma came through the more I was in contact with it. Moderate bitterness but not extremely noticeable as the beer is still all about hops. Chocolate, caramel and fruit flavors are the most noticeable. A very nice beer and bonus points for the cool label."
"Medium dark brown color. Minimal fizzy beige head. Initial smells of roasted carmel malt, and some sweet milk chocolate. Taste was smooth at first, toasted carmel, sweet chocolate smoothness. Some slighly harsh sulfer or metallic tastes present on the finish. Carmel malt sweetness lingers. Light bodied, water feel. Flavors and feel fall apart to a watery slick, and metallic second half of the glass. Brought a really good beer down to the middle of the pack."
"From Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA. Pours a dark brown color with a medium thick and foamy light brown head. Minimal head retention and lacing. Aroma is alternatingly malty and nutty. Sweet roasted malt and caramel flavors. Finish is pretty weak and was not sustained throughout the glass. I found myself uninterested by the end. Still it starts out pretty well so that is worth something."
"Again another nice Lost Coast Label,beer also looked pretty good nice dark brown color with minimal head.Nice chocolaty smell with some earthiness to it.Taste was sweet but not overpoweringly chocolaty,nice soft malty brown ale.Was maybe a little thin in the mouthfeel dept at times though.All in all a good one."
"4.8% ABV (per a book that I have on Best American Beers)."
"This beer poured a very deep brown / burgundy color.  The head was tan and lacing was good.   Thick mouthfeel, very creamy and smooth.    Good but nothing spectacular.  I might enjoy it more during winter as it seems imho, better suited to that time.    Take it or leave it."
"Pours a very dark copper/light brown with a nice tan head.  Smell is of a nice malt and hops balance.  Nice caramel malt taste comes on first followed by a nice hop balance.  Not a whole lot going on in this beer.  Nice smooth mouthfeel but it does leave a coating behind in the mouth.  Nicely drinkable.  Wouldn't be a bad session brew but that is probably the only scenario that I would like this, kind of dull, there are better brown ales out there."
"Deep dark opaque brown.  A potent nose full of mature hops and cocoa.  Powerful kick of hops with chocolate malt notes.  You expect a sweetness, but it never comes.  Grows even more bitter in the finish, slightly dry in the finish.  Odd mouthfeel, very carbonated, soda-pop texture.  Claims to be smooth, there is nothing smooth about this brew."
"Nothing better than Downtown Brown at the brewery - in fact I met my love through a friend, at the brewery. When she ordered Downtown Brown, I knew this was the real thing."
"Notes: One of the better browns I have had in a while, quite a drinkable little brewski. Up there with New Castle and similar."
