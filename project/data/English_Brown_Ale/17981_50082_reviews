"One of CCB's best IMO. A brew that lures you with it's smell, and satisfies with it roasty espresso flavor."

"Definitely one of the best brown ales I've ever had."

"One of the best beers I have had in a long time. Almost worth moving to Tampa for."

"Great beer tastes just like iced coffee"

"O - Great coffee bean/cacao/vanilla, coffee and vanilla particularly stick out with combined awesomeness. Nice to have this in a low-ABV brown ale as well, nutty and caramel flavors meld extremely well."
""

"Overall-i must say i was seriously disappointed with this, it wasn't a bad beer per se but for a beer that advertised itself as containing vanilla,cocoa and coffee i was excepting much more depth pf flavor, and i felt the feel and look to be quite underwhelming as well. sigh. CCB can't be perfect every time."

"Got this on a recommendation from another patron in the tasting room. I enjoyed it, drinks like a porter."

"Pours a deep ruby brown with  minimal quickly disappearing head. Huge freshly ground coffee aromas dominate. Honestly thats all I can find in the aroma. Big coffee flavors with bits of caramel vanilla ans chocolate. Again huge coffee flavors dominate. Great beer flavored iced coffee."

""
""
""
""
"One of the best I've had"
"Overall: This is a good beer, the flavor profile is great. My only complaint is the lack of body. I feel like this beer would be a lot better if it had a bit more body or some viscosity to the mouth. Otherwise it is a solid and tasty brew!"

"As I drink more of this from my growler the taste becomes ever so nice. It still is not in the 4-5 Outstanding. But its better than an average beer. Also I loved that Ybor attempted to take a brown ale and work it with heavy flavors. Does any one else do this? Or has any one attempted to do this? So I think they deserve a special mention for being daring to try and innovate the industry. But a 4-5 makes me want to shout out loud and share the good news with everyone else, this beer did not raise my shout out loud meter."

"O: Really well done brew, not overpowering on the Cuban espresso, chocolate or cocoa qualities that were added, but a great creative concept. Got this at Whole foods near West Palm Beach, drank in Deerfield Beach, July 17th, 2014."
"Pours a nice dark brown with tan head. Really smell the coffee and hints of vanilla. Taste is similar. Not as bold as I thought it would be. Could have been a little better, but no complaints. Very tasty and refreshing. Another winner from CCB in my opinion."

"Well, I certainly went into this thinking it was a stout. As it's a brown ale, I figured it would be like comparing apples and smaller, weak tasting, less flavorful apples. I've been pleasantly surprised. The roast aroma is rich and rounded, and becomes more so as it warms, if there's cocoa or vanilla in there, it's either so subtle as to elude taste, or it's balanced perfectly with the espresso, complementing and enhancing the coffee's roast, rather than overpowering it. There's some toffee on the back end, but the major player here is wonderfully well-made coffee with a touch of sweetness. I feel the mouthfeel would benefit from a bit more richness, or perhaps a little less carbonation. But then again, this seems to be the norm for brown ales. All in all, I'd have this again. Not right now, but tomorrow. Good stuff."
""

"Bottle: Poured a medium brown color ale with a large light brown foamy head with average retention and not much lacing. Aroma of strong dry coffee notes with some roasted notes and floral coffee notes. Taste is also dominated by strong dry coffee notes with some floral undertones and lots of roasted notes. Body is light with good carbonation. Interesting but closer to drinking a cup of coffee than a beer."

"Overall - Really solid coffee-infused brew. Delivers more than just a 'cold coffee' experience. My heart tells me a deeper roasted flavor would be nice, but my brain tells me this is a brown, so I shouldn't expect that. A fine brown it is."

"O - If you like coffee, it is going to be hard to find fault in this beer. Breakfast/dessert - I'm not sure where this works best. Coffee is intense but there is noticeable caramel sweetness in there too and I get a thick fudgy chocolate aspect as well that never causes this to approach mocha, but rather causes this to slip into a coffee infused dark chocolate cake like dessert character. I like this one a lot."

"Overall (4.25): Oh hell yes. I love this beer. Had it for the first time a little over three years ago, loved it then, didn’t have it again until a few days ago, and still love it. This is, at its heart, a clean, simple, and relatively dry American Brown that pulls in an extremely tasteful coffee component, integrates it flawlessly, and becomes that much better for it. Seek it out, it’s worth it. Plus, at 5.5% ABV, you can have a couple without a problem."
"D: It's tough to emulate a good cafe cubano...and CCB does a fine job with it. Definitely one to seek out."
""
""

"O- cigar city knocks it out of the park once again. Overall a great brew, this hit exactly what they wanted it to be, great brew with great flavors. I could easly drink this in the morning before work haha"

"M- Mouthfeel is heavier than I expected. Especially for a brown ale sitting at 5.5%. It's no RIS, of course. But it's still medium bodied with light carbonation. Feels good sipping on this beer. And I sip because the flavors are really nice."

"O - I don't drink coffee but I enjoyed this beer. Nice depth and complexity."
""
""
"Overall- Definitely let this one warm up as it is much better. Lots of espresso and chocolate with some caramel thrown it. Kind of a mix between a porter and a brown."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Enjoyed this one a lot. It's got a more authentic vanilla flavour mixed in with a nice coffee flavour, and its all supported at the base by the base brown ale. Yet another well crafted beer from Cigar City."

"O) I really enjoyed this beer. Cigar City knows how to brew up some tasty brown ales. It's kind of an under appreciated style, but if you have the chance to give this one a try, do not hesitate. It is unique, and quite tasty."

"Overall this was an excellent brew and one I would recommend and seek out... perfect with a cigar just drinking away... only knock on it to me was I wish it was higher in abv and made more of a sipper.. the higher abv would of lent a great hand into the mix of some perfectly tasting and balanced ingredients that are already present... none the less an enjoyable brew."
""
""
"I left this beer wanting a little more. For what it is, it's fantastic. A nice flavorful brown ale. The nose carries this insane strong coffe smell so you expect something deep and rich but it's not either. The carbonation got in the way and the lack of depth. Definitely give this beer a try. I probably won't be seeking again though."

"Best espresso aroma of any beer I've had! Pours a deep brown with very little cream colored head. The aroma is so good. Deep, rich coffee aroma, with sweet malt and a rich earthiness. The taste is heavy on the coffee/toffee front with a back sweetness from the malt. It almost has the superb mouth feel of Maduro, where I think there might be some rolled oats to increase the creaminess, but I get much less oat than I do in Maduro. Really enjoy this beer when it comes out. Finally got around to reviewing it instead of just crushing the 4 pack in a few days."
""
"Pours dark brown with a thin white head and some spotty lacing. aroma is coconut, coffee, brown sugar, a hint of smoke, and some distant hoppiness. taste is rich and dominated by a fruity coffee taste. wood, pine and maple take over after the coffee makes its statement. finish is sweet and sticky. a nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the beer is fantastic however the coffee seems to mask the flavor of brown ale. It's almost like iced black coffee. I love coffee but still want to taste the beer. A great beer for any coffee lover!"

"taste: the malt and coffee blend very well together. nothing overpowering; this is not a coffee forward beer, but its nice and smooth making it a very drinkable brown. and im not a huge brown ale guy. its a little lighter bodied than what ive come to expect from most browns, but its also got a nice sweetness to it which is a good twist. overall, very well done and very enjoyable!"

"Dated May 10, 11...sooo, not fresh at all being almost exactly two years old. Pours a dark brown body that lets some light through. Huge mocha foam head forms instantly over flowing the glass, cools down into one fingers worth. The smell is surprisingly still coffee heavy. Cold pressed espresso with some metallic notes. The taste is much better with faded espresso beans and some lightly roasted malts. A bitter coffee bean aftertaste. Somewhat creamy mouth feel. I hate reviewing a coffee beer with two years on it, but its not as terrible as I thought it would be. The coffee is still hanging on."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Definitely a coffee lovers beer with bold flavors and a nice hazelnut-vanilla kick. As bold as these flavors are, they balance out nicely. Really enjoyed this one."
""
""
"O-Everything was downhill after the nose, still good but was expecting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a light roast coffee-brown, slightly like synthetic pancake syrup, and it sits in the glass as a very dark syrupy brown. It pours with about a quarter’s finger width of very slightly tanning head that fades from the middle of the beer but stays consistent on the sides. The beer leaves a slight lacing of dry splotchy bubble sheets. The beer’s body is dark and slightly hazy, but seems clean of particles. On the nose, the beer smells phenomenally of thick bitter chocolaty espresso. It has that sort-of stale coffee bean scent that is really quite inviting. It has a grainy yet slightly milked coffee bean smell to it that I am just loving the superb slight creamy chocolate nuances. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and then builds into a lovely coffee bitter. The flavor begins as sweet cacao chocolate flavors that slowly roast in the mouth and become sweet creamy espresso with a touch of bitter instant coffee. The finish is beautiful mocha espresso flavors. The aftertaste is of slight bitter coffee. In the mouth, the beer feels on the thinner side of medium with a creamy, latte-foam feel to the carbonation. The mouth is left feeling slightly dry from the encroaching roast of the coffee beans and some slight acid-neutralizing spittle, presumably also from the coffee beans. Overall, I really like this beer. This is a superb coffee beer, and a superb coffee brown ale. I love the creaminess of the beer, and I absolutely love the balance between the bitter coffee and the creamy, sweet vanilla and chocolate flavors. This beer thrives on superb balance, and is fully worth sampling. This is probably the best none-stout coffee beer I’ve ever tried. Try this beer!"
""
""
"Pours dark brown with ruby edges and a kahki half finger head. Aroma is more in you face coffee than I have ever experienced. Like snorting ground up eapresso beans with a touch of sweet. Flavor is all coffee, earthy bitter up front with a hint od vanilla on the finish. Easy drinking with prickly carbonation. Lighter mouthfeel than I had expectedZ An excellent brown ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall. A flavourful easy drinker which isn't swamped with sweetness like so many beers with these types of flavours going on. I could drink a bunch of these. On a side note, yes it is flavOUrs. I am Canadian and that's how we roll, neighbour. Thanks again Tobey!"
""
"Overall another great Cigar City beer. They make some damn good brown ales and this is right on par. A must try for any coffee beer fan, a good change from the stronger stouts."
""
""
""
""
"Not too rich or sweet by any means. It's kind of watery but still contains large doses of flavor. A finely crafted brew from CCB and one I'd crave at anytime."
""
""
"(O)- The smell is incredible (as a coffee lover), but would have liked to see that carry over into the taste. The sweetness either just overpowers any espresso there might be in it somehow."
"This may be one of the best non-imperial coffee beers I've had. Poured into a snifter. Coffee! Whew! Lots of it! Pours dark, with a large tan-white head. Clings to glass exceptionally well. Smells of nothing other than coffee in the nose. Espresso taste in the beginning, then moves to vanilla and a little bit of chocolate before returning back to a more bitter coffee finish. Props again to ksurkin."
""
""
""
""
""
"Irecieved this in a recent stout bif, served in a CCB snifter. It pours a deep coffee brown, good head, solid lacing. The best smelling coffee beer I have ever sampled, pure esspresso beans. Taste like it smells. he beer is light and easy drinking, well made all around. IMO more of a stout than a brown ale, but who cares, damn tasty!"
"O: I really like this beer it smells and tastes exactly like how I would imagine expresso beer would taste like I am very impressed. It is only okay in the other aspects but the smell and taste more then make up for that. Get this beer if you can a must try for any coffee drinker or fan of coffee in beer."
""
"This poured out as a nice amber brown color with a cream colored head on top. The retention is very good along with the lacing. The ever is big with coffee aromas and some cream. The taste is coffee, roasted malts and some chocolate. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and smooth. Light bodied and drinkable. Overall this beer is very good. Really enjoyable!"
""
""
"There are plenty of beers for beer drinkers who like coffee. This is a beer for coffee drinkers who like beer. Excellent paired with a nice sweet dessert."
""
""
"O - Alcoholic ice coffee (black) is basically what this is. Really, really love this brown ale. Super coffee forward. Would love to have more of this on a regular basis."
""
""
"O: This is a great beer for coffee lovers, I suggest seeking this out. Another great beer by Cigar City."
""
""
""
"O- A really tasty beer and not a bad price ($11 for 4 I think?), this is tasty enough to just savor and sip at, but I could knock these back pretty easily too. A nice go-to coffee beer, if I loved down by Cigar City I would buy a lot of this."

"O amazing! A great beer, and I'm not a brown ale fan. Great infusion of coffee, vanilla and cocoa. Another hit from ccb."
"Wow, this was one amazing beer! After going to Miami and actually having legit Cafe Cubanos in Calle Ocho, I had an idea what I was looking for. I honestly don't think you could get any closer of a representation in a beer, it was spot on. The smell has that sweet, roasted bean body to it, unreal. Taste was similar, maybe a little more vanilla, still amazes me how close to the real thing it is. The closer it got to room temperature, the better it got."

"Pours a nice dark brown with some red highlights, small tan head, decent lacing. Aroma is a soft chocolate and a light Malt and nice coffee. Flavor is a mellow coffee with a nice hint of chocolate and a subtle roast. Fantastic flavor of coffee one of the best i have had. A very well done beer."

"O - Mightbe my new favorite from CCB. If bottles make their way up here I'm in. Coffee lovers need to try this one."
""
""

"Sweet hazelnuts and espresso greet my nose up front. Candied coffee leads to a slightly-watery brown ale base supported by espresso beans. Nose and taste are constructed very nicely. Smooth drinking, totally sessionable. Hard to believe this is the same beer because I really like it. I'd happily drink this regularly -- provided there's no infection!"
""
""
"O - A good,but not great coffe beer from Cigar City. It reminds me a bit of a lighter version of Coffee bender. Overall, I did think the vanilla added a nice sweetness to the beer that prevented it from having too much bitterness from the espresso."
"Poured a very cloudy cedar brown color with a small cap of tannish head that retained as a ringlet and left a bit of lacing on the glass. Nutty aroma rife with coffee grounds. Taste of coffee grounds, as promised by the nose, nutty, caramel malts, toasted grains, grassy and slightly astringent in the finish. Body was about medium, a little thin-tasting, but generally pretty drinkable. Not something I'd go out of the way for again."
"Cigar City has yet another delicious brown ale, with a nice Floridian twist. This is a delicious brew."
"This is unique among the coffee beers I've had in that it's not a stout and the coffee is Cuban coffee. It's a really good combination of two of my favorite drinks and is the beer that originally made me take notice of Cigar City a couple of years ago."
""
"O: Way, way, way better than my previous review. It's still not gonna be a favorite beer of mine, but I am quite pleased to have tried it again."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - it gave me the impression of drinking strong, cold, unsweetened coffee - something that they might have been going for, but not necessarily what i was looking for. some of those flavors/aromas desirable in coffee came across as being a little off in this beer. i think i'd prefer this with a more pronounced chocolate malt presence. i'm trying to be fair, but this one just didn't really bowl me over. my fiancee enjoyed it, but she doesn't have an account on here, so..."
"O: I am in love. This beer has a very easy drinking quality, and with an ABV that is quite manageable, this beer is something I could have all day. The flavors exhibited in this beer are masterful. Espresso dominates, but never overshadows any of the other flavors. If I could by cases of this beer I would."
""
"O: Very solid and rich in flavor. The carbonation needs to be a tad lower for me though."
""
"Cost: $7.99 for a four pack."
""
""
"Overall this was a very unique one. Drank more like a porter than any brown ale I've ever had, and I loved the sweetness of it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is an amazing beer for a style I could take or leave. This brew nailed down the most important objective--having a quality coffee and vanilla taste. So many coffee/vanilla beers fall prey to being too sweet, having no standout malts or hops, having artificial flavors. Cigar City made an exquisite coffee brown here. Very much recommended. 4.5"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O Really nice tasting brown ale. The carbonation in the bottle was completely ridiculous. After is gushed out of my glass I put the bottle down and it started gushing out of that. A little hectic. I'd like to try another bottle again without it blowing up in my face and computer."

"This is a decent beer. It's a nice play on a brown ale. The flavor is complex but I'm not sure if I would want more than one of these at any given time."
"The taste is a bit too thin for me. The 5.5 abv should have been at least 10 for a more balanced taste."
"i am really surprised this beer has such a good rating not my favorite."
"O: This is great; I’d drink this a lot if I could find it. It’s really an awesome beer that brings coffee into a smooth, lighter beer that’s not heavy like a stout."
"Overall - I've never been into coffee beers because the idea never really appealed to me. After having this beer, I can easily say that I've gotten over my unwillingness to try coffee beers. It's rich, flavorful and the coffee flavor isn't overpowering at all. Those who have Cigar City available in your area, I envy you!"
""
""
""
"The taste is really coffee forward, but after youve become accustomed to the coffee, you really feel am underlying sweetness and smoothness that makes it very drinkable and a nice beer."
"This is one interesting beer. They definitely nail that espresso flavor. I just finished a bottle, and I'm headed to the fridge for another."
"I have only had a few coffee brown ales, so it's not hard to say that this one is the best. The cacao and vanilla additions make this beer great. Get one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: The notes of coffee and vanilla compliment the standard roasty and smooth character of the standard Maduro Brown Ale very nicely. This is a well executed play on an already great Maduro brown ale and also a great digression from the standard coffee/stout combination. I'm sold on coffee/oatmeal brown ales!"
"Fantastic. Smooth. Everything I want in a brown ale. Recommended."
""
"Overall: I do actually like the flavors of the beer but the high amount of carbonation makes this beer undrinkable. Hey cigar city figure it out"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: not bad, considering I don't care for very many brown ales.. and coffee beers are quickly falling out of favor for some reason. That said, I was grateful to receive this as an extra and am glad I got to try it."
""
""
""
""
""
"If you don't like coffee, don't try this beer. Stick with regular Maduro. Coffee fans, seek this one out."
"O- Cigar City. Reinventing beer one project at a time."
"Ok beer as I'm a fan of espresso, but objectively it's pretty one-note. I do like the creaminess the oatmeal adds and I wouldn't mind having this again, but I doubt I'll seek it out actively."
"O- Loved this. Gave a bottle to my non-craft roommate on a work trip and he instantly wrote down some info on the beer and asked how he can get it back in Nashville... I think that really speaks to the quality and drinkability of this great beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: A great brown ale with wonderful chocolate and coffee flavors and aromas. The main drawback is the slightly watery body."
"Even so, good beer. Lesser than the sum of its parts perhaps, but its parts are all very very good."
"O - Not a bad beer. I liked it, I didn;t love it. The coffee was great, it was just too light in body to really make me fall for it."
"Overall – I feel that this was an excellent offering from Cigar City. I feel that due to the sweetness and coffee notes, it’s a great beer to pair with desserts. However, it’s versatile and can be enjoyed at any time. Heck, I’d drink this with breakfast. Being a really big fan of coffee beers, it was nice to try a different take on one. Typically coffee is associated with stouts, but Cigar City clearly was able to reach an equally complex beer without adding all of the alcohol when making this one."

"Heavy coffee flavor, but easy drinking."
"Pours a clear deep ruby color with a one finger head. Aroma is straight-up cuban coffee. The taste matches the aroma. The bottles says that vanilla and caoco was added, but I only get coffee. Mouthfeel is thin but not quite watery. Overall, very interesting and unique. This tastes like cuban coffee with carbonation. Not quite as good as the base Maduro, but still great for a brown ale."

"looked like the date code said june 11, so I was worried this wasn't going to be in good shape. glad i was wrong! pour was a mahoganyish brown with a lightly tanned head that really held well and left very attractive splotches of lace. nose reminded me of whoppers (chocolate malt balls) and South Beach Cuban bakeries. chocolate, malt and dark, roasty Cuban style espresso (con leche) with tobacco (vanilla and oak? - well done cigar city), pastries and a kiss of hop in there. it's all there in the taste, but hits me reverse of what i expected. chocolate, malt and tobacco come quickly at first, but are knocked out by a huge wallop of espresso that leaves with a faint hoppiness (that blends the two styles of bitter) and some ashiness. very light medium body for all the flavor going on. not sticky, but slick indeed and very minimal aftertaste. cigar city brewing continues to impress me with their maduro treatments. impressive to begin with, the espresso definitely does it justice, and evokes a sense of place. can't wait for my next trip to FL!!!"

"O - Not a bad brown ale but like I said one has to be a coffee lover."
"O- A very well done brown ale with a nice espresso kick. If this is a sign of what Cigar City does I am looking forward to some more."
"Overall a good beer and with a light body and mouthfeel it is very easy to drink."
"O: Extremely drinkable and very good. If you like coffee, go for this, you won't be disappointed."
"Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Overall: Definitely my first let-down from CCB. I checked other reviews for this beer, and only found one other case where the BA also had an infected bottle. Either I had extremely bad luck, or other recipients of this batch decided not to review. I'm putting this out here for informational purposes (both for the brewer, and my fellow BAs). I hope this is a rare occurrence for what is one of my favorite breweries."
"O - Coffee is too strong and thus no balance."
"O - A solid brown ale with a very nice coffee presence. Nice balance of flavors and a creamy mouthfeel make this easy drinking."
"Cheers Cigar City."
"O: It's a nice light brown ale. Definitely easy drinking."
"Overall - another infected cigar city porter. Booo."
"Overall - Not as good as the other Maduro treatments. It's just a lot of coffee and it doesn't blend so well with the other flavors. Could be better, but it's drinkable."
"O - a fine beer, nothing special."
"It's nothing special in the end... a decent beer but it just doesn't work for me well enough to be a great beer."
"Cheers!"
"O - I think it would be a good beer if you enjoy brown ales. Personally not a big fan of brown ales, which maybe hindering my review a bit."
"O: Good coffee flavor that isn’t too overpowering. Great mouthfeel."
"Well I liked this one so much I might have to take shots of espresso daily. Very well done."
"O= Good beer if you are into coffee beers you need to seek this one out has a strong espresso taste and smell. Very enjoyable beer."
"O: all I can say is that if you enjoy drinking coffee and espresso,s and you're a beer fan, this brew is made for you."
"Overall: An excellent beer. The espresso is just the right strength and the grouping of the flavors is excellent"
"The best brown ale I've had in a while. And it may well be the best American Brown I’ve ever had."
"The bottle has been cooling down for most of the day and I cannot resist any longer! My pour created a dense finger of deep-tan head with moderate retention. Color was a deep brown with limited light penetration and only amber highlights at the edges. Nose took me back to La Maddalena, Sicily, c. 1985 and Sunday late mornings/afternoons, learning how to play Bocce from the natives. You can call it Cuban-style all you want, but espresso is espresso the world over and I readily recognize the scent. Giuseppe Guillermo was the name of the old man who took me under his wing, put a cuppa in my left (non-throwing) hand, a pallino in my right hand and a Parodi in my mouth. Mouthfeel was big, full and tasted like cold coffee. You had best brace yourself for the flavor of tobacco, charcoal and simple roastiness if you plan to indulge in this gem. I no longer smoke (anything), due to adult-onset asthma, but this made me want to light up. For you cigar aficionados, I recommend a maduro, if you catch my drift. The finish left me feeling like I had just finished a Bocce match - my mouth was dry and laden with a taste of charcoal smoke and my heart was racing. Good times, brothers, good times. Say, did I just remember there is another bottle awaiting my attention?!?"
"Serve this to friends and you'll definitely have a talking point; it's very distinctive"
"This beer was courtesy of phisigben from a recent in person trade. Thanks Ben! This beer pours a medium bodied rich mahogany in color with ruby highlights and a one finger beige colored head. It looks a little lighter than I remember Maduro. It smells like Big Sound, of all things, mixed with a shot of espresso. It gives aromas of chocolate, sweet malt, cream, with a light coffee bitterness. The flavors presented are dark roasted malt with a touch of bitter coffee. The chocolate doesn't come in as well as it did in the nose and the overly appealing scotch esque malt isn't present either. The flavor is also short lived and not as strong as it could or should be. It drinks a little thin, and thinner than Maduro and just doesn't feature the same complexity as the base beer. Overall it's a solid beer, but Maduro is far superior in my opinion."
"O- Nice Beer- Thanks Matt! I enjoyed this one, and am glad I got to try it."
"The beer is brown and somewhat hazy, with a thin, beige collar that leaves a fair amount of lacing behind. The aroma consists of coffee beans, tobacco, smoke, roast, leather, and some mustiness. Jeff nailed it - ""This beer smells like John Wayne."" The flavor is more coffee forward than the nose would indicate, with less intricacies than were presented to the olfactory senses. The base beer is still distinguishable, and not overrun by the often dominating coffee scents. The feel is somewhat thin, with moderate carbonation. A decent brew, and quite interesting. Not my favorite coffee brew, but intriguing and worth a try."
"Glad I got to try this one but I liked the original version better for sure..."
"Cheers!"
"Eh, Cigar City is a personal favorite of mine and a brewery I always welcome and look forward to trying more of. This is not one of their better offerings."
"Pours a deep dark brown with slight amber red hinys at the rim with a light fleeting finger of foam leaving the slightest hint of lacing. The nose hits you with straightforward creamy espresso, chicory along with the slightest note of sour funk and toasty chocolate notes. The taste and mouthfeel is espresso con leche, bittersweet chocolate, finishing with milk chocolate - a nice bitter brown ale edge keeps the sweetness in balance. Again there is a touch of sourness in this beer. A very straightforward pleasant tasting and easy drinking beer."
"O - Nothing I'd have again, unless this bottle has just turned somehow."
"Thanks again BlueOkie!"
"Overall... VERY good drink here. However, provides more of a chocolate bent than coffee surprisingly, but hey... nobody is complaining."
"O: This is my second favorite Maduro variation so far right behind ""Oak and Beans."" This is a candy-coffee-toffee lovers delight!"
"Overall - Cigar City met their goals here. It's a very nice coffee flavored brown ale, and I am impressed with the flavor they packed in to a 5.5 ABV beer."
"Overall this is a good sessionable version of their Maduro Brown, but I was expecting more to be honest. I really love the original and the Oatmeal Cookie version but the espresso addition really doesn't add much here. Also, the body seems thin to me, an enjoyable brown ale nonetheless."
"O: I really liked this beer. I love coffee and spice in my beers. This was the perfect mix of both without being too heavy or boozy. This beer is delicious and it's one that I would love to have again and again."
"Fuller medium body, medium carbonation, somewhat creamy and soft on the tongue. I enjoyed the addition of espresso to the already tasty base beer, keep these variations coming, Cigar City!"
"(12oz bottle) Pours a ruby/clear red/brown color with a tan head. Nice carbonation. Aroma is bitter coffe and a bit of malt sweetness. Taste follows suit with bitterness domination. Thin bodied with an oily texture. Huge bitter finish. This beer could have used more sweetness to give it some more balance. I didn’t enjoy this one much."
"Overall this is a good beer. One I'd be happy to drink again in the future."
"Probably the strongest coffee flavored brew I have encountered thus far. Quite an enjoyable experience and would definitely try again."
"Overall: Definitely worth a try for a beer with coffee beans added. It's a little too aggressive on the coffee flavor. Maybe with a little age on it (maybe 6-8 months) it would really shine. As it is, it's worth finding and drinking."
"Light bodied with a bit too much aggressive and prickly carbonation for my liking. For a 5.5% abv beer, there is a good amount of flavor. Would love to be able to get this more often."
"Poured a thin 1 finger head that dissipates into a paper thin lining over the beer. Aroma of strong roasted coffee, sweet malts and a hint of dark chocolate. Taste follows the nose and then some. Freakin delicious! Coffee balances with malts well. Mouthfeel is right where I want it carbonation may be a little high but nothing crazy. Overall it's an amazing coffee brown ale!"
"I've said it before I am not the biggest fan of brown ales but when you mask it with tons of espresso it makes them a whole ton better. :)"
"Poured on-tap at the Cigar City Brewing tasting room in Tampa. Served in a pint glass, the beer has the same body and color of Maduro Brown. A deep, dark brown color with ruby highlights and a light, thin, foamy head. Smells like I dove into a double espresso. Smelling this made the hair on my chest stand up. Bravo! Flavor is very heavy in the coffee, and tastes like I am eating coffee beans. Slight sweetness helps balance the bitterness from the liquid Juan Valdez. The aftertaste is like wearing a used Folgers filter around your neck, with some light, sweet malty and spiced flavors. Dry, crisp finish. Very tasty!"
"Coffee and chocolate notes are big, bold and tasty...it's really hard not to be impressed by this!"
"My first cigar city beer and it wasn't too bad."
"O - So so beer for me. Not my favorite Brown Ale and note the best sue of coffee. OK beer."
"Overall: This beer has a very nice balance to it. I taste the coffee, but I can also taste the elements that make it a brown ale. I'd have another."
"O: All in all, this is not one of the better brown ales or coffee beers I have tried. There are many better. Try if you like Cigar City stuff, or light thin brown ales."
"4/3.5/3.5/3.5/3"
"The mouthfeel here is great, it's got just the perfect amount of carbonation and a medium body. The drinkability is amazing, this one never lasts very long in front of me. Overall, I really have to say that this is a great beer. I love my coffee, and I love my beer, and this is a perfect intersection between the two."
"O-i like this. a lot of intense brown ales seem to borderline a porter or a stout, but this is definitely a brown ale. the body of it is so light. it makes this possible to quaff easily. for a lower ABV brown ale, this is about as good as it gets. i think anyone would enjoy this."
"O: The flavor doesn't line up with the aroma. On the other hand, I'd probably get it again to try on tap."
"I am just loving all of the CCB beers I have tried. I am a big fan of coffee brewed beers and enjoy a rich taste. Cubano Espresso poured a shade lighter than a midnight black, fresh brewed cup of espresso. I kept expecting to see steam wafting up instead of the small head. The smell was nice and inviting with a roasty baker's chocolate and espresso aroma. The taste was big, bold, and refreshing with huge fresh brewed espresso and minty hops dancing in the background to give it a good balance. It's a real eye opener!"
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a one-finger light coffee colored head. Big time espresso aroma. Bold coffee beans and a bit of maduro cigar wrapper. Cuban style coffee definitely shines in the flavor. Big, bitter and bold. Unsweetened powdery chocolate taste, some nuttiness and what is a solid kick of maduro cigar wrapper in the finish."
"O – Another in the long line of CC brews that I really enjoy. This is a winner and a great drinker. Makes me feel like I’m in Little Havana eating some guava pastries and sipping espresso."
"Overall, BOOM for Cigar City. I have yet to be dissapointed with their fine craftsmanship. This beer is certainly no exception. Awesome coffee infusion usually experienced for me in a stout, now tasted in a bomb ass brown ale."
"Overall, had to keep reminding myself that this is based off their brown ale and is not meant to have the full body and added complexity of a porter, although the cuban style espresso smell and taste are just crying for more."
"Those with adverse effects to caffeine need not apply. Color is reddish brown and pours very clear despite the yeast sediment. Head is minimal but leaves a pretty pattern of lacing. Smell is PURE espresso!!! Has a creamy feel with a medium weight that just glides effortlessly across the palate. Taste is again PURE espresso! There is some hops and malts in the finish. A fantastic brew that'll leave you running laps around the house(hello espresso!!). This is definitely one of my new favorite brews. Perfect for those lazy sunday mornings."
"Delicious, excellent beer. This is one of the best coffee beers I've ever tasted - masterfully balanced, & the chocolate really sets this one apart. Well done."
"O: A nice beer from a company I truly respect greatly up to this point. Cigar City has beers that are phenomenal, and then a few that miss for me, and then a lot of solid beers, this being in the solid category. Nice."
"Overall a really nice coffe beer. Some can be over the top due to lack of balance but really well done with coffee/malt/hop balance!"
"O: There is a strange funk in this beer but I end up liking it in the end; the coffee and chocolate are good but possibly a bit too much in the end; pretty decent brew when all is considered"
"Pours a dark coffee brown with a small brown head that vanishes pretty quick. Decent lacing coats the sides of the glass, but doesn't stick. Smell is of strong coffee beans and that is about it. Taste is rather good if you like coffee style beers. Strong notes of coffee, but not to overpowering. Mouthful is too thin and almost no carbonation is present. Overall this beer is decent. Glad I had a chance to try it, but this isn't something I would seek out in the future."
"O- great brew. Would love to have again"
"I did not care for the body of the brew as I felt it was to thin for the type and amount of flavor that was powering through. Would have to pass on this one in the near future."
"O: Over all this beer is pretty drinkable, definitely a must try, but compared to some I have tried very unique."
"Overall not a bad beer, nothing amazing but pretty good."
"O: Like an espresso, this is a slow drinker that will take a while to get through. I think I would really like this beer if it were better balanced and not so dominated by the espresso."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied for the style and carbonation is moderate. Overall, I thought it was a very good beer. They really got some great espresso flavors in there and managed to get them very clean and drinkable. The malt helped balance a little, but didn't add a ton of flavor overall. Loved the flavor to it overall, and one of the best coffee infused beers I've had. It could have used a bit more of the beer flavor coming through though."
"Pours a deep amber/brown with a thick tan head. Great lacing as I swirl it around the glass. The aroma is straight espresso; roasted coffee beans, slight caramel sweetness. Flavor follows the nose. Roasty/caramel malt backbone with a strong coffee/tobacco presence throughout and in the finish. Very strong coffee profile. Slight astringency in the finish, almost slightly acidic. Medium body with fizzy carbonation. Very well put together brown ale."
"Overall: The beer is drinkable, but not sure if I would try and get my hands on it again."
"D: A very nice brown ale and yet another successful twist on a classic from CCB."
"D - Really liked this one as much as the regular version. Would def have more often if I was closer to CCB, but, I'm not. Oh sad. Oh well, very enjoyable!"
"This was the shock of our taster and well worth trying. A big improvement on maduro."
"D: bartender, I'll have another. and another. and another. bravo, Cigar City. by far my favorite of the maduro oatmeal brown ale series. I hope it's as good in the bottle bc I'm on a quest to find some more. such a unique take on coffee beer"
"D- This beer was very drinkable. In fact, I drank half the growler. I'd drink it again too if it wasn't so difficult to get in New York!"
"I'd recommend this for after dinner. I ordered it before, then ended up getting other beers while I sipped on this and drank a majority of it for dessert. It's a great replacement for the post-dinner espresso!"
"If your in Tampa area go to CCB and have some beers!!"
"This was an enjoyable beverage! Makes me want to head to a cigar shop for a Montecristo & strong coffee. A taste of Cuba!"
"D: A great brew, without a doubt, but a little attention is needed in regards to the head and nose. Nonetheless, this is one of the most enjoyable coffee brews I've had to date. Keep up the good work CCB!"
"Pours a dark brown with reddish tints. A bit of off-white head eith great lacing . Smells very chocolatey and espresso heavy. The chocolate malt is probably the single most prominent feature. Tastes very chocolatey and some hints of bitter roasted flavours. There is definitely some coffee background but mostly chocolate overwhelms. Thick solid mouthfeel and fairly drinkable"
"A nice enough beer. Definitely for the coffeeholic. Have to say I prefer the regular Maduro."
"D: A must-try for coffee brew fiends, I really enjoyed this brew a lot -- the aroma really tugs you in and the flavor and feel hold serve with authority."
"D: With a low ABV and a great flavor, I can easily drink a lot of these. Had it with brunch once and it was amazing."
"This beer is pretty good on its merits. It is medium bodied, no real carbonation in the mouth, finish is mildly bitter, not dry, nice midpalate flavors of tobacco and some late coffee roast, overall a very easy drinking fine beer. I would have more of this in the future."
"Drinkability: I think that is has great drinkability. I would session this beer even though it is just over the ABV level. It was all around very enjoyable."
"Pour is a dark crimson, light brown with a lacey dirty-tan head. Major coffee aroma, roasted coffee beans, light cocoa and caramel notes. This is a big coffee-heavy brew, not strong, but the coffee really dominates. Taste is light and filled with roast espresso. The coffee flavor really pops in a weaker abv beer like this, instead of getting snowed under by the alcohol. Real coffee lover's beer here."
"Overall: Excellent beer overall. This is the best flavor I've ever gotten from a coffee infused beer. I really like that Cigar City went a different direction and blended the coffee with a brown ale instead of a stout. I would highly recommend this beer to anyone, especially coffee lovers."
"Spot on for the style with a nice coffee twist. A local brew for me, I hope they keep releasing this in bottles."
"I would have this again, but made sure I didn't drive anywhere. I instantly passed out after having this, two kids screaming in the background too,"
"Really nice variation of the brown ale style with tons of subtle flavors there."
"D: My favorite CC Brew. So glad they decided to bottle it! A bit filling but there is no need to slam a bunch of these beers, better to savor every drop."
"At 5.5% this is pretty easy to have a few rounds."
"Slightly warming, fairly full-bodied, very light effervescence. Very good. A decent coffee note without being overwhelming (and I don't like coffee at all)."
"Had this one on tap in the tasting room in Tampa. This is a modified version of Cigar City's Maduro Brown Ale to which they've added (you guessed it) coffee! The appearance is a medium brown with some red hues coming through, bubbly white head. Great aroma: the coffee really comes through. I forgot to ask exactly what the method for adding the coffee was when I was on the tour (grinds vs. brewed, etc) but the aroma is very full and roasty. The taste finds a nice balance between sweet and bitter from the roasted malts/coffee. A little lighter bodied than I had expected, but this actually makes it much more drinkable. I only wish we could buy Cigar City in Buffalo, as a six pack of this beer would make a winter day much more bearable."
"D- Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer for any coffee lovers. The light ABV makes this one pretty drinkable as well."
"s/m-Has the thickness of the maduro oatmeal brown but with the added kick of the espresso. this was a surprisingly great beer. I don't know why, but I went into this not expecting coffee to go with a brown ale, but the base is the oatmeal brown ale and the thickness of the oatmeal gives the brown ale what it is missing for me overall...and this one has a touch of a stout thing with the espresso. Well worth the try if you can come by this one...would love to get my hands on some more, but like the non-espresso brew, a bit on the heavy side."
"Reviewed on 12/23/2009. Growler from Big Z Beverage. Pours brown with a small white head. Aroma of light coffee, roasted nuts, roasted malt. Flavor of intense coffee with some malt in the background but mostly it's just all about the coffee. As I continue to drink some peanut butter and oreo cookie notes start to come out. Reminds me of a peanut butter pie. All I can say is yum!"
"Taste is fantastic. a very good split between a brown ale and espresso flavor. The brown ale malt complements the coffee flavor and vice versa. A bit of bittersweet chocolate. The drinkability is great for a coffee beer but the mouthfeel is a bit thin. This is a fantastic beer all the same."
"O - For the price ($6 4-pack), it's a pretty good value, and it's something I can drink in the morning or at night. I'll be looking for this again."
"Pours a clearish brown-ruby with thin khaki head, fine lace. Smell: rich coffee, cocoa, mild sweetness, touch of greenish earthy hops. Taste: big coffee flavors upfront mingle with dark cocoa and fade to sweet toffee. Background nutty and mild fruity components. Medium bodied with a relaxed carbonation level. Much tastier than the expensive organic coffee I had this morning. Nov. bottling."
"Draft. Pours a clear reddish tinged brown color with a collared tan head. Nice strong aroma of coffee notes, vanilla, and chocolate with touches of a nutiness that is really nice. The espresso really does take center stage though as it should. Nice roasted espresso coffee notes mixed with bitter chocolate and some bitterness. I also get some vanilla and nut in the flavors at the end. Medium mouthfeel. Pretty easy drinking. Not the best coffee beer I have had but very good."
"D: Drinkability is great, I am completely enjoying this brew!"
"This is a pretty good brown ale that borders on being a light, small oatmeal stout."
"Served from tap into a Dogfish Head stout glass, enjoyed with JackTheBear on a recent trip to Athens, GA. Poured a deep dark brown with a one finger tan head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of BIG espresso, coffee, and cream. The flavor was of roasted malt, espresso, coffee beans, cream, and chocolate. It had a medium-heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. Since I personally don't drink coffee, I could see this as being a damn fine substitute. Had an excellent aroma and flavor on this one. Very well balanced even for a non-coffee drinker. The aroma was almost intoxicating it was so rich. Also it went down nice and smooth leaving you craving more. Very nice brew CCB!"
"Thanks to rtratzlaff for bringing this one my way. 32oz growler into a Hopus tulip pours a deep dark brown with a nice frothy off white head that diminishes to a thin layer and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is loads of fresh ground espresso in front of brown malts and burnt caramel. The taste is a more subtle balance of fresh coffee and dark malts with a nice lingering bitter coffee finish. The beer is light and crisp with smooth carbonation and an interesting kick from the coffee. This is a very unique and enjoyable beer, I want more!"
"Certainly an amazing beer, but my least favorite of the 3 Maduros I've tried so far. While the expresso flavor is great, it really drowns out all the other flavors of this beer."
"Pours a medium brown, thin with no carb., probably due to the fact that it was from a growler. Smells like freshly ground coffee beans, like I had a cold cup of the strongest espresso I've ever had. Tastes like coffee, really fresh cold-pressed coffee, right on. Mouthfeel is kind of thin, but it's suppose to be like coffee, right? Drinkability is very good for a coffee beer, very true to the style.."
"Reviewed from my notes. Sampled from a fresh growler I split with BlessedBeBeer. This beer is mostly opaque brown, but it appears translucent at the bottom of the glass (I'm drinking this out a Maine Beer Co. flute). It has a tan soapy head. As I consume the beer, it leaves behind some good lacework and film. It has a huge coffee aroma, almost as if someone dumped some coffee into the growler before sealing it. All kinds of roasted malts will greet your nose when you take the aroma in. I can taste a bit of sweetness up front; it reminds me of granular sugar (maybe because that is what I would put in coffee to sweeten it up). The coffee flavors come in at the finish and last a long time. There is a lot of coffee bitterness. In effect, it's like drinking an alcoholic cup of coffee. It has a lighter body and low carbonation. There is almost no coating left behind in terms of texture, but there is a lot of flavor that remains in my mouth after I swallow. This is a pretty drinkable beer, but there is a lot of coffee flavor, probably more than in any other beer I've tried. The 32oz growler that Cigar City offers is perfect for this beer. Any more of it and you'll want some friends to share with."
"D- If I wanted beer and coffee, this is it. There's nothing offensive and it's an interesting take on a brown ale"
"Highly recommend!"
"D - This was pretty enjoyable. A couple of us finished off the growler pretty quickly. The low ABV helps here, even though the beer is pretty flavorful. Biggest point of comparison is Coffee Bender, but I think I might like the Surly offering a touch more."
"Poured of tap at Kickbacks in Jacksonville. A small tan head quickly disipates to a rim around the glass. Dark almost black in color. Smell is all coffee. Taste is expresso and hop. Nicely balanced. This is a very drinkable brown ale at 5.5 percent. Very pleased and will be back for more! Another great Cigar City brew."
"Had this is pint glass. Big espresso nose before you even see the glass. This one is completely opaque, but not black. It is more of a dark brown with little head. The alochol is hidden in the coffee aroma and taste. A night capper of a brew because of the overpowering astingence of the coffee. Not their best offering."
"Served in a snifter, it appears a dark brown color with some redness about that looks to be a very deep ruby color when held to the light. A finger of creamy head covers the top of the brew and coats the glassware. Aroma of this brew has a roasty nose of fresh espresso blended with some smokey notes. Dare I say it actually is reminescent of a cigar? Taste includes coffee blended with the cigar/tobacco flavors previously indicted by the nose. This tobacco flavor lingers in the mouth. This brew has a light feel with a mild level of carbonation. At times it feels a bit watery but it makes up for it with lots of flavor."
"D: At 5.50% this might not qualify as a ""session"" beer but it sure is drinkable. This growler will be empty in no time flat. I could drink this with a nice breakfast, or anytime really. It's great that this is gonna be on full time at Cigar City. Now if they would only bottle it as well. This is absoutely one of my favorite beers."
"Drinkability is quite high. If you like espresso."
"D - Easy going down, makes a good after dinner drink. A delicious brown ale, I was just hoping for a bit more complexity."
"Pours a muddy brown color with some tan head and lacing. Scent is of a fresh cup of espresso - dark roasted coffee, not quite burnt, with touches of sweet cream. Taste follows scent - no real grainy or hop notes to speak of, not quite as powerful as it could be. Medium bodied, which makes this one a little more drinkable than your typical thick espresso stout."
"Drinkability: Good despite the burnt roast flavor that I don't enjoy."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a reddish brown with a fluffy head that leaves a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is of tobacco, chocolate, coffee and sin. Taste is just like the smell, I can taste large amounts of tobacco and coffee mixed to a bit of sweet hop bitterness. Slight carbonation really adds to the great texture and flavor. Overall this is a very impressive offering and one of my all time favorites, Cigar City is simply putting out amazing brews."
"D: Very tasty and goes down very smoothly. Another masterfully-crafted brew from CCB."
"D: Quite good if you are in it for the nose. Flavor is subdued enough to make it an easy drinker, fairly low unnoticeable ABV, but an aroma that makes you want to have enough drink. Interesting to say the least, but a little thin in the flavor department."
"Drinkability: Most other brewers blend coffee with stout or porter but Cigar City has gone in a different direction, using a brown ale base - extraordinarily different"
"The beer smells better then it tastes, but ultimately I'm kind of impressed with what Cigar City seems to be trying to accomplish. I'm not a huge fan of american brown ales, but these guys are starting to make me stop and take notice of the style. Impressive."
"D - This one is quite simple to sum up... It's a better than average American Brown Ale with a tinge of coffee... I wouldn't turn down the opportunity to drink again, but I'm not sure you're missing much if you aren't able to procure a glass for your self..."
"Growler shared courtesy of Andrew. Pours a rusty copper color with a brown-tan head, not too big but nice retention on it. Smells of espresso, vanilla, chocolate malt, roasted malt, and cream. Tastes of cocoa, coffee beans, vanilla, toasted marshmallows, and toasty malts. Medium to lighter in body but the carbonation matches it, low and mellow, enhancing the complex but mild flavors. As such, this is a very easy drinker and I would have been inclined to drink a pint of this if it were readily available. I have had more than a few varieties of Maduro Brown but this one is superior to the rest."
"Overall - Pretty drinkable, being so thin it does go down easy but I would rather drink less and have the beer be a bit thicker in mouthfeel."
"A great job by the folks at CC."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, and dry."
"D - Quite a tasty brown ale overall and certainly not too heavy-handed with the coffee character. The addition of chocolate, vanilla and hop bitterness kept this brew from becoming too one-dimensional. Enjoyable but not mind-blowing."
"Ok this is another one of those I think I might accidentally attempt to order this beer at Starbucks instead of at a bar. Straight coffee on this one, although it is very refreshing and light bodied. Unlike the Wake N' Bake from Terrapin this beer is smooth, light, and not very filling. There is a hint of brown sugar and cinnamon lingering around the taste of the beer. This bee is pretty dangerous."
"D - Smooth with lots of complex coffee and caramel character. The coffee is assertive but well balanced by the malt and doesn't overwhelm the palate. This is a very nicely made beer, the coffee highlights the best qualities of the base beer without overwhelming it."
"Overall this is another tasty iteration of the Maduro series - well worth a shot and I look forward to trying others."
"Overall a very sessionable brown. I could easily throw back a few pints of this stuff."
"Certainly not retired"
"This was a uniquely delicious beer. I almost always associate intense coffee flavors and aromas with dark, roasty, smoky stouts. This brew was quite different however. I would love to see other brewers try their hand at making a seemingly ""small"" beer packed with such intensity."
"This is stellar stuff!"
"D – Unless you hate coffee, or are caffeine sensitive, this is way drinkable."
"D: This is easily the best beer from CCB that I've had. Great coffee flavors to go along with the sweetness. I'm very glad to have tried this one."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely, this is some great stuff."
"A little light in body and mouthfeel, lacking depth of complexity however extremely quaffable. Sweet dark malts with espresso on the finish. Some light nutty character. Good roastiness on the finish as well that must be from the coffee. Nice beer but was expecting more from the what the aroma suggested."
"Definitely a coffee-forward aroma, but it's not a really oily french roast or anything, it's more of a hazelnut blend type of thing going on. A little brown sugar and some grainy malt in the background. Taste mirrors this, and the brown ale base is a bit more evident with some lightly toasted nuts and toffee, good amount of malt sweetness. Really nice creamy mouthfeel which is definitely thick as far as brown ales go, but works well for this beer. Really drinkable and I wish that I had gotten more than a 16oz growler. Looking forward to trying more of CCB's brown ales and I wouldn't hesitate to order this one on tap if I come across it again."
"Growler pour from Decicco's, Ardsley, NY. Pours darkest of browns, light black, dark tan head, plentiful and thicker sheeting and bands of elegent lace. Coffee grounds come to mind upon the sniff. Flavorful Brown, some light chocolate, gets overtaken by waves of more coffee. Not overpowering, just flavorful and coffealicious in its approach. Well crafted and enjoyable in all its facets...looking forward to more Cigar City brews in the NYC/CT/NJ/NY suburbs...and cant wait to check em out whenever I'm lucky enough to get back down to Tampa, F.L.A."
"Cigar City, congratulations on a job well done!"
"Pours a clear almost ruby brown color with a tight clingy head that left a sheet of lacing as it dissipated. The aroma is of a big bready malt, nice earthy chocolate and coffee notes, and cocoa powder. The taste is of milk chocolate, cocoa powder, very light coffee flavor, grassy hops and a lemon sourness towards the end. The brew has a very earth quality to it which is nice in brown ales. The feel is surprisingly thin with fairly soft carbonation; finishes slightly bitter. Another very tastey brew from Cigar City. Solid brown ale base with oatmeal to make the ale very smooth. Nice powedery chocolate flavor gives this an appealing earthy quality. I appreciate the 5.5%ABV."
"D: This beer is wonderful. This is what a brown ale should be. It smells amazing, it tastes great. Now I know why Cigar City has the name it does."
"drinkability: I'm still waiting for CC to miss on a beer. Seems like they are perfect!"
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Nice beige head sticks around for just a moment. Aroma is strong of dark, toasted malts and coffee, coffee and more coffee. Taste follows suit, with some mild sweetness somewhere in the background. Great balance upon tasting, not too over the top on the coffee and just a great balanced brown with a twist along with the typical Cigar City complexity. The Cuban espresso treatment is delicious and wonderful. I'm still waiting for Cigar City to make a less than world class beer. It may never happen."
"D - Very high."
"Drinkability- Damned tasty stuff! I really like what the coffee did to the Brown. It was pretty good regular but the coffee really adds a nice dimension that was missing from the regular. I don't think it quite has the zing of Coffee Bender but it's still damned good!"
"Drinkability: The body seems just a hair thin to me, but the flavor is definitely there, which, for me, is the important part. Overall, an enjoyable brown ale."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. nice depth. even better than the regular maduro with the extra added character and complexity from the espresso."
"As a coffee lover this one hit the spot. I'm definitely torn between this one and the original which I loved. The espresso is so dominant in this one that it may take away slightly from the complexity and balance of the underlying Maduro. That said, it's still head and shoulders above most brown ales out there and astoundingly robust for the low ABV. Another winner from CCB."
"32 ounce growler from tpd975, thanks again for our first trade Greg, poured into an oversized vanilla version, shared with Ben, Bob, and Danny last night, color is medium brown with dark red edges, one inch beige head that is rather creamy, decent retention, some lacing at first, aroma consists of heavily roasted espresso beans, chicory, roasted malts, cream, dark chocolate, burned almonds, toasted caramel, and maybe a little vanilla, starts off very dry with a huge coffee component, unlike any coffee beer I have had as far as the consistency and feel, it almost felt like there was actual grounds in the beer, finish has more coffee and a good amount of charred nuttiness, there are not many brews out there other than weasel that make coffee work this well in beer, such a different taste with the freshest and most roasted taste imaginable, super dry, very roasted, and almost chewy mouthfeel, medium bodied, moderate carbonation that allowed this beer to feel absolutely perfect on the senses, taste lingers for a very very long time, could have drank this and another growler,amazing drinkability for a coffee infused beer, very light, would like some with my breakfast in the morning, smooth and crisp, this was hands down my favorite of the Maduros and if this stuff becomes widely available, this brewery is going to make an even bigger name for myself, this stuff is awesome, highly recommended"
"Pours a clear dark orange/brown, some reddish hints, thin light tan head forms, settles down to a thick ring, good lacing, looks about the same as the original. Smell is nice, very malty, caramel, nuts, bread and biscuits, nice espresso roast character, touch more chocolate, pretty nice. Taste is good too, big roast up front, fresh espresso, caramel sweetness, nuts, raisins, earthy, dry biscuits, very malty, nice roasty finish. Mouthfeel is the same, medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. This one is nice, the espresso character is pretty enjoyable! Thanks again Russ!"
"Who wants to trade me the vanilla now?"
"D and overall impression: I am a coffee lover, so I think the drinkability is impressive. Non-coffee lovers will disagree given the sheer amount of espresso beans in this one. Overall, this is another great beer by Wayne and Joey over at CCB. So smooth and at 5.5%, breakfast is a great spot for this one. As far as the American Brown Ales I have tried, this one ranks right at the top! Great! Skal."
"Overall great blend of flavors here, reminded me in some ways of the Percolator Dopplebock in the range of coffee notes. Very impressed with what is going on down in Tampa and cannot wait to get home and try the vanilla one tonight."
"As I sip, my mouth is filled with everything I like about a good morning meal. Huge coffee presence that warms and soothes. Following this is a mild breadiness that finishes sweet and satisfying. There's definite bitterness in here that is pleasant, but the sweetness and the coffee are kings. This is an excellent brown. I realize that it is limited in its release, but get some if you can."
"Pours an amber brown in color, fairly clear with a good sized light tan head that slowly recedes with a little lacing left behind. Aroma is a nice fresh ground coffee aroma, nice and roasty, a little earthy, and a bit of chocolate as well. Some cola-like and light caramel sweetness in the nose blend with the coffee qualities. Taste follows the aroma fairly well, some nice espresso characteristics, slightly bitter and dry, but balanced by a sweeter, cola and nutty maltiness. Mouthfeel is light to medium in body, some malty creaminess mid taste and dry and bitter in the finish. I love a good brown and this definitely fits that description, very drinkable, delicious brown, great for a session, and the coffee notes work very well with it, very natural and proportionate. Thanks to Jay for the opportunity."
"Keep doing what you do, guys."
"D: Put this one on ice cream or in a big gulp, I can kick back and gulp it until the cows come home. This the bench mark for coffee brown ales."
