"Notes:if this were a richer, maltier brew it would be outstanding in flavor. lack of lacing is a problem. despite some flaws this is still a good beer.."

"Overall: Not being a big fan of brown ales, I found this to be a nice change of pace; Shipyard has done a nice job of packing an interesting blend of malty flavors into this brew"
""
"I liked this one. I am not typically a brown ale fan, but this one had nice body to and perfect carbonation. The breadiness and caramel and toffee melded well together to make an altogether well rounded beer that pleased my palate. As far as brown ales go, I liked it."

"Pretty good."
"Thoroughly drinkable beer and a couple of notches above the usual in this category. From the 12 oz bottle."
"Overall - Pretty good brew from Shipyard here. Nice twist on a classic English brown. Not my favorite style, but I enjoyed this one."
""
"O- This strikes me as unusual for a brown ale. The roasty finish pushes the envelope but overall it is balanced and enjoyable."

"Overall: This is an average brown ale comparable to Newcastle."
"Overall I would without a doubt recommend trying this beer. It has a fantastic flavor."
"O - I love how the smell of this beer blends perfectly with the taste. Smelling as you sip gives you a glimpse of ""beer harmony"". Not my favorite style but a very nice beer."
"Taste, is creamy,with al lot of maltiness. Has low carbination and finishes with some sweet raisens."
"Shipyard Brewer's Brown Ale is a very clear, solid brown ale with a thin khaki head that quickly fades to a thin film and leaves decent lacing on the glass. It has a sweet aroma, like caramel mostly. There may be a hint of nuttiness and a hint of coffee, but it's mostly caramel. It's medium-light bodied and lively. The finish is dry and pretty crisp. It leaves the mouth with a slightly astringent feel. It doesn't taste sweet like it smells. It's pretty malty with a touch of coffee and perhaps nuttiness. There's a fair amount of leafy green bitterness. Chocolate and alcohol are in the aftertaste. This is a solid American brown ale. I just noticed the blue star on the orange background on the label. Is that supposed to make me think of Newcastle? Because, I prefer this to Newcastle, I think."
"This is a solid brown ale."
"The pour was wonderful, rich brown in color with a huge tan head that stayed on top forever! Seriously this had to have looked better then damn near anything else I have run across recently, no joke. Just perfect. Aroma is dark fruits, lots of sweet brown sugary notes, hints of clove and light earthy hops, all mixing together nearly perfectly at this point in time. Nice smooth, even carbonation and feel here now as well, really well placed I have to admit. Rich warm flavor here, nice mix of pear, light spice, hints at brown sugar and a nice even caramel flavored dry finish. Hints of plums pick up as I finish the glass now as well, again well placed and nicely balanced. Superb drinkable factor here as this went wonderfully with dinner and everything after."
"Shipyard brewery is a good well-rounded brewery with a wide range of good brews. I picked up this one as the new seasonal. Poured a tantalizing mahogany brown with a cola like head. The smell was sweet and seductive with a hint of roasted nuts and dark chocolate, candied fruits. The taste was rich and creamy with hints of fresh brewed coffee, nutty peanut butter, and dusty chocolate. Last time I checked, this was a brown ale not a porter! But, it was a pleasant surprise and a questionable summer seasonal, yet a good beer overall."
"Overall: Enjoyed this one. BBA does a very good job at just being a simple brown ale."
"Overall, this is a fairly stock brown ale. Nothing outstanding, but certainly nothing wrong with it."
"Overall - very different taste than I was expecting, even after the smell. Interesting in general, and not too bad for the style I think."
"Tell anyone in the UK that they are drinking an original brown ale and they won't bat an eye lash. Except for the slightly elevated alcoholic kick, there is no discernible difference."
"This...wasn't...all..that..bad. Really, it's clean and very easy to drink. It's got some attitude for what it is. Yes sir I like it."
"Pours a deep amber almost brown color with good clarity on the edges. A 2 finger off white to tan head fades but leaves a small head that lingers. Smells of fresh nuts, roasted malts, some toffee candy, and bready yeast. No sweetness on the taste. Some nuts and malts come through but really not much going on with the taste. This is missing the sweet brown sugar that is in some brown ales. Mouthfeel is slightly thin. Overall this is mediocre. Quite sessionable with the taste being decent and middle of the road ABV."
"D - It is very okay. Extremely okay, even."
"Not my favorite English Brown, I prefer the Oak Pond or Samuel Smiths Nut Brown."
"It would be nearly impossible to pick this one out of a blind tasting if it was side by side with its English counterparts. A real treat for malt lovers, or anyone who leans toward the English flavors of beer."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of hops, a bit of nuts. Taste is good, hops, nutty, a touch of caramel. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fine quality beer."
"Nose is a but nutty and of roasted grain and a bit of cocoa. While the taste follows suit it becomes a bit too arid and dry. Roasted notes are dry and smoky in an ashen sense like the morning after coals of a bonfire. Average feel and body but the charred smoke notes return on the finish and keep the drinkability in check. A bit of a burden to drink and could use a bit more residuals to carry through the palate better."
"F: Still somewhat sweet with some spicy flavors. A little sweet brown sugar and almost corn syrup. Not sticky sweet however. A little roasty flavor, just barely. More of that bad bitterness too. A drinkable beer, but has some bad bitter flavors and not much too the beer in general."
"tasty, it would make a nice fall beer as well. Just a seasonal for the spring!! would make a great addition all year long! Nice one from the people at SHIPYARD"
"Picked up a six pack on sale for $7.99. Poured into standard pint glasses. Dark brown color. Fairly good sized white head. Lacing only at the top of the glass, nowhere farther down. Smell was malty and leather-like. Taste was better than expected. Nice dose of malt, with a brown sugar aftertaste. Borderline watery, but just enough body to keep it above average. Low in abv and smooth to drink, both help make it very drinkable. It may get a tad boring after a while, but I polished off three fairly easily. A nice offering from Shipyard and brewed to be a nice session beer."
"Drinkability is what this beer was built for. Flavors are deep but subtle, so you could really drink the stuff all night."
"I really enjoyed this beer. I have a hard time with brown ales becasue they tend to be a little too sweet for my liking. But I think Shipyards is actually quite tasty. The beer poured like it should; a real nice brown color that wasn't too dark. The head was thin and dissipated quickly. The taste was something I wasn't expecting. Definite hints of brown sugar, mollasses, caramel, maybe a little orange and coffee to. But it wasn't terribly sweet. It was extremely well balanced by the bitterness of the hops they added. There wasn't one flavor that was too overpowering and the drinkability of the beer was great. Definitely a beer I'll have again."
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. 2010 issue. Expiration date - Sept. 2010. Sampled on February 14, 2010. The pour is a decent looking ruby-brown tone with a short-lived off-white head. The aroma is typical of brown ales with a significant malty sensation followed by butterscotch or something otherwise as sickly sweet. The mouthfeel is fairly thin and unexciting. The taste resounds with sweet, caramel malts and a background of fresh hops. Overall not bad."
"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Poured much darker than I expected, looks almost black until I held it up to the light. It's an extremely dark brown with lighter brown highlights. the beer has a tan colored head with very little lacing on it, just a small ring around the surface. The smell is pretty good too, very heavy on the malts. Notes of caramel and brown sugar, the hops fill in after. It's a very tasty brown ale, but the hops are not as prevalent in the flavor as the smell. Still heavy malted with same caramel and brown sugar notes, a molasses taste to it as well. The mouthfeel grew on me as I drank it. It's very heavy and full, almost chewy, stout-esque. No carbonation bite or alcohol, there is only a slight bitter finish from the hops. Reasonably drinkable beer, more of a sipper for a nice cool day."
"not overly impressed with this one. i guess this is going to be a seasonal now with shipyard. the pour is dark brown with a slight head and decent lacing. very sweet aromas. the taste is refreshing yet cloying if that makes sense. at first the sweetness and malt balances alright but your left with this weird aftertaste. kind of sour green apple like. more hops and rounded out a bit more this could be alright. as is, not one of my favorite brown ales."
"Overall, this is a decent brown ale, but nothing great. Shipyard's beers tend to have a strong yeast note that does not settle right with me and this is little exception. The fact is I find the flavor profile to jsut be unappealing."
"D- Very easy and very good but since it's a limited edition, what's the point?"
"Part of a twelver I picked up for $12.99, a virtual steal. Twisting of the top this brew has a great brown sugar and malt smell a hint of spiciness but not sure what. Pours to a well, brown, albeit light brown with a huge multi-faceted head. Taste is rather light, as I would detect looking at the AC but, it is not light on flavor or body. The taste is a very steady balanced slightly toasted ale with hints of brown sugar and molasses. Although the taste is steady throughout, the mouthfeel gets a little thin on the finish. The bitterness is really not evident, only a little more prominent at the end where it is still remains subdued and flat. This is an extremely drinkable beer. If you didn't tell me it was an English Brown, I would peg it for an Altbier."
"This beer is a very dark brown, no foam. The smell seems to be very malty, almost tangy. Taste wise I am not terribly impressed, the beer has a strong honey flavor but is otherwise unremarkable. Its not bad, just seemingly very plain. Mouth feel is actually pretty decent, this beer has some fairly good thickness to it. Definitely one of the better, if not best, beers shipyard makes."
"D: Very good and easy to drink. I would suggest this to someone experimenting with craft beers. Most closely resembles a michelob for a macro beer."
"M&D: Medium CO2 and body. Perhaps a little sticky, but still quit refreshing."
"Drinkability: 'til next time, up the ante on the hops' presence, increase the carbonation and make it fuller dammit! However, this beer is not nearly as disappointing as it may sound, in actuality it's quite decent, it's just that I expect more from a brewery like Shipyard..."
"I guess this is an ""American interpretation of the English Brown Ale style"". But there are not enough of sweet creamy malt and too much of odd-tasting hoppy flavours for me."
"D: A very nice brown ale with a nice nutty carachter."
"Overall this is a very good brown ale. I would reccommend it to any beer conisseur."
"The taste is very enjoyable, very light, very mild and at 4% ABV, you can certainly enjoy a few. The beer is quite sweet and has a surprising almondy nut like flavor lurking underneath. The beer isn't complex and there are the slightly diacetyl toffee flavors, there is a slightly prickly mouthfeel very characteristic of the English style. There is some roasted notes, some bready malt flavors, a tinge of hop on the back end. Overall, this is an enjoyable, easy to drink, none too complex Brown ale, that is simple yet very good. The prickly mouthfeel and the diacetyl detract some points, but overall this is a good beer. L'Chaim."
"Off the tap this beer was a pale copper color with good clarity. The slightly beige head was not much more than a skim but it left very good, torn-curtains of lacing. The aroma was of faint caramel malt and biscuity malt. The flavors were very washed out. Caramel malt, weak hops and a hint of nuts of the finish. Super boring, like a 'light' brown beer. The mouthfeel was average/smooth, the body was medium and the carbonation good. Totally forgettable."
"D - Very drinkable with a flavor profile that can be nicely searched and enjoyed."
"D- This is a very enjoyable Brown Ale that I wouldn't mind drinking again. Recommended!"
"Drinkability: This is not a favorite. Compared to the browns I have been drinking lately, this is not overly complex. I will pass on this in the future."
" This is a very nice Brown."
"D- This doesn't taste like a Brown Ale, more like an Irish dry Stout. An overpriced one at that. Overall a disappointment..."
"This is the strangest looking brown ale I've poured. Instead of a nice dark brown you get a lighter colored one, sort of tan.. not too inviting. Aroma is lacking as well but the taste is pretty spot on. Being a brown ale and low in ABV, it goes down almost too easy with a nutty taste. Could improve though."
"The beer poured with a wonderfully sized head and a dark, red-brown look to it. Aromas had mixtures of nuts, esperro, malts and burnt caramel. The taste is wicked good, and probably is one of the best brown ales I have had. Nicely sweetened, but nothing too overpowering. Doughy malts with some nutty flavoring. Mouthfeel wonderfully compliments the drink, making it somewhat creamy and somewhat carbonated. Overall, a great brown ale."
"3/16/2005. I've never really been a big fan of Shipyard but this is one of their better one's. $5 a six pack is a very affordable price too. This pours a dark brown-amber color and topped with a nice amount of foamy head. Malty aroma with a malty, slightly sweet, toasty flavor. Notes of chocolate as well. I guess this is a brand new beer that is going to be released on a limited basis in the northeast that started February, 2005"
"Medium to dark amber in color with a very quickly diminishing head and no lacing. What it lacks in appearance it makes up for in aroma and flavor. Lots of sweet malt with that trademark buttery goodness. Mouthfeel is alright I like my browns a bit thicker and creamier. Flavor is good, nice and sweet with a hint of bittering hops. Light caramel and buttery goodness round out this one. If it wasn't for the flavor I wouldn't consider this a brown ale, it's decent but that's about it."
"A very easy drinking brown. Not too sweet; not too heavy; no overwhelming or cloying flavors and finishes clean. One of the better ones from Shipyard."
"D: Better then average drinkability. Slightly different."
"D-I'm sure I could drink a lot of these, though it would not be my choice to."
"Worth a shot, but nothing to write home about..."
"This is a smooth beer and goes down with ease but leaves behind that chestnut flavor roast on my tongue. It is good beer. not the best but a good beer. A sixpack would be good."
"Overall just an average brown ale, nothing outstanding to separate it from the others."
"Very easy to drink. Nice and refreshing."
"I guess you could drink quite a few of these, becuase it also seems pretty weak in alcohol."
"Way too much diacetyl kills this beer for me. Was this intentional? Boy I hope it's just a bad batch...although I won't have it again to find out. And boy am I sick of typing diacetyl."
"Bottle: Poured a clear brown color ale with a nice foamy head with better then average retention. Aroma of grain with some roasted flavour. Taste is really malt but with more dry notes then sweetness. Some light bitter notes at the end with a weird yeasty finish. Body is a slightly watery with some adequate carbonation. Overall, I thought this was a refreshing brown ale but something seems off with the yeast."
"First sip reveals a lite yet silky smooth body with mild carbonation. Flavor is similar to nose advertising, lots of malt but not overly powerful. I get some chocolate and brown sugar with toffee too. A little bit of harsh burnt flavor, could have just averted severe problems with the beer. There is no real hop presence and ABV is buried too. I think I could drink lots of this beer and not be bored or hammered. A decent brown ale. I hurt the appearance due to gusher action."
"Pours dark dark brown with a thick tan head that disappears into a thin top. smells hoppy and slightly sweet. Tastes slightly sweet with a good hoppy bite and a sort of smoky flavor. Kind of thin in the mouth, small carbonation keeps it interesting. Overall, a good brown ale. But nothing too spectacular"
"I'm greeted with a very loud pop when I pry off the cap. The some foam then almost makes it out of the bottle before I can even pour it into my glass. Great, thock beige head that leaves a thick foam that stays throughout all 12oz. Good deep, yet clear brown, shoepolish hue. Great bubbling and lacing. Just an awesome looking brown ale. The aroma is filled with very rich toasted and medium rosted mlats. Mixed with some English and American smelling hops. The great great blending of hops and malt give this beer a roasted nut flavor with some toffee notes as well. More like bitter toffee. Smooth, clean palate. This is a great session beer."
"M&D - supersmooth, what a great beer, so smooth at the end, this beer would make an amazing session beer, nicely layered and complex, well done Shipyard"
"This beer pours a deep brown color thats notably clear. Theres almost no head on this one at all, and the carbonation is very low. This gives the beer an unappealing stillness. The aroma is pretty nicea soft maltiness with some caramel and chocolate. Theres a slight nut and grain character as well. The flavor is moderately sweet with just a faint hop bitterness. Not much hop flavor to go along with the bitterness. Medium to light in body, with some smoothness. I generally like brews with low carbonation, but it doesnt serve this beer well at all. This is a simple beer. Its okay, but thats about as far as it goes."
"The beer pours a light brown color; a bit lighter than I would have expected. It has a thin off white head. The smell is pretty powerful. It smells of sweet caramelly maltiness. The taste matches the smell. It is very malty with heavy caramel overtones. There are only detectable hops on the back end of the taste, and they are mild. This is a medium bodied beer with low carbonation. Overall, I really enjoy this beer. In general I like malty caramel flavors and this beer does it nicely."
"Shipyard Brown is many nautical miles from being a great brown ale but it is still good enough to try. Its a little lighter than I prefer but there is enough good taste to make it worth an occasional sample."
"Drinkability/Overall: A fairly robust American Brown, good malt and fruit developments and easy drinking mouthfeel. A nice session brown."
"Pours a distinct brown color with a small amount of head, but good retention, and lacing (Poured from a bottle into a pint glass). Has a sweet malty smell with a hint of nut. Has a hoppy taste to it, which is almost balanced by the malt. Has a sweet, nutty, fruity taste to it. Has a medium body to it, and just the right amount of carbonation to make me happy, a nice balance to it. Overall, a good tasting beer. I would suggest other try it."
"D: A nice beer. Its bigger body might not make it an ideal session beer. Quite drinkable nonetheless."
"drinkability: good"
"single bottle purchased at Woodman's and consumed in Madison...the label is notched as best by July '06"
"Pours a dark redish brown in color with an average head and vrry little lacing. Smelled sweet malts, some roasted notes, with coca and light fruitiness. The taste is a more astringent brown ale than i am used to, but it balances with some citrus and nuttiness, a weird combo i know, that gives this beer a certaun strange quality. The beer is medium bodied and as i said is astringent on the palate which hinders the little flavors and makes the stronger ones more pronounced in my eyes. Though easy to drink this beer is not really ideal for sessions. Fun and a more summer style brown ale, this beer lacks some depth that makes this a great brown ale."
"Very tasty overall but begs the question What WOULD Alan Pugsley do?"
"Not terrible, but as with their other beers the strong diacetyl seems a bit stronger than it should."
"D- There is a good malt flavor but it is very thin and could use more depth and character. It just needs more of what it already has and it would be tasty."
"This beer is a little off the beaten path in my opinion. The odd musty metalic sweetness thing isn't bad... Just different. A worthwhile effort. I would drink this again."
"12 ouncer, w/ ""best enjoyed before"" dating notched onto the label, 2006 edition. Pours dark dar brown mahogony with slight ruby hues, quickly leaving tan head, active carbonation, calming down to no head at all and leaving no lacing to speak about, so I wont...nose is of cola, smoke and a general sweetness, tasting notes here of more cola, vanilla, burnt sugars and more smooth sweetness, with a hint of woody smoke.Limited hop qualities picked up in the drinkable English style (at least IMHO) Brown This would to the job with some smoky BBQ...Pleasant unuf quafer, respectable sessioner...decent brew to try ""craft"" beer beer with some newbies, or non ""dark beer"" drinkers."
"I'm not quite sure that I'd use the word 'special' to describe what I believe to be Shipyard's inaugural Brewer's Choice Special Ale. By the same token, it is a tasty brown ale that kept me interested all the way to the bottom of the bottle."
"Overall, it's a decent, enjoyable brew that's more American than English in style, but with some clearly English components."
"This beer pours a dark mahogony with a small dirty white head. The smell is full of yeast and has a strong nutty quality to it. The taste is nutty as would be expected and also malty with some dark fruit flavors. The m/f is light with a flavorful first sip,but the aftertaste is watery and mettalic. This is an Ok Brown Ale, but I think I'm being kind in this review."
"hm, not bad - it would make a great session beer if it took one's fancy. hoppy and ornery for a brown ale."
"Dry and light bodied, just way too over carbonated. Im not excited about having this one again  but I would not turn one down, either."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It seems a cut above the average Shipyard product. It was a dark red/brown color with a medium coffee-colored head and some nice lacing. It had a rosted grain odor, not too toasty. It tasted sweet, caramel/chocolate, with a little hoppiness. A fairly robust brew, very drinkable."
"From the Captain's Collection, a real nice brown ale. Pours a nice dark golden brown color. Smells malty, not too strong. Taste? A real nice malt flavor, a little earthy flavor too. Mouthfeel is pretty nice. Finishes up nice, a great session beer. I'm quite surprised by this one. Shipyard's product seem to be a bit bland as of late but this one is a really great beer. A nice addition to their list."
"Appeared dark brown in my pint glass with an off-white colored head that left a touch of lacing. Seemed rather viscous in texture and opaque in color. Aromas of toffee, roasted malt, nuts, and hard candy; very appealing. The taste was dominated by roasted malt flavors, but other subtle flavors came out as well such as nuts and hard candy. Slightly bready in texture and coated my mouth nicely. Excellent drinkability; smooth and flavorful."
"12 oz bottle pours a deep, clear brown color with a small foamy tan head that leaves a some lacing in my glass, roasty nutty-bready aromas. Nutty, caramel and buttery flavors, finishes on the sweet side. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel, an average brown at best."
"This is a welcome change this time of year. Much more flavor than other Spring offerings. Very rich brown color and is bursting with malts and hops. Medium body and not as heavy as the Winter Ales, but has just as much flavor and appeal. Very enjoyable and will be missed when it is off the shelves."
"Sure, the quality of the ingredients were decent, but not enough to say I'd drink this again. Even JWD HB seems like a better choice."
"This beer pours a nice shade of copper from a twelve ounce brown bottle. It smells a bit hoppy. Taste is quite a bit hoppier than I would expect for the style. The malt is apparent, but at times seems overwhelmed by the hops, not actually a bad thing, but also not really true to style. I could drink quite a bit of this, I do think it's pretty good and definitely worth a try."
"Definitely gets good marks for drinkability. It was truly an enjoyable experience."
"A clean dark brown beer with ruby highlights. Has a big foamy beige head. A smooth easy malt aroma with hints of carmel and coffee. A quick burst of coffee in the start of the taste followed by some carmel sweetness and a dry hop finish that gains momentum thru the glass."
"Overall a good year round brew."
"Mouthfeel is smooth at the start and finish. Medium bodied. The aftertaste has some caramel and butter riding the tongue briefly. I found this to be drinkable despite the strong butter tones."
"At 3.8 % ABV, a good session beer. Diacetyl flavors are hidden a bit. If you like Ringwood beers this is the one to try. Its not as dark as I would expect a brown ale to be, but it is very falvorful for a mild brown. Definatly worth a try if you're at Federal Jacks or in the Kennebunk area."
"I notice what I wrote five years ago still holds up except that the carbonation is very high. Now, it's almost spritzy."
"Drinkability is slightly above average, but the overcarbonation is a major distraction. Seems out of kilter for style, but not a bad beer. Very little hops presence."
"Very smooth and creamy brown ale. Juicy caramel malts with a creamy mouthfeel. The buttery tastes are nice in this brew from Shipyard. With some of their beers the Ringwood can be out of control. In this case it appears the diacetyl is controlled. Well balanced with a nice hop snap bite on the finish. Very good drinkability that could work as a nice session beer."
"Pours an off-white, three-fingered head, fades slowly and leaves some lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Deep, rich amber color. Malty nose. Starts malty with the underlying sweetness, has a rich finish. Nice brown. 83¢ for a 12oz bottle from Cumberland Farms Convenience Greenland, NH."
"This brown ale isn't really brown. Dark amber, maybe brownish tints, but that's it. Smells sweet and a little malty, but mostly just sugary and sweet. Taste is not what I expect from a solid brown ale. Tastes a little fruity and I guess a little malty, but not roasty or toasty like I was hoping. Hops don't really play a big role in this beer. As for mouthfeel, this beer is too light bodied to be a brown ale, even an English brown ale. Very watery. Smooth yes, but not very substantial. As a side note, I bought a Shipyard mixed 12 pack and the brown ale, IPA, and Export Ale all tasted very similar, and equally uninteresting."
"A very drinkable beer. One I'll look for again."
"Poured a red tinted brown (as the name might suggest to those sound of mind). Head was limited but there was a bit of lace that draped itself out as the beer level in the glass was depleated. The smell was of wheats and malts and I found a distinct woodsy nutty flavor to it. There was also a distinct buttery sharp smell, and a small hop bitterness lingered in the back. A very interesting smell overall. The taste was a dry burnt woody taste, with some small citruisy flavors, and a bit of bitterness which tastes more like a tart chalky apple than hops, but very subdued. I like the flavor although I find it hard to pinpoint. Mouthfeel is dry and smoky (without the actual ""smoked"" flavor) and pleasantly carbonated. When I see the alcohol content I can see that this beer lets you know its slightly less alcoholic that a ""regular"" beer, but its certainly not dramatically evident. Very drinkable."
"Drinkability: Decent version of the style with the caramel flavoring setting it aside from other Brown Ales. Too sweet to have more than a pint or two though."
"The beer pours an actual brown color. This has to be one of the few really ""brown"" ales. The head is thin, but laces nicely. The aroma is great. There is a strong roasted malt presence here. The taste is also malty; really malty. It tastes sweet, but not in a bad way. There are a number of caramel malts in this one; a real treat. The mouthfeel is good. It has a medium body on it. I find it to be quite enjoyable and in turn very drinkable. Some may find this to be too malty, but I feel that this is a true brown ale, not only in color , but also in aroma and taste."
"Pours a deep brown/amber color with a light to medium head that dissapates quickly,aroma is sweet and a little chocolaty with light earthy tones.Taste is pretty sweet and chocolaty maybe a little to sweet not enough earthy tones for me in this beer.Could only have one thought it was a little to sweet for me."
"Tastes of sweet malt with medium body. A little overly sweet. Not too many flavors. Kind of like a sweeter Newcastle. Needs less sweet and many more nut flavor."
"Overall a nice Brown ale. Not being a fan of the style I was surprised by the hoppiness of this beer. I would venture to guess this is why I like this one so much."
"On tap at Federal Jack's in Kennebunkport. Decent dark brown color, thin tan head. Smell was sweet enough, and malty, but had a slighly sour off nose to finish.Taste was a little dissapointing. Syrupy like, sweetness, but a wierd slippery, finish lingers. Unbalanced sweet, and thin. I think I expected more out of this, maybe it was the bottom of the keg. I bought a couple bottles to bring home, and try out as well, but the first one I had tasted the same. Call in Mr. Puggsley, this one needs a little work."
