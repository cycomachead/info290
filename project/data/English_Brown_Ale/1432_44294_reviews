"Overall / Drinkability:  A full flavored brown ale, but I would not have guessed it for the English style of a brown ale.  Very tasty and easily drinkable.  I think I could easily have another."

"English porter?  Baltic porter?  It seems like theres a little more going on in the glass than the can led on."

"Overall, we are thankful to have this recommended to us by Benjamin at The Brick Oven Bistro in Sandusky, Ohio.  We had the pleasure of speaking to him a week or so back, and he was able to offer us some of the premier beverages available in central to western Ohio.  This was among the top on his list, and we are very happy to have tried it.  The nose is incredibly sweet and rich, akin to the liking of Southern Tier’s Crème Brule, but to a slightly more subdued extent.  The flavoring, on the other hand, showed a much more bittered, and even smoky approach, allowing for a serious side to this brown ale that was otherwise not yet appreciated.  This is an exciting beer for a small brewery, and it leaves us wishing they had wider distribution to keep us warm through the winter months."

"Pours a slightly darker brown. Nose is great on this one. Strong nut tones with brown ale as well. Flavor is nice. Good nut tones with malty brown ale aspects. Fairly smooth and well done. Easy to drink. Typically, brown ales are not really my thing, but this ended up being a nice one from Jackie O's."
"Great malt character. I don't get much of the honey, but it's a nice, fairly complex, malty ale. The metallic character somewhat offputting. As it warms, aromas of acetone emerge. Houston, I think we have a problem. Drink cold...and quickly!"

"The Chomolugma English Brown from Jackie O is decent...the beer poured a cloudy opaque brown with thin ecru head that is not lacing. The scent carries maple sugar and subtle sweetness. The taste starts as a typical brown bready then transitions to bitter with a nuetra sweet like finish. The mouthfeel is full in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a very interesting brown and well worth a try."

"Pours a ruddy brown color with an off white head and a fair amount of lacing. Aroma is malty, a bit toasty and nutty, and also some floral hops. In the taste, mildly nutty with a good dose of medicinal hops. Not getting much honey, which is fine, I'm guessing it fermented out. Light alcohol flavor. Light watery body. Decent ale but only just that."

"4.5 D: Really solid beer. Maybe I'll actually order it next time I'm at JO's."

"The honey certainly adds that sweetness that makes this beer a bit sweeter and more robust than other brown ales."

"O - first offering I've had from Jackie O's outside of their pub and I must say its a pretty darn good brown ale. There is nothing mind blowing about it as the can may suggest, but it is top shelf quality and a good ale to enter their canned lineup. Ill buy again for certain and I look forward to experiencing more offerings from the ever expanding Jackie O's brewery."

"Hoo hah! The Crack! awoke Kong King Chomolungma with its loudness, setting off an avalanche in which we hid in the same crevasse to escape its wrath. Ol' Boy was looking at me with all four of his eyes until I inverted him and began a heavy-handed Glug. It didn't help matter that he was another craft brimful CAN, but I got him upturned all the same. The pseudo-cascade was quick to subside, creating a dense finger of light-tan head as its result. Color was a deep, dark-brown (SRM = 44), allowing only minimal light penetration at the edges. Nose smelled of dark chocolate, roasted peanuts, fudge. It reminded me of my late-Pops' favorite ice cream - Rocky Road! Mouthfeel was big, full, and creamy and the flavors melded together so nicely that it could have been Rocky Road or a liquified Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, but either way, it was totally evocative of my late Old Man. He really got sent by the chocolate/peanut butter combo and went for Tastykake Peanut Butter TandyTakes as well. Chomolungma was not really happy with the way I was describing him, so I began to back away and make my way up and out of the crevasse. The finish left me with notes of leather, smoke and more of that choco-nut flavor that had been its trademark throughout. No wonder Jackie O's has the solid, stellar rep that they do, if this is indicative of their beers. I am a self-avowed hophead and yet, I REALLY want more of this one, especially on Saturday, 01 Feb, for the annual Hula in the Coola Day!"

"Taste is rich and chocolaty, with the sweetness pretty dominant - though it never gets cloying as a nutty tannic flavor melds with some hop bitterness to clean it up pretty quick on the back end. There is a little Mouthfeel is really rich for a brown ale, but thats certainly better than the alternative. Nice beer, certainly different than your typical - but it works pretty well."

"4/3.75/3.75/3.75/3.75"
"12 ounce can into pint glass, no canning date. Pours very hazy/cloudy dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, toast, toffee, brown bread, honey, nuttiness, raisin, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and honey notes with light hops; and good strength. Taste of big chocolate, caramel, toffee, brown bread, brown sugar, toast, honey, nuttiness, light roast, raisin, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, brown bread, toast, honey, nuttiness, raisin, light roast, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and honey flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent brown ale! All around great balance, robustness, and complexity of dark/roasted malt and honey flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O. An ideal brown ale with a little extra hop bite (not big mind you, just enough to notice). The honey that is advertised isn't apparent, but that's ok with me (Beer with honey can be too sweet to try to convey the honey notes, not the case here). My first Jackie O's offering, I can only hope I can get my hands on others and that they live up to how well done this is."

"Overall I haven't had many beers from this brewery but this is one solid brown ale. I picked up a few more canned offerings and I look forward to them."

"O: a flavorful and distinctive brown ale in a can. Recommended."
""

"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. Overall a solid brown with lots of unique character. I would absolutely drink this again, thank you Heath for gifting me with this."
"O- this is an outstanding example of the style and underrated IMO. Full flavored with nice chocolaty notes. I'd gladly purchase this again"
""
"Mouthfeel: This beer is a bit on the thin side for a brown ale but Jackie O’s makes a nice attempt at a rather hard style for me to judge."
""
"Even with its honey infusion, much of that floral nature gets covered up by malt and alcohol complexities, as its sweetness is well attenuated for dryness. But after that first sip, we don't care about the honey. We favor the taste that's most present in the ale- and those are effortless and complex."

"super drinkable."

"This beer is medium bodied. It leaves a little coating on the back of the tongue and finishes slightly dry."

"Overall - Very good brown ale overall. If brown ales are your thing, strongly recommend checking this out."

"Taste-Milk chocolate, toasted malt, faint coffee with cream, subtle honey sweetness and gentle roastiness. A nice, tasty Brown. Recommended."

"Jackie O's nails this brown ale, it hits the brown ale right in every direction not typically huge on brown ales this however is excellence in a can. Beautiful nearly black but it let's enough light to create a crimson mahogany, light tan head velvet textured fine even lacing. Aroma explodes when you open the can, toasted nuts with creamy chocolate notes, hint of honey and cereal grains it's good enough to put your nose in the glass. Flavor wise so smooth, perfect cohesion no clash of off flavors, this is complex brown ale at it's best with a nutty caramelized sugar from the toasted malts, the wildflower honey is full fermented out no residual sweetness you find in most honey beers, this is a flagship beer for a reason. It goes great with a Romeo y Julieta Reserva I'm smokin' adding cedar and spicy Republica de Domincana tobacco to the mix. I can't help but enjoy every sip, earthy hops finish the taste leaving a balanced brown ale on the table. Smooth even keeled carbonation cleanses the palate, medium bodied brown with enough abv too give it more complexity on the palate at 6.5%. Overall an anytime beer, that I'm proud to buy local in Steubenville Ohio at Valley Wine Cellar beer drinkers keep this stuff moving off the shelves maybe we will catch an expansion of their brewing operations to see some of their sours move into mainstream distribution, I'm still planning on a pilgrimage to the brewery maybe next weekend...there is a bottle release."
"The feel is balanced in a medium body verging light as a tea-like note tames it down. It's got crispness and creaminess in moderation, a little thin and herbal in the end."
"Overall - Nice light brown ale. Not overly strong flavors, but smooth, balanced and easy to drink. Nice hop flavor at the finish, works well with the nutty malts and caramels. Worth a drink for brown ale fans."

"Grade: B"

"12 ounce can. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy brownish/red color with about a half inch light tan head. There's a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice and nutty, the brew also smells like toasted malt, bittersweet chocolate and honey. It tastes like nuts, toasted malt, wood, honey, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and a bit of dark fruit. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and smooth with a good amount of carbonation. It's one of the better brown ales I've had, glad I bought a sixer of this! $8.99 a 6-pack."

"This beer was much darker than I expected. It still had a nice mouthfeel although a little different from other brown ales I've had. This isn't to say it was bad, it seemed more smooth or velvety than other brown ales I've had. The taste was great, probably the best brown ale I've had so far. A little spicy with noticeable bite but smooth enough for the style. I would highly recommend this beer; it is the best I've had from Jackie O's so far."

"Nice English brown ale. Not as sweet as I would expect an English style to showcase but really nothing wrong with this."
"Overall a really nice take on a solid base beer."
""
""
"O- Not a huge fan of this style, but I found this one fairly easy to drink."
"The aroma was really very well done I have to say. Rich notes of roasted malts and hints of chocolate were riddled throughout. Really a very big aroma here with some nice touches of caramel and a touch of a woodsy peat like aroma. The flavor was very nice as well. Warming, with a rich chocolate and roasted malt flavor. Very coating, though I have to admit it did come across a touch light on the feel for me."
"Overall impression: enjoyable complexity and well-crafted."
"A pretty good nut brown. I really like the coffee notes found in this beer but there is just something keeping it from being stellar."
"Pours a nice dark brown with a touch of head. Vry crisp and clear on the corners of the glass. Smells lightly of roast and coffee. A touch of sweet malts with a semisweet chocolate aroma. By light on the tongue but full of flavour. Tons of coffee and roast. A hint of chocolate. Sme nice almost caramel as well. Solid mouthfeel for a beer so ""thin"" if you can even say that. Vry nice overall"
"Fo good beer. Nice mix of coffee and chocolate."
"On tap the pub poured into a tulip...Medium brown pour, nice red in the middle. Nice light tan carbonation...The aroma is malty, caramel, bread, honey, a hint of cherry, a little nut, yummy and complex...The taste is like the aroma, sweet notes of honey, cherry, and nuts but a little coffee to balance this out. I didn't know what to expect out this organic brew but it came together really well. My favorite non bottled beer of the weekend."
"This is a very drinkable, tasty rendition of the style. One worth drinking, and even seeking out."
"nice looking beer, good dark color. a nice sweet smell to the beer, malty, but not much else there. taste gives off a sudden blast of sweet brown sugar. a decent brown ale - a great balance and mouthfeel. gives a crisp splash of carbonation on the roof of the mouth which is a nice taste. good beer."
"Drinkability: My second offering from Jackie O's and another solid beer. You can definitely taste the same roasted barley and earthy flavors in both of their beers. I am looking forward to trying more."
