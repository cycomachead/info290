"O - Pleasant brown mild."
"Enjoyed from the 12 oz bottle in a snifter, this excellent example of a brown ale pours a clear perfect reddish brown with a thick creamy off white head and moderate lacing.  Nose o roasted malts and a dash of herbal hops.  Flavors are nutty malt goodness, sweet caramel malts, light toffee, and a dash of light herbal hops on the back that makes this a rather easily quaffable brew.  Moderate carbonation, and a solid improvement with warmth.  Not overly sweet, this is a solid example and an excellent brew to pair with a spicy meal.  Very nice."

"Pours a semi-clear brown color with average head and extra nice lacing. Aroma is very light and hard to pick up any concise elements. Taste is light, with malt, light almond and a considerable amount of sweetness. Overall, a light brown ale with not a lot of bold flavors or components..."

"not the worst beer i've ever had"
"I prefer browns less sweet than this one by Bluegrass. It was difficult to detect nuttiness apart from slightly resembling a marzen's character; and although carbonation held, I couldn't keep from wondering what it would be like to find sweetness in the aftertaste, not at the front.  Like the M&M standby ""melt in your mouth -- not in your hand!"" I wanted the sweetness to find me not smack me at the onset practically before I'd raised my hand-held beverage to sip!"

"This is just a nice brown ale.  Color is a murky brown with decent enough head retention.  Both the smell and taste are what you'd expect - very mild with caramel malt dominating.  Very low bitterness.  Smooth on the palate with a very sweet finish.  If you're looking for a nice brown ale this one is worth a try."

"This is a pretty interesting nut brown. Has some nice character to it, with a bit of a vanilla tone that I find unique. The drawback is that it is a bit too sweet, from my point of view. Still pretty nice though. Frankly, if only a few more things were tweaked on this beer, it'd be smokin;''. For now though, it will remain decent."

"O: an easy drinking ale with a complexity i didnt expect. Very smooth and very flavorful. Enjoyed it thoroughly."
"O- This used to be one of my favorite styles. After drinking so many BA Imperial Stouts and DIPAs it's hard to drink thin watery stuff like this but it has it's place and I think this is a decent representation of the style."

"Tasty session beer. Not outstanding, but solid."

"Pours a medium bright brown color. There isnâ€™t much head and it is a bright white. This beer smells a little sweet and almost fruity. Not a lot on the nose. It tastes of chocolate and coffee with a bit of a malty/nutty aftertaste. Light bodied, drinkable, just not much flavor. I guess I am getting used to the ""American"" style Brown Ales."
"overall, i believe this average at best. this would be a beer that i would recommend to someone who is just starting to get into microbrews because of the lack of complexity and the fact that its rather light on the tongue."
""

"Overall this is a very solid brown ale and one that I would seek out."

"Tasty and drinkable."
"D: a little up and down and all around. this brew smells great, but i thought the taste couldnt match the expectations set. overall, a quaffable brown, but not exceptional."
"hazelnut color and a light offwhite head that capped the top with vigorous carbonation throughout. aroma is sweet, lots of caramel and roasted nuts, hints of bready grains, touches of light earthy hops, really quite nicely done i have to admit. moving forward there is a clean, crisp feel to it, smooth medium body is well deserving and shows off the overall profile very, very well. i was quite impressed with how easy this was. flavor is dominated by caramel and roasted nuts"
"Overall a very satisfying nut brown ale. Very solid flavors and an eastmy drinker to boot. Not going to knock your socks off but will leave you wanting more after each sip."
"I was concerned this beer might be a bit too old, at right around 6 months since bottling, but it tasted just fine. It seemed to open up with more flavors as it warmed. Overall a solid brown."
"O: I don't think I would get this one again, but it was style worth my sobriety just this once."
"Despite the crazy head to begin with, the beer doesn't feel overly carbonated. I bought a six pack and am sorta glad that I gave two of them away."
"Full bodied malty ale. Good beer but nothing overly amazing."
"O - A good brown ale thar's worth the price,"
"Worth a shot if you like the style."
"O: I like this beer, very easy drinking and the caramel and nut flavor was really good. The hints of chocolate was a nice addition."
"Drinkability: Very easy beer to drink due to its smoothness and decent flavor. It could use a little more depth but I could easily drink a few of these."
"Overall I wasn't a huge fan of this beer but there was nothing terribly off-putting. Not worth seeking out but not worth avoiding either."
"Drinkability: Nothing to write home about, but this brown ale sufficed for tonight. I'd be interested to try it fresh."
"D: The beer is good, especially if you are a fan of nutty, molasses tasting beers. I myself find it far too heavy on the malts and light on the hops to drink more than one. It just coats my mouth and tastes sickly sweet after just a couple of sips."
"There is some that this beer does well, but the nutty taste is just off...and that really hurts the enjoyability of it. I stopped trying to finish my 6 pack."
"A nice, complex, but drinkable craft beer worth seeking out for those in the area. Very nice interpretation of a traditional English style."
"Overall: Very pleasant and surprising experience! I expected a stereotypical American ""Brown beer"" but was treated with a complex yet drinkable Craft Beer. This beer would be ideal while watching an old English show (monty python, Red Dwarf and Dr. Who come to mind), or perhaps during a board game involving lots of pondering and back-stabbing."
"Drinkability: Enjoyable, but overall a little too sweet. The sugar/candy like sweetness was excessive and not counterbalanced by enough of a malt backbone."
"Drinkability - This is a decent little brown ale. Not the best, but definitely worth a try in my opinion. Solid. I wouldn't have a problem drinking a few of these. It seems that every Bluegrass Brewing Co. beer I have had lacks a bit with the head and head retention however."
"Malted milk chocolate is the first thing that comes to mind when I smell this beer and maybe some nut like hazelnut, actually it smells a lot like Nutella! Weird. Medium mouthfeel. Roasted malt taste with a touch of smokiness. No realy hop bitterness to speak of. Subtle sweetness and pretty smooth. Very light taste of light roast coffee as well."
"D- I picked-up a six pack drank that in an evening and still wanted more"
"This beer is ok and blended good."
"D- A very good offering from BBC. Deep rich flavors and a great smoothness makes this a good brew."
"D - Very sweet, but not to the point of being a dessert beer. A little heavier than most ales, but lighter than a porter or stout."
"Poured a deep, clear brown with reddish highlights. The head was tan and creamy. The aroma was largely malty sweet. The initial flavor was thickly malty with some faint hop bitterness coming through. There was a faintly licorice and woody taste with some syrup flavor. While it was not cloying, the combination of above flavors kept this one from being refreshing. The mouthfeel was thick and chewy with moderate carbonation. This was far from my ideal brown ale."
"drinkability - this one is just light enough to drink a couple and tasty enough to eat at your next cookout. A solid BrownAle indeed."
"Pours a hazy, amber color. One and one half inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, slight sweet malt, slight toffee, slight nut, and slight olive-like smell? Fits the style of an English Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of yeast, sweet malt, slight roasted malt, and toffee-like sweetness. Overall, not a very complex beer, and a little too sweet."
"Not a bad brown ale, but not a spectacular one, either. Overall, a good aroma and flavor, just too weak to carry it far."
"D: Very drinkable if a little bland."
"Light to medium brown in color with little to no head. The nose is nice and malty with only a hint of nut. Refreshing attack and a light and fresh flavor. The mouthfeel is light and ordinary. Some roasted flavors of malts and a little bit of a coffee like roasted flavor as well. There is just the slightest hint of nut, which is okay by me."
"Bluegrass Brewing Company (with a few notable exceptions) puts out solid beer across a wide range of styles. Nut Brown Ale is probably worth a look for fans of the style, but I'm glad that I don't have five more bottles in the fridge."
"This brew is drinkable and enjoyable. It has a medium gravity ... a nice malt-based beer; no extremes in this one. Fairly average across the board, but still, a good ""get"" if you're looking for a sessionable brew in the ""malt"" column."
"Poured into pint glass from 12 oz. bottle. Nice appearance. Two finger head that quickly dissipates with decent lacing. Nice aroma of malt and chocolate with a little coffee. Taste is ok, but a little on the thin side. Good flavor, just not enough of it - a little watered down tasting. Malty sweet flavor with a subtle chocolate nut in there. A hint of hop bitterness in the finish. Decent carbonation but a thin body (this a good hot weather nut brown in that respect). Solid drinkability. I probably won't seek this one out on a regular basis, but would never be disappointed if it were handed to me at a party."
"D: Not overly complex, good flavor, low ABV, easy to drink. Not a bad Brown Ale."
"Drinkability: Another good example of the style, I could drink several of these. Not the most complex version of a nut brown, but a solid flavor profile"
"This one isn't too bad, but the main issues are the thinness and the watery taste and feel, and it could be better balanced for sure. I'd give it a try just to check it out, but I would pick a better nut brown for a regular."
"If you are looking for something complex then this is not your beer. If you're looking for something a little different but not too out there then this is a good choice to mix it up a bit."
"D - This is an awesome nut brown that I wish I could get more of it has a very good taste thats easy to drink definitely worth picking up if you get the chance"
"This one pours a dark amber with a thin white head that leaves minimal lacing on the glass. The aroma is a little sweet with some caramel and a little nuttiness. The taste is just as sweet. There is no hop presence and the nutty flavor just isn't strong enough. The mouthfeel is somewhat creamy but little carbonation. There is little alcohol to this one which makes it easy to drink but not the greatest of the style. There are many other great nut brown ales I would pick up before this one."
"Smell:"
"From a 12 oz. bottle sent to me from a friend in TN. Aroma is sweet malty toast and a little floral hop. Color is a burnt brick red with a tiny off-white head. Flavor is very toasty with some slight chocolate/coffee roastyness and a lemony hop flavor. Finishes dry and clean, does not hang around much. A decent brown."
"Notes from 11/23/06."
"Average beer. Brown ales always seem boring to me so this basically fits the bill. Easy to drink with a suprisingly creamy mouthfeel. A good brown ale."
"The taste is light and simple but very pleasant, with chocolate, nuts, leaves, plus a hint of cola. The flavours are simple and light but good and persistent. The feel is a little flat from low carbonation, but still has some zestiness to it and a hint of oiliness. It has light sweetness and practically no bitterness, but has a finish that is nicely somewhat dry, leafy and nutty. It has enough character and complexity, and these hold up enough, to keep it tasty and interesting as well as very drinkable. It does a good job of having a nutty-chocolate character that is not burnt tasting or totally one-dimensional or bitter. That said, it's still not very unusual, rich,complex, or interesting."
"Not my favorite beer from BBC, but not bad."
"Thanks, kirok1999, for the opportunity"
"Pours a translucent brown in color. Only about a half inch of head forms on the pour, and is quickly gone. Smell is very roasty brown malts and some hops. Taste is more of the heavily roasted malts, but there's a good amount of bitterness coming in at the end. I'm not sure if it's the hops or something else. An alright beer, but there are much better Brown's to drink."
"D_A nice nut brown that actually manages to taste fairly nutty. Very drinkable, I am sure I could knock a few back."
"Overall- Nah, just didn't do it for me. Too sweet and cloying, very little flavor other than some malt and chocolate. Pass on this 1."
"D: Overall, this is a great nut brown. Not my favorite and not as good as some others I've tried, but still good."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer is medium-heavy on the palate and has low levels of carbonation giving it an authentic English style feel. Aftertaste lingers on the palate, I really don't see anything wrong with this brew at all, everything seems to be a positive if you ask me. This is one I'd definitely pick up again, great deal for the price and great beer overall. As I mentioned above, this is one of the best local brews I've had in a while. Overall great beer, if you're in the area pick this up and support the brewery."
"So there's no real head, and the palatal presence leaves a bit to be desired. Still, the aroma and flavor combine to bail out the other shortcomings, so my overall satisfaction is higher than the score might indicate. Indeed, it's those two qualities that end up making this very drinkable and very pleasant to experience. So the stutters don't blur the massage, which means the intent is safe. It's tasty."
"M + D: A little sparkling carbonation livens it up a bit. Medium body, and reasonably smooth going down. Not mind-blowing, but a decent and worthy drink... worth checking out."
"D- this beer has it all except a taste to match all the other goodness. maybe i'm missing something here. beautiful color, nice aroma, and great mouthfeel are nearly worthless to me without flavor."
"Eric"
"D - Better than average drinkability, but not by a lot. Could definitely have two in a night, but wouldn't be having many more."
"BBC's Nut Brown Ale pours a mostly clear, dark amber with a small head hanging out on top. The nose is slightly roasty with hints of caramel and a trace of piny hops in the background. The flavor is sweet up front with almonds and roastiness showing up in the middle. This beer is very sweet for the style, with a bit of bitterness at the end and some nice toasty breadiness showing up a bit after the swallow. The mouthfeel seems a bit thin to me, with a medium amount of carbonation. This is a pretty good brown ale, though sweeter than usual. My lips were a bit sticky aferwards."
"D: A very good brown ale, especially with sweet brown lovers who aren't afraid of a little hops."
"Not my favorite BBC offering although I'm very impressed with that brewery. They make some good stuff..."
"The beer pours a nice brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a sweet, roasted malt scent. It's almost chocolatey in nature. The taste is decent. It has a thin burnt caramel flavor that goes down easy and finishes with a slight nutty feel. The mouthfeel is decent also. It is a medium/full bodied beer with good carbonation. This is an above average nut brown, but nothing special. The aroma is awesome, but the taste didn't live up."
"The smell had a nutty sweetness which really came through in the taste. The sweetness was very evident which made for a very nice finish without any hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was a little thin for my liking, but overall the beer was very smooth and extremely drinkable. It would make a very nice session beer."
"I'd definately have this brew again if it was cheap and on tap. I don't think I would go hunting for it though. I'll have to try it on tap the next time I'm down in Louisville."
"I picked up a single of this from Bigg's in Western Hills, OH. I cannot slam this beer to bad because it is from the bluegrass(my alba mater is NKU, go NORSE!!). This brew seemed watery thin with little mouthfeel. The taste was a bit chocalatey but not very pronounced. The head was impressive and lacing was present in glass. It drinks ok but nothing to write home about. I will give other beers from this little gem in the bluegrass a shot."
"Drinkability - Easy drinking beer, one of the better nut brown ales I have had."
"Very drinkable beer."
"Final Thought: This is a one-of-a-kind brew with all of the flavors just bursting into your mouth, I just wonder if this was experimental for a flavorful and tasty brew or not???"
"Drinkability - Not a bad beer on the overall, but not great and probably not one I'd go out of my way to find. Still a good solid brew if it's available."
"D - Very drinkable, and would probably make for a nice session beer. Not overly flavorful, but still a nice beer."
"A great session beer from BBC that I would put up against a lot of the other english browns on the market today. It's also nice to have a brown ale taste so nutty, without being full of fake extract like so many others (I'm talking to you Rogue....) Very nice overall, and I'll be buying it again."
"Appearance is a dark reddish-brown with little head. The smell is pleasant with toasted malt and an earthy scent. The taste is a mild blend of roasted malt, chocolate and some nuttiness. The aftertaste is rather watery. The mouthfeel is thin and light to medium bodied. Drinkability is good because of the lightness. Overall, a decent beer but lacks character. This is not among my favorite brown ales."
"Drinkability: a slightly above ale here. It's very easy to drink but it is slightly dull beer. Worth a look."
"Beer poured a mahogany brown with no head. Nose is of toasted chocolate malts. Taste is of roasted malts, a hint of chocalte coffee, and a very light hop finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and pretty smooth going down. Overall drinkability is good. This is a nice twist on the Brown style. It is crossing the line towards a stout in some respects. It is definitely worth a shot for brown/stout fans."
"I poured this beer from the bottle to a tumbler at 50 degrees. This beer was a nice mahoganny color but that was all that was nice about it. It had a thin head that was gone in 30 seconds. The smell was sour and the taste was flat. There was no indication this was a nut brown which is my favorite beer type. In fact this tasted like nothing. Maybe it was just a bad example but I will not purchase again."
"Drinkability: There's nothing exciting about this brown ale, but it might be worth a shot, especially to brown ale fans."
"Very easy to drink, and almost seems a bit silky. This was built for quaffing. Nice example of the stlye. Nothing overwhelming, just a nice nutty flavor. Well done."
"It pours out a very dark brown with ruby hints around the edges. Decent off-white head and lacing. Powerful dark chocolate aroma, with hints of roasted coffee and nuts. Quite appealing, really. The flavor is much fainter, and doesn't live up to the hype of the aroma. The not-very-sweet chocolate/coffee notes are there, but overall the flavor is very weak. Slight nut flavor with a thin, barely bitter finish. It's watery in the mouth, especially. The carbonation hardly registers. I'm really disappointed in the end, after such a promising start."
"Drank this from a 12 oz bottle with a March 2009 best-by date. Pours a clean, opaque brown with a thin, white head. No retention. Smells of toasted barley, caramel, nuts. Tastes of the nuts, dark chocolate; nice balance of the dark sweet flavors with a hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is a tad watery for this style, but not too much so. An easily drinkable and enjoyable beer. Fine example of the Nut Brown Ale."
"A perrinial favorite in my region on tap, therefore this is my first bottle review. Certainly as high quality as expected, but lacks the nuances that I find on tap or cask that make it one of my favorite Brown Ales. Still looks a solid brown color with ruby light transmittance. Impressive creamy head retention and lacing. Aromas, even warm, didn't give me the malt / chocolate character that I usually find on tap. Lightly woodsy, nutty, and pungent (peat-ey), but without the firm body to support the flavors as well as I expect. Flavors follow suit with quality malts, chocolates, walnuts, just not as intense as I like. The mouthfeel is a little sticky sweet and less thirst quenching that at the pub. Even with the criticism, it's still a great Brown Ale; but given a preference, I'll try it on cask any day."
"12 ounce bottle says it's best before February 2007. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a small off-white head. It smells like nuts, caramel, a bit of chocolate and malt. Taste is the same as it smells, it starts off a bit sweet and finishes a little on the bitter side. Mouthfeel is on the light side, I was hoping there would be some more substance to it. Drinkability is pretty good though, as it's very smooth and goes down pretty easy. It's not the best brown ale I've had, but with that being said I could still drink quite a few of these at a time. It's a decent sessionable beer, and I'd buy it again."
"D: I find this a very drinkable beer, if I'm in the mood for a sweeter-than-normal brew. It's a unique tasting brown ale and not just a Newcastle imitator."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a mild grainy astringency. Lots of nutty, grainy residue brushing along the palate behind the slightly thin swallow."
"Medium bodied, and very drinkable, this is a great, clean session beer."
"Drinkability - on the short list for sessionables in my book."
"Pours a deep amber color with a one finger thick off white head. Very clear, head fades quickly, no lacing. Nice roasted nut smell, hints of molasses and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the smell, slighly bitter roasted nut taste. This beer also has some sort of chocolate malt/ chocolate lactose taste, kinda sour. It has a tootsie roll like aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for me, decent amount of carbonation. Easy too drink, this is just not my favorite style of brew. Not bad, glad I had the chance to try it."
"All in all it's a drinkable but unchallenging brown ale. It's competently executed with no overpowering notes or underlying sourness but calling this a Nut Brown Ale calls for comparison to other Nut Browns and there's really no comparison."
"Even with the somewhat thin body, this is still a very nice brown ale. I would gladly drink several more."
"The flavor is mild overall and the beer is very easy to drink. This is a tasty beer that could be sessionable as it is not huge and is not overly sweet. Worth trying!"
"Chestnut brown with tinged ruby highlight. Hint of cocoa powder in the aroma. Moderate roasted malt flavor, with a distinctive chocolate malt note in the middle. Low hops bittering, which is appropriate for the style. Seemed a little on the thin side, which was the primary detraction. Not quite enough to hold my interest for a session beer, but a pleasant beer, nonetheless."
"A redish/ brown color, with a slight head. The scent of carmel sweetness and some nuttiness comes through. The taste is the same as the scent, sweetness and nutty flavor, with a hoppy finsh at the end. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, very smooth going down. I would like to have less hoppiness at the and more of the nutty flavor. Still, this is a very good beer, and very drinkable. I think I will go have another one right now."
"This one pours a light brown color with a small head that has ok retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma is very nutty with caramel notes and faint hints of fruit. Smells pretty good. The flavor is much the same. The taste is mostly caramel flavors with some nutty notes, some chocolate, and it has a slightly bitter finish from the hops. I would prefer a little more body and a stronger caramel flavor. Overall, this is a really nice beer and very drinkable. I'll probably buy this one again."
"12 oz bottle pours a sparkling, clear ruby mahogany body with a small beige head which falls into a lasting collar with some minimal patch lacing. Aroma is mostly toasty and nutty malts, accented by some golden apple and ripe pear fruitiness. Mouthfeel is on the light side, with medium carbonation. Taste has a touch of smooth chocolate, toasted malt, a hint of ripe pears, and a vague nutty character that seems hazelnut. Hops are restrained, but add a delicate bitterness that provides a nice balance. Light bodied and tasty enough to be very sessionable, but lacks the depth and complexity of the tap version I sampled a few months ago at the brewpub. Still, a pretty good Kentucky brewed brown ale."
"Pours a deep deep mahogony color with a finger of light tan head that falls to a modest coat over top. Nose is awesome in my book. Big toasted nuttyness with chocolate and a hint of deeper roast. Very well balanced and very enticing. Flavor is very good as well. Dominated with the toasty nut character with light chocolate hanging behind it. Flavor is not as full as I expected. Feel is a light moderate with a light moderate carbonation. Could use a touch more body. Definately a drinkable beer here. Very good example of the style IMO. Balance is great. Very glad to see this one in bottles. I'll be having this one again."
"The best beer of the day here and should have stuck with htis vs. trying their Alt."
"Tried a glass of this at the BBC in the Cincinnati airport. This was a lot better than the last time I tried it. This was their current seasonal selection. Clear dark brown with a medium thick beige head. Thin lacing. The aroma is very nutty, along with a touch of malt. Nicely smooth with a roasty and nutty character. Malt and hops are also present in the flavor. The finish is crisp and nutty. Overall my experience with the beer this time around was much more favorable."
