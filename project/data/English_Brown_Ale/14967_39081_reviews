"Light chocolate, caramel, toast and a hint of plum on the nose. Pours brilliant brown under a 1” off-white foam cap with a slight brown tint. The palate follows the nose with traces of nuts and chocolate over lightly toasted grain and bright fruit. A semi-sweet beginning leads to a drying finish. Very creamy with slightly above average carbonation and a medium body."
""
"Overall (4.13) : Thought this one was gonna be a tanker for sure. Guess I was pleasantly surprised. The appearance is obviously the weakest link in this chain, but the other categories more than make up for that. It's a great beer, worthy of a sixer, too."
"Ring Neck Braun Ale pours a brownish color, with a large lacing head.  There is a bold aroma aroma, with big notes of nuts.  Creamy flavor, nice malty backbone, big nut flavors, and subtle hints of chocolate and raspberry.  Good full flavors, good body.  Overall a very nice creamy and flavored brown ale."

"Overall: I am often dissapointed with brown ales because they will deliver a simple maple sweetness without depth or complexity. This brown ale, however, has scrumptuous depth to its sweet complex flavor. I would definitely have more of this. In fact I think I'll have more now!"
""
"This is a good brown ale, but there is nothing about it that screams at you for attention. Brown ales are far from my favorite style, but I try and review to the style, so keep that in mind. Easy to drink and inoffensive, worthy of consideration, but their are better browns avaiable."

"Would definitely try it again, and maybe get a session in with it to really test drive it if I would get the opportunity."

"(O)- A bit sweet, particularly for the english variety"
""
"This is a brown that has been very well done. Living in Wisconsin makes it hard to find, thankfully Minnesota is just an hour away. Worth the drive to pick up a few cases of this beer. Caramel and chocolate with a nice malt flavor that has me wanting more and more. It feels a little grainy in the mouth, but has a great finish, not to bitter."

"Overall, a beer I am surprisingly digging. Brown Ales aren't the most sexy beer of all times, but this one comes across with a fantastic mix of sweet, malt, bread and grain to make an exceptional beer."
"Overall: This one was a bit too bitter for me. Smells quite nice, but I don't think I'd look this way again if I want a brown."
"O - For a random single, this provided loads of flavour and was definitely fitting of the style. A true sessionable brown ale that packs a little extra ABV that goes completely undetected. Well worth a try, a tasty ale indeed."
"I was surprised at how dark this poured out of the bottle. Head was minimal. Initial nose was malty, indicating that this wouldn't be some Newcastle knockoff. Indeed, this thing is full of delicious malt! It's well balanced with its hops and very drinkable. Th final.is just like the start - malty. All in all, a surprisingly good beer. Will bring a couple more six packs home when I'm in MN."

"O: I might have a new favorite beer. Very approachable dark beer. Something you could have at the end of dinner for dessert or in the afternoon sitting in the sun."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours with instant head that takes forever to settle. Hazy reddish brown color with a very dense 2 finger off white head with insane retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice thick soapy lacing on the glass, with a ton of carbonation streaming up. This is probably infected. Aromas of huge apple skins, caramel, molasses, toasted malt, bread, light chocolate, and light herbal hops. Way over the top apple notes makes finding anything else difficult. Taste of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, brown sugar, light herbal hops, and light fruitiness. No bitterness on the finish with lingering notes of chocolate, biscuit, caramel, toast, nuttiness, and light herbal on the finish for a good bit. Good balance of malty flavors with no cloying sweetness. Low noticeable infection traits in the flavor. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming after the finish noticed. Overall, despite the obvious infection, this was still a pretty tasty brown ale. Good balance of some pretty robust flavors, and quite easy to drink. I am sure this is a great beer without bugs in it."
"Unique, well crafted example of the style."
""
"Overall, I liked the nose the best, but the taste and mouthfeel dropped off a bit. Very average."

"O: Happy with this one! Great blend and nice new flavors, a good pour from Brau Bros."

"Pours a dull brown with no head whatsoever. Some dots of lace strewn about. The aroma is mainly of toasted oak, biscuit malt and nuts. This is a malt bomb with subtle earthy notes from the fuggles. On the palate, the same notes come through only with some cocoa powder and berries. The feel is thin, light body, with mild carbonation. Smooth and slightly creamy. This is a tame take on the style, but good nonetheless. Nuts and toasted oak linger with a mild berry sweetness. This is definitely one I wouldn't turn away if given the opportunity, but not one I would seek out again."
"O - This is a nice English Brown Ale. A solid brew from Brau Brothers."
""

"Dr: Very drinkable and pleasant. Almost refreshing. I wouldn't mind trying this on nitro if it's available. The cream in particular is lovely. Hides its ABV well. Give her a spin, especially if you're fond of brown ales."
"The beer pours a dark chestnut brown with a few centimeters of small-buble, creamy, sticky foam. The aroma has a distinct earthy and nutty characteristic with some bitter chocolate lingering in the background. This theme continues to play out on the palate. The medium to full body of the beer has a creamy texture, but retains a bite through a pleasing level of carbonation. The faint kick of hops at the end is a welcome counter point to the roasted malt. I really enjoyed it."

"O - Wow, what a pleasant brown ale. Very full tasting, a great fall beer with lots of flavor."
"O- A well-made, tasty brown ale. So far it's my recommendation from Brau Brothers."
"Overall - An enjoyable English Brown Ale. I'd buy it if it was available locally."
"The taste starts with sweet malts, caramel and toffee, with quite a bit of nuts, just a hint of vanilla, a bit of dark fruit as well. Mouth is fairly thin."
"12 oz bottle: Aroma is malty, caramel, slight chocolate cake notes, slightly roasted, not much hops here but very fiantly detectable with light grassy notes. Appearance is a muddy brown with a medium to low tan head that diminishes into a soapy film. Taste is sweet malts with a slight graininess, lightly bitter, and more of the chocolate and caramel note coming out in the backing. Palate is medium bodies, creamy and slightly thick, nice carbonation with a nice bitter finish. Overall, Nice offering as a brown ale. I would drink this agian. Cheers!"
"Overall: I am very partial to brown ales, but this one wasn’t nearly what I was hoping for or expecting. There is certainly a nice brown ale base, but it just kind of goes downhill from there. I am willing to give this one another go sometime down the road because I usually enjoy Brau Brothers offerings, but for now, I’ll have to call it a disappointment."
"Overall, a well made beer, if not my favorite style."
"D- A bit on the sweet side and the flavors tend to build a bit on the palate, but it is unique and tasty."
"Drinkability: Malty, flavorful, sweet and smooth. A good malty brown ale to session with. The dark fruit flavors are nice as well. This is a good one from Brau Brothers Brewing."
"My pour resulted in a finger of dense, medium-tan head with reasonable retention on a humid evening. Color was a deep garnet/ruby-red with NE-quality clarity. I am in love! Nose was VERY malty, more truth in advertising. The biscuit malt was definitely in the forefront, but with pecan undertones. I thought of Lazy Magnolia's Pecan Beer for a moment. Mouthfeel was medium, approaching creaminess, with the chocolate/raspberry flavors the immediate senses on the tongue, followed by a nuttiness that I had not achieved earlier. Wow! Not to be sexist, but this might have been the night to have CAPT Midnite (a counterperson at my local mini-mart who often gets to close at 0000) over for a drink. Man, but this was super sweet and certainly a dessert beer. Chicks seem to dig this sort of thing. Finish had a melange of nuttiness and raspberry, but the chocolate seemed to fade initially before making a reappearance on the extreme finish. Hoo! I may need some insulin after all of this sugar. It was wild and a perfect accompaniment to my earlier experiment, but I would not want a steady diet thereof."
"M - Nice carbonation. Very drinkable. Despite the fruit sweetness, it's not cloying. Very refreshing on an unseasonably warm day in early April (compliments watching the final round of the masters quite well)."
"Taste is pretty simplistic in its maltiness, but what is there is extremely deliciouss. Cocoa Kripies keep coming to mind as it is very smooth and chocolaty. I could easily sit down and drink 2 or 3 pints of this in a row, no problem. My first Brau Brothers beer has impressed, I look forward to trying some more!"
"Overall, a quality example of a brown ale with great nutty smell/taste and a balanced load of chocolate supporting flavors. Will definitely drink again. Well-hidden ABV at 6.80% as alcohol does not come through on taste."
"Finish: Grass notes hover with a very small about of hops in the background"
"D: Well done brown ale and well hidden ABV"
"The aroma invites, with a variety of flavors on the nose, from fruit-like (cherry?) to more bourbon-y and rich like caramel or coffee. The taste feels like there is more going on than most Browns - almost like a Triple."
"D: Awesome. Could session in nearly any circumstance."
"A good beer."
"A little thin but a good quaff. Malt comes through nicely as it warms."
"SkÅL!"
"O: Brau Bros. consistently puts out quality product, but rarely transcendent. This one fits the mold."
"Malty and sweet, but the earthy and woody qualities bring some balance. Not bad."
"Easy to drink solid English Brown."
"D: Yeah, it was not the greatest beer, but I found it hard to criticize. I don't think it was overly drinkable."
"D- I like this. Pretty solid brown ale, so far best beer from the sampler."
"D - this beverage is one of my favorites. Normally the browns are fall beverages, but this one is good anytime of the year."
"By far Brau Brothers finest offering. An American Brown ale(English?, not bloody likely) that is quite possibly one of the top Browns I've enjoyed, and will continue to enjoy, in quite a long time. Right up there with New Glarus Fat Squirrel, Surly Bender, and Rogue Hazelnut."
"Overall this is decent, drinkable, but mostly average."
"D: A nice offering from Brau Bros. Alcoholy but pleasant and nice for sipping"
"M/D: Medium to lighter body, lighter carbonation, fairly smooth feel as it rolls around the tongue. Drinkability is not the greatest. I grow tired of this pretty quick. Too much fake chocolaty and fruity flavoring."
"An interesting twist on an English-style Brown. According to label, Fuggles hops used - It is an English-style brown with a tart raspberry undertone and is higher in alcohol (that shows somewhat) than is typical. It's a creative take on a traditional style. Nice!"
"D: Wonderful, tasty and damn drinkable. Did not even know this brewer existed. It's a win for me, and I am usually not a fan of malty brews."
"Probably ties the Whirly Bird as my favorate Brau beer."
"Purchased at Blue Max Liquors in Burnsville, MN. Pours a dark reddish copper body with an off white head that caps the beer. Aroma of milk chocolate, toasted bread and nutty toffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. Flavors of chocolate covered dried cherries first greet you then transition to a smooth and sweet finish. Great drinkability."
"I happened across this at a beer tasting event for 3M. I had never heard of the Brau Bros. and even at the end of the night (12 Breweries, 60 Labels - Many samples), this one stuck out as the clear best while the rest just faded together. I knew that I had to try this one again with a clear head and it turned out even better. For the price and the quality ($7.99 / 6 x 12oz), this is likely to become my fridge beer of choice. Who says you have to go all the way to England for a good nut brown?!"
"Nice solid brown ale. Makes for a nice cool weather beer. If the earthiness was a bit toned down, this would be even better. I will have this again."
"Drinkability: Both full flavored and easy drinking at the same time. Maybe the best English Brown Ale I have had."
"I suppose that I should try this fresh, because it touts autumn hunting season in SW MN. The mouthfeel is firm, a little creamy but slightly harsh with carbonation. As of this bottle, I'm not impressed (yet again) with BBB, but I'm willing to accede that this is close to an interesting take on the English brown style."
"A good offering from Brau Brothers, It's full of flavor and smooth for a 6.8% ABV. A little more body may have been nice, but that's not to take away from a good beer."
"D- This is a nice English Brown Ale. I haven't had an English Brown in awhile and it was nice to revisit the style. This brew is very sweet and has a strong flavor. It would be perfect for making bread with. Wouldn't mind having this again."
"D-A drinkable brew. Enjoyable to enjoy on occassion, as the sweetness of the toffee/caramelly malt can become a bit much."
"D - goes down nice and easy."
"My first sampling of Brau Bros, which I know is a shame as I live in Minneapolis, but wow, there couldn't be a better beer to start with. I AM IMPRESSED. I will be looking for more from the Brau Bro."
"D - Good drinkability, I'd certainly reach for another one if I had it available."
"Ring Neck Braun shows that Brau Brothers can brew good beer if they put their minds to it. Their standard lineup borders on awful at times, but this first offering in the Single Batch Series is something to celebrate. Thanks to feloniousmonk for the bottle."
"Malty brown, pours brown with initial white foamy head. Some bitterness apparent, but well washed over with malt, making it easy drinkable but essentially another malt. Some chocolate malt. nothing really roasty came through, but did come to a fruit finish."
"Pours a cloudy red/orange/brown, nice colour, thick off white head forms, settles to a thick layer, leaves behind some decent lacing. Smell is neat, caramel, spices, bread, nuts, lots of sweet fruit, brown sugar, really neat. Taste is nice, caramel, very nutty, light bit of roast, bread, brown sugar, fruit and nuts in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Very smooth and drinkable, nice flavour, great brown ale. Thanks Scotty!"
"after a few bottles, it seems like this offering is trying to meld american/english brown ale qualities with belgian style wackiness. very confusing, but interesting and unique."
"Drinkability: A pretty average, though drinkable brown ale."
"Clear, dark brown, with a thin finger of light khaki head. Rich, nutty, toasted malt on the nose, with rummy fruit, and hints of chocolate. Toasted grain and nutty malt flavors up front. Caramel and light chocolate mix with hazelnut and dark fruit. Hints of alcohol in a chocolaty, mildly bitter finish. Very nice. Medium-bodied with a smooth, evenly carbonated feel. A nice surprise and glad to find another great MN brew!"
"Pours a dark mahogany with some ruby tones. Quickly disappearing head. Nose- expected brown malt smell along with a raspberry concentrate smell. Taste- biscuity malts and ripe raspberries. Finishes too quick- not much complexity on the back end. Light hopping. Good cabonation. Beer is somewhat sour as you get into it.Decent effort."
"the best brown ale you can get in this state."
"Thanks to Faro for the trade."
"Mouthfeel is a great chewy, creamy and smooth ale, the way a brown ale should be. This is the best offering I have had from Brau Brothers and I would definately have this one again."
"The mouth feel is pleasant and stays on the pallet awhile. All in all a nice drinkable interpretation. This is a very nice fall offering."
"Drinkability is very good on this beer. It is a shame this is party of their single-batch series. I wouldn't mind adding this to my regular line up in the fridge. Grab it if you can!"
"But quite good...As an autumnal seasonal, not bad at all...I can feel the warmth, already."
"One of the better brown ales I've had. Versatile, i.e. with food or stand alone, this one works."
"Served on tap at the Happy Gnome, this pours a clear dark brown color. The smell is sweet and nutty. The taste is sweet and malty with a nutty caramel flavor, with minimal hops. There's nothing overly complicated about this beer-it just tastes good, in the style of an English brown ale. The mouthfeel is smooth and tasty. It's easily drinkable and satisfyling. Recommended!"
"Clear auburn/scarlet red. Thin light brown head. Lacing is more than adequate. Really nice aroma. Kind of dusty, yet quite meaty as well. Thick with malts and nutty goodness. Flavor starts with nice maltiness. Very smooth. Nuttiness is quite prevalent throughout. This flavor has some substance to it. Hops provide balance. Finishes chalky with grain dust coming to mind. The mouthfeel is quite good. Smooth and silky in the mouth. Just enough carbonation. Very good ale. Very good all around."
"Drinkability: This is a very enjoyable beer. I was going to save the remaining two for another night but they are going down the hatch tonight. To me that is drinkability. When you can't wait to drink it again. My overall score may seem high but to me this is a dandy. I wish I could buy more. About the only drawback is the yeasty aroma I noted and which is evident in most of the beers I have tried....in this one it blends with things nicer and does not bother me as much as say in their Pilsner or Pale Ale..."
"This beer pours a clear brown color with ruby hues around the edges. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a nice cap of lacing. The aroma is very strong. Caramel, nuts, toffee, a hint of butter. The taste is as bold as the aroma. Caramel and toffee round dominate the flavor, with a slight yeasty note that seems to be common to Brau Brothers beers. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, with nice carbonation and a velvety texture. Overall, this is one of the better brown ales I have had. I would drink this on a regular basis, and can only hope it is brewed again someday."
"The chocolate malt really comes through with some nuttiness and nice hop bitterness to balance everything out. I would say it is medium bodied but the fizzyness of the carbonation makes it seem lighter. This is a really good beer. Just needs to be more active on pour with better head retention."
"Overall: the only other Brau Bros beer I have tried was their strawberry wheat, and I tell you what, this one was much more impressive. Billed as a double nut brown, I wouldn't call this a big beer, more like a strong brown. I really liked how they brought out the chocolaty and nutty flavors together. I will probably have to grab another 6er or two before this single batch is gone."
"Pours a brilliant mahogany-amber in color, topped with a rocky medium tan head. Nose is fruity, malty, and fairly biscuity. Malt characteristics (esp. chocolate malt) are nicely expressed. There's even some tannins here, and of course a touch of diacetyl that works for the style. As with several of the ales in the Brau lineup, Ring Neck Braun is a touch grainy, chewy, and with an agreeable bready characteristic. Oaty! Oily/unctious in the best way, and fairly fruity, with notes of berry and plum. Although this one is truly malt-focused and rich, it is also fairly amply hopped to balance out its malt sweetness. Quite drinkable and altogether fairly weighty; after a couple of pints I didn't feel like switching to another brew, but almost felt like tackling a hoppier beast, or for that matter some food: this one seems to just beg for a pairing with something in the rich and meaty category. Finish leans toward the dry side, and the malt character really lingers. Ring Neck Braun Ale is described by brewer Dustin Brau as a Double Nut Brown Ale, and in that sense it reminded me a bit of an imperial nut brown ale I enjoyed earlier this year (edit: Tommyknocker), and although it doesn't reach such boozy heights it is still on-style despite its strength. Rather impressive overall, and I look forward to repeat visits."
