3.5,-2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Interesting take on a brown here, more of a caramel toasty base than a nutty chocolate roast one, making it a lighter and more easy drinking, but equally flavorful example of the style. Nice frothing head on it with decent retention, an amber hue, and a nose of sweet medium crystal malt. The yeast is nondescript, unlike other English style browns out there, but u don't miss it as the beer is dry enough for me in the finish and not seemingly missing anything. Medium bodied with average carbonation, this beer isn't going to change the world, but it's a plenty serviceable warm weather brown, and that's all good in my book.","StonedTrippin","Feb 11, 2015"

Poured dark brown with a one finger khaki colored head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, nutty, and cream. The flavor was of roasted malt, dark chocolate, cream, and nutty. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I was really quite pleasantly surprised to find the nice roastiness mixed with the dark chocolate in this one. I really did not expect it to be there. The aroma was pretty much the same story with a nice well balanced profile going on. Definitely worth trying if you get the chance or are lucky enough to receive this one as an extra during a trade.","thagr81us","Apr 12, 2012"

There were no off flavors, but it didn't have enough of those great English Brown Ale flavors. This beer had ok drinkability. it went down pretty smooth and it wasn't filling, but the flavor couldn't hold my attention so one is all I would want. What I liked most about this beer was the aroma and the slight hazelnut aspect to this beer, they were the highlight of this beer. What I liked least about this beer the light body and the lack of head and lacing, they were both out of wack and need some work to make this beer compete with some of the better English Brown Ales. I am glad I tried it, but I don't think I would get this beer, it wasn't a memorable English Brown Ale, and I don't really recommend trying this beer, it isn't hard to find some better English Brown Ale. I wasn't too impressed with this beer, it just felt too watery, and the flavors were a little bland and didn't stick out like they should. I am starting to like this Georgia brewery, but this beer failed to impress me, better luck next time guys, I know you can do better.","StoutHunter","Apr 09, 2012"

Smell is nice roasted malts and some hints of nuts and a touch of carmel to add to the aroma. Taste follows the nose and mixes malts and hops quite well. A fairly complex EBA IMO. Sits well on the tongue with a good bit of carbonation and a medium feel which is nice a creamy. Overall- It's a nice example of the style and has a very balanced taste with some sweet and some bitter. A soild effort by Sweetwater and I would hit another one of these.

Dark brown with a big khaki head. (Did I just write khaki?) Lots of lace and stickiness in my Sierra Nevada Becker. Darker and richer than many big-named porters like Bell's and Sierra Nevada. Delicious, caramel aroma and taste. Not too thin on the palate, again, better than a lot of porters. Not a lot of hops, but after all it is an English brown ale. I really liked it and it was very fresh. Consume by 07/20/11. A great rich, malty brown ale that is better than many porters.

Malts are the most distinct flavors in the beer with a bready quality in particular, some nuttiness and again that horse-saddle mustiness. A farmhouse style flavor palate. Feisty carbonation neutralized some of the flavors. Not as deep as it could be for a brown but above average for an airport beer.","thekevlarkid","Aug 06, 2008"

Not all negative though... not much taste but also not any bad stuff in here... just not enough character. A very clean tasting, highly drinkable Brown Ale that is light, in every way, for the style.

Aroma comprised of soft medium lovibond caramel malt with a subtle, rounded nuttiness. Lightly earthy hop nose with trace of wood. Clean, understated aroma, much like most brown ales. Baked biscuit sweetness initially in flavor is ensued by mellow caramel with tinges of toffee. Sweetness becomes briefly honeyish mid palate, and remains relatively dominant, being only partially offset due to the paltry hop bitterness. Lightly bodied, with a thinnish, well attenuated mouthfeel shy on dextrins. Finishes mostly dry, with quickly fleeting notes of toasted malt sweetness. True to its name, Georgia Brown is sweet, but not cloyingly so. Tame, better than decent and quite drinkable. A stereotypical stepping stone microbrew for those who haven't yet ventured beyond beer darker than piss yellow.","marc77","Apr 06, 2003"
3.92,9.8,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Poured a dark caramel brown with a thin head that left quickly. The nose immediately offered caramel, chocolate, and malt with a slight hint of coffee/espresso. I rated the taste a little lower because the aroma promised so much. While still a great taste of malts and hints of caramel with a smooth finish, it just didn't live up to the smell. Good Brown, but would be great if it tasted as good as it smelled.","Loki","Mar 01, 2003"

3.2,-10.4,3,3,3.5,3,3,"The beer is a cloudless copper color on the pour with a modest head, frothy in texture and the lace adequate to coat the glass. Nose is mostly malt, sweet, fresh and pleasant enough, start is ambrosial, nicely malted and the top middling in feel. Finish is stinging in its acidic bite, the hops moderate in presence and bite, dry lingering aftertaste.","Gusler","Beers"
3.12,-12.6,2.5,3,3,2.5,4,"Malty with some caramelly aspects. Too light in color and too thin in flavor an palate to be a good brown. After drinking Rogue Nutbrown and Boyne River Brown, this can't get much over average for a brown.","aracauna","0"
