3.95,0.5,3,4.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured at a good temperature with a modest, thick, light tan head that soon settled and a tiny bit of lace. Color is a clear cherry brown with lots of bubble trails. Aroma is cocoa, malt, leather, mild tobacco. Flavor's not as good as nose as there are notes of raisins and molasses which I don't find appealing in this kind of beer. Body is hurt by those Flavor's too which clashes and leaves high points. Finish like taste, is longish, and a tad boozy.","drpimento","Dec 10, 2013"
3.28,-16.5,3.25,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.25,"Pours a clear brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toast, and metallic aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour caramel and toast flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer that is drinkable but nothing too memorable in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Dec 10, 2013"

3.78,-3.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 9/22/2012. Pours almost black dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of caramel, molasses, toast, toffee, chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, prune, light nuttiness, and earth; a bit of estery alcohol that reduces a bit as it warms. Pretty nice aromas with good malt complexity and balance. Taste of caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, nuttiness, roasted malt, dark bread, molasses, light dark fruit, and light earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, molasses, nuttiness, dark bread, light dark fruitiness, and light earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and robustness of malt flavors; some slight estery off flavors, but not too bad; with zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good imperial brown ale. Huge robustness of flavor with good balance; and quite smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 20, 2013"

This also very drinkable and it would be very easy to drink 4-5 in one sitting.

This reminds me of a dryer/ less sweet version of Young's Double Chocolate Stout without the massive chocolate, by that I mean there is a lot of richness that I don't associate with an english brown or porter, but the flavors match pretty well with a brown. I would not mind a sixer of this on occasion, but a 750ml is too pricy/hard to drink. Highly recommended, definitely worth trying.","wspscott","Aug 30, 2011"

Brown Sugar, caramel, hints of chocolate, dark fruits all play a role in the nose here. Taste is fruity, sugary, earthy, caramely, mineraly. Taste starts off with a bit of brown sugar, milk chocolate and sweet dark fruits, then a bit of ethanol hits, quickly more of the fruit comes back in, then an earthy flavor mixes with a bit of caramel that lingers long after every sip. Medium to thick body, light carbonation with a creamy smooth mouthfeel. Great big brown ale, I loved it!","johnnnniee","Aug 30, 2011"

Nose is brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger and an assortment of other spices. Some large caramel notes as well. Taste takes on more roast and nut character, caramel and sugary notes with some dark fruits, which take a back seat to the sugar and spice going on in the forefront. Some bitter chocolate notes as well, more spicing finishes off on the palate. Mouthfeel is moderately thick, roast and spices linger on the tongue. Quite nice, although it feel like it lacks something to take it to the next level. Overly spiced perhaps? Maybe. A pleasant and interesting 'double' brown ale nonetheless.","liamt07","Aug 21, 2011"

It tastes of sweet chocolate, light roast, and has a nice nutty finish that isn't too much and finishes quite sweet. Like their other beers that come in 750s that I've had so far, it drinks very, very smoothly. Overall I do enjoy this beer but after awhile, it does get to be a little sweet.

Each sip now seem to get a bit more complex then the one before it, really very well done here. Rich chocolate notes blending well now with huge malts and a touch of rye that are just fantastic.

There was a big fruity, wine-like character with a little roast and chocolate. But it was disappointingly simple. The body was heavy and smooth for the most part, with just balancing bitterness. For the weight of this brown ale, I'd expect more varied notes. Maybe it just needs time is a cellar, or has had too much. Either way I like this brewery enough to give this another shot eventually.

4.12,4.8,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Thanks to Grant for bringing a growler of this to one of our gatherings. Pours dark brown with only a slight head. Smells of tobacco, cocoa, cherry, hoppy citrus. There are notes of leather and tobacco on the finish, as well as a light roastiness. I love the fact that these guys have a house style and that it comes through so often in their beers, yet everything is still so fresh and interesting. The taste is a nice combo of cherry, tobacco and vanilla, progressing to notes of cocoa, roastiness, and wet earth. A tad sweet in the mouth, but the earthy notes help balance things. Another nice beer from this quite interesting brewery.","Georgiabeer","Beers"
4.23,7.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"F: Finishes pretty dry despite the initial sweetness, but leaves some hints of brown sugar and molasses, as well as syrupy slight stickiness. Then more porter like dark roast, coffee, with a little chewy malt lingering, more creamy oatmeal, and very porter like tasty finish. The wild contamination is practically gone at this point, it started out on the finish but quickly fades, except for the spicy dry finish that most likely came from the wild yeast. A slight bitterness comes through as well. Despite the wild yeast contamination, it's delicious. I can see what it was supposed to be, and what it is now, and both are delicious either way. I actually love it the way it is and if they said they did it on purpose I would believe them.","jlindros","0"
4.2,6.9,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a nice, rich muddy brown color with decent cap of khaki head. Scent is of chocolate, carmel, toffee, roasted nuts, fresh bread.

A very good brown ale.","rfgetz","May 05, 2010"

Too damn strong for what I'd call an English Style Brown Ale, something I should be able to drink in fairly large quantities and not find myself feeling buzzed. Yeah, I've had strong ESBAs before and thought the same thing about them but this particular beer, combined with the strange tartness, brings the drinkability down big time.

Beefy malt upfront with quite a pronounced nuttiness and woody flavor. Lingering cocoa notes. Again has a lactic twang going on. Grainy tasting. Decent enough body. Overall an ok beer.

It has a rich , roasted and crystal malt scent along with a light English yeast fruitiness. The taste is good as well. It has a very rich crystal malt flavor along with some mild hops and a bit of esters in the finish. The alcohol is well integrated and provides a bit of heat in the finish as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an interesting beer. I can't say that I've had too many Imperial brown ales. That said, I feel this would be a fine example of the style.","WesWes","Dec 13, 2009"
3.7,-5.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Reviewed on 09/06/2009. Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a small tan head. Aroma of roasted nuts, light roasted malt, caramel malt, and light fruits (apple, fig). Flavor has a nice smokey/oaky edge with roasted nuts, roasted malt, smoked apple, and maybe a touch of coffee. I like the smoked aspect of this beer, very tasty! Robust palate and creamy too (however it gets slightly wearing and a little acidic as you go through the beer). Overall, a brown ale I actually enjoyed.","LilBeerDoctor","Nov 25, 2009"

3.68,-6.4,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I genuinely enjoyed the nose, I really did. The palate, OTOH, is a bit of an infected mess right now, with some of the rich chocolate, toffee and nutty sweetness clashing rather poorly with the mild funk that's grassy with wet hay. Despite all the negativity here, I'm really digging the malt complexity in this beer, and would love to try an uninfected version of this beer. Drying on the finish with some nougat and chocolate, this is solid. Carbonation is a little high for such a big brown ale, but that's probably due to the infection. The body is on the fuller side of medium and compliments the flavors quite well. Sourness is low, it's more funk than sour. Not the most drinkable of beers, but I drank about half the bottle, which isn't bad.","DefenCorps","Beers"

Has to be one of the tastiest brown ales that I have had. Nice moderate body with semi-soft carbonation give the brew a silky feel, sweet yet with a bitter edge, perhaps a touch sticky in the end.

3.96,0.8,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"750ml bottle shared by mfielden recently. Thanks, Mark. Dark hazy brown appearance with two fingers of tan head that retains well. An attractive brown ale. Nutty, malty, toasty aroma; nice but honestly a bit muted for a 9% beast of a brown ale. The taste is inexplicably mellow - if I didn't know any better, I would guess that this was a standard 5% brown ale. Whether that's a good or bad thing I'm not sure, but I'm impressed with how deceptive it is. How does it actually taste, then? Nice but very basic. Toasted grain and nuts, light roastiness and a touch of chocolate in the finish. Smooth from the oats but perhaps a touch overcarbonated for the style. The finish is dry and yeasty with a mild lingering roastiness. Pretty good stuff, one of the better Cigar City beers I've tried so far.","largadeer","Sep 05, 2009"

The big bodied ale appeared to be very dense in the glassware and the first taste further explained the commotion around its arrival in my area. It had a very enjoyable taste that one could pick out a variety of stronger ale notes, such as elements of coffee, smoke, bourbon, and caramel. The dry chalky aftertaste also reminded me of cocoa bars and I thought a little Partagas cigar might go well with this ale.","bonbright7","Aug 28, 2009"

Aroma is a deliciously sweet maltiness, strong molasses, sugary caramel, toffee, and some cola as well. A bit of woodiness and dark ripe fruit too. Taste follows and lives up to the aroma, big malty beer, sweet caramel and sugary toffee mixes with some nutty and earthy qualities, molasses in the finish. Big and creamy, medium to heavy mouthfeel, a bit of hoppiness balances with a slight peppery feel on the tongue and a very nice dryness in the finish. Very good brown, the alcohol is well balanced and it drinks way too easy for a 9% beer, delicious and sweet, hope this one gets bottled some day, one of the few browns that I would definitely keep in the cellar.
