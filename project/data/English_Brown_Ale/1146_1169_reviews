"Rich brown in color, thin but lasting head. Carbonation is noticeable and refreshing. This is a solid brown ale. Try it instead of a Newcastle, you might be surprised."

"O: A nice nut brown with a few good layers that give it just the right amount of sweetness while remaining very drinkable. The nuttiness is present throughout and helps to moderate the sweetness. Solid part of the flight pack"

"Bought from Table & Vine in West Springfield, MA. From the Goose Island Flight Pack. Served in a glass goblet. The beer poured with a dark brown appearance, a light-colored brown head, and with minimal lacing. A good breath of air gives you the smell of malts mixed with caramel with an almost herb-like hint near the end. The drink had a toasted nuts, coffee, and cocoa taste with a bitter flavor at the end of each sip. The beer was slightly creamy with a medium carbonation making it surprisingly refreshing. Overall, not too bad."

"12 oz bottle.  Pours dark brown with small, creamy, beige head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of toasted, nutty malt, chocolate, cacao and some piney hops.  Body is medium and slightly crisp.  Taste is similar to aroma.  Finish is long and semi-dry. Good session ale."

"What that other NBA should taste like"
"Pours dark coffee color with a thin beige head, smells of nut  pine and roasted malts, tastes of caramel pine and roasted malts with a smooth mouthfeel."

"Dark brown hued,but definitely karts a fair share of light through. A half inch thick light khaki colored head is on top. Brussels lacing. Aroma of caramel and bready dark malt greets the nose. The flavor is filled with caramel,dark malt and a touch of honey. The finish is malty with just a sensation of bitterness from the hops.The mouth is moderately carbonated and creamy."

"O - This is a good beer. Bolder flavor than many browns. ABV isn't bad for such flavor. Will have this again."
""
""
""
"Overall solid flavor, presentation and aroma, poor mouthfeel and presence that detracts from this otherwise quality ale."
""
""
"Overall a very nice warm weather session ale. Maybe not the most exciting beer a Goose Island makes but a solid year-round offering."
"Pours a very dark brown in color with a smaller beige head. Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is of roasted malts, caramel with a hint of nut. The taste is the same but has a bitter finish. A bit much for my liking. Average to lower carbonation. Overall, wasn't real pleased with this one."

"Smooth and light, very different from the color. You wouldn't expect cleansing ale properties from this brew but that's exactly what you get. The undertones are nutty so it's not too overbearing. It's enjoyable and sessionable, you can have more than a few. There isn't too much of any one characterstic in this brew."
"Overall I love this beer. It reminds me of dessert"

"Nut brown pours a brownish color, with a very small lacing head. There is a light nutty aroma, but lots of yeast aromas. The taste has strong yeast flavors, with light hints of nuts, there is a rather stale taste. Watery, stale, weak flavors. Overall a disappointment."

"I like this brew because it is light enough to have a few and neutral & interesting enough to have with wings, burgers and other pub type fare. It paired well with spicy-bbq wings I made later for it."

"As it is, it's alright. Something simple and non-obstructing to go with pub sandwich and fries."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 4/12/2012. Pours slightly hazy reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, toast, toffee, nuttiness, dark bread, brown sugar, floral, and slight dark fruitiness. Excellent aromas with great complexity and balance of dark malt notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, chocolate, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, toast, brown sugar, floral, and slight dark fruits. Lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, toffee, brown bread, nuttiness, brown sugar, toast, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice balance and robustness of dark malt flavors; with good complexity and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent brown ale! Great balance and robustness of dark malt flavors; with a great mouthfeel and smooth drinking. A highly enjoyable offering; one of the best brown ales I have had."
"O- I think this is a fantastic, easily drinkable brown ale. I love the nuttyness. This is my go-to for easy drinking time when I don't want anything heavy."
""
""
"Pours brown with a ruby hue on the edges. There is a half finger of head that dissipates rather quickly. The nose is mildly nutty. The upfront flavor profile is dark bread with a very light touch of malty sweetness. There is a tingly, yet soft dry bitterness on the finish."
""
"O: clearly above average for style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes; Goose Island shows once again that they can give quality English Beers a run for the money. This is a world class beer in my opinion and is stellar in every way. Will become a Winter staple for sure."
""
"A decent brown ale, but lacking in the complexity and body to make it a more American Brown. Seems to be much more in line with a classic English Brown. Glad to have tried it, but not gonna get it again."

"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this si a decent brown ale to drink for a while."
"O - Balance is on the sweet side, but not remarkably so. A good beer."
""
""
""
"From bottle to a pint glass, nice dark brown with a creamy tan head. The smell held roasted notes and Carmel hints with brown sugar depth. The taste followed suit with a solid rich roasted malty flavor, sweetness a contrasting bitter at the end. Mouthfeel is right on target as its thick enough to be hearty but is so easy to drink it could be a everyday beer, I truly enjoyed this beer....and will again soon."
""
""
""
""
"Pretty good; it goes down easily enough. Plenty of dark malt notes along with some chocolate and a residual sweetness. The aroma is satisfyingly complex, while the flavour seems a little muted by comparison. The body is slightly thin, and where has the carbonation disappeared to? Overall, a decent malty brew that suits the colder months of the year. Worth sampling if you come across it."

"I really enjoyed this beer and I'd be down for another basically any time."
"Had a bottle of this and poored into a pint glass. Smell is very nutty and chocolate like. Taste is exactly the same as the smell. This is by far my new favorite Brown Ale. The first time I tryed this was at a bar and my friend bought me one of these bad boys...and wow! I was amazed how great of a beer it was. Big props to Goose Island on this one. VERY worth a try!"

"well what i say very surprise by the beer what a great color in my glass and the best tasteing brown i ever taste woth chocolate and honey how can you go wrong, well you this beer will put a smile on your face doesnt leave an aftertaste in your mouth and it has a great pour your mouth will start watering when you see it so sit back drink a few oh so good"
""
"This is how I want my Brown's to taste. Sweet and flavorful while still remaining very easy drinking."
""
"O - Why don't I see this as much in NY? Maybe the In-Bev deal will change that, because this matches up well with any fall seasonal out there. I'll have another."

"Overall this is one of the better American Brown ales considering how low the ABV is. Most sessionable Brown ales are super watery and flavorless, but this is quite enjoyable and something I would definitely revisit down the road."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer poured out as a nice deep brown color, a light tan colored head on top with a good retention and lacing on the glass. The aroma of the beer had a big malt nose with a healthy amount of roasted nuts also. There is a decent amount of yeast aromas too. The taste of the beer is nicely roasted, it's sweet too up front and finishes with a good bitterness. The mouthfeel of this beer is creamy and smooth, subtle carbonation and very drinkable. Overall this beer is quite good in my opinion. I would enjoy this one over and over again I think."
""
""
"Overall: My favorite brown ale. Easily."
""
""
""
"O: A decent and easily drunk brown. Not a robust brown, but still interesting enough."
""
"I really bought this for cooking, but I drank what wasn't used in the recipe, so. Dark mahogany color, nearly opaque in the dim light, but still clear, with a lasting fizzy tannish head. Toasted grains on the nose, and not much else. Taste of toasted grains, light caramel, cocoa powder, earth, leading to an uncomfortable metallic twinge that turned to chalk in my mouth. Not bad at first, but just really turned bland and almost sour quickly. It's no secret that I'm not a fan of brown ales, and this one wasn't among the better I've had. Decent and drinkable...for the style in general. At least it went to good use in my marinade."
"O: A nice mild brown ale. Cocoa is a nice touch. It's pretty mild but nicely balanced with a great smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability is high."
""
""
""
"Not a bad offering from GI. Try it."
"As I said, and as many others have said, the Goose Island Nut Brown Ale is a very good representative of the English brown ale style, which, granted, may be in rather low demand as Americans tend to favor the hoppier styles. The nuttiness is there, but it’s not the mark of the beer. More of a stylish accessory, if you will."
""
""
"O - I'm a big fan of Goose Island and always have been. This is a classic for me as I've had many of these in the past. Glad to get around to a well deserved review. The beer is a very good but brown, but what keeps it from being great is its thickness. It is smooth enough, but when I think nut brown ale, I want that stick to your mouth thickness and this is a little thin in that regard. However the flavor, aromas, and color of this ale are dead on and it's a very very good brew without question. A brew every brown ale fanatic should have. Goose island have a little underrated gem here. It's worth the buy."

"Finger plus head of airy, evenly surfaced foam which dissipates very quickly, like nothing left at all, the lacing is wispy at best and likewise there and gone. Clear brown colored liquid, soft orange tint and then yellow further towards the rims, good amount of active tiny bubbles which are widely dispersed. Extremely sweet nose of caramel, chocolate, toffee and creamed coffee, notes of candied nuts, there are some cereal grains and scone in there but nothing offered which could stiffen the feel and counterbalance the sugary aspects. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is finely grained so to speak but does stir things about the mouth. Here you get more bread, yeast, nuts and anise to temper the excesses of the chocolate, caramel, coffee. Hint of orange peel, does not produce any metallic nor roasted notes nor anything remotely herbaceous. While the mouthfeel is soft there is a general cleanliness to it, minimal residue at the end. In many regards simple, but better put as pure of purpose. Nothing more needs be said."
"O: Good beer, nice example of the style. Worth a try."
""

"[O] Goose Island Nut Brown Ale is a great representation of the style - and it is highly drinkable. I bought a case immediately after my first draft experience (shortly after GI came to PA). As a plus, those who are quick to dismiss dark beers will even find this one to be very approachable."
""
"O - nice beer. Subtle yet complex and most improtantly flavorful. Good showing."
""
""
""
"O- This is a good brown ale. Not getting as much nuttiness as other nut browns, but a good brown ale nonetheless."
""
"Another fine beer by Goose Island."
"Thanks to TheBishopco for this one!"
""
"O - A really nice brown ale, which I'm a huge fan of. This is my go-to brown here in Chicago, and I'm so happy it's around to grab whenever I'm in the mood."
""
""
"Pours dark brown with off-white head that's fades. Faint scent of nuttiness, caramel, and honey. Tastes of caramel, hazlenut, honey and slight cinnamon with a clean bitterness. Some malt sweet ess stays on the tongue. Medium bodied with light carbonation. Good brown ale."
"I was hoping to say more, but there really isn't much else to say. Passable, but nothing memorable or desirable for this style. Too bad things seemed to start off quite well."
""
""
""
""
"This nut brown ale from goose sports a nutty brownish color that has light shades of black from afar. A nice inch of loosely coiled tan foam goes up and than down leaving small spots. Smell has a weird hay scent to it on first sniffs, but more investigation I pick out light melted chocolate, nutty appeal, some caramel scent with some earthy hops. Light yet to the point. Taste is well balanced with the malt mixing in with light nuts minus the salt. Some cocco powder taste along with light tootsie roll and faint roast. Nicely rounded again. Feel is very smooth with low carb and no bitterness, body is less than medium and easy sipper. All in all, it's a simple style without nuts and bolts, and this is a good representation of it. Good spring time weather beer."
"I find the Goose Island's Nut Brown to be a well-rounded brown ale. It's a fine example of a brown ale in all facets. It looks robust in a glass and boasts the bread-y scent of a good English beer. Imagine the taste of a light molasses mixed with a bit milk chocolate and roasted grain, and you've got a good idea of what this Nut Brown Ale is all about. I wouldn't describe the mouthfeel as being particularly watery, but it's far from being creamy either. There exists a good balance here. It's a good beer. It's a brown ale that will not disappoint. Now I just have to find myself a plate of bangers and mash."
""
""
"O - A decent, drinkable english/american brown ale hybrid."
"O-Except for the mouthfeel a decent brown ale, however the beer is too on the watery side."
"O - A solid brown, recommended. First try from this brewery, hope they make it down to nc someday."
""
""
""
""
""
"This might be one of the best brown ales I had served on tap and for $2.50 worth the price of the pour. Will seek out other Goose Island offerings."
"O-pretty good brown that I wouldnt turn down anytime"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is only OK, IMHO. At least it is fairly light and goes down easy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final note: I recall the draft version being *significantly* better than its bottled counterpart, so please don't pass judgment on this beer until you've had it on tap. :)"
""
""
"Very good way to make an impression. We just barely got Goose Island in VT."
"O: This beer is average but it is redeemable in the fact that it would make a perfect session ale due to the mouthfeel and alcohole percentage."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall this is a beer that really shines in Goose's style. Great english inspired bitters and brown ales. This is a beer that is tasty and highly drinkable, and fresh. But what disappoints is the lack of a rich mouthfeel. More Leinenkugal thanThree Floyd's, for sure!"

"This beer pours a nice deep brown color that has some ruby hues when held to the light. A pretty vigorous pours yields just over a finger of light tan head resting on top. The head has fairly short retention, and leaves some scattered lace behind on the glass. The nose has a nice bit of toasted malt sweetness and some nuttiness, most notably hazelnut. There are also some aromas of caramel, toffee, and there is just a little bit of hop presence poking through. The taste starts off with a nice toasted malt and hazelnut flavor. There are some caramel and toffee flavors present as well. Also, there is a little bit of hop flavor coming through, not much, but it's there. The finish leaves some lingering nutty flavors on the palate. This has medium body, that is a little on the light side, and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a really creamy feel to it. There is some sweetness here, not much else. This has good drinkability. It is really easy to drink, and has a low ABV and creamy feel. Overall, I think this is a pretty good beer, and a nice representation of the style. Personally, I like a little more hop presence in my brown ales. I think this beer is worth checking out if you come across it."

"Overall: This is an awesome beer and I'm bummed that it is no longer bottled. This, along with the oatmeal stout is incentive enough for me to get to the brewery. Really one of the better nut brown ales; buy it up if you see it, despite its age."
"Overall I thought this one was outstanding, and one of the best session ales I have had in a long time. I would love to see brewers turn more to doing things like this as it really shows off what can be done without going to the extreme."
"This is, for the price, one of the best brown ales that I know of. It has a satisfying taste and heaviness, and is highly sessionable. The creaminess of the beer is desirable, once the carbonation fades (and that doesn't take so long). It's a shame that it's no longer being brewed."
"Drinkability: It's relatively smooth and somewhat creamy, but the flavor just does not pop. It's a smooth session beer, but there are better browns out there."
"Flavor brings some nutty characteristics along with some caramel and toffee. A light earthiness is present as well. Good body with nice carbonation. This is quite nice and it's too bad that GI won't be bottling this any longer."
"Drink I could have a few 2 or 3 but wouldn't want much more than that at a sitting."
"M/D: Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Low ABV, balanced, full flavored yet excellent drinkability. One of my favorite styles well crafted by Goose Island."
"Overall it is a decent beer, get it while it lasts in bottles."
"D: The beer goes down smooth but I think the flavor is a bit to odd to drink all time. I will be cutting myself off after one or two."
"3.5 D: Even though the mouthfeel sucks, this isn't that bad of a drinker. Decent taste. If they mashed higher, this would have some good potential."
"D-Good drinkability with this beer."
"Pours with a three finger dark cream head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Opaque brown color. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Roasted chocolate nose. Flavor is roasted chocolate with a bakers chocolate finish. $1.95 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"I prefer Smuttynose's Old Brown Dog as a English Brown Ale over this one but I hadn't had this before and was pleasantly surprised. I'd certainly suggest trying it."
"Nut Brown Ale has held up well after several months. Quite enjoyable, it's a solid representation of the style."
"A descent brown ale. Nothing too special but a nice brew to start the night off with."
"This beer is brown. It smells dry and nutty with some acidity/alcohol. There is little to no head or lacing. This beer tastes good. It tastes like nuts, dark malt, and some dry alcohol (think sam smith's nut brown but less expensive to buy, or think newcastle with added nut flavor and an actual taste). This beer is full for a brown (ie no wateriness that is usually an unfortunate staple of the style) yet still simple and drinkable. Crisp and bubbly mouthfeel and easily drinkable. Now if only GI would bring back the bottled oatmeal stout..."
"The taste is not far off the indicators in the aroma. There are plenty of dark malts, roasted notes, some nutty flavors but nothing too assertive in that department, very sweet chocolate, and a honeyed sweetness, probably from dextrin added. Things tighten up a bit in the finish, but overall this is a too sweet nut brown ale, with some nice caramel and toffee notes, but not enough nutty flavors, and too much of the cloying sweetness. It's a decent beer, very enjoyable and drinkable, but this is not a Sam Smiths by a long mile."
"D- Very drinkable. Would be great with Thanksgiving dinner. Too bad it's not going to be bottled anymore."
"D-This is a pleasant brown ale. It's a shame that GI has decided to discontinue this brew."
"D: The beer is very drinkable and quite sessionable. It would definitely pair well with food as the flavors in the taste are not very overpowering."
"D- It's pretty easy going down, although after a while, it tastes like whole wheat crackers more than anything else. I bet it would be good with hummus and carrots, or maybe something creamy."
"D: Very drinkable...good sessionability. A nice and easily accessible brew. Will miss having this widely distributed (not as much as the oatmeal stout though)."
"D: yes, malty goodness at a relatively low abv, interesting enough to have more than one."
"Pours a copper colour, with foaming white head. Malty aroma. Average mouthfeel. Malty,including chocolate malts,caramel, making it easily drinkable, and not too sweet.Some nut flavour offsets, as well as some decent hops. Suitable carbonation. Refreshing."
"Drinkability: I heard this beer was now going to be no longer bottled so I hunted for it and got a bottle, but I'm not sure how I feel about it. The appearance is great, but it smells/tastes like someone was smoking when it was brewed. Maybe it is meant to simulate a smoky English pub. I'm not getting it though. The description sounds so good on the bottle but this is, sadly, a disappointment."
"Not awe inspiring, but not bad at all. For my taste, I wish it had a bit more chocolate and fruit character to compliment and counter the huge body, respectively."
"Drinkability: One of the better traditional English Brown Ales around. Or it WAS one of the better until they foolishly decided to axe it. Just a shame."
"I had read today that this beer is no longer going to be bottled. While at the liquor store tonight, I saw a six pack and thought I should pick one up before it's too late. Poured into standard pint glasses. Dark brown color with just a hint of ruby red towards the center. Very nice sized white head. Not a lot of lacing. Smell reminded me of slightly burnt coffee beans. Taste was very pleasing. Very malty, with a hint of vanilla and honey in the background. Slight chocolate aftertaste. The mouthfeel is what I have been craving from other brown ales. Some heartiness is exactly what I like to have in this type of beer, and GI delivers. Borderline almost as thick as a porter. Low abv, great taste, and even better mouthfeel all add up to one great brown ale. Too bad this is the first time I've tried one, but better late than never."
"drinkability - this was a beer i drank in college back when it was called hex nut - might go out and buy some more since it will not be made again"
"Nothing too special, pretty straightforward."
"The name change ""minus the HEX""doesn't mean the flavor did, still malty,nutty, and a slight hop finish, pours great....and the flavor changes for the best as it warms, just like a good American Brown Ale should. Not as Rich and thick as some American Brown's (Dogfish Head Indian, Bells Best Brown, Avery Ellies Best Brown etc....) But this is on my list to buy when I come across it."
"I think I taste black patent malt. It is darker tasting brown ale, closer to a stout in some ways. The aftertaste is long lasting with chocolate and coffee notes. The body is as expected."
"I admit that nut brown ales are seldom on my radar but this is worth sampling again. Nice job."
"Taste, sturdy for a brown ale, not a thin brown ale. Minimal hop presence, but smooth mouthfeel for the ample malt background. Very easy drinking, not my style of beer, but easy to acknowledge that this is one of the better ones I've had, price is average for what you get."
"Drinkabilty- Even though it is a darker beer don't let that fool you it goes down nicely but it is one of those beers that after you have had two or three you are ready to move on to something else. It is an ok brew and like the rest of this pack it seems like a generic representation of the style. Is it good sure could it be better of course. I would say that of the four beers out of this sampler this would be one that I would probably avoid in the future."
"Overall, robust and flavorful, a nice Brown goin' down."
"Maybe I'm crazy for picking up dark fruit flavors here (i did have a few beers before this) but the unique nature of this brown is enjoyable as I haven't discovered too much variation in this style before this."
"M/D - Great tasting English brown from Goose Island, nice dark chocolate coffee flavor. Sweet tasting but not overpowering, very easy to drink and to share. I will keep this on my radar for purchasing again!"
"Has a coffee-like appearance, dark brown as a whole, but with hints of red in smaller quantities. Head was darker tan. Smell was a mix of sweet nuts and malts. Tasted initially like a somewhat sweet stout, but as I went on, the nuts and caramel started to become more apparent. Not too carbonated, goes down smooth. Pretty good beer to go with a dessert."
"D: A solid, but not very exciting Brown Ale, pretty par for the course. GI always does a good job making solid brews that will be widely accepted and widely distributed in the Chicago area and this fits that bill. A brew you can rely on if you find it, but not one to go out of your way to find."
"With a good pour it produced little head, but the head was nice and caramel. Left great lacing down the glass and was carbonated until the end. It was a dark amber brown color that looked great in the pint glass. The smell wasnt strong, but what there was there was a nice roasted malt smell and strong nut flavor. I picked up a little spice too with what seemed like was almost a hint of orange. The taste was a fresh nutty flavor with a nice finish of toasted malts. It went down smooth with plenty of carbonation, but seemed a bit little too thin. It was a great beer to drink overall, perfect for a cold winter day. Another great beer by Goose Island."
"Drink- Very drinkable. Not so full-flavored as some other American ales labeled 'nut brown', closer to traditional English brown ales."
"the 12 ounce bottle poured it into a pint glass rose a 2 finger head and was brown. it smelled a bit of toasted pecans and some malt. the tasted was mostly malt with a hint of nut rounded out by a nice bitterness. the nuttiness was not what i had expected i wanted more. there are some better ones out there. but this is a good beer that is drinkable it would go nice with some foods. and is a solid beer."
"D- easy to drink one or two but not interesting enough to have any more than that. i got this as part of the goose island mixed 12 pack, and i find this to be the weakest beer in it."
"D - Very nice, good example of the style."
"Goose Island has been slowly sending an increased variety of beers to our area and they're turning up in more and more stores. They're welcome here. The Pale and the IPA were great, so I figured the brown (one of my favorite styles) would be a winner. I was right. Easily one of the best of the style I've ever had--at least in a bottle. Gorgeous, deep brown in the glass with ruby highlights; a thick tan head that nearly flowed over the top and laced nicely all the way down. Roasted malt in the nose and the same in the initial taste, coupled with a touch of sweet and a hint of coffee. Dry in the finish (though not bitter, as I expected) and really very drinkable. I may look for a case of this stuff. A tad rich for a session beer, but a welcome if somewhat less complex addition to my fridge."
"malty chocolate note, with a pleasant sweetness that's not overbearing nor artifical-tasting. Tasty and enjoyable stuff."
"Pours clear and light brown color with a thick creamy head with a light tan color. The aroma is sweet with hints of toasted malt. The light body is moderately carbonated and is packed with toasted/nutty flavors from the malt. No hop presence is noticeable but the beer is well balanced. The finish is light and smooth and fades away slowly with the flavor of sweet toasted nuts."
"D - Fairly easy to drink, could do two or three no problem."
"Decent drinking beer. Enjoyed it."
"D- Enjoyed this beer. Might be a little better if fresh. Would gladly take another on if I had it in the fridge. Good nut brown which I find hard to come by in this style."
"I will definitely drink this one again."
"Pours a dark, rather clear brown with reddish highlights throughout. A small tan head rises and falls quickly and leaves dots of lace in its wake. The aroma is not very prominent. Subtle notes of caramel, nuts, and toffee. The burst onto the palate is of mild, earthy hops with full flavored malts quickly in tow. Toffee and nuts with sticky, slightly syrupy caramel. Medium bodied, warm and inviting. Highly drinkable any time of the year."
"Not going to knock your socks off, but very drinkable and refreshing beer."
"D: High, one of the better nut browns I have had."
"A treat, but I could have more than one."
"D: Fair. It has decent flavor, but the watery feel is off-putting. I'll probably try it again, but won't seek it out."
"Pours a dark black color with a nice caramel lacing and moderate lacing on the pint glass. Smells of roasted malts, dark chocolate, and coffee bean. Taste is right for a nut brown and shows a hint of creaminess, which I think is this beers greatest aspect. Medium in body, good carbonation, abv nonexistent for the most part. Very drinkable and could be made into a session if one was in the mood. A stellar beer from a brewery in which I'm just starting to enjoy..."
"D- This is another solid offering from Goose Island. Very easy drinking, and this is one I will probably come back to fairly often."
"Good stuff. Pours a deep brown with off white head. Smells of coffee, roasted malt, and toffee. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. This is a good example of a brown ale. Another solid offering from Goose Island. Also very drinkable. Got this as a part of a variety pack with honkers ale, oatmeal stout, and ipa. Great value for good beer!"
"Poured into a pint glass. Good puffy 3/4"" head leaves behind some lacing. Nice dark brown color, little bit of red. Very roasted smell of coffee. Tastes like toasted nut, toffee and coffee. Has a nice caramelly aftertaste, not too sweet though. Carbonation is good, drinkability is quite nice. I think some one who doesn't necessarily like beer would have to enjoy this. I would say this is a nice beer to look forward to in a multi-pack but I wouldn't actually go out and by a six-pack of it. It's fine, but Goose has better beers (Honkers, Oatmeal Stout, IPA)."
"Nice easy to drink brown ale here. Personally, I would reach for a Newcastle over this. If it wasn't as burnt tasting, it would be great. Still a solid brown ale."
"Overall this is a good beer, and I am lucky to have a local brand that has the ability to take this style on and execute it properly. That said, if you are local as I am this is one beer that can cellar for a short time to improve."
"My first reaction was that this beer was a little underwelming. But after trying a second bottle a week later, it grew on me. It poured out brown with slightly red highlights. What little head there was quickly fizzled away. It smelled mostly of nutty malt with underlying caramel. As it warmed the caramel moved forward and swirling it brought out a hint of dates and other dark fruit. The flavor matched with nuts, caramel, and malt - though not with any great complexity. The finish was OK, though the mouthfeel was a little thin. These flavors are not robust and diminish if served cold."
"Drinkablility: A good nut brown ale that I will drink again."
"Very drinkable, indeed. A nice sessionable brew that is easy on the palate."
"D -- Man, this is a solid darker, medium bodied ale. Perfect for the Autumn weather, tasty and satisfying. Anyone hot for New Castle Brown ought to try this as a fresh alternative."
"Poured into a pint glass, this beer has a very dark brown, almost black looking body with an off-white head. Aroma is of toffee, caramel and toasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Flavors of toasted bread and nuts lead to a sweet finish. Very nice beer for a brisk fall day."
"Pretty nice atmosphere. Decent appearance, and really solid nose. Slight complexity in flavor, and good balance and combination of components. Overall, this is a pretty good quaff."
"Pretty Drinkable beer"
"D: Lovely brew. It reminds me of a nut brown I used to drink back in college in the UK (22 years ago). I love it when a low ABV and simple beer is well done and has some character."
"D- Left me wishing my buddy had brought more than one, would be a great session brew. I'll get it again if I get the chance."
"M/D: This one is smooth and silky. Very ""sessionable"" beer."
"D - this is a very good session beer. Not very dull but not in-your-face with flavors. I haven't had this in a couple of years and I am glad I picked up a six pack of it."
"Pours a clear, dark brown with lighter brown along the bottom of the glass. 2/3 inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and good lacing. Smells of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight yeast, hints of coffee, and a slight citrus aroma (raisin). Fits the style of an English Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and creamy with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, hops, sweet malt, and brown sugar. Overall, a very easy drinking beer with good appearance and aroma. A little too sweet for my personal tastes, but otherwise a solid beer."
"This is probably one of the best beers I have ever set lips to. If there ever was a perfect beer, this is it. If I lived in Illinois, I would drink this all the time and I am not sure I could go back to the somewhat good beers. This is a connoisseur's beer. I can't give enough praise for it. Bar none, one of the best beers and breweries in this country (USA, that is)!"
"Conclusion: Decent English Brown, but nothing really makes it memorable...I love GI, but this is not one of their better brews IMO"
"They just put the cask on today so this may be the first time it has been in cask form (perhaps why there are no other cask reviews?). Chicagoan's should definitely check this one out!"
"I posted a review of this beer from notes and thought I did it an injustice, so I decided to re-do a review with a fresh beer poured into my Samuel Smith Pint Glass. Wow. I love this beer from Goose Island. Taste and Drinkability are definitely the highlights of this brown ale. On a recent visit to the Chicago area, I drank this beer and Three Floyds Gumballhead and I couldn't have been happier. Give this GI beer a chance, you'll be glad you did."
"Bad mouth A-B if you want, but you can't diss Goose Island for making one hell of a brown."
"A dark brown color with three finger head. Had a somewhat strong smell, including a bit of a nut smell. Tasted like nuts with a bit of a hops taste. Mouthfeel was very creamy, especially before head was completely gone. Had a pretty decent drinkability."
"Really liked it. I wish I were a better more descriptive reviewer so I could do this beer justice."
"This dark brown ale pours with one finger tan head and the blossoming aroma of roasted hazelnuts and pecans and even nutmeg. It greets the pallet with mild, sweet malts and finishes with more nut flavors. Has a slight oiliness that coats the tongue and helps those wonderful nut-bread flavors linger. With limited malt sweetness and a modest ABV, this beer can be a great session ale."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a coca-cola brown with a reddish hue, very small brown head. Aroma is of sweet malts, caramel, nutty, and maybe a touch of roast, not really any hop aroma. Flavor is caramel, nutty, roast, a little bit of chocolate, and a slight bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium, fairly active, with a slightly astringent finish. Pretty solid beer."
"Drinkable. These are easy to go through quickly and beg for more."
"One of the better GI offerings that I've had."
"Notes: A good beer to have with burger and fries. Decent in every aspect and worth having from time to time."
"Easy drinker & a very solid brown that's going in the rotation this summer!"
"I can drink these often. It's no Sam Smith's but it's more affordable."
"This one pours a deep brown color with a nice tan head and very light lacing. The smell is definitely of nuts with underlying malt sweetness and a toasty grain background. The taste is malty with typical caramel sweetness that isn't overbearing. A toasty nut taste finishes and very light herbal and fruit notes lurk. Mouthfeel is thick and malty with a pretty full body. The smell and taste aren't especially complex, but they're well-balanced and rich. It's nothing particular or extravagant, but it's a well-crafted brew."
"D: This is an easy drinking beer, very good rendition by the guys at goose island"
"Taste: Expected a little bit heavier beer but I would say it is still a medium to full bodied beer. Carmel sweetness but less pronounced then the smell with a slight toasted taste. There is not a very strong aftertaste and for the most part is fairly sweet without being too sweet."
"When I drink Brown Ale, I'm looking for chocolate and caramel malt. This had more of a coffee flavor."
"Goose Island Nut Brown Ale poured a nice brown/ruby color with a nice tan head. Smell was of sweet nuts and hints of hops. Could have smelled a bit stronger. Taste was nice, lots of chocolate and hints of nuts. Mouthfeel was a little think for me. Drinkability was good. Overall a nice brown ale, would buy this again for sure."
"D- Could have ten tonight. Tasty and nice, without too much to think about."
"Taste leans heavily toward the sweet malty side of things, but it has a nice balance of toasty malts and floral hop bitterness. I like the fact that I can pick out the nuttiness, kind of an almond and pecan flavor. It's all a tad too muted, I would like it a bit more in-your-face, but that is being picky. Basically, it is a great session beer that wont get boring to fast."
"D - Get me 10 of these. I can keep drinking these all night."
"D: I really enjoy this beer. It is well made and consistent with the style. I like the depth of flavor and the way the different flavor elements compliment each other. IMO, this is one of the stand out brews from Goose Island."
"A little too sweet and roasty to be sessionable. Still an enjoyable beer though."
"Drinkability is awesome on this beer. Goose Island created an English brown ale that has great taste to it that is all balanced out in a nice way. I would be happy to sit back with one of these beers or take down a good amount in a drinking session."
"This is a fine English style ale that has strong flavors yet is very easy to enjoy"
"D - A good flavor, along with a good alcohol content, makes for a sessionable ale. Nothing really exciting or new with this beer. Just a reliable brown ale worth drinking."
"Notes: I will stick with Samuel Smith for my Nut Brown Ale but this is adequate."
"It looks pretty with its shiny dark brown body and thin tan head. The mild carbonation is perfect for a heavier beer, but the taste was just not that good."
"Overall, a really solid beer from GI. I've only had a few of them and that was mainly about 4-5 years but they have always impressed me. Gonna have to get some more of them to try. Recommend if you can easily get. Good session beer."
"Smooth and medium bodied this beer is a delight to drink. It feels good on the tongue and really works to whet your appetite for another beer."
"Nikki"
"Drinkability: Not a great session beer, but good to drink after a meal."
"Drinkability: A decent beer but there are far superior examples of nut browns out there to choose from. Makes for an okay quaffer."
"Pours a brown with some light peeking through at the edges. The tall creamy brown head is leaving a lot of lace,this looks better than I anticipated. The nose smells of caramel malts and toffee. Some nutty flavors,but more along the lines of caramel,chocolate sweetness. Some nice hop bitterness and subtle watered down coffee flavors. The mouthfeel could be a little fuller matching the flavor profile better. Nicely carbonated and a sugary sticky coating lingers after the pallet is dry. A nice NBA,not one of my favorite styles,but this one delivers."
"Drinkability is very high. Simple, tasty, nothing crazy complex. Nice brown ale."
"Thanks, Wadsey, for the opportunity"
"Overall Not to bad of a job one of the better nut brown ales I have tried."
"Mouthfeel is inconsistent and watery, the only real drawback to this beer."
"Drinkability is good,this is not aSammy Smith-this-is-the-best-brown-ale-ever kind of English ale,nothing really spetacular, but good nonetheless"
"D: I had two before I finished this review and thats only happened a couple of time so I'd have to say pretty damn drinkable."
"It is a very dark brown with a little bit of redness to the hue. It is opaque looking for the most part almost stout or porter looking. It has a tan head and lace. It has malty aroma with just a hint of nuts. Honestly it is bland in the aroma. There is some decent lace. It had a nice head but it disappeared quickly. Slight flavor is slightly nutty but I would go with more of a toffee flavor almost like a porter. At the end it has a sweet chocolaty bitter flavor. Smooth body."
"I've only had a few beers identified as a ""brown ale"" and this is definitely my favorite. I am loving Goose Island more and more for what they do."
"I can see these in my future."
"Nothing horrible here, but nothing really special either. This would go better with a big burger to hold it up. Just not enough character or body to stand alone."
"Lightly carbonated and pretty smooth. This beer is going down fairly nicely. A little more on the bitter side than most of what I have tried thus far, but it doesn't affect the drinkability much for me."
"The feel is medium and to style. Very drinkable and would works well with the changing of the leaves outside. Pairs great with stews and roasted meat."
"Good brown ale, one of my favorates"
"I really like brown ales and this one is pretty good representation of they style."
"All in all, a good brown ale, nicely done but not spectacular."
"D-Easy to drink and overall a good brew i'll reach for this one again for a solid brown"
"This is one of my favorite brown ales. A big roasted malt character that hits the spot perfectly. This is really not a complex beer, but one that I easily enjoy."
"D: Goes down very easy, this is a highly quaffable nut brown ale, and one I will enjoy in the future."
"drinkability is good. this is a smooth and semi-mellow drinking brew that has a pleasant warming quality, perfect for an autumn evening. cheers!"
"This is a fine English style ale that has strong flavors yet is very easy to enjoy"
"Thin is a nice malty English-style brown ale!"
"overall, this is a very solid offering very sessionable very nice and not overpriced"
"Draft at Goose Island Clybourn brewpub. A very dark brown, little head or carbonation. Weak aroma. Decent maltiness in the flavour. This was a reasonable brew and fits in well with their profile of low carbonation beers. I was pretty happy with the range of beers from this brewery this evening."
"D: Excellent easy drinking, well-rounded brown ale."
"D: very nice brown ale that is extremely drinkable. awesome session brown ale."
"Poured a rich dark brown color into my imperial pint glass. Thin head that remained for the duration and the lacing was modest at best. Very aromatic brew giving off hints of dark roasted malts. The aroma was malty, sweet, nutty, and even a tad bit hoppy. Drinks easily and is very smooth on the palate. This beer is chock full of good flavors that meld together very well. Good finish which makes this dark ale easily drinkable. The flavor of this seems to lean closer to a porter than a brown ale, but either way this is simply fantastic."
"Very good brown ale, just the way I like them. Like many of the other Goose Island beers, it's highly drinkable."
"Poured to a good slight brown head. Ale was brownish black in color. Had some decent lacing that left rings around glass with every swallow. A little head stayed along the sides of the glass. Had a nutty sweet chocolate smell. With a slight coffee smell. Maybe a hint of alcohol. Tasted of malt and caramel. I thought it was also a bit on the dry side. Flavor of burnt coffee hung around for a while. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonaation was right. I dont think I could make this a session beer. But I will buy this again."
"D - Really good and delicious. Easy to drink. I'd enjoy many more of these if I had them. This beer will only improve with some increase in temperature. I would recommend letting this bottle warm before pouring it to a glass to get the most enjoyment."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Small head on a very dark brown. Hint of sweetness in the smell, caramel and perhaps honey. A smooth beer on the tongue, featuring nicely the caramel, coffee and nuttiness. Typically not a fan of this style, but this one is quite good. Glad I picked it up."
"Very drinkable brew, could throw these back all night."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew is a chocolate brown color with a 1 1/2 in cream head that left nice lacing on the glass. The smell is rich with honey, nutmeg, and some slight burnt caramel. The flavor is subtle with notes of caramel, sweetness from honey and dark malts. I don't notice the chocolate I expected in the flavor, a little more burnt malts. Medium body, light carbonation. This is a good session brew, very enjoyable."
"Overall, this was a good nut brown from Goose Island. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it."
"This isn't too bad. The flavor is too weak, though, and although this is easy to drink I wish the flavor were more robust."
"It took a little while to finish this and I don't think I'd revisit it just based on personal preference...especially considering it's a style I like. It gets points for being unique, but it's not my thing."
"A good ale! I would look for it again. Goos Island scores again."
"This is one I won't pass by any longer. Why I've overlooked the excellent Goose Island wares, I have no idea. I've sampled lots of different beers somewhat at the expense of a very good local brewery. No more, for Goose Island continues to accrue points in my ledger."
"Prefect drinkability. Would be good to session."
"The nose of the beer smells of a dark chocolate with hints of something sweet, probably caramel. The beer tastes like chocolate with a slight bitterness from the hops and dark roasts. The sweetness is hidden under the chocolate, and it's quite pleasing. It has a nice bittering taste that makes you want to have another drink. A bit too much carbonation, but it isn't too bad. The beer is a bit creamy as well. Very drinkable."
"Living in Chicago we often take Goose Island for granted, especially something like this ""nut brown ale"". But really, it is a special beer, or at least this sample is. If you paired this with pecan pie, you'd have yourself one helluva great dessert. Give it a try!"
"Recommended..."
"M/D- Relatively light mouthfeel. Like I said before, it's not overwhelmingly strong, nor is it too carbonated, so it's pretty smooth and easy to drink."
"D: I found myself drink this really quickly - so maybe it has some good qualities, but it doesn't make me want to have another after it. Not a bad beer, but doesn't offer anything special and is a bit weak in flavor and body."
"good carbonation. medium body. good beer. maybe could do a session. i will get this mix pack again in the future. follows style."
"MF&D - Medium bodied and highly carbonated. Not a bad beer, it went down well, I just wish it had tasted as good as it smelled."
"Drinkability: A very pleasant ale. Not remarkable in any sense, but has no outright flaws. It fits the bill well."
"extremely easy to drink a ton of this"
"Bottle courtesy of Indybigtom: Poured a clear deep brown color ale with good foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of caramel malt with subtle notes of nuts. Taste is also dominated by some nutty caramel malt with a dry ending with limited hops presence. Medium body with good carbonation. Well done session ale."
"The taste is really earthy, with tons of caramel malt and that same nice nuttiness. It's integrated well (if there's one thing I hate about brown ales, it's that they're often basically simple roasted malt with horrible nutty twang). The beer has some sweetness to it also, which balances well."
"D-This is a good drinking English-style brown ale. A bit lacking in total depth but I certainly enjoyed it and would have it again."
"Tasted on 2/12/08."
"Pours a rusty orange-ish brown color, with a moderate head that is completely gone within thirty seconds. Smells of sweet and roasty malts with a mild tinge of chocolate. Medium bodied, but it is a tad thinner than I'd like. Taste is sweet, caramel, roasty, bit of chocolate, bit of coffee, mild hops, with a dry finish. Highly drinkable for a sweet beer. Relative to the limited world of Nut Brown Ales, this is a good brew that is not too pricey. Certainly worth a taste if you like the style."
"Basically black, with a hint of ruby brown and a fluffy beige head. Nice fairly complex smell for a brown. Nice mild roastiness, touch of coffee, cream, and nutty. Taste is quite nice with same flavors coming through. Smooth, a touch watery, yet almost creamy at the same time. Couldn't decide where the mouthfeel stood exactly, but the beer overall was quite good, and one of the better of the style I've had."
"Pours a deep amber/ brown-ish color with a tan head. In the aroma, nutty and sweet, hints of caramel. In the taste, sweet nutty maltiness and a small stickiness. A medium bodied and smooth mouthfeel and a dry nutty and malty in the aftertaste. A nice brown, non offensive. A nice big nutty presence."
"Good beer. All of GI's standards are solid. Dig the mouthfeel. I would drink this hometowner anytime."
"Pours a very dark brown that shows some light. Head is very thick. Quite a bit of lacing forms on the way down. Flavor is smooth. Noticeable sweet edge almost like honey upon first impression. Nice malted aspects as well. Nothing really crazy going on here, but it is definitely smooth. Good feel on all levels. This is a very nice brown ale. I would love to try this on cask."
"Notes: Great session beer. Pairs well with many foods, usually on the blander side. Although I suppose it can hold its own in a lot of situations. Damn good beer."
"D - I am enjoying this one. Good flavor, but not overwhelming. Sweet, but not too much. I could drink a couple in a row."
"Better than BMCs though there are better English Browns just as accessible in Chicago with the big liquor stores opening up. All I can say is, I've had worse."
"D - This is a pretty good brown ale. Good nut flavor."
"D: Complex flavors and a low abv make this very sessionable. I've been drinking this since the early days of Goose Island, when this was known as Hex Nut Brown Ale and I have to say this has gotten much better as time has marched on."
"""Nut"" brown is a good way to describe this one, as roasted nut flavor dominates the palate. There is a musty sweetness here as well, and bitterness is kept to a minimum. Mouthfeel finishes dry and is medium-full. A quality brown ale that lives up to its name."
"Poured a nice attractive brown color with garnet highlights and tan head that didnt last too long. Aroma was of chocolate and coffee. Flavor was also of chocolate, coffee, and also some nuttiness to it. At first I found this a tad thin, but remembered this is not a porter. Good beer that I enjoyed with great drinkability."
"D - This one is a smooth brown ale that goes down fairly easy. Drinkability is good."
"Was hoping for a nuttier presence in this but still this is actually one of the better nut browns that I've tried. Eminently drinkable and sessionable. If I could get this in Tn, I would drink this. Nice beer."
"The beer has a solid malt backbone with a hint of chocolate. The finish is ever so slighty bittersweet. It has a smooth almost creamy mouthfeel with good carbonation. A nice satisfying beer."
"D: This beer is niether overly sweet or bitter, it's pretty well balanced in all aspects, but they seem to blend together a bit to much where it takes quite a bit of work to seperate the things happening on your pallate. A complex beer to be sure but I would have liked to see a progression from sweet to bitter rather than it happening all at the same time."
"D - Good beer, nice and light with good flavor."
"pours a very dark color color with a brownish head. smells of sweet malt and coffee. the taste is good, once again goose island gives us another all around good beer. has a good malty taste, alcohol is balanced well. mouthfell is good. has a full body to it, but the best part is the drinkability, i've gone through 4 in like 2 hours, easy drinking, good beer with a good taste. recommended."
"Mouthfeel: Average carbonation. On the heavier side of medium bodied."
"Overall- A session beer for sure! Tasty and easy to drink."
"A little too subtle for me but if you're looking for a lighter beer its not bad. Seems a little pricey for what seems like a jazzed up macro."
"d: Delicious. Robust, but smooth. Rich, but not too filling."
"This is one nice session beer. I felt it had too much flavor for a nut brown, actually, reminded me more of a porter or a mini stout. Full flavor, medium bodied..pours an opaque black, has some chocolatey notes and some nuts..not to mention coffee. Nice on a November day watching some Thanksgiving football with the roasted almonds! This is a nice offering."
"Pours a rich brown with little head into a small snifter. Aroma is of roasted/nutty malts and not much else...smells tasty. Taste is more of the same malt flavors a little sweetness then a nice dry finish with good mouth feel and carbonation. Overall a tasty little brown ale."
"a nice chocolate, dark brown color to it when it pours; very opaque as not much light filters through it...has a bought a thumb of thick milky brown frothy head; can smell a little bit of the chocolate coming through the beer; goes down pretty smooth not a very thick brew; good taste too it...kind of a sweet taste; almost a bit caramely in my opinion; leaves a nice smooth feeling on the tongue; overall a pretty good beer that definitely has some character to it and i could see having a couple after a heavy dinner"
"pours a nice small head that receeds quickly with little lace that disappears unlike other GI this one doesn't hold foamy head and lace like others. Very dark brown ale Smell is of toffee, coffee, mollassis it also smells creamy if it can smell creamy. Taste is creamy for sure with coffee on palate. This brown ale puts samual smith and new castle to shame. My favorite nut brown I have tasted yet. Very drinkable session beer that goes well with a Chicago Bears victory."
"D-It's okay. A little more complexity and hop character would be welcome."
"This is one of my fav styles of beer and I was not impressed with this brew, just as I am not really impressed with many of goose islands brews."
"Served in a pint glass. A deep brown liquid with an off white head that left minimal lacing. The nose is of roasted malt, coffee and sweetness. The taste is very malty, but not overly sweet. I taste what I smell, coffee, roasted malt and slight hop taste. Finished dry. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. I would and have sessioned this."
"I don't really know the difference between an ENGLISH Brown Ale or an AMERICAN Brown Ale.... but my reference for a perfect Brown Ale to date is Mt. Carmel Nut Brown Ale... that one is categorized as an AMERICAN Brown Ale..."
"Drinkability: Flavorful and quite drinkable. This IS what I want in a brown ale."
"D- very drinkable nothing too overwhelming just alot of flavor balanced just right into a beer that tastes like it should be lighter in color."
"Very drinkable; even people that don't like darker beers should give this one a shot because it's so pleasantly sweet."
"A very dark brown, almost black brew with a big light brown head that stayed pretty well down to a solid ring at the end. Some lace. A big warm aroma of molasses/brown sugar and, as advertized, some toasted nuts. I smell a hint of raisins as well. The flavor is fairly true to the aroma, a little more toward malt and caramel. The carbonation died a little early I thought so it got a bit watery near the end. A solid flavor and reasonably drinkable. A pretty pleasant taste experience but it didn't finish as well as I would have hoped."
"Drinkability is very high. Not a strong, overpowering ale nor is it watery and tasteless. Very impressed. Could be a session beer if one truly enjoys brown ales. This is one beer I picked up by chance and will look for it more than once more."
"Very drinkable beer and good winter beer. One of my faves and the first five in my book."
"Smell is very malty and a bit earthy. Almost smells like a glass of unsweet tea with perhaps some ground oats in it. Taste, too is very, very malty with loads of toasted cereal profiles. This seems bereft of any hops at all, in fact. It is also quite sweet, which is why I placed drinkability at 3.0. This is a good brown ale that I like very much, and could perhaps be sessionable if by sessionable you mean around three. The sweetness on the finish in this one would most likely prevent me from having more than four of these at the most in a sitting. I did really enjoy it, though."
"Deep brown ale, almost dopplebock brown. The body is a bit more present than I'd like, although it's still quite enjoyable and refreshing. Carbonation fades after about 10 minutes. Nutty and malty, with a gentle noble bitterness. Slightly tangy. This beer could use a bit more carbonation to lift the body a little. This brings the drinkability down a hair. Very English interpretation of the style, right down to the estery yeast. This would make a great candidate for the hand pump. Very good, although perhaps a bit too filling to be a session ale. Cheers!"
"Pours a deep brown color with a small light tan head. Just a little lacing,. Scent is good, lots of nutty malt, some spices and a little hops. Taste catches you first with the roasted nuts and malt. Some mild spiciness. A little bit of a watery taste shows up every so often, but overall a good flavor. That roasted malt taste sits throughout. Feel is thin to medium bodied. Overall, a good beer that won't knock you over with its flavor but it ain't too bad either. Good session."
"Overall, a decent beer, just not really my style."
"Like this and remember when it was Hex Nut, I think. Will read other stuff to confirm."
"Have another? Yes I will, thank you."
"Not too great in the taste department. It's balanced alright, I wouldn't be angry with a few more hops, but the taste is pretty minimal. Not a bad English version of the style."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown, darker than most brown ales I've seen. Lacing is good, but the head retention isn't. It smells like caramel, roasted malt/grains, and a bit of chocolate. It tastes like caramel, nuts, and roasted malt, I think it has a good mix of sweet and bitterness. Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but not watery. Drinkability is good, it goes down easy and has a bit of a dry finish. I think this is an OK beer, good but not great. But it's certainly drinkable."
"Overall impression: Browns don't impress me but this one stands out. I liked the malt complexity and the aroma. This is interesting and highly sessionable. If there were more examples out there like this, I'd be a much bigger fan of English browns. Strongly recommended."
"Low-medium body, a really nice, clean session beer."
"This one seems to have been made as an easy-drinker, a patio session ale that might appeal to a wider market, especially since the brown ale style is fairly unassuming much of the time, and can be used as a decent stepping stone into ales. Many thanks to rudge75 and fisherman34 for the sample!"
"Smell is muted. What is there is malty and sweet. Taste is sort of like almonds. I guess that's where the ""nut"" part comes from. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied. Overall, just a very average beer."
"Although I would say this beer is medium bodied, it does sit a little thin as it lacks points in the smell and taste arena. If you can get past the subtilty, this could be sessioned easily."
"Decent mouthfeel but overall, I expected more."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin and lightly carbonated. All in all this is a good drinkable beer that could easily be sessioned. I am not an expert by any means but it seems to be just about an average beer for this style."
"Very dark brown, almost opaque. Less than a finger of tan head. Aroma is full or chocolate with a little coffee and caramel. Smells like this could be warmed and served at Starbucks. Rich malty flavor, with a strong coffee aftertaste. There is some chocolate in the flavor too, along with some toast and nuts. Full, creamy mouthfeel and lightly carbonated. This is one of the more enjoyable nut brown ales that I've had and look forward to having some more of these!"
"A pretty good showing overall and pretty much what you would expect from Goose Island."
"very dark amber, minimal lacing and head. Their IPA is growing on me more and more. But the aftertaste on this one is a little off for me. heavy malt, more metallic than nutty...it's a quality beer, just not my taste. I'd take their honkers over this..."
"It also feels a bit watered down; easy to drink but not exactly remarkable."
"Beer was almost hazlenut colored, which I suppose would be fitting for a nut brown ale. Smell was nutty, slightly yeasty, with a certain sharpness to it. Taste was nutty, slightly bitter, with a hint of yeastyness. The carbonation was almost too much, but that may just be for my personal tastes. Mouthfeel wasn't bad, beer felt light despite the somewhat intense flavor, only real downside was the sharpness and carbonation. Whlie the beer was certainly drinkable, the downsides hurt the drinkability a bit. I could see some people loving this, but I wasn't a huge fan. I'm not in any rush to try this one again."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep brown with a off-white/tan one-finger milky head.Smell is slightly nutty, carmel and toasted malts also present. Taste is initially sweet with the nutty toasted carmel notes comming out, balanced nicely with a fair amount of hops, smooth finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied with a good amount of creamy carbonation. Overall I would have to say that this is a very drinkable beer, probably my favorite so far by Goose Island. A very solid nut brown ale."
"Over all, it was a smooth nut brown but it lacked flavor"
"Another good product from Goose Island, but not one of their best. It is semi-sweet richly malted with strong brown sugar-caramel over tones. It's appearance is a deep reddish brown with very light and minimal foam. It has a very strong roasted coffee caramel smell. It drinks easily. Lightly carbonated and finishes semi-sweet. That being said, this is one of those beers you are going to strongly like or not. It has a strong character."
"Another trade from jhammerly. Pours a clear dark brown color, some carbonation, not much of a head, basically no lacing at all. Scents of sweet malts, slight hops, roasted nuts, some and chocolate. The taste is of roasted sweet nuts/malts, nice little bitter bite in the finish. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little brew from GI."
"D - This is another great session beer and I can't wait to have a few of these on tap the next time I'm a little further north."
"D- Another solid session brew!"
"D - I could drink this all night without my palate yelling mercy. Very enjoyable beer from Goose Island."
"Was advised that this was an exceptional brown ale. As far as browns go, this one is ok but I wouldn't say exceptional. Pours a deep mohagany brown with thin tan head and minimal lacing. Smells strong of expresso, nuts, and a hint of tobacco. The taste is very coffee flavored with tobacco hints rolling along. Mouthfeel is somewhat watery but decent overall. Not something I would purchase regularly but a solid brown."
"The pours is deep brown. Very little head or lacing to speak of which was surprising. The aroma is nice combination of bitter and sweet. Flavors are a very enjoyable blend of chocolate and a presence of honey. A mellow caramel flavor is present in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and sweet. Drinkablity is also good. Overall this is a fine nut brown ale. Another winner from Goose Island."
"I could have a couple but I most definitely must be in the mood. A change of pace type brew although there are other brown ales I'd purchase before this one"
"Like a lot of Goose Island beers, this one isn't over the top, but it is a good representation of the style and I'll definately enjoy it again."
"Thanks to Jhammerly for this opportunity."
"I wouldn't drink a few of these at a time but like one every now and again. Worth trying, nothing too great though."
"Drinkability - this is very good ale, and very sessionable."
"A very drinkable brown that would make quite a nice session brew. Too bad I only have one...."
"Roasted coffee with cream and sugar accompanied by peanut overtones dominate the palate in this smooth and creamy nut brown, which resembles a porter to my mouth."
"Highly drinkable and very interesting. There is enough going on here to keep me interested for the duration of more than one beer, but nothing overpowers the senses. A sessioner for sure, this is a top brown ale IMO. Goose Island keeps on impressing me....and so close to home!"
"Overall a decent brown that I like to pick up every once in a while, but you would not want drink a bunch in one sitting as it is sort of rich."
"D - A tasty brew, no doubt, but too rich to drink a lot of at one time. But certainly worth having on hand."
"Pours a very clear deep ruby-brown, with red-orange highlights. Creamy three finger head, off-white, shows good retention that leaves sticky patches of lace. Malty aroma of mild and brown malt, toasted crystal, and some faint leafy english hops in the background. Sweet crystal and pale malt upfront, some roasted notes, and an earthy fuggles hop flavor. Slight drying in the aftertaste, english hop bitterness is assertve but fairly balanced. The medium body and carbonation give it a smooth, malty mouthfeel that is devoid of diacetyl but not overly dry; and is properly dried by a fresh hop presence. Finishes mild, with hints of toasty brown malts and herbal hops, very drinkable. An excellent american interpretation of the style."
"Not a bad ale. The cloying sweetness subtract from drinkability points. The heavy use of roasted malts almost takes this ale out of the Brown Ale category. Just the same, the complexity and smoothness are very pleasant making this a nice after dinner ale."
"Pours a deep brown with slight amounts of red coming through the filtered light. Head is minimal, perhaps I poured it too gingerly, but the head retention is very good considering the minimal head that initially occupied the glass. The smell of this beer is great. I love it. Immediately I notice a smell of chocolate and perhaps hazelnut. Tastes pretty good, slightly too heavy to drink too much of, but definately a nice beer to drink to enjoy the taste rather than the effects of the alcohol. The mouthfeel is the only unpleasant thing about this beer to me, as it is very carbonated and gives that ""miller high life"" like slight burn."
"mf/d: Mouth is slightly drying but overall pretty moderate and smooth. Overall I would say this is way too malty and not very balanced but it is interesting enough to be enjoyable everynow and then."
"Ordered this on-tap at Goose Island in Chicago. Poured a clear, reddish-brown with a medium-sized, off-white head head. Heavy lacing. Smelled nutty and malty, hints of light-roasted coffee. Overall sweet quality to the aromas, as well as the flavors. Dominate tastes of the malt, plus a light nutty character. Hints of sweet sugar or caramel. Smooth mouthfeel, with a little bit of carbonation. Adds up to a very smooth and pleasant flavor. Very drinkable beer."
"Drinkability: This one went down really easy. I could have quite a few of these in a row. I would say a very good choice for a couple of beers on the patio."
"Notes/Drinkability: I was very pleased with this brown ale. One of the best I have partaken of in quite awhile. Well worth the pick up and is my favorite goose island beer to date."
"But it's the taste that wins, this beer gets you at ""hello"" and you don't want it to stop talking to you until you've had a fully engaging conversation with it. By then your glass is half empty. Deliciouslybut not overlysweet, with warm suggestions of honey and chocolate, a very slight suggestion of coffee, and the vaguest hint of an Oreo cookie generously swiped through a jar of Nutella. In fact, given all the parallels, this beer comes deceptively close to the stout-style, save the color. This beer from Goose Island triggers memories of a long-time favorite of mine, Trader Joe's Stockyard Stout, and it has been purported on this website that Goose Island does the actual brewing and bottling of TJ's SS. There are many similarities in flavor between the two, minus graham crackers, minus port wine cheese, plus smoked chipotle peppers, plus grilled pork tenderloin with peach-mango salsa, minus..."
"Pours a dark brown/garnet with a scant khaki head. Nose is chiefly roasted malt with a hint of sweet caramel and nutty earthiness. Taste starts off with burnt dark/coffee malts earthy nuttiness, bittersweet chocolate and a hint of milky toffee. Mouthfeel is thinnish and a little overly crisp but still remains a drinkable brown. One of the first craft beers I tried after Newcastle got me off the American macro-swill. A tasty little brown indeed, if a little rough around the edges."
"Pretty drinkable, but fairly one-dimensional."
"This would be a great session beer. A solid brew that doen't have anything to offend."
"drinkability: not bad except for the distracting carbonation level"
"I enjoyed it at the Old Chicago in Manhattan, KS."
"Verdict: The body is fine, but it doesn't have a rich depth of malt flavor. The hops and the estery flavors end up sticking out the most."
"A deep dark brown color, that is slightly transparent, it has a lite caramel head that disappears very quickly. The sweet smell of malt is very strong folowed by a touch of hops at the end of each scent. The taste is very good the seet malt and the nuttiness from the roasted barley blend well together. In the mouth it feels a tad rich and bit chewy, but is very good goin down. The only down fall is maybe a tad to much carbonation. The beer overall is very good, it makes want to order some welsh rabbit and sit in an english style pub."
"Pours ruby brown, with a moderate head and only some hints of lacing. Aroma is grainy, kinda like biscuits, toasty. Taste is malty, kind of rich, minerally (if that's a word). Nothing outstanding, but better than a Newcastle. I do find this beer to be rather highly carbonated, and that is disracting to me. But it does strike me as a very sessionable beer to enjoy."
"Pretty decent beer."
"The beer pours a brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet malty scent that boasts of burnt toffee and caramel. It's smooth with a dry nutty aroma. The taste is good also. It has a dry, yet malty flavor that boasts of crystal and victory malts. It's full of malty flavor, but it's a little too dry on the finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a good drinking brown ale. It's got a nice malty taste and a wonderful aroma."
"Drinkability: The beer is a very solid drinker. This beer has remained in my drinking line up for a long time."
"Dwonderful. I love this beer due to the chocolate that I could taste and will return often."
"Pours a dark brown with a good sized persistant head which leaves a nice lacing. The aroma is sweet malt with a few fruit notes. The taste is dominated by sweet caramel malt with a lot of roasted malt which adds complexity and bitterness. There are some faint chocolate and fruit notes. This beer has a nice medium body and is quite drinkable."
"Mouthfeel- For a darker beer, this was a very light to maybe medium bodied beer. Definetly a session beer for me."
"d - I would drink it again. Goes down smooth and easy."
"Like most other beers, I'd drink it again if I didn't have to pay for it or if I were in a bar and there were nothing better on tap. It goes down well and is very satisfying, but I do crave more flavor and more booze."
"An all-around great brown ale, tasty and easying drinking. I'd really like to try this on-tap."
"Drinkabilty: superbly drinkable, overall a very enjoyable brown ale worth seeking out."
"D: Good brew from Goose, exceeded my expectations, and I'll probably be drinking more of it. This is the best thing I've had from them in a bottle that's not in the ""reserve"" series."
"This is a good brown ale to drink when you want something a little sweet. The sweetness dominates initially, but the bitterness balances out after the first sip."
"D - Having only one of these in my fridge was a bummer. I really did want another, maybe 2. As quick as it goes down, this is a very drinkable beer."
"Pours a very dark reddish-brown with a small beige head and small flecks of oily lacing. Smell is very faint roasted malts and light coffee accents. Taste follows suit with a bit more robust flavor than I expected, but still has a pretty light mouthfeel overall. I've never been too impressed by the style, but I've had better Nut Brown's than this. Not unoffensive in any aspect...but nothing to write home to mom about. Worth a try? Sure, why not."
"My wife brought this one along with some other Goose Island beers back to PA after a family visit in Illinois. This one was brownish in color with ruby red hues. Little head when poured and little lacing as I drank it. Malts are sweet smelling along with nutty and caramel aromas. Dark fruits are also present, prunes and raisins, but also a little metal somewhat like a kitchen sink. Taste is very nutty, but some caramel taste gives it a little sweetness. Seems thin, but smooth and easy to drink."
"This beer exited the bottle and displayed a brilliant deep brown colour. A moderately aggressive poor yielded about a finger of sticky looking tan head. The head held fast for some time as I examined the properties of appearance. The nose was not overly aromatic, but it held some subtle and pleasant scents of chocolate and musty nuttiness. The taste was very mild and soothing as I find most brown ales to be. Chocolate and caramel tones were notable as proclaimed on the label. Soft hints of brown sugar and overtones of graininess filled the air as well. There was also an oily nut character that combined well with the other flavours. The mouthfeel was fluffy and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation and oily slickness. Very drinkable. A great beer."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice creaminess and active carbonation. This one goes down easily and packs in plenty of flavor as well. I could easily see myself sitting down to a session with this one. Another tasty Goose brew that I have neglected for too long!"
"A smooth, rich brew, lightly effervescent. It flows across the palate & tongue and leaves behind a wonderfully rich, malty, dark chocolate aftertaste. Absolutely fabulous beer. Perfectly balanced and amazingly complex."
"Full bodied, thick, with a carbonation kick. Just a strong performer in the English brown ale arena."
"A good brown ale, but I'd go for Arcadia instead. Poured out to a dark cherry brown color with a nice foamy head that was of an off white color. Aromas were light and hard to detect, but traces of caramel and sweet malts were detected. Taste was better than mass produced brown ales (New Castle), but lacked character and depth; flavors of lightly roasted nuts, medium bodied malts and mild herbs and watery coffee seemed to be the extent of what I could make out. Mouthfeel was good and medium bodied. A good level of drinkability. I just expected more flavor and depth from a brewery as good as Goose Island. Worth a try."
"Clear medium brown color with a light not quite white head. Solid malt aroma with good earthy hop tones, the malt has decent complexity with some slight chocolate and some good toasted bread accents. The flavor is well balanced as well, bitterness is there, hops are there, yeasty finish, and of course some malt, not overly sweet, grainy and slightly burnt bread. The body is solid, I don't get a nutty finish as much as I do toasty. A well made brown ale, a far tastier choice than Newcastle."
"This beer pours a very nice deep dark red color, with a small tan head. Beautiful color! The smell is mainly chocolate and caramel, with some malt present as well... very nice! It tastes similar to the smell, mostly caramel and malt, with a little tartness at the finish. The mouthfeel is quite good as well, nice and medium bodied, there is a fair bit of carbonation, but it adds nicely to it, in my opinion. This is a very drinkable beer, I wish they sold it in my state, as I'd gladly enjoy one now and again."
"A straightforward and immensely enjoyable ale."
"The texture is quite smooth and velvety with a medium body. A slight bitterness envelops the mouth from the nutty, earthy, roastiness, and maybe even some hops, though none are immediately identifyable. Drinkable, though probably not a brown I will be buying again."
"This brew pours a dark brown color with a lagre creamy light tan head. The aroma is creamy, nutty and sweet. it is very pleasant, but rather faint. The taste is of cream, and roasted malt. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but leans toward the thinner side of medium bodied. Overall, this is a decent brown ale. It will do if nothing better is available."
"D-This beer is nice to drink ice cold but as it warms slightly more of the harsher malt qualities come through. It has a little tanginess to it in the finish, and the watery mouthfeel comes through stronger."
"Good body and limited carbonation. Very smooth in flavor but limited malt taste. It has an American feel than more of a traditional dark ale. Good taste and enjoyable."
"Although, not a very complicated brew, it gets the job done. Very drinkable."
"A good Nut Brown, however, I think I got an expired bottle. Opens up with nich roasted aroma followed by hop, chocolate, and pecan aromas; most of which were a little subdued. Brown-ruby colors revealed a moderate tan head with some lacing. Flavors brought in the roasted, chocalate, toffee, vanilla, pecan, walnut flavors behind a solid dark malt base. Fermentation brought a good sourness, when added to the hop bitterness, offset the sweetness nicely. Medium body revealed good creamy texture aided by good carbonation. Finished a bit grainy and abrupt. Age of the bottle showed flavors of cardboard and copper. Must try a fresher bottle to compare."
"Drinkability-I really like this beer. Nice flavors and aromas and it is very easy to drink. It's beers like this that proves that Goose Island is a great brewery. The fact that they can consistently produce beers like this even as they grow larger shows that it can be done. Miller and AB, take some lessons!!!!"
"New packaging (no ""Hex"" here). Almond brown in color with a loose off-white head that does not last. The smell is fairly light and sweet, mainly light caramel and faint hops. The taste has a slighly seltzer-like quality to it, with plenty of burnt caramel flavor, some light caramel notes, and slightly bitter hops to finish. Mouth feel is very soda-like and somewhat thin at times. No long lasting aftertaste. This beer is not fantastic, but it is non-offensive and goes down very easy."
"Chestnut brown in colour with a slightly lower than average amount of carbonation. Roasted nut is the primary aroma, along with a touch of toffee. Flavors are very roasty, with a bit of chocolate and caramel sweetness. Light mouthfeel helps to make this sweet nut brown quite drinkable."
"Dark, dark brown that turns a brilliant ruby when held to light. Disappointing lack of head. I suspect that this might be an old bottle. Sweet aroma of caramel and raisins. Nice and malty, true to the style. Rich dark caramelly malt flavor, with coffee and raisin backup. Mild herbal hop bitterness rounds it out. I'm not a huge Goose Island fan (despite it being the most readily available micro in Chicagoland) but all things considered this is quite a nice ale."
"Pours an attractive dark caramel color, catches the light well. Good lacing. Smells like cooked vegetables, ""cabbagelike."" Tastes the same upfront, but with a really nice malt husk bitterness to save it from being completely dull. I liked this beer a lot more before I started trying a bunch of different kinds of brown ales. It's a good jumping-off point."
"This poured a nice dark caramel/chocolate with hints of crimson and had a nice fluffy tan/beige head, with large bubbles. The aroma was of toasted malt, caramel, honey and a slight astringency on the end. It had a taste of roasted malt, molasses, burnt caramel, charcoal and oak. But when I wasn't looking it hit me with the flavor of a very creamy choco-mochachino ice cream. The mouthfeel was very slick and creamy. Light on the pallette with little carbination. Overall, this is a very top-notch nut brown ale. I'd enjoy this as a session beer also due to it's low ABV."
"Pours a mahogony brown with a nice tan head that dissipates but leaves a thin fine lace. Fairly clear. Malty aroma with a hint of roastiness. Flavor of this beer is fantastic. Nice malty richness with hints of chocolate, coffee, caramel, and faint fruity esters. Medium body and well carbonated. I haven't had an opportunity to try anything from this brewery in the past as they don't ship to TX, however I'm in Indiana and picked up a 6-pack. I will definately be buying some more to take home with me. This is one of the best commercial English Brown Ale's I've ever had!"
"Clear brown, medium white head forms, and laces well. Smell is malty, some chocolate notes. Taste is very nutty, substantial malt, chocolate and coffee is present. Very very smooth and creamy beer, light carbonation, medium mouthfeel. A good offering from the Goose."
"Very smooth, medium to full bodied and easy to drink"
"Poured a rusty brown color with one finger of head that fell to coat the beer. The nose was brown sugar, nuts and roasted malts. The flavor was nutty and brown sugary sweet. Solid and nice on the tongue. The feel was a light moderate with too much carbonation. This could easily be a session beer. IT was very smooth and drinkable. A nice beer all around."
"Dark copper color with a frothy beige head that rises up and settles quickly, leaving a fine cap atop the liquid. Light aroma of toasty malts and brown sugar. Flavor is light upfront, leaving me wondering where it is. It slowly grows as it moves across the tongue - very light biscuity malts, some brown sugar, a bit of toffee, some cocoa, but not much more. Perhaps a tiny hop tingle as if finishes, but the carbonation could be fooling me."
"Drinkability: Really good beer. Definitly could see myself buying this in a six pack!!"
"Best consumed 050105 1115 and obtained from To Your Health (Coralville, Iowa). ½ finger tan/light brown head over a brown liquid. Smells strongly of bakers chocolate. Some nutty and a hint of roast. The first taste is roast right at the tip of the tongue. Then sweet that moves into an initial dry chocolate. This then transitions into a really pleasing malty sweet chocolate. Some molasses. Im not picking up on any hop bitter or floral qualities. Also, no alcohol to taste either. This is a nice easy drinking brown ale. The aftertaste is dry and fine carbonation forms on the tongue. Md body."
"Maybe the perfect session beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" light tan head over the clear reddish brown brew. Foamy head holds its own, and lacing is average to good. Aroma is caramel malt sweetness, with a touch of fruity hoppiness. Taste is sweet maltiness upfront, with some light fruitiness in the middle, and a pleasant crisp close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are excellent, with a bit of a grainy aftertaste knocking the m'feel down a peg. Nice representation of the English Brown style.."
"Pours with little to no carbonation, but also has a really nice reddish tinge to it. Very nutty aroma, mildy sweet. The flavor is similar, maybe a little bittersweet on the finish. Hops is barely noticeable, if it's even in there. Mouthfeel is quite bold, especially given the mildness of the brew. This is very drinkable and a fine session beer to have on hand for seemingly about any preferences."
"This ale pours a reddish brown color with a minimal tan head. I smelled roasted malt and perhaps a hint of chocolate. The taste is a bit sweet. I was surprised to find less roasted taste than smell. It finishes with a bit of bitterness and alcohol. This would be an easy drinking beer, nothing too overwhelming or thick."
"Clear brown-ruby color; thin beige head. Aroma is toasty, nutty. Flavor is malty, nutty, slight alcohol sweetness, a bit to bitter for the style. Finishes dry and bitter. For an American-English brown it is a good choice. It is not dead-on for the style, but who cares when it tastes good."
"Solid drinkable brew seems to be closer to American Brown Ale in flavor though."
"Drinkability: This is a fine brown ale, one I will definitely have again, and will have to let friends try to introduce them to the style (in addition to the Empyrean version)."
"This beer is a brilliantly clear, deep-dark ruby-amber color. The head is frothy and a tan color. The aroma is full of roasted malt notes, sweet caramel, coffee, and grain husks. The taste is full and malty sweet, and has lots of caramelized malt notes to it. This beer is also nicely fruity with notes of raisin and fig. Interestingly enough this beer is not nearly as roasty in character as the aroma suggested, it has a bit of lightly toasted graininess to it, and a hint of roasted grain husks, but these are far from being dominant characteristics of this beer. From about the middle onward there is a nice balancing bitterness that tickles the tongue yet relinquishes its grip after the beer disappears down my throat. This is another very enjoyable brown ale by Goose Island."
"An almost perfectly fizzy mouthfeel helps this beer go down smooth."
"Hex Nut Brown Ale from Goose Island is a good offering from the Windy City, one that I will visit again, I am sure."
"Overall, simple but effective."
"Also available in bottles, but if you are in Chicago and are able to visit either brewpub, do it! Not only is the beer and food amazing, but the servers are always more than happy to get into the details of the process involved in this, or ANY of their great beers. When drinking this beer at either of their locations, it's best served in a 12oz pint glass. It's the best to experience the aroma that hits your nose perfectly before letting the beer hit the back of your tongue. Just another winner from one of the best breweries in the world."
"Overall, not a bad brown, and pretty easy to drink. I certainly wouldn't say no to having another one."
"A pleasantly solid brown ale. I'd like to find more of this."
"Lovelly brown ale..I really enjoyed this , very drinkable and it only cost me $3.99 a sixer."
"I would definately have another, if I had one."
"Thanks to oldcrustacean for the bottle!"
"Appearance: Tawny ruby brown hue with a creamy toffee tan head leaves retains well as it slowly dwindles leaves behind thick patches of scattered lacing not bad. Aroma: A nutty chocolate toned edge in the forefront with creamy milky sweetness in the finish with roasted edges I feel this beer is a very nice representation of an English Style Nut Brown ale. Taste: Smooth flowing wave of darker roasted malt sweetness tailed by a touch of bitterness characteristics that shine is the toasted nut with caramel edges very nice chocolate creaminess in the finish. Mouthfeel: Medium body very silky texture light carbonation allows this very quaffable. Drinkability: Nice brew I could definitely see myself drinking and enjoying this side by side with Sammy Smith's version."
"pours a very dark brown with a decent head. smells malty, nutty and slightly of chocolate. Taste are remeniscent of chocolate, nuts, and caramel. Very malty, this is almost a desert beer. Fairly easy drinking, and in my eyes would be a great session beer. I rather enjoyed this one. Good job GI"
"A damn good nut brown ale. Dark brown with reddish highlights and an off-white tan head of foam that lasts for the long haul. The aromas are of sweet caramel, milk chocolate, light coffee, and some general nut flavors. The taste is nutty up front with some coffee flavors in the middle, and some sweet milk chocolate and caramel flavors in the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thick for a nut brown, but the drinkability is very good! This reminds me of Sam Smiths nut brown a bit, and that is definately a good thing! Make no mistake! This is a sweet, English style nut brown ale!"
"i wasnt expecting much from this, but was suprised..its not a complex beer, but it doesnt have to be...very refreshing beer that is perfect to drink regularly."
"Final Opinion: It's like a modified version of Newcastle Brown Ale, a little more complexity in it, very pleased!"
"I really enjoyed this brew. One of the best brown ales I've had. The touch of smoked malt really adds character. My type of brown ale...brown but not pansy-ass like Newcastle."
"A very good Chicago beer with wide availability."
"This is one malty beast. I'm not a huge fun of brown ales but this one makes the cut in my book. Pours a nice lucid brown with a creamy frothing head. Smell is very malty and full of caramel and the taste matches the nose well. Very malty with just a slightly sweet finish (which is good because i still have yet to gain an appreciation for super sweet beers). Drinkability is decent as well. Good beer."
"Deep brown color, with a tan head that fades, yet leaves a partial layer on top. Smells faintly of carmel and burnt notes, not much of a hops presence. Taste is very one-note. Not much of a flavor transition, or it is just that well balanced. Roasted malt flavaors, again, not much of a hops aftertaste. An ok beer, if not slightly above average."
"12oz. bottle: The beer pours a ruby-brown color. It is also clear. There is a bit of an off-white head that doesn't linger very long. Aroma is nutty, with some roastiness and sweetness to it. The taste is Somewhat nutty and sweet, with some chocolate roastiness in there. A hair watery. A good compliment to the Honker's Ale."
"ng"
"Goose Island Hex Nut Brown Ale tastes like I hoped it would. I prefer porters and stouts, but this one hits all of its style marks right on the nose. This is a quality brew that I'll be sure to look for again."
"A nice beer. Definately drinkable. I'd recommend it and love to try it on tap."
"It tastes good. There's brown nuts from start to finish with very well-blended hop content. Recommended; any complaints I've had should be considered minor."
"Overall a pretty great beer. Flavor and presentation are top notch."
" An excellent brown ale in all respects. Another fine brew by the folks at Goose Island."
"Clear brown-mahogany hue with a graceful ruby highlights, the beige head reached a hearty finger before it faded slowly to half that size then it depressed to a loose cap. Laces in a spotty fashion as the beer was consumed. The potency of the nose is very modest, a little too much so in my opinion, hard whiffs invokes toasty malts and toasty caramel notes and grain, hints of chocolate. The aromas are indicative of a Brown Ale yet I am not pressed to drink it. The palate doesnt have much going on, this is said as a fan of both Brown Ales and Goose Island. Frankly Hex Nut is a bit of a disappointment. The maltiness is small, there isnt a richness in the taste, some disjointed sweetness, the toastiness is faint and there is little in the way of caramel influences, traces of nuts conclude this portion of the beverage. The hops are modest, appropriately so but the flavor they impart are ordinary. Pleasantly dry throughout. This is easy drinking but I can do better when I have the urge to drink a Brown Ale, like Third Stone for instance. Medium in body, low, modest carbonation, maybe a little too much so, the mouthfeel is a touch slick and it is lacking in substance. The aftertaste is lightly nutty and sweet. Yes it is drinkable but is it flavorful? No so much. Ill drink my other sample but Ill skip it in the future. Purchased in Sioux Falls, SD."
"Goose Island's Hex Nut Brown Ale tasted like a classic brown ale. Actually it tasted like our home brew but a tad milder. It was fairly balanced, it wasn't overwhelmingly hoppy, malty, or sweet. It was what a brown ale should taste like. It was clear, maybe a bit light in color. I liked it. It's low abv makes it an easy drink."
"Here's a decent brown ale from Goose Island. Good dark caramel/red color, no head to speak of, no lacing. Nice refreshing taste, not overbearing at all. Much of what you'd expect from a brown ale. It's like Newcastle but not as spicy. I'd give it a shot, but don't expect to be blown away. You could easily drink this all night."
"This one poured a watery copper color with a nice sized white head. The smell was a nice combination of nuts, caramel, and toastiness. But the flavor was weak. It tasted watered down and too shallow in complexity for my liking. Water was the main flavor here followed by slight malt which included caramel and other weak flavors. This does go down easy but I feel they made this to suffice the public when they could have stepped it up a notch if they wanted to. That's fine, but I just feel it had to potential of being better."
"Another solid player in the Goose stable."
"Finished well and enjoyed several."
"Wow! What a nice beer to be finding at your local Jewel. Pours a nice head that's just a little off-white. Complex chocolate with other flavors (your dad's pipe smoke?), nuttiness is implied more than overt. Take this one home with you and it'll respect you in the morning."
"I'm not really a fan of brown ales, but this one seemed better than a lot of others that I've had."
"This is the best american brown ale I have ever had. And the reason I think it is so good is that it is very similar to an altbier. Nice tannish head on a dark brownish black body. Nutty aromas mix in with flowery hop aromas. Sweet malt is nutty in flavor and slick in mouthfeel and the hops are bitter enough to balance and give it a quick dry ending. This is more of an altbier than their sticke altbier. I could drink this all night long without changing to another style."
"I like this and will buy more of this....This has a lot of flavor and borders on porterish...beats the heck out of Newcastle.."
"Just like the label says, this one is brown and really rather nutty. Good patchwork of retained lace throughout. The beer is alll about nuttiness as is picked up immediately on the nose. In the mouth a pronounced sweet, oily, and even a tad savory roasted peanut flavor chimes in. The sensation is like that of eating a Resess peanut butter cup-sweet, then chocolatey, then salty, then roasted aftertaste sensations. Another session styled offering from goose, and a decent nut to bust for cool weather season here in the city."
"Deep brown and very clear. A slight malty aroma is basked in the glow of bittersweet chocolate. Light to medium-bodied brew but a bit thin and lacking in depth. Bready, cookie-like malt flavor and feel. A roasted presence on the tongue becomes the outstanding feature through the carmelized and burnt sugar finish. Minus its roasty, chocolatey character, this brew is a bit ""normal."" As it is, it's a highly drinkable ale with a little bit of unique character."
"Bottle:Poured a very small sized tan head with fine sized bubbles.The body was carbonated with a dark brown hue.The nose had notes of coffee and malts and chocolate.This beer's flavor was that of coffee with a mild aftertaste.It had a smooth, thin, watery texture with a light body.The lacing was fair."
"Dark brown color, medium beige head. Aroma is nutty, malty and slightly sweet. Medium bodied nut brown ale. Nice nutty flavor, full roasted malts. Smooth flavor. Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Aftertaste is nutty and slightly bitter."
"This is a pretty good beer. Had it on tap. Very smooth and easy to drink with a hint of nut in the flavor. It pours a cloudy brown color with a small, but thick head and leaves a tiny bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma was very sweet and nutty. The flavor was very much the same with a nice maltiness to finish it up. The malty/nuttiness sticks with you in the aftertaste for a great finish. I would have this one again."
"Goose Island brews represent some of the best values in microbrews today. They are rarely exceptional, but pretty solid overall and not expensive. This brew pours a dark, tawny brown with virtually no head. The aroma doesn't leap out at you but there's some definite maltiness and faint roasted grain. The taste is malt dominated with toffee, a bit of cafe latte and a finish of roasted grain/barley flavor. A good, easy-drinking food-friendly brew, although it seems a bit thin and watery."
"Pours a dark brown with copper highlights, topped by a tan head that is relatively thick and fades to a malty film of foam. Nice caramel and a slightly nutty aroma, perhaps a hint of choclate along with the light hoppiness. The taste is nice and malty, with a very nice nutty finish. The light sweetness is balanced well by the bitter hops on the finish. Chocolate covered caramel flavors intertwine with the nut and slightly roasted malt flavors. This is a well balanced and slightly complex beer, which makes it enjoyable. The mouthfeel is smooth with enough carbonation to lighten the presence on the palate. Drinakbility is very good, as this would be a great session beer. Finishes almost neutral, with just a slight lingering hops and nut aftertaste. This has got to be one of the better browns available. None better come to mind at the moment. (maybe Avery's Ellie's Brown). For $6 a sixer, this will be hard to beat. I will buy a bit more on my next trip towards the heartland."
"The epitome of a 4.0 beer. In every category it is above average, just not much above average. THe appearance is dark amber with a malty, nutty aroma. The flavor is typical of a brown ale, light nutty and better when not too cold. The only hoppy flavors come out when this is just colder than room temp. I recommend decanting and leaving for at least a half hour. Then the flavor is nutty and warming to the throat. very enjoyable with good drinkability. For the money, this is a tough beer to beat."
"Hex Nut Brown Ale is dark reddish brown in appearance with minimal head and lacing. Moderately sweet and earthy in flavor at first, with a slightly astringent, medium bodied mouthfeel and then somewhat bitter finish. Hoppy aroma and delicious flavor, but not exactly what I expected from a nut brown ale. In my opinion Hex Nut Brown Ale is more like a stout in many ways. It's far roastier and hoppier than say Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. To me Hex Nut Brown Ale seems a little unusual for the style, but it's still very good. I hope to try more offerings from Goose Island soon."
"yummy, not quite what i was expecting though. i like brown ales to be nuttier and with the ""nut"" in the title i thought i had that coming. anyway, still a very good beer. dark, dark brown appearance and roasty smell. goes down very smooth, i could drink it all night, and i'm pretty sure i did. i definately recomend, but not my fav brown ale"
"A really deep dark mahogany brew that is just great in initial appearance. Nice tan head that fades far too quickly and leaves only faint traces of lace. Strong nose has delicate malt notes and, perhaps, just a hint of hops. The body is medium to light and a bit watery. Flavors come across as a sweet start with a mildly bitter ending in the front that lingers for an instant then disappears leaving behind a very dry finish. Very drinkable ale."
"for sure a good beer. If youre into coffee style beers, this ones for you. Comes out with about an inch of a nice light brown head, smelling like a stroll through colombia (the part the US isnt herbasiding all the time). Tastes like a morning cup, smells great, another good installment from goose island."
"This is a rockin' good nut brown! Great color, darker then most browns. Very deep brown and glowing, with a light head of foam that fizzes out quickly. Aroma city with this stuff, excellent coffee tone with a strong nut and caramel roastyness. The smell of this stuff was sooo gooood. Tastes just as wonderful as it smells echoing all the aromas with superb balance of sweet caramel malt, hazelnut, some chestnut & pecan maybe, with cocoa and vanilla like notes. Smooth medium body and solid nutty hold on the tongue and mouth. Drinkable, you bet! Very drinkable, very good, very flavored. Great googlymoogly Goose Island has done a great job on this brew."
"Clear mohagony hue. Thin, creamy light brown head recedes to a collar in about a minute. Lacing is spotty at best. Nice little roasted nut/vanilla bean/coffee nose. The taste is very pleasant. Some underlying cocoa accentuates the roasted qualities nicely. Mix in a little hop bitterness and flavor, and this is not too bad. One of my favorite brown ales. The carbonation is just right to provide a creamy mouthfeel. Body is medium full and the overall drinkability of this brew lends itself to a nice session beer."
"Thanks to feloniousmonk for this bottle."
"Overall a very nice brown ale for the person ( i.e. me ) who really doesn't like brown ales that much. Much sweeter and richer than most brown ales but balanced not cloyingly sweet. Would like to see a wee bit more hop flavor come through in the finish."
"I don't sample many nut brown ales throughout the year, but this is one of the better ones I have had of the American variety. Poured a very rich, darkish brown. Darker than I had anticipated. Smelled of rich malt with some toastiness. The finest and bare minimum of lacing, surrendering everywhere but the very edges of my pint glass. Taste has the nutty quality, but also an equally partnering chocolate-malt/light roast tang - a bit unique. Nice craft brew."
"A dark reddish brown color, and a small tan head. Aroma is soft, nutty, notes of caramel, toffee. Nice initial hop play on the palate, with solid malty sensation coming in from behind. Full-bodied and full of flavor. Warm, toasty, and tasty, the nut flavors continue through the finish. Well-textured and satifying, a perfectly delicious ale. Great craft-brews like this really show up the naked emperors of the big beer world, like the dismal, thin Newcastle."
"Overall, not bad. I have had it before and think I enjoyed it more that time, however."
"Appearance was very dark brown with a little amber coloring. The head was dissappointing lasting for only a minute or two. The aroma was very strong with caramel, malts, and maybe some chocolate. Very little nut taste for a nut brown ale but still very good. Very little hops to speak of. One of the best nut brown ales I've tried, especially for the price. I look forward to trying more of the Goose Island products."
"Hex Nut Brown: from Goose Island in Chicago. A very brown beer, with not much of a head. I do recall that at one time I was not much of a fan of this beer, but it does appear that it has grown on me. Not much head, but the taste is fairly decent, very malty, not much in the way of hops, but all in all a nice brew."
"Deep brown with ruby highlights. Has a light brown head with good lace-work. Has a toasted malt aroma as well as a nutty aroma. The flavors are of sweet toast/roast malt. Chocolate and nutty flavors weave their way through this brew. The hop bitterness is way in the background on this one. The carbonation is at a low level with this light-medium bodied beer. Overall, this is an excellent beer, with various nutty and toasty malt flavors. I would definitely drink this one again."
"Pours clear brown color, bready-caremel aroma. Small off white head, doesn't last long, sweet nutty malt flavor, starts sweet and finishes clean, light body, watery mothfeel, but does have some good flavor."
"Poured an almost opaque brown with a foamy light tan head.  Aroma consisted of chocolate malt, roasted caramel and nuts.  Taste is of bitter chocolate, burnt malt and a strong smokey finish.  The finish kept reminding me of the taste of a  full-bodied cigar.  Very complex and satisfying brown ale."
"Deep mahogany with a thin tan head that settles quickly and nearly dissapears. Aroma of roasted malt... coffee and chocolate. Flavor isn't nutty at all... a lot of roasted chocolate flavor. Light to medium body with low carbonation. A very solid beer, but nothing that really jumps out at you. A good session ale."
"After a few tastings of this beer over time, I feel it is best after it has aged for a bit -- after all, it is bottle-conditioned so can afford to be."
"A workman-like brew. Solid all around, but not memorable in any special way."
"More enjoyable than Newcastle's version, but a little more pricey as well. I tasted a hint of nutmeg and/or brown sugar (I don't know my spices that well), and this Ale managed to be both smooth and robust at the same time. Good stuff."
"This is one of those ""all body"" beers., but a pretty decent stab at an English Brown ale. Would have liked a bit more depth of flavour."
"Pours dark amber with small, fleeting head.  Aromas are present though hard to describe.  Upon tasting it, I would describe the smell as I would the taste--sweet.  Rather smooth yet with a hint of maltiness and darkness toward the end.  Smooth and drinkable--a fine, midline brew."
"This beer poured a dark reddish amber color and formed a light tan head that subsided quickly and left some lace.  It had an aroma of hops, caramel and malt. The flavor was of malt and caramel.  The finish was medium, slightly creamy with a defininate caramel aftertaste.  Not as good as some of their others, but still a good beer."
"A good drinking brown ale, more of an English style (sweet) brown ale. If you are into malty brown ales this one will do you right. Good pairing with chocolate and / or caramel sweets."
"Hex Nut is a good name with hints of roasted nuts, chocolate and almost coffee like.Is it a porter or almost stout-like? I was surprised by this dark ruby-brown brew with a tan ( shortlived ) head and lace.I found it a cool brew with a cool name that fits."
"I had this beer while traveling.  It was served with a thin head that quickly disappeared.  Slightly malty, roasted grain aroma.  Very mild, subtle taste.  Seemed to be well made, with no flaws, but not very interesting."
"Seems more like a porter. Nice and mealy. Roasted nuts and chocolate. Dark color with a hint of auburn. Very light sweet smell. Perhaps my favorite available Nut Brown."
"Clear, dark ruby / brown in color.  Light nutty and bready malt in aroma, just a touch of dark chocolate.  A mellow but earthy Willamette hop nose is there as well.  Lightly bodied, w/ an agreeable mouthfeel that adds to the drinkability.  Slight chocolate and biscuit malt flavors are most noticeable, since hop bitterness and flavor is quite mild. Very clean overall, with nothing outstanding or offensive in taste.  Finishes with slight caramel sweetness.  Hex Nut is innocuous, drinkable, but perhaps a bit bland.  It could easily pass for a mild."
"impressive.  very dark brown color, tan head that fades quickly.  faint notes of caramel, chocolate, molasses, prunes and other dark fruit tease the nose along with some hops.  moderate body.....the taste backs up what the nose has already detected.  delicious.  crisp in the finish with some hops just to balance."
"Also seemed like a porter to me,very chocolaty and malty like one.Somewhat nutty undertones,cant drink to many somewhat heavy,but well crafted.Would like to try on tap."
"One of my favorite Browns, very nutty taste that makes up for the style's tendency to blandness...nice persistent character, even evolves in nutiness in the back of the throat...fresh smell and nice clean amber/brown color, especially for a bottle conditioned brew..."
"Predominantly malt aroma with just a shot of fruit scent to it.  Rather small head, that stayed very thin.  Very dark brown with hints of red and seemed clear.  Dark roasted malt flavor with some sweetness, plus fruitiness qualities in middle and finish.  Some bitterness to balance and a little to the finish.  Medium fullness, with more carbonation than I would have expected. Another good beer from a respectable brewery."
"Very mild, with restrained hops bittering.  The somewhat nutty malt struck me as being more like a porter than a brown ale.  Very pleasant."
