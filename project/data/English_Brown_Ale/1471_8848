Sweet roasted chocolate malts, molasses, a hint of coffee, and a hint of caramel as well. Has a nice earthiness to it. Some lightly roasted nuts.

Pours moderately cloudy deep ruby brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some moderate streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, molasses, brown bread, brown sugar, nuttiness, light chocolate, light raisin, herbal, and toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown sugar, brown bread, nuttiness, light chocolate, herbal, light raisin, and toasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, brown bread, nuttiness, herbal, light chocolate, and light raisin on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of dark malt flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a moderately creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice brown ale. All around good balance, complexity, and robustness of dark malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 20, 2013"

Thick, sticky, chewy feel with delayed, but rich carbonation that seems to pull the flavors forward. Dark caramel and roasted malt flavors up front that intensify into the middle. As the carbonation rolls through dark fruit, raisin and sweet fig flavors grow until a bitter hoppiness takes the taste buds for a turn down the stretch. Dark chocolate followed by dark roasted malt and coffee flavors with hint of nuts toward the end. Finishes with a dark roasted malt and dry pine hop bitter aftertaste.

3.95,5.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Many thanks to Kzoobrew for the chance to taste this one. Poured from bottle into DFH snifter glass. Pours a very dark brown opaque color, nice thick, chewy looking head recedes and a light tan ring remains and clings to the side of the glass. This looks like a great beer- barely any light gets through. Smell- nutty, toffee, faint brown sugar. Taste- warm, nutty, caramel, contrasted by a bitter roasted malt that hits the back of the throat. Maybe just a slight bit of astringency, but it works well with the balance. Carbonation is a little sharp, and makes it a little difficult to get all the flavors. Overall, I'm a fan. A nice beer from Dark Horse that I would have again.","lnashsig","Nov 16, 2011"

Leafy bitterness with sweet malts up front, caramel and bread, dry roastiness in the finish, nutty. Fairly astringent, medium bodied with lowish carbonation.

3.65,-2.7,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Brown ale is a style I approach with hesitancy because there are so many terrible brown ales on the market today: mostly watery, bitter pale ales with brown coloring. Fortunately, this beer comes across with some muscle but not so much that it terrifies the children or causes old women to pass out on the sidewalk. The aroma and taste both approach UK-stout territory: quite fruity with an emphasis on oranges, yet with a dry finish; plenty of charcoal and roasted whatever-it-is provide enough complexity without much intellectual hooey. A fine accompaniment to a big plate of pancakes.","gfreed","May 11, 2011"

The taste has all the great characteristics for the style, but there is a hoppy bite in the finish that may be warranted, perhaps no. I'm just really enjoying the creamy, roasted notes, and the bittering cooking chocolates, and then bam, this really leafy bittering hop and drying punch hits you in the finish. It's okay, but I'm marking it down as a flaw in the beer, although some folks may like it. The punch lasts well into the finish and is just more than i wanted.

Up front the flavor mirrors the nose- bakers chocolate, that note of mollasses, with a little touch of espresso bitterness off the back for balance. The mouthfeel is round but crisp, drying just a little, with a mellow herbal hop in the aftertaste. Brown ales tend to get overlooked- everybody's running after their IPAs, Belgians, or the newest/weirdest barrel-aged concoction.

The smell is coffee-like in nature, but with a blend of toffee mixed in as well as some cocoa powder. The flavor of the cocoa powder is strongest on the palate, but there is some molasses character coming through as well. There might be a hint of toffee. All of the flavors are really mellow in this beer nothing is potent or overwhelming, which also means that there isn't any distinct character as well. The cocoa flavor on the mouthfeel actually almost dried out the tongue, but the smoothness of the beer actually made it still a good drinking beer.

4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Toasted, nutty malts up front. Brown sugary sweetness and caramel follow. Earthy, woody, mild bitterness lurks in the background. Dash of maple syrup, a bit of chocolate milk, some toasted walnuts. Delicious! Medium-bodied with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. A nice session brown, on the sweeter side.","alexgash","Aug 01, 2010"

4.07,8.5,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"I've enjoyed most of the regular Dark Horse offerings and this is no exception. Pours a cola brown, nearly opaque color with a thin light brown head that quickly fades to a thin cap with splotchy thin film and minimal lacing. Aroma is rich and sweet, heavy on malts and nuttiness. Thick and smooth body with a sweet nutty and milk chocolate finish. Flavor is molasses, caramel, sugar, roasted malt, light hops; in general very robust and pleasant for the style. Nothing too exceptional, but a very flavorful, enjoyable brown.","yourefragile","Beers"
4.33,15.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A recent trip to Columbus proved the fact that Dark Horse is in full effect in the state of Ohio. I saw shot gun tap handles in every fine beer bar we stopped at. This one appeared locally, so I had to go with it and a couple bottles of Double Crooked Tree. Appears a deep cola brown with large tan head forming nicely. Speckled scattered lacing is left behind. Aroma is full of nutty dark chocolate and creamed coffee tones, very nice dessert feel to it. Creamy sweet upfront with some hazelnut/almond tones with background herbal hops kicking and a bit of dry bready yeast notes. Dark chocolate creamed coffee and ripe fruit collide to make some damn good brown ale. Body is a bit weired medium bodied lightly carbonated goes down easy but with a full on flavor ride. Drinkable as all hell, one of the most approachable brown ales I've come across in quite some time, this is some tasty stuff.","WVbeergeek","0"
4.36,16.3,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Strong aroma has overtone of burnt brown sugar and a hint of caramel. Pours an opaque dark-chocolate brown with a thick, creamy fine-bubbled pale tan head. Lip-smacking flavor is malty with tones of caramel and molasses and just a hint of fruit. Texture is pleasingly smooth with a nice subtle tingle. Worth hunting down!","Cyberkedi","Jul 19, 2010"
3.92,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"First flavor to come out is that of sweet (but not overtly sugary) cream. The mouthfeel of the brew also has a light cream to it as well now that I'm mentioning it. Right behind it is caramel malts, brown sugar and a bit of nuttiness. The finish has something of a porter taste to it with a slight touch of bitters and baker's chocolate.","Dalem","Jul 14, 2010"

3.89,3.7,3,4,4,3.5,4,"A cloudy dark brown out of the bottle. Head was minimal, as was the lacing. Neither one stuck around very long. Smell was of faint coffee and nut, (roasted malts) and a slight touch of sugary sweetness. Taste was of roasted coffee, spice and malt sweetness. Low bitterness i thought. Very drinkable. Carbonation was mild. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and went down very smooth. Very nice brown ale, less nuttier than others ive had but very nice.","jayb","0"

4.27,13.9,3.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Original Review: 3/6/03 - 2.5/5.0 Poured out to a muddied brown in the glass with virturally no head. Aroma is that of light malt. Taste was disappointing. This was a very thin brown ale with nearly no carbonation. I am thinking it might've been a bad bottle. Not as complex as Newcastle even, which is very thin in its own right. I will have to resample this one, but overall, it was disappointing.","proc","Beers"
2.4,-36,3,3,2,2,2.5,"This beer poured very dark, darker than most brown ales pour and was quite low in carbonation. The smell was semi-sweet but that was about it. The taste was simply an upfront maltiness with nothing to back it up. I can't find any hops or alcohol or yeast or ANYTHING other than a caramel flavored malt. Too thin, too bland. This should be a macro.","granger10","0"
