"This beer really surprised me.  I rarely drink a nut brown ale so I had this beer as part of a flight of 4 ounce tasters.  It looks spot on for an English Ale and has a good nutty smell.  The taste was the best I've ever had for the style.  It was nutty and malty in perfect balance.  A nice smooth finish and goes down really easily."

"Solid brew. Had on tap. Perfect to style."

"Dark mahogany with large tan head. Nutty, bready malt aroma. Light and slightly creamy with the same nutty malt taste you'd expect from the smell.  Could use a little more bite in the aftertaste, but very nice overall."

"I'm a huge fan of English style beers and brown ales. So taking that into effect this is a great example. Let it warm and you'll find that the smooth cocoa is perfectly integrated into the beer.  Mouth was creamy and smooth. Not the best brown ale I've ever had but up there. It's available and decently cheap. Homerun."

"Love this brown ale. Smooth and satisfying the way a brown should be. Try this one it is worth it."

"Overall - First, a disclaimer. I'm not a huge fan of Nut Brown Ales. To my pallet, these beers lack character and body. AleSmith's rendition is no different. It's fine for what it is. Now I'm going to go drink a good Bitters."
""
""
""
"Yeah, what he said. I'll have another"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  This is one of the best American made versions of an English Nut Brown Ale that I’ve ever had!  It’s absolutely delicious!!  Fans of brown ales should definitely give it a try.  I’m certainly going to get some more of this!!"

"Flavors of dark malt, cocoa, notes of molasses and licorice, slight metallic note. A raisin note lingers. Thin mouthfeel, a bit slick. Decent beer, but I expected more from this world class brewer."
""
""
""
"Verdict: A nice example of the English Brown Ale from AleSmith, it's simple but balanced and very sessionable at just 5% ABV. I don't often crave this style, but for those nice crisp fall days, this will definitely do the trick."

"O: a decent nut brown but the weakest offering I've had from this fine brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is brown with copper edges and a finger of fluffy beige head that stuck around for eternity and left thick lacing behind. The nose is nutty and bready. The flavor follows the nose but it is not as bold as the very best beers of this style. The body is not quite hearty but not thin either. The finish was very mildly dry and bitter."

"Dark walnut with a very nice creamy head on the surface. Smells nutty, as the name would suggest. Toasted malt, grainy chocolate, toffee, and leather - all with a charred edge. Flavor is similarly malty, but with more of an earthy hop presence. Dark chocolaty malt, nutty coffee, and just a bit of fruit to brighten things up. Not rich - more bittersweet, and clean. Medium-light bodied, slightly creamy, and quite drinkable. I like it..."
"Dark brown, reddish glow where the light hits, and small head but nice lacing. Aroma is cocoa, roasted coffee, hazelnut, creamy toffee, slightly flowery, faint bit of lemon, soap, and other nut varieties. Nice basic nut brown aromas with a little extra character of its own. Taste is lightly sweet with chewy biscuit caramelly malt, grains, soft bitterness, and flavors of malty bread, nuts, and again coffee and cocoa. Nicely done for this style of beer which I find I don't regularly crave. Very easy drinking which makes it appropriate all year long."

"Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. This beer,although labeled as a brown ale, tastes closer to a porter. Probably the earthiest,smokiest and least sweet brown I've had to date. Small amount of sweet carmel,malt to start and finishes with a smoke or burnt steak kinda taste that lingers on the tongue.Color is a very dark brown that is still see-thru with a very slight amber hue in the light. Lacing very apparent. Flavor is very robust for only 5%. Low alcohol content is probably why the bottle describes the beer as ""sessionable"" I would agree with that, but only during cold weather months. If your a porter/stout person who doesn't like browns then this beer would probably be ok with you. Overall a quality beer."

"O: Brown ales are never going to score high with me, but this is one of the better ones I've had. It also pairs really well with beef. Like, REALLY well. I'd buy it again if it were readily available in my region - alas, it's not."
"O: Very good for a brown ale. Definitely has the english-style malt taste."
"Very easy drinking, yet robust. I'm surprised it's only 5 percent. Tasty as hell though!"

"well, packaging sure has changes on this since the one shown, but the beer in the bottle remains one of the quintessential american made examples of the style, and for the price, probably the best (at least to my knowledge). love this stuff. earth tones and cocoa of the semisweet variety are the primary smell and flavor elements of this thin looking light brown beer, as red amber as it is brown really. not a long enough lasting head for me, but it shows well on first pour. add to the cocoa and the earthy nuttiness a mild vanilla complex, a minerality in the water profile, a cola weirdness, a toffee dessert vibe, and a yeast that shows elements of both burton and california ale, and you have an elegant yet sturdy, complex yet drinkable, bold yet forgiving nut brown that does everything i want it to and nothing i dont. when i consider that this bomber is widely available and costs between 6 and 7 dollars, i realize that if these types of brown are your jam, this is clearly your jelly. the only brown ale i really need for quite some time."

"Rich dark brown in color with great clarity. A thin layer of white foam rests on top. Brussels lacing. Luscious nutty aroma along the lines of hazelnut and caramel greets me. Delicious hazelnut dominates the dark malt flavor. The mouth is smooth and silky."
"I really enjoyed this beer. Great for the style and something I’d certainly have again."
""

"O - I love nut brown ales, and this is definitely an example why, extremely rich feeling without being high in ABV, good flavor, and excellent texture."
""
""
"I don't generally like brown ales but I made porcini mushroom risotto and someone recommended a brown ale with mushroom risotto so I got it. Great decision- complimented the earthy subtle mushroom flavors with a mild roasted malt flavor, crisp from the appropriate use of hops, and cleansing for the palate. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a darker brew that doesn't have too much of a flavor impact."
"Great tasting malt-centric brown ale. Somewhat surprising with a relatively light feel and color, but the head and the flavor really standout. Some hop bitterness lurks in the background, but overall, this is a fairly sweet and nutty brown ale that should please most fans of this style."
""
"Overall- Above average to mostly good beer. Good representation of the style and a lot more interesting than a lot of the American examples that I've had. I would recommend trying this."

"Alesmith's Nut Brown Ale is simply what Newcastle wants to be when it's all grown up."
"A solid brown ale that feels somewhat thicker than most. Sessionable for sure. Good, but not great."
""
""
""
"Enjoyable brown ale. A bit on the bitter side, but very smooth, creamy and sessionable with a great brown ale flavour profile. I really enjoyed this and at $4.99 a bomber, it's a solid purchase if you enjoy brown ales."
"Overall: A very solid take on a Brown Ale. Good toasty malt presence with good notes of chocolate, biscuit, and nuts."
""
"Medium bodied with low carbonation. Finishes dry. Smooth and easy to drink. A very nice example of an English Style Brown Ale."
""
"OVERALL: A solid, drinkable nutbrown that hits all the benchmarks of the style. Roasty, nutty, with hops upfront, and nutty flavors backing it up."
"22oz bottle. Brown color, decent head. Aroma is a bit of malt vinegar and malts. More malt vinegar in the flavor but this is what I usually get from nut brown ales, there is nothing wrong with this beer. In fact I might just have a fucked up palate. Overall this was just ok and while I am glad Alesmith came to CO I will be buying the IPA and extra pale and not this."
""
"O - Nice toasted tree nut flavor and a light, sessionable body."
""
""
""
""
"D - great example of the style."
""
""
"Overall a really enjoyable brown ale. I'm glad this brewer finally distributes in Colorado and look forward to trying more of their beers soon."
"O-This is a well-done brown. The smell, in particular, is really inviting and exhibits great intensity and balance. The taste doesn't quite live up to the smell, but it is close. Again, nice balance of malty flavors with just the right kick of hops. The feel is a bit odd and maybe a bit light, but it actually makes the beer more drinkable than other browns. A really nice session or almost-session beer at 5% ABV."

"Overall: an easy to quaff brown ale that is a bit hearty, along with a strong flavor profile. This beer was super fresh on tap and it really shines."
""
"All in all this a terrific nut brown ale that's got a low abv so it's great for sessioning. It's a good beer for cooler weather when a fruity hoppy beer is not what you really want. The balance is perfection as per usual with alesmith beers and this one grants enough sweetness to reward the palate and enough bitter to keep you wanting more."

"Bottle: Poured a clear deep brown color ale with a large light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of caramelized malt with nutty notes and light dry floral coffee notes. Taste is also dominated by nutty brown caramelized malt with nice light dry floral notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. A lot more complex then your standard brown ale while retaining some excellent drinkability."

"22oz bomber, pours mahogany in color as the bottle suggests, with a frothy, tan head, good retention and an explosion of lacing on the glass. Aromas include bready malt, toasted grain, brown sugar, and faint cocoa nibs.   Taste is sweet brown sugar, nutty toasted grain, bread crust, biscuity, earthy hops.  Super creamy mouthfeel, pleasant carbonation, definitely could drink a couple of these easily."

"A really too sweet beer for my liking."

"D - Nice brown ale. Great complexity and balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A very well crafted English brown ale. Great nut notes blend with more malts and just a faint earthy hop profile."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark hazed mahogany hue with a two finger head and clingy lacing everywhere,the smell is biscuit,roasted chestnuts,a hint of charr,mild chocolate and some dark coffee,the mouthfeel is just over light bodied with above moderate carbonation and on taste it has a real roasted nuttiness to it followed by subtle mild chocolate,dark coffee,earthy hops and finished with a slight fruity bitterness and overall it's quite enjoyable and I have to admit spot on to the English style you don't get many brews that claim it and pull it off but these guys do cheers."
"D - Easy drinking and enjoyable... Not a bad beer by any means... There's lot of good stuff going on here, especially the aroma... However, the flavor and mouthfeel could use a little more umph... With a couple of minor tweaks, this one could be elevated from very good to excellent..."
"O: This beer is incredibly drinkable yet still manages to pack in a ton of flavors of nutty malts. It is quite sessionable and also one of the best beers I have had in this style."
"Supremely drinkable, very English in flavor. Great Malt profile."
""
"Poured from tap into pint at papago in Scottsdale. Pours a nice brown with tan head and good lacing. Nice sweet nutty aroma. Taste is really nice...perfectly malty and nutty. Slight sweetness and nice balance with the slight hop. Overall a damn near perfect nut brown. Nice brew."
""
""
""
""
"Poured an excellent dark brown with off white head that looks ruby red when held up to a light. The scent was excellent, rich roasted malt, toffee, nutty notes and a bit of dark coffee were all present on the nose. Very enticing. The flavor delivered on this promise, beginning with a hit of roast malt, moving into toffee and roast malt, and finishing with rich nutty notes and a slight coffee like aftertaste. The mouthfeel was good, with a medium carbonation that made the beer quite easy to drink. The body was medium-light which contributed to this ease. An all around excellent brown ale, easily the best I've tried as of this date."

"A decent beer but it is a little dry and fizzy for the style. I don't mind it."
"Thanks Jay for picking this up downstate!"

"Great stuff, this. So glad I picked this one up, especially at the price (4 or 5.99 I think). Very tasty brown ale - well worth seeking out."

"A bottle from Let's Pour. Pours dark brown with large white head (admittedly overaggressive pour). Nutty malty smell, bit of darker fruits, but nothing to call home about...hoping the flavor offers more as there isn't a whole lot going on here. Nice chocolatey and nutty flavor. Very light and easy drinking, with a smoothness that creates some thickness. Ok brown ale, but would have liked a tad more bold flavor and aroma. They are there, but a bit light."

"Artfully crafted as Alesmith beers usually are. The malt choice is perfect for creating a beer that is delightfully complex in flavor and sessionable in body. So happy that this beer made it to bottles and it deserves a shot to make it into your fridge"
""
""
""
"When allowed to warm up to cellar temperature, this beer shines. Opening with a blend of caramel and toasted bread drizzled with burnt sugar and brown sugar, this is well-constructed. Flavors of vanilla and oatmeal are also present. Medium-low hop character is present, mostly as bitterness with a little flavor, with the earthy notes and green bitterness blending harmoniously with the burnt sugar bitterness and the toffee flavors. Drying on the finish with a faint fruit note, moderate toast and burnt sugar flavors, this beer is medium-light in body, moderately carbonated, and excellent on the palate - so soft and creamy! I imagine this is a treat on cask. Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"Overall I am so floored that this beer has made it to bottles as I have always wanted to sample this offering from AleSmith. I am really fond of a quality brown or amber ale but there are so few quality made ones these days because breweries just ""mail them in"" and focus on their next Imperial or Barrel-aged creation. This is a perfect food, session or anytime beer for its balanced flavor profile and extremely high drinkability. This may be the best American made English Brown ale I have ever had, if not, definitely in the top 3."

"O: this is a very nice nut brown, light refreshing and loaded with great flavor, very nicley done, I would recommend this brown ale to anyone."
"Overall: A very enjoyable sessionable nut brown. Not my favorite in the style, but it is up there. I will certainly pick this one up again. Makes for a great fall beer."

"One of the very best browns I've ever had. Poured at a good temperature with a nice, billowy, foamy, tan head that settled down after a bit to a light cover and a little lace. Color is a clear amber cherry with a couple of bubble trails. Aroma is malt, cocoa, old leather, tobacco. Flavor's slightly sweet, with a very good balance between that, bitter, and carbonic tang; also malt, cocoa, and a bit of roast. Body is just right, full, yet very drinkable and great carbonation. Finish is like flavor; session, and just plain very tasty stuff."
"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating but should be fairly fresh. Pours lightly hazy reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big caramel, biscuit, toffee, toast, nuttiness, chocolate, molasses, light dark fruit, and light herbal spiciness. Excellent aromas with great strength and balance. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, toffee, chocolate, light dark fruit, and light herbal. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, chocolate, and light herbal on the finish for a short bit. Nicely robust flavors with good balance; no cloying sweetness at all on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed on the finish; as expected of 5%. Overall this is an excellent brown ale. Nice robustness and balance of flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. All around great and well put together."
""
"Taste is nutty and sweet to start, a touch tart in the middle, and the grain flavors really come out, with a light bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Yet another good Alesmith brew."
""
"Overall, not that memorable for a brown ale unfortunately."
"More nutty than the smell indicates. Lots of chocolate initially on the tongue. Better hop presence on the swallow but it is still light, like a traditional brown ale. Aftertaste is not potent, but it lasts a long time. Richer than most brown ales which I typically find to be too thin."
"Overalls - real nice Brown; very drinkable; perfect fall evening companion; gone too soon..."
""
"Nut Brown Ale is an interesting beer from Alesmith. It’s not a big beer at all. But, it definitely lives up to the lofty standards Alesmith has set for itself. This is one tasty English Brown Ale. If you’re looking for something malty, delicious, and not too big – give this one a shot! It rocks!"
""
"O: A solid nut brown ale. This is a style I like (brown ales in general), especially during Octoberfest time. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of good ones that readily come to mind, and at the price I paid for this (I think it was $6.99 for the bomber, which would be a $20 sixer, ounce-for-ounce) I won't be coming back to it with any regularity. But it's definitely worth trying."
""
""
"Overall a nice beer, well done nut brown ale, one of the first beer styles I really liked when I first got into beer. It's hard to find a good nut brown beer these days, doesn't seem like anyone really makes it outside of England. It's a nice type of beer for cooler style weather, a rainy day, or when you need a nice malty beer without a big profile and sweetness. It's a well done nut brown too, so Cheers to Alesmith for continuing to makes some great beers and lesser made styles."
""
""
""
""
"O - Would get this again. Classic nut brown ale that is really smooth and enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall: this is probably my favorite English-style brown ale. Easily rivals Hazelnut Brown Nectar in the Brown Ale category, and is just generally delightful. I rarely come across a beer which so wonderfully represents its claimed style *and* is, simply, super-tasty to boot. There are almost certainly recipe tweaks which could make this beer better -- but I sure can't tell you what they are."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a a dark mahogany amber. A fine one finger light tan head with great retention and lacing. Aroma of toasted malt, nuts and a hint of chocolate. Flavor follows with nuts, toasted and caramel malt, slightly sweet. Finishes with nuts and a hint of char. Medium bodied with some creaminess. A very nice nut brown ale. I'm glad that Alesmith has made it up to Seattle."
""
"Pours a dark brownish amber color with a taupe colored head. Nutty, earthy, chocolaty, and grassy aromas comprise the bouquet. The mouthfeel wasn't as full and creamy as the nose had led my palate to anticipate. It is a little thin and on the watery side. The flavor was even more of a disappointment. Some nuttiness, but nothing extraordinary. Some lactose and coffee acidity. Plus, this beer seems to drink more like a stout than a brown. Pretty unremarkable. Not a good effort by Alesmith."
""
"O: Great English brown ale. Relatively light but oh so creamy and smooth makes it super drinkable. Great balance of flavors. This might vie for the throne that is Samuel Smith Nut Brown."
""
""
""
""
"Exceedingly drinkable. Just the right amount of nutty/toasted aftertaste. Nice."
""
""
""
""
"O/D-Yessir. I have begun to really enjoy Brown Ales. This one is excellent. Mild yet complex. Long finish. Plenty of different flavor components. I could drink this and be thoroughly satisfied most days of the week. Alesmith is one of those breweries that does no wrong with me."
"Wanted to love this one, but I guess my memory was kind. I have had much better brown ales, though it's important to stress that this one is not at all bad, just a well-done example that sticks to the middle of the road."
""
""
"O- A really nice brown ale, nut flavors are done very well, super drinkable stuff."
""
""
"DOA"
"This is a good beer. Nut Brown is an excellent American take on an English brown ale. It gives a pleasant spin to the style without overly challenging the palate and still packing each sip and whiff with flavor. This probably isn't a beer that will ever be part of a fad or have legions of fans, and that's understandable. However, it is exactly the sort of beer that one could happily drink day in and day out."

"O: A lighter beer, very easy to drink, and versatile to pair with a range of entrees and desserts."
"The bottled version is new, having been introduced May 30, 2012 according to the brewery. It is listed at 5.0% ABV on the usual printed-on-the-glass type of label that AleSmith uses. NUT BROWN in giant letters. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"A terrific brown."
""
""
"O - Solid brown ale, with a very nice roast characteristic without having that roast bitterness, letting the hops come through nicely."
""
""
""
"Dark brown, thin cap of off0white head, some sticky rings. Toasted nuts, dark caramel, roasted coffee and toasted bread. Taste is quite malty, notes of dark caramel, toasted and roasted nuts and grain level off the sweetness, some coffee ground and cocoa notes. Medium bodied, slightly mouth coating, prefect carbonation level. Kept thinking of Dogfish Indian Brown the entire time and needed to remind myself of the disparity in ABVs. While not quite as complex, still full flavored. A very good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is even bodied, den drinking, and outright delicious in the swallow."
"O-a tasty brown ale with a nice balance of flavors, could drink a few pints of this"
"Overall: I'm not a huge brown ale fan but this one could get me to change my opinion. Too many brown ales lack the body that I like in a beer. This isn't the case here. Big, bold flavors. A very well done take on the style."
"Nautical Nut Brown Ale has a dark brown body that does not quite make it to black. A small dark tan head stuck around for a few minutes before capping, leaving some sticky lace. The smell consists of dark roasted malts, brown sugar and some old coffee. The taste is huge on the malts with alot of nuttiness. Some coffee with a nice amount of hops to round it out. The English yeast strain jumps out here and there making this even more layered The feel was just about as full as needed to be. A bit chewy towards the end which expanded the feels depth. The carb was pretty spot on as wel. I enjoyed my glass and drank it in no time. Im not a big fan of nutty brown ales but I could easily drink some more of this. Full of flavor and life.."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a khaki head that settles to an oily film. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and some nutty aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, toasted nuts, and slight coffee on the finish. A nice mild roasty bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good brown ale with an awesome flavor to it."
"Dr: Drinkable but underwhelming - especially for the brewery. I wouldn't get it again if other Alesmith beers were available. Brown ale fans will be satisfied."
""
""
""
""
"on tap at Stone Bistro. A very good brown, rich and malty. Rather very good for the style. Nutty flavourfull, chocolate malt. Smooth middling mouthfeel, good drinkability when you are up for a sessionable beer that is not ultra-hoppy. It all helps to have understated carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"T: Lots of nutty malts, some day old coffee grounds, hazelnut and roasted malt. Something about the taste told me this beer was old. It seemed faded and I remember liking it a lot more the last time I tried it. I'll have to revisit this one."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I really like this beer I might be a bit tough in the grading of this one but it is an enjoyable beer"
""
"rich brown in color with a huge tan head that stayed on top forever! Seriously this had to have looked better then damn near anything else I have run across recently, no joke. Just perfect. Aroma is dark fruits, lots of sweet brown sugary notes, hints of clove and light earthy hops, all mixing together nearly perfectly at this point in time. Nice smooth, even carbonation and feel here now as well, really well placed I have to admit. Rich warm flavor here, nice mix of pear, light spice, hints at brown sugar and a nice even caramel flavored dry finish"
"Solid nut brown with everything you pretty much expect in a brown ale. Not too rich but not thin, drinkable and refreshing."
"Drink- It wasn't the best Brown Ale but still pretty good. A bit watery and just a bit small. I'd like to give this another go with a full pint to see how it changes with temp."
"O: Highly drinkable brown. Sessionability super high. Red berry flavors do the nuts justice. Sweet cranberry flavors up the ease of drinking. Not a typical brown, but good."
"On draft. Pours a reddish brown with a small light tan head that has good retention and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a good almond nuttiness, some caramel, light brown sugar, some light peanut, and some light coffee. The initial taste is sweet with caramel, some brown sugar, then a strong almond nuttiness. The finish has a light coffee bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation."
"Personally I would prefer something with more hop factor but really done to perfection by AleSmith. I could drink this brew anytime."
"Overall - With this full rich flavored and light body beer I could drink this year round."
"Tastes are cashews, almonds, brown malt, an ESB mixed with some rye, caramel, trail mix and peanuts. Smells like a good time at the pub with all your friends buying beer right there with you. I like this one because it's a good Brown from a great brewing company."
"D/O: This English-style brown ale by Alesmith is exactly what one would hope for in such a beer, with an excellent and full flavor profile but no misplaced attempt to re-invent or modify the style. Nutty malts are showcased here, and are so satisfying to the palate. Acidity is careful to stay hidden, never felt or tasted in a distracting way. The smell seems a bit anemic, compared to the taste, imitating it without really advertising effectively. The reality of brown ales--especially those produced in brewpubs--is often a let-down, so this contribution from Alesmith is much-needed to shore up the reputation of the style. Anyone that enjoys a porter of average abv would find this beer satisfying."
"Nice feel, perhaps a bit dry from the roasted influence, and lacking the brightness of a Samuel Smith, yet solid nonetheless. Pleasant carbonation and well balanced, somewhat dry and smoky for the style."
"For the mild beer drinker, you may be scared off by the look of Nautical Nut Brown. It's very dark. However, it's not thick, it's not too rich, it's just right and has a lot of flavor for a brown ale. If you dislike porters or maybe even stouts, don't be afraid to try this... it's not too powerful."
"Overall - Compare to New Belgium Fat Tire, with more mouthfeel and highlighting individual flavors. A good afternoon beer; light enough to not be overwhelming, heavy enough to taste and enjoy the flavors."
"Overall, I would call this a session ale. Admit, it is above 4%, but by american expecations and standards, it has the ease of going down smooth, the low ABV to easily have more than one, and a complexity that is delicious."
"D: Very drinkable on a cool southern California evening."
"This is a great brown brew and cant wait to try it from a bottle!"
"D: it drank very good and went pretty damn good paired with some cajun style gumbo. This is a great offering from alesmith and I hope one day I will see it in a bottle."
"Carbonation is just right for a strong, medium bodied brew. I could gladly drink a few of these."
"D: Nicely balanced, goes down easily, not very filling. I do enjoy a good brown ale, and this is definitely one that is worth sitting with all night."
"D: Very drinkable tasty session brown."
"D - Overall its a good everyday sort of brown ale nothing mind blowing just a good beer thats worth picking up sometime to try"
"On tap at Stone. Appears dark brown with a frothy beige head. The aroma is of toasted malt with a decided nuttiness and a restrained yet elegant sweetness. The flavor portrays a light sweetness with a moderate toasted nut and a toasted malt presence. There's a light earthy hop presence and bitterness. The full flavor belies the modest ABV. A truly great beer, especially when considering the low ABV. Perfect for one of the two allowable drinking periods in England that were imposed on shell production workers during World War I."
"This is one of those draft-only Alesmith releases that I always seem to pass up on visits to San Diego but I'm really glad that I decided to give it a shot this time around. While not overly complex, this had a full richness of flavor to it that really made this a pleasant quaff. Nicely done"
"D: I'm not always the biggest fan of brown ales as they tend to be a bit sweet, but this had a nice combination of nutty and toasted flavors that I found inviting."
"They took their time when they crafted this beer. Maltiness and roast are spot on. I can't tell you how many people I've switched from Newcastle to Nautical. If I'm in a joint for the first time and I see this on tap I know that I'm safe. I may look for others that I haven't tried first but I know that I can always have a nautical and be completely satisfied. Not much carbonation and very smooth. The nutty smoothness is a little dangerous because you can drink a lot of these. Toasty smell and lingering malt are exactly what I look for in brown ale and this brew always exceeds my needs. An absolute staple at my bar."
"I was glad to try this tap only offering that never makes it up north. It is a well crafted brown ale."
"Deep brown with a thin tan cap. Good head retention and there was a bit of spotty lace that clung to the glass. Malty aroma, chocolate and slight roast, a bit nutty. Solid bitterness without being out of balance, chocolate and cocoa with mild roasted grains. There was a lingering citrus bitterness as well. Medium to light bodied with a smooth, creamy texture and a little bit of dry astringency. A great lighter beer. It's got lots of flavour, but is still very approachable."
"Draught at Fathers Office. Dark brown with a medium beige head. Toasted bread, light roast, coffee, and light spicy hop aromas. The flavor has light toffee and sweet caramel with coffee and light burnt/roasted flavors and some dark chocolate. Medium-light body with overly fizzy carbonation. The flavor profile is spot on, but the malt could be a little more substantial and the carbonation was too high."
"Overall this is one of the better brown ales I recall having. A solid brown that doesn't try and overpower the subtle flavors. Certainly worth a shot."
"For the record - I am not 100% certain that I understand what is meant by ""average"" here. For a brown ale is that Newcastle? Sam Smith? Downtown brown? or is this average in overall beers?"
"With it's low ABV I could drink this all night!"
"For the record, I am a devout Alesmith fan (Tod, keep it up, I blame the distro!), I love your work."
"Poured like milk from a Growler (The only way to get head from a growler) it produces on fingers worth of head, this beer separates the light into three darker ambers like an out of focus monochrome Abstract. Beatifull or maybe I've allready had too much! It's smell is like fire roasted nuts and a slight maltiness. Taste is similar to a smoked porter but lighter and there are definitely some nuts in there somewhere I just can't get to them. Light Carbonation and very dry this beer is very drinkable and I am sessionning it to my wifes dismay! Gotta love the Alesmilth guys and gals!!"
"Poured a clear medium brown color with a small white head. Nose is nuts, malts and caramel. Taste is so smooth, caramel, maybe some syrup and nuts. A slight cocoa, roastiness on the end with caramel, maple syrup and more nuts. A very good Nut Brown! Not my favorite style but I could drink this beer all day long at 4.6 ABV!"
"D: Not my favorite style but pretty tasty."
"Good drinkability overall. Average abv for a brown ale, not too heavy on the palate and not too bitter either. I think I still prefer Newcastle over this one, but I wouldn't pass up on the opportunity for a little more Nautical Brown Ale!"
"Went to AleSmith today to fill my growler. Tasted a few and the Nautical was my last (maybe could have weakened my palate a bit). I wasn't too impressed with the brown and usually, browns I dig. Nice color, smelled better than tasted. It did have some good nutty flavors and a mild hoppy finish, but that is what AleSmith strives for. Was hoping that it tasted as good as my olfactory sensed, but fell a little short. I would have it again but not in the top ranks of browns I love."
"Tap @ O'Brien's. Pours clear brown with a short-lived off-white head. Aroma of nuts and caramel. More nuts in the taste; almonds, hazelnuts, peanuts. Nice blend of caramel and cocoa and a slightly smoky finish. I'm still not a huge fan of brown ale, but this was very good."
"Good complex brew."
"D: I could drink this all day, if not all year. Count it."
"had this bad boy on tap at the yard house in brea. arrived with a minimal head. nice dark brown with auburn highlights. the beer was poured way to cold (which the yard house is infamous for doing) so initial smell and taste are dulled. upon letting the beer warm I am greeted by a nice array of nutty smells and malts. the taste is smooth and complex. I get hints of roasted hazelnuts a bit of brown sugar and sweet malts. mothfeel is nice. decent amount of carbonation. very easy drink. I am not surprised tht alesmith of all people would put out a beer like this."
"Pours a clear brownish orange, coppery in the light, thin tan head forms, settles to a ring, some chunks of lace on the glass. Smell is quite nutty and toasty, some caramel, biscuits, grain, light floral, not much going on, kind of subdued. Taste is similar, nuts and toast, light fruits, biscuits and bread, caramel, bit of floral hopping, not much again. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth and easy enough to drink but not for exciting, even for a nut brown. Try it if you see it, but it didn't do much for me."
"On tap at Stone World Brewing Bistro and Gardens. Pours dark brown, almost opaque, with a nice thin tan head. Aroma is roasted nuts/malt. Flavor begins sweet and then becomes roasty and carmelly sweet. Flavors of crisp malt and cocoa dominate the palate. By far the best Brown ale out there."
"This beer arrived a dark leatherly brown with shimmering hues of ruby red. The aroma is sweet, lots of toffee and some butterscotch. The taste is more of the same. Sweet upfront, then the toffee and butterscotch comes on in while a minor note of hops plays second fiddle. Unlike a number of American-made brown ales, this one hs an excellent balance between the malt and the hops. Just plain easy to drink, and I wish they bottled this brew."
"Had on-cask at Hamilton's. Brown like you would expect, with no head. Smells faintly of malt, caramel, and nuts. Taste is all about caramel and nuts. Excellent flavors. Mouthfeel is wonderful and creamy. This beer seems to really benefit from being served from a cask, as I've also had it on-tap and it wasn't quite as good. The other great aspect of this beer is the drinkability factor. It's low in alcohol and goes down incredibly easy. Definitely something you could drink all night."
"Good, but I'm still not a brown ale believer."
"If I only had one beer to drink for the rest of my life, this would fit the bill nicely."
"D- At under 5%abv, this is a standout brown session ale that is smooth and delicious, I recently drank about 6 pints over the course of a few hours at a local lounge and was feeling fine all night long, this is one of only two ""core"" styles that Alesmith doesn't bottle, but I look forward to drinking it whenever I stumble upon it at fine SD bars and eateries"
"Rich, creamy and full bodied for 4.8%"
"Would definitely try again, also saw this at the Tap Room in San Diego, i love that place just in case you were wondering"
"A little light on body but not distractingly so. A great tasting beer that you can go through several pints of."
"D: A great sessionable ale, a great choice on-tap by Alesmith, if you can find it, and want a lighter, but still full-flavored beer."
"A very solid, refreshing, and enjoyable beer. Highly recommended; I look forward to getting it again."
"Drinkability: This is extremely sessionable stuff; it's full-flavored but light on the alcohol, and not so one-dimensional that it would get boring very quickly."
"D- easy drinking, completely sessionable, delicious, best english brown i've had. recommended"
"Originally reviewed November 26, 2006. On tap at AleSmith. Liquour-like Frangelico-type aroma, with wafting alcohol notes on a tone of nutty toast and malt. Dry. Heavy brown pour, with a nice creamy froth. A light and refreshing taste, however bold with quality hazlenut and tawny pale fruits to combine for a nice quality in a brown ale. Touches of saltiness in the nutty character. Both drinkable and full of distinction, yet having nice balance. Something that makes this top considering the quality of the body."
"Drinkability: I guzzled this down, and would gladly choose this if I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life."
"Overall: I really like this beer. It is easy to drink with the low alcohol. I wish it was more available. It is a winner."
"drinkability: was quite high, but i was a warm day. A decent brown."
"D: Good. I would have liked to get a growler of this for further review...but when presented with all the other options at Alesmith I couldn't bring myself to get the brown."
"As far as a Nut Brown style, this is a hard one to beat, tasty stuff...cheers!"
"Caught Alesmith's Nut Brown on-tap at O'Brien's down in San Diego. It had a nice brown look and a solid head. Nothing in the scent department jumped out at me, but it had a nice nutty but not overwhelming taste. It's got a pretty long lingering aftertaste though that didn't agree with me. I could down a few of these in a sitting if there was nothing else I wanted to try."
"On draught @ Alesmith Brewing Company. Medium Brown, with a large head of very light tan. A great brown ale overall with a lovely aroma showing hints of toasty, roasty and caramel malts and a zesty, hearty, rich and meaty malt accented flavor. Tasty."
"Tasted this brown ale at the Alesmith Brewery while visiting San Diego area. This brew was, very dark brown when poured with a fair amount of tan foam and loads of lace. The smell of roasted malts was very evident with a mild aroma of hops and just a hint chocolate. The smell and aroma is just what I got. Nice smooth feeling on the palate. What a mellow brown ale. Well balanced, with a rich, creamy feel in the mouth and on the palate."
"I could have sworn this was a porter. lots of burnt smell. coffee. dark brown appearance yet light on the palate. I didn't encounter the nuttiness I desired with this style. It was there but hidden deep in the brew. I hate to compare but the samuel smith variety stomps all over this in my opinion as it shares the nuttiness and has a high drinkability along with refreshing. The alesmith brewery is outstanding and this beer is recomended as it stretches the edge of a style. I liked the fluid body as it easily slid down to paydirt. I was so sure it was a porter I had the barkeep pour me a shot glass of it while I watched and sampled it....Yep..it was the right brew. Still good."
"Taste is understated, simple, and perfect for the beer. Dancing the line between dry, sour malt and rich chocolate, this beer is smooth and doesn't have a single off taste. There's a nice chocolate nuttiness without being excessive, and it has a dry finish. Hops are unnoticable in this beer, which I suppose is true to style, though they never hurt."
"The best nut brown I've had since Samuel Smith. The apperance was great with a dark chocolate brown color and slightly off white head. The smell was great with a smell of nutella and malt. The flavor was very smoothe and refreshing with a great blend of nuttiness, malts and just a slight hint of hops in the finnish. A excelent brown and extremly drinkable!"
"This beer rests in my glass with a thick tan head and a bright brown color. This beer has a subtle nutty aroma to it. There is a nice caramel malt sweetness here that is backed up by toasted malt flavors and a nuttiness that is found in the finish. This beer is packed with solid malt flavors that just jump out of my glass. This is one of the best Nut Brown ales that I have ever had, probably is the best. It is just so enjoyable and so well integrated."
"The beer as it spills for the keg into the appropriate container a transparent brown, the head prodigious in size and the texture spumous, the color a toothsome tan with the lace a thick and sticky sheet to obscure the glass. Nose is slightly floral, nice nutty malt sweetness, fresh and crisp with the start somewhat sweet, thickly malted and the top fair to middling in feel. Finish has a nice moderate carbonation and the hops pleasingly spicy as the beer warms to the room and the glass, quite dry and a decent drinking beer, certainly not the worst Brown Ale Ive tasted, but do like most all the other Alesmith beers better than this one, still worth a sample."
"Whilst not as memorable as some of the other Alesmith offerings, this is nevertheless a very good Brown Ale that has exceptional Drinkability. An excellent Nut Brown Ale."
"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is nutty and slightly sweet. A medium bodied nut brown ale. Malts are nutty and slightly sweet. Hops are slightly spicy. Well balanced. Smooth full flavor. Very nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
