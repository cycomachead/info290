"AT: Dark Chocolate and Coffee at the end."

"3/10/15 Draft (The Laughing Man DC) - Very dark pour, nice tan head. Nice malt aroma with a hint of caramel. Strong harsh taste, chocolate toffee flavor taste. Liked this a lot. Texture decent carbonation, nice finish and decent kick. Very good beer."

"Excellent overall brew with great finish"
"Nice stout the toffee finish really stands out"
""
""
""
""
"Very average  but easy to put down."
"F: Has a good mouth feel, a good body."
""
"A very solid brown ale. I like the nutty flavor. Good blend and surprisingly sessionablle"
""
""
""
""
"Dark Brown ale, carmelized malts that have flavor profiles of chocolate w/ over toasted nuts"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Great flavor, Taste similar to an espresso. Smooth as well"
""
"A really delightful brown ale trending toward a stout for my palate.  Excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
"My first time with this bier. Wasn't sure about it but was suprised at the smoothness and taste. Would recommend."
""
""
""
"I had it. I liked it. I didn’t think it was over 6% alcohol. In fact this was my present from my fiance when she went to NOLA for a bachlorette party. Does this mean she got into trouble and is trying to make me forget about it by bringing me beer?"
""
""
""
""
""
"Love this one. Has some chocolate and coffee taste. Super drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A fine, chewy brown ale. Toffee and molasses notes in here, along with some dried fruit. The body is fairly smooth, medium and creamy. Dry on the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Man, this is one tasty beer!  I like this!"
"I'm not a huge fan of this style but liked this beer - problem for me was the vanilla porter I had right before this so my palate was a little off."
""
"Overall, one of the better brown ales I've had.  I'm not usually a big fan of the style, but I'd happily have another one of these."
"Great dark ale.  Smooth and tasty"
""
""
""
""
"I just had this beer for the first time and it is amazing!  I have had Abita beers before and have liked them fine but this...this is something special.  My favorite beer of all time is Alaskan Amber so, this isn't a huge derivation. Still, where can I find a keg of this?"
""
""
"Nice dark beer! Not too bitter . Kinda heavy!"
"It's a dark ale with a good strong taste.  It doesn't have an overpowering flavor, and it's not too heavy.  Coming out of the tap, this was indeed an excellent beer, but coming out of the bottle it just isn't the same.  In fact, I don't intend to waste my time getting bottles of this.  There's only so much time in life for beer drinking, and, while this is okay, it's just not as super fantastic as it was from the tap.  Whenever I go back to that place, I always get this though."
""
"Very smooth, great hops. Could have a heavier body"

"Still a favorite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I'm not a huge fan of brown ales, that being said turbo dog is a huge exception. It reminds me less of a brown ale and more of a porter without being too heavy and full bodied. 10/10 would drink again."

"This is the best beer I have ever had. I heard great things about Turbodog, and went to my local market, which has a ""Build your own 6-pack"" thing for 9.99. I got a Turbodog, Purple Haze, couple Shock Tops, and a Cherry Chocolate beer. I refridgerated my Turbodog and angle/straight poured it into a 20 oz. mug. The head is incredible! Super retention, very foamy, bit of lacing. The smell was great, hints of chocolate malt, no cloying, bit of sweetness. It pours a very dark brown. I drank the first gulp...heaven. No over the top alcohol taste, despite it having a higher ABV than most beers. I felt no biting carbonation and the sweetness was not overpowering. I recommend Turbodog to everyone. A+!"

""

""

"O - solid English Ale, really balanced balanced malt and hops and an interesting aroma like red wine which i find really nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Easy to drink and very pleasant."

"Poured out a deep, clear brown with a nice ruby tint. The head is foamy and settles in at about one fingers worth, light tan in color and leaves some nice soapy lacing. The aroma is pretty average, with only slight, nondescript malt sweetness. The taste is much more robust, with nice nutty notes and additions of caramel. There's a bit of carbonation on the mouthfeel, but it has an overall smooth mouthfeel and finish. A solid brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good rendition of an English brown ale – meets all the criteria. I didn’t care for it when I first had it in 2006 and I still don’t – not my cup of tea."
""
"I'm not sure what happened to this beer, but 10-15 years ago it was excellent. The stuff they call TurboDog now just does not taste the same. This was the beer that put Abita on the map, but now I find it undrinkable and lacking in the malty complexity it once held."
""
""
""
""
"The Abita Turbo Dog was ok, it was not that bad. The taste was ok, and the smell was not too bad. This beer was not my favorite beer, but it was ok. The smell was ok as well. It was not my favorite beer, but it was worth trying. I am not one hundred percent sure of how it tasted because it has been a while since I tried this beer. But I am willing to try it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O. Not a bad beer, but there are better examples of the brown ale style. Seems a little too burnt."
""
""
""
""
""
"I wouldn't turn this down at a party (unless there were other options), but can't see buying one of these (mine was a gift)."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a deep dark brown which is almost black in color actually, that has a good half-finger beige head with decent lacing when sipped. The aroma is of sweet roasted malts for the most part. The taste has more going on with roasted malts, hint of chocolate, toffee and coffee in the mix. A slight tart finish which is nice. Perfect carbonation makes this good brew more enjoyable. A tasty brew! I had a few other styles of brew from this brewery and all have been good!"
""
""
""
""
"Kept seeing this at my fav bottle shop decided to go ahead and give it a go.I had higher expectations for this brew.It is very malty and if anything would go well with a good ol fashioned BBQ dinner.Maybe even make a good marinade with the rest of the six pack I bought.Not putting it down,just had hoped it would live up to the hype I have experienced and price was a little on the high side.Not the best review I know but was not passionate enough to do it."
"Overall: Roasty, hefty, bitter & sweet. Not an English brown ale at all, but too light to be a porter. This is really versatile; good on its own, great with food. Just a little too dark for the season (early summer). I look forward to returning to this in the fall. Pretty much spot on for American dark brown ale. The closest thing I have mind to compare this to is Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald, but less roasty or bitter than GLEF, and much sweeter."
"O: not very complex, but enjoyable to drink;"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Pretty standard brown ale. Nothing spectacular here, but decent."
""
""
""

"A decent beer. Lots of malt but the balance seems to be a little out for my taste."

""
"Overall- I enjoyed this brew. The flavor was good but it could have stranded out a little bit more, very drinkable tho. I would have this again."

"Turbo dog is a good beer with no real defects that I can see, its just an average but good beer."

"Overall, it is an great and balanced beer. Smell is nice and clean, mouthfeel is appropriately carbonated and adequately full. Not too sweet, bitter, or dark, but a good balance of all three. Fairly easy drinking and refreshing. Got a growler full of it."

""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""

"O: So far my favorite Abita. Low ABL % so it's kinda like a dark sweet session beer. Nice change up if you are getting hopped out. While there are better representations of this style this beer is typically a great value pick."
""
""
""
""
"I've had Pecan Harvest from Abita and thought it was decent, and I feel the same about this beer... it's a decent brew that is interesting enough to warrant maybe drinking a couple of, but that's about it. There's a nice caramel/chocolate/roast combination going on with a fairly high carbonation that makes Turbodog an easy drinker, but nothing made me too excited about it. I must say I'm shocked ""the Bros."" gave this a 90 rating, because it's almost the very definition of an average beer to my taste buds... hey, different strokes. I'd have it again if offered, but probably wouldn't buy it again. A pretty average brown ale that's not all-too satisfying. But hey, the price is right."
""
""
""
"Brown bottoms up!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours out dark as night and certainly darker that I would expect a brown ale to be. Has a nice brown two finger head and that's being conservative. Definitely some nice lacing here too. Smell is much more like a brown ale with some nice mellow malts, a little sweetness, and a tiny smell of hops but no bitterness. This is more malt forward too be sure on the nose. Taste is quite malty as in the nose with the sweetness I found in the nose but really nothing I can taste from the hop bill. This is just your basic brown ale. Mouthfeel is actually quite thick or more so than I expected. Overall this is an OK beer. I'm not a huge fan of brown ales so to be honest I might not be the best to rate this beer but it's not a bad beer, it's just not anything overwhelming in taste, smell, etc. Not a bad beer but nothing I would buy again. However this is close to style but just not anything special."

"The feel is good, though the medium body goes somewhat thin at times and, while crisp later, it starts off just fizzy. It does smooth out, and it goes semi-dry from beginning to finish."

"I picked up a 6 pack of 12 oz bottles from my local grocery store and they are clearly marked with a freshness date. From the bottle to a pint glass out pours a dark brown ale with a mahogany hue. Swirling the tan head around the glass reveals a thin sticky lacing. A good inhale detects notes of a dark crystal malt in a brew of caramel, chocolate, dark fruits (kiwi, fig, prune or plum?) and a hops spice. The taste has a rich mouthfeel with a medium body. Dark-sticky-sweet malty caramel and chocolate flavors are dominant, with a light crisp hops bitterness that cleanses the pallet. To profile this English brown ale, it's not far off from today's stouts and porters, very similar to a Full Sail Session Black without the liquorice or a distant relative of Samuel Smith Nut Brown Ale, one that lives just down the road."

"I had this quite a few times years back when I was in Texas, so when I saw it on the shelf today I just had to grab one. Pours a crystal clear dark brown with bodacious ruby highlights and a huge crop of fluffy tan head. Aromas of chocolate and caramel with a hint of earth and toffee. The flavor is a bit fruity with English yeasty esters dominating. Caramel toffee and chocolate maltiness off set with a hint of earthy hop flavor. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a sweet slick creamy bubbly mouthfeel. I was worried that my palette may have changed in all these years, but this is actually a pretty good English style ale."
""
""
"Overall: Can't believe I hadn't tried this to date as it is a ""classic"" American craft beer in the minds of many. This is a good brown ale worth trying, and honestly one of Abita's better offerings."
""
"It's an excellent beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid brown ale. Light and crisp enough to enjoy more than one at a time but certainly not lacking in complex flavor."
""
""
"O: A solid english brown that doesn't get boring after a few pints."
""
""
""
""
""
"M - very creamy and smooth. Nice on the tongue."
""

"O- Not one of the best brown ales out there but it's a good session beer if you're craving something darker."

"Had this with a very spicy pizza, a 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. A very dark almost opaque color with mild carbonation. A decent head that did not last very long but very nice lacing. I noted more toffee than chocolate notes in aroma and taste. Also a noticeable roasted malt flavor. This is a good malty ale right in line with other stouts and porters. I would buy it again."

""

"Overall, a nicely-constructed brown ale that achieves a nice balance between sweet and bitter. I feel it could use a bit more malt flavor up front, but it's not bad at all."
""

""
""
""

""
""

"Dark almost opaque color with mild carbonation and decent head. Toffee and chocolate notes in aroma. Very carbonated with a noticeable roasted flavor. Perhaps carbonated too much. Not much depth or complexity but it is an ale. Chocolate malt notes also. In summary, a malty ale. It's flavors would be better suited to a stout or porter."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a good solid brown ale. nice balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Very balanced brown ale, not sweet with pleasant coffee notes. Good exemplar of its style."
""

"It's a pretty average brown ale. Nothing too out of the ordinary or unexpected but is definitely pleasant and sessionable."

" Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
"Pours a chocolate brown with two fingers of head that dissipated quickly. Toffee notes are present in the nose. The upfront flavor is bready and malty with a mildy bitter finish. This offering is enjoyable, but only above average as English Browns go."

"O: A unique hybrid between an amber and brown ale, having disticnt flavor characteristics from both. Clearly a popular beer which fills a nice niche and is available nation wide, a solid offering from Abita."

"O - Not terrible, but the flavors don't quite mesh. And the metallic taste is a definite turnoff. Oddly, this beer paired very well with chocolate covered marshmallow easter candy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall it's a really good beer. Some of the flavors aren't as pronounced as they smell, and roasted bitterness dominates overall. It might even be a bit too bitter, but it is a tasty mellow beer. It's not something I'd rave about, but I would like to drink it again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured dark brown with a thick creamy mocha head. Aroma of caramel, chocolate with a hint of vanilla. The flavor is of unsweetened dark chocolate and coffee, not very hoppy which is a plus, not real complex but a good flavor none the less. To me this is a good solid dark beer, but nothing really stands out to put it in the superior category."
""
""
""
"Overall: a deep but not overly complex brew. The hops are understated in the presence of the rich coffee flavor."
""
"O - A good brew from Abita, that I used to think more of, but after revisiting it a few times, its not as great as i once thought it was, still for the price, its a good choice."
""
"I really like this beer. Definitely a go to beer for a fall or winter day."
"O -- Based on guidelines, this beer straddles Northern & Southern English Brown characteristics -- and the drinker is the winner. A very smooth, mellow, yet robust beer. Great balance of sweet and roasted malts. If you crave a Brown and this is available, give it a go."
""
""
""
"Overall - not a bad beer, worth a try. but pretty average brown ale in my opinion"

""

"Thoroughly enjoyed this beer. I tasted like all the things I enjoy about IPA's without the crazy bitterness. The taste had hints of chocolate and toffee which makes it ideal for a dessert beer. I'll probably buy a six pack of this to enjoy after meals in the very near future."

"Aromas of chocolatey malt with some nuttiness. Some sweet molasses as well. Taste is moderately toffee sweet, fairly dry in the finish with just the slightish bit of astringency. Medium/light bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall this one is easy to drink with somewhat simple but nice flavor."

"A better Newcastle, gave this to a friend that was a big Newcastle fan, and now he has switched to this."

"O: A decent brown ale that is easy drinking. Hops are nice and the blend was well done. Overall a nice drinkable beer that would be a great weekend beer to run through."
""
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours slightly hazy dark reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, chocolate, light roast, light nuttiness, herbal, and slight raisin. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malts. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, light nuttiness, roast, herbal, and slight raisin. No bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, chocolate, light nuttiness, and brown sugar on the finish for a short bit. Very nice malt flavor balance that is fairly robust, with good complexity; and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very good brown ale. Nice balance and robustness of malt flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
"O- great balance and extremely drinkable. Nothing is overbearing which makes it highly sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"chestnut colored, decent maltiness but just a rather bland beer. Very little going on here. Nothing offensive, just boring. Like many other Abita beers, it's the standard run of the mill beer that doesn't offend, yet there's nothing spectacular about it."
"I wouldn't call it complex, but this beer has a lot to offer. Great sessionable English-style ale. Chocolate and toffee make an intriguing combo; not exactly used to it. An enjoyably easy twelve-ouncer to slam back between other beers."
""

"o - Overall a decent brown ale. Sweet and some nice fruit to it, and easy to drink. Nothing mind blowing but could revisit at a bar with not a lot of craft options."
""

""
""
"I poured this beer from the bottle, noticing a deep, almost opaque reddish-brown color and a modest beige head that settles to a thin film of foam, but I left the room for a minute right after pouring. When I returned, I was welcomed back to my seat by a wave of rich, caramel sweetness. Unfortunately, the wonderful sweetness somehow seemed to evaporate with the head, and my first deliberate smell of the beer yielded nothing but dull combination of mild lactose-like sweetness, some musty hops, and an afternote of dry cocoa. The flavor is marginally better but still sadly bland, with a light, sweet blend of milk chocolate and a mildest noticeable toffee character, although each characteristic seems to develop nicely as the beer warms. The texture is good enough, with a nice medium body that is lightened by a fine carbonation. Overall, although certainly drinkable, the superficial flavor profile leaves much to be desired."

"Pours a mostly clear dark brown with two fingers thick tan colored head, settles to a quarter inch, leaving a spray of lace behind. Smell: not much going on. Mild herbal and earthy hopping, mild nuttiness and bakers' chocolate. Not unpleasant, just not enough there. Taste: somewhat nutty and tannic (pecan seems closest), toffee, into an earthy and very slightly citric hopping with some vague fruitiness, then a fleeting hit of dark chocolate towards the finish. Body is light, feel is cottony, slick, and not terribly pleasant. At the end of the sip the pale malt base is almost the only thing left, which is disappointing, as there are some decent things going on here. Best by 3/13."
"A good brew. Nothing special but definitely drinkable. Somewhat one dimensional."
""
"O: The ultimate in inoffensive beer. There's nothing bad or good here - really, it just exists in the market place like white bread exists in a grocery store. And money no object, would you rather have white bread or the artisanal 9-grain stuff? Thought so."
""
""
"Overall - All in all, a boring beer. Nothing stands out here, nothing to really write about. Just a standard brown beer, bland. I wouldn't necessarily buy again. I would drink it though, for free."

"Overall: This is a very drinkable brown ale that is smooth and balanced on all fronts. It doesn't grab your palate and brutalize it. It just allows you to experience and have a good time."

"This beer is the perfect dessert beer - creamy, yet light. I ate a slice of pound cake while I sipped this beer, and found myself smiling, right up ‘til the last drop!"

"Overall, I found it was a good beer. I didn't find it mind blowing by any standard, but it was a solid dark Ale. Would buy again, but I don't think i would drive out of my way to get it."

"This is pretty good. Had it in a stein, poured from a bottle. The initial appearance is very, very dark - almost opaque with a red tint. The smell was lacking, but that could just be me. The taste is at once very strong, with a bitter bite, only to immediately smooth out into a really delicious taste. The mouthfeel was especially nice with strong carbonation in a tight space - almost reminiscent of Dr. Pepper. Overall, a fantastic beer!"

"This brew poured with a one finger off white head, which dissipated quickly and left no lacing on the glass. The body was a dark brown with moderate visible carbonation on it. The nose had notes of coffee (even Aly picked this up) and chocolate with a bit of roasted malts. The taste on the brew was almost exactly like the nose, except the coffee overwhelmed the other flavors a bit. The roasted malts and chocolate were detectable, but definitely took back seat to the coffee. The finish lingered with the coffee flavor. The body was moderately thin, decently carbonated and the alcohol was obviously on the lower end. As I sipped the beer, I may have gotten a hint of sweetness as well, but it was very difficult to detect. This was a very flavorful brown ale that I would definitely have again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Wood polish brown mixed with orange and red hues. Good webbed lacing clings to the glass. The nose is nutty, offering up notes of toffee crisp too. And Turbodog's flavor is nutty as well. Nutty with a side of graininess, a kiss of hops, and a vague crispness. With a lighter medium body, this ends up as a respectable, working man's brown ale."
""
""
"This is my first beer from Abita. It pours up a nice deep brown with a fluffy two finger caramel head. There is decent retention and plenty of lacing. The nose is roasted barley, bread, nuts and coffee. Mouthfeel is full with the carbonation not at excessive levels. Taste basically follows the nose. I detect toffee, cola, licorice, chocolate, coffee, and some bready qualities. Not much of an aftertaste and not a tremendous amount of hoppiness for a beer of this nature, but definitely a satisfying beer. I'm looking forward to some more of Abita's offerings."

"Served too cold which probably explains the lack of appreciable aroma. Flavor saves this beer, brings out a distinctiveness and decent taste. Served at a proper ale temp may bring about a better rating, but a good enough beer as presented. and liked it then. I'm sure the quality and potential for a more favorable impression remains; I'll have to review it served from a 12 oz bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Over all this was a solid brown with some high drinkability. It seemed more like an entry level brew, but definitely well crafted and very tasty."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Turbodog - The bottle says: ""Turbodog is a dark brown ale brewed with pale, caramel, and chocolate malts and Willamette hops. This combination gives Turbodog its rich body and color and a sweet chocolate, toffee-like flavor."

"Somewhat thin for the scent...not quite watery but wish it were a bit heavier. Still, this is one I could offer friends willing to try a dark beer that actually has flavor. I'm not a big Abita fan, but I'd pick this one up again for sure. Very easy drinking, tasty English Brown Ale. Give it a try."
"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark. dark red brown. Light head with a little lacing. Looks nice. Aroma a bit off, with vegetable elements. A strong malty start with a flat grassy flavor, malty middle and finish. Close to an interesting flavor, but misses the mark. Light body and low ABV. OK, but not noteworthy."

"O: this is a good beer that I would welcome again. I'm glad to have found a bit of Lousiana up here in Maine and wouldn't mind trying some other products of Abita."
""
""
"O: Not great, but quite good -- a solid English style brown ale. The flavors balance well, with none overpowering. I'd certainly pick up another pack, as long as it's reasonably priced."
""
""
""
""

"Overall- A rather tasty and enjoyable brown ale. It has a nice slightly sweeter flavor and a good mouthfeel."

"Served from tap into an RJ Rockers/Cribbs Kitchen shaker. Poured a dark red-brown with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, milk chocolate, powdered chocolate, cream, and very subtle roasted malt. The flavor was of sweet malt, milk chocolate, roasted malt, and cream. It had a light feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. It was really nice what I found going on in the aroma in this one. However, I was disappointed with the flavor that I found as it was nowhere near as complex as the aroma. While the aroma was complex, it still wasn’t in the next tier for the style. Worth trying if you are in a pinch, but it wouldn’t be my first choice out at a bar."
"Overall - A solid brown ale. Easy to drink. Quite sessionable. What it lacks in aggressive flavor it makes up for in lively mouthfeel."

"This might just be Abita's best, and I would gladly drink this beer first thing in the morning to start my day, it has all the qualities of drink anytime, anywhere beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Roasted malt with hints of chocolate - buttery biscuit toffee middle. It has the round fullness of flavor that you would expect from a big beer with a lighter ABV. Finishes with a dry plumb flavor - wine-like."

""

"O: One of my favs that reminds me easily of New Orleans and hot weather and bar hopping in the French Quarter. This is a nice solid beer that I turn to whenever it's on tap. Not overdone in any one realm, it's beautifully balanced."

"Poured from bottle into glass. Pours a deep amber brown with nich bubble head. Smells of sweet malts, caramel, and maybe somewhat nutty. Taste is deff of sweet caramel malts, a bit of hops, and a slight nutty flavor. Its a very good brown. Not the most amazing but a great brew to end my stay in Louisiana. One thing to say about Abita in general...people in Louisian love their local brew. While options are very limited here, I think its great how loyal they are with Abita and how ""top shelf"" they are regarded here. Cheers NOLA!"

"O-This beer is great with a good steak off the grill. I will buy it again."

"The bottom line is that if you are visiting Louisiana and dining on a spicy seafood dish, you should wash it down with this local product. I am away a lot, and I never feel like I've arrived back home until I can get this into gut."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Another somewhat watered down like flavor from an Abita beer. I think the flavor and aromas of their beers are fairly good but they lack on the body/mouthfeel of their beers."

"Overall - A decent flavour and very drinkable; but not very exciting or different. Just a standard well made english brown. I would probably reach for something else next time in hopes of finding something extraordinary."

""
""

"interesting brew. like a hybrid between a dry irish red ale, a malty english porter, and an american brown ale, its got a little something for everyone. pours a flat looking brown color with just the slightest amber glow to it. minimal off white head. smells malty and sweet, english malts, milk chocolate, bittering hops only. flavor is really strange because of all the malts in here. its sweet above all else, but it isnt heavy. its a very easy drinking beer, but could probably stand a bit more carbonation. went pretty well with a smoked brisket sandwich, but its not howd i would classically define an english brown ale at all."

"I was a little disappointed with this beer. Nothing horrible about it, however, I was expecting it to be more dynamic. All the pieces seemed to be there, but nothing stood out. Color was amazing and the flavors that did come through fit the style. It just seems like it could have been more pronounced."

"O - I had this beer during Mardi Gras 2012...it made me feel ""in the spirit"" as I paired it with some Jambalaya...a sessionable brown ale with pronounced chocolate flavors, sweet toffee and caramel, and a slight nuttiness"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours dark brown with an abundant tan head. The aroma is of dark roasted chocolate malt and toffee. The flavors of dark chocolate and the sweetness of the malt come through. There's some bitterness and herbal flavor of the hops which helps balance this beer's flavor profile. The body is medium and the carbonation is average, which helps this beer drink very well. This was always one of my favorites from Abita and it still is. This is an excellent beer."
""
""
""
"Tasty enough as a session ale, but not one I'd look for, either."
""
""
""
"D: An interesting profile, but a bit lacking for richness and depth. But then, that does go along with it being easy to drink. I am not sure it is really cult following worthy, but it is a fairly nice little brown (if somewhat different)."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Definitely a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Classic fruity english aroma and flavor but with a bit more American 'heft': more roast, more chocolate, more body and even some American hops. Like a newcastle on steroids. Lower carbonation, medium body and just the right intensity of flavor make this super drinkable/sessionable. Delicious brown, I'd probably put it over Downtown Brown."

"Easy to drink beer pairs well with dinner. Lighter than expected from appearance. Nothing too impressive but one looks more impressive to others with this darkish beer."

"A satisfying English Brown Ale, nothing to get super-excited about, but not bad."
"Overall a bold, robust, full tasting brew that had just a light hint of hops which offset everything rather nicely."
""
"In most natural viewing situations this brew appears black. . . clear deep brown/amber if you play sherlock motha fuggin holmes. Smell was. . . sweet. Chocolatey, and the like. Taste was also initially sweet with some earthy essence coming in at the end. Mouthfeel seemed thin. Overall, enjoyed this beer much, will partake again. . ."

"Served in a 12 oz bottle, poured into a pint glass. Poured a dark brown color, mild amount of head, average retention and a small amount of lacing. The aroma is sweet toffee, toasted malt.

Great session beer- One of the classic Micro-Brews."

"Good carbonation, medium light in body, with a short finish. Drinkable but not particularly memorable. The nose is really lacking and the taste just seems to vanish in thin air."
"Not a bad beer. It's simple and easy to drink. It's not something I would go out of my way to get again, but it was good once."
"I wouldn't order this again. It was ok. Not bad, but nothing that I would go seek out."
"O- A pretty good brown. Definitely one of Abita's better beers."
"O: This is a very solid session beer. This isnt the best of beers, but it is very tasty and easy to drink."
"Overall I enjoyed turbodog. A fine example of it's style."
"Pours a quick 1-finger light tan head, which dissipates somewhat quickly. Aromas of cocoa and vanilla cappuccino. Dark, Coca-Cola coloring. Smooth mouthfeel and great drinkability. Aftertaste of chocolate milk. Overall a good beer for sitting out on a porch in the fall, having a good conversation."
"Overall: I like this beer a lot. It's good and cheap for the price of most craft beers in Puerto Rico. It's a beer that I like to keep in my fridge."
"Appearance - dark brown, reddish highlights, 1 finger thick head that is off white. Smells of chocolate, toffee, some earthy grassy hop notes. Taste follows the nose, chocolate, toffee, roasted grains, some hoppy bitterness at the end, kind of dry. Medium to thin mouthfeel, med. carbonation. I think this is drinkable, can enjoy at least a couple. this is a pretty good brew for the style."
"First time I had this beer, I was down in New Orleans at a place called Molly's. I wonder if it's still there. This was several years ago. I was so happy to be able to drink a local beer and always remembered it. When I saw it at the store this weekend, I picked it up and recalled that time. Unfortunately, this beer may have been sitting on the shelf a little longer than I would have hoped. It didn't taste as fresh as the first time I had it. Too bad. I remember loving it. But, this one may have traveled in the heat up here and it lost a bit of quality in the transport."
"The coffee seems to come through more when drinking than it had in the aroma and there is still a decent roasted malt quality to it. The aftertaste is a light sweet dry, which was pretty good itself. A pretty good brown beer."
"O: My favorite beer from Abita; rich, creamy, and simple with moments of intriguing complexities"
"Notes: Much darker/roasted than I was expecting. A lot like a porter. Fairly balanced with the sweet and bitter. Quite chocolatey and roasted on the taste. I thought it was fine but not something I would normally get."
"A pretty good beer overall, a lot better than I thought it would be. I’d order it again for sure."
"Overall--Very drinkable and satisfying brown ale. Nothing about this beer says ""turbodog"" to me, so I have no idea where that name came from, and, quite frankly, it's a pretty big turnoff. It sounds like some sort of alcoholic energy drink made to compete with Red Bull + vodka or something. Anyway, the twinge of hop bitterness here almost made me think I had a secret ESB on my hands, but layer after layer of malts suppresses it too much. Still, despite the awful name, this is a rich, smooth and likeable beer."
"The Rest: I've had this on tap quite a few times, and now that I'm reviewing it from a bottle, not in a bar, I don't like as much as I though I did. It's a decent beer, but it's a bit too chalky to be a good brown ale."
"Drank from pilsner glass. Appearance is very dark with a carmel colored head that starts out about two fingers thick than slowly dissapates to lacing around the edge. Has a very weak smell for the dark appearance. Taste a slight vanilla and for some reason i get a smoky after taste which i couldnt think of anything to compare it to. Its a very smooth beer, the mouthfeel is spot on for a brown ale. Overall not a bad beer, very happy i tried this but not something i will be looking to order again anytime soon basically just becuase there wasnt really that ""WOW"" factor"
"Thanks to Sully for sending this to me. Nice brownish head of about two inches and wonderful lacing. Deep brown colour. Smells wonderful, like a mocha chocolate float. Taste is great too, but not less filling. Full bodied and creamy and malty sweetness with some bitter smoothing. Still feeling the coffee and chocolate in flavour. Overall a nice beer, better than most English brown ales, much more complex and striking. Thanks, Mike."
"Pretty smooth mouthfeel, lower carbonation and medium body. Overall a nice easy drinking beer but with nice flavor"
"O: Went well with a meal and was pretty solid all around. Above average."
"O- A good brown ale. Worth keeping around. Flavorful and easy to drink."
"M - Light body; light to moderate carbonation."
"Extremely well balanced, quaffable, and very tasty brown brew."
"The best Abita has to offer, Turbodog pours darker than most browns with a thick mat of bone colored whip. Drying chocolate malt is front and center giving it a character more in line with English Porter. Dark fruit and burnt sugar form the backbone while hops are mostly earthy and balance the malt evenly. The English Brown tag seems a bit off, but this a nice everyday drinker and great value. Thanks Abita for the best before dating."
"Probably one of the best offerings one can enjoy from Abita! This brew pours up a deep, dark chocolaty brown body and sports a rich, foamy tan-colored head. Scents of espresso, caramel, roasted malts and even those of a well aged bourbon. Flavors of slow-roasted coffee, dark chocolates and bits of toffee; also mixed in this complex brew are dark fruits (akin to plums)."
"O: I'm a huge Abita fan for what it is: solid, entry level craft beer. I'm knocking this beer some points because the smell isnt what it could have been, and the inital intense sweetness is a little too much for me. Around $8.99 for a sixer, tough to beat for a decent craft beer."
"Can't say I've ever had a disappointing taste from the Abita brands"
"The beer is dark brown with red/ cranberry hues on the edge of the glass, the head is pillowy, thick and khaki colored. Smells of roasted malt, a hint of chocolate and coffee, there is also a slight cookie aroma. The taste is a little bitter, with burnt coffee, smoke a bitter dark chocolate. The beer is lighter than I thought it would be, the caronation is soft and it has a nice bitter finish"
"Overall: I would definitely recommend this one. It would be a good introduction to people who aren't used to dark beers, since it's definitely not intimidating or overwhelming."
"Overall this is a easy drinking beer without much to think about."
"Lightless brown hue with off-white head that disappears. Aroma stands out beautifully: hazelnut, chocolate, cinnamon, and brown sugary earth. Smooth flavors of hazelnut, cocoa, cinnamon, vague caramel, and a lingering brown sugar cookie note with ever so light tang. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A great English brown. Pick this one up."
"Overall, a solid, decent brown ale"
"Not the fullest of dark beers, but a good transition beer if you're wanting to get into darker beers."
"O: when I turned 21 this was the darkest beer I had ever set eyes on. Now its a great brown and one I'd love to have in the fridge."
"overall; a pretty good beer but nowhere near the elite of the style, still a worthy and tasty brew."
"From my notes: Turbodog was my favorite beer for years and years, until I learned the joys of hops and American Brown Ales. Still, I’ll always have a soft spot for the brew. Not the best-looking pint, dark brown with a cheap, fizzy head. Nose is slightly sweet, with solid chocolate notes. And Turbodog doesn’t hold the same mystique of flavor now, unfortunately, but the requirements for a solid Brown Ale do show up. Chocolate and a mild coffee bite, modest bitter finish with subtleties of mocha and hops. Thin texture hinders the malts; not my favorite anymore, but still worth the occasional roll in the hay."
"O- I can almost always find this in six packs and i enjoy a darker beer often so this is totally drinkable (i've drank through the rest of six pack on another night). Its a very good beer and Abita hasn't dissapointed me yet."
"I poured this into a pint glass, it has a dark brown body with a little head that quickly dissipates to a think lace around the edge. The smell is very malty with some dark fruits coming threw. The taste starts of of some dark fruits, like plums or figs, then it gets a nutty, coffee and chocolate taste on the back of the tongue. It has a nice mouth feel. Overall this is a ok beer."
"i was bored and this beer has been in the store for a year i bet but can find a date not to bad wonder what it taste like fresh. pours black which is good had a stale taste so from that i like it. not a bad taste or smell so try it NOT HOPPY ITS DARK AND I ILKE IT"
"Overall Impression- Good English Brown Ale! I'm used to American Brown Ales, so this was fantastic to try a mild brown ale. The nutty flavor was great in this beer and really enjoyed. A little tough on the drinkability but I finished the rest after my meal (Chicken and Bean Nachos)."
"It's a pretty well rounded ale, very enjoyable."
"Not a beer I'd probably buy, but a fairly well made example ofthe style."
"O - This was a gateway beer for me. Always like this guy for the memories."
"O: Abita was my entry into craft beer and this was my favorite offering from them. For a ""darker beer"" it's fairly easy to drink, but can sit a little heavy after 4 or 5. While I don't drink this as much as I used to, it's always nice to revisit what peaked your interest into the hobby."
"O- I really enjoyed this one. my hats off to the craft brewers down there in Louisiana."
"O ~ An easy drinker. When diggin' for browns, this is a pretty good choice. There are better out there, but this is worthy of a pint glass."
"i like this one...but i'm not entirely sure how often i'd drink it. if it was a little less roasty, i'd probably like it a bit more. drinks a bit like a chocolate stout, honestly. which i like...but still. not what i was expecting, and still can't decide if i was pleasantly surprised. maybe i should give this one another shot again sometime."
"This beer has a good bit of flavor but in my opinion could use more alcohol. Not just because I like beers that are strong but because a beer of this style I think would do better in higher ranges of alcohol. That alcohol needs to be there tell some flavors to take a step back."
"The feel of this beer is medium but can feel light from sip to sip. This is a drinkable beer but can leave you scratching your head trying to really understand where this beer is placed."
"O- A very enjoyable beer; It’s nice and smooth, and quite sweet, but is balanced enough not to make one sick of it too quickly. Not an incredible brown ale, but a very good one. I’d like to try it on tap, where it would probably be even more flavorable."
"So I'm disappointed. For the style, body is lacking. And for 10 bucks a six pack, after you get past the initial smell that promises good things to come, you realize you've been had. Don't get me wrong. You can easily put away quite a bunch of these...but the same thing can be said of lots of decent beers that cost less."
"D- Overall i was surprized by this beer. didn't think it would be that good but i really liked this. Was a tad watered down but not too much and had alot of nice flavors comming through and is very drinkable for even beer noobs. Will get this again"
"Overall - This is a nice beer if you want something dark and different, but don't want a heavy stout. In my opinion, it resmbles more of a porter. Get it if you want something tasty, but not something too heavy."
"Pours black with a small tan head. Smells of malts, roasted malts. Smells alright. Taste is pretty smooth, malts of a brown ale, good balance of sweetness (as in not too sweet) and just a touch of bite in the finish. Decent, I guess. Has good carbonation and a relatively thin mouthfeel. Really goes down easy and is a nice alterative to the BMC flowing around Bourbon Street. Not great, but decent and doable. Pretty much the definition of average."
"Pours a deep dark brown with ruby highlights on the outer edges. Average tan head that produces a pleasant, earthy, roasted, caramel and malty aroma. Laces the glass nicely! Flavor is rich with some tasty malt. Toffee and a hint of chocolate flavors with a nice hop bitterness on the end to balance the sweet malt. Average finish. Light to medium body; it's a little watery. But overall it's a pretty solid beer."
"Wow, I have been passing this brew by for SO many years---I'm really glad I finally tried it! Nice take on the classic English Brown Ale via Louisiana. Pours a very pretty dark brown with reddish notes. Nice off-white head that produced some slight lacing, but lasted the whole glass. The scent of the beer is malt, some burnt sugar, light hops, and coffee. The taste of the beer mimics the nose---with a bit more nicely balanced bitterness---touch of sweetness. Malt is definitely dominate. I get nice coffee, cola, cocoa notes on the palate. All this being said, its a very easy drinking beer, one that even a lighter beer drinker may enjoy. If you have been passing it by, try it!! Turbodog may put a smile on your face!!"
"O - Better than any commercial mass production beer, but I've tasted a lot of better brown ales."
"12oz bottle at The Dish in Ormond Beach, FL. Review from notes taken shortly after tasting. Pours a very dark brown with ruby highlights and two fingers of beige head, which quickly dissipates to a thin ring. A couple spots of lacing line the footed pilsner glass. Smell and taste are toast, milk chocolate, roasted nuts, toffee, caramel, mild coffee-like bitterness, slightly watery finish with a vanishing aftertaste. Almost no hops, this is a malty, ho-hum brown ale with a medium-creamy mouthfeel. It's quaffable, but I wouldn't buy it again."
"Needs a big addition to the malt profile to find its way back to my fridge."
"O - not very impressed by this one. i get what they were trying to do but it feels like they need to go back to the drawing board to pull this one off."
"It's a bit fizzy and soda-like, but it goes down easy. A drinkable brown ale, for sure, but nothing really jumps out at me as great."
"12 ounce bottle, best by 8/1/2011, bought as a single at World Market. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours very dark brown with an inch frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is roasted malt, toffee, bittersweet chocolate and some nuts and coffee. For the most part, the taste is just like the aroma except that there's a bit of hops noticable in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit creamy and smooth with good carbonation. I think it's a good overall brew, it wouldn't be hard to drink a 6 pack of this. I'd buy this again in the future, I enjoyed it. It's one of the better Abita brews I've had."
"O- Overall this is an enjoyable beer with nice balance. Highly drinkable and the spicy notes really add some character to this ale."
"Mouthfeel is slightly on the dry side with a light carbonation that acidiclly cuts through the sweet grains. Despite a lack of flavor hops it sure feels like there are some bittering hops. After each sip I feel like I am loosing a layer of enamel on my teeth. A solid brew. Not my favorite but a good drinker and one I'd have again and again."
"Color is a good transparent brown, with a good malt back bone in the flavor. Some light hops in the mix. TurboDog has a good following I haven't been able to really understand it. I like the fact that Abita's flagship brew is a Brown Ale and not a Lager or Pale Ale. I think that says something for them. I'll need to try this brew again sometime though because the one and only time I had it, I hadn't chilled it fully and it was a little on the warm side yet."
"O: Easy drinking for sure, nice intro to ""better"" beer then BMC. A bit sweet to be a session beer."
"Man, I haven't had this since my Passport at Chumley's back in my Purdue days. I wonder how I'll receive it now? It pours a mostly clear dark brown topped by a finger of cream-white foam. The nose comprises caramel, toffee, biscuit, grass, and light flowers. The taste starts out with a mild combo of toffee and biscuits, then strikes hard and fast with stronger-than-before grass, flowers, orange peel, and cedar. It's all a bit much, with the nicer malts getting drowned out by a blunt herbal bitterness. But, in its defense, things never get truly out of hand. The body is a very light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty dry finish. Overall, a nice little brown, not necessarily something I would readily reach for, but also not something I would cringe at if offered me."
"Medium body, thick and creamy, like a lighter stout. Very easy to drink and sessionable. Worth a try if you like the style. I don't think it's the most traditional, but it's still good."
"Notes: Turbodog is a medium bodied brown, and quite flavorful. While it lacks slightly on the nose, the taste makes up for it. It's very easy to drink, and a rock-solid example of this particular style."
"This is a quite enjoyable beer to have on a cold evening or with a rich meal. I would come back for more."
"What I liked most about this brew was how it managed to have a good deal of dark flavors but still be somwhat light on its feet, making it a great pair for Cajun cuisine. It poured a brilliant dark reddish-brown with a finger off-white head which clung somewhat to the glass. The nose was rich with malty flavors of baked peach, light roast coffee and peanut butter cup, while the palate was lightly-medium boded with a rich dark malt character- notes of dark chocolate and pecan- and a nice balance of hops. Finish is moderate with more chocolate and molassas notes."
"Finish: coffee lingers with the hoppy bitterness still in the cheeks"
"D- I could knock down a few of these happily. Pretty nice balance of everything here."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a deep, dark amber-brown. Crystal in color, with mid-density, tan colored head. Aromas of coffee and chocolate, with dark molasses characteristics. Bold flavors of dark roasted coffee, with some chocolate highlights and semi-sweet toffee flavors, also. The brew is smooth and light in mouth, and the flavors remain very crisp. Slight bitter coffee aftertaste with a reasonably quick finish. Smooth and tasty, this one is easy going down."
"D- I love turbodog, i recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good alcohol beverage, and who doesn't want that!! This is a well done dark dessert beer, and expect that while drinking it."
"I'll be honest, English browns aren't generally my cup of tea (or beer as it were...) but this is very well done. Subtly balanced, nice sweetness without being cloying with just enough hops to balance it out without it being slightly bitter, Mouthfeel is nice and creamy with s slightly sweet finish. It is a very solid beer."
"First review with the new kitties in the house; I could hear them pattering around upstairs in their room."
"Color is a very dark brownish-red, bordering on burgundy. The tan head was thin, only about one finger's width, and faded quickly. A good amount of lacing left on the glass. The scent of cocoa was weak but nice; I had to take a few good sniffs to full catch it. The taste was much the same - quite malty with cocoa, raisin, and subtle hops. There is a bit of a medicinal or herbal taste I don't care for. Carbonation was mild. Enjoyable, but nothing outstanding going on here."
"D - this is a solid beer. nothing really special, but decent for the price. considerably drinkable. sessionable."
"D. This is my 3rd Abita from a Holiday variety pack. This one drinks nice and easy - I like it the best so far."
"D: Very simple, seems like I would be able to have a couple of these."
"Final Notes: One of the better brown ales I've had. Rich, sweet, and malty, with just a touch of sourness and bitterness to keep things interesting. I'll be coming back for more."
"Verdict: Not too bad, but certainly not very interesting. Worth a shot, but like the other Abita I had, falls short of the competition. Be wary. C (2.95)"
"O - A pretty lack-luster brew. Nothing about it makes me want to have another one. I've had it from the bottle and now on tap, and neither have been to my liking. I'm moving on."
"Pours a dark brown with a bit of reddish translucence and a quickly fading head. Aromas are of nuts, stale coffee, chocolate, wet cardboard and slightly rotten potatoes. Coffee comes through strongly as a flavor and there is a bit of a sourness to it that compliments the earthy flavors. Still, it is a bit thin and doesn't really go anywhere."
"I've become addicted to Abita lately with Restoration being my favorite, but this is the complete opposite of the spectrum for me. It's ironic because this was the first Abita beer I heard about but I'm really not impressed."
"yeah, its drinkable for a brown ale. especially only coming in at 5.6 abv. means I could have a couple without it getting too heavy. would probably pass in the future for something I enjoy a little more."
"Overall a very clean and unidimensional schwarzbier. It drinks and sessions well and nothing else."
"D: This is a case of a beer being more than the sum of its parts. I really enjoyed this beer, and would find it again if I were ever down around them there parts..."
"(Drinkability): If you enjoy the taste (which might be asking a lot), the Turbodog might make a good session beer. With an almost complete lack of flavor and a low alcohol content, this Brown Ale won't be meeting my friends anytime soon."
"Notes: It had been such a long time that I just felt compelled to revisit it. When I first came to the US years ago this was one of the easily available and enticing brews that seemed to be out of the mainstream. At the time pretty beer uneducated, and in that context it also shares for me some of that iconic micro status. All in all it is something that having a choice I´d probably won´t revisit in a long while, but it remains pretty drinkable and all kinds of decent. I´d always welcome it crossing my path again as I move through the South, or elsewhere, in the future."
"D: Overall a fairly drinkable brew. The first half had disappeared almost before I noticed. However, the noticeable alcohol which came out as it warmed limits the overall experience."
"FourthBeer potential: AVERAGE, as there are many brown ales with more body, but for a light closer, this might do the trick."
"An ok beer, nothing special."
"The thinness of it hurts this beer the most, I'm not expecting it to have stout-like qualities, but at times it seemed like water. Overall though, it's a ever-so slightly above average brown ale. I'll reach for some Oak Pond first if I get a craving for the style."
"An ok brown ale, smells better than it tastes."
"I love the English Brown Ale. As with most of my contemporaries, my first introduction to the genre was with Newcastle, and as such, I base most comparisons of EBAs on that beer...that being said, this one shines above Newcastle. It's more flavorful and similarly priced. Given the choice, I would choose Turbodog from now on over Newcastle."
"While serious beer drinkers may be slightly underwhelmed with this beer's showing, it is undoubtedly a phenomenally balanced beer. It would be a great almost-session brew for a dark beer lover, or a great intro brew for the dark beer skeptic."
"Feels medium in body with an oily slickness, except the brew leaves the palate a little dry. Great beer and I'm glad I finally gave this one a try."
" this beer finishes a bit dry and lingers on the palate, but in a good way. Good balance over all. A must try for any beer drinker."
"Drinkability is solid, multiples would be easy."
"Had this beer at my brothers, and I know that I have seen these sit on shelves at Bevmo for a while here, so it is very possible I just had one that was past it's prime. Would try fresh and re-review if possible."
"Drinkability: Above average. I found it quite good overall."
"Drinkability is above average, as I wouldn't mind putting away a couple of pints of this in a sitting. I just wish there there was a bit more oomph to it, but I'm not going to fuss so much over it. A solid, drinkable brew from Abita."
"Fairly smooth mouthfeel, decent level of carbonation. Very solid offering."
"Cheers!"
"The mouth is a little abrasive at first but quickly mellows along with the taste"
"edit: gave this another try saturday at lucky's pub downtown and i swear it tasted like watered down hot chocolate. word to the wise, never judge a beer on how it tastes when you're already drunk."
"Dark reddish-brown color. A moderate tan head with noticeable carbonation. Roasty malts in the aroma, a tinge of chocolate, but mostly burnt coffee, which was kind of a turn off. Taste full of dry cocoa and burnt coffee; not too appealing. Somewhat thin and highly carbonated. Bitter, burnt aftertaste. Overall, not very drinkable, due mainly to the burnt taste and subsequent unpleasant aftertaste."
"12 oz bottle at Boiling Pot, Rocport TX. Pours a dark brown with a small, tan short lasting head. Aroma is dark fruit and roasted malt. Flavor begins with espresso and nutty malt, but ends as spoiled fruit. May be it was a bad bottle. Not sure if I will try it again."
"D: I'd say so-so. A good beer, but the bitterness overshadows the malts in a disappointing way."
"Poured a big 3"" head which took quite a while to dissipate but when it did hardly left a trace. Deep dark Van Dyke brown with redish highlights when poured and held to the light. Nose and taste have caramel and sweet malt, and the finish is a pretty long caramel ride. Really quite the quality beer for the reasonable price."
"Turbodog is a dark hazelnut color with crimson highlights. The head is a half inch thick, has good retention and leaves ample lacing. The appearance is fabulous. The aroma is mild, containing malt, subtle sweetness, and an earthy scent. The beer is very malty with minimal, if any, hop bitterness, definitely in accordance with the style. The beer is simple and straightforward, with no detectable flaws or shortcomings. The feel is full bodied, especially given the low alcohol content of the beer. I had no problem enjoying two pints of this brew. I have never had it in the bottle, so I can't vouch for it there, but served fresh and on draft it was a very enjoyable brown ale."
"D- Nothing impressive. Earthy taste brings drinkability down. Easy enough to drink, but would prefer not to."
"Overall, this beer isn't bad, but seems a bit 1-dimensional."
"Decent price snagged 6 for $9 bucks."
"D: There's a bit tartness in this originally that I found detracted from the beer, although it definitely improves as the beer warms."
"My first impression which stood out through the entire bottle was a toffee, carmel flavor with just malted edge to it that was nice, and though I thought it would it failed to turn bitter at any point.The bottle was sevred up nice and cold, and this bottle went down nice and quick. A perfect change of base beer for a nice day."
"Drinkability average...not as much to be savored in the flavor as some of the herbed or flavored varieties. Not what I expected from a dark brown ale; too straightforward. To be quaffed."
"Poured a clear dark mahogany brown with a nice two fingered tan head, with some light lacing. Aromas of grainy sweet malts predominated the entire sampling. On the palette, burnt molasses, semi-sweet chocolate and malt with a slight metallic finish. Medium bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Nothing to write home about for this brew."
"This beer pours a nice mahogany with twinges of orange, a decent frothy beige head. This smelled of some nice malty orange, and hints of the hops peek through but are drowned out by the stronger chocolate malt notes. The taste is notably lack-luster. Not by any means bad, but there is hints of roast and I'm fairly certain I can taste the water in this beer, which I don't find normal for a brown ale. As you may figured out this beer by proxy seems watery to me. All things considered, this is still a good beer, and if it was given to me I would have no problem drinking it. It's a very unimpressive beer, but solid for it's style."
"Something about that combination of minerality/bitterness and lack of sweetness just doesn't do it for me."
"12 ounce stubby bottle. Really dark brown color, bordering on black. Nice off white head with some good amount of foam as well. Good lacing. Aroma is ... okay. Decent mouthfeel with light bitterness and good carbonation. The taste is pretty darned good. It starts with toasted malts followed by light bittersweet chocolate with earthy hop character in the background. Enjoyable and one of the better examples of the American Brown that I've had."
"I was hoping to feel the exhilaration of spooling up to 2.5 bars and being launched into next week, by some greyhound of the future, but perhaps my expectations were too lofty for an English Brown. Either way, the name seems irrelevant and the beer is good but forgettable."
"Still, not a bad beer by any means."
"Pleasure to drink. Yes, sir, I like it."
"English browns are not my favorite style, but I find this one very well done & more flavorful than most. Not a huge beer but tasty, could definitely see repeat performances. My favorite from the regular Abita line-up."
"Quite drinkable."
"The beer has a creamy carb but very light body. Finish is sweet with a touch of lingering soy sauce.  A good beer for a college boy, but not the best brown ale for a working man. "
"Pours that dark and tepidly translucent brown of a brown ale. Nice tan foamy head. Smell is like a song of sweet dark malts, very nice. First taste is blended oh-so-well, nutty with a twang of hops at the end. Carbonated beautifully well, finish is smooth as pudding. Drinkability is pretty good, even if the abv seems higher than it actually is. A brown ale that I really like!"
"Pretty good brew that went perfect with the Jambayla. Pours quite dark with a real roasty nose. The mouthfeel is fairly thin but very drinkable. I liked the way it worked with the food and I wanted another one fairly soon. Hope this beer makes it up to BC one day"
" overall i think its a good beer but im not a stout fan, still like it enough, worth a shot to people new to stout/porter styles"
"Drinkable enough, I suppose; I bought this as a single at World Market, and won't be running back to get a 6 pack of it."
"Drinkability: I finished about 2/3rds of this before the aftertaste got to me and I dumped the rest. Shame, this could have been good. I wouldn't be adverse to trying it again, I could have a bad bottle since my head was nearly non-existent."
"D: Wow this is a very drinkable brew... Low ABV and good flavors make this a nice session brew, but it also can be a sit back and enjoy it kind of beer. Great mix of things."
"Yeah I gotta call it watery, it's really really thin, but that makes it chuggable. Gone in an instant."
"D: Not a bad brown ale and probably the best Abita brew."
"This is a very drinkable brew. Will it satisfy a big flavorful brew need? No. But it is a good solid drinkable brown ale that will not offend. It just isn't going to make you say""holy sh!t !!""... At 5.6% alcohol it will definitely make for a good session."
"D-Sessionable, went well with the Jambalaya..."
"D- This is an excellent beer. I keep these around when friends are over whom seem to like this. I do enjoy a couple of these at a time. I recommend this beer for anyone who wants to have a very good example of a brown ale! However not in the same league as Rogue Hazelnut brown or Samuel Smiths Nut Brown Ale."
"The smell sums this beer up for me- it's got things going on (chocolate, barley, a little bitter), but it dies off a little short. Same with the taste- ends up slightly on the watery side despite keeping it real most of the way. This also brings down the points for mouthfeel, it's a little on the thin side for me. However, you can't forget that it's an ale, so despite the fact that it leans towards stout (oh yeah), it's up front about the ale factor, which explains the wateryness. All in all, a super solid brew, especially for the price, and one that I could see myself drinking quite a few of in one night. Will buy again."
"D-Above average drinkability.Quite sessionable."
"Cheers!"
"D: I must say, had this in a bottle and was good, had it on tap and was better. A great offering from Abita, nice to see all the way up here!"
"a more drinkable and nuanced brown ale than i am used to, but still really good."
"Abita Turbodog is a very dark berry-brown colored ale with a sand colored head that fades to a film and leaves pretty nice lacing. It has a faint, grainy aroma. It smells roasty and a touch sweet. It's pretty light bodied, pretty smooth and a little watery at the finish. It's lightly flavored with a smooth roastiness. There are notes of chocolate and malt balls. It's a little sweet, without much bitterness. It's very simple and pretty easy drinking."
"This is the second Brown Ale I've tried, after Newcastle, and I definitely like Turbodog more, it doesn't seem as bland or thin. Abita did right with this one, it's good!"
"D: This is a very drinkable brew, nice job on the style interpretation. A easy, smooth drink."
"Mostly drinkable. Big strong flavors and a strong mouth feel may turn off some."
"D - A nice quaff-able brew with good malty flavors & a nice hop flavor profile. I'd sit down with 2-3 pints sometime but nothing I'd buy again, I was kinda looking for just a bit more toffee in the flavor but not bad at all. It's worth a try."
"d: Nice beer but i'd like the flavor kicked up just a bit and the hops taken down a notch. Other then that, decent brown ale."
"D: the brew drank alright and I thought the smokiness was really good and added dimension to the beer."
"Abita Turbodog poured a dark brown, almost the same color as the auburn bottle it comes in. the caramel colored head seems to be thick and frothy. The head was still hanging out in the middle of my pint glass when I was half way through this beer. Nice! It smells of rich sweet brown sugar that is very welcoming, and a little leathery. It's a lot softer than I imagined. I guess the black label and the big name always lead me to believe this was a huge stout. However, it is a very drinkable brown ale with hints of molasses and a soft tobacco on the finish. It does linger on the palate a bit longer then I would like. What more can I say....it's good!"
"D: Decent brown ale that hides the ABV well. Good for 1-2 at the most"
"D- This is an excellent beer, and although I wouldn't necessarily have more than one or two of these on it's own, I'd definitely like to try this again with a meal...some sweet rubbed baby back ribs perhaps. I recommend this beer for anyone who wants to have a very good example of a brown ale!"
"Overall, a solid brown ale. There are other browns I enjoy better: Brooklyn, Rogue's, Moose Drool but a very solid brown for a style that I particularly like and appreciate."
"Again since I am from Louisiana I have to show a little bias, but I actually really like this beer. Pours a dark, dark brown, almost black with a about a finger worth of beige head. When you bring the glass up to smell you will almost immediately notice the faint aroma of chocolate. Has a very good taste going down with a clean finish. Mildly carbonated and decent lacing on the side of the glass."
"At the Flying Saucer in Memphis, TN. Poured a carbonated cloudy dark brown, with one finger of beige head, and decent lacing. Smelled very malty, with small traces of milk chocolate. Tasted very bland, dominated by maltiness and again, only a touch of chocolate. Very thin for a brown ale, and very carbonated. Not a fan."
"D - Refreshing to drink and definitely easy going down. Unfortunately the best part of this beer is the smell and appearance. Not the greatest example of a brown ale, but definitely not the worst either."
"Good beer just not great. If I want a malt fix going to a scotch ale."
"D - i'm just not into this one at all, nothing to point out in terms of flavor here."
"I just had this beer for the 1st time the other night on tap @ my local watering hole. It has a nice light brown color with a little head. it had a light chocolate aroma & the taste was smiler to the smell. It was a light chocolate flavor but not too sweet, with some toffee, hops, & just a bit on the bitter side. Overall a average to good beer but I was ready to move on to a different beer rather than have another."
"Drinkability is very high due to the lightness and interesting flavors. For some reason this beer seems like more of a black lager than a brown ale both in color and flavor profile. Nonetheless, a solid and refreshing ale."
"Check it off as drinkable but otherwise, it seems unremarkable. The name is fun to say though. Solid at the most."
"Notes: An excellent strong ale with the balance and pedigree of a great brown ale."
"D- Overall a decent beer, just not too impressive"
"Smell is not strong - sweet, caramel notes. Flavor is along the same lines, but surprisingly weak. Tastes almost watered down. Not sure I'd want a second one."
"Drinkability- ok, I have had way better. I wouldn't buy it again."
"Abita hit Vermont today and this is the first time I've ever had any of their beer. I had Purple Haze; hated it. Had their IPA, thought it was decent. This one is pretty good though. I usually can't stand brown ales, but this has got a very nice malt profile. This is a lot like a German double bock, but much easier to drink. Fairly sweet and somewhat smokey. The mouth-feel is where this beer really shines. It's very smooth and silky. Overall, a very nice brew."
"D - It smells like an adjunct drinkable beer but ended up being an overly bitter beer with not a lot of flavor."
"D: Its an easy beer to drink. And i would buy again, i really enjoyed it."
"D: Drinking this beer is a breeze and it's very sessionable."
"I'm not big on brown ales, so if you are, don't take my word for it. It's good for a taste, but I'll move on to more flavorful pastures."
"Dense mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Not overly heavy. Wouldn't mind having another one, but I'm assuming the beer is a little better than I'm rating it."
"Drinkablity is good. It goes down nice and easy and is not a bad tasting beer. It would make a good session brew although its not the most flavorful example of the style. I would have it again if it happened to be around."
"Reminded me of a weak stout or washed up porter, not overly impressed."
" and being part irish there is no substitute"
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with no expiration date checked off on the label. Sampled on May 13, 2010. It pours brown with some ruby red hues and about a half an inch of silky light brown head. There are a variety of light hops in the aroma but nothing in particular stands out. The taste has a bit of thin chocolate malts along with a pleasing backdrop of hops. A fairly likeable beer."
"I could drink these for hours. Great with steak or just to relax with."
"the carbonations is on the money, and its a very drinkable beer. I can drink this all day everyday."
"D: I think that I could drink a few of these since they don't overload and stay on the palate much. This really seems like a beer that you drink with heavily flavored food and would work well at a BBQ. However, it seems that it is just a little bit too heavy on its own to go with pizza, with which beer is mandatory. For me, this is a difficult category, since I find that many of my favorite beers are very strongly flavored and only one or two max should be consumed at a time. This is not a fast drinking beer, it is not refreshing, and I don't think it is supposed to be."
"D: Very drinkable, one of the lightest beers though I wouldn't recommend to convert a BMC drinker. Not sure why that came to mind but I just don't think it would work."
"Poured into Guinness glass. Very dark brown, with reddish hues.Smells like chocalate-covered rye crackers to me, not necessarily a bad thing.Tastes good, somewhat like Newcastle, only richer. I like this beer, but I don't think I could drink a lot of them. Next winter, I could see myself having this again."
"I would have again given the similar circumstances."
"D : Not a bad brew for one or two, thanks to the fair malt and hop balance, but not a chart topping brown due to the lack of a really punchy flavor and mouthfeel."
"Enjoyed at Papa Mojo's in Durham, NC this brew shows a dark mahogany color with a strong tan colored head and lots of lacing. The aroma suggests a mild rye malt and maybe even an illusion of dark chocolate. The flavor brings light charcoal and sweet licorice malt with some rain water crispness and mild carbonation. Plenty drinakable, near medium bodied, a tad lifeless but smooth and a little tingly on the tongue. I pick up some skunkiness with leafy-grass hop edges and a bit of chocolate perhaps but it's more toward the brown sugar in the final analysis. Worth a try but not anything to cause uncontollable salivation."
"this is a very drinkable beer that i wish i had more of. the cult status seems to be quite well deserved."
"Cheers!"
"D-the mouthfeel really throws me off. Some good flavors are there but I really am looking for something that stays on the tongue longer. I would likely pass on this in the future."
"What's a Turbodog? You'd maybe imagine bulldogs on choppers or beagles piloting prop planes. This beer, however, is such a let-down I instead see images of Droopy dog, muffled and depressed. Boohoo."
"Mouthfeel is chewy, hoppy, and evenly balanced."
"To sum, 3 words: ""Go-to beer""."
"D - Very enjoyable and drinkable beer. I was not too sure what I would be getting with this beer, but I was pleasantly surprised. I would definitely purchase this one again."
"Cheers."
"had on tap at old chicago in uptown it was a dark brown color with a tan ring and some good lacing it looked like a scotch ale..the smell was faint in malts some chocolate some toffee and caramel..the taste was better then the smell it had some hops mixed with roasted malts some toast some bitter hops and some brown sugar.the mouthfeel was medium/thin for an english brown.overall it was ok tasty not one i will buy a sixer of but it was ok to try on tap..slightly recommended"
"Mouthfeel was overly carbonated & and fairly thinl. I was underwhelmed. Drinkability was not great. Didn't seek another one out while in NOLA. Don't know that I will for another couple years."
"D - A descent beer but nothing amazing. It would be sessionable but it was just a bit heavy for me and lacks the complexity I'd like."
"Taste is a very malty, without any of the subtle sweetness I expected from the nose and style. There is a little bit of toffee, but this mostly is a toasted flavor. Finish is a little bit bitter, but not so much as to distract from the drink. Strong medium body that is rich and enjoyable."
"I did expect more spicy, earthy hop flavors. I'd be happy if I knew how old this bottle was (cough, cough Abita, use the label!). I don't think I'll be buying this again, given the more flavorful options in the price range and in styles I prefer."
"Medium-light bodied and carbonated appropriately for style. A delicious beer for sure, it's easily drinkable."
" ~ This beer has a very interesting texture and flavor. I'm not a huge fan of it but I must admit this is a brew I recommend people give a try."
"drinkability is high, goes down easy, seems like it would pair well with rich or spicy food, not sure if I want to just drink one, but with some jambalaya, heck yeah."
"D: Very drinkable, this is a sessionable beer with not a lot of overpowering flavors or alcohol."
"By nature this wasn't the smoothest drinkability but it was more than smooth enough for a Dark Brown."
"M/D: Way too thin for the style, in my opinion. It's drinkable, and I'd have one if I were in New Orleans and there was nothing else around, but overall it's pretty bland and uninteresting."
"Very dry and lively for a brown. It's also got a remarkably full body and smooth finish, almost like it was poured from a nitro tap. Like everything else from Abita, this is quite well brewed."
"D - I would track down a reasonably priced sixer!"
"Aroma of caramel malt and biscuits. Very nice nutty coffee flavor. A good flavor, somewhere between a Guinness and a Newcastle. Has a clean mouthfeel for a brown ale, nice and sweet.Very drinkable, would be a nice session brown ale. Would definately order again when looking for a nice light Brown ale."
"RJT"
"The feel is okay. This seems to be a cross between a brown ale and a porter. It isn't bad bad I wouldn't look for it again."
"Tasty, nice brew. Drinkable."
"Beer is medium in body, smooth, slight, really subtle roast in the back. Overall well balanced, drinkability high, good carbonation on the palate, some sweetness in there as well. Second taste, Sweetness first, no real bitterness. Mouthfeel good. I like this beer. Thank you Abita, you have redeemed yourself again."
"D - Nice and easy beer that can be enjoyed pretty much anytime."
"This beer surprised me, as it was a rowdy frat boy that suggested it to me. Very nice head, stood up to the test of time, and even though it was served slightly warm, the flavor was still decent. Chocolaty taste, with hints of a nuttiness to it. Drank from a standard pint glass, and lacing was not present at all that I could see."
"Much lighter than expected for this style. Dark raisin bread and cocoa powder flavors are rich. There is a persistant hop freshness. Finish is sweet but not cloying. I appreciate this beer's delicate nature. Highly drinkable."
"Overall, definitely the best beer I have had from Abita. Subtle and tasty, would be a fine session brew, or a nice pairing with a burger or grilled steak"
"Not anything I'm going out of the way to try again. This is a polar opposite in quality of their Andygator that I had at the beginning of the night."
"Pours with a dark brown color, fizzy head that diminishes quickly. Has a pungent smell, roasted malts and coffee are the most prominent. Has a mostly coffee taste, I didn't really think the blend mixes well for an ale. Overall is a sharp beer that finishes lighter than I expected. An interesting beer, but not one I would want to drink all night."
"Had this beer at O' C's. The dark, deep brown beer was poured into a pint glass. The aroma smelled more of a malty style of beer with tints of caramel. When tasting the beer it is well established malt taste with a slight cooking chocolate, brown sugar and plums. As I neared the bottom of the glass a bitter taste was present. Overall a decent beer to have with pizza but nothing that I would drink alone without a pairing."
"Pours a deep, dark brown with ruby highlights and light tan head. The aroma is not particularly strong, but seems more malty than hoppy - a bit of caramel and bread crust. The taste, again, is malt dominant. A light, generalized roasted flavor with hints of brown sugar and dates. The carbonation is appropriate, and the body is a bit light compared to the appearance. I would not classify this beer as an English brown at all - it resembles more of an American black lager. The drinkability is very good - I could easily drink several more if in the mood."
"D: not a whole lot going on in this beer"
"Drinkability: I never want another one of these. If someone offers it to me, I'll say ""No thanks, but I will take a glass of water."" At least it's not a heavy beer. It's motto should be ""Bad taste, less filling."""
"Abita Turbodog is very sessionable which is typical with most Abita beers. Although this particular beer is very complexed in flavors. Overall it is a really nice beer and well worth trying."
"I though it was a porter but brown is definitely a better description. Very drinkable, dark brown, lowish carbonation but in general a very decent brown ale."
"The beer is translucent and has a dark ruby color. It reminds me of cranberry juice. There was no head, but it was poured for me by a bartender who doesn't look like a beer guy (i.e. someone who probably thinks head = bad). There is a slightly malty aroma, but I can't detect must else. As I said above, this beer is very cold, so that may be a limiting factor. The beer tastes like sweet, dark fruit. There is a little bitterness in the finish. I can't taste much else, but as I said, it has been served way too cold. It has an above medium body and a good amount of carbonation. Despite it not performing well when served at a cold temperature, the Turbodog is a good beer. I like it a lot and could order a few of them (but probably not at this bar). If I get the chance to have another, I'll submit a new review of the beer at the correct serving temperature."
"Drinkability: while this beer is somewhat tasty, I feel like its acidity is really going to impact how much of it I can drink. Maybe it would be better if consumed with soda bread or somesuch."
"Value: Pricey for what it is."
"This poured a dark, caramel-like color. It held an inch-thick creamy caramel colored head for about 2 minutes. Nice lacing. It smelled hoppy, but also with a hint of roasted nuts and chocolate. It was a bit watery in the mouth. I was expecting something thicker. The taste is worth the expense and it is definately an easy drink. I really enjoyed the aftertaste (smokey, chocolatey). My take: give it a whirl!"
"Another offering from Abita that offers a somewhat tentative approach to the style. Nice, yet a bit inconspicuous; though likely befitting of the climate of Louisiana."
"Turbodog is not overly complex, but it totally fits the bill of an English Brown flavor-wise and sessionability. Not outstanding within the world of extreme beers, but overall just a tasty, easy drinking brown ale, which I would consider a success."
"D - I found this beer a bit odd on the pallet but I would drink again."
"D - It's not hard to drink, but the taste is just offensive enough with that much sugar to keep me from doing a lot of it."
"Overall: I feel really neutral about this one. I found the slight sourness strange but tolerable. I didn't some out with high expectations and that's how it turned out."
"D - I'm actually pretty impressed by this beer. This (to me anyways) should be the flagship of the Abita line. I enjoyed this beer immensely and will be picking more up in the future."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable, smooth."
"Personally there are times I crave a nice mild brown ale that isn't overwhelming to the palate. This beer fills the bill. Smells mildly of chocolate. The beer itself tastes grassy, with hints of nuttiness and chocolate. Drinkability is ok, but its finish was sort of bland Found out afterr freezing the bottle this is one to rink warm, might have to rereview it after drinking a sort of warm bottle."
"Brownish pour, can't really identify any identifiable aroma or smell. Not the typical chocolate or coffee flavors you might see in darker colored beers. Not really a sweet beer, just kind of bland. Sorry guys."
"Overall, drinks more like a lager than an ale, but I would return again (and I have since writing this review). A solid B+."
"Nice dark brow color. Smaller head with brown tint. Good roasted malt smell and taste with a decent sweetness, but lacks finish. I found the flavor to be good and strong while in the mouth but very faint and lacking taste after you swallow. Overall a decent beer but fell short of my high hopes."
"One of Abitas best but I usually lose interest at about 1 1/2 due to sugar overload."
"Certainly an interesting beer - flavors all over the place. That works well for me in a EBA."
"From a 12 oz bottle courtesy of a trading partner in Illinois this poured a muddy brown color with as moderate sized brown head and light lacing. Nose of lightly roasted malts, and some floral hops. Light aroma overall. Mouthfeel is light and just short of watery. Flavor shows coffee and chocolate and a little ripe fruit. Not much in the finish. While this is quite drinkable I like my browns to not be quite so bland."
"Purchased at beer store. Very dark brown color with some red tint showing through. Thick dark tan head. Aroma was of yeast, bread, and sweet with a touch of caramel, very pleasant. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. Flavor was bread, caramel, and a bit of chocolate. Very tasty. Finish was smooth and well balanced with no aftertaste. Overall a teriffic beer!"
"Drinkability: A pretty tasty brown ale. Looks and smells a lot better than it tastes but still not bad. Worth a try."
"Very drinkable. I wasn't too impressed with Purple Haze, but this is pretty nice. I would definately grab it again."
"This a beer I would drink anytime I felt like a brown"
"I dunno... I used to really like this one, and it's still a decent beer, but I think I'll stick to it on tap at the bars and not spend money to bring them home."
"Drink OH YA, this is one drinkable beer. I want a lot more of these."
"The taste is light prune-raisin alcohol, slightly caramelised whole wheat bread, light earthy-leafy bitterness with light sweetness. Overall, it's tasty but rather bland and a bit non-descript. It has the faintest hint of coffee. Lightly sweet up front, it has a finish leaning slightly to the bitter side with a bittersweet aftertaste. The feel is good, firm but not thick or oily and yet not quite lively."
"This beer IS New Orleans. Turbodog has a great rich flavor, a deep musky aroma, and a huge-ass head. Yet with all that, it goes down as smoothly as any lite beer, strange, no? Found at basically any cajun restaurant this is a great sidearm to bring into battle with that spicy jambalaya, or spicy anything for that matter. Turbodog quenches thirst like fucking gatorade. Even though its one of the darker brewskis I enjoy, I can still put back more than a few because of its superior drinkability, Bud Lites got nothing on this baby!"
"Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into a shaker glass. Appears a deep brown color with a good inch of fluffy light tan foam. Nose and flavors consist of milk chocolate, toffee, caramelized malt, medium roasted grains, cocoa powder, faint hints of coffee. Decent, somewhat rich body for the style with ample carbonation. Pretty nice."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, a bit malty. Taste is of malts with hints of chocolate and coffee. Feels good in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this makes for a pretty good choice."
"(D)- A solid to great brown ale that is surprisingly smooth. Simply tasty and an easy drinking beer when you want something a bit darker than the norm. Nice overall light to medium bodied beer."
"There is not much going on here. Poured a dark brown with a respectable head with good retention. Looked good for a fast start. No aroma! OK, a lot of good beers don't. Slowed going into the first corner. What! No taste either! Alright, there is some coffee, but not much. Almost came to a stop in the second turn. Feel is barely medium with decent carbonation. Limping through the third turn. Drinkability? Who cares! No kick left for the finish. Overall, not horrible, but bland and disappointing."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a dark brown close to black color with a tan frothy head with some nice lacing to the glass. You can see the dark brown on the edges when held up to the light. Smells of chocolate aroma and roasted malts similar to a porter, but not very strong. Taste again much similar to the smell, slight smokey taste at the end with the slightest hint of hops. I found the mouthfeel to be quite pleasant on this beer, very crisp and refreshing for such a dark colored brew. The drinkability is outstanding in this beer. All in all a very good beer. The waitress told me it was a porter when she brought it and a good one at that. I was surprised to find that it's really an English Brown Ale. I enjoyed it overall. It looks and tastes very similar to a porter, but certainly has the drinkability and mouthfeel of an ale. Could be quite the neutral crowd-pleaser at a gathering of picky beer drinkers."
"D - Brewed for drinkability, this brown ale has it going on. The appearance and flavor are there putting it into the drink-all-day category. Another good brew from Abita."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin and lacks alot of complexity but overall is pretty smooth and easy to drink"
"An interesting all around beer for sure. A session lover indeed."
"Mouthfeel is silky and not in the least bit overcarbonated. Drinks easy and I would definitely see myself buying this one in the future."
"Pours a dark brown colored body, clearish in the light. Huge foamy tan colored head, very lasting. Roasty aroma, some nuttiness. Some funky, dusty aroma, reminiscent of all Abita's beers. Maybe the spring water. Some fruitiness too. Not a strong aroma. Fruity taste, maybe strawberry. Along with some maltiness, nuttiness too. Some roasted flavors. Watery palate. Some fruitiness, like strawberry. Tasty."
"T: Probably not the greatest example of a Brown Ale, but a solid one. And, personally, there is not a better beer out there to match up with a bowl of gumbo or a crawfish boil. Very easy to drink. Pairs well with food."
"D - While there are better browns out there this was solid and I enjoyed it. Probably the best Abita beer I have had so far."
"D - Good beer, caught between a brown ale and stout"
"I wouldn't return specifically for the beer but the food was really good. Now they just need to serve a beer that can stand up to the spice and flavor."
"Brown in color with substantial foam on the head. Slight bit of prickle. Very faint malt nose, but almost undetectable. The attack is refreshing and pretty clean with a quick presentation of the malt flavor. There seems to be a hint of anise. There is some odd quality to the malt that makes it stand out from other beers that I have tried. I cannot quite place it, but it distracts me a bit. Overall however, I find the beer to be pretty standard and average as far as brown ales go."
"Drinks very well, definite session goodness."
"Pours clear, dark, red-brown with a huge lingering head with thick lacing. Aroma of sweet malts. Flavor is nothing surprising, with medium body and carbonation. Notes of malt and a touch of hops. Overall not bad at all, just not really my thing. Probably better consumed a little colder than I typically drink dark beers."
"Visuals are a dark brown. Virtually opaque. Smell molases, woodiness, toasty, hints of coffee. Taste is close to smell. The woodiness flavor is more pronounced with a bitter chocolate backbone. Hints of malt and very little after taste. Very little lacing with just a rim head. Drinkabilty is somewhat decent but doesnt have the burst of taste like the stronger ABV drinks do. However, the overall consumption is smoother with a nice chocolaty finish. This is no means on my top list but is a nice interpetation of a nice brown ale."
"D.) I like this beer, but I can only have one of these in a seating."
"D: My first Abita, a pretty average experience. Very different brown, unique in it's own way and I enjoyed it as such. Still, this was a bit too sweet and chocolatey for my taste, thus it's probably not a brew I'd recco going out of your way for. Still, if you're looking for something unique and it's in your area, give it a shot."
"D - A little too bitter to drink a lot without feeling sick. Great for desert and maybe a cold winter day, but I wouldn't recommend this for much else."
"D: I really wanted to like this beer, but in the end it just makes me wish I had a stout instead. The lack of body is obvious and really detrimental to the brew. I am having a hard time seperating my own preferences on this one. I think that Abita may have just taken the style a little too far. Would not drink another one."
"All in all, this is a highly palateable dark brew. If more were like this I'd drink them more often!"
"D - We did a blind tasting of 7 browns, and this tied for 3rd."
"Drinkability: This is a very different tasting brown and I wanted to like it better than I ultimately did"
"A deep amber/brown color body with a foamy three finger off white head,medium carbonation. Aroma is toasty,slightly grainy with lots of unsweetened choclate . Flavor is mostly of slightly burnt unsweetened choclate with a little kiss of hop spice and a bit of toffee at the end. A somewhat watery body but very nice feeling in the mouth ,very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beers body is light. Carbonation is active but works really well with the beer. The beer left my glass quickly. I could easily spend an evening drinking nothing but Turbo Dog."
"A good dark ale. If you're a fan of this style, this is a must-try. Wouldn't be hard to drink a few in a row."
"Bitterness shows up quite a bit more in the flavor as the sweetness subsides and the cocoa and toasty notes become more pronounced. It's pretty good, but feels like something is missing or out of balance here. Perhaps too much toasty malt and not enough nuttiness and sweetness. Not bad, but the flavors dont really do it for me."
"D: Not bad for a brown ale. I would probably stick to my other favorites rather than have this one again; however, it is what it is."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Overall, a decent drinker but nothing that really impressed me."
"MF&D - Medium bodied. Went down well. A quality brown ale."
"Very nice looking beer. Poured it into a pint glass and got a nice little creamy head with a dark brown body. Smells nice of caramel and a bit of molasses. Taste is nice roasty caramel flavor and a bit of hop bitterness at the end. Overall it wasn't as robust of a flavor as I was expecting. Mouthfeel was carbonated and light in body, I was hoping for a bit more creamy feel to it. This beer is nicely sessionable and the 5.6% is not apparent. Decent beer but it won't be part of my regular line up"
"Overall this was an ok beer that i don't think lived up to all the hype. I wouldn't go out of my way to get this beer again."
"M - Very smooth with a medium weight. Leaves the mouth slightly dry. Drinkability is high enough that I drink it after runs."
"I had the beer with a fish stick sandwich and peas (a poor man's fish and chips, minus the chips) and this beer I think goes better with beef or poultry rich in flavor rather than fish. Still, very good and since I have a six pack, I'll have to try it with some other meals and see how it does."
"D- Like I said, this was an interesting beer. That means it would be good for a couple beers, but I definitely wouldn't session this. I enjoyed it for one bottle, but I doubt this will be a regular for me."
"There's dates along the edges of the back label, but nothing is actually marked... How useless..."
"Poured a dark reddish-brown body, almost black. One finger head the color of Coca-Cola fizz slowly drops. It smells a bit like caramel and tootsie rolls. Sweet, thin bodied, with a nice floral hop presence and a light bitterness on the finish."
"It didn't exactly knock my socks off but, I'd still recomend trying it."
"Pretty good, but I feel the beer is looking for a home. Like a lost porter, mixed with a weak stout, married to a strong brown ale."
"D: This is where this one really suffers. Just not something I'd like to have more than one of, although it does have some fine points."
"D- drinkable, did drink six of them just hanging out."
"I may have to give it a second chance."
"D- Sweet and full of flavor, yet has a very drinkable quality found in many brown ales."
"d- a very light brown ale, i could drink a million of these."
"Because of the little carbonation it is drinkable, goes down easy. There are some bumps, which are appreciated, but still disappointed. Perhaps it was a bad batch..."
"Drinkability- I have to say I truely believe I had bad batch here, i had this on tap recently and I really liked it, this one was not very drinkable at all but i will with out a doubt give it one more shot, bummer not fun to waste 8 bucks, to be re reviewed..."
"Overall this is one of the better Abita beers that I've had, second only to their Jockamo IPA. Worth a shot."
"Not bad. Good rendition of English Brown."
"Pours brown with a nice creamy head. Looks very inviting, good head retention. The head is actually quite amazing. This is a really sweet brown ale, lots of toffee with a hint of chocolate. Moutfeel suffers from being too ""sodalike"" and definitely not very British. This would be a great beer to have at the brewpub fresh and probably a nice intro beer to new craft beer drinkers."
"I have to give this beer credit for being complex. I just think this one's a little bit too complex for me. The chocolate malt is very prevalent and the taste is a mixture of coffee and chocolate. Aftertaste is very smooth but the initial taste has some bitter flavors that I didn't like. Pours a pitch black with a pretty impressive head that sticks around for a while. No lacing on the sides of the glass however. Smells like roasted coffee. Overall it's a decent brew but not something I would buy."
"D 3.5 - Almost bock like, a good rich example of the style. I also like the New Orleans memories that come with an Abita brew (Turbo Dog leads the pack). Not my favorite style so my drinkability score is lower than it could be."
"A full beer with some bite. But it's the bite of something bitter, maybe the coating of an aspirin. ? The beer looks thick and frothy, like a mouth-full of sea foam. And the first time I had it was at a local bar here in town. My friend recommended it, so I tried it. And I liked it quite a bit. So I went back for more recently. But this time, it was coming in fresh, not following another beer. And this time, well, it stood up as a strong brown bitter beer, but maybe a bit overboard on the strong beer part."
"Beer is good but not the best brown ale i've had. Would have liked a thicker body with bolder flavors but overall goes down easily and very drinkable"
"Drinkability- This is one I could drink all night, possibly a good session beer."
"Poured into 12oz glass. Poured a very deep, dark brown, almost black, with over an inch of deep tan head that left a moderate amount of semi-sticky lacing. Solid malt aroma that has roast notes upfront with a hint of sweetness. The flavor meets the expectations that the aroma sets with the roasted grain flavors dominating a slightly sweet finish. Full, well-rounded body that goes down smoothly. Easily drinkable, having several will leave you happily satisfied. Try this beer."
"Overall: The mouth feel is medium light body and lot of carbonation. The finish is bitter and is medium. I have been worried about trying this beer from what I have heard from other people. I know that is not an excuse to drink a beer. I am sorely disappointed in this beer. The nose on this beer was awesome and made my mouth wate. I was looking forward to drinking this beer, but the taste is nothing like the nose. It is not malty or sweet like an English Brown Ale. Oh well, life goes on."
"Fairly dark brown, with light brown head. smell the malts, not real strong though. med mouthfeel. Taste malts but not real heavy on them, so not REAL sweet, some bitter hops in there make it pretty balanced, nice brew, nothing that sets this apart as exceptional, but a solid beer nonetheless. Pretty good for the price point also."
"A dark, rich midnight black in color, pour showed a small head, decent lacing and retention. This one smelled of caramel, nutmeg, chocolate, and a bit of espresso bean. Taste was a bit metallic, don't know if it was the bottle or what but it tasted a bit like licking the side of a bridge. Although the good properties of the beer are the nice maltiness and the small bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, decent carbonation. Overall, I can't say I enjoyed this too much because of that metallic afterburn, if it was just the bottle I had then this is a very good Brown ale you should seek out."
"It has a very malt and chocolate taste to it. It's got a bitterness to it that turns somewhat sour. I had it off the tap in the past and felt it was better. In a bottle, it's OK."
"Drinkability: This brown ale is a little too bitter for me. It tasted like a wannabe oatmeal stout -- a turbo brown. Still, it's a decent brew."
"This beer really caught me by surprise. I pulled it out of a mish-mash box and didn't really expect too much. The label is not particularly intriguing, in fact there is nothing really to indicate you'd be drinking anything but an average beer. I didn't go in with respect for the beer, having prejudged it, and carelessly threw down a swig. I immediately realized my error. A delicious, sweet chocolaty taste that is far from overbearing, with a medium carbonation and moderate - but effective - aftertaste. Traditional malty smell but not particularly roasted. Quite the undervalued and overlooked beer."
"The pour looked good: a dark brown with amber hues, and a nice, fluffy dark-tan head. The smell was of dark malts, nuts (especially chestnuts), and a pinch of bitter hops. The smell was strong and pleasant, and I could catch a whiff of it with the glass sitting on the table a few feet away. The taste was similar to the smell: a great mix of malts, which were simultaneously dark (chocolate), nutty, and sweet (toffee and brown sugar), plus a dash of hop bitterness to round it off and balance the flavor. The beer is well carbonated, and it has a medium mouthfeel. The beer is very drinkable: sweet (but not too sweet), smooth, tasty, not filling, and refreshing."
"D: Good. Tasty and smooth."
"well, not as easy to drink as newcastle but probably more tasty. if I was a big fan of the style it might be better, but as is it is a very decent if unspectacular brew."
"D: Good. Light in heft yet with solid brown-type flavors make this one easily sessionable. I'd definitely get this again as a session brown."
"Drinkability: This is one of Abita's better offerings that I have tasted so far...If the ABV was not as high, I would session it...I will be getting this again"
"A excellent example of a English Brown Ale."
"Drinkability: A nice brown ale. Not as sweet as I've come to find in brown ales, but very enjoyable."
"First impressions on this one are mixed. It looked great in my glass, but the taste (for me anyway) was fairly unremarkable. Still, this strikes me as a decent cold weather brew."
"one of the easier brown ales to put back, not too sweet (as many are) the over 6% ABV isn't apparent so be careful, however i drank this before dinner so it went down exceptionally quickly."
"D: Could definitely drink a few of these, which I did while watching football."
"Nikki"
"A good dark ale, malt flavor is tasty. Pretty brown color. Smell is very pleasing."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied and in carbonation. Not a favorite style but it seems like a solid choice."
"D - This is a good drinkable brown to me."
"So far this seems to be the best of the bunch."
"Bottle pour into shaker. brown with moderate tan head - good lacing throughout. Roasted, sweet malts, caramel & chocolate flavors. A bit above average. Maybe I this beer was touted too much by a few family members, but to me it was nothing special."
"They have 2 bottles of this in the party pack and that's about where I would cap it off on this one. Between this and the other ""flagships"" offered in the pack (Amber, Light, Purple Haze...) I'd say this is my favorite. Nothing overly special but still nice to have 1 or 2 of every now and then. Probably one of Abita's better offerings."
"Though not the best, it is a nice example of the style, and it is one of the best from Abita that I have tried."
"d- One of the better brown ales I've had! A nice, rich, fairly complex flavor that is well rounded and very, very drinkable."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a dark brown with red highlights(when held up to a light). The head is about 2 fingers of white fluff, when it recedes it leaves thick lacing all over the pint. The aroma is very light. A bit of a roasted character is all I detect. The flavor is mostly bitter sweet chocolate, not overly sweet. The finish is crisp. The brew is light in body and highly carbonated. A very drinkable beer that would go well with most foods."
"M = Great mouthcoating, good medium body, only drawback is a slight sting on the tongue."
"Pours with minimal head but does leave some lacing behind, black to dark brown-orange in hue, doesn't seem ""opaque"" but is. Toasty, malty nose, on the whole not very expressive, clean as the spring water component shines through, carob, mild graininess, sweetness in check with only a breeze of hops. Medium-bodied, however, comes across as watery and semi-dilute, very initial impression of warm chocolate cake, coffee and marzipan falls off a cliff by the mid-palate. Solid jolt of carbonation tries to waken the patient. Also appears to shuffle towards an uptick of bitterness at the end but doesn't quite get there. Decent graininess, not flawed or nothing, just boring."
"This beer poured a ruby brown color and was topped off with a very creamy. Good carbonation. There's some roastiness and caramel notes in the aroma, but overall weak in that regard. Is this a porter or a brown ale? I'm not sure I could distinguish, but it doesn't matter because the flavor is very pleasant. Roasted chocolate, toffee, burnt coffee come through with a nice underlying bitterness. Very drinkable and well made."
"I would buy this again and would love to session it."
"Highly recommended beer and I will make a it a staple. Can;t understand the b rating. It's a easy A"
"This beer surprised me and was very interesting. I would definitely recommend it and try it again."
"Pours a nice mahogany/chestnut color, with reddish highlights when held to light, foamy tan head fades into a fine film on top of the beer, a few spots of lacing here and there. Nice roasty aromas, cocoa powder, some toffee. Some bitter coffee flavors, more cocoa, biscuity/doughy. This is something I'd never turn down, and would be an easy go-to beer at the dinner table. Nice one!"
"The taste is quite nice. There is ample caramel malts, roasted brown malts, some hop balance in the finish that rounds out the smoothness. The beer is light to medium bodied, slightly refreshing, and a nice beer overall."
"In all, not a bad beer--not one I'll go far and wide to get, but I say that as much about the style, which has never been very high on my list, as about the beer. Not bad, and worthy of a shot."
"Pours a dark mahogany with a decent, cream-colored head that is not too persistent. Aroma is strong and malty with just a hint of miso and fruit - maybe lemon. Flavor lives up to the promise of the aroma and color, being fairly strong and malty with an undertone of caramel and just a slip of sweetness. Texture is tingly and smooth, leaving a satisfying finish."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a black color that is amber when held to the light. One inch head that goes down quick with no lacing. Very malty aroma that smells like chocolate and bread. Also has tastes of chocolate, caramel, and toasted grains. The beer is a bit overcarbonated, but it is one of the only non-watery Abita beers. Easy to have 3 or 4 in a sitting."
"Being a lover of brown ales, this is a go-to beer for me. It's not overly complex, but it packs a whole lot of flavor for such a small ale. I'm almost surprised that this isn't classified as an ABA. I'd like to see an Imperial version of this beer called Turbogod, btw."
"Overall this is a decent example of a brown ale, although I would probably not go out of my way to purchase it again. Nothing about the beer jumps out at me as being particularly memorable."
"Not bad, not great. Just okay. I would drink it again but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"This brew has good atmosphere, and alot of flavor. Complex nose. Really good drinkability. . . good quaff."
" Abv might be a bit high for the style. Drinkability is quite good. The tastiest Abita product thus far."
"All in all, very drinkable, and very enjoyable, especially since I picked this one up without even reading the label or knowing the style."
"I tried Turbodog at the Bourbon Street Distillery in downtown Indy. It is a great place to have a beer before the Colts game. This brew is malty! It is very dark in color with a rich flavor and brisk hop finish. Its so good, we came back and had another!"
"D= A decent beer and probably one of the few brown ales that I like well enough to have again. Definitely worth a try!"
"Pours a dark mahogany with a two-finger tan head. Scent is toasted malts with faint chocolate. The taste is strong of coffee, chocolate & toasted malt. Mouthfeel is more carbonated than I expected, not real thick. This is a drinkable beer that's not too filling, however, the high carbonation is a little much."
"D: Grows on you as it warms in your glass getting a bit more spicier as it warms. A great brew. Try one on."
"The aroma roasty and nutty. The taste was crisp up front then finished with a malty sweetness. In the mouth it was pretty lively then left maltiness on the tongue. Not a bad English Brown but a step below the Samuel Smith's."
"D - This beer really tasted good, although it was not what I expected when I saw a Brown Ale, none the less it was good. Still, I have to dock points for the carbonation levels in this beer"
"Best of the Abita beers."
"D - Drinkable, but not overly memorable... Enjoyable, and I would gladly welcome another pint, though I'm not sure I'll seek out to purchase..."
"Notes from 12/28/07"
"The aroma has toasted malt, raisins, caramel, paper, and basement smells. The appearance is dark red brown with a large foamy head. The flavor has toasted malt, chocolate, nuts and some paper. A nice beer overall but the palate is a little thin and the taste has paper to distract from the positive qualities."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: As I've already stated this beer is highly drinkable, I can now see why this is Abita's flagship beer. Turbodog has a medium body with lower carbonation that fits with the rest of the beer. Nothing outstanding about the way that this one feels, nothing ""wowing"" just average-good, as it should be. This is one that I can see myself picking up again. A great beer, easy to drink, nice to session, and one of the better Abita beers in my opinion, I believe that this is their best beer."
"I can see why my wife liked this so much. I like it too."
"Overall: If they were to ever make a souped-up version of this ale and call it an Old Ale or a Barleywine, I'd be over the moon. Turbodog is great, though. Surprisingly easy-drinking for its heaviness and its strength. Dynamite with a range of foods, too, everything from oven-roasted eggplant to white chocolate challah bread pudding."
"Purchased a single in Solvang California. Poured dark brown with a small frothy head. Head disappeared after the first miniute or so. It smells and tastes of chocolate and toffee with some woodiness I thought. Finshes somewhat smooth. I would recommend this beer to anyone who likes Browns."
"Taste and mouthfeel: Pretty drinkable, though short on flavor. It has the feel and taste of a flat cola without the sugar and all the acid. This is my first tasting of an Abita beer and it will no doubt be the last time I buy a beer from them."
"Serving: bottle"
"12oz bottle. Pours a murky dark brown body with a thin film of light tan head. Smells very malty, with caramel, toffee, and brown sugar ruling - very pleasing. Tastes like caramel, toffee, and brown sugar, with some hints at chocolate and coffee. On the lighter side of medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Extremely drinkable, definitely disappears before I'm ready to see it go. A flavorful quaffable easy drinking beer. One I'll definitely be getting again - one of the finest brown ales I've had, and definitely makes me think twice about the quality of beers in the South - awesome brew!"
"Mouthfeel is ok."
"I can't really find anything wrong here. This is one that we used to enjoy in college (as a special treat) and it still doesn't disappoint."
"D ~ This is my first official review of the style. That being said, I have nothing to compare it to. I enjoyed this beer... It's affordable, widely distributed and something I could drink with some regularity. Certainly worth checkin' out if you can."
"Pours a very dark reddish brown with a medium tan head. Smell is of ripe fruit. Taste is quite malty, with hints of chocolate and tobacco. There is also a touch of earthy flavor from the hops. Nice bitterness that clings to your tongue. Mouthfeel is good, carbonation slightly high. Drinkability is good, this is a good beer, a nice example of an English Brown Ale, but a bit on the high side of ABV."
"Notes: One of my personal favorites and my go to English brown ale. A pleasure to have."
"D-Quite good. It's too bad I lost so much on the kitchen floor."
"D: IMO, it is a great brown ale and perfect for a quality session. Needless to say, even better on tap. It is one of my favorites from back in the day and just seeing the bottle or hearing the name gives me a good vibe. Perhaps my personal history, coupled with the region, lend me to be a little bias. However, for these personal reasons, and the fact I firmly believe it is a solid around beer, I would proudly put it in my top ten. Additionally, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a very accessible and unique beer from a great brewery."
"From the depths of the South came this bottle of suds. Into my pint glass it poured a deep brown with a thick tan head, with good retention and great lacing. The nose was semi-sweet like chocolate chips accompanied by some bread, toffee and caramel notes. The flavors were similar but the sweetness took a back seat. Biscuit malt and bittersweet chocolate a la baking along with some hoppy bitterness on the finish. Medium to full bodied and well carbonated. A good beer for the style (an English Brown Ale) and quite sessionable."
"Flavor though is quite nice though. This my first beer of this style, and I enjoyed it quite nicely. A very nice chocolate toffee creamy goodness. A touch of bitterness at the end. All around, I would definitely drink a few of these."
"Candy indeed."
"I enjoyed this one with a spicy bowl of Jumbalaya, you should too."
"Fairly mouth filling, but not cloying in any way. Good carbonation present. I enjoyed it, but with the selection at hand, I went on to a different brew. I think I could do a couple, but that's it. Very good beer overall."
"The hoppiness reminds me more of an American Brown than an English one, as does the slightly elevated alcohol content. A good beer with the veggie pizza I ate with it, though a more traditional brown ale would probably have paired better. Still, Turbodog is a decent quaffer, and is duly well-known abroad here in the US."
"Drinkability: A nice overall chill and unwind beer."
"Served in a tumbler. Poured dark brown with red highlights at the base of the glass. 1.5 inch fluffy, off-white head that gradually collapsed into a dense half inch cap in under a minute before settling into a mere slick. Some strands of lacing which gradually slid down the sides of the glass back into the brew. Nose is predominantly chocolate malt with perhaps a light floral hops aroma at the back. Taste consistent with nose, but chocolate is not as sweet as the nose insinuated; pleasantly bittersweet and earthy. Mouthfeel falls between light-and medium-bodied with a balanced amount of carbonation and a touch of bitterness at the finish to remind you what you just drank. Nice example of the style and very drinkable."
"Poured a dark brown with ruby tints that you could see when held up to light. A semi-tan, one-finger head that died at a medium pace and left some lacing. A sweet smell, like coffee, cocoa, caramel, honey, toffee...can't put my finger on it. Hint of hop spice too. A tad syrupy as it passed my tongue, but I'd still say it had a strong, medium body that wasn't overpowering and had some mild sweetness in it. Definitely some chocolate and a hint of coffee/roasted malt for a semi-dry backbite, although the backbite also had a little fruitiness to it. Hit me like a chewy, bready, doughy goodness, that backbite did. A good beer and better than the overhyped Purple Haze."
"overall, this is a decent brew, i think ill revisit it some time"
"Grape juice, this beer tastes like grape juice. Not entirely, but that's the dominant flavor. I checked the label to see if maybe this beer was past the best-by, but the date markings on the edge of the label were unnotched. Oh well. In addition to the Concorde grapes, there's also a dry cocoa flavor, so really this beer tastes like Welch's grape juice with Nestle Quik."
"this beer is a nice dark brown and looks chocolatey on it's pour. The nose and taste follow suit: it doesn't have a ton of flavor or aroma but what is there is choclatey and malty. The taste is sort of dark/bitter, dry chocolatey and has malty notes, the hop balances this off though and keeps it from approaching the too-sweet range, though the hops used aren't anything known for writing home about. The mouth is pretty moderate with a good amount of carbonation and you really notice the bitter chocolate in the aftertaste. Drinkability is just a bit above average, it's def. not bad, but doesn't really make you want to drink more. The restraint on the chocolate and sweetness is really it's most impressive point."
"D: A nice beer overall. Worth a revisit down the road."
"Medium bodied brew, but it came across a little flat. Overall, a fairly good beer, that I'm not so sure I got the best representation of. I will definitely try this again."
"D - A flavorful brew, but the mouthfeel didn't wholly suit the tastes going on and the bitterness was a little rougher than what I'd look for in a brown ale."
"It's a dark malty beer with a less-filling profile. Easily drinkable. Would go nicely with a steak. a yummy brown ale!"
"Drinkability: Very easy drink and great interpretation of the style. A must try brown ale."
"This poured up a nice muddy brown with some dark red highlights,a thick milk chocolate looking head builds to a fingers worth before deflating to a thin covering,with no lace left behind. The nose is thin and malty with some very faint vinilla notes. This has some good nutty flavors as well as bitter chocolate and subtle dry oat tendencies. The body is a bit to thin as well as some understated carbonation makes it just slightly above average at best. The alcohol seems well hidden,I was a bit suprised to see the AVB above six. A decent offering to enjoy once or twice maybe,never going to be a regular in my glass."
"Cheers..."
"It's a dark malty beer with a less-filling profile. Easily drinkable. Would go nicely with a steak."
"D: Decent...a little too overwhelming to consume regularly"
"D, notes: As someone previously said in a review ""a nice little session beer"". I would agree. Easy to drink and the price is right."
"D - it's ok."
"This is a brown ale that will deliver on expectations of the English Brown Ale style, yet probably will not surprise anyone with a resounding ""Wow"" or anything like that. A solid example of the style. It is refreshing and I will buy more."
"D-I like it. Quite easy to drink. I am impressed because I am not drawn to this style."
"Drinkability: It's crisp for such a malty beer and the alcohol is entirely manageable, but the flavors and complexities aren't too terribly interesting. Again, not bad by any stretch of the imagination, and definitely worth trying at least once."
"The feel of the drink is on the thin side of medium-bodied with a clean finish. Easy drinker."
""
"This is a smooth, full-bodied beer that is a little sweet and nicely balanced as a dark brown ale."
"Drinkability: This is a solid brown ale that I would enjoy again."
"Mouthfeel is great, with some zesty carbonation. Very drinkable. I can't believe it's above 6%. What does this brew normally cost?"
"Smooth, easy to drink and reasonably flavorful, this one is easy to share at parties. A gateway beer."
"A great combination of flavor variety and character balanced make this highly drinkable. Only downside is just a notch too low of flavor intensity for my liking, which also seemed to contradict the appearance."
"Not as full-flavored as some of the other Abita offerings, but decent."
"D- Not bad, but I won't go out of my way for this one. It pretty much drinks like a lighter beer but looks like a porter. Its rather odd in my opinion."
"D: A decent drinkable brew."
"Flavorful and smooth brown ale."
"very nice smell. Hazelnut, coffee, chocolate. Nice Red color, thick head. A very tasty brown ale with tastes of chocolate, malt, candy sugar, some ripe fruits. Finish has a slight taste of hops. Nice smooth brown ale, very nutty, very good. Not too shabby."
"D: The light body makes it quite drinkable, but the lackluster flavor development is disappointing. Still, I've almost put the whole thing down in 3 minutes--a quaffable brown ale for sure."
"http://jbojangles.blogspot.com/2008/05/twelve-pack-review-abita-party-pack.html"
"Drinkability is fairly high as the alcohol is relatively low and flavors are pretty easy to consume. A nice little session beer."
"Ok folks this hits a Southern English Brown well. Some off flavors, too strong in ABV, and a bit hoppy for that style but hey."
" This is a very clean tasting brew, purhaps it's the ""pristine artisian waters"" the Brewery claims to use? Whatever it is, it's a nice effect."
"Overall I thought this brew was surely unique and did enjoy it, however couldn't drink more than couple."
"D- easy to put this down which surprises me. I like it but i have had better dark brews."
"D: Because it is so thin, it is easily drinkable. The ABV will catch up with you after a few, but I can drink this. It is nothing spectacular but it is a good beer."
"O- I actually found this one to be pretty easy drinking. A solid offering, and a good example of an American-made brown. Simple and unoffensive."
"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner dark brown with ruby hue's. Nice pour with a 1/2 inch tan head. Hints of roasted malt and toffee in the smell. The taste is sweet with hints of brown sugar and molasses followed by a decent nutty flavor. Creamy mouth feel with minimal carbonation. Nice drinkable beer definitely worth trying."
"D - Not a bad beer but there are better beer out there within the style. Will finish this six pack off, but will probably not pick up again."
"D: I am not a bit English Brown Ale fan so I had to fight not to abuse the brewer for my taste buds. However, I felt the watery mouthfeel, thin and unbalanced flavors and sour aftertaste took away from what could have been an interesting beer. It was a beauty coming out of the bottle but that was the highlight."
"Jarlsberg and Wildflower Cheddar."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, upon first glance this beer was very dark, nearly black. Held up to the light I saw a lovely ruby red hue. Very nice head that stuck around. Smells sweet with a hint of fruit. Kind of like a fruity coffee. But the taste doesn't live up to the aroma. A little on the boring side. The most noticable taste seems to be that of the alcohol. Not bad, but I expected a little more flavor from this brown ale. That being said, it is not too heavy in the mouth and not too light. Overall not bad. I could see it as a good session beer for a dark ale."
"Dark brown colored ale with a thick foamy head.Aroma is dominated by nuttiness.Taste is nutty,biscuit and toffee.This ale is as smooth as ice from the first to last sip with no bitter aftertaste.I will definetly buy this again and recommend to my buddies.one of the better brown ales I've had in a while!!"
"Worth a try..."
"D - The smell and color are nice, but the taste and mouthfeel make this beer undrinkable."
"D- This is an easy drinker. The first craft brews that I liked were brown ales and I still don't mind kicking them back."
"Drinkability: Yeah, could drink a few, but there are other things out there."
"A dark caramel brown color topped off with a tad of foam. The aroma is light, but pleasing with a mixture of graininess and roasted malt. Slightly toasted flavors of caramel and coffee. There is an underlying bitterness which provides just the right amount of balance. A very drinkable and subtly pleasant beer. Very nice."
"Probably will give it one more try. Then write it off."
"Not a bad beer. Though that odd metallic flavor that I have noticed in other Abita beers is present. But this is something to look for if in the Texas or Louisiana areas."
"Good drinkability. The smoothness of the beer and the subtelty of the taste go well for dinner with ribs or something of the sort."
"Nice to finally try one after hearing so much about it. Lived up to the reputation."
"Pours a very dark brown color with ruby highlights; the head was average and dissipated into a sparse cap. The aroma is quite faint, I pick up some light roasted malt and a touch of wood. The taste is surprising light for such a dark beer. Some light roasted malt and a hint of chocolate, a touch smokey/woody. The feel is fairly light and quite fizzy, reminds me of carbonated water; the brew finishes quite neutral and balanced. No great aroma or flavors but this is a damn easy drinking brew. I found it very refreshing."
"Since the turbodog is so heavy, it would be difficult to drink more than a couple of these in one sitting, but would go well with a hearty meal on a cold day."
"Very tasty. Too over the top in ABV and all these areas to be even a Northern English Brown, but you slap American Brown on the label or in your mind when drinking this and you've got a pretty good beer."
"Some nice notes in this and when followed up with pizza wash down duties it worked out well."
"D - This is a really nice and surprising brown. There's some interesting complexity of malt and hops going on here that are very subtle. It really toes the line between the English browns and some of the hoppier American varieties as well. This would be really great with roasted or grilled foods."
"It's kind of a goofy name, but it's pretty good ale."
"This is a decent and drinkable brown ale, but not my favorite. I wouldn't seek this out again but wouldn't turn one down either."
"I love this brew, especially for only $7.50/6p! I have to exercise some control when drinking it because of the body...it's so delicious, but too many and I'm doubled over and altogether asleep for the night. Very drinkable for the first one or two, and an awesome balance of sweet malts and hop bite in a good American brown ale. Enjoy."
"D - I drink a sixer of these quite often with no problem, it's the best available brew in my area and I have fond memories of drinking these during various trips to NOLA, especially during Jazzfest. This is my favorite of the Abita brews, definitely worth a try if you're down here in the South."
"A good beer, but going into I was told it was a chocolate stout. I couldn't taste any chocolate. Nice to say I've had it, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
"D- Deffinetly one of the best Abita has to offer. A great taste and not too hard on the tongue or on the stomach. I say a 6pack will do. A good beer for dark ale lovers."
"D: A nice drinkable brown, sort of a nice introduction to the style, a beer that would pair nicely with a freshly cooked steak."
"Easy-to-drink brown ale and average for an English Brown Ale."
"I think the one I was served was perhaps a bit past ""best by"" date, only because it was a chain restaurant where most people probably don't ask for it. Still, I liked what I had, even if it was maybe a little funky."
"Pours out a dark clear ruby red with a decent, though loose-ish head. Aroma is roasty and fruity for the most part, with a healthy dose of nuttiness as well. Flavour is not quite as roasty as expected but still has some of that toasty character including nuts and some coffee. Overall this is a solid drinkable brew. Flavour profile is accessible, and might be a good gateway beer."
"Dark black body with a half-inch head in a snifter (only vessel available while traveling)...unable to distinguish effervescence...uneven tracings sustain on glass nonetheless... chocolate malt apparent; smoky notes of roasted malts too...light hints of flowery aroma...smooth, creamy body, with a swift malt rush to the tongue--lively...a brown ale indeed--malt/hops balance projects a smooth yet heavy weight to the initial taste, with a fizzy end... overall, as brown ales go, a consistent beer that paired well with Christmas cookies and closed the holiday out well--thanks to brother Jer for bringing the sampler home..."
"Pours a pretty clouded and very dark ruby. Nose is like velvety raspberries. Deep, strong, dark ones. Rich cotton candy tones. Lots of sugar. Flavor is kind of woody with a nice leafy and earthen tone to it. Seems a little thin though. Fairly firm aftertaste here. Feel is good with bubble but kind of watery on the liquid. Drinkability is so-so. I mean it isn't totally bad, but I just think that it is too thin."
"Still a drinkable beer but I wasn't impressed with this one."
"The crystal chocolate and caramel flavors come through at first, with a coffee bean and slight bitterness exposing itself as the beer warms. Burnt sugar and a bit of alcohol also make an appearance, creating a flavorful brown ale. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonated. Overall this is a nice, solid beer by Abita."
"cheers"
"pours dark brown with an inch tan head. left a little lacing. smells smoky, malty and sweet. tastes toasted with dark chocolate and coffee. finishes toasty and bitter. great mouthfeel, not too foamy, not too sticky. really smooth. drinkability is very good on this beer. this is my favorite Abita."
"Pours a nice mahogany color with a lofty and mildly retentive coca cola head. Very mild carbonation. There's nothing like a nice malty brown ale. This one smells like tootsie rolls. I will attribute that to the crystal and chocolate malts. As I start to drink it I can see some lacing begin to form. The flavor is rich, round, and full. Toasted chocolate malt with a nice dry touch of hops right at the very end make it a sturdily balanced brown ale. Mouthfeel is pretty decent, smooth and milky. Roasted aftertaste provides a good affect. Almost sessionable. I would compare this to Sammy Smith."
"Extemly drinkable, very tasty, the best brown ale i have had to date. An underrated beer, and one of my favorites."
"Overall this is a beer that starts off well enough but closes weak, would have probably been better fresher is my guess, but isn't that always the case."
"Pours out a wonderful brown color, very opaque but not too dark. A nice head with good lacing, as well. It has a nice malty scent to it at first, but becomes more hoppy as you get into it. A very good brown ale flavor, with a slight caramel hint. It goes down fairly well, but a little rough."
"Notes: This is one of my favorite brown ales. Many others overemphasize the nuttiness which is characteristic of this ale. Turbodog is more balanced and smooth - an easy drinker. I wouldn't want to drink more than one of the more high-end browns, but this could be a good one all evening. Would be perfect for a cook-out!"
"D_the best Abita I have had and a very tasty beer overall. It is thick without being heavy."
"D - Quenching and carbonated, with a mellow relaxed flavor, a bit restrained, but still drinkable. A good brown, but not really one that seems to fit the name 'Turbodog'. I guess that is the sign of how beer evolves since I remember enjoying this more years ago when I first got into craft beer."
"Smells malty. Tastes malty, then chocolate, then a bit of hops, followed by a lingering sweetness. All very pleasant tastes. Mouthfeel is very smooth, but a little lighter than I would prefer. Quite drinkable. I'm going to have to try other Abita brews."
"Dark brown , with a lovelly huge tan head, darker than most brown ales I have had. very malty aroma, almost lactic hints, Nice roasty,toasty caramel malty flavour, but creamy hints all over the place, milky chocolate, almost like a chocolate malt. Nice smooth mouthfeel,,though tends towards wateriness in the end. Overall a nice brown and quite likeable."
"Bottle was notched best by 10/25."
"D-I am impressed. I'm wrapping up a sampler of Abita beers that I have been reviewing the past week and this clearly is the crown jewel of what I have tried...borders on ""porter"" land as it is very rich and tasty...a must try beer for anyone who likes this style and even if you don't it's still worth trying."
"Now I have to admit I was not sure what to expect going into this as I had stared at it on the shelf for years but never really gave it a try. Had no inclination as to what kind of style it was, so I was essentially flying blind into this one. Poured a nice deep hazelnut brown with a very fluffy and frothy off white colored head that grew to a height of around two inches or so. A gradual fade left behind some nice side glass lace as well as a touch of frothy stuff over the top. It was somewhat cloudy, obscuring most of the view of the interior. Smell was interesting. I definitely picked up a hop presence, some touches of orange and grapefruit, however they were very light and were mostly overpowered by a sugary caramel aroma. Lots of malt here with even a slightly noticeable roasted nut aroma. The taste followed suit nicely for a light brown ale. Main backbone consisted of earthy grain type flavors that were lightened up with a healthy dose of sugar. There was definitely some nice hops added in as there was a good little bite to it in the front and it gave a nice long drawn out finish. Great feel as there was more then ample carbonation in this one and it hung around until the very end. No slickness and a good medium to light body. An excellent session ale, it was neither overpowering nor too light to be noticed. Overall I actually thought this was rather nice. It was pretty much a nice normal light brown ale that had some hops thrown in for balance only, but stayed pretty much true to its roots. This was an excellent little brew and I would surely have one again. Would probably be top notch on tap and I will need to find that out one day. But definitely a good call and one you should try."
"Pours a dark brown with light ruby highlights. Small off white head. Aroma was of slight nuttiness and roasted malt. Light to medium mouthfeel. Taste was simple. Some grains, roasted malt and nuts. Theres a bit of nuttiness on the very end. A decent brown ale nonetheless."
"Oddly enough, my freakin' hot wife, who likes Michelob Ultra thought this stuff was pretty good... go figure!"
"D - Easy to drink several of this one. Nothing complex about it, but it is a good, satisfying session beer."
"An easy drinker, though probably nothing to rave about. Well-crafted, but I could live if I never had one again."
"Overall this is fine. It has nice flavors. Easily drinkable as it isn't too rich. It's gonna' go well with lunch today."
" smooth enough, vaguely drinkable. better than macrobrew swill so I guess i'll finish it."
"Nice dark brown with amber glares. Pours out a thick frothy head that oddly disappears rather quickly. Chocalate Malt dominated the smell and there is little to no hop character. The first two out of the six pack did not impress me but the third which I have right now in the pilsner in front of me has definatley made its review alot better. Its probably the mouthfeel and the smooth sweet after taste that has changed my mind about this one. Another six pack might do the trick."
"A thick off-white head formed on the pour, with nice lacing. The color is dark brown with a ruby glow and nice clarity. The aroma is chocolately, medium-high and there is a medium-low hop aroma. The flavor is slightly roasted; moderate chocolate and has moderate hop bitterness. The finish is rather dry and a little alcohol warmth kicks in at the swallow. The body is medium/medium-full and carbonation moderate. Overall this is a very good brew, I especially like the way it finishes. I'll need to upgrade from a single to a 6er!"
"The Beer pours a nice brown color with a very nice chocolaty and coffee aroma. The taste is very close to the smell with hints of chocolate and the coffee with a tinge of caramel flavor in there. Finishes nice and smooth with a little bite on it and a good aftertaste. I drank the beer a little warm because I was a bit impatient when i got home to get it cold but I think if it were a little bit colder it would be good."
"D - Very high. One of the better brown ales that I have had, somewhere second to Bells Best Brown. Give it a try!"
"Beer poured a dark brown with a good sized off white head. Nose is sweet, chocolately, and somewhat bready -an odd combo but it is pleasant. Taste is of sweet chocolate malts, with a very slight hop balanced finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and fairly smooth. Drinkability is pretty good. This is a nice beer that is definitely worth a try,"
"I would not have guessed it was above 6% ABV, but there you go. This is a smooth, highly drinkable beer (which probably explains a lot of my college behavior) that I recommend to fans of brown ales. It's not as creamy or full-bodied as some, but it's quite nice and goes down easy."
"poured a dark brown color with a small tan head, not much lacing. Smell was coffee , chocolate, and sweet malts , alittle smoke. Taste was the same, predominantely sweet malts and chocolate. Mouthfeel was lighter than expected with medium carbonation . This is a highly drinkable brew which was surprisingly refreshing for the style. Would like to try more from this line. Worth a shot."
"Drink: This one was pretty easy to put back, it was near 100 outside yesterday too. Usually I shy away from brown ales during the hot summer days but this one didn't make me feel over full."
"D: I could definitely see drinking this again. Probably not too often, but it's definitely a nice change of pace."
"http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3/6/?ba=bros"
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brown color with a creamy light tan head that has a good amount of lacing and retention. The aroma is dark chocolate malts and coffee. The taste features much of the same chocolate and coffee flavors that were present in the aroma with a slightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is heavily carbonated and slightly fizzy. Overall, this is a pretty good brew that is definitely recommended."
"Very nice dark brown color with a creamy long-lasting head. Nice lacing on glass. Rich taste of roasted malt. Good mouth feel. I liked this beer a lot. I know some people lump Abita beers with BMC but, that is unfair. This is a good, tasty beer. Would pair well with the fare at the Abita Brew Pub."
"Pours a very dark brown (almost black) color with a nice, thick tan head, with good retention and lacing (poured from a bottle into a mug). The initial aroma is like fairly strong coffee, followed by some bitterness. I really enjoy the taste of this beer, it has a nice taste, but is not too strong. The taste is very malty, with a definite coffee taste, and some bitterness at the end. Has a fairly heavy mouthfeel to it, and does not have all that much carbonation. Despite this, it is not very hard to drink at all, and has a very interesting taste to it, as I stated before. Overall, a pretty good beer, definitely worth trying."
"Only microbrew I've had with twist-off bottle caps. Pours a dark brown with off-white head that it did not retain for long. Minimal carbonation, very smooth and drinkable with light body and mouthfeel. Reminded me a bit of Newcastle, but not as sweet. I liked it. Not much aroma."
"Overall a tasty and highly drinkable brown ale."
"D= probably very drinkable once it settles and de-carbonates a little, I'd love to try this on tap and would suspect it's a lot more drinkable in-quantity on tap."
"A great brown ale that's maybe a bit sugary and slightly heavy, but otherwise a great beer."
"D - Not the most flavorful brown but no slouch. A nice flavor and feel."
"Interesting brown ale. Lot's more character than most. Very soft palate. Silky smooth but with some burrs here and there. Somehow, good body and thin at the same time. Poured with a dnice light tan head and just a little lace. Nice mild aroma. Tasty chocolately flavor with just a hint of licorice and ripe dark fruit. Mild carbonation. Easy finish."
"D- A good beer I became reaquainted with. It has been years since I tasted this beer."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this beer is more mahogany than brown in color and has a creamy, bubbly light-brown head. Very nice looking. The smell is also quite nice, caramel and biscuit notes which produce a slightly sweet, malty nose. The taste is similar to the smell, very malty and the alcohol is barely detectable. No discernable hoppiness to the beer. The mouthfeel is fairly light in body with a creamy carbonation. Overall this is a drinkable beer and is a decent offering."
"D: This is a great drink, flavorful yet mild with a sweet malty body. I am disappointed that it took me so long to get around to this."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Carbonation is pretty good. Drinkability is good. Far from a session beer, but it goes down easy. Overall, it's a pretty good offering for the style. I'd drink it again."
"D - The light chocolate malt flavors and interesting mouthfeel make this a highly drinkable brew. I like it although it doesn't really stand out in my mind."
"Got this one after running through the other 60 beers at Fox and the Hound, my local. Pours a fairly average brown with some highlights. A little bit of respectable lacing that follows a small head. Nose is very mild, a hint of malt. Taste is likewise, fairly good, malt and maybe a touch of nuttiness. Feel is too thin. Overall, not a bad one, but not a great one either. Go for the Troeg's Rugged Trail instead."
"Turbo Dog seems an over-aggressive name for what's fundamentally a gentle and sweet mild. But give these guys some credit for working up something truly special."
"Quite easy to drink, nothing spectacular but quite pleasant."
"I'll enjoy this beer again."
"Overall, I think this is a pretty good example of the style. It doesn't take you breath away, but it's a good beer nonetheless."
"D: Because it saturates the tongue with malt-flavor it is hard to drink too many and still enjoy what flavor is there."
"Pours a dark woody red with a tanned head that fizzles out to a ring in mere seconds. Aroma is of sweaty socks, herbal hops, caramel, cheap white wine and grain. Flavors start off over-bearingly sweet with that good ol' Abita Sweet 'n' Low flavor. There is some hinted at chocolate in the malts, but it gets too grainy too quick. Has a weird taste of yeast that one would find in shitty homebrew. Finishes with hints of Robutussin and rubber bands. Mouthfeel is thin, extremely slick, and lacking carbonation. No thanks."
"Drink - This is one of my favorite American brown ales. Nice complex malt flavor that is not overly complicated. Very smooth and drinkable but just a little light bodied compared to some other browns"
"Tasty and what I thought was ""sessionable"" until I saw the abv level (which is obviously well-hidden.) A solid example of the style."
"D - Not a bad brown ale. It doesn't look overly impressive, but it delivers a good taste."
"Probably one of my favourite brown ales, and brown ales aren't really my bag...had in bottle quite a few times but I honestly love it on tap in Nawlins!! It has a very friendly taste and it looks stunning, with its dark brown body and thick proud head...is somewhat roasty and very drinkable!! I prefer it served real cold, so as it warms, so do you!!"
"Whats that? Raspberries in the aroma? Yeah, and in the quaff, too, although thin and weak. Just a off-side note of chocolate and coffee  but WAY off. Dry and crisp, this doesnt have a lot going on, but I suppose it would make a good summer session brew down south. If youre buying, Ill have another."
"D-pretty smooth and frefreshing, could drink several in a row"
"A very drinkable brown ale. I could down this all night. I'm glad I decided to try this a second time - when I had it on-tap it wasn't bad but seemed more bland that this. While I tend to choose porters and stouts more than brown ales, I'd definitely drink this again."
"I have been a fan of this beer for a while but hadn't had it in at least six months. The beer was served a deep dark brown almost black with a thin head that slowly diminished but left no lacing on the glass. The aroma was strong on black malts with a hint of chocolate and toffee. The taste was also strong on toffee and chocolate with plenty of black malt present as well. This beer is almost on the borderline between a porter and a brown ale. The beer is nice and crisp on the tongue and the +6% is well hidden. I have always found this as a very enjoyable beer."
"pours dark brown with redish highlights and large three finger light tan head that holds to about a half inch with not a lot of lacing. some fruity aromas along with a bit of caramel and roasted malt. taste is sweet with caramel and a slightly bitter chocolate is there as well. not a bad beer at all but not a standout."
"drinkability- fairly easy to drink. Its creamy and smooth with a good finish but the carbonation hides that a little bit"
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date on the back label. Poured a dark brown with reddish highlights. Had a good sized tannish head. The smell was very weak - almost undetectable. The taste pretty much followed the smell. I kept thinking man this is watery and without taste. Mouthfeel was watery. Got to say I'd rather have a Miller Lite than this. I've liked other Abita's but this misses the mark by a mile. Don't recommend even to knock off list. (2, NA, ML, N)"
"A sweet English Brown or light American Brown. Its okay, I dont need another."
"Pours a bit darker than most brown's I've had. A small but clingy tannish head sticks around for a bit. The smell is of roasted malt, not much else, perhaps a little bit of coffee? The taste isn't much more complex, but that's not to say it isn't a smooth enjoyable beer. I'm not a huge fan of browns, but this one I did enjoy."
"Appearance is a deep dark chocolate, with a reasonable sticky head. Smell is espresso roasted malt, and not a lot more. The malt profile is a nice balance of caramel and coffee, and a modest hop finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and substantive, but it is betrayed by a slightly overbearingly crisp bubbliness. This notwithstanding, a very drinkable beer."
"D - A decent brown, that could be used to hook macro-drinkers without scaring them off."
"I'm a bit late posting this in honor of Mardi Gras, but this is a solid brown ale from the Louisianan Abita."
"LIke most Abita's, however, this is where the goodness ends. The taste is of dull, nutty malts and lack-luster hop notes. There's a good amount of carbonation, but not much feel to this beer in the way of complexity. It's somewhat crisp, and doesn't leave much of an aftertaste. Overall, it misses the mark, but still a decent effort by the LA brewery."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a dark brown, forming a 1/2 inch head, that left medium lacing on the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts, with a slight hint of chocolate. The taste, IMO, is like a cross between a brown ale and a stout. Light nutty flavor, but with the taste of roasted malt, with a hint of chocolate. Interesting, but I love it. The mouthfeel is medium, being about right for the style, maybe slightly heavier than normal. Overall, this would be a great session ale. Very easy to drink, and quite tasty. Recommended."
"A mild perfume type aroma. A minimal frutiness and malty taste, with a burnt caramel finish. Quite dry and scratchy going down. Too bad I dont have anything else to say."
"this is a good beer, but if you want something substantial.this is not really it. taste goes well with food... beats macros..but i can think of other brown ales that have more going for them."
"Cheers!"
"P.S.: This was excellent with a wedge of well-aged parm -- of course, the nutty notes found in both aged parm and brown ale are always excellent together, but I was pleased with the two together here, once again."
"Dark ruby brown with a tan bubbly head. Chocolate and dark roasted malts graze the nose. Creamy, large and massive carbonation, yet simplistic for the style; caramel malts and cocoa, with light roasted coffee beans in the initial sips. The body is bland, a touch of nutty flavorings, somewhat watered-down with toffee malts and traces of oats. Incredibly boring; skip this over-rated beer."
"the second beer of the party pack that im trying and the second beer that im not all that fond of.pours a nice thick creamy head.taste more like a stout than a ale.if you like stouts its ok but it is not something that i will be bringing home at every oppurtunity.i think the name targets the younger crowd.i think i will avoid this one in the future."
"More coffee and roasted malt across the bow of the taste, and mouthfeel is nicely thick and surprisingly smooth. If blindfolded I would never know this was an Abita brew. It's not stupendous (nor is it a brown ale) but it tastes good and goes down very easy. If you're down on the Pelican State's big gun, give this dog a shot."
"I think I might have developed a bias towards Abita beers though. I'll have to try them again in a blind tasting.."
" This was my first time trying a beer from Abita. I will ave to make a greater effort into locating more of their products."
"I got this 12 ounzer from the Abita Party Pack at Kunda Bev., and poured it into a large 20 ounze glass. From there I found that there wasn't much head. The retention was also rather fast. There wasn't even a speck of lace. I am finding out that these are charateristics of most Abita brews. The smell hinted at coffee, or something of that nature. The taste was a bit malty, but not to powerful. The thickness of the brew lead to a nice mouthfeel. A drinkable brew. Don't drink and review."
"This is a very drinkable beer if youre into that kind of flavor, personally I am not a fan of chocolaty flavors."
"Overall: A good brown ale. Recommended."
"This beer pours dark brown color and has an off white head. The head is pretty decent and lacing was average. Chocolate type smell kind of reminds me of hot cocoa. Chocolate theme carries over in the taste department and has a nice even smooth flow going down. One of the better dark beers i've had."
"Very, very drinkable. Excellent session beer, particularly for its price (around $6/6pack)."
"D - A very good brown ale. I could easly drink a few of these in a sitting."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, upon first glance this beer was very dark, nearly black. Held up to the light I saw a lovely ruby red hue. Very nice head that stuck around. Smells sweet with a hint of fruit. Kind of like a fruity coffee. But the taste doesn't live up to the aroma. A little on the boring side. The most noticable taste seems to be that of the alcohol. Not bad, but I expected a little more flavor from this brown ale. That being said, it is not too heavy in the mouth and not too light. Overall not bad. I could see it as a good session beer for a dark ale."
"I enjoyed this bottle tonight alone more than I have in the past at the pubs. I think I had better selections to choose from on tap and it never lived up in flavor to the others. Certainly very drinkable, but there are better combinations of flavors for my tongue."
"Notes: So far I believe this is their best offering of the 5 I've tried. Browns are not usually high on my list of favorite styles but when done well I can appreciate the quality. This is far from touching some of the better browns but its decent and worthy of a purchase."
"Poured with some head that dismantled quickly. Left a thin line of lacing. A dark body but with some highlights to the colour. Fairly deep for the style. An almost scotch ale like aroma. Comes across as American - not like the classic British renditions. The combination of malts make for a rough ended flavour. Non too harmonious in the least. A coca-cola like character. Initially sticky mouthfeel, fades with the use of spring water. The alt yeast comes through on the finish and leaves a lingering distinctness from the initial flavour impressions. The flavours hold together quite well, but just don't blend as a medley... more of high school garage band practice. I appreciate the makeup, smart work but a dis-satisfying result. Thanks Harry!"
"Pours a dark rich ruby mahogony with a foamy guiness like head. The smell is very good and earthy with toffee, roasted malt, and carmel. A very nice aroma. The taste,like the smell, is roasted malt,sweet carmel,vanilla, and some chocolate. A very complex and good flavor. The m/f is light with the many flavors and smells mixing perfectly. This may be the best English Brown Ale brewed in America. Cheers."
"Overall a very good interpretation of the style."
"On pour into nonic glass it produced med. carbonation and a two finger head that collapsed to about 1/2"" but was persistent/clinging. Color was a deep brown. Aroma was a pleasing sourness (I think the alt yeast at work here), coffee notes. Taste was exceptional, I immediately detected fruit (stone fruits, plum) and then bitter chocolate. Nice hop finish with the Williamette being a good choice for this ale. A more citric/flowery variety would have detracted from the above flavor components. Drinkability enhanced by the smoothness of this ale....a distinct slider... I think this is a unique beer in that it has some English brown ale qualities but the alt yeast gives it more complexity."
"An overall good beer. A good contrast to the American Brown Ale style, as this is the sweeter maltier English version. It's a good example of the style, and perhaps a good introduction for coffee drinkers."
"The beer pours a dark brown with deep shades of red shining through when held to the light. A sturdy tan head forms on top. The aroma is a sweet caramel with just a hint of chocolate. Medium to light body and mouthfeel. A sweet malty flavor gives way to a light cocoa and coffee flavor. As it warms these flavors give a bigger showing. A good brown ale that almost borders on a porter. Would definitely buy again and probably will the next time the BBQ is sparked up."
"Pours a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate, and caramel. Chocolate malt and toffee are predominant, but they give way to a coffee finish; a bit heavier (even for a brown ale), but it goes down very well. Unfortunately, I tried it on a hot day...I'd definitely prefer it on a crisp autumn evening."
"A very solid beer, this is probably my favorite of abita's main 3 beers. A big plus is that it's relatively cheap around here, so I enjoy it quite a bit."
"D - Very drinkable as a session and relatively inexpensive with a good depth of flavor."
"A delicious English Brown Ale, that stays true to the style. Abita does not dissapoint with this one."
"This beer poured a nice deep black color with a persistent head. The smell was slightly sweet and malty. The taste was a combination of malt, coffee, sweetness with a bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel was heavy and chewy. I consider this a highly drinkable beer (but could be biased because I grew up near the brewery and on this beer)."
"Beautiful deep, rich brown but you can still see through it. Nice head - deep color, tight bubbles, fair lasting power, good lacing. Smells deeply malty, nice sweet caramel. Tastes. Hmm. Deeply malty with a touch of sweet caramel? You get darker malts - chocolate, coffee, maybe a hint of burnt caramel - as well as the caramel, definitely not overbearingly caramel or sweet! Nice medium mouth - could be a good drinker all year..."
"I've heard a lot of people buzzing about this beer so I thought I would try it now that I've found it somewhere. Grabbed a six pack of bottles today. The beer is a nice looking brown with a fairly decent head and lace. The smell is a bit faint but has a chocolate wheat much expected from a brown ale. the taste is suprisingly good! Some brown ales are just a bit too sweet or too much, this one is a nice light crispy tasting mix of chocolate and toffee wheat without being sticky or boggy. It's refreshing, and that's not something you can say of a brown ale very often. The mouthfeel is pretty average for a brown ale, but is absolutely nothing to complain about. This is a really drinkable beer that I would highly recommend on a hot muggy day served ice cold. This is made for all the people who want something refreshing after a hard day's work but can't stand the pilsners. Nice beer, worth a try!"
"Overall- A nice surprise! A good Upper-middle class Brown Ale."
"A solid Brown Ale, nothing outstanding, but very pleasant to drink."
"Mostly harmless."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a light creamy head. Chocolate toasted malt smell with hints of grainy hops. A nice malt flavor with hints of caramel and chocolate. There is also a little bit of a fruity bite to the finish. The feel is slightly creamy and fresh. Not the cleanest finish but not a bad after taste so its ok. In all its not the most refreshing beer but the flavor is good. Its a great example of brown ale. Its certainly worth a drink."
"D: Great with a po'boy or some seafood. Perfectly drinkable year-round. A nice effort by Abita, probably the best of their regulars."
"Pours out with about 2 inches of head. Has a dark brown color to it. Darker than most in this style. Smell comes out with slights amount of roasted malts and caramel is detected. The taste starts off with rich malty taste the malts make for a sweet beginning to a drink, with caramel undertones again. The end has a nice bite of hops. This is appreciated. The mouthfeel feels a little bit too much like water, but is not like a Bud light by any means. This is a beer a guy/gal could session on all night long. I do enjoy Brown's for being what they are simple tasty and versatile. This Brown does better than most at that."
"Drinkable? I'll just say that I'm not happy that I've still got 5 of these left in the fridge."
"Overall, a brew that gets the basic taste right, but lacks in intensity."
"A quick pour yields a two finger head, which falls to one and lasts. The head is the color of heavily creamed coffee. The body is deep black, showing only hints of garnet when back-lit. Appears more like a stout than a brown. Smells roasty and sweet, with bits of toffee and caramel. Could be richer. Taste is mellow, but dominated by roast, to the point of the beer being more a porter than a brown. An enjoyable bitterness, though. Mouth is medium, with low carbonation lend a nice smoothness. A drinkable, possibly mis-categorized beer, that I don't think I'll be reaching for again."
"Drinks okay reminds be of new castle brown, but with more flavor! Well worth a try. Haven't had a whole bunch of abita, but this one is my favorite"
"Beautiful brown color. Smell is not very appealing, nice and strong but a little sour. Tastes strongly of coffee with a little chocolate behind it. Average mouthfeel. For a dark beer, extremely drinkable. Another solid offering from Abita, but I wish they would have done a little more with this."
"This brown Ale pours to a brownish amber color, with thick tan head that quickly shrinks to a tan ring around the glass, and good lacing. Malty aroma with some nut and caramel. Although it was hard to pick out any particular flavor, the overall taste was good. Finish was slightly watery, but good and long lasting."
"Poured into a pint glass from 12 oz. bottle. This doesn't look much like a brown ale, dark brown, off white head. Not much aroma at all, faintly like chocolate. Taste is roasted malt, chocolate maybe a little carmel. The hops are overwhelmed by the roasted malt. Seems lighter bodied than I would expect and the carbonation really stands out. This beer is worth a try, as it seems a little unusual but it won't be a regular in my fridge."
"A darker brown ale with slivers of light shining through and a small light tan head. The smell was not as much as I was expecting. Not a whole lot besides some caramel and malty sweetness. The taste was a bit more than the smell with a good amount of the caramel malt pulling through and balanced well with the hops. Of the brown ales I've tried this was certainly not my favorite, but it was still quite good. I could go for this again sometime."
"Although this style isnt my favorite, its one where Im rarely disappointed. Overall, I think this is a very good beer and an excellent representation of the style."
"Turbo Dog pours a mahogany color with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. It has a nice aroma, with some toffee and chocolate like smells. Nice flavor too, chocolate like flavors, maybe some toffee flavor too. I like this beer, it's definitely worth a try."
"Had this on tap at Crawdaddys in Milwaukee, WI. This ale was very dark brown/black with brown lacing on the side of the pint glass. It had a pleasant roasted/chocolate scent. The mouthfeel was pretty watery overall (not as thick as it looked), but still pretty good for an American Brown Ale. It had no hop presence that I could taste, but perhaps the extreme maltiness was overpowering the hops flavor. The flavor was exquisite. I tasted chocolate, roasted malts, and a hint of caramel in the aftertaste. I thought this was an amazing beer. Its definitely near the top of my list as far as must haves."
"Drinkability is ok, better browns are available. Not really bad but nothing to make you want to try it again in my opinion atleast not when its sitting beside a good brown at my grocery store."
"12 oz bottle poured into an Imperial pint glass. Color is a dark reddish brown. Light comes through as ruby red. Minimal tan head, quickly recedes Smell is a mixture of cocoa sweet and hops bitter. Taste is nutty and malt up front, but finishes with some hops. Mouthfeel is light, with a well balanced carbonation. This is a pretty OK beer, but doesn't really grab me."
"Pours a deep red/brown color with an epic head of cocoa. Nose is very malty, with mollasses and roasted nut accents. Nice aroma. Palate is thick and sweet upfront. Strong roasted malt flavors, along with the sweetness override the hops. Finished surprisingly dry though. Has a medium feel, but I'd say it's on the lighter side when contemplated longer. This one isn't bad, really, and an appropriate brew for the restaurant for sure. The cajun tuna steak was the highlight here though ... not the beer. Give it a try if you see it on th menu."
"Good roasted malt flavor, with a hint of chocolate. A small hoppy finish. Overall, this is a good beer that I would definitely have again, and it is a great brown ale."
"I'd imagine this is highly drinkable, good flavor, nice finish, too bad I only had one."
"A favorite among the patrons at the C & B, they almost always have a tap on this and always fresh. You come on Wednesday's it's $5 liter night and I always get a liter of TurboDog. Perfect example of a brown."
"Appears a dark mahogany brown with ruby highlights has a nice tan cream head leaves behind sparse lacing. Aroma has herbal hops with a chocolate nutty edge to it very nice mix of dark toasted malts and a light hop profile. Taste contains caramel chocolate tones from the excellent malt profile this is definitely an old stand by from the brown ale category, herbal hop finish very definitively one of the best browns I've tasted straight outta Louisiana. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a slightly syrupy texture that stays on the palate a bit longer than the typical craft ale. Drinkability is wonderful challenging to the senses yet groundbreakingly good and refreshing on multiple levels."
"An interesting and unique beer, and definitely the local beer I go for when visiting the Crescent City."
"Body pours a deep, near-opaque brown with a solid tan head. Smells clean, dry, a little metallic. Taste starts a little sweet but that's followed quickly by a sharp roasty bite. A little fuzzy and dry-toasty feeling towards the end of the sip, but that sharp roast really jumps out."
"Turbodog is a serviceable brown ale but nothing outstanding... The caramel and malt profiles are a bit week but it's rather true to the style."
"Very dark reddish-brown with 1 cm of creamy, tan, slowly diminishing head. Smell is mostly of dark roasted malts with a light sweetness and some fruit. Dark bread, toffee, brown sugar, caramel, and nuts. The taste follows suit with dark, bready malts taking center-stage supported by a very light hops presence and a touch of earthy yeast. It has a medium-full mouthfeel, lightly syrupy texture and moderate carbonation. Interesting take on the style and quite enjoyable. Probably my favorite of the Abita mix case so far."
"Final Thought: This beer is unbelieveable, it tastes like a hybrid porter-ale and is one to be purchased when seen, without a doubt."
"I am a member of the Beer of the Month Club and this was one of the first beers that came in the first month. I have been a huge fan of this beer ever since. I enjoy the slight chocolate smell and taste of the beer. I was never a dark beer drinker until I tasted Turbo Dog. I now can't get enough of the ""Dog"". I have turned on quite a few on my friends to this tasy beverage now too. It is hard to find this beer where I am from but when I do get some it is a very welcome treat."
"I haven't been really impressed by the other Abita beers. This beer however, was a welcome suprise. This beer begins with a deep, rich smell. Dark and malty looking, it poured average but really shines on the initial taste. Good amount of flavor with nice roasted undertones. Medium carbonation and medium-light body."
"Pours a very dark ruby brown, with a thick fluffy head, good lacing down the glass. Aroma is kind of weak, but nice, chocolate malt with toffee and some wierd ripe funk that isn't altogether bad. Taste has a bready malt character with chocolate hints, some toffee. Decent medium body and a little action on the tongue. Overall, pretty decent brown."
"This beer pours a dark brown with rich amber hues and a decent off white head that sticks around for a while and laces nicely. The smell is mild nuttiness and coffee aromas. Same flavors appear as in the smell and they are once again mild. Its a little watery but not too bad. Overall not bad but there are better brown ales out there although this one is like a cross between a porter and a brown ale. Probably most similar to Harpoon's Munich Type Dark, but not as good."
"This beer was well before the date of caution, and I had my wife smell and taste it, and she agreed it was rank. My conclusion is that the bottle I bought was infected. Down the drain it went."
"Actually served a bit too cold to make out much of the character. But still, its pretty good. A bit of spiciness in the tan foam make me think briefly of a Christmas ale. A general hop bitterness is apparent at the first taste, then I caught some good chocolate malt with very little astringency. Looks good, tastes good."
"Poured a small head with only a ring to show for itself, even after a hard pour. Color was a well highlighted ruby/brown mix. This color allowed some cool lacing to be seen when held to the light. The smell was of faint bready and toasted malts. With an aura of an English meadow. But take what I just said and taint and water it down a lot. The taste was of burnt toast mixed with a Dickens style grool. Please sir, I don't want some more. I shouldn't say that. This beer was alright. I only bought a single bottle to get an idea if this is a decent beer. I think it neesds further investigation."
"I get home after a rough day at class and open my fridge for something to drink and there is a Turbo Dog staring me in the face. So I pop the top and pour this beer into a pint glass. It had very little head (maybe a pinky finger) which disolved into thin film. There is minor lacing. The beer is dark brown which has some redish highlights when held to the light. Malt, the slightest hint of chocolate, some roasted nut sweetness, and the smallest drop of some hops were in the nose. The first part of the taste of this beer is some sweetness followed by some nutty chocolate flavors and finishes with a small amount of hop bitterness at the end. The aftertaste is slightly sweet. Very little carbonation is in this beer. I really wanted to love this beer, but as it has been said by previous reviewers, it lacks some excitement that would change it from good to great. Still you can drink many of them without a problem."
"This is a decent beer. It went surprisingly well with blueberries and strawberries for dessert. Alas, it is not all that interesting nor terribly balanced. So I'm fine with one or two of these."
"Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a huge off-white foamy head with better then average retention. Aroma of chocolate malt is quite distinctive and very pleasant. Taste is also dominated by roasted malt with some chocolate note and a slightly bitter finish. Overall, this is probably better then 90% of brown ale out there but it is still a brown ale which just doesnt get me excited."
"All in all, a very pleasant beer."
"I haven't been really impressed by the othe Abita beers I have has so far so this beer was a welcome suprise. This beer begins with a deep, rich smell. Dark and malty looking, it poured average but really shines on the initial taste. Aftertaste lingers very short so that finish is clean."
"Appearance is almost opaque but not quite, with ruby tints. The chocolate malt in this brew is evident in the aroma as well as the taste, a little toasty too. I feel like it could have benefited from more hops to balance out the mallt. Not a bad beer, fairly drinkable."
"I liked this beer much more than I remembered it. I bought a 6pack the other night(on sale for 5.99) and it poured a thick blackish/brown, with a thin white head that left a lacing around the glass. The smell of of slightly sweet malt, and just a hint of hops....very faint smell....nothing that really stood out, but good none the less. The first taste to hit your tongue is of malt (chocolate, and maybe toffee or Carmel malts too) Lightly hoped in the body. The after taste is what does it for me....a nice dark chocolatey after taste that is slightly bitter. Mouthfeel:is thick, and wonderful....the light hops mellows the malt and makes it easy to drink. This is a brown ale, but a very dark one. It is definitely one of the better cheap craft brews(you can find it in Charleston for like 6.99(or less) all the time)"
"D- This had some interesting dark malt notes that were nice but there wasn't enough depth or character to them. The hops were present but they just didn't have the characteristics of hops in the floral and aroma."
"Overall I like this beer a lot. It is on tap quite often at a restaurant in my home town and many of my beer bros like it, good thing I like it since it is around quite a bit. I am not sure how this for the style, I have never had an English Brown Ale taste like this."
"Pours dark brown with a brown-tinged head, short and foamy. Smells of toasted malts, mocha, grains. Taste is pretty good. Coffees, slight chocolates, maltiness, along with sweet dark wheats and maybe a hint of fruit (raisin). Crisp, good drinkability."
"Probably the best beer that Abita makes. It's a medium brown hue with promising head retention. Aromas are lightly malty, toasty, nutty, and caramelly. Though flavors are modest, they are clean and of same characteristics in the nose. The beer waters significantly into the body and finish. It looses the creaminess and maltiness. Finishes a tacky sweet and a little less than clean. Though not great, it's fair."
"The mouth is just thick enough and the beer is interesting enough to be very a good session option. I guess Emerile knows a bit about beer!"
"Every beer from the abita party packed has sucked! So now i will try the only one with the cool label. Actually some really nice graphic design goin on here. Poured a nice deep brown color with a good mocha colored inch deep head. The smell isn't that much different than the other abita beers, WHY DO THEY ALL SMELL THE SAME, there are differet styles here!!! Kinda malty with a hint of sweetness. The taste contains that same abita essence that the other abita beers also except this one has a hint of toasted malts! There is some decent hoppage at the end that saves the day. The hint of coffee is nice. Light-medium body. Could use more carbonation, but not bad!"
"Too bitter to be really drinkable, fairly unpleasant. Fans of brown ales should look elsewhere."
"light mouthfeel with heavy carbonation, like a soda. heavy coffee flavors with a balancing chocolate sweetness. just a hint of hop bitterness. not incredibly complex or rich, but a satisfying, balanced flavor. goes well with almost any dinner."
"D a really like this one, a very good brown ale. Drank the three that I had in one night and was wanting a few more."
"Overall this is one i should get more often than i do. I think its the best regular abita beer."
"Man I dont know what it is with abita but this looked and smelled great dark brown with a nice head and sweat chocolate and nuts but then the taste is just a train wreck. It is hard to imagine how it can go from smelling and looking so good to falling short so fast. I think i am done with abita they cant say i didnt give them a chance though"
"Not a bad brew, especially since I just bought it because of the name. Will try some others from Abita if I can get them, to see how it goes."
"beer is drinkable would be more enjoyable in the summer. I dont agree with the style classication, the malt and hops spell brown ale but the yeast is a alt, really you could just say the hops are wrong because you could sub the malt for an alt."
"This beer poured a very dark brown with burgundy highlights and a thin film of off white head. Smelled of smoky chocolate malts with a touch of sourness. Tasted of sweet honey and a slight molasses blended into a delicate, crisp and dry hops. This was followed with a very clean sour and dry finish. Mouth feel was light bodied with a medium carbonation. The flavor is very simple, but well done and it goes down very easy."
"Drinkability: I have heard a lot about this beer since joining BA years ago. It is an OK brown ale, but I have had many better."
"Very good basic beer. Honestly I didn't notice all the depth of flavors that were going on in this. But definitely smooth and hits the hell out of the spot."
"Mouthfeel is medium, not heavy at all, easy to drink. I could have a few, but it's drinkability wears on me after a while."
"Good looking brown beer with a short-lived head and no lacing to speak of. Malty odor with hints of ?nuts? Strong malt and chocolate taste with lingering aftertaste. Weird mouthfeel, thick and carbonated. Good drinkability...a six pack wouldn;t last long in my fridge....although i dont know how often i would buy it."
"Nearly opaque dark plum-brown body with a 1-finger tan head, low retention. Not much in the way of lacing. Nose of chocolate malt, slightly nutty, and offset by a bit of hop. Moderately aggressive carbonation in a medium body, slightly acridic, toffee and chocolate with a bit of nuttiness, goes down smooth and finishes with a slight uplifting hop bitterness. Thin flavor profile for the style, but easy-going and pleasant, making it easily sessionable."
"This beer is a deep molases color with a frothy toasted tan head. The nose is rasted nut with a hint of coacoa. The taste starts bitter, with hints of chocolate before going to a more roasty, nut toffee finish. This is probably Abita's best offering. One is great, but there is something which keeps this from being very drinkable."
"Drinkability: While this brew ended up being merely ""good", it was a bit of a letdown, though I appreciated the effort."
"I always seem to notice a subtle skunky aroma. Ive had this beer many times before and always the same aroma. Taste is not very good either. Its pretty malty but it has some bad ass heineken hop profile. And a weird horse stable flavor. Dirt and hay and shit? I dont know. I've had this beer time and time again hoping that one day I just might like it, but in the end, this beer is just not for me. Sorry."
"EDIT: this got better as the glass emptied...perhaps I had it too cold? I kicked the numbers up a touch to reflect this."
"Drinkability - Being that this is not heavy on the stomach, and tastes rather good. It's a great session beer for two or three beers to be knocked back."
"Pours a dark brown with very little head. Smell consists of burnt malts. The taste is quite pleasing and consists of almost chocolate like malts with a clean hop bitterness in the end. This is an enjoyable brew and I could finish off quite a few of these in one sitting."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with ruby highlights when held up to light. Tan head with no visible carbonation has some nice lacing. Smells of sweetness with a hint of chocolate. Roasted maltiness in taste with some sweet chocolate notes as well as some coffee. Hop presence is definately there, but rather understated. An excellent balance of malt to hops for my taste. Overall a solid brew that I drink pretty often. The best offering from Abita in my opinion, at least of the options available to me."
"This could be a porter when it grows up."
"All in all, a terrific beer; can't wait to try some of the others that abita has to offer."
"A dark brown color with a subtle tan colored head. Faint aromas of nuts, hops, and brown sugar are clear. The taste is quite flavorful, more hops than I expected. Soft bitterness upfront with a malty taste that starts soon after and dominates the aftertaste. More of a medium-bodied beer with a definite dry and bready aftertaste. A very enjoyable brew with good drinkability. Subtle flavors blend together to form a smooth brew that can be had over and over again."
"I don't think this beer is anything special, but it's a simple success. The watery aspect makes you able to slam it back, although it comes a long way to get to Ithaca and costs a bit as a result. Pretty decent, I'd cheerfully drink it again."
"All right so Im bias, however this is an exceptional beer. When ever you get a chance you should support your local micro brew that is if you think its worth a damn. Back to the beer. As far as this brew goes you cant beat it for a domestic its got some meat to it. Dark in appearance, appealing bottle, and a smooth taste (chocolate hops with coffee overtones). Man I can drink this stuff for hours. It does help if you can get it fresh, I tried it in a Texas bar not nearly as good. This is definitely worth a try if you can get a holt of it."
"Full bodied, but not chewy, pretty good mouthfeel, and a fairly drinkable brown ale."
"Very dark brown, burned oil color, with solid red and maroon highlights in a decently lit room. Tan head faded to a dime thickness but stuck around with minimal lacing. Good malting on the nose with a bit of hop, a somewhat coffee-house tone to it. Stout-ish with more (but not a lot) of hops. Very good chewing feel to it. Very drinkable and pleasant on the colder nights."
"got this in a trade and I cannot remember who sent it to me. so thanks. poured a brown with a off white head. aroma all on the light side, malts, caramel, chocolate, brown sugar. flavor, semi sweet, dark fruits, caramel, malt, wit just a touch of toffee. not to bad."
"Pours a clear, dark brown with reddish highlights. About 1.5 fingers of foamy, tan head. Clean aroma with hints of roasted malt and coffee.Taste is roasty, with coffee notes, a little nuttiness, and some mild hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is pretty thin and maybe a bit too carbonated. Good drinkability. Over all a very nice version of a brown ale. I'd buy it again!"
"Cheers..."
"Incredibly dark brown, almost looking like a porter. Very little in the way of a head. Pleasant, faintly malty aroma. Taste is very malty, little hint of coffee and smoke. Goes down very easily; highly drinkable beer. I discovered this beer while on my first visit to New Orleans, and it and Abita Amber where my staples for a week. With all that's happened down there since Katrina, it's comforting to cook up a pot of jambalaya and wash it down with a Turbo Dog, enjoying the great memories that everyone leaves New Orleans with."
"A very nice feel to this beer. A chocolate flavor reminiscent of a stout with a touch of hops. A very nice beer."
"This baby's almost a porter. It's that dark, almost that potent in flavor. Nice mild roasted notes. A touch of chocolate. Heavy on the malt yet i'm surprised to notice the hops shining through so well. Perfectly balanced and worth your time, every time."
"All in all, it's an intertesting brew, and obviously would make for a good session beer. Alcohol is apparently very low, as I can drink six pints of this and still play it off (and I am admittedly a lightweight). Not really a personal favorite, but certainly something I can drink with my friends who have been bitten by the dog."
"A damn fine drink, I like it a lot!"
"D: Very good drinkability. If they had this in the can, priced the same as BMC, this would be a good change up beer. As it is now, I prefer other flavors, but this is a nice brown."
"Pours a brilliantly clear deep ruby amber color when held up to the light, otherwise a deep amber-brown color. It is topped by a frothy light amber-brown colored head. The aroma is malty with notes of toasted biscuits, chocolate, lightly roasted coffee and sweet toffee. The taste is lightly sweet with a rich maltiness to it that almost has a salty, meaty character to it. There are notes of caramel and toffee here as well as a bit of chocolate and a light roasted astringency in the finish. This is by far the most flavorful beer that I have had from Abita. This beer is definitely focused on the malt, but there is a nice light bitterness in the finish plus some light hoppy flavor notes that remind me of fresh cut herbs and flowers."
"I really like this beer. Maybe not to style (?), but who cares when it's this poundable."
"Bottle provided by UncleFlip, thanks for the opportunity. Pours a twofinger light brown head (big bubbles) over a crystal clear dark brown liquid. Smells chocolate, chalky malt, fuggles hops, and a hintof caramel. Tastes chocolate with a little bit of roasty sour and a nice supporting caramel base. As the beer warmed, I got molasses late in the taste. Hop bitter is nearly absent and hop floral is rough and grassy (fuggles?). The finish is dry cocoa with some coffee roast poking through. A tasty beer that I really enjoyed. Not complex, but certainly not simple. Mdlight body and moderate carbonation."
"Opaque brown, not much of a head, with a faintly sweet smell. The taste is quite distinctive for a brown ale, with a slightly roasted taste, with a strong chocolate flavor. Sweet too, with a fine balance of hops, but the predominant flavor is the chocolate. Thick and smooth mouthfeel. I think this beer would be fine with desert, but was not what I was looking for in a brown ale with dinner."
"Stouty for a brown, and too chocolately. Very malted milk and drinkable at the end of a humid day. Me Ovaltine. Not too sweet, but the chocolate malt overwhelms brown character. Nicely hopped and somewhat bitter finish. Interesting and satisfying. Medium mouthfeel."
"A bit like a good beer hiding behind lace curtians- you get an idea of what is there, but no details. Thin, and somewhat watery, but what flavor there is is very nice, coffee and mocha, finished with a nice tartness. Smells the same. A nice beer, but not overly remarkable. Bet it is good on tap though."
"Very nice chestnut brown color. Great tan head. Aroma of chocolate and malt. Slight trace of vanilla. Good malty flavor-nice caramel sweetness with a very low bitterness behind it. Not overly sweet. Slight chocolate fading in the backround. Nice body. Quite a drinkable brew. Bet this could be excellent on tap. Wish I had another to sample."
"-UF"
"Thanks to BigLove for the bottle."
"Pours a very dark mohagany color with a nice deep tan head that leaves way too quickly. The nose is of sweet malts. Extremely sweet smelling. Taste is a little more mild than I had expected, but absolutely not bad at all. As I get about 1/2 way through the beer, it actually tastes very good. Not too strong and overdone. I notice flavors of sweet caramel malts and a little hint of coffee. Finishes clean. I'm surprised to find no aftertaste. None whatsoever. The mouthfeel is average and the drinkability is outstanding. If I could give higher than a 5 for drinkability I would. I could drink tons of these. I almost think those wussy beer drinkers that are stuck on AB, Miller and Coors would actually like this one."
"Enjoy by 07/29/05 nicked on the label. Turbo Dog is no dog. What a beautiful dark mahogany brown brew! Thick rocky light brown head that disipates rather quickly. Malty, nutty aroma with a faint hint of hops. Taste is very much like it smells, only thicker. This is a fine brew, just a little too rich on a hot Carolina day. Would be great on a cool October football weekend with a brat. Ruff - Ruff!"
"Pint at Flying Saucer in Columbia, SC."
"Tastes are like a nuttier, watered down (in a good way) porter. Less dairy than a porter as well. Sorry. This is my first of the style. Slightly dried out in the finish which leads to the desire for more swallows. This really is a drinkable glass. I cannot finger exactly what it is that I like here, but this is a damn tasty brewha. Appropriate body to match the flavour profile. This really is a good beer apart from the subdued nose and lazy visuals. I am looking for flavour above all else, and this is a prime example of why this is a good philosophy. I could surely swill these at will. A session entity for shizell. P'raps me should suck down s'more Abita beers."
"It's a very malty birthday so far to say the least. It makes turning 33 almost ok. If for some reason I get crucified this year or die doing a speedball at least I'll have tried this malty baby, which is more than I can say for a few of the famous people who only made it to their 33rd year."
"This is a smooth brew, worth a try if you like the lighter side of the dark stuff."
"I had heard good things about Turbo Dog. Even though I haven't been impressed with Abita beer in the past, I was willing to believe that this was their flagship, their pride and joy, and was therefore a cut above. Then I drank this bottle. Far from a snarling, vicious hellhound, it's more of a toothless old pooch. I'm still waiting to be impressed Abita. What else you got?"
"The aroma is nutty and slightly alcoholic. There is a strong caramel maltiness in the smell also. Also, some coffee beans. This is a slightly chewy brown ale with a strong coffee taste. There is a hint of an alcohol taste in there as well. Not a bad beer, but more like a porter than a brown ale in my opinion."
"D&N: He may not have sent me this one, but BigLove turned me on to Abita with the Abita Wheata he sent me. Thanks for getting me interested in this brewery, everything I've tried from them has been tasty, this one is just off the scale drinkable. I now have a definite beer I'll think of when I think of English Brown. Superb beer and I can't recommend this one enough. Go Get Some!"
"Overall a great beer. If you're in the southeast and looking for something unique...or if your local store carries it you can't miss with this one. It makes for a wonderful session beer."
"This beer coats your mouth a bit and has a very thick, malty chocolate flavor with a slightly burnt taste around the edges for some character. Overall, very mild and smooth. Great for sipping. It got me through several hands of poker. I'd definitely pour this one again but I haven't seen it in California yet."
"poured a deep mahogony color with large puffy head that dissipated to thin lacing. Smell is chocolately-carmel with coffee background. Taste is superb with a slight sweetness, deep coffee-chocolate overtones and a lingering bitterness. An extremely tasty enjoyable beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" tan head above the burgundy brown brew. Head lasts well, and laces nicely also. Aroma is grain husks, with a touch of fruitiness. Taste is dominated by grains, which is what I like in a brown, almost tastes kind of worty. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very nice as well. A pleasant surprise compared to the on-tap version of this that I had awhile back."
"This beer pours a dark brown with a light brown head. The head appears very thick and creamy. It fades very slowly leaving lots of thick laces. It smells biscut like. Also, it smells malty. I am having trouble detecting any hop aroma. It tastes biscut like with a slight caramel taste. It has a slight chocolate taste also, but only very subtle. As with the aroma, the hop presence is almost undetectable. This beer is medium bodied. It is carbonated well and goes down smooth. The taste leaves a lot to be desired from an English Brown. This might make a good session beer because it is not high in alcohol. But I am not too excited with the taste. I will probably never drink it again."
"Taste is alot like the smell. Rich caramel amlt with hints of molasses. Nutty with just the slightest bitterness in the finish. Smooth as velvet in the mouth. Light, long lasting stickiness in the aftertaste. Really nice and drinkable. A surprise as this is a great tasting smooth brown ale. Straight-forward and uncomplicated but very much to style and is elegant in the mouth. This is from Louisiana?"
"Thanx Biglove"
"I was happy to see this beer finally in Michigan. Pours a deep abmer/brown color with an okay head, and good lacing for what the beer is. Aroma is very faint, not much going on there. Taste is surprising rich yet light of chocolate malts. Mouthfeel is nice, slightly thick and creamy, yet light enough to make it a session beer. I like this, and can see myself getting it again and again."
"Taste: Heat stricken indeed, which is weird, because I got from a fridge, guess it got stored in the heat beforehand...Smokey, watery and just not very agreeable, this one ended up in the drain."
"The taste is malty - caramel, coffee, over ripe fruit, and again a hint of chocolate. Smooth, creamy, with a touch of vanilla in the aftertaste. Very easy to drink. Very nice."
"A fine brown ale. I spent a night drinking these and hanging out with close friends, in my opinion, a very nice pairing."
"Dark brown with a large light brown head that sticks all over the glass. Smells malty with a touch of coffee and prunes. Meduim-heavy body with a coffee and chocolate malt laste. A good amount of hop bittereness to go around. This is a top notch brew to me. Very tasty."
"It is a shame that the on-tap beverage does not translate well to the bottled version of this beer. I highly recommend trying this on tap. the only reason to try the bottle is to learn what the bottle is missing."
"One of the best beers I've tried in this style."
"Beer poured a very dark, almost opaque black. I couldnt detect much of a hop aroma but there was a slight hop flavor. There was quite a bit of lacing involved and the beer had a bit of a smokey chocolate malt flavor. I would be able to handle about three of these beers in a session but there isnt enough flavor or smoothness to keep me around much longer."
"This is a decent tasting brown, but it has some other flaws; most notably the pungent chemical like aromatics and the prickly mouthfeel. My first experience with Abita's line and unfortunately I'm not impressed."
"Quite a decent brew from Abita, taste-wise. Most of their beers are vaguely disappointing."
"Dark Brown color with a quarter inch head and an exceptionally fresh malty aroma. Malt dominates flavor all the way through with a malty aftertaste. Body is a bit thin. Easy to drink and quaffable. I am not that familiar with brown ales but this seems very true to style."
"Very drinkable, but not too many in one setting."
"A pleasant and mild ale that should serve well as a stepping stone beer. I wish they had chosen to bottle condition this beer to leave more of an earthy flavor intact."
"Comments  Thanks to BigLove for sending this one cross-country. This is the sleeper of the Abita line."
"Drinkability: Yes please, I'll have some more. But not to many, unfortunately while the toffee taste is strong and welcomed I can only stomach a couple of these before my taste buds are overwhelmed with chocolate."
"Clear, purplish-brown-amber body with a reasonably dense, light cocoa head. Sweetish dark raisins and prunes, toffee, and toasted bread aromas combine with a spicy hop backing. Will it taste as good as it smells? Um, no. Not bad though. Grainy, toasted bread malt comes through strongly. The dark fruit sweetness almost disappears. Light toffee sweetness and a hint of chocolate remain and are balanced by some moderately bitter (dark chocolate bitter) hops. Light to medium bodied, the mouthfeel is a little thin and soapy, but not bad and dries out in the finish. Overall, a decent beer that gets better as it warms a little."
"Overall Impression: Abita finally made it to Colorado! One of my favorite brown ales - nicely drinkable with great flavors."
"Not my favorite, but not bad either. A good brown ale, but there are better."
"Funky name for a darn decent brew. Pours an opaque dark coffee brown with a rocky tan head. Left thick lacework on the side of the glass. Smell of sweet malts is the dominat aroma. Some fruit, coffee and chocolate notes. This a rich smelling beer and the taste is up to the smell. The taste is richly sweet almost like a bock or even a doppelbock. There is a short dry finish with some taste of alcohol at the tail. Overall this is a brown ale to keep buying."
"Overall, not very good at all. I couldn't get past the smell, and the flavors were a mish-mash of things, many of which were a little off."
"Drank both on tap and out of the bottle and there was no difference in either aroma or flavor. The color was nice and the smell had a pleasant aroma of hops and maltiness. After that it was down hill with the flavor. The flavor came up short of what the aroma was and just didn't match up to what I had expected. But, it is a good summer quincher and a hot day!"
"Will finish the six pack and will look for more. Good stuff."
"Very dark brown hue with a really small ammount of head. Aroma is weak with a hint of toasted malts and sweetness. Flavor is very mild, some of that roasty malt from the nose and tinge of smokey character show up. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and overly carbonated, very light on the palate. One Turbo Dog is enough for me."
"Pours a dark chocolate brown with an off-wite, scattered head. The toffee aroma is followed by a chocolate and caramel malt flavor. Medium-bodied, moderately carbonated. This uniquely smooth ale finishes clean, but otherwise is an unimpressive beer for the style."
"sampled a 12 oz bottle, with new graphics and did have a ""best comsumed before date"" confusingly notched on the label. Poured typical darkish mahogony brown, clear, with a good looking tan tiny bubble head, leaves fine and well developed lacing. Mild malty nose, taste is mostly just a thin malt sweetness, notes of cafe au lait,vanilla, perhaps a bit of nuttyness. Could use some more malt and hops to kick up the character and complexity of this brew. As it stands now its "" a nice house, but nobody is home"" But would be a pleasant sessioner."
"I really wasnt expecting a whole lot, so the slightly roasty flavor caught me off guard. It was actually verging on being a porter in the flavor with chocolate and a bit of licorice (and an almost smoke). Slightly bitter in the finish. The only real drawback was that it was too bubbly and light bodied. It was a great poker beer though."
"12 oz. bottle pours a opaque dark brown color with a slight tan head. Smells of dark rye bread. Taste is buttery toasted dark cereal grains with a smooth malt sweetness. Full bodied, smooth mouthfeel. Minimal hop presence. A pretty good dark brew for the masses."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"All and all this would be a great beer to drink with food or to put into food. I'll keep some of this in my fridge at all times from now on."
"The aroma was primarily malty with some hints of smokiness that comes from the roasted malt. The taste is more smoky than I expected by with little real malt sweetness and almost no hops flavor. This felt a little oily in the mouth, but it could be a decent session beer."
"I have looking forwrad to trying the Abita Turbo Dog since it is not found typcially in Charlotte. Of course, the Flying Saucer had it available in a bottle. Since I am a big fan of Brown Ales, I thoroughly enjoyed most of its qualities. However, compared to other browns, it was nothing spectacular. Taste and mouthfeel highlighted the experience, especially at first taste. Hints of roasted nuts was a nice surpirse. I realized, however, that this ale was difficult to finish."
"I went to the store and chose this brew because I was in the mood for something darker. They were out of Guinness, so I figured I'd give this dark looking brew a taste. You could easily give this to a non-ale-drinking pal and have them polish it off as easily as a domestic light beer. It's tasty, but underwhelming."
"The smell was sweet and enticing. I noticed warm vanilla, coffee, and malt. The taste was outstanding, romantic and very smooth. Slight malt, chocolate to a slight bitterness and a lovely vanilla finish. Perfect beer with a chocolate mousse. This would be an easy all-nighter."
"Overall not too shabby, one of the better Louisana products I've had outside of the state."
"Overall Impression: Turbodog is well crafted. They got to where they were going with this beer. The taste is intentional; Im just not sure I like the recipe. There is too much chocolate malt or black patent (heavily roasted) malts for the style of English Brown, but Im not sure those Cajuns care. I could see others making a session out of this, but just a touch too dark for me."
"The only thing lacking in this brew was the aroma. Quite honestly my bottle smelled like a wet dog...I never encountered this smell before. But, aside from that all else was very nice. Appearance is an almost black amber with a head that diispates into a very nice lace. Taste...mmm. almost like a dry stout. lightly sweet with a hop flavor on the finish that is very nice. Mouthfeel is medium with a crispness and a dry finish that makes you want to take anothe sip. Very nice on the drinkability scale. Glad I tried it."
"It left me pleasantly surprised, since my last Louisiana beer was Dixie Voodoo. It is sweet and slightly heavy, but smooth enough for easy drinking. Ill be trying to work through their line, now that Ive seen what they have to offer."
"Notes: Too thin, watery, and carbonated for my taste. Not a bad taste or aftertaste. I think that it is a solid example of the style though, I only prefer stronger beers. The things it did well were keeping a good head, producing a nice aroma, and having a good flavor. As far as its comparison to other English Browns, I only can say that it is a tad thinner and more carbonated than most. Otherwise, good interpretation of the style."
"Pours a nice deep brown with ruby/mahogony hues. A fluffy white head about a quarter inch high appears and leaves a slight lace. Aromas are of coffee and cocoa with some roasted malts in the mix. This beer initially hits up with a nice roasty malt, followed by some nice cocoa and other chocolate flavors. A little sweetness finds its way in the mix but is quickly overridden by a nice bittery hop finish. This beer is medium to light bodied with a powerful carbonation that zings on the tongue throughout the experience."
" A good brown ale that is a true craft beer to be enjoyed."
"Pours a deep brown color, letting very little light through the glass. The head is almost all ut non-existant. It has a nose of chocolate. Mouthfeel is moderately heavy, but not thick, without much carbonatin. Taste is chocolate with a hop finish that stays on your tongue for a minute. There is little to no lacing. Overall a good brown ale. I wish it were not summer when I tried this. Will check it out again later in the season and see if that changes anything. I'd pick this up when craving a good change of pace."
"The beer poured brown, with a red tinger when held up to the light. THere was a thick, short lasting head to it. No lace clung to the side of the glass as I drank. The carbonation is fairly flat, it was only slightly noticeable. The were multiple layers of hops, which brought out a more flavorful beer than bitter. Definitely a quality beer, but not inspired to place this among my favorites."
"this company should work a little bit on improving their ugly packaging so that it is more representative of the quality that is inside these bottles."
"Turbo dog is one good beer, honestly it is much different than what I was expecting from it, something I would reccomend anyone try."
"This beer poured a cola-like brown color with red highlights when held to light. The head was light and fizzy but faded quickly and there was no lacing. The smell was very sweet and acidic as well, it burned my nostril hairs at first sniff. The taste offered more malty sweetness. Very sweet in flavor but weaker in body. A lot of brown sugar sweetness here and more dextrin sweetness as well. The sweetness wasn't offset by anything but it wasn't too sweet to be offensive (like malternatives are). This reminds me a lot of coke which means I like to drink it but it offers nothing that great to me beerwise. Definitely a good transition beer though."
"This is a solid brew. Its like a brown ale in that it is rather mild and medium bodied, but like a porter in that it has a nice chocolate roastiness to it. Exhibiting the finer characteristics of both Brown Ales and Porters, this is very enjoyable and I would gladly drink it again."
"Turbo Dog is my first of this style and I was hoping I'd like it as much as I remembered. Too bad, maybe I just don't love the style or maybe just not Turbo Dog."
"Very nice..."
"All apologizes to my sink, which suffered through more of this than I."
"This beer is highly drinkable. Much like Under Dog, the Turbo Dog goes down with you noticing. I think I finished my first Turbo Dog in 7 minutes...and I was not trying to drink it fast. It just - disappeared."
"This is just a great example of the style. One of my personal favorites that I always have stashed away for when I am feeling a little down. This brew always makes me happy."
"They categorize this beer as a Brown Ale, but I'd say it's outside the style guidlines, and more like a Porter. Not that this is a bad thing, this is IMHO their best beer. The beer pours with little head, is garnet in color, has a roasted-malt nose, and a big malt flavor. I had the pleasure of drinking one of these at the Abita Brew Pub in Abita Springs, and would highly recommend going there if you are ever in the New Orleans area."
"This Abita was a pleasant surprise, after a less than happy experience with their Purple Haze, several weeks ago. This is a tasty ale, with good drinkability. Do you have to go to New Orleans, to get this on tap?"
"A very dark amber brown with a tan head that fades quickly. There is some lacing, and it is well carbonated. The smell is not real strong but it is the delicious smell of dark malt. There is very little flavor, probably because it is too cold. What I can taste is good. The mouthfeel is good, not too watery, the carbonation helps but isn't too much. It is very drinkable. As it warms a little it seems to be getting a little more flavorful with a hint of chocolate and very little bitterness."
"Medium bodied, it didn't quite have it's mind made up about what it wanted to be."
"Drinkability - I would buy this again. Be patient and let it warm up, though, it's a whole bunch better."
"Pours a dark chocolate brown with a thin toffee head. Not quite opaque in the glass, but very dark. The aroma is very malty and sweet. An almost chewy mouthfeel carries a big -- somewhat surprising -- taste. Hints of honey, toffee, and (really?) peppermint. Very enjoyable and very drinkable -- I can see why this one has a cult following, coming from an area of the country not known for its quality of brew."
"Decent light brown head, disappeared after a minute. Dark cola brown colored beer with an amber glow. Lack of carbonation bubbles in the beer is evident in the first sip. A pretty light bodied beer, mildly creamy mouthfeel. The aroma is a little off, a little malted barley and caramel mixed with a cheap corn infused lager. The taste is pretty weak, some caramel, a bit of chocolate, with a flash of bitter hoppy coffee at the end. Get rid of the off corn flavor, add some carbonation, and you'd have a good drinkable brown ale."
"The mouthfeel is smooth with some crispness. The aftertaste is of roasted malts and burnt coffee and it lasts forever. I can't see drinking more than one of these in a sitting. Burnt flavor just too overpowering for a brown ale."
"Abita Turbo Dog is a decent beer with a lot of potential. Once again tonight I found myself at MacGregor's on my never ending quest for the perfect beer, I stumbled across this. Turbo Dog is a friend of mine that goes back a few months. Nothing spectacular, but very comforting. It pours a dark brown colour with a moderate to thin tan head that lasts for a couple minutes. Smelling of roasted malts with slight hints of citrus. The taste was remarkably likewise, highly malty with a slight, but distinct lemon zest to it. Not a bad beer. It went down smoot. I feel good with it. A great session brew."
"I can easily see pairing this with some classic bayou dishes like gumbo and jambalaya, as well as possibly being used as an ingredient in some of those dishes. Although this beer is slightly sweet, there is enough hoppiness here to make this a very drinkable beer. While not a very complex brew, this one still satisfies."
"Pretty average, but not bad."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Was poured from a 12oz bottle into a stemmed glass at Harry's Taproom in Arlington (not really a taproom, I'll be sure to add a BF review). Appearance is dark brown with a nice tan head. Aroma is of yeast and malt with a hint of chocolate. Nothing to knock your socks off though. Taste is quite pleasant. Hints of coffee and chocolate, along with a nice hop finish make it a very enjoyable beer to have with american-grill type fare. Its nothing earth shattering, but its tasty. Compared to the 30 odd offerings in bottles at this joint, it was a gem. I think they managed to have every crap lager in existence."
"Very drinkable. Well suited for pairing with sweet foods or very spicy foods. I have had this served with spicy jambalaya; it was a good match."
"A decent offering from Abita. Though Brown Ale isn't a personal favorite, I suppose this is a good one amongst the not-on-crack brown ale (Brooklyn Brown, Indian Brown) crowd. Good, but not great."
"Unfortunately, not nearly as good as I remembered it. I haven't had this beer in quite some time, and I guess my tastes have evolved a lot. Too much of the macro-type flavor in there. I got the impression that after a couple, this would get better. Hard to define, reminds me some of the Yuengling porter. Doesn't really fit any style, and ultimately doesn't impress. Better than the average macro lager, but so what."
"A decent pint, if a bit unchallenging. A smooth, easy drinking beer with very little bitterness. Certainly not the most complex beer on the face of the planet, but it was enjoyable."
"Tasted: 01/29/04"
"Turbodog is quite an anomaly as it doesn't fit neatly into a particular beer style mold. The body and mouthfeel are appropriate for a nut brown, but the roasted flavors are more akin to a stout (albeit a light one) and it is quite clean, almost lager-like. It pours a dark, dark mahogany with a thin off-white head. The smell is strong with dark roasted malts and it also has that quality I can only describe as ""beery"". Roasted malt dominates the palate but comes with some light toffee sweetness. Mildly spicy hops are noticeable but never come to the foreground. A bit thin and watery. Not an exceptional brew, but exceptional in its originality. This would make an excellent dark summertime session brew and would pair very well with spicy food."

"Overall: This is one of the better domestic brown ales I've had. I'll recommend this without hesitation. I also like the new label design."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick off-white head. The aroma is decent. It is full of roasted and crystal malts. It has a deep, rich, almost porter like scent. The taste is good. It has a smooth, dark flavor with a dry finish. It boasts of roasted, even black malts. The mouthfeel sucks like most of their beers. It is a medium/full bodied beer with too much carbonation. This is a good drinker, but the CO2 needs to be reduced."
"Pours a deep dark brown hue with a small creamy head. Rich malty nose, but not much on subtlty. Malt is about all you get. Sweet, creamy, rich malt taste. Flavor more or less vanishes after about two seconds. I like it - it seems to land somewhere between a brown ale and a porter. Not much for sessions, though; I max out at one per evening with this one."
"A good beer to have on a cold winter day."
"Great looking head and nice malt aroma to the nose. One of my favorite Brown Aless. Its drinkable, complex, and tasty. The taste? Big malted backbone covered with toffee, a hint of espresso maybe dark chocolate. Then half way through the roast emerges again. Fantastic. The body is just great and really showcases an English ale, it was a medium body but packs in the flavor. Well done. Ill have a pint of this with friends anytime. The bitterness from hidden hops shows up in the end. Refreshing."
"After I got through the initial surprise of the color, I found the beer interesting in its way. However, I wouldn't drink many in one sitting, maybe when I want just one beer, something different, outside the usual rotation of IPA's. It's a Bayou beer that would stand up well to piquant Creole and such related cuisines, so next time I'll see about having one with said food at a local establishment and maybe find it more a fitting accompaniment than soloist."
"On tap at the Dino. Pour was very pretty with a deep brown bordering on opaque with splashes of scarlet around the bottom with a odd grey tan head that unfortunately did not last too long. Smell was sweet with caramel and roasted grains with a slight dose of butterscotch underneath. The taste was very odd as each time I sipped it it started with the sensation that it was liquified sushi rice. This morphed into a grainier more brown ale style with some coffee hints in the undertow, but the rice flavor never really subsided. There was just a little bitterness hidden in the aftertaste, but no where near overpowering. Went well with my bbq, but not a beer to write home about."
"call it a brown ale. The mouthfeel is that of a ""lite"" beer. The hops flavor dissolves on the pallet and turns to water like consistency, although the finish is clean but not particularly long lasting. Overall Id lump it in the lighter bodied brown ale department. Not bad, but I believe there are better/more satisfying."
"Deep chestnut brown in color. Pours a mildly creamy light brown head that has minimal retention. Aromas are toasty, malty and inviting. A little bitter coffee/chicorky aroma can be found in the background. The mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium bodied. The taste is of a watered down stout with little hints of cocoa, some molasses, weak coffee-not much to urge another sip, while not totally boring. More bitter, weak, three hour old coffee flavors on the finish. An innocuous brown that might make a good red-eye gravy for a slice of Smithfield Ham?"
"Having Turbo Dog again reminded me why this is considered a classic mirco brewed ale. It lives up to its hype."
"This beer poured a ruby brown color and was topped off with a very creamy, almost Guinness-like head. Good carbonation. Theres some roastiness and caramel notes in the aroma, but overall weak in that regard. Is this a porter or a brown ale? Im not sure I could distinguish, but it doesnt matter because the flavor is very pleasant. Roasted chocolate, toffee, burnt coffee come through with a nice underlying bitterness. Very drinkable and well made."
"Dark brown with ruby highlights and a light brown foamy head. The head settles very quickly, and leaves oily spots of foam on the glass. Roasted malt aroma with hints of raisin and fig. Flavor is sweet malt, molasses and brown sugar, bitter coffee, and faint bits of cocoa. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel, moderate carbonation."
"Another of the tap beers at Beer Sellar, Newport, Kentucky. This beer has a dark amber to brown body with a creamy looking abd beige head. The lacing is very nice and consistent. The flavor is a bit hard to pin down, but ranges from a nice nuttiness to a smoother malt/grain sense. The feel is nicely sold, but does not impress of the creaminess so often found in this style. Overall this is a solid, if not impressive, beer."
"John"
"This was an interesting beer that pretty much defied description to me. At different points in my glass I would have guessed it was a Brown Ale, a Dunkel, or an Altbier. Points for being different. Pours a dark brown but clear, with a medium thick light beige head. Quick lacing. Aroma of malt, coffee and chocolate. Medium bodied with flavors of coffee, nuts and malt, with a sweet malty aftertaste. A good session beer, and the best from Abita I have tried."
"Tastes of a malt with tones of mild toffee with a medium body. Subtle tones of coffee flavor that lead to a slight bitter finish. Very nice. Great drinkability and wonderful beer that goes down smooth and easy. A great craft brew and a great example of the style"
"Never thought I would see this in Northwest Ohio, but to my surprise there she was at my local beverage center. I should have waited until I made my chicken fajitas to try it but i couldn't resist. It pours rather nicely with a thick light brown head that lasted about halfway through the glass. The color is accurately described in previous reviews, dark golden brown. The main surprise hit me with how light the mouth feel is for something so dark and with such a rich aroma. Great taste that didn't weigh on me and created a nice appetite. Can't wait to try it on draft."
"Poured a deep ruby color with a big light-tan colored head - it was rocky and cavernous and falling fast. But, it kicks up very fast again, and then when it sits it dies to nothing. Smelled chalky, woody, with some black and roast malt notes. Fairly light in profile. Taste was a malt kind of sweet, but not too strong, a little bit of hops, and some roasted notes. A smooth thin drink and a lightly drying finish. Good, well-known, good to have around."
"Served in a short 12oz bottle this little guy won my heart. It pours a nice dark color. The head quickly diminishes to only a lace. It makes it look like you are drinking cola. The taste of this wonderful brew is by far one of the best brews I've had. It is very smooth and goes down easy."
"Pours a deep brown color with an off white head. The head stays awhile and fades to a sticky lace. The lace stayed till the end. The aroma was earthy with hints of coffee and roasted malts. The taste was roasted malts with a coffee finish. A very satisfying smooth flavor made this a very drinkable beer. Nice mouthfeel and its solid taste makes this a good brew!"
"Overall, a solid brown ale, but definitely not as good as I thought it was years ago before I found the really good stuff."
"This is just simply a refreshing beer. I like the rich color, rich smell, and rich taste. It had a nice thick creamy head that retained well. The color was a nice deep, dark, red color. Had a very nice nutty taste, mixed with a hint of citrus and maltiness. I was very suprised by this little gem. You should try this one, you will be very suprised too. I gare-ron-teee!"
"Pours a thin head, but the head lasts a long time. The beer is a very dark brown, with not too much of a reddish tint. Smells pretty hoppy, and robust. Tastes strongly of smoky toasted oats. Very clean, pretty light moouthfeel. A true brown and highly drinkable."
"This beer poured a very dark brown almost black with a creamy dark tan head which lasted a long time. The lace was somewhat disappointing for such a good head. The smell of malt was fair and I could not detect much hoppieness. The taste was surpurb. The chocolate malt jumped out of the glass onto my tongue. The mouthfeel was a little weak but did leave a little creaminess behind. This is probably the best beer Abita makes. I have gone to beer shows and drank their entire line. The only ones I can stomach is the Turbodog and the Root Beer."
"Overall surprisingly better than expected, but not great."
"Pours a deep ruby red with some foam appearing after the pour. It smells alright with a fruity full-flavored cherry aroma. The taste is just okay with some dry maltiness. It leaves a thick aftertaste. It's a barely okay brew. Good thing my friend bought it."
"Great dark brown colour, and no head. Great sweet smell with some detectable malt in the nose. The taste isn't great, but its got some good qualities. This beer is similar in the mouth to other Abita brews. Medium-bodied and not overpowering, but not too flavourful."
"Pours a dark coca-cola colored brown with a modest 1-½ finger tan head. The smell consists of roasted chocolate malt and a very faint hop aroma. The taste mimics the smell in a watery kind of way. The aroma is deceiving in this manner as it almost smells as bold as a porter, but this is way more watery in taste than a light bock. It also has a weird twang mid-swallow of each and every swallow. The hops are barely noticeable and theres not much carbonation either. This beer is very light bodied and finishes very thin. This beer has way too much roastiness to be so lean. Strange brew this is! Cheers!"
"Dark brown pour with amber at the edges. Topped off with a cake of tan foam that collapses reasonably quickly to a lacy film. Wonderful rich malty, caramely smell. Somewhat watery, like other Abita offerings. A malty foundation throughout the drink with a nice crispness in the middle. Goes down easily but would benefit from being a tad more substantial."
"If a Brown Ale and Porter mated...Mahogany/Ruby in color. Amply malted with a pasty, mealy malt. The nose is malty and slightly sour with a hint of alcohol. The medium/high citrusy hops are mildly astringent. Started in 1986, one of the first micro-brews in the country. Extra roasted sweet malt becomes the dominant force as the glass empties. Almost creamy. Balanced. Very little head...pour it straight down. Id like to try this with some extra spicy Jambalaya. or chocolate. or nachos."
"My favorite of the Abita beers. Dark like a porter or is it a stout, but very smooth and crisp. The low alcohol and chocolatey mouth feel leaves you wanting more and it is very quaffable. It taste good alone or with something sweet and is very malty, but not too sweet."
"This is one interesting brew. For me, it seemed to be all about the finish. At first it was empty, then all the flavors just developed in the mouth and throat as you swallowed. The middle gets a malty sweet roasted barley with hints of slight hop and some yeast like unbaked bread. It also had some smokey hazelnut notes. I wanted this beer to taste like that the whole way through. If it would have this would be a whopper of a drinker. Its still very drinkable, a bit on the light side on the body, but I just can't get by that start. The smell is also very interesting, I smell the roasted barley malt easily but has a strange wet dirt like smell. Kind of like a heavy rained out hiking trail. Good color, was a semi blackened red almost clear glowing. I'm a perplexed by this stuff and I just kept drinking it, trying to figure out what the hells the scoop with it being so good."
"Mouthfeel: thin bodied (thinner than usual Browns and Milds), very tight carbonation, slight astringency"
"Brownish/ruby in color, with a very thin tannish head. Aroma is roasty, and slightly chocolatey. The chocolate comes out in the flavor, too. Roasted malt and a bit of toffee flavor dominates, while persistant carbonation gives the beer a medium-full body at most. Toffee sweetness really shows up as the beer warms, and the roasted malt and hop bitterness linger nicely. Quite drinkable, though it seems, in its roastiness, more stout or porter-like than like a brown ale."
"It's an interesting brown that gets a few extra points for originality."
"The flavor is very sweet with a great roasty malt taste also. You can pick up a little yeastiness. Carbonation is almost non-existent, which hurts the mouthfeel because I would really like it to be crisp. It is very drinkable, and a good solid beer, but nothing to jump up and down about."
"Appropriately brown for a Brown Ale. This beer has a sweet edge and a high level of carbonation. Fruit and grainy/yeasty notes in the mix.Overly malted and underhopped in my opinion. I thought the mouthfeel would be creamier than it was. I had heard great things about this beer and admit to being a little disappointed. probably just not my style. Not a terrible beer but not one that I would seek out again."
"I think TurboDog is Abitas most interesting beer (though the 2002 Christmas beer isnt bad and I havent been able to get my hands on a few of their more promising beers, like Andygator or their Red)."
"Taste was full, rich, rounded but had a bit of a harsh quality I did not particularly care for. Tasted dead on though to what I consider to be the American brown style. Has a creamy mouthfeel and was mildly complex. A solid beer that could stand to be slightly more smoothed out overall."
"Strong malty nose with a hint of the hops. The taste was very malty with a bitter hop finish that was a bit rough on the palate. Probably not allowed to age enough. This beer is a bit immature for my taste and lacks refinement. There was a strong alcohol smell to the nose also that I am not a real big fan of. Over all not a great beer. In general not a lot to say bout this one - I was not impressed. Will do in a pinch and was something new to try but I don't see myself picking it up at the store with all the other great choices."
"Dark brown color, medium head. Roasted malts, slightly hoppy. Nicely balanced. Lighter bodied, but full flavored. Nice malt flavor. Mouthfeel is a little thin but tolerable.Finish is clean. Aftertaste is somewhat malty and slightly bitter."
"a re-review. deep dark brown color, little head and no lace. sweet roasted malt nose. begins smooth, with a buttery caramel/choco/toffee taste. ends really crisp with lingering malt flavors. a touch of hops to balance. seems a lot livelier than the first time i reviewed it and less smooth. a nice brown ale. thanks to my gf for bringing up an abita sampler pack from louisiana"
"Poured a dark brown in color with ruby hues as light shown through along the sides of the glass. Head was tan in color. A lot of bubbles were present, showing signs of carbonation. Aroma consisted mainly of chocolate malt with hints of molasses. Smooth, full-bodied mouthfeel with a good carbonation. Taste consisted mainly of chocolate malt with a subtle fruitiness in the balanced finish. A decent, very drinkable brown ale."
"I do recommend!"
"Pours a dark brown color with a thin tan colored head. Nose is buttery toffee and caramel with a hint of citrus. Taste is dominated by toasted malts with notes of dark coffee and bitter chocolate. Smooth and very drinkable."
"In the glass it had a dark brown almost black color, a tan/beige head. The aroma was of a roasted malt, caramel, and hints of chocolate. The taste was semi-sweet, hints of malt, chocolate roasty, some bitter at the end. A good beer"
"Deep reddish-brown body, with a bit of CO2. Small head that fades quickly. Very sweet and malty aroma, with hints of coffee and cane sugar. Sweet malty taste, with just a hint of hop bitterness in the bittersweet finish. Slightly rough mouthfeel, oily and a bit thick. Overall, it's just too sweet for the style, but still pretty drinkable."
"One thing, I need a year on my ""best by"" date a whole lot more than the day of the month."
"Pours a dark brown body with limited tan head formation that disappears.  The aroma is a spicy hop base with a roasted malt background.  The taste is rather muddled with a warm alcohol note present on the tongue along with roasted malt flavors.  The body seems a tad light.  This is a decent brown ale that is nothing special, but better than some versions I have sampled."
"Nice deep brown color, head is fine-bubbled and persistant -- but not very big at 1/8 of an inch.  Sense of a buttery toffee to the aroma.  Malty flavor is very soothing, sense of a light toffee and a good deal of sweet-style chocolate.  I have a lot of difficulty finding a hops backing for this beer, its pretty unbalanced.  But its light body and sweetened character make this pretty drinkable."
"Deep ruby brown in color with a creamy light tan head. Even with a rough pour the head won't come up much, but it will hold fairly well once it's there leaving a thin surface covering throughout the glass. The aroma is lightly chocolatey and toffee-ish with some minor grassy hops. The body is medium/light with a fine, moderate carbonation that caresses the tongue. The flavor follows the aroma with a chocolate and toffee-like maltiness balanced by a mild bitterness and light grassy hop flavor. It finishes semi-dry with a lingering hop bitterness and some more roasty cocoa notes."
"The beer pours a deep clear garnet to brown color, the head is mountainous, the lace in thick glutinous sheets, both light chocolate brown in color. Nose is malt, nutty sweet, caramel, fresh and clean. Front is malt sweet, the top skimpy, the finish is gently acidic, sparsely hopped, the aftertaste malt dry. A bit too much malt, and a tad to little hops for me to rank it very high. A drinkable beer none the less, and would do well in putting out the fire after eating some ""Over The Top Cajun Food""!"
"A healthy dark brown liquid this. A coffee ice cream colored head behaves normally. Aromas suggest scorched caramel custard and tootsie rolls. The flavors are dry and include slightly metallic, dusty, dry grain, milk and 3-Musketeers nuances. A sugarless candy experience. Easy to drink."
"Turbodog is a very dark reddish brown ale, solid head and a lot of carbonation, good mix of hops and malt but with more sweet malt than hops.  Smooth and very roasty finish.  The ABV is 5.0%."
"from the bottle and poured vigorously, gave a great light carmel colored head. deep brown with good carbonation, maybe a little to much. smell of roasted malt and carmel. light easy hop in flavor, but mostly chocolate and roasted sweet malt. toffee-ish. have to agree with the dry. leaves the mouth almost cotton like, but not in a bad way. if your looking for a dry sweet ale, this is a good one. probably go very well with beef. full-medium body."
"A heavier product from Abita. Very coffee like. Has a great pour and trickles and trances down the glass with grace. A strong but pleasant aroma. Strong appearance. Highlights of a roasting flavor compliment the overall experience."
"Pours a deep brown with a nice brown head on it that leaves some decent lacing down the glass.  Very strong dry roasted aromas with an almost husky feel to it and some slight peatish type characteristics.  Intesne roasted malt all the way through this one with a nice chocolate turn towards the end and some coffee hiding in the background.  This has a surprisingly dry taste and finish and is rather husky much like an altbier.  The huskiness is a nice surprise and sets this brew apart from others.  A very drinkable brown ale and I am very impressed that this seems to be the beverage of choice for LSU fans."
"I don't recall who made the Coca-Cola comment before, but surprisingly, this beer kind of looks like Coke. It struggles to hold a head and features substantial carbonation. The nose is of roasted (caramel) malt. The taste is quite similar with the caramel malts taking priority over the hops that seem to be trying to penetrate through. This beer is a little too carbonated for me, but it's drinkable and it's not a bad one."
"If Coca-Cola made beer, this would be it. Very carbonated and tasting more like a cheap porter than a brown ale. It's coffee taste is fleeting and without residual swetness."
"This beer poured a nice dark reddish amber color that formed a nice bubbly light tan head that left some nice lace when it subsided.  The aroma was of malt malt and toffee.  The flavor was of malt, caramel and toffee.  The finish was medium and had a slightly toffee aspect to it.  Not a bad beer."
"The only way I knew about this beer is that Emerl Lagasse swears by it (as well as Brooklyn Brewery) on TV.  It certainly was not bad.  Although I would need to have another one in order to get a better understanding of it.  Decent aroma and solid drinkability make this beer a refreshing choice with some spicy grub ro just for the heck of it!  Bottoms up!"
"Turbodog:  at the very least, I like the name.  For a brown ale, it’s as black a beer as I’ve seen lately.  Very nice rich head, clinging to the side the whole way down.  Strong malt (burnt/chocolate tastes).  Nice hints of licorice in the first taste, and throughout the aftertaste, although there are slight hints of grain as well.  Very nice."
"On draft...... Deep dark brown, nearly black color, with a marshmellow soft tan head. Served in a skiny pilsner glass.  Deep roasted chocolate malt smell, some toffee in there as well. Tasted actually very sweet, chocholate, smooth, and creamy. Pleasant surprise, when the bartender sensed my interest and brought me a bottle to read the label. Nice touch ! Went down very easily and complimented the overpriced food rather nicely. I will definitly order this on tap, if I see it again."
"Pours a deep amber brown with a lavish tan head, lots of sticky lace.  Strong malt aroma with fruit and bittersweet chocolate.  The malt flavors form the foundation for this beer, but notes of toffee and chocolate are present as well, and towards the finish there are mild hops and hints of fruit.  An absolutely glorious brown ale."
"An excellent microbrew. I think of Turbo Dog as a specialty brew, because it really does not conform to any particular style. Chocolatey, toffeish and definitely malty; I can drink this stuff with just about anything. It does not have any outstanding negatives in my mind.  Definitely worth getting if you can get it fresh."
"Pours a deep brown with a wispy off white head. The bartender was not sure exactly what style it was and my first impression was a porter/brown ale hybrid. A bit sweeter and thicker than your typical brown ale, but not as full bodied as a porter. Roasted malts leave some caramel on the palate, with enough hop complexity to balance the brew nicely. This beer was new to me and I had to judge it with no background. A brown ale but a hefty one."
"The beer is a dark ruby with a nice tight beige head.  Musty smell.  Not bad though.  Taste consists of an obscure roasted flavor.  A bit of chocolate.  And small hop bite.  Medium body.  A bit of an eccentric brown.  Not bad but not good either."
"A very nice brown ale, especially when in New Orleans! Medium to deep translucent brown, with a slight off-white head. Faint chocolate and toffee aromas. Taste is mildly sweet, with hints of chocolate and toffee. Some bready flavors as well. Finish is slightly bitter, but not overwhelmingly so. Not a heavy beer by any means, this is actually quite refreshing and drinkable."
"I had this brew in Boston from the bottle.  It was harsh and not what I would call a quality brew.  It might have been old considering the source and location, but the whole sixer had the same qualities."
"Light brown in color and very clear.  The dense persistent off - white head leaves Belgian lace down the glass. Slight buttery and caramelly notes along w/ mild chocolate malt notes make for a pleasant aroma.  The relatively low carbonation level for style facilitates the smooth mouthfeel.  Dextrinous and medium bodied. Chocolate, diacetyl butterscotch and crystal malt sweetness are the dominate flavor components, but hop bitterness provides sufficient balance.  The mildly earthy and slightly spicy Willamette hop flavor is quite welcome.  Turbo Dog finishes w/ a touch of roasted grain bitterness and sweetness.  It's been ages since I've had this brew.  Definitely better than a lot of American browns out there.  It was a nice surprise."
"Notes: A prize brown ale and a cult classic among the micro drinkers. An exceptional example of the style."
"Didnt get much of a head on mine,nice color.Kinda buttery tasting?Can taste the alcohol in it thats for sure.Decent,but kinda overhyped."
"Great dark red color, almost black. Flavorful and balanced. Enjoyable and versatile Southern beer. I wonder what it's named for."
"This beer had a very funky taste reminiscent of a bad homebrew.  Not a good one, try Brooklyn Brown instead."
"Beautiful and dark.  A rich pouring beer, pleanty of head.  Looks more like a dark lager, but aromas suggest otherwise.  Nice dark chocolate and malt- both in the aroma and the taste.  Not too sweet, but rich and warming, definetely dark brown sugar.  Overall a wonderful beer."
"A little sweet and grainy, but overall a pleasant beer."
"A little rough around the edges and a tad to light for me.  The flavor is awesome though, it just doesn't hang around in your mouth long enough.  Still worth looking for and tasting."
