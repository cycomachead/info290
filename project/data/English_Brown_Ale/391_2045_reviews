"Ahhh, Trad. It's entirely possible that I've consumed more Traditional Ale than any other beer brewed in Alberta. The more I think about it, I'm positive that is the case. I'm reviewing this based on my most recent tasting (during the intermission of the Best of Banff Film Festival), along with distinct palate memory. Trad is far from the best brown ale you can buy. It pours nicely, smells like yeast and malt, and has a lovely Caramilk and walnut flavour to it. It's the granddaddy of Alberta craft beer and still a solid choice, 30 years later."
"Overall: A very solid if unremarkable English brown ale. I would recommend it."

"One of the first non yellow fizzy beers I had. This beer will always be a fav. It has a nice malt flavour and is always available in a pinch."

"Pours a light caramel to brown (light for the style) with two fingers of butterscotch foam. Aroma is sweet grainy malt, artificial vanilla extract, a faint hint of earthy herbal hops. Palate is smooth, sweet corn syrup, mellow toasty malt, carnival peanuts, some treacle, vanilla toffee notes, faint earthy hops. Mouthful is quite nice actually, silky smooth and decent body, some chewy malts. An underachieving brown ale that is a decent sessional if one is in an old school pub mood. Lacks nutty punch and swings way towards sweet but mellow malt."

"Not a remarkable English Brown Ale."

"Seems to be an ok beer. I haven't been a fan of brown ales ever, but this beer does not lean me towards them any further."

"Pours a very nice translucent dark brown, however my pour had very minimal head. Smells malty with some caramel hints. Good flavor of deep complex malts however it feels very thin in the mouth with very little carbonation, for me this is the biggest downfall of the beer."

"Greetings from Canada. Pours up to a fizzy buff head and clear light brown color. Aroma is a pleasing blend of toasty, sweet malt and a hint of hops. Flavor is a complex blend of with a toasted malts, caramel, nuts, butterscotch and enough nondescript hops to balance the whole thing out. Mouthfeel is light. Overall, I really liked this beer and would have some on hand at all times if I could. Also noteworthy was that this beer was sampled in Calgary where it was likely just days from the brewery so it was very ""fresh"" tasting."

"Overall - Definitely the best beer I've ever had from Big Rock. It's very drinkable and has a nice balanced taste. I won't rush out to buy more, but I'm glad I gave it a try. It's along the same lines as the Creemore Springs beer."

"Overall (4): My favorite local brown ale and a flagship beer for Big Rock. Great value for the price having a very enjoyable taste while still bring extremely drinkable."
"Overall, this is a very nice session ale. It's miles ahead of the newcastle I just had. I'll have to remember to have this more often when I go out!"
"In Calgary for a conference and tried the Big Rock Traditional Ale. The appearance was quite good. A rich amber color and thin white head that laced on the glass. The smell was a little undescripted, could smell the hints of malt. The taste was really nice. A good malt and caramel character made this beer quite easy to drink. This made the mouthfeel very easy and could session this beer with no problem."
"D - Certainly the most enjoyable Big Rock brew I've come across yet. Simple but flavorful taste and easy to drink."
"Final Grade: 3.16, a C+."
"Poured on tap intonation Nonic glass. A clear, dark amber with a thin skimming of head that left pretty good lacing. The smell replicates the taste of sweet toffee, malts and sugar candies. This was a smooth, creamy beer that was easy to drink and enjoyable. Overall, a local brewery that I would support if all beers were of this quality."
"Cool having a beer from Alberta, though."
"Did the trip to the beer store for this and I just might pick up another 6 next time I go."
"D: This is probably my favorite offering from Big Rock so far but that's not saying a whole lot. Their beers aren't bad but they aren't anything special. This one had the most complex flavor and aroma compared to the other ones. This would be a good session beer and a good choice in a bar full of macro beers."
"Overall this is a drinkable and refreshing beer with some decent characteristics. This is a worthy beer from Big Rock's collection."
"Well carbonated, medium body make for a nice drinkable fresh glass of draught. Nothing outstanding, bus as one of the most commonly found taps in Alberta, you could do far worse."
"On tap at The Imperial Pub in Toronto. Pours an amber-brown colour with very thin white head that dissipates to nothing pretty quickly, leaving almost no lacing. Smells of sweet caramel, toasted barley and very mild hop aroma. Flavour is quite sweet. I have a soft spot for this beer as I used to drink this when I was a teenager in Alberta, but going back to it I realize there are much better examples of the style. Objectively, not worth drinking again. Emotionally, I have a soft spot for this beer."
"Drinkable- A very sessionable beer, albeit very average."
"Big Rock Traditional was in fact at the top of my drinking 'playlist' on a recent trip to Alberta. Part of that had to do with the fact that it was so widely available, in particular in establishments that otherwise didn't offer half-way decent beer. But hey, in the world of widely distributed commercial beers, you can do a lot worse than this. A lot worse."
"D - Quite drinkable. One of the better brews from Big Rock."
"D: Drinks quite easily, wouldn't be a bad session beer."
"Drinkability - goes down very easy and is not boring. I can pack several of these away with no issues. Nice to get the nutritional information on the box as well!"
"Actually, a good little ale, great for a session. I had no problems drinking this, and will enjoy the rest of my 6 pack! Not the best brown (pale?) out there, but certainly a fine brew."
"Overall, seems like an average EBA at best. Appearance and drinkability are the highlights but both the nose and taste are watered down and bland. There's plenty of room to pack more flavour in for sure. Much rather have Rogue, Black Oak or Garrison's EBA offering."
"Final Thoughts: I'm noticing a trend with Big Rock, and that is that funky malt flavor. All in all this was a decent beer, but I wouldn't say I was impressed by it by any means, and would not buy this beer if it wasn't in the mix pack. Worth a try, but not much more."
"Trad is the industry's standard here in Calgary, nothing worth bragging about but nothing too be ashamed of either"
"Body between light and medium. Low carbonation. Smooth and easy to put back. Easy drinking and sessionable."
"Poured with a small, off-white head that disappeared quite quickly to a haze on top of the beer. No lacing. Body was very clear, and dark amber in color. I enjoyed the aroma... light malt and hops, with something else quite pleasant that I couldn't put my finger on. Body was light to medium on the palate, and slightly oily/creamy, with lively carbonation. Nice flavor that starts off slightly sweet, but finishes with a light bitterness, yet short duration. Overall a pretty enjoyable beer that would make a good session ale (although there seems to be some confusion from different sources over exactly what class of beer this is)."
"D - I'll need to pick this up again and add a proper appearance note, but as for the other aspects of this beer I was very impressed."
"I'm certain there are better examples of this style out there, but I find this beer to be so damnned drinkable, when I am in the mood for anything from Big Rock..."
"Big Rock calls this an English Brown, and I think that is a better description than APA. It compares well with Newcastle, maybe a touch better. Overall, it is fairly average, but a safe bet. It is available everywhere in Alberta, and a good alternative to the big macros."
"Overall the beer is on my growing list of decent, but sessionable Canadian micros."
"This beer is pleasant to drink, inoffensive, middle-of-the-road, but tasty nonetheless. I'll note that I'm not reviewing this as an APA, as the brewer doesn't consider it one. It's closer to an english-style brown, and it hits pretty square in the middle for that style."
"It's characterful enough to be interesting, but no so much as to impede drinkability."
"A rather easy to put away, if not overly complex brown ale, consistent with all of my university drinking years in the 90s. I will credit Big Rock with providing the gateway experience that allowed me to enter the beer-drinking world without first having to endure the typical small-town fate of BMC-only hegemony. And while I will always prefer it on tap - the lower carbonation just lends itself to the heady malt flavours, not to mention the memories of 6 dollar shared pitchers - the single-serve packaging is just as enjoyable right here and now."
"D: If you are looking for a cheap APA with an unterrible taste this is the beer for you, otherwise stick with a SNPA, which is pretty affordable and has much more to offer."
"D- While I like this beer and think Big Rock has done a decent job here, I wouldn't be able to enjoy this all night, as it is a little on the sweet side. However, it is a good beer to have with a meal, say BBQ'd ribs with s milder sauce....as well, this would do nicely as an after dinner drink. A decent brew!"
"D: this is actually one of the better offerings from Big Rock IMHO, but still far from fantastic and too sweet to make it easily drinkable. I would drink it again if offered, but I won't be buying it again."
"Drinkable beer, but you would probably be looking for something with a bit more flavour in your next one."
"A decent APA from an unexpected brewery."
"Like all Big Rock's brew, overly carbonated. I sort of enjoyed it, but I could see getting pretty sick of it after the first one."
"Pours a nice deep mahogney reddish color with 1 finger tan head that turns to a thin collar and stays put till the end,some mild lacing.Nice malty smell comes at you with some sweet fruits blending in there somewhere and some caramel and prunes.Taste is kinda sweetish to start and the malts and fruitness kicks in along with a tinge of caramel and some mild bitterness and finishing off dry,very good tasting and quite enjoyable.Medium body feel to this one and some mild carbs all going down easily,would make for a good session beer.This beer reminds me of the one i had at Moxy's,the Big Life Ale,both made by Big Rock....hmmm,i wonder."
"A dark brown colour with a light brown head, settled with some lacing. Moderate carbonation. Smells of rye bread, caramel. Mild hops, nothing to write home about, bitter in the mouth with a bitter finish, a bit of a cleansing sensation. Hints here and there of caraway seeds and melba toast. Not great, not bad either - just so-so."
"D - Kind of an average brew. Not macro-boring, but a very basic beery beer that doesn't offend."
"This beer is almost reddish in colour. The aroma is decent, but nothing to write home about. At best, I can describe slightly malty. It felt 'perky' on the tongue, with quite a bit of carbonation. The flavour tasted a little malty with hints of grass and orange. It went down quite well however."
"Pours a translucent auburn with a little bit of head, not much creaminess. Nose is fairly hoppy and floral as well as noticeable graininess with a slight bit of malts. Taste is alright, mostly hops and not much character IMHO. Mouthfeel was a bit watery. An OK beer."
"This is a common beer for me when I'm out at a pub that has mostly macros, it is a good fallback. I'd say it is in the wrong style category, even on the can it is listed as an English Brown, and that seems about right to me. May explain some of the lower scores too, as some people might have been looking for a hoppy APA."
"Final Statement: Very basic sessional ale. Not offensive, not remarkable. Good companion to my chilli."
"As a whole, this beer doesn't have any characteristics to recommend it to others, but I wouldn't turn it down if I was offered one. Last note--I find this beer to be a bit too watery."
"Pours a clear reddish copper, thin white head forms, settles to a decent layer, no lacing. Smell is sweet and malty, citrus and toffee, not much going on, some grass, but not offensive. Taste is stale malt, figs, fruits, little bit of citrus, kind of lemony in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. Not good, not bad, just kind of on the low end of mediocre, but as expected from Big Rock."
"Pours a deep copper with a very small light tan head that fades quite quickly and leaves little lacing. Smell is very malty, loads of caramel and nuttiness, but not a whole lot else. Taste is bready at first, touch of caramel and a faint metallic note. Barely noticeable hop bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is rather thin, slightly undercarbonated, and not very satisfying, and drinkability is decent. About what I've come to expect from Big Rock: macro quality beer in micro packaging."
"-drinkability: as iv'e said this is my ""usual"" so i think it is highly drinkable, awsom with sharp cheese (or nachos)"
"I think this is the best of the Big Rock beers that I had on my trip to Banff. Dark copper colored pale ale, it may be a little dark for style, but a strong malty base give the beer a good mouthfeel (sometimes hard to find in Canadian beer). Very reminiscent of northwest pale ales like Sierra Nevada. A strong aromatic hop but not overly assertive compared to the fruity esters and malty base of the beer. In many of the bars, this became my back up beer of choice, and on tap it opens up a bit more compared to the can I am reviewing now. If you see a row of Big Rock and Sleeman on the tap, go Traditional."
"Decent mouthfeel with some good cleansing and medium bodied. Overall, this beer is OK. Not bad in a pinch. Nothing too exciting."
"Appeared more like an amber ale with a translucent, copper color and a off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves a touch of lacing behind. Moderate level of carbonation. Aromas of enriched milk, syrup, and burnt toast; not very appealing, the combo, that is. The taste was mostly sweet with a touch of bitterness in the finish. Flavors of smoked, roasted sugars seemed to come out. A bit astringent though and somewhat chalky in my mouth. Had a pint of this and I didn't want another. Seems like some artifical flavoring was added to this one with the subtle taste of syrup."
"Drinkability: An easy to drink and easily likeable PA. I would drink it again if it was local."
"Drinkability- Nothing special here. Drank half of it and used the rest to cook our pork roast in."
"Regardless this ale is well done, though not outstanding. It makes a good session ale, and is easy to drink."
"A nice copper coloured ale with a good amount of carbonation. I tend to think of this one as a kind of ""suped-up"" and less adjunct ladden Labatt 50. Well balanced hop and bready-malt flavor, and the carbonation makes it quite refreshing. Tastes quite fresh, even though it came out of a can. A bit watery, but still a good everyday beer. Bottled samples I've had have been a little inconsistent, but the can and draft samples have been far more reliable."
"D: More flavour than a macro, but not a lot. It shouldn't offend the average drinker."
"Tastes nice and toasty. Bready, caramel, toasty notes and a good bits of hops at the finish. Incredibly drinkable with buddies, one friend commented when sharing the pitcher, ""I have to stop myself, it just dissappears if I just get talking and forget not to drink"". Very true."
"I had two of these, one each on seperate nights and each time they tasted slightly different. The one night it seemed quite bland and slightly sweet, the other night it seemed very sweet. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. While this isn't something that reaches out and grabs you, it is a decent beer and worth drinking on occasion."
"D- I really thought of this more as an American Brown Ale than an APA. It had much more malt depth with hops playing a nice supporting roll. It was a nice session beer when sitting in the Canadian Rockies."
"It has a great tan and foamy head that lasts for probably 3/4 of the way down, and laces the glass nicely."
"Thx"
"355 ml can.  Probably the most popular Big Rock product. Color is a coppery red. Almost no head, leaves a patchy cap of surface foam, small amount of lacing. First smell is sweet, sugary malt with slight caramel. Taste is sweet and grainy, light bitter to finish, but overall well balanced and no after taste. Medium body, and easy to drink. If you are expecting a ""traditional ale"" you might be dissapointed because it is somewhat characterless. Has no overpowering strong points, just good all around."
"Poured with almost no head at all, but retained a small lace through the whole glass. Brown colour, not very pale at all. Malt and nuts on the nose. Taste is nutty with mild alcohol and a bit of sweetness in the middle. Mouthfeel isn't spectacular, but I like the taste, so I give this a higher drinkability rating as I find it a very good session beer. I much prefer it on tap as I have had many times on visits to Calgary. I usually start to crave this beer in the Autumn, when I want something a little darker, but not very. Not a bad offering from Big Rock."
"Very clear coppery red colour. Off-white head quickly subsided to a thin lace. Malty aroma with some caramel and light nuttiness. The flavour was a bit disappointing, with some grainy sweetness to start and finishing with a very light bitterness. It's almost as if the flavour disappears part way through. Medium/high carbonation and light body with almost no aftertaste."
"Acid is also the key, she's giving me stomachaches."
"Worthy, however, with the drinkability of a Sam Adams lager. Maybe that should be different for this style, but get past the divergence with its proclaimed style and it's worth drinking."
"Pours a dull dark copper color with a crackly head that fades fast. Soft malts and some floral hops make up the aroma. The flavor is of sweet malts and some funny yeast taste. The hops are not very noticeable. This beer was a dissapointment to me. Its seriously lacking in the hop department and has a very bland run of the mill flavor. The finish is clean but way too watery. This beer is like an amateur extract hombrew."
"Some decent malt then bit of hopbitterness and aftertaste. Medium texture and watery. Rather bland. Not much hops. Canadian relying on balance. Water and sugar. Slight fizz and yeast mid-sip. The type to have cold as refreshing as you are not missing anything."
"It's drinkable, and unthreatening. I guess that's why soooo many people drink ""trad"" here in Calgary. It's not a pale ale, and it's not a *great* beer, but it's not bad."
"Had this on tap in many Calgary and Edmonton pubs...flows like water here as BR has sewed up the draft market locally. Tapped a crystal clear darker amber, slight white cap that doesn't last long. Slight hints of citrusy and grassy hop, boiled grains in the aroma. Starts light and rather timid for a traditional english dark ale ale but then the fuller body kicks in midway with the well balanced hop and malt departure the finish is clean with a lingering ""bread"" after taste. As commercial Canuck ales go this is probably the best of the lot but still lacking. It's another attempt to ""Canadianize"" a traditional ale style for the mass market....it is always a compromise....but as compromises go this one has retained a modicum of ale character to make it king of the commercial Canuk ales."
"Sorry. Can't recommend this one."
"A nice cloudless amber color as it sets in the glass, head is adequate, frothy and a winsome beige color, as is disappears a nice sheet of lace is left behind to hide the glass. All malt nose, sweet and clean a satisfactory sniffer, sweet malt start, once again a bit thin on top for me, but nothing I cant live with. Finish is sternly acidic, the hops pleasant in their spiciness, quite dry and a fine drinking beer especially in the hot summer months."
"This is the first microbrew I ever tasted, way back in the day. It was also my standard as a teenager and in my early college days (I was a beer snob even back then). Better than anything else available at the time. I strayed away over the years, in pursuit of new brews, and feel I have come full circle. It's good to come home, been a while since I sampled a Trad. Now I can fully appreciete it. Pours out a clear reddish-amber tone, decent heat to begin with, but it fades away to a lacy ring in time. Nose is of rich malt, intense hops, wood smoke, a hint of spice, and an even fainter hint of melon. Taste is an impressive balance of malt and hops, one receeding behind the other, nice full mouthfeel, and goes down smooth. The golden standard of Big Rock, it lets you know what real ale should taste like. A perfect session ale, it leaves one satisfied. A close 2nd behind their McNally's Extra Ale for top quality."
"Recomended."
"counterparts. Cheers."
"A good standard example of an american ale.  Worth drinking."
"It is readily available in Alberta both in bottles and on-tap; I have heard they are exporting to California, though I'm not sure which styles."
