A bit of that continues in the taste, but the addition of caramel is what stands out, as well as some stale hop bitterness that I found a little off-putting.  Surprisingly light bodied compared to the strong aroma.  It's good, but I would have liked a bit more in the body to match the amazing aroma.","thebeers","Jan 17, 2015"

Definetely picking out the chocolate malt in the flavor and black malt in aroma, and perhaps the sugar additions gives it that molasses flavor. A little surpised at the light booziness. Pretty sure it's there but perhaps just my palate tonight.","mclaughlindw4","Nov 25, 2014"

Saint Botolph's has a rustic character indeed, with sharp, very-slightly sour notes effervescing above the rich sweetness of the malt. I've had darker browns, but perhaps not truer; the roasting is exquisite and not at all overdone, like some browns, nor is it overly rich or sweet or in any other sense trying too hard to hit the ""brown"" mark. I'm a fan of this style, and this crisp, clean, softly piquant offering is one of the best iterations I've tried. The only downside is it isn't sold in six-packs.","OrestesMethuon","Jun 14, 2013"

If malt can be described as nectar, this comes close - not so much because it is thick or too sweet, but because the sweetness is so well integrated with the aroma. So are the yeasts, the herbal hops, the roasted flavors. This is a remarkable brown ale. Though it is bitter, this is a textbook example, for me at least, of how elegantly bitter flavors can be integrated into the overall picture. Amazing.","angusdegraosta","Jun 08, 2013"

Picking up slight hops in the aroma along with roasted and bready malts, touches of something like dark chocolate, caramel and maybe something burnt and/or toffeeish (not real specific, I know). Thicker, fuller-bodied than most browns, smooth and goes down easy, I enjoyed this beer but it was just a tad off for me. The sweetness from the beer seems to derive from dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, and yeast and is balanced with not only a larger-than-normal earty hoppiness but roasted, toasted, possibly burnt malts and a cracker-like dry breadiness that almost creates a chewey sensation. Unfortunately, as I slowly sipped the beer and it warmed, the taste (I won't say the ABV b/c it is not even at 6) seemed to go towards the dryer parts of this beer and the smoothness dipped a little, so basically the beer became dry and husky and the sweetness and the touch of hops subdued. A good beer but not my personal favorite for this style.","clayrock81","Apr 07, 2013"

3.91,-4.4,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"The beer pours a beautiful caramel brown like a light roast coffee with a light creamy head that sits at a sticky half of a finger’s width and leaves a thin sticky wall of spatterwork lacing. The beers body is dark but seems clean, and there are lots of bubbles coming up the sides from carbonation. The beer smells richly malty with a nice lactic souring to the back of the smell. The nose is reminiscent of brown sugar and dark fruits or craizens (cranberry raisins). There are faint roasty notes, but the lactic sour overpowers them swiftly and is a little off-putting. The beer tastes wonderfully roasty and nutty with notes of brown sugar and biscuity malts. The tastes begins with faint lactic sours and then opens up into big roasted nut flavors before closing back to roasted burn with hints of lactic sugars, like in a milk stout. I am, of course, aware that these aren’t really lactic sugars or sours that I taste, but that is the best I can do to describe them, so bare with me. The sour gives hints towards slight pear, raisin, and apple flavoring before it is burnt away. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, kissing the tongue with barely any hint of prickly carbonation, and only a smooth blanket of chewy beer. The tongue is left quite dry and slightly burnt as the beer leaves, which definitely encourages more liquid to calm it down. There is also a slight tea astringency/tightness to the tongue reminiscent of hops bitters, but different and slightly earthy. Overall this is a tremendously odd ale that perfectly defies definition in true Pretty Things style. It is a delightful sipper, weighing in just above a session ale, but goes down nicely. Another great beer from Pretty Things, and worthy of a sip, though I liked Collaboration #3 with Boulevard Brewing more in terms of similar beers.","Maxwell","Oct 07, 2012"

4.17,2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Overall (4/5): Pretty Things' Saint Botolph's Town is a solid brown ale, one that I think is pretty unique in its hoppy dryness and rustic earthy tones. While I favor Dogfish Head's Indian Brown, this is also a very good American interpretation of a traditional English style. Perhaps not the best Pretty Things beer, but a good choice as the seasons change and the cool fall air settles in.","hagbergl","Sep 17, 2012"

The aftertaste is vague toasted brown bread and some prune. It has too much of a burnt-bitter spicy quality that tends to dominate too much and ends up, after initial promises of complexity, being rather one-dimensional and thin of character, whilst at the same time being rather heavy. It settles on very much a simple but heavy burnt bread/prune character with vague spicy bitterness and nothing else.","Offa","May 04, 2012"

The aroma brings malty coffeee-charcoal with some nice citrus hop nuances . The flavor is much the same with grapefruit blended with the brown bread malt. There's a nutty brown bread backbone that evolves into more coffeee. This is a medium body brew with an easy drinking and low carbonation feel.

Strong, almost metallic minerals, pure malted barley, dry roasted peanuts, bitter greens (almost mustardy or radishy), honey, oak, and tobacco all check in. The overall impression is toasty, fortified, and brown, but also dry and somehow light, and it leaves a long, fruity, woody aftertaste. Very interesting and unique without being odd – a beer for all seasons, and one you can drink if you can't decide between something English, something Belgian, or something American.","soulgrowl","Feb 09, 2012"

The body's medium and it's creamy-smooth once it's warmed a bit. It reminds me of an English-style ""Old Ale"" rather than just a simple ""brown ale"". It's got a kind of brown malt character going on, and it's got a lot of dark caramel that borders on being almost like burnt sugar. It's a hint sweetish but there's a fairly solid bitterness behind it, and a hint of dark malt acidity as well, which lends to the balance and leads into a dry finish where the leafy hops finally appear. You can drink it straight-forward, or you can relax and sip it. Quite charming!","NeroFiddled","Jul 06, 2011"

It is an excellent, full-flavored beer, something I'm always looking for these days, having tired of the massive overhopping of American craft beers. This is a beer with a strong malt profile, more aggressive in its flavoring than most of the English ales it takes as its progenitors.

Iconic to the style, this has the body of a Belgian dubbel and the flavors of a really nice American brown ale. Rich roasted malts, a touch of coffee and toasted almonds and hazlenuts on the palate. Has a real buttery finish that coats the palate nicely. Mouthfeel is very full bodied, a real food friendly beer. Nice on a cool night and will definitely be making another appearance in my fridge.

There was also slight faint toffee and hop notes. The roasted malts dominate the flavor with a nice almond nutty accent and faint caramel , toffee, and slight hop character. The beer was medium body with a good amount of carbonation that had a sweet nutty and slight hop bitter finish.

There's a large toffee head that leaves behind a good amount of lace. The smell is off bready malts and a hint of yeast spiciness that's very reminiscent of a belgian beer. This is a wonderfully complex beer, with some malty sweetness and the aforementioned spiciness that show up in the nose, as well as some earthy hop flavors lurking in the background. It's like a well done blend of a brown ale and a belgian strong dark ale. The carbonation is nice, stopping appropriately short of being prickly, but the body is a little thin, and I find myself wishing it was a little creamier.

4.27,4.4,4.5,5,4,4,4,"From a 22 ouncer that was bottled Dec. 2009 and comes from Batch Four. Sampled on March 16, 2010. The pour is a handsome mahogany with ruby and pine hues thrown in for good measure. The light, puffy head is about three inches thick and it eventually simmers down. Nice clarity though. Right after I removed the cap I got this instant burst of fruitiness on the nose. Then when I began to pour it, the aroma segued into a toasted bready, creamy, yeasty, and neutral hopped balance. I was sold before I even tasted it. Fortunately the taste was just as endearing with a bold body and a sharp bitterness nut-like quality concluding with a pleasant dry hop finale. This beer really hit all the pressure points in a good way and is highly recommended.","puboflyons","Mar 16, 2010"

Moderate bitterness throughout, really giving some balance to the brown sugar and milk chocolate sweetness up front. More of a caramel and bittersweet chocolate flavour towards the finish with a fair bit of clove spiciness hidden behind the malts. Less roast and fruit in the flavour, but they're there. Smooth texture, carbonation was a little rough to start but mellowed as the beer warmed. Medium to full bodied. Quite enjoyable.","DrJay","Feb 27, 2010"

Taste is an exception blend of roasted grain, roasted nuts, crust bread and dried dark fruit a nice carmely sweet backbone. Does not approach bitter as many in the style do.

Brown sugar adds some sweetness to the aroma which is followed by a lemony citrus twang. The first sip is lightly roasty and woody, almost like a schwarzbier. This is followed by a sweet brown sugar flavor and a dry bitter hop. In the end the malt comes back out reminding you that this is indeed an english brown ale. It has that dry/lemony malt that I find in a lot of english ales. The feel is light to moderate with tingly to soft carbonation, finishes slightly dry and bitter.

Taste is definitely roasted but not overdone, the coffee flavor comes out and an aftertaste of something like sambuca or black licorice with hints of earthiness. Adds to its complexity as it goes down and warms. Can definitely taste the yeast combo used which adds to the flavor. Rather creamy and smooth as befits its ABV.","Katahdin","Feb 02, 2010"

I also love the fact that Pretty Things' beers can change drastically between batches, so that it is almost like you are drinking a new beer with every release. This is batch #3, brewed last month. Pours a very dark brown color. Not close to black, but as dark as brown gets. Big and creamy tanned heading with some staying potential in the appearance. In the nose, one gets some caramel, cocoa powder, freshly baked bread, and many other interesting complexities. Sweet brown bread with powdered sugar comes to mind first in the aroma, followed by Christmas pudding and all sorts of spiced cookies. Overall much sweeter than previous batches. About medium to heavy, and it feels much larger than it is. Alcohol is virtually untraceable, which is a little disappointing for me only because that was one of the qualities I really liked in the older versions. Overall this is a bad ass brown that is on the threshold of the porter style. It has lost some of the rustic qualities from other batches, but this is still really well crafted, and a brew that they should serve at all Boston pubs. Not just for the nod to Boston, but for the overall quality. Cheers","jamie2dope","Sep 12, 2009"

The feel could of been a tad fuller as I found this to be a bit light/watery. The carb was not so high also.

Creamy and luxorious mouthfeel, smooth as can be all the way to the finish. Very tasty and pleasurable brown ale. More quality and quite ""artisanal"" suds from the PT beer and ale project.","Billolick","Sep 03, 2009"

4.53,10.8,4.5,4,4.5,5,5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" light brown head over the slightly cloudy reddish brown brew. Frothy head recedes slowly, with heavy coating lace. Aroma is sweet and lightly chocolatey. Taste is rich grain character from beginning to end, overwritten with nutty chocolate and complementary hops. Mouthfeel is soft, smooth, low carbonation in a good way, with drinkability oh-so easy. Let it warm a touch out of the fridge, and you've pretty much got a cask-like experience.

Pretty Things crafted this brown ale nicely and ensured that the mouthfeel fell somewhere a little bit more robust than most brown ales but not as heavy as say a smoked porter or a stout. There is a really whole beer mouthfeel to this ale in the sense that what you can tell just by the mouthfeel alone is that the entire bottle and all that has gone into making this ale is nothing short of brilliant.","Bounty628","Aug 08, 2009"
4,-2.2,4,4,4,4,4,"this beer pours a dark brown with red highlights that support he tan head beautifully. the aroma is caramely malt all the way. i'm wondering if the color and aroma was from the grain or carmalization in an extended boil. very tasty either way. the sweet tasty malt flavor works well with the roasted malt astringency. the medium body and good co2 make this a really drinkable brown.","almychristopher","Aug 06, 2009"

3.8,-7.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Picked up a bottle from Abe's Cold Beer after enjoying their saison. This beer, unfortunately, is less impressive. I suppose it's a little rustic in the sense that the malts have an earthy, dry bitter taste that's certainly not unpleasant. Still, this beer just seems to linger between and brown ale and a porter for the dry roasted malt that consumes the aftertaste. The aroma has more of a candy dark chocolate character, but the flavor and feel is very dry. I guess that aspect is more Belgian. Still, a pretty tasty beer, I'm just not sure what's going on.","tempest","Jun 12, 2009"

4.08,-0.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Pours a rich medium brown, like a typical nutty brown ale. Huge head billows up with a flourish of bubbles. Great retention, and leaves some intricate lacing. Has kind of a belgian yeasty smell to it, and the sweet aroma of slightly darkened malts along with molasses. Bit of toffee as well. Taste... this is a flavorful yet mellow sessionable brown. A bit of toasted toffee, some nuttiness, a bit of coffee. Some more flavours as it opens up a bit, I noticed something fruity in there as well. Maybe some burnt caramel. Nice gravitas, filling and bready, goes quite well with dinner tonight (sirloin tips). On the heavier side of medium body while lacking the density of a porter or stout. Nice and drinkable, but had a bit of funkiness at first. I hope Pretty Things becomes a New England staple, Dann deserves it.","damienblack","May 24, 2009"

3.88,-5.1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"22oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Bottled April 2009 Batch Two indicated on a paper swatch covering the cap. Poured a murky chestnust color with very little light penetration. One inch, tight, frothy off-white head with good retention, eventually settles into a thin, consistent cap. Some thick stands of lacing coat the glass during the session. Nose is malty and suggests dark fruit, perhaps prunes, and maybe a little cocoa. Taste consistent with nose, but some roasted coffee flavors also come out and a kiss of hops is revealed at the finish. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a nice, consistent level of background carbonation. Nice English Brown with a decent amount of complexity, particularly in terms of the abv. Too bad it's not available in sixers; it would make a great session brown.","Jwale73","May 04, 2009"

An aroma full of wet grasses, dry grains, sour fermenting and lemon peel. The aroma had a bit more of a nutty malt to it and a nice mildly sour rustic farm ale taste, hearty and full of denseness. I really should've brought out the stein for this one...now, to find it on draught!","selecter70","May 04, 2009"

3.18,-22.2,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Dense, yet a fluffy tan head rests on the surface for a good long time. Rather hoppy aroma with some citrus and flowers, with malt in the background. The taste was overall rather unbalanced-- rather, perhaps it was *too* balanced. There was no differentiating between the malt and the hops for me, so there was no real flavor one way or the other. It was just beer. I expected something malty and instead got something... not so malty, but not so hoppy, either. Worth a try, especially if you live in MA and want to support your local brewery. I preferred the PT saison over this one.","gfreed","Apr 07, 2009"

Smelled like a whiff of cocoa powder. Taste was quite pleasant, but mild. There was quite a lot of malt, with a nice flavor of chocolate biscuits. Flavors did not stand out immensely, but I can see how that would help to make this a very drinkable beer. Did not really notice the abv. After hearing what Mr. Paquette had to say this evening, I can really see his British brewing style influenced here, as well as his idea to brew an old-school style, historical Boston-inspired brew.","morebeergood","Feb 11, 2009"
