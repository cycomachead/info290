3,-16.4,3,3,3,3,3,"Pours a deep amber hue, flirting with brown, but when backlit is ruby red. The aroma is strictly caramel with a touch of sweetness. The flavor is also packed with caramel with a dash of buttery toast. It light in body and pretty bland overall. More representative of an English brown having little bitterness, light on hops, and just not enough depth for me.","CuriousMonk","Feb 07, 2011"

4.9,36.5,5,5,5,4,5,"Nice balance of caramel and coffee notes. Hoppy but not overdone, finished with a pleasing coffee taste. To bad it was only a tasting, I could have had a few of these, mostly due to the fact that it drank nicely and is only 4.5%. I could see this as an anytime of the year beer, but I think I would prefer this in the Fall to Winter. Even at 4.5% it made me feel very comfortable.","bayinghound","Oct 17, 2010"

For something which is named after a type of fire which is supposed to catch you by surprise (backdraft), I was expecting a bit more from the intensity of the flavors. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent, so that more than compensates for this shortcoming.

3.59,0,4,2.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured a dark/clear with a decent head, aroma I thought smelled like a cleaning solution? and first sip was a little metalic, or soapy, kinda hard to describe, it was a clean glass too. But, once it warmed up a touch, it was a whole new beer. Dark roasted malt, with what seems to be a spicy dark belgian. turned out to be a nice Brown....but wait for a warmer brew, maybe upper 40's.","beergod1","Mar 27, 2010"
3.46,-3.6,4,3,3.5,3,4,"I wouldn't go too far out of my far this one. It's not bad at all, just nothing tremendously noteworthy. I have to give the company a nod for their charity concept.

2.85,-20.6,3,3,3,2.5,2.5,"Overall, I thought this beer was average for an English Brown Ale. The unbalanced flavor and overcarbonation make it a tough one to drink.","BehindtheFinBrew","Feb 25, 2010"
3.14,-12.5,4,2.5,3.5,3,3,"Nice looking clear auburn body. Thin beige head. Spotty lace. Pretty weak aroma. Light brown malts and light roasted notes. Toffee based malt flavor gives the beer a nice base. A little roastiness and some light ""candied"" flavors give this beer a little depth. Unique and decent enough. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated.","Bighuge","Feb 18, 2010"
3.6,0.3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,"A brown ale is right up my alley but not as dark as I prefer. Poured an iced tea color with a fair head. Smell of faint caramel, nuttiness, and a slight hop pine. Taste is smooth but kind of one dimensional with a nutty sweetness on the tongue and a touch of hops in the back. Certainly a step up from their golden ale.","Portertime","Feb 10, 2010"
3.62,0.8,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D= well, I'm not blissfully impressed but this will be some decent stuff for the next few days in the absence of any porter's or stout's at our local beer store lately.","therica","Feb 05, 2010"

2.41,-32.9,4,3,2,2.5,2,"Pours a dark ruddy mahogany brown hue with a light beige head that forms thick and dwindles slowly. Chunks of scattered lacing are left clinging to the sides of my glass. Aroma a roasted caramel accent about it with light herbal hops, with a nutty finish to it all. Flavors are a muddled watery mess of roasted malt and weird chocolate caramel coated fruit, no real hops the finish tastes like muddy cocoa. Mouthfeel is watery and pretty thin for a brown, but finishes with the cloying residual sugar muddled mess I tried to describe in the flavor. I'm guessing this is a contract brew by High Falls but I'm not sure. Drinkability overall is pretty weak not something I will ever look for again.","WVbeergeek","Jul 20, 2009"

Smells of yeast cleanliness, slight sweet malt, hint of hops, and a hint of roasted malt. Fits the style of an English Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level.

Poured into my Sly Fox shaker glass, the ale appears a clear medium chestnut color with about two fingers of dense, lingering light ecru foam. Aromas and flavors are of medium roasted grains, lightly nutty (hazelnuts), milk and bittersweet chocolate, nicely roasted and subtly smokey coffee beans, a good dose of caramel malt. Backdraft is approaching full bodied for the style with adequate carbonation. A tasty example of an English Brown. Newcastle should be ashamed.","ClockworkOrange","Jun 08, 2009"

It's everything a brown ale should be really. I can taste the hops ever so slightly and its roasted malty flavor is mild as well.

4.12,14.8,4,4.5,4,4,4,"12oz brown bottle from Hannaford in Gardiner. Pours dark copper-brown, nearly opaque, with a quarter inch of light tan head. Smells malty, roasty, and somewhat nutty with strong coffee and chocolate notes. Tastes roasty, with dark chocolate and coffee playing big parts with some caramel and hints of nut. On the fuller side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Rather drinkable - one sip most definitely invites another. An excellent brown ale, and one of the best I've had.","MrHurmateeowish","Jan 01, 2008"
3.53,-1.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall, a decent brown ale that works quite well being enjoyed in the winter months, but is a bit more full than it should be.","deltatauhobbit","Dec 15, 2007"
3.75,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"I was a sucker for this beer because of the firefighting theme. It pours a deep red/brown with a frothy tan head. The aroma is hoppy with bits of chocolate, caramel and other dark malts. The flavor is crisp and fairly dry with some of the same malty flavors as in the aroma. The maltiness is overpowered a bit by the hop bitterness and flavor. Overally it's a pretty decent beer, and the charitable donation isn't bad either.","ericj551","Dec 09, 2007"
3.63,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Taste starts off malty and smooth upfront with a lingering mild hop bitterness and roasty taste. A second sip detects the Cascades better upfront with only a slight hint of roastiness. Quite drinkable for a brown ale. Not quite my choice though but I could drink this in a session.","Brad007","Dec 06, 2007"

4.79,33.4,4,5,5,3.5,5,"I've been disappointed with ""browns"" in the past, notably New Castle. Overbearing, over-carbonated and overpriced. Backdraft Brown shatters all and will leave you begging for more. Has a welcomed nose of coffee and chocolate but is far more palatable than porters with the same aromas. Finish is a light coating on your palate that lingers a bit like Guinness but surprisingly does not compete with any food. Had it with garlic mussels and a burger and fries. The single-handedly best all-purpose compliment to food from a brown.","elvishfarmer","Nov 10, 2007"
3.67,2.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"On tap-Dark brown pour w/a little lacing. Faint Roasted malt aroma. Kind of a standard brown, roasted malt & nuts, had some carbonation & a little bit of a smoked flavor to it, but really nothing special. Not nearly as good as their wheat-surprised it is rated higher that the wheat (which is really a golden ale). Kind of thin mouthfeel.","Rootdog316","Aug 25, 2007"

3.06,-14.8,4,3,3,3,3,"Dark Brown color, small head. A medium bodied brown ale. Very malty and slightly sweet. Slight hop bitterness. Nicely balanced. Good flavor, nutty. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is nutty and slightly bitter, Nice Nut brown ale.","beerguy101","Aug 22, 2003"
3.02,-15.9,2.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Flavor is malty, with some toffee to it. Roastiness is a little underdone, so this beer comes off a bit too much like a pale ale. The balance is nice, with only light hopping and mild estery flavors, but boring and a little too plain. Body is medium, with rather high carbonation. Not terrible, but not up to par with the others in the tasting.","UnionMade","Aug 03, 2003"
4.05,12.8,4,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,"12 oz bottle. No freshness dating found. Firetruck and Dalmation on the label, gotta like that. Shiny medium clear brown color. Bubbly beige head. Smell was pleasant toasted carmel, nutty and inviting. Taste followed up smooth and strong. Very rich toasted carmel malt, just a hint of chocolate and sweet hazlenut. No off flavors for me. Creamy and rich for the first half of the glass. It just got a touch watery on the finish, but maybe I didn't drink it fast enough, for that reason I gave it 3.5 drinkability. I would reach for this one again. A local company is starting to put these in Florida beer stores. Fine idea by me. It's worth a try. Very simialer to Smuttynose's Old Brown Dog Ale, and that's saying something.","StevieW","Feb 08, 2003"
3.13,-12.8,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"The pour a deep clear brown with a decent sized head, frothy in texture and a light tan in color, the lace forms a decent sheet upon the glass. Nose is malt dominated, crisp, fresh and sweet with the start also sweet and nicely malted, top is a bit thin for my taste. Finish is strongly acidic, hops are plentiful and spicy, dry lingering aftertaste, a drinkable beer, but just a bit more body need to please me.","Gusler","Oct 26, 2002"

3.67,2.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a ruby brown color with a decent off-white colored head. On the nose the aromas were of toffee and caramel, and slightly nutty. On the palate you get more toffee and caramel, slight sweet coffee flavor, hint of chocolate, hop bitterness. Overall a very good brown ale.","WilliamPhilaPa","Jan 21, 2002"
