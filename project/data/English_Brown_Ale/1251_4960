3.98,11.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"My pour got me a finger of fizzy, light-brown head with moderate retention. Color was a deep brown with ruby/garnet highlights. Nose was quite malty, reminiscent of something that eluded me, but perhaps it will come. Did I sense a slight buttery quality? I usually have a blind spot when it comes to diacetyl, so I may be mistaken. Plus, I really do not mind such a flavor. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was much more chocolaty than I had experienced on the nose. It had a powdery taste, like Hershey's Cocoa Powder right out of the tin and into the mouth. Do they even make that any more? I knew precisely where it was stored in my maternal grandmother's house and used to love it straight as a child. I sprinkled it on peanut butter to make a phenomenal sandwich. That's what the nose reminded me of - Ovaltine! Great Gar, but this beer really takes me back. I saw where Newcastle Brown is the standard bearer for the style, but this is drier than that. The finish was semi-sweet with the yeast having converted most of the fermentable sugar to alcohol. I was very impressed by this little piggy.","woodychandler","Oct 20, 2012"

Nice light smell of roasted malt. Taste matches the smell, richer than I expected, buttery and with some bitter hops coming through. Finish us a little sweet.","MoreThanWine","Sep 22, 2012"
3.53,-1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a dark clear reddish brown color with a huge bubbly tan head that slowly recedes before leaving some spotty lace on the way down. Smells of caramel and brown sugar with a hint of tart fruit, earth, roast and butter. The flavor is heavy on the caramel and butterscotch with an earthy hop bite that provides some balance. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a creamy bubbly mouthfeel. So far this is the only brew I've had where I feel the diacytyl actually adds something to the beer. This is probably my favorite beer from Woodstock, but its still just an average beer.","johnnnniee","Beers"

The aroma is subtle but it has a nutty malted quality as well as sweet. The body is smooth. The taste is higher on the bitterness than in the aroma with a sharp lingering hop note. This is one of those beers that I drink a lot and I am surprised that it took so long for me to review it.","puboflyons","0"

Bready nose, brash chocolaty flavor notes mixed in with a faint jammy note. Eh, not the greatest brown ale out there. On the unrefined side and a wee bit thin mouth feel wise.

The smell was a great mixture: there was nutty flavors up front, plus some dark-but-not-too-dark malts, a pinch of floral hops, a mild presence of alcohol, and ended with a touch of caramel sweetness. The taste was quite nice as well. The dominant flavors were the roasted nuts and the dark, coffee-flavor malts. However, it was rounded out by a mild hop presence in the background, and ends with some sweet caramel flavors (and maybe even some vanilla in there too). The last taste the beer leaves it actually a fantastic mix: it's malty, bitter, and sweet all at once. The thin, carbonated mouthfeel makes this beer go down nice and easy, and I could certainly drink a few more.

3.38,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Poured a nice, rich, translucent brown color - not much head, though. Aroma has a nice, sweet, crystal scent. There seemed to be a little too much carbonation in this one, which dominated the sip. Tastes smooth - a nice malty aftertaste lingers. Not a bad brown, but seemed pretty unremarkable.","rmessick","0"
3.5,-2.2,3,3,3.5,4,4,"Picked up a six while on biz in Rhode Island this week. My first bottle version of a Woodstock Inn beer. Dark brown/ruby color with about a 1"" head which dissipates to a film. Some sheet lacing which does stick well to the glass. A hint of choco in the nose. Flavor is pretty traditional English Brown. Some toffee and maly with a bit of a metallic finish. I liked the taste. The mouthfeel is quite good as it is full and rounded, pretty good balance. While the ABV is not published, this one is a good session beer. Good stuff. I'll have to score some other bottles of Woodstock Inn stuff, next time I'm is Rhode Island.","sraimondi","Jul 07, 2007"
3.68,2.8,4,3.5,4,3,3.5,"Coffee brown brew with a big off-white head and good lacing. The aroma is of brown sugar, yeast and malt. Quite aqueous and a strong malty flavor with mild carbonation. There is a little charcoal in the back of the mouth, fairly sweet at the front. I would like to have better carbonation to cut into the watery quality. There is a very slight metallic hint but not really bothersome. Seems to grow on me with each swig, should be easy drinking these but I might tire of the sweetness eventually. Not too bad though. Definitely worth having another and worth you trying it.","Durge","Jun 08, 2007"
2.65,-26,3,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Pours a mild brown color with a thin head. Aroma is kind of malty and chewy. Taste is similar except that it's slightly thin on the tongue. It has a dry mouthfeel and the malt shines through somewhat. Not impressive enough for me but it's still solid.","Brad007","Apr 14, 2007"

2.2,-38.5,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,2,"Appears a ruby brown mahogany tone with a large light cream head leaves specks of uneven lacing not too impressive but the head has decent retention overall looks like a nice brown. Aromatics a bit like cider with tart fruit notes coming through the moderately roasted malt additions that also bring mild chocolate and a woody tree bark barrage mild herbal hop additions noted mild and tame for sure. Flavors really clash the acidity of the tart character overrides the roasted malt and mild sweetness it should offer IÂ’m never big on this style but I think this oneÂ’s poorly made. Pretty astringent yet it seems it hasnÂ’t turned itÂ’s just how the flavors came together after production, which is weird. Mouthfeel is medium bodied really coats the palate and it sticks around sadly I might have to go brush my teeth but the carbonation was moderate and flowed well just the lactic character that sticks to your palate ruins it. Drinkability not so much as Borat would say IÂ’m going to stick other beers from this style when reaching for a brown ale pass on PigÂ’s Ear from New Hampshire.","WVbeergeek","Feb 16, 2007"

3.45,-3.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Comments: I liked this Brown Ale, but it was slightly thin in the body for the style. I prefer a bit more fullness to the body for English Brown Ales, such as Sam Smith's. That being said, the flavor was good & it was easy drinking.","JMD71","Jan 08, 2007"

3.83,7,3.5,3,4,4,4.5,"Pretty good brew. Pours a dark brown color with a minimal head that totally disappears within a minute. There isn't an strong smell to this beer but It has a smooth toasted malt aroma. Nice taste; heavy malt flavor, a little sweet, with a dry finish. This style isn't a particular favorite of mine but I could definitely see myself having another.","pgenius","Jun 16, 2006"
3.65,2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: Pretty drinkable brown ale, although a bit too sweet for my taste buds. I would like to try this on tap though to see if the flavors mellow out a bit or become more alarming. Worth a try if you can pick it up.","bjohnson","May 20, 2006"
3.98,11.2,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Shaker 12oz glass presentation. 1/2"" beige head over an orangey brown brew, which faded down to an uneven layer of bubbles, and had ample sticky lacing. Aroma is lightly malty. Taste is well-balanced, medium grains, with moderate hopping. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth over the tongue, and drinkability is very nice. Not my favorite style, but I'm liking this one.","ppoitras","Apr 13, 2006"

3.18,-11.2,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Of all the beers I sampled at the Woodstock Inn Brewery, this one was the best. The problem was, none of their beers really impressed me. It had the fine medium red color going for it. But from the first sip, I noticed it was lacking any noticeable hop taste and aroma. It seemed somewhat watered-down for my taste. The malts were sweet and flavorful, which kept me interested. I declined the bartender's offer to pour me a pint. After sampling everything they had, I was ready for a better tasting cold beer sitting back in the room.","ChappyCubsFan","Mar 13, 2005"

It's good in it's own right, but I'm not sure how closely it adheres to the brown ale style. Lots of fruitiness, with just a touch of roasted and/or caramunich malt. Body is slightly fuller than average, with a really nice small bubbled mouthfeel. I liked this beer quite a bit, but not as a brown ale.","UnionMade","Jul 04, 2003"

Also, the bottle said it was brewed by Smuttynose in Portsmouth. That is o.k. with me since they make some fine brews on their own.","WanderingFool","Jan 15, 2003"
4.35,21.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Appearance a nice, mellow dark, brown-gold. Smell is well-rounded like smoky coffee. Based upon smell, I was expecting a stout-like mouthfeel, which was there, but with a lighter, easier to drink character. Mouthfeel was smooth with a very slight malty, smoky aftertaste. Had one with Italian food and it was an excellent complementt. Very drinkable. Got this six pack at market in town where it is brewed....next time will try on tap at the pub.","edchicma","Beers"
