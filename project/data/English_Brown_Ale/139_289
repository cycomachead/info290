3.65,2.2,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Shipyard Brewer's Brown Ale is a very clear, solid brown ale with a thin khaki head that quickly fades to a thin film and leaves decent lacing on the glass. It has a sweet aroma, like caramel mostly. There may be a hint of nuttiness and a hint of coffee, but it's mostly caramel. It's medium-light bodied and lively. The finish is dry and pretty crisp. It leaves the mouth with a slightly astringent feel. It doesn't taste sweet like it smells. It's pretty malty with a touch of coffee and perhaps nuttiness. There's a fair amount of leafy green bitterness. Chocolate and alcohol are in the aftertaste. This is a solid American brown ale. I just noticed the blue star on the orange background on the label. Is that supposed to make me think of Newcastle? Because, I prefer this to Newcastle, I think.","yesyouam","Jun 15, 2011"

Seriously this had to have looked better then damn near anything else I have run across recently, no joke. Just perfect. Aroma is dark fruits, lots of sweet brown sugary notes, hints of clove and light earthy hops, all mixing together nearly perfectly at this point in time. Nice smooth, even carbonation and feel here now as well, really well placed I have to admit. Rich warm flavor here, nice mix of pear, light spice, hints at brown sugar and a nice even caramel flavored dry finish. Hints of plums pick up as I finish the glass now as well, again well placed and nicely balanced. Superb drinkable factor here as this went wonderfully with dinner and everything after.","mikesgroove","May 22, 2011"
4.22,18.2,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"Shipyard brewery is a good well-rounded brewery with a wide range of good brews. I picked up this one as the new seasonal. Poured a tantalizing mahogany brown with a cola like head. The smell was sweet and seductive with a hint of roasted nuts and dark chocolate, candied fruits. The taste was rich and creamy with hints of fresh brewed coffee, nutty peanut butter, and dusty chocolate. Last time I checked, this was a brown ale not a porter! But, it was a pleasant surprise and a questionable summer seasonal, yet a good beer overall.","Portertime","May 17, 2011"

3.33,-6.7,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep amber almost brown color with good clarity on the edges. A 2 finger off white to tan head fades but leaves a small head that lingers. Smells of fresh nuts, roasted malts, some toffee candy, and bready yeast. No sweetness on the taste. Some nuts and malts come through but really not much going on with the taste. This is missing the sweet brown sugar that is in some brown ales. Mouthfeel is slightly thin. Overall this is mediocre. Quite sessionable with the taste being decent and middle of the road ABV.","abrand","Mar 23, 2011"

2.6,-27.2,3,3,2.5,3,2,"Nose is a but nutty and of roasted grain and a bit of cocoa. While the taste follows suit it becomes a bit too arid and dry. Roasted notes are dry and smoky in an ashen sense like the morning after coals of a bonfire. Average feel and body but the charred smoke notes return on the finish and keep the drinkability in check. A bit of a burden to drink and could use a bit more residuals to carry through the palate better.","HalfFull","May 18, 2010"

3.53,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Picked up a six pack on sale for $7.99. Poured into standard pint glasses. Dark brown color. Fairly good sized white head. Lacing only at the top of the glass, nowhere farther down. Smell was malty and leather-like. Taste was better than expected. Nice dose of malt, with a brown sugar aftertaste. Borderline watery, but just enough body to keep it above average. Low in abv and smooth to drink, both help make it very drinkable. It may get a tad boring after a while, but I polished off three fairly easily. A nice offering from Shipyard and brewed to be a nice session beer.","morebeergood","Mar 05, 2010"

4.1,14.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"I really enjoyed this beer. I have a hard time with brown ales becasue they tend to be a little too sweet for my liking. But I think Shipyards is actually quite tasty. The beer poured like it should; a real nice brown color that wasn't too dark. The head was thin and dissipated quickly. The taste was something I wasn't expecting. Definite hints of brown sugar, mollasses, caramel, maybe a little orange and coffee to. But it wasn't terribly sweet. It was extremely well balanced by the bitterness of the hops they added. There wasn't one flavor that was too overpowering and the drinkability of the beer was great. Definitely a beer I'll have again.","McKibben25","Mar 01, 2010"
3.78,5.9,4,3.5,4,3,4,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. 2010 issue. Expiration date - Sept. 2010. Sampled on February 14, 2010. The pour is a decent looking ruby-brown tone with a short-lived off-white head. The aroma is typical of brown ales with a significant malty sensation followed by butterscotch or something otherwise as sickly sweet. The mouthfeel is fairly thin and unexciting. The taste resounds with sweet, caramel malts and a background of fresh hops. Overall not bad.","puboflyons","Feb 14, 2010"
3.87,8.4,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Poured much darker than I expected, looks almost black until I held it up to the light. It's an extremely dark brown with lighter brown highlights. the beer has a tan colored head with very little lacing on it, just a small ring around the surface. The smell is pretty good too, very heavy on the malts. Notes of caramel and brown sugar, the hops fill in after. It's a very tasty brown ale, but the hops are not as prevalent in the flavor as the smell. Still heavy malted with same caramel and brown sugar notes, a molasses taste to it as well. The mouthfeel grew on me as I drank it. It's very heavy and full, almost chewy, stout-esque. No carbonation bite or alcohol, there is only a slight bitter finish from the hops. Reasonably drinkable beer, more of a sipper for a nice cool day.","AndyAvalanche","Feb 13, 2010"

3.28,-8.1,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Overall, this is a decent brown ale, but nothing great. Shipyard's beers tend to have a strong yeast note that does not settle right with me and this is little exception. The fact is I find the flavor profile to jsut be unappealing.","Gosox8787","Feb 07, 2010"

Pours to a well, brown, albeit light brown with a huge multi-faceted head. Taste is rather light, as I would detect looking at the AC but, it is not light on flavor or body. The taste is a very steady balanced slightly toasted ale with hints of brown sugar and molasses. Although the taste is steady throughout, the mouthfeel gets a little thin on the finish. The bitterness is really not evident, only a little more prominent at the end where it is still remains subdued and flat. This is an extremely drinkable beer. If you didn't tell me it was an English Brown, I would peg it for an Altbier.","mooseisloose","Nov 06, 2009"

The beer is quite sweet and has a surprising almondy nut like flavor lurking underneath. The beer isn't complex and there are the slightly diacetyl toffee flavors, there is a slightly prickly mouthfeel very characteristic of the English style. There is some roasted notes, some bready malt flavors, a tinge of hop on the back end. Overall, this is an enjoyable, easy to drink, none too complex Brown ale, that is simple yet very good.

The aroma was of faint caramel malt and biscuity malt. The flavors were very washed out. Caramel malt, weak hops and a hint of nuts of the finish. Super boring, like a 'light' brown beer.

This pours a dark brown-amber color and topped with a nice amount of foamy head. Malty aroma with a malty, slightly sweet, toasty flavor. Notes of chocolate as well.

The aroma is filled with very rich toasted and medium rosted mlats. Mixed with some English and American smelling hops.

The flavor is moderately sweet with just a faint hop bitterness. Not much hop flavor to go along with the bitterness. Medium to light in body, with some smoothness.

The taste is a more astringent brown ale than i am used to, but it balances with some citrus and nuttiness, a weird combo i know, that gives this beer a certaun strange quality. The beer is medium bodied and as i said is astringent on the palate which hinders the little flavors and makes the stronger ones more pronounced in my eyes.

Taste is not what I expect from a solid brown ale. Tastes a little fruity and I guess a little malty, but not roasty or toasty like I was hoping. Hops don't really play a big role in this beer. As for mouthfeel, this beer is too light bodied to be a brown ale, even an English brown ale. Very watery. Smooth yes, but not very substantial. As a side note, I bought a Shipyard mixed 12 pack and the brown ale, IPA, and Export Ale all tasted very similar, and equally uninteresting.","twelvsies","Nov 07, 2004"

Head was limited but there was a bit of lace that draped itself out as the beer level in the glass was depleated. The smell was of wheats and malts and I found a distinct woodsy nutty flavor to it. There was also a distinct buttery sharp smell, and a small hop bitterness lingered in the back. A very interesting smell overall. The taste was a dry burnt woody taste, with some small citruisy flavors, and a bit of bitterness which tastes more like a tart chalky apple than hops, but very subdued. I like the flavor although I find it hard to pinpoint. Mouthfeel is dry and smoky (without the actual ""smoked"" flavor) and pleasantly carbonated. When I see the alcohol content I can see that this beer lets you know its slightly less alcoholic that a ""regular"" beer, but its certainly not dramatically evident.
