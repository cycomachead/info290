"Flavor: medium roasted malts are the dominant flavor with chocolate, coffee, and toffee notes being evident. There is a mild, but noticeable, hop bitterness in the finish."

"O) An ok brew. With a name like ""mudslinger"" one would think the girth would be more and the flavor profile would be more pronounced."

"Once again RedHook puts out a brew that is drinkable but not special."

"Pours a hazy dark copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and slight nutty aromas. Taste is much the same with toast and nutty flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with some decent aromas and flavors for the style but nothing really stands out about this one."

"This beer had its moments, but it was missing something. A bit more flavor I would have rated it higher than a 3.5 (which may have a bit generous)."
""
"Poured from a bottle into a Pint glass displayed a clear medium brown brew with a half finger head, the aroma picked up was roasted sweetness and a little malt background. Taste was simple with nothing stepping forward, roasted malts, sugar and a little hint of bitterness. Mouthfeel was medium and nice and overall this is a nice Brown Ale, I've had worse and I've had much better....was looking to try this for a while but it's not something I'd seek out but then again I wouldn't turn it down."

"A slightly more aggressive Brown Ale than the usual suspects. That touch of burnt barley helps it stand out. There is something too sweet and fruity with that woodsy bitterness to be very drinkable. In the 22 oz bottle. From Del Mission Liquor on Washington near Hillcrest in San Diego, which has a suprisingly good and fresh supply of craft beers."

"An enjoyable brown ale."

"Dammit, why can't we have clean, respectful political dialogue? Anyway, this stuff pours a clear sunrise sienna topped by a finger of glowing dirty white foam. The nose comprises lightly-funky wheat stuck in an old, semi-dried pool of maple syrup. The taste holds notes of old maple syrup, dry toffee, light brown sugar, light cocoa powder, and a twinge of sweet biscuit. There's a vague sense of candied orange peel throughout, but it never settles long enough for me to get a good enough idea of its existence. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick, fluid feel. Overall, a weak bit of ""English-style"" sweetness that doesn't meld well within itself, much less on my tongue."
""
"Overall - Not a bad brown from Red Hook here, in fact it's pretty darn solid. Something I'd give thought to buying again, especially if I were in the mood for a brown, which is rare."
"Overall: pretty enjoyable, and a fine option if you kinda want a brown ale... but aren't sure that you want a really brown ale."
""
"Overall – Well it’s not offensive and it is OK, but its lack of smooth transitions and its rather weak mouthfeel would likely prevent me from recommending this one to others. Just OK."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Not nearly as rich as its name may imply, and is in fact a highly accessible, drinkable beer which may be best enjoyed in warmer weather."
""
""
""
""
"O- This one's kind of a stinker. Not tasty, not fitting the style. Just odd."
"Eh, decent brown, but not really anything overly exciting."
""
"Feel is overall smooth."
""
""
""
"Overall super easy to drink even if it is a little too lightly flavored for my taste. Still I would buy again sometime when I just want a mild brown ale at a good price."
""
"O: not well aquainted with the nut brown ale style but if this is average to good then I like 'em."
""

""

""

"O: A decent enough Brown, serviceable and sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
"I certainly prefer this beer over Newcastle, but with the grainy-sweet taste and texture, the dryness and alcohol that I would have normally applauded seems to highlight the waivering malt body."

"O: A very drinkable beer. Reminds me of a crisp spring morning."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 40 degrees. The beer poured a great big tan head. The beer had a red color to it also. The beer had a slightly sweet taste and unfortunately a little bit of a metallic taste also or after taste I should say. I will not buy again."
"dark brown, almost black with a 1 inch caramel head, quickly fades, with some residual lace. Smell right off is chocolate, spice, and caramel. Taste is almost coffee like, very nice actually, with a good hoppy after taste. This was very smoothe, somewhat thick but not overally so at all"
"O - a slightly hoppy and lively version of an English brown ale."
"Easy to drink and a nice spring or even summer brew for those who like brews with a bit more body and taste than a typical light summer ale."
"mud slinger spring ale is a good way to ween yourself off of those dark smokey winter brews. It's not too dark but it's in no way a fluffly prance through a spring medow. It's coming up the middle on the edge of a knife. The color is a smashing deep brown copperish color. The smell is a mildly smokey chocolate barley. The taste is a rich smokey chocolate. I thinl mud slinger is more spacifically an end of winter beginning of spring ale, unless you are just hardcore and wanna drink the rich stuff year round. This is a solid beer and an out of the box way to embrace spring ales."
"O: A better than average beer overall. They were shooting for a spring brown ale, and they did a good job. They still used those caramel flavors that you expect from an english brown, but managed to create a drinkable beer."
"I popped the cap, gave it a pour and had the briefest finger of light-tan head in a while. Color was a garnet-red with NE quality clarity. Nose was very sweet, perhaps a bit too much so for this hophead, caramel-like in its intensity. Mouthfeel was medium and it had a caramel sweetness in the mouth, but not overwhelming as the nose had led me to expect. Finish was sweet, but again, not overwhelmingly so. I would not want a steady diet of this, but as an occasional change-up, sure."
"O: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent beer but there are a lot of other beers in the style that I would pick first."
"Overall: A easy session beer. No flaws noted, a nice clean simple beer."
"O- Very clean taste with not much aftertaste, it's a simple beer, seems to be well crafted and I'd grab this for the spring/summer months."
"Redhook Mudslinger is a very clear, copper brown ale with a small, white head that quickly fades to a ring. It has a caramel aroma with a note of coffee and possibly cola. It's light bodied with a pretty clean, delicate finish. It's lightly flavored with caramel and some nuttiness. It has a slightly metallic property. An herbal, medicinal bitterness comes in for the finish. Sweet caramel flavor lingers. This isn't really my style, but there's nothing wrong with it."
"O - Interesting enough to hold interest but after a while I was wishing for additional carbonation and perhaps a bit more complexity."
"Pours light brown with minimal head. Disappointing. Nose is light with some toasty aromas, hint of brown sugar. Cola-like on the palate with light caramel flavors, decent carbonation, and a dusty finish. Light bodied and watery. Not worth trying at all."
"M,O- A great beer for the price, and pretty good overall. I would definitely go to this one again."
"O-A nice brown ale. I would like a little less hop astringency and maybe less carbonation and a heavier mouthfeel but this is a good value for the price."
"Lighter bodied than expected, but moderately drinkable. Overall, not bad, just not great. Don't really hate this, but there are many better."
"Overall: I will be doing no mud slinging here. I liked it. Sure, you don't get a vastly complex malt character or a sizzling hop profile, and there's no room or real need for any wild barrel-aging. I'm totally fine with that. It's just a simple, decent, balanced brown."
"D: An interesting, if mild, brown – yet drinkable enough. Toasty, but not overly nutty. Malts are quite dry & are balanced against a fruity/estery sweet aspect. Hops play a supporting, but noticeable role. A solid offering."
"O: drinkable, malty brown ale. slightly underwhelming. would be very tasty with a grilled cheese sandwich."
"Overall it's an easy-drinking, refreshing ale with enough flavor and character to keep it interesting."
"Redhook Ale Brewery 2011 Mudslinger Brown Ale. 4 oz. Taster at Fremont, Seattle Hop Scotch Beer & Scotch Festival on 4/2/2011. 5.80% ABV. 30 IBU's. Mild lace off white head. Clear bright rich ruby red brown color. Light chocolate mild hop front. Slightly sweet brown sugar toasted toffee cocoa crisp body. Clean dry tangy end. Zesty Brown Ale. Mildly fruity, but nice. (3.5 / 5.0)"
"O: Malty character well-balanced without big hopping; a plus for this style. Very drinkable; flavorable and tolerable ABV."
"A medium amber-brown color with thin, off-white head that dissipates pretty quickly. The aroma is grainy, slightly nutty with a hint of caramel. The flavor is about the same; light, grainy malts with a bit of caramel. A slight hop bitterness. Quite thin on the flavor though. The mouthfeel is good, crisp and slightly thin but substantial enough."
"O- Honestly I was expecting a little more from this beer from other reviews, I wasnt too impressed by it. This is my first redhook ale beer, and im a little skeptical about buying a different brew from them."
"D: At first I didn't see this as a spring ale but when put with grilling, BBQ, and outdoors, it makes sense. A good campfire beer, for sure."
"Final Notes: A solid Brown Ale. Malt-forward, light hops, and smooth. You could easily have a few of these, and it would pair well with a variety of foods."
"Mudlsinger is not a bad beer at all. Considering I had it at a bar that has limited options in the good beer department, I certainly didn't complain. Overall, however, it doesn't stack up against the best brown ales."
"Slight crackle in the head, tall and bubbly. Reddish glow in the clear brown color. Hint of malt in the aroma, with a side of leafy, woody hop and mild fruitiness. Wet body--we considered saying thin, though the semidry malt character took its time coming around and dropped a pleasant toasted graininess on our taste buds. Hint of caramel goes well with the vague fruiti- ness and faint kiss of alcohol. A content party of flavors on the palate, it's hard to put this up against other Nut Brown Ales though. A worthy effort."
"During a visit to Portsmouth we took the opportunity to visit Redhook Brewery. Tried the Mudslinger Spring Ale. The color was darl amber / brown with a white head and some lace. The nose was a missing, nothing to report. The taste was good, a nice touch of maltyness helps this beer. The mouthfeel was good and I certainly could do a Session with this beer."
"Pours out a brown/copper with a small amount of barely off white head. Smells of light caramel malts with some darker traits. Subtle earthy fruits. No real hop aroma. Light body and a couple bottles went down smooth while grabbing a burger. Not too bad but not that great either."
"It's enjoyable, if not world class, but a nice beer nonetheless."
"I think decent is the word here."
"D: Good sessionable beer, liked it's feel and tastes and it was pretty good overall."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a clear, amber/brown color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight hops, hint of spice, slight nut, and hint of earthy malt. Fits the style of an English Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight roasted malt, slight pale malt, hint of nut, hint of earthy malt, hint of hop, and a hint of spice. Overall, good aroma, feel, body, and blend."
"I really don't have much to say about this beer. It's a little off balance."
"Took me a minute to find this beer on B.A. Red Hook brews a nice light brown ale with their Mud Slinger. Brown and small head with light carbonation. Smells grainy with hints of alcohol. Taste of light a nutty, caramel, and chocolate malt. Nice Spring feel to the taste ....time to let winter go. Not too bad, not too great. SO-SO."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is of hops and nuts. Taste is good, hops, nutty, a touch of malts, well balanced. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"D - This is a nice English-style ale. It easy pretty tasty and easy drinking."
"D: I don't prefer Brown Ales but even so, I expected more nut flavor in the body of the beer and fewer hops. Fine once, will not buy again"
"Mudslinger pours medium brown and pretty clear, with about one finger of head. The smell was sweet and malty. The taste was mild but nutty. I was surprised in its bitterness; for me, it made it more drinkable. I don't prefer overly sweet brown ales. It had a medium body, and I could have another."
"D- Easy drinking enough I suppose, but the soapy finish and lack of body really don't interest me in having another."
"D- Overall, this is a decent but not great brown ale that I probably wouldn't purchase again."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable ale. Some complexity but not a lot. Good-tasting and easy to drink."
"More hoppy on the tongue than I expected. Also, it seems to be highly carbonated which is in stark contrast to the appearance. The beer seems thinner because of this. The overall flavor is relatively weak, which makes it easy to drink but not very interesting or complicated."
"D: well the light body lends to drinkability. Pretty decent overall and met my expectations for a Redhook brew."
"Thin-bodied and certainly drinkable, but an average offering at best."
"D- Decent beer, not overly complex. I wouldnt kick it out of my glass, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it."
"As someone else said, this will be okay for a backyard BBQ because it's drinkability and low ABV will make it sessionable if it's paired with some heavily BBQd chicken but if you have some nice steaks, I'd go with something else and make a meal out of it!"
"D - A nice refreshing brew with a good aroma. Good for kicking back & grilling out in the cold."
"Drinks okay, this is a ho-hum kind of brown, I expected not much from Rad Hooks though. Glads this was part of a mixed sixer, otherwise I would've passed"
"If you like brown ales or ales in general, give this a try!"
"D: A decent, entry American brown ale with not a lot of bitter malt character and a somewhat glaring lack of hop bitterness as well. Not a terrible choice and pretty sessionable at 5.2% ABV, Mudslinger would not be an unwelcome offering in a variety 12-pack, I guess."
"A good solid offer, but nothing to ponder over (if that's what you're after)"
"12oz bottle purchased at Shaw's in Windham, NH. Pours a crystal clear copper-brown body with a thin film of short-lived off-white head. Hints of chocolate, coffee, nut waft from the aroma. Sweet maltiness hits the tongue with coffee, caramel, chocolate notes toward the finish. Light and effervescent in mouthfeel, combining with subdued and balanced flavor to make this a refreshing and drinkable beer. Cleaner and more of an easy drinker than just about any other brown ale I've had. This beer straddles the fence between being too robust and flavorful to compete with the crisp simple spring seasonals of the world and being too light and crisp to be a true brown ale but manages to avoid both. A welcome distraction from the light crisp simple spring beers out there."
"Nice looking beer here, chesnut brown with a nice looking large frothy/thick tan head. Ok aromas of caramel and buscuit malts, pleasing. Taste pretty similar to the aroma, very caramel , semi sweet, slightly toasted. Hardly any hop . Ok on the palate, on the thin side but this is to style. Overall a well drinkable and likeable Brown Ale. Not complex, simple like the style is meant to be."
"D - Easy.... too easy. 5.2 and not taxing."
"Mud Slinger has the same over-moulded, far too transparent bottle that the rest of the Red Hook line seems to have, with the stylized wheat and what must be a series of conifers from their logo. Be beer is a deep burgundy, with a darker tan head that remains for a while. Mud Slinger smells malty, hops, and just a hint of nuttiness. It's lightly sweet, with just the right amount of hops to the malts. The mouth feel is lightly carbonated, chewy and viscous. The slightly bitter aftertaste from the hops is the last thing on your palate. Honestly, the flavour could be more nutty, since it aspires to be a Brown Ale, and the finish keeps this otherwise good offering from being great."
"Good drinkability, refreshing and subtle, but I didn't detect any 'nuttiness' - maybe mine was a bit past it's prime."
"D- Good hoppy session beer without giving you ""IPA funk"" on the tongue."
"Overall: This beer is has a bold malty notes with a subtle hoppy tones. It has a really nice flavor and is very easy to drink I like it for being a mass marketed brew."
"However, I'm a sucker for that warm cereal smell even if it seems out of place on this mahogany-colored beer. Too bad the rest of this one is too blasé to bother with."
"There is really not a whole lot going on here. First thing that came to mind was a strawberry fruit smoothie, not usually a good thing for a nut brown ale. Light malts are pushed to the background by a light fruity flavor, which really implies it has no strong flavor aspect at all. Yea, there is some hop bitterness on the finish but again it is not that hard to stand out against the totally unimpressively light malt body, flavor and mouthfeel. This was an impulse six-pack purchase a couple days ago and I am already thinking how to dispose of the remaining four bottles...I am sure someone will drink them but it sure as hell wont be me."
"This beer pours a clear dark amber, not quite brown, color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into decent lacing. The aroma is of faint caramel, and not much else. It is a very simple aroma for a brown ale. The taste is similar to the aroma. Boringly simple. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. This is a nice mouthfeel. Overall, this beer is everything I have come to expect from Redhook....mediocrity. While it isn't horrible I can't see myself turning to this beer when I'm in the mood for a brown ale."
"D: This is an easy drinking spring offering. That pretty much sums it."
"This pretty much has a cloying sweetness that really detracts. There is nothing here that resembles a brown ale. With a name like Mudslinger, I was expecting something more roasted with some chocolate for some reason. Nothing like that here. Not the worst thing ever, but nothing to seek out. I would not recommend this."
"Overall, if they called this a ""Dark"" Pale Ale, the number scores would have been a little higher, but what's the purpose? Not a horrible beer, but not one I can recommend either."
"http://mikesbrewreview.com/review-of-redhook-mud-slinger-ep006/"
"Overall, this beer wasn't a let down because I wasn't expecting much. This beer just didn't pack a lot of flavor. It is drinkable since it is so small, but nothing I want to drink a lot of."
"D- very sessionable, since it's such an easygoing beer"
"This is on the good side of inoffensive. Not interesting, but drinkable."
"D: Despite my grievances about the mouthfeel, the light flavors and thin body helped this beer go down very easily. I drank four before I realized how fast I was putting them away. A fairly good session beer, and it would be even easier to drink in warmer weather."
"A very drinkable brown ale. It's reasonably sessionable, if you can get past the slight cloying nature. With Deschutes Buzzsaw recently retired this one fills that early spring brown ale void pretty well. It may be the best Redhook brew I have had. I'll probably pick up some more of this in season, especially on sale."
"A little early for a springer beer in mid January, but I won't let that stop me. Appearance pours a dark amber with a fair head and good lace. Smell of malt, caramel a little molasses and nutty. Taste is woodsy with the caramel malt having a low hop to it and there is something else there that I just can't put my buds on, but leaves a cloying. Mouthfeel is medium that goes down slick with the low carbonation. Still has a little heaviness to it that makes me call it more of a late winter than a spring beer."
"D: A mellow beer, probably built around drinkability, but the bottle I had was pretty bland."
"Smell is of a hint of chocolate and roast, with a light citrus finish. Unfortunately, the taste does not carry through as pleasantly. The beer tastes like a brown ale, with mud actually added in. An unfortunate theme for what I was hoping would be a decent ale. Glad I bought just the one bottle."
"D: Fairly drinkable at 5.2, but the malt and fruit becomes a little cloying. Wouldn't want more than one of these..."
