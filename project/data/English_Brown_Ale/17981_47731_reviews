"The fact I can see it as an excuse for the next few weeks of a sudden it was the best of the day before I get a follow back on my way home from work to be the first half of the year and I don't think that I have to go back and I don't"

"Great brown ale with hints of chocolate, coffee, toffee, caramel and roastiness.  Gets better as it warms.  Nice lingering one finger, creamy head.  Feels semi-thick in the mouth."
"Pours a very dark brown with a finger width head. Head quickly dissipates. Smell is a very nice expresso, coffee, and cocoa. Taste is also nice, but flavors of expresso and chocolate are less pronounced. Finish is smooth with a lot of carbonation and hints of nuttiness. One of the better brown ales I have experienced."
"Brown with a nice tan head.  A little thin in my opinion, but then I like chewy beers.  A little heavy on the carbonation too, but then that might be another way of saying I like heavy, chewy beers.  Definite coffee, caramel, and malt, with maybe some raisins or prunes in the background.  Another one in the ""plus"" column for Cigar City!"

"One of the best brown ales I've ever had with a great coffee taste that doesn't overpower. A definite must try!"
""

"Taste is chocolate up front with a burnt caramel middle, roasted malt with a touch of herbal hop bitterness. Mouth feel is largely a malt bomb with a lively carbonation. ."
""
""
"Had this beer many times always delicious.  Pours dark like a stout and smells chocolatey.  Lots of chocolate flavors along with vanilla, oatmeal, and toffee.  Probably my favorite brown ale to date.  Seriously like this beer."
""
"We have a different label. Dont think its the oatmeal but this is a damn good brown ale. Very sexy."
""
""
"Low level of carbonation keeps it smooth, but still enough to leave a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, a very good tasting beer, easy to drink.  Another nice one from Cigar City."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice tasting if a tad thin ale. Nice bitterness and hints of spices overshadow the oatmeal flavors. Glad I have more."
"Pours out an opaque brown with a rich creamy long lasting head.  Significant lacing throughout.  The taste and aroma are of rich malt with hints of coffee and toffee.  The finish is quite clean.  The feel is slightly thin but not enough to detract from the fine flavor.  Overall this is a really nice brown ale that I will buy many times and recommend to anyone who likes this style.  A little high in alcohol for a session beer but a couple won't knock you out either."
"my favorite brown ale for sure"
""
"Out of a can into a plastic cup at a booth in Epcot. Virtually no head, but a nice dark brown color. Very nice taste and smell."

"Solid brown at 5.50 a can not a bad markup considering it's typically not available in Pittsburgh.  This pours dark almost black when held toward the light I get a deep mahogany hue with light beige head, fine speckled lacing lines the sides of my glass.  Aroma dark fruit, hints of cocoa, a touch of iced coffee, and roasted nuts.  Flavor light tobacco earthy dank quality, tea leaves, dark chocolate dryness more like cocoa powder, and a hint of nutty coffee.  Mouthfeel medium bodied dry finish nearly perfect brown ale, perfect level of natural dark roasted malt sweetness dark malts and low IBU level dry out the finish with tannic tea and tobacco notes.  Overall highly impressive flagship beer from the folks at Cigar City!"

"O: Simply a great ale, brown or otherwise."
""

"poured dark brown in color with slight ruby highlights, no head whatsoever that left no lacing sticking to the glass.a combination of grains and brown sugar were noticeable upfront in the nose alongside hidden coffee, mild sugar and traces of vanilla. The brown sugar character is just as potent on the palate with oatmeal grain flavor and a touch of coffee. The brew was light to medium in body with a very low amount of carbonation which had a sweet malty finish."

""

"Poured from a can, this is a great brown ale with lingering notes of coffee, malts and chocolate. Easily enjoyable in any setting where caramelized malts that are roundeed out with hints of tobacco and leather are desired. This is a fantastic session beer."

"Pretty good British brown, although I do seem to pick up a bit of tartness that doesn't belong. Poured at a good temperature with a modest, lite brown, foamy, thick head that soon all but disappears and no lace. Color is an almost clear amber brown with some bubble trails. Aroma is a very fragrant malt, nutmeats, cocoa, toffee, bit of roast. Flavor's like nose and very we'll balanced. The off tartness vanishes with a little time. Body/carbonation are about perfect. Finish is like flavor, has a few medicinal qualities that linger, and is overall very drinkable."
""

"O- Was not too sweet yet not bitter. Was a great balance of caramel, chocolate, and nut finish"
""

"12 oz can. Pours brown with creamy, long lasting, beige head. Aroma is of toasted malt, bread crust, coffee and piney hops. Body is medium, creamy and smooth. Toasted malt, piney hops, coffee, cacao, dark chocolate, and dark fruit fill the mouth. Finish is long, malty. Delicious brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor holds more barley, light toast, even lighter chocolate and some bready malt. The flavor was a tinge weak with a wateriness that pushed into the feel. The moderate carbonation adds a smooth feel but the wateriness detracts a bit."

"O-A really good brown ale, the only real drawback is that it was a tad watery."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fluffy head which diminishes relatively quickly and leaves little in the way of lacing behind, color is dark brown with hints of amber. Nose is mild, consistent with toasted brown bread and mild coffee. Palate feel is smooth, with low carbonation. Taste is mild and agreeable, with flavors of mildly sweet roasted malt, gentle hints of coffee and molasses. An agreeable malt-centric brown ale, with a pleasantly smooth mouth feel (due to the additional of oatmeal)."

"Pours deep brown with amber hues along the outside of the glass when held up to a light source - the head was a bit of a let down with very little retention and no lacing to speak of. Haha - wow! As soon as I smelled this one, I totally got the artwork on the can - tons of tobacco and cigar box on the nose - truly amazing actually. Dates and figs are also present in the nose, a bit of smokiness, sweet and earthy. Flavor is similar to the nose, with a big mouthful of dark chocolate, a hint of espresso, tobacco leaves, very earthy and enjoyable. No hops in the mix what so ever. Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium-bodied, not complaining, but I wouldn't be bummed if they beefed up the mouthfeel a bit. Carbonation is light and perfect for the style. Overall, I was totally blown away by this one - not expecting much (especially after the underwhelming appearance) and it was one of the better brown ales i've ever had. So earthy and sweet, just like a fine cigar."
""
"Is this a dark brown ale, or a light porter? I honestly don't have enough experience with the style to say. I have enough experience with Maduro-wrapped cigars to say that this beer doesn't particularly remind me of one; however, I imagine it would pair quite well with a good, dark cigar (or dessert and/or dinner, for that matter)."
""
""
""
""
"O- Underwhelming to me. It tasted good, but the flavors alone are not enough to carry this brew."
""
""
""

"after all the hype on this one, I wanted to like it a lot more than I did. it seems flat, and not as distinct as it was in my head. it had a dark brown color with a buried rusty glow and an inch of off white head that disappears instantly and does not come back. sitting flat in my glass after just a minute, the nose is probably the best feature. its dry, caramel forward English malt and a lathery chocolate body with burnt sugar and slight smoke notes. the flavor hits on all of these, but they just don't come together into a cohesive experience for me. im not getting the nutty, tobacco, or coffee notes everyone else seems to find in this, I just get chocolate malt and an earthy soil element. I like it, don't get me wrong, but this didn't blow my doors off. maybe ill have to try it a little closer to the source, not sure how well this traveled to Colorado... not quite enough carbonation, a little thin on the body, and not as drinkable or unique as i imagined. maybe a victim of my own expectations on this one."

"O: 3.5 This beer has a good blend of all the flavors going on. It's nothing I would see out, but I would have it again."
""
""
""
"Nice! Very smooth. Very understated and consistent to the point it could be overlooked for cigar city's other outstanding brews. Dark mahogany with basically little to no head and average smell but the flavor is amazing. Lower abv as well so while not quite a session could have a few and none the wiser. Thinner mouthfeel as well makes this a good any season type offering. Well done!"

"O- a simple yet solid brown ale. Its pretty straight forward but very approachable, would pair well with certain foods"
""
"Overall: I thought this was a delicious brew from Cigar City, and definitely one to try. I'm not a huge brown ale fan but this was more reminiscent of a porter or an oatmeal stout given its nature."
""
"O: A pleasant overall brown; it has an interesting nose and is sweet but not overly."

"Pours a hazy dark brown with very little head. This seems darker than most brown ales. The aroma on this is busting with toffee and espresso. This is hands down the best brown ale I've had. Loads of flavor, easy to drink, and great aftertaste, everything you could want. I am very impressed with this offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A light but smooth espresso, toffee/chocolate flavor with a load of peanuts at the finish. Not what I expected but very enjoyable!"

"Atmosphere is good. Large head, settles quickly though, and no real lacing. Nose is full of character... coffee malt, with sweet notes, fall spice, and chocolate. Oaty and grainy roasted coffee malt, with a little dark chocolate with a pungent finish. Overall, this is a really good quaff."
"Overall: It's a very refreshing brown ale that packs a lot of flavour and aroma- a very similar profile to a good porter like Edmund Fitzgerald or Black Butte, but the beer is on the thinner side and incredibly quaffable. It's like you crossed the flavour/aroma profile of Edmund Fitzgerald with the body and drinkability of an AAL. I like this one a lot!"
"Overall, this is a good beer, but not as good as when they first started making it."
""
""
""
""
"O - I loved this. Not bitter in the least making it very easy to drink."
""
""
"Overall this is an great brew that I would certainly have again given the flavor balance and mouthfeel. It seems like the type of brew you could enjoy at anytime, meal, sporting event, etc."

"Goodness, after enjoying this beer for over a year, I'm finally reviewing it. Sipping from the can at the moment; however, I know this beer has a fantastic hazy brown color. It smells heavily of toffee and chocolate , with a good amount of caramel and coffee. The taste is mainly the toffee, closely followed by coffee and then the roasted malts. What really makes this beer for me is the mouthfeel. Superbly creamy. I can't recall if they actually employ oats in the brewing process, but it certainly feels like it. Maduro coats the tongue and mouth, and I love that about it. No homo."

"Overall - This is a really good brown. A little too dry for my taste, but the flavor is great. I suppose that comes with the territory of an EBA, though. In any event, it kicks the tail out of Newcastle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this is decent enough, but too carbonated: I'll try it again some time in a smoother form, where I'm sure it will be rather pleasant."
""
"OVERALL: Nice beer for sure. I can see why it's a popular regular offering. It could be a touch creamier perhaps, especially for an oatmeal ale, but this is a flavorful and enjoyable brew. Love me some CCB. Cheers bring!"

"Overall: One of the better brown ales I have had. And it smelled like a hefeweizen and drank like a stout."

"Overall a real tasty beer with a great mouthfeel. Would be phenomenal to pair with a cigar."
""

"Overall. For a style that isn't my fav, this is a pretty decent beer. Could see myself easily putting back a bunch of these around the campfire."
""
""
"Overall: I had heard that this was a beer to seek out while in FL. It definitely didn't disappoint! It was fun to drink and went well with food (a big burger @ Ford's Garage in Ft. Myers, FL). I will look for this again while in Florida."

""

"Poured a brownish body with two finger offwhite head that stuck around and left some lace. Aroma hit several minor notes of caramel, bitter chocolate, toffee, coffee, some roasted malts, touchs of other sugar sweetness and a tad of grainy hops or breadiness (something akin to those) but nothing spectacular. Taste of the beer is more of the same. While it is medium bodied and easy to drink and has a drying sensation on the finish, there is nothing spectacular about the beer. There is a balance of sweet malts and dry, roasted malts as well as a touch of hops but I really can't say this beer is too sweet or has a peculiar dryness/breadiness/hopiness to it to classify it as something else. A good beer but one, that for me at least, is just slightly under par with some other, better, brown ales/oatmeal stouts (which I really didn't get any taste or feel of oats although it would explain the smoothness of the beer)."

"Had this beer on tap. Smooth finish. The chocolate and the roasted components are very well balanced. You can taste the oats in the after taste. The color is okay and had a decent ""head"" to it. Overall it's pretty good. Tastes great. So far Cigar City hasn't failed to impress."

"Overall - Excellent beer..perhaps a great dessert beer, but i can drink this on any occasion. It's not a session beer....but it's one of my favorite just to have as a standalone. Between this and the Rogue Hazelnut, i have been fully converted to loving Brown ales. the oatmeal aspect of it i did not really notice"
""
""
""
""

"d: easy to drink, while @ 5.5% ABV its on the higher end of ABV's for the style."

"Pours a dark sherry brown hue with a creamy one finger head and a rim of lacing,the smell is sherry,oak,chestnuts and a touch of chocolate,the mouthfeel is medium bodied with minimal carbonation and has tastes of chocolate,roasted nuts,tobacco,oak and finished with a toffee bittersweetness and overall it's easy to drink but could have a fuller feel cheers."
""
""
"Overall: I usually love cigar city, but I am not wowed by this one. The other cans in this sixer were all nice, but I am not getting as much flavor from this one. It is good flavor, but just really diminished."
"A superior brown ale, recommended for both Florida vacations and home consumption."

"Overall a good, robust brown ale. Flavorful enough to satisfy, light and clean enough to refresh."
"O: Cigar City could have called this an oatmeal porter and I wouldn't have batted an eyelash. That's a compliment. It's a bit too sweet to be a quick drinker, but it's richness belies its 5.5% ABV. Would make a great dessert beer."
""
""
""
"12oz bottle thanks to CruisaC, thanks man. Soft brown color with a quickly disappating head. Aroma is ok, mostly malt and a touch of sugar. Flavor is about the same. Decent beer but nothing I'd go seeking out a second time. Still, I was thankful to get the opportunity to tick this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty and well worth what I paid for the 6 pack."

"Maduro Brown Ale is a surprisingly dry and effervescent dark ale that's focused in its toasty taste, aroma, and texture. Delicious and effortless on the palate- ideal for nutty parmesean slices or softer earthen cigars."
""
""
"O- Definitely not one of my favorites by CCB but it's, at least, a nice and sessionable brown ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D - overall this is a really nice brown ale from Cigar City. It has nice complexity and a really nice interplay between the different flavors. I would love to try some of the other variations of this beer, but just being able to try this base version makes me happy enough."
"Bottled served in a pint glass, this is a pretty brown, clear, with red light throughout and 1 finger tan head with good retention, fluffy. Nice roasted malts on the nose, taste is sweet caramel and toffee malts on the front palate with espresso, tobacco, earthy hops on the middle, and very toasted peanuts or burnt bread at the back end. Moderate body, mod-low carbonation a bit thin/wet mouthfeel. A fantastic brown, has great drink-ability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer pours a dark reddish-brown with a thin off-white head. Smell is not quite what I'd expect from a brown ale, it's got that sweet caramel malt presence, but also a good amount of dark fruit like a Belgian dark ale, but not quite as well-integrated. Flavor incorporates that fruitiness from the aroma in a mellow way and combines it with some nuttiness and roasted malt - it's unique and fairly easy to drink. It's sweeter and less bitter than most brown ales. Mouthfeel is thin-medium bodied with nice carbonation, but a little too thin for the sytle. Overall, this is an interesting take on a brown ale that works fairly well. It's not a great beer, but it's certainly a good one."

"A good tasting brown beer with a nutty flavor, nicely hopped, and fairly low ABV. Decent beer for drinking and enjoying with food, but not highly remarkable."
""
""
""
"O: Typical run of the mill Brown Ale...maybe a bit sweeter than others. Not sure I'd go out of my way to get this one but I was glad to have tried it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- It's nice to see someone take a basic style and knock it out of the park. I don't typically seek out browns, but I will after stumbling upon this one. Absolutely worth seeking out."
"O - technically not sessionable at 5.5, this is still the kind of brown ale you could drink all night; there profile is solid...slightly sweet, delicious on the front end and the back, lots of roasted nutty goodness. Great brown ale offering up there with Avery's Ellies for any everyday beer."

"Dated March 2012 - are the hops gone after 6 months? Very much more on the English side of things – no citrus here and some interesting complexity. But too fizzy and a bit too… bitey."

"Pours a deep darker brown amber topped with a two finger cream colored head. Biscuity and nutty on the nose. Opens with toffee, caramel, light chocolate maltiness, hints of espresso and biscuity yeast, and finishes with roasted nuts including hints of cashew, peanuts, and almond. Medium body, smooth, and a pleasant level of gentle carbonation. One of the better American brewed English Brown Ales. I had the pleasure of enjoying."
""
""
"From a bottle before they started canning this one. Smells of chocolate and looks the part with a dark brown color, creamy cream colored head. Taste follows with mostly chocolate, some nice nuttyness, and a clean light finish. A little bite. This is a thinner brown ale than I have had before, but it doesn't sacrifice the flavor for the drinkability. A good brew that goes well in summer or winter time."
"Overall great from the bottle, I suspect Outstanding on draft the odd (in a good way) smokiness makes me crave a cigar, although I don't smoke cigars."
""
""
""
""

"O: It's OK, but really doesn't do a lot for me. I wouldn't hesitate to order one if my options were limited at a bar, but I don't think I would seek it out. Not my favorite CCB brew."
"Overall, this is a very nice brown ale. I don't think it shows the malt complexity of the best Northern English brown ales (for example, Samuel Smith's Nut Brown), but the hop character must certainly appeal to a lot of American drinkers."

"O - Having had this after the Cubano Espresso I probably didn't appreciate this guy as much. A nice soft drinking brown ale that pairs well with a good burger."
""
"O- I enjoyed this one. Wish their beers were available where I live."
""
"O- Very solid brown ale, not too sweet, but great flavor."
""
"Final Thoughts: Definitely not the best Brown Ale out there. It would probably go well with a cigar as there isn't enough flavor here to really make it stand on its own."
""
""
"Overall - An excellent brown ale... highly recommended..."
""
"The tan head disappears very quickly after the pour with minimal lacing. Color is a deep reddish-brown. The flavor is dominated by chocolate and caramel malts. The carbonation was too high for my liking, especially for this style of beer. I wanted to smoothly savor the roastyness of this beer, but the carbonation level interfered with this. Not a bad brew, but not a great one either."
"I was excited to try a Cigar City beer while vacationing in South Florida, but this offering was a bit disappointing."
""
""
""
"An hour later, the carbonation settled. The tang and effervescent disappeared. Score reflects that flavor and aroma, and body appearance, not head."
""
""
""
"O - An unfortunate bottling error with the carbonation leaves this brew with a relatively muted/dull flavor profile."
""
""
"O - Overall this was a surprisingly good beer. Really like the almost stout/porter qualities this beer has. Very tasty."

"Pours a clear brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and some nutty aromas. Taste is much the same with a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is easy to drink but nothing too exciting going on in my opinion."
""
"Overall a brew that is an exquisite representation of this style, with the oats giving it a nice smooth, creamy feel and a great drinkability. Most definitely one of the best Brown Ale's I have tasted to date..."
""

"O-Overall this is a good malty brown ale if you like bown ales(brown ales are not my favorite but for what it is it is a good beer) It is worth giving it a try if you never had it. Ive have yet to have a bad beer from cigar city."
""
"O - It started out good. Then came that burnt popcorn taste. Maybe this is old. I'm not sure why I got that taste. I had better try another."
""
"Damn enjoyable beer. Nice 1 finger tan color head. nice deep brown with a red tint color. easy to drink. not thick at all. tasted a tad strong towards malty ness but that was expected. nice after taste . overall a quality and much enjoyed beer . 6 pack was not enough"
"Cigar city's classic brown ale. Here in Miami where I live, this is a regular in any good craft beer store. It is also a regular in my refrigerator. It is sessionable and delicious."
""
""
""
""

"This is a unusual beer with lots of flavor and complexity. I can't think of a better beer to enjoy nice cigar because the flavors would compliment each other so well."
"For my first CC beer I was not disappointed, but not overly impressed. I look forward to my next one."
""
""
""
"O: a very nice session brew. Served it at my wedding with our Cuban themed meal. Fit perfectly. Enjoyed at the end of the night with a nice cigar. Highly recommended. Cheers!"
""
""
"A good brown ale with just enough roast and grainy malt balance. Would definitely recommend this and have it again when visiting CCB's distribution area."
""
"Certainly doesn't rank above my favs (Smutty Old Brown Dog, Sixpoint Brownstone) but it's a better than normal brown ale with a interesting twist (the oatmeal)"
""
""
"Best. Brown. Ale. Ever."
""
""
"Pours a hazy reddish brown with a light, thick, bubbly head that recedes leaving clear glass behind. Smell is of caramel and oatmeal. Taste is slightly sweet with very little hops. Mouthfeel is medium with active carbonation. Overall very drinkable but not as distinctive as many of their other beers."

"O: Not a bad brew by any means, nice mix of spicyness and flavors. I could def see myself sitting down at a smoke shop with one of these in hand."
"This is a tasty beer that also smells. Dry good. It has a balanced feel to it. I would love to have this again by the camp fire in the fall."
""
""
"I don't know what I was expecting, probably the whole greener grass thing from not getting Cigar City in my hometown, but this is a good brown ale, if not an outstanding one."
"A bit less than a full finger of medium brown head, over dark brown nearly opaque body, needed to hold up closely to light to see several streams of small rising bubbles. Nose is fairly complex, some light roasted floor malt, tobacco (!), caramel and floral hops. Taste mirrors nose, easy drinking personified. Mouthfeel is medium, light effervescence. Not bad, I need a Cubano sandwich to fully enjoy this. Would be interested in trying the more complex versions of this base beer."

"Pours a dark brown with a reddish hue with a white head and fair lacing. A sweet aroma of caramelized sugar, oats, and bready malt. I usually find the aroma of browns to be lacking but found the oat component really gave some substance to this one's smell. Flavor is expectedly on the sweet side as well with some caremalized brown sugar, molasses, nutty, some oatiness and the slightest touch of roastiness. Medium mouthfeel with some slight carbonation. Overall,I love oatmeal stouts and was stoked to finally try this oatmeal brown, really glad I didas it totally lived up to and surpassed my expectations."
"Overall: This was a nice gift from the lady a few months. Finally happy to be enjoying this lovely treat. This is the second time I have had a beer from the brewery and am not dissapointed one bit. Wish I had more."
"O - A great brown ale, mellow and sessionable. I'd love to have this on cask, it'd be wonderful."
"O - This is a really good English Brown. Cigar City continues to impress me."
""
""
""
"The medium body seems just right considering the 5.5% ABV. It is easily palatable and quaffable, having an almost gulpable drinkability. The carbonation just barely noticeable, doing little to interfere with the flavors. The swallow is a very foamy but this only adds a creaminess at the end."
""
""
""
""
"Malty aroma has notes of caramel and cinnamon. It pours a clear mahogany with a thick, fine-bubbled light cinnamon-tan head. Lively, malty flavor has notes of cinnamon, cloves and caramel and just a hint of horehound. Smooth, fairly firm texture is a bit powdery and has a good amount of fizz."
""
"In all honesty, there are some nice nuances in this beer. There's an intriguing spice rack presence which is neither way off-base, nor on-the-money. There's a little sweetness from the grains, but overall balanced and even slightly bitter. It's not a prize, but it's a pretty decent example. 3.5"

"Overall, very smooth and pleasant brown ale."

"Had really expected more, but maybe later a try to find out if there really was nothing wrong with this beer."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied is the name of the game. It isn't sticky, doesn't leave a film and isn't particularly drying. When a sip is taken, it flows very smoothly, allowing you to get the flavors and refreshes, washing down clean."
""
""
"Pours very dark brown, almost black, with a ring of foam (none sits in the middle). Caramel, toffee smell. Quite malty, light sweet nutty taste. Much caramel. Chewy and with vanilla. Some chocolate pokes through in the finish. Very small bitter at the close. Fuller bodied than most brown ales, another good Cigar City brew."
"Bottle: Poured a deep clear brown color ale with a nice thick foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of roasted malt with deep notes of caramel and light toffee notes. Taste is also a nice mix between some deep caramelized malt with balanced sweetness level and some light toffee notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation. Very well brewed and balanced and malt profile is quite exquisite. Very well done for style I don’t particularly care for."
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a ruby red tint in the light. One finger heaad with lace. It's aroma is of chocolate, toast, nuts, and a hint of smoke. The flavor has notes of dark chocolate, oatmeal with molasses, roasted malt, and a mild hoppy bitterness comes through in the finish. The mouthfeel is full, smooth, and creamy. Cigar City Maduro Oatmeal Brown Ale is a very good beer, complex, and balanced. Highly recommended."
""
"Very tasty easy drinking brown ale. Well done!"
""
""
"Overall: The tobacco flavor was too pronounced and noticeable for me to pick out and enjoy any of the other flavors."
""
""
""
"More soft creaminess on the palate, oatmeal gives it a pleasant smoothness and creamy feel. Mellow husky bitterness, tobacco leaf and touches of roasted malt. Nice lingering bitterness in the aftertaste, fairly drying, zero sweetness. Overall pretty nice and drinkable with subtle flavors that keep things interesting."
"Overall, a very drinkable brown ale. Pretty textbook for the most part with a few good characteristic flavors."
""
""
""
"O- This was a great brown ale. Nice nutty taste balanced with a sweet caramel taste. One of the better brown ales I've tried, but probably not my all time favorite. Easily drinkable and definitely recommended. Would buy again when I'm in Florida."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a very good brown ale. Low in ABV but big in flavor and feel. The nose wasn't as good as the taste but the flavor made up for the lack of aroma."

"Overall - This is a great beer. Could possibly be my new session beer. Give it a whirl and taste for yourself. Cheers!"
""
""
""
"Pretty nice from start to finish."
""
""
""
"Pours a very dark brown with a thin, tan head. The aroma is lightly roasted malts, caramel, faint coffee, and a little bit of hops. The flavor is light to medium body, sweet throughout. Smooth and creamy, and clean, but somewhat dry in the finish. Pretty good Brown Ale, very sessionable."
""
"I'm a newcomer to Florida craft brewing - but if this is how they do it down here I'm a fan."
""
""
"I recommend picking up this brown. It is a very good get."
"O- just an average brown ale in my opinion, nothing special here."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am kind of stunned this has such great reviews. I have never been a huge fan of brown ales so maybe it is that good but it seems very similar to Voodoo's brown ale with a low ABV."
"Wow. A real treat to drink. Only great things about this beer."
"Still very very good but slightly better on tap."
"O: Really a nice beer and worth a try. Its very smooth and dark with the malts never getting heavy or too roasty. Something initially held me back from giving it a higher rating. I think it was the exceptional smoothness. It doesnt go over the top anywhere and thats what a brown ale should be, IMO."
"Coaxed out of a 12oz bottle into a glass. Dark mud brown cant see through it. Nice head that slowly sinks down. Carbonation does hang around though. COFFEE hit right away with chocalte in the background. This is a deep complex beer no doubt. Very filling you'll be dammed to finish the whole six pack. I.m not sure what to pair it with cause it stands out so much on its own but i guess a t-bone would go well with it."
""
"Takin' this one down without a nice maduro cigar... It pours a deep ruby-brown topped by a finger at best of sandy ecru foam. The nose comprises coffee, roasted malts, toasted bread (can't pick out what kind of bread, though), and a touch of light char. The taste holds notes of roasted malts, light maple syrup, toasted caramel, toasted oats, brown sugar, and light coffee. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a vaguely smooth feel. Overall, a very nice, robust brown, something I wish I had access to at all times 'round here. Good times."

"Very inexpensive beer with tremendous drinkability. The beer offers a new experience in regards to brown ales and I can't wait to pair it with a cigar. I would recommend this beer to most people and would love to try it aged on cedar."
"This is a nice change of pace for a brown ale. I like the woody, cigar-like notes and I like the brown sugar notes as well. The flavor profile is great. The mouthfeel is a bit dry which makes the flavor leave the palate a little early. Overall, a great brown ale."
""

"O- Easy drinkability, not a lot going on, glad to try it once, would not go out of my way to buy it."

"O - great work. easily one of the best brown ales out there."
""
""

"Appearance of this brown ale from CCB is dark brown with a one finger head. The smell has chocolate, malts and nuts. Its` taste has raisins, caramel, molasses and some bread. Mouthfeel is light-medium, a creamy texture. This is a very nice tasting brown ale, a style that I do not frequent. But this one is worth your time."

"O: A good brown ale, overall, with a nice mix of nutty and chocolaty flavors and aromas. It's a bit watery and doesn't have much depth, but is still tasty for a beer with a relatively low abv."
"O-a potent example from a respected southern brewery. I bet the have some delicious barrel age beers."
""
""
"D: [Drinkability] Highly drinkable. Cigar City has added a degree of excitement to an otherwise rather mundane style. An excellent take on an American Brown Ale."
"O: It's a funky example of a brown. I could picture drinking this while chewing on a cohiba cigar. I caught no banana esters or diacetyl apple on my bottles. No signs of infection."
""

"overall a very funky darn brown. it's got a great balance of nuttiness, oatmeal, toasted flavors and bite."

"O: This is the best Brown Ale I have ever had. It taste so good and I wish I could get ahold of a lot more of this."
"Pours a dark brown color with just a hint of red. Medium off-white head. Scent is quite interesting...not like a typical brown ale. I get some distinct green apple and melon aromas with a hint of vanilla. Very malty, and a little funky at the same time. Taste is...yep..I'm thinkin I understand the strange aroma. I'm thinkin this beer is a bit infected. Initially I get a slightly funky/tart green apple flavor immediately followed by some earthy hops. Then I get some very nice malt flavors with just a hint of chocolate and vanilla. Melon and tropical flavors with just a bit of nutty and coffee flavors at the end. If this beer is infected, I think it should stay this way. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is a bit overly carbonated...kinda like club soda. Drinkability is high. Overall, American brown ales are not really my thing, but this is definitely one of the better one's I've had. Possible infection could be key to me liking this one so much."
""
""
"Overall: This does NOT taste like an American brown...so, I can't reccomend it to someone who is looking for that. This is plain mislabeling...however...oh, what the hell; I'm not a BJCP judge! This is a solid, albeit weird-ass beer."
"I dont find any hops and the ABV is low in % and unnoticeable. The beer is well crafted and tasty, not super complex, but it is good solid brown ale. I would recommend this to friends as a tasty malt lovers beer that you could have a few of in a session."

"M: Light to medium body, good carbonation, and very smooth."

"Light brown with an orange hue to it. There was some retention to the one finger of beige head and it left a bit of lacing on the glass. There is some light cider to the nose, which is a bit odd for this style. The upfront taste is bready, but surprisingly thin, especially in the finish. This was my first Cigar City offering; I have heard positive things about this brewery, but this beer left me a bit disappointed."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a pretty solid brew. Quaffable and full of flavor, bright and complex. Reminds me of Alesmith's Nautical Nut Brown in a way though finishing with a bit more sweetness."
"Not a bad brown. A little sweet, but pretty solid."
"This is a pretty good brown ale. I've had better, but this was decent. I could have done with a little less bitterness and a little more body. I wouldn't mind pairing it with a cigar like the label suggests. It's probably strong enough to stand up to one. It's certainly worth a try if you can find it."

"Body is a nearly opaque brown color. A large, 2-inch, frothy, khaki colored head develops and remains for some time. Smells of alcohol, oats, clove, and sugar. Some faint nuts and grains are detectable in the rear. It tastes of sweet sugar, grains, faint hops, various nuts, oats, and some nicely toasted malt in the rear. Mouthfeel is smooth but with a faint alcohol bite towards the end. Overall, a great brown ale."
"Not quite as good as Jai Alai, for certain, but one could do worse than getting a bottle or two of Oatmeal Brown. Good steady."
"Overall, this beer is very sessionable. However this comes at a price, it seems to lack any real malty pop. This would not be my first suggestion from Cigar City's line of beers."
"O: Very subtle, easy drinking and sessionable. Darker malts are showcased very well highlighting brown sugar, molasses, cocoa and earth. A solid Brown Ale."
"12oz bottle. Have had this one a couple times now. It pours into a glass a browish red clear color. with a small head the left quickly. The smell is bitter sweet chocolate with a oatmeal smell finish. the taste is sweet on the front with a bitter roasty almost coffee like after taste. Nicely balanced with a nice bitter after taste that makes you want another sip. Not too much going on going on in this beer but it is still a very nice drinking beer. On to the next one!!!"
"Cigar city is in Columbus Ga. Very cool. Can't wait to try the imp stouts."
"O: Extremely drinkable, quite tasty, a great brown ale."
"Pours a crystal clear reddish brown. There is a nice one finger tan head that dissipated rather quickly. A thin ring of head does stay though. Smell is mostly roasted malts and nuts. Smells wonderful. Taste is along the same lines as the smell, just not at robust. I get coffee and some kind of nut on the taste. There is also minimal dark chocolate coming through as well. The mouthfeel is thin and medium carbonation. Overall, an excellent brown ale. I would have liked to have seen a thicker mouthfeel but that is nitpicking. I am not a fan of brown ales, but this one is delicious. This 6-pack should be gone within a few days!"
"Pours a dark brown color with a one finger head that lasts. Aroma of sweet malts, chocolate and coffee. Taste follows the nose. Easy drinking but it has a different mouthfeel, it almost leaves a film in my mouth. It's still really tasty, I really like this brew!"
"D - Very easy to drink for sure."
"great beer. would love to drink again"
"Overall: A nice, competent, malty brown ale. It's no wonder they use it as the base for seemingly hundreds of varieties of alternations, tweaks, and add-ons."
"Overall: Very good beer, unique taste and flavor, definitly will enjoy this one again."
"Overall: Very drinkable. Complex flavors. I really enjoyed this beer."
"Thank you miamichael2 for the trade!"
"O: Haven't had a Cigar City offering yet that wasn't impressive. Many brown ales rely too much on over-bearing sweetness. This beer doesn't overdo it which is a nice change of pace."
"This the first Cigar City beer I've had. THis is a fine example of their brewing I must say.Cracked this bottle open and took a whiff of this beer's fine malty roasted nutty aroma.I must add that the taste is similiar to the smell,but smoother. Hint of treats of roasty brown sugar and chocolate.THis appeared at first to look like a porter.Taste is close to a porter. But is a fine brown ale.Overall a very enjoyable beer.Ya can't go wrong with this one."
"Tastes less intense than it smells, but more pleasantly rough. You got some nutty and chocolately nodes up front, moving into rough and lightly sour oatmeal and bitter barley middle, finishing on a lightly vinous taste of tobacco, caramel, and peat moss. Fantabulous."
"Taste is nice but not spectacular, i feel i bit flatness in this beer, nothing really excels. I get a bit of a watery mouthfeel, yet still drinkable."
"O: I don't know if this is an old bottle, or if something happened to it on it's journey to my palate, but it's definitely not how this beer was intended to taste."
"Overall, a very flavorful and well balanced brown ale. Of the four Cigar City beers I've had, this is the best in my opinion. A great take on the average brown ale."
"Overall: my first nitro-tap brew and it was great. Maduro is a delicious complex brew. Cigar city never disappoints and they just keep them coming! Cheers!"
"Maybe my favorite CCB beer so far but I haven’t had Hanuphu or cracked my Marshall Zhukov’s yet. Really nice, delicious take on this style that’s somehow true to it while being very original at the same time."
"O - Another wonderful brew from CCB... I wish they distributed to Colorado..."
"Overall pretty tasty brown ale would probably be better if it was smoother but not bad as is."
"its pretty decent. not my favorite style, but would like a bit more roast/bitter chocolate to balance the sweetness."
"O) We don't get Cigar City in Wisconsin, so I was pretty excited about this six pack. It turns out this was not worth the effort or the extra money involved. I tried a second bottle and the results were the same. I was still skeptical, so I had a few other people sample this before I completed the review. The results were the same. I am admittedly disappointed, but I am chalking this up to the beer going bad, and bad beer karma on my part. I'm not sure what I did to have caused this bad beer karma, but I will proceed with caution. In any case, I love brown ales, and would like to try this again. I'm guessing it would be better, and I would gladly add an addendum to this review."
"O: A really solid brown ale, one of my favorites in recent memory."
"Carbonation is fine, body could use a lift and some girth. A little too light and watery."
"3.5, 3.5, 4, 3, 3.5"
"O: Solid beer with excellent character."
"It's an okay beer, but I don't need more."
"O: I would definitely get a case of this to share - if only it weren't 900 miles away :(..."
"O: A very solid beer. Not the best brown ale I've ever had, but definitely a very good brew. Nice job, Cigar City."
"O: Very tasty and flavorful brown ale with contrasting sweet followed by bitter. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Will have many more--if I can get some!"
"O: not quite as good as some of its other flavored offerings but still a very decent beer from CCB."
"Overall: very tasty and drinkable brown. I'm going to give a little bonus here because as the brew warms up further, the aroma and flavor are taking on some darker, fruitier characteristics; almost like it's heading for Belgian territory."
"D) base of beer is ok though it feels somewhat incomplete; nice mouthfeel and body; any nuances were hidden by the unfortunate metallic, bitter flavor at end; i am not sure if there is something wrong with my bottle but i wonder; i did drink the whole bottle if there was anything strange going on it was minor"
"M- Very thin with a medium carbonation. Would like a slightly bigger mouthfeel but feels okay."
"Overall, this is good for a musky kind of brown.  I keep getting cigar in it, quite the coincidence considering the brewer."
"This is one of the better brown ales that I have had. Unfortunately for Cigar City, there are better brown ales out there. This is a solid offering, but it is on the boring side."
"This was a very tasty beer, there was great flavor and it was perfectly balanced. I would drink this again."
"Cheers..."
"Overall, I love this beer and cannot wait to try others from CCB! Highly recommended."
"Overall this is a really tasty brown. A little bolder than I like for a brown ale but it is so good I don’t hold that against it."
"I love brown ales, and I love this brown ale like a child. It's not my sister's stupid imaginary kids who are cute but every one of their flaws is a pain the tuches. It's one of my imaginary kids in this brown ale family, and I shouldn't choose a favorite."
"Overall: This may be my second favorite brown, first being brookyln brown. I really liked this one and would like to try more of their other beers that use this as its foundation."
"Taste is up front with malts. The sweetness that the smell hinted at is missing. Dark fruits come in somewhere and disappear just as quickly. What sticks around is the malt."
"O-Being a Floridian I'm always glad when a Florida brew exceeds my expectations, and CCB has done an excellent job at creating a delicious Brown Ale that does just that."
"Overall: A great oatmeal brown."
"Poured an attractive dark brown color with a nice fluffy head that lasted for a good while. Aroma was of bourbon, tobacco, and caramel malt. Had a thinner mouthfeel than I was expecting. Taste was good, pretty much like the aroma. Good beer, would definitely have again."
"UPDATE: On 8/25/11, I spoke to a friend who had this on tap last weekend in Philly, and he too claims that it was infected."
"Pours a rich brown color with a yellowish off white head and little lace. Aroma is malty, with suggestions of candied pecans. In the flavor, robust maltyness, nutty, and rich. For a brown ale, this packs in lots of flavor. Hops come accross oh so lightly, just a small wood note, and a distant earthyness. Brown sugar, roast, oats, and burnt caramel. Medium to full bodied feel. Overall, this is an exceptional brown ale, and quite possibly the best I've come accross."
"O: The best brown ale I've had. As I said I'm not a fan of the style. But I could drink this one on occasion."
"This bottle may be in the early stages of an infection...not sure as this is my first ever Maduro. Still pretty good but there are some off notes. This will soon be available in Georgia so when it comes in I will check one out again and re-rate if necessary."
"overall pretty good... not typically a brown ale fan but i like this one."
"Pours a solid dark brown with faint reddish highlights when held to light. Smallish off white head dissipates quickly to a cap. Smell is kind of fruity with dark pitted fruit and a hint of alcohol. Slight earthy aroma and hints of chocolate round out the nose nicely. Taste is fruity and caramel with hints of chocolate and ethanol. Slightly dry finish with a lingering fruity ethanol taste. Medium body ans level of carbonation with a somewhat watery mouthfeel. This sample was certainly better than the infected version, but its still an unremarkable beer. My score will reflect this bottle."
"O: I liked this one. The nutty aftertaste was especially nice. Will drink again."
"a solid beer, very sessionable and satisfying."
"Medium body with a nice creamy mouthfeel. Overall, the flavor profile didn't seem quite as pronounced as the aroma, but this was still one of the better brown ales I've had in recent memory."
"Very straightforward brown that hits all the appropriate notes. Pretty good brew."
"O: A good brown ale. One of the better Cigar City beers, actually."
"O - Definitely one of the better browns that I've had in some time its good taste makes it easy to drink worth picking up to try sometime if you see it around"
"A very tasty, somewhat sweet, though well balanced brown ale. I'd drink more of it, and keep it stocked in my beer fridge, if I had access to it."
"O - A pretty solid Brown ale."
"Like the only other Cigar City beer I've had at this point, Maduro tastes somewhat ""unfinished", more like a batch of homebrew than commercial beer. I'm willing to chalk it up yet again to an off-bottle, but until this brewery can capitalize on their popularity enough to expand distribution - or until I find another trading partner as generous Ultraman9000 - I can't be sure that this brewery's beers aren't just better in ratings than they are in reality."
"D: As they say on the bottle, this one would make ""a fine accompaniment to a premium cigar."""
"O: Overall this was an awesome brown ale. Very smooth and drinkable. I wish I could drink this on an everyday basis. Highly recommend!"
"This is a good, straightforward brown ale, but it gets a great boost from the oats. Reminds me of Surly Bender, though its flavor doesn’t rise to that level of complexity. It definitely improves as it warms up, with the mouthfeel coming into its own, and some of the more subtle flavors coming out. I like it."
"On tap at Mellow Mushroom. Arrived in a pint glass with no head. Very dark brown. Smell is of dark fruit and roasty malt. Taste is a big surprise. Smoky tobacco, espresso, sweet roasted malt. Seems like a great wintertime beer. Pretty complex flavor, like coffee and a cigarette. Medium to thin mouth with low carbonation and a mildly sweet tobacco finish."
"Big thanks for this to beerbeerbeerbeer, very unexpected. Pours a dark brown with a bit of red in the color. Smells sweet and sugary. Big malt smells to it as well. Taste is very sweet and sugary, just like the nose. Has a cigar quality to it, tasted like a cigar smells I s'pose. Very light and carbonated, yet still creamy. The aftertaste lingers on and on for quite some time. Nice first experience with cigar city. Hoping my mom can pick me up a variety of samplers when she heads down to Florida."
"This beer poured out as a deep looking brownish red color, there was a healthy looking tan head on top of the beer that left some hints of lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer is roasted and nutty, has some slight aromas of coffee and grains as well. The taste of the beer is rich with dark sugary sweetness upfront that fades with a bitter roasted aftertaste. The mouthfeel of this beer is smooth, it's semi thick and to me just had a really good body to it. Overall this beer is quite nice and I enjoy picking it up from time to time when I'm in the mood for a good brown ale."
"This beer is really nice; I like the malty brown ale that this is. It is definitely hoppy, but it plays only a supporting role and I could drink a whole lot of this beer; I think I might like this beer as much as I do the Jai Alai. Knowing Joey’s preferences in beer, I can definitely see his hand in this beer; I know he likes a good brown ale. So do I, and this one definitely hits the spot; it is one of the best brown ales I have had in quite some time."
"One of the best brown ales I've ever sampled. Very complex and playful on the senses."
"O- Very solid brown ale. Though the esters were coming in a bit strong, it still melded well together. A base beer with the complexity of this really wants to make me seek ot some of the variations CCB offers..."
"Smooth, balanced and great flavors."
"Overall: Best brown ale that i have ever had. No contest! Next time i want a great brown ale, I guess I am driving from Illinois down to tampa florida! Seriously that good! This beer is true to its style, flavorful, and complex. The cherry on top is how wonderfully creamy this beer is...Home run by Cigar City Brewery!"
"O: The taste profile on this actually isn't so bad but this body is just not the platform for this beer. Absolutely no oatmeal in this for me and the spiciness mixed with a sourlike body is just bad. Maybe I had a bottle, but as I stands this beer is inconsistent and bad."
"O: So disappointed that my one bottle of maduro is compromised. I want to revisit this but it's hard to want to seek out something after being burned once. Living in California and seeking out something in Florida isn't that easy, and it's always disappointing when there's a compromised bottle. I will seek this out again, but it will likely have to be when I've forgotten about this incident."
"O: I don't drink to many brown ales, but I really enjoyed this brew. You can tell there are some great complexities in this off the shelf beer, and that's great to see. Wish I could get CCB up here!"
"Overall: It's not a bad brown ale but I wish it had more flavor. It has great drinkability and goes down pretty damn smooth."
"My pour netted a finger of deep tan head with low retention, falling like Wile E. Coyote off of a cliff. Color was a slightly hazy deep brown. Nose had a smoky milk chocolate character, sweet with a slightly smoky tang. Mouthfeel was medium and it was very sweet on the tongue, like sweet chocolate along with a strawberry flavor. I would NOT be pairing this with an actual Maduro cigar, but perhaps one with a lighter wrapper and taste. Finish continued to be on the sweet side with a light sourness on the extreme finish. Color me not a fan."
"Overall: smooth, delicious; the kind of brown ale you look forward to. Cigar City does beer right!"
"Oatmeal ale means delicious creaminess. 'nuff said. This is one of the top five brown ales I've ever had."
"O: Nice beer, easy drinking, good flavor, ABV is hidden. Only thing I can seriously knock is the body, it's so thin and watery. If that were fixed, I could see myself trading for this one on a regular basis."
"Drain poured."
"The mouthfeel doesn't have that thickness that I was expecting from the look. It is smooth and light with a full carbonation that is almost too fizzy. A solid brew that tastes WAY better then it looks."
"D - This is a really tasty brown ale. Wakes up the taste buds."
"O - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit for what it was. I find a good brown ale to be a nice experience, although not necessarily a world class one. I'd say this fit the bill and would drink it again."
"O- This is a nice brown ale and very enjoyable. I am very glad that I was able to get a six pack and still have a few left to drink."
"Overall, one of my favorite brown ales around. Tons of flavor packed into one bottle that manages to stay refreshing at the same time. Definitely something I would love to have again. I can see the variations also being awesome as this beer would really benefit from another layer."
"O: This was a very interesting take on a brown. There were points of this beer where I wish I had dessert to pair it with. There's a nice balance of sweet fruit and spice, but the malt character doesn't quite come through. The nose was definitely a highlight for me, but the overall experience was cut short by the nice flavors in front falling off and not finishing very strong."
"Thanks to my bro for offering this one up - first I've had from Cigar City and I can say now that it won't be the last. Very drinkable and good to the last drop."
"Overall better than your average American Brown Ale. On its own I'd say it's good, but I can easily see why the brewers readily add to the recipe to make more off the wall concoctions. This is a beer that tastes like it could only get better with extra layers of complexity."
"O: Just sweet enough, it doesn't fall into the sugar bomb category. Definitely a different brown ale. I'd like more please!"
"Wow - my first from Cigar City and it did not disappoint. Smooth, balanced and great flavors. This is a very sessionable, very tasty brew. Great drinking case-worthy stuff here."
"Another solid CCB brew with incredible mouthfeel I would definitely have again. Maybe not necessarily search out in a trade but good none the less...Now if I can find me some Oatmeal Cookie!"
"Definitely one of the best brown ales I've had. Very deliciously drinkable."
"The body is very light as should be in a good Brown Ale."
"Poured on-tap at the Cigar City Brewing tasting room in Tampa. Served in a pint glass, the beer poured a deep, dark brown color with ruby highlights and a light, thin, foamy head. Smells of slight toffee and nut sweetness. Dark nut flavors, roasted, with a hint of old world fruit sweetness. Not as overly sweet as I would have thought. Very smooth and round bodied. Hazelnut and tangy caramel aftertaste, with a light and quick finish."
"Taste is a nice blend of yeasted bread and caramel nut maltiness. Mouthfeel though, is what gets me excited about this beer - creamy texture and the carbonation is pinpoint fine. I think there are a few brown ales I would rather have than this...malt in general seems a bit lacking and the yeast runs too rampant. While still good, I was a bit disappointed in this one."
"Not quite what I was expecting, but it wasn't terrible, just didn't taste like an American brown ale."
"O- Overall this is a very solid beer. I'm not much of a cigar aficionado but I could see this pairing nicely."
"Maduro has a very dark brown coloring with average lacing and no head nor retention on this particular pour. It's nose consists mainly of bready malts (almost a rye quality) with chocolate of some sort, and a spice that apparently is tobacco. Taste is identical. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium-bodied, good carbonation, with a medium-length bready finish and aftertaste. It's pretty drinkable, common for the style, but with some unique flavors that I've not really encountered in a brown ale before. No abv in either aroma or taste."
"O - Rather enjoyable; a sweeter brown with a lot of flavors playing off one another. The substantial hopping helps hold everything together. An excellent brew and an enjoyable diversion from the typical."
"O - Pretty good brown ale with some nice smokey notes and some nice roast. Tobacco and leather notes are quite pleasant and present. Very good brown ale."
"Ran into this at the Celebration Town Tavern in Celebration, Florida. Poured into a pint glass chilled, it shows a dark brown root beer/coffee color. Add to that a thin off-white head and fair lacing. I pick up caramel-malt and charcoal-coffee in the aroma. Decent. The flavor favors the coffee charcoal with an evergreen hop that adds a nice bite. Medium bodied with modest carbonation and a very dry feel. Plenty drinkable for the style which offers lots of taste and some stick to your ribs goodness. Another convincing performance from Cigar City."
"D/O- Each sip was like drinking two different beers. Would recommend to a brown and/or oatmeal stout fan. I'd guess better examples are few and far between."
"Overall, really good brown ale. It is complex - you can definitely tell they had an orgy of flavorings in mind for this brown ale. Cigar City puts out another solid ale! Touche guys, touche."
"O - This has good drinkability. The flavor is good and it goes down easy. I could easily drink a few of these in a night. Overall, I thought this was a very nice brown ale. I really enjoyed the big chocolate presence. I recommend giving this a try."
"overall, this is a great beer Im glad MiamiMichael gave me the opportunity"
"Pours a rich red brown with a great amount of off white head; this bartender knew what he was doing! The head stayed for a good amount of time and a nice swirl brought it back once it dissipated. The longer it sat, the more the smell increased. Espresso and a bit of smokeyness is what I smelled. I've never tasted a beer so smooth before! The flavors balance very well with chocolate and oatmeal mixing very well with a nice espresso finish. Smokeyness through out. This is a beer I could continuously drink, it's absolutely delicious!"
"O: horrible. Two sips, then drain."
"O- This is and excellent brown couldn't hardly put down the glass while i was reviewing this one. Browns are exactly my favorite but I could easily put these down every time I session."
"Mouthfeel is good, as this medium-bodied brew does its job of being a solid ale. And overall one would be hard pressed to call this beer anything besides what Cigar City Brewing itself labeled it: Sweet Oatmeal Brown. Yum."
"O - A very good brown ale. Not perfect, but I will definitely be drinking it again. Hopefully soon."
"Overall - Gratifying brown ale that leaves me craving a mild cigar to go with it"
"M ~ somewhat creamy....a very pleasant, soft mouthfeel... coats the palate as it makes its way back and down.. Very easy to sip!"
"O- Amazing flavors... Really sits well on the tongue. So amazing to sit and smell that I almost don't want to finish it."
"Extremely refreshing!"
"D: Awesome, very well balanced, great example of style."
"Overall: A good American Brown Ale from Cigar City. Recommended."
"Overall a fine brown ale that's almost like a porter."
"Overall it's an OK beer but not my favorite by a long shot. I really like Cigar city, but this one is just a somewhat feeble attempt from a great brewery,"
"O: Really nice brew here. It wasn't really what I was expecting but very very good."
"O - I typically really enjoy brown ales. This one was good, but it was a little to sweet for my liking. A one and done for me."
"Overall - a great beer. One of the best brown ales I've had. Continue to be impressed with Cigar City beers. If you get a chance, pick up some of this or trade for it. You won't be disappointed."
"O- Love this beer. A great brown ale that is good for any occasion. Another delicious beer by the great Cigar City"
"Overall, this is an awesome brown ale and all makers of this style should admire the boldness of this brew. Yum"
"O - The tobaco/smokeiness didn't grab me at first especially since it was so strong when I had it the first time on tap. Out of the bottle this beer is a little more enjoyable but ligher on the body."
"I'm a huge fan of brown ales in general ever since having my first Newcastle Brown Ale years ago. For the record, this blows Newcastle out of the English Channel waters! Pours a very clear medium brown with a light airy head that dissipates quickly leaving respectable lacing. Aromas of roasted malts and slight coffee up front. The back notes are exceptional, employing the typical, brown ale roasted nuttiness perfect for anytime of...well...anytime. This also goes great with a fine cigar(go figure) and a poker table rounded with the best of friends. I will recommend this to people who don't like the bitterness of really hoppy brews, but would like to drink something smooth and flavorful."
"Mouthfeel: This beer is a bit over light bodied but with fine, smooth carbonation. Pretty creamy. Overall, a great brown ale. One of the best that I've been able to try. I've been very impressed with the Cigar City offerings I've had."
"D – Stood up well to the spicy buffalo chicken salad, several would do"
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Nutmeg brown in color with amber hues on the edges of the glass. Good clarity. Poured with a decent off-white head that reduced to a wispy cap and decent lacings on the glass. Sweet roasted malt and floral hop aromas with a hint of nuts. The hop aroma is subdued enough to allow the roasted malt to shine through. Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Roasted malt and toffee flavors in the beginning. Floral hop bitterness shows through the middle along with a hint of lightly roasted coffee. Finishes with a bit of roasted malt flavor and a more pronounced bitter hop character. Nice flavor complexity for a usually predictable style."
"O - Really nice brown ale. Big flavors come in waves, sweet, then cocoa and coffee a bit more bitter, finishes with surprising citrus hops. Overall, one of my favorite browns."
"It was our annual trip to Tampa...the night before THE BUCKEYE CRUISE AGAINST CANCER!!!! The better half and I walked a couple of blocks down from our hotel and found a wonderful sport to taste numerous different brews. The first beer I tried, thank to the suggestion of our server...Maduro Oatmeal Brown...WOW. I am not a brown fan....but this was quite nice!! The color was a rich cloudy brown. Teh nose inclued a sweet chocolate, malt and coffee. This of course fed into the taste of the beer which was rich malty chocolate and caramel, with coffee undertones. I could drink this....wait for it....give it to me Lionel...ALL NIGHT LONG!!!!"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some malts are present. Taste is good, malty, slight bit of oats, some hops at the finish. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"Medium light on the palate and creamy smooth. Very good for the syle and much better than the Newcastle that I had last week."
"Roasty, nifty, with thick creamy bread character and oats throughout. Mollasses, walnut, hints of green apple and spicey earth hops. Lively carbonation with a bit of acidity on the finish. Slight sweetness."
"O: I really have liked the two Cigar City brews I have tried now (Jai Alai as well). Both are extremely well crafted and deep brews. You can tell they put a lot of time and effort into the brewing process. This is a very drinkable brown ale. Not my favorite style, but one that can be overlooked. I would definitely sample again if the time arose."
"a copper pour with a disappointingly small. But i think the bartender may have given me a hot glass. Consistent bubbles and mild lace. Nose of dextrin, chocolate... And palate carries with those with subtle hints of brown sugar, apples, and burnt malt. Woody astringent that has a nice walnut acidic bitter quality. Not particularly fruity but grain oriented."
"Overall: A very solid brown ale that can be sessioned nicely."
"had this with some buffalo wings. what a great combination. really helped to tone down the heat, and bring out more of the fried chicken flavor. this is a pretty awesome beer. re-affirms my love for brown ale."
"Overall: Its ok. Its not something I would go out of my way to buy again but overall its a decent brown ale. It might be hype because I have had 4 people tell me that I have to try this brewer and its amazingly good. So maybe my expectations were a bit high."
"Overall a pretty good beer but not as complex as I was hoping for."
"This beer pours a dark hazelnut/carmel brown in color with a light, off white foam that laces the glass. It smells of oak, brown sugar, tree bark, light chocolate, moist cigar wraps, and coffee. I dig it. I normally don't like brown ales but this one is spot on delicious. It tastes of dark malts, sweet and bitter chocolates, light roasted coffee, hazelnut, and oak. I'm in love with it really. The thing that may make it the most appealing is how drinkable it is. It's incredibly creamy and smooth for being a lighter bodied style. It goes down so easily and is pretty sessionable. I love it. This is an awesome year round offering from Cigar City!"
"Tasty brown. A bit mild for my tastes but a good beer with training wheels."
"O: Overall this is one hell of a brown. Not sure if the slight sourness is intentional, but I sure enjoyed it. But set a side the wildness, the flavors were all very balanced and well rounded around the edges."
"This is very drinkable and at 5.5% could be a good session beer."
"D - Drinkability is moderate. Easy to drink but to me, it's falls short of the mark. It's not as full-bodied or silky smooth as I would've expected an oatmeal-influenced to be. If Cigar City were in my market, I could see this as a cheap, occasional drinker, but I don't think I'd actively seek it out again."
"Overall, this is my favorite varietal I've had so far."
"O: I could make a night out with this beer having more than a couple. The ease of which it goes down pairs with the lighter 5.5% ABV to make a really drinkable beer."
"O, had to remember to rate this one in its style or I may have given it a 4 in taste resulting in a B+ overall. More complex than most brown ales I've tried to date. A great six pack to pick up... and quickly finish."
"Very well done for the style and probably my favorite brown ale to date."
"This is my first time tasting a CC beer and I enjoy it quite a bit."
"D: This brown ale strikes an appealing and interesting balance between sweet and dry. While not extreme, its flavor qualities are more assertive than the norm for the style, making this beer memorable. Its smell is more typical for the style, coming across as rather vacant. It is successful for keeping the interest of the drinker, while remaining true to style and leaving little fatigue on the palate."
"Nice dark brown, opaque almost black with a creamy off white head that leaves nice creamy walls of lace. The smell is of roasted and chocolate malts, biscuits, and some nutty, earthy characters. Taste is nutty, roasted malts, oatmeal, some spice, chocolate, caramels, and bready elements. Slight earth tones in the back with a bit of bitter cocoa and walnuts. Meduim body, smooth, and slightly creamy and very easy to drink. Complex flavors make for an enjoyable experience."
"O: A very good beer for its style that's solid in every aspect of the word. However, as I've said again and again in this review, nothing really stands out for me here. A great beer that's highly drinkable and/or sessionable but nothing I'd go out of my way to try. Interesting because this offering seems perfectly suited to take on the barrel characteristics of whatever it is aged in. A teaser, if you will, from CCB."
"Its a very well executed brown ale and I'd like to do a little taste test with this, Avery's Elies, & Smutty's brown dog. This one could very well be the best of the lot."
"Drinkability: An enjoyable and flavorful beer that I could easily have more of, Unfortunately, based on lack of distribution, that won't be happening."
"O: A great beer, glad I got to try it. One of the better Brown Ales I've had. Too bad Florida is so far away."
"Overall: Delicious ale even if it is almost more of an Oatmeal Stout than a Brown Ale."
"M - smooth; lightly carbonated."
"Pours a deep reddish brown with a foamy off-white head. Aroma is sweet roasted malts, sweet cherries, some tobacco, and very faint hops. Flavor follows the nose with a big malty, nutty backbone with a pleasant tobacco and earthy spiciness. Slightly astringent throughout, but it is more noticeable in the finish. Thinner mouthfeel with a prickly carbonation. Solid american brown ale."
"I hope the next bottle of this turns out better."
"Overall: Cigar City has two year round offerings, Maduro and Jai Alai. I much prefer Jai Alai, in fact it is one of my favorite IPAs, but Maduro does not leave me with the same feelings. It tastes very good, but none of the other factors are nearly as enjoyable. I would certainly drink another one but I would not go out of my way to seek it out."
"The mouthfeel is on the heavier side for the style, and carbonation is moderate. Overall it was decent despite of the fruity, tart, acidic flavors that are developing. They actually gave it some interesting flavors that complimented the malt at times. Not a bad beer overall, but one I'd like to revisit to see if there really is something going on with this one."
"D: A very good brown ale. Interesting and complex. Very nice."
"D: I guess it's good for the style but not my favourite."
"O: Solid beer, easy drinking with a good flavor."
"Pours a cola brown with light coming through on the edges. A very small quick fading tan head. Good looking pour. Aromas are dominated with roasted malts. Some fig and bread come through as well. Taste is decent. This isn't my favorite style but a good representation with a nice sweetness followed by the roasted malts. Pretty straight forward and good tasting. Mouthfeel is slightly watery and not much carbonation. Overall this is a decent brew that is quite sessionable."
"Notes: First taste from Cigar City and glad to have done so. This is not mind blowing but makes for a rather nice and tasty brown ale."
"This is an average brown that I wouldn't have again."
"D - This is a winner for me. Really enjoyed this one after drinking a Jai Alai IPA. The really contrast each other and are the best of both worlds."
"D: Can't taste the alcohol at all. A very pleasant drink, but I wouldn't want more than one or two at a time."
"Pours reddish brown with white head that clears away. Gingerbread, molasses, alcohol, slight roast, echoes of raspberry in the nose. Tastes of bread, cereal, brown sugar, cinnamon sticks, hops come through towards the finish. Medium-heavy body with medium carbonation. A malty, cinnamon cereal-minded brown ale that is a great session."
"D: This is a beer made for drinking after dinner with a cigar. Rich, roasty, and completely crushable. Great beer!"
"Future outlook: A solid brown, but not enough body to be really outstanding...thought the oats would make it special, but alas, no. Glad to have tried it, but not available around here, so not really a beer that has a future in my fridge."
"Drinkability is great, I didn't like the first one I had the other night, but now its pretty damn good."
"Well made, unremarkable, yet sessionable example of the style."
"D - Not my favorite style, but if you like brown ales this could be the beer for you. Another solid beer from cigar city."
"D - This is one of the best browns I've had to date...I loved the Cubano Espresso version and now having the base I can see why...it would be easy to drink a few of these"
"the CPJ"
"Overall a solid brown ale. I will need to trade for some of the other versions of it now."
"D_This is a well made beer and very nice on cask. Very drinkable and the % could creep up on you."
"All in all, this was one of the few middle of the road brews I've had from CCB. Most have been either excellent or complete letdowns with an emphasis on the excellent side. I'd say don't worry about this one. Maybe if you are a fan of CCB brews, then try, but it will not blow your mind."
"D: Goes down easy and the glass was gone before I knew it. Overall, the Maduro Brown is a superb example of a well crafted brown ale in my opinion which strikes just the right balance between robust flavor and exceptional ease of drinking."
"Nice, well crafted brew. Looking for an American Brown, give this a try."
"Pouring this beer causes a small head to form with a white color. Very slight aroma of tobacco and beer. Dark brown murky color. A light drinking beer with a tingly effervescene in the mouth. The beer's flavor is not bitter but tastes like toasted whole wheat bread. The toasty taste is evident hours after drinking."
"While I could stomach the flavors, the mouthfeel was alright. Thin (as an infection would make it) and somehow flat, I was unimpressed. This ended up getting drain poured. Just absolutely awful. I am really disappointed that I won't be able to drink the last one, since it was really pretty nice when it was fresher."
"Drink is great, smooth and slightly creamy, sessionable, nice dark brown malts balanced well with a slight earthy hop character and touch of bitterness, and a bit dry on the finish. The only negative is a slight sticky feel on the finish, but its not enough to really take away from it."
"Enjoyed this stellar beer at a conference in Ft Myers and later in the week at a cigar bar in Key West. Rich brown color with a wonderful mouthfeel and a long finish. There was a nice undertone of smokiness in this ale that made it perfect with a cigar. The only bad thing I have to say is that I am disappointed to not be able to get it in Pittsburgh."
"Thanks to Thirstybird for sharing. Pours a brownish-mahogany with a slightly hazy clarity. A quarter inch, cream-colored, bubbly head disperses into a thin skim and a sudsy mass. Nose is malty, spicy and slightly medicinal - there's also perhaps a trace of burnt sugar and anise. Taste expresses dried dark fruit (figs/prunes), oatmeal cookie and anise. Mouthfeel is medium-light with an even carbonation that falls just short of crisp and a slightly dry finish. All and all, a decent, nuanced brown with quite a bit of flavor, particularly given the relatively low abv."
"D- Very drinkable and a nice brew. My first from CC, and it didn't disappoint. Pleasant enough to be a great all-round brew."
"Pours a dark brown with a light brown head. A little lacking for the style. Roasted coffee in the nose. Also hints of chocolate. Big roasted flavor. The coffee stands out. A little chocolate sweetness, a hint of nuttiness and oats round out the flavor. This was is all about the roastyness, but a very flavorful brown ale."
"Drinkability is great. Too bad this is a one time thing."
"I like this one a lot. I think it is the best beer that I have tried from Cigar City at this point."
"Mouthfeel is medium with some slickness from the oats. Carbonation is medium low. Drinkability is decent but the fullness prevents it from being higher. Overall a great coffee forward brown ale."
"This is an excellent brown ale with an incredibly creamy feel. It's a slightly reddish shade of brown with a creamy light tan head. The liquid appears thick and murky. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and creamy. For a 5.5% abv beer, Maduro has a very rich, full feel. The aroma is maple syrup, walnuts, earth, caramel and a hint of lime. The beer is relatively sweet with a lightly bitter roast finish. This seems a bit like a cross between a brown ale and a porter with that roasty note, but it's a delicious beer and a pleasure to drink."
"Very drinkable."
"Pretty solid good brew all around."
"D - I could drink these with ease but there are better session beers out there."
"D: A really nice representation of the style, solid and drinkable, but not a wavemaker."
"Excellent after the park drink I must say."
"D: I enjoy this style and this is not good. I have been both wowed and disappointed by CCB...I am disappointed again. To be honest, couldn't even finish the 12 oz. You need a good cigar with this one...to overpower it and make it palatable."
"Drink this beer. On tap, bottle, growler, whatever. Its worth it. This beer is amazing."
"Smooth on the tongue. Full bodied but not heavy. One of the better regular strength beers I've had in a while."
"Beautiful beer, witha light tan head that pops up and sticks. Smells of chocalte and sweet brown malts. Taste is sweet with just a tiny bit of balancing bitter. Would like a little more bitterness. Overall very enjoyable!"
"Overall this is the best sessionable brown ale on the planet in my opinion. Definitely highly recommended and worth seeking out."
"Admittedly, I'm not much of a Brown Ale guy. I've enjoyed more Brown Ales in the past six months than I ever have, so perhaps I'm coming around on the style (or, more likely, the Brown Ales from Terrapin, Good People, Sierra Nevada and Surly are just way better than the average beer of the style). Add this offering from Cigar City to that list. Unique, tasty; Cigar City is impressing me so far."
"The mouthfeel does feel a little thin for the taste - that's probably what separates it from a porter, however. The slightly thinner taste also works well for Cigar City's gimmick of adding extra things to this formula. It's incredibly drinkable for the amount of flavor packed in here. It's just a great beer by a great brewery, and highly recommended."
"I will pick this up again as it is a solid beer that I see going very well with some food."
"D: This is a beer that would break people who are guinness only drinkers.. Malty, and a little dry, wonderful flavor, and easy drinking."
"This is my first Cigar city and I can see why they are such a great brewery. I cant wait to try more."
"M - Light bodied, medium carbonation."
"d - An easy drinking, pretty good brown ale. I enjoyed the smell a lot and it had a nice feel to it. Would have again."
"4.0 D: I do like me some brown ales and this was a good one. I'd have this again anytime...maybe next time with a nice cigar!"
"D- Not my favorite, but definitely a solid offering. Clean and easy drinking, no complaints for the most part."
"D: a well balanced, relaxed beer, keeping with the style it is not overwhelming, just a smooth drinkable beer"
"only for balance. The hop bitterness is mild at best. The mouthfeel is great. It's a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. The oatmeal adds a bit of depth here. This is a good drinking brown ale. I'm a sucker for that roasted malt flavor as well as a nice oatmeal mouthfeel."
"This is a better than average brown, especially for the ABV."
"Drinkability (4.5): Some pretty strong flavors here despite the low ABV. Very smooth and drinkable though. I wouldn't drink this all night, but only because I don't normally session Browns."
"D - Not at all what I was expecting, although it is a well-executed beer. This is a pretty nice Flemish-style brown, but why has every other reviewer treated it as an American brown with no mention of funk? I have checked and rechecked the label and this is not a special bottling. The label matches the photo above perfectly. Either I'm crazy, or they've significantly changed the recipe, or this bottle has magically been funked in a very drinkable way."
"Very pleasant beer. Nothing earth shattering, just a well made beer that is fun to drink."
"D - Hell yes. I loved this beer."
"Overall I love this beer. One of the best brown ales I've ever had. I will certainly be seeking it out again. Thanks again Scotty!"
"Overall: OK, I was seriously taken off guard by this one. I spotted a Brooklyn Brown, which I enjoy but which has become oddly hard to find in my neck of the woods. Maduro is NOTHING like Brooklyn Brown or a ""traditional"" brown (much less English). It's closer to Dogfish Head's Palo Santo Marron take on the ""American"" brown, except sans the 12% ABV. Delicious, drinkable, and at the 8.99/sixer price I found it at, a definite new go-to brew for me."
"d - great beer and maybe the best brown i've ever had."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a sa perfect pint glass. The pour is deep amber with reddish highlights. The aroma is sweet and bready. The flavor is bready with a decent amount of caramel and enough hops for balance. It has a clean finish. The body is light/medium and well carbonated. A nice sessionable brew from CCB."
"Pours a nice golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy light tan head, which does leave some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, sweet, with lots of caramel. The taste is sweet, malty, lots of caramel. Medium body. Very Drinkable, this is a very fine ABA. Thanks Pete."
"Drinkability- the finish of this beer makes you thirsty for more!"
"Pours a really dark brown color....almost black, but not quite... smell is OK. some chocolate and toasted malt. tastes like a good brown ale. malty, toasted, smooth. delightful flavor profile with a medium body. mouthfeel is medium-thin....Drinkibility is OK....but i'm not a huge fan of brown ales....however this one is pretty good, i'd drink it again."
"T: perfectly balanced with a hint of citrus fruit and chocolatey malt sweetness. Slighty bready, wh"
"Medium/full body with a light effervescence. A nicely balanced dark chocolate / roasted malt aftertaste lingers for a long time without being annoying or displaying any harshness. A really well-rounded brew. No wonder they use it as the base for so many others."
"Overall, this is a pretty good beer. I'm generally not a big fan of brown ales, as I feel they are just manufactured to be pretty average. Maduro, in kind, is a pretty average beer but probably an above average brown ale and definitely unique for its type."
"The beer is medium bodied, well carbonated and has a nice juicy hoppy aftertaste given how malty and sweet the beer tasted. This is an average brown ale, certainly not bad, but I was really looking forward to the oatmeal addition and what I perceived that would add to the style."
"D-I have a feeling this is a bad bottle, judging by the other reviews here."
"With a name like maduro, I was expecting dark rich chocolate and coffee notes like that of a maduro cigar. Its a tad gimmicky that it doesn't really have much of that in it at all. In fine cigars, maduro typically indicates a stronger flavor too."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable. Not something I'd usually drink and found myself wanting more. Would go great with a light dessert."
"A very drinkable brown but not exceptionally noteworthy."
"Medium bodied with a light level of carbonation. This is quite a smooth, drinkable brown with a broad array of flavors. A little more bitter than your typical example of the style but I'm not complaining."
"Lots of taste from this brown ale. Got notes of cinnamon,coffee, molasses, in nose. Taste follows nose, bring out the cinnamon, coffe and molasses. In the finish, a hint of bubblegum pops up "
"D: Highly drinkable, sessionable brown solid ale. Another great creation from the good folks at CCB."
"3.5/4.5/4.0/4.0/4.5"
"drinkable - yep. very."
"D: Highly drinkable for sure, however, this was sort of a let-down. I could have used some smokiness to the flavor just to add some pizzazz. Still, this was solid."
"D= Very low ABV very drinkable not my favorite by Cigar City but a very decent brown ale."
"My God I thought I was in a cigar shop, not picking this brew but picking which edition of this particular brew it is to review on this site! I'm sure that there are as many brews to pick as cigars in the Cigar City but best I can do is read the bottle and then guess. Anyways this is a raved Cigar City that I spotted, so lets give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a great waft of roasted malts and chocolate and.... No I'm done.... I have had it before and sipped it, now as I rate it, for a brown ale, who beats it?"
"Overall: This is an excellent American Brown Ale. I'm yet to be disappointed with Cigar City. This is one of the best brown ales I've had. It's typically not one of my favorite styles, but I'll be buying more of this soon."
"Enjoyable brown for sure, more on the full body and coffee related style."
"D: easy drinking, very drinkable and, although a bit higher for the style, could easily be a session beer"
"Beer is medium in body and completely fills the palate. The flavors are strong and forward. Nutty, smoky (but not like a rauch), very flavorful tobacco. Beer has a nice mildly bitter but not distracting finish, very drinkable. I would have more of this for sure."
"Glad I got to try this one and am already looking forward to my next one - easily one of the best brown ales I've had."
"Pours deep brown with a sticky off white head. The aroma is earthy and spicy with a lot of cinnamon. The flavor is rich and complex, earthy and spicy and herbal, with cinnamon and sage and rosemary and wood. There's even some lovely gingerbread. The mouthfeel is prickly with a rich malt burn down the throat."
"An excellent brew by the guys in Tampa. Start to finish this beer is a treat. Even with a gentle pour it has a slowly building light brown head. Medium carbonation with excellent mouthfeel. Aroma is of caramel, coffee and malt with a slight earthy/floral background. Taste is very malty, bready with a strong hint of coffee. This beer has a fair amount of alcohol flavor and effect for a 5.5 ABV brew, it warms the throat and chest better than many of the so called winter warmers I've tried. Color is a very dark brown with a tint of amber. Any darker and maltier this could be classified as a stout or porter. This beer is also very affordable, as far as craft beers go. All around a very nice beer."
"Pours a coppery brown color with cap of khaki colored head. Scent has a slight charachter of spicy rye before the carmel malts and earthy hops come through. Taste begins with an earthy, muddy flavor, again note of spicy rye, the carmel malts are nice and bready and not too sweet. Fuller side of medium bodied, nice creamy mouthfeel with some eathyness to it. A ver nicely done American brown."
"D: No doubt -this is the best brown ale I've ever had. Great brew from CC"
"Well done. Perhaps the best and most complex brown ale I have had in five years+."
"D-well it does go down easily and its not a pain to drink but i'm not going to be ordering another one any time soon"
"d: overall a really nice beer. I think I chose a sub-par bottle because I have had this brew before and was really wowed by it. But, either way it still has a really nice drinkability."
"[D] This beer is the definition of drinkability in the ABA category. Not sugary, nor hoppy. Not boring. Not boozy. Not a palate killer. Not filling. Easy going, and flavorful enough to keep you interested in the nuances over a few bottles. Not sure how this is packaged, but a 6 pack + wouldn't be out of the question. In the same market, this would probably be up there with BBB."
"Drinkability - Tastiness keeps it going down! 4.5/5"
"Another score from Cigar City."
"Drinkability: This is a very easy drinking beer -- nice smells and flavors and a body that isn't really going to weigh anyone down; a very moderate ABV of 5.5% makes it easy to get through as well; not something that I think I'd want on a warm day, but flavors are fitting for cooler weather."
"drinkability: good"
"The mouthfeel has a nice thickness to it, it's also a bit silky but ever so slightly watery, and I'm nitpicking overall, well done and highly drinkable."
"M/D - nice and thick and rich and filling. cooling with a touch or bitterness. perhaps a little too filling. the oatmeal really helps out the flavor, but makes it a bit thick to have as a session beer."
"Very light and crisp, with light carbonation and a champagne-like mouthfeel that is smooth and creamy. Will seek this out again as there is no hint of the alcohol and the flavor gets better as it warms. A very good beer!"
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly."
"D- this shit is the bomb. Paired amazingly with the city's best char board in my opinion. Low abv and chock a block with layer upon layer of flavor. Well done cc."
"Drinkability: One of the most leathery and earthy brews I have had in some time. Different from others I have had in this style. I could do two or three max. A good, not excellent beer that makes me want to try more from this brewery."
"This is not a classic brown ale...which means I like it. Great flavor and not overly roasted on the malt. I wonder if it's the oatmeal that chills it out a bit without sacrificing color or flavor. Unfortunate about the infection though. Mouthfeel score suffers because of it. Oh well, what can you do? (CCB, send me another bottle please?)"
"Drinkability -- Solid. Robust and quite drinkable. A must-try if you love the style."
"D - very drinkable and at 5.5% abv, a few would be easy to do."
"Picked this up from Abe's Cold Beer. Quite an interesting brown ale, very unique. There's a fantastic spicy, toasty cocoa, hazelnut character. The oats seem to really amp things up, like with a strong roasted taste on an oatmeal stout. I strongly urge you to check this beer out"
"Drinkability: This one is very drinkable indeed. I finished it easily and could quite easily have had a second with no trouble. I will definitely return to this brown ale. It demonstrates the complexity which the style is capable of in ways that few others manage."
"Cigar City, you are in the winners seat."
"Overall, this is a delicious brown ale - easily one of the best everyday ones which I've tried."
"Another good offering from the fine folks at CCB."
"Maduro pours an intensely cloudy deep brown. There's just a faint hint of lighter brown highlights tracing the edge of the glass. To say the light tan colored cap is able to gather itself to two fingers in height would be stretching the truth, and there's barely any lacing left behind to speak of. Nose is solid, predominantly , with some nuttiness showing up as well and a hint of fruity esters. Those esters get lost on my palate though, and I can't find much of anything in the flavor outside the one two punch of biscuits and toasted nuts. It's not bad, but I find myself wishing there was just a little more to it (especially after finding some fruits in the aroma). Body is appropriately mild for a brown ale of this size, with that added bit of smoothness I expect to find in a beer that features oats. The understated carbonation plays up to that as well, resulting in a pretty silky mouthfeel. Maduro is a solidly executed beer, and one I definitely wouldn't mind drinking in the future, but it doesn't make me feel the need to seek it out again."
"A rather extravagant brown ale."
" This brown tastes good w/ very flavorful malt and roasted which leads to a sweet caramel malt middle. The light woody and nutty elements are nice for contrast w/ a slight toasted taste and semi dry herbal essence. The taste has very creamy roundness and a slight hint of tobacco too or am I imagining it?, The woodiness of the hops and dark malt may just add that to the flavor. The beer is pretty impressive with substantial drinkability and for a 5.5% beer seems pretty full with smoothness from oatmeal and yet a nice clean yeast taste."
"Drink well my friends."
"Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured hazy red-brown with a one finger off white to light tan head. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, slight sweet malt, oatmeal, and caramel. The flavor was of roasted malt, oatmeal, slight caramel, and a very light nutty note. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a nice brew without a doubt. To be honest there isn't really a whole lot missing on this one. Had a decent aroma and a very nicely balanced and tasty flavor. This one is a definite must try given the chance."
"Very enjoyable; would definitely recommend to lovers of brown ales. This one is top notch."
"D- I really think that this is the best brown ale I have had to date. Looks great, smells great, taste & feels delicious. I could easily drink several of these (I haven't yet). I feel that this style is a classic style, but I never get really ""wowed"" by any. This one does."
"On a side note, BA has this listed as an oatmeal brown ale, when the label explicitly states that it is an all malt ale. The word oatmeal doesn't make any appearance on the label. Where did this come from?"
"Maduro reminded me a lot of New Holland Cabin Fever - one of my all time favorite browns. A++ will drink again."
"Overall good, flavorful. Nicely balanced, an easy drinker."
"So yeah, this bottle did have some carbonation issues. Not to say it didn't have carbonation... it just needed more. The looks and mouthfeel definitely suffered. Howeer, the rest was quite enjoyable. I'd love to see an imperial version of this, because I think it might go nicely with a cigar."
"We just got Cigar City at my store and I have heard lots of good things about this one. Pours a dark chocolate brown with a massive tan head that sits on top of the beer like a crown. Smell is rich and inviting with hints of dark chocolate and hazelnut. The taste is divine with a silky smooth almost zero carbonation flavor blast. This is more of a porter than a nut brown. Layers and layers of velvety malt wash over the tonuge. What a brew!"
"D - Good overall, but I like brown ales to be much smoother across the palate. Nothing about the Maduro really stands to me."
"12oz bottle into a DFH Signature glass pours a deep, crisp brown with a thin, quickly diminishing off white head. Aroma is a nice amount of dark malts, bitter cocoa, brown sugar and burnt caramel, quite fragrant! The taste is a nice smooth blend of burnt toast, caramel, cocoa and leather. The beer is quite light and crisp, with smooth but mild carbonation. I must say, this is quite possibly one of the best brown ales I've ever had!"
"D: Pretty damn drinkable. The oats don't add too much to the body so it still remains a brown ale."
"Drinkability: A very smooth and tasty beer. I've had this on draft before and often over look it. Since it's now available in 6 packs, I see myself buying this on a more regular basis."
"Plenty of nuttiness and very subtly roasted malt in the nose. Some more toastier notes in the taste, some more darker malt flavor with a very slight bitter edginess balancing with malty, tiny cocoa powderish sweetness, seems like it lost a bit of carb from the growler but still a huge creamy milky mouthfeel for a beer of this abv. Nice beer with some solid flavors but drinks a bit heavier than it should. Filling."
"Very drinkable. The bitter smoky finish adds an intriguing quality to this brown. I was surprised to find this brew in a attractively priced six-pack. I will be keep in these in the fridge for as long as they are available."
"D- Despite the average marks, sessionability is high if I'm not in a gourmet mood."
"Overall, I first tried this brew about a month ago at a brewfest. Maduro is tied with Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale as my absolute favorite brown. Seriously, this brew almost takes the cake."
"Pours a hazy reddish dark brown with a dense two fingers of cream colored foam, fades to a thin layer leaving blobs of lace behind. Smell: mild roast, nutty, bakers chocolate, hopping is earthy and orange citrus. Taste: high cocoa chocolate with nuts, fades to toffee and mild roast, earthy, big oat presence in the finish. Medium bodied, drying finish with a bonus oatmeally coating. CCB held back on the abv for once but not on the big flavors."
"Taste very similar to the aroma, Coffee flavors off the bat mixed with brown roasted malts, some light caramel and a bit of dry burnt oatmeal flavor. This is a very good brown, the oatmeal lends a porter esque quality that I like and I usually do not like oatmeal porters. Nice and smooth, easy to drink and light carbonation. This is a great beer at 5.5% with a medium to light mouthfeel and I would drink it regularly if I could get it in bottles. Very fresh tasting as well out of the growler, looking forward to more brown ales soon with the fall upon us."
"The flavor is much bolder than the smell. The body is smooth and soft with a sweet and toasty malt blend of multigrain bread and chocolate. Something like a mild jam flavor comes in towards the end as well. Over all this is a very tasty and drinkable brown ale that only benefits from its oatmeal IMO. The oatmeal and malt linger on the tongue. I wish this was kegged and more available in GA."
"Medium-high carbonation and a very nice and enjoyable drinkability. If it became more available in Jacksonville, would become a nice standard for a sessionable."
"An excellent brown ale, unique in character with it's deep roasty character."
"A good brown ale from CCB. I could see how this could be a good base for many of their more complex Maduro's, but this one is a little basic. A decent beer, but not something I'd seek out necessarily."
"D: A great brown ale. Not as wonderful as their Cubano Espresso Maduro Oatmeal Brown, but still great. So glad this is in bottles now."
"Overall, this is one of the better brown ales I have had. It does not lack in flavor, and was clean as a whistle."
"Growler from Decicco's in Ardsley, NY. Pours quite dark brown, cant see through it, medium mocha head, goes to a tiny bubble film , collar and ample larger bits of lace. Complex nose featuring some smoke, chocolate, and roasted malts. Full flavor brown, flavors mimic the nose, nice and roasty, with plenty of chocolate and nutty goodness. Super smooth on the tongue. High quality brown, fresh tasting and well worth trying. More quality brew from CCB, keep em' coming to the NY area!"
"Cheers.."
"I'm not a huge brown ale fan, but this was quite nice. Pours a nice dark brown with a thin head that settles to a ring. Smells of tobacco and earth, and roasted peppers. These aromas work unusually well with the dry maltiness of a brown ale. More earthy and tobacco notes in the taste, but here they are mild and combine with a creaminess that tempers everything and provides some balance. A bit light in the mouth, but the lively flavors compensate for this. Quite interesting and nicely drinkable. A great brewery!"
"Growler. Courtesy of McDiddyPop on BA. Pours a nice brown color with the slightest tinge of red to it. Great foamy tan head. The aroma is great with notes of dark malt, subtle sweetness, cocoa, and some nutty smell I can't put my finger on. The taste follows the aroma as in the first flavor is the roasted malt balanced with some sweetness. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium."
"D-good flavors that work well together, soft feel, a little thin. decent beer."
"Pours a clear, dark amber brown with a large frothy tan head that has weak retention and leaves a few streaks of dry lacing. Aroma is dominated by dry oatty and nutty notes with very little sweetness or malt presence. Flavor is a slightly more interesting blend of a rich caramel malty body with strong smooth nuttiness. Mouthfeel is very thick, smooth and chewy like an oatmeal stout with strong, fine carbonation. Finish is dry and oatty with a slight bittersweet pinch. A nice brown but nothing exceptional."
"D - rich and flaovr kind of sweet but a very good drinkable beer"
"A great American brown ale, a pleasure to drink."
"best american brown i've ever had, it's worth seeking out for sure. flavorful, sessionable, overall a joy to drink."
"T- It's very carbonated and has a very nice sourish aftertaste. Bubbly and nutty. I would say that this is a prototype oatmeal ale."
"Great brew. But, boys, you must change some things about that website. Like, all of it."
"At Tria in Philadelphia. Poured reddish brown into a pint glass, with one finger of beige head, and good lacing. Very sweet sugary aroma, not allowing me to discern much individually; simply very sweet brown sugar. Luckily the flavor was more robust and varied, with brown sugar, cinnamon, dark chocolate, and roast malt all coming through. Thick, non-carbonated mouthfeel, with only a slight hint of spritz. A little too thick to session, but a tasty brown ale nonetheless."
"D - Wow! I could drink this all day every day! One of the smoothest beers I've ever had, my growler went way too fast. Easily the best Brown Ale I've ever had, great job Cigar City!"
"D - This has an amazing drinkability to it...goes down so easily. The smooth and silky feel, creamy carbonation and rich malty flavors really set this brown ale apart from the masses. Definitely one of the best I've had. Good thing this growler is only 32oz...I think it might be difficult not to put down a lot more of this one."
"Awesome job Cigar City!!!"
"D- very enjoyable brown ale. The oatmeal adds a real nice depth to it that I've never really gotten off of a brown ale. I want more, dammit."
"The only ABA I've had that compares to this is Bender, which I think is very similar. Very well done, CCB!"
"O: One of the best brown ales I've ever had. Great mouthfeel, creamy and smooth, the roasted malt character on this beer is definitely a bench mark for others to shoot for."
"I hadn't heard of Tampa's Cigar City Beer before I tasted this pint. I can't understand why. This brown ale pours a dark mahogany, nearly opaque, with a thick tan head. It smells of bread and cocoa, and tastes like oats, vanilla, and rich roasty malt. Earthy and surprisingly rich, and very drinkable."
"O A very good Brown. Brown ale is not my personal favorite, but I could drink several of these. Quite good, definitely recommend. "
"Pours a deep brown color, with hints of ruby and a nice firm white head. Aromas of cocoa powder, roasted nuts and caramel malt. Flavors of dark chocolate, caramel, toffee and nuts. Had quite a bit of this one late last year, and after hearing so much about Cigar City, found myself less than impressed. A good solid brown ale, but nothing more."
"D: A very nice brown ale, and something I'd love to have regular access to."
"D- American Brown Ales are not my first choice but I wanted to give this a shot being a local brew. I realize this is not a typical American Brown Ale but I really enjoyed it!"
"D: Extremely drinkable. Very easy to like."
"Smoothness made for great drinkability."
"The taste is of nutty dark chocolate, almond, subtle roast, just enough to be a nuance and not the main event. As it warms caramel and earthy hops interact. The finish isn't sweet, but has sort of a nutty mocha cheesecake fade. It's hearty, rich, and probably the most satisying brown ale I've had in my four years or so of beer exploration. Well done. A brown ale to drink or contemplate. Would try it again in a heartbeat."
"D- really good I could drink a lot. However, I prefer the espresso maduro."
"As a fan of the brown ales, I really liked this take on the style. Pretty robust relative to its peers, as is to be expected from Cigar City. Hopefully this will be bottled at some point."
"D: I'd be interested to try some more variations on this one. Right now it's not quite doing it for me, but I can see how it would be a good base. I'd give it another try if I were in a brown mood, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"Once again not the first time having this beer, but first time having it to review. This is Cerveza Chica's favorite Brown Ale, and I can see where she is coming from. This is a very drinkable brown, that is smooth and light bodied. It has a bit of a nutty taste to it, but nothing over powering to it. I personally had a hint of alcohol burn at the very end of the taste, but nothing that was crazy. I personally can not wait to try the Vanilla Maduro which I was able to snag a growler of. Overall solid beer!"
"A bit boring but a good base for ""special treatments"""
"A beautiful brown ale that makes a good session beer with its low ABV"
"On tap at Cigar City takes NYC event at Rattle 'N' Hum. Very dark brown,with whisp of head. only average mouthfeel is felt, maybe it is a tad over. Suitably carbonated. Cedar there too. A little toast,and chocolate malts. Good for its style, but of curse CC blows you away with their unique brews."
"A definite benchmark for the style."
"Dark, yet transparent brown with a very nice slightly tan head that has good staying power and sticky lacing. Wonderful aroma that is slightly roasty and nutty. Quite sweet with brown sugar, caramel, toffee and fresh baked cookie notes. The roasted nuttiness is a bit more evident in the taste. The roastyness is the first thing that is hitting my tongue, though it quickly subsides and the sweet toffee and brown sugar notes mingle together with a little bit of herbal hop character and a touch of smokiness. This beer is on the heavier side of medium bodied with a nice smooth (no doubt the oats) finish that is drier than I expected. I am not generally a huge brown ale fan, but this is delicious and very drinkable. I bought the growler on a whim and it turned out quite well."
"D - I can always drink it, but I never prefer to. I have seldom filled my growler with it. It isn't bad, but Cigar City does so many other things that I am more into."
"d: easy to drink these easy a session beer low alcohol wise"
"D: Great. Brown ales don't tend to be my style, but I could see myself having a few of these when I'm not jonsing for the hops. There is a bit of acridity in the finish that keeps this from being perfect."
"D - Easily one of the best brown ales I've had to date. Cigar City has burst on the scene and has been mixing things up quite and bit, which is always a pleasure to see. Great stuff!"
"Draft at Mellow Mushroom - Brandon. Poured a clear dark brown color with an aqverage creamy off-white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate toasted malt, nuts and hop aroma. Medium body with a smooth slick texture and soft carbonation. Solid balanced toasted oats sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Good complex brew"
"Overall this is a very sessionable beer that is a nice take on the American Brown Ale. My first Cigar City beer and certainly a brewery I look forward to sampling in the future. Recommended."
"Drinkability: I would definitely have this again and recommend this to someone who enjoys a solid brown ale with hints of caramel in the middle."
"D - Enjoyable sip after sip... Quite quaffable... Sessionable given it's 5.5% ABV... A terrific all around Brown Ale that I would welcome the oppurtunity to drink again in the future..."
"Maduro Oatmeal Brown Ale was served to me in a Cigar City snifter and appeared brown with a tan head. The aroma is nice, mostly malty. The flavor is quite nice, this is one of the better brown ales that I can recall having, malt is up front with chocolate and coffee notes. There are enough hops to balance this nicely, but they don't assert themselves too much. Quite nice, recommended."
"D: easy to drink, smooth, nice hop bite. I had a few more."
"D: Maduro is a decent brown ale, one that I'd try again without hesitation. It wasn't, though, mind-blowing in any way."
"Overall this remains one of the better brown ales I remember having. Well worth a shot if you can get your hands on it."
"d: Really a nice brown overall. I emptied my glass pretty quickly."
"Mouthfeel is pretty rich, with an overall smoothness that helps this be an incredibly drinkable and enjoyable Brown Ale."
"Really great stuff, and one of the more interesting in the style range that I've sample."
"Drinkability: Now here is a brown that has tremendous character and balance; first class"
"Kick this 1 up a notch and it'll be phenomenal."
"A very nice interpretation of a traditional American Brown Ale. The Oatmeal flavor add sa bit of chewiness to it and gives the beer a nice stick to the ribs type taste. I found it a plesant beer to sip on a cool fall evening. It is filling but not in a bloating type way. An enjoyable experience."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, mildly tart finish."
"D-Wow...full and rich, yet so smooth. This one goes down WAY too easy. Very tasty for ""just a brown ale"". Nicely done."
"Pours a nice chocolate brown color with some honey highlights, tight tan head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is of a light roasted malt; charred wet wood, smoke, and roastd meat. The aroma is not strong but is very nice. Wow, big big roasted chestnut flavor with a toasted malt backbone. Some nice tobacco flavor as well. Damn, this is like NYC during the winter with the roasted chestnut vendors. There is a nice toasted malt, brown sugar, light honey, grape, lemon and metal; basically a good base for the chestnut flavors. A moderate body with fizzy carbonation, this is coupled with a tobacco like malt which adds a nice earthy quality. This is one tasty ass brown ale. Cigar City makes a mean brown ale. This is a hearty brown ale that won't back down."
"Pours a rather chalky brown with a high tan head that fades quickly, leaving a cap. The smell is black tea leaves, persimmon, some malt, dead leaves. The taste is brown sugar, roasted grains, maybe some dark grapes, a long bitter finish -- all in all, very robust and complex. It's highly carbonated, coats the mouth nicely, very pleasant on the tongue. I couldn't drink this quickly, but it'd be easy to drink a lot of it. Very nice."
"D - Fairly high for the style."
"Overall a very tasty brown ale."
"D - Very easy to drink."
"I have consumed multiple pints of this brew in a sitting. Very nice, my favorite from the staple offerings of Cigar City."
"D - A very nice and unusually toasty brown ale. The malt is rich and the roasted notes add a lot of interest. It finishes quite dry and this helps highlight the darker malt character without ever becoming astringent."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. nice depth. if this were local i could easily drink it all the time."
"Very easy to drink."
"Drinkability- I had no problem putting down this growler as the drinkability of this beer if literally off the charts. The beer isn't a flavor bomb so you can drink and drink and drink and drink and just enjoy the shit out of it. Can't wait to try more beers from this brewery as this is a terrific start."
"drinkability: I could have a nice session with these and it would pair well with food/dinner"
"Reviewed on 06/05/2009. Sample from a growler at PPRBSG09. Pours brown with a small head. Aroma of roasted malt and sweet malt. Flavor of light coffee, roasted malt, with a sweet finish. Actually it's a pretty decent brown ale but overall not anything special."
"D and overall impression: Drinkability is again just superb, with the ABV at 5.5%, I have no problem finishing the 32 oz. growler, and will probably want more. I like the Espresso aged better, but this regular Maduro, IMHO, is better than both the vanilla and coaco versions. Does CCB make a bad beer?? Skal!"
"Pours a clear dark orange/brown, some reddish hints, thin light tan head forms, settles down to a thick ring, good lacing, looks nice. Smell is good, sweet and nutty, some caramel, big biscuity malt profile, brown sugar, light raisin, earthy, touch of roast and lightly fruity. Taste is similar, fruit at first, caramel and honey sweetness, nuts, light grapefruit hoppiness, touch of tropical fruit, earthy, very malty. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, super smooth and drinkable. This is a pretty good brown ale, very malty and enjoyable. Thanks Russ!"
"Oh, yeah, very nice. Well-rounded taste. A bit sweet up front that moves into some balancing bitterness and then ends with a coffee-like finish. I don't think I'd want to mess with this flavor. If all American Browns were this flavorful and well rounded it would be a more popular style. Really nice full mouthfeel on this one, too. This is a solid beer and well worth trying out."
"Highly recommended"
"This beer came as an extra from mcdiddypop, thanks for the chance to try this one. By the way, this mini growler might be the coolest looking bottle of beer I have run in to in quite a long time. Anyway, a rigorous pour produces a lovely dark rosewood colored beer, with large, ample white heading. It almost looked black when I poured, but was proven wrong when placing it under the light. Smell is light and delicate, but opens op more as it warms. Chocolate, caramel, smoke, wood, coffee and oatmeal all end up on the table. Taste has exactly the same elements, with the oatmeal and wood characters coming through the most. The mouthfeel is truly extraordinary. The dark malts along with the oatmeal characters meld perfectly. Hop presence is barely there, but that did not bother me. This is about as smooth a beer as you are going to get. I recommend sipping this one, but I must admit that it is a challenge considering how damn good it is. Right here is another reason why Cigar City are slowly but surely becoming my new favorite brewery. Seriously, get some of their offerings. It is one decision I promise you will not regret. Cheers"
"Overall blown away would not be a fair description, more like simply mind numbingly good. I cannot wait to dive into the rest of the lineup!"
"I had this while in Tampa, but also brought back a growler. I am forced due to work to stay in, but this growler must be drank, so I am going to do it! Pours a deep dark brown with a thin tan head. A lovely aroma of caramel malt, with hints of chocolate, and nice splash of hops. CCB does an excellent job combining a number of aromas and tastes in their beers, this is no exception. A blend of that sweet malt, both caramel and chocolate comes through in the taste, and just enough hop bitterness at the end to balance the flavor. A much fuller body than many brown ales, in fact, I have not been a big brown ale fan, but this brings a lot more to the table. A bit dense, which I like, but a very enjoyable beer. I wonder if I will ever not like a CCB brew..."
"Had this on tap at Vine and Barley in Port St. Lucie. Dark brown with a nice fluffy head that leaves little lace on the glass. Smell is roasted nuts with hints of vanilla and also a bit of oak. This has a bit of hop bitterness with a creamy smooth taste to it. Overall this is a fine offering and one of the best browns that I have enjoyed."
"This is one of the biggest brown ales I've tasted and the flavor profile is very robust compared to others in the style. I really liked this one."
"On-tap at Underground Bluz in Orlando. Pours a dark brown color with a thin light tan color head. The aroma is sweet malt and hints of chocolate and a touch of hops. The taste starts of very smooth and malty with a good dose of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, the oatmeal helps smooth this one out. Overall, a very tasty Brown that I would definitely purchase again. Great stuff!"
"Pours a clear but fairly dark ruby hued brown. Thin yellowish tan head. Flavor is slightly sweet and slightly earthy with chalky cocoa tones. It's nutty and earthy. Feel has a decent carbonation and fairly thicker bodied liquid. I wouldn't call this the most interesting brown ale ever, but it still is pretty nice."
"great beer for my first cigar city beer. easy drinking but very complex."
"Overall, the beer goes down like how I would expect a brown ale should. Not too strong, not anything to scoff at either. At 5.5% Abv (from what I understand) this is definitely one of my new favorites. Not only that, but it's local, which makes it even better!"
"Drinkability is fantastic."
"Very drinkable brown ale. I followed up the first one with two more."
"D: Damn drinkable with tons of flavor packed into 5.5 ABV. I pounded it all day during the Ybor beer fest."
"Had this poured for me at the brewery while still in the fermentor. Was an awesome experience especially to have it taste so wonderful even at 68 degrees. Its natural carbonation tickles the nose with a slight biscuity aroma. Color was that of a dark candy orange. Palate was very malty with I will be damned a peanut aftertaste. Cant wait to try it when its ready to be served."
