review_text
"Decided to revisit this after several years since it was fresh on tap at the brewery. One word, OUTSTANDING! Blew Bells Jupiter out of the water."
"On tap at the Troegs Brewery, bit too dark for a brown ale, but still a nice brown, and not amber, color, wonderful silky white foam, very tasty, and with pleasing lacing to the bottom of the pint. The flavor profile was robust, a good smooth blend of grain flavors, with a nice hop kick. The word was that the batch had been more highly hopped than in the past for Rugged Trail. It was posted as 5.2% ABV and 50 IBU. This is a very drinkable and satisfying brown. It's too bad brown ales aren't the American Beer du Jour these days."

"O: A nice, very palatable brown ale. Too acidic and rancid for true balance in my taste. But certainly has a strong set of flavors that don't apologize for each other. Bravo for the effort - definitely worth a try!"
"Overall, despite shortcomings in its components, this brew is a bit more than the sum of its parts. It can be drunk rather rapidly as it is without offending, and it sits beside complex foods very nicely. On its own, though, it just gets a little mundane."

"Back on tap at the brewery after a couple of years on hiatus. Pours a deep clear ruby with a foamy off-white head. Nice retention that leaves a rich smattering of lacing down the sides. The aroma smells of floral and green citrus notes with a light sprinkling of toasted nuts and cocoa along the back. The taste switches things up, being more sweet and nutty (and just a smidgen of dark fruit) up front before giving away to bitter tingle of earthy citrus flavors. Dry and bitter on the finish. Mouthfeel is medium with a firm creaminess to the carbonation that flows nicely in the mouth. It's good to have the Rugged Trail back, as it is a nice and slightly Americanized take on an English Brown Ale. I'd hoping this is the first of many return appearances for this beer."

"O - It was really cool they brought Rugged Trail back because I never had the chance to try it when it was in full production...this one is really easy to drink, but I wish there was more nuttiness or roastiness to cut the sweetness"
""
"I poured this from a growler. It has a dark magonay color body with a 2"" tan head. The smell is roasted malt and nuts. The taste starts off a little sweet, then the taste of roasted nuts come through on the middle to back of the tongue. Great mouth feel and overall a really good brown ale."
""
""
""
""
"O - I am glad to see this one back around, all be it for a short period of time. I have missed this one dearly as it is very easy to drink and the low ABV make it very sessionable. I shall get my fill while it lasts..."

"Easy to drink, quite delicious."
"Overall, while I do like the flavors in this ale, they seem weak, and the mouthfeel is a bit watery."
"A copper color with a larger one finger head to it. It has a smell that contains roasted nuts, malts, carmel, faint hops. The taste is a mix of roasted malts, coffee, nuts, some chocolate. MF is medium, a bit dry in the finish. A decent brown ale, but nothing that is going to blow you away."
"Yeah, it's a brown ale...not really my style at all. Pours a murky walnut brown with a small layer of white bubbles for a head. Nutty, sweet aroma, a bit buttery. Toasted malts in the taste, nutty again, sweet, diacetyl, and a bitter finish. Not entirely bad, but just too sweet for me perhaps. Medium body, and not something I'd want to drink again, aka most brown ales."
"Had this back on 3-22-09. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. This beer was a nice brown color with a tan colored head. So far so good. The aromas weren't bad it was semi sweet with some bitterness on the nose too. The Flavor just wasn't all there for me. Not sure why, it just didn't seem right. Kind of a little disappointing."
"D - Very drinkable. Lots of nutty flavors that blend really nicely with the rest of the flavors. The beer is fairly sweet, but not too sweet. Nicely balanced."
"Served in a Pint Glass. Rugged Trail pours a deep brown color that is bordering on black. The head of this brew is about a half-inch thick, foamy, and disappears quickly leaving a small amount of lingering lacing on top of the beer. As the beer is drank, however, it leaves absolutely no lacing on the glass which is quite typical for the style. This nut brown ale has the exact scent I had anticipated for the style with nice scents of roasted nuts and a slight underlying caramel or molasses note. The taste of the beer is absolutely spectacular. The nut flavor is perfectly balanced with the slight sweetness and the roasted character giving an incredible depth to the brew that I have not seen in many other nut brown ales. The only other Nut Brown I have had that could match up with this brew is Samuel Smith's Nut Brown ale which I thought was also astoundingly flavorful. Contrary to what I had expected given its depth of flavor and distinct character, Rugged Trail drinks impeccably smooth and light. Overall, I absolutely loved this brew and I must say I'm quite disappointed to find that it is retired."
"D: This is one easy drinking Troegs beer, as most of them have been. Light and roasty flavors make for a good sessionable beer."
"Drinkability: By no means bad, just not outstanding. This is one I would not seek out, but I would gladly drink it if offered. Easy to drink several with only 4.4 %ABV."
"IMO mouthfeel does not impress... to me it seems a bit on the watery side, average carbonation. good drinkability, however; the fairy tasty, inoffensive type of beer you could easily take a few of."
"Pours a nice, clear, dark-tea brown. A tan head soon becomes a patchy ring. Smells good, of brown sugar, caramel malts, and a hint of nuttiness, like a good piece of brittle. I detect more of the chocolatey richness and bitterness from the first sip. May be just a bit thin, but the taste is filling and good. Nice dry but smooth finish. Easy drinkability. I'm bummed this one was retired."
"Cheers...."
"Drinkabilty - After having smuttynose and samuel smith, i almost want to call this a light beer. Its low alcohol mixed with it being so mild and smooth, i could rip though a 6-pack in no time. Would drink again but there are better nut browns out there."
"And quite the contrary not retired just bought it with new label... its back from the dead."
"Just under a finger of beige head. Body is dark brown/mahogany, and there's a tiny bit of retention and not much lace to speak of. Aromas are chocolate maltiness dominating, but not explosive by any means. Acidity discernible in the aromas as well. Flavors are definitely chocolate. A nice tang that balances out, but the emphasis here is definitely on the chocolate biscuit malt, just what I'd expect from an English brown. Mouthfeel is high carbonation, seemingly making whatever acidity is there pop out. Lighter body, all in all a really easy drinking beer."
"Taste is nutty with a decent roast and touch of chocolate. Very good combination of malty flavors, I like it. Quite drinkable, and sessionable to boot at 4.4%. The nut flavors are very prevalent and varied...peanuts to brazil nuts to cashews. I wouldnt mind a bit creamier body and more malt presence, but I am still digging it, one of the better nut browns I have had."
"Notes: My favorite English Brown Ale from ""this side of the pond."""
"I could see picking up a 6 pack of this if I came across it. It isn't the best nut brown I've had, but much better than I expected."
"Notes: Sure enough, it may not be nothing remarkable but it is a decent brown ale, rather quaffable, pity to see it discontinued but luckily Tr√∂egs will keep on brewing something quality to replace this one in their line up."
"This was a very easy drinker with good flavor. I thought it was a bit thin but was still tasty. Wouldn't mind having a few of these."
"Nicely blended - simple, well made, very drinkable. Enjoyable."
"D- A nice brown ale that isn't overly sweet; very easy to drink."
"Overall - Overall the beer was good. The flavor was well balanced of roasted malts and hops and also tasty. It's a drinkable beer that will probably appeal to most beer drinkers. I'd call it a light brown ale, so ale drinkers will enjoy, and it isnt too heavy for any light beer drinkers. I prefer porters and stouts, but I also enjoyed this one for a lighter brown ale."
"Pours a clear brown with a cap of off-white head. Smell is of roasted nuts, slight carmley sweetness and earthy hops. Taste begins as somewhat carmley sweet, prgressing quickly into the roasted nut territory. Finished with some earthy hopyness. Medium bodied, good level of carbonation. A good brown ale."
"Poured from the fresh bottle into a clean pint glass. Brown color with a half inch of tan head, moderate lacing. Smell was ""English"" and reminded me of other nut browns. Roasty toasty and delicious. I liked this one. Easy to drink and made me want some fish-n-chips."
"I really enjoyed this one, thanks again!"
"D - I like this beer, not very jazzy but traditionally made English style - simple and quaffable - very nice for pairing with poultry or maybe a simple meal of meatloaf and brown rice -I enjoyed it and feel it fits the style well -see you on the flipside rugged trail!"
"Notes: Overall this was a very enjoyable Brown Ale with nice layers of roasted maltiness with hop backing."
"Rugged Trail goes down really easily, and the fairly low ABV makes sure you don't pay for it. Rugged Trail was never my favorite in the Troegs line-up, and when I bought sampler cases they always seemed to be the last to go. I like it, but I don't think I will miss it too much."
"D - I've thoroughly enjoyed this brown ale on a number of occasions, and am a bit disappointed that it was retired."
"pours a dark brown color with not much off-white/ tanish colored head which went away quickly. vague malty and nutty smell but was much more present in the taste. very light for a darker style beer in my opinion. this one could use a significant boost to the ABV. pretty good beer but probably my least favorite of the troegs beers i've tried."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer. Some nice, albeit simple flavors, and a relatively low ABV makes this beer very sessionable. A tasty beer from Troegs, it's a shame it's being retired. If you can still find it, I recommend picking some up."
"Overall this was a solid offering from Troegs and I am a little sad to see it go. Give this a try before it is all gone. Recommended."
"Overall, this is a very enjoyable sessionable beer. If i can find a few more bottles i will definitely grab them."
"Another keeper from Troegs, though I am disappointed to see that this great brown ale will be discontinued."
"D-this is a decent beer. It doesn't have huge flavor but what it does have works very well and offers a nice array of tastes."
"D- its a drinkable session beer. Probably the worst offering I've had from Troegs, which is saying something with how I'm grading this. I can see why they discontinued it, but its not a bad beer by any means...just a little light for Troegs standards"
"Tr√∂egs Rugged Trail Nut Brown Ale is a solid, dark brown ale with a thin, off white head that leaves solid sheets of lacing on the glass. It has a slightly sweet, wooden aroma that's nutty, with a note of toffee. It has a medium-light body that's very smooth with a slightly syrupy finish. It has a nutty, wooden flavor that's lightly sweet and lightly bitter with notes of toffee and malt extract. It's a very enjoyable brown ale."
"Very drinkable. Very flavorful for such a session-able beer."
"D - Seems very easy to drink, but I think overall I found this slightly lacking in depth of flavor. Not bad though if I want to throw a few back."
"This isn't necessarily the hardest thing to drink, but it is a pretty standard issue brown ale and I presume that's why Troegs decided to retire it."
"Overall, Rugged Trail is a very good brown ale. The aroma and taste are above average, although the mouthfeel is a little lacking. The low ABV (4.4) makes this an outstanding selection for a session beer, especially in the colder months of fall & winter. I'm very disappointed that this has been retired by Troegs."
"D - Very drinkable. Refreshing and enjoyable to drink. Decent and could kick back a few for sure"
"Poured into a shaker pint. Poured a clear deep mahogany color with a small tan head that quickly goes into a ring with pretty good lacing. Light malty aroma but not much else. Very mild in taste malty with a slight sour note and a clean finish. Overall a pleasant experiance. The mild taste and low AVB make this an excellent session beer too bad it took me this long to try it now that it will not be brewed anymore."
"Na Zdravje!"
"Taste is rather lacking, slightly nutty flavor. Goes down smooth though with a decent drinkability."
"Poured from a cellar temperature bottle into a pint glass. There is no freshness date on the bottle, but I've had it for a number of months, so it may be past its prime. The beer is a very dark brown; not as dark as dark chocolate, but close to that. There was a modest head of tan bubbles that quickly settled to something that's less than a skim of foam, just a few small bubbles and a little foam lacing, but I can see bare spots as well. Swirling the beer around gives a minimal amount of lacing. There's a little sweet malt in the nose; maybe some raisin; and some warm, toasted grain. All of the aromas are very slight though. The beer has some sweet malt flavor up from to compliment the aroma. This gives way to a nutty, biting flavor. At first I thought it was an off taste; but after taking a few more sips, I like it. The flavor is a bit watery for my tastes, and I'm the first to say that I'm not a big fan of brown ales, but I like this one. This beer has a light body, but it is also complex. The watery flavor makes it feel light at first, but the robust, nuttiness in the finish gives the beer some punch as you swallow. Very little mouthcoating, just a hint of sweetness can be found if you go looking for it. This beer drinks very easy. I can't think of any real objections, other than it's not a challenging beer. The Rugged Trail will never command your full attention, but would be great to drink whilst engaged in other activities."
"Troegs is one of my favorite brewers and while this beer is a bit tame, the taste is great"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Bottled on date 8/09. Poured into a pint glass with lil head. Dark brown color. Scents of roasted nuts, coffee, and cocoa. Very little carbonation. Very smooth creamy mouth feel. Slight nutty flavor along with a slighty bitter chocolate, coffee almost mocha taste. Pretty drinkable. I just wonder if this bottle is a little flat because of the bottled on date."
"Cheers!"
"This is definitely very easy to drink. Overall it is decent, but in a whole different class from, say, AleSmith Nautical Nut Brown."
"Drinkability - Pretty good in my opinion, not the of it's kind but you could do a lot worse."
"Pours dark brown with an off-white head. The aroma is basically non-existent, possibly some roasted or caramel malt. As it warmed you got some maple syrup aroma, but it was always very faint. The flavor is also not very strong, with some roastyness and nuttyness. The mouthfeel is fairly watery and the carbonation is low. I have liked the other beers from Troegs and maybe this was a bad bottle, but this one is a miss for me."
"nothing jumps out at you but thats what an english brown is and this is a good one."
"Beer has a slight roast character to the flavor in the back of the palate, no bitterness from hops that I can detect, a little caramel in there. Overall the beer is medium body and roasty."
"Overall I don't see myself paying 1.99 for this beer again. Especially when I can get a Samuel Smith Nut Brown ale that's around 5% ABV and taste's way smoother for 2.50."
"The flavor is similarly shy. Bread and brown sugar flavors are in there along with a light bitterness, but the flavors are all too restrained. This beer isn't awful by any stretch of the imagination. The flavors are clean and in balance. I just wanted a bit more to chew on."
"Poured a deep brown color, with less than a finger of off-white head and little lacing, in an American pint glass. Smelled of nuts, caramel, a little cocoa powder, and a little roasted malt. The taste was more intense, with more nuttiness, chocolate, roasted malt, and even a little bit of coffee flavor. Surprisingly, the body was light and decently carbonated, but at least this made for an easy-drinking session brown ale."
"D: The body helps a bit here but this is not the most impressive brew. Not enough character and not enough flavor. This one is a bit too mellow for my tastes. I'll pass on it next time."
"Drinkability: Looks like a stout and would definitely be one if the body were heavier and it was more roasted and a bit dryer. Not bad, but thre are much better representations of this style to be found."
"I would recommend this to someone who likes very light, non-offensive beers. But it is not for me unfortunately."
"d- really tasty and drinkable, didn't realize that the abv was this low (4.40%), i could easily have two or three of these, another great troegs offering."
"dr. goes down way easy, I could do more than one if I had it on hand."
"Last time I had this I did not find it to be that memorable....This time though, I'm ready to go out and get a full sixer of it! Good stuff!"
"D - goes down easy. nice beer."
"overall a nice brown..not a big brown fan but i could sip on these if they were available here.."
"D: Easy to drink if you are into nut ales. If you are not into that kind of beer, might present some problems with the smell/taste combo"
"Pours a dark brown color that appears to be very clear judging from the edges of the darkness. Has less than a finger of tanned head without much retension and leaves little lacing on the glass. Nose is full of a malty sweetness and a touch reminescent of caramel. Also includes a bit of hops on the backend blended with the sweetness. Taste is full of grain, little bit of malt sweetness, caramel and finishes quite crisp. Minorly bitter in the finish as well. Lingering taste of grain and hops with only a trace of bitterness."
"Light to medium body, feels a little watered down, but that may help the drinkability as well. This one isn't that heavy at all and is easy to put away. Overall this isn't one of my favorites from Troegs but I still found it enjoyable overall. This is nothing special or out of the ordinary, but it's still a decent brown that I could easily have a few of in a sitting."
"A very impressive pour. Pours dark brown with glints of mahogany edges; brown carbonation cascades upward from the mid-body to the top where it settles in thick, craggy tan head. Toasted and earthy aromas as well as flavors; also tastes of cocoa nibs. A relatively simple beer for the style but enjoyable."
"An English Brown Ale from one of the premier breweries in the country. Pours dark brown with a firm one inch of tan head that had good retention. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is mostly chocolate with hints of nuts. Has a nice milk chocolate flavor with hints of roasted nuts. Has a semi-sweet finish with is sort of unique. The body is a little thin for my tastes but I suppose that is the price to pay for the low ABV. I would be harsher if it had a higher ABV and this sort of body. Carbonation is good without being harsh. Very sessionable. I could put several of these away and not be tired of the beer."
"This was an okay drink; however, I really like nutty beers and this certainly wasn't one of them, so I was mildly disappointed in that aspect, but other than that it was a fairly okay beer."
"Overall, a bit flat and light, for the style, but nothing too off that I would object to drinking this again."
"decent brown ale a bit too bright on my tongue for my liking but not terrible"
"This beer would be an easy sessionable beer. However, I don't think I'll revisit it in the future as it is a little too bland in my opinion. I would enjoy it more if Troegs upped the alcohol a notch and inserted more flavor."
"D-Nothing crazy here--a solid, simple and tasty quaffer. A well built, easy to drink brew. The perfect kind of beer to use an introduction to craft beer."
"Overall a fine beer, a little thin in flavor and mouthfeel, but I would drink one again."
"I bought this bottle at Rileys in Madison, WI."
"Its funny how you might dislike something at the bar but get home and think about it...review it even, and like it more. With it's under 5 ABV you got an almost session beer here, could drink it all day, weather's a bit to warm for this to be drank all day, but after the sun goes down..."
"Drinkability is good. Troegs Nut Brown has a good balance and some good taste without overwhelming, but not great enough to go out of your way to try."
"This is an easy drinker. Very smooth and medium bodied. Very enjoyable!"
"Disappointing, as Troegs is one of my favorite breweries."
"D - not very drinkable. Could barely finish one"
"But I gotta tell you there just wasn't much going on the bottle. It did have a nice rounded taste to it but it just didn't go out of the way to impress. Glad I tried it...more than once as I bought a 6er, but I won't be going back."
"Is there a bad Troegs beer? Just simply an amazing session brown. I know my review doesn't say much, but it's just so simple yet perfect. This is what a all session browns should taste like."
"I guess overall I would rate the whole package as slightly below average."
"D: Completely unaggressive, very mellow. I can drink this cold, warm, whatever. It's rather pleasant, but nothing particularly special about it."
"Not a fan of this beer, in fact, i think its the weakest beer from Troegs. The smell is decent, but he flavor fails to deliver. Almost watery and thin in taste and mouthfeel."
"Pours a deep nutty brown color (obviously). Inviting aromas of caramel, some chocolate, and roasted nuts. The taste follows with some definite roasted notes and sweetness. Mouthfeel is watery, but not awful. Easy drinking for sure. I've had 3 different Troegs beers over the last 3 nights and have enjoyed each of them. Great brewery. Recommended."
"Pours from a bottle. Pours a nauseating chestnut with absolutely zero head. The faintest hint of lacing. Stunning herbal aroma, accompanied by sweat and citrus. Thick smoky taste, with orange and mango. Non-descript mouthfeel and slightly dry finish."
"Finger plus head of light brown foam, mainly larger bubbles, fairly full coating of lacing, stays around for some time. You get more cocoa and mocha dust in the nose than out-and-out nuttiness, kinda roasted citrus peel notes too, not much obvious hoppy presence, smooth and borderline silky nostril texture. Medium-bodied, the carbonation rises above the level of prodding forward, instead kind of disperses the flavors. Malt, milk chocolate, creamed coffee and then brazil nut, walnut flavors. Has a mineral water type of freshness that more or less cancels out the underlying roasted notes. The lemon and orange citrus has a tenuous presence, but there. Any fruit muted and woven into the overall fabric. The hops as well indistinct, present while not an active component. Inoffensive quaff."
"3.0 D: Decent. I'm not pissed that I drank it, but I'd rather I not have it too often."
"Definately a beer you can sit down with and craack a few. Not hard to swallow by any means."
"Reddish brown in color. Little to no head. It is appealing to the eye. Nutty nose with hints of malt mixed in. The flavor is nice and creamy and has a good malt presence. The nut is more understated than most nut browns which I like. The attack is clean and the finish is as well. The mouthfeel is lush and thick. Looking at my notes I hope that the mouthfeel doesn't get a free bonus from being on the same list as some other less impressive brews. I think I was fair though, the mouthfeel is very good. This is one of my alltime favorite nut browns, I wonder if my numbers will bear that out?"
"Poured from a brown bottle into a weizen glass. Has a dark, almost coffee like color with reddish hues. Smells of caramel and chocolate. Tastes somewhat bitter with caramel finish. Creamy in the mouth. Kind of heavy on the stomach so drinkability is not so great. Maybe nut brown ales are not for me."
"The beer poured from the bottle into the pint glass to yeild a very dark brown color. The aroma was very sweet and of chocolate. The mouthfeel was very light as was taste which was sweet with a hint of chocolate. The beer is OK, but needs some more body."
"D - Very enjoyable and a great representation of the style. If I had better access to it, I'd definitely drink more of it. This was my first Troegs beer, and I was far from disappointed."
"Poured into a shaker pint glass. Color was a dark reddish brown, and was mostly translucent. Head started off as a nice 2 finger mocha brown head that lasted a few minutes, then clung to the side. Smell was a sweet nutty brown multi grain bread. Taste was brown sugar and wheat. Felt very thin and watery in the mouth, detracted from an otherwise solid beer. Very easy to drink, pleasant to do so."
"Mouthfeel is thin and wet. Some mild carbonation on the tongue. Flavor of molasses, sweet breads and finishes with just a touch of bitterness. Not bad."
"Another good product from this brewery. The low ABV and refreshing taste make this dark brew a quaffer even for the hot summer."
"light to medium body, overall smooth, but moments of both wateriness and acidic texture. moderate but sometimes fizzy and prickly carbonation."
"There was not much to this beer. It was brown ale to definition. Nothing extraordinary."
"Easy drinking brown ale."
"The smell and taste are dominated by something roasted until burnt, such as seeds or nuts. The finish has a hint of chocolate, but again, roasted dark, not sweet, chocolate. This does not have the sweetness of many other brown ales. The feel is smooth, if unremarkable, which along with the low alcohol content, makes Tr√∂egs Rugged Trail Nut Brown Ale very drinkable."
"Overall a prety good nut brown ale. Not as much flavor as I would have hoped for but drinkable."
"Notes: Disappointed with this one, there are better brown ales out there. Just was flat and one-dimensional."
"Drinkability: I really didn't like this beer very much. It seemed pretty plain. I do prefer more hop orientated beer, but I think if this had more nut flavor or really just something exciting in the taste I would like it a great deal more. It seems to sticky to even be a good session beer."
"D- Very good session beer at 4.4%. Tastes like several of my homebrew attempts with a heavy malt/light hops mix. Would try again - hopefully on tap."
"This is, overall, extremely balanced and very easy to drink. At 4.4% ABV, it's an excellent session beer."
"Quite thin, almost like water. Light chocolate malt with a mild hop kicker. A little one-dimensional, easy to drink, but not fascinating."
"As far as Troegs' lineup is concerned, I don't think there's a stinker in the bunch. If there had to be, I'd nominate Rugged Trail. Sure, it's enjoyable enough to drink but with so many better offerings from this brewery, why would you? If you're looking for somewhere to start with this brewery's diverse and delicious lineup, look elsewhere. Thanks DrJay!"
"D: Exceptional drinkability. 4.40% ABV, not too sweet, not too bitter. It's refreshing, yet earthy and has some substance to it."
"I think I have found my favorite from Troegs,very low ABV but the taste is simply awesome."
"It's not a bad brew at all...but a few more things here and there and it could be a great thing."
"On tap at Elmer Sudds. Arrived in a pint glass and appears a slightly hazed dark chestnut color with about an inch of creamy light tan foam. Taste and nose are of lightly caramelized malts, nuts such as pecans and hazelnuts, cocoa powder, very mild coffee. A bit watery with medium carbonation. Not too shabby, I'll seek this one out from time to time."
"this Trail is rather smooth and unrugged..."
"Hate to say I ever drain poured a Troegs. But I just did. This kills the variety pack for me..."
"D- if you want a light bodied, sweet beer, with a low ABV, that you can drink like Coke-a-cola, then look no further, this Troegs' for you. If you want a rich, dark, roasty, nutty English Brown Ale, well, try someplace else."
"This is about as obvious as a session beer gets - 4.40$ ABV and I can't even feel a drop of it. Sure, this went down easily, but I prefer my beers to have some depth to them so I can sip and savor them. This is so light that it almost feels like it's carbonated but ya won't notice; that would involve too much thought and this is just a typical example of an easygoing style..."
"Drinkability is what this one has going for it. It goes down fairly easy and has a low ABV. which makes it a decent example of a session beer."
"I think this is a typical brown ale good flavor and easy drinking. I like a few local browns better but I wouldn't turn this down."
"Pours nice brown color. Very good coloring, looks like a good quality nut brown color. The smell has a slight malt smell to it. The taste is a little weak for a nut brown. It doesn't have to deep rich taste that other nut browns offer. The mouthfeel is good. There is no carbination to be felt in the mouth. This is a very smooth and very drinkable beer."
"D - I'd drink alot of this no problem. Low alcohol, tasty. A little residual nut bitterness does build up over drinking it, like eating too many walnuts."
"D: very drinkable, not overly sweet or roasty or thick. A good session brown"
"D: More ""sessionable"" than most brown ales, but I don't know if that's a good thing in this case--probably the least impressive brew I've had from Troegs."
"Brew poured to a nice deep brown color with copper highlights. Good sized off-white head that has fair retention but does leave some lacing. Tasted malt aroma is very nice and seems to leads to a slight nuttiness. The aroma also seems to have a very subtle chocolate/cocoa property. The flavor is where this beer shines for me, the roasted malts mixed with a slight chocolate property really mix quite perfectly. Their is a slight hop presence at the tail end but is more of an accompaniment than anything else. Has a slightly different finishing taste that I like but suppose could be a deterrent for others? This brew is very smooth in its feel, extremely drinkable, perfect session beer. I am so impressed with this brewery, thankful we are seeing their stuff in NY now!"
"a little different taste than the english beers i have had. easy beer to drink would make a good session beer."
"Overall: I probably got a strange bottle. I got straight-up marinara sauce out of this, seriously. Otherwise, great sessionability, but low flavor makes this one a pass."
"Pours a dark brown color.. little to no head, very small amount of lacing. Smell is very nutty and has some nice roasted aromas to it. Taste is mildly light bodied, okay mouthfeel.. the usual brown ale nuttiness to it. Suffers from a lack of carbonation.. very flat, doesn't make the beer all too appealing. A decent beer.. clearly the low-light of the mixed 12 but it seems like every brewery feels obligated to make a brown ale. I'll drink it, but I'd rather have any other beer from this brewery."
"D- An easy drinker at 4.4%, I could drink a 6er no problem in a sitting. The flavor profile is just enough to keep you interested, while not being overbearing. This one is somewhat on the mild side."
"This is a fairly drinkable brown ale, but not close to as aromatic or flavorful as many browns out there."
"Re-review May 2009: There is a tad bit more body to the beer than I initially gave it credit for. There is more drying notes in the finish and a creamy smoothness and some walnut like notes in the finish. It isn't a particularly sweet beer, but it is refreshing. I'm adding some points."
"Drinkability is quite nice and makes this one a geed session ale."
"Drinkability: I like my nut beers to have a good nut taste to it and this fits the bill very smooth and sessionable...I like the multiple layers to this beer and it stands out among nut flavored beers..Dare I say, this may be the best nut brown I have had"
"D- very easy to drink , very low abv , like a more refined new castle"
"Not a great pour. My bad. Very dark ruby red... almost purple. OK head. Toasty with molasses and coffee in the nose. Not especially nutty in aroma. Some fruit, some toast and light hoppiness in the flavour. Kind of all-around mild flavours. A bit astringent with a medium carbonation and body is drinkable. Not particularly exciting, but no off flavours either. Solid, sessionable brown ale."
"Notes: Not a whole lot to talk about, better than a newcastle."
"ABV is not issue at all, the calories from the sweetness may be a bit limiting."
"#2 of 4 in my troegs sampler 12 pack."
"Has a slightly watery mouthfeel, but it goes down extremely easy. Carbonation is low but again, it goes hand-in-hand with this being a pretty good, not great, session beer."
"Pours dark brown with some red undertones, looks like coca-cola. Very little head, that disapates to nothing. Nice smell of malts, and some chocolate. Hazelnut flavor, mixed with some malts and with some underlying hops, some chocolate aftertaste. There is some carbonation, and it has a thin on body. Very drinkable, and tasty, good seesion beer. This is a good representation of the style, and worth a try. I wish I had more."
"A good example of the style"
"The feel of this beer is very light. Low in ABV and well balanced. It makes a pretty good session beer as well as a good beer for it's smoothness."
"D- Pretty easy and palatable English brown. Nice balance. Not a knock out but sessionable nonetheless."
"This is a very nice, drinkable session beer. There could be a little more malt body to balance out the hop bitterness for my taste but a pretty good example of a brown ale."
"It isn't that this is a bad beer, up that carbonation and you have a winner, but until then, I probably would skip this one."
"Pours an almost black body with minor white head that receeds quickly. A roasted malt smell along with toffee and some minor sweet malts in the aroma with very little hops present. A thicker ,full-body beer that contains moderate sweetness and hints of oak and nuts for a decent drying backbite. While a tad simple, a solid brown and perfect to session a few while chillin' at the bar."
"Pours a great dark brown, with some good garnet flashes, with a nice head and some decent lacing. Nice deep scent, very malty, although not much else. I loved the taste, deep and dark, malty with some nice hop undertones, and dry as well; would've been rated a bit higher but there is almost pretty much no nuttiness to it, which isn't a big deal except it's in the name; good thick after taste, too. Goes down fine, with just a bit too much carbonation. Excellent brown ale!"
"D- A decent nut brown, I would have no problem drinking many of these, 4.4% abv makes this very easy."
"Hoping to finish this review up and have a nice, refreshing can of Shlitz beer in celebration of a Wake Forest victory!"
"d - had 2 pints, but the selection that night was not the best."
"Had on tap at Cole's in Buffalo. Poured a dark walnut with a bit of red around the edges. Very small head with not much lacing. Smelled malty with hint of molasses. Taste was nice but nothing exceptional with mostly malt coming through with hint of chocolate. It was moderate carbonation with a slightly bitter finish. Overall a nice beer that you could have a few and have a nice evening."
"Drinkability- Easy drinking as a nut brown should be. Just a boring example. I wouldn't look forward to a second bottle ever."
"Rugged Trail was a darker than I expected - almost the color of a porter or stout, dark mahogany when held up to the light, with a thin tan head. The aroma had some nuttiness to it. The taste and mouthfeel were both pleasant enough, but were a little too reminiscent of cola for my taste. I would drink it again if offered, but probably would not seek it out."
"Dark brown with a little lacing and a thin island of head remains on the beer after pouring. Aroma is a little different with the roasted grains coming in very clean and not-pungent at all. A little floral and sweet. I enjoyed it. Taste starts out all right- just the beginning tastes like a really nice brown ale or porter with all the nice roastyness involved, but it soon diminishes to just plain wateryness. I was excited to see Troegs initially when it first started getting distributed here but all their beers seems like watery beer soda (save the time I had Hopback on tap, which I thought was great). This was the last bottle I bought from them and while I don't find them all out bad, I do not think they're particularly good. A huge boost in the flavor and getting rid of the soda-like quality of their brews would be a huge step up for me."
"Troegs Nut Brown is a welcome departure from traditional English brown ales as it has more flavorful, with a bigger variety of flavors, while still maintaing a brown ale balance. One of my favorite browns to date."
"just a pretty good beer over all"
"8/4/7/3/14 (3.6/5)"
"d: not an amazing example of the style but definitely drinkable."
"Thanks Sean for this."
"Overall, well balanced and a good session beer due to its low alcohol. I wouldn't get bored with this one."
"D - Great example of a brown ale, very drinkable"
"Man, this is a beer that's two steps away from exceptional, just needs a bit more in regards to body. That being said, it's still a damned fine ale and one I could drink regularly due to the low ABV."
"The feel is milky and smooth on the tongue. Velvety. Top notch. It's really one of the better browns I have had. It's bitter and sweet as well. Loaded with caramel and hints of chocolate. Just great."
"Poured into the Samuel Adams pint glass. Deep brown in color, dishwater tan head that settles to a soapy ring. Aroma is dry with chocolate, coffee, hops, and all purpose ale yeast. The taste isn't bad, but it is a bit lackluster. Sweet and toasted, a little thin, and a mellow hopping. Residual spiciness is slightly unfavorable. Maybe the hops are a little aggressive, or the toasted grain is more burnt than toasted? Can't quite put my finger on it, but it isn't the best English Brown I have come across. Decent though."
"D - Very tasty for how small a beer it is. Highly sessionable."
"Pours a deep amber to brown-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet caramel and a bit nutty. In the taste, small watery caramel malt and a dry nuttiness in the end. A smooth and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a very small dry, nuttiness in the aftertaste. OK, light body and flavor, but nice."
"D - Sessionable... Nothing to distinctive or memorable, but nothing detracting either... A very average brew all the way around..."
"Pours very thick and dark. Looks more like a nut black than a nut brown. Virtually no head, and little carbonation. It's almost nonexistent aroma is of sweet, biscuity malts. The taste is alright. They definitely went light on the malts and hops. It's kinda sweet and not too nutty. It has a very light body which makes it easy to drink. It's a good session beer if you're into that kinda thing."
"D: This has a nice roasted/nutty taste and with its low ABV, would make a great session beer. I could drink many of these."
"Drinkability: Not a terribly impressive beer, but definitely a drinkable one. A decent toasty malt profile, a sub-5.0% abv, and nothing too offensive makes this a drinkable if not impressive beer."
"This was the first I've heard of this brewery and so far I'm fairly impressed. I consider this a very good English Nut Brown and definitely worth buying again."
"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a glass forming a 1"" head over a dark walnut colored body. The head faded pretty quickly to a ring leaving very light lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet and nutlike, not at all fruity with a touch of vanilla and toasted caramel. The flavor upfront is the same as the aroma with some bread or biscuit thrown in. There's a very light hops presence at the back, earthy, nutty and very well matched to the brew. It feels very full in the mouth with a very slight dry finish. This is the best of the four in their variety pack, IMO, and it deserves a very mark in drinkability. 'Wiedersehen"
"Not bad, but not impressive."
"I found this to be a below-average nut brown. I like the thickness of it, but something in the finish left me lacking. Almost reminds me of a watered-down hazelnut brown. Average in just about every way, which is a shame because of my love for the Troegs' Brewery."
"D: Very low ABV makes this beer very sessionable, however this is one of my least favorite beers by Troegs."
"Much prefer this on tap than from the bottle. Tap gives more hop flavor. Great session beer and one I will seek out again and again."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours very dark, almost black, with a thin tan head. The brew smells of dark chocalate. The taste on the tip of the tongue is chocolate malty goodness and ends with a very plesant bitterness. It has a medium body with little carbonation. Rugged trail goes down smooth. This is a very solid beer!"
"Pours a nice deep marron with a toffee colored head. Nice hazelnut aroma with hints of bready malt and hop undertones. A nice hop bitterness upfront, developing into a nutty, malty finish. This beer goes down smooth, and it's easy to put away a case in an evening with friends."
"D - This is an easy drinking beer that I could session while hanging out and playing darts this is worth trying sometime"
"D_Simply put, outstanding. As I said before, well rounded and also eminently drinkable. Another winner from Troegs."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. If it tasted as good as it looked and smelled it would be a phenomenal beer. Certainly worth a try though."
"Drinkability is moderate. Flavor is not too impressive, but the low alcohol makes for a sessionable brew."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch an a half frothy tan head (after a vigorous pour). Head retention is average, but the lacing is pretty good. It smells like nuts, chocolate, toasted malt and caramel. Aroma is on the sweet side, but a bit weak. It tastes similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some cherries. Mouthfeel is light/medium, but it seems thin to me. It's also well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it's not hard to drink at all and it's smooth and sessionable. It's a decent beer, but it's not something I would buy all the time. But if you get the chance you should try it, it's not bad."
"Low alcohol makes this an easily sessionable beer. Not too bitter or sweet."
"D-Very dirnkable brown-easy paring with food. I enjoyed this one and would drink again when the mood for a brown strikes me."
"D: This is an average brown ale. Well crafted, but nothing really noteworthy. Goes down very easy and would make a good session beer."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured a deep translucent brown with red highlights around the edges. Quarter inch head dissipated almost instantaneously into a thin, inconsistent skim of foam that coalesced around the edges. Scent was malty sweet with a pronounced caramel presence and a slight nutty character in the background. Taste consistent with nose; caramel and toffee flavors are very much in the foreground. Mouthfeel was light- to medium-bodied with a mild tingle across the tongue. Very sessionable brown ale with lots of flavor; however, caramel and toffee flavors could be a bit cloying after more than a couple."
"Smooth and easy going down. Is this what they mean by a ""session beer""?"
"This is the first brown ale I have tried. Being so, I think I expected something a little more from this beer. Overall, I think I would drink this again, but after I tried a few others first."
"Overall, a very average brown ale. If they improve the feel it would be much better."
"D: Not a big nut brown fan, but this is good. The strong chocolate flavor and coffee smell make the beer come off a little heavy."
"D: A light and easy drinking brown which would make for a good session along with its fairly low abv of 4.2%. Didn't really impress me flavor wise but the drinkability made up for it."
"Pours a dark brown almost black color with a short lived tan head. Sweet, nutty malt taste, with roasty, nutty charred like malt, but lightly so. Medium to full bodied with some coffee flavors complementing the mild bitterness in the finish. Average to light carbonation, and nicely flavorful on the whole. Good brown ale."
"Thanks to Tbn2 for trading this brew. One of the best brown ale's I've had."
"Dark brown colored ale with a quickly fading head.Aroma is nutty.Taste is chocolate,nuts and slightly metallic.This is not bad by any means but I've drank and reviewed better brown ales.I would drink again but I would not go out of my way to get it.Kind of unremarkable!!"
"Overall - Not very exciting, but it's an easy drinking ale that's subtleties are an obvious result of a well crafted brew. Great session beer!"
"definitely a great session beer. pours a nice dark brown with a brownish head and great lacing. not overpowering in either the malt, or hops department, but just the right amount of roasted malts and sweetness from start to finish. goes down nice and smooth. i could drink a case of these without even thinking about it, and this is honestly one of the best american versions of this style out there. i've never been let down by the troegs brothers, and this is no exception."
"Definitely in my top 3 every day casual drinking beers, if for no other reason than its smoothness and drinkability. Looks like an extremely dark malty brew, but your first sip reveals a smooth light nutty beer, with a hint of chocolate on the finish and a slight sweetness throughout. Let me emphasize how smoothly this beer goes down - on my first bottle I took a sip, swallowed, thought wow this is good, immediately took another sip... and repeated down to 2/3rds through the bottle before I caught myself. Even if you don't normally care for darker beers give this one a try - you won't be disappointed."
"Drinkability: Decent English Brown and quite easy to drink. Nothing spectacular but good."
"Looks dark redish black with small quickly dispersing head. Smells like nutty roasted maltswith chocolate overtones and some light hops. Tastes pretty much like the smell advertized, with a lighter than you think mouth feel that makes this beer very drinkabel."
"These sre being enjoyed immensely..."
"There is much more for this style available."
"give this beer a try"
"Poured black-brown, with a small, dark head that fizzled down the lace that blanketed the top of the beer. Looks almost more like a stout. The smell was nutty, malty, with a slight hoppy sting, but not very strong. The taste was dominated by roasted malts, including chocolate malts. Then there of course was the nuts (but not as nutty as I would have expected or would have liked), the smallest hint of hops, and a touch of sweetness (like brown sugar). Mouthfeel was lighter than the appearance suggested, and it was well carbonated. The taste was fine and all, good enough to give it a shot, but not my favorite example of this style."
"My (adult) kids were up for Mother's Day and, while I was busy BBQ'ing, they decided to ""raid Dad's beer fridge."" Unfortunately, one of them complained that there was no Brown Ale to be had (her favorite). So I apologized and decided I'd go find something good to try. This one was right there in the cooler at TDL. So I bought it; tried it. I really liked it. Deep, dark brown color in the glass and a rich malty smell, taste of dark caramel malts with just a touch of hops for balance. Not as sweet as I had expected (pleasant surprise) and extremely drinkable. Went down waaaay too smoothly. I'm not an English Brown fanatic, but I like this beer. I'll give it a try again!"
"Poured a clear dark brown color with orange highlights. Tan head. Aroma was of toffee, brown sugar, nuts, and a hint of cola. Relatively light body and delicately sweet with a nutty note. I also tasted some nice subdued flowery hop. Surprisingly not as sweet as I thought it would be."
"D: A good session beer for those who enjoy a Brown Ale, English or American."
"D= probably very drinkable if it's flowing on tap or the offering of the night."
"This was a decent beer and would certainly never turn it down."
"D- Easy toput down and this would make a good winter beer to sit down with for a night. Nothing too special though."
"MF&D- Thin bodied and well carbonated. Felt more like a thin smokey porter than a nut brown. Either way this is a delicious beer and definitely one I would session. Troegs is 4 for 4 in my book."
"D: Fell quickly. Definitely worth a try, but it's not really special in any way (as opposed to the girl who recommended it)."
"Drinkability: A good ""if you're in the mood for it"" beer; light and easy drinking."
"MF&D - Slightly watery and highly carbonated. I guess you could session this one, but I don't think I'd bother."
"Pours a very dark brown color with a below average khaki colored head that left a light ring around the glass. The aroma is of light roasted malt, kind of like weak watery coffee. The taste is of roasted malt with hints of chestnuts. Pretty one sided towards the malt, no hop flavor or aroma detected. The feel is moderate with fizzy carbonation, finishes well balanced. It is a finely contructed brew but nothing is spectacular about it. It is refreshing and at 4.4ABV you can make a night out of drinking these"
"This is a deeply brown beer, bordering on black, with a creamy tan head. The aroma is subdued, but contains a notable roasted malt character. There's a little floral hop smell in the distance of the aroma, and also a little unconverted roasted grain. The taste is moderately dry, with the roasted grain character continuing. The malt flavor becomes more restrained through the drink. Medium in body, and a little rough in mouthfeel. The carbonation is moderate. Decent bitterness that lasts long into the aftertaste. This beer is well constructed, and quite well balanced. All in all, this is a fine brew."
"I dunno. There's not much to get excited about here. I'm not a huge brown ale fan, but even for the style it's lacking. Troegs brews much better beers than this. Rugged Trail is probably only for the insane brown ale connoisseur who has to try them all. I'm going to breeze through the rest of this bottle and finally get to my first Bigfoot of the 2008 season..."
"A nice sessionable English brown from Troegs. The more of it I taste the more, I like it."
"M + D: This one is a bit thin and watery feeling. Carbonation is maybe just a little lower than what I'd expect from the style, as well. A little bit lacking all around, it would be easier to drink if the tangy and metallic notes weren't so noticable. I found the doppelbock to be rather mediocre as well, so it is starting to seem like hoppy beers are where the Tr√∂eg bros. shine."
"Overall, not that big of a fan of this one. What is there is nice, but there just ain't enough of it. A bit too light."
"Overall, pretty drinkable, but not really that fantastic. Aroma and flavor were a little weaker than I was looking for - good session beer, but not very interesting."
"D: Good for session- light for a brown, low alcohol and flavors went great with Mexican. Not Troegs best but not bad."
"Very quaffable even with a couple minor flaws. A great session beer. I'd recommend trying it."
"Pours a deep dark brown that shows some ruby highlights when held to light. The aroma was some brown malts, but overall, rather weak. The taste is a subdued blend of brown malts and a mild nuttiness. The beer is very light bodied and quite smooth. In all honesty, this is a decent example of a style I'm not all that fond of."
"BLUF-this is definitely a good session ale to have. It's not something that I'll search out, but it's good for any night of the week. Average representation of the style."
"D: Easy to drink and tasty enough."
"I'll definitely get this again."
"Very clear, dark auburn with deep red highlights. A half inch cap of slightly rocky beige foam appeared after the pour, settling into a ring and skim of fine bubbles. Just a bit of lace. The aroma was nice and malty, chocolate and dark kilned malts, with some spicy hops thrown in. Quite appealing. The flavour was weighted towards malt with a mild caramel and chocolate base, toasty and nutty, plus a delicate roast character that added complexity in the background. Bitterness was restrained yet balanced the malt and spicy hops became a player in the finish, along with lingering bitter cocoa. Medium/light bodied with average carbonation, decent texture overall, but seems just a little thin. This actually helps make it very drinkable and highly sessionable. I really enjoyed this beer and would gladly keep some on hand in the fridge."
"Drinkability: For some reason, I didn't have high hopes for this beer in the beginning. That all changed when I started drinking it. Overall, it was a well rounded Nut Brown Ale and it would make a fine session Nut Brown Ale."
"D: High drinkability. Not a remarkable beer, but like all the Troegs I've had so far, wonderfully balanced, which makes them very worth trying."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, very good representation of style. This is nice beer with a lot of substance that won‚Äôt knock you over, thus it‚Äôs your quintessential ‚Äúsession‚Äù beer."
"Second review 26 June 2008. I have revised my scores up slightly. I am not sure why it seemed so thin last time I had it. It seemed a very pleasant medium-light body this time with very nice flavors. Like milk chocolate and whipped cream but with a little coffee or cinnamon added to give it a little bitter bite but not a lot of flavor. An extremely enjoyable, mellow beer. Definitely a good choice for anyone wanting an English brown ale."
"Drinkability: Easy to drink, but lacking some of the deep flavors traditionally found in this style."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I'm a fan of Brown Ales, and this one just dosen't do it for me. This is probably my least favorite offering from the Troegs brothers to date."
"Pours a clear dark brown. Tan head that has some staying power. Nose is not very there. Seems mild and almost dirty. Very mild nut quality to it. Flavor is oh my goodness. Damn Gina! Such subtle qualities to it. It doesn't yell and scream in your face but hits you with multiple layers of things to ponder. I even get a small amount of raisins here. Beyond that the nice earthy and woody stuff. Minor caramel mixed with almost a wood/bark flavor. Amazing levels of flavor here, but you really have to be ready to seek them out. Feel has a good carbonation and a nice level of liquid feel. Very drinkable. One of the best EBAs I have had in so long. More of a beer to ponder than just down. I like."
"D: A nice if not unremarkable brown ale. The hints of chocolate set it apart from others."
"Pours a nice bronze color with slightly off-white head. Head dissipates really quickly. Aroma is not real prominent, but has somewhat of a malty character. Taste is a little bland, but the beer is very smooth. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side. Nothing spectacular, but very drinkable."
"Mild...pretty typical for style. Pretty good beer as a brown ale is."
"Smell is pretty tame (subtle if you are being optimistic). What is there is earthy and nutty. Taste is somewhat flat with a metallic aftertaste that i really did not like. Mouthfeel is too thin, Carbonation is pretty good, maybe a bit high. Overall an okay beer but not one that i will return to."
"Auburn/ chestnut in color with a tan head an light lacing. Smells dominated by nuts mostly, as the name suggests, and molasses and roasted malt. For taste ,see smell.Mouthfeel was average if not a little watery, not bad , but a little more viscosity would do nicely. Good drinkability, especially this time of year, a nice camp fire would do well with this . Definitely worth a try."
"A beautiful mahogany color with a smallish tan head that fizzles to very little quickly, an average bit of lacing clings to the glass. The aroma is quite good, a strong 4.0 but I went with the 4.5. I smell coffee, molasses and toffee sweetness. The flavor loses a little, adding a sort of grassy bite along with some smoke and more coffee. It's pretty thin stuff, a bit too thin to me, with lots of tingly carbonation to liven it up. I note a little roasted nuts in the finish. Not bad at all, most folks should like this but it is a bit whimpy for a brown ale to me, very drinkable and tastey enough, but not the best. I would gladly drink again though and recommend you give it a try."
"There are probably better examples of the style out there but this will do the job if you're in the mood for a sessionable brown ale."
"For a few minutes it was nice to be ""back"" in Pennsylvania. Definitely recommended."
"This is to English brown ales what American Oktoberfests (like Sam Adams) are to German Oktoberfest. It share a lot of basic qualities, but goes a little darker and with a stronger roasted flavor. Overall, it's darn tasty with cocoa, black roasted grain and a hint of walnut. The aroma is a little tame, losing the great chocolate undertones, but overall this is a good looking, good drinking beer. Yummy."
"Deep chestnut colored with a low off-shite head. Aromas of dark malts mixed with smoke and currant. Dry mouthfeel, a bit tannic, but full and rich. Lots of interesting flavors of cocoa, smokey charred wood, molasses, caramel, and some ripe cherry. Very smooth and balanced flavor, nothing too big tries to take over. A variety of flavors move in and out. Reminds me almost of a dry stout or porter. Really great beer, very drinkable."
"This beer poured a clear dark brown color with a thin tan head. The aroma is heavy of malt with nut and caramel fragrances easily noted. The taste is mostly of malt with nut, caramel and chocolate characteristics evident. The body is medium and a little thinner than I would have like for this brew. The finish on this beer ¬ñ as with the other Troegs I have tasted is quite clean. I¬íll definitely be on the lookout for another one of these."
"Pours a ruby hazlenut brown with a little head that dies pretty quick and no lacing. Smells nutty with a slight spice and vanilla. Taste is simple with a little hop and malt. Medium in the mouth with favorable carbonation. Awesome session beer that is good for all occations."
"Very easy to drink, good for hanging out."
"Watery mouthfeel that makes it easy to gulp. Paired with vegetarian chili quite nicely. Nothing spectacular, but this would be a nice Fall session beer."
"I usually like Brown Ales, so I decided to give this Troegs a try. It poured a nice brown, with aromas of roasted hazelnuts and a hint of molasses. The head disappeared quickly though. On the palate, it was unfortunately disappointing. You still have the roasted nuts, but too light of a body and not enough nuttiness. Very drinkable though with a nice crisp finish. A bit short of a great one!"
"A dark velvet, almost cola tint forms minimal head....syrupy sugar maltiness in the nose...swift thin rush to the throat--distributes evenly...a bit too fizzy and a bit too un-nutty to produce high marks...a malt presence that suggests imbalance...with time, the taste settles in the tastebuds...not among the better nut browns, but not a turn-off to the style either....Troegs gets the benefit of the doubt normally, but this lacks the professed ""toasted"" tag I read in its description...."
"Drinkability- This was a good beer, I enjoyed it! I would recommend this beer to friends and customers."
"Flavor is a lot like a porter in many ways, though with a lighter flavor. Bakers chocolate hints really sell this."
"Overall: More chocolatey than I'm used to in a brown ale, still I rather enjoyed this one. If you like your brown ales to be dark and full flavored like porters this one is definitely worth a try."
"Brown, slightly amber and almost cola appearance. Thin tan head that drops to a film right away. The film does mangage to leave nice speckled lacing. Smell of caramel malt but the real highlight of the smell is the cocoa. The cocoa comes to the front in the taste also. It's a light almost creamy cocoa taste, with very little bitterness. Also some light smokyness and some toasted nut notes. Finished with the just a faint earthy bitterness. Only complaint is that at first it seamed a little thin in the mouthfeel but the complexity of flavors takes over and I loose the sense that it is thin. This is a beer that I've had many times but never reviewed. As expected a solid offering from Troegs. A solidly drinkable beer that would be a good choice any time."
"Deep brown, almost opaque with a small light tan head that is quickly gone. Light nose - hints of caramel malts and very light, crisp hops. Huge mouth with caramels but not sweet and heavy as in an Eku 28 - it's a big caramel flavor but not a lot of sweetness. Nuts, huh? Well, if you say so, I suppose I get a little nuttiness out of it - but it could just be the power of suggestion! A perfectly good session ale - I could make this one of my regular line up with no problem."
"Rugged Trail is right up there with Troegenator as my favorite Troegs beers. also makes a mighty fine pizza dough."
"Pours a rich mahogony with a one finger khaki colored head that dies down soon after pour. Not much stickiness at all. Smell is average with sweet malty goodness and some roasted nut odors as well. Taste isn't that great, kind of bland. Very mild caramel flavors on the tongue with a bit of dark chocolate as well. Starts pretty smooth, ends up quite dry. Very light mouthfeel, not very good for this style, with a mild carbonation. Drinkability would be pretty good just because there is no alcohol present anywhere, but I'm not sure if I could have more than one. I was a bit disappointed by this brew. Troegs makes amazing beers, but this one doesn't fall in to that category."
"D - Very good beer, Has a little more chocolate taste than most Nut Browns"
"Notes: I am impressed. Definitely not my favorite Troegs offering, nor my favorite brown. But to pack this much flavor into a 4.4 % ABV is a testament to skill of the brewers at Troegs. A nice beer to sit and have a few of. Could also see it pairing well with many foods."
"A decent English style brown, although probably my least favorite of the Troegs lineup. Easy enough to drink, but really has no ""hook"" in it to make me want a second one."
"Overall an interesting brown ale. Light and tasty."
"This is a good brown ale but fails to be great because it's a little too thin and watery. I'd like some more body and more robust flavor. Nice, though, and easily drinkable."
"Pours brown with a thin head with small bubbles. Smells malty with a distinct roasted coffee aroma. Good malty flavor with roasted nuts and a hint of coffee. Medium body with soft carbonation and smooth finish. This is a very good brown ale. It goes great with Snyder's hard pretzels! I would definitely buy it again. It has more character than many American browns that I have had."
"Pours a very attractive clear brown/reddish hightlights, thick tan head forms, very sticky, laces nicely with good retention. Smell is sweet, caramel, brown sugar and nuts, some chocolate and light roast, maybe a bit of coffee. Taste is nice and malty, some fruits, bit of iron, chocolate and coffee roast, caramel nuttiness, bit weak in the finish. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. Refreshing, nice to drink."
"Nice brown color, one finger head with big bubbles, dissolves pretty quickly. No lacing. Solid looking, alhtough not amazing. Nose is pretty subtle. Toasted malt, some nutiness, but pretty mild. Flavor is great - lots of sweet malt up front, nuts in the middle, along with spices and some dried fruit. Gets a little watery as it keeps going. Feel is a little thin, especially as the beers goes on. Starts out really solid, then slips a little, but still another good one from Troegs."
"I'm a Belgian brown nut , and this beer is a far cry from anything in that category. Not the most 'rugged' brown that I've ever tried. I would rather something with a bit more complexity. Worth a shot, but average at best."
"This is another very good beer from Troegs I like this brewery more and more every day."
"Drinkability: I would give more here if not for the mild syrupy finish. The subdues flavor helps to keep you from getting tired of this brew."
"the flavor is as advertised. subdued, sweet, with framing bitterness. this is a good one for the session. there's a husky chocolateyness, too"
"This beer had a deep mahogony body with a big creamy light tan head. The nose starts with roasted malt, some caramel and a smoky/nutty scent. It actually smell thick. The taste is mostly nutty, like hazelnut, a little toasted malt and a little sweet caramel. A thick body, pretty chewy. A very tasty beer, a bit too thick, but overall worth getting if you like the brown ales."
"pours a deep brown with little white head that fades into lacing. Smell is malty with a hint of carmel. Taste is good-malt with some chocolate and carmel-good balance and finishes clean. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Very smooth with little carbonation. The taste, mouthfeel and low alcohol content make this a very drinkable beer. This stands out to me as a superior english brown. It has a great character and good taste."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Solid, leaning more towards aggressive than subdued in carbonation. Again, what this beer would do to complement a burrito or tacos with a side of refried beans would be perfection. The low ABV gives this beer the opportunity for muchas bebidas over the course of a long, satisfying session. Very well done."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, small off-white head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, slight toffee, and caramel. The taste pretty much follows the nose malty with a nice touch of caramel. Light-Medium body. Very drinkable, a nice tasty nut brown ale, true to style."
"Another great beer from Troeg's. Very restrained british style, and not nearly as full as an American brown. but tasty overall, and quite a nice session beer. For only $7.99 a sixer, I think this is well worth the money, and I'll be buying it again. Although my scores may not be that high for this one, I do enjoy it quite a bit for the style. I could drink this all night at the bar, especially if it were on cask..."
"An aggressive pour yielded a 2-finger head that was tan in color. The ale itself looked the color of cola and did not have very much in the way of carbonation. Looked otherwise very good. The first smells hit me with a sweetish almost maple smell along with roasted malt. The taste was predominantly the roasted and burnt malts coming through. Watery mouthfeel and almost a watery taste and aftertaste. Reminded me a little of Guiness without being creamy. Hardly any bubbling going on in the mouthfeel. This stuff is fairly drinkable due to the low ABV and doesn't hang around too long. Would have preferred a little more body and less of a watery aftertaste."
"Poured a deep dark brown with a nice thick creamy head, this quickly faded but left about a half an inch of frothy cream on the top. Very nice lace, and lots of visible carbonation on pouring. Smell could have been a bit stronger, but what was there was caramel predominating, followed by hints of hazelnut and bread and yeast tones. Some residual grassy hints as well. Taste was rather odd when cold, but as it warmed a bit of nuttiness and a bit of a dry somewhat muted hoppiness came through. The consistency was very odd, had a slick, oily feel to it that was rather off, and could also feel a bit syrupy at times. Towards the end I seemed to have found a bit of a taste for it as it seemed to start to come off better. Would like to try this again, as it may have been a bad first impression. Could be a decent session beer when all is said and done."
"D - Despite the slightly weak body, still a good brown ale. Definitely let this one warm up a bit."
"""bad"" beer just a slightly above average example of the style."
"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a glass mug. Very dark brown color; almost black. The head was pretty much nonexistent which may indicate where I will be going with the rest of this review. The small head also had very fast retention which did not even yield a layering on the surface of the beer afterwards. Could not really smell anything. I know I had a couple, so to double check I passed it to my friend and she said she could not smell anything either. Therefore, I deduce a poor smelling beer which did not get me too excited for tasting it. The taste was okay, nothing too impressive. Tasted a little bit on the bland side which is nto what I was expecting from an English Brown Ale; I was hoping for a little sweetness or a nutty taste to it but neither appeared. The mouthfeel was pretty good, it went down rather smooth. Overall drinkability, I would have to go with not too impressed. The lack of any hint of character in taste or smell does not really make a good beer. I will try another one and update later, if necessary, but I was not too impressed with this brew."
"Drinkability: I could see myself having a few of these during an early fall barbeque. Not more than three or four, as this beer, while only 4.4% ABV still is pretty filling. I would buy this beer again."
"Don't dirnk and review."
"Mouthfeel is thin, with slightly above average carbonation. And much like water, the main flavor component of this beer, the drinkability is pretty high. Waste of 9 dollars. Should have gone with the oatmeal stout."
"D- This beer has a smooth lagered quality to the malt flavors but still has some nice complexity. It is very drinkable with no off flavors."
"Drinkability: Certainly a sessionable brew, and one of my new favorites of the style. Troegs continues to prove they know how to make some great beers."
"This stuff is very good.There were 3 of the beers in the sampler that Ide buy again and this is one of them.deff. a browen ale to try for anyone looking for a solid brew."
"Drinkability - Really enjoyed this brown ale overall, it was one of my first and the desire for more sweetness may just be a lack of understanding on my part of the style. I'd definetly have another and recco it to a friend."
"12oz. bottle poured a dark brown with very little head and some slight lacing. Smells mostly of roasted malts. Taste of a burnt malt chocolate with a bit of bitterness. Medium body mouth feel that seemed to thicken as it warmed. Very easy drinking beer I could have a few of. One of my favorites from Troegs and would purchase again."
"The nut brown ale poured a dark brown with nice lacing and a vanishing head. Aromas were raosted malts with a slight spice. Taste was very subtle; not much there but some chocolate notes coupled with bready malts. There was really no hop flavor to balance out the malts to create a cleaner taste. The mouthfeel was light, with a good amount of carbonation. The brew tastes watered down after each sip. With more flavor and and a crisper finish, this ale would be much better."
"Pours an impressive clear, red/brown color with a medium head of large tan bubbles. Aroma is grainy with a touch of sweetness. Light body, whole wheat bread with a touch of burnt chocolate malt. Little aftertaste to speak of. An enjoyable low alcohol session beer."
"Thanks for the bottle MuenchenerKindl."
"Very low ABV going on here, so this beer is very drinkable. Definately not the best beer from the Troegs boys."
"Overall, not too big of a fan of this beer. Love their other ones, but i found this lacking any great qualities. I cant help but keep thinking of doppelbock with this one. And i question if i got a bad bottle, but there are no traces of skunk or infection."
"I must try brown ale."
"The pour into my Sam Smith pint raises a creamy two finger light tan head over a dark ruby-brown body. Lacing is thick and sticky, head retention is lacking. The nose is full of molasses sweetness, and a bit of roast. Perhaps there's also a milk chocolate aroma. Really, there's not much, but it's very nice. The taste is very balanced between initial sweetness and ending bitterness. There are chocolate notes floating about, too. The mouth is medium, and the carbonation is quite low. I'd like a bit more fizz, personally. Overall, an easy drinker with some nice notes, but it needs more strength."
"Dnot great, but I could drink a few."
"This is a very drinkable American nut brown. Despite being watery, it remains an awesome session beer, especially during the fall months for me. It offers a pleasant mix of bitter and sweet. Nice effort by Troegs."
"not the greatest, but pretty good"
"It's pretty smooth and drinkable. Watery thinness detracts from its potential. On the ocassions I've had this, the bottom line has always been - an okay beer. Pretty much hits the style, though a bit thin. But, nothing noteworthy. There are plenty better, but also worse, brown ales."
"Thanks for letting me get my hands on this one Muenchenerkindl!"
"Troegs is a terrific brewing company and although this is not one of my favorite styles, this one is good. Pour a dark brown amber, with little head, disappates quickly. Has a sweet caramel smell with a little coffee. Nothing offensive about it at all, can be drank year round. Medium body with a sweet spicey taste. Not heavy in alcohol so many can be consumed in a session."
"Drinkability: Good, but not exceptional. Easy to drink and inoffensive, but there are better brown ales out there."
"Drinkability/Overall: falls disappointingly flat from its initial impression, has the nose of a nice New Glarus Fat Squirrel with the thin body and palate of a Newcastle. Should have called it Flat Squirrel."
"D - One of the best browns I have ever had. Very flavorful compared to most browns I have tried. I am really disappointed this is not available to me locally."
"Easy to drink, kind of standard but no real problems."
"Drinkability is good, nothing to complain about, but not a "" I can't live without this"" beer also. Prosit, MK"
"Overall: An extremely drinkable, smooth brew that is sure to please the palate. Can be light at times, but a good offering for the style."
"Very easy to drink, but not a lot of flavor. Would make a good session beer. Overall not a very memorable beer. Didn't taste bad, but not much to say about it."
"This beer is very good for the style. It is a deep brown with minimal head. The smell has caramel hints to it. The taste is smooth. There is no harshness in this beer. The mouthfeel is smooth with a nice semi-bitter finish. I could drink this beer again. A good beer from a brewer I wish was available here in NC."
"This brown ale is pretty smooth, medium-bodied, and easy to drink. Very tasty indeed."
"A deep brown with modest initial white head on top. Suitable carbonated, aroma of nut and molasses and licorice. Smooth and very malty drinkable. Little bitterness from hops. Nice transition beer. Good example of its style. Moderate alcohol appreciated as a session beer."
"Drinkability: At 4.4% abv, this is a good session candidate."
"I don't think session when I think brown ale, suddenly I wonder why, this is an extremely sessionable beer."
"Appearance is dark black, little head to speak of and clearly a filtered beer. Nothing special there - good enough. Same with the aroma, with hints of a sort of old baroom beer smell. Not entirely bad, per se. Just not a strong point. Taste is good, solid nut brown ale territory. Light & easy malt with a light sweetness. No real prominent taste to speak of but nothing adverse to the taste buds either. More of a session beer in taste than anything. More on the nutty side than fruity. Good solid mouthfeel considering the overall lightness of the beer. Extremely drinkable under almost any circumstances."
"Either the Troeg Bros have been tweaking, so my memory is faulty, but to me this is significantly better than it was a couple years back. Anyway, this is a highly enjoyable brown ale, one of several I've rediscovered lately."
"D- Nice stuff. Great session beer. Part of sampler pack."
"Drinkability- no carbonation that was that noticable not filling and veryy easy to drink. I would have another."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is medium bodied. The beer has a dry malty finish. The taste never really seems to let up. This is a very sessionable and enjoyable beer."
"very drinkable and enjoying...second to onlty nugget nectar as far as brews from this brewery that i have had....highly recommended"
"Many thanks to Enola for picking this up on his trip to TN."
"Drinkability: At 4.4% this would make a great session beer, could theoretically drink them all night but at some point I might want something with a bit more flavour and bite."
"Drinkability: A little lacking on flavor, but easy to consume. Nice session beer, great for relaxing. I could have a few more."
"This beer poured a deep brown color with a minimal white head into my pint glass. The aroma I get is of toasted malts with some slight sweetness to back that up. The taste is also nice and toasty, nutty and a bit sweet. This beer has a nice full body. After a few more sips I get some chocolate notes in the taste. Very enjoyable beer from Troeg's."
"Good creamy mouthfeel, if slightly watery. Bit of metallic flavour upfront, but it goes away quickly. Not much nuttiness at the start, but a pleasant malt character. Nuttiness and some chocolate notes show up more as it warms. Carbonation is a bit high for my liking. Overall, not bad, but not worth seeking out again."
"This is the best nut brown ale I can ever remember having. Highly drinkable and perfect for any time."
"There's a modicum of earthiness and nice flavor, but it's thin and rapid in nature, meaning a blink could cost you much of the experience. It's better than average, and it never offends, but it's like a shooting star, gone just as it registers. Still, it flows nicely, making it decently drinkable. It's by no means stellar, but it's good enough to not turn away."
"Pours a dark red-tinged brown, with a finger of foamy beige head, decent retention, and some nice lacing. Smell is a light walnut scent with just a hint of chocolate. Taste is more of the same, a nice gentle nutty roasty, a slight hint of chocolate, on the sweet side but balanced with the slight bitterness of the roast. Medium bodied with a smooth creamy mouthfeel. This is a really great brown ale, a wonderfully balanced and easy drinking session beer, definitely one of the best examples of the style I've sampled."
"If I had any friends in this God-forsaken town, I would invite them all over for a long night of telling lies, talking smack, and drinking Rugged Trail nut brown."
"Drinkability: The woman at the store I purchased from asked how I liked this style of Troegs, and I mentioned that I had not yet tried it. She explained that she particularly liked Nut Brown Ales and I suggested Hobgoblin. I thought this was even better; well balanced, tasty and as I would expect an English Nut Brown Ale to taste. Recommended from a great brewery (although I may be partial as a close resident to the brewery in Harrisburg; Hopback Ale is their masterpiece)."
"Drinkability: Nothing overly complex here; just one of the most drinkable browns you will encounter"
"-UF"
"The finish seems British from the get go as a Euro-style hop bite kicks off a walnut / chocolate finishing fade."
"This beer came a dark cola brown with some reddish orange highlights and a thin creamy white head. Smelled of roasted caramel and molasses malt with a slight sour coffee. Smelled intimidating sweet. Tasted of very sweet burnt caramel with a pervasive sourness. Finished clean with a touch of dark chocolate. Mouth feel was medium bodied with little carbonation. I¬ím a big fan of sweeter beers, but this was a bit much for me."
"The aroma starts out fruity and nutty with some sweet caramel. After a while, I detect a nice buttery aroma followed by a touch of alcohol. The taste is a nice blended malt flavor that is followed by a slight bitterness. I can also taste a small amount of warming alcohol in the aftertaste. Overall, this is a very nice brown ale which is one of my favorite styles."
"This is a solid nut-brown. Rather subdued, but not lacking in flavor¬óahh the power of moderation. The level of sweetness is nearly perfect and well-balanced to boot."
"Pours a dark brown with a weak head that never fully develops, but remains present for quite awhile leaving behind a touch of lacing. Aromas of nutmeg, salted peanuts, and smoke; definitely catches my interest. The taste is mild, at best, with a subtle nutty flavor that comes out slowly over time and blends with the roasted malts also present. The relative blandness of this beer is not a bad thing when paired with the right smoked/grilled dishes. A good beer to relax with, if you're in the mood for something simple."
"Final Thought: A clear step above Goose Island's Nut Brown Ale and this one may be of the best in the States..."
"Cheers!"
"Very british feeling, right down to the carbonation. Put this in a 500ml bottle and I'd be fooled. Quite flavorful and satisfying, without being burdened by loads of alcohol. It would make for an easy session. One of the best brown ales coming out of the US, I think. Not exactly a popular style, but I like it a lot. Good stuff coming out of this brewery."
"12 oz. with no freshness date. Pours a dark leathery brown with a 1 finger yellow/tan head that leaves some lacing but reduces to nothing by the end. Smells buttery and nutty with some gentle hops. It is chocolatey with coffee, green hops, and a mild bitterness with a medium body. Perhaps my least favorite of their offerings, but still a good, sessionable beer."
"Pours a medium-dark reddish brown with a medium-sized, off-white, tight head that quickly diminishes to a thick film. The smell is¬Ö wow¬Ö big like a stout, with aromas of chocolate, nuts, molasses, caramel and very light pine. The taste follows with more big roasted malts but not quite as big as the aroma. Milk chocolate, plum, butterscotch, light coffee and light cookie flavors with some brown sugar and herbal notes on the finish. It has a medium-full body, smooth texture and low carbonation. Another very good offering from Tr√∂egs that I would definitely buy again. This was one of the beers on tap at my wedding."
"regarding my mad elf review, hopefully a redo will be coming shortly. after trying it on tap, i think i might have rec'd a bad bottle. stay tuned, keep drinking troegs."
"Nut brown ales are not my favorite in general, but I guess if a table full of nut browns was in front of me, I'd reach for this one...mainly because it is so mild."
"D - It is alright. It is too mild to provoke much of a reaction. It is about what I'd expect coffee mixed with seltzer water to taste like. It is still fairly good. It would pair well with food, because it such a mild beer. I wasn't expecting extremes, but I was expecting a bit more."
"Pours an orange/copper brown with a thin head. Nose is soft with malt and just a hint of nuts. First sip is nice - with just a little hops if you go searching for them. Not too sweet, a little oak and walnut appeared late. An easy drinker, may have been better if I had let it come up in temp first, but average was all that kept ringing in my head..."
"This is a good English brown. It's dry and nutty, not too sweet, with just a hint of hops to keep you interested. I'd do this again, anytime."
"purchased as part of sampler pack. Poured a clear, deep copper color with puffy tannish head. Smell is toasty, with notes of chocolate and caramel. Taste is heavy on the malt, coffee notes, little hops noted. Finish is a bit dry, but not overly. Good refreshing beer."
"Thanks to mntlover for the bottle."
"Nice deep mahogany color-resembles a fine piece of furniture in color. Ok aroma-some caramel and slight coffee aroma. Rather sharp and bland flavor. Nutty tasting but somewhat acrid. Trace of maltiness Average body-a boost might bring the flavor up. Rather unimpressive overall. I want to say this is the first beer I had tried by Troegs more then 5 years ago and I wasnt impressed then. They can do better for sure. While this is an edit (07/19/07) from a slightly more postive review from 18 months ago I dont see this being worth a try, at least not for me."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle. Appearance is a very nice reddish-brown. Good initial head, but fades quickly. Decent, lasting lacing. Smells just like it tastes: malty. Rugged Trail has a strong malt backbone with little hops contribution (some aroma, but I don't really detect bittering). Taste is, not suprisingly, somewhat sweet and smooth -- and coupled with the relatively low ABV of 4.4%, this makes for a tasty and easy drinking brew. Should be enjoyable year-round."
"Pours a dark brown with garnet - ruby highlights. Short-lived off white head that left minimal lacing. Aroma of sweet malts hints of leafy hops. Taste is sweet malt, biscut, some toffee and caramel balanced with some sourness and a hop essence. This is a malty brown for sure. mouthfeel is thin, though what one would expect. Very drinkable. I really like this brew and will definitely buy again."
"This brew pours a rubied brown color with a small ring of head over top. The nose is caramel and slight toasted nut. Kinda weak. The flavor is okay. Roasted nut, slightly sweet, a little weak. The feel is thin to moderate, nothing really grabs me. Overall, an average beer. It doesn't grab me in any way."
"Overall, this is an okay brown ale. I'm not particularly fond of the nutty qualities and I really think that perhaps it is a bit too sweet for it's own good, but I would probably have it again were I to have the opportunity."
"12 oz. bottle, no freshness dating. Pours a clear cola-colored brown with a fluffy beige short-lived head. Some malty, earthy dry malt aromas with faint chocolate and caramel suggestions. No discernable hops in the aroma. Predominantly sweet, with some light chocolate notes and a faint, earthy nuttiness. Again, hops played hookie this day. Too spritzy and overcarbonated for its style, a little too burpy. Just a bit of earthy dryness, but almost not noteworthy. I'm guessing this beer was simply geared towards being a sweeter, less attenuated beer, not out of the realms of its style. Not bad, but nothing to email home about; good for lovers of the nut brown style. Can't say I'd call this one a sessioner though, even considering the reasonable ABV."
"Dark brown pour with a nicely foamy head. Looks really tasty! Smell is nutty and malty but not much else and very faint. The flavor itself is malty with hints of chocolate, tiny earthy notes, and nutty undertones. The same foam that makes it look so nice lends it a wonderful mouthfeel as well; it's velvety and almost feels like a nitro. A decent enough session brew if you're in the market for a nut brown, but the flavor's not bold enough to really set it apart."
"Pours a clear dark cola-color, with some ruby overtones. Head is a foamy 1-2 finger wheat color. It sticks around only briefly before fading, leaving litle lace as the beer is consumed. The nose is sweet dark malty, a bit of nuts or dark chocolate- really not a lot there. I like the way this tastes and drinks- It starts with sweet dark malt, with subtle but distinct dark chocolate accents steppng in. Only light carbonation, yielding silky creamy mouthfeel that's just a bit thin in the finish, hence a 4, not a 4.5. Thanks to fish311d for the opportunity to taste this one, just sorry it wasn't two."
"The smell is good with sweet roasty malt aromas. The taste is medium bodied with a light cocoa roasted flavor. Very flavorful with a nice hop balance. Overall a very flavorful but light enough and drinkable enough to be a great session beer."
"Thanks to Prostman for providing me the opportunity. Hard pour to get a half-finger light beige-colored head over a brown-orange liquid. Smells sweet with chocolate and a hint of nut. Tastes caramel, chocolate, mild nutty, and a hint of sour (roast grains?). Bitter from the hops competes with fine carbonation on my tongue (a bit of acidic forms). Later tastes reveal chocolate and some roast character that comes across as toffee-like. A bit more burnt grain than I like in my brown ales. The ending is dry, and is where the roast character makes itself most noticable. Medium bodied with a creamy quality usually found in oatmeal stouts. Moderately carbonated, but the carbonation that's present forms sharp fine bubbles on my tongue. The head quickly settled to a tiny ring around the glass and a minimum of lacing is present. A nice beer, a bit too roasty for me. More umph and color is all that's necessary to make this offering a dry porter."
"This beer has a dark copper color, but is transparent. There is not much head. Not much aroma, but what is there smells a little sour. Great nutty malt flavor. It¬ís sweet at first, then slightly roasted and nutty, then finishes with a bit of bitterness. Not too thick, low in alcohol, and a good, nutty flavor make this an excellent quaffing beer. I would definitely get this again."
"But this is an excellent example of the style, a beautiful rich nutty, toffee flavor with just that edge of roasted bitterness. Mild hopiness keeps it all together and provides wonderful balance, really lets the roasted malt come through."
"Pours a light brown, one-fingered head, fades quickly and leaves a little lace. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Deep, amber color. Malty nose. Starts with a light sweet, roasted coffee and finishes with a mellow malt/hop mix. $1.55 for a 12oz bottle from Vintage Cellar Blacksburg, VA."
"Overall-another fine ale from Troeg's, flavorful, dark, rich, and not overbearing even despite some bitterness. Not flawless but another great offering from Troegs,"
"Nice dark amber color with a head that doesn't stay for too long. The aroma is immediately striking, with hints of chocolate. The nuttiness doesn't set in until it touches your tongue, then permeates your mouth. It's got good flavor, that's for sure, though it feels a bit too watery. I would definitely try this one again if it were offered to me."
"Pours a very nice brown color with crimson tinges. A nice off-white head with a little lacing. Smells of chocolate and mocha with a nice spicy chai hint. That taste is amazing. Best tasting of the Troegs I've had. Exteremly nutty. Imagine chocalte covered nuts with hints at caramel and a very mild hop flavor. Perfect. Balanced very well and feels great in the mouth. As with all Troegs, quite drinkable. This is my favorite of all troeg's offerings I've tasted. Unbelievably nutty and chocolatey. Tastes unlike any other beer, and to me, being unique is the most important characteristic in beer. I love it. Thank you Troegs."
"Overall- a pleasant surprise. Brown Ale's aren't usually my cup of tea but this was a decent beer. Worth a try."
"Thanks to PIsskyNights for sending me this fine Brown Ale."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" tan head over the clear reddish-brown brew. Head is somewhat short-lived, with average lacing. Aroma is deeply malty, with strong nutty tones. Taste is as the nose portended, with nutty malts the menu for the day. Mouthfeel and drinkability both good. A nice representative of the style."
"Overall, I recommend you try this beer, but honestly, I know the Troeger boys can do much better, and have done much better...I'd love to score some mad elf if anyone has it!"
"A very nice brew..dark chocolate color with a pronounced deep malty aroma that is very pleasant. Taste is rich in malt with a carbonation click that accents the malt presence...light touch of hops in the finish...very nice. Mouthfeel is medium in body and defintely not an invitation to swig. Very drinkable, especially in small sips. Another nice offering from Troeg's."
"Taste is nice for a brown ale. Toffee, milk chocolate, roasted caramel, and a hint of Brazil nuts lend a dominant malt profile. Floral hops are undrestated, but provide a pleasant, bittering balance. I enjoyed this one, and the style is far from my favorite. This is a fine example of an English style, brown ale from one of the better, Pennsylvania breweries."
"Beer is good. Happy local beering."
"12 oz bottle, with no freshness dating. Poures a dark brownish amber, tan head, some minimal lacing. Sweet malty nose, sort of rustic in character. Malt, glorious malt carries the day here. Its sweet, smooth, nutty, vanilla notes and sticky in character. NIcely crafted Brown ale. Not the most exciting style, but this one is nicely rounded, smooth and somewhat warming."
"Taste: Comes across as creamy, yet still slightly watery up front. Middle is slightly sweet, with a pleasant nuttiness and charred dark malt notes. Finish holds coffee, and is relatively dry."
"this beer pours a dark amber color with a one inch head that quickly dissapears. this beer smells as malty as it tastes with a sour- bitter aftertaste that dominates. very little lacing as i sip this better than average brew. Again, maltiness rules the flavor of this beer with maybe a hint of smoke and walnut. Pretty average overall but, not my favorite style. Will try again on draft...if i can find it. maybe better?"
"Rugged Trail Nut Brown Ale is another good Troegs beer, but it falls short of very good. Even though I'd like to see a bigger body, the one that has been provided, as well as the lowish ABV, means that drinkability and sessionability are two of its biggest strengths."
"Pours a very dark brown, ever so slightly transparent--turning a reddish color as light passes through. Very little head, and what is there quickly disappears. Smells of coffee and roasted malts--a very nice and inviting aroma. Tastes mostly of roasted malts--a bit of coffee, and a bit nutty. Some hops come through in the finish. A somewhat unpleasant bitterness lingers. Taste is a bit disappointing compared with the very nice aroma. As it warms more of a smokey flavor comes through. Thin to maybe medium bodied, an alright beer, but nothing special."
"Overall, a somewhat uninspired brown ale."
"12oz. bottle: This one pours a nice brown color with a hint of red. A bit if a tan head. The aroma is quite nice: malty sweetness with a good nose of chocolate. The taste is fairly rich with flavors of chocolate and a hint of nuttiness. It is medium bodied. The hops are a bit lost but they balance the sweetness nicely. A good one!"
"Dark reddish brown, almost burgundy where light hits the corners, rather beautiful. head poured thick but only left an thin cream colored ring with slight lacing. Light carbination, not too flat, just perfect. Scent of coffee, toffee, caramel. The taste is smooth and lightly creamy, not heavy. There are the flavors you catch in the scent, the coffee and toffee. Maybe a bit of dried cherry in there. Very drinkable and goes down sooo easy. Very good brew, I am enjoying this one..."
"Tr√∂egs Rugged Trail Nut Brown Ale: pours a clear reddish brown. Not much head, and what there was dissipated quite quickly. Nice aroma, very coffee like, with hints of roasted malts. The taste is not dissimilar to the aroma, very prominent tastes of roasted malts. Some sweet malts linger on the palate. Light clean mouthfeel. Very nice."
"Great bier for after a hard days work"
"Highly recommend this one."
"Thanks to trbeer for continuing to ship me excellent east coast beers."
"A rather surprising find at a local haunt, this amber-coloured brew gave me a light beige-to-tan head from the onset. The aroma was righ of malts and nuts, with just a bit of sweetness mixed in (perhaps maple?). The flavor was rather smooth, and the nuts, again, worked their way into the flavor, as did some residual sweetness at the finish. A solid brew."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice dark roasted scent with some nutty and chocolate aroma. The taste is good. It has a rich black and roasted barley flavor with some nutty flavors. It goes down smooth and finishes dry with good mouthfeel. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a good brown ale. It has great malt character and an awesome nutty brown flavor. This is a fine sessions ale."
"Drinkability&Notes: Wow, this is a fantastic Brown Ale. Flavors are top notch, alcohol level is low enough to put a few of these away, Newcastle would do well to study this beer."
"The mouthfeel was light and smooth. The is a thinner bodied brown ale. The roasted nuttiness lasts softly on the tongue for several seconds. This is a nicely drinkable ale as the nuttiness is light and not overbearing."
"this brew was mildly deceptive...i'll tell you why at the end of this review, but let's just say the deception could have been avoided with a bit of patience. pours a nice brownish amber colour with a decent sized, tan head which could've hung around a bit longer, though it left a nice sticky residue on the glass. smells a bit thin a first: a little sweet, a little malt and a bit nutty, but give it a few minutes and you'll pick up some earth tones and some chocolate as well. the taste is more nutty and earthy than the smell and also has some burnt bread qualities to it. malt is apparent throughout and this one finishes burnt and dry. nothing amazing but one of the more complex and enjoyable brown ales i've sampled. the problem with this one was that i was so eager to try it i poured it immediately upon returning home from the store, where it has been sitting for a while in a cold cooler. let it sit out for 10 or 15 minutes or so and this one will be that much more complex. i actually had it rated a bit lower based on the first, cooler half of the bottle. as it warmed it certainly improved."
"Pours a deep brown with some reddish tint with not much head to speak of,the aroma is malty and sweet with some light fruitinessto it.Flavor had bready maltiness to it with some nice fruity estures with a light chocolate flavor in the finish,not your typical brown in my opinion neither nutty or real chocolaty but I think a real nice beer none the less."
"A nice clear brown-amber color, which, when roused, forms a light amber colored head. There is a malty biscuit type aroma that is accompanied by a bit of hop character as well. The taste is lightly sweet with biscuit notes that finishes with some toasty chocolate notes. It has some pleasing hop flavor as well, though this is quite restrained, and a bitter finish. Quite a good brown ale with some nice toasted malt flavors."
"The aroma has a hint of chocolate and there is a malty presence. Tastey hints of chocolate and maybe a bit of toffee aftertaste. There is a slight nutty taste and overall it is quite smooth. A very nice beer."
"First sip is sweet and malty with undertones of almonds and some caramel. Medium bodied brew, with a strange creamy texture to it. This actually reminds me of a dairy product and is a little strange. The brew has average carbonation and is very smooth. The finish lingers with a mild sweet flavor in my mouth. The mouthfeel is a little of a put off for me, but overall this beer is very drinkable and I think I could have a few more. Oh yea! I do have more in my brewers dozen pack!"
" Very crisp brew with a nice medium body. It is nice and smooth, and drinkability is excellent. The backbone is sweet, but not cloying, it is well balanced with some light roasty notes. Some nutty flavors are in there as well. This is an excellent session brew. It is not very heavy, but it does have a good amount of body and flavor."
"Drinkability: Another decent malty beer from these guys. Great beer to have on a crappy rainy day. Nice and hearty, would make a great session beer for the malt lovers among us."
"Dark brown beer with amber highlights. Head fell back quickly. Aroma of chocolate and slight nutty caramel aroma. Flavor is sweet caramel which dries out into a finish with lasting light bittersweet chocolate. The body is kind of watery and light. It is an easy drinking beer."
"Color is a dark reddish-brown, almost mahogany, with auburn highlights at edges of glass when held up to light. No head to speak of, just a tiny ring of foam around edge, and a thin film of foam at the center of the beer. No carbonation, no lace. Aroma starts out with dark, rich maltiness that lasts its way through the entire nose. Faint smell of hops emerges after agitation; otherwise almost entirely a sweet, dark malt scent with hints of toffee and perhaps coffee. (A scent of hop freshness starts to emerge as the beer warms.) Taste is thankfully not as sweet as some other brown ales. Coffee is much stronger as a flavor than a scent, as are dark, roasted nuts. Prominent flavor of toasted almond skins up front gradually gives way to a slightly creamy, mellower maltiness in the back of the palate that becomes more apparent as tasting progresses... Mouthfeel a bit thin; slightly syrupy around edge of palate with a nice near-creaminess in midpalate accompanying warming malt. Drinkability is good but I'd rather have one or two of these with dessert--I bet this would be awesome with white chocolate and macadamia nuts. Not my favorite from Troegs, but a fine beer."
"Though my favorite brown ales are the high-octane ones, for a low ABV brown ale, this is excellent. Much better than Newcastle! I'd likely have this one again."
"This beer poured out a very clear amber to light brown color. Topped with a small white head that dissolved quickly. There are some fruity notes in the aroma, along with bittersweet chocolate and buttery caramel. Chocolate and roasted grains come through in the flavor. Light malt body that really thinned out as the beer warmed up. Finishes clean and has some flavor but nothing there that knocks my socks off."
"I've had several Troegs beers now and I continue to be impressed....I think there are better Nut Browns out there but this one has to rank near the top of my list...I would purchase this again...but wouldn't seek it out.."
"Drinkability: As said before, this is a great session beer, it's great flavor, smell and low alcohol makes it a beer you wont get tired of, and it wont trip you on your way to the pisser."
"Pours a very deep brown underneath a huge creamy head. A powerful aroma of caramel and roasted malt first greets the senses. The first sip brings forth a roasted malt flavor with deep malty sweet caramel notes. The body is quite smooth and pairs nicely with a very mellow light bitterness flowing throughout."
"Color is a dark amber brown with very little head present. Aroma is slightly of toasted malt - no hop aroma detectable. Taste is initially slighlty sweet with some ale fruitiness, finishes malty with toasted hints - very little hop flavor and low bitterness. Nice, comparitively full mouthfeel for the gravity. A smooth drinking beer that I recommend for anyone who is a fan of the southern english brown ale style."
"Very dark brownish red ale with a nice looking foamy tannish head. Smell is mainly of english hops, nothing overpowering. Nice chocolaty taste, with a good coffee bitterness that make for a nice dry mouthfeel. Hints of hoppiness in the taste that go well with sweet chocolate maltiness. Nothing overpowering here, just a pleasant tasty brew that's quite drinkable. Nice job. One of the better brown ales i've had."
"I'm not ordinarily a fan of Nut Brown Ales but I have to say that this is an exception. Pours a great looking mahogany brown with a nice creamy head which doesn't last very long. Has a buttery caramel or coffee type flavor but without being overpowering. No unpleasant aftertaste. Hops are in the background but they're present nonetheless. Very drinkable - not at all heavy. Although this review is for the bottled version, I have also recently had the draft version and would have no changes to the above although, for once, I think I prefer the bottled to the draft by a very thin margin. Troegs has come through again with this product"
"I had this on tap while in Lancaster county this weekend. It was served in a strange glass, similar to a hurricane--not what I was expecting for a brown ale, but I attribute this to the fact that I had it at an upscale tavern that was pretentious and geared towards fine dining. The beer is a mahogany brown that almost looks red (not amber) in the light. There is a faint head that quickly subsides. The smells are nutty and burnt. The beer is incredibly smooth and mild, in the fashion of most brown ales. The beer also had a certain sweetness to it, while still offering tastes of burnt nut, almond, faint choco, and malt. The beer was suprsingly thin considering its character, and it had a very watery feel across my palette. This is not to say it was watered down, but it does have a very subdued feel with just enough flavor to keep the mouth interested. A very good brown ale, though I can't really say how it stacks up against the classic English Nut Browns, as my experience is limited. I'd have it again, especially in the late summer and early autumn as it would pair well with many seasonal nuances in foods and atmosphere."
"This brown ale is great! Troegs has done a nice job with the Brown Ale. Mild is the word for this brew. The smell is quite mellow with hints of raisins or dates. The head is thin but resilient, making its way down the glass and leaving quite a lacing behind. The taste has notes of chocolate and coffee. The hops are quite subdued and the malts are warm and mellow. The carbonation is very thin and that makes for quite a session beer. Rugged Trail feels very smooth in your mouth and cleanses the palate as it refreshes. It goes well with a lot of foods. At 4.4% it is quite drinkable and goes down great in any setting. Good representation of the Brown Ale style."
"Nice One Francisweizen."
"Translucent ruby-brown hue, tiny bubbly beige head that faded quickly¬Ö no lace either. Very inviting nose, nutty chocolate upfront with very mild sweetness and caramel influences at the end¬Ö a smidge one-dimensional. Relatively complex palate for a Brown ale¬Ö chocolate malts, spicy (but subdued) hops, nutty, distant caramel¬Ö tasty! The body is too thin, the carbonation is minimal and this combination creates a distraction in the overall enjoyment of drinking it¬Ö it is easy to drink, aside from chalkiness in the back of the mouth. Medium body. The finish is pleasant¬Ö the aftertaste is nutty chocolate. Bitterness grows as the beer warms, nice touch. The low abv is a key in making this beer work as well as it does¬Ö a solid Brown ale."
"This beer came to me a crystal clear mahogany/nut color that had an orange hue to it, and was well carbonated. It created a light tan/beige colored head that was fairly thick, dense and creamy. The foam left behind a faint lace behind that was spotty in areas. The aromas were fairly simple and light: roasted nuts and malt, flowers, and a light cocoa powder. Flavors had more of a dimension to it: roasted malts, light floral hops, nuts, fruit, some sweet malt (as it warmed and detected in the mid of the sip), cocoa powder and burnt chocolate at the end. It left a roasted chocolate nut flavor behind on the tongue. Light to medium bodied. This beer became nuttier and creamier as it warmed. It¬ís light alcohol content makes it a good session beer and it¬ís clean flavors keep it from getting boring if you are just sitting around and having a few with friends."
"A happily finished brown, ..no, wait, there's a few ounces left...Ah..."
"Pours a deep ruby brown tone with a thin but frothy beige head, and with each sip this beer leaves even patterns of lace around the glass. Aroma consists of a healthy serving of malted barley giving this ale layers of sweetness entwined with a nutty almond esque tone very nice appeasing aroma perfect in every sniff of this divine nectar. In the sip there are some dark roasts giving a harsh tone within the sweet nutty flavors dancing in this lightly hopped ale. Very clean finish a refreshing wonder for the style very well made beer from Harrisburg. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but with all of the well done flavors it doesn't detract from the overall score that badly. A definite session nut brown ale meant to be enjoyed one after another a couple at a time at 4.4% abv I could enjoy this beer thoroughly."
"-F"
"Thanks to Francisweizen for the bottle."
"Mmmm...and it's delicious. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but has a very nice, low-carbonated smoothness to it. Big flavors of nuts and mild chocolate notes, and a surprisingly dark roasty malt flavor. Quite impressive. A wonderful effort at the style..to me, its right up there with Rogue's Hazlenut Brown Nectar. Good Lord, my glass is almost empty!"
"Pours a dark, reddish brown, with a thin tan head. The head quickly fades to a thin ring of foam. The aroma is very nutty, and sweet, with a nice dark chocolate note. Maybe even a hint of roasted malt or coffee. The taste is very good, with a great roasted hazlenut taste. Also nice notes of coffee and chocolate. A bit of hop bitterness is present in the finish, but just to cleanse the palate. It is not a major player in the overall taste. The lingering aftertaste is like chocolate covered coffee beans. Just a touch of eathy graininess in the finish. The mouthfeel is solid, with just enough carbonation to liven things up a bit. The drinakbility is very good. Another fine brew from the Trogner brothers."
"This beer makes you slow down. Complex flavors, well blended."
"Well this is brown ale and that is the color it poured, a dark brown. It is meet with a small off white head on the top. The head faded and left very little lace. The aroma has hint of caramel and roasted malt and small hint of coffee. The taste has a nutty flavor to it with the hints of coffee and sweet malt. There is a very mild hint of hops on the finish. This beer is light and very drinkable"
"Quite nice chocolate nose with some fruitiness. Pours an amber brown color with a thing light brown head that is quite creamy and laces nicely. Chocolate and a sweetness are evident from the start with a roasted nuttiness coming out as the beer warms. Slightly slick, but medium bodied mouthfeel. Bitterness lingers on the side of the tongue for a while after each sip."
"This one poured out with a quickly fading medium tan head, over attractive dark reddish/brown liquid. Nose is a nice smelling blend of light chocolate and dry coffee aromas mixed with some malty sweetness...quite an appetizing mix. Taste is indeed nutty, with a tasty background chocolate character that changes to a malt based sweet note, with subdued hoppiness. Finishes clean and a bit dry on the palate. The easy-to-quaff character and relatively light alcohol content makes for a super session ale."
"A good session beer if you're looking for something a little earthy and sweet without being cloying, especially because of the low carbonation, which makes for a mellow quaffability and the low abv--4.4%, according to the website."
"Label states: ""Fuggle Hops"" & ""Toasted Amber and Chocolate malts"""
"Clear, wonderfully colored crimson-tinged brown body capped by a short, frothy, and light-tan head that holds really well and leaves some nice lace throughout the pint. The nose gently becons you with a firm mocha note that's laced with gently spicy hop notes. The flavor, however, is much softer with a mildly sweet chocolate and caramel malt that's only fringed with roastiness and very mildly infused with hop character. Similar in many ways to a German-style dunkle. Bitterness is kept to a minimum to accentuate the malt, but still balances. A soft note of cocoa lingers on the palate in a short and dry finish. Exceptional. A really quaffable pint that still offers generous amounts of malt character and some limited complexity."
"I love the look of a darker beer, and Troegs Nut Brown delivered this wonderfully. It held a deep brownish red color with a fairly thin head. Very little lace, however. I expected a well-developed nutty scent from this ale, but only a small hint of burnt nuts and malt filled my nostrils. I was a little disappointed, but the smell was still subtely pleasant. The burnt, nutty aspect was also present in the taste. While malts and hops worked intricately before swallowing, the nut character really becomes apparent immediately afterwards. The medium body makes for a nice mouthfeel, too. The Nut Brown drinks very easily, like a lighter ale, but encompasses all of the characteristics of a good nut brown. I'd recommend the Troegs to any fan of the style."
"Let me start by saying that I'm not a big fan of brown ales. Despite an appetizing name, most do nothing or worse for me. This one from Troegs though is exceptional. There's a lot going on and it finishes with a wonderful just-right hoppiness. Not too big, not too small, just right. Who's been sitting my chair?"
"Slightly brownish copper color with nice head and lace. Smells somewhat mute, but fresh.  Clean tasting with nice hop presence and slight toasted almondy character. Very refreshing with a alcoholic finish."
"Wow, another really fine example from the two brothers at Troegs. First off, I am not a big fan of brown ales, but this one might just be the one to put me over the top. Pours a rich amber-brown, with a full tan head that never quite goes away. Smells of hints of chocolate, a bit of nuttiness, and a tangy, fresh, Fuggles hop aroma. Initial taste is Fuggles, followed by a smooth roasted/toasted malt and chocolatey sweetness. Finish is nutty and smooth. Really, really nice beer."
"Very good."
"The beer is dark ruby with a medium beige head that has good retention.  There's a small amount of nuttiness on the nose with a little caramel malt too.  Taste is pretty clean.  I get some faint notes of nut, chocolate and caramel malt.  Some decent hop notes as well.  Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel.  Decent brown."
