The nose comprises lightly-funky wheat stuck in an old, semi-dried pool of maple syrup. The taste holds notes of old maple syrup, dry toffee, light brown sugar, light cocoa powder, and a twinge of sweet biscuit. There's a vague sense of candied orange peel throughout, but it never settles long enough for me to get a good enough idea of its existence. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick, fluid feel. Overall, a weak bit of ""English-style"" sweetness that doesn't meld well within itself, much less on my tongue.","TMoney2591","Mar 09, 2013"

3.5,2.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Slight crackle in the head, tall and bubbly. Reddish glow in the clear brown color. Hint of malt in the aroma, with a side of leafy, woody hop and mild fruitiness. Wet body--we considered saying thin, though the semidry malt character took its time coming around and dropped a pleasant toasted graininess on our taste buds. Hint of caramel goes well with the vague fruiti- ness and faint kiss of alcohol. A content party of flavors on the palate, it's hard to put this up against other Nut Brown Ales though. A worthy effort.","BeerAdvocate","Apr 06, 2011"

The color was darl amber / brown with a white head and some lace. The nose was a missing, nothing to report. The taste was good, a nice touch of maltyness helps this beer. The mouthfeel was good and I certainly could do a Session with this beer.","WoodBrew","Apr 04, 2011"

3.57,5,3,3.5,3,3.5,5,"12oz bottle purchased at Shaw's in Windham, NH. Pours a crystal clear copper-brown body with a thin film of short-lived off-white head. Hints of chocolate, coffee, nut waft from the aroma. Sweet maltiness hits the tongue with coffee, caramel, chocolate notes toward the finish. Light and effervescent in mouthfeel, combining with subdued and balanced flavor to make this a refreshing and drinkable beer. Cleaner and more of an easy drinker than just about any other brown ale I've had. This beer straddles the fence between being too robust and flavorful to compete with the crisp simple spring seasonals of the world and being too light and crisp to be a true brown ale but manages to avoid both. A welcome distraction from the light crisp simple spring beers out there.","MrHurmateeowish","Jan 19, 2011"

3.92,15.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Mud Slinger has the same over-moulded, far too transparent bottle that the rest of the Red Hook line seems to have, with the stylized wheat and what must be a series of conifers from their logo. Be beer is a deep burgundy, with a darker tan head that remains for a while. Mud Slinger smells malty, hops, and just a hint of nuttiness. It's lightly sweet, with just the right amount of hops to the malts. The mouth feel is lightly carbonated, chewy and viscous. The slightly bitter aftertaste from the hops is the last thing on your palate. Honestly, the flavour could be more nutty, since it aspires to be a Brown Ale, and the finish keeps this otherwise good offering from being great.","mrkc","May 09, 2010"

2.43,-28.5,3.5,3,2,2,2.5,"There is really not a whole lot going on here. First thing that came to mind was a strawberry fruit smoothie, not usually a good thing for a nut brown ale. Light malts are pushed to the background by a light fruity flavor, which really implies it has no strong flavor aspect at all. Yea, there is some hop bitterness on the finish but again it is not that hard to stand out against the totally unimpressively light malt body, flavor and mouthfeel. This was an impulse six-pack purchase a couple days ago and I am already thinking how to dispose of the remaining four bottles...I am sure someone will drink them but it sure as hell wont be me.","twiggamortis420","Mar 20, 2010"

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. This is a nice mouthfeel. Overall, this beer is everything I have come to expect from Redhook....mediocrity.

Smell of malt, caramel a little molasses and nutty. Taste is woodsy with the caramel malt having a low hop to it and there is something else there that I just can't put my buds on, but leaves a cloying.
