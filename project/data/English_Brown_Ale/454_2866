Pours lightly hazy reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, cocoa, brown bread, light nuttiness, roasted malt, and floral hop earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of caramel, brown sugar, toast, chocolate, dark bread, light nuttiness, roasted malt, light raisin, and floral hop earthiness. Slight earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toast, chocolate, dark bread, light nuttiness, roasted malt, and floral earthiness on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and robustness of malty flavors; with hardly any cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy, lightly slick, and earthy mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice brown ale. Good balance and robustness of flavors; and very smooth to drink. A pleasantly enjoyable offering; though not as nutty as I would expect given the nut brown title.","superspak","Jan 28, 2013"

The taste is much sweeter than I had expected from a "nut" brown ale. It seems to lack the toasted, nutty character that one might expect from such an ale. There really isn't much of a hop presence to speak of either. It's not a bad beer, just difficult to classify in that it doesn't really have any discernable qualities about it.

3.15,-8.4,3,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Cloudy dark brown with lots of particles floating around , small foamy tan head that leaves a some lacing in my glass, roasty nutty-bready aromas. Nutty caramel flavors, finishes on the sweet side. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel, a decent brown.","maxpower","Aug 13, 2004"
4,16.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Picked this one up in a recent mixed six pack kick. Although I'm not a huge fan of brown ales, I thought that I'd give it a shot. It poured with an absolutely massive, creamy, off-white head, which didn't dissapate over time. Aroma is full of malts. There is a slight nuttiness to the flavor which balances well with a slight cocoa-ish malt taste. Not overly rich but this means the beer could be a good session brew. Nice medium body is also present. Worth a shot in my opinion.","soper2000","Mar 21, 2004"
3.7,7.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Poured a nice deep brown color with a light brown head and decent lace. Smell is a nice roasted malt. Taste is also a nice roasted malt, with nutty overtones, slight coffee. Mouthfeel is perhaps a bit dry with a medium heaviness. A nice alternative when a porter is a bit much. Good drinkability for a cool evening. A fairly simple brown ale, but done right.","sabrills70","Feb 29, 2004"
3.25,-5.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,3,"A decent Brown, easy to drink but not particularly exciting. Malty aroma with a hint of citruicy hops. Red brown in color, with a thin tan heat that quickly recedes to nothing. Flavor is good if not overly engaging. Malty and a touch sweet with a hint of caramel. Hopping is noticable without standing out too much.","Sixpack595","Feb 27, 2004"
3.83,11.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a dark amber, clear liquid with a nice off white foamy head. Good lace on the glass as the brew disappears. The smell is somewhat of a sweet caramel, with a hint of a toasted nuts. Tasteis a nice, nutty flavor, with some sweetness, and a slight hop bitterness. A good toasty flavor comes out in the end. Decent mouthfeel, and pretty drinkable. There is nothing that really blew me away about this beer, but then again nothing that would drive me away. A good session brown ale.","Bierguy5","Feb 07, 2004"
3.56,3.5,4,3,4,3,3.5,"Alas, the beer is a bit thin, and for some reason I can taste the alcohol a lot more than I'd expect for a 5.4% ABV brown ale.","jahred","Dec 12, 2003"
3.95,14.8,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Mild lemon and lime bitterness and a taste of pear bandy round out the authentic Nut Brown style.","BeerResearcher","Dec 12, 2003"
3.53,2.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A bronze body is topped with a very full off-white head. Decent lacing from the residual and lots of very nice aromas come from the rich malting. The nut sense is there along with some decent fruit notes as well. The somewhat thin body gives nice sweet malt flavor and the fruit comes into the taste as well as it did in the smell. Good drinkability.","AtLagerHeads","Nov 07, 2003"
3.53,2.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a nice deep brown as one would expect. Aroma was malt with some nutty notes along with a faint hint of roasted barley. Head was thick and off white in color. Taste was mainly caramel with a nut finish highlighted by just a touch of bitterings. Felt a little bit weak in the mouht, beer seemed a little thin. For some reason the balance of malt, nut and bitter just didn't seem to work for me. Decent beer but nothing to truly seek out.","CRJMellor","Jul 10, 2003"
3.23,-6.1,4,3.5,3,3.5,3,"Overall, a slightly better than average example of the style. While not horrific, there are a number of better brown ales to be found and savored.","Boilermaker88","Mar 10, 2003"
3.41,-0.9,4,3,3,3.5,4.5,"Nothing overwhelming about this brew. Pretty solid and well balanced. Has a nutty flavor (walnuts) along with some caramel. A bit of hops that seem to provide little flavor in the beer. I don't notice any alcohol taste in it. Pretty ordinary but easy to drink and still tastes good just not great.","granger10","Mar 08, 2003"
3.68,7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"It's pretty murky brown in color and the head is tan and medium sized. The aroma is a little bit of nuts and caramel. Flavors are smooth and pretty enjoyable....nutty caramel, and some hop character in the finish. Seemed a little overly sweet at times, and not well balanced. It's pretty enjoyable though, worth a try, but there are many better nut brown ales out there.","AudioGilz","Jan 08, 2003"
3.92,14,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"This beer pours a nice brown color with virtually no head and no lacing on the way down the glass. The aroma is a pleasant malt with hints of nuts. The flavor was a smooth maltiness with hints of chocolate and nuts. Like most brown ales I've had it isn't very heavily hopped and would probably benefit from more of a hop flavor. Overall a good beer, but there are better.","darklager","Jan 02, 2003"
3.5,1.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear dark brown with a thin but persistant head that produces some lace on the glass. Nose is buscuity and nutty... predominantly malt, but with a bit of herbal hop backing. Flavor is malty, with bread, nuts, and a backing touch of coffee. Finishes with a bit of hop bitterness and a slight alcohol flavor. Has a meduim body and low carbonation. This is an average or slightly above average brown ale.","zerk","Dec 15, 2002"
3.45,0.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,2.5,"Moderately carbonated reddish-mahogany liquid, crystal clear with small bubbles forming a thin beige head which tends to stay around. Nose is dominated by chocolate, raisins, and prunes, similar to a strong ale or barleywine. Malty sweetness and mild flavor hops gives way to cocoa and round english hops in the wet finish. Very little astringency, and a somewhat firm, syrupy mouthfeel. Not being a big fan of American style brown ales, I was pleasantly surprised by the complexity of this beer, however I would much prefer Bell's Best Brown over any other beer of this style.","Mitchster","Dec 12, 2002"
3.83,11.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Deep mahogany with a creamy light tan head that holds well and keeps a very nice collar throughout the glass. The nose expresses a sweet cocoa-ish maltiness and a floral hoppiness. The body is medium with a very fine carbonation that caresses the tongue. The flavor consists of a semi-sweet chocolatey malt that's well infused with floral and lightly citrusy hop flavor. It becomes sweeter with more cocoa-ish & toffee notes as it warms in the mouth, but they're quickly pushed aside by a rising, solid bitterness that ushers in a dry finish. More grassy hop flavor lingers in the finish. Very nicely balanced with the malt and hops working together but also appearing seperately throughout the tasting. Well done. I found it more enjoyable as it warmed and bitterness gave way to more of the sweetness of the malt. Definitely an American brown ale.","NeroFiddled","Nov 09, 2002"
3.34,-2.9,3,4,3,3,3.5,"Part of and Arcadia sampler: This was a pretty good nut brown, poured a dark brownish-amber with virtually no head or lacing. Strong nut aroma. Flavor was not very rich but was nutty with some malt. Lightly bitter and nutty finish. A better-than average brew.","Dogbrick","Beers"
3.4,-1.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"The beer pours a nice somewhat murky deep ruby red, satisfactory beige head, with decent lace. Nose is malt, slight hints of roasted grain, very light nut-sweet tones also noticed. Begins malt sweet, the top thin, the finish is discriminatingly hopped and discerningly acidic, the aftertaste dry, and long lasting. Drinkable, but pretty much an average Nut Brown, but then thats nothing to get upset about.","Gusler","0"
3.43,-0.3,3.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"A very enjoyable brown ale.  Pours out to a very dark brown with a light nutty caramel taste.  The hops don't overpower this, but really make it finish nice.  I could see making a session or two or three...out of this one.","proc","0"
