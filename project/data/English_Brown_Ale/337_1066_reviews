"Overall:  This feels a bit of a hybrid of an English pale ale and a brown ale.  There is a nice balance of floral hop bitterness upfront and finished with a good roasted character.  This is a pleasant beer thats sort of a catch-all.  This could work in a wide variety of situations whether you wanted something bitter or malty and this could pair with a lot of different foods."

"Had this on tap at the brewery. Had a decent light brown color with a short head. Not too bad for a spring beer. Decent flavor with decent body. Not too much flavor. Goes down easy and was very nice to drink. But nothing too spectacular as I was expecting more."

"O-great flavor, great balance, and a good beer"
"O: My favorite brew SO FAR from Saint Arnold, and probably my favorite beer to date. It isn't bad chilled, but you get a much more ""rounded"" experience after it warms slightly."
""
""
""
"Overall: I am not really a fan of browns personally, but this one is ok. Not really anything special in my opinion."
""
""
"O: Solid brown ale, nothing especially great or earth-shattering, but very good beer to try if you come across it, I wouldn't target this as a must buy"
"It's a very good beer."

"Malty and bready, really makes me recall why they call beer liquid bread. Nice sweetness with a dryer than expected finish."
""
""
"Overall, an average representation of an English brown ale. Worth a try, I'd pick it up every now and then."

"Poured from the bottle, the beer was a murky brown color with a slightly off-white head. The aroma was a slightly tinny, malty scent. In others words, it smelled kind of like the inside of a brewery. The initial taste was a smooth malty sweetness with note of chocolate and toasted nuts. The aftertaste was a slightly sour wheat with a medine-like quality at times, that stays nicely on the back of the throat. The moderate thickness and low carbonation aided the staying power that was even equipped with a slight warming sensations. Overall, this is a pretty middle-of-the-road brown ale. Nothing is spectacular about it, yet it is very drinkable."

"Even though the appearance is very average, I really like the taste of this brown ale. It manages to be fairly dark and sweet without having an overpowering taste of chocolate or coffee. Might be going into my regular rotation."

"nice rich milk chocolate sweetness was coming through and really sweetining it up. There was then some hints of caramel malts in the back coming up and really letting you know this was a sweet little brown ale. The next flavor rocking on the nose was some subtle coffee notes and tons of earthy grains. sugary caramel and some light chcocolate notes are predominant here, with a nice touch of earthy grains making up the backround very nicely. Somel ight hints of wood and vanilla come through as it warms up and really deepen the profile, while keeping it sufficiently light. The finsi hwas dry as could be at first, but no hint of hops at all, a very sweet dry finish"

"Smell is like a caramel like and sweet. The taste is malty with a hint of maybe coffee or chocolate. Feels very smooth and rich as it goes down."

"O- This is a very nice beer overall and highly drinkable! The alcohol is non existent, with great flavor & aroma. This is a very nice cozy beer that could be greatly enjoyed on a cold night watching the game! I will look for this next time I'm in the States, and I give this my recommendation!"

"Overall: A very light brown ale that can only be fully appreciated when you understand the region it comes from. Houston is damn hot, and most of the year it is really hard to drink a heavy beer. So this is a brown ale that is not very heavy, and actually very refreshing. You could sit out by the lake on a 90 degree summers evening and knock back a few. There are very few other beers with this kind of taste that can be enjoyed like that. So, well done Saint Arnolds, you made a damn good brown ale."
"Figured this would be a good brew to accompany the inaugural episode of the new season of Breaking Bad. Dunno why. It pours a clear garnet-russet topped by a finger or so of light cream-white foam. The nose is pretty weak, barely comprising light maple syrup and brown sugar. This is a bit of a disappointment. The taste amps up the aforementioned maple syrup and brown sugar and adds a light touch of cocoa, light molasses, green apple, toffee, and a hint of roasted malts. Things have definitely improved from the smell. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a pretty smooth feel. Overall, a very nice brown, something I wouldn't mind sipping on regularly if given the chance."
"Saint Anrold brown ale poured a ruddy brown in my tulip glass, the body of the beer is visually dense, so I could not see any carbonation. The head was about 2/3 inch tall and off white. The smell is of toasty and nutty malts. As I taste it I first get that roasted flavor followed by some nuttiness, the finish includes a good bit of earthy hops. The mouthfeel is medium, and carbonation was present but not aggressive."
"Overall-Saint Arnolds seems to be doing big things. DR11 was great, DR9 is becoming a fall seasonal in a bomber, and their adding a hefeweizen. On that note, the Brown Ale is nothing special, but is very reasonable and easy to get. Could definitely drink 4 or 5 of these when I'm in the mood."
"D â€“ Tasty brown ale but not overly sweet. Nice malty bodied with little hop bitterness. I would drink this brew again and would recommend it"
"This beer is a little on the sweet side bit still enjoyable and well balanced."
"Poured from a bottle with no freshness date into a tulip glass, this holds a semi clear dark amber color that reaches for brown. Sweet malt with notes of lightly roasted nut and the sugared candyesque backbone I've found common with other Saint Arnold beers fills the nose here. With regards to taste, this carries the roasted malt character of a brown ale but has a distinguishing sweetness that separates it from others I've sampled. Perhaps that's characteristic to the brewery's yeast of choice...All in all, this is a quite tasty and drinkable bright flavored treat with a malt sweet finish. Cheers!"
"D - This is quite the sessionable beer. Has a very balanced profile mixing sweet, roasty and bitter flavors. Everything seems to blend together really well. Overall impression is that of smoothness. I can't really say that I think this is truly an English brown ale...color is off, hops are off. Seems to be a hybrid of a couple of American interpretations of style. All this being said - I like this beer quite a bit as an everyday drinker. Well done."
"Overall, an interesting brown ale. Very hoppy. Kind of drinkable, but I was a bit surprised with this one."
"D - Drinkable for an ale but still couldn't have to many and be comfortable. Alcohol over 5% but not a big factor for me in having another."
"The body was medium-light, none too thick. The carbonation was lively, keeping things moderately interesting. It's certainly an easy to drink pleasant beer, but it could use some extra spunk."
"M/D: Didn't wow me with big flavors, but this went pretty good with bacon and eggs."
"Pours a clear, light orange-brown with a thin tan head. Smells of roasted malts and dried fruits. Taste is a light grape flavor up front, with a toasted bread middle and a earthy hop finish. Mouthfeel is good, low carbonation. Good drinkability. A bit lighter roasted flavor than many brown ales, but I would drink this again."
"My motto: Beer is like food. You don't want the same thing everyday and you can't live without it."
"Overall: A simple and decent brown ale. I'd suggest grabbing one if you see it."
"Wow, this beer is really...average. Actually, compared to most other brown ales I've had, it's below average. I spent a few days in Houston, and the beer scene in TX seems pretty lackluster. Despite the fact I loved the Divine Reserve #5, I think that the warm TX whether tends to ""lighten"" the popular craft beers produced there. That thought neatly explains this particular beer. It looks and smells a lot like a lager, but does have some dark roastiness that tastes like caramel and molasses and brings it into line with other brown ales I've had. Mouthfeel is a little light and watery."
"Pours a clear light brown color with a white head which quickly dissipates. the aroma is toffee, caramel malt and a light nuttyness. The flavor is light caramel malts, light roasted malts, some nuttyness and a light hop character. The overall flavor is pretty sweet. Light mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Pours an amber brown (not a deep, dark brown I was expecting), with a thin tan head. Foam dissipates quickly leaving a small ring around the edge of the glass. Smells of roasted malt, caramel, honey sweetness. Similar flavor, sweetish caramel malt, a touch bitterness to balance at the end. Lots of carbonation and bubbles, but not enough to maintain a head. A bit tingling on the tongue. Pretty smooth, easily drinkable. Not a bad beer, just not what I was a ready / hoping for when compared to some other brown ales."
"D: relatively easy drinking, but points off again for the lack of flavor spoiling my potential enjoyment of this brew."
"I would enjoy this beer again, and I am happy to say that Saint Arnold is up on the top of my favorite Texas Brewers."
"Drinkability: not my favorite style of beer. I didn't enjoy this one."
"very drinkable"
"Another accurate representation of its style from Saint Arnold. I really like what this brewery is doing."
"D - Smooth and drinkable. Not a bad beer, just a bit different than I expected."
"After a nice smell from this beer, the taste did not disappoint. A slight bit of toasted malt breaks through the beer, giving it the brown ale taste. Not overpowering at all, the beer is light and goes down smooth."
"Pretty good drinkability all in all. Has pretty good flavor, isn't too high in alcohol content, and actually left me wanting another. Not the best brown ale but a pretty interesting interpretation I would have to say."
"D: All in all, I will keep this local favorite on hand for most guests as it is a people-pleaser."
"This seemed just a tad more hopped up than your traditional English Brown but I didn't mind in the least, as it brought a nice spiciness and needed balance to a fairly malty profile. I enjoyed this."
"Had out of a Chimay glass. Pours kind of an amber-brown. Lighter than I had hoped. Smells like caramel slightly and a lot of earthy, metallic hops. There's a bit of that caramel flavor when you taste it a long with some brown sugar like sweetness. The English hops flavor cleans it up nice. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I'd hoped, but that's just nit picking. Of their year round offerings this is probably my favorite."
"Toasty and nutty this brown is, with a good balance of hop bitterness. The flavor profile on it is not really doing it for me though. I want my browns to be chuggably smooth, a bit on the sweet side and chocolaty. This beer is none of that. It feels a bit rough around the edges. It's not bad by any means and is a well crafted beer, but there are many better browns out there that are more to my liking."
"Verdict: Saint Arnold Brown Ale is just a little thin for me, I'd love to see a little more oomph in the malt backbone. But, that being said, this is still a tasty and sessionable little brew well worth a try."
"Overall im very pleased with this one, and for a brown ale, I would definitely pick this up again as it is one of the better english browns I have had."
"Once again, not awful, but nothing I would drink again if there was something else decent available."
"Pours a clear reddish-brown clear colored body, with a big creamy off-white colored head, with good lacing, and lasting. Has a somewhat nutty aroma, some hops. Okay aroma. Nice malty nutty taste. Tasty."
"Very nice. Atmosphere is ok, but a solid distinctive nose does stand out. Good balanced flavor, and a subdued feel. Good quaff."
"Overall another great beer from Saint Arnold's. This reminds me a lot of their Amber Ale, except with a caramel flavoring. Good beer."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, slight smoke, roast. The taste is sweet, malty, slight smoke/roast. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew."
"Drinkability: Overall a pretty good beer. I wouldn't mind having more, but not something I would go to regularly. Seems like it would be a good session beer or something good to have with dinner, not necessarily a one-off drink like I had, though. A worthy beer."
"Overall, very drinkable and goes down smooth. Great session beer. Browns don't have the blow you away flavor like a hop bomb but they do a lot with what they have. This is a great example of the style. Recommend. Worthy of a sixer couple times a year."
"Brown Ale, especially with respect to flavor, is on the light end of the style spectrum. A little more chocolate malt might have made it better, but it's hard to argue with the beer that Saint Arnold has created. Under the cap: 'Mashtronaut'."
"Don't really think I'd hunt this one down again. glad to have tried it, but would recommend Troegs rugged trail."
"Drinkability is good on this brew. I can say I have enjoyed every brew from these guys that I have tried so far."
"D- Drinks quick and easy, but not much to savor"
"Pours a dark amber that has an bright orange tint when held up to the light - doesn't look much like a brown ale really. The head is small and short-lived and leaves a ring with no lacing. It doesn't smell much like a brown ale either with a dominant candy apple sweetness, very fruity with little dark malt or hop aroma at all. Super sweet taste as well with more caramel and toffee than the aroma suggests. There is a hint of hop bitterness in the finish as well, though not much. The mouthfeel is creamy and medium-bodied with good carbonation. This is a very unique take on a brown ale though it's probably not one of my favorites."
"Pours a clear dark amber, almost brown with a thin white head that is stingy. Aroma is of chocolate malts, and some citrusy hops. Smell is really balanced between hops and malts. Taste shows more malt than hops with some cocoa and some caramel with a orangey, grapefruity hop bite towards the end. Mouthfeel is creamy/oily body is medium to thin. Decent session brew, looks a bit light for a brown ale, but drinks great."
"M/D - A think light to medium bodied feel. Decent carboantion. And decent brown, but nothing spectacular."
"Not a terrible beer but one that falls short of interesting. Easy to drink and enjoyable on a warm summer day but not one I feel compelled to buy again."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not one of the better brown ales that I've had. There are definitely several others in the style that I would choose first."
"Pours a ruby-copper color with an off-white head that dissipates slowly leaving minimal lacing. Aroma of hazlenuts, caramel and malt. Taste to match, quite malty with a little bit of hop bitterness present. Finishes slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is slightly heavy with decent drinkability. Good example of the style, just not one of my favorite styles anymore as I tend to prefer the hoppier beers."
"Taste/mouthfeel: Lots of malty caramel sweetness but not much of the toasted flavors that I normally associate with brown ales. Mild malty sweetness is present throughout without a lot of change in the finish. This is a pretty simple brew, but it's not half bad."
"D: Vary tasty beer. Sweet tasting with nothing really overly strong to chase people away. Everyone should be able to enjoy this beer."
"D : Easy to drink but it's not one that I would really drink much"
" This is a very off-centered brew but it is also unique."
"D - This is one of those beers that I could drink all night it has a good taste thats easy to drink worth having sometime"
"Pours mapled, ruby brown with light tan head. Smell is carmel, hints of sweet orange, a nutty almond comes through as well. Taste is carmel, some woody, nutty flavors touch the palate right as a very nice, enjoyable orange citrus finish takes over. Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Very nice english brown ale. Great sessionable brown."
"Pours a deep copper/brown color, bright white head. Nice lacing. Has a very bready, caramel smell. Taste is nice and malty, not much hop presence. Mouthfeel is slightly fizzy to start and finishes somewhat dry. Not overly complex, this brown is very drinkable."
"I do not buy this as much as the other saint arnolds."
"Super drinkability, near perfect, a dang good brown!"
"Pretty average overall. I use to really like this. I tried it again recently, and either my tastes have changed or the beer has. Worth a try, but not very exciting."
"Smooth creamy mouth adds to the drinkabilty. I liked it!"
"D - This beer has become a staple in my collection it is a solid beer that I can enjoy anytime and it is something that I have been able to get my shiner drinking friends to enjoy."
"This will be a brown I reach for when I'm in the mood, for sure."
"Pours out a dark copper much like an ESB with a sizeable head that fizzles out to being thin, but leaves some nice lacing. I get minimal aromas of nuts and chocolate with mostly just a vague ""sweet"" smell. Has the typical weird Saint Arnold overbearing fruitiness. Honestly this tastes like a really fruity ESB with a little added chocolate malt and a halt put on the hops. Finishes dry but then feels cloying in the aftertaste. Weird. Mouthfeel is not too weighty but the carbonation needs to ease up a bit. This isn't horrible, jus kind of wonky for a brown ale."
"Drinkability: An easy going down drinker. I only had a six. If it was local I would probably purchase this again. I am glad I tried it."
"St. Arnold Brown Ale is brewed using five different malts and three different varieties of Pacific Northwest hops. It is a good tasting brown ale with a good deal of complexity. But a few small problems prevent this beer from being better. It is a little lighter than I prefer and IÂ’m not too crazy about the traces of diacetyl flavor. Take these two small flaws away and you would have a world class product. Still, St. Arnold Brown is a beer worth trying. It offers a nice assortment of flavors and the chocolate malt flavor is enjoyable."
"If I said it was brown, you'd be shocked I'm sure. But it is. Some gold & red tints, but brown it is. The head is tan & thin. The smell is strangely....lacking? Maybe I've got it too cold but I get nothing but a thin, metallic smell. The taste is much improved over the smell. Tastes of hazlenut, with a dry finish. Not much sweetness in there at all, really. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but has a nice smoothness to it. Like a summer silk, really. Or not really, but who's counting? Drinkability is very good. The taste is well balanced & the alcohol low enough (at least by my Belgian-favoring standards) to qualify this one as a session beer in my book."
"D - I do enjoy this brew, but they never have it on tap at the brewery so I'm stuck to drinking it out of the bottle. Plus none of the bars here ever carry this one, typically just the amber, lawnmower and seasonal, which is disappointing because this is a fine brew"
"Closer to an Amber Ale than a Brown Ale. Fairs well, but could do with a bit more kick or complexity."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a dark brown, with no head, and very little lacing. The aroma is slightly nutty, with the flavor, very much the same. Nice medium mouthfeel, making the beer very easy to drink. This is a great example of a brown ale! Definitely a session ale."
"Drinkability: I could knock a few of these back. easy to drink"
"Pours kind of a hazy reddish brown with a tan head. Aroma is carmel like malt flavor. Taste is sweet malts, carmel and some toasted malts. Hop bitterness isn't prominant. Medium mouthfeel, noticeable carbonation. Drinkability is good, I enjoy this one but there are better brown ales available."
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance is pretty good, maybe just a little on the thin side. Good drinkability, and certainly good enough for more than one in a sitting."
"This beer presents well, and smells good, but bland comes to mind with everything else. There are better brown ales out there. For the price, maybe a good session beer."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a minimal 1/4"" tan head over the slightly cloudy orangey amber brew. Head is down to swirls and rimmed bubbles in moments, with some small-bubbled lacing. Aroma is hearty grains, with a bit of a fruity tinge. Taste is kind of damp cardboard with some malt notes, and a light fruitiness in the middle and close that try to make me forget the beginning. Mouthfeel is okay, could use a bit more carbonation, and drinkability is not so great for me. Would recommend most of their other brews over this one."
"D - Decent drinkability. The brown ale is average at best."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Overall: Not my favorite St. Arnold. Just a bit too sweet, carbonation level seems too low which gives an odd mouthfeel, and the smell has traces of DMS. IÂ’d recommend the Amber over this."
"One of Saint Arnold's year-round brews, and a very good one at that."
"Coppery/amber in color. Fairly low carbonation. Not a lot of aroma. Fairly subdued actually. Nice mellow malt flavor. Low hop bitterness. Great finish of caramel like sweetness. Good body for style. Overall an enjoyable beer. Might be a tad sweet for a brown ale but I find it quite enjoyable. Thanks mushroomcloud!"
"Drinkability is ok a decent brown ale wouldn't seek it out but worth a try. Thanks go to TxBeer for this one."
"A sweet, malt prescence is key here but the turnoff is the signature Saint Arnold's dirty malt finish. Perhaps a bit of aging will help this along."
"fom the bottle. poured and copper amber with a medium sized off white head. aroma the molasses jumped right out there than came the malts, brown sugar, chocolate. flavor a nice sweetness comes out with the caramel and chocolate, and got hints of malts and hops. not to bad"
"Pours with a frothy tan head that sits atop a brown beer that shows a hazy ruby color when held up to the light. The aroma is a mix of fruity notes of cherry, toasted malt, a light astringent burnt grain note; really the fruity note dominates though. The taste is light and sweet up front with a finish of stale malt. There is quite a bit of fruitiness here, with notes of cherry dominant. The finish is lightly phenolic and astringent with a bit of bitterness as well. For some reason this does not jive with my taste-buds, oh well."
"A mediocre brown ale. The taste was initially on the sweet side but during the glass moved to more of a bland mediocre taste. Color was a good dark brown and very rich, but the lack of head makes the appearance average at best. Like other Saint Arnold's beers it's not bad but not good, as I've said in my other reviews of their beers, it's C+,B- beer. Nothing to write home about."
"Drinkability - good stuff from ST. Arnold's, belongs on the short list of St. A's brews to try if you visit the Houston area."
"Medium brown color and slightly cloudy. Had a thin head with adequate carbonation. Smelled of caramel, spice, and yummy malt. Hints of fruit in the nose. Tasted of smooth malt, caramel, with a touch of chocolate towards the end. Mouthfeel was a bit gummy. (Should have brought some crackers or nuts like most everyone else did.) Finished with good hoppy dryness. Had a good balance of hops and malt. Recommended."
"This ale has a smooth mouthfeel, but is a wee bit undercarbonated for a brown. A very drinkable beer, especially with mexican food."
"Drinking this tonight I'm struck with how similar this tastes to their Christmas Ale. Brown Ale is copper in color with, typical for Saint Arnold, a short head. Aroma is sweet and spiced. Taste is much the same, maybe just a bit too sugary sweet. This is a good enough beer, but I think it could be improved upon."
"Not an exceptional beer, but not unpleasant. One good thing about beeradvocate is it's making me go back and try beers I haven't tasted in years, like this one. Makes a decent food-accompanying beer, I think."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a murky medium brown color with one finger of head that dies off quickly. There is just a little lacing. The smell is rich and nutty, lots of dark roasted malt. A touch of hops in there. The taste has lots of sweet malt. Some toffee in there, with some toasted biscuit malt. A nice flavor. The body is nice and thick, yet smooth. The drinkability is good as well. A nice brown ale."
"Thanks again to HardTarget for the tasty treat!"
"Still, it's light and refreshing - I'd drink this as a summer beer and love it!"
"This is an inoffensive beer that could be a good introduction for the macro brew drinker. It's pretty good but nothing I would actively pursue."
"All in all, I think this is a very good beer. I can imagine it being a nice session choice."
"Thank you Morris729!"
"The nose is nutty, grapesy, sweet. The front is sweet fruit followed by a caramel middle (turning somewhat chocolatey with temperature). The finish is nicely bitter, a little sour (maybe the cloy of the sweet) with loads of roasted, nutty grains. I like this one quite a bit. It could be fuller in the middle, but it's plenty aggressive, I think."
"Clear ruddy bronze in hue, topped by a fluffy, slowly settling off white head. Light caramel and mild chocolate malt upfront in aroma, with hints of earthy hops and pearish esters following. Trace biscuit. Pleasant, but pedestrian aromawise. Bready, grainy malt and biscuit initially in flavor is ceded by medium lovibond caramel malt sweetness and understated hints of semisweet chocolate. Mellow, earthy hop flavor emerges late simultaneously with subtle butterscotch diacetyl. Mild hop bitterness helps lend a persistent sweetness, both caramel malt and residual dextrin derived. Light in bodied, w/ a passable mouthfeel. Finishes clean and a touch watery, with a fading impression of peppered biscuit. Certainly not rich in character, but well balanced overall for good quaffability. A good session beer, but only a couple notches above the norm for the typically insipid brown. Thanks to TXhops for sending this brew."
"12 oz bottle. Bought with the amber ale I reviewed. Medium brown shiny color. Faint white head. Smells are noticable, sweet, and ok with me for the style. Nice full taste of molasses, brown sugar, carmel malt. Not much hops to notice if any. Sweet aftertaste. Still slick like the other one, but not bad at all. Hints of hazelnut and corn syrup. Still light carbonation, slick and watery feel lingers, but better than the amber. I think I'd like to try something else from Texas next, maybe the Broken Spigot Imperial Stout. I give this one another try as well, when I'm sure of it's freshness."
"This is another fine brew from the gang at St. ArnoldÂ’s. If you ever get to visit be sure to look up Jesse Â– That man loves his job."
"Smell is sweet and almost caramel-like. Taste is malty with a hint of maybe coffee or chocolate. Feels very smooth and rich as it goes down. An excellent American Brown Ale IMHO."
"Pours a brownish amber color with a fizzy and bubbly off-white head that quickly dissipated. Nose is dominated by roasted malts with hints of chocolate. The roasted malt and hops clearly come through in the taste along with notes of coffee, caramel, and dark chocolate. An average to nice brown ale."
"Pours a dark amber tea color with a small tan head with staying power and leaves a lace down the glass.  It has a sweet bread smell with a hint of spice.  The taste is burnt malt with a trace of chocolate and finishes thin with a bread after-taste in this light-bodied brew.  One of the better ones from Saint Arnold.  Cheers from Texas!"
"Pours a dark mahogony brown with a full tan head that all too soon vanishes, well carbonated with decent lace.  Strong aroma of roasted malt and hops, hints of bitter chocolate.  The flavor begins with some maltiness, less than I expected, followed by coffee and bitter cocoa flavors and a strong hop finish.  Also a bit watery.  Not as good as some other brown ales that I have had, so I was a bit disappointed.  This is not a bad beer, but there are better examples of the style to be had."
"This was a disapointing beer from the get-go with a thin fizzy head and big-bubble carbonation like a soda. The aroma wasn't too bad with a nice citrusy hop presence. A grapefruit-like hop presence shows up first in the flavor, but then is followed by a watery thinness that leaves you wishing there was more to the beer. Would have been better as a lightly hopped pale ale instead of a brown. Browns need more body than this."
