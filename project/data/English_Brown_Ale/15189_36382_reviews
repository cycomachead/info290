"Pours a deep brown with garnet red accents. 2 fingers of cream colored foam settled with no lacing in to a thin layer and attractive collar. There's a little bit of nutty aroma with some faint smoky accents. Some toasted bread. Not a lot happening in the nose. The taste brings some sweet toffee malts with a little buttery diacetyl. Traces of pecan nuttiness and a little bit of mineral water flourish in the flavor. Scant bitterness with a slightly drying finish and touch of roast. The flavors are all pretty subtle, but artfully constructed. The mouthfeel is medium-full with mild carbonation. This entire beer exhibits great balance. With the moderate ABV and pleasant yet gentle flavors, this would make a spectacular session beer. I am typically not a fan of the brown ales that I've sampled from throughout the United States, but this one got my attention. Simple, tasty and uncontroversial. Many American browns have gone too far with the hops, and in my humble opinion, it takes away from what makes them delicious. It's good to see another East Coast brewery that puts the Carolinas on the map."

"Unsure of age, but know it was bottled this year. Nutty, caramelly, toasted brown malt dominates the aroma. Flavor is fairly sweet and underattenuated, with toasted, nutty malt dominating, finishing sugary sweet, but then countered by hop bitterness, which borders on piney. There are light chocolatey notes that make me think this would go very well with a peanut butter sandwich."

"[Mouthfeel: 3.75] While on the light side of medium, the body shows texture and depth while remaining clean, giving just a bit of dryness to counter the sweet while maintaining a firm crispness and being quite smooth."

"Not a bad brown ale overall. It grew on me a bit as it went down."

"O: Nothing overly spectacular here, but it's definitely drinkable. Worth a look."

"This beer is what turned me over to stouts. While it isn't a stout, it's just dark enough to get you interested in darker beers. At least, that was the case with me. I have found that this is a good middle ground beer for my friends and me. They like light beer, while I drink stouts now. Bad Penny is so yummy, I don't see why anyone wouldn't like it."

"Cheers!"
"Poured out of a bottle into a mason jar. Disappointing brown, tepidly see-through, with some good sticking power of the offwhite head. Smell is not overpowering - don't get much of anything. Taste is mild, malty, very drinkable. A good session brown."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a very dark, ruby-highlighted, hazelnut coloring with a thin, bubbly, light tan head. Aromas of roasted nut sweetness, woody characteristics, and some light, sweet cream highlights. The nose is subtle, and it takes some getting in there deep to pick up characteristics. Flavors are very sweet forward, with an overall roasted character giving way to a blend of nut, chocolate, and subtle toffee notes. Very sweet characteristics, but remains light and drinkable. Roast characteristics build towards the end of the palate into the aftertaste, and are joined by a subtle, mild bitterness. The body is light, and slightly effervesced by the carbonation. The finish has a sweet linger, with a subtle bitterness that provides a clean and dry finale. Very easy to drink."

"Drinkability: It looks awesome, the smell is uninviting, and the flavor eventually becomes offensive. I suspect this bottle is past its prime so I will stay open minded. I think this one deserves an asterisk."
"overall nothing special, but its enjoyable. not bad."
""
""
""
"Anyway, it's worth a visit to check out the brewery if you've never had their beers, but IMHO, there's too many other good breweries in NC that I would try first."

"O: Not a fan of this at all. I think there is a process problem, maybe a very high fermentation temp to get that nose."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Delicious, nothing earth-shattering and not going to win a hype contest, but just a good all around beer to sit down and relax with"
""
""

"O: Pretty easy to drink and enjoyable but not really anything special - I would have appreciated a little more aroma to the beer."

"Another brew found at Margaux's restaurant in raleigh, NC this one shows a dark brown mahogany color, nearly opaque. The head is a modest off-white cover with respectable lacing. The aroma brings pretty standard roasted malt with a touch of burnt wood ash. Mild but pleasant enough. The first mouthful delivers a somewhat diluted brown bread, malt-charcoal medley. Well blended but kind of watery without being unlikeable. There is a bit of tart swampy hop going on here, sort of cider like maybe, but the roasted malt charcoal lead the way on flavor. As I get used to this I pick up some honey sweetness and leafy edges. This brown ale is medium-light bodied with subtle, tingly carbonation and somewhat aqueous feel. Not bad at all, a little weak for my tastes but drinkable and worth a try."

"This poured out as a nice looking deep brown color with a cream colored head on top. The retention and lacing were moderate, but nothing too exciting. The smell of the beer gives of some nice roasted malt aromas with a hint of hops on the nose as well. There is a touch of chocolate and nuts on the nose also. The taste of the beer is toasted, it's got a decent dry bitterness to it in the finish also. There are subtle elements of coffee and chocolate in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer is pretty standard, nothing too crazy going on. Overall it's a good drinkable beer."

"A little more bite than say Newcastle but still a good craft beer."

"O - Bad Penny isn't outstanding by any stretch of the word, but damn if it isn't sessionable and smooth! This beer is, unlike the label, a rather plain Jane which will definitely satisfy in the autumn months."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I like worty, so it's ok by me, but certainly not the classic example of a brown ale. Nice balance. Easy to drink, and savory enough to enjoy one or more."
""
""
""
""
"O - I was surprised at how flavorful this beer was. I came in expecting boring, and I got a pretty good beer."
"Overall a pretty average brown ale."
""
""

""
""
"Pours clear, bold brown-cola color; very thin off-white head. Some cocoa and toffee in the aroma; one-dimensional malts. Medium mouthfeel: slightly watery at the edges; cocoa, caramel, toasted malts; a light, inoffensive brown ale; some roasted character coming through mid-palate. Medium finish showing cocoa and roasted malts and breadiness."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours a dark, semi-transparent chocolaty brown with a fairly thick, if not too persistent, light tan head. Malty aroma has tones of molasses and caramel and a sweet hint plus a touch of hops. Flavor has malty and molasses notes plus hints of caramel, hops and honey. Smooth texture has above-average body and a little fizz. Bad penny? Not too shabby!"
""
""

"Served from tap into a sampler tumbler. Poured a reddish brown with a half finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, nutty, and powdered chocolate. The flavor was of sweet malt, powdered chocolate, dark chocolate, and nutty. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I really liked the chocolate aspect to this one that came across in both the flavor AND aroma. The aroma was quite pleasant on this one, but the flavor just fell a little short. A solid brew that I would drink again and if you haven't I suggest you do."

"Bolder than most other brown ales I've had without taking on the qualities of a porter or stout."

"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass. My last beer of 2011! A little disappointing with the pour- Very small off white/tan head that faded quick and left no traces. Smell was very underwhelming, some nutty malts and a small bit of chocolate. Taste is where this picked up a bit. Something about the coffee/chocolate stout characteristics mixed with the nutty/carmel brown hit the spot on this one. A pretty complex taste which made it hard to sit down. Not too schooled on the EBA's and perhaps that is where the stout qualities come in, but this was very smooth and full flavored. Feel was decent with a good bit of carbonation and stout like silk. Overall- An interesting beer that tastes better than it looks and smells. Complex and rich- I will be hitting another one soon-"
""
""
"There's a solid chocolate undertone to it with a nutty overall taste. Definitely a stout. The taste is mild, but there's something refreshing about it. It has a carbonated, tingly feel. There's a zestyness there that some stouts lack. It's good, if not forgettable."
""
""
""

"The beer is reddish brown with a thin beige cap. The aroma is pretty weak, offering subtle hints of bready malts, biscuits, fruit. Light bodied, with moderately low carbonation. A decent beer, but generally unexciting. Some toffee and caramel notes. Probably won't have this one again."

"Over all this is a great example of a local brewery doing a great job, and it may change until they feel the brew is right. But, right now big boss is doing just fine."
"Drinkability is ok, it's a pretty full flavored brown ale, a bit heavy for my taste in the style, especially when the ABV doesn't really match."
"Bad Penny's one of my go-to favorites. The beer pours dark chocolate brown with very little head, and has a malty aroma that smells like chocolate with a slightly nutty undertone. The taste yields the same, and it proves to be a very malty beer -- which is exactly what I like in my browns. All in all, a great beer to try on tap or from the bottle. It's my favorite of the Big Boss offerings."
"Kudos to Big Boss Brewing for marking the bottled date. A vigorous poor from the bottle straight down the middle of the glass yielded a pitiful half-finger wide head atop a dark brown liquid. The large bubbles that composed the head faded within a minute and left no lacing. Not a very appealing start. The smell was an improvement over the appearance, with a pleasant combination of caramel, nuts, and citrus. The taste is well-balanced between malt and hops - I'm picking up some chocolate, nuts, and some fruity earthiness. Hops are noticeable but not overpowering. A good tasting beer - just close your eyes when drinking."
"Not bad, but could use a little more body in my opinion."
"Overall a drinkable beverage you could do a lot worse. This isn't even a particular favorite style of mine, but I would have many others over this thing ""in this style"" by a country mile."
"Aka. Dookieball"
"O- A good example of the style and one worth seeking out. Easy going down and has all the requirement for a good brown."
"Overall definitely a good tasting brew, easy to drink and had a nice lingering aftertaste. Just right for the Brown Ale category!!"
"Had this at Fuel Pizza in Charlotte. A brown color obviously. Not a great head on the pour. I was actually tilting the bottle straight up in down to try and get one. Not much of a smell. From what I could get out of it carmel-ly. It does have the taste of coffee and chocolate. Probably the combination from a chocolate malt with a bit of nuttiness. The carbonation was fine and so the mouthfeel. Nothing specatular. Nothing bad just average. The best thing was the drinkability. It could have more of these. If I had my choice of brown beers at the store, I would probably choose something else. But, this does well in a pinch when there isn't much of a selection."
"I should note that this bottle was dated July 2010, so I will be interested to try a fresher sample to see if my impression changes at all."
"D: The beer isn't that difficult to drink."
"D-I couldn't finish the bottle because I just didn't like the beer. Its not a bad beer, its just not for me."
"Draught @ Mellow Mushroom in Raleigh: This one poured an opaque brown with a small tan head. It left a little bit of lacing. The aroma is a bit lighter. Some caramel, roastiness and earthiness. The taste is good. Faint caramel malt sweetness in the background. Some roastiness. Hints of chocolate and nuttiness. Not bad."
"I had this beer 1st on draft and then found it in a bottle at HT. I can't understand anyone grading this beer below an A The smell and the taste is just threw the roof. I have already hooked 4 other people on this beer. One of the few beers that I have had on tap and then found in a bottle that was even close to its draft flavor. This has become my new favorite. The only issue so far is I can't drink less than 3 of these in a session AND THIS IS TRULEY A SESSION BEER"
"D - This is one of the better tasting brown ales out there. I'm glad I grabbed it at Bruisin' Ales in Asheville."
"Mouthfeel is good, medium body and light carb give a creamy finish. Drinkability was nice. I would try this again but won't be seeking it out."
"A very drinkable brown, that is an excellent example of the style. This is a beer I would make a regular in my cooler."
"Oooo weee."
"D: While not offensive, this beer doesn't have a lot going for it. Flavors are just to weak. I won't mind finishing the bottle, but I wouldn't track this down."
"Personally, not very drinkable for me. Too many good beers out there to settle for this one."
"Consumed on2/24/2010"
"D: Super easy drinking. Not something I would seek out but a nice session beer. Thanks for the opportunity."
"Overall, we find that this is an average to good beer, reasonably priced, and worth drinking from time to time."
"I really enjoyed this brew and was lucky to have experienced its malty deliciosness on tap. When I ordered, the server asked if I liked Newcastle, which I do, but this beer is much better. The only similarity is their style. She brought out my pint, and I had to first notice the dark color and limited head. The flavor is what blew me away. It is technically an English brown, but it tasted very American. I say that because of the intense roasted malt flavor and hearty feel. This isn't a thick beer, but it was definitely heartier than a typical brown. I loved it!"
"Overall not bad."
"Pours with minimal head, light cream tan color, the foam wasn't there long enough to really be able to leave any lacing behind. Hazy reddish brown, almost mud-like, has a more metallic red hue around the rims, admits a bit of light. The nose is almost completely chocolate, actually smells like a German chocolate cake, caramel pudding, whipped cream, touch of roasted chestnuts, minimal, if any, fruit, citrus scents, any hops-based elements hiding better than Al-Queda. Medium-bodied, the carbonation is semi-sluggish and doesn't add texture as the weight is shed swiftly. More chocolate, caramel, toffee, whipped cream, molasses, manages to come across as sweet but not necessarily sugary. Pinch of apricot and cherry fruit as well as cereals, granola. Overall, it's an innocuous quaff, hits your belly solidly, especially if you like a sweeter beer. I don't know that I'd purchase it again but would easily down it if handed one."
"A dark brown color with mahogany highlighting around the edges. A thin cap of lace and a rim around the top but not much head retention. A pleasantly strong aroma with some roasted grains jumping out first and a hint of chocolate. The taste doesn't really seem to deliver what the aroma promised. Granted the roasted flavors are there and in particular a flavor of bittersweet chocolate but it seems a little one-dimensional. Not a whole lot of complexity. The feel is surprisingly more carbonated than I expected. It had a decent scrubbing bubbles thing going on but I would have liked it to be softer and more coating than cleansing. Perhaps that would have allowed some more flavors to come out. A decent beer that is worth a try if you're in the Raleigh area. It's certainly drinkable and makes a decent session beer but there are certainly nicer brown ales on the market."
"The lighter carbonation on this helps add to an already smooth mouthfeel and aids in making this brew incredibly easy to drink. Very nice and flavorful without going overboard with any of the individual components. Very nice."
"Overall this is one of the more flavorful English browns - or any brown for that matter - I can remember having. Definitely worth a shot."
"medium to light body...enjoyable aftertaste with this brown ale...would prefer over a newcastle (my favorite beer prior to entering the craft beer hobby)...great drink during a cool summer night with friends..."
"Bad Penny (the woman) may have a tarnished reputation, but purchasing Bad Penny (the beer) makes a lot of cents for those who appreciate a finely crafted English brown. For my money, Bad Penny is definitely Good Beer."
"I wasn't sure what to expect out of this brew but I'm happy with what I got. This is my second brew from Big Boss and an enjoyable one at that. Thanks for the bottle Rusty!"
"I will definitely have another go at this one to give it a fair shake--my bottle is less than amonth old but maybe one of us is having an off night."
"I always say I don't like brown ales and then I realize I've had a lot of really good ones...Bad Penny included. Oddly enough, I got this inside a six-pack of Hell's Belle--someone had either mixed it up or done an opposite switcheroo with a 6 of Bad Penny. Turns out I like Bad Penny better than Hell's Belle. A cool surprise. Definitely check it out if your down with the brown."
"The mouthfeel has a drop of metallic coppery taste to it. Smooth and slightly creamy starting off only to dry out in the finish, altogether this brew is sweet and polished. Easy to drink and easy to want another. A damn fine beer."
"D-a nice beer to pound back. A lil overcarbonation to havemore than 3 because they will fill you up. Smooth, crisp and nice to have as a choice on tap."
"12 oz. Real nice dark brown pour, white bubbly head. Aroma is of heavy malt with some yellow raisin. Taste has some malt, brown sugar, raisin, but is then overwhelmed by a cardboard like flavor. Not sure if this is supposed to be some woody characteristic but it is not good. Like if you let your McDonalds soda sit for a day then try and drink it. Mouthfeel is ok with some carbonation. Might be drinkable if not for this large problem also."
"I love this beer from big boss"
"Great beer! A new favorite in dark ales. Easy to drink for anyone who likes a dark ale."
"It tastes like beer that was grown in the woods and later mixed with some dark chocolate in a building made of old bricks. But that's mostly a good thing. Oh, and it looks like a glass of death it's so damn dark. I love that. But, it was not too over-carbonated for me. In fact, I enjoyed it very much, and it slid down my raspy throat surprisingly easy."
"Overall a good beer. I normally don't care for this style, but this was good. I will be buying this one again sometime."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was very dark, nearly black and poured a tan head that was quickly gone. The smell of the beer was burnt caramel and toffee. The lacing was gone or nearly non existant. The taste was pleasant though and I liked it. It was kinda coffeish nuttyish and I will ejoy again."
"Overall: could drink all day"
"Notes from 12/29/06"
"drinkability: very easy and smooth for a brown ale"
"D: I'm glad I grabbed a bottle of this. The ale is a solid brown ale that packs a nice flavor."
"Although it starts creamy, overall the mouthfeel is a bit thin and over carbonated. Not sure I could drink another one of these. Fairly average brown ale -- and I can't quite put a finger on what went wrong."
"Nice drinkable session ale that I'd have again but there are better brown ales available."
"Drinkability is decent but not anything special. I'm glad I have better browns to choose from locally."
"Tastes wet sweet with drying woody and soured caramel tang. Nutty and thin yet bitter coffee flavor. Not good. Astringent dry finish with carbonation acrid chiming in as an unpleasant counterpoint. Light body and strong carbonation. Dumper, life is too short to drink lousy beer."
"The drink is almost cola-like-- thin and crisp with plenty of carbonation-- and is a very easy drinker."
"Not please with this one. Everything was slightly off but not horrible. I cant recommend this in good faith. Decent mouthfeel was and wonderful appearance but those were about the only redeeming qualities in this let-down."
"The body is moderate to light. Carbonation is light but ok. There is a slickness that I usually associate with DMS, but not really perceivable in the taste. Reminds me more of a mild but still pretty good."
"On tap at the restaurant attached to The Souther Season in Chapel Hill.Poured into a standard pint glass a deep mahogany brown with a thin almond colored head atop,muted aromas of dark roast coffee and bitter chocolate mainly.Pretty standard for the style on the palate,somwehat sweet up front with bitter chocolate flavors with pretty hefty roasted coffee-like base underneath thru to the finish.Not bad but like I said pretty basic stuff here."
"Overall: A bit watery on the end (what I call the ""American curse""), much like a cold Irish Coffee -- rather dark for a brown ale, almost a light porter. Nice work, really."
"Brown ales are not usually my cup of tea, but I could session this one all day long, every day. This is a mighty fine brown ale and I cant believe it does not get better scores. If anyone ever wants to send me more of this feel free!"
"Probably not for everyone, it's certainly less practical then say, a Newcastle Brown but fans of the style will enjoy this one."
"Well, pretty much what you would expect from this style. Nothing spectacular, and like last few reviews said no one will probably rate this particularly high, but a very nice session beer."
"I could drink this one all the time.... all night... Excellent little session brew..."
"This is one of the session brews that everyone wants, but then they don't review well. Bull shit - this is a great American brown! I'd take it over the mass produced browns any day."
"It poured a dark brown with a big off-white head. Quickly dissolved to a small ring that stuck around. Smelled of sweet malty goodness with a hint of toasty nuttiness. Tasted like a typical brown ale. Big sweet malty taste with a minimal nutty taste and very small hop presence. The mouthfeel was creamy and silky and added a lot to the overall experience. This was a great example of the style and one of my favorites as a session beer. I could drink these all night long."
"This wasn't a bad Brown Ale form Big Boss but nothing seemed to really jump out at you. It went down easy enough though."
"Pours a nice dark brown. Tan head is medium sized and dissipates quickly leaving some lacing on the surface. Aroma is faint chocolate with some toastiness. Roaste malt dominates. Light coffee notes. Little sweetness. Some light hop bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied. Pretty drinkable. Overall a pretty solid brown ale from this small Carolina brewery."
"single bottle from Whole Foods Raleigh...notched as bottled in December 2007"
"D: This is an easy drinking beer. Not the best brown ale out there, but when in the Triangle, drink local beers! Alcohol is slightly too high (5.5%) to be a session beer, but I could easily have several with a pizza."
"Recommended. A good, pretty interesting brown. Wouldn't mind trying some more from them. Thanks again limesmut!"
"Very dark brown with caramel and crimson highlights. The beige head drops quickly but its got one of those creamy, bubbly caps that I love. Freshly crushed maltiness in the aroma - hints of creamy chocolate and nuts with a certain earthiness all around. The flavor is malty in a creamy sort of way. Nutty, lightly sweet, and chocolaty. Easy going medium body makes it nice and drinkable. This is nothing over-the-top, its a well constructed session beer."
"Overall- A nice session beer that I wouldn't mind drinking again."
"M/D: Pretty high amount of carbonation, kind of throws it off, but I've heard others complain of lack of carbonation, so they may still be working some kinks out of the bottling line. Boby is medium-full and drinkability is fine."
"This beer was formerly known as Uncle Nuts Brown Ale, and it could easily be found in bottles in many groceries and beer bars. I had it on tap this evening at Horniblow's Tavern in Raleigh. It was served in a pint glass, and the color was expected: nut brown. The tan head was short-lived; a thin lacing was left after a few moments. The aroma wasn't very strong, but hints of toasted malts, caramel, and a bit of hops can be detected. The flavor is on the mild side, but it certainly comes across as a decentif not specialEnglish Brown Ale. It is a little heavily carbonated for my taste, and it is medium-bodied. I suppose I prefer brown ales with a heavier mouthfeel. I would have it again, but I may choose something else if other brown ales are available."
"The taste is a bit bland, with some toffee-caramel malts, a bit of nuttiness, and really not much else. Even once my food arrived, the flavor just didn't do anything for me. As for mouthfeel, it's a bit thin and watery, with a low carbonation level and an okay finish. It is refreshing, however, and quite easy to drink. I'll probably try this again sometime, and hopefully it'll impress me more than it did today. The first ""miss"" of the normally delicious Big Boss beers I've tried."
"Flavor was quite good. this would be a good beer o cook with. Not over-the-top malty but with a slight hop presenc balancing the sweetness of the malts. Within the malts there was a strong presence of candied hazelnuts and chestnuts. Even some slight hints of spices. This would make a nice winter/Christmas beer. Medium mouth body which was nice because it was not particularly filling. Woul definitely order again."
"Formerly known as Edenton's Uncle Nut, this will be one of four beers to be bottled year round by Big Boss. The beer was served a decent crisp brown with a thin head that diminished to a ring. The aroma was of dark malts with some undertoned pine hops. The taste was well balanced with a slight nut texture. The beer was light and crisp, an enjoyable brown ale."
