Amberish dark brown in appearance with a big fluffy head that retains excellent lacing as you sip on the brew. Smells like toffee, caramel, pretty swet scent on the nose. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky the nose is deceptive, was expecting a sweeter taste, but this is very balanced, earthy and malty in taste.

Poured a two finger light tan head with considerable lacing clinging to the side of the pint glass. Hidden inside the amber notes float a moderate amount of bubbles. Aroma screams of nutty goodness. Hints of chocolate and raisins are also present. No hops make an appearance. Flavor is malt dominated with a complexity of bitter chocolate, toffee, dark fruits and toasted nuts. A sweet caramel tone lingers along with a very slight butterscotch flavor. There is also a slight roasted bitterness and just a touch of herbal hops. Carbonation leans toward the low side. Combine this with the residual sweetness and it makes for a medium mouthfeel. Overall a very good beer. I really enjoyed the combination of flavors","MonkeymooTJ","Feb 21, 2013"

In the mouth it's pretty thin and doesn't have a very large body. It just doesn't stick around much.

The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a very nice bit o' brew, though the taste lacks full character, as though it were too light for its own good.

The lower abv allows for this beer to be drank all night, and the flavor allows you to actually want to. There is nothing that boldly stands out in the flavor, but instead it is very well balanced. This great balance of suttle flavors of nut, coffee, chocholate perhaps leads to a very drinkable beer. Being $5.99 a six pack from trader joes makes this beer all the better.","Eisen","Jan 07, 2010"

The first sip is smooth, with some light roasted malt flavors balanced by a bit of chocolate and lightly bitter hops. The bottle may say dark ale, but this beer has me thinking black lager instead of porter, as it is very clean tasting. The finish is nicely balanced with a pleasant roasted character.

Were this available at bars priced like its grocery store counterparts it would be excellent for putting a few back while focusing on conversation and not paying attention to beer. As is, it's pretty lackluster for a porter. Maybe should be reviewed as an English Brown Ale, ala Abita Turbo Dog, especially since it claims to be a "dark ale"? Might fare better in that company, I give it a 3 in that company I think.","semihobo","Jun 02, 2006"

Nice dark cola-with-coffee color, enjoyed the smell of it at first, or more to the point, enjoyed the anticipation of drinking it. Overall not displeasing to the nose or eye. Now for the mouth's opinion: one good sip, swirl around the tongue, ...ehh! Is this a carbonated batch of coffee water run through a dirty filter a second time, with beer flavoring added, plus some alcohol? Thin and metallic like the saliva drained out from the bottom of a trumpet, chilled, and artificially colored. The taste of this beer is not improved by observing the noxious black amphibian illustrated on the label.

Great drinkability. this is a session beer if i've ever had one. not sure if i would call this a porter though. that's not the exact style i would select, although im not sure exactly what i would call it. if i was reviewing it as a porter it would get lower marks, i think. definitely worth a try.","aforbes10","Jan 27, 2006"

Not much of a smell, but notes of roasted malts and herbs were noted. Taste was pretty good; flavors of malts, light coffee, and some nuts seemed to go together quite well. Mouthfeel was good, as the carbonation seemed to really keep the palate occupied. Decent drinkability. This is a deal at 4.99 a sixer at Trader Joe's.

Smells of roasted malt, caramel and nut. Pretty full and pretty well balanced. Tastes rather bland for a porter. Roasted malt is notable, but not terribly strong. Hops are also part of the flavor, but there is nothing special at all here. Mouthfeel is not great. There is plenty of carbonation but no real substance on the tongue. A bit fizzy and watery, very surprising for the style. Overall, this beer isn't great and it isn't too bad either. Weak for my tastes. Average is probably a good way to describe it.","macpapi","Oct 18, 2005"

Taste begins with smooth chocolate with a touch of sweetness and ice coffee; burnt toast rounds out the finish with a surprising but not wholly unpleasant aftertaste of cigarettes in the mouth (not ashtray-ey, but approaching that). No bitterness at all, which I believe might strengthen this beer's profile. An easy drink, it's got a lighter body (cf. Guiness stouts) than most porters. Certainly a good beer, but there's too many porters in the English or American style that surpass Black Toad's modest presence.","marcellaproust","Apr 25, 2004"
