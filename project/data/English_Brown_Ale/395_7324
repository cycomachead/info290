3.79,5.6,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"Enjoyed from the 12 oz bottle in a snifter, this excellent example of a brown ale pours a clear perfect reddish brown with a thick creamy off white head and moderate lacing.  Nose o roasted malts and a dash of herbal hops.  Flavors are nutty malt goodness, sweet caramel malts, light toffee, and a dash of light herbal hops on the back that makes this a rather easily quaffable brew.  Moderate carbonation, and a solid improvement with warmth.  Not overly sweet, this is a solid example and an excellent brew to pair with a spicy meal.  Very nice.","Brutaltruth","Jan 09, 2015"

It was difficult to detect nuttiness apart from slightly resembling a marzen's character; and although carbonation held, I couldn't keep from wondering what it would be like to find sweetness in the aftertaste, not at the front.  Like the M&M standby "melt in your mouth -- not in your hand!" I wanted the sweetness to find me not smack me at the onset practically before I'd raised my hand-held beverage to sip!","A_Frayed_Knot","Dec 05, 2014"

3.75,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"The taste is light and simple but very pleasant, with chocolate, nuts, leaves, plus a hint of cola. The flavours are simple and light but good and persistent. The feel is a little flat from low carbonation, but still has some zestiness to it and a hint of oiliness. It has light sweetness and practically no bitterness, but has a finish that is nicely somewhat dry, leafy and nutty. It has enough character and complexity, and these hold up enough, to keep it tasty and interesting as well as very drinkable. It does a good job of having a nutty-chocolate character that is not burnt tasting or totally one-dimensional or bitter. That said, it's still not very unusual, rich,complex, or interesting.","Offa","Oct 24, 2008"

Aftertaste lingers on the palate, I really don't see anything wrong with this brew at all, everything seems to be a positive if you ask me. This is one I'd definitely pick up again, great deal for the price and great beer overall. As I mentioned above, this is one of the best local brews I've had in a while.

This beer is very sweet for the style, with a bit of bitterness at the end and some nice toasty breadiness showing up a bit after the swallow.

3.98,10.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"A perrinial favorite in my region on tap, therefore this is my first bottle review. Certainly as high quality as expected, but lacks the nuances that I find on tap or cask that make it one of my favorite Brown Ales. Still looks a solid brown color with ruby light transmittance. Impressive creamy head retention and lacing. Aromas, even warm, didn't give me the malt / chocolate character that I usually find on tap. Lightly woodsy, nutty, and pungent (peat-ey), but without the firm body to support the flavors as well as I expect. Flavors follow suit with quality malts, chocolates, walnuts, just not as intense as I like. The mouthfeel is a little sticky sweet and less thirst quenching that at the pub. Even with the criticism, it's still a great Brown Ale; but given a preference, I'll try it on cask any day.","BEERchitect","Dec 15, 2006"

It smells like nuts, caramel, a bit of chocolate and malt. Taste is the same as it smells, it starts off a bit sweet and finishes a little on the bitter side. Mouthfeel is on the light side, I was hoping there would be some more substance to it. Drinkability is pretty good though, as it's very smooth and goes down pretty easy. It's not the best brown ale I've had, but with that being said I could still drink quite a few of these at a time. It's a decent sessionable beer, and I'd buy it again.","bluejacket74","Nov 26, 2006"

Taste has a touch of smooth chocolate, toasted malt, a hint of ripe pears, and a vague nutty character that seems hazelnut. Hops are restrained, but add a delicate bitterness that provides a nice balance. Light bodied and tasty enough to be very sessionable, but lacks the depth and complexity of the tap version I sampled a few months ago at the brewpub.
