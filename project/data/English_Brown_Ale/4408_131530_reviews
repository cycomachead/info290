"A pretty good brown ale and it's pretty salty"
"Bottle. Pours brown! Thin, tan head. Smell is mild. Some sweetness and bread. Brown malt. Smells like a Brown Ale smells. No frills, nothing new. Flavor is also particularly restrained. It lacks richness and the flavors seem thin. Bread, meager chocolate, caramel, toast and the like. Body is rather light and also thin. Medium carbonation. Wasn't good, wasn't horrible."
"Enjoyed a 4 oz pour at Homegrown Brewhouse in Summerville, SC. Even in the sample glass it pours with a nice frothy 2 finger head. The transparent, light brown brew demonstrates a nice degree of clarity. The cream colored head has just a hint of brown color, and it lingers throughout. Great head retention. After every sip, residual soapy lacing also clings to the little glass. The smell of pecan nuttiness & toasted grain greets the nose. A hint of malt sweetness and a biscuit like backdrop round out the aroma. The flavor is mildly sweet and nutty, with an earthy toasted character. It finishes pretty clean. Perhaps the best element of this beer is the texture. It's incredibly smooth, creamy and easy on the palate. The understated carbonation enhances the mouthfeel. While there's nothing exceptionally remarkable about this one, it's a great example of the style. Very sessionable. Very accessible. Experienced or intermediate drinkers can enjoy this with equal measure. Years ago, prior to reviewing beers, I'd tried another brown ale offering from RJ Rockers. Bald Eagle Brown. Not sure if this is the same stuff, re-branded with a more clever name, but I seem to enjoy this iteration more than the other."
"A short head forms on the pour, and even that drops to a thin lacing on top. Below is a beer that is darker than mahogany. The aroma captures my attention with a sweet nuttiness, toffee, dates, and overall joy. It's a malty beer, no question about that, with a maltiness which doesn't tip the balance. For this afternoon, Brown Eyed Squirrel hits the mark."

"This brew is best of the variety pack that I picked up, better flavors and presence, but poor presentation."

"O - Not a bad brown by any means, just missing the mark. To me brown ales are best in fall, and it kinda makes you feel the season if you get me. But this one has off center traits that pull it away from being great."
"MF - Medium light bodied. Thin with a bit of creaminess (seems contradictory, I know)."
"O - the foam is a deal breaker for me. Everything else is fine but I don't like having to wait ten minutes to finish filling a glasss."
"O- This style is known for being uninteresting when it comes to flavor, but this one is quite complex; bready, malty, fruity and nutty. This is a solid session beer and a good change of pace from the typical bland brown ale"
""
"Not trying to pile-on this brew, its my first RjR review. I like the initial flavor, but the aftertaste is a bit too reddish metal bitter for my liking. A lack of ""earthiness""."
""
""
"smell was average; taste was very decent. I would very much drink this one again...."
""
""
""

"Overall - I like R.J. Rocker other beers but this one I will not be looking to get again."

"I'm not sure what to think of this brew. It has an interesting smell and taste. However, it's quite light in both regards, and perhaps too blandly balanced. There is a slight hollowness or watery taste that makes this appear rather weak. It's a decent drink, however, I wouldn't get it again."

"Pours a murky super dark brown with a 2 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, cocoa, and some nutty aromas. Taste is of toasted malt, burnt cocoa, and slight nutty flavors. There is a mild medicinal-like bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer with a good smell but a somewhat disappointing flavor."
""
""
""
"Overall, it does some things very well but drops the ball in other areas. There are better browns regardless of whether you prefer sweet or dry browns. And yet they got the taste mostly right."

"The mouthfeel is rich and full and combined with the flavor results in an extremely satisfying beer."

"O: Drinkability is high."
"Pours a dark mahogany brown color, with a thick, creamy off-white head, but the presence of a lot of chunky floaters detracts from the appearance. The aroma is light and nutty, with a little bit of caramel sweetness and some chocolate. The flavor likewise has a little bit of chocolate and some dark caramel sweetness, but there is also a substantial astringency that distracts and detracts from the dryly sweet flavor profile. The thin-medium body and fine, prickly carbonation do little to mask these problems. Overall, although aspects of this beer's character are fine, the totality of the drinking experience is not something to back for."
"Super toasted malt mixes with a walnutty yeast and malt flavor mix. Palate is a little thin. But this beer is a great session brew that I wish I could get in IL."

"Overall a pretty average brown ale. I would get again."
"Overall, not a bad beer. I feel it has a weird cinnamon presence that dominates. It looks good, feels good, and tastes good, but maybe not a six pack. i bought a single bottle. Worth a try."

"O: The beer is very flavorful and easy to drink and pairs particularly well with burgers."
""
"This is a nice beer, overall. I would prefer the flavor to be sweeter on the back end. It has a pretty dry finish for my taste. But, it's really good anyway."
""
""
""
"O - This si a nice beer, but not nearly as good as the other RJ Rockers brews."
"D: Glad its made in my home state so I can just go down the road for a six pack"
"Stable, solid brew here, pick one up - a go-to brown ale.."
"O- Solid session beer here, nothing crazy just simple and good."
"D: It's not one of RJ Rocker's best, in my opinion, but it's fairly easy drinking. There's a bit missing that is typically characteristic of the style, and it's not overly balanced, but it's still pretty enjoyable. I visit SC several times a year, and this is one that I drink frequently while I'm there. Not bad at all, but not great."
"Look I am a local, and I love local beers. I buy them and want them to do well. If I were honest, however, I can say avoid this one. It's average at best. The appearance has all the hallmarks of a brown ale. The smells okay.. what I would expect from a brown ale. Taste-wise uninspired. Okay, yes. It tastes like a brown ale, but nothing really interesting. Nothing different from anything else. Mouthfeel is fine with okay carbonation. Overall, I just have yet to be WOWed by an RJ Rockers brew. They don't blow my socks off."
"This beer pours a hazy, dark rust color with orange in the light, half-inch head and lasting lace. It's aroma is fruity, nutty, and a bit of vanilla. The flavor is begins with caramel and a fruity malt sweetness quickly taken over by a hop bitterness that lasts through the finish. The mouthfeel is thin. R J Rockers Bald Eagle Brown is an ok beer, Not recommended."
"O- Not a bad beer and a pretty good Brown Ale. I preferred this beer to their Patriot Pale."
"It's a good brown ale. Very easy to drink and would make a fantastic pitcher to order amongst friends."
"Bald Eagle Brown is pretty much par for the course when it comes to RJ Rockers beer. In other words, it's slightly better than average, but does nothing that would elevate it into the realm of even remotely special. Sparrow Brown, the more appropriate name, would be unlikely to sell as well."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is easy drinking and a decent representation for the style. It comes together with the favorable aspects slightly edging out but overall trying it once was enough for me. I probably wouldn't return to this brew again."
"Pretty good example of an English Brown here... Very strong nutty quality to the aroma and taste... Dark maltiness with hints of cocoa aspects and the merest hint of hops... Easy drinking brew.. Not mind blowing by any means but a good go to beer for pizza or pasta..."
"M/D - Medium bodied, maybe a touch on the thin side of medium. Creamy feel and very easy drinking. All in all, a nice example of a brown ale."
"Bald Eagle has ""session ale"" written all of over it, with its down-to-earth style. Hard to tell if it was brewed in the US or not, which shows that this is a damn good Brown Ale."
"Served from bottle into a shaker. Pours a dark brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained good lacing thoughout. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt and nutty notes. The flavor followed the nose with light roasted malt and nutty characters. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was not a bad brew. However, the flavors of this one were quite muted for some odd reason, as it warmed up they came out a little more but were still not pronounced. Still a nice brown ale that is worth trying."
"This is definitely one of the best brown ales I have had and better fresh on tap. I could actually drink a few of these."
"Pours a nice dark slightly hazy mahogany with a VERY thick tan head - my sample fizzed like crazy. Decent aroma is malty, fruity and a little yeasty. Malty flavor has a faint caramel undertone as well as cloves and cinnamon hints. Texture is smooth and somewhat fizzy, leaving a tingly and malty finish."
"Bald Eagle Brown fits nicely with the style, and is unassuming. I wish it were more memorable, but still, it is very easy going down, and one could make a long afternoon with this and friends, perhaps while playing pick-up football."
"Fairly aggressive pour only gets you half a finger of off-white foam, gone in a flash with zero lacing left behind. Filminess deepens the mahogany brown color, stronger orange tones come out around the edges along with more clarity. The nose has a light touch, caramel, maple evidence of the malts yet there's also a somewhat bitter grassiness to it, almost a saline quality too, blanched almonds, whiff of mixed white citrus, that's about it. Light-bodied, the light carbonation not doing much to activate what's there. Again, starts off with caramel, toffee, chocolate powder and maple syrup, here the grapefruit, lemon citrus component more pronounced. The roastiness is generalized, more feel than flavor. The leafy hops keep it clearly on the dry side of things. A few notes of cherry or blackberry fruit. Mild clenching through the finish. Not horrible by any means, just not something I'd be interested in tasting again."
"Overall a very, very good offering from them. This could be a regualr session beer for sure."
"Aromas of nutty, toasty malt, brown sugar, and a touch of earthy, leafy hops. Toasty and smooth on the palate, showing very light hop bitterness, with light notes of molasses. Finishes dry-ish and earthy, with a hint of fruitiness. Medium bodied and somewhat soft."
"Overall, not bad but could use a bump in depth and body. It's better than some of their other beers."
"I'd never heard of this beer or brewery but heard a complete stranger recommend it as ""one of the best browns out there."" Took a chance and tried it. So glad I did. I've not found a brown ale that I like as much as this one. Smooth, low carbonation and nice coffee/caramel richness."
"D - not bad, but not as smooth and drinkable as others"
"Great Job Rockers! keep doing what you are doing"
"I poured this beer ito my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was a nice brown color with with a tan head. The beer looked good at first but then the head really went away fast. The beer did have good lacing though which was odd since the head wet away fast. The taste was too hoppy for me to be a brown ale. Thats just my opinion so my opinion is that I will not buy this again."
"D= fine for a few or a session."
"Drinkability: Again, this is a middle-of-the-road beer that doesn't pull any surprises. It is solid, but not spectacular. A worthwhile session brew."
"I guess I made this beer seem awful, and it isn't, actually. Not outstanding, but not terrible. So while I would rate it fairly low on any particular category, I find the sum is better than the parts and the drinkability is fairly high."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, slightly filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, it's not a bad beer but there are better brown ales that I would choose first."
"It's drinkable, yet forgettable. Not much in the way of depth here."
"Medium-bodied with a thicker mouthfeel. The roasted, bitter taste lingers on your tongue and makes you want to drink more, which I would gladly do. It's still a little heavy and awkward, though. I would drink many of these."
"A very solid rendition of an English style brown ale with a bit of an American twist: a little more malt, and a little more hops to balance it. Nicely done!"
"D - A good looking and good smelling brown ale that falls a little short in the taste and mouthfeel departments... Drinkable, but not memorable... Not bad, but there are many a better brown ale out there..."
"D: Nothing wrong with this offering from RJR although I like their 1.5 APA a bit better. This one could benefit from some more dedicated malting to produce even a finer brew."
"Well carbonated and finishes easy, but not great. A bit of residue on the back end and a bit too watery of a finish."
"Pulled from a variety 12-pack I picked up at State Line in Maryland. Appears a clear red-brown in glass with a tall head that quickly disappears. While I thought the Patriot Pale was a good simple beer, I think this is a bad simple beer. The flavor is a little watery, which is a kiss of death when you're looking for a great session beer. Instead of being full-flavored yet drinkable, it's a little thick and not very tasty. The aroma has a pleasant dry cocoa note, but the flavor is just simple dark bread crust with a touch of juicy caramel, not much else. I'd pass."
"Nothing spectacular here, but a crisp, easy-drinking brown ale."
"This beer has some body, smooth and creamy feel, and all around tasty. An easy session beer choice any time of year. I'd go back to it for sure."
"Drinkability: I love brown ales and I highly recommend this as a shining example of the style. If you can get this beer - try it!"
"This is a very plain brown ale. It fits the profile very well, but nothing exceptional. Nice malty body, with a cleaner hops finish. Grades as average in aroma and appearance with a nice medium brown color with cream head, and predominately malt scent with some caramel. A decent beer, good for non ""micro"" folks being introduced to new beers."
"I've had a few different RJ Rockers beers recently and I think they are much improved overall. This brown is solid for the style. Relatively understated but balanced and tasty. Pours a coppery brown with a moderate head that fades to a ring. Nice color, but the head could be a bit thicker. Nice dry toasty aroma with some nuttiness. Quite dry. Similar in taste, with a nice nutty dryness, some nice moderate toastiness and a touch of coppey metal in the finish. Quite nice. Smooth, medium bodied and drying on the finish in the mouth. Quite respectable. I enjoyed this."
"Poured to a light brown with thin off-white head that lingered awhile and left little lacing. Nose was a combination of malty nuts and chocolate and the taste represented the same. Motuhfeel was flat and somewhat watery, ut the finish was smooth. I'm going against the grain some on this one, in that I thought it was a decent beer, especially for a beer I had never heard of."
"-Oelergud"
"A: Medium layer of cottony head, acorn brown, quite clear - 4.25, S: Very quintessentially a brown ale, touch of nuts, brown sugar, slightest hint of coffee grounds and cocoa powder - 3.50, T: Some bitter hops on the tongue, orange rind, some dark chocolate - 3.00, M: Mildly gritty, medium to thin bodied - 3.00, D: A solid beer, nothing that will not your socks off but nicely crafted - 3.00"
"Overall, this is a moderately drinkable beer, but there are a lot of other browns out there with fuller tastes & better feel."
"Very rich caramel malty flavor. Little chocolate flavor, especially at the end. Tart finish with very faint hop hints. Very smooth mouthfeel and good drinkability. Really enjoyed this as a session beer, good character and good flavors on every level."
"Blah."
"D This is nice English brown that pushes the style envolope just enough to give it some character yet still remains true. Goes down a little too easy. Enough to be dissappointed when it's finished. I've been exploring English brown's and this is my personal favorite so far."
"Not the best Brown Ale but it's certainly decent, and one of the better offerings I have had from R.J. Rocker's."
"Drinkability: Sure, it's very drinkable, but I certainly would appreciate a heft to both its body and overall malt character."
"D = This is a very approachable beer and I could definitely see drinking it again. Its faults are really just that it doesn't quite bring enough flavor to the table. Otherwise, it is a fair enough little beer."
"Drinkability: i had more than one!"
"cheers!"
"Clear brown-amber color. Distinct nutty flavor. Went down very easy. No off-tastes like I have experienced with Newcastle, for instance. I would choose the Patriot or the Bell Ringer from R J Rockers before the Bald Eagle, but never-the-less an enjoyable beer."
"The beer pours a clear brown with an off white head that dissipates to whisps of foam leaving some lace. Sweetness dominates the aroma with smells of caramel and chocolate. The taste is also full of caramel with some bitter roasty characteristics. The body is just under medium, slightly thin, but the carbonation is nice. It is a easy drinking sessionable brown, but nothing overly complex."
"Not a terrible beer by any means, but it misses the mark stylistically. The yeast needs more time to clean up it's byproducts and a little more specialty malt needs to be in there."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, nutty, caramel, smooth...perhaps a bit under-attenuated, as residual sweetness seems to be bordering on cloyingly sweet."
"D: Not bad at all - good balance, nice robust toastiness, modest ABV (guessing here that it's around 5%). I'd have this one again. Thanks for sending, Jeff, and for helping me check another state off the list...36 down..."
"Good dark brown color. The fun ends there. Decent chocolate caramel smell. Weak thin watery malt flavor. This beer is unimpressive. I could knock them back all night because of the lack of mouthfeel and the all around wateriness but I could do the same with Bud Light."
"Poured a nice crisp semi-dark brown with a thin head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma is dark malts and burnt caramel. The taste is burnt caramel, mild chocolate, and a hint of dried fruits and coffee. The beer is light and crisp with low carbonation. While I could see this making for a decent session, it's just not anything I'd usually seek out that often. I am glad to taste some good stuff out of SC, however."
"Overall, pretty good with great balance."
"Average mouthfeel. I dont think I could have more than one of these. A little bit of hop bitterness but little too sweet for my tastes. Not balanced enough. May be fine for others, but I will pass."
"This is a great beer that is easy to session and just may be my favorite RJ Rockers beer."
"This beer poured a nice deep brown with a slight head. The smell was caramel like. The taste was somewhat like brown sugar. This beer was very smooth in the mouthfeel. I could drink this beer again. Hopefully, R.J. will start distributing in NC soon."
"Not crazy about this one. It's too close to soda. Could be a fine brown ale, the recipe just needs some tweaking. It's as if the brewery is holding back. It needs more personality, or character, or something. I'm looking forward to trying the R.J. Rockers Patriot Pale Ale that I received in the same trade."
"D  A good thirst quencher due to its light wateriness, but still a great flavor. This is a good summer beer and maybe a good beer for starters in hops. And a good representation of a english brown ale."
"Pours a clear medium shade of brown with a thinner white head that s gone pretty quickly no lace behind as it settles,earthy unsweetened chocolate dominate the aromas with a touch of brown suger.Very basic brown ale flavors bitter chocolate and a little nutty with a dryer abrupt finish.A basic straight to the point brown alenothing out of the ordinary flavor wise not bad for the style but wouldnt seek out again."
"Quaffed a few at Abby's Restaurant in Spartanburg, SC. Poured a clear dark brown with a thin, tan head. No lacing. Sweet, malty aroma with a hint of chocolate. Rich chocolate malt flavor with just enough hop bitterness to balance the sweetness of the malt. A very drinkable brew and a good representation of the style. Tastes like a Bass used to taste, only better."
"Drinkability: A very nice brown ale with a surprising degree of chocolate flavor"
"I just feel sorry for the poor souls in the restaurant who I saw ordering bottles of the macros... they had no idea was was so close, and how much better it was."
"Modeled after a traditional deep brown English Brown ale. Pours a deep brown. Couldn't judge the head because I was tasting in a 2.5 oz shot glass. Has a nose of chocolate and malt. Has a taste of malt, chocolate, and a slight hops for balance. Great beer."
