"Like the original Maduro, I'm still not giving this offering high ""true to style"" grades.  However, it does get a high grade in ""tasty."""

"the vanilla adds a real nice touch to this already exceptional brown ale, and to have it from the nitro tap was awesome. cool little taphouse in stuart, florida called the crafted keg. its so creamy looking, darker than i remember it from the can, and holding its luxurious milky head leaving rings at every sip in the pint glass. it smells vanilla heavy, but not artificial at all, but some of the roast seems tamed by the sweetness it brings. the flavor holds true to that, and while the vanilla brings an awesome new flavor wrinkle, some of what made the original base beer special is lost to it just a bit. still, its a great base beer for vanilla, and i think the dosage is appropriate, except the sweetness that it brings lingers on the palate, maybe aided by the nitro feel less aggressive bubbles to wash the mouth clean. fuller bodied like a porter more than a brown ale as we know them. its not a negative, it just limits how much of this is desirable to drink, couple of pints tops for me, where regular maduro i was good for a sixer no problem. cool tweak, less nutty, more sweet, equally delicious."

"O â€“ Easy drinker and I mean easy. This goes down smoothly and tastes wonderful. I had three of these down in a blink of the eye."
"Never would have thought a vanilla beer would be good, but this beer proved me wrong. It had a perfect balance of vanilla that was not overpowering. I would drink this again If I had the chance."
""
"This is a surprising ale.  Coming from Florida, I would have never expected this craft beer to come out the way it has.  It is smooth tasting and you can even get the vanilla taste without it being overwhelming. Goes down nice and no weird after taste."

"I had it on Nitro at Nona Tap Room in Orlando and I felt that on Nitro it had a much better feel and finish, but it is certainly a good beer either way."

"o - Overall a really good beer; I like the base beer but this is much better. Well worth trying if you see it on tap."
""
""
""
""
""

"Also tried the nitro version. Way better. Smoother and creamy. And hints of vanilla on this one."

"Overall: An interesting twist but the base beer seems to have much more complexity; the nut flavors in the base beer are replaced here by fruit and vanilla"

"Overall: This was a pleasant deviation from the Maduro. Worth trying at least once. Would recommend over Abita's Vanilla Double Dog brown ale."
""
""

"Single finger head with some retention and excellent lacing on a murky deep amber brown body. Aroma is a bit mild with toffee, caramel malts, nuts and a nice vanilla presence. Flavor follows well with nuts, chocolate malts and burnt toast initially then moving to brown sugar and vanilla. Not too sweet and well balanced. This one gets better as it is enjoyed too. Medium body and moderate carbonation."

"O: I like the base beer and I thought this vanilla varient was really nice. Don't have much to complain about here really, it's a solid session beer with some complex flavor. Try some if you get a chance."

"O: Good. Not great. Maduro has never been my favorite (personal preference here; as an example of style, or for someone that is seeking out an Oatmeal Brown I would highly recommend one). But, I thought I'd give the vanilla variant a shot. I probably prefer it slightly to the base beer."
"Light body, light effervescence, watery. Great taste but WTF with the body? I thought my first cask would be a no brainer given the quality of brew in the past."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Liked it a lot, didn't quite love it though like I did the Cubano espresso style Maduro. I would absolutely get this again, and would've taken a growler if it was allowed. Sweet vanilla finish really broke everything up making this complex and balanced."

"O - Disappointing: I prefer the regular Madura."
"O-Its a nice twist on what is an excellent brown ale, but I think I prefer the base beer. Still, its definitely worth a try; especially if you like dessert type beers."
"On cask at the tap room. In the pint glass, a cloudy dark brown, reddish tinted, with one finger of khaki colored head, spotty lace left behind. Smell: a lot of vanilla overwhelms chocolate and a slight nuttiness. Taste: vanilla ice cream in caramel syrup, lightly roasted backdrop. Silky feel. Drying finish where some earthiness emerges. This does a great job of featuring vanilla - it's loaded with vanilla - but it's one note compared to the awesomeness that is regular Maduro."
"But the vanilla does add to the body, and it's still drinkable as anything. So so tasty. Just probably not worth the extra cost of production to put on vanilla. I'll take original. Cheers!!"
"(91st)"
"The beer pours a murky brown colour with bubbly white head. Head dissipates without any lacing. Smells of very strong vanilla with a hint of oak. Chocolately and some roasted malt in the smell too. Quite a sweet beer. I found I enjoyed the first half of the pint more than the 2nd half as it was a lot of vanilla. Still tasted nice though."
"I appreciate how the vanilla aging is subtle and not overpowering/overdone, but I would have liked this beer to be a bit more tweaked and interesting. Also, the oatmeal and brown aspects of it were lost on me."
"Growler. Courtesy of McDiddyPop on BA. Pours a nice brown color with the slightest tinge of red to it. Great foamy tan head. The aroma is very similar to the regular version but with a strong vanilla smell that takes center stage, other notes of dark malt, subtle sweetness, cocoa take a back seat. The taste is all vanilla for the first second then slowly transitions to the roasted malt and cocoa flavors. Lingering taste of vanilla. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium. An interesting addition in flavor to the regular version."
"Very good beer."
"I could waste time and space expounding on this brew but why bother? Its world class and makes me wish I lived in Tampa..."
"Very good beer overall. I'm impressed with the use of vanilla bean in that it adds another dimension to a great base beer without totally overwhelming it."
"Expert handling of the vanilla aging. It really takes this beer from pretty damn good to outstanding. I might have to drive down every weekend now..."
"Poured from growler into a pint glass, pours an impressive brown with ruby color hue and nice thick fat lace. Smell is of dark chocolate, roasted caramel and sweet cocoa slight hint of vanilla. Taste is spot on big and roasty with chocolate, tobacco, a hint of spice from the hop and just a slight faint taste of vanilla. Overall another impressive offering from Cigar City."
"It's almost unfair to classify this as a brown ale, but if you do, it's great for the style. Drinkable and really enjoyable overall."
"Not my favorite treatment of the Maduro Brown."
"D- delicious stuff that I would jump at the chance to try again. my pint was gone way too quick. I could see the vanilla being a little much after a couple pints, though. its quite strong."
"D- Almost Perfect....I can't wait to have this one again, again and again!!!"
"Overall it is a pretty tasty beer, I will be getting this again some time if it is available."
"Low ABV, thinnish texture enhance the chug factor. Still, not my favorite treatment."
"Overall I'm not so sure I don't like this better without the addition of vanilla beans, however that's not to say the addition isn't interesting. Worth a shot."
"On tap at Cigar City takes NYC event at Rattle 'N' Hum. Raters at my table were not so oy-yoy-yoy about the vanilla, but I appreciated the vanill's edge and smoothness,a rising above the chocolate and making it a decent drinker, owing to it being more on the sweeter side.Very dark with a whisp of a head, suitably carbonated."
"D: As previously mentioned, I was expecting just a hint of vanilla, but was actually quite surprised by the amount of vanilla. My only complaint was the level of sweetness that it provided, but otherwise I found it to be quite nice."
"Haha!! Crazy 32oz growler!! Thanks, Grant. It pours a barely translucent dark mahogany brown color with a deep foamy tan head that fades slowly leaving sheets of Belgian lacing behind. Smells like rich malty Hershey's syrup with a vanilla chaser. It carries over to the taste nicely. Lightly carbonated, the mouth feel is creamy smooth yet singular. The semi-sweet creamy chocolate lingers appropriately too. At 5.5% ABV this one is really easy drinker. Two pints are a tease!!."
"Draft sample at Cigar City. Poured a clear brown color with an average frothy brown head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt and dark vanilla aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy cocoa and vanilla sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate duration. Solid complex brew."
"This is a great beer, but I would have preferred a more vanilla forward beer."
"Drinkability: Low abv + medium body + delicious flavor = really drinkable brew!"
"D and overall impression: Drinkability, although high, will be limited by the sweetness from the vanilla. Overall, yet another good treatment of an already great beer. Can't wait to see what Joey and Wayne can come up with next. Skal."
"drinkability is great. excellent balance. nice depth. even better than the regular maduro with the extra added character and complexity from the vanilla. i'll admit that i'm generally not a big fan of vanilla, so i was definitely not expecting to like this one as much as the other two, but it has definitely won me over and was my favourite of the three. this one is a real winner."
"This is another solid offering from CCB though I probably prefer the original Maduro to this one. It's definitely sweeter and less roasty, but this coffee-lover prefers the espresso version in the head-to-head as well."
"sweet vanilla, almost creamer in a coffee-like, roasted malts, brown sugar, caramel, and light molasses, starts off with sweeter caramel than the other two versions, vanilla domiantes the middle with almost a root beer or cream soda feel, pretty bubbly and sweet rounded, the finish has more vanilla mixed with nuts and caramel, it never gets overly sweet which is nice, instead it enhances what is already there is the brown ale and provides a creamier overall feel, slightly sweet, roasted, and malty mouthfeel, medium bodied, moderate to high carbonation and especially for a growler, taste lingers quite well without being overbearing, could have drank a lot of this, very smooth and light feeling, good drinkability for any kind of beer containing chocolate or vanilla, would drink again, worth trying"
"Pours a clear dark orange/brown, some reddish hints, thin light tan head forms, settles down to a thick ring, touch less lacing than the regular, but still looks good. Smell is insane good, very fresh vanilla, tobacco and earthy, caramel, honey, light nuttiness, sweeter than the regular, some raisin, very nice. Taste is amazing, big vanilla at first, sweet and malty middle, caramel and nuts, woody, raisin, almost tastes like a Colt cigar, great vanilla character. Mouthfeel is the same as regular, medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, insanely smooth and drinkable. Wow, this stuff is good! Has a fine cigar and vanilla character to it that I really liked. Best of the three we had. Thanks Russ!"
"Thanks again to you fogdog for hooking me up with a nice haul of CCB stuff. Hopefully, my return package picks you up just as much."
"Overall probably my favorite CCB beer yet."
"Overall very, very solid. Great use of vanilla here and the light body of the brown ale underneath still shines through. I would not mind having this one every once and a while."
"On tap at a CCB event at Brass Tap (Tampa, FL). Pours a dark brown with reddish highlights and thin off-white head that settles quickly. Aroma is sweet and malty with lots of vanilla and notes of chocolate, roast, brown sugar, nuts and caramel. Flavor is also sweet and malty with notes of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, wood, molasses, caramel and some hints of brown sugar and nuts. Medium body with a pleasing malty finish. A really easy drinking beer that would be great all night"
"A tasty surprise during my crash course in CCB at The Brass Tap. Pours a deep, rich brown color with a tan one finger head. As I noticed in every CCB brew, nice lacing is left around the glass. The vanilla hits you right in the nose, and does so just right. It doesn't overwhelm, but it is present and is at the forefront, the sweet caramel malt smell is still there, though. Vanilla once again dominates the taste, but it really works well here. This brown ale, at its core, is far more robust than other brown ales I have had. There is a strong malt backbone providing caramel, chocolate, and even some coffee hints. This richness is paired perfectly with the vanilla. As previously stated, this is a bit richer than your average brown ale, so a bit denser, but still highly drinkable. The resulting sweetness is about the only thing that holds you back from going for too many of these."
"D: Ok, lots of vanilla keeps me at one or two pints. Tasty, but not quite as good as the Espresso Maduro I had a few nights ago at Datz."
