3.77,6.2,3.5,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"this is grossly underrated, and possibly the best brew ive had from these guys, whos beer i always seem to taste past its prime, and is always seemingly somewhat oxidized or stale, but not this one. extremely english in nature, this is a sweet brown ale, with an impressive toffee aspect that while adding sweetness to an already sweet grainy beer, also adds a detail and a layer not usually seen in the straightforward nut brown, and to me at least, its memorable. hazy pale brown color, not as clean as most in the style, but holding a pretty solid inch of white head, and passing aromas of brown butter caramel, sweet copper malt, and english ale yeast. the flavors all gel real well, with the toffee element playing a prominent role. not sure if there are curious additives in this beer, such as toffee itself, but the grain bill does a nice job of conveying one of my favorite confections in the flavor here, and the english biscuity yeast makes the finish far more palatable and balanced that is appears to be heading for earlier on. just a thin like of sweetness remains at the finish. carbonation could be ramped up a little bit, but i see this one more in a cask setting than anything else, and doesnt really need a huge bubble life. deserves better here on BA in my humble opinion.","StonedTrippin","Jun 22, 2014"

I enjoy this beer and it is one you can do with a marathon session. I typically enjoy brown ales but this one has a very nice nutty finish with the hint of caramel and sweetness. Had this on tap at Duclaw this summer and it is much better on tap than bottle as are their other beers. I believe Duclaw has the greatest difference in taste between their tapped vs. bottled products than other breweries.

Toffee and molasses flavors up front with a bit of metallic edge. Nut flavors come through the middle as the sweet dark caramel malt backbones continues from beginning to end.
