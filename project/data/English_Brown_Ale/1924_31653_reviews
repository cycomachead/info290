"Pours much darker than I expected. Beautiful reddish highlights when held up to light. Very smooth mouth feel with  tastes of toffee, carmel and nuts. Dries to a very light hops finish. Very easy to drink and one of the great brown ales."
"Poured an amber brown with a thick light brown, creamy head that lasts a while and leaves no lacing. Smells warm and of toffee, malt and some roasted nuts. Taste is great with the toffee coming through at first then the roasted nuts and some hint of hops to a finish that doesn't linger. Very smooth and light feel. Overall great beer."
"Even for those who normally avoid dark beers, I think they might still find this accessible. It's remarkably easy to drink, and for those who are looking for a little more flavor in their beer, it's still here. Nicely done."

"Nice toffee notes. Decent body"
"My favorite DuClaw. I use to think Sweet Baby Jesus was their best but I think this is more enjoyable to more people. Great in every way."

"O: Overall this beer is flavored as advertised but is not overly sweet, which I was worried about. Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol and pretty enjoyable."
""
"Smells much better than it tastes."

"o: A flavorful American-style brown (listed as an English brown but tastes too hoppy, although also listed as only 22 IBUs, seems like at least double that - go figger) with both a high degree of caramel/toffee malt sweetness and balancing hop bitterness.  Pleasing."
""
"O - Not gonna get this again, but it was decent. I would really like to see the toffee in a bigger form along with the nuttiness of a good brown, amp up the alcohol too."

"Pours a medium cloudy brown with no head. Aroma and Taste is sweet caramel with a mildly toasted toffee and nutty flavor and mild bitterness. A medium body with good carbonation on the palate. Finishes with toasted caramel malt, toffee with some nutty undertones and mild bitterness. Overall a good drinking brew, tasty and easy going down."

"Very toffee forward.  Nice sweet and malty and certainly something I would get again if I was in the area.  That said of all the DuClaw beers, I had on my trip, this is the one that did not blow me away."

"Decent-looking beer. Off-white head quickly and fully diminishes. Smell is... well, very much as the label implies. Toffee. Also nutty with a little chocolate. Light vanilla. Taste follows suit almost exactly, no surprises from the initial smell. The body is a little thin for the style and the sweetness is a bit too forced, but it's better than I expected. Doubt I'd seek it out again, but not bad."

"Overall – A rather decent and much drier then anticipated nut brown ale. Fairly nice."

"this is grossly underrated, and possibly the best brew ive had from these guys, whos beer i always seem to taste past its prime, and is always seemingly somewhat oxidized or stale, but not this one. extremely english in nature, this is a sweet brown ale, with an impressive toffee aspect that while adding sweetness to an already sweet grainy beer, also adds a detail and a layer not usually seen in the straightforward nut brown, and to me at least, its memorable. hazy pale brown color, not as clean as most in the style, but holding a pretty solid inch of white head, and passing aromas of brown butter caramel, sweet copper malt, and english ale yeast. the flavors all gel real well, with the toffee element playing a prominent role. not sure if there are curious additives in this beer, such as toffee itself, but the grain bill does a nice job of conveying one of my favorite confections in the flavor here, and the english biscuity yeast makes the finish far more palatable and balanced that is appears to be heading for earlier on. just a thin like of sweetness remains at the finish. carbonation could be ramped up a little bit, but i see this one more in a cask setting than anything else, and doesnt really need a huge bubble life. deserves better here on BA in my humble opinion."
"Overall: Very drinkable, and pretty good brew. It's nothing amazing, but still something I'd enjoy to drink again. The smell is the best part."

"Toffee, kilned malt, turbinado, brandy, and tangy dark bitter fruits in the finish. Kind of simple, but good. Dextrinous feel. Could be a tad fuller, but on par for most brown ales. Carbonation is appreciatively mellow."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"The beer is chestnut brown and hazy with a wisp of tan head. The aroma offers toffee, malt, bread, brown sugar. A touch of sweet toffee among brown bread and caramel malt notes. Moderately low carbonation with a touch of bitterness in the back. A decent brew, but not something I feel compelled to have again."
""
""
"O: Very easy to drink, and very tasty -- sessionable by any standard. This one can hold its own with any brown ale I've had. It may not be the pinnacle of the style, but it's very good, and I'll certainly be buying more for future consumption."

"Bottle poured into pint glass. Pours a slightly cloudy dark caramel color. Smell is nutty with ale characteristics. I enjoy this beer and it is one you can do with a marathon session. I typically enjoy brown ales but this one has a very nice nutty finish with the hint of caramel and sweetness. Had this on tap at Duclaw this summer and it is much better on tap than bottle as are their other beers. I believe Duclaw has the greatest difference in taste between their tapped vs. bottled products than other breweries. Don't know if they can improve that but I would drink a lot more of their bottled offerings if they could."

" The taste is light with low malt toastiness and gentle sweetness, kind of like a mild as it has such low flavor, there is a light yeast and diacteyl taste as the nose indicates but even as it warms it is very faint, there is more carbonation than anything driving the taste. Overall it is not terrible but not great since it is not hard to enjoy more than 1, but the lack of flavor makes you lose interest no matter how sessionable it is"

"Overall, a thinner brown ale with good nutty flavor."

"O: Everything about this brew is 'nice'. Nothing more, nothing less. Like most brown ales, it feels safe. Normally safe isn't good, but considering some of the duds I've had from this brewery in the past (oh hai, Serum!), I guess - for once - I'll say 'better safe than sorry'. This one's on the pile of beers I'd gladly drink again, as long as I don't have to buy a 6-pack of it."
"I don't know what to think about this beer. Certainly nowhere near the most interesting of brown ales out there. Weird that there is alcohol heat in a 4.8% beer. I wouldn't get this again, but it was certainly worth trying once."
"Overall: This is a very good brown ale, and unlike any other brown ale that I’ve had. Instead of being either malt of hop forward, it’s very nutty and toffee-like, even more than some nut brown ales that I’ve had. Very, very good. I’ll certainly be getting this again."
""
""
"This is a well crafted example of a difficult style to brew. SImple yet interesting, quite a nice beer that I would enjoy again with friends."
"Overall: Nice, seriously nutty take on an English Brown. Easy to drink but pleasantly complex."
""
"Euphoria pours a brown color with a small lacing head. There is a nutty and toffee enriched aroma. The taste is creamy, sweet lots of nut flavors, finished with a sweet candy like toffee flavors. Good medium body, like no flavors are overpowering. Overall its a very nice rich and flavor Brown. Much underrated."
""
""
""
"Overall, I'd never reach for this again."
""
"Anyway, poured nice int my pint glass. Big ass frothy head that you could float a bottle cap on it, as the dude from Sam Adams would say. I couldn't really smell much, but no offense, I don't smell very well. It lacks body, which I think really hurts this beer. I expected a little more malt balance in this on, but it's just not there. I pick up the toffee, a little coffee, vanilla, and then it just fades to nothing."

"O: A unique twist on a nut brown. Color and malt body certainly trend more on the amber side which make the beer easy to drink and not too filling. It’s good to see smaller beers like DuClaw trying different offerings and trying to find their niche in the market."
""

"loads of coffee on the nose. Clean light brown color. Really nice lacing,some roasty notes on the nose as well. Flavor is upfront and maple syrup smoked complexity. Coffee starts with a creamy mid-palate that transfers to a pleasant grainyness and a hint of peanut shells. Sweet come finish. Overall by far the best nut brown I ever had."

"not a bad beer but just a bit underwhelming. very tasty, and sweet with a dry finish. this seems like it wouldn't be a bad beer to pick up as a 6pk. like it gets better as the session continues."

"I poured this beer into a pint glass, it has a reddish brown colored body with a small head that hangs for a while then lays down to a thin lace on top. The smell has a roastey,nutty smell to it. The taste has a rich nutty flavor with some chocolate to it. It has some sweetness to it and detect the toffee in it. The mouthfeel is really good and overall a really good brown ale."
"O: This beer tasted good, but the ridiculous head and nose kind of put me off. Average overall."
""
""
""
""
"Lighter medium body, decent carbonation, a little thin and chewy on the tongue. A pretty solid brown ale - I enjoyed the cocoa and vanilla flavors that seem to shine through the thinner backbone."
""
"O- not bad, but very easy drinking...tastes a lot different from the bottle than on tap IMO"

"Overall this is not impressing me for the first offering from this brewery. A shame since I got singles of every beer the House of 1,000 offered..."
""
""
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. Very easy going down but not something i found to be terribly enjoyable either. The nose was the best aspect of this with the flavor just not working out too well."
"D a great aroma with a slightly disappointing flavor and a grassy character that is a little off putting."
"Half finger head with nice lacing on a clear copper body. Aroma just as advertised, caramel malts, toffee and nuts. Flavor follows this as well with toffee prevalent providing excellent sweetness. Medium body and moderate carbonation and nice creamy body. Overall a very flavorful beer which each flavor noticed and no clashing."
""
"O: an outstanding beer that I strongly recommend. Go out of my way to grab one at BWI whenever I have time."
"It is pretty light, not too heavy, though not sweet and has a load of dry, roasted nuttiness."
""
"Meh, flavors taste a little artificial. Not bad overall, i guess i prefer more nuanced flavors."
""
""
""
""
"D - A very solid respectable English Brown Ale... Lots of flavor and character for 4.8% ABV... I could enjoy a couple of these in a sitting even if it is a slightly above average English Brown Ale..."
"O: This is an excellent toffee nut brown ale. Very smooth flavor and aftertaste."
""
"O - Nice, drinkable Brown Ale, but nothing new or exciting."
"Got this in the Rep your region IF. Pours with short head with no lacing and only a bit of retention. Aroma is nutty, toasty, biscuit, with some coffee. Flavor has a bit more roast and coffee with.a nice mild caramel sweetness. Really enjoyable. Coffee is a really nice complement to a bit of a mild nuanced nutty brown ale. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. Fine carbonation. Happy the Growler held up so well."
""
""

"O: I'm ok with it. It was a huge hit with my gf."
"Reddish-brown in color with an orange hue and excellent clarity. Poured with a short off-white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Toffee, nuts and dark sweet malt aromas with molasses and vanilla. Smooth, creamy feel with refreshing carbonation and a clean finish. Toffee and molasses flavors up front with a bit of metallic edge. Nut flavors come through the middle as the sweet dark caramel malt backbones continues from beginning to end. A touch of spicy floral hop flavor near the finish as this finishes clean and dry."
"O- Very tasty and full flavored for a low abv beer. Perfect session beer that offers good complexity of flavor and faint malt."
""
"O - Wow, this was a winner...I haven't had the base Euforia but this was awesome...the addition of the gingerbread really added something...like I said this was Christmas/cookie in a glass"

"T: almoust like the smell, but lighter than expected, it shows a medium body"
"This beer poured out as a brown liquid, the head is soapy and light tan colored. The smell had a light nuttiness to it and had heavier amount of coffee on then anything else. The taste has a subtle amount of roasted nut flavors, the coffee dominates most of the flavor. The mouthfeel doesn't have a ton of carbonation, kind of on the flat-ish side. Overall this beer wasn't too bad. Not my favorite brown ale but pretty good and was nice to try."
"Keep up the good work DuClaw!"
"D--Nice flavor but light mouthfeel, not too sweet but not a flavorful as I would have liked."
"Presented with absolutely no head. An appealing mahogany color. Toffee and butterscotch aroma, not much in the way of hops in the nose. Toffee and nutty flavors begin, leading to some sweetness that is just balanced enough by hops to keep it from being cloying. A bit thin, with a low amount of carbonation. I expected a bit more from this, particularly with the nice aroma. A bit of a disappointment."
"Drinkability: enjoyable flavor but light mouthfeel, without being sweet, made this a pretty drinkable brew."
"Rich. Very rich. And oh so smooth. Looked great in the glass, dark amber (almost black) but with golden highlights. Small head that lasted awhile. The toffee scent hits you as you raise the glass, begging you to taste it. The flavor is coffee, carmel, and sweet. Fantastic flavor, but I couldn't drink it on a regular basis. Excellent after-dinner drink."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability, although the flavors could get too intense. I brought home a growler, I liked it so much."
