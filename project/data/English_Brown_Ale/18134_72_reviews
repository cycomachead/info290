"Clear brown with an orange/reddish hue and a thin skim of a cap -- mostly just a collar around the glass. Sweet aroma, nutty and brown sugar, bread and biscuit. The flavour was thin, bitterness was higher and more aggressive than the malt could balance. Notes of grass and mint. Light bodied, moderate carbonation, a bit coarse. Not something I'll go in search of, but not all bad."

"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent beer but there are several other beers in the style that I would pick first."

"Pretty standard english brown. A bit on the sweet side would prefer some more earthy characteristics."
""
"Pours a clear copper with no head or lace. The aroma is caramel with hints of nuts and wood. The flavor is caramel and nutty with root beer barrel candy flavor in the finish. There's also a mild hop bite at the front that fades as it warms. It's mouthfeel is light and a bit watery. Redhook Nut Brown is a decent beer, recommended."

"Decent brown at a decent price. wouldn't mind tipping a few back in the olleee man cave, amirite guys??? *elbow poke*elbow poke*"
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a nutty medium brown color with no head. Zero lacing. Aromas of earth, brown sugar, malts, and chocolate. Taste is a sweet caramel malt flavor up front with some earth and hints of chocolate. Liight, thin mouthfeel. Caramel malt aftertaste. Not much elsee to say about this one. Overall, nothing special and no need to have it again."

"This one pours out a red-brown color with a small head. The aroma is weak, and primarily chocolatey and malty with a touch of nuttiness. A bit thin smelling. The taste is that of a solid brown ale - a solid malty backbone, a bit of chocolate, a slight amount of coffee, and a bit of nuttiness on the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is relatively smooth with a low level of carbonation. The drinkability is quite good. Overall, it's an alright and fairly enjoyable beer, but there's nothing here to hook into you."

"overall just another twist on a style that isn't well respected. i love a well constructed brown ale, as they can be delicious. this isn't one of them."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and quite enjoyable. Nothing overly special to note about the flavor or aroma of this beer though the nuttiness is pleasantly pronounced."
""
"Overall a pretty basic beer, which was actually quite drinkable but nothing special..."
"This beer poured a caramel colored body with a small head and a small umbrella of lacing. Smell was on the weak side other then some roasted nuts, caramel, and a slight hop aroma. Taste followed closely behind but the finish is somewhat unpleasing. My guess is it was overpowered by the spices. Still, not a bad tasting brew. Medium bodied, medium carbonation and an overall decent beer."
""
"O: Looks and feels good but lacks taste and smell."
"O: Well made, nice flavour, just wish there was something more to it. A good introduction to the style."

"It's easy drinking, and decent tasting, but...I expected better from Redhook. It could have a deeper flavor, and thicker mouth-feel."
"Pours a rusty brown color with off-white head that dissipates quickly leaving trace lacing on the glass. Aromas are artificial chocolate and caramel. Tastes are more of the artificial chocolate flavorings, somewhat medicinal, with some caramel & brown sugar, and faint nuttiness in the mix, finishing with some herbal hops. Thin body, decent carbonation. Overall, nothing special going on here. Kind of bland, and I can't get over the artificial flavors I'm getting."
"A medium bodied ale with a light nut roasted malt dryish aftertaste."
""
""
"I think this is a really great beer that is largely underrated. It is a nice take on the style and especially great for the value. I paid $7.49 for a 12 pack. I love buying cool expensive beer but it's nice to find a great tasting, reasonably priced beer. I may be biased as a lover of brown ales but I think this is a very nice beer. My only critique is that it might be a tiny tiny bit too sweet. Other than that, the taste is exactly what I was looking for: nutty, malty, with a tad bit of sweet chocolatey-ness."
""
""
"Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Not bad. Overall, an okay brown that is pretty drinkable, but I'd choose another option given the chance."
"Overall, as a whole, this is a decent nut brown ale. It feels a little too light bodied, but it has a good taste profile and is very drinkable."
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink, although there’s nothing overly special in the taste except for it being quite nutty."
"Very light carbonation. Easy drinker, nice taste. Nicely done."
""
"O: Smell is better than the taste, but it is a decent beer. Warming it is is sufficient however the alcohol bite not well hidden and is too much for me."
"D- more akin to a euro dark lager, considering the body and relative straight laced grain only flavor profile. Not offensive however, and pretty drinkable. Head to head with Sammy or hobgoblin or any English brown, and most American offerings, this one would be a figgity fizzail. (or fizz-ale)"
"D - It's got some (read: hints) of potential, though as is, it's not good at all. I'll pass in the future. I have to ask: Where do the ""nuts"" come in? It's not nutty at all."
"Overall: Not a bad brown ale although I thought it was a bit lacking in flavor"
"Overall: this is a quite tasty and pleasing brown ale. Understated, yet interestingly complex; it's stylistically spot-on and pretty tasty, too!"

"The taste is sweet but not overpowering. I consider this an enjoyable and representative brown ale. Well-done!"
""
"cool old style bottle. i liked this one. pours a lighter shade for a brown ale, can tell its an english style right away. decent off white head. good aroma of medium roasted malts. flavor is well blanced, lighter than a lot of browns, but a nice palate. a little bittersweet in the finish, like mild hops meets semisweet chocolate chips. its pleasant and subtle. mouthfeel is a bit light for a brown in my book, but it works just fine here. nice carbonation and a good finish. an underrated beer on here in my opinion. very sessionable"
""
"O: Smooth, full bodied. A decent brown ale. A bit on the light side, but I'd drink again. Love the ""antique bottle"" look."
"It doesn't really hit the ""brown ale"" category. Fairly average ale."
"Overall - A sessionable beer, but very lackluster for the style."
""
""
"Pouts a transparent hazelnut color with a one finger off white head composed of fairly large bubbles. Head retention is less than average, slight lacing is left in my glass. Aroma is roasty, sweet and earthy. Mouthfeel is a little on the light side for the style. Taste is of caramel malt, roasted malt, nuttiness, earthy hops. Carbonation is average. I think this beer is enjoyable, but it doesn't stack up against the leading brown ales. However, if you just want an enjoyable amber/brown beer red hook's nut brown would be a great choice."
"Definitely worth buying. Twice."
"Can not argue with the price, these folks are converting large numbers and are due some respect."

"D - Pretty good take on the style, and an easy drinker. I haven't seen this one around lately though, I hope they don't stop making it."
"The pour was simply great. Rich dark brown in color with some nice bits of light shining through on the bottom of the glass. A smallish head rises up from the bottom of the glass and gradually settles down into a thin, but nicely placed pad of foam. Aroma is caramel malts, hints of roasted nuts and a nice shot of piney hops. Well put together and definitly more robust then I thought it would be. As I take the first sip a light to medium body washes over me and thoroughly impresses with its depth. Caramel, bready tones, hints of light hops all seem to come together nearly perfectly as it fades in and out of the palate. Really easy to drink and superbly sessionable, I had no issue at all with finishing this one off"
"Drinkability - Very nice beer i would buy again. Goes down nice without the overbearing citric flavor Redhook has had in previous styles."
"Nitro can often mask the aroma of a beer, and by extension, it's taste. That might appear to be the case here, as this ale has very little flavor to speak of, and this leaves some unfulfilled expectations for the style. All that can really be tasted is a dry, all-purpose flour and water mix with a sawdusted finish. It might be said that the minimal flavor at least achieves a certain benign cleanliness. But there's nothing sweet or nutty here and the malts lend no enticement or pizzazz."
"Opinion: This beer is alright. I am a big malt-head, so I like that it is malt balanced...however it is really underattenuated. I think that it could be a good bit more dry and leave out the roast...but that is just my opinion. I'll certainly finish my glass, but this isn't one that I will be seeking out in the future."
"Drinkability - Easy to drink and goes down smooth, but it is not anything special."
"Cheers!"
"Thought it was pretty decent beer, just weak in comparison to what I expect a good Brown Ale to be. Malty for sure with a light caramelly, toffee malt base and a mild nutty, chocolatey undertone. Balanced with bittering hops, but no real flavor or aroma from hops. Medium body, but thins toward the end. Finishes pretty clean and crisp for a malty beer. Weak looking, similar to a cola without the fizziness. Head retention wanted to stick around, but wasn't really able to. Would have again, but won't go far out of the way for it."
"Pours an amberish light brown with about half of an inch in rather thick foam head on top. The head is a nice treat actually, not expected. Strong nutty aromas permeate the nostril cavities, along with a touch of caramel toffeeness. It's not a sock-loser, but no disappointment either. Mouthfeel is average, if a bit thin without being too watery. Flavor is dominated by a sweet buttery toffee, and a slight background of nuttiness. Finishing the swig is enough hop character to be noticed, not really expecting more than that for this style. All in all, seems to be a well balanced brew for the style, falls short of the brews from England, but is also cheaper than those brews, so there's a reason to try it, other than a slightly above average session brew here."
"I think I could have stood for a little more carbonation in there."
"A creamy mouthfeel with hints of hazlenut, fig, and roasted malt. No noticeable hops. Not overly complex but good and smooth hence a drinkable beer."
"12 oz bottle pours a solid deep brown color with a light head over top that doesn't seem to want to go away. Clarity is excellent, with a healthy carbonation cascading up from from the bottom of the glass, helping maintain that head. Nose is caramel and brown sugar sweet, with a underlying nuttyness and melanoidan toastyness that meld well together. Its a good balance of roast/toast and sweet. Flavor is more dominated by the nutty charcter, but with a light brown sugary sweetness there to balance. It finishes very nutty, with a mild toasty melanoidan character. I like how the flavor really stays on into the finish. Its very clean, with nothing in there to get in the way. As I drink more of it and it warms up, there is an almost orange tinge to it, that I could do without. Feel is moderate with a light to moderate carbonation. I could stand a touch more carbonation to keep it from feeling too thick and break things up a bit. Its not bad, just what I would do differently. Drinkability on this one is good for me. I'd like that orange character to not be there. Otherwise this is a nice brew."
"I am not the best judge of a nut brown, but i would put this one up there with bell's brewery's nut brown. it has a lot going on and a fantastic kick at the end. I would encorage people to try it. I'm a big fan and i hope to have more chances to tast it."
"I gave this beer a try this spring. I didn't buy it with too many expectations, but I was pleasantly suprised. This is not your average nut brown, it has more of a herbal, refreshing taste to it than a nutty carmel flavor. It is great for what it is labeled for, enjoying on a spring day."
"I really wanted to like this. I love a good brown ale (e.g., Hex Nut), and I really love Redhook's ESB. Just didn't do it for me. Probably won't buy again."
"Dan o.k. brown ale, glad I tried it, but doubt I will have it again after I finish this 6 pack."
"d- very easy drink i can drink alot of these, i would not buy this again but i still enjoyed it."
"Overall, i dont know about this one. I'm a fan of their esb, and it tastes they use the same hops. But i just think this one falls short of the style. Not bad though, and i will enjoy my other five, but dont think i will get this one again; perhaps next year."
"This was a fairly good beer. It was a medium brown color with a tiny bit of red. It had a thick coffee-colored head with good lacing. It had a nutty, sweet smell. The taste was a little disappointing. It was mostly just sweet, with a minimal amount of hops. I couldn't discern the coffee/chocolate flavor that the banner claimed was there. Still, an OK beer."
"Never one of my most favorite beers, but it is a good example of the style."
"Pours a three-fingered cream head that fades quickly leaving a trace of lace. Nice clear, deep amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Slight nutty nose. Starts on the sweet side with hops in background and finishes fairly smooth. $1.25 for a 12 oz bottle from Capital Convenience Cocord, NH."
"The beer pours a dark red/brown color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a toastey nut scent that boasts of crystal, bisquit, and victory malts. It's dry with a slight malty sweetness. The taste is good. It has a light, yet malty flavor that is smooth on the way down and dry on the finish. It has a light crystal malt sweetness and a nutty aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. I prefer a maltier beer with less carbonation, but this has good flavor and aroma as well as being quite drinkable."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin and easy, but is played out nicely by excellent carbonation. The drinkability is good as well. I think this one is groing on me the more I drink of it. Definitly worth a try."
"Pours a medium brown color with a small head that has ok retention and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has some toasted malts and some nuttiness along with a good bit of hops. Smells ok. The flavor is a little disappointing as it seems dulled down. Some toasted flavors and a little but of nuttiness, but it's just not very strong. The mouthfeel is moderate and the drinkaibility is good. Just needs some more flavor."
"Drinkability: Body is light and the hoppy crispness makes it pretty quaffable. The only thing is, it's rather boring and I probably wouldn't bother to have more than 1 or 2 unless somebody brought a box of this to a picnic and nothing else."
"Aroma is sweet and cola tinged and even that is very low intensity. Dark brown body with reddish tinting holds a wispy pinky sized head. Fruity malt sweetness in the fore. Tastes very much like licking the frosting off a cheap 711 pastry. Im not getting the nutty flavors that are supposed to be here just a sweet malty mildly yam tasting melange. I really want to like Redhook and I always buy their stupid seasonals, but they just always seem to mail it in with their beers."
"D - The drinkability is OK. This is a pedestrian brown ale. Not bad, not great."
"The mouth feel is on the light side of medium bodied and has just enough carbonation."
"Pours dark brown with a creamy kakhi head with decent head retention. Pretty good lacing I might add. Taste is sourish. Tastes like a brown ale. Mouthfeel is sorta sticky. Drinkability is quite good. Just as long as you like the taste. I liked their ESB better but this is not impressive to me. I would say I like Turbodog or even Pete's Wicked as far as English Brown ales go. It is more intense than TurboDog by far."
"Overalll this is a pretty damned decent beer. A little too cloying for me to drink all night long, but it's good. I'd drink more than a couple."
"Poured a very deep mahagony color with slightly off-white puffy head that feel to a thin ring. Left nice lacing on the side of the glass and was easily revived with gentle swirling. Smell is very mild with only a light maltiness present. Taste is pleasant enough with a light roasted maltiness and a mild bitterness in the background. Finish is also very mild with a light maltiness and light dryness to be found. A very middle-of-the -road beer that is not offensive, but not very exciting."
"This beer pours a nice transparent reddish-brown color with a light, off-white two-finger head that drops quickly to a very thin, white head. The aroma is a bit fruity almost like stale nut and malt. Hrrm. (No, it's not expired.) Flavor is a bit creamy and nutty with an aftertaste that lingers and reminds me of a macrobrew attempt at a nut brown. Not terribly pleasing. The mouthfeel is thin, borderline watery. It's drinkable, but I don't know that I'd want to drink much of this. I have three bottles that I need to pass off on friends. Not remarkable."
"However, it's not a bad brew by any means. I actually picked this up on a really spring feeling day and it actually fit in pretty well."
"Pours a very clear dark mahogany, with orange/ruby highlights. One finger head, semi-dense-not much retention and minimal lacing. The nose is a nice blend of english hops, caramel and a nutty aroma. Packed with crystal malt flavor and a mild nut taste in the back, the aftertaste shows both herbal english hop flavor and dry american citrus. Light to medium in body, with a smooth and even carbonation. Clean finish and a good balance of sweet malt to fresh hops makes this a great session ale."
"Body is lacking and feels barely above light, with a forced carbonation mouthfeel and smooth, crisp texture. A no-brainer and easy to drink."
"Red Hook has succeeded in creating an American version of a British classic, with a beguiling taste and aroma that could be just what you are looking for when sweater weather comes around."
"Overall, this is a decent brew from the RedHook folks, but nothing to rave about. I'd drink it again but it's not something to pick up on a regular basis."
"Not a bad American Nut Brown, but nothing special either."
"Rich brown amber color with a nice tan lace for a head. The aroma is dominated by a roasted malt and a sweet nuttiness. The taste is mild. Nothing is over done. A good blend of maltiness and grains. Has a toasted malt semi-dry aftertaste. Meduim mouthfeel with a little carbonation. Good drinkablility and is a great session beer."
"Will I buy it again? Sure. A good beer, nothing extra special, nothing objectionable."
"Nut Brown is dark brown in color with a nice-sized, light brown head. The aroma is rather weak and clean. Just a touch of hops and nuttiness are noted. Taste is very much of nutty malts, with an almost sugary sweet finish. Mild hops are noted and give the beer a little more personality. The mouthfeel has a nice creamy texture that stands out. Drinkability is pretty good, as this beer goes down really easy, however this isn't interesting enough to make me come running back for more."
"Overall, it is not a bad beer, and, one of the better from Red Hook."
"This is one mellow brew. And while this means its easygoing and drinkable, it also makes it somewhat unremarkable. Would make a decent session beer. All things considered, its not that bad. Recommended (but only barely)."
"Drinkability: Easy to put down. This would be a good beer to use to introduce a mainstream beer drinker to brown ales. Might help them get past the fear of darker beers, since this one doesnt taste very deep and dark. Good, but nothing special."
"Pours a dark reddish brown and has a tan head that leaves a bunch of lace. This is a very mild brown ale, a favorite of mine because of it's outstanding drinkability. When it warms it gradually becomes more flavorful, nutty flavors abound. This beer is definitely better at cellar temperatures. It is a great winter session beer for the nights when you want a mellow brown ale."
"Overall Impression: Very poundable. No off tastes to slow down a session, but some nice depth and subtleties to keep you interested. I like the hop presence that started low but seemed to build as I got deeper in the glass. I think this is my favorite offering so far from Redhook, Id happily drink some more!"
"Poured out to a beautiful brown/red color with a lacey off white creamy head that quickly dissipated. Scent of sweet roasted nuts was most noted. Complex sweet flavor of nuts, with a touch of hops and a slightly sour after taste. A very drinkable brew that I would recommend to those who like oatmeal stouts and other brews of this sort. I really enjoyed this beer, and taking into mind that this was brewed under a semi-mass produced guise, i'm very impressed."
"Not so bad if you want a lighter interpretation of the style, just not very complex at all."
"Nice looking brew, deep brown/red, thick voluminous tan, frothy head with good staying power, smell is roasty, taste is tobaccoey, sticky, sweet that gets you in the back of your throat, I think there is a distant hop presence but it doesn't really matter, hops won't help here, once again I just don't like browns."
"Dark red-brown color light tan 1"" head, appears somewhat sticky. Smell is very light of roasted malt and a hint of chocolate. Taste is murky with muted malt and minute hops. Body is way too thin. Tastes like a macro brewery trying to make a cheap brown ale."
"Reedhook Nut Brown pours a brown color with a medium head. I enjoyed this beer. Its flavor is by no means overpowering, but the nutty and malty taste are quite pleasant. The creaminess of the beer gives it a nice mouthfeel. This is definitely one of Redhook's better offerings."
"A decent brown ale with an excellent mouthfeel. Not being a fan of the style in general, this was one of the better brown ales I've tried."
"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. The beer poured a deep brown color with a decent head that left a little lace here and there. The smell was very nutty and good. The flavor was very nice with great nutty taste and a sturdy malt backbone. The hops did not shine through that much but the smootheness of the beer made up for the lack of bitterness. A good offering from Redhook."
"A bottle from Acme Bar and Pizza. Poured a reddish brown with a moderate head. The aroma was nutty with a slight hint of hops. The taste was nutty. It lacked the hop kiick that I was looking for, but it was malty. Not bad, but not great. Something I would buy if I was limited on choice. I should have gone with the Ubu."
"On tap poured into a Redhook Nut Brown pint glass. It pours a deep reddish brown color with one finger of head. There is a little bit of lacing left over. The smell is malty and nutty, not too much hops present. The aromas aren't very strong. The taste is more on the malty side, just a little nuttiness coming through. Only a small bit of hops on the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly light and watery. The drinkability is pretty good though. Just an average nut brown."
"Poured into a pint glass, formed a 1/2"" light brown head on top of a clear brown hued brew. Aroma is malty, with the scent of hops evident as well. Taste shows lack of body, but does illustrate an attempt at a malty flavor, with little bitterness present. This is not as good as the sample I remembered having on tap last spring, but I have to review what I have in front of me. It is easy drinking and smooth, but seems to be lacking in that brown ale heartiness that one might expect."
"Appearance: Ruby chestnut brown tone with a nice sized creamy tan head, leaves behind lacing strung evenly. Aroma: Mellow nut tone rich malty ale some fruit tones peek through not bad at all. Taste: Clean unoffensive some caramel malts touch of nut with amild hop bitterness decent option from Redhook much better than their IPA. Mouthfeel: Medium light body slight creamy texture. Drinkability: Easy drinking could have a few, was glad to try it but nothing will keep reeling me back to this one just a decent beer."
"This beer pours smoothly and through my pint glass looks almost as if it were maple syrup. It may be psychological, but it seems to have a wonderful nutty taste almost like a snickers bar. It's not too heavy like some darker ales. It could stand to be a bit more bitter for how dark of an ale it is though."
"This is a nice, drinkable brown ale. Is it earthshattering? No. But it goes down easy, and might function as an introductory dark ale for someone who equates dark with bitter."
"12 ounce Bottle, bottled on date of 010504, FRESH! Pours almond with an off white head, nice malty, yeasty nose. Malty, nutty flavor, hops also, tastes of under roasted chessnuts. Oily, grainy, bready mouthfeel. Light to medium bodied. Decent malty ale, pleasant quaffer."
"Bottled on date in Jan of this year. Poured into a pint glass with almost no head and left no lacing behind. The beer has a clear chestnut brown appearance with more than ample carbination. Too much in my opinion for this style. Has a slightly nutty, toffeeish malty aroma up front. The malt disappears fast in the middle and is overtaken by herbal hops. The finish leaves some of the nuttyness behind. I feel that the body is way too thin and the hops and carbination are taking centerstage where the malt should be. It would be something I could drink if I had a limited choice between this and macros but not something I will go out and pay for again."
"A mellow, medium bodied, smooth feel, a very nice session beer off the cask."
"This beer poured to a dark brown with almost no head. Carbonation is also very mild. There's definitely nuts of a brown variety evident in the taste. It tastes a little rich, but the flavor is decent. It seemed to improve as it warmed, at least to a point."
"Dark brown reddish color body with a thin tan color head. Smell is sweet consisting of roasted malt and caramel notes. Aroma is not hoppy at all. Taste is of roasted nuts with a sweet and mellow maltiness. Slightly sour in the end. The nut flavor is a little artificial. Taste is not even in the same ballpark as the other great brown ales out there. Tasted a lot like New Castle - just not as sweet. A mild tasting brew with a smooth mouthfeel. Pretty easy drinking."
"Dark mahogany body topped by a very fluffy ivory head. The lacing on this brew is quite impressive. Aroma is a blend of the strong malt base and some sense of the light hopping. The taste is very even and mild with a good sense of balance. Teamed with almost any kind of food this beer will be a great complement. Clean, crisp finish and very good drinkability."
"Char"
"Drinkability  This is really (so far) the only Redhook offering that Ive liked. It is flavorful, easy on the mouth, dead-on for the style, and with the low ABV makes a great session ale."
"I found this to be a good session beer. Unfortunately, when I went back for more I was told it was no longer being produced. At least I got to have one."
"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and slightly nutty. A lighter bodied brown ale. Malts are slightly roasted, nutty and somewhat sweet. Hops are mild, slightly bitter, and a touch citrusy. Taste is a little thin. It's a VERY drinkable beer, but not really very interesting. That's not meant to be a rip. It's a nice beer, but it doesn't really have any distinguishing character to it. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly sweet."
"A pretty nice beer, if a little dull. A good party beer, something to drink when you want flavor, but are more concerned with being social rather than paying attention to your beer."
"Okay, I stayed away from this one as long as time permitted because I was reluctant to respond to the numerous (and mostly) positive reviews I heard regarding this particular Red Hook brew. Too sweet for a Nut Brown. Maybe thats just me, but Samuel Smith N.B. more accurately summarizes what I'm looking for in a nut brown ale. Nose is sweet (caramel), taste and mouthfeel are sweet and syrupy. I hate to reduce myself to making such statements, but this is a 'chick beer' at best. I might have enjoyed this a little more if it was the first beer of the evening."
"A tasty little brown ale. Perfect session beer."
"A dark red / brown color gave off to an OK white head. The head fades fast with very little lace. A malty slightly nutty aroma. There is a slight hint of butterscotch in there. A slightly nutty taste with an all malt finish. I thought the taste was a bit week. Over all a close to average brew."
"Served a translucent reddish-brown, long-lasting (excellent retention) beige head, loads of lace eye-candy in a glass. Clean, malty nose, sort of weak in aroma. Malty, nutty clean palate, faint bitterness, and kind of dry with only minor lingering sweetness. Medium-light body, thin, creamy mouthfeel. Above-average but nothing Id seek out, drinkable. Id have it again in a pinch."
"The beer is a dark reddish-brown color. nice head, but it pops away quickly to almost nothing. Seems to be very carbonated. Smells woodsy and a little like chocolate. Taste: not enough umph, but malty and smooth. Weighty, but not thick. keeps the palate clean. Nearly perfect weight and aftertaste, very appealing and highly drinkable."
"Poured a beautiful dark brown to an almost dark red in color.Maintained a half inch thick solid white head.I was very surprised at the appearance for being a Redhook beer.Showed a good amount of lacing while still retaining some head.The aroma had a bready,earthy,and very malty smell.Leaves a long bitter after taste.Full-bodied with a crisp mouthfeel.Nothing watery about this one,,Its plenty thick.The overall taste isnt too appealing to me.It has a strange finish that I cannot make out as far as taste.The appearance really impressed me though.The only time I drink anything from Redhook is either at a hockey,baseball,or football game."
"Edit: I had to reduce my rating a bit on 4/9/05. This brew is a bit thinner than the last time I rated it. It's also a bit sweeter."
"Pours a clear brown with orange highlights and is wearing a tan 1-finger hat of head. The aromas of a nutty esters, malty notes, and light butter flow from the head of this beer. The taste is not a repeat of the aroma as this beer is on the watery side. It has a light roasty and earthy grain taste with barely any nutty flavors. After the nice aroma, I was slightly disappointed in this brew. This is a light bodied beer that finishes watery thin. Cheers!"
"drinkability - average"
"Pours dark burgundy in color with a thin tan colored head that quickly fades into a wispy lace. Nose is sweet chocolate with a touch of spice. Medium-bodied and the taste is sweet roasted chocolaty malts, caramel, nutmeg, and only a hint of nuttiness. Some notes of spicy hops come through towards the end but are fairly subdued. A pretty nice brown ale, though I was hoping for more of a nutty flavor. Still, its one of Redhooks better brews."
"Actually though bland in some departments this is an excellent beer to have 5 or 6 of after 9 hours of physical work!!"
"The standard looking brown ale,nice medium brown color with minimal tan coloed head.Smeled nutty like the name says with malty sweetness coming through.Taste was a little bland compared to alot of others of the style I have had,sweet but I like a more earthy taste in my brown ales.This like alot of brown ales was too watery thin at the bottem of the glass.A more mass produced version of the style,but drinkable I guess."
"Color is amber brown with a light head, sort of lacey. Smell had a light, sweet malty tang. Taste was very clean and smooth with some slight caramal malt flavor and a small sweetness. Light feel of sweetness and tang at the finish, light-medium body, somewhat watery. This is a very mild brown without much going on. It can be sucked down very easily. I drank half before I could really start making out anything. Lightly flavored and pretty drinkable."
"It's reddish-brown, throwing off a smallish head that leaves lace all the way down the side of the glass. Little is happening in the smell: a trace of malt sweetness and barely noticeable carmel. The taste is also a bit lacking. Nut(?) Brown Ale? If the nutty flavor is there, it has concealed itself well. A bit of carmel flavor comes through and the hop bitterness helps to liven things just a bit. The mouthfeel is on the light side, but it does go down pretty easily. I'd gladly pay more for Samuel Smith Nut Brown Ale."
"Clear deep burgandy in color. A thin beige head disappears rather quickly. Lace patterns are sporadic at best. Some citrusy cascade-like hops accentuate the chocolate qualities on the nose nicely. There's a slight nuttiness to the flavor, but not as much as I'd prefer. The roasted quallities are dim and the hop profile is not as big as the nose leads you to believe. Body is about medium and the carbonation a little high. Not a bad beverage, but not one I will seek either."
"Pours out a nice brown amber with a good head. A nice mellow malty brew with a good hoppy taste to it. It's got a great flavor to it. This may be a beer to lure the non BAs away from their wrongful ways with. Another great ale from Redhook! Try it on tap if you can get it."
"Ok, it's getting there. Close to room temp the malt and cocoa last a little longer. Strange that there seems to be some alcohol in the finish. This is a decent beer, but I think it's too light and thin for a brown. It needs a little more everything."
"Clear cinnamony brown color, decent 1/2 inch light tan head on a hard pour, fairly heterogeneous bubble sizes. Drippy laces. Slight berry aromas, mostly blueberry, along with a vague toasty maltiness. Low carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. A decent amount of caramel and cocoa (not chocolate) malt flavor with a bit of nutmeg. Really, little sense of hops at all, fine as accompanying the gentle malt sense. Finishes similar in body as it starts. Redhook brews never excite me, but this one is one of their better examples, fine as a pleasant (if unchallenging) Brown Ale (with a bit of wheat pitched in)."
"Bottled: 01/09/02 Tasted: 01/18/03"
"Nice deep brown color on the pour, the head modest in size, frothy consistency, lace adequate, both a light beige color. Malt dominates the slightly nutty sweet nose. Sweet start, relatively skimpy top, delicately hopped, sparingly acidic, dry aftertaste, Ive had both the bottle and draught versions, seem to be about the same to me, drinkable, and would make a good session beer."
"This brown ale pours a nice, dark brown color off the tap, but there's no head to speak of. Tastes of sweet maltiness and possesses a nutty character, as well. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, leaving much to be desired. Due to the rather watery mouthfeel, this drinks easily, but it isn't one that I plan on coming back to in the future. Fairly standard fare all the way around."
"Ed.'s note: add a pinch of granulated brown sugar right after the pour, let it settle into the head. Adds a nice big fluffy tan head and balances the watery finish. Happened by accident as I was cleaning my kitchen."
"First off, I've never had a beer that smelled this bad while tasting so good.  It had a caramel scent, with very heavy undertones of wet dog.  At this point I was sure I'd hate it, even though it looked pretty appetizing (nice dark reddish amber, with a healthy head).  Anyhoo, bottoms up.  Surprisingly, the brew tasted pretty good.  Chocolate and hazelnut flavors combine to form a smooth, tasty beer.  Maybe I should actually drink this from the bottle?"
"Pours a nice brown with a light tan foamy head that sticks around pretty well.  Smell is caramely with some roasted malt in the background.  Roasted malt and some light hops are the first to hit the tongue.  The hops are soon subdued by the caramel and background nutty flavor.  Smooth across the palate and very drinkable.  I really like this brewery.  They don't ever make anything that blows my mind but all of their beers are at least great session brews.  Consistent quality and very widely available.  This or another Redhook brew are often what I fall back on when I am at a bar with poor choices."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass longneck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Clear medium-brown that poured a two-finger head and held a serious lace. Big time malt nose. Malt start with hints of chocolate and an underlying roasted barley flavor finishes with bitter hops. Well-balanced and toasty. A touch of roasted barley mixed in with the sweet malts give this beer its nutty taste. A fine American Brown. I'm honestly surprised the average review is as low as it is, This is a mighty tasty brown IMO."
"Looks good in the glass.  Smells like, well, beer.  Not a terrible malty brew, with hops barely peeking its head now and again."
"I'm not real big (or real experienced) with brown ales, but I like this one as an easy drinking beverage.  I love the toastiness of the malt..Not overly sweet either, and after binging on doppels the past month this hits the spot nicely.  Not a powerhouse of flavor but pretty tasty for a brown.  Easy drinking with a twinge of hop bite on the back of the tounge...seems very balanced and easy drinking.  I really think this is pretty good compared to the handfull of brown ales I've tried."
"Drinkable, not harsh at all but thin it is. More or less riding on the lightness with a slight toasted malt flavour. There are far better brown ales out there."
"Notes: Very drinkable, an excellent ale for light beer drinkers that want a little more."
