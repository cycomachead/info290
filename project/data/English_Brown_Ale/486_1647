This was turning out much better than I had expected. Finish was semi-dry with the nuttiness being offset by a butterscotch-caramel-toffee flavor.

Served from bottle into a Samuel Smith imperial pint. Poured a deep red-orange with a five to six finger cream colored head that subsided to three finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, subtly roasted malt, nutty, earth, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, tart, caramel, nutty, and wood. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. I was concerned that this one was going to be infected based on the amount of head that formed upon being poured gently into my glass. Upon smelling the brew it didn’t seem like there was any infection evident. But on the flavor there was the slight tart note that one would not expect. It was not sharp or strong, but it was definitely present. Still a fairly easy drinking brown ale that I wouldn’t mind having again sometime.","thagr81us","Feb 16, 2012"

Foam leaves lots of lace as it recedes, and the ale is a very dark golden amber with enough translucency to differentiate it from a heavier style. Has a good deal of carbonation, and some hop bitterness, leading to the aforementioned bite. It also has some of the caramelized sweetness you'd expect, though, and lots of malt, although not as heavy as some browns I've tasted. I just had a pint, but easily could have had more.

Nice smoothness with a subdued dry backbite. Has caramel sweetness and maybe some sugar cane with a little tartness from the hops. A low-key quality brown.","clayrock81","Jan 19, 2009"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"pours a clear earthy brown body and a slightly brownish head. the smell is nice and malty, bready with some caramel and molases, a little toasty-ness. nice and smoth, balanced overall flavor. the front is mildly sweet, hint of alcohol. not as much maltyness as i would have expected. just a hint of a hop kick at the end, but still within balance of the rest of the flavors. the most interesting flavor is the hint of burnt toast in the after tase. Mouth feel is chewy, frothy, slick. and drinkability is pretty good, this could be a session beer.","danadeny","Jan 17, 2009"

Not what I expected. Kind of like old beer, but when I tasted it, yummy, very nice. The taste of malt filled my mouth, followed by an ever so slight hops. Very nice finish.

The warm, inviting color coupled with a light tan head makes a very pleasing presentation. The aroma is sublimely malty with a slight chocolatey note and a hint of hop aroma. The hop presence in the flavor effectively supports the maltiness for a very well-balanced brown ale.","tsewong","Mar 27, 2008"

Not noticing a caramel flavour like I found in the aroma. Rather, an earthy, somewhat buttery flavour of malts. They seem to diminish a touch in the finish, but don't know if making it 'bigger' would change that or ruin it all. All around, it's a nice and straight forward brown, and something that could show further potential with tweaking over time.","Proteus93","Sep 29, 2007"

3.93,3.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Served a crisp brown with a decent sized head that was somewhat quick to diminish. The aroma was of roasted malt, slight burnt caramel and a hint of hops. The taste had a great roastiness to it along with some subtle caramel and a hint of chocolate. The hops were quietly doing their job in the background. The beer was medium to light bodied with the alcohol well hidden. This is a very enjoyable brown ale and certainly worth trying if you're in the area.","atsprings","Mar 28, 2007"

3.69,-3.1,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Aroma is very fruity with apple dominating and notes of a more sugary sweetness. Red/brown body holds a world champion fader of a head that leaves tiny white slick. Lots of caramel malt, fruity apple and pear along with peantu skins and meatier nut notes. The flavor is spot on for the most part, but the alcohol is a touch more noticeable than expected for the style. Still a decent Brown.","Jredner","Jun 18, 2005"
3.87,1.6,4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,"22 oz. bomber with no freshness date. It pours a reddish chestnut color with a dense 2 finger off-white head that looks very nice, reducing to a half inch and leaving some lacing on the glass. There is a lot of diacetyl on the nose, mainly butter and caramel, along with some perfumy hops and maybe some nuts. It has a medium body that is tingly and it tastes like leafy hops, diacetyl, some malt in the background, and a distict bitterness that is not quite controlled by the malts, though it tastes low in IBUs. Overall a pretty drinkable brown, but the body wasn't thick enough and it wasn't too complex. However it did pair well with some Pepperidge Farm Milano cookies.","mmmbeer","Apr 09, 2005"

Smell was barely perceptible with some maltiness showing up. Taste starts out like a typical brown ale then the aftertaste ruins it for me. In an effort to be bitter it merely comes across annoying like a kid trying to get a attention by acting up rather than just saying ""excuse me."" I found the aftertaste distracting and it discounted any hope I had for this beer. Mouthfeel was about right, not quite full, but coating the palate up front.

Taste is initially subtle caramel sweetness. A middle note of toasted hazelnuts comes in followed by a kind of bitterness found in burnt sugar ALA creme brulee. The flavour is nice and deep and not water or too sweet like some brown ales I have had recently. Mouthfeel is good. One thing about legend is that they seem to always taste fresh. Drinkability is good as well. While not a session brew in my eye, I wouldnt mind a couple of pints of this in an evening. The best Legend I have had so far.","TinusTime","Beers"
4.13,8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/2"" beige head over the burnished copper brew. Head is resilient, and laces well. Aroma is is malty, with a sweetish component, vanilla, perhaps. Taste is sweet caramel malts, with that vanilla flavor so strong as to seem artificial adding a bit of depth. Mouthfeel good and drinkability high. And interesting take on the style, I like it, and would love to find it on cask...","ppoitras","0"
3.71,-2.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"It arrived in a 20oz. English Imperial Pint glass with an amazingly thick and creamy white head that really reminded me of a nitr-tap brew. Distinct and impressive rings of lace on the glass as this one was drained. Color was indeed dark golden. Aromas were very different from what I'd expected. I was thinking I'd be able to pick up something resembling a hoppy note but all I got was a very pronounced ""applesauce"" aroma. I'd be curious to see what hops they used in dry-hopping this. Flavor, too, was not very influenced by the hops, IMHO. Pretty mild, and toned down by the conditioning in the cask. Quite malty-caramel sweet up front, tempered nicely by the hops. Finishes with a sweet, tangy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice...creamy smoothness coates the palate. I really like cask-conditioned beers and this one was easy to drink. One that I would certainly order again.","OldFrothingSlosh","Sep 12, 2003"

I'll also have to add that I enjoy it more on tap than from a bottle. The mouthfeel is a bit fuller and smoother on tap. The malt charateristics are more dominate. The malt is a little on the sweet side, but doesn't take away from the brew. The hops while still present, tend to have a less citric quality then I had noticed in the bottle. With no other craft brews to choose from at the River's Inn, I'll continue to be a happy customer as long as they keep this one available. Good session brew.","byrd","Jul 05, 2002"

The aroma says nutty, and it is, but its in the back fringe of the flavor profile.  Stops just short of making your mouth giddy.  Can be dangerously seductive which leads to mass consumption.  Then when you stand up the alcohol kicks in and the world spins.  Tap version far superior to bottle.","DrDocRudge","0"
