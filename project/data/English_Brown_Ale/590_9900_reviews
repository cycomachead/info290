"I actually liked this beer a lot. Not often into brown ales in general, but the malt and toasted nut character was really nice. A little bit of hop character which was nice. Very drinkable."
"Nice mahogany brown hue with great clarity.  A half inch of tightly knit khaki colored head rests on top.  Nice Brussels lacing. I can smell chocolate,caramel, and earthy hops.  The flavor is very subtle notes of caramel and chocolate.  I don't taste the hops I could lightly smell.  The mouth is moderately carbonated,creamy,and dry."

"Tasted boozy for the abv level.  A good winter warmer."
"New Glarus never fails to please.  Nice roasted scent with a hint of sweetness. Smooth medium body with lively, light carbonation. A nice roasted flavor with a hint if hops at the end, with a pleasant nutty after taste."
""
""
"I'm still not one that enjoys the Belgian yeast taste and this one was the same. It's a good beer, just not my favorite example."
"This is just God awful"

"Great nutty brown ale!"
""
"Stay close to the restroom if your drinking these - they give my stomach a turn for the worse. Maybe that's because I have 12 of them in 1 sitting, I don't know. I tend to stay away these days - NG is better known for their fruit beer."
""
""
""
""
"Another delicious beer from New Glarus. I have to admit, I was cracking mixed nuts and eating them while drinking the beer. I felt corny doing that but it was fun and certainly didn't hurt the flavor experience!"
""
""
"Overall / Drinkability:  A very nice brown ale.  I had this beer many years ago in Milwaukee and seem to remember it as more coffee-like in taste, but that was almost 6 years ago now and my palate has changed.  I'm still enjoying all the roasted malt flavors though.  Went well with food (stuffed shells with cheese and butternut squash) and I would not mind having another one, but sadly I only have the one bottle.  A very good brown ale."
""
""
"New Glarus never disappoints. A good beer to sit by the fireplace with."

"Overall, another great beer by New Glarus, definitely worth trying."
""
""
""
"O - I am biased as this was one of my first craft beer loves, but it still gets the job done years later.  It really is just a nice simple light brown ale - take a pale ale, toast the malt a touch and back off the hops... Nostalgia wins extra points but it really is just a nice every day beer"

"Flavors are very subtle and subdued. Beer is ok, nothing special."

"One the best brown ales"
""
"It had great taste and feel"

"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a ""pint"" glass. Pours brown with a small white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of caramel, nice fruitiness, and a hint of nuttiness. Tastes of fruit with a tad of nuts. Beer is light bodied and nicely carbonated. Overall, a very good beer."
""
""
"This is a quality nut brown ale. Great toasty flavors and a rich, warm flavor make this one seasonal I constantly crave year round."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Sweet malty caramel smell. Light brown in color with a white head. Lots of malt flavor. I like the nuttyness too. Similar to Fat Tire, but much better. At $7 a six pack, this is great!"

"Taste is deliciously nutty, with a tinge of fruit peeking through. A world-class brown ale, and one I'd turn to again."
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a well made craft beer. I probably wouldn't make this an everyday beer, but I enjoyed it and would recommend others give it a try."
"Overall: Fairly nice. It is good, but I'm not sure where this beer would fit in as far as time of year. Maybe best in the fall? I'd buy it again, but it would sit in the fridge until I was feeling... squirrelly."

"Brown ales fail to excite a lot of the time, but this is a pretty easy drinking one even if it isn't exciting. Sweet, but not too sweet...and they don't try to re-invent the style by overdoing hops. So I approve."
""
""
""
"overall just a very solid English brown. not my favorite style, but this is spot on."
""
"Yellows and golds highlighting this light brown beer. Sweet malts and herbal hops equally in the nose. Thin mouthfeel; sweet caramel flavors marry with a lighter taste, wheat or maize perhaps? Gives it a tang reminiscent of an All American Lager. Finishes on a herbal, slightly resiny hop finish. More body and bolder flavor would improve this brew, but it's a satisfying and fun brew as is."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Although the typical brown ale flavors were present they just were strong enough or the could have meshed better."
""
"Very bland. Just ok. Again, this beer would be rated much higher if it was slightly more creamy."
""
""
"Overall: A very enjoyable, tasty, and drinkable EBA. About as good as a brown I have ever had. The malt flavor is awesome."

"O: Decent...decent. Not better than one of my favorites, Avery Ellie's Brown Ale, but still quite good. The roastiness is a bit too strong for this type of ale, in my opinion, and it's not quite sweet enough. Definitely good, though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - It is okay. I had a great nut brown ale yesterday, and it is still in my mind, so this beer suffers a little because of that."

"I sampled this beer at the great taste of the midwest in Madison. I think the beer has a good taste and afterwards is also nice. Its hard to go wrong with any new glaurs product. Tried to get the oldman into darker beers. Baby steps babysteps. this is my first post sorryif it sucks. Patato sausage"

"High B-"
""
""
"This is the best brown ale I've tried. I really like the nutty flavor it has and it's made locally here in Wisconsin. I've been craving it lately, but I can't find it on the shelves of my liquor store anymore."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty solid, but not a huge winner for me. Aroma and flavor profiile overcame an average mouthfeel. I admittedly don't love browns by my nature, but overall its a relatively pleasing and sessionable. Worth a shot, but not close to a staple."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"This is interesting in that it has a neat nutty quality to it. The hop balance is very, very well done; just enough to be pleasant. I liked this a lot more than I remembered."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Interesting brew. The interplay of sourness and nuttiness is different."
""
""
"O-Excellent example of an English Style Nut Brown Ale, benchmark for the style"
""
"Pours brown with an off white head with decent retention and lacing. Smells and tastes like nuts, toasted malt, biscuit, and light caramel. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Not bad, but not worth seeking out again either."
""
""
""
""
"Thanks to Jessica for bringing this back from a visit home. It poured a light brown with a finger of head that left good lacing. The aroma was mild caramel with some nuttiness; a mild aroma. Mostly caramel. I found more flavor than nose, caramel again was number one followed by the nuttiness. The finish has some crispness, which I liked. Nice mild creaminess on the mouth feel. This is a good brown ale and I would drink it again."
"A solid brown ale, but it feels a little unrefined. Easy drinking and I definitely wouldn't pass it up if offered a bottle, but I won't be seeking it out."
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: A refreshing brown ale."
""
""
""
""
"Pour looks like liquid brown sugar with an off white head. Smell isn't powerful, but is a nice toasted malt. Taste is a nice balance of malt flavor, with some subtle sweetness. A smooth medium mouthfeel, nice carbonation and flavor balance. Overall a nice beer, great flavor, very sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this is easily drinkable, but it's also kind of ordinary and bland. Not very memorable either."
""
""
""
""
""
"Ideally suited for standard American pub fare, I'll happily welcome this semi-robust ale with cheeseburgers, chicken wings and hand tossed pizzas. It's a non-offensive beer that meets many occasions but might leave the beer connoisseur wanting more."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
"O: A nice English Brown, very true to style and easy drinking. A solid beer."
"Overall: A very solid version of a Brown Ale. Dark and toasty taste with a solid bitter balance."

"Investigating the empty bottle I find ink-jetted numbers that could be a Julian dating code. If so, this beer was bottled almost 3 moths ago, which I don't consider old. Amazingly -- a somewhat disappointing NG beer."
""
""
"As good as Sam Smith Nut Brown(my standard)?..Yes"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – This is a really nice English brown ale. It has a wide breadth of malt aromas and flavors while maintaining a solid English hop presence. This fits the Northern English brown ale style nearly to a T. Really tasty and very drinkable. So pumped that I finally got to try a beer from New Glarus!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:Super tasty. This would be a staple if I could get it around here. Nothing fancy but clean and what I want in the style...plenty of nut and malt and light hop balance..A nice autumn beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A good beer, nothing great but I did enjoy it. Paired with the right food this beer would be taken up a notch."

"O) This is a really well put together brown ale. I was told this may be replaced by Black Top as a year round brew from New Glarus. It would be hard to argue against that decision, but I hope this makes an appearance as a seasonal, if that in fact turns out to be true. This is really tasty brown. Glad to recommend..."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Pours caramel in color, mostly transparent, with a minimal frothy off-white head (even with a vigorous pour). Cola-like carbonation can be seen clinging to the glass. Aroma is consistent with caramel malt, along with some mild hops. Taste is also mild, consisting of caramel and nuts, with just enough hops to balance things out. This makes for a very drinkable yet unremarkable brew. I think I would have enjoyed it much more if everything about it was more concentrated--bolder flavors, thicker body, etc. As it is, it makes for a suitable session beer, but nothing to write home about."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a decent, lighter brown ale. It has decent flavor even if a bit subdued. I'm glad I was able to try it once, but I'll probably seek a more full-flavored brown ale in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Fat Squirrel is an English Brown Ale, and as such, pours a clear chestnut brown color. Eggshell colored head dissipates quickly, and lace is minimal. A mild nuttiness covers most of every other aroma, with only a slight caramel and bready malt presence noticeable. A malty sweetness begins and grows throughout, with hints of coffee and nutty flavors cutting through the sweetness. Medium-full in body, this English Brown Ale is also higher in carbonation. Pairs well with grilled steaks!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A well made beer that fits the brown ale style perfectly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this a pretty great Brown Ale. Classic toffee and nutty character. I love the subtle coffee/chocolate hints. Impeccably balanced. Perhaps a bit light on overall flavor and body, but you can't deny it's drinkability. Recommended to any who can find it. Cheers!"
""
"Reddish brown in body with large fluffy white head. Smells of nuttiness, slight hazelnut, slight coffee. Tastes of hazelnut, sweet maltiness, nuttiness, and a lil bit of cola. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. A little too sweet for me but overall pretty good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""

"O=A nice, lighter option for a brown on a summer day, but not nearly as flavorful at Ale Asylum's Madtown Nut Brown."
""
""
""
""
"This poured out as a clear looking brown color. it had a light fizzy head on top that left behind some film over top of the beer. The smell of the beer had some toasted malts with a light earthiness to it as well. The taste of the beer gave of a slight nutty flavor with some dry malts in there as well. The mouthfeel is easy going, light enough to drink a few if you choose to do so. Overall I thought it was a pretty good Brown Ale. I wouldn't turn it down if it were offered to me."
""
""
""
""
"Appearance is a deep brown with one finger of tan head. It has a nose of chocolate, nuts and barley. The taste of fat squirrel is lights malts, hazelnut, a little bitter. Mouthfeel is light, rather easy going english brown ale. This finishes with a clean, crisp aftertaste. A very nice beer from these good people out of WI."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I think the taste is a little on the average side. The other characteristics are good."
""
""
""

"overall: very surprised about this brew. have always passed it up in the past, but will now definitely return to it. NG makes such great beers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm glad this tasted much better than it smells. The carbonation was a bit high, but still an alright beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: good just not crazy over nutty but really exceptional for the style. Nut browns are an interesting style since no nuts are present in the grist but it's an acquired taste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-good all around brown ale, I wish it would show a little more on the nose but will definitely try to find when I am in Wisconsin again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - this is STILL my favorite New Glarus staple beer. spotted cow is good and all, but i think a little on the over-rated side.. this one's an underdog that should really be making it on people's top lists."
""
""
""
"Overall: Love this because it is a good easy drinking beer. Tastes great in general, but after consideration, it is a bit too sour. I still love New Glarus and they consistently deliver quality beers."
""
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty. The malt is nice and sweet with plenty of nutty flavors going on. The hops add a nice spice. Just a well rounded Brown Ale. Very impressed!"
""
""
""
"O: This beer is very easy to drink and goes down easily."
""
""
""
"The title is amusing, but the beer is pleasing. It pours a clear, dark brown with a finger of foam and plenty of carbonation. The aroma is light, nutty and a bit of malt. It's quite tasty with the nuttiness and caramel mixing together. The body seems a bit thin, watery. It goes down easy enough."
""
""
"Pours a medium brown color with a head that leaves thin layer of carbonation on top. Scents of caramel malts and roasted malts tickle the nose along with some toffee hints. The taste is smooth yet full of flavor. There's the sweet caramel malts, roasted hazelnuts, and other nutty flavors. Drinks smooth and is a great year round beer but definetly would drink best in the colder months. One of New Glarus' two most famous beers along with Spotted Cow."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this beer, it goes down smooth and easy and I could drink a few of these in a roll."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a good brown ale, and another good beer from New Glarus. Lots of nuts in the taste and some light hops, and easy to drink. If I were in the mood for a brown ale and this was sold on the shelves I'd certainly have it again."
""
"Overall pretty undistinguished. A nice enough ale, but a bit more prominence in the malt would have rounded it out and given a bit of depth. As it was, the beer was a touch thin and leaning toward astringent. One to go through and then move on to more interesting offerings."
""
""
""
""
"O: Goes down smooth and easy. Good flavors. Thanks again, Chris."
""
""
"This beer has a nice brown color body with a 2""light brown head that lays down pretty quickly to a think lace. The smell is of roasted malts and some nice earthy hops. The taste is of malts and carmel and is has a nice nutty flavor to it. The mouth feel is nice and crisp, rolls off the tonuge nicely. Overall this is a good tasting and well balanced beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: very well balanced beer and the flavors were subtle but full at the same time. great beer, very drinkable. Delicious."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An excellent brown ale. Diverse enough to be interesting yet without too much going on that you feel you don't know what you're drinking or that you're missing something. Also seems like a great session beer, not so malty you feel your mouth is coated and balanced enough to easily have more than one. Would definitely enjoy this in front of a fire, be it indoors or out."

""

"An interesting beer that doesn't wow me over, but it's very drinkable."
""
"Pours translucent brown with a khaki head that dissipates quickly leaving very little lace. Smell is earthy, lightly toasted malt and caramels. Taste is lightly sweet and bitter, light roasted malt, biscuits and tea, and a bit earthy. Mouthfeel starts creamy and has good carbonation but seems watery. Overall this is a pleasant English brown"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
"Overall: Not the best of the New Glarus beers. It's not bad, but it's nothing too special for the brown ale style and a little too thin. I won't seek this one out again. This actually makes me want a tastier classic Brown Ale, like Samuel Smith's real English Brown Ale."
"M - Thin body. Fairly dry and doesn't linger too long on the palate except for a mild residual sweetness. Good carbonation."
"O - Nice beer for an English brown. It has more of a sweet side that may attribute to my enjoying it more than most English... anythings. Slight nut flavor is very nice accent to malts and carbonation almost perfect. Great beer for a fall day!"
"O - glad its avaialable. Not readily, but still available. I enjoyed, and will probably enjoy another soon."
"O: this brown ale borders on the sweet side of the spectrum, I found myself searching for something to balance it out...but it never did. It is quite refreshing and drinkable, but misses being an excellent beer by lack of balance."
"D/O- The New Glarus tick-a-thon keeps on truckin'. I couldn't remember the last times I had this beer...3, 4 years? Either way, great session-able brew right here."
"Notes: Tasty and pretty interesting brown ale. Great mix of flavors and a nice hoppy undertone. Good brown ale that while maybe not outstanding or something I would crave, it is a very nice drinkable beer."
"The aroma is as it should be, mild but pleasant. It's pretty brown in the glass. I already ordered two, so I like it. More may be coming..."
"Mouthfeel is too thin for me. Light bodied with lower than expected carbonation. Pretty drinkable. As it warms, the mouthfeel starts to thicken up, but still not at the right point. Overall, a decent brew, but too sweet and thin for me. If you're into malt bombs, go for it, otherwise there's better things to pick up if you're getting New Glarus."
"This beer pours a subtly hazy brown with a big 3 inch cap that disappears into just a thin cap. Massive amounts of lacing covers the inside of the globe. Nice looking beer. The aroma is fairly complex for most brown ales. Up front notes of sweet caramel, toasted breads and just a hint of roasted nuts. Underneath all that is just a bit of sweet cherry. As it warms the cherry comes through a bit more and just a hint of chocolate. The flavor is much the same. The cherry and sweet fruits is just a bit more pronounced. Roasted nuts and toasted bread. This is a tasty beer. The mouthfeel is about perfect for the style. There is a nice creamy smoothness at the front part of the mouthfeel and it finishes fairly dry. Just about perfect. Overall this is a fantastic beer. New Glarus hits more home runs then any other brewery in my opinion. Just like everyone else that doesn't live close to Wisconsin, I wish I could get it here."
"If not for the slightly overdone bitter aftertaste this would be a standard for me. As it stands I'll certainly have it again, just not as often as the less flavorful, but also less bitter Sprecher's Pub Brown Ale."
"O: Quite flavorful and well constructed. Impressive."
"Decent brown ale, definitely on the English/sweet side. Wish more of that hazelnut that's so obvious in the smell were present in the flavor. Not bad, but not my favorite."
"O - I could drink this stuff all day. The sessionability of it is insane. The flavours are nice and bold, yet not overwhelming. So far this mixer pack is nailing it on every level."
"Exceptional brown ale offering from New Glarus. The roasted malts in this beer make for a very pleasant aroma and taste. This poured very nicely, with a thick creamy head. The beer is very smooth as well. I was definitely able to pick up the hazelnut tones within this beer that the brewery marks on the bottle. Great variation of the style."
"I love Wisconsin. This brewery seems to be one of its hidden gems. Looks good. Hefty brown with good lacing. Just the right amount of head. She'll do! Smells wonderful like toasted almond, bread, grassy hops, and some alcohol. Taste is lovely toasted, but definately subtle enough to let other flavors shine like mocha and honey. The mouthfeel is outstanding. Surprising, I thought it was going to be similar to the Belgian Red, but I was wrong. Very smooth. I really don't know how a brown can get much better. I could drink this 24/7. Better off I stay south of the boarder!"
"Pours a light brown with good layer of head (I did a different pour with this one, so it's hard to comment. Toasty, nut malt aroma with an herbal background. English malts some are saying? Yummy. Wow, yum is right. Great toasty, nut flavor with a light bitterness making me want another drink NOW! Carbonation is low, body seems adequate. Reminds me of Fat Tire, although technically a different style. Glad I got this from my brew partner the other day!"
"Overall: This was an easy drinking example of the style."
"Overall, this is a fantastic beer. A great anytime beer that goes well with an American meal or it can stand on its own, like it is right now. It's not a crazy assertive bal-aged bourbon brandy apple tripel eised whatever have you, but it's not a boring beer that gets a ""meh"" from me. Thanks again, Amanda!"
"Pours a medium chestnut, some head. Vague smell of almonds and a little bit of coffee. Not real impressive or assertive. To be fair, maybe I should have let it warm. Does come out of its shell as I drink it, a more pronounced nut flavor with a little bit of hop pizzaz. Tasty. An easy drinking beer. Would love to try it again at a warmer temperature."
"Dark translucent chestnut with a pretty nougat colored fluffy head that leaves sheets of lace on the glass. The aroma is faint coffee, sweet malt with a trace of evergreen. Toffee-like malt with a roasty coffee kind of bitterness in the finish. Medium lean bodied with scrubbing carbonation. A well made, no frills kind of Brown Ale."
"Malty and smooth, light tobacco and maple suggestions, apple, generally mellow with a light astringency, a little watery. Easy drinking and sessionable, reminds me of autumn nights in a rural WI cabin."
"O: this is one of the best brown ales I can remember tasting, which is all the more impressive as a year-round offering from New Glarus Brewing. I could get fat on these."
"O) A well crafted, true-to-form English Brown. I would definitely pour another one into my glass."
"D/O: Interesting beer. For a brown with a nut theme (not really my style), I did enjoy this beer."
"This is an awesome brown! Great flavors, great drinkability. Just a solid brew. Right up there with Hazelnut Brown Nectar as my favorite brown."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability: Yet another awesome offering from New Glarus. It is like the Wonka factory for beer. Not only is the beer true to style, the aggressive hazelnut character makes it distinctive."
"Had a Fat Squirrel this past weekend. I poured the bottle into my glass and it had floaters...D&MN IT!!! I hate floaters! Yje color was definitely a Red/Amber, but had no head. The scent was really non-exisitent....maybe hints of malt. The taste was quite good for an amber. Was full bodies with nice malt charactered with a spruce of caramel. This beer is easy drink and could certainly be considered a session beer. Enjoy!"
"Tastes of lightly toasted hazelnuts, the legume-y characteristics that unroasted, unsalted peanuts have, caramel malt hits mid sip and backs away hesitantly under cover of a mild earthen hop umbrella. Finishes up dry overall compared to some other brown ales on the market. Texture and body are a bit too thin for my liking on this sort of flavor profile, but that's about all that is missing from this brew."
"O: a solid brown ale, it might benefit with some more body and color, but overall, this is easy drinking, malty and unoffensive."
"O- A nice brew, glad I was able to try it. This could pair well with a wide range of foods as well."
"O: This is a really good brown ale filled with malty goodness. Very straight forward approach to the style."
"D - Good beer; another great beer from NG; I think they do a fantastic job of blending unique ingredients into an enjoyable beer; a good English Brown Ale"
"O - This is a lower-tier beer for me, of NGs regulars (though still quite decent). For example, I far prefer Snowshoe, or Spotted Cow, to this."
"O - Brown Ales aren't my favorite so I'm slightly biased, but this is a solid, above average brew."
"This pours a nice caramel brown and has great foamy retention and layered lacing. This beer is what you would expect in a brown ale, a lot of sweet malt. I just don’t love this style of beer, but this beer does have a nice crispness that takes away from the syrupiness. This teeters on the edge of burned malt red ale type flavors. I detect some booziness. It has a decent medium body and is a good beer for the style. I just don’t love brown ale."
"O - I'm happy with this beer. A great beer to pair with any type of food or drink on its own as a sessionable beer. Very good"
"O: one of my favorite brown ales. Cost me almost 25 bucks a six pack to get it shipped to me but it was well worth it and I'd do it again."
"Clean and bright - a refreshing brown."
"O - Had no idea what to expect from this brewery as it is my first from them, and it didn't disappoint my very open expectations. I would drink it again for sure but not seek out. I think the shock factor i experienced was the sweetness that i was not expecting at all, with that being said it is not overly sweet just didn't expect it at first. Good beer."
"O: Good, nice brown malts, good flavors, not overboard on anything, nice hop addition, just a little thin though."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are fairly rich and really well balanced. A really amazing example of a brown ale. Love the mix of sweetness and earthy flavors."
"D: Good, I liked this beer but I think it had more of a Fat Tire taste to it and I would prefer one of them."
"Not a bad beer. Very MOR brown. Very easy drinking, no off flavors. A decent session brown."
"O - Overall an enjoyable beer and a pretty easy drinker. I'd actually prefer this to be a bit smoother, but that is only a minor, personal preference complaint. Definitely well made...the hit of American hops is an interesting and welcome addition...a bit of an irony, maybe - but it is what it is. Not an all time favorite, but I could easily go back to this one again."
"Thought I didn't like the style, seems like I just didn't like the beers in the style that I have tried."
"D- I found this to be a nice beer that is easy to drink. It could be better, but it is a solid beer. My favorite parts of the beer are the smell and the packaging."
"Pours with a nice head, not thick but stays for a long time. Very nice lacing as well. Smells of citrus and sweetness, but bitter hops are present upon tasting and, with the citrus, make a very pleasant drinking experience. The aftertaste is akin to light, roasted coffee. Fat Squirrel Ale is a brew I definitely enjoy drinking, even in mass quantities."
"This is on the sweeter side for brown ales but still boasts plenty of toasty characters. Aftertaste is caramel sweet. Very nicely done but I would expect nothing less from New Glarus."
"This beer pours a darker brown color, with a small head that lasted throughout the beer. There is a strong nutty smell to it. The taste while smooth, is strong, and there is a nice sweetness, with nutty flavors, but a strong malty bitter taste to finish. Full flavor, with nice carbonation. Overall a really nice brown ale, very enjoyable, would deffently get another."
"Taste was very roasted malt with a little caramel and some hops. The only drawback(although this is English style) was the slightly dry or metallic mouth feel. Otherwise, this is a very enjoyable beer."
"Slick feel somewhat. Rather nice drinking"
"Poured into a glass. A little cloudy copper amber color, not a ton of head. Malty smell, relatively strong. Sweet malty taste, but of nut flavor. Fairly bitter aftertaste. Pretty smooth drinking beer. I don't mind it, although I'm not sure I could drink too many of them in succession."
"The taste was great. A very good brown for the $$. easy drinking, yet flavorful. The taste was the same as smell. The hop presence was minimal."
"Drinkability: This is a very nice Brown that is tasty and goes down easy. I would drink this again. Blows away the latest version of Newcastle....IMHO."
"D - This is my third of four ""main"" NG beers and they are getting a little better...the flavors and nose on this beer were very nice...a hoppy finish is always nice in a brown ale but I wish there was a little more to the feel"
"Serving type: bottle"
"D: I could drink a few of these. I'd buy 6 and order another."
"D - Gave a fat squirrel to a friend that loves fat tire and he immediately wanted more. Very drinkable, the sweet from the finish lingers in a positive way. I'm a huge brown fan and this would easily make the rotation if i could get it regularly."
"Overall impression: Easy to drink, and easily recommended."
"Beer is medium in body and caramelly in the mouth. A very nice beer all around. It's moderately sweet with a slight bitter finish. Overall its a decent beer, I'd have it again."
"Very light for a nut brown ale. It's really simple on the nutty profile with a lot of hops compared to other nut browns I've had. The smell is pretty blah with very little on the nose. It's thin bodies and highly carbonated. Very drinkable for what it is but overall not that great"
"Future outlook: One of the better brown's I've had....not a style that usually demands my attention, but this one is so well put together that I must say ""well done."" Nevertheless, an out of state brew that doesn't come down here, so probably won't have this again soon."
"Carbonation is normal definetly not a lot. Body is lower medium, and it would make quite a delicious session beer, I just wish I could get it here."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it was a very easy drinking and flavorful beer. It had some nice malty and nutty flavors to it and was very smooth. Very nice beer for the style and a very nice beer overall."
"Mouthfeel is thin and light, barely sticky. I think it's a pretty solid beer."
"Overall not sure what to make of this one other then it being damn good. A really interesting and very, very well crafted ale."
"M & D- Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy with a good amount of carbonation. I could drink a few of these in a sitting. Overall pretty good beer."
"Pours a translucent brownish amber with an average foamy off white head that left some nice lacing. Aroma of Toasted nuts, some citrus and malty sweetness. Flavor of, toasted malts, a light hop bitterness balanced by a great nutty maltiness.Decent brown ale! I would like to have this regularly in my area (hint hint New Glarus)"
"Pours a light brown/dark copper/amber in color. The aroma is sparkling, sweet malt and tart hops in a nice harmony. The flavor is nice rich roasted malt, much more substantial than the aroma let on, balanced with a nice tartness on the finish. I lived in Scotland for a year and this reminds me of a really nice Scottish ale."
"D - An exceptional ""go-to"" save for it's inavailability outside WI. I know New Glarus has a reason for it but it prohibits me from having this beer more often."
"Thanks for bringing this one back for me Dan. Poured into a shaker, dark golden color, almost amber, with a little tan head on top. Aromas of toffee, roasted nuts and light milk chocolate. On the palate, this one is fairly full-bodied, somewhat creamy, with brown sugar, dark bread and a light chocolate-caramel (like a rolo) finish. A pleasant beer to drink, but too heavy on the palate to be a good easy drinking session beer."
"Pours a moderate brown color with a light off white head. The nose brings some light caramel and toffee plus slight nutty characteristics. Taste is doughy brown that is slightly nutty and some light caramel sweetness. Medium feel with good carbonation. Nice and simple and drinks well."
"D: A very sessionable beer that's just a tad too sweet for my liking. Very much in the vein of New Glarus beers though. Decent, but not outstanding. I wouldn't hesitate to revisit this one though and I could see it being a standby for some."
"D - It is on the high side for a session beer that has a bit more robust roasted character."
"Thanks to florida9 for this one. I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. It pours light amber with a 2 finger white head, no lacing. Lots of caramel sweetness, nuttiness on the nose. Taste like it smells, it finishes clean with just enough hops for bitterness. Well carbonated, medium body, easy drinking. An all around solid brown ale."
"Drinkability: Seems to be very drinkable from the great combination of simple flavors. A true brown ale should always be pretty drinkable and this beer is an excellent example of the style in regard to drinkability."
"Overall - I liked this a lot better the first time I had it. It actually prompted me to pick up Ale Asylum's Madtown Nut Brown Ale, which now ironically makes Fat Squirrel seem worse..."
"D - One of the best beers New Glarus produces. Definitely a beer you can throw back quite a few and enjoy yourself. The 5.8 is were the flavor is and this goes great on an crisp Autumn day. Another great time is early Winter by the fire. Worth giving a go if you are not a huge Brown Ale fan."
"An excellent Brown Ale. Lots of great flavors, that most American versions seem to miss. Along with Goose Island's Nut Brown, this is one of the best American made versions. Highly recommended."
"D - One of my favorites of New Glarus regular offerings. Just enough flavor to back the alcohol and keep it an easy drinking beer. A beer well worth picking up regularly."
"The final brew taken down during the Man's Weekend (for me, at least). It pours a semi-hazed amber-garnet topped by a half-finger of off-white creamy foam. The nose comprises fish batter (LJS-style, seemingly), toffee, buttery biscuits, and some light orange zest. The taste holds notes of light walnut, light toffee, light orange peel, and some blackened biscuits. The body is a light medium (or heavy light), with a moderate carbonation and a sorta grainy feel. Overall, nothing overtly special, but a decent enough nut brown. A nice end to one helluva weekend ride."
"Was able to pick this up during the weekend in the Northwoods. It pours a brownish orange with light fading white foam. The smell is of malt and hazelnuts along with roasted caramel and hints of orange zest. The taste isn't too far off from the smell, but it is far less complex. The caramel malt is the main flavor and the roasted malt gives it a slight bitterness. The problem is I wouldn't go as far to say that it is a Nut Brown, as the label claims. I honestly don't taste the nuttiness that I was promised. There is also a souring from what I assume to be the hops. The carbonation seems a little weak to me, but it's not too bad. If you ignore the fact that it's supposed to be nutty it's a nice solid brown ale."
"Revisited this brew after a few years and while I'd like just a little more malt flavor and body in this, it's obviously a very well-done brown ale and a very easy drinker. No trouble at all putting down quite a few of these and continues to be a favorite brown ale."
"O - This is a great beer that I wish I could get here in Cali (or anywhere else that I travel). I'll probably be trying to set up a trade for more of this very soon."
"Smooth mouthfeel starts it out but as the finish kicks in a slight metallic pinch shows up. It's not bad but it does take away some of the greatness to this beer. Mildly carbonated with a medium body this is a tasty beverage well worth checking out."
"very drinkable."
"New Glarus Fat Squirrel pours a red/brown with a nice off white head that lingers. The aroma is sweet, raisiny malt with some earthy notes. The flavor is crisp and malty but not as sweet as the aroma. Similar toffee and dark fruity notes upfront, with some nice mild, herbal and earthy hops. Not much in the way of bitterness, but enough to balance the malt."
"pours a majestic looking brown with a thin head. hazelnut, vanilla, some coffee dominate the nose. Similar flavors are at play, and to great effect in my opinion. Malt dominated, but not sweet; no detectable hop bitterness. Finishes rather dry. Solid beer for sure, and very sessionable."
"Alewatcher, I'll be over soon with that ABT!"
"The mouthfeel is, as usual with New Glarus beer, pretty damn good. The body is about medium with a nice level of carbonation and a smooth velvety feel-- almost slick on my tongue. This is yet another solid beer from what is rapidly becoming one of my favorite breweries. Very easy drinking-- I could gladly drink several of these at a pub somewhere in the Northwoods while ""Nashville Skyline"" played softly in the background... Oh, I actually have already done that... Well, I'd do it again."
"A very well-crafted beer from New Glarus, one I'd buy again if/when I return to Wisconsin."
"Good beer, fun label. What more could I ask for while watching the Hall of Fame game?"
"D: Overall very nice, very straightforward. This seems like a nice everyday type of beer. Solid enjoyable, and repeatable."
"D: A bit boring, but it is a fairly pleasant and drinkable beer nonetheless"
"D: I think this to be a great drinkablity of the style, subtle flavors are nice on the malt forward side and for the color and cream notes, it is a very easy drinking brew."
"D-My base assumption here is that you _could_ drink it over and over, and you certainly wouldn't end up in a horrible shirts-off, barstool-skootin street fight, but you might have trouble driving home if you didn't pace yourself. So....um...high marks on drinkability with a slight caution; I say."
"A: Decent head with good retention, medium amber in color, a few sticky spots of foam along the interior of the glass - 4.00, S: Very nutty and with loads of caramel and quite a bit of roastiness on the nose, I also appreciate a dry malt aroma - 4.50, T: Malt plays the primary role in Fat Squirrel, some coffee and nuttiness are the first flavors to step up to the plate, hop bite is noticeable though in the background - provides an earthy and somewhat grassy zing - 3.50, M: Medium bodied and with a slight silkiness - 3.00, D: All around a solid beer, coffee flavors play a larger role than I'd expect but I enjoy coffee, quite drinkable - 3.50"
"The mouthfeel is on the thin side for a brown ale. Maybe this helps to make Fat Squirrel plenty drinkable. Just right for when I am in the mood to drink a couple of beers and call it a night. I will seek this out again the next time I travel to Wisconsin."
"Drinkability: Highly sessionable Brown Ale that seems like it could be in a pub in England. The only downside is that it is a little too light on flavor."
"Great Job New Glarus!!"
"4/4/4/4/4.5"
"Drinkability -- Got to hand it to New Glarus, they know how to make a refreshing beer. Depth of flavor is a bit lacking, but that's not their main focus. Mind-blowing? Not really. Drinkable? YES."
"Drinkability is good. Although this seems to be missing a little something from a complexity standpoint, I wouldn't turn this down."
"Ovearll, this is a pretty decent offering form New Glarus. Nothing exceptional, but an easy drinking ale that still has some decent flavor. I'd be interested in trying this on cask."
"Though not particularly bitter, the malt dries nicely on the tongue and easily avoids being too sweet and every bit of what bitterness it has shows itself in the finish. More toast, slight chocolate, light caramel. Carbonation is soft, body perhaps a touch thinner than I'd prefer but not out of style, and very, very drinkable."
"D: Pretty good; really a very easy to drink beer. Quite approachable. Just not very interesting."
"Flavorful, refreshing and very drinkable. A good interpretation of the Nut Brown/English Brown Ale style."
"Drinkability is quite good. I'll definitely enjoy a few more bottles before calling it a night. New Glarus beers at a gas station? Heck yeah, Wisconsin."
"D: Fairly easy drinking brown ale"
"D- Surprised how much I enjoyed this one, could drink it all day."
"this is a nice craft offering that highlights the subtle malt, yeast and hop flavours and balances them in way that leaves the drinker underwhelmed yet appreciative of the style and the concoction in from of them."
"Easy to drink, but not much going on to keep me interested."
"Would I buy more of it? - absolutely, this is a great spring beer when the nights aren't as warm as you wish they were!"
"Pours a clear reddish chestnut brown with a light tannish head that fades to a cap with minimal lacing. Nose is very toasted and nutty, not overly complex or strong, but slightly sweet and pleasant. Flavor starts with the nutty flavor again, medium bodied with sharp carbonation and mild bitterness. Finish lingers with sweet nuttiness. A very pleasant, drinkable brown. I could enjoy a few of these, but is nothing remarkably special (which isn't a bad thing)"
"Pretty good beer; nothing substantial to detract from the drinkability."
"Nothing is offensive about this ale, pretty straight forward. Solid."
"D: This beer is actually quite drinkable due to the light body and subtle flavors. Not overly complex and pretty enjoyable."
"A nut brown they say, an amber I see. I have problems with this beer, because its nice and tasty, clean and all around unoffensive, but this is not a brown ale. It's transparent, lightly ambered in color, and has a reasonable amount of fizz. Where are the earthy notes and heady brashness of a true brown? Maybe I am being overly harsh, but give me some chutzpa with my browns."
" ~ This brew is much better than I had remembered. It has a sweeteness and smooth texture that make it worth trying."
"I've had this beer many times before and practically lived on it in college ($1 mugs of this all day every day at my favorite bar) and this bottle just wasn't exactly what I remembered. The date code only says it is about 4 months which isn't terrible but maybe not ideal. This was my first craft beer I ever tasted and will always have a place in my heart. I still remember on the morning of my 21st birthday going out with my friends and buying a 12 pack of High Life and a 6 pack of Fat Squirrel. I really hope I just got a bad bottle and it just isn't my fond memories overlooking the just above average beer. I will have to pick up another bottle of this and do a re-rate."
"Fat Squirrel Ale is probably my favorite New Glarus beer so far. It was actually a little sweet. I could definitely taste the nut flavor at the same time, it was almost like roasted nut though. It was something a little different. Any New Glarus fan or English Brown Ale fan should give this beer a try."
"The palate opens quite rich and nutty (again), with a nutty bitterness, a burnt sugar character and some toffee. Definitely nutty with almost a little astringency, this is solid stuff. Drying on the finish with a lingering hop bitterness that's earthy and a little spicy, this medium-light bodied beer has a moderate level of carbonation. Drinkable stuff, I'd like to try this on cask."
"Solid English Brown Ale. Not flashy but no complaints here."
"The taste is a brown ale mixed with skunk and at the end a little malt. This is not good by any means. The feel is very light, not drinkable."
"D-I believe this can be a good beer. Don't drink too warm, otherwise it can taste very run of the mill. Okay, but I think there are others I would try in this category."
"D Very good with that great brown ale taste to keep you coming back for more. 4.5"
"Pours orangish-brown with a white head. Not the color I was expecting from a brown ale. The aroma is very nutty with some malty sweetness as well. The flavor is nutty with some sweetness, about like the aroma. Lighter mouthfeel and lower carbonation."
"The taste is clean and restrained. If this isn't your style, Fat Squirrel isn't going to change your mind with a mind-blowing out-of-the-box interpretation. However, if you like a nice, sessionable English Brown, it's going to be hard for you to get much better. Although subtle, the flavors are actually quite complex. It starts with a walnut/hazelnut flavor that's gradually supplemented with a sweet caramel note that fades into a bready finish with some light hop bitterness underneath. In keeping with the style, none of the flavors is particularly strong, but the balance is impressive, making this an extremely drinkable beer."
"Taste has a moderate malt sweetness, with a nutty, caramel character. Malts have a toffee-like character. Medium-bodied with a dry finish and lots of carbonation. I'm a big fan of brown ales and this offering from New Glarus is quite nice."
"Pale brown and cloudy. It has a clean malty aroma. The two flavors are a roasted malt and a hop bite. Both tastes are very subtle and seem to flip flop. Fat squirrel is creamy and very easy drinking. This was my first New Glarus after reading about them and wondering how I could get a few for quite a while. I would drink this beer again and can't wait to try the others. Thanks to Nick and his Father-in-Law for bringing these back from Wisconsin and sharing them."
"t the appearance I was expecting for a brown ale . Has a caramel color with a small head.I was impressed with the first sip has a creamy easy drink ability to it. Not picking up too much nut flavor here but this is a really good beer. Alc content is virtually non present . I could easily drink a couple more of these if i had more.."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A nice medium pour yielded a small head that disappeared, but there was some really nice lacing around the rim of the glass as I drank. Great brown coloring. I'm not sure if it was the way I held it or what, but it appeared to be a bit darker at the top then it was at the bottom. This had a strong cider smell to it with just a hint of sweet malt. Very good appearance and smell overall. The flavor, unfortunately, was just so-so. It had a nutty, earthy flavor to it that was just a little heavy in the mouth. There was just a bit of an alcohol bite to it that seemed to grow the more I drank. At first, I thought that the alcohol flavor may have been a bit too much to have more than just one or two at dinner, but by the time I was towards the bottom of the glass I was ready for more, so the drinkability was higher then my initial thought."
"So easy to drink. Very delicious beer that would be a nice session brew."
"D - I'm a big fan of anything New Glarus has brewed...and this one is no exception. An excellent interpretation of this brew style, and one I would recommend to anybody that enjoys a good English Brown."
"D - Light and easy to drink, would go well with a lot of different types of cuisine."
"Taste, very flavorful for a nut brown, again, taste wise, not nut brown's typical blandness. Seriously, one of the best tastes I've experienced in a nut brown ale. A degree of hop, not the low ibu or lacking bitterness you'll see. New Glarus as usual, very innovative, and not for the sake of being weird. Grows on ya, drinkable indeed."
"Drinkability: Certainly flavorful and interesting enough to keep one coming back for more."
"D: I expect more from non-session beers, and this one delivers quite handily. It's incredibly tasty. I think this is going to be one of my gold standards for the style."
"D: A pretty solid brown ale. I really don't love the style, but occasionally I get a craving for one. This satisfied my craving. If I'm in the mood again, I'd pick it up if no DFH Indian Brown was readily available."
"M/D - Medium bodied brew, smooth sitting on the tongue and going down, a very drinkable English brown. I could have more than one of these in a sitting. A really good brew to share and introduce to others not familiar with the style"
"Overall a super easy drinker. I've always had a fondness for this beer. It's served at many places around town so it's a good go to when I can't find anything I like."
"Served from a 12 ounce bottle. Pours a dark copper with a significant head that quickly subsides, leaving a thin layer of foam and a very large amount of lacing. Very pleasant aroma featuring malty/peaty notes. Really nice malty flavor, showing notes of smoke, nuts, and rye bread. Thatbreadiness really comes through on the aftertaste as well. Mouthfeel is full, round, and smooth, as is typical of New Glarus. Overall, a very drinkable brew for a crisp autumn or early winter evening."
"Drinkability: very easy beer to drink. The nuttiness provides enough enjoyment in this brown ale."
"not bad, pretty easy to drink although the carbonation kind of bites too much. pretty light overall...."
"Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The beers body is light. The light carbonation levels work well with the beer. In all honesty this is a very good throw back beer."
"Drinkability:Very drinkable brew. Could throw back many of these without feeling the least bit guilty due to the very low price and ABV presence. Typical sessionable brown ale."
"Drinkability: definitely a sessionable beer. very easy drinking. i enjoyed it."
"d: I drank one because that was all I had. Id drink more, but probalby would go for something else"
"Decent body on this. Carbonation level is moderate to low. This is much more creamy than I expected, but I like it. An easy sipper for sure. Nice roasted flavors abound. Slight nuttiness mixed with a brown sugar sweetness that is very pleasant. This is really good. Thanks again, Andy, for the trade!"
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a pale amber-brown color with a thin, cream colored head. The nose is malty sweet with lightly toasted notes; breadiness, nuttiness and caramel, maybe some toffee. The taste reflects a similar malt forward profile with the light toastiness and caramel showing through predominately, hopped only to balance no real hop presence. Mouthfeel is on the watery side but the carbonation gives it a creamy feel and it has a semi-dry finish. Overall, a very sessionable beer - not New Glarus's most impressive brew but a good drinking ale."
"Mouthfeel is creamy, a bit light and fluffy. nicely done."
"D - Average-plus. This beer is decent overall but nothing really stands out."
"D - The hops help keep an otherwise malty beer balanced and drinkable but the grassyness doesn't mesh that well in my opinion and leaves me wanting a fuller, maltier nut brown ale. Good beginning-of-fall beer for the brisk lawn mowing though!"
"12oz. Poured a tea-ish brown color with a nice pillowy off-white head that left some sticky, spotty lacing on the glass. Aroma and tastes were similar - sweet toffee, toasted grains, quite nutty, somewhat bready, with some caramel notes. Finishes sweet and crisp. Mouth-feel is rather thin, but ideal for the style. Very good representation of the style with great drinkability."
"Overall, for a brown, this is nothing impressive. Very boring, but has the typical flavors to it. Not something I'd buy on a regular basis but it is drinkable."
"D- I would drink this one everyday for a while and then take some time off ...(week or two) then dive right back into it."
"Damn good beer. Very drinkable, tasty but not overly sweet. Goes down smooth and enjoyable."
"Solid Brown Ale, with a nice roasty tang to it and the spiciness of the English hops added some decent zip. I could definitely see this being a quality Brown to enjoy in the cooler months."
"Drinkability: Pretty sweet tasting brown ale that goes down easy. I enjoyed one with some burgers I grilled up and the other while relaxing after dinner. This is a nice standby to have on hand for all kinds of beer drinkers. A decent brown ale, but a little on the sweet side for my liking."
"(D)- The perfect brew to enjoy while relaxing by a campfire out in nature. The nuttiness combined with the maple-ish malts gives it a really nice complexity and creaminess that I enjoyed alot. An excellent beer for Fall as well if you aren't in the mood for a Marzen style. A 6 pack of this would not last long at all."
"Drinkablity: Quaffable."
"Pours a clear dark copper orange, medium sized white head forms, drops quickly to a medium sized ring around the glass, nice tight sheets of lace stick, looks a bit light for a brown ale but nice. Smell is okay, real malty, caramel, nuts, raisin and dark fruit, lightly earthy, a bit of floral hopping, orange peel and citrus, a bit toasty, not too bad. Taste is similar, simple and malty, nuts and caramel, citrusy, some sugary sweetness, lots of toast and very malty, biscuits, simple but good. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with with medium carbonation. Nothing special but a solid brown ale."
"A very enjoyable beer that's easy to drink. I always have some of these in my refrigerator."
"Had this beer while in Duluth at a Tiki party for the first time. not too bad. Pours a nice auburn color with a small to medium head. dissipates fairly quickly. Smell is slightly sweet; Roasted and coffee. Taste is fine and sweet, some coffee notes come with the finish. Mouth feel is good. light to medium consistency. I would say just heavier than New Castle. Overall a very drinkable beer. As always the company is was with definitely made for a pleasurable drinking experience."
"Thin body slightly dry but refreshing. Little carbonation. High drinkability, good sessionable beer. My second beer from New Glarus Brewing."
"Not bad, but not exactly my thing"
"Wow, the taste is pretty darn good. There is some chocolate in there with the brown ale. Nice malt and and finish. The flavors change really fast in your mouth from many different tastes. The finish starts to give you a chalky dry aftertaste but then right after that it smooths out to a calming slide down your throat."
"D - this is a pretty solid nut brown ale. This is the epitome of a session brew, as many other reviews have already pointed out. Another solid offering from New Glarus."
"Great sweet nutty,caramel, hint of toffee flavor. Super smooth mouthfeel. Has a nice creamy feel going down. This is a very drinkible brew. I wish these were available here in Mass."
"A solid brew. Would taste great with a pork chop dinner. A good brew to enjoy on an crisp autumn night. Solid every day offering to keep on hand."
"Drinkability is good."
"Pours a hazy, amber/orange color. One and one-third inch head of a pale tan color. Good retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, roasted malt, brown sugar, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of an English Brown Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and slightly thick with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, very slight roasted malt, good pale hop background, some brown sugar, and slight alcohol. Great blend of flavors and a good body - I could drink a few of these puppies!"
"D. Easy to drink. Nothing fantastic, but a good solid brew. Would make a good session beer."
"D- easy to finish. one of if not the best brown ales ive ever had. ill go out of my way to bring some of this back every time im in WI"
"Nice brown color. I bit of nutty yet bread like smell. This had a bit of a sweetness to it but it was balanced out by the hops. Very carbonated, a lot more than expected and while I normally like a nicely carbonated beer, I felt it was too much for the taste. It sort of distracts from the flavor."
"Wonderfully drinkable. I wish these guys would distribute down here."
"This is a nice little session beer I could put back a few these, to bad I only had one."
"Overall: Pretty good drinkability, the yeasty flavor up front is a little too much, but when it fades the remaining flavors are pleasing. Good session beer and good to have in the fridge for those times you just want a basic beer."
"D: Refreshing and certainly tasty. New Glarus has such a wide variety of beers, and I look forward to trying more of what they have to offer."
"D- This is definitely a sessionable, everyday kind of beer."
"This is very smooth and drinkable."
"D - This is a very pleasant English brown. While the flavors don't really jump out too much, it lives up to the expectations of the style."
"Comment I really like this beer. A great edc beer. I've had it both on tap and in the bottle and both are great. It's not a smack you in the face with bold flavors beer. It is a very richly mild tasty beer."
"pours a dark copper color with a quick dissipating head that leaves a 1/8 inch copper ring..its just ok .... smell it nutty hoppy and malt i detect some sour yeast..the taste is good its drinkable its a sweet nutty hop and malt taste up front with a nice balance of both it finishes with a little sour yeast taste that i like and do not find in most browns..this brown is good and i recommend trying it..i buy singles frequently of this one and will continue to do so..try this one"
"D= Very high. Awesome brown ale actually. I was about to give up on the regular offerings from New Glarus after the last couple I've had but this was a pleasant surprise very nice beer."
"Overall, an excellent example of style but nothing particularly special."
"D: Not too bad. Decent daily drinker."
"Will drink again"
"Pours deep amber colour with one finger head which dissapeared quickly. Smell - roasty malts, some honey, raisins perhaps, some nutty flavour. Taste - nice bready flavour upfront, slightly yeasty and malty flavours to follow, a bit spicy, finishes fruity sweet with a touch of bitterness. Pretty complex and pleasant flavour. Creamy and smooth, it has some spicy kick wich gives it an additional character. It would make a decent sessional beer. I like it? it's good."
"This is a drinkable brown but watch out for the acidic carbonation that will stick with you afterwards."
"Overall a very good brown. If you love browns trade for it or if you have easy access I would buy this for sure but I dont think I will waste a trade on this one since I am not a huge brown fan..."
"D: I found this beer a bit disappointing but far from bad. It just doesn't have enough character for me. It could qualify as an amber ale, but no matter the style, it's not a terribly interesting beer."
"D: An easy drink to throw back. Shame they don't have this is Chicago bars. New Glarus makes some good beer."
" This went very well with my grilled steak and potato."
"D: This one won't burn out your tastebuds or liver, but my interest in it is slightly burnt out."
"Drinkability is great. Maybe a little sweet for too many in a row, but overall--a great beer."
"Big ups to BA kplynch for a quality bonus brew."
"all in all, a nice, clean, english brown ale. easy drinking, goes down fairly smooth, and has just enough complexity in the flavor profile to keep it from being boring. Not outstanding or unbelievably memorable, but definitely a solid drink, and definitely glad I got to sample it."
"Poured into a tulip. Pours a dark amber/ light brown with a thin off white head. Some biscuity malt ,sugars and toffee in the aroma. Tastes like a thin version of a brown ale. A bit more pleasing to me. Some bitterness after a strong dose of caramel like malts in the flavor. Thin, light mouthfeel with a bit of carbonation at the end. Good session beer."
"Thanks to Taturbo for the NG shipment!"
"Mouthfeel is nice, carbonation is good. Very drinkable. I have to say, putting a nice distinct nutty taste in a brown ale tastes so natural... Very good beer. Thanks natasharai!"
"In the end, drinkable. Especially with fish and chips with nice malt vinegar, the beer is just sweet enough. And all the other great fried foods found in bars; onion rings, shrimp, cauliflower, etc. This also makes a great companion for blue cheeses & nuts a more sophisticated pairing."
"Dark amber to light orange appearance with a one finger white head. Good retention - settles to about 1/8"" in thickness and stays put. Smells of malts (slight caramel and some nutty fruitiness). I don't detect any hop aromas. Nothing earth shattering here but clean. Tastes as it smells - quite malty with just a minor hint of hops for balance. Low carbonation and a medium mouthfeel make for a easy to drink brew. This stuff just glides down the throat - very sessionable. If given the choice between this and Spotted Cow at a bar or restaurant, I would choose this any day."
"Drinkability - New Glarus makes some very good beers. Unfortunately their flagship, Spotted Cow, is only middling. This beer is probably the second most widespread of the New Glarus line and is much more deserving of notice. A great beer from a great beer crafter."
"Deep clear amber color with a nice fluffy beige head. Good lacing and retention, but this beer is a little light in color. Aroma is toasted grains and hazelnuts with some darker bready notes. Flavor is basically identical. Sweet but not too rich. Light, airy mouthfeel and a lot of flavor make this beer extremely drinkable."
"D: Pretty drinkable I must say. Would probably be even better on a hot summer evening than a cold February night."
"12oz. bottle. Pours brownish amber in color with an off-white head. Ovaltine chocolate malt, hookah rose, nutty caramel, slightly poppycock-ish in a way on the nose. The palate is solf and a little oily. The flavor reveals more hops than I picked up on the nose, which are herbaecious, and the malt is mild with the chocolate translating well."
"Overall: Pretty smooth, could use a bit more carbonation though. Pretty drinkable, not too heavy, not too light."
"A very good brown ale, I would drink it again."
"This is a solid Brown ale, I like the berry like fruitiness, and I like that it is well balanced by the toasty malt character. This drinks quite easily and I could easily spend an afternoon with a couple of these beers. This was exactly what I was looking for right now."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite style, but what a pleasant beer. Easily one of the best browns I've ever had, this one has it all - balance, flavor, great lacing, soft, pillowy feel, low and well-hidden alcohol. Recommended."
"Drinkability is super high for this one. I have not liked Brown Ales in the past at all, including this one. But my tastes have grown, as this is a fantastic beer. Balanced, and full of rich flavor. This is as good as anything New Glarus brews. One of my new favorites, and a nice surprise to find out I love it. Cheers!"
"Not bad. Not sensational, but not bad."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: Overall, I would seek out this beer again. Although the flavors are not overpowering they are enough to keep the beer from being boring. I like how it balances a nice level of flavor and complexity with a light body. I could see myself sitting back in the fall with a this beer, grilling up some burgers and enjoying the slight chill in the air."
"D- This was a very nice nut Brown and one of my favorites of the style. Would love to try this again. Flavor has great strength and I find this very drinkable. Looking forward to trying other NG beers in the future!"
"D - The smoothness of this beer makes it very easy to drink. The nuttiness in the beer is not overwhelming and the malts are a good compliment to the beer."
"Drinkability? This is *very* easy to drink! I find myself taking sips far too often. Oh and the head retention is excellent and there's quite a bit of sticky lacing. All around, a very nice brew!"
"D: Not my favorite style, but I really dig this one. It is cold as hell here during my visit to Wisconsin and this one really warmed me up and brought a smile to my face."
"M/D - Very mild, easily drinkable beer. Nothing is too overpowering and it is balanced well. I could take a case of this and be very happy."
"Exceptionally drinkable. Good for sessioning. Perfect for an English Brown."
"This light to medium bodied beer has very smooth finish, with moderate carbonation. It feels nice and smooth going down and quite drinkable. Definitely one of the better Brown Ales I've had, albeit probably thinner than many other brown ales I've had, but certainly not lacking in flavor. I pick these up a lot, especially since I can find it in most of the bars around here. One of my ""go to"" New Glarus beers, I'll slam a Fat Squirrel any day."
"I recommend this brown ale because of it's borwnaleiness. It is a simple and relaxed brown ale that has subtle sweetness, nuttiness, hoppiness and a unique earthiness. Pours deep copper with an inch high head that stays for days. When customers ask about this beer I tell them that it is an american version of the newcastle, but earthier. Try one, you'll see."
"Drinkability is good. Definitely a tasty brown ale. Recommended."
"Again, everything I have from NG is just great!"
"Drinks easy, not a bad brown, could session on this easily"
"D: Very drinkable and a nice representative of style. Many English browns have bitter notes and this one--which sets it apart--definitely does not. Also more complex than the typical English brown. Honestly even though New Glarus is a quality brewery, I was still pleasantly surprised by this one. Thanks to my wife for bringing this one back from Madison for me!"
"Mouthfeel is smooth and light enough to encourage good drinkability."
"Overall a very easy drinking beer."
"This beer smells nutty and malty, caramel-toffee notes. The mouthfeel is very nice here--very creamy and soft. In keeping with the style, which is achieved very well here, very little bitterness, just nutty creamy caramelized malt. Not sweet, though. A bit boring, but a good session beer, well made, like everything else from these guys."
"M + D: Medium body, a little bit of weightiness. Decent brew all around, and a nice brown even if it is a little pale."
"Not the best English brown ale I've had, but it's fairly solid. Love the label as well, plenty of fat squirrels in Maine, I guess the same is in Wisconsin."
"Conclusion: A good English-style brown ale, no doubt about it. While there's nothing extraordinary about it, the hazelnut and chocolate aromas and nutty flavors are nice, while the malt/hop balance is near perfect for the style in my opinion."
"Pours a slightly cloudy light brown color with a 1/2 finger tan head that dissipates quickly with light lacing. Sweet malt and hazelnut aromas. Strong caramel flavors up front blend nicely with hazelnut with a dry lemon hop finish. Medium body, medium carbonation, this has a nice mouth coating and cleansing feel. After finishing one, you want another."
"5.8% ABV, I don't know how to add this to the beer page itself"
"taste is a bit boring too. caramel flavors, not crazy sweet but an astringent sweetness builds up on the sides as you try to finish off the bottle. something a little annoying about this beer. it can't be that every time i had one of the five that i was simply just not in the mood ... the body is medium but there's something a bit syrupy. just isn't refreshing and not interesting enough to be satisfying."
"D - Nice quaffable nut brown from New Glarus. I love the name of this brew... perfect for a nut brown ale!"
"D: The beer does have a good taste, but wasn't really happy with it by the end of the glass. Probably don't envision having more then 2 at a time."
"This is a very good English Brown Ale in my opinion. Good full flavors but not too overpowering for the average beer drinker."
"One of the most impressive, likable brown ales I've had. As with New Glarus' many other above-average offerings, it's all about attention to detail, use of quality ingredients, and loyalty to style while also putting the brewer's unique stamp on the final product."
"Per style, NG knocked this one out of the park. Peppery, earthen hops immediately envigorate the palate, while English toffee sweetness and a hint of buttery alcohol provides an excellent balance. The medium body provides a near-perfect carbonation level and a beautiful, spicy hop finish. Can't wait to try this beer again."
"D - Very drinkable. Session beer."
"this is beer is one of my wife's favorite beers. the nice hop aroma is appealing the color is a nice caramel brown. the taste has a oat flavor with a nice hop finish. I request this beer anyone who wants a change from the same old brown ales that still has a bite to it."
"Overall- Smooth, mild, and flavorful. A good session beer! (Thanks Mike!)"
"With such a weak aroma I thought this was gonna be weak, but that quickly changed after I took a sip. Very drinkable, would make a good session beer. If only I could get New Glarus stuff around here."
"Not much carbonation and a medium bodied beer. Very drinkable which is evident as I enjoyed a 2nd Fat Squirrel despite the variety that was available to me."
"My friend Mara went to Madison to visit a friend and fulfilled my one request: bring me back something from New Glarus. Furthermore, she knows I go in for the dark, malty beers and knew this nutty brown would be right up my alley. I don't think they actually used hazelnuts, but they sure nailed what they were going for. This rich, velvety ale goes down like carbonated Nutella. Pairing recommendation? Just that: Nutella on toast, to match the toasty malts. If you're looking for a breakfast pairing, maybe a bowl of Peanut Butter Cap'n Crunch. All I know is, I want to spend some time in Wisc. so I can try more of their beers (in addition to the Bock and Spotted Cow Mara snuck past TSA."
"D - Easy drinking - a good mix of body and flavor. It doesn't sit too heavily on my profile."
"D= very drinkable although I don't think I could handle more than maybe 2 at a sitting."
"Orangey copper with a nice beige lid. Fat Squirrel is a roastey, toastey, hazelnutty brew. Light caramel/chocolate sweetness balanced by the light bitterness of toasted grains, roasted nuts, and earthy hops. Light medium bodied with a light fresh crispness enhanced by lightly sharp and tingly carbonation. Nice brown with good balance and drinkability."
"Pours a deep golden brown with a small off-white head that dissipates to a swirl along the top fairly quickly leaving pretty good lacing. Smell is sweet burnt/roasted caramel malts with a slight nut aroma as well. The taste is a much sweeter, more complex version of the nose. There is a huge sweet malt slug up front that flows right into a roasted nut flavor with some maple syrup sweetness in there as well. I also got a hint of fruits, maybe raisins, right before the finish. The mouthfeel is fairly light and extremely crisp despite the sweetness. This is a very good nut brown and the taste is extremely well balanced yet unique. I really like this one and could drink it all night."
"Do yourself a favor and find this bier, good stuff."
"Bitterness is apparent but hop flavor & aroma is limited or masked by the heavy roasted malt flavors, which is pretty true to style. It has a dry finish which helps driknability, but kind leaves me unsatisfied. Overall a good interpretation of an English Brown."
"D - Nice smooth brown ale. A little roasty for my taste, but still quite drinkable."
"The taste is interesting. It has all of those elements from the nose and all those you'd expect in a brown ale, but it's offset by a surprisingly creamy mouthfeel. I usually don't expect a ton out of brown ales, but this one offers a very interesting take on the style. Nicely done."
"D- Nice brown, but not the best out there. Worth a shot if you haven't had it."
"Pours a clear amber color with a short lived beige head. Smell is nutty and lightly coffee like along with a touch of cream. Really nice and smooth and inviting. Taste is very smooth as well with a balanced nuttiness as the nose indicates. Light carbonation and a full mouthfeel. Very clean, nutty flavor that is superbly balanced and lightly bittered with a touch of sweetness without being overly so. Fantastic brown ale."
"This is a great standby beer as it's available nearly everywhere in Wisconsin. It seems to hold up well with even non beer drinkers."
"Thanks Kraft! Pours a clear light brown with a small white head. Laces nicely. Dry roasted nuts and sugary maple aroma. Flavor is subtle and very tasty. Tastes of caramel, nuts, chocolate... mmmm Snickers. There was also a bit of beef like meatiness from the malt that reminded me of beef with barley soup. That may sound weird but it works for this beer. (The beef flavor was also prominent in a wee heavy called Orkney Skullsplitter which I loved.) Not unpleasant at all. Light mouthfeel with big carbonation. Finishes sweet and lingers for a bit."
"D--Quite drinkable, although it is not my favorite of the style."
"Drinkability: Easy and light drinking - a good crowd pleaser. Nothing spectacular, but certainly worth a try."
"Note: I need to trade with someone in Wisconsin."
"Mellow mellow mellow. Flavors are there but just under what you'd want out of an English Brown. If you want an easy drinker, this is a decent pick. If you're looking for something that's worthy of appreciative drinking session I'd look for something with a bit more character."
"This is a very nicely done beer. Well balanced and interesting."
"Sweet up front and dry on the finish. Very slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. Very nice English style brown ale. Another great New Glarus beer."
"D- this is one of my more favorite brown ales as a good session beer"
"Its an interesting take on Brown ale. Some interesting flavors going on, but the finish is a little off. Overall not too shabby, I'll have another."
"Sorry I forgot who you are, so thanks to the Unknown BA"
"drinkability is good. this brew is not rich or heavy, but does showcase a solid profile of flavors that work well together. cheers!"
"Low-medium carbonation, pleasing mouthfeel. Not overly complex or sweet, quite a drinkable beer."
"This is very easy to drink i dont know what the abv is, but if i were guessing i would say it cant be over 5%. I could easily session this one all night and be completely happy. might have to put this one back on my wants list :)"
"Fat Squirrel seems to be more of a traditional brown ale, which unfortunately isn't one of my favorites. The nut flavors that this brings to the table saves it from being totally unmemorable. Not a bad beer, decent for a brown ale."
"Drinkability: A flavorful, enjoyable, session-minded brown ale."
"It's okay but I wouldn't go out of my way to try it."
"Great flavor, good aroma. If they could make the head hold up a bit better (some torrified wheat, maybe?) It would be an 'A' beer."
"Drinkability: Good drinkability here. Light and refreshing. A good, easy drinking beer to grab anytime."
"D - One of the best sessionable nut brown ales I've ever had. This would be in my house at all times if it were available to me."
"Definitly in my top 5 five for the style."
"Very creamy medium body. Nicely carbonated and silky smooth. Nut browns are one of my favorite styles and this one is nothing special but it's definitely a very solid example. Good session beer and I could easily see myself drinking a lot more of these."
"Body is medium with just the right amount of carbonation. If brown ales are your thing, this screams session ale."
"I got this as an extra from GrizzlyAdams, thanks man! For a nut-brown ale this sure looks a heck of a lot like an amber ale, the head is like white cream though. Smell is sorta nutty and then the taste really backs that up with some serious nutty, hazelnut flavors which almost overwhelm the palate. This was a pretty good beer just because it is so different than any other nut-brown ale I have ever had."
"this was a clear deep amber with chestnut hues and a creamy tan head/lacing. quite nice to look at. nose was of cola (really), quite nutty and caramelly. nice complex malt backbone with a semi-drying finish. hops are in the background here. spritzy and light to medium in body. this would be a nice session beer."
"Body was fairly thin, and the finish a bit on the stale side, or I would have rated higher."
"Pours a copper/ yellow-ish color with a small white head. In the aroma, a sweet nuttiness and a dry end. In the taste, just like aroma, a sweet nuttiness to a nice dry end. A nice smoooth mouthfeel and a dry nutty aftertaste. Nice brown ale, sweet and dry, balanced and easy to drink."
"The drinkability is very nice... makes a solid session beer."
"Mouthfeel is chewy but a little short for what I like in a brown, not too creamy, and a little thin but the drinkability of this beer is very good, I could sit and enjoy a few of these with no problem."
"D: Maybe I'm being generous but I really enjoy this beer, quite a hoppy take on a brown ale but it is still balanced enough in the malt department to distinguish itself as such."
"Not too bad. It was quite robust for an English Brown Ale but delicious anyway. Dunno what that alcohol quality was to it. Whatever. It's still tasty despite not falling in line with it's English counterparts."
"D: Not a bad brew at all. Would make an excellent session beer."
"Overall: a nice little brown ale. Quality ingredients and well brewed, pretty much to style. Not going to knock your socks off, but I really liked how it made me think of caramel apples white drinking it, quite sessionable."
"Definitely one of the more potent New Glarus brews, and certainly one of my favorites. Cheers to anyone in the Wisconsin area...because I can't even order their beer back home in Ohio."
"M&D - thinner than expected, but not in a bad way, it is an easy drinker and a fully enjoyable beer, as to be expected with a beer from New Glarus, well done"
"thanks to thefatkid13 for delivering the goods"
"Sampled this a few months ago and just found the notes scribbled out on an old post-it behind the computer monitor. I remember enjoying this one a lot though. Pours a light brown with white head that quickly dissipated. Smells of nuts and toasty malt. Aroma of hops is barely discernible through the malt. Tasted nutty, then sweet malt then a crisp/dry finish. Malt is complex (must be several in there contributing to the flavor), slightly sweet that fades into toasty and even smoky finish. Nicely carbonated and light enough to enjoy several in one evening. Great example of a nut brown ale. Easy to drink and great flavors. I would keep this one on hand if it were more widely available. Thanks to Bill for bringing me a bottle."
"Thanks to Wasatch for including this in our trade."
" Served in a frosted pint glass. Sigh. Let it warm up for a while. Translucent brown with slight orange tint, and a thin bright white head that quickly fled. Nose was malty, slight hops, and slightly sweet malts. Nose was weak, some malts but not much else. Maybe I needed to let it warm up even more. Mouthfeel was pretty decent, and drinkability was good. A sessionable beer."
"This beer had a small frothy head and light lacing. The color was a opaque orange with grey overtones. The nose had a yummy hazelnut and bannana aroma. Sweet caramel mixed with with a dusty walnuts that fade into a spicy clove, smoky sweet prune finish."
"Small cream head tops a clear copper/brown body. Thick syrupy malt on the nose, hints of nuts. The malt dominates the taste, it almost goes into the porter malt taste range, nut backround. Medium bodied, fairly creamy feel. Not a major brown-head but this one isnt too bad."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not very filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice beer to stick with for an evening if you’re in the mood for a good brown ale. I could definitely drink a few of them and it’s definitely one of the better beers that I’ve had in the style."
"New Glarus is the current Wisconsin ""boutique"" brewery. Everything they do is considered way above average to great. In my opinion ratings for this beer are an example of herd mentality. It's just not that great."
"Highly drinkable in my opinion. Nice and malty with enough hops to compliment the toasted bread. A fine balance descries this beer, and I very much appreciate it."
"A very easy drinker, and one that's definitely good for cool fall days."
"Pours deep copper with a creamy beige head with very nice lacing. Smell is moderate with a bit of a tinny note and light hopping. Rich nutty malt. This beer has a good balance and reminds me of a classic Oktoberfest style with a touch more hops and pronounced nuttiness. Very nice ale and quite drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery for a brown ale. Slight drying in the aftertaste. With all that being said, it was gone before I wanted it to be. Very easy drinking and could be a definite session beer."
"Pours reddish brown with a one fingered head that dissipates quickly with no lacing. Typical for New Glarus beers. A very nutty aroma is the first thing that I smell with a little malt to follow. The taste is nutty with a little toffee and roasted malt to finish. Finishes dry and leaves a roasted nut aftertaste. The beer seems a little thin for a Brown Ale. I expected something full bodied and creamy in texture. This is my least favorite of the New Glarus brews."
"The drinkability is also good. Not a bad choice. Prosit. MK"
"I liked this one. Smells malty, but the overall taste doesn't strike me as a typical brown ale. Like a brown ale on the front end, with a roasted malty flavor, but then towards the end delivers a hoppy flavor more like a pale ale. Nice mouthfeel, nice flavors."
"12 ouncer, no freshness or bottleing info to be had. Pours dark amber, almost clear, lifting a medium tan head. Roasty, toasty, malty nose. Smooth drinking, nutty notes in full evidence. Pleasant enough, malty ale. Brit style brown, hops quite reserved. Nothing special, just a respectable, drinkable, enjoyable and flavorful session type beverage, and thats quite a bit. Brown ale, mild ale lovers and Brit. style ale lovers will enjoy this one."
"D - A nice brown session ale with a great deal of complexity. This has enough interesting flavors to keep me interested for more than one or two pints, and it's thirst quenching enough to drink with food. I would like to take this on a camping trip...it's very woodsy and nutty."
"Nice copper brown color. When poured into a pint glass this beer has a decent 1 inch creamy head, but that doesn't last long not leaving much lacing. The smell reminds me of roasting nuts with slight hints of spice. This is a malty beer with a nice mouth feel and a strong after taste that fades quickly. Not the typical brown ale, but despite the 85+ degree weather outside reminds me of relaxing by the fire on a cool fall night."
"overall this is a good brew that i enjoyed"
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden brown color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy off-white head, which lasts a long time, some nice sticky lacing which lasts the whole drink. The nose is malty, slightly bitter, and some caramel. The taste is malty, bitter, slightly dry on the finish, smooth, nice dose of caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, this is an very tasty brew, recommended."
"Very drinkable, approachable, and sessionable ale. Perfect for Spring, Fall, or a cooler Summer night. A great beer for someone looking to branch out from drinking piss yellow lagers (some of which may actually be a damn fine beer) and move on to trying something slightly darker. Ive come back to this brew a few times and always been impressed, and will continue to come back to this one."
"of my forebears) Slovenia. A tasty nut-brown ale."
"This beer pours well: a nice chestnut color with a creamy head that largely diminishes. It has a powerful maltiness and caramel to its aroma and these tastes predominate as well, combined with some subtle roasted nuttiness. It was a bit on the sweet side, leaving a slight stickiness on the tongue although it is relatively smooth and creamy."
"D: Good."
"Thanks to John (Wasatch) for sending this one also."
"Pours a clear dull copper hue with a light khaki colored two finger that dies down to a nice lacing a bit after pour. Color of this brew doesn't seem to follow the brown ale style, a bit light. Stickiness is pretty good, holds on to the glass here and there. Smell is a sweet toffee like malt mixed in with spices. Quite dull, not much other than malt in the nose. Starts off with a smooth chocolate like malt then a woody like flavor follows. Towards the end a bitter nut like flavor emerges that seems to come from the hops. Light to medium smooth body with little carbonation. Enjoyable beer. Nothing extraordinary, but I could session a few of these."
"It's light brown with good lacing. Smells of smooth, roasted, chocolate grains. The taste is mellow, but somewhat complex. It starts with a creamy black licorice (kinda) grain but then gives way to more caramel and cocoa flavors. The mouthfeel is right on with a smooth finish complimented by a crisp touch. This is a great session brew. I stack it right next to my other favorite English brown, the underrated Ithaca Nut Brown."
"D: Very drinkable, the beer thankfully lacks an overly nutty body that overtakes the rest of the beer."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with a medium body. Easy drinker."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer. It is my first from New Glarus. One of the better Brown Ales around."
"Thanks to umustdrink in a nice trade, I could enjoy this fine frosty."
"A nice brew, nothing to knock your socks off but something that could be drank from time to time."
"drinkability is good. balanced and enjoyable. a nice english brown."
"Another good quality session brew from New Glarus. Every brew I try of theirs hits the spot and this is no exception."
"D - A very full bodied, full flavor beer. Great things all around."
"While nothing much to look at or smell, it was certainly very tasty, was very easy to drink, and very enjoyable overall. Could pair well with any non-seasoned pub fare, and might make a great session beer if I knew what the ABV was! Would definitely recommend it and enjoy every opportunity I got to have it again."
"D- This beer has a some interesting malt complexity but the bright cider notes seemed to get annoying toward the end of the glass and covered some of the malt flavors."
"A very, very mild English brown. Possibly a good intoduction to the style."
"Yes, sir! That's one fine nut brown ale!!! Poured with a nice foamy head although not all that big. Very little lace. Nice Brown color. Very prominant nutty, malty, toffee nose. Excellent nut brown ale flavor; better than almost any that I've had anywhere. Velvety texture with fine carbonation. Nice balanced finish. Perhaps a touch too rich, but I'm nit picking."
"Drinkability - a super session beer, with or without food. Thanks to jj21 for this one!"
"Poured from a 12oz. brown bottle into my Sly Fox shaker glass. Appears a medium brown color with about a finger of light tan head. Minimal lacing left on the glass with each sip. Smells of roasted nuts such as hazelnuts, and walnuts as well as sweet caramel malt. Tastes of toasted caramel malts, mildly bitter cocoa powder and hazelnuts. Medium in both body and carbonation with a satisfying richness. Drinkability is excellent. This beer will make you forget Newcastle ever existed. Recommended."
"The body seems thick from all of the caramel malt, but at the same time it seems like it has fermented out very dry, and all the remaining body comes from dextrins. The carbonation is very crisp. Very easy to drink. I only wish New Glarus would expand into Iowa so I could drink it more often. Thanks for the bottle, Joe (or DJ, I suppose)."
"Nice & sessionable. Browns are not my favorite style, but this was quite good."
"Overall a decent brown ale"
"Could easily consume more than one of these in an afternoon or evening. Probably would even make a good breakfast beer."
"I was expecting nuttiness but I got sourness. I will try to get a fresher example in the future to see if my impression changes."
"Not bad at all, but I've had better."
"Notes: Paired with a good thick hamburger or barbecue makes this brew superb."
"A brown ale that is assertive but not syrupy. Earthy but not dirty. As inviting as the state of Wisconsin. One of the better and more elusive brown ales around. Enjoy it with a lover or two."
"Mouthfeel is full-bodied, but not very sticky. I found this beer quite drinkable. Unlike New Glarus's Yokel and Spotted Cow, I'd recommend this beer."
"Pours a medium mahagony amber with light bubbling and no lacing to speak of. Good head with straight up retention. The aroms is a lovely nutty malt with some intermingling hops throughout. The taste is a nice nutty malt as well. Caramel nuts and a mix of hops dance all aound an easy drinking beer. A little yeasty for my liking. This is a beer that I wish was readily available in IL. Great session beer."
"Bottle (Courtesy of Monger): Poured a dark brown color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention. Aroma of nutty malt with caramel is quite enticing. Taste of nutty malt is excellent with some sweet fruit and a creamy texture. Low carbonation with a slightly above average body. I have to admit that I had a lot of worse brown ale and I did enjoy this one."
"Cheers2beers"
"Rusty amber brown; clear. Finger of gauzey, off-white head dies down early. Caramel, light brown sugar, toasted nuts, and very light herbal hops. Toasted malts up front impart mild bitterness. Caramel, fruit, and faintly sweet brown sugar take over. Toasty, herbal bitterness rounds out the palate. Medium-body with a slightly syrupy feel. Nicely balanced brown ale; very drinkable."
"Drinkability: An extremely drinkable beer, great representation of the style."
"I would term this a 'very' brown ale. I am not usually much of an ale drinker (I prefer my brew a bit darker), but this beer more than satisfies. It pours a deep, but clear amber with a decent head. The smell of this beer is nothing to remark on in terms of quantity, but in quality, has a fairly pleasant, nutty aroma. This smell nicely compliments its flavor, which is pleasantly malty (especially for an ale) and has a wonderful nutty--almost hazelnut--overtone to it. I find this beer to be remarkably drinkable and one of New Glarus's better brews."
"This is an OK brown ale but I really see no reason to try this again."
" This is a very good example of an English Brown Ale. Well done New Glarus! Score another one for Wisconsin!"
"Semi hazy light mohagany color with a medium off white head and a bit of lacing. Smells a bit like hazelnut coffee, toasty, some hoppy notes that toast and dry it out. Taste is stronger on coffee than expected but the nuttyness really dominates. Sweeter with some milk chocolate but more of a toffee flavor. Roasted nuttiness is still prevalent. Dry caramel elements at the top. Good body but still could use a touch more fullness. Finish is a bit earthy and hoppy and ends clean. Another nice offering from New Glarus."
"It manages to combine the best aspects of sessionability with complexity. Great beer."
"A nice brown. Tasty, though not that remarkable."
"Ever so slightly hazy bronzed chestnut with a pillowy cream colored head. Soft scents of sweet biscuits and cocoa. Fuzzy floral and spicy hop aromas mix with rather faint hazelnut notes. Some fruity esters emerge as well. Nut-candy sweet flavors with subtly tart melon and berry characteristics. Some floral hops provide a slight spiciness before the decidedly earthy finish. Very soft and slippery mouthfeel; just a tad heavy on the palate, but overall very smooth. A pretty great stab at the style, from my perspective."
"Medium body with strong toasted notes, I wish I new the malt bill. Malt lingers . . . med-low hop flavor and bitterness pushed beer to English brown ale. Well made beer."
"The pour is a dark amber with almost a red tint to it. The head pours thick and cream colored then settles to a good lace. Aroma is nice as well with a mellow malt and nutty notes. Flavors are an excellent blend of malt giving a distinct character to the brew. The finish gives the perfect bite of Bavarian hops. Mouthfeel is very clean lending well to the excellent drinkabilty. Overall, this brew is an excellent example of a nut brown ale and another great brew from New Glarus, which I might add, is quickly becoming a staple in my brew fridge."
"D- It's a nice easy beer to drink. Nothing special but is a good decent beer. Wouldn't mind a few more of these on a relaxed day."
"This isn't what I'd expect from a Nut Brown Ale. With a big fat squirrel on the label, I was looking forward to an homage to the nut. Instead, the squirrel stole all the nuts. This reminds me of too many characteristics of an IPA, blended with -some- aspects of a brown ale. It's a weird middle where they met, and as a fan of deep brown ales, I lost out."
"This beer pours a clear brownish-red color. The head is two-fingers in height and recedes slowly into decent lacing. The aroma is of caramel and chocolate. The taste is identical to the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lot of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent beer, but it lacks any sort of complexity. I would drink it again, but I wouldn't search it out."
"A lighter colored brown ale, that pours with a lot of carbonation and a big head, giving off some wonderful nutty and toasted malt aromas. There's a great nutty maltiness in this beer along with slightly roasted coffee notes., amid some tasty caramel malt sweetness and perhaps a hint of toffee candy. The hop bitterness seems somewhat restrained with some bitterness contributed by the roasted malts. This combination of flavors add complexity and make this beer tasty and very enjoyable. A future world classic nut brown ale."
"Very nice brown ale here. Another solid brew from New Glarus...wish I had more frequent access to this brewery."
"A petty decent brown ale. Certainly worth a try. I feel this more of an 'Americanized' version of a brown ale. However, this is still a good brew."
"Overall not to bad, I would drink this one again."
"This ones tasty for sure. Im glad I got a sixer. Thanks to BA Doolar for hauling this one all the way from WI."
"Originally reviewed April 9, 2005. On tap at the Gitchee Gumee Brewfest 2005. The aroma was bland and of plain malt. But, wow, the flavors really bowl you over. Theyre simple and fairly one-dimensional, but you get a good mix of nuts, mostly domianted by roasted hazlenut (a personal favorite), so this beer spoke to me. Has a few other weakness, but pretty exceptional for a typical brown."
"There is very, very little aroma to this beer at all. Perhaps a faint hint of grains, but that's it. The appearance is different that I expected, I wanted something that was more towards the brown and less amber. Perhaps it was my light. The taste is very surprising. Roasted, nutty, big and flavorful. A nice full mouthfeel. I think this would be good on occasion as a treat, but I'm not sure I'd want more than two at a time. I will seek this out when I'm back in Wisconsin."
"Appearance is a transparent brown with some ivory foam. The aroma is mildly sweet. Initial taste contains hints of nutty brown ale with caramel, some hops, rich malt, with a softly carbonated middle. Finish has a nice profile: malt, hops and a nutlike aftertaste."
"Thanks to my buddy Mike for leaving a six pack at my cabin!"
"Dits good, but differentId have another and will enjoy the rest of this six pack."
"Bought a single bottle of this as part of a make your own six pack while in Wisconsin. It was my first from New Glarus and thought i'd pick it up for the funny label (also bought a shirt later at the brewery). Smells like weak malts with roasted notes. Sweet roasted taste that's very satisfying. I do get a bit of haxlenut like it says on the label that i should, but not a whole lot. Sweet roastiness reminds me a lot of a new local porter we have in south bend - Blacksnake. Overall Fat Squirrel was quite a good offering....and we tried several more during the course of our trip."
"D: I like this beer. Browns usually bore me but this one is more complex and welcoming than most common browns."
"Lovely auburn-caramel in color with an impressive tan-colored head. Thick. Long-lasting. Some nice lacing of the glass. Surprising amounts of ""roasty toasty"" in the nose. Toasted assortment of nuts here. Some caramel sweetness floats around as well. Flavor has a firm backbone of sweetness that nicely balances the nut flavors. Dark sugary caramel with some toasted, almost ""charred oak"" notes. Slight zing of hop influence at the end. Nice body. Good carbonation. One I'd certainly visit again."
"Pours a deep golden copper with a pretty good head, shrinks a little quick to thin layer, with minimal lacing down the glass, more at the top than bottom. Aroma nutty malt and slightly earthy character, and a slight caramel malt profile, overall a bit weak. Taste has an overriding nuttiness to it, caramel malts too, with a smooth, almost syrup-like mouth. Finishes with a light hop blending with sweet malt still. Interesting, I don't normally note hops in brown ales, yet it seems quite nice here. Something I""ll have to look for more. Overall, quite a nice selection, very easy to drink. Probably one of my more favorite browns in a while."
"A refreshing beer with a nice balance. Not the tastiest brew I've had, but it's tasty enough."
"I don't know what to make of New Glarus. Their fruit beers are easily the best I've ever had, but their more mainstream offerings seem satisfactory at best."
"Pours a light brown/deep amber color, minimal head retention or lacing. Aroma is carmelly and nutty, nice. Very enjoyable. Flavor is malty up front, some chocolate, and again, the hint of carmel. Minerally water taste, but just a slight bit of that. Mouthfeel is okay, this is a sessionable beer, afterall. It's a good, very drinkable beer."
"Last swigs: Clean quaffable brown with a refreshing finish. Just lacked an angle. Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the bottle."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable beer. Sort of like a nut brown light and thats makes it an easy drinking beer that won't fill you up."
"No hint of alcohol so I imagine around 5.5% or so, but really no idea...either way, very enjoyable and the type of beer you wish would be sitting next to Sam Adams and Harpoon in your local bar...I'd go for it quite often."
"Drinkability & Notes  Easy drinking, I haven't had a good brown ale in quite awhile. A solid Brown that would be a good gateway for a Newcastle drinker."
"Pours nicely and with practise you can give it a full finger width of head. This beer smells very fresh, like a barley field in summer with a hint of coffee flavor. It feels full and a little fizzy in my mouth and leaves a fresh grain aftertaste with a little coffee flavor just like it smells and ends with a hint of hops."
"Beer pours a hazelnut brown with a beige head and decent lacing. Smell is of sweet malt and slightly nutty. Taste is predominantly of nuts, with a bit of chocolate in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, almost a creamy feel to it. Drinkability, great for enjoying just one with an evening meal, or many with friends for a night out."
"drinkability: quite drinkable"
"The taste is clean with a malty chocalate and nut finish. The aftertaste is pretty thin though. Decent mouthfeel, but on the thin side of medium and the drinkability is good. This is a solid beer and would drink it again given the opportunity."
"Drinkability --I could have maybe more than one. TAfter one beer, the sweet is not cloying, and the nuttiness demands another sampling. After two beers, I think I would tire of the sweetness a bit. Maybe this isn't an everyday beer, but it is enjoyable"
"Too damn drinkable for our own good."
"Bottle from Vinnys bar at La Crosse airport. Dark brown color with a medium thin beige head. Thin sheets of lacing. Aroma of malt and walnuts. Medium body with a roasty character, lots of nutty and malty flavoring. The finish is clean and sweet with more malt and nut flavors. I like it!"
"Mouthfeel is creamy sweet and sour with an odd sour note that seems to linger at the end."
"Fours all around for this one. I picked it up while I was at my cabin in wisconsin. Oddly enough this redneck gas station in birchwood had it. Pours a nice brown sweet sweet head and smells like roasted nuts. It tastes on sweet sweet malts with roasted nuts and mild hop character. So far this is one of favorites from New Glarus and will definatly be picking this one up on my next trip to the lake."
"Mouthfeel is full, moreso than most of the style, which tend to be on the thin side. Drinakbility is pretty darned good. I like this one!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1 1/2"" of beige head over the dark copper brew. Head lasts well, with excellent lacing. Aroma is nutty medium malts. Taste is caramel malt sweetness, with nuttiness coming in, and a crisp lightly hoppy close. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is nice, this revisit verifies that this one's still good..."
"Bottle provided by Orbitalr0x, thanks for the opportunity! Pours a half finger light tan head over a nearly clear brown rust liquid. Smells chocolate nut toffee. Underneath, with searching, I get pancakes and syrup and a very slight hint of alcohol. Tastes toffee to start, then gentle chocolate and sour, then a stronger and revised chocolate (sweeter...is there a caramel undertone here?), ending with a nutty and chocolate finish. Some tannins may appear in the end, tough to say as the carbonation rises a bit. The aftertaste is rich chocolate and gentle acrid carbonation sting on my tongue. While this beer is not complex, it sure is tasty. As I progress down the beer, what I thought was tannin is seeming as almost a roasted grain. Not quite coffee-like, but it's bot a bit of the burny quality about it. Mouthfeel is medium and the beer doesn't hang around long in the mouth. Moderate carbonation, perhaps a bit more than I'd like."
"Opinion: This really isn't too bad of a beer. I like the flavor, but I think that it is a bit on the assertive side for this style as I mentioned. It tastes a bit more like a London Porter than a Northern English Brown Ale."
"Flavor is suprisingly robust for the color. The dark malts show up much better on the tongue than they do to the eye. Some astringency, but not enough to detract significantly."
"Pours a beautiful fiery dark amber color. Head was mearly a coating of foamy white, a little disappointing, but the color is still gorgeous. Smells of sweet malt, with some diacetyl sour butteriness and a hint of nuttiness. Not outstanding, but nice. Taste is much of the same, sweet, grainy malts, some hop bitterness to balance, with diacetyl and nutty notes to round it off. Mouthfeel is smooth, with fairly high carbonation that makes it refreshing. Drinkability is phenomenal, definitely a session beer I could drink all night. A solid nut brown, and probably my favorite beer from New Glarus, sorry to all you Spotted Cow fans out there."
"A clean beer that is easy to enjoy. Not a lot going on with this one, but what is going on is good."
"Mouthfeel is fairly average...pretty thin, but well carbonated. Drinkability is solid, a very smooth drinking beer."
"Drinkability: Very good for a brown. I would happily drink this beer into my own oblivion. The sharp, bitter aftertaste, my least favorite character of the beer, would probably be considered a positive by many people on this site. The least interesting part of the beer was its scent (""odor"" sounds like feet). New Glarus is badass."
"This beer pours out a thin light brown. The aroma is malty and slightly chocolatey, but a little thin. My hopes were not high as I took the first sip. I was suprised, because this beer is pretty good. Malt, chocolate, and nut flavors. Just a bit of hop flavor. Although the beer appears thin, the taste is not weak. Very nice drinkability. This is probably one of the tastiest brown ales I've had."
"Mouthfeel had a chewy, medium body that was creamier than most nut brown ales I've tried in the past. Easily a drinkable brew, but there's plenty of others I'd choose first...just a bit too uninspiring to make me come back for more."
"Very light color for an EBA, light brown, clear body. Head is creamy and thick, tan in color. Smell is nutty, slightly sweet, and backed bylight floral hops. Taste is sweet and nutty, creamy and somewhat chocolatey. Hops are present, but are always in the background.. Mouthfeel isn't very well carbonated, and could use some more. I like the beer, a good EBA, if not a little too normal."
"Drinkability on this is above average. It would probably be a decent session beer. I'm glad I gave it another taste."
"Unusually high carbonation for the style, but it works quite well here. Crafty balance of malts and hops make for an impressive, American version of an Anglo brown ale."
"This bottle is not bad, but different from most others I've had, which is many. The difference is the hops. They are much more pronounced than usual. I am a hop head, so this isn't a major problem. But, I drank a nut brown tonight because I was in the mood for a nut brown tonight. Oh well. So one batch is a bit different from another. Who gives a shit? This is still quite good."
" Drinakability is good not a bad little beer. Thanks to Ave for the sample."
"This beer pours a brown color with almost no head and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma is very sweet. No nutty tones here, just sweetness. The flavor has some toasted malts and caramel with a bit of hop. This is lacking what I want from a nut brown ale. I really wasn't impressed with this. Drinkability is good and the body is ok."
"This beer pours a slightly brown amber color with no head and a slight ring over the beer. The nose is not what I expect from a nut brown or english brown ale. Lots of sweetness that I can't place. The flavor is better than what the nose would say. Good roasted malt with a nice nutty and roasted coffee flavor, Nice nice nice. The feel is right at moderate, maybe a bit more. Drinkability is also very nice. Another solid beer from New Glarus."
"Fat Squirrel pours a beautiful, subtly hazy (it's bottle-conditioned), light chestnut body with a crimson cast and glowing orange highlights. The frothy ivory head receeds to a thin layer of cream; and it leaves some nice, albeit it mainly transient, lace with each sip. The nose is loaded with toasty malt and welcomes you to take a sip! It's delicately zesty on the tongue due to it's very fine-bubbled, natural carbonation. The body is medium; and it becomes a bit creamier as it warms. Toasty and slightly nutty malt carries through the flavor from start to finish with some delicate, floral and mildly spicy hops appearing towards the finish. It's solid bitterness ushers in a dry finish; and toasted malt lingers gently in its long aftertaste with the occassional appearance of some floral and piney hops. Enjoy this one at just below cellar temperatures to get the most out of it."
"Fat Squirrel is a well-crafted brown ale that (unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned) tastes more like coffee than anything else. It isn't overpowering however, and although I would never buy it on a regular basis, it was fine as long as the bottle lasted. Another good New Glarus beer for which I have Skidz to thank."
"This poured with a big, tan-colored head that gave off a malty, nutty (think hazelnut) scent on the nose. The head quickly subsided, but it left behind a light amber beer. The first sip revealed a very sweet, very nutty flavor. It had a medium mouthfeel, but gave a great lingering, nutty aftertaste. I found it to be a great accompaniment to a meal of WI brats."
"Drinkability: an every day drinker of decent quality. neither here nor there but quite good without having wowed me."
"12oz. bottle: This beer pours a fairly clear amber color with an off-white head. It didn't linger for long. The aroma is caramel malty with some roastiness. A bit nutty also. The roastiness comes through in the taste with a good malty body behind it. Some nuttiness also. A very nice beer."
"One of the best from New Glarus."
"Brown and hazy, greenish head of rounded 1/2 inch foam. Laces in primary rings. Sweet malty aroma, almost a sugary pecan pie sense with caramel and associated ""pie crust"" biscuity qualities. Body is shy of medium, with moderate carbonation. Maltiness strikes first, and follows the aroma note-for-note, just a little sweeter than Schell Snowstorm 2003. Finishes softly, with slight hop, but more of the crusty breadiness lingering into the aftertaste. This beer is entirely pleasant and perfect for a drinking session."
"Excellent beer Dan!"
"And I though I was impressed with the Native Ale(brown) but this is a solid beer all around. Nice light syrup brown with a amber tone to its slightly hazy color, tall one inch cream colored head that recedes slowly to a thin skim always present and thin whispy web stings and patches. Aroma is dry and woodish, slightly sweet and roasty with a nice overlay of nuttyness, hazel and almond I make out pretty well but I believe there is more here then I'm cable of putting my nose to. But its a pretty nice whiffer either way you put it. Nice taster too, flavor is mild but stays long of a nice little roasty maltyness with some nutty factions of almond candybar and hazelnut. A super fine drying quality just keeps sitting there on your palate which is quite extraordinary. The dryness produces a nice little wood-like dryness with a small bready fluffyness thats really nice. Solid medium body, bold, nearly full in the middle, lightly creamy in a way near the finish along with all the nice little drying qualities, which I'm really digging about this beer. Subtle but flavorful with lots of things going for it. Another New Glarus winner! A session beer all the way! Glad to have picked this up at Ciccone's, my new favorite place to venture on Sundays."
"Big thanks to cokes for the sample!"
"Smells roasted and nutty. Taste is very subdued roasted and nutty with some caramel. The best thing about this is that the roasted and nutty flavors are subdued. Often nut browns provide too much of these flavors. My first New Glarus experience. Not blown away but a very nice example of a style I don't particularly like. The subtleness of the beer is very much appreciated."
"An excellent brown ale...color is light brown with an impressive vanilla head on top that rims the glass...nose is toasty and nutty....flavor is toasty and nutty as well...also, some caramel and breadiness deepere in....hops complement the flavor nicely...this seems pretty full-bodied for a brown ale, but still easily drinkable....New Glarus does not brew bad beers....some are just better than others....this is one of those that is better than some of their others..."
"The beer is a dulled, hazy copper-brown color. A medium sized airy white head sits on top and sticks around for the duration. Rings are left on the glass for viewing pleasure. The aroma is pretty damn good for a brown. Roasted nut, toasted malt and cocoa are the domineering players. The mouthfeel is so creamy and nice. Body of about medium. Toasted malt comes to the forefront on the palete. Also a subdued roasted bitterness. A little bready yeasty touch is a appealing. And the nutty tones comes to play as well. This is really a pleasurable brown ale to consume. The epitome of a session beer."
"Mellow yet interesting. And quaffable in large sums."
"This bottle conditioned unfiltered nut brown ale pours a slightly hazy caramel-copper color in appearance. The head is a fluffy off-white, light tan color. Decent carbonation apparent. Tantalizing aroma consists of caramel malt, roasted nuts and a touch of oak. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and somewhat fizzy. The taste has a nice rich roasted malt flavor in combination with a delicious toasted nuttiness. Midtones consist of melted caramel in addition to an almost pumpkin pie crusty goodness. More sweet caramel follows with a dusty oaken finish. Slight hop bitterness lingers. This is a must have for brown ale fans. Another excellent offering from New Glarus."
