"It's a nicely balanced beer that's not complicated, but still interesting enough; and which offers enough richness to leave it satisfying without becoming 'too much'. Given the price ($1.17 single bottle) it's hard to beat as an occasional semi-sweet dark ale."
""
"Good stuff. Nice full flavor brew. Can't go wrong with a beer you can actually taste."
"Overall: a relatively simple al that has a nice roasted flavor. Easy to consume."

"Dark brown, with relatively small head. Caramely malt smell. Taste and mouthfeel is smooth (albeit not as smooth as a Velvet Merlin) but also roasty. Has kind of a ""rusty"" quality to it. Pleasant, but I'd opt for a Velvet Merlin, if it's at the local Trader Joe's, instead, for an extra couple of dollars per six-pack."
"O: enjoyable and economical dark ale that straddles the brown ale / light porter categories.  Improved with warming."
""
"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable, kind of a hybrid between an English Brown Ale and an English Porter but one that I found to be mostly successful. Could easily have a couple of these in a session."

"Overall: A very flavorful beer from Trader Joe's for a good price point. I would recommend this to drinkers who like malty beers."

"Good brown or dark ale. Loved the malts."
""
""
"Body is medium and it's pretty darn drinkable. No real complaints, but it's also not going to make front page. It plenty drinkable tho."
"Overall: Very nice brown ale. Would have again."
""

"A good brew for the cold months, but also would work on warm day, if chilled. and the price can't be beat."

"well I will not seek this out, thankful for the bring over but that is all"
""
"The taste is generally on the sweet and malty side but it does not go overboard. Nuts, malts, and the most modest of a hop finale. It is easy to drink but it is nothing out of the ordinary for the style."
""
""
"Poured into pint glass from a bottle purchased at Trader Joes in Carmel Mountain CA. Amberish dark brown in appearance with a big fluffy head that retains excellent lacing as you sip on the brew. Smells like toffee, caramel, pretty swet scent on the nose. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky the nose is deceptive, was expecting a sweeter taste, but this is very balanced, earthy and malty in taste. First time trying anything from Black Toad Brewing, this was a pleasent brew."

"Overall: I am very impressed by this beer. Everything about it is incredibly complex, especially for a brown ale. In all honesty, it tastes more like a light bodied stout than a brown to me. I will definitely be drinking more of this in the future. A lot more."
""
""

"The dark dried fruit flavors in Black Toad certainly do make it a ""distinctive"" dark (i.e., brown) ale. I'll be revisiting this beer soon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a fairly decent brown, definitely on the lighter side - the flavors are good but not bold enough to really make a statement or impression of any kind. A few folks around here seem to like it well enough, give her a try and see what you think."

"I thought this was fine. A step above Newcastle, but there are much better brown ales around."

"Overall / drinkability: One is enough for me, I could not drink another by itself. With food...maybe another one per evening, but it's still quite sweet. Might make a very interesting base for a vanilla ice cream float though. Still, a good full-flavor beer. Just make sure you're ready for the sweetness when you pop one open."

"A very solid brown that I would have again, great price, and easy to get a hold of."
""
""
""
""
"[*This paired exceptionally well with a Carlos Toraño Reserva Decadéncia cigar]"
"Taste is sweet, with a bit of roast and nuttiness. Seems to me like a brown ale with a little extra char. Easy enough to drink, but not outstanding."
"Amazing beer for the price... I think I paid $1.00 for this guy at trader joes. Sweet Nutty flavor with a creamy mouthfeel. Some very subtle toffee notes in there. Not overly complex in flavor but it really hits the spot if your looking for a slightly sweet smooth dark ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Good. Rich and malty, this is one of the better beers from Trader Joe’s Josephsbrau label."
""
""
""
"Overall Drinkability: Not great initially, but this is actually a very good session. Nothing outstanding, but the feel makes it enticing."
"Surprisingly good taste considering the price, head appearance, and smell! A nice regular house beer to have if you are on a budget, or plan on drinking quite a few in one night."
""
""
"notes: It's not Goose Island Nut Brown Ale but it is easy drinking and for the price, a good value. Would buy again."
""
""
"Not knocking my socks off. This one is in the ok zone."
"A beautiful brown with spectacular red/amber highlights reminiscent of a late night sunset. Poured a two finger light tan head with considerable lacing clinging to the side of the pint glass. Hidden inside the amber notes float a moderate amount of bubbles. Aroma screams of nutty goodness. Hints of chocolate and raisins are also present. No hops make an appearance. Flavor is malt dominated with a complexity of bitter chocolate, toffee, dark fruits and toasted nuts. A sweet caramel tone lingers along with a very slight butterscotch flavor. There is also a slight roasted bitterness and just a touch of herbal hops. Carbonation leans toward the low side. Combine this with the residual sweetness and it makes for a medium mouthfeel. Overall a very good beer. I really enjoyed the combination of flavors"

"This is one of the cheap beers from trader joes it's not bad at all for not much more than $1 a bottle. Very malty tastes more like an Oktoberfest than a brown ale."
""
""
"More chocolate and toast than anticipated. Decidedly sweet, but fairly flavorful. Very malt dominant."

"Given the relatively low ABV and the ""budget"" price-point - this is proving to be quite the Autumn session ale in my home. One of the best values on offer from Trader Joe's. Definitely inspired by a number of Northern style English browns - this beer quietly bests a number of them."
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours a dark ruddy brown amber with a one finger fine medium brown head with good retention and slippery lacing. Aroma of toasted malt, brown bread, a hint of chocolate. Flavor of toasted and biscuit malt, butterscotch and mild nuts and chocolate. Finishes with light sweet toasted malt and caramel. Pretty darn good for a cheap low ABV brown ale. A bit on the sweet side, and mild flavors, but I like it."

"O - I have to round this one up a bit, simply for the fact this is probably the best ""budget micro"" I've come across. Very solid, malty brown ale for BMC cost. Well done!"
""
"The body was typically decent for the style, smooth and medium bodied, with a bit of a sticky-sweet finish. Drinkability was good, as brown ales usually tend to be. Overall, an OK beer, one that's worth grabbing a sixer of as a budget option."
""
""
"A Trader Joe's perennial. A different take on the ""other"" brown ale, so popularly debased by Newcastle."
"Overall: This beer is an excellent member of the genre. Its a touch watery in the flavor otherwise really nice beer."

""
""
"High C"
""
""
"O: I was really surprised by this beer. Darker and more malty than I expected. I grabbed it as part of a mixed ""sixer."" Next time I will grab a full six pack of this."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a beer I've purchased a few times over the years, and I wonder why I don't buy it more often (probably due to it's Trader Joe's exclusivity). At $5.99 per sixer, it's certainly one of the better bargain beers to be had."
""
"Pours a clear crimson brown with a 1/2 inch foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace drip back into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt and burnt caramel/toffee aromas. Taste is of roast malt, bread, caramel, and a slightly nutty and herbal hop finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a light carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some nice roasty aromas and flavors."
""

""
""
"A little on the sweet side for my taste, but pretty good all around."
""
""
"A SOLID A. Try it, or buy a case worth for your next party. $"
""
"Food Pairing: I'd pair this with bacon wrapped steak cubes and roasted baby red potatoes."
""
"O - for the price, it's a pretty darn good beer."
"Agreeable and inexpensive brown ale by way of Trader Joe's."
""
"O: A real good beer at a buck a bottle. Actually feels bigger than 5.3% which is a boon at this price point."
""
""
""
"A decent english brown/porter."
""
""
""
"D: Definitely an interesting brown ale -- much like a stout in flavor."
"O: just a hell of a tasty brown ale. Tastes like England! This is one toad I could lick again and again."
"This beer was surprisingly enjoyable. It had been sitting in the fridge for a while so I decided to drink it. It pours pretty dark. The slightest light is able to get through a very dark brown. Smells of oats and dark chocolate. The first thing that struck about the taste was its sweetness and relative thickness. For an abv of about 5%, I was not expecting big flavors. This is a good brew. Simple, no frills, and one of the better brown ales I have had."
"D: A very drinkable beer. I was expecting a canned mushroom brown ale. This is way better than many of the English browns that I have tried."
"This is a pretty tasty dark brown ale. It pours coffee colored with a nice head, and smells like coffee and chocolate. It has a rich malty taste that tastes a lot like it smells. It has a deeper coffee bite than a lot of browns, probably because it's so dark. Quite a nice brown ale."
"For $5.99 a six at Trader Joe's this is good value for a well made brown ale that has a big mouthfeel and a good long finish. Not the most complex of brown ales this still works well with a big malty taste and a little on the sweetness side. I will add this to the Mission ST Pale Ale and IPA as my fave TJs beers"
"Poured 12oz bottle into a Belgian Tulip. OK, I will not do my typical review for this. This has a very nice dark brown color with good head and lacing. The smell is very sweet caramel malts. The taste is the same. A bit sweet for my taste. Good carbonation, nice body. Overall, good, but not great. I would drink this again, but again it's a bit sweet so I could not drink this often."
"Clear brown with a coppery hue and a soapy tan cap. Decent head retention with clumpy lacing. Brown sugar and pear/apple fruitiness in the aroma, a little bready, hints of roasted malts and vanilla. Very similar flacour profile, just a little less potent. Low, grassy bitterness with brown sugar and fruit, bread and faint dark malt. Creamy texture, lightish body with moderate carbonation. Overall, pretty enjoyable with some nice English character."
"I have never given this beer to somebody who didn't like it. It is definitely a popular beer at parties, and for the price, it's hard to complain. Definitely a buy; definitely something to keep in stock."
"It has a nice brown nut ale flavor to it. The roasted barley is great. My fiance got this for me from Trader Joe's. I need her to get me some more."
"Overall, a nice dark ale, presenting and showcasing many of the standard flavors of the style, but doing so with a class and subtlety--as well as with larger flavors--than many of its peers."
"A very surprising beer that looks heavier than it is and is actually quite light and drinkable, bordering on a session beer for malty beer fans; the price of a six pack makes this even more sessionable, so thank you Trader Joe’s."
"O- very tasty and i downed this pretty quick. def would rec a sixer"
"Overall- an enjoyable lighter ale. Good for the summer months when craving a darker beer but want something less heavy than a stout or porter. Very enjoyable beer."
"For a name like ""black toad", this poured very brown. I do suppose it is a brown ale. Malt bomb all the way around. Smelled sweet and malty, tasted sweet and malty. Maybe a little bit nutty, but mostly just a malt bomb. Mouthfeel was light and carbonated. Really no finish to it what so ever. Overall...I poured this down my drain. Funny thing is that I used to drink it often before I really got into beer, and before my pallet became snobbish. This was horrible IMO and I'll never buy it again, even if it's only a buck."
"Final thought - $5 a sixer and 5+ABV and tastes great. Not bad at all"
"Unrefrigerated: Nice head with OK retention. Moderate lacing at the top of the glass. Smell is not remarkable, but caramel is noticeable. Tastes delicious, with a great walnutty aftertaste that sticks around for a while. I can forget about every other characteristic of this beer just because the taste is so good."
"This pours a beautiful burgundy red. nice crisp brown head. Smells very malty a lot like a porter. Very well carbonated that has a nice sweet and malty flavor. Strong Chocolate flavor that really rounds this out nicely and finishes with a perfect hop flavor. I am so impressed with this beer. I am not even a huge fan of brown beers and porters but this is a great beer."
"T: The body is fairly light and I remember this being better when I had it before. I get some relatively faint flavors of roasted malt, a big of a charred flavor, some medium roast coffee and a bit of maple on the finish. Worth a try but not fantastic."
"M: an easy one for drink, but not simple. This beer combines the sweetness and the bitterness very softly since the beginning and all the way until the last ending."
"I was pretty impressed with this beer; it had a nice combination of roasted malt and sweet nut character that I had hoped it would offer and it was extremely drinkable."
"My bottle says a brewery from San Jose, CA. I know use to be Goose Island now it is Joseph Brau Brewery. I like. Good Beer at a good price. I would pick it up again at Trader Joes! not too many good black ale that are in code and good! The aftertaste is ok but I can live with this beer. This is now my everyday beer!"
"Clear dark chestnut pour and a thick, tight off-white head on top. Nutty, sweet brown bread-like aromas...toffee, faint sweet chocolate, fruit, and very light diacetyl and smoke. Dry, nutty flavor. Bitter chocolate, caramel sweetness, and a bit of earthy hops. Medium-light-ish body. Pretty tasty and certainly a good deal. Not sure why I waited so long to grab a single."
"D: This is a nice, session beer with that bready, toasty malt quality you like in a dark, session ale"
"Black Toad Dark Ale is a tasty little treat when you feel like drinking something distinctly different. Swallowing this Toad every morning, rather than being disgusting, would be a good way to start off your 'don't have to work today' day."
"The color is a dark brown this opaque beer has a nice head and decent retainibility. The taste is a hint of coffee with burnt grains and a nice hop finish. The bitterness of the hops is well balanced. One of my favorite beers that comes in 6 packs. I suggest for the price at about 1$ a beer you pick up a few of these for you next tasting, I found mine at trader joes."
"This English Brown Ale was poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. The Beer pours a dark brown color. It produces an underwelming amount of head that quickly dissipates. Head Retention is very much below average. The beer is under carbonated Lacing is below average. Low marks for appearance. The news does get a little better with the smell, deep aroma of chocolate and coffee come through. The taste is surprisingly good, a deep roasted malt flavor that gives way to chocolate and coffee. There is also a nice ""nut"" flavor that is present. The finish is ""warming"" and has a nice hop bitterness about it. The mouthfeel is a medium body that is typical for an English Brown Ale. This is a very nice session beer- it's a lot bigger then say New Castle, which many consider the flagship for English Brown Ales. Overall pretty good beer- and did I mention that it is contract brewed by Goose Island?"
"Pours a dark but still translucent mahogany color topped with a substantial creamy head. It has a thin, light, fruity aroma, with notes of cherries, raisins, and hint of floral hops. The flavor is likewise light and fruity, but there are also characteristics of roasted nuts and dirty, earthy hops. The sharply tingling carbonation is merely distracting, but is frankly unpleasant, which really detracts from the light, fruity malt flavor. Overall, this beer has its good qualities, but not there is not enough good to make this one any more than a mediocre-to-average beer."
"Would be good with roasted meats. Could go well with a dessert provided it wasn't too rich."
"Overall: It was good. Not great. If I was in the mood to drink an English Brown Ale, I would pass over Newcastle and pick up this."
"D_Goes down fairly smooth. $5.99 a six pack at Trader Joes, really not a bad deal for a decent brew."
"Pours a fairly dark brown color. Not much head at all. Smells like malt, coffee, chocolate. Taste is Pretty much the same. Some chocolate and coffee. A little bitter but not overpowering. The more I drink it, the smoother it gets. Not a bad beer, I'll probably try it again if the price is right."
"D. A good brew not creamy and thick like a stout. Nice balance and good flavor."
"D - I could easily sit back and finish off a few of these. All-around this is a pretty good brew."
"This poured deep black with a light, sandy head with some lacing. On the nose there is a sweet, almost raspberryish note that hangs out underneath a bigger, toasted malt flavor. I hadn't noticed that until my third one because it's buried pretty deep. On the tongue there is a nice mix of the sweeter, fruity flavors and a little bit of the dark malt. It's a strange but really nice, subtle mixture. In the mouth it's pretty thin and doesn't have a very large body. It just doesn't stick around much. But that makes for a beer that would be very easy to sit back and drink lots of, and with a good mix of subtler aromas and flavors like this beer has, that's not entirely a bad thing."
"Overall a solid brown ale for the money. Certainly plenty of flavor the keep it interesting."
"Overall a nice rather well mix of well integrated mild flavors making a tasty whole, quite drinkable and crisp for a brown ale."
"Overall not bad, but not great as the coffee overtones were too much....and as a non coffee drinker... I will pass for next time"
"D- Incredibly easy. Slides down your throat like dew on a blade of grass. Delightful."
"12oz bottle purchased at Trader Joe's. Pours dark brown with a tanned long lasting foamy head. The aroma of dark fruit, raisins, roasted malt with hints of floral hops. The flavor was sweet dark fruit and caramel malt in the beginning followed by light coffee and dark chocolate notes. Finish is short and on a sweet side. I did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised. For this price I will definitely buy it again."
"When I saw this at TJ I just had to grab one. It pours a clear ruby-brown topped by a small finger of ecru foam. The nose comprises brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel, toffee, light cocoa, and a hint of tobacco. The taste holds notes of light toffee, light chocolate, caramel, and some very light florals. The body is a light medium, with a light carbonation and a fairly smooth feel. Overall, a very nice bit o' brew, though the taste lacks full character, as though it were too light for its own good. Beyond that, though, I could easily sit down with a sixer o' this and enjoy myself (and the more-than-reasonable price makes that even easier)."
"Drinkability is good. A reasonable abv, pronounced smell and flavor and good solid mouthfeel. This one could be pleasantly swilled as a session beer or with a meal."
"D: Whiile I couldn't drink a whole lot of these, I bought it at a good price ($6 for a sixer) and it was certainly money well spent. A solid, drinkable brown ale. Once I got past my disappoint that ""Black Toad"" does not mean ""Black Ale"" I thoroughly enjoyed this beer."
"I show this one as a trader joe's beer - so I'm not sure what Black Toad brewing is."
"Overall: A solid offering, but a bit seasonal for my tastes. A definite winner for the Holidays."
"This is a good looking beer. It has nice opaque body. The head is bubbly and the frothiness stays in the middle. It has a sweet candy like aroma that reminds me of a lot of dark Belgians. Its flavor is like a mild porter. There are some mild roasted malt esters. It has thin mouthfeel. There is some carbonation bite."
"A very dark English brown ale that is very similar to Newcastle, but not quite the same caliber. Easy to drink, but not particularly impressive. It has a some malty taste that is a little sweet and has a weak finish. Not a lot of body to the beer and lacking a distinguishing characteristic."
"Drinkability: Very nice addition to the Trader Joe line-up. If I lived close to one, I would definitely grab a few more of these, but in the meantime, I'll just savor the ones I have."
"Ugh, it's like my tongue used my uvula for a speed bag. It started off so well, perhaps it was old because I don't remember hating it that much last time."
"A good beer, just not very complex. I would hazard at some specialty grains and a mixture of roasted barley with some black patent or something like that. Worth a try, especially for the price"
"D - This is a bit too burn-y tasting and a lot too weak for the style. I honestly thought this was more of a ""Euro dark lager"" than a porter, as it is a bit on the thin side. It is relatively easy drinking and mild, but the over-done burnt steak (grill char) flavor is a bit much."
"D: Once is enough for me. Decent, but not spectacular."
"Drinkability: Easy drinking, dark English Ale. Certainly not an American Porter, more like an English Brown Porter or an English Brown Ale."
"Good solid porter and something I would drink again, but not one that I'd go out of my way for..."
"M/D - Pretty tasty brew, medium bodied with a very smooth flavor. It went down pretty easy and I also recommend that people should try it. I picked it up at a trader Joe's"
"The flavor here is neither bold nor complex, but it is drinkable."
"with enough depth to keep me interested."
"Pours an extremely dark brown with glints of deep ruby red on the edges; a big brown head sits up top. Aromas are sweet, with the smell of dark fruits melding with coffee notes and a strong nutty element. The flavors are sweeter and more chocolatey than the nose would suggest (I mean this in a good way). Milk chocolatey sweet finish. All around a very solid beer, not to mention a bargain."
"Drinkability> I could drink this again for sure. Easy."
"Picked up a single at TJ in Brookline for $1. Poured into a beer glass. Very dark brown color, and a large head. Nice lacing on the glass. Overall nice presentation. Smell was of faint traces of chocolate. Taste was a lot better than I was expecting. Very flavorful combination of cocoa, coffee, and malt. Nice and hearty mouthfeel, with the malt giving it a good backbone. Smooth and easy to drink. For $5.99 a six pack, this goes on the list as another example of very well priced beers at Trader Joe's."
"Other comments: Meh... fairly lacklustre."
"Thanks Steve for sharing."
"Taste, more toffee, some burnt malt, doesn't smack of chocolate or coffee like you might expect from the color. No hops. Thin malt. Pick one, don't not have either. Mouthfeel is lacking, no depth, no heft, thin, watery for a porter. Can't be drinkable if I don't like anything else about it. The last one of my 6 pack sat in the fridge for over a year. I forget who the sucker was that drank this."
"Very nice two finger white head that contrasts beutifully with the darkness of the beer. Small amount of head stays until the very end and produces wonderful laceing. The lower abv allows for this beer to be drank all night, and the flavor allows you to actually want to. There is nothing that boldly stands out in the flavor, but instead it is very well balanced. This great balance of suttle flavors of nut, coffee, chocholate perhaps leads to a very drinkable beer. Being $5.99 a six pack from trader joes makes this beer all the better."
"D: A very drinkable beer but straddles brown ale and porter styles. I will pick this up when I'm in the malty mood."
"D - A stand out ale on its own"
"Purchased at Trader Joes. Pours a black body with dark brown corners and a thick off-white head that falls to a cap. Aroma of dark roasted malts and a bit sweet cream. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation. Flavor is sweet with a bit of a metallic hint to it. There's a chocolate bitterness in the finish that sticks around for far too long. This is a bit overly sweet to be high in drinkability."
"Drinkability: A little too sweet for my palate, and more like an English Brown than a Porter, this beer has a lot of flavor and is very easy to drink"
"Pours a clear, dark brown about midway between mahogany and cola with a fairly thick if not persistent pale cinnamon head. Aroma is strong, smoky and malty with nutty and molasses hints. Flavor, unfortunately, does not live up to the promise of the aroma - it is malty with nutty and caramel undertones but lacks the nice smoky touch of what I regard as a true porter. Texture is quite smooth and just a teensy on the watery side."
"Overall: welcome in my home anytime"
"D- Pretty easy to drink, great session beer."
"D- not sure if it was the beer or am I just not a fan of porters. the carbonation is so strong it almost taste more like a cola than a beer. won't buy again."
"Drinkability: A decent Porter for the price. Could be a little darker and have more flavor, but that would of course jack up the price. And it's light enough to drink on a summer day without being too thick or overpowering. I'd drink it again."
"D- easy to finish and at one dollar a bottle, this is a fantastic bargain. something ill pick up again and a pretty good porter. im not sure its as good as alot of the eastern european porters, but its different. check this one out, trader joes has some pretty good ""no name"" beers."
"Drinkability: decent beer, very drinkable. i'm sold on pretty much all the beers you can get from Trader Joes. very good beers for the price."
"This is a great price for a beer. This is a great beer for the price. Not a great beer, but not a bad price. Get it?"
" ~ Krista brought back a sixer from Illinois a few weeks back. I didn't share these with anyone."
"Its super drinkable and excellent about the style. But, there was somthing in there that just didnt taste like my thing with the dark fruits and molasses."
"Taste was nice, moderate cocoa sweetness, some toffee, and traces of almond or walnut in the aftertaste. Minor roasted barley and leafy hop flavor in the back, not bitter at all though. Feel was good, ample carbonation, slight fullness to it, but went down easy. Overall I was pretty impressed with this, and it can't be beat for the price."
"not bad for the price."
"I'm not sure if I would get again, when it comes to porters I don't mind spending the extra couple dollars for some of the offerings we have around town."
"Pours a dark brown with very little light coming through. Has a decent tan head that dissipates quickly into a good collar. Laciness was thin. Fruity and malty aroma. Taste is earthy and nutty. Beer has a bitterness that stays in the background that keeps it interesting. Light and crisp mouthfeel, good medium body. I really enjoyed the flavor, very mellow and complex. This beer sits light, a number of these can be had in a sitting."
"Drinkability: Well, it's be no means outstanding, but it's certainly one of the better beers from the Trader Joe's lineup."
"One of nicer Trader Joe's beer offerings, actually made by the venerable Goose Island, this dark lager does hold up, although not quite to some other dark lagers out there. A rich brown-black pour to black, with beige thin 1 finger head & good lace. The aroma is definitely of hearty roasted dark malts & orange-spiced coffee, a bit odd, but ok. The mouthfeel is a bit oily but the body is good, medium & rich, with good malt flavors with the slightest hint of hops. Not the most complex one out there, but a good, readily available dark lager."
"Very drinkable. A very good beer. I highly recommend picking up a bottle to try the next time you're at Trader Joe's. It's a great deal, being 5.99 a sixer."
"Final Thoughts - This beer really had some serious problems. The aroma and flavor were really that bad. I will have to investigate this beer again. The $5 price for a six pack seemed too good to be true, and ultimately it was. Further investigation is needed."
"This is a good session beer, good as a Brown Ale and well balanced. Keep an eye out on the date for twisties."
"Dark amber with a nice collar of tan head that quickly fades into a skim, leaves some lace. Smells of cocoa and nice roasted grain. Tastes of chocolate, honey, appleskin and coffee with a decent bitter in the finish to balance the sweet flavors. Lighter bodied and easy drinking. I really can't think of a better value than this stuff. Brewed by Goose Island for Trader Joe's."
"Overall: Not a bad little porter, not an amazing taste but very drinkable and worth the price. Thank you Trader Joe's, this is one of your better."
"D--very one dimesional brew. It doesn't taste ""bad"" in an off flavor sense but just seems to have a flavor that is non-distinctive."
"d: it's drinkable, but that's because it doesn't taste like much."
"D - decent beer and even better for the price. It just needs a little more ""umph"""
"Light cola brown body. Small, ephemeral, dirty beige head. Nose of sweet caramel malts, Hershey's syrup, licorice, and light roasted barley. Lightly roasted malt and cardboard up front. Caramel and cola sweetness follow. Old roasted coffee bitterness mixes with astringent graininess near the finish. Doughy, caramel sweetness sticks out in the finish. Moderate body with a fizzy feel. Not terrible, but not that good."
"Pours a root beer color with not much carbonation. Smells of roasted malts with some nutty aroma notes present in the nose. First sip is heavy malts that are roasted almost burnt. There is some caramel and toffee flavors detected with only a little hops detected. There is a grassy flavor that is not welcomed."
"Very drinkable, but not a 12-pack kind of beer."
"Notes from 12/22/06"
"Not too heavy, not overly carbonated, not bad. reasonably drinkable, well balanced beer (albeit coming from a big malt fan, not that into hops), drinkable, and worth at least checking out."
"Affordable as well. Something I will definitely have again, but not something I will rush to buy. Thanks to my buddies dad for introducing this to me."
"Pours a dark brown with small yellow head, but poor retention. No lacing to speak of. Smells of roasted malts. Fits the style of an American Porter. Tastes of roasted malts that quickly turns into a slight hop and then finishes with more malt. Low almost non-existent carbonation. Overall, an easy to drink porter, but lacking in body."
"This poured a slightly hazy mahogany with some light tan head. It smelled like dry roasted coffee and cocoa, with old oak and earthy spices and a bit of molasses. It tasted very earthy and dry, like mocha with creamy vanilla oak. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter earthy aftertaste. Overall this was a very subtle and complex beer that was quite tasty. It had good body and was very easy to drink. This was one of those beers you can gulp, but you prefer to sip. Surprisingly good."
"Poured a murky brown, not quite as dark as a solid stout black. A medium-sized an head appears and then just as quickly, vanishes! The aroma is slightly sweet, roasty, malty, almost smoky. Flavor is almost amber-ale like- malty, sweetish, easy drinking with a slight hop bite at the back of the throat. A drinkable brew found at the local Trader Joe's- nothing exciting, nothing terrible."
"D - Very drinkable for style."
"D - This is a pretty good porter and very affordable."
"It was dirt cheap and I got it as a single at Trader Joe's, so a really good brew for the price and a damn fine session drink."
"D- Definitely a very drinkable dark beer. You could polish off a few of these with no problem and not get bored with the flavors."
"I was very surprised by this one I will be seeking out more."
"D - A bit of an odd duck I think. It's about the color of a porter, and quite heavy, but has the flavours I would associate with a substantially lighter ale rather than a porter. That said, it's easy drinking and has some decent flavours."
"Edit. Tried this one again. Pours richer and with a sticky head, offering some very good retention. Nose remains a bit lagerish but has a nice blend of scents on the nose. Appearance plus 1, taste plus .5. Still has a bit of a schwazbier sense to it at times but more complex. Not bad."
"Drinkability: A nice middle of the road porter. A little high on carbonation and sweetness for my tastes, but all in all, not too bad."
"Happy sipping."
"Mouthfeel way too thin, but very drinkable."
"A Trader Joe's exclusive - Dark Toad Ale pours a dark reddish brown with a nice substantial tan head that leaves some lacing. Black licorice, chocolate, and smoke are the primary aromas. Milk chocolate and medium roast coffee dominate the palate. There is some smoky notes as well. This beer would go very well in chili if adding beer to the chili. The depth of flavor in the chili would be accentuated by the roasted flavors here. Some hefty carbonation here, which could be toned down given the style. Not a bad beer by any means - easy drinking, not too heavy with some refreshing components. Recommended."
"Black Toad is not a great porter, but a good one. Worth the $1.00 purchase from Trader Joe's. For $6 a sixer, it is worth a purchase."
"This is one of the few dark ales I am able to get at Trader Joes, so it is always a nice standby."
"pours a deep black color with a slighty frothy almost stout like head. smell is of chocolately malt no hop of yeast aroma. taste is pretty good, so far the best from trader joe's that i've had over the past few days. the beer also has a nice mouthfeel to it, rich and thick full of flavor and body. good beer overall"
"This is an outstanding beer at the often seen price of $4.99 / six-pack. While fairly sweet, the fruitiness adds complexity and it has just enough roast grain character to keep this in balance."
"Overall: Very nice, very drinkable. I'm impressed with these Illini."
"Drinkability- Very smooth and very affordable considering the Trader Joes pricing. Most of my beers cost the price of an entire sixer of this stuff. Very good for the swilling or cooking needs."
"Very good head retention as I'm down to the last couple of ounces and there's still a solid 1/2"" layer. This is another one of them ""fun"" beers to drink and I'm glad I got to try it."
"Drank really easy, not a great porter, but serviceable enough. A little more malt depth would've helped the cause. I too thought this had some Schwartz bier & or dunkelbier characteristics as well"
"rating: 3.53"
"Drinkability - a tasty brew that I would recommend to fans of the essential porter."
"Pretty much the essence of mediocrity. Miles above a macrobrew, but certainly nothing worth going out of your way for. Use it for cooking, not for drinking."
"All in all, quite tasty and smoothly drinkable. I'll definitely pick up a sixer of this again."
"Bought this beer because my wife thought it sounded good-and she was right. Pours a dark, deep brown with little head retention. Hops aroma is minimum and there is a roasted malt aroma. Taste is good I pick up a toasted malt finish with little hop bitterness. Mouth feel is medium and drinkability good. Nice beer. Nothing outstanding, not a robust American porter-but a good drinking beer."
"Overall I am underwhelmed by the subtleness of this beer."
"This is called a porter but in my opinion is more of a dark ale. It's easy to drink but not one I'd like to drink as a session."
"Pours a solid brown-black with more yellow than red highlights. Head is beige and mildly persistent. Aroma is roasted coffee with a little hint of English-variety hops. Taste is mainly about the roast, although a little sweetness makes an appearance as the beer warms up. Quite drinkable for a darker beer, but is a little too one-dimensional to keep your interest piqued through glass after glass. At about a buck a bottle, it is a good value."
"A nice beer somewhere between a black lager and a stout, more than it is a porter (at least in my thoughts!). It's not so heavy either, which works quite well for this beer. Certainly worth a try; I'll get again for sure."
"drinkability is okay.. session beer type, and at the inexpensive price a better option than a macro, but too many other great beers to try for me to drink this again."
"The appearance after the pour from the 12 ounce bottle is a deep black walnut brown, with ruby highlights, the head a modest sized light tan in color with the texture creamy, after its dissipation the lace forms a thin sheet that covers the glass. Nose has a nutlike sweetness, hints of caramel and a tiny bit of coffee. Start has pleasing malt sweetness; a touch of burnt grain bitterness also present, top is light to medium in feel. Finish has a mild to average acidity, the hops modest in their bite, sweet and dry, a drinkable beer, but seems more an English Brown than a Porter."
"d: pretty easy"
"The aroma of the dark ale is a roasty toasty malt. The taste is chocolate that is pretty smooth. It is a good balance between the roastiness and the hops. It is a great deal at 4.99 a six pack."
"D- This is a very drinkable beer for how cheap it is at trader joes. Another excellent brew if you are on a budget."
"Being in PA, I probably won't see this beer again until a trip to Bahston Mass, but I will pick this up again."
"Drinkability: Nothing objectionable about this beer. Not special.... not memorable.... OK.... good for the price... was it $4.99 or $5.99 for a six pack?... I don't remember.... but good value...."
"Drinkability: Nothing special. Not really objectionable either. Good session beer, and fairly inexpensive."
"O'all - An enjoyable, flavorful porter. Could use some more hop and dark malt ""bite", and a slightly drier finish. A very nice beer, but not a classic porter example."
"Pours a dark brown that shows some ruby highlights when held up to light, the beer is topped by an off-white diminishing head. The aroma has some dark malt characteristics with a hint of chocolate. The taste is somewhat well balanced, however, there's something just a bit off. Dark malts and chocolate blend well with some light citrus hops, but it's far from the best. The beer is light and mildly carbonated. This beer is drinkable at 92 cents a bottle from Trader Joe's, but I'd rather spend the extra change for something better."
"This is a good entrance into the dark ale style. A value priced ale at Trader Joes!"
"I have had some beer from Trader Joes that would take varnish off a bar top, so I was not sure what to expect. From a 12 oz bottle this poured almost black (dark brown) with a medium tan head and decent lacing. Nose of roasted malts and chocolate. Mouthfeel smooth. Flavor of caramel, chocolate, and toffee. A little nuts in the finish. This is a good value from Trader Joes. Nice brown."
"The taste first hit me with a slight, nutty malt flavor followed by barley, hops, chicory, and some coffee notes. The mouthfeel was refreshing and smooth with an aftertaste that tried its best to stick around, but just couldn't get the job done. Carbonation levels were lackluster. Overall, it wasn't a bad buy for a buck at Trader Joe's. It's not a standout brew by any means, but it's definitely a drinkable beer."
"D: As far as I am concerned, this is an absolutely perfect sessions porter-enough flavor to keep things interesting, but easy drinking as well."
"Very drinkable. Recommend you pick this up. The point of origin suggests to me that it's brewed by Goose Island."
"Satisfying, surprisingly complex flavor with figs or maybe prunes mixing with the base coffee tones and a bit of smoked meat and a general creaminess. Mouthfeel could stand thickening but certainly doesn't embarrass itself. This is a pleasant surprise and definitely will be a regular when I make pilgrimages up to Cary for organic fruit and tofurky."
"M&D - not very drinkable, slightly off putting taste, with some coffee goodness, but not well blended or balanced, weird they only brew one beer, a decent brew"
"Black Toad lives up to its name, being clearly dark ale, opaque brown to black with a light brown head on it. Good solid roast smell in the nose, but not complex and not much else to go with it. It losing some of the roast the taste w/o adding any complexity, and the body is definately watery. Good training stout if someone is moving into the style for the first time, nothing wrong with drinking one, but this will be my last."
"Drinkability: It didn't wow me, but I enjoyed the hoppy character."
"I tuned to throw the bottle away and the head was gone, never a good way to start. Chocolate and bitter hops take over the flavor. Perhaps I've been ruined by stouts, but this was just too watery. But saying that, it was still pleasant, and a good candidate for a session beer."
"This ale pours a very dark, near stout, color with nice head and some lacing. The smell is roasted malt and is nice. The taste is solid, with a good nuts and chocolate quality that doesn't finish harshly. The mouthfeel is a bit watery for my tastes, but all in all this ale drinks well and I enjoy it on occasion."
"Dark brown  stark white thin head  nose of mocha , malt , molasses , and slight milk chocolate  tastes are milk chocolate , nutty , malt , slight smoky / roasted character - creamy , silky body - aftertaste sweet chocolate slightly bitter baking chocolate"
"Poured into an Imperial pint glass, this beer has a nice thick off-white head and grainy, cocoa-like aroma. The first sip is smooth, with some light roasted malt flavors balanced by a bit of chocolate and lightly bitter hops. The bottle may say dark ale, but this beer has me thinking black lager instead of porter, as it is very clean tasting. The finish is nicely balanced with a pleasant roasted character. Overall, a pretty drinkable dark beer and a good buy."
"Fours all around. This beer to me was very consistent. The ""coke"" dark color and creamy, but thin head was nice. Smell was loaded with toasted chocolate with a little coffee as well. Taste just like smell. Medium bodied with just enough carbonation. A very drinkable beer"
"Strangely, this is a fairly filling beer given the aforementioned watery quality but neither of those things keeps it from being very pleasing. This feels like one of those ""find"" beers; something I would have never guessed to be as good as it is & at a great Trader Joe's price. Still not sure if it's an ale or a porter (really, it tasted like a mix of the two) but it couldn't matter less at this point. Hooray for contract brewing!"
"Another baragin at Trader Joe's in Cambridge. At $5.29 a six, the quality was really surprising. It pours a dark brown with a very nice, creamy head. Smell is distinctly malty, yet there was a definite hop note. Taste is malty with a smoky quality. Light hop notes on the finish. Smooth and easy to quaff on the drinkability scale. Mouthfeel is very nice...smooth, with a nice creamy quality."
"first taste didn't sit to well, a bit acidic and a bit too tart. second sip a little better with a generic dark flavor. slightly thick and coats the mouth. drinkable but boring."
"This beer was rather easy drinking and quite reasonably priced as well."
"Eric"
"This dark ale looked more like a root beer, maybe a little darker. It smelled roasty and coffee. It also tasted the same, quite nutty and plenty of coffee present. The mouthfeel was pretty thin for a porter. It lacked any sort of wow character. There are better selections that I would make if I came across this again."
"Apparently it's cheap which is good, it would be cool to see this fill the same niche as Yuengling's Porter (which is better) in the empty market of cheap dark beer. Were this available at bars priced like its grocery store counterparts it would be excellent for putting a few back while focusing on conversation and not paying attention to beer. As is, it's pretty lackluster for a porter. Maybe should be reviewed as an English Brown Ale, ala Abita Turbo Dog, especially since it claims to be a ""dark ale""? Might fare better in that company, I give it a 3 in that company I think."
"Poured into a clean bar glass, produced a thick head which disappeared almost as soon as the bottle was set down. Nice dark cola-with-coffee color, enjoyed the smell of it at first, or more to the point, enjoyed the anticipation of drinking it. Overall not displeasing to the nose or eye. Now for the mouth's opinion: one good sip, swirl around the tongue, ...ehh! Is this a carbonated batch of coffee water run through a dirty filter a second time, with beer flavoring added, plus some alcohol? Thin and metallic like the saliva drained out from the bottom of a trumpet, chilled, and artificially colored. The taste of this beer is not improved by observing the noxious black amphibian illustrated on the label. However, not to be dismissed completely, it is scads better than the Sea Dog Porter or Trader Joe's Winterfest Bock reviewed during this same tasting session."
"I don't think I'll be trying this one again...much prefer Trader Joe's Black Hart Stout for a dry stout and TJ's Stockyard Oatmeal Stout for a desert, sweet stout...all of these three are at the same price"
"D- This beer has some nice malt qualities and some nice hop qualities but it lacks interest. Some qualities of a Bock, some of a Brown Ale, and some of an Adjunct Lager made it a little confusing and they all kind of washed together."
" An incredibly easy to drink, enjoyable dark, that represents well enough in taste, to forgive the lack of body that connesouers of porters and the like come to expect, but then again, that's part of the charm right?"
"Poured a dark opaque brown with a decent head initially. Nose is of roasted malts and not much else. Taste starts off malty with a hint of coffee and chocolate and finishes smoothly. Mouthfeel is adequately full and fresh. Drinkability is OK as this brew is definitely better than your average macro but does not present a lot of complexity to be a top notch porter."
"Got this at Trader Joes just to try. didn't have super high hopes but i liked the label. pours brown but not opaque. nice head, great long lacing. smalls yeasty, like bread. also some malty odor. Taste is like roasted males at first, then nutty. a hint of molasses and caramel and a rich chocolate aftertaste. tastes a bit like a watered down stout, but in a good way. smooth mouthfeel. carbonation is present but not striking. slides easily down the throat. Great drinkability. this is a session beer if i've ever had one. not sure if i would call this a porter though. that's not the exact style i would select, although im not sure exactly what i would call it. if i was reviewing it as a porter it would get lower marks, i think. definitely worth a try."
"Mouthfeel- Overall a very craemy and nutty palate. The nuts stay with the tongue the longest. A little dry as well."
"Another Trader Joe's associated beer that is offered at a great price for the product."
"A decent offering. Poured out to a medium brown / black color with a large foamy white head. Medium level of carbonation. Lacing was minimal. Not much of a smell, but notes of roasted malts and herbs were noted. Taste was pretty good; flavors of malts, light coffee, and some nuts seemed to go together quite well. Mouthfeel was good, as the carbonation seemed to really keep the palate occupied. Decent drinkability. This is a deal at 4.99 a sixer at Trader Joe's. For that price, this beer is a recommended brew."
"Another budget Trader Joe's buy. Pours a dark color--almost black, with a slight tannish head. Pretty basic porter style appearance here. Smells of roasted malt, caramel and nut. Pretty full and pretty well balanced. Tastes rather bland for a porter. Roasted malt is notable, but not terribly strong. Hops are also part of the flavor, but there is nothing special at all here. Mouthfeel is not great. There is plenty of carbonation but no real substance on the tongue. A bit fizzy and watery, very surprising for the style. Overall, this beer isn't great and it isn't too bad either. Weak for my tastes. Average is probably a good way to describe it."
"This is a fairly drinkable beer due to the weaker flavor, especially if other porters tend to be too strong for you. General quality seems okay if not spectacular. Nothing is skunky or really off, just not really tasty when compared to some other really nice porters out there that only cost $2 more a 6 pack. If you are short a couple bucks, this will do in a pinch, otherwise go for a Deschutes, Black Butte."
"Its a drinkable ale..but is this really a porter?"
"Toad pours a dark brown, almost black in color. Fairly nice thick head, but leaves minimal lacing behind. Very nutty and roasty in the nose and the taste consists of the same qualities, but with a fairly strong bitter finish, almost like a brown ale or a ESB. Carbonation level is adequate, but overall it was a tad to bitter for me. Would have liked a bit more coffee and chocolate than that bitter beer face."
"This one pours a deep reddish brown with a very frothy, tan head that leaves lots of sticky lace. The aroma is very faint - nutty and a bit earthy. The taste is not bad, slightly bitter and slightly malty. Overall, this is not a bad session beer that could be sampled several times. It is pretty smooth and easily drinkable."
"It is drinkable but why would I ever want another one of these? Blah! Completely forgettable!"
"I poured out the last quarter of my glass."
"This is a decent stab at a american porter. It poured a nice deep brown color with a good brown head that left a good ammount of lace on my glass. The smell was kind of sweet but not in a good way. There were also traces of chocolate in there as well. The flavor was not bad at all, with a good hop bitterness to go along with the semi sweet chocolate flavor and roated malts. The mouthfeel was nice and sturdy and this beer was a suprise for sure. I don't know if I could drink a whole bunch of these in one sitting but a couple at a time would not hurt."
"Pours a murky dark brown, not quite as dark as a solid stout black. A medium-sized an head appears and then just as quickly, vanishes! The aroma is slightly sweet, roasty, malty, almost smoky. Flavor is almost amber-ale like- malty, sweetish, easy drinking with a slight hop bite at the back of the throat. A drinkable brew found at the local Trader Joe's- nothing exciting, nothing terrible."
"Pours a reddish brown with a good head that fades at an average rate. The smell is chocalatey and very malty. These aren't bad smells but they seem to be too dominating and any other smells that might be there are lost. It is smooth in the mouth and you do get a bit of that chocolate but a lot of the malt with not much aftertaste. This beer feels thicker than it is. Definitely a filling beer."
"Boring, dark brown clearish black body and nearly no head yo. Nose is wet and dank, with some piney spruce sharpness that reminded me of wet forest. Tastes are burnt and roasty. Seems to have the rudiments of the porter but woefully thin body and garish mineral carbon after really put the hurt on this one. Certainly below-average. If at TJs--avoid this!"
"got another bargin from trader joes .84 cents. poured ruby with a small off light tan head that stay around along time, with some good lacing. aroma, malts, molasses, some coffee. flavor weak malts ,coffee some sweetness with a touch of bitterness. not to bad for the price, will buy this one again."
"Drinkability was okay. It tasted decent and smelled fine but the feel was just not quite right for the style. I'm not sure what style this beer really is; it seemed awfully light for a porter, though. It might work as an entry-level beer to introduce someone to darker colored beers. Black Toad will certainly disabuse a neophyte of the notion of ""dark beer equals ""heavy"" beer. As for me, one will be enough, thanks."
"Overall: Another one of those odd-ball singles from Trader Joes that was a nice excursion but never a complete detour. Worth a try for the money and an interesting change of pace but it has to do a lot to get me to pick it up again. A little weird all told."
"I don't know about the nutty flavor, but is a dark chestnut color and there was a taste of roasted malts. Not to bad, but I would not purchase this ale again. This ale had a nutty, bitter/sour taste and that was the turn off!"
"Pours a thick, coarse head which quickly fades into a lasting 1/5 in. rim. Smells faintly like opening a box of Wheaties or some other multi-grain cold cereal. Taste begins with smooth chocolate with a touch of sweetness and ice coffee; burnt toast rounds out the finish with a surprising but not wholly unpleasant aftertaste of cigarettes in the mouth (not ashtray-ey, but approaching that). No bitterness at all, which I believe might strengthen this beer's profile. An easy drink, it's got a lighter body (cf. Guiness stouts) than most porters. Certainly a good beer, but there's too many porters in the English or American style that surpass Black Toad's modest presence."
"Easy to drink, but they could turn down the carbonation one notch."
"I wanted to like Black Toad but unlike burnt marshmallows this burnt product is not pallatable!"
"This is a very drinkable beverage. Good with food."
"($4.99 / 6 pack)"
"Overall, a decent beer, but nothing I'll look for again."
"Black Toad: A dark ale. Not too bad of a looking beer from Trader Joe’s, and a huge step up from the first one I sampled. Brownish-red, reddish-brown, with an off white head without much staying power. The taste was actually not half bad, strong coffee flavors, with a rolling taste of molasses at the end. And it did have a nutty flavor as well, particularly as it warmed up. Not bad, not great, but not bad."
"Another 77 cent Trader Joe's beer. This one actually was not too bad. Pours a very dark brown with an ultra-thin light beige head. Very little lacing. Aroma is lightly nutty and malty. Flavor is malty smooth with some hops and a nutty finish. All of these attributes are in small quantities though, and it was on the bland side overall. I think this is a weak attempt at a Schwarzbier."
"Notes: A solid beer to be had and at $4.99 a six pack it is a steal. Perhaps a beginners dark beer or a beer geeks session brew."
