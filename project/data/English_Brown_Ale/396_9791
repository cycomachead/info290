4.31,8.3,4,4.25,4.5,4,4.25,"This beer really surprised me.  I rarely drink a nut brown ale so I had this beer as part of a flight of 4 ounce tasters.  It looks spot on for an English Ale and has a good nutty smell.  The taste was the best I've ever had for the style.  It was nutty and malty in perfect balance.  A nice smooth finish and goes down really easily.","ELS","Mar 28, 2015"

Taste is lightly sweet with chewy biscuit caramelly malt, grains, soft bitterness, and flavors of malty bread, nuts, and again coffee and cocoa.

Probably the earthiest,smokiest and least sweet brown I've had to date. Small amount of sweet carmel,malt to start and finishes with a smoke or burnt steak kinda taste that lingers on the tongue.Color is a very dark brown that is still see-thru with a very slight amber hue in the light. Lacing very apparent. Flavor is very robust for only 5%. Low alcohol content is probably why the bottle describes the beer as "sessionable" I would agree with that, but only during cold weather months. If your a porter/stout person who doesn't like browns then this beer would probably be ok with you. Overall a quality beer.","dutesanch","May 27, 2014"

Medium-low hop character is present, mostly as bitterness with a little flavor, with the earthy notes and green bitterness blending harmoniously with the burnt sugar bitterness and the toffee flavors. Drying on the finish with a faint fruit note, moderate toast and burnt sugar flavors, this beer is medium-light in body, moderately carbonated, and excellent on the palate - so soft and creamy!

Poured at a good temperature with a nice, billowy, foamy, tan head that settled down after a bit to a light cover and a little lace. Color is a clear amber cherry with a couple of bubble trails. Aroma is malt, cocoa, old leather, tobacco. Flavor's slightly sweet, with a very good balance between that, bitter, and carbonic tang; also malt, cocoa, and a bit of roast. Body is just right, full, yet very drinkable and great carbonation. Finish is like flavor; session, and just plain very tasty stuff.","drpimento","Oct 20, 2012"

Some spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big caramel, biscuit, toffee, toast, nuttiness, chocolate, molasses, light dark fruit, and light herbal spiciness. Excellent aromas with great strength and balance. Taste of caramel, toast, biscuit, nuttiness, toffee, chocolate, light dark fruit, and light herbal. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, biscuit, toast, nuttiness, chocolate, and light herbal on the finish for a short bit. Nicely robust flavors with good balance; no cloying sweetness at all on the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and very smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming noticed on the finish; as expected of 5%. Overall this is an excellent brown ale. Nice robustness and balance of flavors; very smooth and easy to drink.

It's a nice type of beer for cooler style weather, a rainy day, or when you need a nice malty beer without a big profile and sweetness.

The smell seems a bit anemic, compared to the taste, imitating it without really advertising effectively.

Beatifull or maybe I've allready had too much! It's smell is like fire roasted nuts and a slight maltiness. Taste is similar to a smoked porter but lighter and there are definitely some nuts in there somewhere I just can't get to them. Light Carbonation and very dry this beer is very drinkable and I am sessionning it to my wifes dismay! Gotta love the Alesmilth guys and gals!!","Bricelyn","Apr 18, 2009"

I wasn't too impressed with the brown and usually, browns I dig. Nice color, smelled better than tasted. It did have some good nutty flavors and a mild hoppy finish, but that is what AleSmith strives for. Was hoping that it tasted as good as my olfactory sensed, but fell a little short. I would have it again but not in the top ranks of browns I love.","Lunchmade","Nov 21, 2008"

I get hints of roasted hazelnuts a bit of brown sugar and sweet malts. mothfeel is nice. decent amount of carbonation. very easy drink.

Smell is quite nutty and toasty, some caramel, biscuits, grain, light floral, not much going on, kind of subdued. Taste is similar, nuts and toast, light fruits, biscuits and bread, caramel, bit of floral hopping, not much again. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, smooth and easy enough to drink but not for exciting, even for a nut brown. Try it if you see it, but it didn't do much for me.","Viggo","Aug 01, 2008"

4.5,13.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer arrived a dark leatherly brown with shimmering hues of ruby red. The aroma is sweet, lots of toffee and some butterscotch. The taste is more of the same. Sweet upfront, then the toffee and butterscotch comes on in while a minor note of hops plays second fiddle. Unlike a number of American-made brown ales, this one hs an excellent balance between the malt and the hops. Just plain easy to drink, and I wish they bottled this brew.","DoubleJ","Jan 14, 2008"
4.07,2.3,3,3.5,4,4.5,5,"Had on-cask at Hamilton's. Brown like you would expect, with no head. Smells faintly of malt, caramel, and nuts. Taste is all about caramel and nuts. Excellent flavors. Mouthfeel is wonderful and creamy. This beer seems to really benefit from being served from a cask, as I've also had it on-tap and it wasn't quite as good. The other great aspect of this beer is the drinkability factor. It's low in alcohol and goes down incredibly easy. Definitely something you could drink all night.","throwitallaway","Jan 14, 2008"

3.7,-7,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Originally reviewed November 26, 2006. On tap at AleSmith. Liquour-like Frangelico-type aroma, with wafting alcohol notes on a tone of nutty toast and malt. Dry. Heavy brown pour, with a nice creamy froth. A light and refreshing taste, however bold with quality hazlenut and tawny pale fruits to combine for a nice quality in a brown ale. Touches of saltiness in the nutty character. Both drinkable and full of distinction, yet having nice balance. Something that makes this top considering the quality of the body.","CharlesDarwin","Aug 09, 2006"

Nothing in the scent department jumped out at me, but it had a nice nutty but not overwhelming taste. It's got a pretty long lingering aftertaste though that didn't agree with me. I could down a few of these in a sitting if there was nothing else I wanted to try.","JayTheFinn","Sep 18, 2005"

3.47,-12.8,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I could have sworn this was a porter. lots of burnt smell. coffee. dark brown appearance yet light on the palate. I didn't encounter the nuttiness I desired with this style. It was there but hidden deep in the brew. I hate to compare but the samuel smith variety stomps all over this in my opinion as it shares the nuttiness and has a high drinkability along with refreshing. The alesmith brewery is outstanding and this beer is recomended as it stretches the edge of a style. I liked the fluid body as it easily slid down to paydirt. I was so sure it was a porter I had the barkeep pour me a shot glass of it while I watched and sampled it....Yep..it was the right brew. Still good.","DogFood11","Beers"
4.28,7.5,4,3.5,5,4,4,"Taste is understated, simple, and perfect for the beer. Dancing the line between dry, sour malt and rich chocolate, this beer is smooth and doesn't have a single off taste. There's a nice chocolate nuttiness without being excessive, and it has a dry finish. Hops are unnoticable in this beer, which I suppose is true to style, though they never hurt.","freed","0"

4.68,17.6,5,4.5,5,4,4.5,"This beer rests in my glass with a thick tan head and a bright brown color. This beer has a subtle nutty aroma to it. There is a nice caramel malt sweetness here that is backed up by toasted malt flavors and a nuttiness that is found in the finish. This beer is packed with solid malt flavors that just jump out of my glass. This is one of the best Nut Brown ales that I have ever had, probably is the best. It is just so enjoyable and so well integrated.","Gueuzedude","Nov 22, 2003"
3.92,-1.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The beer as it spills for the keg into the appropriate container a transparent brown, the head prodigious in size and the texture spumous, the color a toothsome tan with the lace a thick and sticky sheet to obscure the glass. Nose is slightly floral, nice nutty malt sweetness, fresh and crisp with the start somewhat sweet, thickly malted and the top fair to middling in feel. Finish has a nice moderate carbonation and the hops pleasingly spicy as the beer warms to the room and the glass, quite dry and a decent drinking beer, certainly not the worst Brown Ale Ive tasted, but do like most all the other Alesmith beers better than this one, still worth a sample.","Gusler","Oct 06, 2003"
