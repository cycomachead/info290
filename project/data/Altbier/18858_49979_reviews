"A decent gulp with a mellow taste. From the 22 oz bottle purchased at the BC Liquor Store in Ladner."

"Enjoyed a few pints on tap at the Irish Times pub in Victoria, BC. A clear red-bronze amber beer with an inch or so of white head. Nose is quite fruity, almost evokes some banana along with mealy apples or pears, light molasses, vanilla, soap, and a characteristic noble hop floral note. The aroma was a tad estery for the style but pleasing enough. The style guidelines do translate quite well on the palate. This is a crisp, dry, bitter ale with some citrus, toasted caramel, and mineral notes. Very quenching and tart, with rather minimal sweetness (although I do get a hint of molasses kiss candy or perhaps saltwater taffy). Sourish crab apple, bitter orange peel, herbal bitters, and gooseberry flit in and out, is that some American hop in the form of faint grapefruit and pine? Fairly high carbonation and thin, well-attenuated body that reminds one of a lager. Finishes quite clean, with a refined bitterness and echoes of citrus and chalk. Really quite a wonderful alt even if the nose threw me off for a moment. Classic session brew that drinks well but manages to hold one's attention over the course of several pints."

"O/D - Huh? Such a weak beer for what I expected. Flavour wasn't great and the feel was thinner than it should've been. Tame best describes this one. You'd expect more hops for a West Coast take on the style."
"Would I buy it again? Nope. I'm surprised, I expected to like this more."

"Overall- An enjoyable altbier by Driftwood. There was a nice balance between the hops and malts, however, if there were something else that would give this brew a little more depth it would be even better."

"Overall: Straightforward and good but not as good as Parallel 49's."
""
"I think this was a good effort by Driftwood. They're local and stayed pretty true to the style, while adding their own twist. This is an easy drinking brew, a little light for some tastes, but it's well-made. That said, the criteria is- is it the world's finest microbrew Amber Ale? No. Still above average? Yes. I could see sharing this with some of my friends."

"Definately would buy again"

"Overall, a very tasty brew. As far as session beers go, this is absolutely fantastic."

"In the dark environment, the beer pours a deep brownish hue that seems clear with a nice tan head. Toasty munich malts with a spicy aroma come across the nose and the body delivers a wonderfully light malt body with slight hop notes. Well put together and subtle beer. Worth having again, so I ordered a second bottle to share."

"O: Interesting play of hops and malts, bitter and smooth. This brew is a delicate well managed balance. Try it with a a hard goat cheese and some dried figs, or a stewed red meat."
""
""

"O: A bit of a typical Brown Ale, with some german hints in the hop. Certainly a full flavour profile, but a little lacking in malt and mouthfeel."

"Poured into an Ommegang flute. Pours a nice coppery orange amber. Minimal head leaves a persistant ring around the glass with little lacing. Aroma of toasty, bready malt and grassy hops. Taste follows, with toasty bready malt and grassy, slightly pine hops and a bit of nuttiness. Finishes with a crisp hop bite. Light to medium bodied. Nicely made and refreshing. Good job."

"In all, an awesome ale. I'm glad I grabbed this one."
"O: Hopheads would enjoy the bitter pine hops in this amber ale."
"So-so Driftwood bottle. Perhaps too mellow for me. Cloudy amber colour with lots of white lace. Carbonation right there. Sourish and citrus. OK mouthfeel, passable drinkability.Fresh bottle from store that had a depth of Driftwood beers on display. Maybe without the acidicity."
"something I could session but I only have a single bottle and I need to thank Trevor for bringing me a box of BC goodies"
"A very clear copper with a thin off white head. Not alot on the nose other than a mild nuttyness and some grainy/herbal scents. Some sweet malty flavours and again a little nut and grass on the finish. Light body with a dry aftertaste and some good lacing. Driftwood is making better and better beer all the time. Their seasonals are fantastic, but this is just good, not great."
"Crooked Coast Amber Ale pours a deep orange copper with a fluffy offwhite head that leaves thick lacing on the glass. The aroma is malty, warm toasted bread with some herbal hops. The beer has a great malty flavor, without being too sweet. More bready, lightly toasted malt, with a bit of caramel and a solid but light to moderate hop bitterness. Some nice light spicy hop flavor balances the malt really nicely. As a hop head, I'd looked past this beer a lot previously, but I'm really glad I picked it up!"
"D - please with the hop presence in this amber, well balanced and easy to enjoy"
"D - A very tasty offering from Driftwood. These guys produce some solid beers and this is another quality example. Highly recommended to any fan of Amber ales offering some unique flavours."
"First beer of NYE 2010 and best drink of beer I've had all year. Pours with a honeycombed"" head like the interior of a crunchie bar. A malty driver with hops in the backseat. Caramel interior, smooth on the corners, full bodied after burner. A real treat."
"650mL bottle. Pours an amber color with a nice tan head that leaves plenty of lacing. Aroma of caramel malt and floral hops. The taste is malty with some light bitterness. Medium-light bodied with mild carbonation, quite smooth. Very easy to drink; this is a solid, enjoyable amber ale."
"Definitely will be having this again."
"D - very drinkable with an interesting mouthfeel"
"This beer pours a very nice looking copper orangey-red with a bubbly, two-finger head that leaves some very pretty lacing on my glass. Some really nice piney, citrusy hop aromas emanate from the foamy head with good hits of caramel, cinnamon, clove, and even light touch of orange-chocolate. Taste is buttery and bready up front with the citrusy hops coming in mid-sip resulting in a buttery and incredibly nutty, dry finish with slight hints of apricot too. Fantastically balanced, complex and smooth. Mouthfeel, again, is silky smooth with a good amount of creaminess and displays a crisp, dry, spicy finish from the hops. Wow, having tried the other offerings from this brewery, I was expecting to like this beer - I had no idea it would be so complex and well-balanced. This is an outstanding ale from an outstanding brewery. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who can get their hands on it. I know I`ll be buying it again. What a treat!"
"Pours a clear orange/amber, thick light tan head forms, slowly drops to a thin layer, some nice chunks of lace stick to the glass. Smell is nice, very malty, some toast, apricots, orange, nice and floral, some light fruit, caramel, lightly sugary, tea like hops, real nice. Taste is nice too, tea and lemons, orange, toast, caramel, apricots, touch of iron, quite fruity, dry and toasty in the finish, nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, very drinkable stuff. A real nice amber ale, thanks Eric!"
"While this is still a decent beer, I can't help but be disappointed. Driftwood is an amazing brewery, but this is my first miss from them. It seems to be missing the earthiness from an alt that helps balance out the fruit and bread, and I also feel like it needed a touch more hopping. Well worth a try, though. Cheers Eric for the bottle!"
"D: Interesting, but a little rough around the edges. I wonder if it would mellow with a little more cellaring."
"Mild cabonation and a smooth feel - a nice beer to enjoy with a meal."
"Fairly light body, goes down easy. Nothing really screams amazing to me (and I have grown to think that of some of Drifwood's brews) but it's quite drinkable and would make for a good summer switch-up. The flavors are quite unusual (to my palate) and a bit challenging but I feel that it is nice to see an unusual style and still have a quite drinkable beer."
