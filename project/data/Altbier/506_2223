Little to no head to speak of. The nose is the ""highlight"" of this beer with some nutty malt tones. The attack is initially clean and then the flavor follows like a mouthful of straw. It instantly made me think of a beer I had some years ago before I started reviewing called Bitburger. Some people like it, but I remember it for how much I did not. Grolsch amber ale conjured memories of that long ago brew. The tones and flavors in this Grolsch amber are nutty and straw-like.","Ragingbull","Jun 24, 2009"

It's not a hoppy beer at all. It goes down extremely smooth, it's a very good beer.","JamesS","Jan 29, 2008"

I picked up hints of citrus and yeast, plus earth tones but nothing too hoppy and no strong malt presence. The taste is different though, as the frontkick is drying and hoppy, but it passes over the tongue smoothly as there might be coffee or roast/burnt malt in there. For the price of the 6-pack it wasn't bad, and that aids its drinkability. It is just not complex/lacks depth that holds it back.","clayrock81","Jan 29, 2008"

On the palate, only slight bitterness that's identifiable as hops -- instead there's a medicinal quality to it, like it's chemically derived. Too sweet at the mid-palate and the finish.

3.16,-1.6,4,3,3,3,3.5,"A delicate and flavorful session beer; but maybe a bit dull in the end. Starts off with a brilliantly clear, abundantly carbonated deep golden / light copper hue, with a favorable foamstand that laced throughout. Aromas show a balance of malt and sparged grains with a mild noble hop (grassy) scent. Mild sulfers is the only deterant in the nose. Flavors also take on a nice malt / grain blend, albeit a bit strained. Sweetness takes on light toasty, biscuity, yeasty heartiness with light hints of caramel and powdered sugar. Sweetness is balanced by German hops, but don't offer much in the way of flavor. Feels light, nearly watery; thus finishing with a linger of grassy hops and mild grain-husk astringency. Fair beer that either needs to be flawless in it's style or gain a bit more intensity in flavor and feel to win beer-lovers over.","BEERchitect","Aug 28, 2007"

Clarity was great, 3 out of 5 on sweetness, light body, since it was bottled, I had no head :( Good carbonation, and of course you can reuse the bottle for home brewing (always a plus)","Symphonic","Aug 23, 2007"

I'm sorry, but calling this an Altbier is like taking the phrase ""Fine Pilsner"" on the ""Miller Lite"" label seriously. This is a watered-down, slightly hopped-up version of Newcastle Brown Ale. Medium brown/red (almost artificial-looking) color, slight head, lots of bubbles; smell is hops (even a bit of skunk?) and the taste is (like I said) a Newcastle clone. Nothing against Newcastle; but it is what it is. I was not impressed.

What was worse was that I couldn't feel the beer in my mouth at all. This critique might just be me, but I felt that I should have experienced a taste and experienced some sort of feel in my mouth, but none was givento me. This is why I wouldn't recommend this beer.

It's semi-sweet with a dry finish. It goes down easy with a smooth taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good amber ale.

Quite smooth malt flavor, very tasty. Hops provide solid bitterness, but there is something ""off"" about it. I can't quite put my finger on it, it's certainly not the skunkiness I've experienced with Grolsch lager. This is an altbier? If you say so.

3.13,-2.5,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"The best that I can say about Grolsch Amber is that it has no major faults. As noted above, I consider it to be a better beer than its more famous, green-labeled, swing-topped brother. Unfortunately, that's far from a ringing endorsement.","BuckeyeNation","Jan 02, 2005"
2.98,-7.2,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"Funny, before I became a BA (but after I started sampling better beers), this was one of my favorites. It was better in the swingtop bottle, which isn't available anywhere down here now. Now, this beer just tastes weak and thin. Overly sweet, with nothing really standing out. I like Grolsch lager (when I don't have a better option), but this is nowhere near as good as I remembered it a few years ago. How far I've come!","JohnnyDuvel","Nov 17, 2004"
3.85,19.9,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I'd never seen this one before a fellow BA brought it over for me to try. Pours a light amber color with a small head that dies off fast and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma is of sweet malt. Very little hops in the nose. The flavor is mostly comprised of biscuit malts with a slightly grassy hop. Seems slightly thin, but very good beer. This is a good session beer and much less skunky than the standard Grolsch.","clvand0","Nov 15, 2004"
3.53,10,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Bottle-clear: date coded for 1 year freshness dated...produced 4 months from the pour. Poured a clear copper tone with a nice 2 finger fluffy, sticky off white cap that has good retention (We are surprised) Aroma is understated: some musty malts grassy hops slight sourish tone like an alt. Body is smooth..silky, malt pronounced...nice departure of toasty nutty malts with the Hallertauer + Hersbrucker hops present but still in the background...finshes clean but mellow with the toasty malt after tase. This is a mellow altbier... the hops and carbonation are toned back to give it a flavorful nutty-malty taste...it hasnt the sharp edges a well hopped German alt has...its falvorful and quite drinkable I think its been underrated. Then again I may be biased I like Alts and this is a unique malty one.","pootz","Oct 25, 2004"
2.47,-23.1,4,2,2.5,2.5,2.5,"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a huge off-white bubbly head with good retention (even leaves mark after each sip on my glass which is quite good for macro-type beer. Aroma is only about malt, but its so weak that I would qualify this as neutral aroma. Taste is mildly refreshing with again malt being the only thing really noticeable. Overall lack of character does not make this beer very interesting.","Phyl21ca","Oct 22, 2004"
2.81,-12.5,3.5,2.5,3,3,2.5,"Foam city on amber and then some pleasant malt followed by metallic dry sweet astringant bitter aftertaste. Grassy thin/medium mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Canadians seem to like this, outside of Quebec. The type you drink cold on a hot summer day. Could do worse, signature grolsch definition.","Sammy","Sep 02, 2004"
3.03,-5.6,3,2.5,3,2.5,4,"I like this beer better than regular Grolsch. Color is ok, clear amber. Taste is roasted malt with a slightly metalic/chemical aftertaste. Hop profile is ok, but not great, over powered by the sligthly sweet malt. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but it does go down smooth. Imagine if Newcastle made a light beer. Although, I would wager the ABV is slighly lower than Grolsch lager.","zjungleist","Aug 29, 2004"
3.63,13.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Grolsch's amber ale is a decent beer that doesn't have any major flaws other than it's profound unremarkableness, if that's a word. It was one of my starter beers a few years ago and it would be a good one to use to introduce beer drinkers to the craft brew world. No complaints here.","Boilermaker88","Jan 15, 2004"
3.03,-5.6,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Malt profile took some thought to sort out. Some vague chocolate malt flavors and a smokeyness that waffled between a peat smoke and oxidation. In a blind tasting, I'd probably have tried to put this in some sort of Scottish category. A bit of brown sugar thrown in for good measure. Not bad, but at the same time there was not a lot that engaged me.","Brent","Nov 21, 2003"
2.82,-12.1,4,2,2.5,3,4,"Looks great with good head retention and lace. Smell is weak but all-malt. Flavor is very weak malt and a slight sharpness contributed by the wheat malt and hops.

2.04,-36.4,3,1.5,2,3,2,"Light amber color, medium white head. Aroma is grainy and malty and sweet. Lighter bodied altbier. Lightly hopped, medium malts, slightly sweet. Mild flavor. Finish is clean.

3.25,1.2,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Poured a clear reddish brown hue under a thick tan head with lots of contour. The head stuck around a long time, and left outstanding lace all the way down the glass. The nose was very malty, while the mouth was sweet and prickly. The taste was a bit on the watery side, with largely malty tones, followed by a decent hoppy bitterness. The aftertaste was mainly hoppy and quite pleasant. Despite the price, I liked it enough to have another.","Globetrotter","Jul 21, 2003"
3.72,15.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Clear deep amber color with a minimal head that skims the top of the glass but that forms nice and delicate lace. Sweet aroma, sub-caramel and more like dark brown sugar with some sense of straw. Bready and biscuity malt profile, less carbonation than the Lager. Hops are slightly metallic, somewhat grassy, and are early-comers to the flavor profile. Finishes fairly clean with some tart apple impression. Not bad, Alts rarely are super memorable for me but this is a quaffable beer.","ADR","Jun 02, 2003"
2.26,-29.6,3,2,2,2,3,"The beers color on the pour a burnished copper with a massive head that is frothy in texture and a light tan color as it evaporates the lace forms an adequate covering upon the glass. Nose is malt, clean and fresh, start is sweet, lots of malt, top cadaverous, finish is lightly acidic, lightly hopped, dry aftertaste, a Benign beer, and one that I suppose is suitable for a summer cookout, as it does Wet Your Whistle!","Gusler","May 23, 2003"

A clear brown beer with nice bubbly white head. Smell is slightly skunky and somewhat flowery. Taste is crisp & mellow with a slight maltiness. Very easy to drink and a good easy on the wallet session brew. There's really not much bad to say about this beer, yet nothing stands out either besides the trademark holland skunk factor. A decent beer,and for the price it's hard to beat.","avylover","Apr 27, 2003"
3.18,-0.9,3,2.5,3.5,3,3.5,"I bought myself a Grolsch sampler pack and encountered this beer for the first time. Overall, this seems much more like Bass than regular Grolsch. This beer isn't quite as good as Bass, but its still pretty good. The taste is a little thin, with the alcohol taste quite noticable for an import. As I said, I bought this beer in a sampler pack. Its not very common, and not really worth going out of your way to find. Bass is better. However, Grolsch Amber Ale is pretty good. Drink it if you have it.","WMBierguy","Apr 25, 2003"
3.04,-5.3,4,2.5,3,4,3,"I know I've had better samples of this beer in the past, but if they insist on selling it in clear bottles then they will have to live with the consequences. I'll give this beer high credits for a very attractive beer. Nice frothy head with great stamina, attractive amber colors with hues of brown, and light red. Clear. But because I think my bottle was old both the aroma and flavor were flat and dead. Each had a malty quality that wasn't necessarily unpleasant, just dead. The other area for credit was the very soft mouthfeel. In fact that is what made the bottle worth finishing. Maybe if I have a fresher bottle sometime I'll update this and give it the credit it may deserve.","garymuchow","Apr 17, 2003"
4.23,31.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Deep and clear dark amber color with a large cream-colored head that retains quite well. Carbonation is moderate; the excellent lace leaves prominent rings in the glass. Aroma consists of dark and bready malt with hints of brown sugar, quite pleasing. Taste begins with solid bready malt notes, reminiscent of home-baked dark bread. Finishes dry with substantial mild hops and dark fruit notes. The mouth feel is creamy and smooth. This is an unflaggingly excellent beer that I will assuredly buy again.","Pegasus","Mar 26, 2003"
4.28,33.3,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A very nice surprise, I am quietly highly impressed by this very drinkable beer. And all for just 80 cents. Not bad. I would buy this again for sure; well as soon as they start to sell it in the new ""Single Women Aisle"" anyways  LOL.","TheLongBeachBum","Jan 17, 2003"
3.56,10.9,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Darkish reddish-brown (amber), off-white head, no real depth or staying power but it did produce waves of lace. Clean nose, hints of malt and grain. A solid dollop of malt hits your tastebuds, a faint hint of roastedness. Medium body, good consistency. Not complex yet very enjoyable pleasing. Clear bottles scare me but I reckon this would make a very good session beer. Try it, recommended.","bditty187","Dec 23, 2002"
4.15,29.3,4,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,"Pours with a ""thick"" sound as the dense, creamy, off-white head develops.  The head lasts a good while, leaving a coating of heavy lace on the glass.  The beer is more of a dark amber/mahogany.  The aroma is sweet and very malty, yet clean.  There is a component that is very inviting, yet I can't quite place it.  The flavors are many, including roasted malt, chocolate, and a hint of fruit (I want ot say pears, but that just seems weird).  The alcohol is apparent in the taste, but in a good way.  It has a rather creamy mouthfeel that really caught me off guard.   The hops are barely evident, but are present in the finish (and perhaps are the source of the inviting aroma).  Perhaps one of the more flavorful ales I've tried, and an excellent beer that I will definitely purchase again.   Much better than the lager, which is a good beer.","aaronh","Oct 10, 2002"
3.6,12.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3,"Rich copper to brown in color, nice fluffy head that hangs in there for a while. Coarse lace down the side of the glass. The nose was of malt, caramel, and noble hops. The malt was the only one that realy stood out, though. Roasted grains really came through in the flavor, along with a tiny bit of bittering hops. Also, there was a dose of nice, mouth warming alcohol, though the abv is most likely normal. THere may have been a little metallic taste as well. THere was nothing special about the mouthfeel, very average in every regard. Grolsch Lager is one of my favorite beers, mostly for sentimental reasons, and this Amber Ale carries the name well. Much better then that god aweful Blonde crap (that had the same dirty cap problem).","yen157","Sep 26, 2002"

This beer went very well with my roasted turkey sandwich on fresh white bread with mayo and Tuong Ot Toi Viet-Nam Chili garlic sauce and so did the second one.  Very smooth, very drinkable, well rounded beer.","ThreePistols","Aug 29, 2002"
4.1,27.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours into the glass with a nice long lasting rocky white head. Great tea-colored liquid, smells a bit of new mown hay with a light malt aroma. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, due to the addition of wheat malt, with some sweet malt flavors creeping in. Finishes sweet too, with just a hint of hop bitterness. Overall smooth and very drinkable...love the clear bottle/cool label presentation too.","beerluvr","May 18, 2002"
3.56,10.9,4,3,3.5,4,4,"Notes: We can all assume this is an Altbier or something close to it, I dare not say “German” or I might offend. It’s much further away from American or English styles so that is what they must have been going for. Who really cares right?

3.48,8.4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Light amber color w/ a decent head.  Clear w/ no chill haze.  Slight toasty munich and caramel malt dominate the aroma. Subdued floral hop nose.  The aroma is all around clean and unassertive.  Light body, with a smooth and agreeable mouthfeel.  Hop bitterness is fairly low and leaves the beer w/ a slight residual sweetness that isn't overbearing.  No surprises in flavor in this brew.  Innocuous, quaffable and MUCH better than Grolsch in the green bottle.  A pleasant surprise.","marc77","Apr 22, 2002"

Clean and crisp.  Leaves with a distinct roasted after-flavor.  This is a really good brew.  Very similar to regular grolsch lager.  Not what I'd label as a true premium beer, and not entirely lame and boring like Budmillercoorsweiser.  This would be great on a hot summers day.","Jordan","Dec 06, 2001"
