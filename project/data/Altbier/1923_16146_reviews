"Hop bitterness plays with bitterness from the roast in the malts to create a dark, toasty, puckering brew with a beautiful sticky head and lacing. Some toasty grains and husks are present as well amid a subtle, but warm, earthy backdrop. Medium light body surprises the senses.  Dry finish."

"Pretty easy drinker and I love the swing tops their beers come in. Worth more purchases."
""
""
"Grainy sweet bready malt and light fruit. Decent beer but not my favorite style."
""
"Dry, easy finish for a simple but well-crafted beer that will please your sweet tooth but has just enough balance to not tire you out."

"Great swing top bottle!"
""

"Overall: definitely something different. As far as altbier goes, Sticke is certainly out of the box. More like a doppelbock than a kolsch. Definitely worth trying if you are looking for something big and different but still balanced."
"D- This is my first alt, but definitely enjoyed it. Easy drinking."
""
""
"I honestly had no idea what to expect with this one. I picked it up on a whim, so my expectations were low/absent. What I came away with was a very intriguing brew: complex and musty and quite enjoyable. Very glad I stumbled across this one."
"The best of this style that I've tried, though I have not tried many."
""
""
"A very pleasing alt, something I will buy again."
""
"This beer is pristine and wonderful. It is brewed with care and expertly in accord with the purity laws of 1516. A masterpiece waiting to delight you with it's malt richness, with the bounty of the hop flower,clean and crisp as much from malt as from carbonation. Excellent!"

"Probably my all time favorite alt, Uerige Sticke has just a little more complexity than the other (nearly equally fine) examples from Uerige."
""
""
"This pours a muddy brown color with a slight beige head. The aroma is slightly malty but that’s about it. It has a very interesting malt flavor to it. There are hints of caramel as well as a little sourness. Lot of unique, hard to describe flavors to describe, but interesting never-the-less."
""

""
""
"O: Delicious. I would get this again, quite tasty, enjoyable, and drinkable."
"Awesome! Sweet and rich but with a sweeping dryness. Spicy hops really showed up to combat the deep dark bready malts. I loved the sweet nutty caramel malt seemed sweet but actually was not. Almost like tricking your brain. Great layering effects and a standout brew for sure."

"I'll admit, of all the beers I have had over the years, traditional German altbiers are not my strong point. I tend to skew towards domestics, and altbiers are one of the few styles that do not seem to be prevalent in my area. So, in order to review this beer, I can't really compare it to other altbiers off the top of my head, but overall, Uerige Sticke stands it's ground as a solid ale! Unlike other brown ales, this altbier isn't overcome with molasses and caramel flavors, this has a more fruity flavor with a hint of smokiness. When poured, the head is lush, and when you take a sip, the suds stick to the liquid, giving a generous, aerated sipping quality that is quite refreshing. After you swish around the lovely flavor and swallow, the aftertaste maintains the essence of the beer itself, with no degradaton. A very tasty experience!"
"O- A very weird beer. Certainly different from what you expect from an altbier."

"Delicious & worth the price tag."

"Great beer, I just found grace in Altbiers just after dinking the Uerige. Flavorful, hoppy with good drinkability."

"O- Altbiers are a classic. Beers that you drink with ease, like all germans, but in that case with their own flavours and peculiarities. This one is the perfect representation of the style. Great drinkabilty, complexity and balance"
""
"O - My first proper German Alt, and I was blown away. Touched on some of the same things I love about Scotch Ales. I'm sure there are plenty other great ones out there, but there aren't a whole lot available from what I could see, and the couple American versions I've had were much more like standard American Amber Ales. I'll definitely be seeking out more like this and would get this one again in a heartbeat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"overall; a higher alchol version of the original, all in all, one of the best!"
"O: I haven't had many altbiers, so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I would describe it as a moderately-hoppy brown ale. Well constructed and balanced, I'd also like to try this again with less age on it."
""
""
"o: Tasty, but I preferred the sticke version."
""
""
""
""
"O: I did not much enjoy this beer. Not recommended. I'd be open to trying a younger bottle far in the future though."
""
"There's a reason English Ales, not German beers, have inspired the craft brew revolution. I wish these guys would do more with the little piece of history they've got."
""
""
""
"This is a surprisingly easy going beer which could pair well with lunch or a relaxing afternoon."
"O: After visiting Dusseldorf about 2 years ago, I became a huge fan of altbier. I really enjoy most of the German offerings I have had though the experience in Dusseldorf makes it so mush more enjoyable (fresh from the casks and with the waiters walking around with continuous fresh glasses, marking the coaster to indicate how many you consumed). This beer is highly sessionable and quite enjoyable - the flavors complement fall/winter foods really well."
"The body was a little lighter than expected, but still good. The beer was nicely carbonated and pretty easy to drink. Overall, a good beer and one that I can appreciate."
""
"Overall I was staidly dissapointed with this compared to the doppel- stickle version from this brewery. Aromas were quite inviting albeit mellow but the flavor profile was just flat; like the brewer forgot an ingredient or something. Not something I plan to revisit and not recommended. Search out the purple label, pass on this lighter, watered down version (not literally, but that's how it tastes)."
"Poured a deep orange brown, darker than the Classic Altbier. Still an off-white head nonetheless, a think collar, some spotty lace and a thin film of retention. Nose is much hoppier than the Classic Altbier, with only a fraction of the dark fruit notes. More more bread, spicy and herbal hop notes. Taste still has a bit of the fruit as well, but still less prominent than the Classic. A bit of bread and spicy, herbal German hop notes. Lengthy bitter and drying finish. Medium feel and low carbonation. More bitter than the Classic Altbier, and a tad more enjoyable."
""
"Body is decidedly medium, with a high enough level of carbonation to let itself be felt, but not painful. Dry throughout, maybe from tannins, which could explain the constant bitter cacao aromas and tastes I was picking up on. Result is a fairly crisp beer that's very dry in the finish."
""

""

"Ueridge Sticke is quite a good altbier. It's good enough that I will probably try their other offerings (which are almost all alts)."
""
""
""
"overall: Its a quality beer that everyone should appreciate"
"Just lighter than mid bodied. Nicely carbonated. Drinks well. The slightly more sessionable version of the Dopple sticke."
"Overall- a very enjoyable beer nothing to crazy jumping out at you which on most days is very enjoyable, would buy again, really nice packaging as well, will reuse the bottle for sure."
"D: fantastically flavorful and drinkable. this is my first alt reviewed and it is interesting to think this is the slightly beefier version from Uerige. it would be neat to try the classic, sticke, and doppel side by side. overall, very enjoyable brew."
"Poured at ChurchKey in DC. Dark amber, hazy, average and mostly diminishing light brown head. Moderate malty and caramel sweetish aroma, some roastiness and hoppyness, light alcohol. Body is average, malty and sweetish flavor, some caramel and alcohol. Finish is average, malty and lightly sweetish, some alcohol and light caramel. Nice hoppy aroma, but flavor lacks the hoppyness – quite a lot of sweet malty alcohol in the flavor/finish."
"I picked this up randomly knowing nothing about what was in the bottle, and I was rather pleased. Loads of complexity for the lighter alcohol. Overall, not sure if I'd buy it again, but you can definitely taste the tradition and nationality of the style. It's really the type of beer I'd love to have at a festival in the beer's home city."
"Overall alright but I prefer their doppel more. Enjoyable could have again no problem."
"Good, and interesting. Kind of light and refreshing, but with some flavors that would be more expected in a heavy malty beer. I like it in its imported bottle, but it tastes to me like it would be really fantastic to have fresh."
"Pours a fairly-hazy dark tawny-mahogany with a thick off-white head that lasts for awhile and leaves quite a bit of lacing behind. The nose brings forward a good amount of bread crust and some earthy hops. Dry malt and a slight bit of roast. The flavor brings some light malty toasted character and some bread crust. Along with that, there's some earthy hops and an accompanying dryness. Light caramel character in there as it warms more, though the earthy hops really begin to take over, especially with the bitterness in the finish. Medium body and lighter carbonation. Really nice example of the style."
"This brew poured out a bit darker than I thought it would. The color was a clear dark brown with a minimal head on top. The smell of this beer to me was giving me the thoughts of grape wine. The taste had some good malt flavors in there. The mouthfeel was pretty smooth and light. Overall this beer was interesting in it own way. I liked it enough to try it again one day."
"O- A great beer, represents the style very well, definitely worth a try, especially as its one of the few altbiers you can easily get a hold of in the States."
"This is an enjoyable amber ale, and the hops and bitterness make it interesting."
"O-A very nice altbier. Worth trying."
"Poured from bottle with a nice head that quickly disappeared. Nice copper color with a sweet malt, syrup aroma. Taste is sweet with a dry peppery finish. Not very bitter, the malt flavor is dominant right up front. A nice beer. Very unique bottle. Worth a second round."
"Nice beer and a unique style."
"D- The Uerige alts are definitely have more of a hop presence and the Sticke is no different. Delicious and moreish."
"O - Altbiers are delicious."
"I have to compare this to another bottle with a different code."
"Overall I love this beer. This version bring just that extra touch of robustness to the style that makes it a beer that is both satisfying and complex, worthy of the price it carries compared to other domestic craft altbiers."
"On the take-home scale I would rate this as a six pack. Not your everyday beer unless you are a German beer kinda person."
"I don't know how to spell this comes into the glass a nice bark brown with some faded orange towards the side. A nice amount of cream colored foam about an inch up leaves no stick on the glass. Smell is fruity apple a nice caramel scent and that's about it, it's an alt. Taste is very fruity but tamer than a BSDA which this reminds me of, only extremely lighter. Never had a ALT this fruity that's all. Caramel comes up too with a faint earthy hop in the middle, no trace of the 6%. Feel is medium, carb is there but not felt under the body. I could drink a shit ton of this and like it, one of the better German beers i've had, glad I scooped it up.."
"Well worth it."
"I went to Das Bierhaus in Btown and some cool guy I made friends with bought me one of these for the first time. Out of the flip-top bottle this beer was a clear, copper/brown color with one finger of head. The retention was good and the lacing consistent down my glass. The aroma was a complex mix of malts, caramel, rum, some wood and nuts as well as some golden raisin. The flavors were not quite as pronounced as the aroma for me but the balance was ideal. Caramel, burnt caramel, nuts, earth and then a kick of piney hops to finish it. Very, very drinkable assuaged by the quick, clean finish of an otherwise very malty beer. The body was medium and the carbonation average as well which also encouraged quaffing. Impresive."
"Overall this was a simple yet very good beer and one that to me seems like a standard-bearer for the style. Well worth a shot if you see it around."
"Pours a clear, brown color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of dry hops, pale malt, hint of grain, slight earthy malt, hint of caramel, and hint of roasted malt. Fits the style of an Altbier. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, earthy malt, slight pale malt, slight roasted malt, slight dry hop, and hint of grain. Overall, good appearance, aroma, and body."
"Prost!"
"D: A very good altbier, highly recommended."
"D: A solidly made, drinkable beer."
"Rusty muddy brownish red pour has some off-white head that disappears pretty quick. Aroma is nice, thick and dry, very musty, while the taste has a lot of dark fruit, prunes, plum and dates with a biscuity malt character, like toasted bread. Finishes very dry and with some bitterness, though the beer is nevr that sweet to begin with. A big tasting brew that is not all that strong in alcohol. Probably the standard-bearer for this brew as the Dopplesticke is a lot different (and stronger), more akin to a barley wine."
"D: is good with balanced flavors and a nice change to try a new style. although price is a tad high for a 11.2oz bottle about $4."
"Dominant aroma of noble hops (predominantly floral and spicy in character) is underlain by sweet, toasty, nutty malts and faint esters of plum. Assertive hoppy bitterness (with notes of citrus rind) prevails over the sweet, toasty malts. Slightly astringent with semi dry, bittersweet nutty finish.Medium bodied, with moderate carb, goes down very smoothly. Good, but not as pleasing as its more potent Doppelsticke brother."
"D: The beer is very easy to drink and is quite sessionable."
"Big thanks to dyan for this extra in trade! Bottled on 10.08; Code 09.09. Served from bottle into a Grolsch kolsch. Pours a light brown that turns to brown as you go up the glass with a two finger off-white head that remained throughout. Maintained nice lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt, grain, and subtle caramel. The flavor was of malt, grain, citrus, spices, and subtle caramel. It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a very nice brew. It was amazingly smoother than I thought it would be by the appearance. Had a very nice balanced and complex flavor to go along with it. Definitely glad I got to try this one."
"Taste is malty sweet and rich. It's very sharp an creamy and really drinkable. It's got a nice creamy taste it's a very solid beer."
"D- can session plenty of these a delicious brew"
"On tap at Gourmet Haus Staudt, served in a 0.2L Uerige glass. Burnished copper with pale amber highlights, hazy toward the center. Highly effervescent with outstanding head retention and lacing, this looks pretty inviting. The aroma has a lot of depth, opening with berry-like fruitiness, leafy and earthy hops, toasted malt. As it warms I can pick out subtle notes of mineral and soil. The palate shares the same berry-like character that I detect in the aroma, but it's also aggressively hoppy. Malty, lightly toasted but quite dry, hops take over mid-palate and leave a lingering bitterness that suggests citrus rind, bitter herbs, earth and minerals. It's hard to wrap my mind around this beer, but I enjoy it more each time I try it."
"Impression: When this is available next I am getting a case, suggest you do the same."
"Only issue I had with this is I felt it was over carbed, which removed some of the deep maltiness I really like in sticke's, decent beer however."
"D: One of the classics of the style and quite an nice beer for my palate."
"Overall, this is quite a good beer. Were it not for the label I would have pegged it as a slightly strong English brown ale by appearance and flavor. This bottle was a gusher probably due to mishandling so I will try to seek out another and update my review."
"Very, very drinkable and pleased I've at last had one of these famous beers. I've drank at the brewhouse a few times, but many years ago and sadly never when the 'Stike' was on."
"This was a great beer. Great amber almost cherry wood color to the beer. Had a great head in the beginning but quickly faded to a thin film. Lacing was very evident and great throughout. Taste was perfect for an Alt with little alcohol flavor. Would want many more!!!"
"drinkability: solid beer and it was cool to try a beer like that on tap. Thanks KB"
"D - Drinkable and well made, this is a simple and sessionable brew. I could definitely drink a few of these, but not at the import prices that one tends to find them at. A good beer, but probably best in Dusseldorf."
"I wasn't as wowed with this as I hoped I would be for a German top 25 beer, but it is a nice drinker, and I'd be happy to have a few more."
"D: A decent drinker."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a Unibroue tulip. Thick head last for a moment before fading into a thin sheet of foam. Aroma is of raisins mainly with some other dark fruit aromas and sweet malts. Tongue is thoroughly coated with the sticky flavors of this wonderful brew. Taste is also mainly raisins, some hops and sweet malts upon warming. A really tasty treat, an obvious perfect interpretation of the altbier style, with no alcohol noted upon tasting whatsoever."
"The flavor is of toasted malts, baked bread, a slight spiciness, a low level of bitterness, walnuts, and almonds. Chocolate is noticeable, but subtle, and there's a dash of sweetness midpalate that is quickly consumed. The dry finish is of baked bread, toasted malt, and a dash of chocolate. The carbonation is high and the mouthfeel is dry. A delicious and drinkable German beer."
"Feel is good, solid, but not oily"
"This beer opens with a loud ""pop"" and pours a cloudy mahogany color with a two finger off white head with good retention. Aromas of caramel and stone fruit with a hint of spice. Malty caramel and biscuit flavors, raisin and a little smoke. There is a creamy mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation. Well balanced, easy drinking. I could drink a number of these in one session without getting bored or overpowered in any way."
"Beer is medium bodied, I don't know why I was expecting a thinner beer but I know when I'm wrong, the mouthfeel was good and the drinkability is high. I would recommend this beer to other beeradvocates."
"A good beer, but a bit hard to find and expensive in the states."
"Brownish amber with a gorgeous off-white head with excellent retention and lace. Holding it against the light reveals reddish amber highlights. The nose is excellent. Mildly nutty and malty with mild brown sugar, what strikes me, though, is the hop character. It's just so fresh! Earthy and mildly lemon-like in character with a touch of fresh-cut grass. Deep caramel malt character is present, with honey contrasting well against the hops. On the palate, it opens with a firm hop bitterness, very grassy in nature. Surprisingly bitter. Malt character is deep, with mild brown sugar, honey and jaggery, while remaining very light on the palate. Finishes dry and bitter with a mild sweetness. Carbonation is moderate, and more than ample. There's so much flavor in such a low ABV beer, this is thoroughly enjoyable."
"MF&D - for a beer that is to have a medium body, i think this one is a bit too light. carbonation is moderate, but serves nothing to enhance the size of the body. either way, the drinkability is superb, could have many more rounds of this guy."
"D - Excellent beer in its class, enough to differentiate it from other German brews but stays true and pure."
"A decent example of the style that is authentic and easy to drink. No hop or malt overload here. Just plain good 'ol altbier. Check it out."
"BJCP suggests this be entered as a specialty ale, but it isn't particularly special really. A bit more assertive and complex than a ""regular"" altbier, but only just. I may revise this review if I find a fresher bottle. Looking forward to comparing to the Doppelsticke next."
"Had a goblet for $7 at Sunswick 35/35 in Astoria. Definitely an interesting beer. It was fruity, but clean like more German ale, none of that Belgian spice. It started with a beery mix of cherry, strawberry, and date followed by dry lightly roasted malts and a grassy hop finish. Quite a nice beer. Drinkable and good change of pace. Give it a try."
"Really more like a bock than an alt. Color is a deep mahogany color with small beige head. Aroma was slighly sherry llike with big raisen notes. Flavor was very sweet with malt caramel and more raisins. Not crisp and bitter like an altr is supposed to be but then again it really is miscatorgorized as an alt. Had medium carbonation and body. A nice beer but not an alt."
"pour is copper with a bit of a hazy to it. rather small head of an off white color. smell is mild and crisp but complex. apples, caramel, smoked malt, and some chocolate. the taste has all those well blended and smooth with a nice but not overpowering caramel note with a smokeiness on the side of mild acidic. very light leather finish. mild bitter. really fantastic. not a dense sweet and not heavy on the stomach at all. will definitely have many times to come."
"This beer pours a murky amber-brown color. The head is a firm inch of foam that just sits there. The aroma is of caramel, hints of spice and dark fruit. The taste is fruitier, spicier and more bitter than the aroma. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a fine altbier that I would love to drink again."
"this is such an easy and GREAT beer. this is an every day sipper, no matter what season. rather low ABV in general so this is great."
"D: I found myself really sipping and savoring this beer. It may have been because I had such a small pour and I wanted to explore it, or I was just enjoying it that much. It absolutely wasn't because it was difficult to drink. This is a mighty smooth beer and it really challenges the palate in a good way. Lots of things going on in here and this was an absolutely great experience. I look forward to exploring this brewery's other offerings and just exploring Alts in general."
"Quite drinkable, very nice but a little sweet for my taste. I prefer the Uerige standard over this special version but both are quite good."
"This is nothing like what I thought it would be, but I was really surprised. Really glad that I picked one of these beers up."
"This is a great altbier, wish more american breweries tried this style. The Uerige Sticke would be a good one to emulate."
"D - Very drinkable - medium ABV, nice flavor, refreshing. Excellent German session brew - wish we got more Altbiers."
"O: An interesting beer. I had never tried the style and since my company is based in Dusseldorf figured I'd give it a shot. Surprised by the hop bitterness, but not a bad beer. Interesting bottle to say the least."
"Very decent, especially with a little warmth on it. Nothing I seek out every day (the style in general) but not a bad example at all."
"Drinkability: Barley flavor is too overwhelming, and alcohol asserts itself too much to make this too drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with some nice carbonation."
"Sweet 11.2 oz. longneck swingtop, bottled on 27.10 (2007 I'm presuming - consumed 4/7/08). The website labels it as 6.5% and says that it's dry-hopped in the maturation tanks. The beer is a highly-sedimented medium copper with ample carbonation, topped with a two-finger tannish head that slowly recedes to a creamy cover, leaving tons of lacing on the glass. Very earthy in the nose, with perfumy/green hops and a roasted malt backing. Nice roasted and caramel malts on the palate, a little chewy, with a complex, fairly bitter hop profile that contributes perfumy/floral/leafy notes and lots of lingering oils. It has a well-carbonated, medium body that imparts a dry, fairly long finish. I love these hoppy and malty sticke alts - delicious, interesting, and unique - and Uerige makes the best stickes I've come across. I will always gladly come back for another one."
"I'm damn impressed with Uerige Sticke. It's my first experience with the beer and it's left a lasting impression. The nose could use a tad more strength, but otherwise, it's very impressive. There's a ton of flavor crammed into this bottle and it's well worth the experience. Definitely one to check out."
"The look of the beer is Brownish/amber almost Carmel color vary hazy that gives it a thick look, frothy, creamy white head that dissipates fairly fast. I could smell that fruity goodness when my glass was put on the table, once I stuck my nose in the glass I was hit with lots of sweet malt aroma. The fragrance of this beer is pleasurable. Taste is malt right up front balanced nicely by hops. I would call this is an easy, smooth drinking beer, and would use the word mild but that would not do it justice. The mouth feel is medium with a crisp finish. Once again the hop and malt balance is almost perfect. Good lacing down the glass. I am defiantly recommending this beer to everybody if you can find it order it you won't be disappointed."
"D--Great German Alt. No off import flavors. Great representation of the style."
"Too bad more German Altbiers are so hard to find around here..."
"I've enjoyed the real alts I've had, but I can't say I'm an expert on the style - there dosen't seem to be many german alts available and I'm not sure the micros are true to form. Of course I liked it."
"D - I can see how this is considered the ""classic"" example of the style by people. Really easy to drink."
"Overall, goes down smoothly. Mouth is left slightly numb by the active carbonation and the generally strong taste. I was expecting a sweeter taste though judging by the smell."
"Very interesting beer and one of my top rated active bottled beers for the Altbier style."
"Into a stange it goes, the beer is murky brown with hues of a faded orange and tan glow. Not particularly pretty but this is expected for the style. Solid head retention. Super sweet in the nose, very malty sweet with a kick of hop leaf. Taste...it doesn't jump out on you, it's more powdery. Somewhat hoppy with a burnt bread crust flavor, it's nutty also. Dry aftertaste with a burnt bread sensation, and somewhat astringent. A little dissapointing, though I do have to say it drinks easy like most beers of it's nationality, especially with a bowl of steak and potato soup."
"I could go on and on about this beer, but suffice it to say that this is in the top 3 of the best beers I have ever tasted. If you can find it, drink it!"
"Minimal liight tannish head that dissipates quickly. Nice amber brown hue. Fruity and toffee is the aroma that stands out. Medium sweetness that is balanced nicely with medium bitterness. Full body with a nice creamy texture. Somewhat long bitterness in the finish."
"Excited to try any beer that basically invents the style. One of the original Sticke Alts and after a few sips, still among the best. The beer begins with a bright, rust color with a froathy foamstand that raises to about an inch and disipates slowly through the session. Moderate caramel aromas swirl about a pungent grassy, fresh hop scent that promises a more hoppy Alt than most I've had. Flavors are more dry and better attenuated than the nose suggests. The beer has some low-lying sweetness but stronger caramel flavors. Cracker-like and lightly biscuit-like. The hops are quite strong and balances the beer beautifully. A firm bitterness hangs in the back of the throat while giving a firm floral, spicy, German hop, herbal-grassy flavor. Super crisp and dry in the body; the beer basically evaporates in the mouth. Finishes with a balanced caramel / hop blend that lingers well into the finish. A very drinkable, sessionable beer. Thanks again Clvand0."
"Pours a very murky brown in color. Very little head on the pour. Only a ring of froth around the edges. Smell is very caramel and port like. Age has done this beer wonders. Very creamy and very dark malts. Plenty of aged sherry like port in the flavor. This was a huge surprise. Very well done."
"Very tasty beer. Not as good as the Doppelsticke, but certainly worthy of a taste."
"Pours a murky chestnut with a thin swirly head and some spotty lacing. Smells of fresh grain, spicy malt, a touch of minerality, and a touch of sweetness. Nice flavor that are a bit spicy to start and then quite mellow. The spice picks up again at the finish. There are some nice cocoa and slightly sweet malt notes as well and a smooth graininess throughout. Smooth, creamy, and a bit spicy in the mouth. Very enjoyable."
"D- Everything about this beer was pretty interesting from the bottle to the look of the brew. It was good and I really enjoyed it."
"D - Just waiting to get the glass"
"Medium-bodied - very drinkable. Well balanced between caramel sweetness and hop bitterness. Another deserved world classic. Hoppier than their other altbier or their Doppelsticke. A must-try for beer lovers!"
"Overall, nothing hugely complex or mindblowing here. But Wow is it tasty and drinkable!"
"This ones a little over-the-top in alcohol for a Dusseldorf Altbier. Never the less - good balance and well paired german malts and hops. I don't have another bottle but if I did, I would pass up. In Dusseldorf these are frequently session beers and I'm just not picturing this with the same level of drinkability."
"Tasted on 6/26/08."
"A bit sweet overall, but very flavorful."
"If most german beers are lagers and rest of those are ales and most of those are wiessbiers what do you have left? This delicious beer of course."
"Overall, recommended, although not as enjoyable to me as the doppel sticke."
"Recommended..."
"Well, this is my first experience with German Alt, and I'm impressed. This, being a Sticke Alt, is a bit high in alcohol to be a session beer, but it's very flavorful and drinkable enough for seconds. I need more now!"
"Pours out an orangey, dark caramel with a thinnish white head and some nice, abundant, ornamental lacing. In the nose is lots of toast, toffee, and dried fruits with a backing of very pronounced spicy, floral, and woodsy hops. The malt in the flavor is very solid with a little less fruitiness than in the nose, but with a lot more toastiness. Caramel/toffee is holds about the same amount of weight in the smell. There is also some sweet, moist tobacco in here. What surprises me is the very loud hops. They are extremely floral and spicy. Just about perfect. There's a nice little bit of bitter astringency in the finish, which works well with the initial hit of sweetness. Mouthfeel is moderate in weight, but it's kind of fizzy for me. Delicious. This is definitely the best the best altbier I've tried. Very quaffable considering the abv."
"This is a very nice beer with an impressive drinkability. I don't think you can go wrong with this one."
"D - This is a decent altbier, but I can't help but think this would be fantastic when it's fresher and in Dusselfdorf. This is the beer that they serve periodically throughout the year, unannounced, as a thanks to the regulars. Uerige was probably my favorite place we stopped at when visiting Dusseldorf last summer - I didn't have the good fortune of catching a 'Sticke' there though - I imagine it would have been awesome. I had to get this one in KC."
"D - Drinkability is good. It is so smooth that this beer can be dangerous. It is a sweeter beer but other flavors come in to balance out the sweet characteristics well. Definitely worth a try."
"Enjoy one of these well crafted biers. Prosit!"
"Great beer, I really enjoyed this."
"Pours a hazy brown color, some carbonation, tiny off-white head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is mostly malty, very slight toffee/caramel. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, with some toffee/caramel. Light-Medium body, kinda on the watery side. Drinkable, a tasty brew."
"Tranparent chestnut body with amber and mahogany highlights topped by a thick, rocky head that really lasts a long time. Aroma has a very pungent hop note that is peppery. Flavor is definitely a spicy hop flavor, but not as intensely bitter as expected. The malt and hop bitterness are balanced fairly well, although the hop bite does slide in a slight herbal bitterness in the finish. Hop bitterness gets mor epronounced as I continue to sip. Mouthfeel is good, perhaps a bit thin for the amount of flavor going on here. Drinkability s good, but the dopplesticke is actually much more enjoyable. Overall, a really nice, classic beer."
"Drinkability: I had no idea Altbiers could be so complex and robust. This is an eye-opening beer experience! Highly recommended."
"Flavor mirrors the aroma but more so... toasted malts .. nutty .. with not as much caramel as the aroma... good bitterness with more of a spicy hop palate. Lite medium body with persistent carbonation... very very drinkable. Overall... more complex than my feeble palate and brain can put together.. but still, if this was on tap at my neighborhood spot... No doubt, I would enjoy pint after pint."
"wow, so this is what an alt is supposed to be?! double bag is a decent beer, but can't hold a candle to this!"
"Drinkability is fairly high. Goes down smooth and easy, no noticeable alcohol strength and great flavors."
"T:"
"I had a bottle of this at the Winking Lizard in Columbus. It's probably the most definitive altbier I've tried, and definitely tasty. The beer was dark copper and hazy with an aroma of fresh wort. Very malty in smell and taste with a pleasing after-taste. Very drinkable, I finished the glass quicker than I expected."
"Interesting complexity. Hop is the initial flavor on the taste; quickly it subsides to a slightly sweet, full-bodied malty liquor. The bitterness returns and continues through the swallow and aftertaste."
"The Uerige Sticke is an excellent beer that I plan to indulge in often and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a nicely balanced beer with a lasting bitter finish."
"Overall a very well-balanced beer, and if others are like it then I will definitely seek out more from this style..."
"I'll start with my overall impression which is that this is probably one of, if not the best representation that I've had of this style. This alt is very well balanced with a slight edge going to the malt side of things (just how I like my alts). The nose is a bit more delicate than I'd expect, but it is pleasant and again leans toward the malt side with some noble hops for balance. The mouthfeel was well rounded with a slight, very slight drying effect after mid bottle."
"The subtle sweetness and refreshing hop zest make this beer outlandishly drinkable. A tad high in alcohol to be sessionable but the flavor is perfect to that end. A very good beer and a great introduction into the altbier style. I'll definitely be coming back to this one."
"This is a very drinkable Altbier. Worth a try for sure."
"D - A good beer, not something I could drink all night, but one every now and again would be great."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer did not hold a head =very long and appeareed to be flat. however the tastewas rather sweet and it was a bit hoppy to the palate. A bit of a mouldy aftertaste was detected or peat taste I should say. The beer was sienna colored. I will not buy again but it was an interesting beer you should try."
"It comes in a unique flip-top, but it stands strong on its own. The malt is a nice backdrop, but it's the nippy noble hops that take the crisp cake. The clean finish prepares the palate for each ensuing sampling. It drinks easily and with a refreshing note. Cool bottle and cool beer, a cool combo."
"This is a great beer. It looks great, it tastes great, it's drinkable and the bottle is da proverbial bomb. This beer would appeal to fans of many beer styles, and I would highly recommend it to everyone."
"uerige sticke is a unique brew. brewed in dusseldorf one can taste and smell the german bock flavors in it. pours slightly ( very slightly) hazy amber color. really tastes like a bock but maintains a hint of belgian amber flavor. smooth with flavor of dark fruits and malt."
"Tawny brown color, slightly cloudy and a rocky off white head with sticky, milky like crown and lace. Bright fruit aromas, juicy fruit gum and light florals, bubble gum. Toasted grain base, with a lazy caramelized sugar sweetness and a little phenolic. Hop herbals, tea leaves, a spice with a vegetable/fruity flavor like pink peppercorns. Slight tartness that builds and goes into the finish with some dry, husky grains and tea herbals in the back. As it warms some of that fruity nose comes into play. Its odd how little the nose corresponds with the flavor here, almost no similarities. Smooth mouthfeel and a carbonation that starts out great but flattens a bit midway."
"i thought i'd enjoy this beer more than i did. perhaps it sitting several months in my fridge was the problem, so take my opinion of this with a grain of salt, as i liked the smaller alt from this brewery. appearance was a ruddy, hazy, lightish brown with an off-white/tan head. nose was caramel, nuts, and what i thought were alcohol/rum notes, which seemed weird. taste was figs, nuts, caramel, and sweet dark malt with a bit of an alcohol presence, again which does not make sense for this beer. mouthfeel was nice and frothy and almost medium in body. drying finish with a bit of roastiness. i'll take another go at this one in the future to give it a fair shake."
"Overall, I like it very much and I hope that I can find some more close to home (I bought this in Chicago), if you know of a place close to me that stocks it please beermail me."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, excellent representation of style, good kick, this beer is well-worth drinking for a whole evening, but I like the Classic version a little bit better."
"At once over-carbonated and a touch thin. Not a total mess, just a bit unbalanced. Overall, however, this is a wonderful alt. Exceptionally sessionable and never close to being boring."
"Strangely high rate of carbonation accentuates the bitterness. An odd beer to be sure. Looks weird, smells pretty uninteresting, tastes pretty good. Given the level of bitterness, this is definitely the freshest batch of this I've sampled, but I'm still not convinced."
"Bottle: Poured a flat deep brown color alt with a small foamy head with no lacing. Aroma of huge caramel malt with some sweetness. Taste is also dominated by some sweet malt with loads of caramel notes. Body is quite full with no real carbonation. Interesting and refreshing but nothing really earth shattering in here."
"D. Since this is an underwhelming brew, I would not return to it. However, I am hoping that once again I got an old bottle. Will repeat this taste on tap in Germany next year."
"Drinkability: Starts off with a great aroma, but the taste slips just a bit. Oh, and what an adorable looking bottle!"
"D- This beer has some interesting flavors but they are very soft and a bit watery."
"Upon supping, palate is smacked with more malty goodness: a big, caramel malt presence mingled with plums, dates and raisins. Actually, many ingredients of a good bread pudding and the cookie-doughlike character is still there as well. Cookie-dough in a bread pudding? Why not! A fine thread of faint herbal hoppiness comes around before powdery grain husk brings in the finale. Moderate carbonation cleans and dries out the finish further  its effervescence creates subtle, earthy notes that were perhaps missed in the initial nose. A semi-light, creamy mouthfeel keep this very drinkable, and Im sad this cool bottle is so very small. A very easy to drink Ale with plenty of depth and character to keep you coming back for more. Will definitely pick this up again."
"I could drink several of these with pretzels on hand, it reminds me of a sweeter Vienna Lager somehow."
"Uerige Sticke was a nice brown color with an off-white head. The head was fairly large and had decent retention, leaving some lace behind. The aroma was sweet malt, toasty, and nutty. The taste was toased malt and some spice with sweetness upfront and a nice bitterness towards the end with a long, very dry finish. It was medium in body with a fine carbonation. Drinkability was very good. Overall this was an excellent beer with lots of complex aromas and flavors. I can't wait to try the Dopplesticke."
"The drinkability is good, buti wouldlove to find this on tap some day. Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK"
"Final verdict: Uerige makes some incredible beers, I'd recommend trying them all."
"Quite drinkable, will be sure to pick up more when I find it again."
"An excellent Alt."
"The body is fairly thin and crisp, but the carbonation is still fairly soft on the palate. The balance really is something to behold. I could drink this all night, which I probably couldn't say for the doppelsticke, even though I quite enjoyed it as well. I will probably revisit this one fairly often, as long as it stays fresh, and I will have to try the Original as well."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability- eh...not a beer I would reccommend, but it's not wretched either."
"This sticke altbier poured a clear, coppery color with light tan, creamy foam that persisted and clung to the glass, leaving lace. The smell was sweetly malty with notes of Munich malt (hint of grape skins). The taste was sweetly malty with the pils malt at for fore and a bit of Munich malt beneath. There was a good hoppy bitterness to balance but the sweet malt won out over the hops. There was a hint of alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel was sweet and malty with medium-full body and modest carbonation. The finish was hoppy. This was a good beer, though a bit sweet. The regular altbier was a welcomed respite after and evening of this sticke alt."
"Overall impression: The aroma and flavor didn't match for me. It was a much sweeter aroma with a much drier flavor. Still, one heck of an enjoyable beer. Glad I tried it. For the value, I probably won't try this very often. But it's a great example. Strongly recommended."
"Cheers!"
"D: Can't say much else other than this is tasty enough to keep me going back for more."
"Uerige has the hands down best altbier. Deep red in color. Rich malt back bone. Hops are there, nice and bitter with little hop flavor just like an alt should be. Spalt hop flavor is mild. Great all around beer, good complex malt notes with balanced bitterness. Top of the heap."
"Shoe leather brown, with a ½ inch bubble bath texture like head. The nose is a beautysweet malts, molasses, notes of hops, figs and nuts. The complexity of the aroma intensifies during warming, and as the sticky patches form in the glass. One word can summarize the Stickesweet; sweet everythingbready malts, nuts and caramel. The body is oily slick, a nice malt-based bitterness comes to play towards the end. Medium bodied and loaded with joya winner, a top ten beer in my book. Savor and enjoy; this one is easy to drink!"
"Pours a reddish brown with a dissipating head. The color is a deep brown/garnet with a substantial amount of yeast in suspension. Sweet malt aroma rises from the glass. The taste is of a very attenuated hefeweizen with a long aftertaste of toasted malt. Very cleansing and satisfying session beer."
"Drinkability: For my 200th beer review, I thought I would try a style of beer I haven't had before in a cool bottle and I was glad to try this beer. It's something I might like to try again in the future, but I would like more is to try more from this brewery to see what their others beers are like, that's if I can find any more."
"Mouthfeel was full-bodied and smooth. Mildly carbonated. A very nice, rewarding, highly drinkable alt."
"Uerige Sticke pours a dark reddish brown with a minimal head from a brown 33 cl swingtop bottle. Aroma is a little fruity, maybe even a little hoppy. Nice chewy malt flavor, but balanced well with hop. Definitely the best alt I've tried. Recommended."
"12oz. bottle. Light brown with some copper. Slightly cloudy. Essentially, no head formed, the foam scraps were light tan. Aroma was very malty, coming through as molasses. Other scents included alcohol/phenol and raisins. No hops to be found. Taste stayed in character with the smell. Pretty sweet, with alcohol/medicinal notes in the middle. Hops showed up as some bitterness in the finish. Body was medium and carbonation was light. The beer had a smooth, coating feel to it. Finish was drying. Overall, OK, but not my favorite alt and I probably wouldn't buy it again."
"This beer pours a hazy brown. The head was thin, and quickly disappated. The initial flavor is a bit hoppy and bitter, transitioning into a malty, almost doppelbock like flavor. The beer is dry, and doesn't leave much of an aftertaste. It hides its alcohol content well. A flavorful beer that's easy to drink."
"Pours with a rust and dirt colored body and minimal head that fades to a ring. There is little carbonation apparent. Smells are of figs and molasses -- sweet smells like a doppelbock and just a hint of hops. On the palate, there's first a metallic bite, then some figgy fruits. Somehow the taste is creamy and minerally at the same time. Long, dry finish with pinpricks on the tip of the tongue. Mouthfeel is still and smooth. A very drinkable beer that hides its ABV well, this is one to sip with company."
"Note: after it warmed up, the complexities started to shine. Raisins, Biscuit came through in the taste and the smell become slightly more alcoholic."
"Drinkability: Created by a master brewer, this beer displays incredible complexity for being only 6% abv"
"PROST! Beertracker"
"D: What a great beer. Very original and well crafted with so many dimensions. Awesome."
"Bham UK June 2006"
"Drinkability/notes: A well-crafted example of an Altbier. Thanks to HardTarget for sharing this example of an uncommon style."
"Liquid copper in a glass. Head is around an inch thick and the color of a marshmellow. Nose is a bit understated but I get honey and caramel. Taste is much the same, but the alcohol gives me the idea that maybe they aren't trying to conceal it. It's in your face. There's also a grainy and sour taste in the finish that isn't unpleasant. Mouth is very nice. Thanks to Clickpush for providing this!"
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable as a few bottles can easily be quaffed. Nicely balanced and hits the tastebuds just right."
"Nice coppery color. No real head but a decent carbonation level. Aroma of caramel and toasted malt. Somewhat of a metallic or ""industrial"" tinge to it. Slight frutiness. Very nice malty, caramel flavor. Trace of bitterness-almost more of an alcohol tinge then hops. Good body. Very drinkable and enjoyable. I have wanted to try this for ages. I actually prefer the double sticke but this is a damn fine beer none the less."
"Drinkability: Moderate abv, good malt flavor, this is a good beer that I could easily drink all day long."
"Very satisfying. Great balance of fresh hops and nutty caramel body."
"Mouthfeel- A little sweet, but most of the palate was centered around the malt. This was a very nice beer all around."
"Hand carried back from Kansas City."
"The mouthfeel is moderate with fine and tight carbonation. Overall this beer is reasonably drinkable, but not quite as satisfying for my palate as an American amber ale."
"I did a little research and found out that this beer is only brewed twice a year, each third Tuesday in January and October."
"Notes: When you see this grab a bunch. Usually around $4-5 a bottle....If I lived in Germany this would most definately be in my stable at all times in high quanity, outstanding."
"Light hazy mahogany body supports a smallish off-white head, despite a vigorous pour. Nice balanced aroma of sweet malt, cracker malt and citrusy hops. Flavor has much higher hop notes than the aroma: citrus, pine and bitter hops. Crisp, bitey and peppery. Mouthfeel is good and round, with light carbonation. Very pleasing and drinkable. Overall, somewhat less enjoyable than the Doppelsticke, but still very nice. Price is a bit high for an every-day beer, but good for special occasions."
"Taste; mmm..lots of malts, caramel and molasses. Dried figs, and cherries, walnuts and some allspice. There's just a bit of a hop bitterness towards the end to balance it out a bit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and so easy to drink. It's almost gone and I feel like I just started drinking it."
"I think this is a great beer. Nothing out of this world spectacular, but something I'll buy again and again."
"Wouldn't mind trying this again to confirm the nature of this beer."
"Lots of sweet malt in the aroma. Caramel, brown sugar and molasses. Light amber in color with a head that is both creamy and bubbly. Has a deep fruity sweetness in the fore followed by a crisp, but tongue coating flavor of peanut skins. Never come across that before in a beer."
"And then the moment is over. The aftertaste is quite clean, with just a faint remembrance of what a wonderful experience it was. Just try not to quaff it down too fast. What a beer, what a beer!"
"Malt was the star of the Uerige Sticke. It was a well balanced, tasty ale."
"Pours from the uniquely shaped bottle with a short vanilla colored head of tiny bubbles that quickly reduces itself to a few lingerers at the edges. The soft copper and amber highlighted beer produces only a few small carbonation streams. The smell is carmelly and sweet, but with subtle hop notes. The taste is initially malty and sweet and finishes with nice gentle hops that linger a short time. The flavors are well integrated and beautifully balanced. Soft mouthfeel and medium bodied. This is a wonderful beer that is absolutely drinkable."
"Following the indomitable PaulK and his tognues on this review. Poured a brown color. Very clear. Not much of a head and it appeared fairly flat. Nose is a bit biscuity with some nice toasted malts. Flavor is simple malts. Fairly sweet at first but then swiftly followed by a nice hop presence. Sweet with a bit of berries toward the end. Very nice and light. Extremely easy drinking."
"Drinkability: A style that I like but haven't been able to try too many of, Uerige is maybe the most distinctive Alt brewer, just because of their unique and eye grabbing bottles. It is a good beer, one of the better Alts I have tried. Thanks again to LuckySevens82."
"This is the best alt I have had to date, hands down."
"From a unique, long-necked swing-top bottle, this brew pours a deep, reddish earthy color. The beer sports a very thin, white, persistent head. Theres considerable malt in the aroma.lots of caramel, along with a lightly toasted, Vienna-like character. Very light hop smell also mingles with the malt, but takes a decidedly back seat. Slightly dry and nutty taste, with the malt character following through. Bitterness develops late in the mid-taste, and the beer finishes with a nice, lingering bitterness. Very clean and crispreminiscent of a lager. Very drinkable, with an entertaining balance. This is an extraordinarily good brew."
"Overall: This is my third Uerige, and I don't love it as much as the classic alt or the doppelsticke. Those both had nicer appearances, held their heads better, and didn't have the little off flavors throughout."
"Finish is smooth and cleansing and it is drinkable- just a funky old school brew in an overpriced bottle."
"Mouthfeel was extremely light. The carbonation even made it more so, which I feel detracted a bit. However, this also just increased the already drinkable nature of the brew. ""Garcon, Liter stein please!"""
"Pours out with a brownish amber color body and a decent sized off white fluffy head. Clumps of lace were left by a cap of foam that stayed intact. Toasted grains, caramel and some nuttiness. Light fruity notes linger about as well. Mild grassy and flower hop notes blended in well. Flavor starts off with a nice sweetness caramel covered fruits mainly. Toasted biscuit malts and some very light nutty notes are present. Hops are there providing a great grassy and earthy flavors. Light bitterness on the finish. Smooth with a solid body. Ridiculously drinkable stuff. I could sit and drink this all day and not get sick of it. A most excellent sessionable brew."
"This is kind of thick for a 6% abv. beer and not a session beer."
"Medium in body with a smooth-ish aftertaste where the hops mellow nicely and the alcohol shows up just a little."
"It pours a hazy copper with a small fluffy light brown head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Nutty caramel and chocolate aromas, nutty caramel toffee flavors. Medium bodied with a smooth almost syrupy mouthfeel, finishes with a lingering bitterness."
"Bottled on 31.01. Am I to assume that is 2005? Poured into my Fankenheim Alt glass. Crystal clear copper/brown with a dirty white cap. Toasted whole grain breads and caramel. Nice scent of Spalt hops. Malt sweetness and hop bitterness it very good. Full bodied."
"Drinkability: As someone who developed his love for beer in the Zum Uerige brewpub in 1968, I was anxious to try this ""secret"" offering. I was not disappointed. This brew is eminently drinkable with a maltier and hoppier character than the usual Alt beer offered by Zum Uerige."
"Bad ass bottle, if nothing else. Poured out to a brown amber color with a small head, and some traces of lace. Lower carbonation. Odors of sweet malt and hops were most noted, along with some alcohol. Taste was pretty good, flavors of sweet floral earth and malt, with a nice crips hoppy finish. Finished a bit dry, and rather smooth. A good beer, as now I look forward to trying some of the other varites from Uerige Obergärige Hausbrauerei. Recommended for those with a more developed taste."
"Pours a brilliantly clear ruby amber color that is topped by a frothy, thinnish, tan colored head. The aroma is quite fruity with notes of brandy, and rum, hints of strawberry, citrus and lightly spicy notes. Actually a fairly interesting aroma that is still intriguing after these 6 months. The taste is lightly sweet and fairly malty with notes of caramel. This is quite fruity as well with notes of cherry, raisins, and a bit of strawberry and some notes of bergemot as well. For some reason the fruity character in an Alt I have always associated as an interesting mix of hop and malt character. This has held up much better, in the voyage across the Atlantic, than the regular Alt did, though it stills suffers quite a bit from the voyage."
"Pours a slightly hazy medium brown with almost no head to speak of I thought it might be flat,very sweet aromas of caramel malt and roasted nuts.Very slick mouthfeel slides down easy flavors are on the sweeter side but not cloying,caramel dominates the flavors with an underlying roasted maltiness finishing with just a little herbal hop.A good beer no doubt as good as I thought and the hype?Not sure."
"Thanks to Joe @ Corral Liquors in Granite City for the heads up on a great Alt."
"Bottle provided by LuckySevens82...thanks for the opportunity! Pours a single finger tan head over a cloudy rust orange-brown liquid. Smells caramel malty with a sour tang that's almost citrusy pine sol-like. Searching beneath that unpleasant aroma, I get nuts, chocolate, and a grassy herbal. Tastes sweet nutty caramel and toffee with a piercing sour countering beneath. Yeah, I'm sorry, but that sour pine-sol flavor is just ruining it for me. Let's see what I can get after it warms to room temperature. The sour is still present, but it comes across as more of a black patent sour than a pine sol sour. There is also come coffee roast. Medium body with a sugary thickness and mildly carbonated. Certainly not a favorite of mine."
"This has to be one of the top-10 best looking beer bottles in the world. The shape, the embossing, the classy label and the swing-top say 'I'm special'. I agree. Drinkability is through the roof, as evidenced by the fact that I was in danger of running out of beer while still pondering the hidden charms of the multi-dimensional flavor profile. I would love to have another bottle in front of me. Uerige Sticke is great beer and is, by far, the best altbier that I've had yet."
"overall: i've had this before, but i remember it being better. maybe i should have reviewed it then, and maybe my tastes have changed since then. i'll have another for a best 2 outta three. almost perfect mouthfeel and drinkability to style (and despite what i prefer), but leaves a little to be desired. overall, a very good altbier, and a definite must try."
"nice flip top action on the bottle.. the beer exits a foamy and clear ruby into a big chalice. aroma reeks of caramel malts accompanied by light red fruits and burnt sugar. spicy rye breadiness in the flavor provides a smooth but intense experience that finished with a pointed bitterness. has the potential to be huge, but suffers from a lack of gravity. try the doppelsticke for the experience you want out of this beer but fail to have. not a bad beer by any means, very flavorful.. it simply does not satisfy on the complexity that the initial contact promises."
"Drinkability and Overall: I like this beer, but the Uerige Altbier Classic is much better in my opinion. This one lacks the fullness and complexity I expected. It still a good brew, a nice example of an altbier, and one worth trying."
"Pours a clear amber/tan/brown color. Very little carbonation. What bubbles do form are extremely small. Smell is sweet and fruity. Plum. First sip starts with a rich, creamy texture that gives way to a hoppy, bitter after taste. As I drink and it warms, the creaminess starts to wane. The malt quickly is taken over by the grassy hops. As the glass nears the end, the brew seems exceedingly smooth. When I first started drinking, I thought this was interesting and nice but I would want to change to something else when finished. Now that it is gone, I wish I had another."
"Drinkability isn't easy to set as I only have one bottle of this. I was made familiar with the Altbier style through Alaskan Amber, a brew I enjoy at least once a month. Alaskan Amber is a near perfect session beer, this beer is much stronger than Alaskan Amber in smell and bitterness but it isn't more pleasant to drink just different."
"very drinkable with the small ABV."
"Pours out a rich copper color, pretty much the color of a penny. A nice frothy tan head appears. Smells of rich caramel and molases. Kind of a roasty aroma, but not burnt. Taste is of mellow caramel. Sweet and sugary, but not thick and syrupy at all. The herbal hops balance this one out perfectly. Wow is this incredibly smooth. I could really pound these puppies down. Cool bottle, but damn pricey. Is there a comparable alt?"
"I think this version of the Uerige altbier is wonderfully put together, just like the everyday brew. Is it better? Well, it's flavors are more assertive, though just as nicely balanced. I can't choose, so I guess I'll have to enjoy each according to my mood of the moment...."
"The beer evacuates the 330ml brown swing-top bottle a somewhat hazy copper with a moderate size frothy light tan head that dissipated quickly leaving a thin coating of lace to conceal the glass. Nose is a mix of sweet malt, and hints of hops, fresh and crisp, nut-like, start is nicely malted, light at the top. Finish is moderately carbonated with the hops pleasantly spicy, extremely dry and somewhat sour aftertaste, lingers long upon the palate, a drinkable beer, but I much prefer the Dopplesticke."
"A must buy beer for Ale lovers."
"Note: Although Ive had the opportunity to have some before, this is the first altbier Ive sampled. I can see myself buying this again someday, but it also makes me want to branch out and try other altbiers. Hopefully the others can stand up to my first impression."
"I'm a bit disapointed in this brew. The regular alt is quite good, this one seems to fall short. Dark coppery color and fair bit of tan head are spot on, and the aroma is quite pleasing with a bit of nutty malt and floral hops present. Flavor starts well, but the bitterness was unpleasant and possibly a bit medicinal. A good start that fell flat. Mouthfeel is good, a great balance of substance and easy drinking. Overall a good beer but not as good as the regular offering."
"I was lucky to find this during a recent trip to Frederick, MD - if you can believe it. A neat, flip-top rubber cork supposedly will keep it fresh once opened, but my sample went in about 15 minutes, proof of its drinkability. It opens with a thick head that sssllllooowwwlllly dissolves without a bit of lacing. The color was a cross between amber and copper. (Those Dusselldorfers do know their bier.) I detected an apple-like smell, but maybe it was just my sensorial schematics. The Sticke, German for ""secret," a fact which other reviewers may have addressed - I never read previous reviews prior to putting mine online, is extremely light-bodied for an altbier and offers a seductive hint of malt, yet still holds back to prevent overwhelming other aspects. A great drinkable beer for any hot day. Es ist eines gutes bier fur alle."
"Tastes malty upfront that fades into a clean, hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is the best part. A lot fuller than expected, but smooth enough to make for a damn drinkable brew."
"Very drinkable, but in gulps owing to signfiicant carbonation. Good hop aroma, colour. Tasty spice and good bitterness. Nutty toasty and fruit worked nice. Somewhat dry and malty finish. This was a hard beer to track down and must have again. Thanks ClarkVV."
"11.2 ounce flip top bottle. Copper colored with a creamy off-white head. The aroma is nuts and berries. Sweet malt flavor at first. It reminds me a little of gummy bears. Slightly bitter hop flavor in the finish. Mouthfeel is fuller than most beers of this style. A little syrupy. The drinkability is above average. There is nothing extraordinary about this beer, but it is still good."
"This is a decent beer, but quite over-hyped, probably because most Altbiers suck in general. Summit Alt thoroughly eclipses this in the bottle. Reminds me of a Rogue Amber. $3.49 for this little bottle again?...no way. I would love to try it on tap."
"Drinkability: The aftertaste is quite stricking, but still mighty drinkable."
"The beer pours a ruby red color with a thin offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry and malty flavor that boasts of pale and crystal malts. It's sweet and toastey. The taste is good. It has a smooth, malty flavor that goes down slow and finishes dry and bitter. It has a solid hop flavor that comes through in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent altbier. It has complexity, but I'm not crazy about the taste. All in all, an above average alt. ."
"Served out of a firkin at Sean Bolans in Baltimore. Dark Amber with a thick creamy head. What an excellent beer. Notes of caramel, toffee, roasted nuts, nutmeg, and a little bit of hops in the finish. Very creamy mouthfeel even with just a gravity pour. Easy on the pallate, you could definitely drink a lot of these. I slugged down 2 and didn't even know it. An under appreaciated style for sure, and this is the crown jewel."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Mouthfeel is good with a medium body and a nice creamy texture. Goes down so damn smooth. If it wasn't for the rarity and price per bottle here I could easily drink loads of this stuff. Good beer."
"Drinkability- Overall it's a very interesting beer of a taste I was not expecting. I wish I had consumed it a bit ago as I have sat on this brew for a few months. Maybe it would have been better or somewhat different. The one thing I really regret is not trying it when it was on wooden cask at the Toronado in January of this year :( After reading fellow reviewers, I seemed to have missed the boat there. It's a very unique and tasty brew though."
"Paid $4.99 for an 11.2 oz. bottle. Uerige Sticke's is dark copper in color with a tiny wisp of a head. Aroma is a mix of light malts and light hops. A tiny hint of alcohol smell is also noted. Taste has a spicy malt character with some hop bitterness. Caramel sweetness is there towards the middle which leads to a spicy finish. This is definently the hoppiest German beer I've expirienced. Nice complexity of flavors working here. This is very drinkable stuff, however, in my opinion, Uerige Sticke is too expensive to be a frequent buy."
" Mouthfeel is good smooth creamy almost. Drinkability is good kind of pricey for what you get but not bad tasting either."
"In bottle, 11.2 oz serving. Pours a medium to dark amber with very little head but plenty of carbonation bubbles. The smell was caramel and lightly hopped, mostly smelled like something that was going to taste good. But in a generic beer kind of way. The taste was smooth. Is smooth a taste or a mouthfeel. There was no overpowering flavor, it just all worked together, little bit o' hops, nice maltiness, a touch of the caramel. Balanced. Mouthfeel was smooth (as Ive already written) and clean. This beer is amazingly drinkable for a 6% beer. Gone instantly, was looking for more, could drink this all night. If Im ever in Dusseldorf, I know what I will be doing for at least one night."
"I really like this bottle. Very cool. Pours a copper color with a small head that dies off quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass. Very nice caramel malt aroma with something in there that I can't place (but good). Very clean flavor. Caramel malts and toffee with a slightly bitter finish. Enjoyable. I'd have this one again. Slightly strange but very tasty. Too bad it came in such a small bottle."
"A huge thanks goes out to BA Luckysevens82 for the trade!"
" Very refreshing for 6% beer. I like it."
"Pours a one-finger white head that quickly fades leaving no lace. Slightly cloudy amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose seems to be caramel. Starts and finishes with a balance of malts and hops but there is some sweetness hard to describe this - maybe a combination of a barley wine and a sweet stout for flavor, but it doesn't look anything like a stout. $4 for a 330ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"the aroma came out more as it warmed up, more hops and malt. the flavor came out more; bitterness and carmel."
"damn, this is one of the most off-the-wall beers i've had in a while. i have to thank whoever it was for mentioning it in the forums yesterday, or i wouldn't have recognized it as anything at my beer store. seriously, get this stuff."
"Pours out a reddish copper color with a good size head that lasts and lasts. The smell is malty with just a hint of hops in the background. Caramel is mostly what I pick up. Taste is not what I expected at all. Much more clean but still full of flavor. Sweet in the beginning but gives way to something a bit metallic. The ending has a nice hop bite. The flavors just seem to last and last in my mouth. I would love to try this beer from the cask. I truely hope to enjoy this beer some day in Germany."
"Overall: Definately worth a try. I will have to have some more of the style to see how it compares for the style, but a good beer overall."
"hoppy as hell in the taste with a smooth body, just a touch of roasted to over toasted malt. dry bitter finish, and the mouthfeel gets a bit richer towards the end. very very hoppy though. might be worth picking up again. definetly give it a shot though."
"Certainly, the best altbier I've ever had. Too bad this is brewed only two days a year, making it a tough find."
"On the top of the bar at Boston's is a small cask of this classic. Can it be true? Yes, even served in the Uerige small altbier glasses. Cloudy caramel colored liquid with a decent off-white foamy head. Good head retention, some lacing on the sides of the glass. Fruity smells along with some grainy caramel. Carmel flavor with maybe some apricots and other lighter fruits. Slight hop bitterness and flavor goes well with the caramel flavor. On cask, so low carbonation, creamy mouthfeel. This cask was several days old, so I imagine that a fresher one would be wonderful. Anyhow, this was good enough to spark my interest for more in this style."
"Overall, this was a bit of a let-down for me. Don't get me wrong; it was okay but it seemed too highly hopped and out of balance for my enjoyment. The nose really had me going. Too bad the rest didn't do it for me."
"Lightly sweet pale malt and candied hop aroma. Light cream colored head faded slowly to a film laving a few string of lace. Clear, deep copper colored beer packed with streams of fine carbonation. Nice hop tea aroma balanced by some lightly sweet malt. A pinch of bitterness kicks in towards the end and cuts the sweetness of the finish. Body is moderate-light while the mouthfeel is soft and light. Nice and easy drinking with some really tasty hops."
"Overall, I don't know what to make of this beer. It's quite good, but it's not a beer I'd want to drink very often. I may try it again in a few months, and see how I feel about it them..."
"Pours to a clear copper color with an off-white head that diminishes to just a ring. The aroma sweet, malty, caramelly, with toffee notes. It also has a slightly fruit, spicy hop aroma. The flavor is malty and caramel-like, with a floral, semi-fruitiness. It is a bit creamy and flows to a nice light bitterness in the finish. A very clean, easy drinking beer."
"The taste is hidden by a little bit of musky taste and oakiness, but this winner shines through the adversity. There is an almost chocolately nature to this beer, and a huge hop profile. The mouthfeel is almost cask-like, heady and dangerously drinkable."
"This one pours a transparent reddish brown wtih no head at all. The nose is caramel with some roasted malts in there as well. There is a lot of roasted flavor in there. There is also a bit of bitter that hits the back of the tongue after swallowing the beer. Mouthfeel is somewhat thin, and there is a lack of carbonation. I would like to see more bubbles. Drinkability is okay. I like it, but its not my favorite. I would probably try it again though."
"At 4.99 a bottle, this will be a rare treat for me when I return to Indiana to visit the fiancee's family."
"Edit: After reading some other reviews I look at the date stamp -- 29 02 --if this is February 29, and I am having it on August 30 --maybe this is why my ratings are low for this one."
"Drinkability: Besides the mouthfeel, this was a really good beer and a nice example of an Alt beer. Lookout though, this one could really hurt your wallet if you do like it."
"Overall: Maybe I had a bottle past its prime, but this seemed to lack a little something in appearance and nose, like it was tired at times, but the taste and mouthfeel was immensely enjoyable, both lending some amazing character to a very drinkable brew. I will certainly pick up a fresher sample if I see it again."
"I may not be getting the full effect here due to the apparrent flatness of my bottle."
"Pours a deep copper amber, almost a light brown color with a soft white head about a half inch thick. Nice lace. Aromas of bread, biscuit, and nuts. Also a little caramel sneaks in there. Initially this beers has a big malt flavor profile. Bread and biscuit dominate initially but is followed by some nice caramel and toffee. This beer finishes with a light hop citrus and a nice sweetness which makes it quite enticing. A nice light body makes this beer super drinkable and super enjoyable on the pallate. Overall a great alt, but I may like the classic a little better, I just can't decide."
"The beer poured a copper color and formed a nice small bubbly white head that left trace lace as it subsided. A very small stream of carbonation was present. A heavy aroma of malt and hops, with floral and caramel elements, with a slightly nutty aspect. A flavor of malt, lightly of caramel and a nice hop aspect that relects well in the astrigent, bitter finish of this beer. Not quite up to the classic, but still a great beer."
"Cool bottle with a flip-top. Pours a rocky light ivory head over clear light brown liquid. Fruity caramel malty nose with some discernible hop. Lots of hop bitterness in the taste with nutty, caramelly/roasty notes afterwards. Very bittersweet finish, with heaps of hops on the palate. A very interesting beer!"
"This beer is incredibly smooth and easy to drink. I think I could drink quite a few of these and not fill up. If you see it try it!"
"Drinkability  I swear I started thinking in German while drinking this bier. A good, authentic Altbier is almost impossible to come by here in the US, but this is the real deal."
"Quite a fine beer. So simple yet just a perfect example of an alt. Theres really not much to it though. Its big and malty where it needs to be big and malty. Its earthy hoppy and bitter right where it needs to be. Its a nice beer."
"Big U.P. of Michigan thanks to trbeer for the bottle!"
"Poured into a Middle Ages imperial half pint glass, formed a 1/4"" light toffee head over a clear, caramel-hued brew. Laced well. Aroma is lightly of yeast, and a snippet of malts, but not prominent, I'm afraid. Taste is smooth caramel, which slithers across the tongue, and just as you start to think it perhaps may be a bit too sweet, the hops take over, clear the malt out, and change the taste completely. Very nice. Mouthfeel excellent, and drinkability is as well. Excellent brew, easily can see how this would be mind-boggling fresh and/or on-tap."
"The color of a dark penny with a sluggish head. The caramel malt is strong in the aroma, smells like it could be a little oxidized. There's a hefty maltiness in the flavor and a decent bitterness in the finish. I'd really like to try this in Germany and see how it compares close to home."
"In some bizarre way, this seems to me a German equivalent of true Irish Guinness, and I mean that as a high compliment. Glad I have another in the fridge to share."
"Thanks to my German friends who turned me on to this style 5 years ago when I was in the Ruhr."
" The mouthfeel is smooth with light carbonation and a medium body. A big malt backbone compliments the nice floral and citrus flavors well. It has sour notes as well as a nice cinnamon flavor to it. A buttery flavor comes and goes. The complexity is pretty well-rounded and well-balanced. Roasted flavors jump out in the dry finish. It is extremely drinkable, and I could have a few of these during a sitting. I think that this one really defines what I like in an alt. This is one quality brew that you shouldn't miss."
"Orange brown body with a foamy white head. Aroma presents rather vague bready and earthy malt which is caramelic. Surprisingly, yeast plays an important part giving it an interesting banana fruitiness. The 60 ibus appear rather well hidden though, mostly displayed as peppery hints. It doesnt seem too complex though. Once you take a sip though, its immediately superior to the aroma. Theres a very spicy hoppiness complementing the beautiful yeast. The image Id use to describe it is a flower in a cemetary. Aftertaste is rather complex as well, grassy, green, robust yet balanced with tea hints. Medium bodied with rather low carbonation. I didnt expect to enjoy it that much and was expecting an hyped alt for its rather rare, but this is worth seeking."
"710"
"11.2 ounce bottle. Neck label says Bottled on 29.01 and Code 29 02 whatever that means."
"The hop flavor on this beer is awesome. Similar to a hoppy german pilsener, but with a fuller, richer malt character. Unlike any alt I've ever tried, basically bigger, with more pronounced flavors, especially the hops. The tall, long-necked swingtop bottle is very classy. I like the Uerige logo embossed into the glass, as well."
"The flavor is clean at first glance with an exuberiant caramel flavor coating the palate before a fruitiness starts the finish which grows with sharp bite of hops enhanced by a large mineral character."
"Thanks to trbeer for this bottle. trbeer was definitely enthusiastic about this beer, and I can see why. A very solid alt in the sticke style, where a richer malt meets hops, making this one I'll gladly enjoy again."
"After my critical faculties have retired, it's nothing but pure enjoyment, full-bodied,long-finish, but so perfectly smooth, I'm left uttering nothing but simple praise: Yu-umm, I'm saying, and wowwy-wow, wow!"
"pours a nice dark amber with a decent head. smells of spices, cloves, deep malts and slight hop background. taste is the same, rich mouthfeel, crisp flavors of well balanced sweet malt and smooth, drying hops. a good beer with distinct crisp refreshing and warming flavors. Plus a neat swing top bottle."
"This beer has great balance, not too smooth and sweet, not to bitter and astringent. I could see myself drinking this one an awful lot, but seeing as there is very little of it available in the states, that's probably not going to happen."
"The taste is quite clean and very flavorful. Some slight spiciness is immediately notable, leading to fairly nice flavors of breaded malts, almost like toasted cinnamon bread. Nice hop flavor helps to balance out and clean up the lingering malt flavors. Very light bodied and extremely easy to drink. Clearly, well worth searching out on the rare occasions this beer hits our shores."
"Bottled in 29 01 best by 29 02, well that's what the bottle says let's give it a shot anyhow. Appearance: Pours a nice caramel amber tone with a nice sized bubbly tannish cream head leaves even specks of lacing. When I cracked the flip top seal their was a huge pop almost champagne bottle like. Aroma: Caramel sweet sugary malts that are very appetizing blended with a nut edge and grassy noble hop finish. Taste: Big sticky flavors seems like the pinnacle of the altbier style, really ties everything together. Mild sweetness with grassy leafy herbal notes that represent the German hop flavor here decent bitterness in the finish. Very good alt gets my approval and the bottle I have says it's 6%abv, I think when I find a fresher bottle I will definitely grab one seems like some of the malts would be more flavorful if fresh but good stuff nonetheless. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied german ale very even carbonation to me, not bad. Drinkability: Like I said this beer sets the bar for the style I haven't had any alt that was this enjoyable easily could drink a few of these would like to go to Dusseldorf and sample on draft."
"This is one of the most drinkable and refreshing beers I have ever encountered. Michael Jackson said in his Pocket Guide to Beer, ""...it's the most assertive, complex and characterful of the Alts."" I have to agree with him, I will have to go a quest to get more bottles, much less make it to Germany to have it on tap."
"Great swing top bottle, definite style points. This one pours a nice dark amber/almond, with an off white head. very rounded and smooth mouthfeel, nose of malt and nuts. Well developed and smooth maltyness on the tongue, tasts of nuts, malt, bread, a bit of smokyness, pepper, earthyness. Rich w/ moderate alcohol presence. Fine German Alt. Great stuff, worth seeking out and enjoying."
"Pretty clear dark amber. Nice off-white head with little retention and lacing. Smells yeasty, smoky, and resiny. Deep piney spicy hoppage is great. Dull caramel maltiness leaves something to be desired despite a good compexity. A acidic smokiness lingers long after the flavor should have disappeared which is good. Rather low carbonation, feels a bit like spreading plastic over your tongue. odd. Overall an interesting, pleasing brew."
"This beer has a clean dark amber body with a little beige head that disappears quickly. There is a great sweet ( caramel ) malt aroma with just a hint of spicey hops. The malt sweetness starts at the tip of the tongue and gives way quickly to a rush of bitterness at the back of the throat. Which ends in a smooth finish. About half way thru the glass the alcohol warmth starts in your stomach and works it way up to your ears. Yummy."
"Thanks to trbeer and putnam for saving me a bottle."
"Huge thanks for this enlightening experience is thrown out to cokes."
"11.2oz swing top bottle. minimalistic labelling as well. This pours out a dark brown liquid with chestnut edges and a small tan head. Aromas are strong and consist of cloves, vanilla, tobacco, dark fruits, twigs, berries, and deep malts. The hops are there too in the background. The taste is quite malty and deep upfront with the various spices and flavors working their way into your tastebuds. The middle is very roasty and malty, and the finish provides you with a nice bitter blast, and lingering aftertaste of spicy hops. The mouthfeel is thick, but not too thick for the style and the drinkability is very very good. I'm very glad I got a chance to sample this rare nectar!"
"11.2 oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. I know, I know, it's not in an Alt glass, but I don't have any. It pours a deep burgundy color with one finger of off-white head. There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell has lots of fresh hops to it, and some sweet caramel lingering. The taste has toffee and caramel all over it, nice and malty at first. The finish is a brave dose of hops, and just a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is as thick and smooth as an Altbier can get! And the drinkability is just perfect. I could knock several of these down. Top notch, not just according to Altbiers, but according to ALL beers!"
"I've been looking for a replacement for the awesome Blimp City Akron/Macon Ale since they went out of business, and I think I have found it! The beer is a dark brown/amber with an ultra thin off-white head. Very little lacing. The aroma is nice and full, with caramel, malt and sweet fruit. Medium-bodied and very drinkable with a pleasing blend of flavors such as malt, raisin, caramel and hops. The finish is the only place it falls off a little. There is a slight metallic tinge to the fruity finish that was out of character with the beer. A slightly bigger hops finish would make it nearly perfect. As it stands though, this is one of the better Alts I have had."
"Zum wohl!"
"This is refined beyond description. Altstanding."
"Poured from a very cool tall brown swingtop bottle with a long thin neck. Bottle opens with quite a pop and wisps of vapor. No visible head, the tiniest wisps of bubbles float on top for a bit. Color is a crystal clear polished brown suede. Aroma is very sweet and caramely, just a hint of alcohol and hops. Taste is very sweet and malty, nice caramelization and a bit of nutty/woody flavor, alcohol is noticeable up front as well. Maltiness gives way to a startling hop bitterness that becomes more apparent as the beer warms a bit, leaving it just a bit dry at the finish. Mouthfeel is on the thinner side, but that's OK, it helps balance the malty sweetness. A very good alt I'd say, glad I had the opportunity to try it."
"I am glad I got to try this, given that it is the real deal straight from Germany, and it is so difficult to find. Cheers to yen157 for letting me in on this secret."
"Nice bright copper in color with just enough head to keep me happy. Beautiful hop/malt nose. Good and malty up front with a drying bitterness which is unusual from the others I have tasted. Great balance in a good beer, plus it has a nice story...best alt since I lived in Germany."
"Very nice altbier. Certainly the most outstanding I've sampled. I just wish it were more readily available, especially on draught."
"Overall, a great package, great taste, and a highly drinkable brew. However, with all the hype, I was expecting something that was going to blow me out of the water. This didn't and I would certainly drink it again, but wouldn't go too far out of my way to get it."
"The bottle is nice as well, dark brown, it has a lot of detail: Braille on the bottom. There is even a saying on it: Dat leckere droeppke, which I think is dialect for the tasty drop. Swing top adds to the charm."
"John"
"Smooth, balanced flavors. Malty sweet, of course. But the hops in this brew are one-of-a-kind. Flower petal bitterness that's simultaneously spicy, leafy, dry, sharp, and lingering. And just slightly citric. A remarkable achievement, really. I've never gathered so much simply from the finish of a beer. This is quite a great brew."
"Poured out to a amber/bronze/copper color in the glass. I couldn't pick one color, so I am putting all three in this review. The aroma was interesting with almost a fine bourbon smell mingling with malt. The taste had notes of caramel and spices and was extremely easy and soothing to drink. The hops are there, but not overdone and blend nearly flawlessly with the malt. This is a special beer. I bet on-tap it would be even better."
"Pours a dark copper with an nice inch tall white head. Smell is of caramel overtones with Jammy fruits and German hops probably Hallertau..Taste is of dark raisiny bread, caramel, at first then an amazing hop twist that dries it out. Somehow finishes sweet and dry. Light carbonation makes the mouthfeel smoother than chinese silk.. Damn this is good. Drinkability is off the charts . I would have no problem having these all night. Why oh why is it limited.. This is one of the tip top beers . A classic. I got in a case where i work and Im not sure I want to share the rest or horde them for myself. Thanks to Mike from Specialty Bev for snagging me the last case. Damn im almost done with the glass.."
"Came in an impressive looking flip top bottle.Clear ruby mahogony color with a very small snow white head. Very little carbonation. Aroma of sweet bread, fruit cake, and a clean caramel maltiness. Plums show up in there too. OK, you have my attention. What separates this beer is the finish. There are all sorts of flavors going on here, with fruity esters and malt fused together perfectly. The finish is almost like a cider, with apples and a champagne type tastes showing up. Mouthfeel is very smooth but dry, with a slight bittering hoppiness. Drinkability is top notch, especially with just 6% ABV and this much taste."
"Perfect to drink while listening to Coltrane, John or Alice."
"The bottle is a nice swing top style with a long thin neck and is only 11.2oz. It is a clear, dark copper with a thin head. The aroma is of roasted nuts and hops. The nutty maltiness has some caramel in the taste. The finish is a big hop bitterness. The hops are noble and floral. This is a great beer to quaf, though it is a bit expensive at almost $4 for not even 12oz."
"Undeniably drinkable."
"I hope everyone who wants to try this gets a chance while its here in the States. Because it is so limited, that will probably not be the case. Anyway, snap em up!"
