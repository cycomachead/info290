"Malts fail to leave much of an impression. They come and go on the palate like the wind. Looks great though, it has a beautiful reddish brown hue. Mouth feel is pleasingly thick and frothy."

"One of the best brown ales I have had, so far."
"Overall, this is just your average to below average flagship brown ale. Nothing to write home about here, but maybe if it was thicker and a little more roasty it would be a little better."
""
"Pour is a burgundy, oxblood color.  Aroma is a bit weak, malty and non descript.  Taste is pretty clean with notes of chocolate, slight toffee and roasted malt.  Mouthfeel is thin, but enjoyable for an easy drinking brown.  Overall, not the best brown I've had but easy drinking."
""
"Thin, watery, fairly generic. Not bad overall"

"O – Somewhere between doppelbock, Northern English brown, and brown IPA, this is an interesting entry for any of those styles.  Regardless of genre, really an excellent, very drinkable brew."

"Overall: a well brewed example of a brown ale. Probably fits best as a Northern English Brown, well brewed but nothing too memorable."

"O - 3 - Nope. I'll pass on this one in the future. It's not very good at all."

"Nice take on the style. Hop forward with a strong toast character."

"This beer is a little lighter in body than other brown ale, but there is enough good taste and quality to make this beer deserving of a try. I am not so sure I would refer to this as a German Alt, but judged as an American brown ale, it is a good- tasting brew that may not be the most complex on the planet, but still has enough good flavor to recommend."
"Borderline drainpour. Not terrible, but definitely worse than okay. Strange thing is that several elements of the beer are actually pretty good. Not sure what happened with this one."
"O - Very drinkable beer. Npt a super complex beer but still enjoyable and I will definately be picking up more of their beers."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 9/25/2012. Pours hazy reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of caramel, toast, toffee, apple, bread, grass, light chocolate, light citrus, light nuttiness, and herbal hops. Decent aromas with good strength and decent balance; too fruity. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, bread, grass, light chocolate, roasted grain, light citrus, and herbal hops. Light herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, bread, grass, light chocolate, roasted grain, light citrus, and herbal hops on the finish for a short bit. Good flavor balance, but the flavor robustness is definitely lacking; zero cloying flavors are present on the finish, and quite dry on the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly creamy, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is ok. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a decent brown ale. Very drinkable with solid flavor balance; but definitely could use more robustness of flavors, and a finish that is not as dry. A fairly enjoyable offering."

"Overall - A decent beer. I do like the packaging, it looks really cool. But it is just an average beer. I would drink it again, probably not going to buy it again. Just nothing really exciting at all about it."
"not a huge fan of this one.. nothing special really, a bunch of off flavors and smell that don't really blend in well together. i'll sick to their ipa's for sure."

"Pours nicely dark brown with a nice sized head. Has a nice caramel aroma and some chocolate which carries over into the taste. Carmel malt dominates the flavor. Finishes with a slight bitterness which I found quite pleasant. Not super complex brew, very drinkable (to quote another Missouri brewery). I would buy again."

"Found this brew while vacationing in Missouri. Pours a reddish-brown from the bottle with an off-white/cream colored head that seemed to disappear at about half gone. Smells of sweetness from the malt. Tastes of sweetness also from the malt as well as a nutty/bready notes. I enjoy brown ales and this one I enjoyed more than some others I tried."
"OVERALL: An attempt at a German altbier. Possibly has lost some character due to oxidation. This is still an alright beer, but can certainly use some cleaning up."
""
"It appears other's have had better luck with with this company than I."
""
"O: Good drinker that goes down easy. This beer hit the spot for some reason. Worth checking out."
"Overall a pretty nice beer. Bit spicier than others of the style, but glad I was able to try this one, which I was able to get on vacation, as this brewery's products are not sold in my area. Worth a try if you can find it."
"O - This is a pretty nice brown ale. A nice brew by Mother's."
""
"Pours dark brown with a nice sized head. Has a nice carmely aroma which carries over into the taste. Carmel malt dominates the flavor of this beer. Finishes with a slight hop bitterness which I found quite pleasant. Not a super complex brew, but a reliable always-on-hand beer. I almost always have a few in the fridge."
"Overall not bad."
""
"My first Mother’s beer and I look forward to having more! Nice to see another brewery in my old stomping grounds. Will be trying their offerings as soon as I’m back in Springfield again."
""
"Pours a clear, amber color. Two inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, slight roasted malt, and slight pale malt. Fits the style of an Altbier. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, slight pale malt, hint of chocolate, hint of roasted malt, and a hint of grain. Overall, great appearance, decent body, and good blend."
"O: an alright beer, though nothing special. I'd like a bit less bitterness and a creamier body."
""
"Lots of malty flavors ranging from biscuity to caramel to even some chocolate. Hops are mostly on the back end with a fair amount of bitterness. Yeast throws out a few light fruit flavors and a bit of bread. It is not as rich as it looks or smells, but the body is solidly medium. This beer is a little beguiling, odd little critter. I like it well enough, and always glad to try a small, new brewery. Could use a few improvements, mainly some richness and sweetness would be nice, but overall Im pretty happy with a six-pack purchase."
"Medium bodied, firm and dry. I'm not a big fan of the style(s) in general, but this one's pretty good."
"An easy drinker that needs a little more malt depth & hop snap to make this a good Alt, would buy this again though..."
"Of the three beers currently available; an IPA (little helper), Tow Head as well, Three Blind Mice rates second."
"Again no clear style for this beer. They're calling it an alt/english brown/irish red cross. Reminded me most of an alt."
