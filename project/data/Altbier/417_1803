A good amount of ring-like lacing is seen as well as some sheets when sipped. The aroma is of dark malts with some hints of caramel, cocoa and biscuit. Bit more going on with the taste as there is some dark fruits (figs, cherries, plums) with some brown sugar also. Very tasty and smooth. A very light dry hoppy finish is noted but is very slight which actually added some character. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall another very tasty brew from this brewery.","BeerWithMike","Jan 05, 2015"

3.65,-2.1,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a five finger, light brown head that fades to a shallow layer leaving traces of lace. Deep mahogeny color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Strong malty nose.

4.15,11.3,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Appears dark brown with a tan foamy head that left some light speckling of lace as it was consumed. Aroma is sweet with ripe fruits and caramel. Some nuttiness comes out after it warmed a bit as well. The flavor starts with some sweet caramel over fruit and light grains. Notes of light bitterness and nuts come through before the sweet fruit finish. Creamy smooth body makes this go down very easily. A solid very drinkable version of the style that I could see myself drinking more of.","meathookjones","Sep 15, 2006"
3.55,-4.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle. Schmaltz's Alt pours out a dark brown color topped with a small head. The aroma is chocolatey. The flavor is not what I expected, but still somewhat nice: chocolatey, buttery, and a bit acidic. Some fruity flavors appear at the middle, most notably apple and plum. There is a very light hoppiness. Not as sweet as some alts. Mouthfeel is creamy, just as the label claims. Overall, a very enjoyable beer.","beveragecaptain","Jun 11, 2006"

Aroma is malty and nutty, kind of some brown sugar, mild hops, and faint alcohol. Taste is a smooth, creamy walk of caramel malts, thickish nutty, roasted, chocolate malt tones, mild hop bittering for balance, and a cool but warming alcohol finish. Good body, good flavor... nothing fantastic, just an overall good beer.","objectivemonkey","Jun 06, 2006"

Aromas of malt, toffee and tamed hops were present. Nice. Flavor was nice but lighter that I expected. Flavors of roasted malts and hops, with wood overtones were very present. Slightly sweet finish. Mouthfeel was generally good, but nothing special. A decent level of drinkability. This is not what I would think of when someone mentions the Altbier style, but it is rather good nonetheless. Recommended.","Frozensoul327","Oct 26, 2005"

3.53,-5.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a very dark ruby color. Smells of bubblegummy malt. Taste is malty, with a bit of juicy-fruit (I may be imagining that...). All in all, not an impressive beer here. It's tasty enough that I downed it in no time flat, but it's not one I'd buy on a regular basis. Just a decent brew, nothing more.","skybluewater","Jan 22, 2005"
4.48,20.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours a nearly black, dark brown body that loks more like a porter than anything else. Pours with a nice creamy 1/2"" of tan head that has very good retention. Smell is robust with roasted malt and a slight coffee scent. Taste and mouthfeel approach the porter/stout level of body and taste. Good coffee and bready malt flavors with mild acidity present. A truely great beer, and one that I am happy so see return to the Schell's lineup.","TastyTaste","Jan 20, 2005"
3.88,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 oz. bottle: This one pours a very dark brown color. Some light manages to pass through it. There was very liottle head on my example. What was there was tan and died out quickly. The aroma is mainly that of chocolate. Some sweetness coming through also. The taste is a bit roasty, with a subdued sweetness. A hint of fruits in the tsate also. Im sure that ther are hops in there, but they are overpowered by everything else. Decent.","Boto","Aug 08, 2004"
3.63,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"I would have rated this higher if I was rating in general terms, but versus others in the style it just didn't have the hops. I think it would have been better classified as a brown ale or almost a porter.","connecticutpoet","Jul 16, 2004"

3.36,-9.9,2,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Brown with garnet highlights, maybe too dark for this style. Kind of falls into the ""dark beer"" category, but then there's a surprising smoky quality, too. A taste of adjunct also appears to be involved. I guess Schell's is trying to stride that middle line between liquor stores and beer geeks (I got mine at an Iowa liquor store because the ones in Minnesota were closed for Sunday), so this comes off a little less than it could be.","DrunkMcDermott","Dec 12, 2003"
2.93,-21.4,3,2.5,3,3.5,3,"It's says on the label a dark German style ale, I was expecting a deep copper due to the alt style, but this one takes on a similar appearance as a Schwarzbier. deep ruby with a tan head leaves efficient lacing nice full rings at that. Aroma contains some fruity tones based from the malt but there is an astringent metallic offness in the background. Taste conists of darker roasts subtle fruit notes and a standoftish hop character, overall quite nice rolling toasted malts. Mouthfeel conists of soft chewy texture medium bodied ale not bad at all. Drinkability I am fine with just one nice beer but I prefer more pronounced flavors nothing from the August Schell Brewing is of Shock and Awe nature.","WVbeergeek","Sep 17, 2003"

Smell is faint mild roasty malts, kinda woodish and wet dirt-like must. Taste is mild, somewhat subdued but present of roasted malts, maybe black malts as well, quite clean with a smokey softness, a bit of cocoa and a over all mineral like taste with a lingering dry finish thats a bit nutty. Feel is a light-medium body, quick thin start, quick thin finish. Nothing to overwhelming, its a very easy roasty calm beer that could be better in the taste but is still a good drinker, goes well with a grilled burger.","tavernjef","Jul 24, 2003"
3.83,2.7,4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"Pours a clear very dark coca-cola color with a very nice dense tan head. The smell is earthy and grassy malt aroma. The taste has a hint of smoke, roasted malts with a burnt aftertaste, mild hops, and hints of chocolate. It is full bodied with a rich taste and finishes with a lightly dry bitter end. This is a pretty tasty beverage IMO. Thanks to budgood1 for this! Cheers!","BeerAngel","Jul 12, 2003"
3.8,1.9,4,4,3.5,4,4,"A big, dense, tan head is noisy, but slow. There's some spotty lacing. The beer is dark coffee brown. The toffee in the nose is slathered with butter and sugar. Toffee in the front, with some coffee and a bit of chocolate. The thick, fruity, malty, toffee middle turns dark for the bitter chocolate finish. That butter from the nose comes back in the aftertaste, where some fruit shows up again. Excellent. Thanks to feloniousmonk for sharing.","kbub6f","Jul 03, 2003"
3.38,-9.4,4,3.5,3,3,4,"Deep garnet hue, with brilliant, cold conditioned clarity. Light tan, frothy head settles into a thin, muddled layer that manages loose lace. Caramel sweetness with a hint of roasted malt along with mildly herbal hops in aroma. Mellow, dryish waft of cocoa adds depth. Stately, caramel malt sweetness initially in flavor is immediately tapered by hop and roasted grain bitterness. Dominate malt character mirrors the aroma, being comprised of powered cocoa. Slight, raisiny fruitiness complements the mild roasted grain presence, adding complexity. Dry, well attenuated, perhaps overly so. Trace floral noble hop presence. Roasted grain bitterness grows progressively stronger and by the finish becomes lightly astringent. A crisp, well bittered alt akin to the Sticke style, but just a bit shy in malt character. A touch rough, but certainly quite drinkable. A welcome change of pace. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for the delivery.","marc77","Apr 20, 2003"
3.88,4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Color is a dark brown, almost black, with a fine, 1"" creamy tan head. Aroma is largely clean and airy, but there are traces of cocoa and nuts. Hops are there, too, but laying low. On the palate, though, they reveal themselves in all their might. Big burst of fruitiness (bananas,and citrus, primarily!), that soon smooths out bigtime. The malt contingent is firm and swiftly becomes large and in charge. That doesn't stop an overriding fruitiness to continue to ride throughout the flavor and the finish. The rest of the drink is a well-rounded, and fruity flavor, with a slightly coppery edge. I'm no expert on alts, but I know what I like, and this is that.","feloniousmonk","Apr 17, 2003"

Lots of malt in the nose, sweet caramel, a tad peatish, fresh and appealing, the start sweet, and the top lean in its feel. Finish is stinging in its acidity, the hops pleasing to the palate, dry and lingering aftertaste, a quite quaffable beer at any rate.","Gusler","Apr 15, 2003"

A fairly distinct hoppy nose on this alt.  The taste is very nice, but a little different than I'd expect from an alt.  It doesn't have that nice mellow characteristic typical of cold lagered alts.  What is does have is a nice blend of herbal hop notes and roasted malt tones.  This is one of the more roasty alts I've had.  Medium-full in body.   Pretty tasty beer here.","Bighuge","Oct 14, 2002"

The label has always appealed to me.  Color is dark brown with reddish-amber hue in the light.  Head is sufficient and darker in color.  Aroma is light overall, mostly malt with light fruitiness and a bit of hops.  Taste is fairly full, much more malt than hops and not particularly bitter.  Finish is somewhat dry with a quality of hard water and slightly metalic taste.  Nice medium mouthfeel, and some richness to the drink.  A beer I'll continue to buy.","garymuchow","Jul 03, 2002"

I get a definite fruity aroma, and sweet fruity taste with some chocolate tones.  This in no-way compares to the Alaskan Alt I had a few weeks ago.  I thought I may have a bad date but after checking the code thanks to a post on the forum it appears it is relatively fresh...Certainly not a horrible experience but I expected much more.

Not bad to drink though...","ADR","Feb 20, 2002"
