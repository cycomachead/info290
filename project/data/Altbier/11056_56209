3.63,-5.7,4,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,"This rusty brew is intense and imposing, with organoleptics of toffee, butter, caramel and yeast layered around a minty pine-y center. Some citric hints sneak through on the tongue, to unfortunate effects as it clashes with the darker flavors. Furthermore the palate is flabby and coarse  with a premature finish. Extremely unfocused with some questionable choices made regarding the hops.","endovelico","Aug 29, 2014"

4.12,7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"375ml bottle. Stange glass. Deep amber color, foggy appearance. Yellowish off-white froth creates a close, foamy & lasting crown leaving lacing on sides. Caramel, Munich malt & fudge chocolate intense aromas. As expected from aromas, sweet toasted upfront yields to chocolate flavors. Full body. Soft carbonation. Viscous palate. Hints of toasted biscuit & bread, herbal notes & dried nut touch. Long & smooth sweet/bitter finish. Nuts are back on the aftertaste. Solid malty backbone holds hoppiness in well balance, despite its high IBU profile. Nice spot of the Sticke Style: hoppier - but bitterness remains clean- & more caramelish maltiness -but no cloying at all- than a regular Alt & finally a well integrated ABV. Flavorful & delicious!! A masterpiece.","GONZALOYANNA","Apr 09, 2014"

Generally soft and smooth, this manages to fit well with the profile of the beer and the style. Closes very dry, with heavy stickiness clinging to the palate and lips.","falloutsnow","Dec 19, 2013"

It pours a clear garnet topped by a finger of relatively short-lived dirty cream-white foam. The nose comprises candied orange peel, mildly-buttery caramel, a spit of booze, and a touch of toast. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a small contingent of dark, tobacco-like greens. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a solid sticke alt, nothing really all that special, but an enjoyable, malty little brew.","TMoney2591","May 18, 2013"

4.25,10.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4,"A complex brew with a real live rustic feel to it that seems to be a constant for the Signature series from Les Trois Mousquetaires. The beer is full of nuances including a real interplay from the hops and malt in the finish. The mouthfeel is full and makes the beer feel like a higher ABV . Great beer of a style not often seen outside Dusseldorf","canucklehead","Dec 11, 2010"

3.74,-2.9,5,3.5,4,4,3,"D- While I do like this beer, one bottle is more than enough for me, as it's a powerfully flavored beer and the hops are more than enough to satisfy my tastes! The alcohol is very well hidden I think this would pair really well with salty foods and think I'd get this one again, as long as I have someone to share it with.","ChrisCage","Oct 10, 2010"
3.61,-6.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a ruby red/light mahoghany with a generous 3 finger head. Lovely lace from a soapy head. Nose is of dark breadiness, and woodiness, grassy and floral hops and some general spicing. Taste is similar, general woodiness and a grassy/mossy/herbal feel with a touch of light caramel. Taste like the Boreal forest? lolwut? Finishes dry and bitter, with tons of dark bread and grain here. Medium carbonation, and lasting bitterness from teh hops. Relatively drinkable, and well crafted. Certainly quite different from anything I would typically pursue.","liamt07","Sep 30, 2010"
3.8,-1.3,4,4,4,4,3,"Full mouthfeel with just a hint of tingly carbonation.

3.73,-3.1,4.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"This brew pours an impressive cherry,mahogany hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a very frothy two finger head and nice lacing here,there and everywhere,the smell is a mix of aromas of sticky date pudding,dark plums,cherries and dark malts,it has a nice fullish mouthfeel just above medium bodied whcih is lively carbonated,the taste starts off with the dark fruit flavours with a middle body of toffeee malts and it finishes very bitter indeed so bitter that i noticed it was which isnt the norm for me as i do love my hoppy beers but in saying that after the next glass i quite enjoy this bitterness,its definately an interesting brew that showcases sweet and bitter with a touch of more bitterness than sweet which i dont think i could compare with any other brew i have tried if someone asked what's it like compared to? as it definately stands alone with its different,unique but nice mix of flavours and i will revisit this thats for sure.","ADZA","Jul 04, 2010"

3.43,-10.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"I was slightly taken aback by the flavours in this beer - the proclaimed bitterness was certainly present, but in a dry, unorganized manner, given the very minor sweet/fruity offset. Quite distracting, and not in a particularly good way - I'm not all that sure what to make of this style - it just seems to be coming and going at the same time.","biboergosum","Beers"

I'm not the biggest fan of such high amounts of Continental hops personal palate-wise, but it's still an impressive and enjoyable ale all the same, and LTM sticks to their guns by producing fine versions of traditional German styles.","IronDjinn","Mar 15, 2010"

4.03,4.7,4.5,4,4,4,4,"For me this is too bitter to drink much of. I find all of Les Trois Mousquetaires brews to have this quality: while they definitely know what they're doing, they're all too intensely *something* to drink much of. I always struggle to finish off a bomber to myself, not because it's bad but because it's too intense. Drinkable enough to really enjoy a pint, but that's it. The label states that this beer is, "...dominated by a gripping bitterness." I agree. None of the Serie Signature are sessionable in my experience so far.","eat","0"
