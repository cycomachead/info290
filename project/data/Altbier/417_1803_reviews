"Very good beer. Very approachable, good malt"
"Very creamy and smooth, making this an enjoyable malty brew!"
""
"What I think : it's a decent beer and I'd have it again, but I can't exactly put a finger on what is going on with this beer. I mean it tastes like a beer, but I can't pinpoint the style, hence the ""alt""  categorization."
""

"This 'Altbier' (Old beer) style brew pours a very deep reddish-mahogany in color with a good 2-3 finger off-white foamy and creamy head that finally settled down to a good 3mm or so after a good bit. A good amount of ring-like lacing is seen as well as some sheets when sipped. The aroma is of dark malts with some hints of caramel, cocoa and biscuit. Bit more going on with the taste as there is some dark fruits (figs, cherries, plums) with some brown sugar also. Very tasty and smooth. A very light dry hoppy finish is noted but is very slight which actually added some character. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation. Overall another very tasty brew from this brewery."

"O-Decent Alt, but a perhaps a bit to bitter and dark, could use more malt aroma."
""
"Overall: A very solid malty Alt. Good toasty biscuit malt notes with a very nice presence of fruits."
"Overall: The best way I can describe it is a brown ale meets a German Dunkel. Qualities of both; True to style. A nice take."
""
"Pretty decent tasting beer considering it's in the less than $10 six-pack range of beers."
""

"good for what it is, a very malty brew with light herbal hops."
""
"O The initial flavor, the malty backbone and the sweetness is nice but there really isn't much holding this together. The flavor dies to quickly. I got this as part of variety pack, which is good because even though this is an OK beer, I would not by this in a six or twelve pack."
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: Definitely ruined by the aftertaste. I have a hard time believing there was anything wrong with the bottle though because the rest of the sixer was consumed by my friends who didn't seem to take issue with its flavor. Would I drink it again? Maybe, at the brewery."
""
""
"O: Love the Schell's style of malt forward, this one doesn't disappoint, bold, deep, interesting but simple, flavors, brewed the old style way. Done right. Great for cold nights. Very Good Altbier!"
""

"The beer pours a dark, clear brown color with a tan head. The aroma, as expected, is very malty. I get a lot of bread and toffee, with not too much else going on. The flavor is also very malty. There is a lot of toffee and caramel, with a little bit of chocolate thrown in. There is also a touch of grass from the hops. Overall, the beer is very dry. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with a medium-level of carbonation that is still quite soft on the palate. The resultant mouthfeel is generally smooth and creamy, well-flowing. Finish is dry, making you want another sip."
""
"M: Wet throughout the sip but it gives way for some nice drying. Aftertaste is pleasant."
""
"This brew simply avoids bitterness, and compensates with extra malt character. Like eating crackers when you were a kid... sometimes simple is tasty!"
""
"O: A nice interpretation of the style and a great bready beer that you can drink a few of"
"I think that this balance could also be interpreted as making the beer too muddled, and I do agree that some of these flavors could be more pronounced than they are. Schmaltz's Alt shows, once again, Schell's really knows how to craft solid beers."
""
"Nice dark amber with red-edges pour. Smells like toffee and malt, and tastes about the same. I really enjoyed the subtle caramel taste behind everything. Nothing outstanding overall, but I certainly wouldn't turn it down again."
""

"This is a nice beer that could probably be sessionable. Really approachable and easy drinking. I would have no problem tipping several of these back. Makes a nice ""lighter"" winter brew than the typical crowd."
""
""
"I found a variety pack of Schell's brews at the store, thought I'd explore their offerings and take down some tasting notes while I'm at it... Pours out dark brown with reddish highlights at the fringes of the glass. There is a sand colored craggy single finger head, leaving behind decent lacing. Body is much lighter than I had expected from the darkness of the appearance, tastes and smells of heavy breadiness, malts, some minor roasted character than finishes bitter on the palate along with a light earthy hop tone. Pretty good."
"O: I had to drive all over town to find this beer. it is a great beer. needs nothing added or taken away."
"This is another solid beer from August Schell. For the price, this brewery makes some solid beers that hit their style pretty well."
"Overall this was a decent beer, nothing really spectaculat just a decent beer, I would go to it in a pinch for sure. But faced with other options I would probably not."
"Finishes lower on body but very drinkable. This would pass by anyone who just drinks it. Not very complex but well worth it. This is a lagered ale so it is crisp and along the lines if a dunkel."
"Overall and average drinkability for this one. The flavors are a little too strong for a session, yet not bold enough just to keep drinking out of interest."
"I would be happy to drink this at the bar But I would not seek it out unless I had few options although this is really drinkable"
"This was passable, but not really notable."
"Drinkability: Good amount of characteristics to become appealing to a wide variety of people and not necessarily off-putting in any sense."
"The beer pours very dark brown bordering on black with a deep garnet hue and a clingy tan head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is medium-low malt; bready and grainy. The flavor is moderately malty, sweet, bready, and a little roasty. The beer finishes just a bit dry and hop bitterness is low, but combined with dry, subtly roasted flavors it is well balanced. The carbonation is moderate and body medium-full. Overall a well made, flavorful North German Alt that is quite drinkable."
"D - This is another solid brew from August Schell that really nails the style."
"D -- Very nice, excellent representation of the style and worth a purchase."
"Toasted, slightly astringent malts up front. Mild herbal, vegetal bitterness comes in. Biscuit and light caramel malt sweetness. Flashes of cocoa, nuts, and tobacco near the finish. Moderate body with a slightly oily feel. Decently made and pretty drinkable."
"pours a deep dark brown color with auburn streaks and nice fluffy 2 finger tan head.lacing on side of glass..smell is roasted malts.toffee.raisins,and bread..taste follows the nose its a roasted hit of malts smoothed out by some caramel malts ..mouth feel is warm and medium + well carbonated... as it warms the palate with a wave of malt and some hops ,,the flavor is good but not robust..its a nice winter brew that went down fast and got better more flavorful as it warmed"
"D: Great. I am not versed in this style so I may not see the deviation like other may, but I really like this beer. One of the finest from the ""Second-Oldest family owned brewery in the United States""."
"Decent beer by Schell's."
"Drinks pretty easy, not a classic alt IMO, but sessionable enough"
"Pours a dark amber color with lighter amber along the bottom of the glass. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, yeast, slight roasted malt, and slight hops. Fits the style of an Altbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of yeast up front, sweet malt, roasted malt, and slight hop in the finish. Overall, one of the better Altbier's I've had - smooth, good blend, and a nice body."
"D: Very good beer. Lighter than one would expect, so it can be enjoyed all night."
"M/D - Medium bodied, a touch on the creamy side. Crisp carbonation which seems a little out of place. Very easy drinking."
"Purchased from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Pours are dark black color with reddish hues in the bottom corners of the glass. Almost no head to speak of. Aroma is sweet and caramel. On the fuller side of medium bodied, this beer has a smooth, sweet taste with an understated hop aftertaste and a nutty finish. Good beer overall."
"My second beer from Schell's and I am impressed again. Very sessionable beer that I wish was available to me."
"D - Personally, I could drink it all day, but I like the style. This would make an excellent camping beer and the caramelly malt would go great with baked beans and roasted brats."
"This will be worth revisiting every late winter."
"Here's the deal. This is one of the better Schell's beers. Its great. Dark and roasted, but light and easy to drink."
"HV"
"D: While there is not much to the taste, you could drink this all night because of the light body and crisp, smooth mouth-feel."
"D-I've loved this beer for quite some time now. It's an interesting beer, very drinkable and very enjoyable."
"Appearance is clear brown with a frothy tan head. Aroma hits you with some bready malts along with some cocoa, raisins, toast, caramel, and faint flowery hop aroma. Flavor much the same as aroma but here I taste a little smoke in the background. Malts are fairly sweet but this beer is clean and well-attenuated. The higher carbonation scrubs your palate and leaves you thirsting for more. A nice dark lager that isn't heavy or sweet. Very drinkable and enjoyable."
"This is a great sessionable beer."
"Pours a dark reddish brown color with a decent tan colored head that falls slowly leaving some good, chunky lacing. Nuttiness and cocoa in the aroma with just a hint of citrusy hops in the background. Flavor is of some toasted malts, lightly bready, and the slightest hints of nuts, fruit and cocoa powder. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, but it's light on the carbonation and goes down super smooth. This is a nice alt, but there are many other great ones out there. It's very easy to drink and a very good dark(er) session beer for the winter into spring time, although spring is far away from us here in MN."
"Very drinkable, but I drank alot these and gave me a killer hangover like most dark beers!"
"Pours a clear brown with a short off-white head. Smells of darkly toasted toasted bread. The hops come out in the aftertaste with a spicy blend of herb and citrus behind dry bready cocoa and nuts. Overall, very tasty and drinkable. Worth picking up for a different sort of alt."
"This is an easy to drink beer for it being dark. Also, it only has 5.1% so you can enjoy a few of these."
"Thanks Schells for bringing this wonderful beer back. I really appreciate it. Great style and great beer."
"This is a very tasty and drinkable brew. Recommended for fans of the style as well as english brown ales. Schell's is impressing me with their good beer which sells for a great price. Sessionable, and would be nice to have a few on cool summer's eve or a typical fall evening. Will be revisint this brew as well as sampling other offerings from this brewery."
"D- What a great beer and at 5.1%, I'd be crazy to not call this sessionable. Great job Schells."
"Overall a pretty good beer. Not exactly what I was in the mood for. I may pick this up in doppelbock season. It seemed kind of bockish, but not quite as powerful. This beer didn't make me want to seek an alt out, but I'd give one a try if I saw it."
"overall, i really enjoyed this brew and may buy it again in the future"
"Drinkablity - very drinkable. It would be easy to drink several bottles of this. Well made."
"It's great that August Schell decided to bring back Schmaltz's Alt as part of their Brewer's Select series because it's one of their best beers. Too bad more craft brewers don't try their hand at this style. A sixer every winter isn't out of the question at all."
"This beer pours a dark brown color. The head is light tan in color, creamy, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of caramel, cream, vanilla, and a mild spicy hop note. The taste is maltier than the aroma, and the hops aren't noticable. Th mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a nice beer. I could easily drink this again."
"The taste is surprisingly sweet. The caramel and dark fruit are upfront being backed up by a roasted, slightly smokey malt flavor. I would of prefered the malt to be more pronounced and the sweetness cut back. But it still is a very nice tasting beer. No hint of alcohol. It has a medium body and a creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is slightly out of whack by being heavily carbonated for the style. I would buy this again."
"Alcohol could have been a tad higher for a winter warmer, but an oll round decent beer."
"D - Pretty great tasting beer and smells nice too. One of the best I've tasted from Schell's."
"Poured with a huge, thick, rich, foamy, light tan, luscious, textured head and lots of lace. Odd aroma and flavor of Bavarian weisse beer. Otherwise pretty good beer.Opaque brownish black. Very soft flavors and body. Very good carbonation. Could be a session beer."
"Verdict: one of my favorites from Schells, a very sessionable yet dark and creamy beer. A bit dark for an alt, but thats a good spin on it for Schells."
"Schmaltz's Alt was a dark red-brown color with a large light tan head. The head had good retention and left rings of lace in the glass. The aroma was sweet dark malt and a little roasty. The taste was dark malt with a light bitterness, chocolate, roasted grain, and a touch fruity with a dry finish. It was medium-full in body with nice carbonation and creamy mouthfeel. Drinkability was good. It's a good beer that I will definately have again."
"Pours a five finger, light brown head that fades to a shallow layer leaving traces of lace. Deep mahogeny color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Strong malty nose. Starts as sweet molasses becoming balanced at finish, slight burnt molasses aftertaste. New label has ABV at 5.1%. $1.29 for a 12oz bottle from John's Grocery Iowa City, IA."
"Very drinkable,refreshing.tasty and enjoyable.Been drinking this beer for over 20 years,never disappointing,saying a lot anymore."
"Appears dark brown with a tan foamy head that left some light speckling of lace as it was consumed. Aroma is sweet with ripe fruits and caramel. Some nuttiness comes out after it warmed a bit as well. The flavor starts with some sweet caramel over fruit and light grains. Notes of light bitterness and nuts come through before the sweet fruit finish. Creamy smooth body makes this go down very easily. A solid very drinkable version of the style that I could see myself drinking more of."
"12 ounce bottle. Schmaltz's Alt pours out a dark brown color topped with a small head. The aroma is chocolatey. The flavor is not what I expected, but still somewhat nice: chocolatey, buttery, and a bit acidic. Some fruity flavors appear at the middle, most notably apple and plum. There is a very light hoppiness. Not as sweet as some alts. Mouthfeel is creamy, just as the label claims. Overall, a very enjoyable beer."
"Dits not bad and very drinkable. Probably no more than three, but a nice one to sip for sure."
"Into a pint glass, pours a nearly black dark brown with ruby tones, good off-white head and thick, sticky lacing. Aroma is malty and nutty, kind of some brown sugar, mild hops, and faint alcohol. Taste is a smooth, creamy walk of caramel malts, thickish nutty, roasted, chocolate malt tones, mild hop bittering for balance, and a cool but warming alcohol finish. Good body, good flavor... nothing fantastic, just an overall good beer."
"I picked this up as part of a mixed 6 pack in order to try another variety of Schell's. This was decent, but nothing special. I felt that this was very similar to a porter as evidenced from my comments above. Slightly above average."
"beer is awesome going to but a 6'er tomarrow."
"Not a bad offering from Schell. Poured out to a very dark brown color with a think white head and some notes of lace. Medium level of carbonation. Aromas of malt, toffee and tamed hops were present. Nice. Flavor was nice but lighter that I expected. Flavors of roasted malts and hops, with wood overtones were very present. Slightly sweet finish. Mouthfeel was generally good, but nothing special. A decent level of drinkability. This is not what I would think of when someone mentions the Altbier style, but it is rather good nonetheless. Recommended."
"D-This sample was a bit smoother than last time but it still has a strange dark burnt malt to the taste. It taste much different that when I used to drink 10 plus years ago. I remember a very nice rounded malt but this one just doesn't have that character."
"Dark brown in color with a creamy, brownish head and a light Brussels lace that cascades down the side of the glass. This alt has a roasted, phenolic aroma. This medium-bodied beer posseses a smooth, rich, malty flavor balanced with just the right amount of bitterness in the finish. Very crisp and clean with a dry, thirst-quenching finish."
"Drinkability and Overall: Not a bad beer, but suffers from the same problem most Shcell brews do - lack of anything special. It's nothing great, nothing to seek out, but still a decent, solid brew."
"Pours a very dark ruby color. Smells of bubblegummy malt. Taste is malty, with a bit of juicy-fruit (I may be imagining that...). All in all, not an impressive beer here. It's tasty enough that I downed it in no time flat, but it's not one I'd buy on a regular basis. Just a decent brew, nothing more."
"Pours a nearly black, dark brown body that loks more like a porter than anything else. Pours with a nice creamy 1/2"" of tan head that has very good retention. Smell is robust with roasted malt and a slight coffee scent. Taste and mouthfeel approach the porter/stout level of body and taste. Good coffee and bready malt flavors with mild acidity present. A truely great beer, and one that I am happy so see return to the Schell's lineup."
"12 oz. bottle: This one pours a very dark brown color. Some light manages to pass through it. There was very liottle head on my example. What was there was tan and died out quickly. The aroma is mainly that of chocolate. Some sweetness coming through also. The taste is a bit roasty, with a subdued sweetness. A hint of fruits in the tsate also. Im sure that ther are hops in there, but they are overpowered by everything else. Decent."
"I would have rated this higher if I was rating in general terms, but versus others in the style it just didn't have the hops. I think it would have been better classified as a brown ale or almost a porter."
"This brew is a black colored liquid, some red hues when held to light, with a small tan head on top. The scent is dank chocolate malts. The taste of this guy is roasted/chocolate malt,soome fruit tones, nice bitter hop bite, medium mouthfeel, creamy. I would have almost thought this was a stout if it had a thicker feel to it. Good beer."
"I seemed to like this beer more than many others who also reviewed this beer,pours a nice medium/dark brown with a decent slightly off white head.Aroma is buttery with some light malty fruitiness,taste is very buttery with some big toffee notes and as it warmed it turned into a raisin like flavor.I think a real nice beer if drank at a good temp a nice find."
"Slight smell of musty shoe leather. Slight pale tan head. Deep dark purple color. Flat plainish malt taste that is not interesting at all.. there is a slightly sour burnt kettle finish to the taste as well. Shockingly tranparent mouth as well. not one i think is very drinkable..."
"Brown with garnet highlights, maybe too dark for this style. Kind of falls into the ""dark beer"" category, but then there's a surprising smoky quality, too. A taste of adjunct also appears to be involved. I guess Schell's is trying to stride that middle line between liquor stores and beer geeks (I got mine at an Iowa liquor store because the ones in Minnesota were closed for Sunday), so this comes off a little less than it could be."
"It's says on the label a dark German style ale, I was expecting a deep copper due to the alt style, but this one takes on a similar appearance as a Schwarzbier. deep ruby with a tan head leaves efficient lacing nice full rings at that. Aroma contains some fruity tones based from the malt but there is an astringent metallic offness in the background. Taste conists of darker roasts subtle fruit notes and a standoftish hop character, overall quite nice rolling toasted malts. Mouthfeel conists of soft chewy texture medium bodied ale not bad at all. Drinkability I am fine with just one nice beer but I prefer more pronounced flavors nothing from the August Schell Brewing is of Shock and Awe nature."
"Color of very dark leathery brown nearly black with amber highlights, small but thickly loose tannish top that fades down and leaves minimal spotty lace. Smell is faint mild roasty malts, kinda woodish and wet dirt-like must. Taste is mild, somewhat subdued but present of roasted malts, maybe black malts as well, quite clean with a smokey softness, a bit of cocoa and a over all mineral like taste with a lingering dry finish thats a bit nutty. Feel is a light-medium body, quick thin start, quick thin finish. Nothing to overwhelming, its a very easy roasty calm beer that could be better in the taste but is still a good drinker, goes well with a grilled burger."
"Pours a clear very dark coca-cola color with a very nice dense tan head. The smell is earthy and grassy malt aroma. The taste has a hint of smoke, roasted malts with a burnt aftertaste, mild hops, and hints of chocolate. It is full bodied with a rich taste and finishes with a lightly dry bitter end. This is a pretty tasty beverage IMO. Thanks to budgood1 for this! Cheers!"
"A big, dense, tan head is noisy, but slow. There's some spotty lacing. The beer is dark coffee brown. The toffee in the nose is slathered with butter and sugar. Toffee in the front, with some coffee and a bit of chocolate. The thick, fruity, malty, toffee middle turns dark for the bitter chocolate finish. That butter from the nose comes back in the aftertaste, where some fruit shows up again. Excellent. Thanks to feloniousmonk for sharing."
"Deep garnet hue, with brilliant, cold conditioned clarity. Light tan, frothy head settles into a thin, muddled layer that manages loose lace. Caramel sweetness with a hint of roasted malt along with mildly herbal hops in aroma. Mellow, dryish waft of cocoa adds depth. Stately, caramel malt sweetness initially in flavor is immediately tapered by hop and roasted grain bitterness. Dominate malt character mirrors the aroma, being comprised of powered cocoa. Slight, raisiny fruitiness complements the mild roasted grain presence, adding complexity. Dry, well attenuated, perhaps overly so. Trace floral noble hop presence. Roasted grain bitterness grows progressively stronger and by the finish becomes lightly astringent. A crisp, well bittered alt akin to the Sticke style, but just a bit shy in malt character. A touch rough, but certainly quite drinkable. A welcome change of pace. Thanks to Feloniousmonk for the delivery."
"Color is a dark brown, almost black, with a fine, 1"" creamy tan head. Aroma is largely clean and airy, but there are traces of cocoa and nuts. Hops are there, too, but laying low. On the palate, though, they reveal themselves in all their might. Big burst of fruitiness (bananas,and citrus, primarily!), that soon smooths out bigtime. The malt contingent is firm and swiftly becomes large and in charge. That doesn't stop an overriding fruitiness to continue to ride throughout the flavor and the finish. The rest of the drink is a well-rounded, and fruity flavor, with a slightly coppery edge. I'm no expert on alts, but I know what I like, and this is that."
"As it sets in my glass a deep mahogany, almost an opaque brown, the head is commodious, the texture is creamy and light tan in color, as it erodes the lace formed is a thick and sticky sheet upon the glass. Lots of malt in the nose, sweet caramel, a tad peatish, fresh and appealing, the start sweet, and the top lean in its feel. Finish is stinging in its acidity, the hops pleasing to the palate, dry and lingering aftertaste, a quite quaffable beer at any rate."
"Thanks feloniousmonk for the bottle!"
"Pours a nice light brown color with a large and thick head which maintains nicely throughout. A nice aroma of roasted malts, some light hops are slightly noticed. The taste of caramel and black barley malts are followed by a nice light, yet sweet taste of chocolate, the hops are tasted towards the finish. Medium bodied, but full flavor, a great alt, a great beer!"
"Brown color with a nice frothy head ,roasty malty caremel aroma, , taste of chocolate and caremel, a very balanced Alt, not bad, very good for the style, at $5.99 a sixer I would buy this one agian, great price for a decent beer."
"An interesting beer, but not very complex. Pours out to a amber, almost brown color. Somewhat sweet with a light hop presence on the finish. I honestly can say I liked it but wished it were a little more flavorful. The Schell Brewery is a nice thing for the folks in Minnesota and the Midwest to have around."
"Pours to a deep brown color with an off-white head. Leaves a nice lace-work when sipped down. The nose is one of roasted malt. The taste is rich, malty, roasty, with hints of chocolate. The malt flavors are nicely balanced by the hop flavor and bitterness. Unfortunately in the bottle I tasted I detected a metallic flavor in the finish. This was a medium-full bodied beer, big and malty; overall a tastey beer."
"Deep ruby in color.  Nice looking, but no head.  The aroma was malt with a hint of spicy hops.  The flavor was pretty simple, hopped/spicy malt.  The mouthfeel was thin, with short lasting flavor.  Because it is light, it is fairly drinkable.  Not bad, but Schell makes better offerings."
"This beer is a deep deep copper color.  Pretty dark for an alt.  The slight beige head becomes only a colar in seconds.  Lacing is negligible.  A fairly distinct hoppy nose on this alt.  The taste is very nice, but a little different than I'd expect from an alt.  It doesn't have that nice mellow characteristic typical of cold lagered alts.  What is does have is a nice blend of herbal hop notes and roasted malt tones.  This is one of the more roasty alts I've had.  Medium-full in body.   Pretty tasty beer here."
"A good stab at an alt, but not my favorite.   I'd like to see more of these type of beers around"
"This was one of the first beers I tried from this brewery and have always had a fondness for it, although it may not be a classic example for the style, and not the best Schell's beer.  The label has always appealed to me.  Color is dark brown with reddish-amber hue in the light.  Head is sufficient and darker in color.  Aroma is light overall, mostly malt with light fruitiness and a bit of hops.  Taste is fairly full, much more malt than hops and not particularly bitter.  Finish is somewhat dry with a quality of hard water and slightly metalic taste.  Nice medium mouthfeel, and some richness to the drink.  A beer I'll continue to buy."
"Put a little Schmaltz in your life. This altbier is darker and maltier than the average alt and is in many ways more of a porter than an altbier. Has a very deep dark reddish brown color, pleasant light roasted malt aroma featuring faint licorice and chocolate notes. The wonderfully rich roasted malt flavor is very tasty with a good body, and long creamy finish."
"The last time I had this was close to five years ago and I remember liking it even back then.  My experience tonight is not so good.  I get a definite fruity aroma, and sweet fruity taste with some chocolate tones.  This in no-way compares to the Alaskan Alt I had a few weeks ago.  I thought I may have a bad date but after checking the code thanks to a post on the forum it appears it is relatively fresh...Certainly not a horrible experience but I expected much more.  One of my least favorite Schell's beers.  I will try the rest and upgrade this review if it is warranted but right now this slightly above 3.0 rating may be a bit steep."
"I look forward to Alts but this one was a little dissappointing in its bold but undefined flavors...good but almost greasy mouthfeel, nice aroma and color...was looking for a little more hop and dryness...too dark and with a more highly defined chocolate tone than any other Alt I have had, and not really to style. Not bad to drink though..."
"looks like a porter without much head.  the nose is restrained which could lead to a variety of perceived aromas if you think hard enough. this is also evident in the taste and mouthfeel. it's too restrained.  the usual depth of coffee, chocolate, caramel, raisins, molasses, fruitcake, with the lightly hopped finish are their.....but it leaves you wanting more.  nothing outrageous, nothing offending."
"Notes: One of the more robust altbiers out there, perhaps a bit too much in the roasted malt flavours. This could easily be confused with a brown porter. None the less a tasty brew that should be tried by all."
