"Poured a light amber color with a little head that leaves some lacing behind. Smells of malts, some hops, but mostly an ether type smell. Taste has a good balance at the presentation till the end where it starts tasting like it smells. Feel is overall pretty smooth. It's a pretty average beer with a different taste."
""
"If you like brown ales and wanted to try it, go for it."
"I dunno.  I remember hearing about Double Bag way back in 2005 or so--back in the day, it was possible for malt bombs to generate buzz, believe it or not.  Maybe my pallet has just been destroyed by the extremeness of the modern beer scene, or maybe this was just an off batch.  Either way, I was let down."

"Flavorful and warming..a very good brew."

"I'm not that familiar with the style, but damn this is a tasty beer. Great malt backbone without being too sweet and a nice mild hop character. Very drinkable at 7.2%."

"I had had it years before and didn't care for it, this one was given to me from the rep, the other may have been old. The malt character jumped right out and there was no hint of the strength. Very tasty, malt sweetness without being too much. It was easy to drink and enjoy. I would like to try more of this style for comparison."

"One of my go-to's, Long Trail is consistently good. I like that it is 7.2%, so you can catch a decent buzz of of 1 or 2, however you can't taste it. Relatively bitter, but something that could get you through your family picnick in a pinch. I reccomend it to all of my beer loving friends."
""
"Nice taste, light for the alcohol content.  Finish is good, with a pleasant aftertaste"
""
"Malty, well crafted, but not my favorite style"
""
""
""
""
"A ""Double Alt"" this is like making an imperial Berliner Weisse. It should never be done. However, it's quite tasty when it's cool outside!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"If you're looking to stick every rating here on at least one beer, this fits the just-above-the-middle-of-the-road rating. It's got a bitter aftertaste that takes away from the initial taste, but not so bitter that it runs it. It's...just above average."
""
"Malta aroma.  Brown in color.  Low bitterness value at 33 ibus.  Penetrating malt flavor lingers on the tongue.  High abv is subtle in the taste.  Not a highly prevalent beer style so don't really know how it stacks up."

"You all sound like a bunch of pinkys up hoity toities...I love this beer and think it kinda feels like milk in my mouth"

"I really enjoy this beer--it's got so many things going for it, including the really nice taste, that they far outweigh the average mouthfeel."

"Very good beer"
"I had one good one, once. It was a 16 oz can and was really tasty. But I've had it again, more times than I could reasonably remember, and all have been awful. Skunky and funky and no bueno. Many bottles, many pints. All terrible except for one. It's almost mythical and actually I keep trying this beer like a sucker, hoping for another good one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- The malt notes are great. They are mellow, but the depth is nice, even after being settled out in lagering. Hop bitterness is great and cuts the sweetness some, but doesn't take over the beer."

"A slight bit of booze at 7.2%, too much sweetness, an interesting mineral back note. Not much hop. I'd pick this over other long-trails, but only in a pinch."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark yellow almost brown with a thick head that lasts for a bit. The smell is very sweet, both from the alcohol as well as the malt. The taste was really nice, balancing the sweet malt with the bitter hops to cancel out a bit of the intense alcohol flavor. I found it very nice and a good sipping beer that is easy to pair with large meals. Would highly recommend."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Not my kind of thing."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a good try from Long Trail at a true Doppelsticke Alt, but I still felt bad for it in the glass next to Freigeist!  It is very hard to duplicate such a delicate German style that is so refined, which is why so few American breweries dabble in them."

"DATE REVIEWED: August 23, 2014... GLASSWARE: Hobgobin stange... OCCASION: Lord of the Rings return to school prep... APPEARANCE: stately brown/orange body; strong, two-finger off-white head; spongy at first, sinewy as it clings to the glass; handsome... AROMA: surprisingly fragrant bouquet from an alt; blanketing caramel malts; some wet leaf and earthy tones... PALATE: heavy, full-bodied and long in its aftertaste; soft hops play at the teeth; palpable yet palatable ... TASTE: vibrant toffee and toast make this a brown with bite; the earthy malts make a course, somewhat complex sip; hops are floral and complimentary ... OVERALL: a Long Trail brew to get behind--a malty ale that brings the weight of 7.2 % ABV subtly; powerful and energizing..."
""
""
"Overall: To me, this essentially tastes like a boozed up Long Trail Ale. It's nice, but I like the approachability of their original a little bit more,"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pleasantly surprised by the smoothness and drinkability."

"T/O: Lots of caramel. Booze makes a showing as well. Orange, blue curacao, very sweet. Bitter builds, light cocoa dusted almond flavor. A little tinny in the finish. One of the maltier beers. Nice grassy and toasty hay tones. Not as dry, crisp, nutty, or bitter as I prefer my altbiers."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a good ale with balance."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: An easy drinking summer beer, tasty and satisfying."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a fairly clear medium amber color with a smallish off white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Aromas of caramel toffee and brown sugar with just a hint of butterscotch. Earthy bitterness in the aroma keeps this in check. The flavor is sweet rich sugars with some melanoids and a bit of burnt sneaking in there. Earthy bitterness with a touch of burnt butter round us out. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. There is a bit of diacetyl here and that usually turns me off to a beer, but this is one of the rare instances where I think it works within the frame of the rest of the brew."
""
""
""
"As someone who enjoys some malty brews, this is a decent attempt."
""
""
"O - A deceptively strong alt-beer perfect for a breezy summer evening. Could wish for a better head but the flavor compensates somewhat."
""
"Dapper, well crafted and simply great! There's a restrained hops character on this that seems to stand back politely."

"Overall: Very good beer. I cant go more than a week or two with a six pack of this. One I will always go back full flavor very drinkable for a fairly high abv beer. Smooth, flavorful, full bodied, and balanced everything I look for in an ale. A must try for anyone who enjoys a good ale."

"I'm drinking this bad boy out of a bottle in a beer glass. The beer is copper colored and I have found that you really have to play with it as you pour in order to get a noticeable head, which is cream colored and retains for about .5 secs. The beer has a faint noticeable smell that is malty maybe with a little fruit. When you taste it there is an initial very malty toffee flavor followed by a smooth hop bitterness and alcohol bite at the end which sometimes persists. This is a beer that stays with you in the back of the mouth, producing continuing flavors after the initial taste. It is very sweet and goes well after dinner. It is tough to drink a lot of these as they are very rich and flavorful."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This isn't my (double) bag, as the scores reflect. Still, I don't hate it. Decent to try if you're looking for something different, but I wouldn't recommend a full 6 pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- a very nice beer, and a good change from all the IPAs I've been having lately. Very very different, as no one part of this beer stands out, but it all comes together well. Definitely something to have again in the future"
""
""
""
"A big, malty beer with enough balance and complexity to keep you interested sip after sip. Heavy on the residual sugars, it tastes and feels much like a barley wine. Deep and inviting for a big beer."
""
""
""
""
"Would have again. Worth getting ahold of."
""
""
""

"Drinks smooth on the palate. It's fairly clean with pretty much no aftertaste."
"o: as mentioned before - its not overly complicated, but all the flavors in here work really well. drinks really smooth, and is quite enjoyable."
""
""
" sometimes sold out. Not real heavy if you don't want a stout but something a little lighter."
""
""
""
"O: Solid brew – well-built and well balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Interesting, but not in the most appetizing way. Could see it growing on me, however. The juxtaposition of the flavors, while not outright complementary, definitely gives one something to mull over."
""
"Overall - A very nice, clean, crisp beer. Definitely malt-heavy without being out of balance. Crisp finish with lingering bitterness keeps you coming back for more. In no way would I guess this was over 7% ABV. It's a bit big for the style (altbier), but it's a great beer."

"O - I'm surprisingly okay with this beer. I was wary of the malt-forwardness coming into my first taste, but it really was pleasant to drink. I wouldn't recommend it for the summer, but thankfully it was cool out tonight. Not bad at all!"

"Overall: This is so readily available around here, I keep on forgetting how good a quality this beer is. This is a nice and sweet malty treat. It is sweet without ever being cloying. I do like this one on the colder side though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Impressed by this one. My favorite from Long Trail"

"Nice commodity altbier with some flair. Doesn't stand alone... but it never dissappoints."
""
"O: Pretty nice altbier. Could drink a lot of this."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Samuel Adams glass. Has a bright, slightly cloudy copper color. Short-lived creamy white head leaves a small amount of lacing. Aroma is rich and sweet, with notes of caramel, bread and fruit. Taste is very similar with just a slight hint of bitter hops on the finish. Has a very small carbonation and nice mouthfeel, not too thin or thick. This is a great big-flavored ale"
""
"Slightly sharp on the abv but drinks quite nice. Really nice brew thats readily available."
""
""
""
"I love this beer. One of my favorites and one that I always keep in my fridge. It is one of my "" go to "" beers. Malt with just the right amount of hops. Delicious."
"Very drinkable in spite of the relatively high abv."
"I had long ignored Long Trail's beers, and now I'm regretting not trying Double Bag sooner. This is surely one beer that will wind up in my fridge time and again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Actually a pretty good offering from Long Trail, I'm not really familiar with this style, but its not what I expected, but it does have a nice complexity in taste that is good and refreshing. Would really like to get this on tap."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Long Trail's altbier is a great beer- not quite a traditional version, but still quite tasty nonetheless. It is better on tap than in the bottle."
"Pours a caramel/amber color with an almost non-existent head which disappears instantly to leave a thin topping. Smells caramel, some cereals, little earthy notes, slightly herbal at the back. Flavors are very mild and clean. Similar to the nose and, in my opinion, not so enjoyable. Moderate carbonation with low bitterness. I didn't like this one. Wonder if it's a bad bottle or I just don't like the style..."
""
""
""
""
"Sweet and biscuity. Incredibly easy drinking and smooth for 7.2%. Always a fan of the Double Bag."
"O: Hands down--by far--Long Trail's best year-round, probably all together. Not to mention the fact that, at just a dollar more than any other LT 6-pack, it is a steal here in Long Trail's home state. One of my choice, go-to VT sixers under $10."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Long Trail's Double Bag shows no signs of being a strong ale with it's nice malty presence and deceptively smooth finish. This is a good beer that straddles the line of ale and lager with characteristics of both coming through."
""
""
"O: Everything works well together, and this is remarkably easy to drink in spite of the abv. I want another, and it's a tough act for the Single Bag to follow."
""
"Nice malty flavor, with some bite, and not too mention the 7.2% ABV kick."
""
""
""
""
""
"My vote is to give it a shot and then move on."
""
""
""
""
"O - an old stand by, one of my go-to brews when I'm not sure what I want. Nice ale with a high alcohol content. Very drinkable. Plus for Vermont."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a tasty beer, but it's a bit sweet and bitter for me for the style. Not exactly a session ale."
"This is an interesting beer, and I might pick some more up sometime."
""
""
""
""
""
"Great beer overall.. I will def be enjoying again soon.."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – It was a decent brew. It had some good malty flavors and a light herbal hop. Worth a try, but nothing that is super exceptional. A decent stronger Alt. style ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark amber in color, with one-finger head which disappears fairly quickly. Clear and very smooth. Malty, with minimal hops. I haven't figured out yet how to describe the smell, but it's clean and fresh. I really like this one. I've switched to this (from Sam Adams Boston Ale) as my default brew, with food or just by itself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a cheap and strong beer but lacks in complexity."
""
""
""
""
""
"Soft amber in color with near perfect clarity. Poured with a short off-white foam that quickly reduced to a wispy cap. Caramel malt, toffee and ripe fruit aromas blend very nicely with delicate floral notes in the background. Soft, silky smooth feel with creamy, rich carbonation. Sweet caramel malt and toffee flavors up front with a tangy floral hop bite through the middle. Toasted malt flavors follow the tangy hop bite as this finishes semi-dry with a lingering biscuity, floral hop bitterness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Altbiers are not my favorite style, but I do like this one. Good cold weather brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"this is a very unique brew. pours thick and milk chocolate brown color. lets just a little light through, and sports a lasting two inch head. smells like dark german malts, caramel, and crusty bread. the flavor is very malt forward without much sweetness. the alcohol content is very well hidden. it can be felt but not tasted. mouthfeel works well, rich and creamy beer but somehow drinkable to the max. full bodied but not heavy, moderate carbonation. this is one of the best long trail brew is my opinion, and im glad they started making it available all year. great with a nice hearty meal on an early fall night."
""
""
"Bottle poured into a Sam Adams glass. Clear amber with a thick, lingering off-white head; good lacing. Notes of malt, biscuit, maybe something like a dark fruit in there, no real hop notes coming through. Sweet tasting with just a bit of hop bitterness on the finish that gradually builds. Very smooth beer. Highly drinkable considering the high alcohol content and initial sweetness."

"O - Delicious altbier. Highly drinkable, alcohol is masked well. Definitely one of the best examples I've had for this style."
""
""
"(originally reviewed: 07-13-2011)"
"O: This is a very enjoyable beer that hides the alcohol very well. A pretty good example for the style, though I'm probably a little more harsh in reviewing it than others after having spent a couple of weeks in Dusseldorf drinking altbiers."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a yellow-orange color with a white head. The aroma is fairly bland, with some biscuit malt and not much else. The flavor is also lacking, with some bread, grain and a hint of grass. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not much going on here."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bought a six-pack at Table and Vine. Has a light, clear-brown appearance with a lasting lacing on the side. Aromas are quite strong with alcohol, malt, caramel, and some fruit flavoring. Maybe some burnt sugar or a maple flavor? Taste is great with a sweet, definitely maple flavor. Mouthfeel has a slight dairy feel, but it is pretty light and drinkable. Overall, a fantastic drink."
"Notes: Drank on 5/5/2012."
"Mouthfeel is good- medium body, light to moderate carbonation of the soft, concentrated variety. Surprisingly good beer."
""
"Very smooth and drinkable beer...definitely a beer that tilts toward the malty side of the scale but without becoming sickly sweet...and it still has some balance at the end."
"Poured into a 13 oz tulip glass, bottled on leap day 2012. Pours a clear orange red, with a 3 inch sticky off white head, lacing all over. Smell is biscuit, carmel, brown sugar, some pine hops, and figs. Taste is very balanced, lots of malts with a touch of hops in the finish. The body is medium large, plenty of life, more lush than dry, and very drinkable. This is very nice, I remember when this beer seemed giant, now it is easy going down."
""
""
""
""
"O: juxtaposes a variety of flavors, yet ends up being simple and accessible, and just remarkably pleasant, no matter what your level of sophistication or momentary proclivities may be. beautiful."
""
""
""
"O: Aww, I don't want to leave on a negative note, so I'll say that I like you a lot Long Trail, but I think I'd rather stick with your flagship brew. Double Bag ain't bad, but if I want something on the slightly stronger, slightly sweeter side, I think I'd rather have a Geary's Hampshire Special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Full and creamy mouthfeel with very concentrated and well blended flavors. deep complexity, notes of toffee and caramel, a touch of phenolics, some dark fruit, enough floral hop bitterness to make the finish clean and dry. Not a touch of detectable alcohol which is impressive. My standard go to beer at my local watering hole since they have it on tap. Good stuff."
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, bright, crisp, orange-copper coloring with a bit of filmy head on the pour that disappears almost instantly, leaving behind a ring of film around the edge of the surface. Caramel and toffee aromas richly sweeten the slight toasting on the nose. Flavors are rich and smooth, with a creamy blending of cream and toffee forming the backbone. Toasty, rich overtones, with a sweetness similar to SugarDaddy. The aftertaste is toffee rich, with a crisp, roasted finish. Very tasty brew, and surprisingly easy to drink with the richness of the flavors."
""
"O-A good beer that I wish has a little more bite."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, very nicely done beer, a little sneaky with this abv but the flavors work very well from the bottle."
"Nice flavors and drinkability here. I am surprised by the ABV; cant even tell its 7.2%. This is a good session brew. A good malt heavy brew when you desire all malts. Very good stuff here."
"O - Decent beer. I'm not a big fan of most of the german styles because I think they lack the full flavor I am looking for. I probably won't get it again, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle an iced tea-ish brown color with a 1/2 finger foam that settles into a medium collar. Carbonation appears to be very light...not many bubbles. Aroma is of slightly sweet caramel malt. 1st sip brings a rather dry flavor that somewhat belies the aroma. Mouthfeel is right down the middle, not heavy or watery. Overall, a nice brown ale."
""
""
""
"I'm pretty new to beer tasting, so it would have been nice to have some tasting notes on the Long Trail website."
""
""
""
""
"You get a bit of the alcohol taste and burn at the end of the sip as well but the velvety smooth rich malty taste melded together with that slight herbal hop quality will definitely have me getting this beer again in the future."
"Overall it's pretty good but not spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I enjoy trying Altbiers and Long Trail's version is very nice...the caramel flavors really stand out and are supported nicely throughout the beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a rusty copper color with almost zero head in my snifter glass. Minimal lacing as well. This beer is fairly clear, in spite of the fact it's a darker beer. The nose is caramel malt, nutty aroma, and that's about it. Fairly weak nose on this beer. The taste follows suit, with a little bit of hops thrown in. The feel is thin, with a nutty aftertaste. Overall, I'm not a fan of this beer. Glad I got to try the style though. Cheers."
""
"O: this is a good beer for its style and good to me"
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes: Nice surprise. Finding this on tap locally was very pleasing. I´d sure love to try a bottled version."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall enjoyable American try of a rare German style. Easy drinking tasty brew with lots of flavors dancing on your tongue. Only thing kind of disappointing is the nose isn't as good as the taste buds say it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very good beer. Could use a bit more carbonation, but other then that, solid."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this one is a keeper. I first bought a case last year and was extremely impressed. It's no surprise that I had no apprehension in picking it up again this winter, as well I imagine I will purchase it again in the future. Very nice work long trail!"
""
""
""
"D: An intriguingly sweet & richly malty “sticke” style alt. Certainly not as darkly or robustly malty as many stabs at the sub-style, but rich nonetheless. I like the estery, fruity sweetness. Very drinkable and potent with a well disguised 7.2 % abv."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just a really tasty beer. I've only had the Hibernator before this. I was a little worried it wouldn't be to my taste due to my preference for porters, but I was pleasantly surprised. As a caveat, it is very filling. I would recommend taking one's time with it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I've not had this style before, and that will change starting this weekend. Very good beer, especially on a cold winter night."
""
""
""
""
"O: A really nice beer for the post winter months. Well crafted."

"I paid $7.99 for a six pack and feel like I just robbed a bank. A big ""cheers"" to Long Trail for making a mighty fine altbier (er, stickebier, according to the label). I think I found a new ""go to"" beer -- I must keep a few of these around at all times."

"D - There's nothing here for me to get too excited about, but its balanced and lacks flaws so I could have a few more, and it was worth the addition to the mix and match six pack."

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty caramel color with a small head. Smell is of grains, some sweetness. Taste is malts, grains, some bitterness at the finish, different but in a good way. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"91."
"VERY NICE, WORTH GETTING!"
"Overall: I liked this beer a lot. Even though there was not much going on in the nose, taste and mouthfeel made up for that characteristic. Will enjoy more of these in the future."
"Nice clear amber in appearance. This beer has a nice aroma that serves it well. The feel on the mouth is ok, lingers a little, but not to bad. The taste is very nice and clean. Overall we feel that Long Trail has done it again. nice beer. This beer will go well with a good sweet ham or pork chop."
"D - this one might throw off people who aren't accustomed to bold and complex brews. would not recommend as a first or even 30th beer for a beginner, but longtime enthusiasts can easily find something to get behind within this one"
"O - The only other beer of this style I have had is Alaskan Amber, and this compares very nicely with it. Not up to par with it, but still a pretty good beer. Readily available and fairly cheap. I would definitely get this again."
"O- A very light beer, the wateriness is not pleasant. The malt flavors would be nice but they die out far to quickly and there is no complexity to the flavor. Not very drinkable"
"My second bottle was better... My fiancée finally put some shoes on."
"Very nice beer for the style"
"O- A singular beer for the most part- not too many other locals like this one. Always worth a buy. Great to have a few of, but it sneaks up on you quick!"
"Overall: A very nice little brew. Cheap and available in NYC and big bonus points to LTBC for adding such an overlooked style in their regular lineup."
"For an alt, especially a sticke version, this is pretty tame stuff. Smells of caramel malt and little else. Taste is again pretty malty, but there's just not a lot going on here. Buttery and bready with very light leafy and baked apple notes. Clean and crisp for sure- obviously a brew constructed with care- but not something I'd revisit."
"The sweet honey-like malty backbone could easily double as a dopple bock. The German citrusy and metallic tangy Nobles hops and Alt yeast are what keeps this in the Altbier family. The 7.2% ABV makes it a Sticke."
"Bottoms up!"
"Final Thoughts: This is good simplicity. Not folling with out there flavors, just making a good brew. Enjoy this one deep in the fall/start of winter. It would be perfect. Great brew Long Trail."
"I'm usually unimpressed with Long Trail, but this is actually a quality beer. It's really tasty. Try the triple bag!"
"Overall: This beer is stunning. I'm currently doing a road trip thru the North East and turning it into a beercation. So now my big dilemma is: Should I continue sampling other NE brews, or should I head back to Sam the Beer Man in Binghamton and Buy a shit-load more Double Bag Longtrail? Oh how I suffer."
"Overall: A bit much for me. Taste is overly sweet and leaves you feeling very heavy. First time I had one of these was by surprise. I don't think i finished it. Decided to give it another chance when i wasn't already drinking. Still a no. I wont get this again."
"This is one really tasty altbier for sure!"
"This is a great brew. I would certainly consider adding this to my regular rotation. The stronger ABV is well hidden, making this a very enjoyable brew for anytime of the year."
"O- This is a great great beer. It's the first German Alt i've ever had, so i'm not sure about style guidelines, but i'd definitely buy more of this. Lot's of complex flavors, and they come together well."
"overall a very nice altbier. doesn't move the earth but it's tasty; a very solid offering from long trail."
"O: I'm enjoying this beer more now that I'm really paying attention to it, but I still don't think this beer is anything more than an enjoyable yet unremarkable New England local. It's pretty easy to find Double Bag in this neck of the woods, so if you're up here, it may be worth trying a bottle, but otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way to obtain it."
"Alcohol of 7.2% is not noticed in the nose or taste but does show up with a warming after glow."
"Another fun find on tap at My Place in Newtown, CT, this one shows a deep copper color, clear with yellow highlights, a decent white head and great lacing. The aroma says wheat and thin yeasty malt. Not my favorite but reasonable for the style I suppose. The flavor brings lemony malt and honey sweetness. There’s a little licorice edge almost a bock. Interesting and consistent with my previous enjoyment form bottles. It's medium-light bodied with modest carbonation and a fairly aqueous feel. It’s got a tart quality, a bit of citrous hops perhaps, but very subtle. Nice drinkable brew with some personality."
"O: pretty forgettable."
"O - This may or may not be the only Altbier I have had. Either way, it is a nice refreshing brew. Could (and have) definitely have a few of these at a time"
"Poured into my ccb pint glass. Pours a clear amber color with no head. Aroma of caramel, malts, sweetness. Taste follows the nose, slight amount of hops present. Sweet beer, easy to drink, hides alcohol well. Not bad at all just not a lot of complexity."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are nice and complex and very balanced at the same time. The mouthfeel is just right with very nice balance."
"Nutty up front with some cranberry, very smooth though as it coats the mouth with malty, buttery bread notes. Ends dry with a bite of floral and citrus hops. an excellent brew."
"My cousin picked up a bottle and we split it between ourselves. The color was pretty nice, it poured as a transparent brown color with a fizzy tan head on it that turned into just a little film over top of the beer. The smell of the beer is mostly grains and malts. The taste is a little bit light. I wasn't able to really pull too much from the flavors in there besides some grains and caramel. The mouthfeel was light and drinkable. This brew didn't really impress me all that much. I'd try it again if I could."
"Pours a filtered, clear copper with a bubbly, thick creamy head. Long lasting retention with foamy clumps of lacing. Aroma is caramel and nutty malt, light butterscotch and faint leafy hops. Creamy smooth body with light carbonation and a sticky butterscotch sweet finish. Toffee and caramel malt sweetness dominate the flavor with a leafy and earthy hop flavor in the finish (but not particularly bitter). A little sweet, but the depth of the toasted malts are pleasant and is the best Long Trail beer I've had to date."
"Poured a burnt copper color with a thin white layer of a head. Toasted malt aroma with hints of caramel. Caramel malts on the tongue, with light graininess, and some hop bitterness balancing things out. Medium bodied with a bit of a metallic aftertaste, but overall drinkable."
"Nice light body on this. A little bit on the side of low carbonation. Overall, a good beer hear. I'm relativly unfamiliar with the style so I'd be interested to see a few more."
"the hops are somewhat subdued, but then again, so are the malts. A very drinkable, but not particularly memorable, beer for me."
"Grabbed one of these at the Foundry. A dark copper color with a lot of frothy head. A pretty light and simple body. A balanced amount of sweet caramel malts with a floral hop aroma. The hops are subdued compared to the malty sweetness. Malts are present but take a back seat to the hops in the taste. However the body is balanced well. A toasty body that compliments the pretty intense hop flavors."
"O: Good stuff! I had some wasabi mix on hand, which was a good choice."
"This is a nice strong brew from Long Trail that always hides it's true ABV."
"D: Nice complete flavors, it tends a bit on the sweeter side which makes it a bit less drinkable than the flavor warrants."
"Dr. So very easy to drink this. Love it."
"A pretty interesting and different beer that I quite enjoyed."
"Nice amber color but thin quickly disappearing head. Smell wasn't great kind of metallic. Taste was nice, creamy and malt with some late hoppy and alcohol hints. Mouthfeel was milky with light cling. Very drinkable recommend a few at a time to get good feel for it."
"Overall I like this beer very much. This is one of the better offerings from Long Trail in my opinion."
"Good and interesting beer."
"Cheers!"
"D: A nicely balanced, flavorful beer. Some enjoyable subtlety/complexity to this one, but it's a pretty easy drinker and a nice version of a somewhat uncommon style. Accessible for being a fairly big beer."
"Unfortunately, that's the only drawback to this beer. It's strong but you won't realize it until the whole bottle is down and the alcohol kicks in. It looks, smells, and tastes like a session beer but this isn't one by any stretch of the imagination. I could easily have more than one in a sitting but not if I was out with my friends. For the wintertime when you're stuck at home, this is a great choice to warm up and mellow out to. It's a shame that this style isn't more readily available around here but there's no need to worry - Long Trail has it nailed and for any lovers of Altbiers, this will suffice quite nicely!"
"D: The beer is very drinkable for the style because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste."
"Drink is decent, a slight bit of booze but good for 7.2%, a bit of sweetness and minerality, the herbal hop flavors don't go as well as I remember. In fact this beer is not as much like I remember it. I remember it being a lot more malty, perhaps my tastes are a lot different and more in tune, or perhaps it has to do with the freshness as I was probably used to drinking older ones and this was bottled 12/22/10 so barely 5 weeks old."
"An interesting beer, lots of sweetness without being too cloying. More caramel and estery, maybe not estery actually but might be from the hops."
"D: High alcohol percentage notwithstanding, it goes down very nicely for a beer of this strength."
"Waiting to try another Double Alt."
"Pours a light brown color into the glass. My glass had a very small amount of white head that quickly dissipated. Smells immediately of bready biscuit, some caramel and toffee. Light floral notes are present as well. Upon drinking I sense a big malt backbone with the caramel and toffee really standing out. Also a hint of honey. Really smooth beer, drinks incredibly easily. I can't believe the ABV is over 7%. Drinks more like a beer around 4%. Feels like a top notch session beer with the ABV so well hidden, just don't let it sneak up on you."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was a golden color and it poured a thin brown head. The head was gone instantly. The beer had a caramel smell with a big hoppy smell sitting on top of that. Caramel notes on the finish but hops blew that away. I will not buy again."
"Pours a golden light brown with good tan head and carbonation on top of a candi-sugar sweet malt aroma like caramel and toffee. The beer is real smooth and creamy with a good sweet malt taste of caramel and toffee a I swear I'm picking up vanilla. A bready dryness is evident as well, maybe a roasted/toasted malt as well as some stickiness. Picking up minor hop fruit flavors that are bitter and I think I'm getting some apple. Must say the higher ABV is well hidden and the beer has a good dry yet crisp finish."
"D-Very drinkable, so far the best offering from Long Trail. I was reluctant to pick this up after having tried their Ale, IPA, Belgian White and Blackberry beers in a mix pack but this one was great."
"Aromas of sweet biscuity maltiness and significant notes of earthy, herbal and citrus hops. A slight caramel taste with a bitter and sweet aftertaste. Malts were evident and pretty sweet, but the taste of caramel was more evident. A pretty equal balance upon further review. Though malty at first sip, hop bitterness follows quickly. The alcohol warmth isn't strong but is quite pleasant. I would describe it as slippery, medium-bodied, and yet at the same time enormously clean and refreshing. A good solid hops, slight maltiness, hints of fruits and some alcohol. Overall this is a well made beer that comes very close to being excellent."
"Pours a clear copper with a small white head that settles into a collar. The nose has some honey and grain, but not much else. Flavors of bold toasty and caramel malts that are Perfectly balanced with a woody, tea-like bitterness. Elegant in its simple but balanced flavor construction."
"D: Very drinkable. Disguises the abv well. Flavorful, smooth and balanced."
"d - A pretty good alt. Didn't blow me away and not my favorite beer from Long Trail, but it's well made and has a great mouthfeel. Would drink again."
"Transparent amber with a beige head. Smells is herbal not anything offensive but nothing outstanding either. Taste is bitter sweet. Pleasantly so. Has a bit of a burn. I could drink this one down easily. I'd recommend this to someone looking for something different."
"Long Trail has a winner here! Lots of complex fruit esters melded with an excellent malt profile. I wish I would have picked up a six pack of his stuff."
"d- overall this is a pretty good beer that has just enough bite to it and plenty of taste to it"
"Beer is nice, its a great great alt. Medium bodied, interesting late flavors from the yeast, mild bitterness mild sweetness, complete beer, nice connectivity. A great beer all around."
"Ruby red in sunlight. My go-to for quite a while, about sixer per week. Overtones of caramel and molasses. Sweet, malty body. Overall a strong, reliable and distinctive ale, accessible enough for guests you may have at dinner, but not quite complex enough to inspire mystery in this noob."
"D: Pretty drinkable for a 7.2% ABV.... Great flavors and very easy to drink. Worth looking for."
"O: This is a nostalgic beer for me. My wife and I went camping in Canada and split a warm sixer of this after sitting in the front row of the Sting / Annie Lennox concert. I will always have a soft spot for this beer. Good stuff."
"D: For a high ABV beer, this is unbelievably drinkable. The alcohol content is almost undetectable which makes this a great beer to have on hand."
"Poured into a pint glass. The pour is a light amber with some brown streaks. White head. The nose is a bit nutty with some slightly-toasted malt, caramel, and a bit of earthy hops. The flavor is light malt, chopped peanuts, toffee, and light earth. Decent body. One of the better brews that I've had from Long Trail. Not a bad beer at all."
"Definitely drinkable. This would make a good fall six pack."
"The drink on this one might be a little high for some. Its a stong drink , if you haven't had a altbier like this before. Its a great brew for those who seek out this kind style. Not quite what you expect from a altbier though, seems to be a bit on there own style. Still a decent brew, I would certianly have again."
"A very drinkable beer, and an affordable one as well."
"also widely available in my area, and a great value for the ABV."
"D: A tad too sweet for me overall, but a nice beer that should be tried."
"Poured from a bottle. A light brown body with a thin white head that rapidly dissolves to just a sparsely bubbled coat. Sweet, malty nose with just a hint of citrus. A mouth full of bready malts, honey and some earthy hops. Light-medium body with plenty of carbonation. Very deceptive at 7.2%. Easy drinking beer. Long Trails describes this as a strong ale, but here it's an altbier. Not what I would typically consider mistakable for a strong ale."
"Final Note - Fall certainly comes to mind with this one, but I'd enjoy one no matter the season."
"Gotta say, this beer impressed me. Malty and sweet, with some biscuity yeast flavors. Low level of carbonation helps create a nice, creamy, dry finish. Def a bit of bitter hops in the mix too. This reminds me of a really good, flavorful Marzen. Typically not a Long Trail fan, but this is a good brew. Also, the 7.2% abv is well hidden--very drinkable."
"I really wanted to like this, but I just don't. It doesn't seem, to me, like they stayed true to the styler, either. It seems like they tried to do something a touch different, which is commendable. Unfortunaely, risk sometimes rewards and sometimes it doesn't. I don't think that it has, this time."
"D-I enjoy the taste but for me the drinkablility is not extremely high. A bit too boozey and not my favorite style but still goes down easy enough."
"goes down well. very well for a 7+% beer, where the booze stays in the background as a supporting feature. one of the better alt biers I have had, and one I shouldn't pass over so often."
"I would say this beer hits the spot after a long day raking leaves."
"Quality product"
"Absolutely can't believe its 7.2% Tastes much softer."
"That being said, excellent strong brew. Mine had great head, but not so much lace. Great autumn brew."
"Note: I have had this beer in both 12 oz. bottles and 22 oz bottles, the 22 oz bottles always taste better, and less bitter, I have no idea why, but this has been consistant over multiple trails. This is one of my favorites."
"Mouthfeel is crisp and plenty rich for the style. Drinkability is good. I did not notice the 7.2% at all. I suppose it is necessary to get the good strong flavor. I would drink a few of these...Very nice!!!"
"Don't notice the 7% abv alcohol at all."
"D-Very drinkable. It goes down very smooth. I am very glad I had the oppertunity to try this. Thanks Jason! Holla! lol"
"Impression: With fine examples like this it is mysterious how this style isn't more popular."
"HV"
"A nice refreshing brew with a slight amber color to it. A slight taste of carmel with just the right amount of carbonation. A slight bitter after taste that goes away quickly. It goes well with most meals I've had it with and doesn't overpower the food. Also oddly refreshing. A beer that I highly recommend to anyone."
"Overall an interesting beer for. Glad I had the opportunity to try it."
"Drinkability - very drinkable, this is a good beer to just relax with. its smooth refreshing and full of flavor, everything I look for in a beer."
"Minimal head, but beautiful dark amber color, fruity/spicy nose, smooth mouthfeel. I did get a hint more alcohol on the palate which is the only thing that kept my ""taste"" rating at 4 instead of 4.5, but overall this was a very good brew."
"D - A great beer if you're in high school. Otherwise, a pretty shallow offering. Kinda gross. Real musty. Not fresh tasting at all. Imagine licking a storm cellar that's never been frequented in 20 years. Yeah."
"From a 12 oz bottle to a glass. Rich copper color, minimal head. Very clear indeed. Smells of molasses and caramel. Nice malt undertones. Taste is rich and thick. No real hop taste or bitterness. Slightly metallic aftertaste. The taste that lingers is less pleasant than the initial taste, more metallic. Drinkability is average due to its heaviness, but still lovely."
"Everything is so understated in this one that it would be easy to overlook as a relatively boring beer. With a little bit of attention the complexity however is more obvious."
"D: Easy to drink and very smooth. Could easily be a session beer if you take your time with them. Just can get very filling."
"D: I enjoyed this beer. The taste didn't quite life up to the smell, but this was a very smooth and easy drinking beer, but also fairly complex."
"Overall - Really enjoyed this, a bit high in the alcohol range but it doesn't stick out too badly. Just a very enjoyable beer overall."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium with a medium finish. I really like the flavors and the contrasts in this beer. It is really easy to drink and I am very glad I got to try it."
"Overall, an awesome beer. The first one I have tried from Long Trail and apparently, after this one, I need to try more! A delicious blend of sweet gloriousness in a glass."
"Its a hit, Long Trail never fail! This beer, best in Bombers, looks beautiful, a lot of beers are said to look amber (there is a huge array natural amber color and tones, even green from certain places in the Caribbean, and Europe) that being said, this is what most people think of when they think amber, its clear and you can see right through, but the color, like honey amber. Its head isn't overwhelming, but present, and honey white in color. It smell like none other, its mild almost sweet and smells somewhat like bananas. The taste is good, it not harsh in any way, it doesn't taste nearly as alcoholic as it is, again, like its smell its somewhat sweet, (but no banana taste, so far as I can tell). The mouthfeel is strong and crisp, the way I like it. Overall, this beer is very very drinkable, so much so that you might not realize its high alcohol content after putting back a several pints until the buzz hits you strongly. Delicious, thank you Long Trail."
"Good Beer, different than what I usually drink, malty, smooth, almost carmel tasting. The only thing I didn't like about it was the finish, goes down smooth with a bit of a taste left in the back of your mouth at the end, could be the malt, that stays there a while. All in all a good beer, easy to drink, great pour, and amber color, and body. I would get this again, strong ABV as well, gives a good buzz. Cheers."
"Really refreshing for a 7% ABV, and quite drinkable. Had no idea what to expect with this one, as a friend dropped it off in my fridge about 3 months ago, and I'm just getting around to trying - the hops have really held up well."
"Oh how I love me a double bagger. Obviously youre dealing with a strong brew here, but fortunatly not with the negative side affects that usually accompany one. Pours a robust dark reddish brown with a solid long lasting head. Clearly brings the funk, but finishes with the grace of a Lawrence Taylor half time crack hit. If OE or Steel Reserve were to get you drunk with class and quality ingrediants, they would do it along the lines of a Double Bag. Press play on the cow phunk and let me ride baby!!"
"An excellent after beer after snowboarding. Not particularly drinkable: the flavors are simple and strong more than pleasant and interesting."
"Drinkability: A great beer all-round. I read a bit about the style, Alt-Sticke kinda thing. Bottle says strong ale. This is a beer that really crosses styles, Brown Ale, Alt, Strong Ale. Overall its a really subtle brew and also a very strong one. You'll never notice the ABV in taste or aroma but it'll sneak up on you. Never sweet or bitter. Malty with faded floral and fruit notes. A relaxed brew with a higher Alcohol content, I recommend drinking this on a cold night when you're not feeling something as complex as an Imperial stout, Barleywine, or Dark Belgians."
"A good brew, but certainly more American than Alt."
"From the 22 fl. oz. bottle with a marking of 110209-2226. Sampled on January 25, 2010. Served at about 45 degrees. It pours a beautiful ruby red color with fantastic clarity and about two fingers of fronty, foamy, soapy off-white head and a decent amount of lacing along the glass. The aroma is not terribly enticing and quite frankly reminded me of paint thinner with a dash of floral hops. But the mouthfeel and taste turned around the initial impression with a medium, chewy mouthfeel and a mildly hopped taste with a dry finish. Once I got around the aroma I liked it."
"Very nice overall sweet malty flavor, but not outstanding in any way. An enjoyable beer with mid-range flavor that's quite drinkable considering the ABV, but it's just above average taste-wise."
"ah, double bag. how you've let me down. i really used to love this beer and now it seems it isn't quite as good as i remember. kind of tastes like a shipyard or something. not what it used to be, but worth a try if you haven't had it yet."
"Though somewhat doughy to finish, this is still an enjoyable, if heay, quaff for any cold winter afternoon - or perhaps, after a day on Vermont's verdant slopes. (See also my BeerFly review for Long Trail.)"
"All around good beer, but the constant theme is that the last taste is far worse than the first."
"Drinkability - Unique...but I couldn't see myself drinking more then 1; so I would say it is low."
"As I progress through the multitude of beers and ales of the world, I find beers I've never seen before and try them out. This one was a great find. Nice pour, nice color, nice flavor, interesting bottle labels, all aimed at catching and holding the beer drinker. Who can resist a double udder cow? More and more I find the micro-brews best, with most of the ""big beers"" a waste of money. Having a recent trip to Germany, with octoberfest a big part of it, this one would meet the German taste test easily."
"Honey-biscuit malt base with a twang of spicy, vegetal hops on the finish. Tinge of sour whiskey mash on the finish lets you know the alcohol is working, while the yeast adds some fruitiness. Malts are big and chewy on the palate, with a creaminess that plays well off the well-carbonated body. Overall, a very solid Altbier that leaves me wanting more with each sip--this thing is going so fast that I could burn through a 750ml without even blinking."
"D: I think I like... a pretty nice-drinking beer. Definitely the better of the several Long Trail brews I've had so far."
"T- Very solid malt taste. Thick, full-bodied and has a strong alcohol taste to it. Would be perfect if the malt and alcohol were dialed down just a hair."
"Drinkability: Perfectly priced brew for what you get. Its a nice addition to the winter line-up, but something i would stay away from in the warmer months as its a bit cloying and coating on the palate and the boos comes through a tad too much. I would love to try an aged one though!"
"D A great beer to come home to at the end of the day! Very smooth, tasty, and filling. It's malt reminds me of a Oktoberfest... Great beer but not the best."
"Buy Again? No"
"Pours a nice bright copper color with a nice fluffy head that quickly recedes leaving some nice lacing along the glass. Smells pretty good. Sweet bready caramel malts dominate with a some faint hops in the background. Not really too much going on here. Taste is similar to smell. A good strong malty background provides most of the flavor here. A nice toasted caramel, with hints of toffee as well. Just hints of floral, grassy hops provide some balance. Has a nice full body to it, and its very smooth going down. Every sip leaves you coming back for more. This is my first Long Trail brew can't wait to try some more."
"Had this at Bridgewater's Pub at Amtrak Station in Philadelphia. Served with a small off white head that persisted and good lace. Color was a medium coppery amber. Aroma is caramel, toffee, malt, and a bit of hop. Flavor was same but sweet up front and a bitter end. Good body and carbonation. Short finish. Very drinkable. Session beer."
"D - Not bad. I've never been a Vermont beer fan but this one is okay."
"D: ABV is up there but this is still and easy drinker."
" The taste is good with semi-dry herbal hops with slight fruity tinges of yeast and mild caramel body with slightly creamy malt and gentle spice in the hops with light alcohol taste and dark cherry element from the yeast. The finish is sweet and tangy wtih slight tinge of alcohol. I think this is a good double alt with nice malt but doesn't really become cloying, still a good quaffer even though it appears my palate may have changed in 3 years"
"You can drink 3 of these before you know what has caught up with you and still desire more."
"Drinkability: Solid, if a bit visceral and wild, though there's a balance issue that would make me not want to have more than a few I'd say. Still worth a shot for a bottle."
"long trail never lets you down."
"Always an enjoyment."
"Delicious beer!"
"D: definitely something i could drink regularly and in high quantities"
"Interestingly this is described on the label as a ""double alt"". Never heard that term before, so I've learned something new! Anyway you catagorize it, this is an excllent brew. Deep copper color, great looking head. Rich malty aroma. Flavor and body are rich with a hint of chocolate. A pleasant alcohol warming sensation follows each swallow. Hops balance things out nicely. Good drinkability for such a strong, rich beer."
"D) A good brew. Gets progressively better with each sip. Some interesting characteristics."
"CHEERS!"
"Serving type: bomber"
"Poured from bottle into an ale glass. No appreciable foam over a red amber ale. Pleasant smell without being over hoppy. Tastes surprisingly light for a higher ABV. I enjoyed the combination of bitter and almost sweet. The slight carbonation gave it a good mouthfeel without it being too syrupy. Very drinkable inviting you back for another sip."
"Pours a deep copper with a medium, fluffy head that drops to very nice lacing. The aroma is surprisingly mild, with a little toasty grain, but not much else, at least straight out of the bottle. The flavor is toasty, with just a little caramel, and a spicy malt burn on the finish, a little cinnamony. I am just not getting much in the way of hops, at least at first, though a little light floral hop comes up as the beer opens in the glass. The mouthfeel is a little slick, carrying that malt burn satisfyingly down the throat."
"D: You don't taste the higher alc content that lends itself for great drinking. Very easy to put down a couple before it catches up with you."
"D - This is okay. It is not the best altbier by any means and seems a little unbalanced."
"12oz. bottle served in my New Belgium Globe glass. 032409 indicated on the bottle. Poured a translucent chestnut with a half inch off-white head that dissipated into a bulls-eye of white in the middle, a slick of foam around the edges and a frothy band around the perimeter of the glass. Some spots of lacing were revealed as the brew was consumed. Nose suggests dark fruit and a little breadiness. Taste follows nose, but there's also some muted spicy qualities and some caramel notes. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a light carbonation and a mild acidity at the finish. Not really what I would consider an American Strong Ale; however, alcohol is well-hidden and it goes down easy."
"It's a good beer. Nuff said."
"The funny thing is that throughout enjoying this it kept on reminding me of lagunitas products. Perhaps they share some of the same recipes, and with the low prices, they at least have to be very similar."
"Pours a three finger cream head that fades to a thin layer leaving some lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Slight malty nose. Flavor is sweet malty but finishes with some bitterness. $1.65 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"D: I think this is a great gateway beer for people. The body is not that heavy but the flavor is up there. At 7% it will be bearable for those just getting in to craft beer. For me it is a nice beer that drinks easier than it should."
"poured into a pint glass, lighter shade of amber with a small white head that quickly dissapeared and hung around rim. smell brought a thick malt followed by the hops, another attempt gave hints of caramel and alcohol. smooth, grainy with a strong presence of hops- finishing with a bitter taste. a bit complex and very well balanced beer. well carbonated but a bit overwhelming, the drinkability is poorer than the triple bag in my opinion."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The initial entrance on the tongue is uneventful and weak, but it does improve with a swish and it remains moderately carbonated. The harsh, whipping flavors don't help make this beer a truly enjoyable experience."
"Drinkability: The overall impression is of a well brewed well balanced beer. I enjoyed this beer and found it easy to drink. While it is not one of my preferred styles, it could grow to be, and I can see having more than one and also returning to it in the future."
"Overall a tasty beer. Easy to drink given its size. Its a nice interpretation to this catch all style that is usually overly hopped."
"Overall, a great, complex beer not similiar to anything I have had so far. Great choice for a session brew. Something I will go out of my way to have again."
"I would not go back to this one. Way to bitter without enough taste throughout the offset it."
"Overall: Alts (especially stong Alts) are one of my brewing passions, and Americans tend to butcher them, so I'll admit I was expecting the worst when I first poured this beer. I was especially nervous after reading on their website some the malts (mostly two-row and crystal rather than Munich) and hops (Mt. Hood) that they use. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with the results. My biggest complaint would be that using two row and crystal rather than Munich leaves this beer more sweet than bready, and as you continue to drink the beer this leaves it a bit full and cloying. Nonetheless, it's an enjoyable beer that I wish I could get here in Chicago."
"D- Excellent! Across the board a fantastic brew. LT's best offering. This brew is very good bottled, when it's fresh on tap it's absolutely freakin' fantastic."
"Drinkability - Definitely a very drinkable beer. Great balance to it, the flavors are just right."
"Pours a clear amber with 1 finger of foamy eggshell colored head. OK retention and some lacing. Smells of caramel, clove, and apples. Tastes of toasted grainy malts, apples, chocolate, and caramel with a very bitter pine and spicy hop finish. Medium in body with average carbonation. Sticky with a strong dry bitter finish. Drinkable, but not something I would want too often, a little too much bitterness that doesn't really mesh well with the other flavors."
"D: An enjoyable malty ale with an interesting hops twist. A nice ale with a wide appeal."
"d - good stuff. I could see this as a session beer if I was in the mood and planned on slow-sipping only a few glasses during an evening. The burnt and bitter aftertaste might catch up on me in the long run, though."
"To me, the flavors don't blend or balance well, a bit too dry, not enough body. Glad a got a 12oz instead of 22, sorry to say."
"D - For a 7.20% ABV, it was very drinkable. Leaves a sweet, then slightly bitter taste. Very Good."
"D- On the sweet side, but super easy for me to drink, OctoberFest like."
"Will buy again, possibly a six pack!"
"One of my long time favorites, I have always enjoyed the this beer. Pours a nice dark copper color. The beer left a 2"" head in a beer glass, with a lot of lacing.The smell is of malts and slightly sweetness to it. The taste is remarkable. Its very malty with a nice sweetish taste to it that has a little alchohol and even a slight hint of Caramel. When held in the mouth, the alchohol taste is more present, but definatley not over bearing. Has a nice aftertaste almost wheatish, that makes you want to sip again. The beer has no sign of being 7.2% by drinking alone."
"Overall this was a pretty simple beer that's good for just enjoying and not thinking about/analyzing. Not something I see myself visiting often or possibly ever again, but not bad."
"i have to remember i don't like this."
"Tastes like an agressive, sweet fruitcake. Heavy sweet caramel with lots of fruit (peaches and plums mainly) and citrus hops. Mild alcoholic giddiness is the only indication of a 7.2% abv.."
"Double Bag is a great session ale for the bravehearted. Two or three will more than make one content. The Triple Bag was a bit too rough around the edges, but this one hits the mark dead-on."
"D: A nice mouthfeel and taste combination made this beer very drinkable. Pretty easy on the stomach too; good beer overall."
"Overall this beer was pretty good. I don't think I could have more than one or two in a sitting though."
"8/4/7/4/15 (3.8/5)"
"Just a great beer that is hard to point out individual details, but is just an excellent beverage that always leaves me smiling and satisfied."
"Longneck with a bottling date of 8/13/08. Pours a crystal clear amber in the glass with lively carbonation rising up. Nice, tightly-packed, cream-colored head reminiscent of latte froth. All sorts of authentic smelling German malts billowing off the top of this. Toffee, toast, caramel and a bit of butter round out the nose. Fruity to start (apple), going into dark toast and caramel and finishing off with a subtle flowery bitterness and delicate European grain note. A somewhat sharp medium carbonation with a medium-full body and bit of warming. A very nice drinking ale with an awesome malt profile. This has to be one of the most authentic tasting American-brewed, German style ales that I have had. Great job by Long Trail on producing this smooth, unique ale. I'm glad that I'm in the distribution range of this one!"
"Simply wunderbar!"
"(rated May 2, 2007)"
"-Matt"
"Drinkability: At 7.2, this is VERY SESSIONABLE. Again, I'm not a huge Long Trail guy, but like the Hibernator, this one is extremely well put together. The maltiness in this one is a huge factor in that, it's not overdrawn and it pairs perfect with the amount of spices at hand."
"This is a neat beer, probably one of the first craft beers I was exposed to as a youth. It has a very unique flavor and is ridiculously drinkable for the ABV."
"Pours a dark copper color and has a excellent off white head that leave decent lacing. The aroma give off a nice mixture of smells from malt to citrus to hops to spices. As for the taste, this is a very sweet beer. A medium bodied brew with a decent warming effect to it. Quite delicious and at 7.2 is a beer that you could drink all day. Not the greatest but would definitley accept as a gift."
"12 oz Bottle. Browish amber pour with a medium tan head. Aroma of toffee and caramel. Taste of malt, chocolate, caramel and brown sugar. Sticky mouthfeel but not overwhelmingly sweet. Great full finish. Very accessible in my area and a great intro to altbiers."
"A good beer. Not sure I'd chase it, but if someone offered it to me, I'd be very happy and accept their gift."
"Dude, I don't know; this seems to be a well-liked beer, but I just wasn't diggin it. It has a nice clear amber color, but the head was smallish and didn't hang out long. Left some thin strings of lace. Very malty aroma with a bit of hops. The flavor is incredibly malty with a pronounced fruitiness and some grassy hop leaf in the finish, but what I really get in the finish is a pretty harsh alcohol presence. Somewhat bittering and unpleasant. The feel is nice, smooth and soft. Light body. Overall I found the second half of the glass to be less enjoyable than the first, which is never a good thing. The malty twang becomes a bit irritating and the alcohol is harsh. For all my criticism, it's not a terrible beer, perhaps it's just the style that I don't care for."
"D - Alcohol is well hidden."
"This beer is significantly more palatable after a few months in the cellar."
"The pour is copper in color light head. Smell was very fruity mostly apple. The alcohol is very noticable in this beer but is not over powering at all. Very sweet and crisp with a little hop at the end. Overall I would say this is a very good beer and will drink again."
"This is quite a solid beer. At first I was thinking that it was maybe a bit too sweet for my taste, but the toasted grain and bitterness complement it nicely and keep it quite drinkable. Good stuff; I'd certainly have again."
"Clear amber with thin disappearing head. Weak and mildly malty aroma with a bit of green apple. Starts with a citrussy bitterness and fruitiness. Slight peppery alcohol, biscuity malt base. Finishes with a faint grassy hop bitterness that lasts a little. Decent, not too impressive."
"Nicely crafted."
"D: It is a well structured brew with excellent balance and mouth feel. It hits the ABV well making it an excellent session beer."
"Very nice looking pour, with good head retention and dark brown color. Sweet and woody on the nose, smelling of brown sugar but oddly, and rare, this beer imo, tastes nothing like it smells. Sweet malty brown sugar on the front followed by spicey, high hoppiness, udetectable high hoppiness. Beer smelled to me, more like an english brown, but tastes like a highly hopped American strong ale. Says it's an altbier, but I think BA has it right, as an American Strong, as I've never had this hoppy of an alt. Excellent beer, nonetheless."
"A very unusual brew. Lots going on. Would enjoy another."
"Label lists this as a Sticke-Alt.. American Strong ale on here? Semantics aside, this is a hell of a beer. So smooth for its 7.2% ABV and is a nice malty beer with tons of taste. A great bready/biscuity aroma and just fantastic taste. This is a great beer."
"This beer has a nice dark fruit Aroma. Intense flavor that you would expect from a double. The malt backbone is rich and could use more of a bitter counterbalance. The dark and maple-y sweetness is a bit cloying, but this is certainly a good beer to try. Liquid fruit cake is not my thing at the moment. But I recognize that this is a well-crafted beer that I will likely appreciate more as I deviate towards the maltier styles."
"A pumpkin pie treat of nutmeg spice and sweet bread pudding. Cinnamon breads containing spice so nice. Confident body, confident head, balance hiding ""almost over-the-top, yet comfortable alcohol."" Autumn leaves and a Novemeber to remember. French toasty toffee. Granola, Oatmeal, grade B syrup. Highest regards. Sip with Chai tea."
"Thick, fluffy head floats on top of bubbling amber beer. Floral aroma with touches of fruit and a splash of vanilla extract. Now for the taste: smooth, malty, full-bodied brew that disguises alcohol extremely well with medicinal flavor that slicks the tongue. Nonexistent carbonation while in the palate creates a syrupy characteristic to the beer, a well balanced thickness like molasses or milk."
"Taste consists of a sweet mix of dark malts, caramel, and some stale fruits. Amazing balance of hops. Faint alcohol, also. Oh, so pleasing. Medium to full bodied with very little carbonation. Very smooth and milky. One of my highest rated, for sure!"
"Big body, lazy bubbles. This one has good feel and is a bit filling in the process. Good one to sip and them move on to something else."
"Deep copper body with a small tan head that left some lacing. Sweet biscuity aroma with a hint of caramel and hops. Roasted malt flavours mixed in with caraml and a sweet nuttiness, and some grassy hops in the finish. Smooth, chewy mouthfeel seems to suit the flavours perfectly, and I can't see much room for improvement. Likewise the drinkability is just short of exceptional, and only the dangerously hidden alcohol could be a negative factor. Awesome brew. Well done Long Trail!"
"First thing I noticed was the 7.2% alcohol content. Pours an almost syrupy texture, amber colored with a thin white head that leaves a little bit of lace. Very rich malty, spiced taste that stays with you until the spicy hoppy finish. There isn't a dull moment with this beer. Good beer."
"Pours amber/red with as mall 1/8 off white head. Aromas of floral hops dominate. First taste is way smooth and much less hoppy than the aroma indicated. There are a couple of favors at work here that I cannot easily identify. Is it smoke? Oak chips? Overall not a bad beer."
"Pours a clean orange-sh/ copper color with an off white head. In the aroma, sweet malt, caramel, and somewhat a small hop. In the taste, small roasty, buscuity malt. A smooth and light to medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small malty and clean aftetaste. Nice ale, good color, small hints of a pils backround."
"On tap at the brewery, as it should be. Appealing amber/orange color with a two-finger, off-white head. Head dissipated after a minute or two but bubbles continue to rise. Good looking brew. Aromas of toffee, sweet malts and alcohol esters. Good flavors, roasted malt and sweet malt which is cut by floral hops, hints of caramel and nuts. A little alcohol heat appears at it warms up. Very smooth, perfect light/medium carbonation. For 7.2% this is unusually drinkable and could be dangerous (convince your girlfriend to drink a pair and you'll have a fine night!). Well balanced and probably Long Trails best beer."
"D_Meh. The fruity esters tend to dominate here and it isn't too good of a thing. A passable beer at best, at best."
"Notes: It is a strong beer with bold flavor. Very well done!"
"The drinkability on this is fantastic!I was surprised at how good this was!..excellent stuff.."
"M + D: Medium carbonation, a fuller body. The surprisingly tasty flavour and well hidden alcohol makes tihis decievingly easy to drink. Sip away the best you can!"
"Had the pleasure of having a pint yesterday while having lunch at the LT brewery on the drive home from the VT beer fest. Served in a pint glass. Brownish red hue to the color, bordering on a hint of orange. Smell didn't hit me with much. Taste was good, a nice balance of hops and malt. Though for a strong ale, the flavor seemed a bit subdued. I guess I am used to beers knocking my proverbial socks off. This was nice beer to enjoy with some food, as it's a bit strong (+7%), so some food in the stomach was good before driving. Besides the Ale, this is my second most favorite beer that LT makes."
"Pretty good drinkability. Not quite a session beer, but smooth and tasty enough to enjoy more than one at a time."
"D - This was one of my first craft beer loves, and I like to re-visit from time to time. 7% makes this a non-session beer.. but I usually find myself drinking in concession. Goes down with ease and that 7% can sneak up on you."
"D: nice brew! very easy to drink...especially at more than 7%. good flavors. before seeing the ABV, I though that I could drink several of these."
"Pours a clear medium amber with a thin white head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of caramel, floral/citrus hops & toffee. Up front flavors of carmelized malt and grapefruit hops are well balanced highlighting each other. Medium body and carbonation, this is a mouth cleansing beer with a dry finish and has a lemon rind/espresso bitterness in the aftertaste. Clean flavors, crisp and well balanced, very drinkable for the 7.2% ABV."
"This is a solid alt from Long Trail. Although alts really aren't something I drink all that often this was an enjoyable beer. I wouldn't mind giving this another try if I had a couple more. Thanks again Israel."
"Drinkability: Great beer, easy to drink, great taste. Definitly one of my favorites from Long Trail."
"Drinkability suffers due to the alcohol content and medium body, but 1 or two is definitly managable."
"This beer is great for anytime of the year. Not too dark for summertime and not too light for winter."
"I'd buy this again with no regrets. I could see drinking these on a summer night in front of a campfire or in front of my TV watching the Pats kick butt."
"Notes: Not for session. The ABV is not the only obstacle,it is that the beer is medium to full bodied. One can sip or drink it quickly. Good tasting."
"By far the CLASS of the Long Trail Lineup! This beer has a rich amber color, and a pretty good head. It smells sweet and malty. The taste is malty, sweet, and there is a hint of hops with a citrus tinge in there somewhere, strangely enough. It's smooth mouthfeel can lead you to keep drinking..Beware! The strong ABV is hidden well in this intense flavour experience. Bravo Long Trail!"
"Notes: This is certainly a beer to be enjoyed year round and very drinkable.Cheers"
"Drinkability is very good. Nice smooth beer that leaves a nice taste on your tongue pushing you to take another sip."
"Malt in the forefront with a bitter, dry finish. Good mouthfeel - leaves a pleasant aftertaste on the tongue. Goes down easy for for a 7% beer. I am looking forward to drinking the rest of this sixpack."
"My favorite Long Trail brew, and one of the beers that started me on a never-ending odyssey of drinking craft beer. Try it."
"The Double Bag pours with a thin head and has a reddish golden brown color. It is sediment free and has a strong earthy fruit smell. Tastes of chocolate, caramel, dates, and a hint of citrus. Lighter carbonation makes this beer an easy drinker and less filling. The higher alcohol content is hidden by its deliciousness. My absolute favorite Long Trail brew."
"The Double Bag is a pretty solid alt, but not quite equal to its inspiration, Uerige Sticke."
"Overall - Not my favorite style, but the best of the style that I have had."
"D: Refreshing and definately seasonal. I think this fits the fall/winter seasons better than right now."
"D: Over all its ok... i'd probably never choose this one again though."
"This beer pours a nice amber brown color with a short but creamy tan colored head that sits atop the beer most of the time. There is a decent amount of lacing all the way down the sides of the glass. It smells of very sweet malts, some viney fruitiness, and caramel. The taste is good as well. It has a deep but sweet malty base intertwined with some viney fruit flavors, some caramel, and then a touch of hops finishing off the taste of this beer. It has a very smooth and rich mouthfeel and doesn't feel anywhere near its alcoholic content which makes for a very drinkable altbier. Well worth a try."
"Tastes malty with a definite alcohol backbone. Kind of surprising as stronger beers mask that a little better. The alcohol content in this one is definitely not a secret. Aftertaste is slightly bitter without the initial sweetness. Its a very easy drinking beer despite the alcohol content being over 7%."
"The body is between mid and full. A nice presence with a under carbonation feel that enhances the malt presence. Overall I could sticke to drinking this on a regular basis."
"Overall: This brew doesn't drink like you would think a 7.2 ABV would. Double Bag is a solid yet subtle beer. Some might dismiss it because there's nothing really over the top about it, but that why I like it. Sometimes you need a beer that is well crafted but not a test of your mouth's endurance to drink. This is a balanced beer that is far from boring and is very drinkable. Kudos to Long Trail. Just watch out for that ABV. It will sneak up on you."
"Long Trail Double Bag has been on my radar screen for some time now. I'm pleased to say that it has lived up to my high expectations and is a beer that I would gladly purchase on a semi-regular basis if it was available locally. Thanks to far333 (a BA's BA) for sending me a bottle out of the blue."
"This is a creamy beer with good balance and full flavor."
"12 oz single bottle purchased from Buy Rite on Oak Tree in South Plainfield... pours a clean, clear, lucid amber and copper appearance with a small head that soon receded... smell was a nice balance between malts and hops, which was also strongly evident in the taste, which was also crisp, clear, and refreshing... noticeable dichotomy of malts and hops along with hints of caramel and slight vanilla which included a slick, oily taste combining elements of bread and butter... good mouthfeel that was rich and thick with a nice 7.2% ABV... wasn't impressed by Long Trail's Hefeweizen, but this one was a nice sample... decent mouthfeel with an overall quality taste led to a drinkable and tasty brew... Worth a try..."
"This is a pretty good beer, excepting the tiny bit of astringency. I would drink it again."
"D: A very easy drink by nature, woodsy, enjoyable, and very well balanced. Great fall beer and six pack worthy."
"D- really drinkable. Very enjoyable, smooth, and refreshing. And at 7+abv, a surprisingly refreshing beer! Had it with some salt and cracked pepper pan fried sirloin strips, went very well- toasty, mellow maltiness picked up the caramelized meat flavors very well and the hop bitterness and initial carbonation lifted away the fattiness."
"will be interesting when i compare this to an actual german alt..."
"Drinkability is definate, it goes down easily, which is surprising given the alcohol content."
"Pretty smooth mouthfeel and decently drinkable, but not much going on overall, besides the malt."
"Drinkability: Very high. This beer has a balance between the sweetness and the nioe hop flavor that, along with the smoothness of the brew, makes it very easy to drink."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth, good carbonation, semi-dry finish, medium bodied. All in all, a great Altbier. I'm usually not a huge fan of this style but it is going well with the cold air and snow all over the ground. This beer exceeded my expectations by a long shot. Good job at hiding the alcohol volume as well. Very sessionable."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and buttery. Leaves a little film. Gives a smooth balance to the tangy flavor. Overall this is one of the better Long Trail brews. Tangy and smooth."
"Bottled 17Sep07. Poured into a standard pint glass. Very clear, pale colored with no head. Smells of straw, bananas, and sweet toasted malt. Light in the mouth with some hops at the tail end. Seems German in style but reminds me of Foster's Special Bitter (that is not a good thing). I was a bit dissapointed from the label, I was really hoping for a double milk stout. Neh. I could easily live without this beer."
"D- Drinker please beware: this is a good beer that will creep up on you a little too quickly."
"Served up a clear almost-brown amber with a creamy, 1-finger beige head. Signs of carbonation persisted and left nice rings and a little lacing as the beer vanished. Spicy noble hops aroma is balanced off with rich malt, slightly like toasty bread. Rich and clean in smell. The taste is equally clean. The light hoppy flavor hits the tongue first quickly followed by mid-low bittering. Bitter flavor could have been a bit stronger. The sweet, toasty malt fills the mouth and sticks through a dry aftertaste. Mid-full mouth feel and a bit light on the carbonation, which may have helped add to the bitter taste. Very nice taste, clean, smooth and subtly rich. Bittering or carbonation could have been a bit increased. Flavors get much richer as it is allowed to warm. Good offering and highly drinkable."
"I think that this is long trail's best beer. I will purchase it again and again."
"i was a bit leary of trying an american alt, but ; this one pours a med. copper color w/ a thin white head which dissapates quickly leaving a minimal amount of lacing ; a malty, slightly vinous aroma, w/ a faint hoppy, butterish-like undertone ; a crisp little hop bite at first, followed by a rich, malty butterscotch flavor, some hop flavors as well ; a dry, light-med bodied brew, w/ a med. amount of carbonation, sticks around long enough to taste it & dry enough to make you want more ; a very drinkable beer esp. for the 7.2 ABV, i'm on my 3rd now...."
"This beer had that dark wood appearance, with a kicking smell. The aroma reminded me a little bit of medicine (maybe because of the high alcohol content). I really did enjoy this beer. I don't think i would want more than 3 in a night, because of its potency. I would like to tr""y it on draft some time. Overall its a good brew and I agree with the guy that says ""too many of these will put you in the bag."""
"Pours a clear golden amber color with a smallish off-white head that left some spot lacing. The smell is of caramel malt and some nice floral hops. The taste is of caramel malt, slightly buttery with a metallic twang. This is followed by a nice mellow floral/grassy hop presence. The malt and hops balance very well in the brew. The alcohol is subtle, you know that it is there but you can't really taste/feel it. The feel is light but not watery, crisp and well balanced. A good malty brew with a nice complimenting hop balance and enough of a alcohol presence to be able to put you in the ""bag"" if you had a few of these."
"Nice looking reddish browh with 1/2"" tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves continuous to spotty lace. Very active bubbling in the body. Smelss big and malty with a hint of sweetness. The initial flavor is excellent big malt with light bread and a very smooth transition to nicely balanced malt and bitter hop aftertaste. Medium to full bodied with slightly dry texture and lively9 carbonation. This is a great beer and one that I wish were more widely available. It has a very nicely balanced flavor that is just a little sweet. This is a big beer that feels a lot more traditional than some of America's other big beers. It is not overwhelming in any way. No need for making faces due to overabundant hops. Very pleasant and smooth."
"Now this is what I call a session beer. (Yeah, I know... way too strong, but that's how I like 'em!) Looks good, decent but not huge head although it recedes pretty quickly. Smell is sweet malt, nothing special really. It's the taste that makes this brew. Smooth full-bodied well-balanced mix of sweet malt and hops. Mouthfeel is good too, finely carbonated and just chewy enough. Loses some of that as I get to the bottom of the glass and lose the carbonation, but up to that point it's a really smooth brew."
"Drinkability: Pretty enjoyable despite somewhat unpleasant initial hop presence. Good but not exceptional. (4.0)"
"Last pretty matly, but not overly sweet and very crisp. definantly can notice the hops, but not in a dominant way. kind of a chewy mouthfeel, but overall the body is pretty good. Very drinkable, good beer all around"
"Overall Double Bag is a really good brew, it's a highly drinkable smooth tasting strong beer, I definitely recommend it."
"D: Very drinkable given the abv. Enjoyed it with a burger and could have enjoyed a few more."
"This is a delicious beer. From what I understand, alts are german style beers fermented with ale yeast but treated in the same manner as a lager. Well, both characteristics come out in this brew with nice, clean and refreshing lager traits balanced and complemented by fruity esters and malt sweetness and body. Fruits, berries (cranberries, blackberries and some cherries) and caramel sugar in the nose. It is a nice, clear, medium brown color with red highlights and a thin, white, bubbly head. Tastes malty and sweet but with enough bitterness to satisfy the hop-heads; a very balanced presentation in all. Both malt and hops are fully enjoyed in this brew. Smooth mouthfeel and reasonable carbonation. I cant really remember a beer in which the alcohol is so disguised. Itll make you want to down a few, so watch out."
"As a side note I drank one of these one night after drinking a rather hoppy amber ale and the complexity of the beer jumped out much further. It reminded me of a tripel mixed with a Quad. The sweetness and richness of the malts really came through."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and light. The abv is very well hidden and makes this a dangerously drinkable brew. By far my favorite Long Trail brew. I will definetly be picking up a six pack of this next time I visit the liquor store."
"This is one tasty beer and im glad I got a chance to have it.The abv is hidden and the beer is sweet,this may be the sweetest I like my beer to be without a generous amount of hop balance in there.Go Long Trail Rock On With Your Bad Self!"
"Very enjoyable, I must say. Had I purchased more than one bottle, I could ""sticke"" with this for one or two more."
"Drinkability: Flavorful and surprisingly drinkable for something with alcohol this evident."
"M/D- I imagine this could be quite sessionable, and also a beer to get people who don't normally drink craft beer trying somethings. Medium bodied, slightly chewy....not too bad...might pick up one or two more."
"Pours a nice amber color with little head, but whats their leaves a nice lacing. The smell is mostly sweet malts with some yeast notes, The taste is also sweet, with a fruit and hop bite at the end. Not super drinkable. A tad to sweet for my taste without the hop to balance it. A decent beer from long trail."
"Creamy and smooth with a juicy fruit and cereal finish. Low/moderate carbonation makes for a more dense finish that is not dry. Pleasant on the palate throughout. Well balanced and very complex. High marks in all categories. I would certainly suggest it."
"Definitely a German beer. The malt is very sweet w/ a very subtle fruitiness to it. A deep amber w/ a thick but quickly faded head. The nose is somewhat alcoholic but that doesn't carry over to the taste. Alcohol is barely noticeable and gives it a slight tingle towards the back of the mouth. I can't describe what makes this beer so reminiscent of German beers, but the flavor is unique and tastes very clean. Although the malt is very sweet, there is also a nice complement of roasted malt and light hops which keep it from being too sweet. The mouthfeel is very smooth and clean while the drinkability is crazy, although it can get heavy towards the end of the glass. I'm finishing the last few sips right now and the beer is very close to room temperature but still tastes great. Although this beer claims to be a ""secret brew," it still remains very close to German style. Definitely my favorite offering from Long Trail."
"This turned out to be a great session beer, but be careful, that 7% sneaks up on you."
"Pours a clean/clear golden amber color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy off-white head, not much sticky lacing at all. The nose is malty, slightly fruity (dark), lots of caramel. The taste is slightly sweet/tangy, malty, slight dark fruits, and caramel. The finish is slightly dry. Alcohol is hidden very well, would not think this to be a 7.2% ABV brew. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a tasty brew, would recommend."
"If anybody has read some of my other reviews, this beer was recommended by the same guy as the Stone Ruination IPA. It pours a clear amber color with a sticky head that stays long enough to be enjoyed for its aroma. This double ale is a smoothe beer that hides its alcohol very well. If taking a blind taste test, I would say it had the same as any other beer on the market even though it sits at a nice 7.2%. It goes down nicely with very little bitterness which is nice if you're just looking for something to have after a hard days work. All in all, this is one of the best beers I sell at work and would recommend it to anyone looking for something new to try."
"Taste is unique, as unique as the Long Trail Ale altbier...this one is sweeter up front, smooth, but then a woody, powdery bitterness kicks in and carries through into the finish...inviting another sip to replenish the aromatic sweet malty notes, only to have them banished by that beguiling dry altbier bitterness. Alcohol well hidden, perhaps best detected in the mouthfeel which is a bit heavier than the lower ABV LT Ale. Really nice beer."
"Pours dark amber with deep red tones. Minimal head retention with a thin persistent ring of foam. Smell is invitingly sweet and fruity and almost dessert-like. Taste is huge, lots of malt up-front and a very distinct banana flavor. Not a hint of ale yeast banana fruitiness, but full-on like you just ate a chicita. This beer is perfectly hopped with bittering levels to balance all this sweetness. Believe it or not, this big 7.2abv beer is a great cross-over beer for macro swillers because it just tastes great."
"Drinkability - a pretty decent brew with some nice variety for the tastebuds. Thanks to afatty for the sample."
"Pours a clear amber with very little head. The aroma is somewhat sweet with some alcohol. Syrupy and malty taste. The alcohol is very evident. Nice tasting beer. The mouthfeel is smooth and slick. Quite drinkable for being 7.2% ABV. Overall, I enjoyed this beer. It goes down easy and the ABV is in the range that I like."
"This beer pours a medium brown color. The aroma is rich and malty with hints of alcohol in the backbone. The taste confirms this with nothing but malt, a slight hint of hops and strong alcohol taste. Definitely not a session ale or for the weak. Somewhat drinkable still."
"Overall a very pleasant, complex beer."
"Had no trouble finishing the beer,couldn't drink a lot of this one. Not a bad beer,maybe caught me a bit off guard being called an altbier."
"Drink On!"
"I didnt notice that it has a 7.20% ABV."
"Overall, a tasty beer, and something I've bought a few times over the years. It's nothing astonishing, but it's a technically very well done beer, and appears to be done with care."
"Double Bag pours a clear red orange with a healthy head. Smell is rich and malty, almost vinous, like red wine. Its sweet and fruity with just a hint of diacetyl. Taste is sweet caramel malts with nice flavors of dark fruits. Spicy hops back up the sweet malt flavor with a nice spiciness. Diacetyl is there in the aftertaste but light and balenced, a very enjoyable level. Double Bag is my favorite beer from Long Trail."
"I don't know of too many breweries that make two different alts, but Long Trail has certainly proved that it's worthwhile."
"Pours a pure copper, with a moderate yet dense off-white head that dissipates in 1-2 minutes with minimal lacing. Nose is of grain and malts with just a hint of lemon/ orange peel. Taste is of burnt caramel, cherry, and moderate hoppiness.Mouth feel is very good, full and creamy. Finish is a somewhat dry hoppy one, with a light lingering bitterness on the palate. All in all a well crafted beer that drinks quite smoothly after the palate adjusts about half way through the first one!"
"I'll second what most other people have said about this beer. It pours pure copper - like pennies from heaven. The smell is big barley with some fruit and a little dried spice, not sure what. I'm most impressed with the aroma since I have a bum nose that's usually too clogged up to smell much. Mouthfeel is a nice middle of the road. I love malty beers, but if they're too unbalanced the taste seems thin. This has enough hop to counterweight the malt, but buttery sweet malt is what it's all about. You'll never taste the alcohol, but after sipping for a while I did notice some numbness in my tounge. It's not a once-in-a lifetime beer, but one of these at the brewery after a day at Killington made me feel like I lacked nothing in life..."
"D---One of my top all-time favorites and I drink it year-round. Its just dry enough to quench on a hot day and at 7%, it could melt a snow bank if you happen to fall in one after a 6-pack."
"A very nice interpretation of an altbier."
"Good drinking flavorful beer."
"pours a light brown with a quarter inch head with some lacing. smell is bubble gum, caramel, and fruity. taste toasted malt, and sweet caramel. mouthfeel medium, but not cloying or syrupy with a nice hop balance finish and no after taste. look for long trail double bag you will not go wrong."
"I would give it higher marks if not for my aversion to banana flavors."
"Drinkability was hampered by the unpleasant alcohol taste, which likely masked many of the more subtle flavors in this beer."
"A very nice bigger beer. Some subtle alcholic warmth and a rubust character make it nice for the colder months. A very nice beer."
"D: Tasty, goes down real easy, not very filling and I didn’t really notice the 7.20% ABV much at all. I thought this beer went well with my turkey & stuffing for Thanksgiving dinner. In retrospect, I should have brought a 12-pack with me instead of a sixer as I ended up not being the only person that drank it."
"Overall this is a fine beer and it's very drinkable, even with the 7.2 percent ABV."
"Pours honey in color. Thin head, not much retention, but some lacing. Smell is on the weak side. Malt,mostly with some alchol. Body is thin, with just a bit of carbionation. Taste is smooth and richly malted from start to finish. A nice fruity finish. This beer tastes much better than it looks or smells!"
"this beer definitly looks a lot worse than it tastes. some slight caramel flavor. an excellent overall example of an altbier. the alcohol is very well hidden. i could definitly see this beer being very sessionable. too sessionable. long trail has always been a solid vt. brewery, and this has to be their best offering."
"It's a good effort, not my favored style, not a beer I'll run out and buy a 6-pak of, but an interesting brew, and (grudgingly I say) satisfying, Not udderly delicious, but good strong drink to go w/ good substantial food."
"One of my personal favorites. Its got a very smooth and full taste with a good amount of hops, malts, with a sweat finish. At 7.2% ABV its got a good kick to it, and enough of these will get you drunk dialing real soon. As far as altbiers go, this is a damn good one, especially for an American made one. So grab yourself a six pack and enjoy."
"I remember drinking this a few times while living in VT back in 2000-01 first time drinking since,poured a clear lighter bronze color with a thinner white head that settled into a soapy-like top with a decent amount of lace behind.Fruity esters in the nose along with some brown sugar and well some bubble gum wich was a little odd I wouldnt have expected to come across that.Pretty fruity up front dare I say gummy wormish?Fruity flavors and brown sugar sweetness meld into a nice dryer spicey finish with an herbal tinge true to alt beer style.Does not feel like 7.2% alc thats for sure goes down quite easily,I am revisiting the Long Trail beers they are readily available here in in western NY this is a very nice offering."
"My first altbier... Red translucent body with inch-thick off white head... Smells hoppy but not overwealmingly so with a little malt. Tastes sweet, with some floral hops. Medium to high body. Very well balanced and extremely tasty. Color me impressed! I'll be getting a sixpack of this."
"I love this beer, but it's quite rugged and should be respected. A bartender in Lewiston stocks it in the fridge just for me. How cool is that?"
"These go down really easy to spite it's 7.2 ABV%."
"Thanks to Nutbrown for including this Alt in our trade!"
"Pours amber to brown in color, clear, witha small cream head that fades quickly. Sweet caramel malt aroma, a little boozy smell and some cola-y sweetness and a dairy-like aged aroma as well. Taste follows with sweet maltiness that is mixed with a wheaty bready flavor, this is followed by a peppery, slightly grassy drying hop flavor. Medium in body and slightly oily, there is a hint of the alcohol in the finish. Very interesting flavors and fairly easy to drink."
"Drinkability: Well made beer that is presented better in a bottle than on tap."
"Drank it from the bottle and noticed it was a bit sweet with hop bitterness and noticed more of a alcohol taste and realized what the hell the ABV was...I was surprised. I detected some citrus notes as well. I was warm and fuzzy when it hit the gut. I have to say that I won't be looking to get it again. Too much of an alcohol taste causing more of a bite than I would like when enjoying a beer."
"This light/medium bodied brew seemed like it could benefit from just a tad more carbonation."
"A dark beer, amber in color, with a medium head and some slight lacing. Not much in the aroma department, mostly sweet. A caramel/toffee taste, with a little hops. Pretty good taste, actually, just not enough of it. I liked this beer, and have had several in one sitting, but I keep thinking it could be better."
"On tap at the Long Trail Brewery, small head, dark copper color, alomst looks like a dark ale. Couldnt really get much out of the smell, almost not present but could have been because of where i was at and the multitude of smells in the air. Decent smooth taste for a dark beer, with a little bit of kick from the alcohol level. Would definetly recommend for sitting next to a fire in the winter, not a beach type beer, unless you like that sort of thing."
"Double Bag is a nice member of the Long Trail family. A good example of the style, though clearly a Stickebier (maltier, more alcohol) as opposed to a standard Alt. Works well as a dessert beer or digestif. Definitely recommended."
"Finishes pretty clean, and is very drinkable."
"12 ounce bottle. Doublebag pours out a partially hazy amber color topped with a small head. Lots of small bubbles stick to the side of the glass. Fruit and nuts aroma with some floral characteristics. Toasted malt flavor with some nuttiness. Sweetness comes in at first, but is balanced by a tasty dose of German hops. The alcohol is masked by a crisp mouthfeel. Great drinkability. For a 7.2% beer, this is quite poundable."
"Quite a drinkable treat. Smooth, mild, subtle, and warming with just that right kinda of balance and roundedness that makes for a good beer. Alt style, and the like. Good stuff."
"Good old Long Trail Double Bag, I haven't had this one in quite a while. Pours a very impressive dark amber coloration with a small white head which faded quickly. Smell was interesting, with hints of sherry, earthiness, something a bit nutty in the smell also. Taste is pretty rugged but in a good way...earthy yet smooth and velvety with alot of honey and butterscotch qualities pulling through. It is also a pretty medium to full bodied beer, but still a pretty easy beer to quaff, i can recall going through a six pack of this back in the dizzle. I like the mild hop presence in this beer, it lends itself well to the heightened malt and grain. Impressive little brew here, simple yet pretty complex. Gotta love the cows too. Cheers"
"Mouthfeel is medium but strikingly clean; the finish has a little bitter hops that slips off the palate within seconds. Wonderful, I could easily session this."
"This is a staple sixer for when I want to have a great beer in the fridge rather than raid my supply in the beer cellar. Great for friends that want to try something a bit more than ordinary but are not ready for heavy duty brews. Enjoy!"
"Aroma is a kind of caramelized toffee dipped apple. Amber in color with a diminishing white head. Fore is stiff with more than expected alcohol followed by smoothe caramel malt, toffee notes some hearty bread notes and perfumey alcohol. This is a fairly high abv Alt. Very smooth, fruity and malty all the way through and a delight to sip at."
"Overall, this is a very tasty beer. The bottle said nothing about what type of beer it was, but I imagine it would be a nice choice for anybody who appreciates a good beer so who cares if it says anything on it. For me as a native to Vermont, it really feels good to be drinking a great beer with a great Vermont name and such a beautiful maple syrup color."
"d- Wow this is so drinkable. You could throw a few of these back with no difficulty. How is this 7.3 abv? Such a unique bold and drinkable beer from longtrail, I certainly did not expect this. Highly reccomemended."
"This poured with a thick, off-tan head. The color was a clear, deep amber. The nose had a predominantly malty sweetness to it, underlain by a faint hoppiness. The mouthfeel was medium and I got a pleasant mix of malt and hops on the tongue. The finish was lightly hoppy and very refreshing. This was a tasty beer that I would want to drink again."
"D - very high, even though a higher ABV than most macros, the ABV is masked very well in the flavor, what a high quality beer. well done Long Trail"
"Poured a semi-translucent, dark brown color with a white colored, bubbling head that was thin and dissipated quickly leaving behind minimal lacing. Aromas of malt, fine red wine, juicy fruit, and ripe grapes seemed to come out. The taste was malty with subtle fruit flavors. Medium-full bodied with a smooth & slightly bitter finish. Somewhat chewy in my mouth. Very drinkable, especially with the alcohol not easily detected."
"One of these will do. It's a good brew, but for me, the finish is a little harsh."
"Overall- a nice offering from Long Trail. A definite session beer and a beer worth seeking out or buying a 6er of!!"
"Body is barely medium, with tight carbonation and a slick, almost mineral-laden mouthfeel. Doesn't taste of drink like 7.2%, more like 5."
"Taste lingers. Makes you crave more."
"A good deal at $2.99 for a bomber. This beer actually reminds me a lot of Geary's Hampshire Special Ale."
"Cheers!"
"Wow...very impressive. I forgot how good this was. This certainly should become a regular in my fridge."
"Yummy."
"Long Trail Double Bag is a crystal clear burnt orange brew with a white head that fades to about a 2mm layer on top of the beer. Aroma is quite hoppy, mostly cirtus with some spicy notes as well. Taste is big and bold, with some roasted and caramel maltiness followed by a bitter hoppy finish. Nicely balanced. Full bodied, with relatively high carbonation. Dangerously drinkable for 7.2%. One of my favorite local beers, and an outstanding brew from a brewery whose other offerings are pretty standard."
"Long Trail has brewed a great Strong Ale with their Double Bag Ale. The beer pours a dark amber color with a nice white head. The head thins but stays throughout the pint and laces nicely down the glass. The smell has a distinct malty sweetness to it and there are noticeable alcohol notes in this beer. The taste is slightly sweet and malty with a caramel aftertaste. The alcohol warms the throat and is noticeable on the back of the throat and pleasant. The hops are not detectable but keep this beer in a great balance. The mouthfeel is smooth and rich but not overpowering or heavy. This beer has a great flavor and mouthfeel and it would be easy to start drinking these and not stop; be cautious of the high ABV though or else it will be a short night!"
"Dark copper color, not much head to this. I remember this being sweeter before in taste, or I could be thinking of something else. Nice aroma, a bit interesting flavor because it's not too bitter but has quite a bit of grapefruit taste, but not overwhelming, it's just real interesting. And I quite like it too. I don't think I'll buy it all the time but it is interesting."
"Both the mouthfeel and drinkability are about average, which works well with a sandwich or a pizza. Uncharacteristically hoppy for a doublebock and strong for an altbier, this beer pairs well with a fall lunch."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied, but semi thick from the sugar, a bit syrupy for me."
"I started by feeling bad for the cows on the label, with bloated udders painfully in need of some prompt cartoonish milking. From there I fell almost into apathy, as the beer had nothing really memorable going on. It's got an ABV that makes it a bit to handle, and what it offers just doesn't carry enough muscle to cmpete. Sure, it's basically drinkable, but just above average may be the best I can say. Sure, I'll finish this sixer, with some measure of enjoyment, but this is likely it. Probably, anyway."
"Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, a little thick (like a dark lager...blech), and generally mediocre. Extremely drinkable. I hope the beer store still has it on special, this could be a heck of a transition beer for college boozers, considering the double-deuce ounce bottle, high alcohol content, and mild but flavorful presence. I vote yea!"
"Pours a dark amber with hints of the orange/purple/red spectrum. Slight to no head on this puppy. Smells very malty with touches of caramel and sweet malt. Caramel malt flavors rule with a slight hint of fruit, and and excellent light bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is creamy with an above average boldness. A very nice offering from Long Trail and the first craft beer i ever enjoyed. this one holds a special place in my heart."
"Drinkability: Label says its so smooth you wont believe its 7.2%. Well I believe it. I dont think it was hidden all that well to boast about it on the label. It was a fairly smooth, enjoyable beer nothing that really impressed me."
"This ,all in all,is a slightly above average beer that leaves you wanting more flavor.I don't think I'd buy a 6 of this again,but I would like to try it on tap."
"Pours red-amber with a short light head, a little lacing. Nose is pretty light but the hops and some alcohol is present. Taste is better, more balanced. A good solid hops, slight maltiness, hints of fruits and some alcohol. Pretty decent, but would be better without the mild skunkiness."
"Nicely drinkable, along the lines of other autumn ales/ winter seasonals that I have had. 2 or 3 would go down very well sitting by the fire on a winter's day."
"Drinkability suffers a little from the bitterness level, after a bit it gets tiring. A good beer for exercising your taste buds but I don't think I would want to drink 3 of these in one night."
"Overall: Nice domestic sticke; one of the better American alts I've encountered."
"What a great blend of malt, hops, and alcohol! And so smoooothe... This seems to me to be a perfect autumn beer, hiking up the body a bit and the alcohol to combat the coming darkness and chill. I've not had anything else quite like this -- kudos to Long Trail for uncovering such an obscure style and having such a great go at it!"
"Well, I am drinking the last of the $5.99 sixpack of this, which we bought up in ME. About as clear an amber as you'll find, it's got a nice buttercream colored head, that actually lasts quite a bit. Aroma is also quite nice, some German maltiness, but if you dig deeper, that 7.2 %abv starts showing itself as well. Tastewise, there is a good base layer of malt, but I am also picking up on some small hoppy and tannic flavor which is also very nice. Finishes a bit dry. I do notice the abv by the end of just one bottle. Mouthfeel manages to stay medium, carbonation is pretty low."
"Cherries, oak barrels, and alcohol, oh my. These three flavors dominate the taste. There's a tinge of smokiness, too. Each flavor is nicely presented, balanced, appropriately subtle. The mouthfeel if soft. The smell is strong and pleasant...again, cherries, oak barrels, and alcohol. This brew is rich and sweet, serious yet playful. When I dabble in mixed drinks, I often have Manhattans. This beer is right for the Manhattan drinker. It's August and hot, yet this one isn't too heavy. In the depth of winter, I expect it to take on rich, warm flavors that strenthen the soul. Double Bag is a sticke, a ""secret"" beer. Be a snitch. Let the secret out. Double bags are for concealment, but this one deserves exposure. Long Trail has made a kick ass beer."
"Not too filling, easy going down though, but not too light either, maybe a medium bodied, could be trouble."
"Drinkability: A very nice altbier; like the balance a lot"
"The taste was a bit on the hoppy side. That is to say that, the aftertaste left you remembering more of the hops than the also very strong, caramel malt taste. The mouthfeel was perfect for a cool summer night. This would probably be a great beer from late April to early June and late September to early November. I could drink a few of these at a time, but would probably want to move on to something lighter after that."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is a decent take on a German Sticke. Very enjoyable."
"nice copper brown color with an initially substancial head that dwindled but stuck around in a thin layer. some patchy lacing. yeast and floral smells over malt and hops - quite interesting. maybe a little whiff of butter in there too. tasted sweet malt at first before a quick hit of pleasant spiciness before all is overwhelmed by estery hops bitterness. this brew has solid complexity in its shift of flavor as it progresses along the palate and a good, long, bitter malt finish with some citrusy notes to kick it off. felt smooth yet medium-bodied in the mouth. abv just apparent enough without being entirely masked or distracting. a solid, strong, and warming brew that is a pleasure to drink."
"Overall this is an enjoyable beer. Not my favorite thing, but I have very little experience with Altbier. I'll have to drink the others in the 6-pack and bring up an overall review in a week or so."
"Medium - medium heavy in body. Mouthfeel is mildly crisp at the start. Finish is crisp with a long malt and buttery aftertaste. Easy drinking. One of the better Long Trail brews I have had."
"it's definitely worth a try. it has a very interesting bitterness to it that I can't place, almost reminds me a touch of the aftertaste of Three Floyd's Alpha King. good stuff."
"If'n ya think I'm rating this one a wee-bit high? Yep, you are correct sir and . . . (aside: if it's any consolation this reminds me a bit of ""Eye of the Hawk"" in terms of gusto, relative SRM, and drinkability - uh, make that an *aggregate* of the original Mendo/CA-brewed version and the new and gradually-improving 'toga Springs version) I will explain it as such: tasting this now in the early part of summer, 2005 brings me back a buncha years to when I was a dumb college grad living in Slummerville/Medford. I am now a dumb thirty-something bachelor who no longer has a smokin-hawt Polish American girlfriend, and living in Minneapolis - so there, how the mighty have fallen, eh? A big THANK YOU to the Monk and whoever tha heck he got it from for the bottle!"
"I enjoyed this one overall. In college, I was a big Long Trail fan but never really took a liking to the Double Bag at all for some reason. Now, I'm not as high on LT as I was in college (though I still like the brewery & its products very much) but have a newfound appreciation/liking for the DB. Funny how things work sometimes."
"A pretty tasty offering with a nice alcohol kick. Very drinkable even at 7.2"
"Overall = I'd give the taste a 5 if it was a little less bitter. This is still an extremely tasty beer. I highly recommend it."
"A clean dark copper colored beer. Has a small off white head and some lace. The aroma starts with a light sweet malt followed by a floral hop with a bit of graininess in the background. The flavor has the malt start at the tip of your tongue and slide down the middle. While the hops nip at the sides of your tongue and then join the malt at the back of your throat foe a well balanced finish."
"The label is kind of corny which somehow doesn't convey the gravity of this beer. The beer is big and yet very refined. Pours a very nice clear mid gold with good head. The dominant nose and first flavour is malt. The beer becomes more complex with every sip unitl you start to realize that the alcohol is almost invisible. Very food friendly and very well made."
"Poured this ffrom a six pack I got, was excited to see a whole fridge of Long Trail beers. In my mug it looked like a nice amber color, maybe a little darker but very little head. Smelled very malty, lacing wasnt bad though. The taste was interesting. Most of the Long Trail stuff has a very mellow aftertaste to it. There is a bit of hoppiness to it but its very smooth. A solid beer, nothing too exceptional, definitely nothing bad about it. I would love to have a keg of this for a party."
"Without question the best beer I have given a 2nd chance to, and I am much better for it."
"A really solid, all around beer. It has a little something for everyone."
"Very drinkable beer. Just a little astringent in the finish, but not really at all. I just can't bring myself to say this beer is perfect. It's damn close, just a little astringent in the finish...damn! Nto cloying at all. I love this brew."
"This altbier poured a clear, copper color with light tan, creamy foam that settled, but clung to the glass a little, leaving some lacing. The smell was fruity hops with malt and a faint caramel aroma and a bit of a slightly vinous odor. The taste was tangy and malty with fruity hops. There was a nice hoppiness overall. There was also a bit of a vinous taste and a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel was dry and airy with medium body and moderate carbonation. The aftertaste was lightly malty and hoppy. This was a decent altbier, though a bit thin for a sticke altbier. I have also had this one on-tap though took no notes."
"Truely a great session beer. Immensely drinkable and smooth. I wish this was more readily available outside of the NE area. Had it this past weekend during a visit to a friend at Sugarbush, VT. Pours a medium brown with hoppy floral scents. Taste is smooth, creamy, slightly hoppy and toasty. Perhaps a little tiny bit of brown sugar somewhere in there. Goes down very easily and could be quite dangerous at 7%+ ABV. Truely a gem worth finding if you're in the area."
"Pours a clear, hearty, flaming amber with a small-medium sized, dirty off-white head. Big aromas of caramel apples, toaste malt, and spicy hops. Very good. Taste does not disappoint. Rich, malty cookie dough sweetness up front. There's a spicy, toasty edge along with it too. Malt turns fruity as the bitterness picks up into the sweetish, spicy bitter, warming finish. Medium bodied, with a near-syrupy feel. A very tasty sticke-alt beer that is very drinkable for the punch it ""secretly"" packs."
"Hoppy easy drink, with good malts and hops working in tandem. Copper, whote head. Some spicy yeast. Citrus, pepper, and malts and biscuit yeasts in taste. Medium mouthfeel, with creaminess. Unclassifiable until I saw its an alt. Nice with food. A must try."
"The cream of the crop for Long Trail ales and, like all of their brands regardless of style, much too easy quaff. Now the task is on me to savor the sixpack of this long lost favorite."
"Rather good! An excellent choice if you are in Vermont and looking for a beer that is excellent, yet different from the norm. Pours a dark orange/amber color. Head is light and lacy. But quite delicious. A very dark sweet, like molasses, was dominant here. The bitter hops were a nice complement, but more noticeable with the aftertaste. Given this beer blind, I don't think I would be able to warn you about the high alcohol content, so drink with caution. Thumps up to this one."
"Sand bagged by the double bag--yet again. The brewers do a pretty good job at masking the alcohol in the beer. I could still notice it, but it tasted much more like 5%, and in my holiday-spirit induced arrogance I forget that is actually 7.2%. It poured mohagany in color with very little head and spotty lace. The hops are sweet and there is a strong taste of brown sugar. I also noticed a bit of citrus. Sweet malts were also noticable in both the aroma and flavor. The feel was smooth with the perfect carbonation to compliment the beer."
"Recomended."
"Poured a crystal clear copper with a nice looking head. Mighty fine. Aroma is of sweet malts and a pleasant alcoholic touch. Bready, very inviting. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth, with the carbonation prickling the tip of the tongue. At the same time the beer feels nice and light, not watery, just smooth and light. This is one smooth and elegant beer. The majority of the flavor is comprised of bready malt, and a slightly warming alcohol. Taste earthy/woody at the same time. It's not an overly complex brew, but it hits all the right notes."
"I was definately surprised by this beer, very surprised. Absolutely declicious by every standard and in every measure, and it looks like a million bucks. I'd take another 6-pack, but the two I've are giong to be thoroughly enjoyed."
"Actually quite a nice beer. An attempt at a stickbier(super alt) says the label. It sort of reminds me of a big malt and hoppy German dunkel crossed with an Oktoberfest. But what do I know. I think Ill have another."
"Nice pour with a copper color to it and an average sized beige head. Not a huge aroma by any means, a slight trace of hops can be noticed if you try hard enough, but this brew is all about the malt. The malts really give this beer a nice, smooth, creamy taste. Very full-bodied and very drinkable. This beer goes down with the greatest of ease, but is strong enough to be a sipper. This is comparable in a way to Samuel Adams Double Bock. I see a lot of similar characteristics. Either way, this beer is a must try if you have the opportunity!"
"* [ Update ] Oddly enough, the day after I wrote this review I recieved an email from LT stating that Double Bag will now be available in MA & NY. Excellent news!"
"The beer pours a nice ruby red color with a thick frothy offwhite head that fades slowly to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a very complex malt aroma that boasts of pale and crystal malts along with a fruity yeast finish. The taste is awesome. It is full of malts, bitter hops, and a slightly dry, but fruity yeast finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good altbier. It has awesome aroma and flavor; a great drinker."
"Surprisingly drinkable given the 7.2%abv for an alt! This is a beer you can drink all night long without you really noticing. A pleasant drinking big beer for the style."
"Compared to other alts, this one sits very high on my list. Definitely recommendable."
"Drinkability  This is an excellent effort at a little known style here in the US that is brewed out of CT. Somebody thoughtfully did their homework on this recipe. Well done, Long Trail."
"I love Alt Biers. This one is exceptional. Poured into a strait sided glass it had a rocky two finger head which lasted a five minutes or so leaving plenty of lacing. Floral/malty balanced aroma. First sip was initially sweet (almost like a mild ginger bread) with a sharp long hop finish. I bought two sixes of this while in VT on business at a store in Woodstock, down the road from the brewery. (also picked up hit the trail and long trail...reviews to follow) Had the long trail on draft at Mulligans in Manchester. Sadly, my palate was fatigued from too many ""american adjunct lagers"" at the Equinox down the road."
"Double Bag was served from a 12 oz. bottle with a label illustrating a healthy pair of bags. In a pint glass, the beer was a beautifully rich red-orange color, and was topped by an ample, fine white head. The nose was rich and enticing, with a lightly roasty oatmeal cookyish maltiness and an excellent citric-vague banana fruity edge as a counter point. The taste was also rich and very well-developed, with a lightly astringent/roasty chewy malt profile that released some oatmeal-raisin cookie-banana and limey citirc flavors in the transition to the tasty, chewy (though still slightly astringent) malty, moderately bittered, light citric-fruity finish. I simply loved the flavors and flow this brew had to offer. To top it off, the body was perfectly bodied (med-full) with just the right amount of lively carbonation. It drank quite well too, even for a stronger beer. Double Bag is a top-notch brew!"
"On the whole, this almost seems like a different animal altogether than that served in the bottle. The juniper aspects were particularly surprising to me, happily, in the draught version. I only wish I didnt have to travel to Vermont to get this one fresh."
"12 ounce bottle with 'bottled on "" dating. pours almond, clear, with sticky well developed lacing. Nose is of some alcohol, malt and nuts. Malt is the deal here. Lots of rich, smooth, sweet and tasty malt. Nuttyness evident. Deeply flavorful. Warming at 7.2%. This is a fine sipper from the skillfull folks at LT. Widely available about New England. Very worthy ALT beer."
"This was the first Vermont brew that I ever enjoyed in the Green Mountain State. An excellent way to start, with this very well crafted ale. Highly recommended!"
"A neat beer, the malt character just seems a little dulled and the flavor lacked a special something. Good, but nothing I will seek out."
"This is a rather nice beer. It pours a nice dark amber-copper color. The head is not very significant and the carbonation is minimal. But this does not really distract from the experience of enjoying this beer. The smell is of sweet malts. The taste is very good. A mixture of nice malt sweetness. The mouthfeel is a wonder to enjoy. Definitely a beer to give a try."
"This is one of the best altbiers I have had in a long time."
"Simple cream colored head over rich gold clear ale. Nose is lightly toasty, malty sweet, and flowery fresh hoppiness. The taste is just as the nose, very drinkable with flavors of sugar sweet malt blasted away by quite bitter hoppiness and some slight warming alcohol too. Finshes long, warming and bitter...a superbly crafted Sticke Altbier."
"Hazy amber body, beige head, almost yellowish. Aroma is well structured, very malty (maple, nutty) accompanied by subtle grassy hops and a mysterious woodiness that I couldn't describe better than cedar powder. Very crisp mouthfeel, highly carbonated medium body. Honeyish malt, grassy/earthy finish with a nice mild bitter touch. Solid"
"Poured out a nice copper color with light carbonation. Smell consisted of a variety of things. Some caramel, malts, nuts, toffee, and some toasted aroma. Taste is quite malty mixed with some nuts in there. Some hop bitterness comes towards the end and mixes with some spiciness. I wished there was a little more carbonation in this beer. But other than that it's a good beer."
"I'm not really sure how I feel about this beer. I didn't really like the first one or two I tried, but as the week passed, and the six-pack dwindled, it definitely grew on me. Still not my favorite though, and I'm not sure I'll revisit it soon."
"Poured into a pint glass, small very slightly off-white head, which quickly depletes to a film of bubbles. Laces slightly during the drinking process. The definition of amber in color, with perhaps the slightest tinge of orange lurking in there. Malty aroma, with evidence of alcohol even in the nose. Powerful malt in the taste as well, with the hops and alcohol pretty much balancing themselves out in the background. A warming yet drinkable ale, apparently made for the slopes from which Long Trail originates."
"Drinkability is somewhat limited by predominat alcohol hit."
"A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut."
"This beer produced a frothy head that quickly dissipated. It was deep amber in color and smelled...mediciney. The flvor popped at first but it didn't last. I found myself wanting to keep drinking this beer as if it made me thirsty for it. I was happy to try this beer since it is not available in Pennsylvania, land of crap liquer laws. This beer also has an interesting story behind it. I would definetly recommend it. I think I could live happily in Vermont."
"I was a bit dissapointed with this one. It was a nice enough burnt orange colour with a nice, yet modest, thin white head. The aromas were all over the board, but they contained the ""melon-like"" aromas that I have only previously picked up in the recent Thomas Jefferson Tavern Ale from Yards. The taste was very melon-y and not very ""alt-like"" (or ""double-alt-like"") at all, IMVHO. The mouthfeel was creamy yet thin and the drinkability was not the best. This brew is definately Interesting and different, but it is also definately not one of my favorite alt biers or strong ales!"
"A solid beer that I will have more of."
"on your face after a couple!"
"Dark amber color on the pour with a modest sized head that is frothy in texture and a light tan color as it diminishes in size the laced formed is a nice coating upon the glass. Nose has a nut like sweetness, and the hops play a part in the fresh crispness, start is also sweet and loaded with malt, top has a moderate feel to the palate. Finish is frisky in its carbonation and the hops prankish in their spicy bite; bone-dry aftertaste that lingers on perpetuating the taste of the hops till the last drop is drained form the glass."
"Taste is alot like the smell. Nutty and malty, spicy and hoppy. Very balanced with the sweet malt contrasting from the hoppy bitterness. Medium bodied with with a thick and sticky mouthfeel. Lingers forever on the tongue. Very drinkable for a dark malty brew. Very appropriate for fall in New England."
"Pours a nice copper with white head. Smells of caramel malts and breads. To me the taste profile is very similar to their standard ale, which IMHO is quite nice. A very easy drinking beer for having a relatively high ABV. The label isn't bad either. If in New England seek this out."
"Nice dark coppery appearance with decent head and nice lacing. Smell of malt with hints of alcohol. Taste is full bodied with a slight astringency from the higher alcohol content. Decent mouthfeel for a 7.2 abv. A definite sipping beer...very warming....seems very suited to a winter's day in front of the tube watching the Pats."
"This was a good one! Big thanks to Bierman9 for it!"
"Medium brown shiny carmel in color. Hard pour produced a nice full size fluffy tan head. Filled the glass nicely. Sublte toasted carmel malt smells. Nutty too. Very pleasing. Taste is all malt, all the time. Very good toasted, nutty quality to it. Touch of sweetness like hazelnut or something. Moderate carbonation, no hop presence noticed, but doesn't detract from the enjoyment of this one. Flavors were all very good and the toasted flavors and high abv, 7.2% make it a nice drinkable belly-warming ale."
"Finish is all bitter hops - pretty powerful and then gradually fading. Verra nice!"
"The brewery calls this a double alt, and it's not a bad description of it. It pours with a nice amber color and a thick white head. It has a nice aroma with a strong maltiness to it and a moderate hops smell. It has a wonderful rich malty taste with just enough hops to give it some nice bitterness and a good finish. Mouthfeel is a bit dry, but that doesn't really take away from it's drinkability. Quite a good beer."
"Very interesting beer. Dark copper/light mahogany colored with a light orange head that dissipates quickly, but laces the glass. Aroma is a little hoppy, with some hints of pine and citrus and little bits of alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth, but carbonation tingles a bit. Taste is crisp, not strong considering the ABV. Flavor changes throughout the finish and aftertaste. Malt and hops upfront, citrus, caramel and plum in the finish, and some caramel, fruit, and alcohol in the aftertaste. Excellent beer."
"Great ""double alt"" which in the true spirit of its style, drinks like a meal. Poured a large tan head, which was fairly quick to fall leaving behind a sweet and malty tone. This sweet tone made the double bag an easy drinking strong one. Kudos to Long Trail on this one."
"Now here's a kick ass beer....a double alt is something new to me but it seems to fit that style....it is rich, sweet and syruppy, but also exhibits alt bier like characteristics...pours an impressively clear dark orange.....nose smells a bit like a scotch ale minus the smokiness....malty...some alcohol (like rum..and even some nuttiness....with some floral hop notes....I mentioned the body, but it finishes with a nice tight dry hop bite....that really seems to balance this out and make it special....the taste is very malty....sweet plums,pears,mangos....but then there is that nice dry finish....this is really a dandy..a big giant ZAP thanks to Bierman9 for this beauty...."
"Average appearance.I expected more from the appearance from this beer.Poured a small head that reduced to almost nothing.The color is a dark amber to red.Aroma is excellent with a well-balanced blend of hops and malt.First sip delivers an immediate warming feeling to the stomach due to the ABV.Alcohol is noticed but not overpowering.A very creamy malt thickness with a real bitter finish.Full bodied with a ton of malt.This is Long Trail's best brew.Well balanced malt,hops,bitterness,and alcohol all in high amounts.I would certainly buy this again,but drinking alot of these would be out of the question.Sweet malt taste with trace amounts of lacing.Hail the Double Bag!"
"First time I've had a beer which labels itself as a ""double alt"". Whatever it is, it's definitely a fine product. Nice amber color and lasting head with a definite malty emphasis although hops are by no means lacking. Excellent body which might be expected from a 7% brew. Would make a good winter seasonal but fortunately it's a year-round product. When I purchased a 6-pack in NH, it was priced no higher than Long Trail's other products which makes it quite a bargain. I had a Sierra Nevada Celebration just after the Double Bag and didn't find it to be any tastier - and I love the Celebration."
"Pours out a nice copper amber with a white head. One will fall in love with the malt flavor of this wonderful Alt ale. The mouthfeel is superb. Feels so good and tastes so good. A touch of hops finishes the sip quite well. This brew has everything going for it. We drink it all night long! If you're in the VT area get yourself a case. You will not regret it."
"Drinkability: The alcohol sneaks up on you since this beer is quite smooth and drinkable. I find it funny that drinkability is used as a criteria for shared thoughts on beer, since it seems such an individual choice."
"Not too impressed with this offering. Poured a deep amber, just a wisp of a head. Had a sweet porter taste to it. Hops were definitely lacking. The ABV was not over powering. A good malt base though. It went down smooth enough. A good beer, but just not impressive."
"This beer is perfect for the winter time, as the higher ABV definetely provides much needed warmth. An aggressive pour brings about a small tannish head that lasts a few minutes. While the malt flavors dominate, they don't overpower. I was a little nervous that it was going to be too sweet for my liking, as some stronger ales are, but this brew was very drinkable and very well balanced. Another great beer from Long Trail."
"Cheers!"
"Without even seeing the label I knew this beer was going to be a big beer. Although the alcohol didn't come through in the aroma, the thick, malty, sweet smell had to have been hiding something quite sinister. In color it was copper leaning towards brown with a head that managed to hang in there for a while. When I poured it there was a little bit of sheeting on the glass. The carbonation was big. Mind you, I don't mean it was overcarbonated, just that it had big bubbles. I guess because it was more viscous than some. Also, big malty taste with caramel and bread crusts. The hops were bitter enough to balance. After the beer was swallowed it was warming. That's when I knew it was well over 6% abv. Very nice, hearty ale all around. Another good one from Long Trail."
"Thanks a million to pbrian for sending me my first ""double alt."""
"An exceptionally well brewed beer. Very well balanced with the alcohol mostly hidden. Light enough to enjoy more than one, but also full of flavor. Highly recommended."
"Pours a nice copper color with a creamy tan head that sinks to a thin lasting head and leaves a nice cligning lace all the way down.  The smell is just loaded with toasty caramel maltiness.  There is also some decent spicy alcohol aromas floating around in their.  The brew opens up with the intense creamy maltiness flavors that have some light caramel flavors to them.  The chewy malt flavors last right through to the end with some nicely subdued hop bitterness and some warming, spicy alcohol in the background all along.  This is one intensely creamy and chewy brew but it manages to not get into the too sweet area and does not becoming cloying or sticky which keeps the drinkability high.  This would be a great brew to enjoy in the cold winter but fit me just as well on a cooler summer morning."
"a little too malty for me, but not an undrinkable beer. as a strong ale, this one is pretty good. somewhat sweet malt and a smooth rich consistency. i can't say i would get it again, but it was not the worst strong ale i have had"
"This is a quality strong ale.  Nice roasted malt aroma and a deep copper color introduce a nicely balanced body of mild malt sweetness.  The smooth medium body makes for an easy drinking warming beer."
"Not knowing what to expect, I anticipated that this beer would be heavy and rich.  I was correct in that it was rich and inviting, yet not heavy.  Contrary to my belief, this beer  has a lovely rich texture and taste, with an abundance of malt.  I thought this beer was so good, I was saddend to find I had only one.  It's almost dangerous, being 7.2%, but a pleasure to drink.  This is why I love beer."
"Nice citrusy nose. Body is very malty, just a little sweet. Has moderate bitterness with more citrusy flavor giving it a more refreshing taste than you'd expect from a beer of it's darkness. Very drinkable and pleasant. My main complaint was that there was no head. Maybe the trip from CT to GA by mail harmed the carbonation a bit, though."
"Not alot of head, looks like a cloudy red uneventful ale.  Sweet maly and cherry nose.  It does taste so much better that it looks.. what a shock...  Bursting with malty bitterness and a wonderful.. full mouth.  I was taken off guard but for once, in a good way.  There is also a spice bite in the finish.  I like the bitterness alot, and am unaware of the 7.2% ABV.  Great for cold weather months..."
"After roughly 2yrs, this has gained incredible additional character. Nearly pumpkin-pie-esque with its spicing with ginger and cinnamon notes. Huge caramelly pears and apples. Dry cedar wood closure. Overall rating stays the same, but this beer sure hasn't. Just a fantastic brew, young or aged. This is an absolute favorite of mine."
"I first tried this beer several years ago and didn't really appreciate its uniqueness.  Mature, malty, but not sweetdeep, dark red color with a respectable headpleasant background of hop bitterness.  Great brew."
"Prosit!!"
"Interestingly this is described on the label as a ""double alt"". Never heard that term before, so I've learned something new! Anyway you catagorize it, this is an excllent brew. Deep copper color, great looking head. Rich malty aroma. Flavor and body are rich with a hint of chocolate. A pleasant alcohol warming sensation follows each swallow. Hops balance things out nicely. Good drinkability for such a strong, rich beer."
"An incredible beer, IMO. Well worth seeking out if you are anywhere near the Vermont area."
"Rich and complex ale.  A hint of alcohol on the nose first lets you know what you're in for but a grainy malt sweetness balances it off nicely.  Extremely drinkable for its strength."
"Notes: A very intense and interesting brew, well balanced and finishes quite clean for a brew that boasts 7.2% abv. This brew is called a Sticke (secret) Alt Style Ale, an obscure sub-style of the Alts that is only brewed as a specialty ( once in a blue moon ) in Germany, Long Trail has done it justice for an American brewed version."
