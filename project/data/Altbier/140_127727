Aroma was pretty muted, with only a slight bit of bready sweet malt notes, and just a touch of some grassy bits, although this is probably due it it's age. The taste is a little more pronounced, with a bit of roasty malt flavors and some citrusy fruity tastes. The mouthfeel was medium to light-bodied, with some nice lingering bitterness that stays on the palate. Pretty tasty, but just OK, not great.","timontheroad","Oct 29, 2014"

Breadiness from the malts lingers with just a touch of bitterness to lend the proper balance. Feels slightly chewy giving it a medium to full body. Malt is dominant, and proves to be a well made beer. Appreciated this beer much more the second time around. Would go great with some German fare like brats & sauerkraut.","jwhancher","Sep 29, 2014"

A very creamy palate starts with an initial fleeting hint of butter that quickly fades, replaced by biscuit with hints of caramel. The treatment of the bitterness in this beer is outstanding. It is assertive, present from start to finish but so well balanced by the malt. This is fresher than anything you will get imported from Germany. The imported stuff is often a year or more old and the hops are muted and some of the rich malt and grain flavors are hidden behind wet cardboard oxidation flavors. Here, the hops are in full bloom and a joy in perfect balance with the malt.","pat61","Sep 27, 2014"

Slight bready taste. The mouthfeel is smooth and a little thick with some cushiony carbonation. Overall, a pretty good altbier and worth getting.

4.25,19.7,,,,,,"Poured a gorgeous clear, deep copper colored body with three fingers of fluffy off-white head that slowly receded leaving minimal lacing. A nice looking altbier that is fairly true to style. Scents of sweet, bready, and grainy malt with a touch of caramel and very light levels of fruity esters most reminiscent of apple. Overall impression of the aroma is subtle, yet malty with a very light fruity ester presence. Good and true to style. Flavor begins malty and clean with light notes of sweet caramel and bready malt balanced by a moderate bitterness level with bright notes of grapefruit peel and pith and citrusy hops. Middle continues these flavors, though bitterness increases to moderate-high. Finish is medium-dry with notes of grapefruit peel and pith, bright citrus, light caramel and bready malt. Aftertaste is dry with lingering bitterness and notes of bready malt, light caramel, grapefruit pith and slight notes of honey. Overall impression is of a fairly bitter flavor profile anchored by a nice sweet malt presence that is rich and bready with caramel notes and a slightly more citrusy hop profile than is traditional for an interesting twist. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, very smooth in feel with moderate carbonation. An easy drinking feel that is quite pleasant. Overall this is a nice altbier. In many respects it sticks to tradition in aroma and in the malt aspects of flavor, as well as with its smooth mouthfeel. Yet it tries new things with more citrusy hop flavors. The end result is a fairly good take on the altbier style that is very pleasant to drink.","Auraan","Aug 18, 2014"

3.91,10.1,,,,,,"A finger's and a half worth of crisp dense light to medium khaki colored frothy goodness comprised of medium to large chunky bubbles...  Excellent retention...  Turns creamier as it settles a bit and begins to show a slightly rocky top...  The color is a medium to dark brown with a slight reddish hue...  There are also some light caramel undertones...  A moderate bit of quick paced swirling carbonation...  Smells like you just walked into a brewery...  Loads of toasted malt and boiling wort...  A light caramel and toffee sweetness lingers a bit beneath the surface..  Medium bodied...  Sturdy...  Satisfying and smooth...  Some light carbonation...  Robust flavor...  Brown sugar...  A strong nutty presence...  Roasted malts...  Boot strap molasses...  A light kiss of hop on the finish...  An outstanding brew and my personal favorite from the Beer Camp Across American collection thus far (only 5 brews in)...  Leaves up to the expectations from a collaboration between two superb breweries...  Cheers...","philbe311","Aug 15, 2014"

Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, pear, apple, light roast, light herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, light fruitiness, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, light fruitiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light yeast flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good altbier style. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Aug 06, 2014"

I'd have to say that this one is the surprise beer of the pack for me.

Here, the pine flavours are fairly dominant on the finish but the rest of the beer is just enough to keep things interesting. This is hard to judge as I have not had any altbiers brewed outside of Dortmund, but this is what I imagine an American take on the style to be.

Nose of roasted caramel and toffee sweet, subtle molasses notes, and hints of booze. Very rich and layered. Flavors continue with the rich character forward, with a caramel candy and roasted quality, subtle char, and an underlying bitterness. Smooth and rich in mouth, with a bitter, richly sweet caramel aftertaste. The finish is smooth, but surprisingly quick. Very nice brew.","GarthDanielson","Jul 27, 2014"

This is an altbier, labeled to be "anchored by a layered, slightly sweet malt body supported by citrusy hop flavor and aroma." It delivers on that promise fairly well, but lacks in the "malt body" department. The hops have taken over, and while I'd usually shout "Oh, hell yeah," the balance is off here. All in all, it's a good beer and Im excited to be working my way through the camp, with a full stomach and a sound asleep girlfriend.

Served in a stange/altbier glass, the beer pours an orange/copper/brown color with an inch frothy light tan head that stayed around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like caramel malt, dark fruit (raisins), bready/sweet malt and some light herbal hops. It tastes like caramel and bready malt, raisins, candied oranges, herbal hops, orange peel and a bit of nuttiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with moderate carbonation. I thought this was a good brew, definitely worth a try!","bluejacket74","Jul 20, 2014"

Nice aroma of creamy malt, but there's a freshness from the hops, slightly citrusy with an herbal and/or vanilla note, to provide a light counterpart. The palate is all toasted pumpernickel and caramel, but it finishes dry and surprisingly bitter. The toasty malt lingers a very long time. It may not be the most exciting of styles, but they did a very nice job while putting their own spin on it. The more I drink this one, the more I like it.","TongoRad","Jul 20, 2014"

3.98,12.1,4,4,4,3.75,4,"Poured into an Euler stange. Pours a nice red coppery amber with a one finger khaki head with good retention and lacing. Unusual aroma of sweet malt and floral hops, not quite what I expected or like anything else I've had; intriguing. Flavor is drier biscuit malt with only hints of caramel, light rye and fruit sourness, with grassy, mildly citrus hops that linger into a spicy, mildly herbal hop finish with dark bread and rye. Light to medium bodied with active carbonation. Not a traditional altbier, although the basic darker biscuit malt, light fruitiness, hops and basic dryness are present. There is a rye-like mild tartness and flavor although there is apparently no rye in this brew. As a rye fan, this is no distraction. An idiosyncratic, but nice take on a altbier. The somewhat more aggressive hops, expected from Victory, work well here. I liked this a lot and as my first beer from the pack, a very positive start.","LiquidAmber","Jul 10, 2014"
