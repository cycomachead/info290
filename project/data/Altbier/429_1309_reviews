"Smooth, sweet, balanced amber with just the right drink ability. Good beer to drink with just about anything and for just about any occasion"
""
""
"(Our little red rooster).   Strong copper color. Like a shiny Lincoln penny.  Sweet floral smell.  Very smooth taste for an amber."
"Pint at Uncle Buck's in Grapevine, Texas with #dodgechargercrew!"

""
""
"For an Amber, it is not the best."
""
"One of my favorite beers. A Pacific Northwest feel and taste. Very good"

"A decent Amber. Nothing out of the ordinary. A good intro to the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall this was a really great Amber and a great beer overall."
"too sweet, off-taste, not hoppy enough, not strong enough...not good enough"
""
"It just didn't do it for me."
""
""
""
""
"Worth the trip to Juneau.  Had it at the brewery and was amazing"
""
""

""

"Not a very good brew, just okay. One of those ales that just misses the mark, and I had this one right in Juneau Alaska where it's brewed."

"Nice, smooth drinking Amber. Could throw back a few of these."
"Best alt I've ever had"
""
""
"Overall: a nice selection of flavours and a pleasant combination of sweet, sour and bitter. A good mid-range altbier."
""
""
""
"Good stuff. A classic and one of my favorites"
""
""
""
""
"Much better on tap than bottled, for whatever reason.  This review based on the bottled version."
"Well balanced amber ale that tastes a lot like a standard brown ale."
""
"I used to enjoy this way back a few years ago. I think it just doesn't stack up against others of the same style. I based this rating on a beer I had on draft at a sports pub."
""
""
""
""
"I can not say enough good things about Alaskan Amber.  It is creamy without being thick, sweet without being saccharine, hoppy without being bitter. Just toasty, caramelly (I realize this is not a word), and generally perfect.  I have tried hundreds of beers and this remains a mainstay in my household."
""
""
"Not bad. Very drinkable, but more like an ""alt-lite"" than a typical altbier."
""
"Deep red.  Smooth. Slight Bubblegum or fruit. Good stuff"
""
"Solid Beer smooth and tasty"

"Floral hops, toasted caramel malt, and specialty malt fruitiness form the aroma. Flavor is based in specialty malt fruitiness, with a caramel malt backbone, floral notes, and a touch of a bitter finish. Very drinkable brew."

"Almost like yummy bread, well balanced."

"Another very smooth beer from Alaskan, no overpowering hops, just right on the hoppy side, enjoyable beer with a very slight honey aftertaste. A little high on the carbonation, a little above medium carbonation.  I like medium carbonation, would have been a higher rating if the carbonation was lighter."
""
""
""
""
"Medium body to slightly less, medium to a little above carbonation."
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a nice example of an Altbier, it had all the aspects that I would expect from the style and it had some nice balance with no off flavors.  This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, fairly clean, crisp, not filling and the taste did decent job of holding my attention, I could see myself drinking a few of these, especially in the fall.  What I liked the most about this beer was how true to style it was, it was a straight up true example of an Altbier.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, there isn't anything about this beer that I disliked or would change.  I would buy this beer again when in the  mood for the style and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Altbiers or malty beers in general.  All in all I was happy with this beer, it was just what I expect from a good Altbier and nothing else.  So far this is my favorite beer from this brewery and I think it's close to being one of the better Altbiers out there.  Good job guys, this was a nice tasting Altbier, keep up the solid work."
""
""
""
"Overall (3.28) : I'd drink it again but I wouldn't buy a six pack. If it were on tap and my other choices were not as good, I would choose Alaskan's Amber beer. I'm not sure if Alaskan considers themselves to be a ""craft"" beer, but as of now from what I've tried, I'd rate them only slightly better than Shock Top..."

"Taste / Palate: First up is a medium body mix of bready sweet maltiness blending with the same dark fruit notes from the the aroma. The finish adds notes of roasted almond and a mild balance of earthy dryness from hops. The palate feels smooth and somewhat slick."
""
"Slight Begian taste, not wanted in an Alt."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 10/21/2014. Pours slightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, toffee, biscuit, light nuttiness, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice altbier style. All around good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and light earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"O: An OK session beer, but a bit underwhelming in my opinion. Would probably have gone better with a burger than as a stand-alone drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy copper/red with a thin tan head. Smells of sweet caramel and bread. Taste begins with some sweetbread, then some toasted nuts, and finishes with a slightly earthy, mild bitter finish. Mouthfeel is rich, medium carbonation. Quite a nice alt, a rich malt lovers dream."
""
"O: This is a drinkable beer. After tasting many other beers, Alaskan Amber seems almost light. The flavor is fine. The carbonation seems a bit much for this style. Needs more malt and less CO2."
""
"It gets the ""alt"" style, but it's not my favorite."
""
"Overall: Alaskan Amber is a very pleasant and drinkable alt style ale. It has some wine-like qualities due to the fruit flavors. Most excellent."
"O: Good drinkability. A bit too sweet. Nevertheless, quite pleasant, smooth and easy drinking. Recommended"

"Alaskan Amber pours a reddish color with a nice decent size frothy head. There is a weak malty aroma. The taste is very light, has some nice biscuit flavors near the end, with a noticeable malty flavor. A little flat, and very weak flavors. Overall it has nice flavors, but its just too weak."

"12oz bottle poured into a Catalina Brewing Company pint glass. Pours a nice dark brown copper color, not much retention or lacing. Smell is malt, biscuit, molasses, and a little yeast. Taste is different than I expected, I thought this would be more of a Newcastle type brown ale, but it's not. Taste is more sweet than expected. Malt, molasses and brown sugar with a bit of a sour finish. Guess it's more an altbier than anything. Pretty decent brew."

"Presentation: Packaged in a short twelve-ounce brown glass bottle with a pry-off crown, served n a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

""
"Went great with the salmon bake in Juneau where I tried this. Lucky to have that experience. Lacks complexity or a large character, but certainly one to try and to enjoy."
""
"Dark copper with good clarity, super dense head with good retention, white & fluffy. Aroma is caramel and bananas, makes me think of a Dunkelweizen. Caramel / Toffee flavors with a lingering sweetness on the finish. Much sweeter with more yeast character than other alts I've sampled, which I assume were more of the Dusseldorf style. Strong malt character but just too sweet for me."
""
"Beer is medium-bodied, with medium-low to low carbonation levels, leading to a beer that has a smooth (3/5) and slightly foamy (2/5) mouthfeel. Closes dry, with moderate stickiness coating the lips and palate."
""
""
"Overall - This is a very easy beer to enjoy, nothing is offputing, but nothing stands out either. Good balance, but I'd say definitely malt forward. I wish the CO2 was adjusted upwards a bit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Above average. Nothing amazing but also nothing that disappoints. I would give it a try."

"O - This beer isn't anything to write home about, but it definitely isn't bad. I really enjoy the caramel flavors that you get in the after taste. The color of the beer is also quite nice. I wouldn't have a problem drinking this again but I'm in no rush to go out and buy more. I'd say give it a try if you're into ambers."
""
"O: This beer is quite malty but there are enough underlying hops so it isn't rendered undrinkable. It doesn't seem to have all of the complexity as German altbiers."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Nothing really special here. It's not too sweet and not too bitter. Better than a lot of beer out there but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- after I finished this beer it felt like I had just eated a Rolo good beer"
"Smell - Malty. Sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is a winner as an everyday beer. Given that six packs are going for $7 in my neck of the woods, you really can't beat the bang for your buck. It's tasty, easy-drinking and smooth. This is an easy choice for showing up at a party with a small, cheap offering."

"Overall a pretty average amber ale. A tab bit bitter and not unique by any means but a decent choice given limited selection (as out here in the Northwest it is a pretty common beer even at places that only have a few choices). Amber in color and I saw another poster mention cheerios when describing the smell and color...actually I think that is pretty spot on so I will go with that. I generally drink out of a bottle...drank at my wedding due to limited beer choices (no kegs allows, only bottles, only bottles the venue carried)..."
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass."
""
""
"Chilled down to 36 degrees in my beer cooler. Poured into a pilsner ""8-ball"" pool ball glass (I have the whole set of 15 glasses). Pours a pretty copper/bronze in color with really no head to speak of. Just a bit of lacing is seen when sipped. The aroma is of just some malt/hops. The taste was actually very pleasant with a slight nutty hint. Very smooth with no bitter aftertaste. Never had this style of brew before and liked it overall."
"Thick creamy head was the first thing I noticed. Not a bad beer. Less flavorful than I expected. I would buy again if selection was limited. Overall a slightly better than okay beer. good color. decent aroma. A beer you could have multiples of at one sitting."

"O:Nice representation of the style. I am not a huge amber fan, but I did enjoy this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice looking pour with a surprisingly light colored foamy head. Clear burnt orange appearance is also pretty pleasant. Nose is mainly nutty before the maltiness takes ovee, with the taste strictly following the nose's lead. The taste initially bares a nuttiness that ever so briefly presents a faint banana essence before the malts overwhelm all else. Finish is ""blech"" with a cloying sweetness. Pretty high level of carbonation here as wwll. Overall, this is fairly average."
""
""
""
""
"O: Above average beer, but I like the Alaskan IPA better."
""
""
""
"Poured a rich amber with almost no head. What head formed was an off-white. It got the amber part down, but it's nothing too special. Scents of sweet malt, bubblegum and slight banana. Pleasant, matches well with the flavor, but again, nothing too special. Flavors of sweet malt, a little bit of toffee and a slight nutty flavor on the finish. Pretty nice, similar to a brown ale, but with a slightly more German flavor profile. Hop character is low, but is present, balancing the sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Good for a session beer. Overall I'd say it's a pretty good beer. I can see this being a good session ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall - A nice Amber. The beer is friendly but a little lacking in character."

"Overall a very good beer, but the carbonation kind of detracts from it for me. Digging the aroma and flavor, but the bubbles are a bit too intense."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoy altbiers as they blend the best of ales and lagers together. This is a tad too sweet and I would to have seen a bit more of the lager side to quell the sweetness. Not bad at all though."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I didn't have high expectations going in, but I am leaving the Alaskan Amber very impressed. This makes me want to grab a few more ambers to compare. This original recipe is from 1900… I don't think this beer will age that long! Cheers, everyone."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I like it, I'd drink it again. Nothing special at all, but I do enjoy the sweet malt taste of it."
""
""

""

""

"Had on tap at Elliots in Seattle. Nice frozen glass. Outside of the glass, I was very underwhelmed. Copper appearance, no head, little lacing. I smelled...and smelled...nothing. A malty chemically type of taste. Went down well, more of a large consumer type of taste which is fine if I can get 30 of them for $20. I was expecting more, don't know why. Hate writing reviews like this, but this disappointed."

"O Pretty standard/vanilla (un-unique) amber, not too special, but not bad. Had on tap at the Big Fish in Grapevine Texas."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very solid above average amber, interesting to have every once in a while. Easy drinking beer, great session beer. Having only one on the day, I'd reach for something a little more interesting."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good choice for an American made amber ale without the overbearing hop profile which the west coast has imposed on the style. it compares well with British pale, ESB or German Alt beers in flavour and food pairing. If you have tried it in the past, and were ""unimpresesed", try it again properly served. You'll be glad you did!!"
""
"Pours reddish brown with fast white foam. Quick dissolving. Bubbles active. Toffee forward nose, caramel. Light malt - watery. Feels kind of hollow, like some flavor profile is missing. Mild hop, little bite at the finish. Cloying. Had hoped for more."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I would have liked a little more complexity here but i'm not going to complain. A better than average lager that drinks easily. Although not mind blowing by any means, I can't find anything i truly dislike with this Amber and that suites me just fine."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad malty offering, there is a nice body of work with sweetness here."
""
""
"This beer never does it for me. It's well-made with good ingredients, and has some heft. Maybe it's TOO well-made, if that's possible. A tough beer to get sloshed on, though you might enjoy it with a big piece of beef. Maybe it's better coming from a tap..."
""
""
""
""
""
"D- A tasty beer that goes down very easily and is a solid good representation of style. This is a nice solid beer with a good amount of substance that makes it worth at least a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I hear that this can be found in quite a few supermarkets in the West. All that does is make me wish I could find this in any ordinary gas station liquor store - I'd sure as shit pick this up over Fat Tire any day of the week."
""
""
"The process necessary to make Alaskan Amber is part of the iceberg that people don’t see. A beer like this requires better ingredients, more patience, and a closer attention to detail. That being said, all those expenses don't exactly add up to a more unique (nor impressive) offering. Alaskan Amber is an altibier I was quick to drink, but won't be quick to drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A good beer that6 could make for excellent sessioning. Definitely worth a try!"
""
""
""
""
"Pours amber with a 1 finger head that quickly dissipates. Little carbonation. Smells of light peach. Taste is smooth and easy going down. This is their flagship beer and to be honest, I’ve never been much of a fan. I’m going to skip the formalities since just about everyone has had it. I can never get much head on it like they have in the picture, but I’m guessing that was poured on tap. It’s too sweet for my liking, so in that way I think it’s more of an Amber than and Alt, but it definitely has some Alt characteristics. Alaskan brews a few great beers, but this isn’t one of them."
""
"This is a different tasting beer, glad I tried it. That being said, I probably won't pick it up again."
"This beer poured out as a clean looking brownish red color. The head on top was cream colored and soapy looking. The smell of the beer is basically all malt, not much in the way of hop aromas. The aromas of some grains and toast come through with some caramel also. The taste of the beer was sweet with a dull earthy bitterness in the finish. The caramel and toast notes balance out pretty well. The mouthfeel of the beer was drinkable, decent carbonation and medium bodied. Overall it's not a bad brew, happy I finally tried it."
""
"Pretty much the definition of an average amber for me."
""
"O - The best of what was offered. Solid tasting Amber."
""
""
"I'm going to pick up a six pack soon to have some in a bottle around the house. A really good beer."
""
""
"Nice session beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A very good malt forward beer with a nice richness to it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not something I'd spend money on (on purpose) but not something I'd drainpour either."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber color with an off-white head. Sweet toffee and caramel malt aroma. A touch of bread, sweet grape, and a little bit of red fruit. Maybe a hint of banana. Sweet malt and grape on the palate. Toffee malt, a little bit of toasted bread, and some red fruits. Minimal hoppiness, just a little bit of floral hop character."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, dark copper color with a quickly dissipating off-white head. Very nice aroma consisting of sweet raisin, sweet banana, and pumpkin spice ice cream. The aroma takes me to September/October for Oktoberfest. Maybe even the Covered Bridge Festival, if you've been in west-central Indiana in October. Mouthfeel is characterized by being light to medium body, soft, and wet. The flavor is a bit of a disappointment. Heavy nutmeg and cinnamon from start to finish. A little Dogfisheadish in their aggressiveness with spice. A lot of pumpkin pie and Oktoberfest. Not great, but certainly drinkable."
""
""
"One of the more enjoyable alt beers I've had. I think this is a really good beer that drinks exceptionally well. Quite surprised by this one."
""
""
"This is still one of the better alts you can readily acquire despite its flaws."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"You can not find this out east here in New England."
"Overall Impression- Didn't quite impress me with the lack of hops... Overly carbonated and too sweet all around. Should have more of the dry hops I found in the aroma in the taste. Not sure about this!"
"Very smooth. Medium body, yet pretty creamy. Carbonation is very nice."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a glass mug. Pours amber with a tall, frothy biege head that dissipates moderately quickly. A finger-length of head is retained. Plenty of bubbles can be seen streaming from the bottom of the glass. This beer looks to be very well carbonated. I pick up caramel and bready malts. There are some mild hops in the aroma as well. The taste follows the nose. It's mildly sweet and bready. There's a little bit of hops in the back end, but it's not strong. It's just a nice, malty beer. The body is medium with adequate carbonation. The finish is dry. The drinkability is high. This is a very good beer."
""
""
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This pours a clear amber color with a short lived white head which does not leave a lacing. The smells are of caramel and a little bread malts, slight hop presence. The feel is medium. The taste is okay, I get a slight hint of something metallic along with mostly malts, caramel, bread and toffee."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a very clear reddish, burnt orange color with a soapy head that quickly dissipated. Smells of bread and caramel malt with just a bit of earthiness. Nothing special, just a hint of bitterness and some sweet toffee flavor. Has a nice medium body with moderate carbonation and a dry finish. This is a pretty average amber ale, but it is nice and drinkable."
""
"This is a tough one for my overall score. Tastes pretty good, but the lack of any real head or lacing on the glass makes me lean towards a slightly lower overall rating. Still, I wouldn't hesitate to grab another one to wet my whistle..."
""
""
""
""
"For a beer that travels from Alaska to the midwest, I'm astonished it is so fresh. The color and initial taste remind me more of a brown ale and not an amber. Light still passes through the glass but the color resembles more of a dark red, brunette almost. The malts lean that way too. I taste a nice roasty chocolate malt that reminds me of a good brown. The hop finish is nothing more than a little bitters to balance out the malt. Underrated beer I will say."
""
"This beer pours a clear, reddish-orange with a thin head and no lacing. The aroma is fruity with caramel and vanilla coming through. The flavor leads off with caramel with nuts and spices with smooth, piney hops showing through as it warms. It's mouthfeel is medium. Alaskan Amber is a good brew, refreshing and satisfying. Recommended!"
"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma has a lot of toffee and a little bit of biscuit malt, as well as a hint of grass and some earth. The flavor has quite a bit of malt, plus some orange citrus and a little bit of grass. Very easy to drink. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation."

"Overall: This beer was above average, but barely so. It was a nice beer that can be drank throughout an entire night. A good beer, but overall not exceptional."

"Poured from bottle date 081112 to a pint glass the beer arrives a clear dark copper amber color with a 1/5 finger cream/off-white head with some retention and lacing, but not much. The nose is caramel sweet with an undertone of toasted barley. A hint of fruity nature as well. The flavor is very much the same, malty, with a semi-sweet presence. Mildly bitter, hints of fruit and nuts. Very easy to drink, very approachable. Earthy hops are mild in flavor. Creamy. Very enjoyable. Finishes smooth and creamy and clean. Adequately carbonated and lighter bodied. Not a ton of flavor, but this is an altbier, and one of the most enjoyable and drinkable I've had."

"Very standard amber beer, like what you'd find in any generic brewpub or brewery in the early 90s. I hope Alaskan's other beers are worth trying."

"Clear copper color with a moderate tan head. Sweet malt dominates the aroma. Hints of light fruit and mild hops. Light sweet pale malt dominate the tip of the palate. Light floral hops bitterness sweeps in quickly behind. Toffee take back the court in in the finish and shares it with some berries. Overall an easy drinking brew."
""
"D - A solid Altbier, a style that I wish had more representation in the craft beer market... Simple... Low ABV... Well executed... Rather quaffable... Easy drinking... Sessionable..."

"overall an approachable amber/alt style offering that represents the style in a somewhat solid, albeit unspectacular fashion."

"Pours a rusty copper with some fine latte foam atop. Smells of sweet malts and a hint of vanilla and almost cinnamon. Flavor follows suit with sweet malts, a hint of dry wood and some herbal hops (faintly). Medium bodied with light and airy carb. Decent enough beer. I would be able to drink it in moderation. (3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5/3.5)"
""
"Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a dark orange amber with a fine one finger head maintained by active, attractive carbonation and lacing. Mild aroma of sweet malt, light, somewhat estery fruit and a hint of hops. Flavor is sweet caramel malt, light fruit with a rather abrupt malty hop finish. Body is moderate edging onto creamy; a nicer mouthfeel than I'd expect from a modeate ABV ale. Taste is understated, but very pleasant and refreshing. This is one of my favorite back up beers for locations without a big selection of craft beer."

"A simple well crafted session ale with appreciable carbonation. Sessionable as designed, geared with enough flavor to hit the spot but nothing memorable in the overall build. Worth trying."

"O - Didn't really enjoy this one. And a bit disppointed because I've heard good things about Alaskan Brewing. It is an ok altbier; just not a preference for me."
""

"Poured into a standared pint glass, dark brown in colour, thin tan head... smell/taste is roasted malt, quite thin on the palet.. very tasty/easy drinking and worth your time... just not very exciting. should be very easy to track down at any store/gas sation here in the PNW."
""
"A lightish amber with a decent enough head, though nothing to write home about.Aroma is on the sweet, bready side you'd expect from an amber, but not aggressively sweet. Taste is a very balanced malt sweetness with some clean but mild hoppines. Medium bodied, somewhat creamy but still nicely carbonated. A very nice, sessionable amber."

"2finger head which quickly dissapears followed by a large amount of bubbles rising from the bottom. Well carborated for this style of beer. Not much in smell. Maybe some buscuity/bread aroma. Taste is very balanced. Biscuits hit the palate with a swwleet honey flavour which captures the beer as its main focus. Very enjoyable during these cold winter nights."

"one of the more drinkable ambers ive had recently. pours a lighter shade of red, with a decent white head. smells malty but balanced, less sweet than most, and doughy a little, but not raw in any way. flavor is terrific, really round flavor, perfect balance and an appropriate mouthfeel. medium bodied and soft. this is a session amber all the way, nothing too sugary to rot your guts, not too malty to fill you up, not too anything. perfect after a hard earned win with the hockey team. affordable too, will be purchased again"

"Dr: Extremely drinkable. Pairs very well with wings. I'd definitely get this gem again."

"Picked up a single for $2 from Princeton's Liquors. Appears a crystal clear orange-ruby red with a short head. The aroma has a soft toffee note with a hint of fruit juice. The flavor brings out a little more dry malt with a hit of clean grain under the gentle esters. While not the most flavorful alt, it's quite drinkable and worth a couple pints."
""
""
"This is a decent Session ale. It is a nice alternative to the glut of Pale ale's and IPA's out there. A noble attempt at a German classic. May not ever be the best in it's style but certainly worth trying again."

"Pours half a finger of creamy head that disappears after the first sip. Crystal clear copper color that shows off the carbonation. Plenty of malt and caramel smells eminating, with nice sweet fruity tones to complement. A small amount of acidity in the nose, but not overly so. Tastes much like the smell, big malt, fruit, some acidity, and a slight bitter aftertaste. The aftertaste is my biggest complaint on this beer, as I found this fuzzy, bitter/sour flavor that I didn't much enjoy. The carbonation also carries this same flavor to the front of the profile. Body is hearty and appropriate to style (and very enjoyable). A nice representation of Altbier, drinkable and warming, but needs some work around the edges."
"O - Nothing too complex here, a straightforward amber. Not what I would consider a go to beer by any means, but it does make an excellent alternate to the normal selection at my local convenience store."
"Very simple, sessionable."

"Pours a clear, amber color. 5/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, citrus hops, slight earthy malt, hint of honey, and slight grain. Fits the style of an Altbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, caramel malt, hops, slight pale malt, hint of grain, hint of yeast, and a hint of citrus. Overall, good feel and blend."
""
""
"Tasty stuff and true to style, as far as I can remember. Served at a good temperature and poured with a lovely, light tan, foamy, frothy, billowy, fluffy head that lasted a while and plenty of lace. Color is a clear dark amber with loads of bubble trails. Aroma is malt, a bit of roast, toffee. Flavor is malt, slightly sweet, balanced nicely with tang and a bit nutty. Body is just right; ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor, balanced, and without flaws, tapering with average length. Decent brew."

"Altbier are hard to come by in Texas (ironic considering the heavy German infulences) so I was thrilled to try what is probably the most well known one in America. Alaskan Amber is a juicy amber colored beer with nice drinkability. Light fruit notes like fig and raisin are present. Lightly carbonated and very mellow. A pretty good flagship session beer. Overall it was a beer I enjoyed."

"Overall, a prime example of a larger craft-brewery production; always a great stand-by brew if you're hankering for something malty and balanced. Goes great with salmon, pizza, etc."
"In the taste, clean and dry, with hops lending subtle wood notes. Mild suggestions of caramel and toffee. Fairly malt focused in the profile, but with an expert balance. Light to medium bodied feel and markedly dry. Overall, a well crafted amber brew with a drier palate."
"Overall, this is a pretty good brew. I wish I had a traditional alt in my repertoire to compare it to, but I do not. I think the one way to improve it just a bit would be to add just a little more bittering hops to balance out the syrupy sweetness from the malt. A very easy drinking beer that I would recommend to newer craft drinkers to ease them along their path."
"O - A bit weak on flavour but very sessionable."
"O: In terms of availability and quality this is one of my favorite beers. There is nothing amazing about it but it is a fantastically decent beer."
"Overall, this is a decent brew, but it doesn't blow me away. I'm not ultra-familiar with the style, however, and I'll have to revisit this down the road to see if my tastes refine."
"O- A nice amber/alt, just wouldn't go to alaska for one."
"Overall: A good simple amber. Very drinkable."
"Mouthfeel: medium-thin body with excellent carbonation. Smooth."
"O: I enjoyed this beer. It's certainly very easy drinking but sometimes that's just what I want"
"Altbier? I would have guessed a basic amber, but so be it. Bright amber with moderate head. Caramel malt is forefront, with mild grain sweetness. Body is mid-range, a little chewy toward the end. Hopping provides a moderated bittering that mellows at the finish. Not sure there is quite enough interest to qualify for a session, but the beer is well-built and would be a good food pairing."
"O) This is a nice easy drinking beer. It's not one that will have me saying, ""Hey you gotta try this beer."" It is a solid offering, and if you're looking for a pretty good amber, it's definitely worth a try."
"O-A nice flavorful alt, would be glad to have again."
"Overall, a very poor effort. I appreciate the need for light, sessionable beers in your lineup, but this is a perfunctory effort at that, with little inspiration and minimal character. It's a slap in the face to some of the great Altbiers I've had."
"Overall, not my favorite Amber, but I'd drink it again."
"After having this again, I noticed that it's really a beautiful looking beer. Dark orange-red, but still crystal clear. Got way more foam this time around."
"Poured a clear medium brown color with a good two finger head on it. Has a very good aroma of caramel malts and dry hops. The taste was crisp and clean which I was able to pick out flavors of roasted malts but not quite the extent they are used in heavy stouts. Overall the taste was very smooth and mellow. There has been a lot of demand for this beer over the year in my area of Wisconsin. Finally glad to see it here on tap and it was just as delicious as everyone said it was. A great everyday amber beer!"
"Overall: sweet but ot offensively so. Otherwise a standard amber."
"Overall: I really enjoy this as a sessionable beer, as well as a great example of an Alt-style brew"
"Conclusion: It is nice to see a larger brewery use a different style for their ""amber"" than the usual darker pale ale. Altbier isn't a common style in the US, so that fact alone makes this example stand out. Overall this is good, but it isn't fantastic."
"This is a very good beer. I am so glad it is one state that is less then 3 hours away for me. i will be making trips to WI for it. This beer brings me back to the nice summer to fall day as a kid. I don't know why. I really enjoy this beer. Cheers!"
"Ov- Excellent altbier. Spot on."
"A decent brew. Reminded me of some early ambers that were my gateway into craft brews."
"Pours a see through golden brown hue which leaves a two finger creamy that slowly recedes and leaves sporadic lacing,the smell is ripe berries,sweet toffee malts and flowery floral hops,the mouthfeel is between light and medium bodied and has tastes of brown sugar,sweet toffee malts,flowery hops,maple syrup and is finished with spicy berry dryness and overall its a nice ALT thats very sweet,spicy and sessionable cheers."
"very similar to Fat Tire Amber Ale, but less foamy head. The slight banana esther was a plus to me, but otherwise it was only an average beer."
"Dark amber in color with a beige head. Malty aroma with caramel and some fruity notes. Flavor is sweet caramel malt and a little brown sugar and fruitiness with a tiny bit of hops. Smooth palate, medium body. Decent but unremarkable."
"Clear, coppery red with a short cap of beige foam. Decent head retention with some spotty lacing. Bready malt aroma, some toast and caramel, light fruitiness. More toast and caramel in the flavour, not overly sweet though with grassy bitterness that balanced the malt nicely. A bit of fruit and bread crust in the finish, along with faint spiciness. Medium to light bodied with carbonation that leaned more towards creamy than crisp. Overall, pretty tasty. I could see myself enjoying a few of these over the course of an evening."
"Nice full Amber, love this on days that don't make sense. It is a great way to unwind with friends and has a nice full body flavor, unlike other Ambers that I have tried. give it a try and see how you feel about it. I did notice that it has won a few awards of its own, so I guess besides me liking it there have been a few professional judges too."
"O – Drinkability good. A good amber for your in-laws or Joe BMC. 3"
"Nice multi-tinged dark amber color with just a wisp for a head. Nose is caramel malts and a hint of dark fruits, maybe raisins? Full bodied in the sip with nice smoothness. Tasty but subtle malts and some late smokiness make this one unique and sessionable. My parents killed a sixer of this quite quickly, now i know why."
"D: Nice and malty, yet refreshing - it went down fast on the Vegas strip; glad to have this again! An altbier with just a smidge more of a punch than a traditional version."
"Overall: A very decent amber. Fairly light but tasty. The hints of lemon help balance the malts."
"T – Overall, I guess I can see why some like the flavors, but overall an okay beer, but not something I’d seek out again. (3)"
"Overall I rather liked this beer and I'm glad there are a few more of them in my brother's fridge!"
"O: A very good beer. Great malts in this one. The lack of much bitterness with a clean finish makes the drinkability good with this one."
"O- Very easy drinking beer well carbonated, I would not buy another one, but if offered to me I would have no problem drinking it again."
"O: Its okay, okay drinkability but I would get tired of it after a few. Haven't been too impressed by Alaskan Brewing yet, nothing bad, but nothing really good."
"O: pretty decent ale. Good session brew."
"While this started off very flavorful, it weakened with each sip. It is slightly watery, but a good malty styled brew."
"Overall, a decent amber with a lot of malt flavor. I’d have one in a sitting, but that’s about it."
"Mouthfeel is silky smooth making this easy to put down your throat.  There is a patch in the middle where you get a sting of carbonation and bitterness but that fades into the finish that thinly coats your mouth.  It's so easy to drink I have to remind myself that this is actually an alcoholic beverage.  Very tasty and satisfying despite the lack luster nose.  Well done and one that I'm sure I'll encounter again... and again, and again... well you know how it goes my fellow beer lovers.  If you get your hands on this one try it!"
"Alaskan Brewing is now in Minnesota so I picked up some singles. The flagship amber is a pretty decent beer, has a little more going on in the taste than some ambers I've had."
"I drank a lot of this beer before I was really into beer. Living in the Pacific Northwest, it was one of my favorite refreshing summer beers. So when Alaskan started distributing to Minnesota, I snapped it up. I still like it; it's refreshing and tastes pretty good. I'm not blown away by it, and its place as a summer staple is more due to nostalgia than taste."
"Pours a nice amber color with a small thin head. Aroma is malty with a hint of caramel. But the aroma is nothing special. Taste is the same, some malts and caramel, lightly sweet. But again this not anything more then your average amber. Its certainly easy to drink, and would pair well with bbq or burgers etc. Just nothing you need to chase down."
"Clear dark amber or copper colored with one finger of head that had good retention. The head settles to a thin cap with just a light speckling of lace. I smell caramel from the malt and some grassy hops. A bit weak in the aroma department. In the flavor the malt gives a little bit of toasted quality that I did not pick up in the aroma. Otherwise caramel and slightly medicinal flavor from the hops. Pretty well balanced. The body is a little thin. Otherwise had nice carbonation. An easy enough beer to drink but lacks excitement so I rate just better than average."
" Overall, this is a pretty basic brew. A little thin, and not as full of flavor as I would like it to be. Not a bad beer by any means, just not very interesting. It's quite easy to drink, and a decent session brew that would pair with many types of cuisine. However, there are other offerings from Alaskan that I would go for before this one."
"This beer pours a clear amber color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes quickly into minimal lacing. The aroma is of light caramel, and not much else. The taste is similar to the aroma, but a little weaker. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, and a watery texture. Overall, this is a beer I pass on next time. It is simply too bland for my liking."
"(12oz bottle). Pours a clear amber color with off-white head and moderate carbonation. No lacing on this. Aroma of caramel, cherries (?), roasted nuts. Taste is sweet malt with a bit of hop bittering on the end. Medium bodied with an oily texture. Fizzy on the tongue. An Ok beer, but I would not search this out."
"Overall: Very strong everyday beer and somewhat unique for a flagship. Not the best Alt I have had, but both refreshing and full-flavored, and that was about all I expected."
"Overall, a mediocre amber beer. It is malty sweet and kind of cloyingly so."
"O: Very easy drinking beer that I'd pick up a lot if available here in Nashville, then I'd get tired of it and stop buying it all together."
"Overall, an average tasting not very complex beer that didn't have too much interesting about it, but plenty drinkable."
"O: This is a solid offering considering the style. I wish I had more room in my suitcase to bring home a few cans."
"D: I haven't tried many in this style, but it seems like a decent example of the altbier style. It is very easy to drink. I'm sure I will have not problem going through the six pack."
"Mouthfeel is too thin for the start and only does just enough to make the rest of the beer solid. Carbonation is nil and it would have helped at least a little bit. Drinkability is good due to the finish and lack of overpowering flavors, and the abv is fine for long sessions too."
"Taste is also earthy and mild, no noticeable hop presence, maybe some toffee, caramel to it in a small amount. A weird chemical bitterness to it. Easy enough to keep around for someone who doesn't like their beer bold, merely serviceable."
"Overall - A decent beer that would be decent for a session. The look of it was a little disappointing but it still had a drinkable flavour."
"D- very sessionable, not a bad beer to have if your just relaxing or doing some yard work."
"The flavors aren't very intense but they're well balanced and are good with most meals. A slightly sweet beer with caramel dominating the sweetness while a hint of cherries or strawberries also helps out. The malt is controlled a bit much but it is also present."
"Well gotta say this is a great tasting fun drink, I would have again and it is easy drinking. Love to try this on tap."
"A good beer that can be consumed often. Not too heavy like some of the other stuff we purchase, I always like to fallback on this beer for sure. I haven't had many altbiers, but this was definitely a solid brew coppery notes tin head with minimal lacing definitely an everyday drinker nice kick yet not too strong. Definitely one of my fall back beers."
"D- was good not the greatest amber but the taste was there ,the flavor was there and so was the drink ability"
"Hops are a slightly spicy interlude in this otherwise fairly straightforward malt number. Body is somewhat full, although the mouthfeel seems a bit watery. Finishes sweet but fairly dry, and I can taste a metallic astringency in the aftertaste. No big deal, but this one is a little boring."
"As many times as I've seen it on the store shelf, I regret not picking it up sooner. One of the better Ambers."
"Clean finish, and is very easy to drink. Overall, it is average for the style, and something to have a few of while whale watching in Alaska, or fishing, since it won't distract you."
"D - This is my first Alaskan beer and I was pretty impressed...I do like altbiers but they are hard to come by and I was thrown off by the amber name...this was a good beer with nice caramel and fruity (apple juice!) notes"
"D- Quite different than some of the other Alts I've had. Not too bad but also nothing to write home about."
"drinkability - this is a nice beverage to have a few of and not think too much about it"
"Pretty good amber/altbier, nutty and caramel malt sweet and little hops. Pretty good, pretty good."
"D) At first not impressed but this one grows and opens up as it sits."
"D: It's a little sweet for my liking. I think a bomber is plenty."
"Dang, what a good beer. Drinkability is amazing with this beer, it just goes down like nothing! Appearance is red like an amber beer should be. The smell is slightly malty, slightly sweet, with a subtle hop note in the back. Once you take a taste the hops are a little more present, still nothing overpowering by any means. Just a very easy drinking beer, with a nice balance of hops and malts. I will be getting this one again."
"Pours a light amber color with a thin tan head. Little to no lacing and a slight collar. Nose is pretty light with some bready malt and not too much else. Maybe a touch of earthy hops in the background. Taste is bread crust and a light sweetness. Faint caramel and hops. Feel is quite thin and a bit undercarbonated. Drinks alright, but isn't anything special."
"Drinkability: Not a bad little beer. Doesn't taste like an adjunct. Maybe this is where I just don't get an altbier? Not sure. Just doesn't seem that good."
"D - This is a very easy to drink good tasting amber one that I could drink a few of in a sitting this one is worth getting your hands on to try sometime"
"D- It's a vary drinkable beer it's not hard on your pallet. It's a good beer to start out the evening with. It's not my fav amber ale. But i could defnitley have another one."
"A very solid, drinkable beer that I can see myself coming back to regularly."
"Bottle courtesy of mikeg67. Pours a deep amber with a mall offwhite head. Nose is malty caramel, hops. Taste is earthy hops, sweet malts, some yeast, and light sweet spices. Has a nice medium body, good carbonation. Finish is sweet malty caramel, good bittering hops and some light sweet spices. Overall a very nice enjoyable and well balance easy drinking brew."
"12 oz. bottle I brought form San Francisco. Pours amber with a foamy white head and lovely carbonation. Aroma of perfume hops and caramel malt. Medium, smooth body. Flavor is a nice balance between caramel malt, ripe fruit and peppery hops. Great beer, I wish they sold Alaskan in NJ."
"The smell is really nice, reminiscent of crumpets drizzled with honey and sprinkled with pecans. Unfortunately this does not translate into the taste. The honey does remain, but the crumpets become biscuit and the nuttiness is gone to be replaced by floral hops that bring a balancing bitterness to the sweetness of the malts. I got some phenols out of the finish or I would have rated the mouthfeel higher. The date on the label was pretty recent, but the low ABV may have contributed to turning the beer."
"D: This is a nice, clean amber beer."
"D - Decent but odd. Not in a bad way, it's just sort of TOO nutty. It should almost be a brown ale, actually."
"higher carbonation, medium body. decent drinkability, I would have again. average to good beer."
"D-Glad I tried this, but it is not something I will seek anytime soon. Nothing especially impressive. Seen this in the grocery stores, but since it is always priced higher than good Oregon beers I have always passed it by."
"12 oz. twist-off stubby. Brewed with European and PNW hops to 18 IBUs. Nice medium amber hue, unfiltered?, with a nice clarity, fairy high carbonation, and a half-inch, tight-knit khaki froth that leaves light lacing. Toasty and mildly hoppy aroma, with distinctive yeast notes. Rich malts on the palate (crystal? biscuit?), with mild esters and a very light hoppiness on top of a light and crisp, dry body. A very sessionable, toasty altbier; I would call it a north German alt, if I were going by BJCP guidelines."
"Overall a tasty and simple amber."
"Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth amount of carbonation."
"Deep amber malty beer: the head dissipated quickly leaving a clear brown glass of roasted malty goodness. The richness of the malt is not overwhelming: my complaint about some alts is that they are overwhelming, but this is a nicely balance alt bier that offers flavor and some complexity but not overwhelming in any way. Satisfying."
"The taste is mild but with lightly complex fruit elements, a lot of toasty grain and cooked barley, light earthy and fruity bread crust, with a hint of caramel and a light leafy spiciness. Sweetish up front, it has a lightly earthy-spicey finish and somewhat sweet caramelly-fruity aftertaste. It's lightly sweet up front before a zesty dryness dominates the finish."
"Mouthfeel is good as well. Medium body feels lighter due to nice active carbonation. Finish is sweet and clean. This is a great session beer but lacks the complexity that a world class amber or alt should have."
"overall: very good beer interesting style I like this style with out the alcohol burn like the big old ales its a drinkable malty beer that makes the malts the star of the show and I really liked it good price for a 6 pack as well! I will buy again for sure!"
"Drinkability: An easy drinking beer with nice flavours and an accomplished aroma. Easily enjoyable but doesn't blow the drinker away."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and refreshing. A good beer to sit down and watch some football with."
"D: great session beer for an Alaskan cruise. I wouldn't seek this out but I would never have a problem drinking it!"
"A simple, skewed ale, but in a good, drinkable way. Good malty stuff. I could see having a few of these in a sitting."
"D: Yes, yes it is (drinkable). I'm not rushing out to buy cases, but I was told by the owners of Liquid Solutions (before their sad demise) that at one time folks from 'back east' bought this beer by the truckload - it was a sizeable chunk of their mail-order business. I can see the validity, a very tasty beer I need to add to the mix more often. Recommended."
"Rich, rounded flavour but just a little bit cloying and overly gassy."
"Pours amber with an average head. Smells malty. Has a malty and toasty taste with a little bit of hops. The feel is soft, not very carbonated. Overall, I would drink this again, but i wouldn't seek it out. It would be fine for drinking with the boys, but there are other, more common beers that I enjoy more"
"Not something Id go out of my way for but good. There are no bad flavors, its not to high in alcohol, and not too heavy."
"D: Very enjoyable and good when having more than one. This is one of my go to beers when working in Alaska."
"Pours an almost-clear, amber color with a great off-white (almost tan) head. The scent is unique...with a little bit of sour notes...also get some sweet malts and very little hops...The aromas do not blend that great, but they blend fairly well. The taste is definitely not what the scent leads you to assume. Immediately a get some sweet malts and some candy sugars...maybe a bit of prunes or other dark fruits. Then it just mellows out like crazy...kinda becomes watered down. Not very much hoppiness to this brew. The mouthfeel is descent. A bit on the light side. This is a great session beer in my opinion. And I know if this was a forum post, that annoying guy, Ding, would say this isn't a session beer,,, But I see this as a good session beer."
"Drinkability is a solid 4.0, enjoyable and lived up to my style expectations as my first Altbier. Cheers to Alskan Brewing! seem slike a nice mellow Marzen like ALe version."
"Pours a red amber hue, thin head. Scented with sweet malts, caramel, subtle. Taste is predominantly sweet malts with breadiness. Minimal hops evident. Not really my favorite style, this is still a good beer with quality malts and good balance for what it is. For whatever reason, Alaska brewing seems to have ridden to success on the back of this beer and while it doesn't bowl me over, it's a nice alt that's especially satisfying on a cold dreary day."
"last edit: 7/23/10"
"Over-all an average brew. I'm not knocking this product but not impressed."
"This a fairly typical example of the style all around. A nice brownish-amber color with an inch of tan head. A slightly sweet malt aroma with just a trace of hop scents. A biscuity, malty taste. Medium, leaning toward light, body. And decent drinkability. I rarely seek this beer out, but it's a reliable stand-by (along with Fat Tire and Mac & Jacks Amber) that's available even in the most redneck, logger, farmer bars around here. If your friends like the BMC products, you can happily drink this whenever you're with them."
"Highly drinkable, very mild, refreshing and sessionable. It's not the most complex alt/amber but it's well-balanced and very quaff-able!"
"D - This one is a quaff brew, I could easily tear into a six pack of this beer. I liked it, nothing wowing but I liked the balance and drinkability of it. I don't think I'd buy this one again, I'd rather go for a Brown, or a Red, not bad though."
"Taste starts out very toasty and crisp - full of malty graininess. As it progresses, it becomes increasingly sweet in an artificial saccharine-like way that's not necessarily bad. It's sticky and a little nutty. Feel is initially creamy, but the fast-fading carbonation leaves it feeling a little thin overall. Finish is slightly sticky."
"D - Very good beer with a tasty fruit essence. I would get this one again."
"Pours the color of rusty pennies, with some moderate dirty white foam. Somewhat nutty on the nose, with sweet malt and caramel aromas. Fairly thin bodied, with some caramel flavors and a crisp finish. Overall, this beer is too one-dimensional for me; some hoppiness would have been nice."
"Really pleased to have re-found this beer, most likely be years before we are reaquainted, a great pity because it is a well made beer in a style many brewers find difficult to produce (outside the Dusseldorf area)."
"Decent all-around, but not something I would go too far out of my way for."
"Alaskan Amber has long been one of my go-to beers, and this tasting reveals why. Not overly exciting in any way, but affordable and solid for what it is."
"I enjoyed this beer and am glad I was able to try it. I've only had two other beers by this brewer and the others have impressed me more than this. However, it is one of the best alt/ambers I have tried."
"Overall, a pretty fair beer, but nothing special."
"This beer is very true to this ""old"" beer style. One of the best American interpretations of a German beer I've had. I would certainly drink this beer again."
"Mmmm, this is quite a tasty amber, which is far from my favorite style. The biscuity and toffee malts are the main show with some background notes of honey, toast and grassy hops. Good, creamy mouthfeel with an ample amount of carbonation. Label says ""Alt-style ale", but to me this tastes much more like an American amber ale although there are some similarities. Maybe that is why I am liking it more than most ambers I have had. I am impressed with this one although I have yet to be disappointed by the few Alaskan offerings I have had."
"I would try this beer again."
"Overall, a really good beer that I get a high recommend. Only my 3rd altbier but best of the bunch so far. If I'm in a malt mood this would work nicely. Rotation - not avail here in TX so shipped back from my CO trip. If here, I'd get the occasional 6 pack and would be on short-list for best option on tap. [O;BO]"
"Drinkability: A very nice alt - not sure why they call this an amber"
"Notes: This one deserves a second try if only because I am left with the feeling that this may not be a fresh bottle, at least in the sense that I was expecting a rather different hop profile."
"D: A really easy going beer, easy to see why it's so popular."
"Flavor follows in the direction of the malt with a toasted grain and a thin caramel sweetness yet finishing clean and somewhat dry. Feel begins rather creamy but lightens as the carbonation escapes yielding a somewhat thin but not quite watery close towards the end of the glass. Malt flavors linger nicely throughout however. Decent drinkability, well balanced and not overly sweet."
"Drinkability: I'm finding this to be quite a drinkable beer. It plays well with a band jam session."
"A serviceable amber, passable beer. Enjoyed on tap at The Yard House, Scottsdale. A little sourness,like a drp of cherry fruitiness which also gave it an edgy drinkability. A bit amber colour, a little lace.Hops there, and decent balance. Average mouthfeel."
"Not only will I not have this beer again, it firmly plants altbier at the bottom of my list of beer styles. I wish this beer suited my taste buds, but it didn't. I guess I'm not crazy about overly sour brews."
"What the what? This is an Alt?"
"The body was a too light, and somewhat watery. But I suppose a lighter body aids the ability to pound 'em. This has enough flavor and drinkability to be highly sessionable if you don't want to be challenged too much, excellent for a newbie."
"Drinkability is okay, a session type ale, a bit too sweet and simple for my taste though to drink many of them."
"Still a nice enough beer, but really nothing to get excited about."
"Expecting an American amber, I was a little surprised at the subdued bitterness and rich malty/fruity character. Checking BA, the Altbier description seems well placed. Best had around 55-60 degrees, as that's when the great character of this beer seems to peek out."
"D- very sessionable, not a bad beer while watching the fight or having family over"
"D: Acceptable beer but nothing i have not tried in other beers."
"Pours a clear dark amber color with a decent tan head that quickly disappears. The smell is malty and fruity. Sweet malty taste. This could use a bit more hops. Medium bodied. Not the most flavorful beer out there but this is quite smooth and drinkable."
"I don't know what everyone else seems to be tasting when they state that this beer has ""aggressive hops"". This is a traditional Alt style beer and has much in common flavor wise with a German Pils or Czech Lager. The color is medium copper with a thin head that quickly dissipates to an average lace. The nose is faint but appealing with notes of apple and a slight hint of spice, maybe cinnamon. The palate is all lager as far as I am concerned. (Remember Altbier was made before Lager and despite being top fermented, they share much in common with Lagers are far as flavors). The traditional Lager character, that kind of old bubble gum flavor is present but it nudges out any other discernable flavors. The texture is light and doesn't suit the beer all that much. It is very smooth and drinkable though I could probably only top off two since it is rather boring. Better than mass production American lagers and pilsners but lacking any real identity."
"Drinkability: Alaskan Amber is a smooth, tasty brew. I'd gladly drink it after two straight days of crabbin' (especially since it'd probably the only thing available)."
"D - On a hot day, a few could ones of these would be a welcome treat."
"1195"
"Drinkability: A tasty, malty, and very sessionable altbier. I like the hint of fruit in the taste. Another great camping beer."
"Despite the sting, the carbonation is mild and doesn't interrupt the palate. It leaves room something a bit more distinguishing flavor-wise."
"D - Very drinkable. However, my recommendation is to consume only a few since they are a bit heavy and amber."
"D- Very Easy to drink, it goes down well. A good session beer."
"This was a beer I drank a lot years ago when the microbrew craze was in it's infancy. Having searched out bigger, badder brews over the years I've shunned this one as being too pedestrian. I am convicted of my snobbishness by how much I enjoy this beer - a solid session beer and one I will drink again when I don't need a West Coast hop-fix"
"D: A very enjoyable altbier; don't have too many experiences with the style right now to compare, but this was my third Alaskan Amber and I enjoy it every time. Extremely drinkable."
"Overall - A solid go-to microbrew, and one of my main choices at local bars, restaurants, or concerts."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice solid beer with a good amount of substance that makes it worth drinking for a long time."
"Well maybe that's why it was on special for 3.25 .. I don't know.. just was very unimpressed. Um. I probably should have just spent the extra 1.25 to get something really worth drinking. Well I know better next time. . I do have a nice buzz though.. Also what i like about this beer is the bottle design on the label.."
"This is a good beer. Something I would recommended."
"Pours with a nice head that dissipates quickly into nothing with no lacing. Great brilliant copper color. Not much smell a little sweet malt. Light sweetness on the taste buds, a little malty, medium mouth feel with a good of fizz. The flavor is slight which makes it very easy to drink. A good session beer, but not for amazing your taste buds as its a little boring after two pints."
"A very well crafted beer, that as expected, does not blow you off but is easy to put down."
"Overall, this is really nice! Drinks really fast, an I coulda easily kill several pints of this fine brew. Wish I could get it in Oklahoma."
"D - Very drinkable. If I could get it out in PA it would definitely be a regular."
"D - Very enjoyable and sessionable beer."
"NOTES: BBCSD-0905-GeoffV"
"First Alt. Looks great, but that doesn't translate to mind blowing. Smells like faint ale, like watered down Anchor Steam, and I think it tastes like that too. Not good, not bad, but definitely a weaning product for your freinds or a session beer. Not alot going on, but you could drink a lot of them and not feel overpowered."
"Dark amber in color. Lots of bubbles and active prickle upon pouring but the bubbles dissipate pretty quickly. No head. Smooth and fruity malt nose with hints of banana. Strong attack that is refreshing and has some effervescence. The flavor is definitely based in grains, but they are there to taste and not to dominate, pretty clean and easy. There are some sour notes at the finish and hints of nut as well. These qualities carry into the aftertaste. It seems to be robust for the alt beer variety."
"Dark brown body with creamy tan one-finger head, decent lacing. Malts predominate the nose, with roasty malt taste, but the hops are fairly well hidden. Active mouthfeel. Pretty sessionable and a decent interpretation of the style, but nothing spectacular."
"The beer is mild in carbonation and very drinkable."
"Pours a clear light copper color with a very wimpy beige head that fizzles into almost nothing within a minute of pouring. Nice full aroma despite the lack of head, with a big graham cracker character, Munich maltiness, and some honey. Flavor is very similar with additional accents of grassy hops, toffee, and even a touch of candied orange. A little light in body and carbonation. Very drinkable."
"A good brew. Would work well with a sausage & peppers grinder. A fine example of a style I don't get to enjoy enough. Worth trying it if you see it out somewhere."
"A stubby 12 ounce bottle poured into a nonic Imperial pint glass. This altbier appears a clear deep amber color with about two fingers of dense light ecru foam. No lacing to mention. Nose and flavors are of medium toasted grains, caramel malts, grassy, slightly fragrant bitter hops. About medium bodied with adequate carbonation for the style. Worth checking out."
"Pours a nice attractive amber color with a pretty decently constructed head that dissipates quickly. Smells spicy, musty, fruity and malty. Taste is a spicy malt with hints of citrus fruit and berries. Mouthfeel is a good body that leaves a nice aftertaste. Drinkability is good, a nice refreshing brew."
"D: I really enjoyed this brew, a good representation of the style. It seems to be one of the more widely distributed micro's in the Pacific Northwest, the Sam Adams or Goose Island of it's region and it represents the ""everyday craft beer"" title very well. A good reliable brew that's pretty easy to find in the NW, worth a try if you come across it."
"C - A really great beer that seems to be brewed to style. A great beer and definitely one I would drink more than one of! Though not a session beer due to it's slightly higher"
"Color is a light brownish amber color with a crisp easily dissapating light beige head. Aroma is of caramel malt. No hops. Flavor of sweet brown malt with a slight bittersweet finish. More like a brown ale than an alt. Mouthfeel is low with little belgian lacing."
"Drinkability - Very good. This beer could be consumed during any festivity or occasion by a wide variety of palettes. Good mass appeal. I usually expect more smokiness in an altbier, but this was still enjoyable."
"I found this in a small liqour store/tavern while passing through Wheatland, Wyoming on a recent business trip. While they did have Guinness and a few other ""premium"" beers, the Alaskan Amber was the only ""craft"" beer in stock - will wonders never cease. Since Alt used to be a favorite style of mine (thanks to Frankenheim) I was happy to give it a try. Altbier tends to be a very mild, inoffensive brew with little hop charactor, well suited for extended consumption - and that pretty well describes Alaskan Amber. The appearence was a deep brown typical of the style, with a nice head, somewhat thin body, a flavour more malty than hoppy, and just very mild all the way around. Maybe my tastes have changed, or maybe this is just an unremarkable beer."
"The best thing this beer has going is its drinkability. No real off flavors and no real flavors. Mild is a good word to describe this beer."
"It seems to lack the bitterness and dry finish expected of the Altbeir style. These comments do not distract from my overall impression, they are meant as a commentary on hitting the style guidelines."
"Drinkability - would try again, easy to drink but maybe as a second or third choice of available beers"
"D: A bit too sweet and cloying, but OK. A good value."
"Thanks to Colts9016 for this one. 12 oz. bottle served in a shaker pint. Poured a reddish gold (amber perhaps!) with a quickly dissipating head. Caramel malt in the aroma along with some sweetness. Light to medium bodied. Malt predominates, a little on the sweet side. Some hop bitterness helps to balance things out. Easy drinking beer, but pretty unremarkable IMO."
"Verdict: I wouldn't go out of my way to find it, but it's getting as easy to find as Sam Adams and it's always good to have a safe back up beer."
"Note: As far as I can see this beer meets the BJCP guideline with the exception of taste. Here, while appealing, there is a departure."
"Overall, Alaskan Amber is one of my favorite altbiers and I would recommend anything from this brewery."
"D: a fair Altbier"
"D: Goes down very smoothly. Not much like the strong alt biers and amped up versions, so this was a nice touch. Great to pair with food, glad I gave it a try. I think I was just used to the Stickes, this is far different."
"D: very drinkable, interesting flavors and quite surprising at that. This was a pleasant surprise, one I will certainly go back for."
"D: This is a decent beer that is quite easy to drink."
"ok drinkability. i wouldn't go out of my way to get this beer again, however, i would try more brews from this brewery."
"A pint of Alaskan Amber arrived in a pint glass with a shimmering copper color and minimal foam floating above. Caramel tinged roasted hops was balanced in the aroma by a light floral hoppiness. A big malt and grainy flavor on the palate up front followed by a semi-juicy center and a quick finish. A solid session ale from the sweeter end of the spectrum. Definitely drinkable."
"D - This beer is smooth and drinkable. It has a nice balance of malts and hoppy bitterness, although I would prefer more hop aroma and flavor."
"D- Very enjoyable, nicely balanced. I only wish I had more...thanks donkeyrunner."
"D: Easy, very easy to drink. Doesn't spend much time in the mouth without a struggle."
"Somewhat crisp for an amber ale. Tastes just like it smells with a toasty orange spice flavor. At %4 abv this is my ideal session beer."
"D - A nice, drinkable beer."
"Pours a perfect amber with a fluffy cream colored cap that retains for a moment or two before leaving some Hawaiian Island lacing. This looks very nice and inviting. The nose is a interesting blend of subtle fruit,mostly strawberry and caramel malts lightly roasted,honey oat bread crust as well. This taste uniquely like it smells. Strawberry marshmallow notes and very fresh malts,very clean and quaffable. Mouthfeel is light,yet sturdy. This is very good and very drinkable. This is like the Sarah Palin of beers, straight out of Alaska and aged well. Thanks for the bottle Paul."
"A bit more agressively hopped than most, but my palate really enjoyed the agression. Great balance throughout, but with that citrusy hop assertiveness all the way. Nice."
"Very drinkable, tasty beer, thanks to barleywinefiend for throwing this one in the box."
"Vic, This starts to make up for the extremely shitty can of Bud Light you sent me.Starts to make up for it but not entirely."
"overall; the beer is more an amber style instead of an altbier. There is a lack of hops in the beer. It's an ok beer"
"D - good drinkablity but a little to syrupy for me"
"Very light-tasting beer. Clear amber color with moderate head. Aroma of flowers and malt. Kind of like sweet bread dough. Tastes malty, with deifnite fruity-sweet flavors and and minor hops. Kind of a wheaty bitterness in the finish that was unexpected from an amber. Above average beer."
"D - This is very tasty and very sessionable. I wish I had more. It could be a good beer to introduce to newbies."
"D: Nice drinkability, woodsy, earthy and a nice beer that represents its environment."
"Good drinkable brew."
"Notes from 12/24/06"
"Have a ""Yukon Red"" from Yukon Brewing Company, if you can find one, instead. There's a ""real"" amber ale for ya."
"Poured with a nice deep amber color with a tannish head. Nose is a blend of fruit fermentation aromas and malty. Taste is also a smooth blend of roasted malt and slight hops, malty, syrupy, bread flavor to it and medium bodied. Drinkability is average."
"M/D - A little on the thin side. Decent carbonation. A passable alt, but nothing great. Very easy drinking."
"From a 22 oz. bottle purchased locally. Aroma is fruity - apples with some plum. Color is a burnt amber orange with a tan head that went away fast. Malty, toasty, some biscuit and evenly balanced with bitterness. Medium bodied and finishes dry but just sits on the tongue. Still an easy drinking beer."
"Taste is well balanced though slightly tilted toward the malts. Nice medium bitter finish. A very easy drinker. The abv may be 5% not 4% as listed. It certainly feels more like a five. Good session Alt if you don't mind the sweetness."
"Pours a red/brown color, non-cloudy medium sized head, very quickly diminshing. An aroma of hops, malt, sweet, flowers. Good smooth nutty taste, clean finish. Very tasty beer. I'll have to check out more altbiers if this is representative of the style."
"Don't know about the alcohol content, but it seems fairly strong."
"...this brew pours up a dark amber color with a light white head... the nose consists of a little honey... also malty... the taste is dried apple peel... medium bodied... spritzy carbo... pretty decent brew..."
"D: This is a very easy drinking, and flavorful beer, much better than I last remember. Goes down easy, I could drink on this all night."
"D-Very easy to drink but nothing sticking out on this one that sets itself apart to by it over something else"
"A good beer."
"Appearance has a light brownish amber with a crisp easily dissapating head. Smell is grainy, sweet malts. Taste of light malts blends to make a slight bitter sweet with the hops, slightly grainy. Mouthfeel is light with a slight viscous to it. Not much complexity going on in this Amber, but it does make for a good session."
"Drinkability: I'm not too familiar with altbiers, but tastes like a spicier amber to me. There's a slight stinging sensation created by the spices and carbonation, but other than that this is an easy drink. Not the best flavor though..."
"Pours a light amber, like a glass of iced tea. The head is slight and quick to die. The aroma is thin, slightly malty, but only slightly. The flavor is decent, slightly honeyish, but vanishingly slight on the finish. The mouthfeel is quite thin. This is drinkable but hardly an outstanding example of an Alt."
"D - this is a pretty decent beer. Very easy to drink and does not dominate the palate as some beers can..."
"D - This beer sort of goes down like pop. It's very smooth, but I think that the sweetness would get to me after awhile. This is a beer with appeal to to ""non-beer drinkers"" due to it's lack of hop flavors and smoothness. (My grandparents and father love this stuff) I don't think I'd buy this - but I'll continue accepting it for free.. :)"
"D - Due to the difficulty of brewing an alt, this isn't bad. However, they need to reduce the hops (for earthiness and color) and add more grains (will not be as dry)."
"D- Yeah its drinkable, not my most favorite from Alaskan Brewing, but it is still not too bad."
"I have to (with no offense intended) call this a chick beer. Also looks like a vodka cran. Just bothers me. Besides anyone who knows me knows I take my vodka cran without the cran. Probably won't be revisiting it myself but I'll grab a bottle now and then in case I need help getting the wife in the mood...to drink beer!"
"Drinkability- I thought this was a good beer I would like to try more by these guys if I get a chance."
"D: I was really impressed by this. Very enjoyable all by itself. Complex beer that becomes more so as you drink it."
"I've never been to Alaska, but would like to. However, this beer would not be the only reason I visit. As far as ambers go, this beer is totally fine. The appearance is spot on amber. Caramely sweetness in the nose and leading the way flavor wise as well. Mouthfeel is minimal - almost like water. Yet, for the averageness, this beer is totally drinkable and not offensive at all. This could easily beer paired with some pizza or nachos while watching TV or sitting at the bar with friends. Slight recommendation."
"d: very easy drinking, easy on the palate, not too boring. for a beer with amber on the label, its pretty good."
"Poured a light amber in color with a decent white head that stuck around. Aroma was slight cereal grains and malty sweetness. Taste was a little bland, some hops and malt. There was slight bitterness and sweetness to it. It has a decent texture, but it is a little light. I feel this beer is a decent beer but I never really enjoyed it. I would rate this as a good session beer for some, but for me it is not."
"Prosit, und Zum Wohl, MK"
"Though I've had this beer on tap, I'm reviewing the bottled version. Both variants are great - I'm very pleased with what this brew and I'm looking forward to trying other ones from this brewery. If you haven't had it, I suggest that you at least attempt to try it once (on tap, if given the choice)."
"Everytime I try this beer I seem to like it more and more. It has a good texture and feel in the mouth. It is tasty and refreshing to boot. Much better than their Summer Ale (Kolsch style)"
"Doesn't the beer always taste better when you visit the estabishment where it's brewed? While in Juneau, I stopped by and had a few brews. One of the brews was there Amber Ale. The color when poured from the tap was a deep golden amber with a fair amount of foam that dissapated but carried a fair amount of lace on the glass. The smell of roasted malts and fruit with a hint of spice filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste was even better. Roasted malts with a complex of fruit and spices. Like I said, being there has a lot to do with the evaluation of the beer!"
"A pretty decent brew, that is easy to drink. There's nothing too complex going on, but it makes for a great session beer."
"had at the 1st ever Stumelagram tasting ... been wanting to try this one for aaages! ... honey and meaty aromas .... some nice looking foam and head action ... a simple but really enjoyable beer... pours orange ... a very people friendly altbier ... happy to have tried it but ...next!"
"D: It has a refreshing feel to it, so it would be suitable for a hot day beer or an ""I want to get drunk"" session slammer, but I couldn't see myself seeking it out."
"Drinkability: Ehhh, leaves a lot to be desired. Maybe a bad batch. It's interesting, but remove a few of the chemical funk notes and it'd be a lot more enjoyable."
"Notes: Enjoyable stuff but not something I'd reach for too often. I can see this being great on cask, however."
"from a bomber, this poured a slightly hazy deep amber, nice off-white head and lacing. caramel and some nuts and vague light fruity aromas in the nose, taste follows suit. semi-sweet, could use a bit more hop bitterness to balance it out. creamy carbonation. mouthfeel is a bit bigger than the abv suggests due to the residual sugars and off-dry finish. would be a great session beer if it was a bit more balanced."
"Drinkability is the strong point here. A great session beer candidate. Tasty and light in abv. I highly recommend this one. Would have liked to try it on tap but time was limited and there were three great IPAs on tap on my few beer forays and also Alaskan Smoked Porter!!!"
"drinkability: this stuff is the kind of beer that you don't have to think about but you can. There's nothing offensive about it, there's a nice sweetness to it. I find this beer rather sessionable."
"Drinkability is this beers strong suit. A nice tasty beer that is really easy to drink. Nothing overly special, just a good session brew."
"I like it but I can't say I'd drink it all the time. Probably good with some spicy brats, whole grain mustard, spatzel, etc."
"I want to be critical, take away from the amazing accomplishment, but I'm lost for words. The lightly sweetened bread pudding that delicately runs over my taste buds has me ready to skip dinner and dive straight into dessert. The head is weak but the balanced toasted grain is so goddam yummy. This beer transports me to a long harvest table, decorated with rice pudding and malty sweet pastry breads. The oily sliver seduces me and I'm hooked. This is by far the hottest grandma in the woods, and even the milf hunters must turn to take a second glance. I'm in love, with an Altbier, and she makes me feel so, so good."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours a deep brown/copper color. Not a whole lot of lacing. Sweet, malty smell. Taste is very malty, sweet, with a nutty aftertaste. Not too incredibly complex. Smooth mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. This beer is pretty drinkable considering the ABV. A pretty tasty, average beer. Would be a fine choice for a session brew."
"I brewed a clone and it is going over really well."
"Simple session beer that's clean and tasty; perfect for a warm day."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle a nice amber color with a one finger tan head with decent retention. Smell of malts, grains, caramel and biscuits. Lots of flavor ...balanced sweet malty taste with some caramel, biscuits, and some hops on the finish. Well balanced with a lingering aftertaste of malts and hops. Nice brew!, creamy and rich. Definitely worth a try."
"The body is between light and moderate. Very impressed with how clean the yeast is on this. Understandable a good BJCP candidate and very refreshing."
"D- Checking out the alaskan brewing co website shows this is classified as an altbier by them. I found it a great beer to have with dinner. I'd consider picking up another sometime."
"Caramel malt and crispy clean finish. The aftertaste became sweet and mouthwatering. A really good brew! Interesting that BA has it listed as an altbier. It is a lot smoother and mellow, with more malt than most ambers."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a copper colored amber with a thin fizzy head that quickly disappears. The aroma is sweet biscuity malt and a touch of caramel. The taste is sweet and fruity malt that has nutty and biscuity characteristics with a touch of hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and full bodied. Overall, Alaskan Amber is a solid beer that is worth a try."
"I love all beer and given a choice between this ale and iced tea, would pick the ale any day of the week but this is not by a long shot the best beer I have had"
"Alaskan Amber might also get some bonus points because this is one of the beers that first awoke me out of macros to the bigger world of craft beer. Its also a point of bonding with my father who shares a deep love of this brew. But enough with the autobiography; I think this is good stuff"
"Easy enough to drink, a good sit-and-watch-tv beer. Somewhat drying, not particularly memorable."
"O/ M - Light spice balances it well. Nice malt and slight yeasty spice. Dry finish. Light to med mouthfeel."
"This is a decent sessionable beer. Nicely balanced with just a few flaws. It's worth a try."
"Drank pretty easy, not bad, but I actually prefer this in the bottle, weird"
"D - Very awesome beer, could be a perfect session brew. I'd wholeheartidly recommend this to anyone. If I ever get another opportunity to try this, I won't hesitate."
"M: medium-light body very smooth."
"The taste is robust for such a small beer. Big maltiness, dark fruits, background floral hops...this is a great session beer."
"Funny enough, it's probably better than more scores reflect just because it's just so all purpose. It's not going to blow you away, but it does everything really well."
"A pretty good amber. I'd try this again."
"Color is a deep orange, with a very light head. Smelled lightly of malt. Tasted of malt and a little bit of spice, with a bit of hop bitterness near the end. Nice flavor. The slightly hoppy bitter finish is intriguing enough that it keeps you wanting to take another sip. Very very drinkable."
"Poured this beer from the bottle into a session glass. The beer is golden orange and has a thin head which dissipates quickly to leave a lace. The nose is initially malty, some spiciness (nutmeg), some cabbage in the background. The taste is malt forward followed be an unimpressive watery finish. The mouthfeel is refreshing and crisp, could be better. This is an OK session brew."
"At the Reef in Point Roberts there is one lone craft tap at the back of the bar and it is Alaskan Amber. I must say that this is a West Coast session classic. ( Seems they started bringing into Washington State early on in the craft revolution). What works for me about this beer is the drinkability ( more amber than alt in my mind). The malt backbone is the main flavour which holds the beer together but the hops come through in the finish and most importantly you want another pint right after. Like Fat Tire or Full Sail Amber this is a food friendly drinking beer that is sold almost everywhere in the PNW(expect BC alas)"
"Good light body and carbonation. Very drinkable and a good example of the style. Alaskan Brewing always does a good job."
"A great session beer. Very easy to drink, I see as I have already reached the bottom of my glass. Nothing that will knock you socks off, but a very good quality beer befitting the style."
"Overall, nothing too exciting but this is a well made, well balanced and enjoyable brew. This reminded me a bit of Fat Tire, but better."
"22oz bottle that was amber in color (no surprise right?). The smell was a very nice fruity aroma. I liked it. The taste however was kinda funky and departed from the smell. It was very easy to drink and I thought it would be a decent session beer but I am going to have to drink this a second time to form a good opinion."
"Drinkability - Extremely drinkable. A beer which I could easily drink several bottles of."
"Md thick mouthfeel that washes off the tongue quickly, but not the teeth. Heavy carbonation is a detraction. Meh, I'm not likely to try this one again."
"Drinkability - a fine easy-drinking session beer."
"Overall: I tent to like extreame beers. This beer is a good one to remind me that there are other great beers out there that are not 10% ABV with 130 IBU's. Great beer. I have had it before, and I will definately have it again."
"Thanks to Fordest for this one- Pours a Rich, orange amber color with a some nice head to it. Smell is nice and toasty sweet malt and toffee. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Tastes is good and heavily on the malty side of ambers. No real sign of hops to speak of, but it is a nice, tasty easy drinking beer. I definitely enjoyed this one."
"I was introduced to this beer by my brother in AK, and can't get it here in NE -but I can in WY, came back with a case this past weekend. It's going to be hard to make it stretch out."
"The flavor has a nutty, toasted grain with some fading fruit quality on the finish. A simple brew that is very smooth and easy to drink!"
"Im glad I had the chance to try this beer.Its good,wish we could get the Alaskan beers on the east coast."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Chimay Chalice. Thanks Nathan for this one. Pours a light amber with a 2 inch head that fades away quickly and leaves almost no lacing. Aroma is malty sweetness up front but then the fruits come out. Bits o' apple and citrus come out in the nose. Taste is mostly malts with a little bready yeasts going on. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation. This is a all around great session beer."
"I've only had a few Altbiers over the years and the notes aren't good enough to do a comparison.. but as far as ambers go, Alaskan Amber would be a fantastic session and a great gateway beer for a macrodrinker wanting to expand their horizons. Overall, I should give these more chances to find a place in the fridge."
"Amber is the staple of the AK brewing co. It is a qutie average altbier. It pours the color of a penny with good head and malt smell. It starts with a classic altbier taste but quickly turns malty. Doesnt have the creamy fruitiness of an amber, but after one it gets much more drinkable. Good dark malt and fruit flavor but rather grainy and almost no hop flavors present. The bud of AK"
"Drinkability: A decent session beer, but not worth seeking out. Could use a little bit more depth of character and less cavity forming sugar."
"Could drink several of these, especially at only four percent alcohol, super light beer that goes down easier than most out there, another good beer from Alaskan"
"I needed something to last me till the weekend when I had more time to explore LA beer scene. Alaskan Amber was my choice at the local supermarket (Ralph's). And I am not disappointed. It is a very drinkable and tasty beer."
"Drinkability: I have never been a huge fan of this beer so I wanted to take a fresh look at it. It is a good beer. It is not my favorite Alaskan Brewing Company product, but it is a worthy member of their family. It is one of their best-known and best selling products."
"Poured into a standard pint glass well you guessed it amber a full amber at that a thinner off white head atop,very nice clarity to the pour.Lighter malt aromas like that of cookie dough with notes of caramel as well almost no hop really to speak of except for a drifting leaf presence but you have to try to find it.Mild malt flavors as well sweetish cookie dough with some caramel sweetness a touch of crispness in the finish keeps it from being to sweet.A no frills old school beer lightly sweet low in alc% to make it very drinkable."
"D- This is one of my favorite beers; although I prefer it on tap I am defiantly not disappointed with it in bottles. This is a beer I almost always have on hand"
"Good brew."
"D: I don't know about this one - it seemed to make me thirsty for something else."
"This was a rather drinkable beer. I normally enjoy this style of beer and this one was no exception. There are others who do this beer better but overall this is a solid choice."
"Comment: This used to be my standard bar beerit is a solid choice but after several sessions it fell into disfavor."
"drinkability: good"
"The Alaskan amber pours, you got it an amber color with little head to it. The smell is faint tinge of grain . The taste is a mellow and it has a balance to it between the hops and malt. It is light on the carbonation and the feeling on the palate is soft and a little floral in the finish. This would be a hot summer day beer for me."
"The mouthfeel is medium and the carbo is medium...it's pretty drinkable and somewhat sessionable, considering that it's only 4%abv, but doesn't stand out as very exciting."
"D: This is one I haven't had in a long time, went back to it and I'm glad I did, a good simple ale, and inexpensive to boot."
"A nice amber. The color is actually a pleasant ruby shade, very appealing. The nose carries a faint, indistinct trace of hops beneath a big, sweet maltiness - caramel or biscuit. Flavor had a bit of roastiness along the lines of a stout, suggesting some roasted barley. In all, a very pleasant beer to accompany my steak at the Dam Bar and Grill in Page, Arizona."
"Drinkability- Not bad for the apparent altbier classification. I guess I was expecting more of the classic amber ale. Has a nice creaminess to it that I did really enjoy and would probably be more enjoyable with food than sitting watching a baseball game."
"smells of grain and bready malts. tastes malty and has a slight fruity sweetness to it, very balanced taste. mouthfeel is medium-bodied and very smooth. this beer is pretty drinkable, i wouldnt pass it up if it were offered to me, but i dont think i'll be buying it again."
"The taste has an enjoyable malty presence with some notes of pear, plum, and raisin. Some hop shows up to balance out the flavor. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing with a well-carbonated body and a smooth, lingering caramel-malt finish. This beer is easy to drink, especially with such a low ABV. It's tasty, moderately complex, and nicely balanced, so I'd be willing to have it again."
"A light brown-copper color with a whispy head and little sign of lacing. A malty smell with highlights of vanilla and carmel, even a little pineapple. This particular pour seemed a tad flat, definitely undercarbonated but the flavor hangs in with the slightly sweet, nutty goodness. Malt and carmel hold but this one does disappoint in it's lack of carbonation. I would like to try it again, perhaps fresher to do better justice to its potential. Drinkable enough but not lively enough here. Promising."
"O- A decent amber ale with a small ABV and quite a bit of flavor."
"Has a copper colored appearance with a relatively small head which eventually laced away. The main aroma consisted of malt and that dominated the palate too. This was followed by toffee and slight nuttiness. This beer was fairly easy to drink, but was also a bit on the sweet side."
"Light copper color with a thin creamy head fed by a lazy progression of tiny bubbles drifting up. The smell is malty with a hint of hops to tickle your nose. The taste is a pleasant malt with oak flavors and a sour finish. It has a nutty taste that makes me happy. The mouthfeel is silky and as smooth as the head promises. The drinkability is great. I've got easy access to it for the next 10 days while I'm in Alasks and I plan to take full advantage!"
"This is a pretty straightforward, yet enjoyable beer. Copper to orange in appearance, it's a bit bready with some sweet dough and toffee. The flavors make way for some notes of caramel. As you would expect, it's on the sweet side, but not overbearing. At just 4% ABV, it makes a good choice if you're looking to drive your car afterwards."
"D-Very high. I can completely understand why this would be a very popular beer. 100% middle of the road in almost all categories. It is bland enough to fit in with the light beer drinking crowd while being obscure enough to give it some street cred with the craft beer group. I would drink this all day long hanging out with my friends...as long as they paid for it. It is just too plain jane to spend my own money on again."
"I even allowed my secoond one to warm a bit so it wasn't ice cold but I detected no improvement. Average Amber."
"D - Nice nose, but sort of boring tasting. At 4.0% this is a prime session candidate. A nice alternative to brown or amber ales....sort of reminds me of Anchor steam in a way."
"Thanks to bitterbill for including this one that I've been wanting to try for too long!"
"Toasty grain aroma with a citrus hint. Tastes biscuity and starch in mouth with a possible cherry note at the end. Starts promising, but dissapoints going down the throat- quite plain and bland. However, still quite drinkable in my opinion, but I was looking for a little more in an Alt."
"Poured a nice clear bright, but dark reddish amber with a decent white head that had a nice slow fade and some very good lacing. Smell was nice, a bit lit, ful of grain and bread tastes with a hint of yeast, and a slight bitter hop trying to work its way into the back, overall not bad. The taste was very full. Lots of malt flavors with a hint at a nice slightly hopped back. A very good session beer and a fine offering from Alaskan brewing. I am not the biggest fan of ambers generally, but this was rather nice. I could see myself putting down several of these with ease, a very good call!"
"Overall: on par for an average amber ale. Cereals and grains with some light fruitiness. I would have liked to see some more citrus character from the hops. When I think of an altbier I think of something with a little more complexity. A yawner."
"D: This beer is only 4%?!? The malts make me think of a strong ale that is twice as strong. This is a big chewy drink that rightfully is Alaskan's flagship ale."
"Poured to a dark copper color, with thin off-white head that dissipated quickly and left little lacing. Aroma was a very pleasant blend of malty dark fruit, peat and a hint of smokey wood. Flavor was not quite as pronounced, although more of the same. Mouthfeel was slightly sweet and rich, and finish long with a slightly sweet aftertaste. I could not drink many of these at once, but a good tasting sipping beer."
"D---I enjoyed it and I could drink this all night long but it is the polar opposite from what an alt should taste like. The yeast used contributed too many esters. It also lacked munich malt flavor and a clean lager characteristic."
"Mahoganycoulour with a minimal head. Raisins cherries dominate the smell, with an almost pumpernickle like malt aroma. Almosta portlike taste. There is a lot going on here, better than the typical amber ale, especially considering the elow %. Sweet aftertaste. Minimal hops. Tasty. The mouthfeel almost stings though, good body wierd carbonation. Interesting beer that i could have a few of"
"A wonderful dark copper tone with a tan color to the head (which was small due to the pour, but still tan nonetheless). A lovely doughy caramel and sweet malt scent wafted from the glass. Going down, the beer had a great and wonderfully drinkable creamy character to it. Sweet malt and caramel also took the show in the flavor department. Nothing too exotic, but this brew made for a delightful experience that paired well with both an Irish style meat, bread and cheese platter and the fish and chips basket that followed."
"I've enjoyed this beer before when had on its own, but taking a critical look, it's average at best for a craft beer and mediocre by the usually very high standards of Alaskan."
"Appearance was a brilliant red-brown with great amounts of white head with good staying power. Aroma was malty, and a bit reminiscent to me of the way a bock smells. Flavor was also ""bock malt"" flavor with lots of unexpected chocolate taste. Mouthfeel was good but almost coarse and chalky, which seemed to help rub the chocolate taste into my taste buds. I found this beer to be highly drinkable."
"A very drinkable beer, particularly since ABV is low, but nothing spectacular or particularly complex."
"If you are wondering how a guy from Massachusetts gets a beer from Alaska, I'll tell you. A friend from Albany New York gets this beer shipped from Alaska and i happened onto a few and i am glad i got a chance to try this beer that you cannot get in Massachusetts."
"It's not a bad beer, I'll certainly drink it again. Like a lot of the larger craft brews, it is a very well crafted beer. I just don't think it'll be my first choice on the beer list."
"Overall a very nice malty beer, but well attenuated and balanced. Can't believe it is only 4% ABV, but if so it packs a wallop of flavor into such a small package."
"What an interesting beer. I love a beer that doesn't fall into a category easily. I've had some altbiers, enough to know that this settles (grudgingly) into that style; however, to me it seems to have some slipperiness around its style edges. Its mouthfeel is slick but also chewy, full and buttery. Yet, the middle of the beer is brassy and slightly sour. Lacing is sparse. Head does not last long, and only a skim remains. But, a great deal of taste for a beer of so low ABV. Recommended."
"Drinkability is pretty good. I am enjoying quaffing this one watching College Gameday on ESPN."
"A fine mixture of satisfying flavor and a very modest abv make for a tremendously drinkable, and enjoyable beer."
"Overall, a good, drinkable beer, but not one that I'd buy very often. Drank it on its own; I think it'd probably be much better served with food."
"A very enjoyable beer."
"Drinkability/Final Thoughts: The light body and full taste of this beer make it a new favorite as a session beer. Heartily recommended."
"It was a clear red amber color with thin tan head. Lacing stayed for the whole beer also. The nose was filled with sweeter malts and was hard to distinguish other smells. It was a sweet beer with very light bitter aftertatse. Had the taste of caramel in it also. Pretty laid back malts and not much else. Was smooth and crisp. Not much was going on in it."
"After being restricted to Midwest beers (lived in IN for 23 years and 3 drinking years), this is still a treat to me. A good fallback and a cheap grocery store pick-up."
"The smell is mostly of caramel, with a bit of esters. The taste starts with caramel and malt, moves to a notable hop presence, and ends with grains. The mouthfeel is solid and pleasing while drinkability is good."
"A deep amber color with a light lacing around the rim. A caramel malt smell with a light sweet floral sent. The taste is light and crisp. Toasted malts and caramel with a slight hops spice and a sweet finish. The feel is crisp and has a light finish. In all this is a drinkable beer. Its a light amber beer with a clean taste and finish. Its flavors are not over powering. Its not a wonderful beer but is has good qualities."
"It is very drinkable and I'll be drinking more of this stuff while it's still on sale."
"Alaskan has named this their ""Amber," but labeled it as being an Altbier. I'm not real familiar with Altbiers, but it does taste quite a bit like an Amber to me. Pours with a pretty decent head and good color, but in the poor light down here in my basement I really can't tell you if that sienna/red color is just the lighting or if the beer is really that color. It tastes pretty good, with a pretty good mouthfeel and a nice, crisp citrusy zing to it. It leaves kind of a funny aftertaste though--I'm not sure why. Enjoyable. I could probably drink it with a nice loin of Alaskan Caribou and be perfectly happy."
"Overall impression: Nice beer, and a low enough ABV to be a great session. I enjoyed this the first time on a cruise in Alaska, but it is almost as good while land-locked!"
"This is an excellent altbier in my opinion. From the malty-floral scent, to the copper color and the off-white head that left sheets of lace. Taste was balanced with alternating doses of caramel and bread with some spicy hops and fruity yeast. Very drinkable."
"Very drinkable, I'd recommend this and will probably be grabbing the occasional 6-pack."
"Dark copper colour in the glass. White foamy head with good retention. Some very light toasted grain and malt aromas. Flavour is light, slighty sweet caramel and malty to start. Some slight fruity flavours as the beer warms. Very low, if any, hop bitterness. Finish is clean and crisp. A very drinkable beer, wish I had more."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. Fine balanced brew."
"A really great beer! Nice, unique flavor and very drinkable. Certainly a good beer for many occasions. My first alt, so I'll certainly look for other in the future."
"D: Very drinkable alt beer. Smooth and refreshing---could be a session beer with that low low low abv."
"Drinkability may be hindered by the mouthfeel. I've had other ambers that I wanted to grab for a 2nd as fast as I could, whereas this one, not so much. However, it wasn't hard to drink the one in front of me, so it wasn't all that bad. A pretty good amber. I actually like Speakeasy's Prohibition Ale as an amber better, just for comparison."
"Drinkability is fantastico!!! Nice to know that this is a readily available staple to the diet."
"Cheers!"
"D - Drinkable. A fair amber ale in my book."
"Decent mouthfeel, carbonation not too much. Drinkable, but not anything that leaves me begging me for more."
"Overall: This is a pretty good brew, I could have a few more without complaining."
"It was drank in the dive bar I had this in, so I couldn't accurately tell you what color it is. All I could really tell was that the head was rather small. It smelled fruity and sweet. The taste was citrusy, orange I'd say, and sweet caramel. The two were strong but well-combined. I don't know much about altbiers, but having read the definition on the sight here I'm not sure this is a very true depiction. It's too fruity I'd say. Regardless, I found it quite tasty."
"Drinkability: A decent brew, on the malty side but still well balanced. I think it is a well done beer and I'd take one if offered, although it is not one of my favorite tastes."
"This is a nice drinkable beer especially in the fall and winter, and I enjoy it. Ill have Alaskan Amber again, especially if it is on sale."
"-UF"
"Pours a clear reddish amber with a minimal head. Nose is clean, malt and caramel. Flavor is smooth, sweetness and malt with just a hop sprinkle to allow the other flavors the opportunity to be heard. Definately a beer to have more than one of, unfortunately I only had one :-(. Thanks Zorro for the bottle."
"Revisiting this review 2 years later after drinking this beer in quantity in Alaska. This is a crisp ale with a good orange caramel color and a sweet smell. The taste is smooth and slightly dry. A great starter ale for any previous non-ale drinker. My wife doesn't like ale but will drink this and enjoys it. Goes great with broiled halibut or sockeye salmon."
"Thanks to the forward looking distributors here in Arizona, we now have access to literally dozens of great beers from some fantastic brewers, one Im most happy to see on the shelves of my main beer palace is Alaskan Amber. The beer after its release from the 12-ounce stubby brown bottle sets in the glass a luminous deep copper with a pleasing semi-creamy light tan head that is modest in size, the lace formed provides a thin covering upon the glass. Nose is sweet malt, hints of caramel and maybe brown sugar, delightful at any rate, start is mildly sweet, the grain presence ideal and the top light to medium in feel. Finish is stern in its acidity, the hops polite in their spiciness, quite dry aftertaste, and to my mind and palate, one of the best session beers to be had here in Arizona."
"Bottle. Man, what a dissapointment. First of all, this isnt an altbier, no way in the world. Tasted more like Newcastle Brown, horribly sweet, caramel, toffee and nuts, soft, sweet rubbish, made me angry while drinking it, because i was expecting am enjoyable beer, which is not what it ended up being. Had this at a beautiful camspite on the Oregon coast with some friends, shame the beer was so bad."
"Pours a nice amber color with decent looking head that shrinks a little too quick, and little lacing to speak of. But it looks good otherwise. Smell is nice, a little grainy moving on toasted and nice and sweet. Taste is grainy and a bit of biscut to a very nice malty presense, sweet, and a balancing hop touch at the end. Good, full bodied beer and very enjoyable to drink."
"The body was light and smooth with a moderate degree of carbon dioxide bite. Altogether a very clean, smooth and drinkable beerdefinitely sessionable!"
"Pours a pretty copper-amber hue topped by a half-inch of creamy white head that fades fairly quickly. Aroma is of light sweet caramel malt with a touch of light fruity hops and a little metallic tinge. Palate is more light sweet malt, a bit of biscuity character, and some more light fruity hops. Medium-light body is just about perfect. I'm not sure I've had many German alts, but I have to say, the Alaskans can do this one pretty damn well. A great all-night beer."
"Drinkability: A versatile session beer that would match well with many foods. Ham and pumpkin pie come to mind."
"Smell was terriffic. Plenty of malt based aroma, mostly biscuity, some chocolate, caramel. Spritzy and light in taste, dark candy comes across towards the middle. Quite biscuity. Lingering spicy hop aftertaste, although mellow is welcomed to an otherwise smooth and strikeingly enjoyable alt."
"Drinkability: Nice and malty with some mild fruit and hop flavors. Very tasty and pleasant and would make a nice session beer."
"Cheer!"
"I had this beer at the Alaskan bush company . I also had it on tap at a local pub. Great pour creamy head, roasty nose, i could not compare to anything, miller lite was about the only othe beer they had to offer. overall very drinkable is it available in the mid west??"
"Poured a crystal clear deep amber color almost a light red with a fizzy white head that subsided quickly and left no lacing. The aroma is of a munich malt and caramel with no hops to be detected. The flavor is a tight mix of both sweet and toasty malts with a touch of that biscuit character which seems prominent in mass produced amber ales (Rogue excluded). Good flavor though i like my Alts a little more hoppy like Zum Ueridge and as this is an american example it is ok in it's own right. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery I expect that they had to use a more fermentable mash in order to make this ale cost effective though it could use a bit more body. A very drinkable ale this would make a great beginner beer for those who previosly only liked macros or would also make a good session beer."
"This seems to be a local favorite here in NW washington state, usually available in most supermarkets beer selection. Beer pours a nutty brown with a nice little head which dissipates with a few streaks of lacing. Taste like it looks, nutty without subdued hop characteristics and emphasis on the nutty malt flavors. Mouthfeel is acceptable though a bit thin for me. I rank drinkablilty high because of it is a solid all around easy to drink beer, a good choice for gatherings because I can't see anyone really having any strong complaints about this one."
"I am pouring into a pint glass at room temp. The beer pours a clear chestnut color with small fizzy and loud head foaming up 1 cm and fading quickly to nothing. Aroma is caramel and some bready yeast with a hint of brown sugar. Overall the nose is mild. First sip reveals an average body with mild carbonation. The beer is a little thinner than expected. The flavor is brown sugary with caramel and a bit of grassy hops on the finish. The beer is smooth and goes down easily. It is a good brew, just not overly complex, which I believe is true to style."
"Another winner from Alaskan Brewing Company..."
"Extremely drinkable, I really enjoyed this. I thought it would be more mainstream in character, but was surprised to find a strong smooth flavor. I'll get this again."
"Pours a clear copper body, with a thin white head. Aroma is toasty, biscuity, grainy and has a slight trace of hops. This is a light, crisp and refreshing beer. Light bodied and very clean. Some light malt flavours, toastiness, and faint hops. Has plenty of taste for such a light beer. Perfect for a hot summer's day."
"Drinkability  This is a very drinkable beer, and very consistent."
"I'll buy this one again."
"This beer has a lot of character, without being too aggressive- very drinkable."
"The beer poured a red/amber with a very nice, off white 1/2 in. of head that retained pretty well but left very little lacing. I might have been lucky to get a great pour, but this was a beautiful beer. The aroma was malts with some caramel and a hint of fruitiness. The beer's flavor was a sweet malty flavor with some hop flavor coming through as well. I had a physically beautiful pour, but I found the beer itself disapointing slightly - well, mainly because of the build up and expectations based on what customers and coworkers had been saying about it. But it's not a bad beer, not in the least, which is pretty drinkable and pretty prevalent here."
"I have heard many good things about this beer so maybe I will re-review at a later time. But for now I am not impressed at all."
"Nice looking red beer that did not pour much of a head. Appears to be highly carbonated. Nose is of caramel malts-a pleasant smell. Taste is of caramel malts, a hint of nut, with a semi-sweet finish. Mouthfeel is fairly full and this is a nicely carbonated brew. Overall drinkability is good, this is a tasty little beer!"
"There are some really tasty hops in this brew, slightly bitter but just enough to complement the honey and hay flavors. Overall, this is a really good beer that does well in all areas except for smell, which isnt bad, by any means. I was given this one by a friend. Ill buy it myself for sure."
"Opinion: This is a clean and well-crafted beer that I enjoy drinking. I think that this is a better example of an Alt available in the states, but I still really prefer the German examples."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" beige head above the amber brew. Head fades, but laces beautifully. Aroma is sweet malts with a touch of fruitiness. Taste is grain husks, which lasts throughout, winks of fruit here and there, and joined by light hops at the end. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, but limited just a tad by that fruitiness which gets a bit pushy by the end of the bottle. Nice beer overall."
"This one pours a clear amber color with a short head and no lacing. The aroma is filled with malty flavors- sweet caramel and fruit. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and bubbly. It's sweet with a touch of light hops. The flavor and aftertaste are thin. There's nothing here that leaves me wanting more."
"Drinkability- One of the better Amber Ales I have had. Can't believe I waited this long to try it. Good deal."
"Pours a three-finger white head which quickly fades and leaves no lace. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Nice clear, deep amber color. Nose is malty. Starts mellow and sweet, finishes smooth with a touch of hops. Very good Alt. $2.59 for a 12oz bottle from One Stop Oasis Las Vegas, NV."
"I can't say too much about this beer in terms of drinkability. I don't think I'll try another one, but I'm going easy on the rating because of personal preference and I don't have any other alt beer experience to compare it to."
"Taste is very much sweet, of apples, and refreshing. Lightly roasted notes and a sweet, honey aftertaste. Medium, full body. Reminded me of a lesser carbonated Bass, and very much like McEwan's overall. Fairly one-dimensional brew, sweet honey without any involvement of hops. Goes down fast, but I wonder if I'd get irked by the sweetness."
"Overall Impression: A nice clean malt based beer with enough hop characteristics to bring it to balance. Great to hear how history inspired the ale yeast at cool temperatures (it IS Alaska). This is a massively poundable beer; a session beer to last a long winter night."
"A pillow of delicately toasty and caramelish malt seems to be the heart and soul of this brilliant, reddish-copper ale. It's present in the nose, and then again in the flavor... big time! It's very nicely balanced as well, leaving it sweetish and nutty, but not sweet. The emphasis is, however, clearly on the malt, and not the hops. The hops that are present are floral, slightly grassy, and just a touch spicy; but they lay low, giiving only a waft of character to the nose, and an accent of ""spice"" to the flavor. And that is what gives this beer its incredible roundness and balance. It's rich without being cloying, and oh-so-delicately balanced by its restrained hop flavors and bitterness. It finishes almost without notice, leaving just a smear of nutty, toasty and biscuity malt to linger on the palate; and lending greatly to its drinkability by beckoning you to partake again. Quite nice!"
"The taste is a little less sweet than the nose, but one can nevertheless detect a little brown sugar flavour. Bitterness is barely discernible. This is too watery and light for me. It could be a session beer, but wouldn't make for a killer session."
"Overall an easy drinking sesion beer."
"Largely clear, coppery-amber in hue with a slight golden influence, the color is pleasant. The head formed poorly, only a small cap of bubbles topped the liquid and these bubbles fizzled away to an insignificant collar in a moment, before leaving completely. This does nothing but hurt the appearance. There was no subsequent lacing. Honestly the appearance from top to bottom is too average to be noteworthy. The nose said, Alt on the first sniff. I like that. Sweet, grainy malts with a biscuity caramel underscore. In the middle is a lovely array of fruity aromas, peaches and strawberries. The finish offers a soft smattering of earthy, grassy hops. The nose is perfectly articulate, the potency of these aromas is moderate but I understand what it is saying. Inviting. Ive had more dud Alts then good ones. Surprisingly this falls into the latter category. I havent been impressed with Alaskan Brewery (aside from the AK Smoked Porter). I was expecting this offering to be lifeless and limp. It wasnt. Upfront is a blast of malty sweetness with undercurrents of grainy, biscuty qualities and this says nothing of the caramel influences. This maltiness lingers awhile. In the middle is a kiss of astringency and most of the fruity tastes (berries, peaches, and oranges). In the finish, like the nose, are the hops, earthy, grassy with a mild bitterness that does manage to balance the beer nicely. The palate is well crafted, I am impressed, and I find this Alt to be quite tasty. This beer would be great for a crossover beverage; I can see no reason why this beer couldnt supplant Fat Tire as the reigning western amber ale. I guess Alaskan needs to get a catchy name for this beer and find a wider distribution area. Details. Around medium in body, the carbonation level is on the low side of moderate but it feels natural. The mouthfeel is a bit slick but appropriate. Pleasant. This beer is very drinkable. Give me six full bottles and Ill return you six empty bottles... in no time flat! There isnt anything special about this beer but not every beer needs to be mind blowing. Sometimes simple tasty quaffable is all a beer needs to be. I say, well done with this one. I purchased a 12-ounce bottle on-line from Liquid Solutions."
"My first experience with the style, not especially exciting, but it sure is easy drinking. I could put a few away no problem."
"I know the porter is the ale from these guys that everyone raves about, but I figured I'd start with a basic ale. This is not bad, certainly drinkable. smooth and mellow, but not much to distinguish it from others of similar style."
"I've had this in bottled form and ended up enjoying it fairly well and giving it a 3.5 overall. In my opinion, this is better on tap. The malt flavor is more pronounced and a bit nutty. Mouthfeel comes off a bit better as well. More drinkable to me as well."
"first sampled at the twin peaks fan festival and had a boner for it ever since. more than anything, this is a great session beer. for the price, well worth it. not the most complex brew, but certainly containts enough substance to file above macros and in-betweens like sierra nevada and flying dog."
"Alaskan Amber is a decent alt. I don't look to be wowed by this style and wasn't by this beer (self-fulfilling prophecy?). That said, it is a friendly sort and goes down easily enough."
"Pours a standard amber color with a very small head that doesn't stick around and doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The flavor is slightly bready and has a caramel taste, but it also has a tiny bit of lager stank. The mouthfeel is a little too thin, but the drinkability is ok."
"The beer pours a nice golden amber color wtih no real head over top of the beer. The nose is caramel with a touch of biscuit in there, along with characteristic to let me know this is a lager. The flavor is mostly biscuit on the start, with a nice caramel finish. There are no real hops that I can pick out. Its not a bad beer. The feel is thin to moderate, with a bit too much carbonation for me. Drinkability is just okay. The beer is maybe a touch watery, with a bit of a metallic finish. I like it, but not as much as others."
"Medium bodied, nice drinkability."
"In short this makes a great everyday sort of beer."
"I'd certainly pick up a 6er of these once in a while, which would happen as soon as I don't have to take a vacation to Vegas just to get some (missed the legendary Smoked Porter by a week *sniff*)"
"Another gift from the mother-in-law after an Alaskan cruise. The beer is a dark brownish but clear color with a medium and creamy beige head. Thin lacing. The aroma is nicely malted and toasty. Medium-bodied and smooth, with malt, caramel and nut flavors in varying degrees. Light hop finish. Overall not the best Alt available but I was impressed enough that I would get it again."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: A fine medium to light bodied brew. Not my favorite beer style, but this example is drinkable enough."
"Drinkability: nicely drinkable, as I quaffed two with some lunch."
"Undoubtedly a fresh sample, as it was hand carried from the brewery by a colleague. Poured an intriguing ice tea color with lots of very fine bubbles. Head dissipated rather quickly. Nose of light caramel and a distinct nuttiness. Seems fairly well balanced, easy to drink. Nuttiness comes through in the mouth, I am wondering if it should have labled Nut Brown Ale instead. As i resampled this after about 10 minutes in the glass, it body had develped, and the finish pleasantly lengthened. Overall a delightful amber, perfect for those seeking a change from Killians, or Newcastle."
"Overall- not a very pleasant beer. I could drink if that was all there was, but I won't purchase this beer again. Not worth it!"
"This is nice and malty up front, it has a bit of hop flavor in the middle that adds a nice component to this beer. The hop flavor could be a bin more hearty though. The hops really assert themselves in the finish; it is spicy yet mild, and has a hint of minty character to it. The malt flavors are sweet, with notes of caramel and an accompanying lightly toasted note."
"In an instant the head is gone. They've kept it simple, which i like. Mellow malt flavor on a base of almost flavorless hops. Aftertaste is almost bread-like. Feels kinda odd while in the mouth. This brew is undercarbonated for sure. This does not take away from the drinkability. This ought to be a fine session."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thin off-white lace head. The aroma is decent. It has a weak malt scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts and a grainy finish. The taste is slightly above average. It has a light feel with a bit of sweet malts and a dry finish. It is a little weak for my taste, plus the recipe is quite basic. The mouthfeel is average as well. It is a medium bodied beer with not enough carbonation. This beer was a disappointment. It had little character and horrible mouthfeel. It's one and done for me."
"a few of these would be nie, but too many and i would probably tire of the sweetness."
"Drinkability is high; I would enjoy this as a light beer of low cost when others are drinking macro crapola."
"I decided to give this brew another try. The bottle I had before probably was not the freshest sample. Once again the beer had a deep amber body, head retention was poor as was lacing. Caramel malt aroma, some sweetness, and grain. Taste profile was much better than before. Much more malty than hoppy, a bit of a roasted note here and there. Very very smooth. Says it's an Alt beer, tastes more dark lager than ale like. Good mouthfeel and highly drinkable when in the mood for some thing smooth and mellow. This beer is becoming a staple in my fridge. Heck, even my parents loved it!! Had this beer on tap at a local pub and it is much better than the bottle. Bottled version has poor lacing, sometimes none at all. On tap it was sheeting the glass."
"I'm very surprised with this offering. Nice stuff."
"Good drinkability."
"Drinkable? This is ambrosia! This is one of my favorite beers in the world. I last had this in Seattle about 2 years ago, I loved it then and I love it now!"
"It is a dark copper color with a thin head. The aroma is nutty and malty with some caramel notes. The body is slight oily. Caramel maltiness hits uop front and there is also some nuttiness. The finish is dry though it is not as bitter as I would have expected. A bit sweet for an alt, but nonetheless a tasty beer."
"Middling carbonation. Flows creamy across my palate."
"Pours a clear amber-copper color with a small cream colored head. The smell consists of an astringent twang, light bread aroma, faint hops, and not much else. The taste is a repeat of the aromas along with the addition to a little diacetyl, perhaps a little butter on the bread, a medium punch from the hops, and a grainy aftertaste. This is a light bodied beer that finishes with a burned dry note. Fairly drinkable, but there's not alot going on. Cheers!"
"I think this is the best American brewed Alt I've tried."
"Appearance: Forms deep copper amber body with a decent sized cream colored head specks of lacing. Aroma: A sweet mildy hopped tone with a wave of toasted malts with a nutty edge nice brew. Taste: Flavor a warming sweetness with toasted malts and very low IBUs kicking in some balance with bitterness, I must say this is one of the better brewed alts I have tasted. Mouthfeel: Medium to light in body with a creamy edge to the texture nice. Drinkability: Effortless very smooth creamy and tasty with a low abv built to drink in session."
"this came in an odd but attractive tulip like glass (16oz). a dark copper with minimal head (maybe due to the pour). nice lacing. the aromas were light, malty and a hint of fruitiness. once in the mouth it is enjoyable. nothing more nothing less. some nutty malt here, a light toasted character there, but all in all pretty tame. some herbal notes as well. crisp in the mouth and fullbodied, it is very drinkable, theres just better ambers/alts out there."
"It goes down nice and smooth - a very even and balanced sweet maltiness, touch o? hops. It?s kind of like drinking a baby HSA - only it?s a tad lighter in mouthfeel and alcohol. Like, you could just sit and drink the stuff all night long and be perfectly happy doing so. Mmm. Sounds like a plan, to me!"
"Drinkability: Very enjoyable. I had several... although somewhat on the sweet side for a long session."
"I'm two-for-two so far with beers by Alaskan Brewing. Their altbier is highly drinkable and has a pleasing, well-rounded and balanced flavor that I thought really enjoyed. Worth a spot (or six) in my fridge."
"Alaskan Amber I recently drank on tap in Idaho. The apperance of this beer is very dark, almost cherry wood looking with a foamy cream head. The taste is of malts and a hint of fruit. A very exceptional beer to have in a nice restaurant. Feels great in the mouth as the dark malt and fruit taste will bounce around your tastebuds. A very drinkable beer, not to thick and not to light. A great beer."
"Another in a long list of classic brews that I've taken too long to review. Pours a deep mahogany in color, with pleasingly ample carbonation and a thinnish, cream-colored head. The aroma is quite tempting -- toasty, slightly nutty malt with a bit of difficult-to-place fruitiness. Rich and hearty smelling for those cold Alaska nights, days, afternoons, etc. The flavor starts sweet up front, developing a rich, deep, malt body that lingers at the back of the throat. Finishes off with a toasty turn to the malt, and a pleasant but restrained hop bitterness. Very well balanced, though leaning a bit toward the sweet side. Medium-full in body, and damn drinkable."
"Nice malty aroma, slightly sweet. Light bitter hops. Smells like an altbier. Coppery clear with light tan head that dissipates quickly. Medium body with light-med carb - smooth drinking. Muted maltiness up front & a bit of sweetness. Gives way to mild nutty bitter finish and after. Dry and refreshing. A nice beer."
"No head, no carbonation. Sounds flat, but it actually makes the beer very drinkable. Sweet candy malts are the name of the game. Nutty, buttery malts, almost like a brown ale but more toffeeish. There is a light floral hop spike but it is almost unnoticeable. I like it, it makes for a very good session beer. It is actually 5% abv."
"Drinkability  This went down alright, although I dont think Ill buy again. The Widmer Winternacht is a much better brew if youre in the market for a NW Altbier."
"The aroma is the same is the as the taste which is the same as the finish. That in itself is kinda cool, as you know what youre getting. However the lack of complexity is why I find this beer to be average."
"Goes down easy, at home and in Alaska."
"Nothing about this beer was spectacular, but it wasn't a bad beer. It was an amber. I poured it into a pint glass taking note of the clarity of the amber color which retained very little, if any head. But it did retain carbonation, which is more than I can say about some beers I've had in the past (you know who you are). The taste was weak by my standards, but then I'm a porter, ipa man. This would be a good starter beer. Hey Bud drinkers, try this one."
"Thanks to Genaro for bringing me my first Alaskan beer! This Alt pours a deep, dark amber. The off-white head fades rather fast into a very thin coating. The aroma is mostly of sweet caramel, honey and light fruity notes. The malt is creamy and sweet, and just a bit smoky. Again, caramel and honey comes to mind in the flavor department. A light citrus bitterness and mild spicy taste make for a subdued and balanced brew. I could drink quite a few of these babies. The more I drink this sweet Amber the more impressed I become!"
"Overall Impression: I've had this on draft many times and I'm not sure which I like better. The carbonation is at a much better level out of the bottle, so that's a plus (draft can get a bit sweet). Alaskan is a fantastic brewery. I like all of the beers I've tried from them."
"This amber ale pours with a nice deep amber color, however, the head does not stick around very long. The aroma is a blend of fruit fermentation aromas and some roasted malt notes and a bit of hop spiciness. The flavor is also a smooth blend of roasted malt and slight hop bitterness. Overall, this is a very decent amber, but there are better ones out there, especially on the Pacific Coast."
"A rich mahogonay color. A decent malty aroma with a bit of citrus. Flavor is malty without being sweet. A hint of roastiness. Slightly bitter finish. Another fine Northwestern brewery. I have enjoyed this an a few trips to the Seattle area. Even with all the choices out there, it is still a beer I come back to."
"Overall: An above average beer for the style I would say. Worth a try."
"Had a nice, orange-red color capped with a finger of foam. Not a lot of lacing. Moderate mouthfeel. Malty, hoppy smell. The taste was well balanced between malt and hop flavors. Finished nice and crisp. I think this could make a good session beer."
"Medium copper color, large head. Aroma is malty. Medium bodied amber. Complex malt flavor, medium hopped. Malts have a near fruitlike taste (pears and or apricots?) Finish is smooth. Aftertaste is malty, very little bitterness. Complex taste, very smooth. Very drinkable. Nice beer."
"Notes: An average altbier, minus the light astringent character and I would come back to this one."
"A slightly above average beer buit the low alcohol volume would make this a cracking session beer."
"This is a very good drinker. Good color of rich golden orange and light brown highlights. Good smell of malt and a solid fresh tone with some hop presence. Taste is quite good, very smooth, nice malty back. Good medium body feel smooth malty tones all over. Drinkable indeed."
"Pours a medium reddish brown with a decent white head. Toasted malty aroma, sweet malty taste. Nice body, a really good amber. My thanks go out to my Brother and his family who brought me a nice beer package from Alaska this holiday season."
"Excellent pre-dinner beer, if on tap because the bottled version is nothing like the draft. Wonderful aftertaste that I cannot describe. Usually ask at a restaurant if they have it on tap, if not, we usually don't return. (it's that much of a great pre-dinner beer for me). I have found different batches taste different. Alaskan needs to pay attention to their consistency (or maybe that is their plan ?) If you find it on tap before dinner, Enjoy!"
"Cheers!"
"Suffers from its proximity to the amber I had at Glacier Brewhouse the day before. Color is a little thin but not as light at some of the poorer excuses for ambers. Taste is the same, not bad, pretty typical, but not outstanding."
"Balance! This is what the word is about. Nothing overpowering but everything is there. Great malty nose accentuated by the deep amber color. Rocky white head that calms to a sticky white lace. Sweet complex malt notes with caramel and biscuit, and just before malt overload the hops kicks in to a smooth mid-palate. Finish is velvety and full bodied but not cloying. A great accompaniment to a summer grill dinner."
"Much gratitude goes to Mr Bighuge for landing me this treat."
"I must admit in other circumstances this beer may have gotten a better review here.  It was at a football game in Idaho snowy and very cold.  But I was impressed witht he taste and how smooth this beer tasted.  I would recommend trying it, in fact I look forward to trying it again so that I can truly enjoy it...............CHEERS"
"This is probably my favorite ale.  I enjoy the balanced flavors and nothing goes down smoother.  Wish I could get it in MA without the extra shipping."
"One of my favorite beers.  Very nice orange color, lightly hopped and a pretty nice malty taste. Very nice NW US alt beer. Living in the seattle area, it is my default beer of choice at restaurants and bars."
"Pours a deep copper color.  Thin fizzy white head that dissipates quickly.  Clarity is good for an ale.  Aroma is a bit musty.  Taste is clean and mellow.  Hops are evident but my preference for an alt is even hoppier.  There is a smooth, malty taste.  It is evident that this alt has been prepared properly with an extended lagering period.  A very solid alt.  I've only had a couple other alts that I have enjoyed more."
"Outstanding...my kind of beer...very malty and sweet with a slick mouth feel (almost oily or greasy)..minimal hops...light orangish color....I didn't get much head retention,  but you can see the carbonation...doesn't taste charged up though...this is a brilliant beer..truly exceptional....I expected a little more hop bite on the aftertaste but it is fine just the way it is.."
"Notes: Despite it's name, this is an Alt beer and a very nice Alt at that. Outright tasty as hell if you ask me. All the right flavours are present and balance each other very well."
