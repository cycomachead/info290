I drank the hell out of all the Alts I could find when I was going to school in Germany in the late ‘90s, and wish I could find more of the real thing (yeah, I’m glaring at you, Alaskan Amber). Not terribly expensive, and seemingly no worse for wear despite being nearly 5 months past it’s best-by, I might take a chance on this again.","woemad","Aug 01, 2014"

3.72,0,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a clear coppery amber with a thin, persistent light tan head with some lacing. Mellow aroma of caramel malt with light wheat. Fortunately the skunky whiff I got when opening the bottle was not present in the aroma from the glass. Green bottle, why do they do this? Flavor of caramel and bready malt, finishes with light grassy hops and a long hop and malt aftertaste. Starts slightly sweet and finishes slightly dry. Guess I got a bottle of this soon enough that the skunk had not affected taste. All flavors are pleasant, but very low key and unmemorable. Light to medium bodied. Definitely would consider this as a pleasant dinner beer, but would never buy it again if it is in a green bottle. Not worth taking the chance.","LiquidAmber","Sep 12, 2012"

3.71,-0.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"M&D: I tend to agree with the last reviewer (paterlodie) that this beer tastes more like a well-lagered, filtered Altbier than a naturally murky Kellerbier, while Sigmund's comment also hits the bull's eye that the moderate level of hop bitterness seems to well balance the mixed maltiness. The finish is slightly sticky rather than consistently clean, but overall this medium-bodied and lightly fizzy bitter amber beer is definitely a thirst-quencher; if only the brewery used real hops rather than hop extract!","wl0307","Nov 18, 2007"
3.97,6.7,3.5,4,4,4,4,"BB 24-10-06. Nice white head and a brown clear beercolor. Nose is very malty; bit sweetish and with that qyuiet fruity.IMO more like an Altbeer then Pils/Lager( top fermented) and with that also filtered so nowhere near a keller/zwickelbeer. Nice body also and full of taste that's a nice combination of caramel and roastmalt before a well dosed bitterness comes in and takes over. Good sweetness in it too as there is some but not to much and fitting the well dosed other components. Well balanced and enjoyable brew if you like altbeer.","paterlodie","Jul 24, 2006"
3.53,-5.1,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"500 ml heavy dark green swingtop bottle, cool. Bought in Bier Spezi, Hamburg. Amber colour, large to moderate off-white head. Lovely hoppy aroma when pouring, not equally impressive in the glass. For something from Germany called ""Bitterbier"" I kind of expected a hoppy explosion, but the bitterness is actually very moderate. Still, some hops are around, and they are quite well balanced with the malts. Hints of caramel and a certain herbal spiciness too. Unusual style for Germany, but not really remarkable.","Sigmund","Nov 14, 2005"
