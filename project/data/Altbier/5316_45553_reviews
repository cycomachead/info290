"Edit: had to run an errand and came back to this beer considerably warmer. I can now taste the Munich malt (might be caramunich) and it improved incredibly. Tastes grainy malty. Improved considerably."

"Overall a very tasty authentic to German tasting Altbier. A home run for the price as well."

"Brewer's Share: Phil's Existential Alt"
"O: Overall, a decent beer, I think the aging of this particular one may not have been a good thing for it, but either way, still worth a try."
""

"The beer starts out with promise, including the taste, but it soon loses much of its appeal. Overall, the malt flavors seem weaker with each mouthful and the body comes across more watery. One is left with a slightly over-bitter ale flavor. I hoped for better, and it's drinkable, but falls flat in the long run."
""

"My pour created two fingers of dense, foamy, light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a lightly molasses-like sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium with a molasses-like flavor on the tongue. Definitely not malty, but not bitter, either. It landed somewhere in the middle ground of the two flavors. Finish definitely had the grassiness of ""German Noble hops", which I read as Hallertau. Once more, I was glad that Full Sail has come to PA."

"22oz bottle best before 08 2013. Pours a beautiful deep red color in pint glass with a rapidly falling head. I can't detect any aroma at all. Flavor is pretty neutral as well, with a delicate graininess of raw barley. Very balanced, but not very flavorful. According to BA's notes this was brewed once in 2012. Maybe this bottle is just too old (though it's an alt, so aging ought to be permitted). Since it's before the best buy date I consider it fair game to review. Drinkable but unimpressive."
"It's very good beer."

"Price Point - $4.75/22 oz. bottle"
" This is a very amenable beer with a forthcoming and friendly malt character together with a stately hop bitter."
""
"Pours a crystal-clear dark amber with a thinnish head. Some caramel in the nose with herbal noble hops being the strongest aroma here. Flavor is CLEAN: something that a lot of US brewers fail to do with alts. Nice caramel, biscuit malts with a little toast (I'd hope for a little less toast still). Nice herbal, grassy noble hop flavors with a sturdy bitterness and dryness in the end. Mouthfeel has some prickly carbonation. Not too sticky nor slick nor heavy. Overall, this isn't the best altbier I've had, but it's one of the very few and rare examples of a US microbrewery actually making an alt instead of labeling a messy, estery, toasty mess an ""altbier."" Seriously, I'm tired of US breweries making generic dark amber ales and calling them altbier."

"Pours a hazy dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, caramel, and grassy hop aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but there is a somewhat harsh hop bitterness in the flavor."
""
"I haven't tasted many, but this is the best altbier I've had."

""
"Overall, a great, sessionable brew. Malt character is complex enough to be interesting. Expected a little more floral flavor from the hops, and perhaps not so much citrus."
"D - Very drinkable. Nice Altbier with good yeast character and smoothness."
"From the 22 oz bottle bought at Pinkie's in San Angelo, Texas. The ""enjoy by"" date is missing."

"This tastes like a really great blend of Germany and America – a beer that is mainy German, stylistically, but brewed with a little bit more hoppiness on account of it being brewed by a brewery from the hop crazy Pacific Northwest. I hope to see this one brewed again, for although the age didn’t seem to harm this beer, I’d still like to try a fresh one."
"A nice dark copper color For altbier. The scent is both of carmeal and malts. Taste has a toasted character to it and mostly malt, somewhat nutty? . I found a bit of a hop taste. its light and easy to drink. Not a bad choice for 3.99"
""

"I'm glad I picked up a bottle of this. Strong throughout and enjoyable to sip on. Good bargain, too."
"22 oz bomber from ""Lifesource"" Salem. $4.79 Nice deep amber/brown body with a slight haze,and a thick creamy quarter inch eggshell white head atop. Malty,bready,nutty slightly toasted aromas. All of the above inn the taste..plus a semi bitter after taste that works well. Nice rounded mouthfeel . Good drinkable beer"
""
"Overall OK, not bad, but not great."
""
"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a tan head. The aroma is full of toffee malt, with a hint of grass and some earth thrown in. The flavor similar. I get a lot of toffee notes, as well as some grass and ice-tea character. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I am not a huge fan of altbiers, but this one was pretty good."
""
""
"Overall: A solid, well-built alt."
"This beer is has a easy drinking quality with some good tastes going on, I prefer more hops but I'm not everyone, if you like malty beers and Oktoberfest style beers, you like this stuff."
"Taste follows the nose, sweet upfront, touch of tart in the middle, with a sedate bitterness to the close. Mouthfeel is soft over the tongue, and drinkability is easy. Nice representation of the style."
""
"O: A solid Alt and worth the relatively low price tag. Easy-drinking and great for a weeknight."
""
"O: A very traditional alt! very nice example of the original style!"
""
"Taste is nice and smooth with some rich malty flavor...toast and maybe a light molasses sweetness. The hops are just about perfect and add a nice flavor and bittering balance. This is actually the second bottle of this I have bought. Good price point for a bomber and I think it is a damn fine altbier. The nutty yeast makes more of an impact as it warms and the mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. However, there is enough going on to make this a nice, sessionable brew to share or drink alone. Versatile...thats the word Im looking for!"

"Very well done amber beer from Full Sail's quite decent IPO line."

""
"O: A bit too sweet, but that's pretty common with the type...Overall, good but not one I'd going looking for again anytime soon...Chasin' Cheers :~)"
"M: Light to medium."
"Offers a full feel yet with a light carbonation. Malt forward and reasonably complex with a touch of smoke even. Overall quite solid/complex/malty/interesting."
"Pretty decent brew. Stylistically competent, without being overwhelming or virtuosic."
"Overall a very pleasant beer. Good for a session, or a thirst quencher for a warm day."
"Appearance has a dirty brown color supporting thin head and nil lace. Aroma has a clean sense of sweet malt and hop. Taste is grainy having a dark fruit note with the lightly sweet malt fallowed by the noble hops. Mouthfeel is medium with good carbonation. Nothing complex, just a good brew that seems to fallow the style fairly well."

"Decent, but I guess not what I expect from an alt."

"Overall: a pretty decent altbier, though I think I would prefer it a bit less biscuity."
""
"O: No big flavors, but very enjoyable. Nice price, too. Might pick it up again."

"I can't say I'm an experienced alt drinker, but this was a welcome introduction to the style. Dark amber color with a consistent thin head. Smooth lager mouthfeel, with a substantial flavor of toasted malt, well balanced against modest hop bitterness. The flavor carried a stronger punch than I expected, but in the best of ways. It's still a very smooth, drinkable brew with a 5% abv that won't make you worry about getting drunk after a bomber."
""
"Dark copper color. Sweet malty aroma. The Taste is a very good, complex maltiness with a great balance of spicy hops. The carbonation is moderate and goes down smooth. It all comes together very well. A very good beer by Full Sail in a less popular style. Would recommend it to anyone who likes a full flavor beer, or just wants to know what the 'alt' style is all about."
""
"D; nicely drinkable, especially @ the price."
"- This is a robust and full flavored brew. It packs a lot for a 5.1% abv. Alt. I like it, and it seems to mostly hit the style markers for me. It has a nice hoppy finish without the aroma craziness. Good bitterness, clean water, and a nice malt bill with that Signature yeast flavor. Solid beer, and worth the try. Bet it would be a real treat on cask at the pub."
"An eccentric brew to say the least... I'm not sure if I would prefer it again. But it had a massive amount diligence in its aroma and complimentary taste you can't just get from any 5% beer."
"Poured into a stange. Pours a medium to dark reddish amber with a thin off-white head with good retention and nice lacing. Aromatic aroma of slightly toasty caramel malt and a hint of wheat and hops. Medium bodied. Flavor dominated by bisquit malt and very toasty with a dry, pleasant moderate hop finish. I liked the toasiness in the middle on this one, a pleasant altbier."

"There must be a good story behind the name, but I've yet to hear of it."
