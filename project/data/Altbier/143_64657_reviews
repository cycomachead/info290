"Aroma: interesting marriage of roasted malts and flowering yeasts; almost perfumy esters are released at the pour... Appearance: thin off-white head that sits on a burnt orange body; tracings are negligable.... Palate: edium-bodieed; a bit crunchy as an ale would present, but also finishes at the throat... Taste: more hops than malts, but the malts show up late--not a big-tasting ale at all... Overall: Alts are always an odd tweener--thee hybrid linebacker of the beer world--and this one is representative, with an Oktoberfest/Munchen flavor and a freshness that throws some ale weight into it...."

"Pours to a thick buff head and clear copper color. Aroma presents a sweet, spicy hop nose with Munich malt and hint of English toffee (or seems like it). Flavor is perfectly balanced with hop bitterness, malt sweetness, noble hop flavors, warm, toasty, biscuity finish. Medium co2 and light mouthfeel that feels a bit sugary. Overall, very good selection from TX."

"MF- Moderate body with very little carbonation."

"O - This is a nice altbier. Nicely done my Shiner. They consistently put out good lagers."
"Despite being labeled as a ""Limited Edition Brewer's Pride Craft Brew," the Texans at Shiner once again show that they are incapable of successfully emulating traditional german beers on a budget. Although to their credit, Old-time alt is a much better attempt than their Bock. However, in the end too many adjuncts to cut costs come through and keep this to being an acceptable, not good brew."
""

"Overall - easy to drink, crisp and sessionable. Nothing noteworthy"
"A light copper color with an off-white head. Some malt notes to it, somewhat bready. There’s a little fruity sweetness and maybe some chocolate. Not bad, actually. The flavor is heavy on the bread and toffee sweetness with a little bit of toasted malt. Hints of chocolate malt with some mild fruit notes to it as well. Medium body and carbonation."
""
""
"By far, this was the clear winner from the variety six pack."
"O - Delicious! My favorite from Shiner so far. At only $7 for the family reunion six-pack it's a steal to boot. I would love to drink more of this beer, a great one."
"This one was a pleasant surprise, didn't expect to taste as good as it did, especially after the weakish smell."
""
"A fair but undistinguished beer. Maybe a hop presence and a bit more malt character would help with this one."
"O: A good Alt, easily drinkable, well balanced. Overall, a good beer."
""
"OVERALL: C-"
""
""
"Overall nothing I would actually seek out again but not very off putting to not enjoy my last couple. Pretty decent altbier."
""
""
""
"This beer really surprised me. I wasn't expecting much from Spoetzl after trying their Shiner Bock. Shiner Bock is their signatures brew, but I guess you shouldn't base your assumptions of their others brews off of it. Their Hefeweizen really surprised me as well."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer. I am very pleased that Shiner has come out with this and if offered in six packs I would definitely buy."
""
"D - This beer has actually given me some hope for the brewery. It's nothing special, but it's an easy drinking beer I'd have again."
""
"O. Interesting beer. Smell promises some hops, but flavor does not live up to anything very malty or hoppy. Really kind of strange herbal flavor."
"a two finger off white head sits atop a clear copper colored body. the head slowly fades to a spotty cap leaving some nice lacing behind. smells of caramel malts, bread and biscuits, a little sweetfruit and some floral hops. taste is a nice bready malt with some hops to blend and balance. mouthfeel has a medium body feel with decent carbonation and a slight dry finish. overall this is my favorite from these guys, i knew they could do it!"

"Kind of an interesting Alt, almost ""refreshing", in a sense. This one's pretty good from this brewery considering the rest of their lineup. I'd probably choose a different altbier though if I had the choice."

"12 oz bottle. Pours copper hue with a short lived, thick, off-white head. Aroma is of caramel malt, floral hops and ripe fruit. Medium, tangy body. Earthy hops, and caramel malt balanced on the palate. Long, bitter, dry finish. The best Shiner brew IMO."
"O: This is probably my favorite offering from Spoetzl to date. Everything fits just right with this one."
"Atmosphere is good. Dark amber hue, a really nice foamy head, and lots of lacing. Nose is a very full nutty, baked bread combination with lots o' molasses. Flavor is bitter rye bread, and fresh tea leaves. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"Overall, the taste lets me down just enough to qualify this as a regular drinker. It's certainly a matter of opinion, and this alt-bier is certainly worth a try."
"All in all - decent. A little too heavy for my liking, and I think the bitterness comes across a little harsh. This is chewy, yet not sweet so the bitterness cuts right through."
"Lively, easy drinking thinner bodied brew. Maybe a tad watery, but comparable to the others I've had in the style."
"I continue to be suprised by the brews from this brewery. They are simple yet have some great aspects that help them shine. This brew was excellent, only improvement would be the aroma, which neededs just a bit more to help close it out. Everything else makes this a great session beer for the warmer months."
"The taste was somewhat faint as well. It tasted like it smelled: like fruity hops, but very light in flavour. It was high in carbonation and light in body. Lighter than I was expecting this style of beer to be, anyway. I did not really enjoy it as a result."
"It's a beer with a nice balance and easy enough to drink."
"Dr. A decent beer; I would not object to another."
"O - overall, a very nice beer. This is my first foray into the altbier style, and if the rest can measure up to this guy, I'll be back for more."
"Overall this was a basic Altbier. It had all the notes that I was expecting. As usual, it was a very drinkable beer with a freshness that is characteristic to all Shiner offerings."
"o: a very well balanced brew.. hop & malt bill make for a good session brew."
"Overall Impression- My second favorite from Shiner (Spoetzel) so far! Great! Has a nice clean and easy drinking taste but then has a good amount of character to it! Roastiness and caramel flavors come out big time at the finish of each drink. Recommend this one too!"
"O: Overall a well balanced brew.... Sweet malt and hops come out pretty even and make for a pretty complex beer with a low ABV, so you could drink a few of these... not a bad session beer.. to bad it only comes as a single in the Shiner Family pack."
"First review!"
"Great Alt beer from Shiner! Cheers!"
"Overall, it's not a bad beer, but it's nothing to write home about. To be honest, it's not a favorite style for me, and I think I actually preferred 512's Alt over this one."
"I got a finger-and-a-half of rocky, light-tan head with good retention from my pour. Color was a deep-copper with NE-quality clarity. BUPGOO! Nose was very biscuit malty with hints of dark fruit. Mouthfeel was very full, creamy and smooth. The initial taste was of fresh bread, followed by a molasses tartness and then a gentle grassy hoppiness. This was as pleasant a drink as I have had in a while and I could easily see why they would take pride in it. Finish was semi-dry with an emphasis on the biscuit malt interacting with the grassy hops. More, please!"
"Overall this is a bit mild, as expected, but even more bland than I expected. I drank it down. Pass, next, much better around to offer esepcially in this category. Spend the extra few bucks for some quality."
"Overall Impression: I found this be be very drinkable, even in this summer heat. However, I think I would enjoy this a whole lot more in the fall, as I really enjoyed the bready and caramel malt flavors. This one only comes a single beer at a time in the Shiner mixed six pack, so put this one in the fridge and save it for a nice October evening."
"O-no matter what the score reveals, i enjoyed this beer. it was quite different and enjoyable. i'm sure there are better alts out there but this is a fair example. i wouldn't mind having more."
"Rather weak flavor profile and a little thin. Nothing really stands out here."
"This might qualify as a slightly hoppy British style, but I'm not buying the 'alt', and I'm not sold on it on the whole. Not bad, but not good either."
"A nice brew, I like the beer, but not the best alt, and not the best by Spoetzl."
"Toasty, wet grain is bold and lends a burnt quality to it. Somewhat like a cross between an Anchor Steam Beer and a bock. Earthy and some sulfurous lager flavors as it warms. I am not sure I would want to drink alot of this, but it was a fun brew to drink and makes you think a bit, lots of subtle complexities here."
"O: This was the first beer I have had from Shiner where I took a sip, shifted eyes, took another sip, put the beer down and simply said, ""There it is"". A great beer."
"It's a solid offering, and a solid beer coming out of a brewery that produces a lot of fairly mainstream products. They've been trying to produce some more interesting and flavorful beers recently and this one certainly fits the bill. Prosit!"
"I hope this becomes a regular offering from Shiner. I would buy this all the time."
"Nice to finally see something from Shiner on the shelf that's not the Bock. This pours a copper to amber color with plenty of carbonation and ample white head. Good head retention. Aroma is nice and malty with lots of caramel sweetness. Hops are well-hidden. A very drinkable beer - smooth, toasted malts; sweet but with a nice touch of bitterness. A solid, well-balanced beer. Shiner should sell this one in its own six pack."
"Poured into a becker a deep bronze color with a very well defined sticky one finger white head,just a nice pour.Toast and caramel in the nose,its a bit warming in its toast.Again toasty with caramel/biscuit malt flavors,the hops are subdued lending a light smack of herb in the finish.A solid alt beer,it might be a little light in the hops but the warm toastiness makes up for it."
"Clear reddish-orange, with a decent head that stuck around for a bit then left some nice lacing and a thin frothy layer as it dissipated. Bit of toffee on the nose along with a faint hop aroma. More of the same on the palate, this beer has pretty distinct front, mid and finish, with nice hop bitterness bringing up the rear. The carbonation is nice and creamy, I really like the mouthfeel. A beer that goes down easy, but has enough going on to keep you interested even after having a couple. Also, this is the first Alt I have had in a really long time, and right now I am wondering why that is..."

"O - Very good Altbier that is accessible to all. Will be coming back even though Alt is not my favorite style."
"Picked this one up in a mixer sixer from Shiner. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is clear medium golden color which looks similar to apple juice and an off-white soapy head. The nose is a mix of fruity malt and citrus notes. The taste is similar with sweet fruity maltiness intertwined with a citrusy hop presence; there is also an off putting bitter, buttery finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full in body with a creamy, inactive carbonation. Overall, not really impressive or remarkable, won't be searching this out in the future but wouldn't turn it down if someone gave it to me."
"This is a nice Alt overall. Shiner has done a good job with this one."
"Pours a copper color with a thin head. Smells slightly sweet and fruity with some orchard fruits, a light yeastiness, and even a touch of banana. The taste is also quite fruity, but there is some graininess to balance and a bit of herbal hops as well. More of that banana in the finish. This is actually fairly tasty. It doesn't have the bite that you usually find in an alt, and it isn't quite as dry either, but it's still relatively crisp and the fruitiness is quite pleasant. I enjoyed it."
"From the mixed six and it's a decent beer. Nothing spectacular but ok."
"O: Smell and appearance are very good, but the bitterness and carbonation are over done."
"Overall: The best brew in the Shiner mixed 6 pack. Thoroughly enjoyable, too bad they don't make it available on its own."
"O: Again, this isn't a complex beer but it's a good selection. Straightforward malt and hop combo"
"Drinkability is refreshing with some nice but simple character."
"Overall a good beer that I wouldn’t get sick of. I could drink a bunch of these if available."
"D: Hard for me to drink - the herbal taste/smell is almost medicinal and I felt it was overcarbed too. Despite being very thin and low ABV I didn't find it particularly drinkable."
"Overall-First beer out of the mixed 6 and impressed. Very nice beer that is sessionable and highly drinkable."
"D/O - Drinkability is pretty easy, and its a decent Altbier. It's worry a revisit while it's around, but I likely won't."
"Nicely balanced and very easy-drinking and refreshing. One of Shiner's better offerings!"
"It has a kind of dark malty taste. Not much hops in either the taste or nose. I suppose it's right for the style, but the style has never been one of my favorites. I will try to avoid."
"This isn't a horrible beer, but my first batch homebrewed alt I made back in 94 was as good as or better than this. This is a light hearted attempt at the style at best"
"Overall: A bit mild, as expected, but pretty decent. I drank it down. No, really, I did!"
"O: Pleasantly surprised at the quality of this brew; was only disappointed in the lack of aroma. It would make a great six pack for the summer or spring. Nothing challenging here, but a great session beer."
"First ever beer from Shiner, I've always heard about it but never got the chance to give them a whirl. Interesting to see a pretty rare in the alt, but I definitely enjoy Otter Creek and Long Trail's versions. Pours a good looking light brown color, some great caramel notes on the tongue, nice solid mouthfeel, medium bodied. Nice and crisp and drinkable with a nice spiciness to it, really liked this one. Not too bad for only $11.99 for a mixed 12 pack.. psyched to try the rest!"
"Bubbly, patchy lacing has a nearly epic quality to it, and with a stunning, clear amber color, this brew ends up being a looker. Hints of caramel, taffy and spicy hops in the aroma. Oily hop feel and flavor; the solid medium body heavily brushes the palate with a smoothness. Bready maltiness flexes a bit; faintness of caramel and biscuit. Balance from the hops is sufficient, but the flavor just adds a greater quality to this brew. Clean, drinkable and interesting at that, as our palates continue to tell us that we would be able to quaff this beer all night long."
"Poured into a Brit pint glass. One finger creamy off-white head that settles into a 1/2 finger cap that retains throughout drinking. Color is a deep copper-gold, clear with carbonation bubbles sprinkled throughout. Looks really nice. Aroma is a refreshing light pine-grapefruit atop slightly sour grass. The taste leaves me somewhat perplexed. It's refreshing and drinkable but what are the flavors? Initial spicy earthy hops quickly fades to mild citrus hops, mild earth hops, mild bready malt, not much sweetness, and pretty dry. Finishes with a long drying earthy-nutskin- popsicle stick fade."
"This one isn't bad. Drinks very easy, as it should. Good beer to sit and drink over."
"I really enjoyed this beer, Shiner is stepping their game up for sure."
"Notes: Decent beer and representation of the style. Refreshing and nice to drink, but it is nothing that really excites me or entices me to drink more. Aroma is seriously lacking though. I'd have no problem drinking some more if given to me, but I probably won't seek it out."
"D - Very nicely balanced ale from Shiner. Light and easy drinker. Although it has its own taste, you can still tell that this is a Shiner product. I would love to see this as a six pack for the summertime."
"Drinkability: A solid beer overall and worth a try, though not spectacular. I'd have this again, but I can't say I'd go out of my way to drink it."
"I'm not familiar with this style beer, so I have no idea if alt biers typically are this sweet. All I know is that this beer is not really for me. I mean, it was good enough for one, but I'm not going to be rushing out to by another."
"Pours a transparent amber-red with a 1 finger head and nice lacing on the glass. Smells slightly metallic with a sweetness presented by the malt. Tastes more complex than the other Spoetzl brews-I perceived it as a brilliant upfront hoppy kick with sweetness settling in afterward-kind of opposite of most beers. Overall quite a delicious beer overall but could use a bit more malt backbone and more hops to really fill it out."
"Another new beer from Shiner that is decent, but nothing really worth seeking out. Still, it is a lot better than a lot of the other year-round beers made by Spoetzel."
"Welll. Poured with a nice fine, foamy, off white head that lasts and good lace. Color is a lovely garnet amber. Aroma was weird: skunk and funk. Flavor was totally different: more bitter than sweet, earthy. Like the commercial description. Body is a tad on the thin side. Carbonation is good. Finish is like flavor and rather long."
"12 ounce bottle, one of the 6 beers in Shiner's Family Reunion 6-pack. Served in a Stange/Altbier glass, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with an inch and a half off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is mostly toasted malt, along with some caramel and hops. The aroma is nice, but it's also weak. The brew tastes just like the aroma (but stronger), it's mostly toasted malt but also some caramel and hops are noticable. There's a nice lingering bitter grassy hop finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit slick and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it sure goes down easy enough. I thought this brew was a pleasant surprise, I liked it."
"D - Quite drinkable, this isn't the best Alt out there, but it is a reasonable interpretation of the style. The aroma is a bit subdued with little to enjoy, but the flavor is very nice with lots of toast and some caramel to keep things interesting."
