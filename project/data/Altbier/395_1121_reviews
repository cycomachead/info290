"Hazy amber/brownish color with a tan head that gives way to decent lacing.  Both the smell and tastes are a good combination of malt and floral hops.  Very refreshing.  The finish is neither dry nor sweet.  The mouthfeel is good as is the carbonation level.  Overall this is a great beer to have with hot wings (which I did) and with the lower ABV it is an excellent session beer."

"O- A very drinkable amber ale that was refreshing and paired well with my food at the brewpub"

"amber in color with copious amounts of carbonation bubbling up toward the surface throughout. Nice white head on top, maybe an inch and a half before settling down to coat the inside of the glass for a minute. Interesting aroma, mix of grains, light bready malts, and a touch of a grassy, herbal hoppiness. Nothing crazy here but nicely balanced. Same could be said for the flavor, nice pale taste, light bready notes balancing a herbal sort of hop. Lightly sweet with a decent amount of carbonation"
"O: I'm glad I tried it, but I didn't really dig this one."
"O: Pretty boring, though this style's not exactly a stunner to begin with."
"This is a nice refreshing beer. From the nose I expected to be blasted in the body, but the flavors are nice and clean. If this were available in Pennsylvania I would probably pick up more. And at around 4% this is one I could drink all night."
"Poured clear brown color with an average fizzy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Moderate roasted malt and tart citrus aroma. Medium body with a sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where met."
"Overall, a very good alt or amber ale. It more balanced than the American pale ale from this brewery. I noticed the brewery packages this now as an ""amber"" ale instead of an ""alt"" like had for several years."
"Pours a hazy copper color, nearly amber, with a loose head, which dissipates rather quickly, leaving just a little ring. There's a little lacing, but not much. Looks about average I'd say. The smell is primarily of maltiness - very sticky and sweet - munich malt I'd guess, but fairly dry in the smell. Nice minty hop presence, kind of slight, but still there behind the sweet caramel smells, with maybe a touch of chocolate. I don't know if I just love the noble hops on top of the sticky malt body, but this one tastes great. A nice malty backbone - caramel, butterscotch almost, nice and bready, a bit toasty. And then a beautiful minty hop presence that sticks to you and kind of washes down with a hint of lime. Low bitterness, almost no esters. This one is nicely balanced, malty, hoppy - but not American hoppy. There are both subtleties and very obvious tastes here, that are all pleasant. There's a kind of sharp bite of carbonation, maybe a bit much, accentuated by the hops. Nice body, not huge, kind of walks the line between thin and full. Maybe a tad on the thin side of medium. A good drink. Nice flavors, not too high on the ABV. Overall, a bit challenging, interesting, simple and enjoyable in varying degrees and phases. This would probably be my choice if I returned."
"Copper color with a a white foam head and active but small bubbles of prickle. Some wheat in the nose that blends with the malts in the way that hops usually does. This is an interesting way of creating balance. Malty flavor with a smooth attack and clean finish. Simple, but fair beer. This beer reminds me more of German food than German beer."
"Overall a very drinkable beer, went very well with my Angus burger."
"Notes from 02/19/08."
"I wouldn't recommend this, and in fact I resent the Microbrew of the Month people a bit for sending it to me."
"Nothing that special here, but it's a really good drinking beer. Simple, clean flavors, perfect for session drinking."
"Not bad or undrinkable, not something I'd seek out again."
"Solid amber ale brewed in the old style. Pours a good looking light amber color with an ample head. Decent aroma of sweet malts countered by a bit of dry rye. Smooth and easy, very drinkable. Good flavors of sweet and toasted malts with a faint noble hop bitterness. A nice ale that could get you through the night."
"M/D - Medium bodied but a little flat. A decent beer, but nothing great."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Medium body with appropriate carbonation for the style. Lower levels of carbonation allow this beer's malt character to shine, in my opinion without giving it a soda type of feel. Carbonation is fine and lightly dances in minute small groupings of bubbles on the tongue. This is an easy beer to drink, goes great with a medieval themed novel or movie-makes you feel even more involved in what you are watching/reading. This is one I recommend...a great offering from a local brewery. I'd like to explore this style more before coming back to it though."
"Drinkability is nice. A smooth beer, but not incredibly exciting. I would not say this beer was bad, but there was nothing about it that excited me."
"Pours an clear amber with a nice head. Good looking beer. Displays a distinctive herbal aroma. The flavor is light, malty, though strangely lacking in hop character. The moutfeel is nice, viscous with a good sting of carbonation. I wish this beer was more exciting, but it is not bad for an alt."
"D: Easy enough to drink but a little disappointing -- I really like this style, but it is not readily available."
"Though not a beer that will blow your mind, the light and balanced flavors make this a nice session beer."
"D - A very nice beer, I must have been served the bitter by mistake at the brewpub. None of the fruitiness and a very nice malty flavor w/ bready touches and a dry texture that makes it easy to return to. I consider this a fine Alt and it is highly quaffable."
"Tasted 3/3/08."
"The taste is decent: bran, cereal malts with a pinch of wheat and organic grain. It does a decent job of emulating the German altbier style. Mouthfeel is overcarbonated and packs a lasting bitterness that does little to complement the flavor. Overall, there's not much in the way of excitement for this beer. I'd have to say ""Pass"" if I ever came across it again."
"A medium copper color, with a quater inch white head, that slowly dissolves away. The scent of malt strikes the nose at first, followed by a light grassy fragrance, then a citrusy lemon scent at the end. The taste is strong and malty, with growing mild bitterness coming in halfway. There is a metallic taste at the end, but only lingers there for a short amount of time. The feel is a little chewy at the front, it then blend to a very consistant medium bodied feel. There is a tingle from carbonation, but nothing to put one off. This beer could be very good session beer selection, very solid in flavor and aroma. When I am at the BBC brewpub, this is a good go to beer."
"Pours a nice amber color with a bit of head and almost no lacing. Nice scent, a bit malty with a little floral, but not very strong. Nice taste, too, a good malty beer (I got honey overtones, but that may be the smoothness). It is one of the smoothest beers I've ever had. Very good, very tasty. I would drink more, and will hopefully be able to try it in May when I'm in Louisville."
"Really loved this on tap, and brought home a bottle to compare. The lack of freshness was striking and really took this beer down a notch. While the adherence to the dry, toasty altbier style was excellent, there was less crispness, less life, the taste was a touch stale. Certainly well within the best by date, BBC does better by this style with a fresh pour. There is also the issue of the fluorescently lit fridge, despite the brown bottle, which may have prematurely aged this sample. See my other reviews of BBC beers...this bottle was the least flawed so far."
"Final Thought: I like it, a solid showing from BBC... I just wish more American brewers experimented and produced the Altbier style, because it is an interesting concoction."
"I dont want to have this beer again. It is not overly offputting, but it is still hard to finish. It doesnt seem to be a very well constructed beer; not much flavor and slightly muddled."
"Drinkability: if you want a true altbier, you'll need to look elsewhere. This is a light version of one which some may enjoy. Very easy to drink but little flavor makes it dull."
"Much of what I expect from an Altbier is really ramped up in this one. It looks a brilliantly clear copper and golden and pours an over-carbonated white loose head that faded, but laced well. Smells malty, toasty and caramelly. Alcoholic phenols penetrate the nose. Tastes slightly roasty and malty. Nice frutiness like ripe pears and, to a lesser extent, peaches. Spices float in the background: nutmeg and corriander. American hops add to the spice and to the flavor. Sweet alcohol chases you through the body and into the finish. The finish is clean, crisp, and dry. A bit mouth coating: like butter? This is a bold Alt. What do yo expect from an American Micro? A whimpy beer? Not here!"
"Pours a translucent copper color with a nice off-white head. Decent lacing and retention. Smells of caramel, pine and a creamy coffee. Upon tasting, nothing much stood out. It has some soapy malt taste, some non-descript flavors in the middle, and a mild bitter finish. I can't place much of anything. It's not bad, really, but it's nothing real remarkable. It's fine in the mouth, too - maybe a little watery. Goes down easily, for the most part, but nothing is drawing me back to it. So, two thumbs in the middle!"
"Got a mixed six-pack of BBC beers from my brother for Christmas. The Altbier says it's best by April 2007. Pours a slightly hazy golden color, with a very small white head. Little to no retention on it. Smells like a classic Pilsner... bread, simple grains, touch of hops, wood, a little musty. Tastes very crisp, with a nice malty aftertaste. A touch of hoppy bitterness. A little chemically in the middle. Overall, could be a little stronger. Mouthfeel has some nice fizz on the front of the tongue, a tad watery in the back. Overall, a very easy beer to drink, nice example of the style."
"Poured into a weizen glass! at the Cincinnati airport. The beer put up a two-finger light tan head that fell slowly to surface lace. The body had a translucent golden-amber appearance. The nose was spicy, with herbal hops and slightly sweet toasted caramel malt. The taste was toasted, a bit metallic, but not estery - this beer was very lager-like, and reminded me of Brooklyn's O-Fest. It had a sweet finish, and little bitterness. The mouth was medium, and there was a lot of tingly carbonation. An easy beer, with nice body."
"Drinkability: Pretty easy drinking, which translates to not a lot of complex or strong flavors. A good session beer, but nothing outstanding."
"The beer poured a dark bronze with only a half finger of head. The aroma had something wrong with it that I could not put my finger on. Kind of a ""corn water"" smell, like when boiling corn-on-the-cob. The aroma was not present in the flavor however. The flavor was mainly malty, with a little caramel. Not much hops. Mouthfeel was good. It's a silky, creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonation. All in all it was a disapointment."
"Drinkability: Wow it's good. I had some Spaten last night and I must say I think I like this better (ducks). I could definitely drink a shit ton of this and not get tired of it. It seems to be fitting with any occasion too. I was quite surprised by this one."
"Drinks really easy. a good american take on a style that I loved over in Germany. Easily the best of the BBC beer I tried"
"This beer is a very easy drinker and one I wish I could get my hands on down here in the hot state of Texas. This would be my summer beer of choice on scorcher days."
"Easy drinking and pretty refreshing."
"Pours a very clear amber color, with some orange highlights. Maybe a half inch thick head, that fades quickly. No lacing left behind. Very weak aromas, of some dark malts, dark dried fruits, with some hints of molasses and a smokey aroma to it. Some flavors of dark malts, fruits and finishes clean. A little watery mouthfeel, but very light. Quite refreshing. Very easy to drink, I just wish this beer had a stronger taste."
"Overall: Will not try again. I travel for business and always look for new beers. This is my favorite style and was diapointing."
"Drinkable with a nice taste, but the thin body is a little too annoying to make me desire another."
"That said, it smells wonderful. Spice and chocolate dance on my nose. If only the taste were more pronounced, this would be one killer beer."
"Fresh 12 oz bottle pours a clear, bronze body topped by two fingers of creamy offwhite head. Retention is fair, and some patchy chains of lace are left on the glass as it quickly empties. Aroma begins with spicy hops, as caramel and toffee notes quickly emerge. The nose is finished by a fruity note of dried apricots. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a silky and tingly carbonation level that is ideal. Taste is quite good, with mild black peppery hops, toffee maltiness, and a hint of ripe pears. Slightly drying noble hops appear toward the finish. Easy drinking, well balanced, and a decent American effort at a somewhat obscure German style. Definitely worth a try."
"D: Very drinkable.Goes down easy."
"Overall: Not a superb alt, but a pretty nice one. Worth trying if you want some local Kentucky flavor."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable"
"Mouthfeel is fantastic, the carbonation is perfect and goes down real smooth."
"Pours a medium bright amber color with a short and foamy light tan head. Nose is toasted malt blended with notes of hay and grassy hops. Taste begins with a light fruitiness and a bit of toffee followed by notes of dry and bready grains. Grassy hops with a mildly spicy bite finish out the tasting. Clean, crisp, and easy-drinking. Thanks to yakko for the sample!"
"Poured a clear amber colour into the glass with a slight tan head. Aroma is light but with some faint frutiness (perhaps apricot). Flavour starts with a bread like maltiness and ends with a bit of a pepper dryness. Low carbonation with a good mouthfell. Don't get a chance to drink an Alt very often and it was a nice change."
"Overall, a very easy brew to drink. Not heavy, but refreshing!"
"My first alt. it was golden amber color with a whitish caramel head, quickly dissipating. Aroma is unusual, almost like over ripe fruit, but can't determine what kind.?.?. Some light but lasting carbonation. Slight hoppiness, but not overwhelming. Once again the fruit taste was noticable, but still unfamiliar. Leaves mouth feeling bubbly and sudsy. No major flavors stand out, just hints. Easy to drink, would drink it again, but wouldn't seek it out."
"Overall, a pretty good example of the style. Certainly easy drinking, and pretty darn enjoyable."
"Wouldnt keep away from it, but wouldnt go searching. My first alt in recent memory, I think I may try a few more of the style this weekend."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a smooth profile that goes down easy. A drinkable beer by my standards and one I could see as being a good crossover for the macro drinkers. A solid altbier from a great Kentucky brewery!"
"Per BBC website: 1996 GABF - Bronze - Altbier"
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet and fruity malt scent that boasts of pale and crystal malts. There is a nice hop aroma as well. The taste is good. It has a sweet malty flavor that goes down easy and finishes dry and bitter. The mouthfeel is good. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking altbier. It has excellent flavor and aroma."
"Drinkability is ok not bad beer at all but not something I would buy on a regular basis. Thanks go to merlin48 for this sample."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a big old 1 3/4"" of beige head over the clear dark amber brew, with various feathery floaties. Head is heavy and frothy, and the meringue look stays for quite some time, leaving foamy bits of lacing randomly. Aroma is lightly of grains and a tad of nuttiness. Taste is lightly nutty medium malts, with a clean, crisp finish. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, and the drinkability is good as well. Nice stab at an alt, would probably even be better fresher (duh)."
"Thanks to merlin48 for delivering this one. 12 oz bottle poured a one finger light cream colored head. Orange/light rust colored and very cloudy (I accidentally poured the sediment into the glass). Smells honey sweet with lighter fruits, such as peaches, some apricot, and maybe grapes. Smells sweet and delicious. Tastes of peaches and apricot with some bitter from hops. I get a bready malt falvor, but that could just be from the sediment I dumped in the glass. A nutty flavor just before swallowing and a strong fruity finish. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Finishes dry with ample fine carbonation rising off my tastebuds. A decent session beer...but is this really an alt?"
"Pours with a one-fingered off-white head that fades quickly and leaves traces of lace. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Cloudy amber color. Nose is slightly hoppy. Starts hoppy, finishes with strong hoppiness, what else with an amber. Not my style. $1.25 for a 12oz bottle from Liquor Barn Lexington, KY."
"Smells of sugary toasted bread malt, backed by a hefty spice (gingerish) presence. Tastes of doughy malt up front. Not sweet, but tangy and kinda toasty. Hints of breaded squash(!). Hop bite comes in toward the end. Spicy, bitter--nice. Finish is toasty-bitter with lingering semi-sweet fruit and buttery bread. Medium-bodied. Ample carbonation. Thanks again kmpitz2!"
"Pours a copper/amber color with a decent head that dies away quickly. Some honey (?) and sweet malts in the aroma. Taste has an interesting fruity-hopiness to it with a sweet malty backing. This is a pretty well made Altbier. Finishes dry and clean and leaves a sweet taste."
"This beer is very interesting to drink. Nice malt flavor with carmel dominating, but too much carbonation gets in the way of the flavors."
"Bluegrass Altbier is my first altbier and I found it to be delicious and some kind of drinkable. Is there any style that Bluegrass Brewing Company doesn't do well? Thanks to SheepNutz for the bottle. Now I wish that we'd done a bigger trade."
"Pours a clear deep copper/light amber, with a thin white head. Aroma is a pleasant mix of caramel, pears, and some light hay notes. Flavor begins somewhat sweet, with light fruit and bready malt notes that give way to a nice balancing herbal bitterness. This is a subtle but very tasty beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. All in all, quite a nice effort!"
"Big thanksy-McGee to Sheepnutz for the bottle!"
"Tawny-coppery-amber in hue, slightly hazy but some animation is noticeable racing towards the head, which reached a finger in height. The compact bubbles of the white head hung together well, in other words the retention was very good. A small, tight cap lasted the entire consumption. Impressive. Subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling well. The nose is pleasantly malty, as expected for the style. There is also an airy, grassiness that is mainly at the front. The malt imparts a touch of toffee and a very weak suggestion of peat and nuts. I realize neither of the latter two are typical for an Altbier. Honestly the bouquet seems more a kin to a Märzen and a Scottish Ale mixed. Whatever, I like it, it is inviting with modest potency. The palate immediately tells me it is German. However it is also very clean like a lager. Odd. The grassy hops with a slightly herbal hint and only modest bitterness say German. The hoppiness is good but the malt makes this beer work with its slightly sweet beginning and long toffee flavors in the middle. At the finish the beer dries out substantially. This works. The finish is muddled, just a bit, mainly because it becomes tacky and too sweet. But, overall, the palate is straightforward and tasty, if not overly complex. This is a good, clean, German Ale. Medium in body and modest carbonation helps produce a good mouthfeel. This is plenty drinkable, likeable as well. It is worthy a try. Thanks SheepNutz!"
"VERY easy to drink, this goes down like water but is a wholesome quality altbier. I was pleasantly surprised by this, not expecting much for an American-brewed Altbier. Light and refreshing. Nice."
"On tap poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep amber color with two fingers of head. There is lots of sticky lace left on the glass. The smell is both hoppy and malty, a very good balance. Some caramel aromas come out. The taste is malty and a little bit sweet at first, with bits of toffee. There is a good dose of hops on a nice crisp finish. The mouthfeel is very thick and smooth for the style. The drinkability is fantastic. This is one altbier I could sip on all day."
"Appearance: Pours a copper amber tone with a nice size creamy textured cream head, the lacing coats the sides in speckled streaks. Aroma: Toasted malts some vienna possibly but not as sweet there's a slight woody tone with toasted nuts there to back it up, not bad. Taste: A very strange mix that I can't say it's sweet or bitter a bit mute overall a wave of biscuit malt with a bready characteristic that finishes with toasted malts. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied very crisp and smooth nothing cloying. Drinkability: I am not very familiar with the altbier style, but this one just doesn't do anything amazing for me it's alright but I haven't fallen in love yet."
"I was at first impressed with the copper color and the creamy head. But the head quickly sank and the aroma was correct. My first taste told me the whole story, it is not a great example of the style. There was no bite at the beginning, but it did however have a clean finish."
"Copper colored with a light beige head that sinks quickly. Aroma is of sweet malt and honey, a bit bready. Flavor is light and clean, with round malts and butterscotch, some honey and a tingly citrus finish. Smooth mouthfeel. No other flavors come through in the finish or aftertaste, except a bit more of malt and a light splash of hops."
"Clear coppery amber in color with a large foamy puffed high dark ivory head, fades slowly down to thick haze always present and long stings of lace stick well throughout the consumption. Light toasty malt aroma with some grassy/floral-like hops and notes of toffee. Taste is nice and soft, well rounded toastyness of malts, light dry grassy hops dry out some of the finish with some mild bitterness lingering. Feel is close to medium with playfully light carbonation, fluffy textured and floats right down making for some easy drinking. A good session brew, filling in a calming easy fashion with just enough flavor and body to keep it interesting. Thanks to Brent for the sample pack of KY beers from the holiday exchange program here at BeerAdvocate! Happy Holidays all!"
"Drinkability - very good session beer. Al around enjoyable."
"This beer had a medium sized ivory head with fine-small bubbles.The body was very murky and there was carbonation observed.The hue was dark orange and the lacing was good.The nose was malty and hoppy.The flavor was bitter and it had an aftertaste to it.The mouthfeel was tingly, smooth, thin and light bodied."
"Pours a medium coper color with a cream colored head. The head displays excellent retention. Soft, malty aroma has hints of caramel and biscuity notes. The taste is initially sweet, with a slightly fruity component, then finishes crisp and bitter. A touch of sweetness sweeps in on the aftertaste, but is quickly replaced by the lingering hop notes. Mouthfeel is smooth and the beer is very drinkable. An interesting flavor combination. I'll definitely consider buying more of this on my next trip to Kentucky."
"This beer pours a clear medium reddish golden color with a moderate creamy off white head that leaves a good lace on the sides of the glass. There was a slight cookie smell to the beer. The taste was a rounded fruity malt with a tart bitter finish and firm mouthfeel. Overall it seemed a good drinkable beer."

"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. I am not too familiar with Altbiers but this was okay. The other Bluegrass beers I have tried were noticeably better though. Dark amber color with a thin head. Light-bodied malt flavor with a hoppy and slightly nutty finish."
"German style amber ale.  Nice amber color.  Aroma is mild and sweet, but flavor is not as sweet.  Moderate hops bittering with somewhat dry, tangy/sour finish.  Well balanced and clean."
