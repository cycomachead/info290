"Did not care for this beer."
"An easy go to for a simple ale. Good taste, good feel."
""

"Light bready aroma.  Sourdough, slightly herbal hops. Not much caramel for an amber. Light body and medium high carbonation. Refreshing and fairly interesting for a lower ABV brew. Worth a try."

"This beer/brewery introduced me to the craft craze a few years ago. I haven't been able to try Gerst again until now as Yazoo only distributes in the south. Overall, it's a very refreshing summer brew. Taste reminds me of Alaskan Amber, both of which are like a crisper/better version of Newcastle. I'll probably share the rest of these this summer on the lake. Who knows, it may introduce some friends to good craft beer."

"Overall, a tasty, sessionable beer. I was surprised at how good this is and could easily see putting back a few on a hot day."

"O - An easy drinking brown. This would bea good beer to introduce someone to craft beer with. Definately sessionable. Would be enjoyable on a hot day."
""
"Pours to a half inch head that falls to a thin ring of foam. No lacing. Color is a deep copper-amber. Aroma is very German, with soft noble hops and sweet decocted malts. Flavor is balanced and easygoing with sweet and nutty malts perfectly balanced with noble hops. Mouthfeel is light and CO2 is good. A very tasty and accurate Alt."

"O - Solid brew - not really familiar with an altbier, but this one drinks more like an octoberfest to me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o - Overall a solid altbier that is very easy to drink; a nice alternative than al the Bud Lights being drank around you on Broad St. Nice fruit in the taste, worth checking out in a bar with not a lot of craft options."
""
"Nice golden-amber color but that's about it. Tastes like bread and has a sour aftertaste. A little bit of sweet flavor would have helped. The taste is the number one priority which is why I gave it a overall rating to match the taste. Yazoo never fails to disappoint."
""

""
""
"Overall: Rather disappointed with this beer - don't like the sweetness and I don't care for the husky grains"

"Cheers!"

"Taste is, again, toasty and grainy, with a tinge/hint of citrus hops at finish. Overall, a sturdy and session-worthy ale, but not a game-changer."
""
"This is a light caramel beer, kinda like a washed out Amber Bock or Shiner Bock."
""
"This beer came highly recommended. I enjoyed it and I think it is a great easy drinking brew."
"I haven't always been a huge fan of Yazoo, but I think this beer was done pretty well."
""
"Overall bleh. Not really an amber ale taste, bready and cracker tasting, herbal earthy hops that barely bitter it and just add meh flavors, over dried finish with a cracker taste, and not really enjoyable. This continues the streak of bad Yazoo beers. I really think the brewery just pumps out cheap beer... or maybe they only bottle the lame ones. Don't know but still haven't found a good one."
"a very nice looking pour with some nice complex smells, however it falls short in every other aspect. kind of a disappointment."
""
""
""
""
"O- It's an ok beer, but I've come to expect better from Yazoo. Not offensive, but not memorable."
""
""
""
""

""
""
"A bit carbonated, but very easy drinking."
""
""
""
"O: A very pleasant beer that is incredibly easy to drink, if you prefer malty flavors with virtually no hoppy bitterness that I could detect. Definitely glad I got a growler full to take home!"
""
""
"It poured an dark amber (almost a brown) with a good one inch head that slowly dissipated. Malt dominated the aroma. Taste was clearly a malt fest of flavors of sweet malt and caramel but not cloying. Dry finish with low bitterness. Not really crisp but very drinkable, balanced and pleasant. Gerst was light-bodied enough to go well with food (pizza) and was very sessionable. This would be a great bridge beer for relatives not sold on craft beer."
"O: Very refreshing; great as a session beer. I can see this being a perfect house beer for the Gerst Haus, served in their large ""fishbowl"" style glasses. Now I just need some bratwurst and sauerkraut!"
