"Can at Euclid hall. Pours red colored with a one finger white to off white head. Aroma is floral with some nice fruits coming through. Flavor follows this closely with a crisp hop finish it seems, very floral notes, and some fruits galore going on here. Light bodied and goes down very easy. Not really in the Altbier traditional style, but a pretty decent beer bordering on the session ale side."

"Totally decent beer from my former hometown of Loveland. One of the first craft breweries there; I've been wanting to try this beer for a while. Not bad, not bad."

"On tap at Teller's tap room for only $4.25, not a bad happy hour price. Amber color, ample head. Aroma was sort of grainy malts and not much else. Flavor was more of the same and almost made me think of wet dog. I really didn't much care for this beer and would not order one again."

"Overall, decent alt - toasted caramel and toffee malts with quite a bit of hop bitterness."
"Have an inkling I got a bad bottle. Absolutely no foam on the pour, couldn't get a decent aroma for the life of me. Still mildly effervescent on the tongue, but also a metallic aftertaste that I'm pretty sure was not intentional. Other than that a bit grainy, pours a deep translucent amber that's quite fetching. But a bit of a bad deal overall. That's what I get for buying sale beers."

"O â€“ Very nice offering here. This is typically not a style of beer that I enjoy. This one is an easy drinker and remarkably balanced. The mild hop notes can unfortunately have a tendency to fade with age on this one, the malt notes are still there of course, but it does come across a bit sweeter. Still, great offering here from Grimm, nicely done."

"The beer sports an excellent appearance and has above average aroma and flavors. Nothing overly unique, but good and flavorful all around."
"A rather pleasant Alt, the malt kept tight to the chest, while the fruit and hops put their heads down and do their background jobs. Something to sip on for a while, should that occasion arise, at least until the heretofore undetected alcohol comes into play."

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a caramel flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors."

"Pours a burnt amber with a nice size fizzy khaki head. Flavor and aroma both offer a not overly sweet toffee, some pitted fruit, and some bread. A nice crisp mouthfeel. Overall, not necessarily a bad beer but not one I was a huge fan of. I am not very familiar with the style, alt bier, but I'd personally grab an Alaskan Amber over this."

"Pretty nice beer overall. I enjoy the way it balances an interesting malt and hop profile without being overly complex; it makes for a beer you can have multiple of."

"on tap upstairs at wyknoop brewery. i am shocked to hear this won a gold at the GABF. not because its a bad beer, but because it doesnt stant out at all as something special to me. poured a clear redish caramel color with a frothy off white head. smells of amber malts, caramel, and a bit of dried fruit. flavor is a bit watered down, malt forward, and bland. i dont know, just not a lot here to get excited about. its good, but is it a gold medal worthy beverage? i would have to answer no, but then again im not a professional beer judge (hey, where do you sign up for that anyway?!). feel is fine, medium to light body, mild carbonation, weird aftertaste. decent drink but not a champion in my book."
"O-This is ok. It is sorta what i expected. For a crisp lager it has a decent amount of flavor, but the off-flavor is a little distracting. Not sure what to think."
"Had this on tap at the brewery. After tasting several Alt's of german origin this one fit very well with some of the best i've had from germany. It uses a touch of american hops to it so its drinkable to the hop heads on this side of the pond. It was a hot day and this seemed to really go down smooth. Although not a radical beer its very drinkable and would be one I would drink more than one pint in a sitting."
"A decent altbier. Nothing to go out of the way for. A nice amber color verging on a cherry red. After their porter this seemed bland and so light. Don't know much else to say except I didn't write notes and it tasted similar to an Alaskan Alt. I wouldn't go out of my way for this one or spend too much but I would for the porter."
"D: Pretty high. Though the taste is a little understated, it's pretty smooth on the palate and easy to drink. There were better choices there, though."
