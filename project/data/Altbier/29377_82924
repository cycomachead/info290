3.53,-7.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"im pretty sure this won a medal this year at gabf, but i wasnt all that impressed. its basically an american amber ale with a moderate german character to its grain bill, really nothing too unique or distinctive about it, save that its a little dryer than most, and still has that nice rich body. nothing bad about it at all though, in fact, its a relatively solid example of the style, which i suppose is what these beers are judged on at such events, so maybe i shouldnt be surprised. i guess i just figure that a beer that can win a medal out of so many entries, must be absolutely delicious, and while this is decent, its not medal worthy to me. it lacks depth and its carbonation is a bit light for me, so the beer gets tired as it drinks. im sure its nice from the can though, and we dont have many alts in cans around, so thats a nice touch too. my first beer from these guys.","StonedTrippin","Oct 05, 2014"

Beer is smooth, medium-bodied, there is a good amount of sweetness to it as I get caramel and some other sugary goodness, a little balance from roasted malts and bitter hops but it's not evenly matched. Finishes dry and is a good sipping beer that I enjoyed but not really complex and a little off key.","clayrock81","Feb 23, 2014"

4.15,8.9,4,4.5,4,3.75,4.25,"I had my CAN glass at the ready and directly following the Crack!, I instituted an inverted Glug. This resulted in a massive two-plus fingers of dense, light-tan head with great retention. The ex-Old Lady did not dig when I would pour this way, but since we are no longer together, I really don't care what she thinks. Color was more deep-brown than coppery (SRM = > 22, < 27) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a musky scent, kind of an anise, chocolate and caramel, but heavy. Put some of this in an atomizer, spray it behind your earlobes and stand by, ladies! Mouthfeel was medium, but the tastes of milk chocolate and caramel were immediate and obvious on the tongue. The finish gave it a minty character that was undoubtedly from the hops. This seemed bigger than its advertised 5.5% ABV, but that was no problem for me. This was quite good, but too much on the sweet side for me.","woodychandler","Nov 10, 2013"

3.97,4.2,4,3.75,4,3.75,4.25,"Ever since Frankenheim was pulled from the US market, I have been searching for an American craft "alt" that was as authentic and drinkable as an original German. A tall order indeed. And there have been a few come close. This one comes the closest so far. Balt Alt has the same lighter body, subtle carbonation, rich roasted malt flavor (without being too sweet), and a slight hops bitterness--particularly in the aftertaste, rendering the whole extremely drinkable. Best of all, it's fresh where I live but comes in cans so a glass pour can be almost as good as a tap. Very enjoyable.","tugdriver7","Jul 24, 2013"
