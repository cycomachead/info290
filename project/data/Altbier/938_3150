The nose brings vague citrus, modest bread crust, and some toffee. However, the aroma's intensity is a little softer than other alts. Not so much with the taste, which brings a note of citrus from the hops, followed by the standard good old bread crust and toffee. It's a lighter-medium bodied beer, which is both refreshing and nicely flavored.","DoubleJ","May 08, 2013"

4.55,21.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"Absolutely beautiful brown in the glass, with a nice hefty foam top that lasted through the first few sips, then laced the glass all the way down. Subtle but definite malt in the nose, with a hint of carmel sweetness. It was undoubtedly an older batch, but age didn't seem to have affected the taste other than a hint of (metallic?) aftertaste. Extremely well balanced flavor, with just a hint of hops tartness to balance the malt. No fruitiness to speak of, with a nice (again, subtle) bitterness to keep you drinking it. If this shelf-aged sample is this good, I can't wait to take that trip to Germany to try it fresh from the brewery. In the meantime, I'll have to savor the few bottles I could find left in the US.

Poured into a 22 oz stein. Bright white head that gave to nice lacing. Hoppy on the nose. Brown to Amber in color. Well balanced. Rich malty undertones that finished with a clean hop bitterness. Easy to drink, this one I will miss, gotta get to Germany.","JohnY","Jun 19, 2006"

I havent seen it around in quite some time. To keep myself fresh with this style, I make homebrewed versions pretty regularly. Trying mine along side of this commercial example tells me that I still have quite a ways to go to get this style right. My version is quite a bit darker, and has more of a roasty sharpness, where as the Frankenheim gets warmer, it is getting much fuller. Ill have to keep tweaking my version.","SkeeterHawk","Feb 21, 2006"

Nice frothy tan cap stacks out of the stein and lasted...great lacing on the glass. Aromas of sweet malts and herbal hops, slight mustiness. Starts sharp/dry then mellows on the palate as the sweet malts and alt yeast produces a sweet-nutty-bready taste... then the finish becomes drying with the herbal German hops providing a medicinal bittering in the finish...all in all a very nice commercial Alt from the home of Altbeir...

Lightly sweet malt upfront is balanced by a barely bitter hop tea flavor that kicks in midway. The malt fades away in the finish leaving a tasty mild bitterness. The body is light, but not thin; it's just right. I could put these down all night, and combined with the fairly low ABV and price ($6.99 6-pack) I had to give it a 5.0 for drinkability. Now I just need to find a local source.","HappyHourHero","Apr 07, 2005"

Maybe some roasted malt characteristics in there towards the finish. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is very prickly with carbonation and a drying sensation on the tip of the tongue.

The taste is good also. It has a smooth malty core with a dry and slightly bitter finish. It goes down easy with a creamy ending. The mouthfeel is fine.

The aroma is of sweet pastry in the beginning, but soon picks up grassy characteristics and a hop presence. Flavour packs toasted dry malt along with astringent herbal tones and a bittering hop finish that is very dry. Mouthfeel is full and rich, but the aftertaste leaves the palate dry, nearly parched. A very curious experience, yet not really my kind of beer. Although looks are deceiving in this case, it is still a very attractive looking beer all things said and done.

Not the most attractive appearance but nothing to put ur nose up at. Smell is bready and presents notes of ginger (?) and hickory (?). Flavor is much the same and has no discernable hop properties. Mouthfeel is full and leaves a satisfied feeling in the belly. I didnt feel that this brew was particularly drinkable though.

Taste: Soft tones of malt sweetness balanced with a dose of German hops and harsher roasted malts coming to the forefront of the flavor, simple and straight forward mass produced. Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation with a medium to light body a nice intro to the alt style bier.

3.43,-8.3,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"Beer had a nice clear, dark, copper color and poured with a health one inch head. Although the head died down moderately fast, a decent lace was formed that stuck to the sides of the glass. The aroma was malty with a slight bit of hops. Flavor was most noticeably about the malts which were a little roasty and picked up a little sweet fruitiness as the beer warmed. The beer was fairly light bodied with a light carbonation on the tongue. Mouthfeel was smooth and a touch creamy towards the middle. There was only a slight hop finish and malts came though again in the aftertaste. Not a very assertive brew, but okay non the less.","byrd","Sep 10, 2003"
3.53,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Clear, coppery-reddish/brown hue, off-white foamy, bubbly head, a fingers worth at its apex, slowly fades (good retention), very minimal lace. I was surprised at how clean and hollow the nose was, light caramel and grain/husk/hay/grass hints. Mediocre. The palate is crisp and refreshing light toastiness, caramel malts, very mild bitterness, lightly husky & grassy. Decent. Medium body, modest carbonation good, durable mouthfeel. Clean finish. Very balanced (maybe too much so, nothing grabs your tastebuds and says hello). Easy to drink enjoyable enough nothing worth hunting down but Id quaff it again if need be. This Alt would be a good beer to cross people over with, more lager-like that ale-like.","bditty187","Sep 05, 2003"

Decided to give this Alt a try instead as it is a nice compromise among the two. The head on the beer was impressive at the start but receded to fairly thin line unlike the british style ales where it generally persists longer. The beer leans more towards malty to dry rather than an overly hoppy taste. Very refreshing and smooth like a lager but not as bland. This is very drinkable brew that is somewhat let down by a lack of body. Will try again from time to time.","rajendra82","Aug 08, 2003"

3.61,-3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"This beer poured into the glass amber/chestnut/mahogany brown in color. It was clear and well carbonated. It produced a head that was tan in color and the consistency was dense, foamy and seemingly sticky. The lace that it produced had much of the same characteristics as the head, sticky and stretchy. The aromas that were pouring out of the glass were of roasted malt, nuts, floral hops, and hints of brown sugar, fruit and yeast as well. The tastes were of a good percentage of hops, mostly floral, but I also noticed some burnt malt, roasted nuts and malts, yeast and fruit. It was slightly watery in the beginning-middle but over all it was dry. The aftertastes were mostly of floral hops. This beer was clean and crisp IMO, it quenched my thirst with its dry nature. States that it follows the strictest German purity law, Reinheitsgebot, and I would have to agree. Not stellar, but really good, especially if you want to experience Reinheitsgebot.","Jarod","May 06, 2003"

Amber color with more brown than orange or red hues. Taste is restrained. A blending of a smooth malt with some bitterness, but lacking in a bite or bitterness.

4.33,15.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"A lovely, clear reddish-mahogany body reveals some golden/orange highlights when held to the light. A short but creamy white head holds fairly well, and initially leaves thin sheets of lace about the glass. It drops to a creamy collar but continues to leave some nice thin lace. The aroma is of fresh, grainy, toasted malts with a light touch of diacetyl that adds to its complexity with its buttery character adding warmth and combining with the toasted malt to give it a gentle nuttiness. The body is light but creamy and smooth; due to an impressively fine and moderate carbonation. In the case of this particular beer, it adds to the overall drinkability. The flavor is as might be expected given the aroma with a toasty malt upfront; grassy and herbal hop flavors as it crosses the palate; and some residual butteriness and caramel character in the gently lingering dry finish. The bitterness is firm against the relatively light maltiness; and it's exceptionally well-balanced! It's a bit lighter in overall character than some other Dusseldorfer Alts; but it's still quite drinkable, with enough character to keep it interesting throughout several servings. Well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Apr 06, 2003"

The aroma was very skunky with some mild malt undertones. The taste was just as skunky as the aroma. I noticed a slight bit of nuttiness and malt. There was a wretched, bitter aftertaste left. It took all I had to finish this one off.","Scooter77","Mar 30, 2003"

There were no hops. An alt should have a bitterness and an malty offset. I tasted the bitterness a little and the malt even less. This beer finishes with a little sweetness. I think it finishes better than it tastes. The mouthfeel is semi full and has little carbonation or tingle on the tongue. It is an okay beer.

No noticeable bitterness, but a solid, somewhat dry, somewhat roasty sweet malty presence -- more so than most ales, of course.

The taste is another matter -- to me...I, too, had a bottle not destined to expire for many months and still got a heavy mix of slight skunk and "wet cardboard" from the malts. There is a residual nuttiness, though. Hops on the other hand, are nice and give a good crispness. Unfortunately, the malt tastes that are in good balance with the hops are not particularly pleasant. Some German brews have a similar malt character that I usually call "nutty" rather than "cardboard", this beer falls in the latter category. Fairly light bodied and medium carbonation.
