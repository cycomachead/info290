"Pours a deep amber color with a tan head that fades to some lacing. Aroma of malt caramel, dark fruit and hint of alcohol. Taste of malt, caramel sweetness, bit of dark fruit and spice. Mild bitterness with a dry but slightly sticky finish. Fairly medium body, smooth and malty with a definite feel of the alcohol. Enjoyable beer, reminds me of an Altbier but with a extra splash of alcohol."

"Overall a double Alt brewed by O Fallon is not terrible but its just not worth the $3.50 I paid for the single."

"Taste is also a more toasty caramel malts, with subtle hints of an almost fruity note submerged beneath. Sticke Alt is a rich tasting experience, with nary a hint of the high 7.5% ABV. A solid drinker, but, for me, one to enjoy slowly."
"Pours a clear, copper color. 1/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight hops, hint of roasted malt, slight caramel malt, and slight pine. Fits the style of an Altbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, caramel malt, hops, slight citrus, hint of roasted malt, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, not complex and weak appearance, but decent aroma, blend, and body."
"The current version is 7.5% ABV. I haven't tried it, but it would likely be a bit lighter."

"Tried years later, in 15, and it's more bearable, with notes of toffee dominating. Smoke is subdued."

"A decent Altbier but nothing I must have again."

"Overall: Really cool that O'Fallon took a shot at this style, even this over-the-top interpretation. It's not unpleasant in any way but, for me, there's not enough malt to support the high hop rates and the alcohol (which, to be fair, doesn't taste like 10%). This was $9.99 a 4pk...at that price, I MIGHT pick this up fresh if they were to brew it up again. I'd have to give this one a B-."

"I would buy this beer again, but have been unable to find it in the ST Louis area."

"Drainpour, bought in Cleveland. Pours dark with faint beads of a head. Malty, raisin and chocolate aroma, and some coca cola. The taste is chcooalte and mollasses, didn't work for me. Middling mouthfeel. Weak for the style. Didn't feel like 10% but some alcohol warming."
"D/O- Taste initially was okay. As it warmed the thought of finishing the whole twelve ounces seemed like a daunting task. I agree with whoever said there was a slight ""medicinal"" taste as it warmed."" I should have split this bottle with someone."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a stange glass, the beer pours a murky brownish/red color with about a half inch tan head and some sediment floaties noticable in the glass. Head retention and lacing are both OK. Aroma is bready malt, dark fruit, toffee, and some caramel. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but there's the addition of some booze, molasses, and a medicinal flavor that was noticable as the beer warmed up more. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and syrupy with a good amount of carbonation. The more I drank of this, the less I liked it. I don't think it's a bad brew at all, but in the end I just didn't care too much for it."
"This is very tasty and easy to drink. It has a bit of booziness which will keep you from drinking it to excess. It is also a great example of the style, though a little bit 'boosted'."
"Drinkability - a little strong for extended sessioning, but a pretty good little night cap."
"Overall, this beer is a mess. The dark fruit up front is overwhelming, the alcohol on the finish is way too hot. There is no hop taste of any kind at all. The mouthfeel Is off. There's just too much wrong with this, I won't have this one again."
"Pours an amber color with absolutely no head after an aggressive pour. Some carbonated bubbles line the outside of the glass but quickly fade. Appearance resembles tea. Smells of sweet caramel, malts, some fruits including plums and fig, and a subtle but present hop presence. Taste has plenty of caramel but also has a sweetness from maple syrup. Mouthfeel is also somewhat syrupy. Quite a bit of alcohol is on the palate as well. Overall this is a decent brew. Truly unique and a new style for me. Taste is nice with the sweetness."
"I'll sticke it to my taste buds with this brew. It's full-bodied and high alcohol lets it's presence known. It has a dark ans cloudy brown look with a ton of sediment swirling about the bottom. The aroma is a mix of maple syrup and plum. The aroma is more plum with sweet malt and a hint of orange. It's smooth but leaves a bit of a tingle. It hides the alcohol well. It's very nice and worth another try."
"Mouthfeel has a medium body with a thin carbonation. There is a light creamy texture that goes down smooth. This is very easy to drink at 10% ABV."
"I will have this again (even though I WORK for the man - I am a henchman, don't ya know)."
"Too boozy. This doesn't make a bad sipper though."
"Best or worst name ever. Not really sure which yet. Regardless, it pours a clear russet-amber topped by a half-finger of sandy foam. The nose comprises light maple syrup, toffee, and orange peel. The taste holds notes of toffee, orange peel, and a strange combination of char and rubber. Blechhh, I hope this is just a bad bottle, but no one else around seemed to have the same painful experience I was having. Must just be me. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, not too big a fan of this. Period."
"Reasonable. I find this to be really tasty. It's very flavorful, but also high in ABV. I got the bottle for free, so I can't say much about cost, but the beer itself is great overall, as long as it doesn't cost a fortune."
"d - Overall I wasn't too impressed with this one. Something seemed off in the smell; nothing offensive, but not good. Taste was slightly better but the alcohol hurt it. Wouldn't seek out again."
"For a Scots Ale, this would be pretty good. As a sticke alt, not so much. Not sure what they were trying to hit with this, but I call it a swing and a miss. Not impressed."
"D - I foolishly opened this expecting a nice session beer and didn't notice this was a Imperial Sticke. I'm not sure I've ever had a craving for such a thing. Don't think I'd have this one again, as it took me quite a while to work through all 12oz."
"D - Flavors are easy on the palette, able to really take in the complexity. The ABV in this beer is very hidden - sneaky. Not filling but the thickness probably wouldn't lend towards sessioning."
"A sipper for sure but not a chore to drink. I like."
"Pours a clearish, iced-tea brown. A fine, tan head stickes it to the glass. Smell is molasses and caramel and toffee and other assorted good candy malt hues. A little bit of spice attempts to keep things in balance. First taste is hot and syrupy. A few unidentified flavors come to the front along with some fig. An alcoholic presence lingers for a while, and the feel is viscous and finishes bitter. Interesting complexity after-the-sip. Drinkability above average. This is an interesting brew, but borders just a bit too much on the medicinal side."
"Notes: strong, malty - yet well hopped - ale that drinks like a lager and approaches light brown ale characteristics"
"Seemed way too heavy handed for the style - at times knocking on the door of barleywine. Hazy caramel brown. Sweet malt aroma. Up front sweet malt - caramel and brown sugar - followed by a blunt hops bittering, combining for bittersweet finish that was discordant. Boozy alcohol bites at the end. A fair bit of brown sediment at the end of the last pour. Not digging it."
"Lightly toasted malts up front give way to caramel-tinged fruit. And I mean lots of fruit. Tropical and juicy with ample sweetness. Almost juice-like. Somewhat boozy. Strawberry and cherry juice before a dose of mildly bitter hops in the finish. Warming, with lingering fruity sweetness. Medium-full body with a slightly sticky feel. A little too one-dimensional."
"Alt beers are one of my favorites styles, but not this one. It's a little too sweet and boozy for me."
"D: Goes down ok, big kick, somewhat filling, ok representation of style. I wouldn't grab this one again in the future as the booze is a bit too much for me."
"Mild, too, on the palate, perhaps more so than the nose. A bit unpleasant, really, the more of it I drink. Tannic and chalky, boozy, a bit of astringent nuttiness, mild tart cherry, somewhat grainy. Quite full bodied, drying finish. A bit oaky, it seems, which unfortunately only adds to the tannic woodiness instead of giving some nice caramel and vanilla notes. I'm really not sure just what to do with this beer."
"Drinkability: It's interesting, and makes for a good sipper, but it's definitely not something I would seek out on a regular basis due to the higher ABV. The flavors are good, but again, not something that I would like a lot of as the sweetness and booziness really become a bit much to me after a bit as well."
"Drinkable as a double alt can be. I like where O'Fallon was reaching for on this, I hope we see more such as this in a 4 pack format! A touch warm booze-wise. I would happily pick this up as a seasonal release; if an option"
"Fruity esters surface in the taste, cantaloupe or melon, plum, dried fruit and bitter walnut. Low to medium bitterness, hop flavor is herbal, earthy, and fresh. Very malty, a rich blanket of toasty malt tidal waves across the palate. Carbonation is somewhat low, but it doesn't distract. Definite sipper."
"D: Very nice, enjoyable. A very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, with a flavor that it quite delicious. Not amazing, but very good, and it hides it's alcohol well."
"It's a pretty far fetched Alt beer, but I see similarities with the olde German style. I guess if you add steroids to Hannen Alt, this is what you get."
"D - O'Fallon had their ABV cap lifted and they've gone big with a 10%+ Wee Heavy and now a 10% Altbier. This is quite good though."
