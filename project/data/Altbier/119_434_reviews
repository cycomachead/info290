"Light simple beer. Tastes like a pilsner with a little sour apple. Some yeast flavor.  Good for a simple session beer."

"First time re-visting this beer in a long time - an early craft brew that I drank quite a bit of in the 90's. Served in a nonic. Pours a copper hue with a slight haze. Head quickly dissipates into a band around the edges and a soapy froth across the center. Nose expresses toasted malt with a little biscuit and a hint of sweetness. Taste consistent with nose with a slight metallic quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a crisp carbonation. Overall, an exemplar of the style, particularly from the American craft market."

"DATE REVIEWED: May 24, 2014... GLASSWARE: Howard's Pub pint... OCCASION: a holdover from the last poker night... APPEARANCE: dark amber body that is lively and slightly opaque; off-white head is mostly creamy with a bit of rocky space; good open lacing... AROMA: sharp caramel malts with enough metallic clank to disturb the doughy biscuit that settles... PALATE: smooth yet slightly warm; mellow, swift and too light to hold attention... TASTE: nutty and caramel with the sweetness near to lip-smacking; hops are in check and not distinguishable... OVERALLL: serviceable and sessionable, but not a six-pack I'd seek to revisit; rather straightforward and predictable, with only the comfort factor working in its favor...."

"Despite the tendency for the heavier grain bill and toasting to be less clean, this beer avoids that nicely. It's quite clean, in fact, as well as being smooth and offering a nice, solid crispness in a well-rounded medium body."
""
"O) A good all around brew. I'd drink another."

"O: Kind-of unimpressive. Hop flavor oddly absent for an amber ale and overly plummy."

"Remarks: good session beer, and not that bad; just not that great either"

"3.75 D: Not a whole lot going on, but it is tasty."
"Pours a solid everyday copper color with a nice one inch foamy head. Left a good amount of lacing along the pint glass. Smell is slightly sweet, a little starchy, with the faintest hint of caramel. Taste is a little bitter, but nice and complex. Full bodied. Good overall beer."

"Overall, this brew takes great pictures. It's great to look at, but, less rewarding to drink. It IS a good beer- I just don't love it. I'd drink it again- there just isn't anything distinguished or noteable about it."

"Nice amber / copper color with decent head and mild to moderate carbonation. Mild fruity and caramel aroma. Bitter metallic and candy notes with a hint of caramel nuttiness and sweet alcohol in the background. It kind of falls flat a bit. Finishes with a bit more alcohol and floral notes."

"Overall: I have loved this beer for years and so happy to have drank another again. Maestro, one more beer please."

"O: Not the most interesting beer due to the single dimension to the flavor and aroma - don't get me wrong in that I like the caramel malts but I wish there was a little something else to add some layers or complexity. Easy to drink."
"Pours a deep copper color with some white head. Smells of typical upstate NY (saranac) and VT (long trail/otter creek) sweet malts. Not much hop aroma, but didnt expect it either. Its flavor is your typical altbier sweetish malts, lots of backbone and body though. Its a very drinkable brew, some slight hops notes, but would like a bit more hops...I guess that would just be a Pale Ale then huh..."

"This is a simplistic beer. It's caramel sweetness throughout. It's easy to tip back a lot of these but it gets boring after just a few. I'll pass in the future."
""
""
"This beer is a good brown and a good red mix. Otter Creek is a good maker of beer, and this selection is a solid offering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is simply a solid beer that is just on the edge of exceptional for its style from a brewery that has been making solid beers for a long time."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is easy to drink because it’s relatively light-bodied and there’s only a little bit of sweetness. However, the taste is very one-dimensional and lacks flavors of other types of malts and hops."
""
""
""
"O - Pretty good altbier. A very drinkable and balanced brew."
""

"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle. Sampled on April 23, 2012. It pours a hazy dark amber with a moderate beige head that diminishes. It leaves plenty of clinging lacing along the way. The aroma is of sweet toffee malts and grains. The hop note is subtle to non-existent. The body falls into the medium range and is fairly durable. The taste is emboldened with sweet toffee malts with a relatively clean hop finish. This is not a bad beer."
"O: this is not a bad beer, very similar to an American Brown, so I should really like it. However, I will say I think I would only have this again preferably on tap."
""
"Mouthfeel is fine- medium light body with light carbonation. It just needs more SOMETHING. Highly quaffable. Got this in a 12-sampler- the Spring Bock is the best. Won't get this one again."
"O - Just as their other beers, this one didn't wow me nor did it disappoint me...a nice representation of the style with low hop bitterness and not over-the-top sweetness"
"O: This was nice, drinkable, but ultimately forgettable."
""
""
""
""
"This brew is very malty sweet and a little spicy. If you like heavy malts with some spice you will probably like this brew. However I would have liked to taste something besides spice and some toffee mixed in with the malts. I have had better beers from Otter Creek."

"O - It was the best available beer, so it worked for the situation. The food was awesome."

""
""

"Overall - A good beer. Nothing exceptional, but good for the everyday brew."

""

"This beer pours a copper red/amber color. The head was big and fluffy white and lingered for quite a while. The beer had great lacing throughout the drinking process. The aroma was malty, metallic, and caramel-ish. The taste of the beer is mellow with a slight bitterness in the finish. The flavor is very smooth and slightly/iron like. The mouthfeel is good and dry, crisp and very light. I am no very familiar with Altbiers, so maybe this is everything one should be! I just don't know. I do think that this was a well crafted ale though, nothing spectacular, but very balanced and smooth."

"mouthfeel: burps taste nice and sweet..."
""
"D: Definitely not a Sticke. Rather dry and toasty. Backed firmly by largely woody hops. Quite tasty, but lacking any significant umph to the malts and softness to the body that could really make carry it all and make this one shine. It is probably better with pub grub, but is pretty alright standing alone."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: This beer is quite quaffable, a nice basic beer to keep on the short list."

"Pours a deep copper color with a huge white head that slowly recedes and places much sticky lace on the sides of the glass. Smells quite malty with toffee and caramel being dominant in the nose. Bready with faint earthy hops round out the nose. Taste is toffee and caramel with earthy hops and hints of pine. Medium body with a spirited level of carbonation and a bubbly sweet mouthfeel. Decent brew that's easy to drink. Not really my favorite style, but glad to have tried it."
""
""
""
"Not bad. Poured a coppery-amber color, clear, with a small cap of white head. Biscuity aroma, light sugary malts, woody. Taste followed the aroma pretty closely, with toasted bread, grainy, light sweet malts, woody and a bit, well, coppery actually, as in metallic. Hops came in a bit pithy with what seemed like some funky notes. Not overly flavorful. Light-medium body, and moderately drinkable, but just a bit too bland, and the metallic taste (and subsequent aftertaste) didn't make a good or lasting impression with me."
"Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Very sessionable. Pretty bland overall but still a good quality brew and a good representation of the style."
""

""

"a great session brew. pours the color of a new penny, with a prominent tanish head that slowly resides. smells pure, high quality, rich, malty, unique. flavor is less hop driven than a traditional american pale ale, but not as malty as a more traditional english pale. it as found a happy medium somewhere on the spectrum of daily drink ales. rich velvety mouthfeel with a medium body make this a very drinkable beer. pairs well with anything from the grill"
"Just shy of medium carbonation with a thin but still somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Very easy to drink. This is a great summer session beer for someone who’s not quite ready for the bigger flavors out there. Still enjoy it on occasion, and much prefer it to OC’s summer ale."
"This is a overall good beer we will not let the mouth feel stop us from drinking this. Will go nice with some ribs, pork of course."
"Really enjoyed the beer, at 5.4 would be a nice session beer."
"Poured a 1.5"" off-white head which floated a merengue for a while. Color in masstone looks more like a hazy burnt sienna than copper but when held to the light the copper came out. Not much smell, even after it warmed a little, just a little malt. Taste and body were surprisingly kind of watery, just a little malt again. There is a subtle bitter finish which persists. It's OK but not at all what I expected. Maybe it was just my sample."
"O: Very drinkable and looks nice in a pint glass. Interesting flavor."
"O/D-A step down from the word 'solid'. Light-years from great. Just another beer I will remember I have tried, but not remember anything beyond such point."
"Decent head, dull amber to orange in color. Smells delicious and enticing. Not a very full mouthfeel, mostly muted. Hard to discern any particular flavors other than a hint of brown-sugarish sweetness. Overall, a very standard type of beer with nothing bad to say nor nothing terribly exciting to report."
"Amber color with a nice silkey off white head, good retention. Scent of light roast and noble hop. Nice malt body melded well with noble hop, slight chalkiness. Over all a good beer and a style I wish was more common."
"This one is tasty enough and something I don't mind drinking if it's around. But it's not something I'd seek out. Like much of Otter Creek's lineup, it's one of those beers that's perfectly adequate but nothing spectacular."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this is a good copper ale, and grows on the drinker as the bottle empties: the flavors do not decrease, as happens in some beers, but become more noticeable and refined. The semi-burnt notes can get a little overpowering if the beer is drunk too quickly, making this an excellent sipping beverage."
"I find it strange that both Otter Creek and Long Trail - two (relatively) big breweries in VT - have a year-round altbier. For my tastes, Otter Creek's offering is greatly superior. It is certainly not an exciting beer, but I would not mind having in my fridge more often."
"O - Decent, but nothing I would seek to try again. Thanks for the extra dsgolovin!"
"This beer seems absurdly drinkable and pretty much seems to me to perform its duties as an alt very well. Nothing spectacular, but a good beer for the sake of having a beer."
"12oz bottle. Pours a murky, dirty copper color with a small amount of head. Zero lacing. Aroma is earthy and malty. Sort of sweet and sour smelling. Maybe a bit of caramel. Taste is bready. More of that tangy flavor I smelled earlier. Earthy flavor. A bit watery and thin but easy to drink and an alright beer. Not much else to say about this one. Decent mix pack beer but not worth grabbing on its own."
"overall, an average easy drinkin' beer"
"This is really refreshing, yet bitter in a way that demands you draw another sip. For the style, I think this is excellent. It's called a copper and I think that's a perfect description for the sensation. Would love to try this on tap with some fish and chips."
"Clear orange amber colour with a thin cap of foam that settled quickly to a collar. Mild aroma, earthy, malty with some brown sugar sweetness, toasty with faint hops. Moderate bitterness that lingered. A little juicy, citrusy up front, malty mid-palate. Definite grapefruit character in the finish. medium bodied with lowish carbonation, fairly dry. Overall, pretty decent. Easy drinking with nice flavor, a little fruitier than I expected."
"Copper colored, clear, no head or lace, plentiful carbonation. Muted malt aroma with a candy like characteristic. Medium carbonation feel. Flavor leans toward the malt side with the same candy like quality in the middle. Some bitterness in the back, but all in all, a mediocre brew with nothing descriminating it from the thousands of other pale ales."
"Great bold malt flavor, but didn't forget a good dose at the end to keep the hopheads happy."
"Overall: A well rounded, easy drinking brew of a style that I haven't had many of. I found the bitterness moderate but it may be a little too much for those very sensitive to it. Recommend trying this one."
"O: It was ok, nothing amazing. Liked the fruit flavor, but the chalky mouthfeel wasn't great."
"Tasted warm going down, makes me think this would be nice for autumn. I was missing the hop presence on this one. Dry finish which I liked, but otherwise empty and tasting watery in the middle. A decent copper, but nothing exceptional."
"nothing special here. move along. if there is one beer in Otter Creek's lineup that is in need of overhaul it's this one. since when does altbier mean ""boring, uninspired ale""? that's the vibe i got with this one. will not have again."
"12 oz bottle. Pours deep golden with a thin, white head and lively carbonation. Aroma is bready malt, caramel and grassy hops. Light-medium body is smooth. Flavor is of light grassy hops and caramel malt. Light, short finish. Nothing exciting about this brew."
"Overall, this seemed to be a very, very plain beer. Flavors seemed meshed together, no defining characteristics noted at all. It drinks fine, but nothing stood out."
"D - Drinkable, esp. for those who enjoy the Altbier style."
"Vermont offers many more superior beers than this one."
"D - very drinkable, goes down smooth"
"I had this beer years ago and remember loving it. However I grabbed a six pack the other day and had a different experience. It poured out a beautiful copper color which was the only thing that seemed the same. The smell was graining and floral, but not awesome. The taste was pretty similar. Had a nice head on it but a little too much carbonation for me. All in all a half way decent beer but definitely the same as it was before. Not sure if its a new recipe or a off batch. Guess I'll have to pick it up a six pack again ina few months and find out."
"(87)"
"D: Good. It goes down pretty easy. Overall, I'm not too impressed, though."
"Drinkability- although this is drinkble th carbonation could be too much after a few. however when drinking in a mixpack is good"
"D: Robust yet smooth flowing."
"Otter Creek Copper Ale pours with a orange/amber colour. The head dies away quickly but some lacing remains around the edge of the glass. The smell tastes like yeastiness and some maltiness. Starts out crisp and hoppy. There is also a hint of sweet maltiness. The finish is crisp, like a lager. This is a very nice and drinkable beer but it's not that interesting."
"Drinkable, but disappointed."
"Drink - A highly drinkable beer that would make a good Oktoberfest brew. I wouldn't seek it out again; but I'm happy I tried it."
"Appearance is a copper color with a one finger head, that with some time has some lacing. Smell has malt, sugar, some hops, a nice aroma overall. OCB`s copper ale tastes slightly hoppy, but also watery, with a tinge of a bitter finish. MF is medium bodied. Drinkability is good as it goes down easily. A nice option after a day on the mountain in Vermont."
"This beer has good drinkability for a sunday afternoon. I don't think i'll be buying a six pack again but I wouldn't turn one down if offered."
"D - Easy to drink, but I don't love it and would probably only ever have one in an evening."
"On ode to Vermont beers. This beer is what got me to love craft brews. I was a poor college student and it was love at first sip. The amber color so clear and defined. The sweet, yet malted aroma got my attention. Then the flavor was exactly what I needed at the right time. Not overly hoppy or malty or sweet it was just right. Thank you Otter Creek for helping be the person I am today."
"D: nice but it does sit a little heavy, the sweetness is a little strong as well"
"Taste is a bit of an upgrade from the aroma. The hop profile is a b it more bright, with some more citrus noticeable. The malt offering is upped a bit as well. The caramel is more noticeable, balancing a bit better with the dry bready character from the aroma."
"Does down too easy if you know what I mean. Starts off with a bang visually and aroma wise. But lets you down from there."
"D. A niceley balanced beer. I think of fall when I drink this brew."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a copper color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is mild, some hops. Taste is dominated by hops, some malts, considerable bitterness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a decent brew."
"D: Decent brew although it doesn't remind me of an Altbier. Good for a couple."
"D: Very drinkable. Could definitely have a few of these in one session."
"Drinkability: I'm not sure if this is what the brewers were going for, but it's definitely not my cup of tea."
"Drinkability - it's a smooth drinking beer but the taste turns me off from having another."
"Drinkability is good. I had two of them with a california type mediterranean pizza with capers, artichokes and fresh tomatoes. The beer complimented the food well..Would be a good session beer too."
"This is a drinkable Altbier. Goes well with a chocolate dessert or grilled meat."
"great sessions brew too."
"D: Very drinkable, I liked how the flavors blended, nice beer with a moderate abv."
"Drinkability - Great beer. Clean, crisp, flavorful and refreshing. Very lightly hopped and a nice dry finish. A very drinkable altbier."
"D. My first experience with an Altbier so I'm not exactly sure what to compare this to. (It doesn't help that the Altbier description on this site doesn't describe much either.) I'd certainly drink a few more of these in the future, but I'd probably save them for fall campfire drinking."
"Good representation of the altbier style, would recommend it"
"D: One is enjoyable but I would have to pass on a second. Too sweet for me."
"Drinkability: Solid, balanced, pleasant ale that goes down with ease."
"Drinkability: very drinkable, excellent session beer. Would try again and would try other beers from this brewery."
"Pours a clear copper orange with minimal head (different from other reviews so not sure if just this 6 pack). Nice appearance nonetheless. Not much aroma that I am picking up so the flavor was surprisingly tasty with caramel, bready, ? candy tastes. Bit of alcohol towards the end. Easy drinking with nice warming feel and nicely balanced carbonation. Could go for several of these."
"Overall: Overall the beer was pretty good. As I said, it's easy going and very drinkable. Enough hops to satisfy hop lovers, and enough balance with malts for me to enjoy."
"Taste is of malts and earth flavors, provides a really dry finish. Not bitter but neither sweet."
"Not a bad beer. Easy drinking, though not my first stop for a brown- that'd be a SN brown."
"Drinkability: A solid, balanced, pleasant ale that goes down with ease."
"Taste is malty sweet (honey) with a little bit of depth to the malt flavors. Hops are there on the finish along with a little bit of toast. For me, this one tastes more like an amber ale than an altbier, and an above average one at that. Is there some Maris Otter malt in here giving it that earthy and biscuity flavor? Maybe some Special B? A decent drinker here, quite sessionable."
"Nutty flavor with strong, complex maltiness. Earthy background, with a little bit of a hoppy bitterness and a slight sour finish. Body is watery, not quite big enough for the flavor. This makes it easy to drink, but just not quite as enjoyable as it should be."
"D - Again, in case you didn't understand my opinion, this beer is not good, though it has some interesting elements. I would question the judgment and sanity of anyone who strongly advocates this. Strangely, I have had it a number of times, despite the fact that I don't like it, my friends don't like it, and the only people I know who are down with it are literally from Vermont."
"would like to see a little bit more of everything with this beer. Maybe give it another shot if they tweaked the recipe a bit."
"Would like to try it again but its a long ways away."
"BOTTOM LINE: I've definitely enjoyed playing around with this beer (6-pack) but it's definitely not on my favorites list, and probably not one that I will buy again (apologies to ""The Bro's"" rave reviews of it)."
"M/D: Smooth drinking here. Brisk carbonation and not heavy at all. The bitter hop aftertaste lingers on the tongue for a while detracting a bit from drinkability though. This beer went great with a burger."
"The mouthfeel is crisp, with a fairly light body and medium-high carbonation. This is a very nicely balanced, drinkable beer. I could session this one, for sure."
"Cheers!!"
"Pours a clear golden color with a finger of slightly yellow tinted head. Nice retension and a bit of lacing on the glass. Hops along with a bready/toasty grain is present in the nose. Taste is slightly bitter upfront from the hops, but also includes a bit of malt and grain through the flavor as well. Crisp finish to this light bodied, highly carbed beer. Overall not bad."
"Served in a Shaker pint at Stuff Yer Face in New Brunswick, NJ. Great copper color with a small white head and excellent lacing. A malty aroma. Hints of caramel in the taste and a slight bitter/sour finish. Makes a very good session beer. This beer tastes a lot better on tap than from a bottle."
"On tap at West on Centre in West Roxbury. Served in a standard pint glass. Clear, orange color. No visible head, but good carbonation. Not much smell, but taste was clean and appealing. Malty at first but then a bit of hops at the end. Drinkability is what I give this beer the best marks for. It's just an extremely easy brew to drink. Went down before I got my meal. Very sessionable, and pairs easily with food. Not bad at all."
"Taste is very fruity up front (plum, hint of raisin), with toasty barley, light leafiness, grain throughout. Light sweetness is balanced with light spicey-peppery bitterness and it is very nicely balanced. Feel is solid, fairly lively."
"This is a great all year round beer. I will look for this again. Looking forward to trying the Raspberry Brown. Thanks Bill."
"I recieved a 12 pack of this in a local beer trade. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a mini snifter I got a generous 2 inch thick white head. Clean copper appearance and lacing stuck to the glass. Smell was not very noticable. The taste is very well balanced between roasted, nutlike malty flavor and hoppy profile. Mouthfeel is very light and smooth. Very drinkable brew."
"A humble, all around good beer. Glad I made it."
"The Otter Creek Copper Ale makes for a pleasant quaff on a warm afternoon, be it on the banks of the Otter Creek or the Rhine River."
"Mouthfeel/drinkability- Good. Very crisp, tasty, easy-drinking, with full-flavor. I had more than a couple, and really enjoyed them. Worth seeking out."
"Smells same as most ales of this variety. Taste was very pleasant on the palate and left no aftertaste. Might be considered a little sharp to some but I enjoyed it. Worth serious consideration."
"T- Just like the scent, it has a strong malt taste to it with a caramel undertones. It's a full-bodied beer. It's solid in many ways, but nothing really jumps out, either."
"Quite drinkable overall, with great balance."
"Poured a clear amber with a moderate head that dissipated to a collar. The aroma wasn't very strong, I couldn't get much of anything. The taste was bitter, like a copper penny in your mouth. Hmmm, is that why they call it copper ale? The feel was light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was OK. An average tasting beer at best."
"D- Quite pleasant with smooth features and a hint of malt complexity. Feels European in some way."
"Notes - As the only altbier I've had, I've got nothing to compare it to. It's got a sharp bitterness to it that's fairly pleasant and reminds me a little of a kolsch. Definitely worth a try."
"This beer pours a clear copper color. Go figure. The head is an inch and a half of solid white foam, and recedes very slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of caramel, toffee, and toast. It isn't the most aromatic beer out there, but what is there is very nice. The taste is like the aroma, but a little more pronounced. I like how it is thoroughly malt without being overly heavy of overly sticky. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. The texture is very silky which I would not expect from an altbier, but it really makes things nice. Overall, this is a very sessionable beer. The longer I sip, the more I like it. I could easily drink this on a regular basis without getting bored."
"Pours an attractive clear copper with a medium sized off-white head that smells of a nice blend of sweet caramel malts and leafy hops. Taste has a nice orange zest that slightly overshadows the malts. This a great food and session beer, one that I keep coming back to time and again."
"All in all, it was solid. Still strong from being in the bottle so long. I was surprised."
"Pours a clear, amber color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and poor lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hops, and yeast. Fits the style of an Altbier. Mouth feel is really smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of hops, sweet malt, yeast, grain, and slight roasted malt. Overall, a little watery and weak in body, but nice drinkability."
"Doug"
"Pours a bright, golden copper hue with a nice head and a strong column of bubbling. The aroma is caramel malts and faint minty hops. When this beer is cold, it has a strong metallic twang on the front and middle of the palate. But, as it warms, the caramel and crystal malts come up front, with a more grassy hop profile mixed in. Great toasted malt palate with some balancing hops. But there needs to be more sweetness for this to be my idea of an altbier."
"Another highly drinkable offering from Otter Creek. Nothing to go wild over, but solid all around."
"Pours a dark copper color with a nice one finger head. The smell is of earthy notes and piney hops with some fruit notes. The smell is very nice. The taste is of sweet malts, there is no fruit notes and a very faint piney hop taste that is almost nonexistant. The mouthfeel is overly carbonated, it is a little harsh. The overall drinkability is okay, the color and smell start the beer off promising but the taste and mouthfeel fall short."
"highly recommended. this is the third i've had and they seem to taste better each time. impressive. obviously a fresh batch. this has the octoberfest beer in the sampler case. also has the (american) pale ale. may have paid a few extra bucks buying it here in PA, but already more than worth it :)"
"D: Pretty good. Taste and feel are alright, but there's no hint of the alcohol and the smell is quite nice. Easily a good session beer."
"Inviting aroma is mainly malty with a strongly yeasty overtone and a firm ribbon of peanut running through it. Pours a nice clear amber with a white head that is thick if not persistent. Taste is a bit wan - malty with an undertone of peanut, and tasty if not outstanding. Texture is fairly smooth and a little tingly, but nothing to write home about. Overall, not too shabby."
"D: I will give this another shot hopefully on tap or in a growler."
"Poured into a mug as a slightly cloudy copper color with two fingers of solid head. Scent is very light, maybe a hint of yeast. Flavor is earthy, with some subdued malt flavors. A bit of chewiness at the end, but overall very smooth with little aftertaste."
"extremely likeable. great session beer with great complexity."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a clear copper with a 2 finger white head. The aroma is a bit grassy and sweet. The flavor is full and smooth. A bit sweet up front, but it mellows out with a nice balanced flavor. The beer is medium bodied, avearage carbonation and a well rounded beer that would go well with most foods."
"drinkability is very good - i am sad i only picked up one bottle (part of a mix a six)"
"It leaves a really good taste in your mouth that lingers for a short while. It reminds me a lot of Long Trail Ale. Overall a great beer."
"I got this beer as part of a mix pack that I highly recommend. The price was right and every beer was good. I would certainly buy a six pack of this beer, low price and an excellent ale."
"D - Admittedly I'm not wildly familiar with altbiers, but this stuff is just kind of gross; I feel like I'm choking down that compost-like taste at times. A strange experience overall that I don't care to repeat any time soon."
"This is way too drinkable. It's sweet and complex, and I keep wanting another sip."
"slightly hazed copper color with a two finger frothy beige head and a patchy lace. spicy nose with hint of hops and a slight note of caramel. taste is slightly sweet grainy malt, caramel and spice, slightly bitter hop finish that lingers on for a bit. light to medium mouthfeel and carbonation holds up well. nicely balanced easy to drink lots of taste and moderately priced. its a buy."
"This beer was served a slightly hazy copper color with a nice creamy, foamy head to it - decent head retention and lacing. Nose is faintly malty, a touch musty and sweet caramel malts. This beer starts out with the caramel malts, becomes slightly bready then finishes with bitter hops. I really like the bitter hop finish to this one, it lingers and offsets the sweet start. This is a lighter to slight medium bodied beer, slightly more carbonated that I would have liked, goes down VERY easily. For me, this beer has definite drinkability."
"D - totally drinkable and totally refreshing."
"D: This wasn't too bad, but not something I'd sit down and enjoy a couple of bottles of. More run-of-the-mill than anything."
"Despite me dislike of the taste I do enjoy the mouthfeel. It's smooth and crisp and not to bad in the long run. I wish this beer had more character because to me it's just dull and musty. Worth a try but don't spend good money on it."
"The drink is on the light side of medium-bodied with superb carbonation. Otter Creek Copper Ale is plenty tasty, and quite a refreshing drink on a warm, humid spring afternoon."
"A very good beer, not too sweet and overbearing. I love the caramel sweetness matched with the hoppy bitterness. A great representative for an American Altbier."
"EDIT: Upon doing my homework on this beer's intended characteristics (malty sweet and NOT sour), I have to say this beer was indeed infected!"
"Just one very flavorful beer, worth seeking out."
"This paired with an array of wings ranging from garlic parmesean to spicy buffalo to bourbon BBQ, and it was great on it's own as well. Otter Creek Copper Ale is a very versatile brew which will satisfy the malt fans out there with enough balance to satisate most any craft enthusiast. A great ale."
"At a good friends party for Mardi Gras here in Burlington (thanks Jon Anthony!) I drank a bottle of this ubiquitous favorite. The color was copper/amber, the one-finger head off-white, the retention sub-par and the lacing off the collar decent. The aroma was very faint but pleasant, a mix of caramel malt and some hop bitterness. The flavors started semi-sweet with caramel malt and toasted malt followed by nuts and a crisp, hoppy finish. The bitterness of the hops at the end was twiggy and a bit woody (whole leaf hops?). Sessionable but a bit boring. The body was medium, the carbonation medium and the mouthfeel average."
"12oz bottle from Hannaford. Pours an amber body with a thin film of off-white head. Caramel characterizes the aroma, though it's really slight. Rich caramel dominates the flavor, with some chocolate and fruit notes. Medium in body and carbonation. An easy drinker, flavorful enough. Not my favorite of the style... Reasonably decent though."
"Drinkability: I can see having this beer again, it was a pretty drinkable offering, the metallic taste kind of threw me off track a bit, but it's really not bad at all. I would have again."
"Pours a medium amber color. Good head, minor lacing. Very hoppy aroma. Taste is strong almost overwhelming. Heavy hops bitterness. Not my cup of tea. had a hard time finishing the one I poured. Maybe personal taste, unfortunately Ive had better from Otter Creek."
"D: This is somewhat interesting. I won't call it a great beer, but it's got a unique flavor and nice balance. Solid and pretty sessionable."
"Very drinkable - flavorful, yet smooth and clean. Well done."
"Drinkability is very good. Extremely well balanced with nice clean structure. Definitely calls for more than one."
"Overall - Good drinkable beer."
"Slight bitter finish."
"drinkability: quality and i would drink again"
"D- excellent. A nice session ale."
"A nice little session beer, with a lot of flavor."
"As noted above, I think the bottle I tried was bad, so the score may not be representative. If I get a hold of another bottle, I will review this beer again."
"This beer is not for me. I don't like the overly lemony overtones and the grassiness."
"D: Not inspiring enough to be considered truly sessionable."
"Given to me by my uncle during a July 4 party. Deep red hue. Smells pleasantly malty. Nothing crazy, but a well balanced, enjoyable taste. Quality brew here. Would you like another chance to try this some time in the near future."
"A good alternative to a Marzen in the Fall."
"Like a maltier and softer version of the Pale Ale, Copper Ale is easier to drink and (almost likewise) exhibits less character. I could easily pop a few back without thinking about them, which is probably why it is Otter Creek's flagship. Not bad. Pretty good drinkability."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp, with a smooth finish."
"Not a bad beer. Interesting how it grew on me as I continued to sip. Alts have never been my favorite style of beer but this was pleasant to drink."
"D: Not too bad, I could drink this again or have many more of them. Pretty decent brew, I'd buy it again."
"This brew smells very malty like fresh cooked ginger snaps. Pours to a deep golden color with a slight orange tinge. Head is macro bubble and fades quickly. The taste starts as sweet like a marzen but is quickly followed by a gradual hopping that starts bittersweet in combination with the carbonation. The finish is more bitter but then gets overtaken by the maltiness. This is a flavorful Alt. Not at all balanced at the point of attack, but then why should it be? Delicious."
"Another solid Otter Creek offering here with the Copper Ale. Interesting enough, it pours a nice copper color and has a coppery/metallic sort of taste to it (in a good way though). May be hard to have many of these in one sitting but if having a few it's a nice tasty beer I'd come back to."
"Overall this is a decent brew, not great but a good sessionable Ale. I would drink it again for sure."
"Those seeking a soft beer need to go somewhere else. Flavors peak strongly then fade to the next layer. Nice beer, well crafted and consistent in flavor -- something that I've gone back to (meaning at least a couple of 6's) every year for about 10 years. Thanks to my friend for having it in the fridge. A great reminder that while there are so many new ones out there to choose from, it is important (and actually worthwhile) to return to support the local brewer who has been doing it so well for so long. I know what my next 6 purchase is going to be."
" This is not exactly a hard beer to polish off."
"The feel is watery but with some minor ale body. It could use some more body to make the flavors stick around a little longer. It's a solid ale. Not amazing but drinkable and mild. Malty and a tad burnt."
"This poured a clear copper with a bit of off-white head. It smelled like roasted barley malt and earthy copper hops, with a bit of nutty malt. It tasted like rusty and earthy copper hops, with robust roasted barley malt. It was slightly thick with some carbonation, and had a clean and bitter aftertaste. Overall this had a nice, clean flavor that was easily to drink. However, it could have used a little more hops bite."
"A nice copper color to it topped with a good head which lelf a nice amount of lacing. Taste was a refreshing with sweet spiced flavor. Slightly hoppy bitter notes at the end with a clean finish. A touch fruity but not too much. Perhaps a little thin on the mouthfeel. A good overall balance to this beer and something I'd look forward to having again."
"A great American beer, a great Altbier, and the best Otter Creek offering available."
"Drinkability- Good, I could drink a few of these in a sitting."
"D- excellent balance and flavor, sessionable, highly recommended, unique"
"Thanks to csniezek for sending this my way."
"A good tasting beer that I would seek out again. Good session beer."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this is a nice beer to drink for a long time."
"D- One of the better beers from this brewery, pretty drinkable."
"Flavor is a well-balanced blend of malt and hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is a tad thin/watery, but the flavor is all there. I could see myself latching onto this as one of my favorite local brews if I lived in the area."
"Otter Creek Copper Ale pours a dark copper color with a white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is very malty. The hops really jump out at me with this beer, but there is a really nice mix of malt that balances this beer really well. Quiite enjoyable."
"and tastes, along with relatively low alcohol. I'll seek this out again."
"Not a bad beer."
"D : Really drinkable. Would be a perfect session beer"
"Overall, this is one of my favorite everyday beers. It's tasty and crisp, but not overly challenging. It goes as well with subs as with cheese, but I usually drink it on its own from the bottle. In fact, I don't think I've ever poured it into a glass, so my appearance rating is based strictly on the bottle and guesswork. I'm never ashamed to have it in my fridge. I probably drink it too cold. It's a comfortable beer that I don't have to think about too hard -- which is perfect for after work."
"A decent offering from what seems to be a decent craft brewer. My Altbier experience is limited, and I've not had an Altbier that has been this hoppy and void of roasty elements, but this is a decent offering and I'm glad I've got a few more to enjoy."
"I could cdrink this bad boy all day long. It is a great festival and picnic pairing."
"Color, aroma, head retention, taste...it's all there wrapped up in a fine brew."
"The mouthfeel was light to medium bodied with a slightly creamy lightly carbonated dry finish that left a nice taste in the mouth. Good example of this style. A great summer/spring beer which could definitely be sessioned."
"Would gladly enjoy a six pack... drinkability knocked down due to the mid-beer development of astringent, metal, flavor."
"MF&D - Slightly carbonated with a smooth almost oily mouthfeel. The ale coated the mouth well and hung around the long after the swallow, which would have been good if the taste would have been better. Tasted like I was drinking a subpar IPA with a handful of pennies in my mouth. I did not enjoy this ale would not purchase it in the future."
"Overall this is nice beer that I could have several of."
"As its name implies, pours a picture perfect copper color, great clarity and a quarter inch of head that just sticks to the sides and soon falls. Aromas are just a touch of toasty grain (amber and Munich malts), no fruit, and some floral notes from the hops. Very clean overall. On the palate there is a medium caramel flavor, lightly toasted, finishing with a rich biscuity flavor and bitterness from the hops. Very smooth mouthfeel with moderate carbonation, but also a touch thin and watery. No problems or faults, but also a pretty mediocre beer."
"Had this one in a sample pack. Poured with a copper-gold tint and settled with a murky appearance. The aromas had a citrus, almost lemony fragrance, but the overall structure was a hoppyish, bread smell with good amounts of malt. The taste was nice and sweet with more apparent citrus flavors. The mouthfeel is stable and rich, allowing it to be refreshing and relaxing. Overall, a nice, generally good feeling drink."
"Not my style, but the hop picks up the taste enough to make it drinkable."
"This was my first Altbier, but it certainly won't be the last. The beer poured a nice light copper color. The head was quite small, but it left nice lacing in the glass. The taste was a very pleasing blend of sweet malts, and maybe a hint of brown sugar, with the perfect balance of hops on the finish. It was very drinkable, I want to get another!"
"Drinkability - This is a surprisingly good beer. I tried Otter Creek's White Sail witbier and found it to be less than satisfactory; however, this style more than makes up for it."
"D - Like i said this is a great all around beer. A perfect compliment to a cooler day. As i was finishing the beer I read that this is styled by german alt beers. Makes sense to pair it up on a cool october day."
"Beautiful penny copper color to this beer which poured out to almost zero head in my pint glass. Extremely easy to just gulp this down because it is so smooth. It does have a small hop bite that lingers briefly after you sallow but the main flavor is a nice, toasty malt flavor. Would go great with a full breakfast meal."
"Poured into a Samuel Adam Boston Lager glass, formed a 3/4"" eggshell head over the clear amber brew. Head recedes sedately, with lasting lace. Aroma is well-balanced. Taste mirrors the nose, nutty maltiness upfront, and a moderately intense citrus hoppiness. Mouthfeel is crisp and clean, and drinkability is pretty good. A nice fall-back if not a first choice when looking for a sessionable product."
"I don't think I could drink a lot of these because of the dryness. Overall not too bad, but I don't think I could have more than a couple."
"Poured a copper color with almost no head, and that with a very fresh born on date. Grainy aromas with a touch of leather in the nose. The taste starts with spicy hops, then a graininess like Wasa crackers, and crisp, dry malt. A tad sweet right before the finish, and then a long, mild bitterness on the finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and crackery and a bit spicy, but falls off a bit. This is a pleasant session beer, but nothing outstanding."
"D: Good drinkability with a great complexity of flavor. A great fall style beer with a very good flavor."
"A very solid but not knock-your-socks-off beer. I will definitely track this one down again."
"D: Very nice, sessionable, amber style ale. Bottle says ""inspired by Alts"" but seems a little hoppy for an Alt. Definitely worth trying, I would buy it again."
"Pours a paler 'copper' than expected, but certainly is copper in a muted, rather pale amber kinda way. Head of foam and surprisingly white with a yellow tinge that holds lacing. Aroma is predominantly hops, and very clean; not a favorite aroma, but a good aroma. Taste is light and malty, hops make a showing as does a distinct toasted flavor. This is like a less intense and more sessionable version of Redhook ESB, a beer I really like, but I'm unsure I want a less intense version. Flavors are great though, simple as that. Mouthfeel is watery; aimed for sessionability so it's acceptable. Drinkability is excellent, it's a well balanced beer, and I'd consider stocking it, though it's rather close to ESB as mentioned."
"Drinks fairly good, compares favorably to some Alts I had over in Germany, too dang dry to session on"
"I don't visit Alts often enough and this is a pretty good example. When I head to the store it seems like there's just too many seasonals and special releases to keep up with, that it keeps me from what I should be drinking, more sessionable brews."
"That being said, I still found the beer to be quite drinkable. It has that nice copper color, but little lace. There was some sweet bread smell that kept me interested; and the taste actually improves as it warms. Unfortunately, I could catch more of the the watery, flat finish to every drink is the recurring taste no matter how well it hit initially hit the tongue. Medium bodied as promised, it went down smoothly and imparted some good clean caramel before the aftertaste immediately downgraded it again. An average beer that I would not buy, but would be thrilled to drink if offered one."
"the second offering was their alt ; the beer pours a slightly hazy reddish-gold w/ a thin white head which dissipates quickly leaving little lacing ; a sour caramel w/ faint hints of darker fruits as it warms, very little hop aroma as well ; a crisp, strangely tart, malty nut-like flavor, at first, then the flavor thins out quickly leaving a watered down mostly munich/caramel flavor behind, a bit of citrusy hop in there as well ; a dry, med. body w/ mild carbonation, could be thinner to match the lighter flavor ; not a bad drinking beer, not my top choice for an alt at all (say that three times, fast)...."
"Overall this was a decent beer, nothing really spectaculat just a decent beer, I would go to it in a pinch for sure. But faced with other options I would probably not."
"No drink by date on this one, but, pours a very clear amber color with many rising bubbles. Topped by a two finger white head, this one has a good amount of sticky lace. The aroma is both sweet and sour with some good hop smells and a decent amount of sweet malt aroma. The taste has abundant hop bitterness and medium malt flavors that is very well blended. This is a very good beer that I would drink over and over."
"D - Not bad, but not the best balanced beer. Could use a bit more hops I think but overall, a drinkable brew."
"This is a very average beer, that is enjoyable and quite drinkable. It pours a copper color, clear, decently carbonated, some head, some retention. The smell is bready malts, caramel, some floral aromas. The taste is all about the malts. You'll get your floral malts, some dry malt flavors, some burnt molasses flavors too. It's okay, nothing special, just okay. Mouthfeel is what you would come to expect from an American malty micro and the drinkability is a plus because the beer makes no real statement one way or another. You can't go wrong here, but don't expect much either."
"The style is generally reasonably subtle, but this is more indistinct than nuanced. The thin character detracts from what might have been a decent flavor profile. The lightness of being does help make it drinkable, but I know I could do better in my search for a tasty alt. I guess I'll finish the six when I feel like having a beer I don't have to think about."
"I really liked this beer.It has a deep gold color and nice pleasant smell.The taste is fantastic with what seems to be an aftertaste of butterscotch or caramel.I will buy this product again although I don't think you will be able to drink many at one sitting.One of my new favorites!!"
"Pours to a thin head which dissipates quickly leaving a bit of lacing. Copper-orange in color, faint aroma of Noble hops like a German pils. Good bitterness delivers mildly nutty malt flavor. Fairly light body. Finishes dry. This would be a good beer to enjoy with something like fire-grilled pizza, but by itself is nothing spectacular."
"A thin copper colored liquid with very fine carbonation. The head is fairly thin with a bit of lacing. The aroma is malty-nut-like with a sour overtone, sort of a chemical hint. The flavor jumps out as fairly crisp malt with an orange citrus feel. Not bad. An interesting blend of the refreshing citrus and the mellow side of the malt/nut flavor one might more likely anticipate with a copper ale. There is a bitter aftertaste, not very harsh, a bit dry. I would say it is pretty drinkable but this strikes me as more of a good change up beer, fairly mild without being bland, somewhat unique I think. But there is a chemical quality that keeps popping up with this one that keeps me from giving it a better review."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a hazy yellow-copper color with a thin, frothy head. Smell is sweet, slightly fruity with hints of caramel. The taste isn't all that great; very one dimensional for having ""six malts and three hops", pretty well balanced though... but I think this bottle may have been past its prime because it was bottled on 09/12/06 and I'm drinking it in July. Slight caramel notes. The mouthfeel is relatively light with a low amount of carbonation. A decently drinkable beer, I would be interested to try a fresher bottle... but I won't lose any sleep over it either."
"I'll get more of these."
"The flavor of an ale matched with the smoothness of a lager - that's why I love this style, that's why I love this beer. I'll be buying a lot more. Highly recommend."
"Drinkability: I liked this beer a lot. I love beers that pack a flavorful punch and aren't huge alcohol bombs. Usually I find something this unique in an IPA or something hoppy. I wish I had a case of this stuff for the summer because it would become my quencher."
"The is a pretty nice tasting but mild brew, roasted malts and a hops, with a slight bitter finish . Mouthfeel is light and crisp, lower medium bodied brew, and medium carbonation.For a somewhat watery beer it has a good amount of flavor and is refreshing. Overall this is a nice light beer, very drinkable perfect for the warm months."
"Worth a try as a 6 pack for a barbeque or any other reason this summer!"
"Not my favorite beer of all time. The name suggests that it may taste like sucking on pennies, and while that isn't accurate, it isn't much better. Far too bitter for me, and the I guess the aftertaste could be a little metallic, but to me it just seems too hoppy. I know Otter Creek puts out a Pale Ale too, but this tastes like an IPA to me. I dig their Stovepipe Porter, and their White Sail is good too. They also have growlers that seem to be seasonal and regional that are worth a shot. If you dig the IPA scene or consider yourself a ""hophead", you will probably enjoy this one. It's just not for me."
"It's tough for me to tell how much this beer is just me, the style, or the beer itself. I've liked other Altbiers, so it's probably not the style. There is definitely some great things about it, I'm just kind of put off by that undefinable taste. I'm positive that the beer isn't light spoiled (or the like) because I got it from a variety pack, and the rest are fine. I guess I'll leave this review as a personal benchmark and have to review it some other time."
"This beer poured a nice amber/copper-ish color (hence the name) with a decent head that left lacing behind. I detect hints of fruitiness and malt in it, which I'd expect for this style ( I do know what altbiers are. ;)). The taste is strong and malty and again, leaves a fruity aftertaste and goes down quite smooth. I would say it's quite drinkable. Impressive and I believe it would make a great session ale."
"All in all a very accessible and fairly tasty beer, and i do prefer it to similarly scored Long Trail Ale."
"really nice. i like this beer quite a bit. pours a dull copper with a slight white head. smell is heavy on fruit and malt. i really dig it. the taste is much of the same, fruit and malt, slightly drying in the finish. very pleasant to drink and i think pretty right on for the style. a really nice job from a brewery that doesn't get enough attention."
"This was something I've never heard of and decided to give it a try. It poured a nice gold color, not too much head. The smell was as you expect to from any ale. It had a hoppy fruity smell to it. However, when I got to the taste I was not impressed. Left a dry taste. Some bitterness and distaste. I was not impressed with this one."
"A smooth and refreshing ale."
"A decent drinking brew - nothing outstanding - but could drink a few of them."
"Overall, a well-balanced and easy-drinking beer."
"D: Clean thirst quenching beer. A nice alternative to a ligher pilsner or similar lager style."
"Drinkability--I could make this a standard beer to have in the fridge."
"D - Superb! I could quaff these all night. Or day, whatever."
"Copper colored, with a nice white head. A hint of toasty aroma, combined with some floral hop notes. Very crisp, bready malt, combining with a hint of floral hops. Not much bitterness, but just enough. Very clean and crisp. A few fruity flavors at the end. Medium body. Very drinkable. Nothing overwhelming, but a pretty solid session beer."
"A nice lager-ish beer that is smooth enough to enjoy enjoy repeated trials. It doesn't hit you over the head with too much hoppiness which is nice. The copper-like color and clean, crisp taste help make this one enjoyable for one and all after an few runs on the slopes."
"Pleasnt middle ale taste. Smooth flavor and easy to drink.No unpleasant aftertaste which I dislike in an Ale. Generally speaking I prefer fairly strong ales and beers, but this one seems to be of decent quality without excessive hoppiness. Recently discovered at a local beer discounter so further review may continue.."
"Copper colored, as the name suggests, with a puffy whitish head foaming up on the pour. Great clarity. Good head retention and lacing. Crispy, toasty malt aroma. A bit of grain and restrained floral hops. Softly fruity. The flavor opens with grainy, cleanish toasted malt, followed by passive apple fruitiness, finishing with modest floral hoppage. I'm curious as to what hops they use, because they seem to have characteristics of american, english, to german varieties. Pretty straightforward, but subtle and clean. A good sessioner."
"Pours a clean clear orange amber straw color hue. Nice clean white head disapates to a nice lace ring around the pint. Smells light toasted malt sweetness. Mild hint of a roasted caramel. Nice malt taste mild hint of hops for a nice well rounded balance. Nice hop tang in the finish very subtle bread like yeast mixed in. Good drinkability and enjoyable. Still holds true from the first time I had this beer back in college at St. Mike's. Good offering well worth trying."
"A nice crystal amber color in the glass, glowing orange in the center. Head was minimal and the nose was disappointingly non-apparent; just a slight biscuit aroma to be found. The taste however is quite pleasant, striking a perfect balance of bread-like maltiness and restrained use of hops, rounded out with a nutty caramel flavor. Finish was as smooth as could be. A very well balanced easy drinking altbier, and a great session standard."
"Drinkability: Overall, a very balanced beer except for the smack of fruitiness up front. That may limit its drinkability with some, but I find that this goes down smooth."
"Pours a copper color (huh...) with a small head, with decent retention, and some lacing (poured from a bottle into a mug). The smell was not very strong...but slightly malty from what I did smell of it. Has a roasty malty taste to it with a touch of bitterness, although not a very strong taste overall. Feels good and clean in the mouth, without very much carbonation. A decent beer...not bad, but not amazing."
"Medium-light body, moderate carbonation. A little thin & watery....would like it better if it were a little fuller. I like that this is very much like a glass of bread, but I would like the mouthfeel to be a little more satisfying. I wouldn't say no to another, and it would be an acceptable session beer."
"Overall a very drinkable alt. This is a staple type beer. Very sessionable and good to have in the refrigerator at all times."
"D: Very drinkable, almost goes down too easy. A very solid beer."
"Another step in the quest for the perfect craft-brewed Alt. Rich amber color with a nice yet quickly disappearing head. Clear malt hits your nose as you raise the glass and the flavor is both rich malt with a subtle carmel sweetness that is at the same time just bitter enough to keep you wanting more. A tiny bit of hops presence; and a bit more carmel than some others (but both of these flavors pale in comparison to the strong malt flavors). Not truly complex, but excellent and very easy drinking. Extremely true to both the ale and altbier styles and would likely appeal to a wide range of beer tastes. Very good. And fairly easy to find where I am. So this one moves to the top of my list... for now."
"Drinkability: Average offering, not my first choice for an altbier but not one I'd pass up either."
"This beer poured a lighter shade of red. There is little head. The smell is like an amber ale with a fair hop aroma. The taste is a litttle more bitter than typical. The mouthfeel is smooth with a slight hop aftertaste. I could drink this beer again. Another good beer from Vt."
"The mouthfeel is fairly light, but I was expecting much higher carbonation from its appearance. The mouthfeel is very smooth. The beer is fairly drinkable, but not very pleasing to me. Some strong malt flavors without corresponding other flavors that I enjoy."
"D: None of the flavors are exceptionally strong. This is likely appealing in the long run. Basically there is nothing to get sick of, so I can imagine drinking these all night long."
"mouthfeel is too light and crisp for this style. very drinkable because of it's light body and crisp taste, but all in all a pretty poor example of this style in my opinion. a decent brew, but trying to be what it's not."
"drinkability: meh, not that great"
"Drinkability: This makes for a great session ale."
"Overall = Solid offering from Otter Creek. Lots of flavor and complexity. Recommended."
"A beer to go to once in a while. Pretty easy to drink and interesting flavors. It's one of those beers that grow on you over time."
"tasty. A good one to try, especially if you like the style. clean and refreshing and not overwhelming in any way. I love the way this beer smells even if not a complexity symposium.. the toastiness is just so damn fine. Worth checking out for sure."
"This pours a slightly red yellow straw with a small head that is gone quickly. The smell has a nice comforting ""bakery"" aroma with some fruit and nuts. The taste has some fruit and spices,but it also has alot of sweet maltyness. The m/f is light and well balanced. This is a good beer,not great,but I wouldn't go out of my way to try it again."
"Overall, this is a decent brew. I enjoy the balanced flavors. it's too bad that the mouthfeel wasn't a little more robust."
"Overall a good and ejoyable easy drinking beer."
"Drinkability: Why bother? Neither the aroma nor the taste is especially good, and the palate is a bit heavy to boot."
"The appearance of Otter Creek Copper Ale is very good. It has a great copper color. Smells good, too. The taste, however, I found a little too bitter. Still it is very drinkable, but is not my favorite Otter Creek brew. I've been to the brewery and sampled many of their beers. I think the Stovepipe Porter is their best."
"12 ounce bottle. Otter Creek Copper Ale pours out a clear copper color with a small head. Toasted, nutty aroma with spicy German hops. Clean, toasted malt flavor. A touch of fruitiness goes well with the nuttiness. Finishes with a spicy hop flavor. This beer is very well balanced. Medium mouthfeel. Very drinkable. I suspect I could consume a sixer of this beer at a sitting. Another good offering from Otter Creek. I wasn't overly impressed with their beers when I first got into craft beer a couple years ago, but now it's a brewery whose beers I will seek out."
"I hadn't realized prior to examining this bottle closely that it was in the style of a German altbier. This beer pours beautifully, with a clear copper color and a nice head that fades a bit too quickly. The nose is full of grain and cereal notes but it also has a slight hop aroma. The hops come out more in the taste, where they balance nicely with the intense malt flavors (but not SWEET malt flavors). This is a very smooth, drinkable beer, very much like an English Brown (a session beer), but with a more appealing hop counterpoint to the malt. Recommended."
"Medium clear body mouthfeel, and strong, crisp carbonation. A complex and most interesting beer. I suspect this beer would be sublime with a hearty sandwich, as the label suggests. To my surprise, this beer is nothing like Double Bag, but I had that at the end of a big tasting, so maybe I'm off here (that had a lot more malty sweetness than I'm picking up here)."
"This was part of a sampler pack. The label said brewed on 10/4/05. It was a clear amber color with a small head and some lacing. It had a sweet, malty odor. The taste was malty, with a hoppy background that lingered. Mouthfeel was OK, some carbonation. An average beer, but drinkable."
"Smells of amber malts, lightly carmelized. Tastes like amber malts with a tough of hops bitterness, no hops flavor or aroma. Easy drinking, but this is not what I'd call an altbier. It'd make a fine amber ale, but its definately up to par with a good alt."
"This was a good all around beer. Nothing too special, but decent as a part of a sampler, or good as a session."
"The taste is very light in texture but the maltiness and fruity flavors still prevail in your mouth. The flavour doesn't last though and a bitter taste remains after awhile."
"There's not much more to say about this one. Nothing to rave about and nothing to complain about. It's basic but tasty. I've had better and I've had worse within the style."
"D - Pretty good, nothing too interesting but definitely good if you want to try a new quencher or are looking for a different session beer one night."
"Pours a medium-dark copper with a small, off-white, creamy head with good retention and very good lacing. The smell is very inviting, a nice balance of complex malts and citrus & herbal hops. Orange, pear, whole wheat bread and is that a hint clove and marjoram Im picking up? Interesting. The taste is a little grainier than expected, lightly sweet up front with a moderate bitterness that comes out on the finish and transitions from citrus to more of floral taste as it fades. Theres a light metallic tinge in there. It has a medium body, watery texture, and good, moderate carbonation. I remember absolutely loving this beer when I was first getting into craft beers and stronger hops. Yes, I still think its a good, well-balanced beer, but its a little too thin-feeling and the flavor is a little weak in the middle. Dont get me wrong, its a solid choice, but nothing spectacular."
"The beer pours a lovely burnished copper with a tight sand colored head of dense bubbles which slowly thins down, leaving nice lacing. The smell is of sweet malt, spicy hops, and hints of biscuit. The malt and hops are well balanced with sweetness up front followed by a relatively soft hop finish. Medium body with tiny pinpricks of carbonation, but not too much. The malt provides plenty of smoothness. Highly enjoyable."
"First of all I love their illustrated labels, they really set the mood. This came in a sampler pack.This poured a nice ligth amber w/a great frothy white head and moderate lacing. Aroma contains soem caramel flavors and showcases a good balance of malt and hops. The taste is very pleasant. It is nutty earthy and fruity all in one. Pretty good mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Overall a very nice clean and drinkable brew by otter creek."
"Pours a dark amber/light copperish color with small white head. Smells malty, with a tad of fruit also, but not much else. Taste has a fruitiness to it, but the malts are definately noticeable also. Its a smooth tasting beer with just a hint of bitterness, not too much though. This beer is good to pretty good, in the drinkable category, with an average mouthfeel, but I think Otter Creek has better ales."
"Overall: Not bad, but pretty average for an altbier. I love the style so much, and this one is just a little too simple and a little thin."
"Pours a fairly dark copper color (imagine that!). The aroma is subtle, the malts dominate but there are some hops in the background. The taste is a bit different as the hops and malt share equal strengths and interplay fairly nicely. The hops seem the focus in the beginning and the malts assert themselves later. It seems very clean with not many off flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery. It's not inoffensive in any way, so makes a good session beer."
"cheers..."
"Excellent mix of caramel malt and hops with a rich, meaty aftertaste like a good smoke beer. Can't say I've ever tasted something like this--a really full bodied APA, almost, only better than most APAs."
"Drinkability is actually not bad. It is still miles above any macro-brew, even with all of the less than desirable features that I mentioned. I bought a sixer to check this brewery out for the first time, and I find that they go down pretty easily one you adjust to the metallic, coppery flavor and aftertaste. I will probably try another one of their brews, given the chance, but will not opt for this particular product again."
"An ok beer."
"Nice beer here, though perhaps a bit too ""zesty"" for my liking. Always found in the mixed 12 packs its certainly worth drinking...its just not my favorite from Otter Creek."
"Very nice beer. Poured on 4/13/05 date clearly identified. If only all breweries could be so bold! Smokey after taste, by far its strongest characteristic. Poured deep amber with reflect of gold somewhere in there. A very nice beer. This being the first offering from this brewery, I will definatley try some of their other products."
"poured a clear medium copper color with whitish head. Smell is of toasted malt with a nice nuttiness. Taste is mostly malt with a little hops in the background. A nice toasty crispness at the finish. A good easy to drink session beer. Thanks to fellow BA mtanji for the sample."
"This ale was very drinkable, and I would not hesitate to stock this one in my personal stash for future use."
"Pours a slightly hazy medium light amber with a 1 figer head and very good lace. Slight caramel malt notes with some tart apple and some slight hop presence. Some hop flavor is what first hits, not too much though, followed by a fruity malt presence - some slight raisin and apple flavors. Leaves a nice hop bitterness on the tounge. Slightly high carbonation and good drinkability. A good session beer."
"Tapped at Eli Cannon's in Middletown, CT this week. Yellow-orange copper, nearly clear, no discernable head but left a ring down the glass. Smelled of overly aggressive hops on the nose which confused me, not bad but not particularly inviting either. Decent malt and some candied apple taste with moderate hops to keep it normal. Nothing that left film or aftertaste so it was pleasant. OK carbonation and drinkability."
"The combination of malty flavor and carbonation makes my mouth happy. This is very drinkable beer, and one I could probably have pint after pint of. Wish I could find this down south... I think a lot of people that don't appreciate good beer could easily get into this one."
"Pours into stange with a thick white head, and a copper color with lively bubbles rushing to the top. Aroma is intriguing, and tells you this is not your ordinary ale, mostly a very dry, bready malt flavor with a slight fruity background...very unique. This is my first altbier, so i didnt really know what to expect...but this is definately a mellow ale and you can tell it was lagered for a while. Alot of the fruity ale esters have subsided into the background and it lets the malt profile take center stage. The malt profile is very dry, and has flavors of hay, whole grain oats and a slight presence of lemon. The finish is herbal and lightly bitter (saaz hops i suppose...those germans love em). The mouthfeel is crisp and smooth with alot of carbonation and a bitter, dry finish. The drinkability is descent but it's so different from what i normally drink it's not really a session beer."
"Otter Creek delivers an authentic Dusseldorfer-style alt biere brewed in the good ol' US of A! It's clear, dark copper body is capped by a short head of white foam that holds fairly well and leaves some nice walls of spotty and splotchy lace about the glass. The nose is lightly fruity and peppered with leafy and spicy noble hops amidst a delicate, toasty malt base. It's fine-bubbled, restrained carbonation leaves it slippery-smooth across the palate with just a gentle caress on the tongue. The fruitiness is less apparent in the flavor than the aroma, but it's still there and it works exceptionally well to brigthen the maltiness and offset the grassy/spicy/leafy/floral hop flavors; and it's precision tuned bitterness is solid enough to balance it perfectly. Very well done!"
"Taste is bready and dry, although there is a pleasant creamy quality as well, with dark caramel flavors minus the sweetness. Bitterness is relatively high, though well incorporated. Again- a very clean, easy drinking beer."
"Like other copper ales I've consumed, the mouthfeel is a bit thin and rough because of the carbonation. So while it tastes and smells great, it doesn't make me want to immediately have another."
"Pours a clear copper color with a smallish white cap that laces all the way. Aroma is nutty with some fruity notes. No real hop aromas. Taste starts malty and ends malty. Barely perceiveable hop, just enough to keep this in line. Nice nutty flavour with out being over the top. Mouthfeel is very smooth. A pretty easy drinking beer overall. Not exciting enough to merit Ohh's and Ahh's but overall a very serviceable ale that I would definitly drink again."
"Nothing spectacular but a very decent drinkable ale."
"My brother went to Middlebury College and I can remember hating this beer when I'd go visit him as an undergraduate myself ten or so years ago. At that time anything darker or more flavorful than Natural Light was too dark and bitter for me. Now I pick this up once in a while (glad they distribute as far south as Richmond) as a reminder of what I was missing. Seems to me this may have been watered/dumbed down a bit over the years; still, I have a soft spot for it as it reminds me of good times in Middlebury."
"Not a bad beer but just not the right balance for my taste. I finished the sample and had no inclination to have another at the time, but something I will probably go back to here and there."
"12 oz., bottled on 1/10/05. Batch #1670. The pour shows that it is indeed copper and it delivers a 1 inch head that doesn't leave much lacing. Smell is grassy/metallic with a bit of caramel and fruit and floral hops. Taste is very bitter (considering it's only 21 IBUs). Flavors are roasted with coffee, earth, piney/floral/spicy hops, and metallic tones. With the exception of the roasted flavors, the hops dominate - I was kinda expecting more complexity from the malts (even though this is my first altbier...however the label says they use 6 different malts). Mouthfeel is a bit dry and tingly, and the metallic smell and taste was a little distracting. Not a bad beer but nothing great."
"5/18/05 - got another sixer and I'm not noticing any of the characteristics I mentioned above. It tastes like metal. Like real copper. Gross."
"Beer is served chilled in a pint glass. The beer is a clear copper color with small off white surface layer of head. Aroma is mild with some caramel and toffee and a hint of earth and grassy hop character. First sip reveals an average body and average carbonation. Flavor is fairly mild and similar to the nose, with caramel and a bitey grassy hop profile mixing nicely. The finish is slighty bitter but not overwhelmingly so. Very smooth crisp and easy to drink. Just rather bland/average in my mind."
"A pretty drinkable alt with good balance and flavor. Not a great beer, but a good version of the style."
"However, as this pint was consumed, the flavour did improve to the end...but not enough."
"I loved Otter Creek (Cascade) Pale Ale, but the other two offerings haven't exactly floated my boat. This one just tastes odd to me, although it's drinkable. I'd still like to sample the entire line from these guys, but I've had enough Copper Ale to last me a lifetime."
"A highly drinkable beer with muted flavor that won't offend. May be a good crossover beer."
"The beer poured a nice copper, amber in color. Also, there was very little head which became a thin film that would creat the slightest of laces on the glass.The beer's flavor was of slightly bitter hops, followed up fairly quickly with a sour citrus taste that left a crisp finish. The aroma was nothing out of the ordinary. However, the mouthfeel, with its ever so slight carbonation, helps make this a very drinkable beer."
"At first, I thought this was going to be an Amber Ale, based on the name and I was shocked when I looked at it and tased it. Then, I read the label more carefully and noted that this is a Northern German Altbier, so the style became much more understandable. Not a bad beer, but I wonder why they didn't name it something else that would be less confusing to the beer consumer."
"Pours a copper color with a tall head that dies off slowly and leaves decent lacing on the glass. The aroma has a nice caramel malt smell followed up by some hops. The flavor is surprisingly smooth. Taste is of caramel malts, grains, and sweetness. Finish is slightly bitter with a nice caramel character. Nice beer."
"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep copper color (hence the name) with two fingers of head. There is good head retention and good lacing. The smell is a good balance of malt and hops. You get a sweet malty nose at first with bits of caramel. Then you get a nice little hit of hops. The taste starts nice and malty, little bits of sweet grain and brown sugar. The finish is crisp and hoppy. The mouthfeel is pretty thick, yet smooth. The drinkability is very good. A big shout out to kmpitz2 for this great brew."
"There are better ales out there, in my opinion, this belongs in the adjunct lager category."
"Beer pours a nice transparent reddish coppery color with a two finger head that falls to a quarter inch cap over the beer. The nose is a light sweet, buttered toffee to a very light caramel. There is a little hint of sweet floral/grapefruit hop in there too. The flavor starts off sweet malty, slightly caramel, toasted malts but finishes with the hops, which are sweet and a bit spicey. I like it, but it's nothing great. Theres no real thickness to the beer and there is a nice bubbly carbonation. Not a bad drinking beer, but I don't think I will seek it out again. Just sort of there."
"Drinkability: It's an easy drinker but I wouldn't seek out another. This just seems like a run of the mill beer brewed in the German style."
"Pleasantly drinkable, with lots of Germanic character due to the malts."
"Very drinkable and pleasing to the palate. Great balance of sweetness and flavor. Solid beer. A staple session beer."
"The head was larger and full of citrus overtones. The taste was great hops and malty goodness. Citrus and honey, possibly a little more roasted than burnt nuts. The mix was flawless! Both flavors had just enough play."
"It's been a while since I had a good altbier, Diebels on tap being an old favorite. Check out Otter Creek Copper Ale for a solid session brew."
"A perfect beer for almost any occation with a smoothness you can't get with most beers and a comfort level that brings drinkability to a perfect 5."
"Definitely worth a couple of brews. Not outstanding, but not bad either. Had a few while skiing in Vermont. Have started seeing the handles in a few Baltimore bars."
"Top label says, 3 different hops and 6 different malts are used to make this beer. Yes it's complex alright. Poured out a medium copper/brown color with a nice enough amount of carbonation. Smell was malty but had some hops in there. Some caramel was in there as well with a touch of butterscotch. Taste was complex but really good. Hops make an appearance first with some slight hint of fruit and caramel then blends in with all those malts. Finishes slightly sweet and a little dry which is nice for this brew. I really like this beer and should get a little more respect. On-tap this would rock."
"Overall- not good but not bad. A definite, ""Have I ever drank this before?!"" beer."
"It's a very easy drinking brew..."
"Let's see; this is called ""Copper Ale," so one would expect that it would pour a lovely, clear, copper color--which it does in a deep way, and it has a thick, frothy off-white head to boot. The citrusy hops come through in the initial smell, and there appears to be a subtle malt backbone. The malts are more dominant in the taste, but simply not forceful enough; just a touch of immediate sweetness, and then the hops make an attempt to rise up in the middle, but are forced to settle into a rather bland finish. The mouthfeel is medium-thin, and the carbonation is the right complement for the light feel. All in all, a nice, light brew--certainly appropriate for a session beer."
"I'll be serving these to the wife."
"12 oz bottle. Golden amber in color. Hoppy nose. White small bubble head, left some lacing. Smooth malty ale, with moderate grainy hopping present. Medium body. smooth finish. Decent version of an Alt beer. I prefer my Alt a bit more bold and hoppy, but this one is pretty drinkable and well balanced."
"Light feel, approaching a medium body. A good basic beer."
"Meh."
"Simple yet honest, this beer is a pleasure to drink. I would call this a beer drinker's beer. Robust and balanced, you just want another sip."
"This beer appears to have gone downhill. Otter Creek Copper Ale was one of hte first micros I ever had and I have always loved it. THe last couple batches I have got have not been very good though. The color is not as red as it once was and it is now pretty orange colored. The aroma is pretty plain, almost non existant. The flavor has really gone downhill. There is a slight malty taste but very little hops at all. It is still a very drinkable beer but not worht the money if something better is available."
"the color one would expect...copper. appetizing layer of eggshell colored foam on top that does a decent job of hanging around. big earthy hop leaf aromas in the nose. bready malt flavor carried by an ample medium body. malt character is drowned out by the big leafy hop flavors, i keep thinking raw earth and tobacco. flavor softens as it warms and gets even tastier. a session brew for sure, i had no problem putting down three of these in a row. this beer grew on me as i drank more of them, a good beer to have when you want to have more than one. good job."
"Solid, solid solid! A dark copper coloured brew with a tight head of beige foam. Aromas scream altbier. Roasted malts abound, with nice floral hops sitting in the background, watching the show. The taste is an all malt blast of tasty flavors, with some lovely hops in the finish. The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing and the drinkability is good as well. Solid!"
"Pours a glowing, clear amber-copper in color, has a good frothy white head that sticks around for a while, bready caramel aromas, nutty with some citrus in the flavor , medium body with a creamy mouthfeel that finishes with a pleasant mild hop bitterness."
"A copper color body that is crystal clear. Great looking foamy head that lasts and leaves a lasting lace. Aroma was not very enticing. Very earthy and leafy and with a burnt smell to it. Taste was similar to the smell - earthy and with a strong burnt bready flavor. A good hop bitterness but not much else besides that and the bad robust earthy and burnt flavors. I dont think black malts are supposed to give it this taste. Whatever it is, I don't really care for it at all. Ive had much better altbiers before. Wouldn't want to drink another one of these. The bottle itself and the pour were the best aspects of the beer."
"Copper color (duh!) with a nice, creamy looking head. Very good lacing as well. It doesn't smell so good, but the taste is a little better, though it offers nothing special in the way of hops or malt. This would make a good session beer, but it wouldn't be my first pick."
"-Oelergud"
"The beer pours an amber/copper color with a lacey white head. The aroma is good. It has the scen tof pale malts mixed with nutty, earthy notes. It is much different than most ""copper"" styles I've had. The taste is decent. It has a malty flavor with a solid pale malt base. Again, it has the nutty flavor of a nut brown ale, but without the presence of many crystal malts. The mouthfeel is good. It is a low/medium bodied beer with just the right amount of CO2. It is a different, but good drinking ale. It's smooth."
"Poured a pale orange, with a disappointing head. Couldn't get much to smell from this one. The taste was tangy, but also tasting much more like hops than malt. Good carbonation. The aftertaste is spicy and gradually declines. A solid altbier."
"Served a copper amber with a very short fizz of white head. Sweet malt with a touch of bready and a nicely balanced hop finish. A smooth beer which deserves to be drank all night long. My micro choices for the night were this and Long Trail, so naturally I took the better alt and drank it all night long."
"I fear my obsession of late for big hoppy beers may have set my expectations askew. This seems like a fine beer but nothing to write home about. Almost seemed to have some lager characteristics cause of it's very crisp hop profile and very clear color."
"Ah, an Alt. This beer pours a copper color (surprise) with nice amount of foam leaving some pretty lace. Smells faintly malty and a bit musty. This beer starts out tasting malty then finishes with bitter hops. It's a long finish, too. I like the bitterness, but the body is a bit light. There also a bit of a carbonic bite to this beer. Seems like a very quaffable beer until your tastebuds latch onto the bitter hops. The label says that Copper Ale is brewed with six malts, but I'm hard pressed to discern that complex of a malt character. Even so, I like this beer, and I would drink it again."
"Copper ale lives up to its name as a beautiful looking ale. The appearance is nothing short of stunning. It pours a clear copper colored amber with a short white head, 3/4 inch at best. The head maintains itself from the carbonation of this brew to stay at a quarter inch all glass long. A trail of ring lace remains on the glass, nice!! The aroma of a sweet floral blend. The taste shows that floral hop in the slight bitter finish after a caramel malt sweeter start. A very nice beer with a meal or by itself."
"Pretty clear amber color. Being an ""Alt-styled"" beer, the aroma does not predominate. Sweet caramel malt ""beer"" smell would describe things. The taste is where it's ""at."" Again, crystal/Munich malt with balancing hops (not overhopped the way other light ales can be ""overdone""). This is not an Oktoberfest nor an IPA: huge malts or hops are not to be had; balanced, light drinkability are."
"This ale pours deep amber with a creme-colored head. It is crystal clear in the pint glass. A most impressive appearance, I must say. Copper Ale smells of bitterness (I swear I'm not making that up) and it's rather distinctive hops blend. It starts fragrant with hoppy spice and intriguing malt undertones. This beer is medium bodied with caramel and nut-like flavors dominant. The finish is smooth and dry with a slight taste of wheat. Copper Ale was my second favorite beer from all my Thanksgiving tastings."
"Tasted: 11/25/03"
"Thanks go out to 36LbLoveChild for this one."
"Beautiful dark amber color with a nice thick tan head that settled and left clingly lace all the way down the glass. The smell was of sweet, maltly caramel with a wisp of hop notes. The taste was very, very big with a sweet and smooth mouthfeel with just a little bite near the end. The carbonation was at a perfect level, making every sip crisp and fresh, but not taking over the taste. This was extremely drinkable. I had a 5 gallon keg for a little over two weeks and kept interested, excited and satisfied with this beer the entire time."
"Pours a nice coppery amber color with a thin white head which quickly diminishes to nothing but a ""skim"" of bubbles. Toasted malty smell with a bit of hop spiciness. The first time I had this beer the taste surprised me a bit-not quite what I was expecting, although I'm not sure why. Some nice sweet malt flavors along with a bit of hops. Fairly smooth and drinkable, a nice beer."
"A friend picked up a couple of bottles while in Vermont which were fairly recent and fresh. I was impressed with the pour. Nice dark amber color with a beautiful creamy white head that remained throughout. Might be my nose but the smell was minimal. The taste, however, was excellent; earthy but great. This beer felt great on my palate ; leaving me wanting my friend's bottle, too."
"If I wanted an alt I might buy this one again...it's much better than Schells Schmaltz Alt in my opinion.."
"This copper ale is just a little hazy. Streams of CO2 surface at a leisurely pace. The aroma is fruity and sweet. An herbalness is present as well. The flavors are pretty clean (an indication that this alt was properly lagered??) Malt tones are biscuity and toffeeish. Hops impart a dry hebal tone. The finish leaves me wanting more. Fruitiness is present, but subdued. Medium full body and a mouthfeel that feels just a titch too carbonated for the style. That's being pretty picky though. This is an above average alt, not much more."
"Not much going on in the head department, just a thin off-white film across the surface. The color is a dark copper. The smell is strong and very malty with some caramel thrown in. The taste is malty, too with a bit of burnt toast. Maybe it's supposed to taste/smell like this, but for me it's too much. I've had this beer in bottles and from kegs before, and it was a lot mellower, not overpowered by what tastes like the center of a Malt Ball (I hate Malt Balls!). I'll give it another try down the road, but I definitely woln't be seeking it out anytime soon."
"This is a clear copper (aptly named) with a small white foamy head. The aroma is sweet and the flavor has a pleasant woody malt with a light sweetness. Very low hoppy. Pretty tasty, but not exciting. I don't think this would be hard to drink a lot of."
"Medium copper color. Medium head. Aroma is malty and fruity. A medium bodied Amber alt. Malts are fairly aggressive, nutty and somewhat sweet. Hops are slightly spicy and somewhat bitter. Nicely balanced. Dry finish. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Tasty and drinkable, easy on the palate as well."
"A newly available altbier (in my area) is a plus in my book. This will be purchased again."
"Another good all around ale from otter creek, copper color with a white head (which lasts slightly longer than their pale ale). Smells of citrus and malt, the citrus is a bit sweeter varity than the pale ale though. Taste, its smooth, with a very nice balance of malt and hops, probably a great sessioning beer. would pair nicely with chicken or a more flavorful fish."
"Poured out a slightly cloudy orange amber color. The head was huge, dense and looked like bubbly sea foam. Some graininess and grassy notes. The body is a bit thin. Tangy citrus qualities, especially lemons and oranges. This is a fresh, light and lively amber ale that has a crisp finish."
"Not a bad beer from Otter Creek. A good but not great example of an altbier, though certainly one I'd have again, if I could find it."
"Otter Creek Copper Ale is a nice clear amber color with a medium bodied white head on the surface. The head dissolves slowly leaving behind a good amount of lace on the side of the glass. I found the malty aroma with a hint of hops to be rather faint. However, the taste makes up for the smell. Each sip of this medium bodied beer is a pleasant combination of toasted and caramel malts. An acidic flavor lingers on the tongue for a few moments before the hops take over for the mildly bitter finish. There's a nice malty taste left behind similar to what you would find if you just had a sip of scotch. This is a great tasting malty beer that is very drinkable."
"A solid malt aroma with nice breadiness was the prelude to the great taste that was immediately impressive of the malting, but had solid hopping layered in as well. The feel was also very solid and full providing a very nicely drinkable Alt. This is a beer I'd go back to often if it were widely available. Unfortunately it's a bit hard to find in SW Ohio."
"One of my personal favorites, and a regular at my house. Easy drinking, and as the label recommends, try it with a meal. I haven't found many things that copper ale doesn't go with."
"This beer sometimes seems a little sour and watery, and this is enough to make it sometimes uncomfortable to drink. The carbonation is very nice, moderate and unassuming, but present. Overall, this is a little thinner than I might like, especially given the potential that it shows, and I know that copper ales have delivered in the past."
"As its name implies, this has a deep copper body that just seems like it's a little lacking. Pours with a thinnish head that quickly fades to a partial layer of foam. Slight malty aroma that brings to mind a mild vienna lager or oktoberfest aroma. Taste is slightly grainy, with a touch of malt sweetness and a good dose of huskiness. Lingering bitterness on the finish is more distractig than completing. More of a ""prolonged continuance"" than a ""finish"". Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side. Drinkability is OK. Feels like a lager to me. Decent, but not memorable, other than for its apparent identity crisis. ""The Ale that drinks like a lager."" This one goes down better in large gulps. Drink like an Irishman for this one."
"Drinkability: all in all, quite drinkable. I liked it, would try more from this brewery"
"This will be my first taste of an altbier, here it goes this one pours out a ruby copper tone with an off white cream hued head leaving even lacing rings around my glass. Aromatics are very nice within this little brew with an exotic floral hop with some very pronounced malt tones giving touches of toasted nuts and caramel not bad at all. Flavor breeds a wonderful balance between shots of hops, mildly sweet robust malts with a wonderful chestnut finish. Nothing is over the top but this medium bodied brew gives off many great qualities to ensure a clean crisp flavor with no offness just brewed to be drinkable. A great starter for the altbier category in my opinion I enjoy it and now I wish to venture toward other similar beers."
"Poured a beautiful golden color with a small white head. Smells of faint bread and a little bit of citrus. The taste was a huge dissapointment. Much hoppier than I expexted for an alt style. Finished bitter and not so pleasent. Mouthfeel was also a little thin. I gave it two tries over several days. There are much better offerings in this style."
"Looks can be deceiving. This beer looked fine, sporting a rich copper hue. The smell was bad; like opening the freezer and smelling old fish sticks. Not sure how that could have slipped in though. The taste was remarkably flat and un-detailed, like the beer itself had been milled. Quite disappointed, I poured and moved on."
"Tried this as a alternate to Red Seal Ale by suggestion, and really thought it was a stand-out. The color was a wonderful-dead on pale copper-it should NOT be cheated out of a glass pour! !The aroma was enticing, with lots caramel, pine needle, and bitter hop fighting for the lead. A very satisfying mouthfeel and taste featuring more creamy, bittersweet caramel, and some sweet malted grain-superb balance here. I think of this beer as a sort of Red-Seal ""light"" but, that may be cheating a very fine beer from its proper name, which really should be ""damn fine ale!"" Delicious!!"
"True to its name, it pours a light copper color with a very small off-white head that flattens right out. Aroma is light, and consists of sweet malt, some hints of pear, and a bit of cinnamon. Flavor is sweet malt, a bit of hops in the finish, and a lingering pear with some spice. Mouthfeel is crisp and a bit tannic. Light hop and caramel linger in the aftertaste. Overall light but tasty and drinkable."
"Overall, it's not bad. That weird taste in the middle detracts from an otherwise decent beer."
"My question is, for a supposed six malt brew where are they? A little unbalanced toward bitterness, IMO."
"Very crisp, clean toasted malt beginning and middle that finishes with a lovely German hop finish that is a very smooth transition and wonderfully balanced. Medium-light mouthfeel that goes down very smooth and easy. Good drinkability. A very good beer for the person that is just beginning to like hops."
"Pours a nice copper color with medium head that stays for awhile,very malty appetizing smell of caramel and biscuit malt.Pretty sweet taste would like maybe for a liitle more dryness to make it more balanced,but still pretty darn good.Used to be a staple of mine on tap at the local beer I used to hang out while spending a winter in VT."
"I had this one on draught and really liked it. I don't know why it's classified as an Altbier because it's actually more like a pale ale or india pale. Clear dark golden color with snow white head. Nice hoppy aroma and not too bitter. Finishes well and has a good overall balance for an ale."
"I wasn't particularly impressed by this beer. That's 0 for 3 in Otter Creek beers. Poured a sticky white head over a copper color (hence the name). Floral, earthy aroma. Taste was earthy with hop bitterness. There was kind of a nutty flavor, almost like sesame seeds. Mouthfeel was good, and fairly creamy. Clean finish. Good, but not great. Maybe it has to grow on me. (Mud bock did)."
"This was more enjoyable and balanced than Otter Creek's pale ale."
"Pours a clear, pale copper color with a negligable head (very slight lacing). Aroma is a mix of malt and german hops. The taste is remakable....nice toasty, caramel maltiness, and a crisp, hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is grainy, and the finish is dry and clean. Very drinkable and worth a try."
"This beer poured into the glass a copper/orange color, clear and well carbonated. The head was off white color with a thick creamy head. The lace was some-what present but only in patches. The aroma was of hops (floral, citrus), caramel malt, yeast (bread), dandelions, and some alcohol at the end. The taste was fairly similar to the smells it produced. There were tastes of hops, flowers, some citrus, bread/yeast, dandelions, and alcohol as well. It ended with a slight hop aftertaste, but not overbearing. It had a medium body that filled the mouth quite well. A good beer, that I rather enjoyed."
"A unique taste since I never had a altbier I wasn't quite sure what to expect. But I was pleasantly suprised. Toasted malts in the beginning that led to a nice dry hop finish."
"The color is a dark amber with an average head and a touch of lace.Gives a complex smell of hops and an earthy aroma.The taste reveals a very malty and medium body brew with hints of roasted grains.The finish is a bit smokey and very smooth.This beer is not to heavy and not to light and shows a good balance in all its characters.Not to harsh on the mouth with a bitter dry hoppy aftertaste.This is an excellent beer.Maybe the finest Ottercreek has ever offered."
"I had this beer after skiing once, goes great by the fire at night!"
"The beer pours pleasant translucent amber to copper color with a robust and frothy beige head that desiccates to sheets of fine lace. Malt nose, citrus, light sweetness with a start that is mostly malt, the top skinny, the finish purposefully hopped, astringent, dry long lasting aftertaste. A decent beer, but as with most beer from this brewery, just ""Average""."
"This beer poured a brownish amber color and formed a bubbly white head that left circular lace. It had some carbonation present. An aroma of malt, caramel and some hops. A flavor of malt and caramel which gave it a somewhat sweet finish."
"Not much in the way of appearance, but a very hoppy aroma tells you this one is going to be good. And the hops follow in the taste. A citrus flavor is also present, which mingles nicely with the hops. Crisp mouthfeel with a slight bitterness towards the end. Overall a smooth brew."
"hoppy aroma and then it slides down with a smooth malty taste blended superbly with some hops. this was one fine beer. it is one of the best i have had this summer. i really had no idea what this beer would be like, but it was very impressive and i will surely have it again"
"Approiate bright copper body. Micro bubbles rising to the head. Big white rocky foamy head. Nice lacing. Some floral hops strong in the aroma. Well balanced battle between hops and malt across the tongue and on through the aftertaste. Malt takes a sizeable lead, but there is a little hop bite at the very end. Goods down very easily. Good solid drinking beer, and would go easily with many foods. I had a couple with pizza and was quite happy."
"The 'copper' colour is ideal with a creamy white head that follows me down the glass.  A nice visual.  The smell does not impress me, although my particular sense of smell should not be considered.  Althought the brew is not particularly bitter, the unbalanced hops bite through.  This imbalance may lead to its great dryness. There is a mildy light body that borders on harsh is held too long. The big STRIKE of this beer is its after taste that is long and uncomfortable. Drink this one with some food and it will be a better experience.  Like the others say, it does grow on you.  Looks nice and is hoppy and dry, I dig it"
"Pours a nice pale copper color with a thick off white head that last to the bottom of the glass.  The smell is a caramel, complex malt aroma.  The first thing to hit your tongue is the malt, but it is quickly followed up by the many layered malt flavor.  The brew is creamy and dry and very drinkable.  This was a very unexpected but also a very excellent brew.  I agree with Thrasher, it definitely grows on you.  Every sip that I took made me like this beer more and more.  The dry characteristics are very different but very nice as well."
"This beer really grows on you. As it warms in the glass, it grows tastier and tastier. Nice lingering head, aromatic, and a taut balance of malts and hops. A familiar flavor that I can't identify, but in entirely new and exciting surroundings. Much more complex and interesting than your standard American ale. Fruity, robust, and satisfying. This is one beer where it really makes a difference if you drink it too cold. Maybe that's why some other reviewers didn't enjoy it as much. If you let it warm up a bit, the malts really shine."
"This brew is good though this style is not one of my favorites. Light amber with sweet malty, caramel and brown bread aroma. Sweetness again reappears on the taste buds with a slight hop finish. Not bad at all, in fact it's a nice changeup."
"Notes: Luscious! A beautiful interpretation of a German Alt beer. This is Otter Creek's flagship, and a New England classic."
