Personally I like a little more presence and bite, but this is a good well crafted easy on the mouth independently brewed beer.  The ABV was @ 5% and if I was to guess I would imagine this was the beer they brewed to introduce the masses to their line as it's a great spot on beer for just that.","ravisingh","Feb 25, 2015"

A touch of bitter about the same time the beverage reaches your stomach (I love that!).  While I appreciate that others have different expectations from an amber, this beer completely resonated with my pallet.  Will soon be pouring this into an iced mug to observe the rest of it behavior.","Larry_Moon","Nov 06, 2014"

The body has a nice fullness to it, a bite from the carbonation on the finish.  A solid alt-bier style ale.","delta490","Aug 17, 2014"

I absolutely love this beer, when, like I said, it is freezing cold. warmer not so much. a staple in my beer drinking for the last ten years or so.","StonedTrippin","Jun 29, 2013"

This is about as perfectly as I can sum up a standard, basic ale, that isn't bad (and is quite drinkable), but is otherwise unremarkable. It doesn't stand out to me in any way, other than the slightly out of place banana aroma and flavor. I absolutely wouldn't mind having one or two of these, but I won't go out of my way for it, or purchase it over a good lager or a better ale.","Roguer","Jun 05, 2013"

That said, as far as flagship ales for breweries like Long Trail go, Long Trail Ale is ahead of the pack if only in that it is unique. Rather than being a simple APA or IPA, Long Trail opted for a lesser-known, German altbier and, in Long Trail Ale, they have accomplished what they presumably intended--taking over the Vermont beer market, that is. I would never turn down a Long Trail Ale, even if I have been drinking less and less of it as time progresses.","BTVflatlander","May 13, 2013"

Color was a coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was both sweet and spicy, like malt coupled with pepper. Interesting. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was bittersweet, a pleasant marriage of malt and hops. Some great lacing began to appear as I drank through it. Finish was tending towards bitter, so I am going to call it dry or semi-dry. Either way, it should give you some idea of what to expect. Not bad, and I am curious as to why they are characterizing it as an ""Amber"" on the CAN.","woodychandler","Aug 06, 2012"

Sweet toffee and a hint of butter contrasted with apricot, spice, pepper and a light fruitiness. Medium body with a dry finish, moderate to high level of carbonation with a sweet almost syrupy bubbly mouthfeel. This used to be the beer I drank when I went skiing 15 years ago, but I haven't had it in years. Sometimes when you try to go back it only serves to disappoint.

Aromas of berry fruit sweetness, with a somewhat rich, toffee-like background. Flavors are rich and sweet, with the toffee character once again present, and a fruit blend not unlike a piece of fruitcake, with some nuttiness and sugary highlights. Very light in mouth, with a slick and substantial feel to it. The aftertaste is much like fruitcake as well...a bit of a letdown. The aftertaste is lighter than the initial palate, and the fruit characters and toffee-like body all get a tad bit watered down. The finish is light and crisp, without much of a linger. Very easy brew to drink, and not bad around a campfire.","GarthDanielson","Sep 25, 2011"

3.41,-3.9,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"12oz. bottle served in a stange. Pours a translucent copper with a 1.5 inch, bubbly/frothy, white head. Head eventually dissipates into a bubbly band - some spots and clumps of lacing present during the tasting. Nose is rather faint - just a suggestion of light, toasted malts and an earthy hops presence; perhaps a trace of caramel. Taste follows nose, with the addition of a delicate floral character that expresses itself towards the middle. A bit of diacetyl is also apparent in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with an even carbonation. A light acidity presents towards the start, and a slightly oily texture comes out towards the middle. I'm not overly familiar with the style, so it's difficult for me to make a style informed evaluation. That being said, I found the brew to be simple, well-balanced and easy drinking. Not something I would seek out on it's own, but a nice addition to a mix pack.","Jwale73","Dec 19, 2010"

Pretty clean aroma, with a nice maltiness that lends notes of buttery caramel and a touch of chocolate, backed by a light dosage of hops. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with wheat, caramel, and leafy, spicy, lightly earthy hops that lend a nice bitterness. The body is lightish, tingly, with a dry finish.

Dark amber to red-brown in color, very good clarity with active bubbles throughout. Sweet roast to the nose without malt domination, pine, fresh forest breeze, light dried honey, some salinity alongside hop, wheat, rye notes, texturally equally favors breadth and penetration. Light to medium-bodied, stronger carbonation keeps it active and adds to overall mouth presence. Sweeter here with oats, toffee, honey, never that malty though. Conversely, the hops, rye, pine, mineral water aspects incline things more towards truncated linearity. Seems intentionally watery, as in ""stream water freshness."" Granola and oats smooth out the finish further. Real easy drinker, friendly from the first sip to last.","farrago","Jan 29, 2009"

Thanks to this site, I learned of the style of the beer while sipping in a standard plastic sampler cup. Appeareance was partially cloudy light red with orange tints with an impressive dark tan head that laced even in the sampler cup and kept a full cap. The nose was gentle on the nose with toasted grains and small doses of hops. Taste follows the nose with the toasted aspect, but I sensed something different from what I've tried in the past and attribute to the style. It's mellow on all fronts by design Herbal essence through out and spiced clean and dry background.

Aroma is of toasted grain, some mild fruit, buttery diacetyl, and a medicinal presence like bandaids. Taste is an impreovement, with bits of grape, graham cracker, honey and pumpernickel bread. Feel is on the light side, bordering on medium. Long Trail has quite a session brew on their hands. I went through four while watching the Bruins get slaughtered by Montreal.

Aroma is faint, sweet malts, certainly an ale, nothing offensive but nothing groundbreaking. Certainly nothing was added (dry hop) to make this beer have a notable aroma, but that's cool in and of itself... Flavors are mellow like the aroma, mild both in malt and hop flavor. It's not too sweet like say, bass, which is good, so the hops, while gentle for an American beer, are still noticeable. This beer is bland cold, but when it warmed it revealed an interesting toastiness to compliment the gentle hops. The flavor was too weak when cold, and enjoyable but just shy of flavorful once warmed. Very approachable beer. MF is light, not watery on the tongue, but far from even medium bodied. Don't know much about altbiers, but as an amber ale it's very drinkable, but I probably wont stock it unless its for other people in hopes I can find better, though it's rather good.

The taste, however, was deliciously crisp. A solid balance: a smooth, malty taste right up front, which gave way to a earthy, piney, pleasantly bitter sting of hops that lingered on in the aftertaste.

Good balance of malt and hops, with trademark ale malt-sweetness present. The finish is clean as mentioned in previous reviews, and that's a good thing in the land of heavy amber ales. The ale yeast is adding a distinctive fruitiness. Somewhat over-carbonated, but that's true of most American ales (bottled anyway).

This is a light bodied lale eaning towards medium on the heartiness continuum. The smell is indistinct and inoffensive ... hardly an enticing descriptor. The taste is malty sweetness, some nutty flavors, perhaps a bit of molasss or caramel as well. The hops are quite subdued and this creates too much of a cloying taste that compromises its drinkability. I wouldn't call this a session beer, in part because of the too prevalent imbalances. The aftertaste is very light, the mouthfeel watery. This is a very middle of the road American ale produced by a medium sized Vermont brewery worth supporting.","albern","Aug 30, 2007"

Actually, as I'm thinking about it (and the ale in question warms up my stomach), I rather like that about it. The perfect compromise for the beer-drinker that likes a dark, local microbrew (this being a Vermont staple) but also appreciates the populist sessionability of, say, a Beck's or Heineken.","yourunclewalt","Aug 06, 2007"

An excellently subtle balance between toasty dry malt and restrained hops that carry on in a long dry finish that has some subtly spicy notes of cinnamon and allspice, even wood.

Clear malt with a buttery accent and a definitive hops scent hits your nose as you raise the glass and, when sampled, the flavor is both rich malt with a subtle sweetness that is at the same time just tart enough to keep you wanting more. Mouthfeel is rich enough to let you know it's a craft brew but thin enough (with just a touch of tingly carbonation) to make it oh so smooth. Excellent and very easy drinking with a (perfect?) aftertaste of bitter hops that make your mouth water in anticipation of the next swallow. Extremely true to the traditional German Altbier style but with a distinctly American edge that would likely appeal to a wide range of beer tastes if it were more widely distributed. A classic.

Tastes like an Amber ale with the pale malt characteristics going in and out. A good froth brings out a killer malt sweetness with the hops still holding their ground.

I can't talk about balance, as there was no real flavor interaction. The beer was basic, perhaps a bit thin and watery. It neither neither succeeded nor failed.

3.88,9.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"One of my standard favorites when I can get it tap-fresh up in VT: a good social brew and a good one to begin sessions with. This is an Altbier-styled brew similar to both the famous Düsseldorf Altstadt and Northern German varieties: Not quite the intensity of the city's, yet more bitter than most northern styles (I would not label this beer simply a ""moderately bitter brown ale"" by the German standard, but might be so inclined by American ones). Not sure how much Munich malt is involved, or whether they lay-down the ale for a period of maturity, but when I drink this, I do not necessarily relate it in my head to an Altbier. Just great-tasting enjoyment.","Hobbz","Dec 05, 2003"

It pours a deep amber-brown with a touch of clouding in the glass. This ale's white head doesn't last long over your pint. It smells of bittersweet toffee and/or caramel (I couldn't really pin it down). LT Ale starts crisp, flavorful, and smooth. It is full bodied with dominant wheat and oat flavors. There are several suggestions of both sweet and bitter flavors present in each mouthful. It finishes cool, crisp, clean, and most pleasantly.
