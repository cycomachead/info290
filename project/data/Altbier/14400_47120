I've gotten out of the habit of buying Ninkasi, but this was leftover from a six pack that my son in law had bought, so I'm glad he left it!

Slight metallics really linger in the aftertaste.","orcrist_cleaver","Nov 15, 2014"

It has the beginings of what might have been dark fruit but it was forbidden. So tempting with it's sweetness and rich scents.  Perfect clarity form this beer. It glows softly from within to sport those garnet hues like a hidden gem deep within the beer.  Malt is rich and extends beyond the beers  time on the palate.  it seems to go on forever. It has a dry crispness in and of itself  it has a bit of bitterness in the finish.  caramel is laid under the dry malt. it's as though the heartier aspects wanted to be up front and so they stayed there.  It has a medium mouthfeel  and it is appropriately thin on the palate. It is not weighted down or heavy even though the malt is substantial.  it finishes dry and with that bitterness that is a bit of a surprise but it makes you smile. The richness has abated for a moment, like it's toying with you. This is a lovely altbier and I think it's one of the best american alts I have had.  It's clean and crisp.

4.25,13,,,,,,"Poured a clear, deep brown body with reddish tint when held to light and a one finger bubbly off-white head. A very nice looking, true to form altbier. Scents of rich, sweet malt, light fruity esters reminiscent of apple and grape and a medium level of Noble hop perfume, floral and spicy, especially pepper, aromas. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic, very well executed Dusseldorf Altbier that hits the style exactly. Extremely well done. Flavor begins moderately bitter with a floral and perfume-like Noble hop presence evident, a light fruitiness that matches the aroma and a medium-light level of sweet malt. This moves into a middle with the same Noble hop character, but adds a more pronounced and complex malt flavor that is sweet and slightly bready in character. Fruity ester flavors are still present, still light and still apple with a bit of grape. Finish is medium-dry with a moderate Noble hop character and prominent hop bitterness, light fruity esters of apple, light toasted malt and nuttiness and a clean finish. Aftertaste is moderately bitter with a medium-light presence of sweet, bready, grainy and biscuity malt flavors. Overall impression of flavor is of a nicely done Dusseldorf Altbier that trends towards the bitter end of the style, yet fits it quite nicely. Well executed and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of an excellent and true to form Dusseldorf Altbier. Overall this is a good Altbier. It is very true to style and pleasant in aroma, flavor and mouthfeel. It is a nicely done, aromatic, flavorful ale and quite nice.","Auraan","0"

3.66,-2.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"On the brewery's website it mentions this has an IBU of 50. So I was a bit confused because the draft form of this I had was a chocolate malt bomb that had bitter chocolate flavor and no hop bitterness. However it was not a bitterness I would rate at 50. It pours a very dark brown, almost black, as the label indicates. It formed a white head, which indicated that this was not as dense or containing as much roasty tones of a stout but was going to be an interesting experience. When I smelled it, it really did not have much of a scent due to it just being taken out of the fridge. But there was a bit of that dark malt scent. After the first taste, you get that maltiness up front and through the rest of the sip. There are no hops but was a bit disappointed that the chocolatey malts I got on draft was not in the bottle. It was kind of subtle. So this is totally a draft beer for sure. The mouthfeel was medium and the carbonation was the way you would want it. Overall, I gave this a 4 because its a solid beer but get it on draft. Its a much more pleasant experience.","Vancoubeer","Dec 22, 2011"

It poured with a lovely brown head, with the aroma of bourbon. Great mouth feel lots of maltiness from the bourbon and simple hopping and generous use of Munich and Vienna malts , a true double alt.

Fairly full bodied with a nice, round mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Good drinkability for 7.2abv. The nutty taste of the roasted malt prevails all the way through to the finish. The bitterness that comes from the hops doesn't really complement the rest of the flavor profile. I don't think the style needs this much hop bitterness.

There's definitely a nice pine malt/hop bitterness to it that seems to be the main theme of this drink. Notes of pine and annis are definitely in your face. I've had a cookie that resembles the flavor of this beer. The mouthfeel is smooth and is easy to drink. The herbal notes are definitely not bad, but I think after one of these bottles, I'm good for a week or two. This is my third bottle in two months.

4.18,11.2,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"D: Very smooth and drinkable and as stated the abv goes unnoticed and the hops make it refreshingly crisp. Very well done Ninkasi. This is a solid altbier and very representative of the style, just wish it had a little more uniqueness for a winter beer, but can't fault it for style points.","RedBrewer83","Nov 12, 2009"
