Kind of like a dry stout, though maybe just a touch lighter in malty character (though still very roast-heavy). Nothing spectacular, but certainly not bad.","tectactoe","Jul 13, 2013"

2.68,-23.4,4.5,4,2,1.5,2.5,"Overall this was a pretty dull beer that I wasn't impressed with. I liked the look and aroma of this beer but after that everything pretty much went down hill. There wasn't much going on in the flavor darpartment and what was there was pretty subdued. What I liked the least about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was a mess, it was too watery and way over carbonated. I wasn't digging this brew and I don't think I would ever buy it again. I have very little experience with this style with this being first Altbier I have knowingly drank, but this beer just didn't do it for me. I can't say I would recommend this beer to people, its just too out of whack and needs lots of work. I am starting to think Arbor brewing's beers are hit or miss for me, with the misses being the majority, but I am not ready to write them off just yet.","StoutHunter","Jun 20, 2011"
3.7,5.7,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a dark brown hat is nearly opaque win a nice off white head. Some lacing. Nose brings a bit of sweet malt that consists of darker chocolate, bringing some dryness as well. Taste and feel come together with a nice dry malt characteristic. The taste is a bit plain wihout much more than some grain and faint flavors behind it, but I like the feel. Drinks well and shows me yet again why I wish this were a more common style.","Thorpe429","Oct 12, 2010"
3.53,0.9,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"A slightly musty aroma of hops and yeast is discernible. Full pour produces a light brown head that quickly dissipates. The flavor is hoppy on the front of the palate with not much follow through. A Dark brown color, it is somewhat thin in the mouth but well carbonated, more hoppy than malty. An unexceptional but very drinkable session beer.","tubacharlie","Aug 28, 2010"

3.65,4.3,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability: Not really sure I dig these flavors as of yet. The bitterness is nice, but a little too present and doesn't bring enough flavor along with it.","bamadog","Mar 29, 2010"
2.08,-40.6,2.5,2,2,2.5,2,"An incredibly massive head. I poured the bottle into a pint glass and it's literally all dense tan head with about a half inch of beer at the bottom of the glass. It's annoying because I want to drink it. I can still smell it, though, and it smells like smokey burnt raisins and burnt carmel. Tastes as it smells but with a mediocre sour aftertaste that I don't really care for. Did I get a bad bottle? Upon second sniff I can detect the sourness in the aroma also. I just lowered the ratings from 3 to 2 in both those categories. The texture is a little watery and too carbonated. I'm disappointed in this beer... But what do you expect from something that comes from Ann Arbor. Go State.","berserker256","Mar 24, 2010"

2.61,-25.4,4,3,2,2.5,3,"Very nice appearance, but looks can be deceiving. Smell is faint; a little sweetness and maybe a hint of Riesling. I'm dumbfounded at the lack of flavor considering the appearance and smell. Nothing really offensive to the taste, but quite bland. Very little maltiness, a tiny hint of fruit sweetness, but mostly with high carbonation I could almost mistake this for club soda--very watery. Moderately light, if you had no desire for flavor you could drink a few of these, but I'm afraid I'd die of boredom first.","KBomb","Mar 24, 2009"
2.51,-28.3,4,3,2,2.5,2.5,"Starts off well enough, with some dark fruit flavors and toasted chocolates. But there's a smoky flavor lingering there that doesn't do it to me. It's more "ash-tray" than it is "campfire". There's not much to balance it out in the end and comes up feeling flat.","ElGrecoVerde","Feb 13, 2009"
3.74,6.9,4.5,3,4,3.5,4,"12 oz bottle. Rather opaque black pour into the tulip. Huge off white head, had to pour and wait a couple times. Burnt malt and toast aromas, but rather light. Lively mouthfeel, light medium body. Burnt malt taste with hints of dark chocolate. Subdued hop presence. Very, very clean, but maybe just a bit overcarbonated. If not for the carbonation I would say this is extreamly drinkable, but as such is just good drinkability. A very interesting and unique alt.","Bung","Jan 24, 2009"

3.11,-11.1,4,3,3,3.5,3,"This is a dark brown alt, but I guess it doesn't always have to be amber-colored. The aroma and flavor were both a bit disappointing. I just pulled a deep caramel sweetness, without much other complexity. The body was balanced and drinkable, but the flavor wasn't compelling enough to try this again.","tempest","Aug 26, 2008"
4,14.3,4,4,4,4,4,"My first altbier. Poured a very dark, chocolatey brown with a thick tan head. Smells strongly of a pleasant maltiness with perhaps some sort of slight smokiness or chocolatey. The flavor is a great combination of chocolate and malt. It's moderately carbonated and medium-bodied. A quite enjoyable beer that I would definitely recommend--and I would now also like to try it on tap!","jeremyd365","Aug 10, 2008"
3.68,5.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Found this to be a great little beer for a summertime cooler. Was a little surprised how cold it was served on tap (at several different locations).

Very drinkable with a modest alcohol content.","skiboy","Jul 21, 2008"

3.31,-5.4,4,3,3,3.5,4,"Dark brown pour, not much head, not much nose, but deep malt, that is what this style is mostly about, eh? Thanks to Hophobo for providing it as an extra, not much depth, but a nice solid brew. Not sweet, no hops, just solid malt, good mouthfeel and very drinkable, just not one to seek out unless all you see are macros around, probably only around Ann Arbor/Detroit, nice but move on.","robbyc1","Apr 26, 2008"
2.83,-19.1,3.5,3,2.5,3,3,"I picked this up in Detroit a couple weeks ago, and it's been chilling on deck for about a week. I poured it into a Sam Adams glass, and it filled to the top with poofy tan foam. The liquid itself was very dark, mush darker than other alts I've tried. The aroma was off in my opinion, a little fruity and a little acidy-sour. Same with the taste, it had some off-flavors I didn't think matched the beer style. I won't try it again.","TurdFurgison","Mar 14, 2008"

Smell is neat, iron, caramel, roast, chocolate, bit of coffee, very clean aroma, maybe too clean, some bread, dark fruits, interesting. Taste is kind of bland and watery, some caramel and chocolate, bread, roast coffee, not much else, but a bit buttery. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, pretty smooth. Easy to drink but the flavour dies. Thanks Lexx!","Viggo","Jan 15, 2008"

3.39,-3.1,4.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a dark brown with an excellent light tan head that billows and floats for minutes. Nose is mild, some light spiciness and sweet malt. Flavor is interesting. Surprisingly sour; this is my first alt, but there wasn't anything in the description about sourness. In any case, there's a fair bit of roasted molasses, light astringency, some light fruit. Fairly well balanced in terms of malt and hops. Feel is alright, medium body, maybe a little light on the carbonation. This one isn't bad, although it's the first alt I've had, so I don't really have a lot to compare it to. The sourness was a bit of a surprise, but overall, it's drinkable.","soupyman10","Aug 23, 2007"

1.34,-61.7,5,1,1,2,1,"What is it with breweries in Ann Arbor? Frog Island, Leopold Brothers, and this brewery all have nasty infected products. Don't the brewers drink what they sell?

3.01,-14,3.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"No aroma, little dots in the head. Some bitterness and decent for the style, but not the best I have had. A tad of chocolate malt, smoke,saaz like carbonation. Bit lemon and acid in the finish and on aftertaste. Quaffable though didn't all work out on this batch.","Sammy","Jan 27, 2007"
3.58,2.3,4,3.5,4,3,3,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 5" of medium brown head over the 1/2" of very cloudy dark brown brew. There will have to be some patience involved with drinking this brew. Huge frothy head fades WAY slowly, I went away and came back later, left monumental amounts of lacing. Aroma is nutty medium to dark malts. Taste is also medium malts upfront, with an increasing amount of hops as time passes. Mouthfeel is still a bit gassy, but overall not bad, and drinkability is pretty good, once you can finally drink it. This one was satisfying is some areas, kind of lacking in others, but has some nice potential.","ppoitras","Jan 03, 2007"
3.26,-6.9,4,3,3,3,4,"This Arbor beer is a nice session brew. I like the roasted aspects of 22, but it isn't flawless. Try it with some ribs or brisket.","frazbri","Jan 02, 2007"
3.6,2.9,3,3,4,3,4,"Originally reviewed on January 18, 2006. On tap at the brewpub. Dark clear brown burnt, with orange fringes and light rim of off-white. Light euro hop aroma. Effervescent, with toothy chewy grains, deliciopus horse blanket and some earth. Grains, oats and more pungent hops. Well balanced and lucious. Palate is smooth, airy and glowing. Finish is sweet. A light sour lemon at the end. Exemplary for the style.","CharlesDarwin","Dec 05, 2006"
3.48,-0.6,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This is a pretty dependable happy hour beer for me at the A.B.C. Not the most bold or challenging, but usually pleasant nonetheless. Pours a dark brown, almost black color, with a full tannish head. Smells of malt, with hints of roast toffee and chocolate. Tastes like roasted malt, chocolate. There is a good deal of sweetness. Not terribly full though. In the mouth the malt presence is decent, but overall it's a bit watery. Again, this is a pretty nice beer. Nothing too complex. Easy to drink, but nothing to knock your socks off.","macpapi","Apr 06, 2006"

2.87,-18,2.5,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Dark brown, nearly opaque beer topped by a thin ring of tan coloured head. Flavour and aroma were intensely malty, some toffee, with very little hop presence. Mild bitterness and a relatively clean yeast character with a bit of dark fruitiness. Some residual sweetness with a short, malty finish. Medium bodied with low carbonation and a slightly sweet, sticky texture.","DrJay","Jun 16, 2005"
4.24,21.1,3,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Damn easy to drink, not too filling, and tasty with a thirst quenching flavor. Succeeds despite lacking many of the roasty/caramel flavors and truly strong hop notes that I typically associate with the style. Smooth, slightly sweet, and crisp, regardless. Drinks almost like a super-dark Scottish ale.","nomad","Aug 11, 2004"
4.18,19.4,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Thank you to trbeer for splitting a pint of this one with us. A very good altbier with a very intersting porter characteristic to it, and absolutely something I'd hope to have when I make it up this way again!","beergeek279","Jul 24, 2004"

3.8,8.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"One of my favorites at ABC. At 5% ABV, it's a comfortable, pleasing drinking companion. But it's tasty without being distracting, that's why I love the Alt. Pours a dark chestnut brown with a modest edge-wise head (which nonetheless lasts and lasts). Subtle aroma like roasted barley and malt; you begin with great tongue- and throat- tickling hops and perfect--yes perfect--carbonation which ensures that the malt and barley don't come close to suggesting other genres such as porter, stout, or dopplebock. No, the hops/carbonation balances this beer that rounds out a finish with malt, roasted barley, and a hint of caramel that while smooth, refuses to suggest any sweetness or heavy-handed microbrewing flavor over-kills. A really fine, I'd even venture elegant, beer.","marcellaproust","Apr 26, 2004"
4.62,32,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"I love this beer. Even some German altbiers are a little too straight-up malty. But not this one. Definite some roasty malts in there but also some toffee-ish, coffee, chocolate flavors. It's like a damn Starbucks drink -- the toffee cafe choco mocha nut brown beer. Fortunately, you don't need one of those little cardboard things since this is served much colder than coffee -- but just right at just-less-than-cellar temperature. Nice brown color too. Like a very dark chocolate bar. Served in a nice 500mL German mug -- except that they generally overfill it a bit so you get a bit more than your 500mL.","marburg","Mar 07, 2003"
4.38,25.1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This deep dark altbier is the best I have had outside of the actual German beers.

The extra medium body is creamy on the palate and extremely enjoyable.","beernut7","Jul 26, 2002"
