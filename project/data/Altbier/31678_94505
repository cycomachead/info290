The surprisingly crisp and light mouthfeel combine with just enough hop character to balance the sweetness.  Perfect sessionable beer for those cool summer nights.","adapt313","Saturday at 11:10 AM"

2.84,-22,3,3.25,2.5,3.25,2.75,"Had this poured from a bottle at FIG in downtown Charleston, then subsequently returned the glass after about 3 or 4 sips and went back to the Revelry Crosstown Brown that I was drinking on tap. In the short time that my wife and I sampled the beer, there was plenty of opportunity to get an objective rating and experience. The beer was poured without so much as a suggestion of a head. No froth, foam or suds to be seen. It was a deep, roasty brown (in dim bar lighting) with decent clarity. The aroma was somewhat complex, with a sweet honey-like aroma, a little faint roasted nuttiness and an off sour vinegar scent. The flavor followed suit, imitating a toasty American brown ale, but with the addition of a peculiar green olive flourish.  I can't say if this is the desired flavor profile, or if this bottle was spoiled. The mouthfeel was pretty average. Adequate body and carbonation, so it didn't really stand out one way or the other. Minus the strange vinegar-like sour notes it would have passed as a mild brown ale, but I was simply unable to get past that odd quality. In reading other reviews, I've heard this beer described in so many different ways, it's a wonder that we are all drinking the same beer. Is it a matter of bottling or production consistency? Or is the beer that much of an enigma as to produce such vastly ranging descriptions? Hopped Porter, Stout, bubbly Scotch Ale, American Brown? These are all seemingly contradictory descriptions that you'll find here. Perhaps I would try this again, just to confirm whether the first bottle I had was off or not. At it's best, I doubt this is going to move the needle much either way.","JohnnyI","Jan 18, 2015"

3.68,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, dark bread, honey, molasses, chocolate, light nuttiness, pear, apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, dark bread, honey, molasses, chocolate, light nuttiness, pear, apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, dark bread, honey, molasses, chocolate, light nuttiness, pear, apple, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice altbier style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Jan 09, 2015"

It had a soapy smell and bubbly taste on account of the carbonation.  It got slightly better after it settled and warmed slightly - the honey and molasses taste came out a bit that made me think it tasted more like a bubbly Scotch Ale.

3.91,7.4,3.5,3.75,4,4,4,"very cool recipe here in a surprising beer. a honey and molasses dark beer thats heavy on the oats. i expected a sugar bomb and got a remarkably dry and full flavored beer that seems more appropriate for autumn than late spring. dark amber to light brown in color, some viscosity here, and not a ton of head, creamy and lazy looking. the nose is the unrefined sugar element of the molasses, a nice rich grain bill that ranges from medium crystal malt to chocolate malt and the buttery dry freshness of rolled oats. hops appear minimal in the nose. the flavor is great, i get the honey on the front end, the essence of the bee, the pollen and the flower, with much of the sweetness being fermented out. perfect grain profile for that flavor too, its just right. more molasses in the finish with a light spice and a very sturdy base in terms of body. a really dialed in and clever recipe, i hope this is around in the fall when the leaves start to turn, it has that hunker down and cozy in type of vibe without being a barrel aged enormous beer. i super dig this.","StonedTrippin","May 16, 2014"

It's really just a smattering of bubbles and even those fade away after a minutes. The aroma has a grapey malt sweetness to it. Some deeper sweetness, molasses and caramel, is also fairly strong. Maybe, a touch of honey, but that's always hard to find in beer. Fairly nutty. Mild cocoa. I'd bet the molasses contributed a good bit of color because there isn't a ton of darker malt flavor. It's definitely more toasty, and lightly so at that, than roasty. The taste is similar, though there's a piney hop note and almost cinnamon-y spice flavor. Mild mint, too. It's fairly sweet, almost cloying for a ~5% abv beer. The mouthfeel is fairly full. Those oats give it some body. It's actually more altbier-ish than I'd expected. Regardless, it's tasty enough and they packed in a good amount of flavor for the abv, but it's just not all that enjoyable. A bit too much sweetness without really committing to that idea.","popery","Apr 07, 2014"

I am not too familiar with lagers, but the lager yeast wasn’t too prominent over the malts, which I really enjoyed. Recommended to all fans of malty lagers. Enjoyed while several ounces of snow accumulated outside my door.","CowsandBeer","Feb 01, 2014"

Heavy on roasted malts, with light honey notes shining throughout. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is moderate with light carbonation. Overall, a nice take on the style.

3.85,5.8,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,"Pours a dark amber capped by a cream colored one and half finger head; nice-looking beer. Average retention, little to no lacing. Molasses, hints of maple syrup, and plenty grain on the nose. Caramel, toffee, and grainy accents upfront. Subtle notes of apple peel, pear, and honey midpalate that carry through to the finish. Hints of sweetness throughout, but very well balanced. Slick medium body with syrupy accents on the edges. A very enjoyable and very drinkable beer that I enjoyed very much and plan to revisit.","chanokokoro","Nov 28, 2013"

In other words, I could easily drink a six pack of this in a couple of hours, and I think that’s part of Off Color’s intention; it’s an easily crushable brew. Smells sweet and malty, touch of honey. Clear dark brown with a red tinge, but not approaching black. I love how it tastes, sweet up front but not cloying. Pleasant dry finish. Elegant, you might say. Palate is slightly creamy behind the up-front tingly carbonation. The overall effect is greater than the sum of its parts. I love it. BONUS: This is now in 12oz bottles in six-packs. A $9.99 per six-pack beer made by great local brewers? I was getting worried Chicago's new craft beers only came in $10 bombers, Half Acre being the exception. So, thank you, thank you, thank you, Off Color.","gregdafdxguy","Nov 07, 2013"

This stuff pours a slightly-murky sienna topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises dry barley, mixed nuts, dried maple syrup, and a hint of oatmeal-raisin cookie. The taste brings in more of the same, though things are dominated by a toasty syrup-coated nut flavor that doesn't sit all that well with my tastebuds. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta slick feel. Overall, I wasn't the biggest fan of this beer. It was nice to try a style that's nearly extinct, but this one just tasted a bit too strange for me. Still, a solid way to end a crazy night...","TMoney2591","Jul 17, 2013"
