It smells fantastic; all the rich malty notes from quality dark european beers like toffee, raisin, molasses, etc. The taste follows the aroma but it's just too sweet for me to drink the whole bottle. Mouthfeel is full, a little syrupy. Sweetness lingers after the swallow. So although I couldnt finish the bottle because the sweetness was a bit cloying, I can tell its well made, and is what it is, really. I can others enjoying it if you have a sweet tooth. I imagine it would go well with game meat.","jbertsch","Feb 10, 2015"

The aroma offers deep caramel maple malt with a subtle grassy edge. Maybe a little chocolate licorice to boot. Nice. The flavor climaxes with an intense sweet licorice malt and more grassy hops. There's a bit of rhubarb tartness and deep root beer flavor. It is a little sweeter than I normally like but it's tolerable as you enjoy the combined flavors. It finishes a bit harsh at the back of the palate with a modest carbonation and a smooth feel from this medium bodied brew. I would say that there's a cloying quality here that interferes with the enjoyment but they get kudos for big flavor.","Durge","Mar 20, 2014"

I was less inclined to say meat, and more maybe just smoke. I guess I can see some beef jerky going on here, but its not pervasive. long sweet finish. the feel is as full bodied as they come, and the carbonation is decent, but hardly lightens the texture up at all. this is a bomb, a bottle to be shared, and one of the more unique german beers ive encountered. not sure ill rush to find one again, but I enjoyed the experience and thought process involved here.","StonedTrippin","May 10, 2013"

The beer is mostly opaque, but there is some light visible along the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates, leaving a thin cap of lace atop the beer. The beer smells of dark roasted malt, toffee, plum, and raisin. It's a very rich and inviting aroma. Like their standard alt, the beer has more hop notes than you would expect just from the nose. There's a strong bready malt backbone with some toffee sweetness, plum, and raisin. There's some earthy and woody hop notes in this beer that come through rather well to balance everything out and provides some satisfying back end bitterness. I can't taste the 8.5% ABV because it is masked very well. The body is full with moderate carbonation. The beer goes down smoothly and has a dry finish.

Excellent presentation, both the head and aroma are very nice. Medium to heavy bodied, strong malt, toasted malts and dark fruits up front. Middle and finish with a tannic, bitter malt flavor.

Although resembling a sweet fruity doppel(sticke), this had some qualities akin to what reminded me of a similar English Barleywine (call me crazy!). Taste has more dark fruits, figs and dates. Still lightly sugary, bready and malty as heck. Rich dark toffee and caramel, with a ton of herbal and spicy hop notes in the finish (producing the same dryness and bitterness as the others). No real alcohol on the palate, with a full and dense body. Sweet with a very low carbonation, that's a shade or two off of being flat.

It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. It was very well balanced despite having quite a bit going on. The aroma was not very strong but was still quite good after you worked to find it.

Its a difficult combination of flavors but it keeps me drinking. The spice is followed by a short and really bright round flavor that if it lasted any longer would be unpleasant but it is cut short by the back of the mouth dryness.

I tasted lots of caramel malt and toffee first, then dark fruit sweetness especially of golden raisins and figs, followed by alcohol heat, yeast and wheat with a semi-bitter, hoppy finish. Though it started sweet the elements at the end really balanced it out beautifully. The mouthfeel was silky, the carbonation delicate but not at all flat and the body medium/full. This beer really felt luxurious and the 8.5% was well blended into the complex flavors. I have no problem saying it; I think this is the best Altbier I have ever had and definitely one of if not THE best in the world.","thekevlarkid","Feb 16, 2009"

Retention and lacing were minimal though. Smell was strong of caramel and raisin, with a bit of alcohol. Taste was complex, but this was a malt bomb if you ask me. When it was cooler I did notice a slight bitterness, but as it waremed it was all caramel malt with some sweetness, some dark fruit, and some toasted grain. Mouuthfeel was fine, medium-ish or so, reminded me a little of a Dopplebock. Overall a good beer, definitely a slow sipper.

4.22,2.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"I really liked this funny little beer, this Doppelsticke (fun name, to boot). It's like a cross between an english barleywine (Nils Oscar comes to mind as I tried it recently) and a doppelbock (think Korbinian), very sweet, doughy, malt but with a ton of fruity tang and a mildly sticky feel. The flavor is mostly sweet doughy malt. It has a vinous and near-brandy quality. It's not as rich as a straight malt bomb. There is a much more delicate quality, particularly in a fruity yeast, ripe plums and bananas, and mineral to earthy hops. I guess there are probably sweet notes of caramel and chocolate lurking, but the sweetness comes through more in a barleywine flavor than most highly malty styles. The beer is a bit sticky sweet. Don't get me wrong. I certainly wouldn't recommend this as a session beer. In fact, it may be getting more difficult to drink as I go through the bottle. It's a lot of sweetness. That said, I would very much enjoy having a case of these to open whenever I was in the mood. Doppelsticke is a funny beer, and I may rarely be in the mood for it, but it's excellent in certain circumstances. Also, it does not seem to fulfill the characteristics of the style, but I imagine the brewery is aware of this fact and doesn't mind being somewhat unique. Also, the bottle is wonderfully, almost clichédly, German.","popery","Dec 18, 2008"

I found the taste very interesting, in fact I was not aware that the drink is an altbier, I thought it was a fruity variation on a dopplebock (the appearance and word 'dopplesticke' probably encourages this idea as well.) the malt sweetness was subtle but present with a hint of espresso.

The aftertaste lingers with strong malty notes. The flavour note as strong as it should be with the malts faded, the esters weak. The taste showcased alot of exotic fruit notes (like coconut) but oddly left your mouth feeling quite dry. This was alright, but I'm sure alot was lost with age.

Some alcohol warming present, although alcohol flavor is almost non-existent (impressively). A nice and surprising creamy mouthfeel.

Taste is roasted malt, more raisins, with a semi-dry finish - hops are evident in this beer, but there is a ton of malt as well. Amazingly balanced. Almost a coffee like aftertaste. Medium to full body. So drinkable; I wish this beer were more available. My previous exposure to this style was Long Trail Double Bag. While I love that beer still, this one blows it away.

The body of the beer is a ruddy, dusky brown and holds creamy tan head that is about the thickness of a standard Bic pen. The fore is a rich and sweet (low-spice) fruitcake. Baked Pineapple accents here as well. More caramel flavor than aroma...rich sweet and malty with caramel through the middle.

This is certainly the smell of a big, complex beer, but it also has a sense of well-crafted refinement: all of the aromas fit together perfectly. The taste is similar, complex with a lot of sweetness and malt flavorsmolasses again, a little toffee, caramel, ripe fruit, and a modest warming.

Sweet to start, caramel and fruit (apple and raisin) follow quickly along with breadiness, then bitterness and alcohol warmth carry into the finish. Refined texture with a full body and well integrated, fine carbonation, though the low carbonation levels leave it feeling just a bit dull. This left a really good impression.

I really enjoy it, but it is really in a different class from its traditional cousins. This beer is better aged to enhance the drinkability, but there is so much alcohol here, it makes the whole experience a lot different. This is not necessarily a beer for someone who likes Alts like myself, but more for someone that would like a German Barley Wineif there was such a thing. The hops are such a big player that it really doesnt fit in any other category.

4.62,12.1,4,4.5,4.5,5,5,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2" light tan head over a somewhat murky dark amber/light brown brew. Head fades rather quickly, with spotty delicate lacing. Aroma is sweet grains and fruit. Taste is slight vinous, with dark fruits, yet malt still evident throughout, and a light alcoholic close and warming. Flows tremendously easy over the tongue, and drinkability is also excellent, especially for something with a higher abv. Won't be sorry here.","ppoitras","Dec 25, 2005"

Wow, the aroma is concentrated and malty with notes of molasses and dark, sweet cake-like notes. There is a hint of cocoa powder, and even something resembling cinnamon. The taste is quite sweet and malty up front, yet it has a spicy hoppiness to it as well. The finish is dry in a sort of cocoa powder way, but some of the malty, toffee-like sweetness lingers on the palate and tongue even after swallowing this beer. This beer is quite rich and concentrated, definitely of bock strength. This almost reminds me of rich, dark German cake or sweetbread that has been lightly spiced. This beer has that characteristic fresh Alt hoppiness that no Bock would have; herbal with even a hint of citrus fruit. This is quite nice and flavorful.","Gueuzedude","Beers"

Aroma is heavy on tangy yeast, with spicy hops, sweet caramel malt, raisin, and dark sugar accented by a significant alcohol presence. Palate is dominated by roasted caramel malt, accompanied by notes of raisins, nuts, brown sugar, and the slightest tinge of hops. Finish is slightly sweet with some warming alcohol.

The figs and dates seem to blend together very well. It took me some time to identify these flavors because the malt is so dominant both in the taste and the aftertaste.

Pours a beautiful dark cherry laced brown with two fingers of a beige head settling to a nicely retained cap that leaves quite a bit of lacing. Big sweet aroma--brown sugar, molasses, dark berries--with a solid dose of floral hops in there as well. Taste starts out with a caramal maltiness, some fruit flavors like plum, cherry, and raisin coming through briefly, before a fairly big assault of grassy hops hit---leaving a slightly lingering bitterness which mixes with the alcohol taste as the beer warms. Mouthfeel on this one is somewhat creamy, and dispite the big sweetness, isn't at all syrupy. This is an interesting and complex beer--kind of the barley wine of alts, but in the end it's a little much for me and I'd prefer one of Uerige's other versions.","cubedbee","Aug 12, 2005"

There is a definite hoppiness going on as well that adds interestingly to the overall aroma. The flavor starts with the same big burst of sticky sweet fruits. A good bit of toasty malts are there as is earthy hops notes. There are some Alt characteristics going on but they are definitely not the focus. Very barleywine like in its overall flavor. A good amount of bitter fruit rounds this out. Pretty thick and sticky this coats with flavor. Damn drinkable as well. A 750 would have been nice. An interesting beer that has some Doppelbock and some Barley wine things going on. Highly recommended.","meathookjones","Beers"

A mild yet crisp hop bitterness leads you towards the end, where you'll find yourself hit with a bit of carbonation and a massive wallop of malty goodness. Cripes! I didn't expect this to be this good. And the mouthfeel...so smooth and velvety. Perfection on that. Slightly warming from the alcohol, but it's hidden well.

A mild bitterness joins the party at the end supressing the sweetness in the finish. Mouthfeel is soft and full, but not to the point of thick.

Its not bitter, but flavorful and light on the finish. There is a healthy toasted nut flavor, but its not as intense as the nose at all. The feel is thick, with a light carbonation.
