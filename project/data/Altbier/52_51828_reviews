"Got in a BIF from ZebraCakez. 22 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, bottled in 11/2014. Pours slightly hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light caramel, light pear/apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light caramel, light pear/apple, herbal, floral, grass, light pine, and herbal/toasted earthiness. Light amount herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of toast, biscuit, nuttiness, light caramel, floral, grass, light pine, light pear/apple, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 5%. Overall this is a very good altbier style. All around good robustness and balance of bready malt, earthy hops, and light yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. This is hoppy for an altbier, but the flavors were very much what I expected for the style. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"O: This is a very well balanced beer, getting through the bomber solo is almost too easy. More proof that local is the way to go."

"Overall this is a great offering from Buzzards Bay Brewing. I like that it isn't one of their more hop forward, less malty, beers. It does have a great caramel malty taste, and it is very clean and easy drinking. Bring this beer to your next fall gathering and pair it with some sausages!"

"Atmosphere okay. Slight head, plenty of effervescence, and some fair lacing. Nose is nutty, maple-y, and a synthetic sweetness. Bitter nut shells. Overall, this is an okay quaff."

"O: Definitely one of the hoppiest altbiers that I have ever experienced and different than the ones I had in Düsseldorf. I found it to be an Americanized version of the style and enjoyable. Pretty easy to drink."

"O: This beer definitely tastes like an American-influenced version of an altbier as it's a little more hoppier compared to the types of beers brewed in Düsseldorf."
""

"Overall: Pass the harpoon--or a Harpoon....the bottle's simple image fascinated me into a purchase, but this pale ale pales to much meatier, mellower, enjoyable brews...."
""
"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, and citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is an average beer that is drinkable but pretty boring for the style."
""
"Yes, I recommend."

"I really really liked this one (although I had it after a 1/2 marathon race so I was really thirsty)! The flavor feminded me of toasted nuts kissed with mild sweetness and was really nice to drink. It was perfect with the smoky flavors of the sandwich I ordered."

"O- The harsh and rough taste is hard to get through, with the husky flavor and hops only coming through as a bitter bite."

"Very drinkable. This beer made for a great hot day on the lake."
"Overall: Bought this not knowing anything about it and boy I was satisfied. It is rich and would satisfy most if not all palates. Salud!"
"Overall a tasty and well balanced ale. As much an ESB as an APA in my opinion. Very quaffable."

"I love malty pale ales and this is definately one of the better ones. Highly recommended. Nice job by this new brewery."

"Cheers!"

"22oz bottle. Label is not fancy but I found the beer to be a nice Amber color and head that lasted for a while. The smell was a typical pale ale and taste was right on. This American Pale Ale went down easy and my friends were impressed with the beer. Would recommend this my friends."
"Just a bit too much tart and unbalanced bitterness going on for me to rank higher."
"Recommended for something sessionable. Lots of flavor here for a 5% APA, and $2.99 a bomber, it’s one of the best deals around these parts."
"Awesome. Definitely THE goto session beer when its fresh. Which seems to be often. Sometimes called an ""American Mild", it is extremely drinkable."
"This is a solid APA that would be a great session beer, but that's because it's so inoffensive. There just isn't alot going on with this one. But it's damn easy to drink."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1 1/4"" beige head over the clear copper brew. Frothy head lasts well, with sporadic chunky lacing. Aroma is lightly piney, with a sour tinge to it. Taste is sweet upfront, citrus tart in the middle, and closes with a bitter bite. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is okay. Wish the flavor worked better for me."
"22oz. bomber served in my SA Perfect Pint. Poured a translucent copper with a 2.5 inch, frothy off-white head that settles into a consistent quarter inch cap. Delicate strands of lacing are revealed as the brew recedes. Mild nose - some light malt and cascade hops. Taste consistent with nose with the addition of a slightly citrusy character upfront, as well as maybe some biscuit or caramel malts and a slightly earthy quality that comes out towards the middle and back, respectively. There's definitely a hops character there as well, but it doesn't overly assert itself. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, just shy of prickly, carbonation level. Not my favorite style, but a solid and respectable offering that can't be beat at $2.99 a bomber."
"Mouthfeel is very flat. Finish is clean. Taste, like the aroma, is fairly muted. This beer is interesting. It does a great job of being just a pale ale, nothing more, and I could drink a lot of these consecutively. But perception suffers when contrasted with more in-your-face hoppy ales."
"Pours a clear amber color with a great, frothy, off-white head. Smells of bready malts, cantaloupe, and something else I cant quite put my finger on. Taste is more bready malts, balanced out by the grassy hops. Theres almost a slightly sour tinge to it...not sure if it's slightly infected or not. Decent sessionable beer. Medium bodied, kind of flat. Not great, but not bad either."
"Copperish amber brew, 1 finger white head, quick dissipation with minimal lacing. Malts dominate the nose, a bit sweetish, not noticing much hop presence. The taste is malty and smooth, a bit of grassy hops on the back end. Smooth mouthfeel, and very sessionable. Not a great beer by any means, but I nice regional interpretation of the style."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style as the brewery defines this beer as ""a hybrid of a pale ale and an IPA," I believe it certainly hits that mark. Overall it's a nice beer to drink for a long time and one that I would like to see Buzzards Bay Brewing start bottling (tap only release)."
