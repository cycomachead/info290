"Nose of bread, sour yeast, light citrus, grains, grassy. Taste light nutty malt, mild tartness, earthy, floral, citrusy hops. Ok Alt!"
"Münster Alt pours clean cloudy gold with a 2” off white foam cap that fairly quickly drops to a tinny hillock that leaves lines of lace with each drink. Floral aromas join light fruit and grain on the nose. The palate starts with a hint of sweetness and finishes dry with a little fruity tartness. Light grains form the backbone. Medium body and medium low carbonation. Very easy to drink and very refreshing."
"Serving type: bottle."
"Look is nothing special, but it's surprisingly fresh and light without losing its potency. Very happy with this beer at the low price!"

"Sharp and almost like a white wine(sweet kind)  Minor dryness in the finish. Avg."

"Pours a pale golden amber with a copious quantity of puffy white foam floating on top. Aroma is sweet grains and some bubble gum and cherry fruity notes, along with another earthy or perhaps musty element. Bready and quite sweet on the palate, with some breakfast cereal, popcorn and toast, classy floral hops and an emergent citrus note, orange I would say.  Pleasantly assertive but not overpowering hops. Rather fruity. Light thin body and moderate carbonation. For some reason I am surprised that this is so appealing. More sweet and gentle than my conceptualization of the alt style but a great session brew, with enough complexity to hold one's attention."

"Overall, this is a nice and light beer that is easy to drink. Simple as that. The musk and “alt”-ness of it comes all from the malts, which are heavily wheated, and less to the darker, brown side of the spectrum. If this beer was put in front of us we wouldn’t turn it away, but we likely won’t actively seek it out again. Compare this to the Americanized version of the alt, with the musky old ales, and these unfortunately fall to fainter shells of those more robust, flavor-forward offerings. That is us being mighty nitpicky, so don’t get us wrong. This was pleasant, and we are always happy to sip down an organic beverage. Enjoyable, and something Germany should be generally proud to export."
"Taste is round with malt. A bit of depth but no heaviness. Grainy. A slight honey sweetness and the roundness of the malt come together perfectly with a good little bite from carbonation. This finishes dry and with a slight bitter. The herbal is but a whisper in the drink. Just barely there. Crisp and lovely. The mouthfeel is on the thin side of medium."

"In general, very different. The combination of a different fruit, sweet clove, and maltiness make an excellent beer. Worth seeking out."

"I bought this bottle for $3.29 at Front Street Market in Butte, Montana. This beer is a very reasonably priced treat, and I must extend kudos to my favorite local beer outlet. I've noticed a few of these German imports that are a very good value. Prost!"

"Not really getting the Alt designation on the label, this is more helles than Alt, even if it did use top fermenting yeast. Not recommended."
"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and nice example a typical German Lager, it had all the aspects that I would expect from that style and it didn't seem to be all that similar to any of the Altbiers I've had, but I've never had a Munster Alt before so that might be typical for the style. This beer had nice drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, not filling, and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention, I could drink a couple of these but the sweetness might start to wear on me after that. What I like the most about this beer was the aroma, that caramel aspect made it pretty nice. What I liked the least about this beer was the sweetness, if it was toned down a little it would help this beer out. I might buy this beer again when in the mood for this style, it's priced well and I would recommend it to anyone who likes German lagers. All in all I thought this was a solid beer, it was pretty similar to some of the better German Lagers I've had and it didn't have anything off about it. This made for a nice first impression for Brauerei Pinkus Mueller and i wouldn't mind trying a few more of their beers. Nice job guys, keep up the good Organic work.."

"My first altbier! Pours murky dark yellow with a small white quickly receding head. Aroma of sweetly tart cherries, some alcohol, not much else. Flavor is sweet up front with the cherry and honey, then fades into pilsner malt characteristics. Light and lots of carbonation, so would be fine for a hot day. Overall, a small step up from a pale lager if you ask me. Meh."

"A delightful alt beer. I've grown to expect alt to appear darker, but I can totally take a pass at this because of its flavorful goodness. Great on a humid summer eve with a nice cheese plate -- would probably be wonderful with grilled sausages."
""
"O- overall I like this, but I think it is a little too sour to be a really good Alt. There is not enough malt flavor and aroma or bitterness, and a little too much fruit/yeast ester going on to make this a quaffable Alt."

"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a light, smooth, and slightly foamy mouthfeel that actually complements the body's weight quite well. Closes semi-dry, with little to no residual stickiness clinging to the mouth."
""
"O: A very drinkable bier. My first Alt that wan't a Homebrew and it was much different then I expected. I could easily drink a Liter of this on a warm day, and to me thats a sign of a good German beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"I think this is my first proper German Alt. Pretty well enjoyable."
""
"A strange brew for sure. I almost thought it was brewed from lager yeast. Odd tangy notions that didn't blend well with a ho hum base beer. I like the fact that it's organic but this is a no go."
""
""
""
""
"On the lighter end of medium bodied with an odd combination of bready yeast, grassy hops, citrus and astringent metal. Really weird and off style with a very watered down mineral like flavor. Some zesty spice, bready yeast, citrus peel and rusted tin. Bland and very unpleasant."
""
""
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Nice hue, decent head, and plenty of lacing. Nose is full and floral. Flavor is of cardboard and fresh hay. Overall, this is a decent quaff."
""
"High C+"

"16oz bottle, pours super pale gold, super clear, topped with a fizzy white head that holds decent retention and leaves some lacing on the glass. Aromas are grassy, biscuity, fresh, grape juice, apple juice. Tastes are crisp, very dry, tart, white grape, chardonnay, apple juice, grassy, delicate noble hops. Mouth-feel is thin and bubbly, finishes dry. Overall, this is different than any other altbier I've had. Definitely sessionable, but not for the price. I probably wouldn't get this one again."
""
""
""
"What more can you ask for from a brewer. This is terrific and refreshing brew. Nice job."
"Overall this is a great German Alt. If I ever go back I will have to pick up the pils."
""
"Light to medium body and crisp. There is a mild tartness about it. Slightly drying."
""
"The beer had a medium body to it, with a clean, crisp feel, which made the beer extremely easy to drink. Overall, this is a world-glass beer and one that I will enjoy often."
"O - A very interesting, flavorful and drinkable beer."
"O- an interesting beer, very earthy and raw. I don't know of the organic part has anything to do with that but it's definitely intererting."
"O - Not bad at all, but I wouldn't want much of it."
"O – A much lighter alt than I am used to, refreshing, a very drinkable & sessionable beer I enjoyed but not my favorite of the style, may pick this up again for a summer time thirst quenching session 3.5"

"Pinkus was decent, but I am not really going out of my way to get another bottle."
"Overall – very intriguing brew! I wish I could figure out more about the taste and what’s in it."
"O - A pleasant beer, I could see taking down a handful of these."
"Too sweet. To be honest I'm far from a fan, and I don't believe it's a particularly good alt. It's smooth and somewhat drinkable, but depressing in it's expressibility."
"Top beer, very very drinkable."
"This is a subdued beers in many ways but subtle and tasty. Overall it is floral and bready. Some more complexity would go a long way, still I could easily drink several pints of this."
"I may have gotten an old beer. I'll certainly keep my out for it in the future and give it another try. Clearly they are doing something right by the other reviews. I fear I just got a bad bottle of this stuff."
"O: not at all like any alt I've had and just not good, to my taste."
"O- Decent alt, Ive had much better, would pass this up if I saw it again."
"I don't know, I lived in K-Town so maybe there is a difference between southern and northern alts but for an alt, I much prefer a Hannen to the Pinkus."
"Opinion: Unfortunately I was disappointed in this beer in that I was really hoping for an Altbier. This is not that. It is a pretty decent German beer, but not even a Northern Alt would work here as it is too light and has too much of some things and not enough of others. It is an OK session beer nonetheless, but the fact that it is grainy makes it a bit hard to just sit and drink. I have one more bottle of this beer that I will drink pretty soon, but I doubt that I will be buying any more of this beer any time soon."
"Drinkability: Very smooth and drinkable. Though I don't think it is true to style, it is really tasty stuff."
"I like this beer in many ways and the drinkability is high."
"D: This is a delightful, readily available Altbier that delivers the goods. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to get to know German beer."
"Looks more like a pils than their ur pils does. This one is a straw slightly hazed, but no yeast sediment in the bottle. Vibrant golden with a nice brilliant white head to match, fine lacing billowing head beauty in a glass. Aroma has a nice honey malt fruit notes/tart citrus/tropical tones with herbal grassiness going strong this smells excellent. Strong tart cereal notes hints of citrus/tropical mango fruits/a touch of pineapple. Very nice expression of malt and German yeast strains, nothing like the brown versions found in Dusseldorf this is a pale Munster alt, totally different version. Carbonation is natural smooth light to medium bodied never heavy/light perfect crisp fruity qualities blend on the palate. Drinkability overall was killer, a beer I remember trying before I started writing reviews. I'm glad I decided to revisit these beers, each one is more interesting than the next. Next up the dunkel..."
"At first I wasn't too keen on this stuff (probably because I was expecting a typical Alt) but then I realized how unique and drinkable it is. Unlike any other German ale I've sampled."
"Poured from bottle into pilsner glass. Liquid is a hazy yellow with a small white fizzy cap that quickly settles. Smell is incredibly bready, lots of raw dough and crust. Some yeast and malted wheat in the smell as well. Taste seems off - it is equally tart and sour as it is malty. I cant remember having an altbier that was this tart, not to mention this lacking in hop flavor. Mouthfeel is light body with a medium high carbonation. Drinkability is not too good because of the off flavors... Overall this beer's flavors are a bit harsh and unbalanced. Pinkus, meet drain."
"A nice session beer that agreed well with some salty pretzels."
"D: The light-bodied nature of this beer makes it go down rather easily."
"drinkability - really refreshing beverage, knocked down a bit due to the price, my first Altbier and I am not disappointed"
"drinkability; smooth, light, and tasty, one could drink all night and day."
"500ml bottle from Gourmet Haus Staudt. Straw colored with some haziness. The head doesn't stick around long on this one, receding in minutes to a thin film. Smells very fruity, but it's hard to place - persimmon maybe? A bit of tartness, citrus zest, light bready malt and a bit of aspirin. Similar on the palate, ambiguously fruity with a touch of lemony tartness and orange peel. Fairly sweet, and lacking the bitter finish I'd expect from an alt (or any finish to speak of, actually - it just falls off the palate). Finishes with an aspirin-like flavor that puts me off. The body is thin and carbonation a bit too low. Pretty mediocre, though it goes down easily enough."
"On a hot day this would be a fantastically thirst quenching beer. I think I could knock a few of these back in quick succession. The organic aspect is a big plus in my opinion."
"D - I had no idea what to expect with this one. I expected something much darker and rougher but was given a sweet surprise."
"This beer is much more simple than I was expecting. Kinda reminds me of a kolsch."
"Nice cloudy straw-golden colored pour with white head. Nose has bright fresh fruits with a whiff of See's hard candies. On the palate the fruit is there as well, but also a pleasant malty component that isn't overly sweet. Rather light bodied but smooth texture of course, with nice carbonation. Good drinkability."
"Taste is sharp, got that signature German lager flavor that's very crisp and refreshing. It's got a nice light noble hop bite but there's also some creamy maltiness to it. It's super drinkable, especially when it's 90 degrees out."
"Drinkability: to me this beer is a little too sweet, not really to style, imbalanced and generally flawed. It is pretty refreshing, though, and I dig the texture quite a lot. Split the difference."
"Notes: To some this beer up quickly I would call it simply liquid bread and a tasty one at that."
"The pour initially netted a massive two fingers' worth of rocky, bone-white head that settled into a marshmallow Fluf-like consistency. Color was a beautiful straw-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Nose was light, slightly sweet, but quite tempting. Mouthfeel was medium with a very dry quality on the tongue. Finish was totally, bone-dry. Man, this would be fantastic in the summer."
"a beer with slightly more than a golden look. sort of mild white head. a nose of apple and a hint of sourness. very very discreet. palate of hay and apple doughiness but also a very mild sour finish. no smokey qualities though. and the malt is a bit lean. the carbonation is good on the tongue. and a good late summer early autumn feel."
"Very drinkable."
"As a general beverage this falls somewhere between good and excellent. As an alt, I can't see how I'd even rate it as average. I shall have to do more ""research"" on this beer!"
"nice,light tart and refreshing. Maybe not a typical Altbier but tasty nonetheless. I'll be living near Munster soon, so looks like I'll have lots more in my future Cheers"
"D: Pinkus has brought a smorgasboard of German beer styles together and created a fantastic ale. This would make a great beer for the summertime."
"D: Smooth and crisp. The finish is really the best part of this beer. You could drink a few of these, especially on a hot day."
"D: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, this is a decent beer that it worth drinking for a while but there are others in the style that I would pick first."
"I can't remember ever having an alt beer before let alone an organic ale. I was pretty impressed."
"Pours cloudy rich golden in color with a moderately thick white head, good retention and plenty of lace. Inviting aromas of German malts, apples, honey, estery yeast, and a citric hoppiness. Tastes lightly sweet, but with a dry tarty balance--malty but with apples, tart wheat, estery, and a malty cookie and floral finish. Very light in body, but creamy and complementary to the nicely balanced flavor. This beer gave me a new appreciation for alt biers, very tasty stuff. Very easy to drink, very good."
"D: When you're in the mood for an alt, this is one to reach for."
"D: Not too impressed with this one. Easy to drink, but isn't anything special."
"Hazy straw yellow pour out of the 500ml bottle with a couple fingers of fluffy white head. Has some sweet banana yeast on the nose, but then the smell of a musty barn enters. Faint hops in the aroma and taste. A bit of lemon-like tartness mixed in with a touch of sweetness. This beer just doesn't do it for me. I'm not real familiar with this style, so I may have to come back to this at a later date."
"D - Overall this is a good enjoyable beer nothing crazy going on but Just being a good easy drinking beer it's like a chillout beer worth trying sometime"
"D: For an organic beer (with which I haven't had much luck) this one is drinkable. Not something I'd come running back to."
"Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is juicy, medium to light in body, easy to drink. Went well with my kiebasa and sauerkraut sandwich."
"Pours a nice clean/clean golden pale yellow color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger foamy white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slightly hoppy, spice, and caramel. The taste is malty, slight hop note, spicey, with some caramel. Light-Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew."
"Taste is similar, light, crisp, but with a solid, firm character and a little complexity well-rounded. It is strong, fruity grain, yeasty-tangy bread dough, mineral, light herbs, hay, light pear and apple. It finishes with a mineral-lemony dryness, slightly yeasty-lemony-earthy tartness, before a slightly sweeter, lingering aftertaste of grain."
"This is a pretty refreshing and tasty brew. The malts are slightly sweet and crackery. Hops provide enough balance and even a bit of hay-like grass flavors. Mouthfeel is a touch on the thin side and it is not exactly a complex beer, but its a nice drinker that I wish was cheaper and sold in six-packs. A good sessionable beer."
"Poured from a bottle into an arrogant bastard glass. Beer is dark yellow / light brown. Smell is wheaty but no hop character. Carbonation / head was large to begin with and fell away quickly, carbonation persists through the life of the beer. Taste is great, wheaty, nice, not hoppy. Mouthfeel is full, drinkability is high. Pinkus is a great brewery and they produce excellent beers. This is one of the best they produce. Check it out if you get a chance."
"Pours a transparent yellow orange color with a thin white head. Sweet malts, grainy and lightly toasted, although slightly muted, the floral hop character creates the aromatics of a large pilsner. Crisp and bright in flavor, great balance. A little thin on body, bubbly, but very refreshing. Sure its not true to style 100% per say but a damn good beer, especially now in the summer time."
"Sorry, I can't get as worked up about this beer as its rating would suggest. Alt is one of my favorite styles so I assumed Munster Alt would be similar. Not so. The appearance is fine, light straw with a decent head, and the nose was encouraging. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin, the taste delicate, but bland. This maybe a case of rating a beer based only on personal perception rather than judging it as compared to other examples of the same style - but realistically, how many authentic Alt beers am I going to find?"
"A refreshing enough summer quaff, once the bubbles settle, and agreeably complex, if a bit light all around. I'd have this again, after checking out a few other instances of the style."
"This beer poured a cloudy golden color with a big foamy head. The smell was mostly malt with a little bit of spicy and slightly grassy hops. The taste follows the smell, starting off with a little sweet malt that gives away to some flavorful hops that aren't overbearing. The mouthfeel was slightly watery with some very refreshing crisp carbonation. This a very drinkable beer that doesn't sacrifice flavor for drinkability."
"D - Goes down smooth and delicious. Decent drinkability."
"much lighter then i previous atl beers, almost like a wheat beer"
"Sting is admittedly problematic as this is not a necessarily smooth brew. That being said, it can be dealt with quickly and the lack of back helps this area out."
"Overall a tasty very drinkable alt."
"Incredible drinkability!"
"D: Very smooth and pretty flavorful. Goes down real easy; crisp and dry. I only had one bottle, but easily sessionable."
"Drinkable, tasty, refreshing."
"D - Such a nice beer with fantastic drinkability. Could easily put down 3 of these in a night and could session it all day. Nice light flavors yet complex and flavorful."
"M&D - Extremely carbonated, and not the smooth, creamy, yet light mouthfeel I love about alts. Pretty weird. However, I could see myself drinking this in the summertime, but over a good hefe or german or czech pils or lager...?"
"A very solid, delicious brew. At first the flavors reminded me of many different styles, and given what I've read, it seems that this beer is lighter (in color anyway) than most altbiers. Nevertheless, this one is infinitely drinkable and tasty. I could see this being a good gateway beer. I'm not sure how its being organic factored into the taste, but hey, it's organic (for what it's worth)!"
"D: Interesting but not incredible. It's a surprisingly solid beer, but I can't say that I'll necessarily buy another bottle."
"D: Very drinkable. This would be a great session beer on a hot day. No real bells and whistles, though. Do all beers need bells and whistles? I have to continuously remind myself that the answer is no."
"paler than i've come to expect of alts, but manages to retain quite a lot of malt character."
"D: A nice unassuming beer. I'm glad I picked it up. Relatively low ABV makes for easy drinking. Seems like a good session beer."
"D - Not the most unusual beer I've ever had, but crisp, refreshing and tasty. It would be a good, and perhaps excellent, pairing for a wide range of foods. I'm especially thinking raw oysters at a dockside Florida restaurant. File under ""refreshing," ""versatile."""
"This is definitely a beer that I could down a few of. I imagine that on a summer evening five or six of these would disappear without too much effort."
"D - A refreshing, thirst quenching beer. I'd like to see some more character in Munster Alt, as it's bland enough to drink quickly and easily without having to spend too much time pondering over the flavor. Overall a decent beer reminiscent of southern German pale lagers."
"D - All night long!"
"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thin, white head. Smell is grainy and wheaty. Taste is also wheaty, very tart, with a large citrus flavor as well. Very little bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, slightly prickly carbonation. Pretty drinkable though, I would drink this again. I think this is the first Altbier I've had, its OK, but I suspect there may be better examples out there."
"an enjoyable beer and ive not had many alts but adds to my growing list organics that i'm not dying to have again."
"D: Ok drinkability, a modest drinking alt."
"Pours lemon yellow color. Very clear with no head. Smell - mostly honey with touch of grapefruit. Very nice. Taste is the same - honey, malts, a bit too sweet to me, but stil pretty good. Mouthfeel - nice, crisp, not overly carbonated. It's very light beer and it's very drinkable. I would definately have another one (it's fair to mention that it's pretty pricey - about 4.5$ per bottle)"
"I love this beer. I'm not as familiar with the alt style as I am with other beers, but I really love this one. Totally quaffable and thoroughly enjoyable. Nicely done, Pinkus men."
"Pours straw yellow with two finger white head. A little light for a Dusseldorf Alt? Perhaps in Munster Alts are lighter in color. Nice floral aroma. I detect some butterscotch and citrus in the taste. Malt is medium and finishes with a nice citrus bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability good. I could drink several of these-good for a warm summer niight."
"This is a nice alt. Fairly light and refreshing. I could definitely throw back a few of these. Another well done organic brew."
"Think I got a bad bottle. Butterscotch aroma. Butterscotch flavor and odd carbonation. Bleh. Very little head, no lace. Not drinking more of this. Hints of bridal leather and kerosene, reminds me of the fresh earth at a funeral. The finish was thankfully, not that long nor lingering. No bbe date."
"Worth a try..."
"Mellow aroma of sweet breads, lightly spicy. Dark yellow with a huge white creamy top and nice lacing, slow carbonation. Mouthfeel is full and creamy at the very start but finished with a little bit of a thin quality. Flavor is mild and easy on the palate making this alt very drinkable. Slightly sweet with a good breadiness. Enjoyable but slightly better than average."
"I haven't tried many organics. This beer is a nice start. Very pleased."
"Pretty light, fairly refreshing, somewhat interesting on the palate."
"altbier my foot!?! ... very pale gold... some foam but low .. some nice flavours, honey lychee- kinda of intriguing ... again, if this is an altbier, i'd be very surprised- i am not an altbier expert but it seems like a light version .. a decent enjoyable beer but nothing like i expected.."
"I tried this alongside a Pinkus Hefe-Weizen and found many similar characteristics between the two. The Alt is a cloudy amber with a sticky head that lasts all the way down the glass. Aroma is mostly bready but with a decent hit of citrus, but the citrus really overpowers in the taste: way too much orange for me in this style, almost to the point of tasting like a cough drop. Bitterness is quite present, which cuts the sweetness somewhat. In fact, this had more bitterness than other Alt biers I've tried, but in a pleasant way. Not bad, but probably not something I'll try again."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Aroma is strong and malty with fruity undertone, banana and a little apple. Pours a clear golden amber with a fairly thick and fluffy white head. Flavor is a bit thin but not bad - malty with a hint of bananas and just a whisper of sweetness. Texture is jazzy and lively. Not outstanding, but not too shabby."
"D- Interesting but not earth shattering. I'm curious to see what the rest of their organic line up is like."
"Cloudy, meadlike honey color with a one finger white head with moderate retention. Fruity, floral aromas similar to a cherry blow pop. Lots of sweet fruit flavors going on up front, sour cherry, rose water, cotton candy/bubblegum, with a smooth malty middle and a dry light finish balancing out the sweetness. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated, the dry balanced finish reduces the overall sweetness of the smell and early taste to bring about a very drinkable beer."
"Pours a light gold with a thin white head. Head retention wasnt as good as expected but there was minor lacing. Has a strong lemon smell with a bit of cider. Taste was better than I expected. Lemon and orange up front with a yeast/musk ending. Mouthfeel was good with light carbonation."
"Worth a try"
"This is awesome! I have only had a few sips and I'm in love. A great alt and I wish I could get this more often."
"Drinkability is really pretty good for me, a tasty german blonde."
"Overall, probably just not a style for me, but i'm glad I sampled it."
"The aroma was malty and grainy. It was chewy malt most of the way through. It has a little zest in the finish with a slight hop bitterness. It had a lemony taste as it finished. Overall it was refreshing beer after a balmy spring day."
"Drinkability: Excellent drinkability."
"Poured a slightly hazy straw yellow with a thick meringue-like white head. Malt aroma with a little peach scent in the background. Clean malt flavor, just enough hop bitterness to balance, and a bit of fruity ale yeast flavor. There is a very mild presence of wheat-like spiciness, too. A fairly light mouthfeel, which is proportionate to the rest of the beer. Drinkability is great, a real lawnmower beer that has enough flavor to stay interesting after the first couple. Nice summer beer, certainly a good crossover beer for your BMC-swilling friends."
"This Alt is more akin to a poorly brewed American Wheat or Berliner Weiss. It displays none of the characteristics of a classic Alt. For lovers of classic Alts, please avoid"
"Very drinkable beer, light but tasty."
"Drinkability: This is a very unique brew. I can see it being very refreshing in the summertime."
"Very light clearish yellow with a good sized big white head. Smell is light malty graininess, almost a spiced essence and a touch metallic. Taste is a mix of a light maltiness and subtle yeastiness. Very similar to a lightly flavored Wit beer. Not bad at all, but then again, nothing spectacular. It is the first organic beer I've tried that didn't taste strange in some way though."
"Drinkability: I have to say this was a highly drinkable and enjoyable beer. I don't put much credence in something being ""organic"" but I'm not going to hold it against this beer."
"I know that I've had the Pinkus Munster before because I have the label, but I honestly don't remember drinking it. This is a very nice brew and more complex than my feeble palate/brain can describe. No doubt, I will buy again, if for no other reason, to try and pick out some of the background flavors/aromas that are giving me trouble tonight."
"Drinkability- Very drinkable, very sessionable."
"However, if you think of it as a decently good pils, you'll be fine."
"Poured right into a tapered pint glass from the bottle. The puffy head disappears within 10 minutes. Smell very yeasty in the way of a typical German beer. Very cloudy and hard to see the bubbles rising. I took this beer out of the fridge to allow it to warm up a bit. A yeasty/ citrus like taste that lingers on the palate. Very drinkable and interesting."
"Very smooth and drinkable with a surprisingly rich mouthfeel."
"Poured a really nice, bright, light head. The head itself seemed to be bubbling, not just sitting there which was interesting. A nice level of carbonation with the bubbles on the bottom climbinb up the side of the glass and those on top rushing quickly to the surface. Average, golden, slightly hazy color, with an aroma like rice krispies. This was my first altbier and it definitely brought me back to my time in Deutschland. I expected a sweeter, deeper malt taste, but this tasted almost like a wheat beer. Good though, I would drink it again but probabl won't buy it for a while."
"When poured from its pint bottle to my pint glass, it had an awesome gold color with a bright white head. The aroma was delicate with a sweet malt base and a piney hop scent probably due to the noble hops used (Saaz?).The flavor was delicate with a light body and a dry finish. The piney hop flavor is present during the entire tasting. All and all, it was a light, refreshing, delicate beer. And best of all, it's 100% organic!"
"i have'nt had an alt in a while ; pours a hazy golden-straw colour w/ a thin white head which dissapates quickly, little lacing ; a hoppy aroma w/ some malty undertones, i get a faint, almost smokey aroma in there too ; a little thin on the flavor, mostly hop w/ a ""euro-macro"" malt profile, not as malty & rich as some alts i've had ; a light, almost dry palate w/ a good amount of carbonation ; a very drinkable brew, i want to try this one head-head w/ some other alts one day ...."
"Pours a very clear, cloudy color with minimal head. Aroma is light and somewhat malty upfront. Taste is somewhat bitter in front with a lot of malt crispness. It's nice and bready as well. A bit hard to describe but otherwise, I think this is a decent altbier. It's not as dark as other altbiers that I've had and seems more true to the style as well. Regardless, I'll chalk this up as being very drinkable much like the Ur Pils."
"Sticky in the throat, and a bit watery. This beer is just not flavorful enough for me. I don't have a lot of Altbier experience, but this doesn't satisfy. However, I don't think this is a poorly constructed beer either. It has plenty of depth and complexity. Just not my cup o' tea. But all in all very drinkable beer."
"Overall? I think a lot of the flavour with this Alt will be missed if you just sip or drink and swallow but I find that swishing it in your mouth just a few times will help you recognize what's going on here when you return to sipping/drinking. Just something that I find from my experience. Ymmv. Bottom line: I really like this Alt and I hope to try some more of the style in the not too distant future."
"I had this beer at Mr. Moto's in Burlington IA, poured from a standard German 0.5L bottle. The beer was much lighter in color than I expected for an Altbier, it was crystal clear and golden colored. The aroma was malty, a little like a muted wort smell, very promising. The flavor was almost all malts, slightly sweet, nothing offensive but nothing too strong either. Very easy for a variety of palates I would guess, almost like a strong Kolsch. Very nice sessionable beer."
"D-This beer seems to have more aspects to it than I can glean. I'll want to try it again when my tasters have improved."
"D-This is a good beer but I kind of am a little bit at a loss as to what to make of it. It is much lighter than all other alts I have had and has a similar taste to the other beers in Pinkus' lineup. An interesting beer nonetheless and one I probably will get again to explore further."
"I haven't had many altbiers, so this is a pretty raw assessment. A: Light gold, pretty clear, light puffy head that died down after a minute or two. Very clean. S: A lot going on here, very sweet but a lot of dry grains on top. T: A bit thin at first, but it really comes alive after a moment. Grains, citrus, floral qualities. Very nice. M: Very smooth, moderate carbonation. D: I could drink this beer all night. It's been a very hot summer so I've been looking for some interesting lighter beers, and this fits the bill nicely."
"Overall: Possibly skunked but probably not, this brew strikes me as overly bready and cereal-flavored as well as a bit thin. In style, I guess this is a good beer, but I just dont appreciate Alts, I suppose. Your mileage may vary."
"d - forgettable brew, i'm glad i didn't have to pay for this. i'm not too familiar w/ this style but i wasn't impressed w/ this though it did have some good qualities."
"D - This was a very nice beer. Another good German brew."
"This was much better than I was expecting it to be. Everything else I have ever had from this brewery, I didn't care for. It poured a yellow/orange colour with a bit of chill haze, and a white head that seemed to vanish in about 40 seconds; white patchy webbing and a thick white ring around the edges remained. Smell was all sweet malts. Almost smelled like a bowl of breakfast cereal, actually. Taste was sweet cereals all the way through, with a bit of a sourness right at the finish. Mouthfeel was smooth and very easy to drink. Refreshing. I'm very glad I tried this offering from an otherwise dissappointing brewery. A good brew, for sure."
"DA: Another, not-so-good organic offering. I was really routing for this one to be decent. I expected an Alt and got a thin American Macro Lager. Oh well."
"Like the Gose, I think this is a style of beer best left to the history books."
"D - Goes down pretty easy, but it is very light, almost like a macro. This is ballpark beer. Gave my wife a taste, and she thought it tasted like a very heavily watered-down Hoegaarden."
"Drinkability: This seems like a weird altbier to me... Acidity seemed a little much and hurts drinkability. Not bad, but I won't buy it again."
"dirnkability is ok. at first the aroma threw me off, but it's a decent and enjoyable beer."
"Be hard pressed to buy this one again. Time will tell, at least to me, whether this is at all like a true altbier."
"As Alts go, this was a bit disappointing. Granted there are variations on every theme, but this was not what I expected from a brewer whose other products I have found to exceed expectations. The color was a hazy pale yellow, with a decent head that fell quickly. Not much in the nose but the typical mix of helles-like malts. And the taste wasn't as rich as I had expected either. Extremly mild blend of malt and generic hops flavor in a rather thin mouthful. I looked at the label twice to make sure I was drinking something called an Altbier. I could have sworn I was drinking a helles-lager or even a cloudy Kolsch. Very drinkable, but therein lies the problem. I was expecting something rich and special. Not this time."
"Drinkability-good summer brew"
"The drinkability is not so great, I would try it again, but I will not seek it out. MK"
"I got a single 1 pint and 1 fluid ounze bottle of Organic Munster Alt, and poured into a pint glass (Those numbers don't add up well). Again, this is one of the handful of Pinkus Organics that I got last night and was extemely impressed with. Very good taste for an organic beer. Again, the smell wasn't that stong. The color was a darkish brown color with a little transperiency. There was a touch of head, with not much retention and very little lace left over. Don't drink and review."
"Poured a hazy light golden color with moderate white creamy head. modest lacing. Smell is summer fruity, with some citrus (lemon) notes also present. Taste follows through on the taste with a nice fruity sweetness and stronger lemon tastes. At the finish a fine hop bitter bitterness begins to come through, which proves to be a fine ending for this beer. Not quite what I was extecting, but still a very enjoyable beer."
"This is not what I expected. I'm used to something closer to a British Mild. This is a weak expression of an Alt."
"Pours a hazy golden lemon cloud color with long lasting foamy head. The bubbles are moderately tight on top and larger and more soapy looking further down. Tastes of a lemon haze - pilser/hefe mix. Notes of lemon, sweet vanilla and plain graham cracker. Nicely drinkable."
"I don't know...maybe this isn't the Alt, maybe I got a mislabelled bottle, but this really seems like a pilsner."
"Poured to golden color, with very thin white head and no lacing. Aroma of sour fruit, hops and I actually thought I detected wheat. Taste somewhat sour fruit, warmed to a little more flavor, with bitter palate. An OK beer, but nothing special enough to convince me to start drinking organics on a regular basis.."
"Organic Alt is a cloudy yellow color with a high level of carbonation. The head is tall and pretty thick. Aroma is of sweet grain, almost euro lager-like, with an edge of darker malt. Taste starts with sweet malt, with an earthy edge. Graininess is high for the style. Herbal hops stay in the background. A slight lemony flavor is noted mid-sip and is joined by an acidic mouthfeel. Midsip also brings a musty flavor that seems off. This doesn't taste like the few alts I've sampled. Flavors collide all over the place and provide no cohesive taste. Maybe my bottle is off or old. Anyway, this isn't bad, but isn't something I particularly want to drink either."
"I've been gravitating towards well-built, subtle beer styles in the summer and this fits the bill perfectly. Went down fantastically while watching the sunset on the porch."
"Not a bad altbier. Pours out to a medium orange color with a small head of white foam. No lace. Aromas of citrus and yeast, mixed with flat and bland malts. Taste is fair; medium bodied malts and sour citrusy yeast notes mellow in the mouth, and hints of fermented grain and flowery hops. Mouthfeel is smooth and a touch creamy. Not bad. Drinkability is pretty good. I'd have this again. I dig that it's organic. Kind of cool... Worth a try."
"Pinkus Organic Munster Alt pours a hazy golden color with a white head. Mild, malty aroma. Taste definitely tends to the malty side, some metallic taste present but not too distracting. I like this compared to the other Alt beers I've had, its not as intensely malty, and quite drinkable, more drinkable than the other Alts I've had, perhaps, I think because it is a lower alcohol than the others. Worth a try."
"After consuming the bottle I had to double check to make sure that what I had drank was the Alt. The bottle says it was, so I must assume it is right. This just seemed a lot like the Ur Pils."
"An unusual Alt to be sure, Pinkus Münster Alt was not what I had expected, but was a great beer none the less. Organic and unfiltered this beer was full flavored and enjoyable."
"Pours out a light chill hazed golden honey colour, small dash of white head that recedes to a thin film. Cut grass and hay on the nose, along with some faint bready malt, and just as faint metallic grain. The flavour starts out with some light malt, more grainy and dry in the middle, blending into a hop finish akin to thick wet grass, and somewhat floral. The aftertaste is sticky but dry, it coats the palate yet still has something of a parching effect. A fairly light altbier, but enjoyable for what it is. I'm not craving another, nor do I have any major plans to run out and buy more, but it's one of the more decent organic beers that I've sampled, it has it's own small charm."
"Even though there isn't much good about this one, it still goes down alright. Perhaps a fair weather beer, however I won't be after this one again."
"Drinkability: not the altbier I expected. Average drinkability as this is too grassy and dry. This is an example that organic may not always be the better choice."
"The beer jumps out a pale translucent yellow color with a big foamy white head. Whaa? There is a light berry aroma. The flavor is very fruity, again, berry. It is sugary sweet with a slight soapiness in the finish/ aftertaste. Mouthfeel is the best thing here. It's mid-weight and fluffy. I was really expecting more from Ayinger on this. Maybe I'm just a dumb american, but his beer is not only antithetical to my idea of alt, its just not a very good beer for any style."
"Light haze in a golden mustard body. Light, soft guazey-white head. Peppery, tangy barley malt. Wet hay, buttered oatmeal. Interesting. Tangy hay and oats. Dry. Sourdough bread. Yeasty, getting slightly bitter into the long, semi-acidic finish. A little too tart? Light to medium bodied with a refreshing, crisp, dry feel. Not bad, and nice that its organic."
"D- This is not what I was expecting in an alt. The bright fruit notes are nice and adds more depth. The malt flavors are light but complex with fresh grain qualities that are refreshing."
"Actually quite drinkable, just not in the style box. If you want that, find some Diebels!!"
"This Alt Beer poured into a mug was golden amber with a white head and slight lace. The smell is fruity with citrus and malt overtones. Nicely carbonated with a medium-weight mouth feel. The taste is a mixture of earthy grains and banana with a tart finish. This was my first beer from this brewery and it was pretty good. About to follow it up with their Pils."
"Pours incredibly light..nearly colorless. Wasn't quite what I was expecting there.. Decent head retention despite the somewhat fizzy head. Very grassy/herbal aroma of light hops and a strong wheat character. The taste is very wheaty and almost corrosive on the palate...very grainy mouthfeel. A somewhat refreshing light alt from Germany, but overall, nothing too spectacular..and I couldn't care less about the whole ""organic"" thing."
"A different alt is needed for comparison."
"Not bad, not bad at all."
"Though it is a good beer, I don't think that it fits the style. I expected a deep copper - amber color. Instead, I got a hazy golden - copper hue. Has good head retention and lacing. Aromas are beady and citrusy. Thought I expect mild fruit aromas, I don't expect the tart citrus notes. Flavors are the same. the lemon-ey character over-rides the medium malt profile. The hops add a spiciness the the beer that is not expected. Though I like hop bittering in an Alt, I don't go for the spices here. The yeasty flavors take on a Belgian 'twang' , leaving the beer less clean than in most alts. The body is medim and a tad bit astringent. Finishes far too dry for an Alt, but crisp and fairly clean. Again, good beer, but not an Alt."
"An unusual, but satisfying beer. The initial flavors are what you'd expect from an Alt, while the finish is saison-like; surprisingly tart and full of citrus."
"I thought that this was an interesting brew, and it was quite easy to drink as well. I hope to track down more more alts to see how they comapare with this one."
"500 ml bottle. No date. Pours golden with a larg head the rapidly disapates. More kolsch aromas than what I would expect from an alt. Apples and flowers. The kolsch come though in the flavor also. Very crisp apple notes. Tangy. Slightly bitter. Medium body and high carbonation make this beer prickly over the tounge. Flavor leaves quickly. This is not what I expected. Not really an alt that Im familiar with."
"Overall I'm not a big fan of this beer. This is the second time that I've tried it and both times now I've not been a fan. Maybe it's my dislike for the Alt style of beer."
"This is a great, easy drinking, refreshing, and mildly complex beer that would be perfect in a wide variety of situations; and one that would pair easily with an even greater selection of foods. Quite nice!"
"This beer poured a very light pale color, very light. Nice size head which is rather foamy and fluffy. Aroma is really nice. Slightly sweet, slightly floral. A bit of yeast in there as well. Flavor is just nice and clean. Light grains hold the base along with a noticeable yeasty breadiness. A bit of hop spice is there and fits in well. More of a floral and lightly acidic finish. Very clean in the end. Well made, I enjoyed this bottle and drank it rather easily. Went very well to cleanse the palate with my corned beef sandwich during lunch. Oh, and the organic thing is really cool."
"Poured a huge thick, white head atop a very light golden brew. The color is almost as light as budweiser which really surprised me as the last alt I had was Zum Uerige and it looked nothing like this. Aroma reminds me of hallertauer hops and it is blended with a dry toasty malt flavor and a weird ester I am not familiar with. The flavor is hoppy at first then it segues into an isipid watery flavor that finished very clean except for a touch of misplaced hop flavor. Very weird beer and I find it hard to call it an alt as it is sort of a mix between pilsner, alt, and kolsh. I would not buy this beer again."
"Medium bodied, yet creamy and with a decent carbonation. Yet it does lack the assertive bitterness and maltiness I like in an alt."
"Pours much lighter than expected for a Dusseldorf Alt, but this is from Munster. Very light head, and the color is a hazy orange-yellow. The smell from the yeast in the bottle is evident along with malty aromas. The taste is mostly from the malt with an almost astringent hop flavor on the tounge. This could also be from the yeast I guess. The body seems very thin yet there is still a good malt base. I would definitly choose a Dusseldorf Alt over this, but still an interesting beer."
"I was told this would be a little different than the Dusseldorf Alt style I am familiar with and it was. I found the flavor to be a little more acidic and the flavor and aroma to have a slight citrusy note. Of course there is plenty of malt and a very smooth finish on this. I did enjoy it and hope to again soon. Quaff away."
"Overall- what is this?! Too watery, too cheap tasting. Maybe I have a bad bottle but this was a total waste."
"I was hoping for an earthier, maltier alt, but you live, you drink, you learn."
"The Munster Alt isn't a standout beer, but to gain a sense of the altbier, go for it."
"This altbier poured a very slightly hazy, golden amber color with creamy, white foam that settled flat. A somewhat unexpected color for an altbier. The smell was very lightly sweet and malty with a bit of biscuit and an aroma somewhat grain-like. The taste was lightly sweet and tangy with an almost corn sweetness. A light hoppiness came through in the finish. There was a hint of floral hops in with the bitter. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium-light body and low carbonation. Not much of an aftertaste. This was a bit of an odd altbier, unlike the typical Düsseldorf style altbiers that I am familiar with."
"Drinkability: I've had better alts but this is more like a cross between a Munich Helles and an Alt; certainly drinkable, but I wouldn't seek it out everyday"
"Hazy, dark wheat colored beer with moderately active carbonation. Creamy, bright white head is on the small side and leaves a bit of stringy lace. Pale malt and faint hop aromas are quickly overtaken by a zesty lemon aroma. The taste is a little closer to what I was expecting. Soft, mild malty flavor up front followed my some spicy hops, but the tanginess makes it's way in towards the finish. From what I've read on this style and the altbiers I've sampled this one was way lighter in color then I expected and about half the malt I was expecting in the aroma and flavor."
"From what I've heard, this beer really varies from bottle to bottle. If I ever come across it again, I might give it another try. Until then, it's just a rather MOR import."
"Thanks for the bottle, babydoc!"
"Maybe I just prefer the Dusseldorf renditions, but this one has little worth to me."
"I believe that this is my first altbier. Picked up fairly cheaply at my local store. Pours with an assertive 3 finger frothy white head which sits upon its golden body. Nose has notes of malt and also a pleasant sweet floral aroma. Initially a huge pale malt taste smacks you in the face before slowly fading into flower notes and a subtle, sweet finish. Drinkability is very nice on this one. I must get some more alts to try. I'd love to see how this would be fresh."
"Pours a dark gold color (lighter than many alts i've had). Small white head, very sticky on the side of the glass. Smell is sweet and grainy, very earthy and pungent. Alcohol is present in the smell, but it tastes stronger than it is. Biscuity yeast and earthy. A very unique beer, i can't really compare it with anything else."
"Drinkability  This isnt a bad drinking Altbier, just not up to snuff for the style. It will go good with lighter food, but dont pair it with bratwurst und brotchen. I had it with a spinach fruit salad and it was fine."
"Nice taste, excellent balance, and wonderful drinkability."
"Pinkus Munster Alt is an easy drinking beer that has as much flavor and body as it needs to have and no more. It's a well-crafted package that is impressively quaffable and it 'alt' to go well with a multitude of foods, as long as they aren't strongly spiced or flavored. I don't see much wrong with this one."
"Really light. It would be great on a hot day but ultimately not enough going on to pique my interest."
"Served in a small thin cylindrical ""alt"" glass. Poured a hazy yellow with a big head that dissipated rapidly leaving nice lacing. Had a slight citrusy aroma with malty undertone, nice mouth feel with a taste that was at once mildly citrus with hints of wheat and malt and a short dry finish, not at all like Frankenheim, Uerige, nor Ad Astra ( Ah I miss Free State). Definitely worth another try. I think I will grab another."
"Lighter in color than any other alt that I have seen. It pours out a darkish yellow, almost like a hefe. Looks good, just doesn't look like an alt. The smell is like raw wheat and more harsh than I expected. The smell is a bit grassy as well. Taste is similar to the smell but more mild. This is an alt? I guess that I don't know much about the style. The grassy notes come through more in the after taste. Actually a well balanced beer, I am just very confused about the style and how this beer fits in."
"Poured a cloudy and dull pale yellow color. Huge head of frothy and hearty foam topped this brew off and kept bouncing back after every pour. The aroma yielded sweet musty grains, along with sticky sweet fruity nectar. A beautiful lemon grassiness compliments the beer. The taste is pleasantly light, fruity and refreshing. This is a unique Altbier, and one of the lightest Ive ever had. Very flavorful, fruity and refreshing with just a hint of spicy sweet malts in the finish. Lacks that peppery spice quality as I have tasted in some other Alts, like a Frankenheim say, but very nice in its own right. Quite drinkable."
"Not a bad beer, but in my opinion it's just not an alt. I'm not really sure how to classify this one. It is a quite drinkable and refreshing beer, but to me it's just mis-labled."
"Poured with a slightly hazed golden color with a big beige head. Bready, husky malt aromas as well as a little fruitiness and mustiness. Light and refreshing with a sweet, husky malt profile. Water portion of the beer tastes minerally. Some fruity yeast notes with a light mouthfeel. Good German ale."
"Passed this beer by hundreds of times but finally decided to give it a try. It poured a pale straw color with a huge head that disappeared very quickly. There was some kind of a fruit (raspberry?) odor to it, creating enticement. I get a full malt blast in the mouthfeel. The actual characteristics of the beer come out full blast in the finish, where the real taste lingers. I sense lots of earthy toned flavors intertwining. Somewhat fruity, but subtle and definitely grainy. At the conclusion, you are left with a very bitter twang in the back of your mouth. OK, but I wouldn't seek it out for the price."
"Hazy body, golden orange in color with a thin yet persistant film of white foam. Sweet, fruity aroma with a musty, yeasty touch. Flavor is sweet and malty with a herbal note and light, hoppy finish. Well balanced and very drinkable. Rich, substantial mouthfeel."
"A super drinkable brew, I like Alt Biers, this is the best one I have had yet."
"This brew is a cloudy orange color, with a small bubbly white head on top. Lots of little carb bubbles. The scent is pure malt, caramel. As for the taste, its got a slick pale malt backbone, some hop contrast but not much. This is pretty refreshing, somewhat different from my other alt experiences, but this ones from germany so it should be a pretty good example."
"Light, lemony golden in color with only a tease of head. Aromas are of sweet malt and tangy citrus. Flavors are on the bright side-very lemony with a good crisp mouthfeel and basically clean flavors. Some tang to go with the malt here, and a very low hop profile. The mid palate and finish come off as almost sweet, with a lemon soda type of flavor. Perhaps better with food than alone."
"First of all Im not sure why this is concidered an alt.. But pours a golden light copper colour with a nice fluffy white head. Nose is of sweet malt and a bit of hops, but its lacking the usual malt profile of a true ALT. Taste is more of a lager than a Dusseldorf ALT.. Maybe I got the styles confused, but this beer was clean and crisp and with a little hoppy. Mouthfeel was good and it was very drinkable, but just not what i was looking for with the word ALT."
"Pours with a two-fingered white head that fades slowly and leaves some lace. Low carbonation. Slightly cloudy amber color but no chunky bits. Nose is slightly hoppy. Starts with a hoppy dryness and leaves with an aftertaste that has a slight bitterness. To be honest I find it boring. Light bodied. $3.89 for a 500ml bottle."
"Poured a murky brownish tan, with a few rather scary sediment chunks drifting about. Not nearly enough heft to the malt, the beer leaned in the direction of a thin astrigency. I kept waiting for the flavor in this beer to get up and do something, but it seemed content to languish in mediocrity. No punch of any kind from the hops, and the malt just had no horsepower."
"More assertive in flavor than a German larger, and without the hard water notes that are common in English ales. More low key than American ales, but much less astringint than a typical American micro-ale, thanks to European malts. Flavor profile opens with hop bitterness, followed slowly building mellow sweetness from Munich and caramel malts, and a sweet finish."
"The beer pours a cloudy gold color with a thick frothy white head. The aroma is decent. It is a bit musty with a lemony zest. It boasts of pale malts and yeast. The taste is fine. It is light and pale with a yeasty finish. It is dry and a bit musty. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a low bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. It drinks a little above average, but this is nothing special. Yeah, yeah it's organic. That's cool, but what's the use if the beer is sub-par."
"Organic Munster Alt was a transluscent cloudy gold color. It had a good full head and the lace was decent. The aroma was a bit floral with hay and metalllic elements. The taste was dry, metallic, and citrusy (lemony) with some sweetness. It also had decent hop bite and good carbonation. A little yeastiness led to a dry, bitter finish. Not a bad beer and one worth trying again."
"Taste: brief, not quite bitter hop appearance leads the way on the palate, a quick spritz, then it's more emptiness, with just a touch of malt, and a hint of sweetness. Body is light, finish rather blase', and all 'round it's a forgettable affair. You've got to applaud the organic angle, though, and it's drinkable, and tasty, but too simplistic for me to get excited over."
"is this classified as an alt simply because of the brewing and conditioning methods? if you are looking for the typical düsseldorf style, look elsewhere. the beer is interesting enough for a taste, but it wasn't enjoyable enough for me to keep drinking. an interesting brew, nonetheless."
"Hazy straw golden. A little beige head provides minimal lace. The aroma is quite bready. And yeasty. And mildly fruity. This beer seems slippery on the tongue. Quite slick and not too enjoyable. There's a trace tart quality that really isn't appropriate. Lemony as well. Some bready malts and german hops noted as well. Probably my least favorite alt to date."
"I'm enjoying this: a lot of flavor out of nowhere, and not a high abv to deal with. Pour is a dusky straw. Aroma is fresh and bready. Taste is a surprise of honey and some appley notes. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing. I thought this would be darker, or hoppier, and I find it's neither (hard to tell with that brown bottle). I find this rather tasty, and wouldn't mind a few bottles more for the rest of the evening. Would drink again. pat"
"Great looking glass of beer, tall and thick white head just over an inch high, golden straw yellow body, head settles slowly to a thick hazy foam, lace sticks amazingly well in clumpy patches. Aroma is lightly malty sweet and fruity, kinda like sourdough bread and eggs, notes of vanilla, almond, and strawberry. An inticing nose, but lightly so. Taste is mild, some short lived bready sweetness, lightly fruity with strawberry and honeydew, subdued tangyness, malts are quite sweet and frothy fresh. Takes a bit of getting use to, but once it settles in and warms up some it ain't half bad. Feel is close to medium, carbonation is pretty full and raspy in texture with a full on sweetness sticking around long after each sip. A strange, sweetly fruity brew, a bit enjoyable, but I think I'd rather be drinkin' something else."
"A nice drinkable beer..but not really a classic alt..worth a try though."
"Odd -- light yellow-gold, slightly hazed, carbonation desperately clings to the sides of the glass. Highly herbal quality to the aroma. Grainy aromas. Light notes of lemon grass. Medium-bodied, feels a bit like a dense, unsweetened cake. Grassy hops. Slightly astringent feel to the aftertaste. Simply a spectacular beer to drink. It isn't the most exciting or most flavorful or most aromatic brew you'll ever have, but it's tasteful simplicity and drinkability make it a great beer."
"Organic ""monster"" alt is straw yellow in color and slightly. It is nicely carbonated. The head dissipates quickly. The flavor is straightforward -- nicely malty and clean, just a bit sweet with a pleasantly lingering aftertaste. Overall light but flavorful and well balanced."
"And my hebrew name is Schlomo ben Pinkus so there we go!"
"Very Kolsch-like appearance...light straw color and somewhat hazy from the yeast. Huge head when poured, dissipates to a thin layer. Lightly toasted grain, fruity (white grape) aroma. Fresh bread grains and subdued hops summarize the flavor. Once again, for a light colored beer, there's plenty of flavor. An (ale) altbier by definition but unlike any German alt (brown ale) I've ever had. Nevertheless, a tasty light German ale."
"Pours a hazy gold/amber color with a big thick foamy head that takes several minutes to fade away and it does so leaving some lacework. Flowery and fruity aroma. Strikes a good balance between the hops and malt, yet finishes a bit dry. Moderately spicy hops. There's a very interesting tart, acidic flavor that I like that I'm guessing is contributed by the yeast. Very soft mouthfeel. It would be nice if it was bit more bitter with a bit more body. A very quaffable, yet interesting alt -- very different from other altbiers!"
"Hazy pale-gold hue, white fluffy head, reaches a modest half finger, held well. Unorganized lace. The nose is aromatic I just dont think I like the smell. Funky and tart, earthy, raw sweetness thats muted. Odd. The palate has raw sweetness, like fresh honey, lemony-tart with noticeable wheaty taste too. There is a strong acidic bite. The maltiness is weak. Odd but it was okay to drink. The hops are more available as it warmed, an improvement. Medium body. Indifferent carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel. I cant say Id recommend this one. I prefer the Dusseldorf-style of Alt."
"My first Alt was a brand called ""Hannen," which was better than Ganter products, but second choice to anything by Rothaus. Hannen was mocha-flavored, thin-bodied and brown. This is better and 180 degrees different."
"Not really what I'm after in an altbier. Not a lot going on, and what was going on didn't interest me."
"Bought a bottle at Huckleberry's. Pours a dark gold color with a big white head. The big smell I'm getting out of this is honeyish. Nice lacing. The taste is predominantly the honey that I smelled, but with a citrusy hop flavor vying for attention. A bit paler than I remember the alts I had in Germany, but a tasty beer nonetheless."
"Overall: Different, dare I suggest that it does indeed taste Organic. Maybe it sounds stupid, but it does a very natural earthy aspect to it, which for me dampens the overall appeal of the beer a little."
"This brew poured a full head of finely sized white bubbles with a fair lacing. This brew has a cloudy dark yellow color with carbonation rising continuously up the side of the glass. It has a citrus flavor with a hint of honey full bodied and flavorful with a corresponding citrusy honey aroma. I can tell already that this brew is going to go down well with dinner."
"500 ml bottle. Poured a light amber color with a sizable head that receded quickly. Some fine lacing on the glass. Aroma is light malt and hops. Tast is smooth malt with a little sweetness and a nice hop finish. Very good carbonation and very refreshing. Another beer I could drink all night."
"When poured into my glass, this beer poured a good head and it also had decent lacing to it. In my opinion, it had a fruity aroma and there was a lot of carbonation observed. This beer went down very smooth which is much to my liking and it was a very drinkable beer."
"This is the third installment I've had from Pinkus Mueller. Naturally cloudy gold color with beautiful snow white head and subtle lacing. Nose is a little sweet and malty and close to a Pils. Taste also is like a Pils but a little sweeter. Nice overall beer. I love the beers from Pinkus, great stuff"
"Opaque gold, lighter than I expected. Bright white head of 1/4 inch and small bubble sizes. Sheets on the Imperial pint glass. Whopping malted chocolate milk aroma, like a Dairy Queen malt dessert or something. Flowery and nutty flavors, lots of cashew and a lot of persistant mouthfeel for style. While there is bit of hoppiness, its more like a seedy skin bitterness that permeates the sweet side from middle to finish. Not a dry finish at all, lots of aftertaste. Seems a lot bigger in profile than many Alts, you can either like it or go the other way."
"I tried this the same day that I had Copper Creek's excellent alt. This isn't bad, but it doesn't hold up with the Athens, Ga., brewpub's take on the style. This is a little paler and has less of a hop bite, but it still doesn't fall into the realm of just another crappy beer called alt."
"Interesting dull gold with a nice foamy/frothy head and trails of sliding lace. The aroma is faintly of yeast, malt and hops. The malt is lightly sweet with a trace of herbs. Lightly lime-like citrus hops with a hint of cloves. The alcohol peeks through from time to time. Becomes sweeter and more evenly balanced throughout. This is a gulpable beer. I kept raising my ratings as I drank it."
"This beer poured out with a huge ivory head that was tightly built over a hazy apricot colored body. The head tended to depart rather quickly, but it left behind great lace deposits from the filmy residue head. A very good looking beer. The nose seemed to build as the head lowered and the beer warmed. Mostly it gave off scents of malt and yeasty breadiness from the medium bodied brew. Very creamy and mild. The taste is mostly sweet malt with some light graininess. Also some grassy notes. Finishes somewhat tart and has a long aftertaste that is bitter in the front."
"Clear yellow-gold color (with a slight haziness) and a towering white head. The head has decent retention. Cereal grains and a dryish spicy continental hop smell in the aroma. Fleeting veggie smell (didnt believe it at first). Not terrifically carbonated, and llight to medium mouthfeel. Grassy and hoppy, and a rather dry finish. Pretty good for a spring sipping beer; it is refreshing, but not outstanding."
"This pours with a rocky, lacy white head over clear yellow/straw-clored liquid. Maltiness dominates the nose. Crisp malt flavor tasted with a snappy hint of tartness just bubbling under. Very little, if any, hop bitterness tasted. Finishes slightly dry...that's all, folks!"
"this organic pours out a hazy, dirty, dark golden color. huge foamy head which is painfully slow to die down. sweet aroma of bran and honey cereal. floral hops dance in and out of the nose. very smooth mouthfeel, bordering on slick....this leads to a rather layered taste profile, with malt and toffee...some slight caramel and choco notes...all backed up with an unmistakeable alcohol bite in the finish. seems quite light in all aspects for an alt. but yet pretty stiff because it has some serious alcohol overtones. munster alt definitely is a style all it's own. recommended for it's uniqueness."
"A nice ""Organically Cloudy"" golden amber color, the head large and frothy, the resultant lace a fine latticework to coat the glass. The organic musk is quite noticeable, the malts and a nice crisp tone also present, and start is quite sweet, the top middling in feel. Finish is a bit tart and the acidity biting with the hops plentiful and the aftertaste dry and long lasting. Ive really gotten quite fond of these organic unfiltered beers; they have a certain appealing earthiness."

"Cloudy and gold with a thin white head. Aroma is malty and fruity... a grainy aroma mixed with sour fruit. Flavor is mild but interesting... some grain and bread like flavors with critus and sour apple notes. Finishes with a touch of spicy hops. Crisp and refereshing, with a light to medium body. Would make an excellent summer seasonal."
"This beer poured a straw color and formed a nice bubbly foamy white head that left some circular lace when it subsided. Some carbonation present. An aroma of malt and grain. A flavor of grain, banana and lightly of citrus. The body was light and the finish slightly dry. My first try of this style, so the review may change."
"Not an appetizing looking beer, with it's cloudy, pale gold body and weak head.  Smells rather nice, however.  It has a gentle grainy aroma, with a heavy dose of sour fruit - perhaps Granny Smith apple is the best comparison. Light smell of hops present as well.  Taste is smooth and refreshing.  Rather grassy, with a bit of tart fruitiness.  Finishes clean with some herbal hop bitterness.  Good brew for an unseasonably hot day!"
"Lighter than I'd expect. Relatively solid head that heald about an inch for a few minutes. Malts come through. A good amount of sweetness. Reminds me of a chocolate factory actually. Smooth."
"A real light-colored alt style.Great rocky head nice soft/subtle toasted grain,and leafy hop taste.Very drinkable malt acented beer in my opinion,just enough green hop.Probably my first organic beer I have tried,not that it matters that much really I think."
"Clear golden in hue if decanted off the yeast sediment.  Impressive fluffy, thick well retained head.  Herbal Hallertauer hop nose, along w/ a bit of mellow tartness due to the unusual use of wheat in the grist. Soft grainy malt flavors in flavor, but that honey - like sweetness is prominent, just as in Pinkus's Pils. Hop bitterness is fairly subdued for an alt and residual malt sweetness is high, but as a beer in itself this is a very tasty one.  Hop flavor is absent.  Although Munster lacks the crispness and assertive bitterness of an alt, there's plenty of flavor to make it an enjoyable brew."
"Notes: Brewed in the classic Alt style, lighter in colour though still retaining a sturdy malt backbone."
