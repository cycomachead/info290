3.2,-12.3,3,3,3.5,3,3,"This beer poured out as a reddish brown color with a tan colored head that was pretty thin. The aromas were of a lot of grains and malt. There isn't a whole lot of hops on the nose or much else. Perhaps a little spice but that's about it. The taste is mostly dry malt, some fresh leaves some other flavors of nature in there. The mouthfeel is medium, It's drinkable and worth trying again. I was better than I expected.","Knapp85","Apr 18, 2011"
3.57,-2.2,3.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"A dark but clear rosey mahogany color with an off-white/grey whimpy head that fades to a ring with modest lacing. The aroma is a malty-root, brown sugar and sour mash. The flavor is sour malt and weak wheat grain goodness. But it's quite thin and watery, minimal carbonation, a bit tingly. Drinkable but not desirable particularly. I can't really pick up any other qualities, just kind of non-descript, not one I will revisit.","Durge","May 10, 2009"

3.48,-4.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Medium body at best, with a rather astringent mouthfeel. An easy drinker with the mild alcohol not really noticeable, except in the nose. Worth a try for the style and a nice re-useable bottle.","scottoale","Dec 25, 2008"
3.26,-10.7,4,3,3.5,3,3,"Poured a dark copper with a medium tan head. Lots of caramel and bread in the aroma. Flavor was dense with caramel and malt, with a bitter end. No hops, mostly sour apple. Some fruitiness, with a heavier than expected mouthfeel. Its okay, but not worth doing again.","magictrokini","Dec 05, 2008"
4.33,18.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Appearance is crystal clear, deep chocolate brown with ruby red highlights and a rocky off-white head that lingers for only a moment or two to settle in a thin layer. Aroma has bready malts with notes of milk chocolate and bread dough along with some faint flowery noble hops. The taste is very complex and it took me nearly the whole glass to nail down all the flavors. Up front I'm hit with sweet chocolate and bread dough. Through the middle I taste those flowery noble hops and hazelnut. Then in the finish is a distinct sherry-like note. Medium to medium low mouthfeel makes this highly drinkable and the restrained carbonation compared to most other German lagers I think really helped bring out the robust flavors. I really enjoyed this beer a lot and I'm upset I didn't pick up more bottles. Oh well, I guess I'll have to buy more!","beerkittycat","Nov 16, 2008"

3.46,-5.2,4,3,3.5,3,4,"I bought this in a 0.5 liter bottle that had a resealable top, like grolsch. It pours with very little head, which went away quickly, with no lacing. Very dark brown. It has a nutty smell with hints of sweetness. And the taste is similar, with malt. Medium carbonation. This is my first try with an altbier, so I have no others to compare it to.

3.71,1.6,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Appearance is deceiving. It looks a lot heavier than it really is. The color of cherry coke, with a thin white head that slowly dissipates into an even lacing. It has a very subtle aroma, similar to that of a traditional Scottish Amber but with more of a sweetness. It's a full-bodied taste that goes down incredibly smooth. Has a relatively mild bitterness in the aftertaste and a watery mouthfeel. Not quite enough "uumph" for my personal preference, but I certainly can't put it down. This is a genuine beer-drinkers' beer.","jmscott","May 03, 2008"

The smell of this beer was sweet at first then I thought a little skunky possibly. The taste at first was watery but then I came to tase a little nuttiness, maply spicey taste. I first said no then changed my mind to YES I would buy this beer again. kind of a wishy washy reveiw but this beer got better as I drank on it.","Minkybut","Jan 02, 2008"

3.65,0,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Darkish brown, with mild yeasty and malty aroma. Taste like a subdued barleywine,a bit of a season, and an understated maudite.Nuttiness, herbal, and creamy carmel. Easy drinking. Nothing bold and exciting, but a fine brew. Well carbonated with no significant head.","Sammy","Nov 17, 2007"

Enjoyable brew in a style I loved in Germany and very hard to find locally.","srrn","Sep 04, 2007"
4.02,10.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"This is fine and delicate altbier. Do not expect the hop level in this guy to match an American double IPA or anything. Instead, approach this like you would a piece of antique furniture. The more you allow this one to grow on your palate, the more it appreciates in value. Would make a fantastic session beer in some dark, hidden-away German bar. Might go great with dumplings or struedel.","Atlas1","Sep 04, 2007"

2.97,-18.6,2.5,3,3,3,3,"Bottle courtesy of Plucier: Poured a clear deep brown color alt with a small foamy head with limited retention. Aroma of light roasted malt with some light toffee. Taste is also dominated by some light roasted toffee notes. Body is really average with some medium carbonation. Im not sure I am totally getting the style since I dont encounter it often enough but I thought this example was generally boring.","Phyl21ca","Aug 14, 2007"
2.96,-18.9,4,3,2.5,3,3.5,"Despite the disappointment, it does have a certain smoothness, especially as it warms that gives it a certain drinkability (for the one bottle, but wouldn't rush for more). Well, I wasn't crazy about the Bernstein - which this has a certain similarity too.. and this was even blander...I would stick with the weizen of the three offerings I've had from this brewery. Overall- a disappointing alt from Germany - expected better...","jwc215","Aug 12, 2007"

3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Deep chestnut color with a great tan head on top. Great looking beer, really. Moderate malt aroma. Slight caramel smell to it. Malty flavor with a decent nutty flavor.

4,9.6,4,4,4,4,4,"As beautiful a color as I've seen in a beer. Head doesn't quite live up to it, but my god what a color. Deep, dark mahogany visible through the small amount of light that permeates. Smell of toasy malt and light hops. Hallertau is at work here, and doing a real nice job. Taste is just a little smoky in addition to the aformentioned characteristics from the nose, this with a nice hop finish. Mouthfeel, though velvety is a touch sticky. Still, the verdict here is two thumbs way up. 10 bucks a sixer is a little crazy, but you're paying for that fine packaging and the cool bottles. Would love it if more American micros would enter the ring with this style.","jeffjfindley","Jun 22, 2007"

3.63,-0.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"The alt poured a cola like brown color with a tan head. The head was decent, nothing special, but left very nice lacing. It has a malt sweetness to it, caramel & toasted. The taste is of caramel malts, a bit nutty, a bit dark fruit. A nice fizzy mouthfeel, crisp. A very drinkable brew. I am not very familar with the style but I like it.","Gmann","Dec 25, 2006"

3.16,-13.4,4,3,3,3,3.5,"Half-liter swingtop, with a best-by date of 88.10.69, which doesn't make any sense no matter how you look at it. It opens with a loud "POP!" and pours a chestnut hue with medium carbonation and a fluffy, two finger, light tan head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is grainy, with toasted and caramel malts, fruits?, paper?, and some sweetness that is a bit too prevalent. It tastes essentially the same, with spicy, leafy?, and freshly-cut-hay hops that leave a mild bitterness on top of a light body that leaves light finish. Overall not a bad brew, just not that great. Balanced, yes, but they need to beef up the both the malts and hops.","mmmbeer","Dec 11, 2006"

3.76,3,4,3,4,3,4.5,"Pours dark, almost like a coke, with a light tan head that leaves a ring of lacing on the glass. I looked at the label "unique hoppy altbier" and thought the hops were gonna rip my tongue off or something, not so. To find the truth turn the bottle around simply "water, malt, hops" simple things are good though. It has a sweet caramel malt nose with a bit of hmmm is it fruit or chocolate. It is kinda hard to tell after inhaling concrete dust today. Now for the taste, nice and malty in the front with a hint of hops taking over. This is a very smooth and drinkable beer. Pardon me while I have another. Skoal!","SudNut","Oct 14, 2006"
4.3,17.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Opinion: I really like this beer, and am rather glad that it doesnt have the hoppy bite that I thought it may from the label. This beer comes across a bit like a Dunkel, and I am hard pressed to pick up the Alt character. I am really enjoying this beer, and would certainly drink it any time that I get the chance. I would just not expect an Alt, but a well crafted dark beer.","SkeeterHawk","Oct 08, 2006"

Talk about nice, dar reddish brown, nice sticky head, sweet malty backbone that is almost nutty , but certainly bready. It finishes nice with a pperfect mix of hops. The more I drink altbiers the more I like them, but this is definitely a great Alt that should be enjoyed by everyone.","RushLimbmalt","Oct 01, 2006"
2.68,-26.6,2.5,2,3,2.5,3,"Has a nice deep ruby/ medium clear brown. But no bublles and no head. Only a 16th of an inch after the pour. The first snikks are very acidty and battery head liek.

Pours to a dark brown with hints of red, thick tan head that lingers awhile, and decent lacing. Unfortunately, the beer goes downhill after this. Flavor is okay, more malt and hint of chocolate, but a very thin body and watery finish makes this a less enjoyable beer at the end than at the beginning.","kimcgolf","Jul 25, 2006"

The beer itself was a dark brown with traces of red when held to the light. Medium body. Not hoppy at all although it describes itself as hoppy on the label. Well balanced, bread like nose, with floral hints. Very easy to drink, not at all like traditional alts from Dusseldorf but still a very easy drinking brew. Highly recomended.","JohnY","Jun 19, 2006"

Bready, biscuity caramel malt is complemented by some light fruity hops and a hint of German lager yeast. Medium body and good carbonation carry the flavor well.

I thought the malt may have been toasted a bit. The campfire dryness in the aftertaste gives it away. bitter notes hit the palate later as the beer warms up. This is a well balanced beer and I enjoyed it more towards the end every time. I don't know what the serving temp this is recomended at but I'd say 55 was perfect.","DogFood11","Aug 26, 2005"

Nose is thinly of malt. the mouthfeel is disappointingly thin and unsatisfying. Notes of chocolate, bananas, caramel, fair Alt, but too lacking in body, malty character and mouthfeel for my liking.","Billolick","Aug 02, 2005"

3.83,4.9,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours deep mahogany, a really nice looking beer. Some frothy off-white head with decent retention and lacing. Moderately carbonated. Looks like a heavy beer, but isn't. Smell consisted of light-medium sweet malts with hops and a hint of alcohol mixed in. Taste was a good balance of light caramel biscuity malts paired with a solid hop. Pretty good, rather refreshing, I'd drink it again.","aquatonex","Jun 04, 2005"

The taste is also of nice dark roasted malt and not very much hop presence. Also has a nice sweet malt aftertaste. Mouthfeel is kind of thin but refreshing. This is a good beer but nothing that special. Drinkablility is good. Not sure I would seek this beer out again but I would drink it over many other beers.","ddarden","Jun 04, 2005"

3.89,6.6,3.5,4.5,4,3,3.5,"I mainly bought this beer so that I could use the bottle for my homebrew, but also because I am starting to try my hand at more german styles. I have had an alt before, but wasn't too impressed. This one was pretty solid and nice style change to mix things up. The color was medium brown with a copper glow. The head was really not there. The aroma reminded me a lot of an oud bruin. There was a doughy, rotting fruit presence. The taste was a crisp malt with a nice hoppy backbone. The mouthfeel was a little thin and kind of left you hanging, but it was still refreshing. There seems to be a bit of dryness to the finish, but it pairs well with this beer. Nice alt!","ALESwhatCURESya","Feb 04, 2005"

3.83,4.9,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Brew is presented in a 1 Pt 0.9 FL OZ swing top bottle with a best before end date on the back although I am not 100% sure how to read it. The number is 881050? Anyway  I digress! The brew pours to a deep brown color with a huge head that has very good retention and leaves thick chunky lacing at the top and nice rings as you get further down the glass. The aroma of this brew is very heavy on the malt with some fruit and nut like esters that go very nice with the offering. The taste is good, extremely smooth and has a cream (?) like characteristic. The malt dominates the taste of this brew with a roasted flavor but I can also notice a hop like characteristic along with a smoky nutty taste. Over all I feel that this is a pretty good brew, one that some of my less adventurous friends might take a likeness too? I would have this one again, but it would not be one that I go out specifically to get.","Stimack","Jan 16, 2005"
3.38,-7.4,4,3.5,3,3,4,"Pours a deep brown chestnut color with a firm offwhite head that leaves a decent lace. Aromas consist of carmelized sugars, toffee, and a slight nutty bread like tone. Initial flavors start off quite malty with tones of toffees and caramels along with a slight bready quality to it. There is a slight metallic taste in this brew, I'm not sure if it comes from the water or something else but it does take away from the overall flavor. The finish is bright and sweet, with a nice bready and caramel flavor to it with a decent bitterness. Overall a decent alt but there are way better out there..","bigbeerdrinka","Jan 12, 2005"

The aroma is serious caramel, slightly malty, and a little hops. Taste is grainy and a little bready. Initially theres a moderate sweetness, but the beer starts to dry out in the mid-taste. Medium body and fairly drinkable. Theres a nicely balanced hop finish as well. Overall, its a fairly good Alt.","Suds","Jan 08, 2005"
3.28,-10.1,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"0.33L (11.2 oz.) stubby bottle. Schwelmer Alt pours a crystal clear ruby/brown. Head is tan in color, creamy and dense with moderate lacing. Aroma is caramelized grains and toasted nuts along with an odd semi-metallic, hard water-like note. Flavors are of soft sweet wort, caramel, multi-grain bread and subdued spicy, earthy hops. Metallic notes soften but the body also weakens as it warms. Not a bad brew but probably not something I'll go back to. Of the Schwelmer Alt, Bernstein and Pils, the Pils is the clear standout.","John","Dec 20, 2004"

Aroma is light, of caramel malts and slight hops notes. Taste is initially of full caramel malts, fading to a slight fruit tang, and then ends with a mess of somewhat metallic bitterness. Mouthfeel and drinkability are are affected by the end of each mouthful, unfortunately, since it was nice until then. Potential, yes. Follow-through, no.","ppoitras","Dec 08, 2004"

Nutty, slightly hoppy aroma is followed by a flavor full of nuts, wood and a bit of cherry. This would be quite tasty except that the bitterness at the end is a bit awkward and mixes with a slightly sour aftertaste that keeps it from being as enjoyable as it could be.","aracauna","Nov 18, 2004"

3.24,-11.2,5,3.5,3,3,3,"Tawny port brown, topped by a fairly chunky, creamy head. Aroma is of malt, pretty big on the Munich. There is a hint of milk chocolate and some dark fruitiness. Considering the aroma it is relatively light in flavor in the mouth. Big, toasty malt flavor comes across as a little oxidized. Hopping is nice, slight vegetal flavor and lingering bitterness. Aftertaste is a little nutty, but this is neutralized by a metallic, hard water flavor that is pervasive throughout this brew. Also, there is a slightly tart quality that seems to come out as it warms. Body is pretty light, and carbonation is fine but intense.","yen157","Oct 11, 2004"

Taste is also very pleasant, small carbonation hits the tongue, the malt is low. Metallic notes and fruitiness in the towards the end, also some hop bitterness in the finish. Still pretty smooth, and at that abv, you can make a sesseion of them. Nice to see another German Alt available on our shores, keep 'em coming.","PatandDavid","Oct 04, 2004"
