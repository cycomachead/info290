4.23,4.2,4.25,3.75,4.5,4.25,4.25,"BOD 10/29/14.   Pours a clear medium amber with a rich garnet cast.  Normal head volume, exceptional lacing and normal retention.  Light nose of biscuit with a bready background over a light caramel.  As it warms, earthy noble hop notes are present. Heavy light body with a bit of creaminess and oiliness that produces a very smooth texture.  I've never encountered so much texture in a body this light - exceptional job.  Well carbonated with effervescence from the middle on.  The World Class flavor profile is reasonably intense, superbly balanced and a bit complex.  It begins with bready biscuit that flows into a very mild bitterness.  As the bitterness fades, a slightly sweet caramel base is noted along with a hint of nuts.  The finish is fairly clean and here is where the hop flavor comes forward, which I believe is Hallertau Mittlefruh. An outstanding Altbier.","tillmac62","Jan 06, 2015"

Its dark red appearance really lets you know your drinking a great beer, while its smell is not strong I will happily overlook this factor. Its mouth feel is amazing, probably the best of any beer i have head to date and it really tastes great.

The taste is a funky skunk malt with a bit of spicy herbal hop bitterness. There's a fermented fruit suggestion in there but overall it's just a good old German brew with a little bite that goes down easy but not entirely quietly. The feel is of a subtle but certain brisk tang for the tip of you tongue on a medium- light bodied brew. Very nice and an understandable flagship.","Durge","Aug 09, 2013"

Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, wheat, bread, and grain. The flavor was of sweet malt, wheat, banana, bread, and grain. It had a light feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly decent brew. There were quite a few nice flavors and aromas going on in this one, but it really didnât stand out over some other brews Iâve had from the same style. While this was unfortunate, it wasnât disappointing. If this one were a little more complex it could have been something special, but it just feels as if they held back some. Hopefully they will go for it in the future and truly shock all the craft beer drinkers out there in the future.","thagr81us","May 15, 2012"

The appearance is copper to be sure. The smell, missed it. The taste was good. The mouthfeel was pretty thin, like most altbiers.

Beautifully presented dark brown in the glass with amber and orange highlights (helped by the setting sun coming through the window behind it). Subtle carbonation visible. Smell was a hint of caramel malt. First sip was at first a touch sweet, but immediately shifted to a round biscuity malt with a rich hops bitterness that finished a touch dry--perfectly balanced. Easily one of the best of the style I've had.

3.85,-5.2,4,4,3.5,4.5,4,"Close to two finger head of cream white, very whipped up froth, freshness extends the head life, unusually high degree of stickiness to the lacing. Copper orange color, as brown as red in tint, very clear and there's not much fade around the rims. Very bready, yeasty nose with sourdough notes, citrus shades come and go quickly, the malty cocoa late to arrive but there, walnuts and straw, pleasingly erect presence in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, the carbonation comes in waves like the shore with the tide going out. Smooth as it holds onto all its weight, uses the yeastiness and touch of grassiness to keep an underlying prickle. The orange, lemon peel is a mild sweetening aspect, helps to bring out apricot and peach pit nuances. The malts are like malts, as in malted milk balls. It really has no sweetness for impact yet isn't close to dry. Pretty damn sessionable, strikes you as a beer that you'd pair with vegetarian cuisine, a ""food beer.""
