This is the second best Doppelsticke Alt I have ever had next to only the mighty Uerige Doppelsticke, the brewery and beer that created the style.  Uerige Doppelsticke and this beer are the reason I practice brewing Alts, if I could ever brew one that tasted all the lines of these I would consider myself blessed.","mikeyv35","Sep 12, 2014"

3.95,0.8,4.5,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Not as sweet as the smell suggests, but the hop has a real presence in the swallow. The malt provides some caramel and lighter brown ale notes. Simply put, it's complex, but drinkable. The body is richer than some alts but not noticeably so. The carbonation is quite muted, making the beer quite full. The aftertaste is a good blend of black pepper (hop) and brown bread toast (malt).","smcolw","Jun 13, 2014"

A tad weak in the mouthfeel, a little too fizzy, but nothing major in the grand scheme of things. Well-rounded and relatively light, so knocking back a bottle or two would make for a nice session episode. A very nice German ale.","beergoot","May 22, 2014"

For the sake of practicality, I'd probably not revisit this anytime soon, but it still stands as a well made and ambitious beer for what it is. A strong, monstrous doppelbock flavor-wise - one of the strongest that's readily available on the market!","magictacosinus","Sep 30, 2013"

4.05,3.3,4.25,3.5,4.25,4.5,4,"This one pours a medium bodied dark raisin brown with a very creamy, two finger beige head. The nose features sweet and somewhat fruity dark malt with a certain creaminess. The flavors are much different. It is malty and does have some dried dark fruit to it but it then goes into a dry, leathery earthiness indicative of only a few old ales. After a few sips I can't help but think this beer drinks like a crazy Irish Dry Stout/Old Ale/Wee Heavy hybrid. It drinks very, very smoothly and is full bodied enough. It drinks somewhat stout and is pretty dry. It isn't boozy by any means but it does drink like a beer of higher alcohol content, hard to explain but it drinks big. Overall this was a spectacular beer and definitely worth a try if you're into old ales, wee heavies, or alt beers.","aasher","Mar 28, 2013"

4.21,7.4,4.5,4,4.25,4.25,4.25,"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours hazy toffee brown with some visible ruby red light on the bottom of the glass. There's a creamy, thick white head that retreats slowly. Some nice lacing is left down the side of the glass during consumption. The beer smells of brown bread, caramel, and some woody and earthy hops. There's maybe just a hint of nuttiness. The flavor is about what you would expect from the nose. I get that nice brown bread and caramel maltiness with nutty flavors and those woody and earthy hops providing some balance. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is pretty high for a beer beyond 7% ABV. There's a nice mild lingering aftertaste. This is an excellent beer, but only just so.","acevenom","Jan 27, 2013"

The taste of the beer is also quite smokey. The malts add some depth to this beer with the mixture of bitter hops in there also. The mouthfeel of the beer is a little on the heavier side I thought. The carbonation is pretty good too. Overall this beer is pretty good if you enjoy smoked malts, I'm not a huge fan of them but it was still a pretty decent brew.","Knapp85","Jul 25, 2012"

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Served in a stem glass, a dark brown liquid, seemingly opaque, but more translucent as it got to the bottom; a creamy tan head retained well and left nice stratified layers of doily lacing. Aroma was very toasty and roasty, nutshells and malts. More of the same in the taste, toasted nuts, roasted malts, light raisins, peppery yeast, generous herbal hops, and a subtle cocoa quality that came out more as the beer warmed; bready and bitter finish. Medium body, though maybe a bit heavier than your "typical" altbier. Very nice overall.","Rifugium","Mar 18, 2011"
