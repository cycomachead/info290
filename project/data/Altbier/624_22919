3.84,4.3,,,,,,"On-tap. Pours a lighter brown color. Tan head. Smells malty and Germanic. Flavor is yeasty with dark grain, dark bread and caramel. I enjoy the Altbier style and this one seems to fit right in line, although my experience with the style is mild at best. I loved its light body. One of the first craft beers I have ever tried but had it again and it sparked some nostalgia.","VelvetExtract","Nov 22, 2014"

It stayed intact the whole time, which doesn't seem to happen very often. Not much lacing though. Smell had some nice notes of brown sugar and caramel. The flavor was dominated by malt.

3.63,-1.4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Out of a bottle purchased in Lancaster, NH this ""German Style Brown Ale"" was a deep garnet/ruby red color with three fingers of tan head. The retention was good as a small cap and the lacing sticky. The aroma was of toasted malt and dry grains. The flavors were similar, very dry and neat, toasted malt and hoppy bitterness in a good balance. Not complex, but on-point for the style. Rather acidic. The mouthfeel was a little oily, the body medium and the carbonation par for the course.","thekevlarkid","Feb 02, 2009"

A touch of ale fruitiness hangs faintly in there, no notable hop presence - but the bottle dates to march 08, so I suppose that's to be expected.

This is a very nice beer that pours a dark amber slightly cloudy color. It is quite carbonated with a slightly soapy tan head that hangs on and laces nicely. The smell is a nice balance between malt and hops, perhaps a bit nut brown or chocolatey hints in there as well. This beer is exceptionally creamy, quite mellow, with soft caramel and nut flavors, and a nice balance. The taste is mellow, perhaps slightly tilted to the watery side, but there are plenty of roasted notes in the flavor to keep it interesting. Between the prodigious carbonation, the creamy mouthfeel, and the light brown tastes throughout, you can't go wrong. There is a bit more hop in the finish, but this is just a really laid back type of beer that would suffice for all occasions. L'Chaim.","albern","Apr 12, 2008"

Taste follows the smell, but adds a hop bite in the finish. Medium thick creamy smooth mouthfeel with adequate carbonation.

Three-quarter inch off-white head, slowly dissipated into quarter inch layer of foam that retained its volume through the session. Fair amount of lacing with decent consistency throughout the tasting. Nose presented with roasted malt and hops. Taste similar to nose with addition of a slightly floral aftertaste (slightly bitter) at the finish. Nicely effervescent mouthfeel and low abv makes this a good session beer and a slightly different alternative to an English or American Brown Ale with slightly more emphasis on the hops than the malt.","Jwale73","Mar 08, 2008"

4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"12oz brown bottle with a cool picture of a winter climber braving the headwall. Best before month notched on label. Beautiful brown color with lots of fluffy head that stays and sticks. Very tiny sediment keeps it from being perfectly clear. Smell is a wonderful blast of fresh and clean toasty malt. Devoid of fruitiness in the taste as an alt should be; the clean malt flavor dominates. Hops are to balance and lead into a lime-like finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and leaning towards creamy. Most of the alt beers out there are of a copper color with a medium crisp carbonation, and this one is brown and smooth but still retains that clean malt alt beer characteristic. It's uniqueness is a reason to seek out, and it's flavor is a reason to keep going back to it.","mshallah","Jul 06, 2007"

4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"pours a chestnut brown with a white fluffy head. good residual lacing. smells of malt and sweet yeast. the taste is really well balanced. good bitterness all the way through. nice malty characteristics. nothing overpowering, balanced is how i would sum this beer up. very dead on for the style, another beer to make new hampshire proud.","scarletfire79","Mar 23, 2007"
3.83,4.1,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a dark reddish-brown color with a wispy head. Malty aroma with a bit of toastiness. The roastiness comes across in the flavor in a big way, followed by a bit of hop twang. As others have noted, there is a bit of a tea flavor that shows itself between the malt and hops. Pretty well balanced and not overly sweet. I don't know if it's a good representation of the alt style, but it's a pretty tasty and enjoyable beer.","LarryV","Mar 05, 2007"
3.45,-6.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"The flavors of an Alt are present, but are limited by the dryness and carbonation. A decent version of an Altbier, but not my favorite depiction.","NEhophead","Jan 11, 2007"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"A good take on the altbier style... pours a clear, chestnut brown body beneath a creamy head of light tan. The head retention is average, and it drops shortly but leaves some nice lace before it goes. The body is medium and it has a delicate, fine-bubbled median carbonation. The nose is malty with a delicate note of caramel, and that's true for the flavor as well. It's not meant to be complex, just balanced. Solidly bitter, as it should be. It lingers on the tongue with some mild residual leafy hop notes and a dull bitter note. Enjoyable. Probably worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Nov 11, 2006"
4.18,13.6,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"This altbier poured a clear, chestnut red-brown color with creamy, fluffy, tan foam that slowly settled, and clung and coated the glass. The smell was malty with a touch of caramel. The taste was lightly malty, not sweet, with moderate hoppiness coming through, and a touch of yeast. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium body and smooth carbonation. The aftertaste was light lingering malt and mild hoppiness. This was a very nice, German style altbier.","UncleJimbo","Nov 11, 2006"
3.73,1.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This was a dark brown beer with reddish highlights. It had a thick coffee-colored head. Nice looking beer. It had a roasted grain aroma, and I thought a touch of nut. Taste was sweet caramel, malt, a bit hoppy, and again a touch of nut. A heavier beer than it looked; a couple of these at a time would do it for me.","lordofthewiens","Nov 04, 2006"
3.71,0.8,4,3,4,3.5,4,"A very good brew and one I'm pleased to have picked up on a whim. It can't hurt that I got a free pint glass out of the deal. It looks like this brewery only has a few offerings thus far; hopefully that will change in the future.","durandal","Sep 29, 2006"
3.41,-7.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Drinkability is OK. Two or so go down well. Not really a session brew, as the metallic flavor tends to build up rather than fading.","ghostwalker","Sep 16, 2006"

3.68,0,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Deep coffee amber color, thin head that leaves a frothy crust. Aroma of lightly toasted, cinnamon nut and coffee bean. Taste is a robust, toasty biscuit like flavor that fades leaving a slight bitterness toward the end. Less complex than the aroma suggested, but a flavor that makes it easy to drink. Medium body with soft, foamy carbonation. This one drinks pretty well, but could use just a bit more excitement to make a session ale out of it...","bennetj17","Aug 20, 2006"
3.6,-2.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Medium brown on the pour, hazy with small flecks of yeast floating about. Generous, fizzy, almond flesh head, settling into a thick film. No lacing. Floral hops are readily apparent in the aroma, with grainy, slightly roasty malt. A bit chocolatey. The flavor opens with grainy malt, just a bit charry and chocolatey. Fairly clean, with some ale fruitiness, perhaps a bit too much for an authentic german alt. Everything from the fatherland seems to be clean as a whistle. Lighter medium body, with sturdy carbonation. Pretty easy drinking. More of an american brown ale with altbier traits. Nevertheless, it's a tasty beer. Grainy through and through, with robust floral hops in the finish. A touch of citrus, giving it that american flair. Moderate bitterness, a little bit of metallic flavor in the end, finishing clean and dry. Very much a darker american ale, rather than anything german, reminding me of mid 90's microbrews. A little rough around the edges, lacking refinement, but that's what you like about them.","UnionMade","Aug 14, 2006"

Overall, highly drinkable and light.","","Jul 05, 2006"

Palate is likewise - quite malty and bread-like, with only a slight hop presence. Enough to make the finish relatively dry and keep the mouthfeel from being cloying. To me, there is nothing exciting here. It's okay, but it doesn't stand out in any way. I could taste any number of brown ales that would be very similar, and can think of several that are much better.","beerphilosopher","May 26, 2006"

All the classic components come through one at a time: citrus, hops, (coriander?- nah, it couldn't have been-what is that I'm tasting?) but the slightly malty finish wraps it all up in one clean punch.
