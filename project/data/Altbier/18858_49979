3.79,-3.3,3.75,3.5,4,3.75,3.75,"Enjoyed a few pints on tap at the Irish Times pub in Victoria, BC. A clear red-bronze amber beer with an inch or so of white head. Nose is quite fruity, almost evokes some banana along with mealy apples or pears, light molasses, vanilla, soap, and a characteristic noble hop floral note. The aroma was a tad estery for the style but pleasing enough. The style guidelines do translate quite well on the palate. This is a crisp, dry, bitter ale with some citrus, toasted caramel, and mineral notes. Very quenching and tart, with rather minimal sweetness (although I do get a hint of molasses kiss candy or perhaps saltwater taffy). Sourish crab apple, bitter orange peel, herbal bitters, and gooseberry flit in and out, is that some American hop in the form of faint grapefruit and pine? Fairly high carbonation and thin, well-attenuated body that reminds one of a lager. Finishes quite clean, with a refined bitterness and echoes of citrus and chalk. Really quite a wonderful alt even if the nose threw me off for a moment. Classic session brew that drinks well but manages to hold one's attention over the course of several pints.","CalgaryFMC","Feb 05, 2014"

This is an easy drinking brew, a little light for some tastes, but it's well-made. That said, the criteria is- is it the world's finest microbrew Amber Ale? No. Still above average? Yes.

Aroma of toasty, bready malt and grassy hops. Taste follows, with toasty bready malt and grassy, slightly pine hops and a bit of nuttiness. Finishes with a crisp hop bite. Light to medium bodied.

4.3,9.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Crooked Coast Amber Ale pours a deep orange copper with a fluffy offwhite head that leaves thick lacing on the glass. The aroma is malty, warm toasted bread with some herbal hops. The beer has a great malty flavor, without being too sweet. More bready, lightly toasted malt, with a bit of caramel and a solid but light to moderate hop bitterness. Some nice light spicy hop flavor balances the malt really nicely. As a hop head, I'd looked past this beer a lot previously, but I'm really glad I picked it up!","ericj551","Jan 09, 2011"

4.33,10.5,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This beer pours a very nice looking copper orangey-red with a bubbly, two-finger head that leaves some very pretty lacing on my glass. Some really nice piney, citrusy hop aromas emanate from the foamy head with good hits of caramel, cinnamon, clove, and even light touch of orange-chocolate. Taste is buttery and bready up front with the citrusy hops coming in mid-sip resulting in a buttery and incredibly nutty, dry finish with slight hints of apricot too. Fantastically balanced, complex and smooth. Mouthfeel, again, is silky smooth with a good amount of creaminess and displays a crisp, dry, spicy finish from the hops. Wow, having tried the other offerings from this brewery, I was expecting to like this beer - I had no idea it would be so complex and well-balanced. This is an outstanding ale from an outstanding brewery. I highly recommend this beer to anyone who can get their hands on it. I know I`ll be buying it again. What a treat!","Graham5161986","Jul 29, 2009"
4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a clear orange/amber, thick light tan head forms, slowly drops to a thin layer, some nice chunks of lace stick to the glass. Smell is nice, very malty, some toast, apricots, orange, nice and floral, some light fruit, caramel, lightly sugary, tea like hops, real nice. Taste is nice too, tea and lemons, orange, toast, caramel, apricots, touch of iron, quite fruity, dry and toasty in the finish, nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation, very drinkable stuff. A real nice amber ale, thanks Eric!","Viggo","Jul 26, 2009"
3.72,-5.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"While this is still a decent beer, I can't help but be disappointed. Driftwood is an amazing brewery, but this is my first miss from them. It seems to be missing the earthiness from an alt that helps balance out the fruit and bread, and I also feel like it needed a touch more hopping. Well worth a try, though. Cheers Eric for the bottle!","bobsy","Jul 19, 2009"
3.95,0.8,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"D: Interesting, but a little rough around the edges. I wonder if it would mellow with a little more cellaring.","Derek","May 23, 2009"

3.59,-8.4,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"Fairly light body, goes down easy. Nothing really screams amazing to me (and I have grown to think that of some of Drifwood's brews) but it's quite drinkable and would make for a good summer switch-up. The flavors are quite unusual (to my palate) and a bit challenging but I feel that it is nice to see an unusual style and still have a quite drinkable beer.","ritzkiss","0"
