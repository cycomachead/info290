"Seems too aggressively hoppy for this beer."

"Has an english bitter quality to it. Good malty flavor. Not bad."

"Well..., the Nazi Panzer tank just rolled over Double Bag like it was a modest pothole!  Hail to the authentic German Doppelsticke!  This is the second best Doppelsticke Alt I have ever had next to only the mighty Uerige Doppelsticke, the brewery and beer that created the style.  Uerige Doppelsticke and this beer are the reason I practice brewing Alts, if I could ever brew one that tasted all the lines of these I would consider myself blessed."

"Excellent medium, smooth and relatively lively body."

"through on the aftertaste.  Very interesting German outside of the norm."

"Not as sweet as the smell suggests, but the hop has a real presence in the swallow. The malt provides some caramel and lighter brown ale notes. Simply put, it's complex, but drinkable. The body is richer than some alts but not noticeably so. The carbonation is quite muted, making the beer quite full. The aftertaste is a good blend of black pepper (hop) and brown bread toast (malt)."
"o: The hops at the end were a bit much but this grew on me more and more as I drank it."
"If you run across this one- grab a bottle. If you like beers with a robust flavor stance you won't be disappointed."

"A nice malt-forward beer featuring a toasted, slightly burnt sugar flavor character. A tad weak in the mouthfeel, a little too fizzy, but nothing major in the grand scheme of things. Well-rounded and relatively light, so knocking back a bottle or two would make for a nice session episode. A very nice German ale."

"Overall- Almost a really good beer. I think the slight burn from spices and woodiness makes this beer come up short but otherwise, it was very enjoyable. I would definitely give this a try. One of the more enjoyable Sticke alts I've had."

"O: This beer is hearty, to say the least. I like it."
"I did not expect the licorice notes at all, but it's at least good to see a change of pace on the doppelbock and altbier style for once. For the sake of practicality, I'd probably not revisit this anytime soon, but it still stands as a well made and ambitious beer for what it is. A strong, monstrous doppelbock flavor-wise - one of the strongest that's readily available on the market!"

"O_Pretty tasty overall and a nice well done Alt"
"Overall not bad but not what I'm used to for altbiers. Bit too much on the candy syrupy caramel toffee like flavors, decent hops at least, bit too strong ale like."
""
"An interesting experiment, but not so pleasant to drink. Overall it's sweet and bitter. From the 500 ml bottle bought at Bine and Vine in San Diego."

"O - Overall, not a bad beer. A touch too smokey for my likes when it comes to this style."
""
""
"The beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a mostly smooth, slightly foamy mouthfeel. Closes semi-dry, with moderate stickiness remaining on the palate after a sip."
""
""
"Overall, pretty good, and unique. I'd have it again."
"This one pours a medium bodied dark raisin brown with a very creamy, two finger beige head. The nose features sweet and somewhat fruity dark malt with a certain creaminess. The flavors are much different. It is malty and does have some dried dark fruit to it but it then goes into a dry, leathery earthiness indicative of only a few old ales. After a few sips I can't help but think this beer drinks like a crazy Irish Dry Stout/Old Ale/Wee Heavy hybrid. It drinks very, very smoothly and is full bodied enough. It drinks somewhat stout and is pretty dry. It isn't boozy by any means but it does drink like a beer of higher alcohol content, hard to explain but it drinks big. Overall this was a spectacular beer and definitely worth a try if you're into old ales, wee heavies, or alt beers."

"Poured into a glass mug. The beer pours hazy toffee brown with some visible ruby red light on the bottom of the glass. There's a creamy, thick white head that retreats slowly. Some nice lacing is left down the side of the glass during consumption. The beer smells of brown bread, caramel, and some woody and earthy hops. There's maybe just a hint of nuttiness. The flavor is about what you would expect from the nose. I get that nice brown bread and caramel maltiness with nutty flavors and those woody and earthy hops providing some balance. The body is medium with moderate carbonation. The drinkability is pretty high for a beer beyond 7% ABV. There's a nice mild lingering aftertaste. This is an excellent beer, but only just so."
""
"overall this is a very good unique beer that stands tall amongst other alt beers that I've had. does its job as a hangover beer right now going down at 7.5%. would definitely purchase again"
""
"O: This beer is an enjoyable take on an altbier given its added amounts of malts and hops and the subtle amount of smoke in the aroma and taste."
""
"O: This is a very enjoyable beer, and interesting twist on a traditional altbier but still very good. Easy to drink though a little too high ABV to be sessionable."
""
"4.0 D: I've been really impressed with this brewery and this beer is no different. Above average throughout."
""
"Pretty good beer and certainly an interesting take on the style. I prefer versions from Uerige and High Water, but it's still fun to find another doppelsticke."
""
"O: Not your typical Altbier, but definitely a drinkable brew."
"This beer poured out as an amber color, a creamy looking white head on top. Has a good retention and lacing. The smell of the beer has a surprising smoked aroma to it. The taste of the beer is also quite smokey. The malts add some depth to this beer with the mixture of bitter hops in there also. The mouthfeel of the beer is a little on the heavier side I thought. The carbonation is pretty good too. Overall this beer is pretty good if you enjoy smoked malts, I'm not a huge fan of them but it was still a pretty decent brew."
""
"Served in a stem glass, a dark brown liquid, seemingly opaque, but more translucent as it got to the bottom; a creamy tan head retained well and left nice stratified layers of doily lacing. Aroma was very toasty and roasty, nutshells and malts. More of the same in the taste, toasted nuts, roasted malts, light raisins, peppery yeast, generous herbal hops, and a subtle cocoa quality that came out more as the beer warmed; bready and bitter finish. Medium body, though maybe a bit heavier than your ""typical"" altbier. Very nice overall."
"Highly recommended."
"In short: a rich and complex, bitter yet sweet, spicy Altbier on pair with the best of its kind."
