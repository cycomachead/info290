"Another hit for long trail... liked this one too!"

"A hearty amber colored beer.  More hearty and hoppy and less sweet than a typcial American amber, I think this is actually an altbier."
""
""
""
"O: Overall I would say this is an easy beer to drink.  If i was introducing one of my 40 oz or Bud friends to something else this would be a great pick.  Personally I like a little more presence and bite, but this is a good well crafted easy on the mouth independently brewed beer.  The ABV was @ 5% and if I was to guess I would imagine this was the beer they brewed to introduce the masses to their line as it's a great spot on beer for just that."

"Not a lot of flavour, especially as far as the malt goes. Bitter finish that doesn't seem necessary for balance."
""
"Bright copper orange in color with just the slightest haze. Pourd ewith a firm, off white foam with moderate retention.  Moderately malty nose with a touch of caramel and light fruity esters. No hop aromas or diacetyl. Medium bodied with tangy, moderately high carbonation thorough the middle. Sweet malty flavor up front with moderate hop bitterness bitterness through the middle followed by light caramel near the end. No hop flavor. Finished semi-dryly with a light bready and biscuit flavors and a lingering hop bitterness."

"Didn't get a sense of presentation or aroma as I consumed out of the bottle.  Very full bodied for an amber with solid (but not over powering) presence of hops.  A touch of bitter about the same time the beverage reaches your stomach (I love that!).  While I appreciate that others have different expectations from an amber, this beer completely resonated with my pallet.  Will soon be pouring this into an iced mug to observe the rest of it behavior."

"For an Amber it really stands out above the rest."

"Poured a clouded orange-copper with a a nice creamy cap of off-white head that leaves slight lacing. It just slips down the wall of the glass.Big effervescent body. The aroma is almost non-existent, with just the slightest hint of malt. The body has a little more verve, with a nice malt body offering notes of bread and fruit and a little earthiness. The body has a nice fullness to it, a bite from the carbonation on the finish.  A solid alt-bier style ale."

"Been drinking it for about 12 years now. It always seemed to have this different taste which I have come to love in that old friend kind of way. This is always my go to as far as a simple everyday beer goes. Seems to pair up with just about everything from burgers to a nice pulled pork."

"Overall: I find it really easy to believe that this would be someone's ""favorite"" beer. It's easy to like and a great starting point into more experimental and craftier beers, as I noted above. It's also handy because it pairs with almost any meal. I had one with some BBQ seitan, baked beans and broccoli and it really tied the meal together. Thumbs up."

"O- It's been a while since I've had this and it still holds up as an easy drinking yet flavorful session ale. Nothing special, but it's different from your average amber ale or lager."
""

"Pours a nice oft-burnt orange color with a thin, but full head. Scents of pears, apricots, and caramel rush to the nose. Malty, musty, grainy on the first sip. A touch of tangy fruity caramel flows throughout the palate. Mouthfeel is medium. Washes down clean with a slight twinge of hops. Very refreshing and an excellent session beer. Easy drinking. Almost like a lighter version of an octoberfest. Crisp and smooth. Very well crafted."

"Long Trail Ale is an OK American altbier. Good starter craft, good reliable. I'd take a Sams over it. Not great for a flagship. Good with burgers and Burlington fare."

"not a huge amber guy, but I love me a proper altbier, and this is mighty proper. a beer ive fallen back to time and time again, and one of my favorite sessions when its ice ice ice cold. it has a dim scent of American and german malts, red and pilsener, with a crisp lager yeast right one cue, although this is an ale, it has that snappy cleanness to it, uncommon for the style, but perfect in this brew. love the barely there hop balance in the finish, almost English in that regard, with the grains being the dominant players. touch of sweetness, touch of bittersweet burnt toffee, touch of bitter hops, touch of fruity punch. outstanding feel, enough body to be a beer drinkers beer, but light enough, and brightly enough carbonated to be refreshing at the same time. if all ambers from the united states were like this one, I might set my ipa down and drink more of them. I absolutely love this beer, when, like I said, it is freezing cold. warmer not so much. a staple in my beer drinking for the last ten years or so."

"O - This is an ale that is cold fermented (lagered), and it drinks like it. This is about as perfectly as I can sum up a standard, basic ale, that isn't bad (and is quite drinkable), but is otherwise unremarkable. It doesn't stand out to me in any way, other than the slightly out of place banana aroma and flavor. I absolutely wouldn't mind having one or two of these, but I won't go out of my way for it, or purchase it over a good lager or a better ale."
""
"Overall: Looks and feels very clean but the smell and flavor leave a lot to be desired. Get their double bag instead if you have to choose. I wouldn't get this again. Not gross but not very good"

"O: Long Trail's flagship ale is admittedly only slightly above average. That said, as far as flagship ales for breweries like Long Trail go, Long Trail Ale is ahead of the pack if only in that it is unique. Rather than being a simple APA or IPA, Long Trail opted for a lesser-known, German altbier and, in Long Trail Ale, they have accomplished what they presumably intended--taking over the Vermont beer market, that is. I would never turn down a Long Trail Ale, even if I have been drinking less and less of it as time progresses."

"Overall: I guess this is Long Trail's flagship ale and I was expecting more of a traditional altbier style, but this was not particularly enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Even though it lacks in the flavor dept. this beer is so enjoyable and so easy to drink, I have give it an overall of 4.5."

"I wish the beer tasted better. I like everything about it but the flavor. It's one very basic, bitter note. I have to give this a sub par rating considering."
""
"Copper colored, thin head that quickly dissipated. A nice, strong malty smell to it. The sweet malt is the first flavor, then mild bitter, grapefruit and a solid bitter ending. A kind of up and down taste profile but it works well together. Medium body, moderate carbonation. Enjoyable overall."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A nice hybridized amber/altbier. Nicely balanced and easy to drink. Certainly one of those fly-under-the-radar brews"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A clear orange amber with a thickish head and decent lacing. Smell is sweet with some yeast and a firm toasted grain core. A healthy breadiness that offers up a caramel sweetness with light toffee undertones. Taste is quite malty with a firm leafy bitterness, some earth and a light mineral edge. Dry finish leaves more leafy hops and toasted multigrain bread crust. Feel is smooth and velvety in its carbonation. A great session ale and highly drinkable with an ability to go with just about any food you may throw at it. A solid brew"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is a very under-appreciated beer. It's actually quite impressive what Long Trail has been able to accomplish with it. They've made a relatively obscure beer style into their flagship offering and turned it into the best selling beer in Vermont. Flavorful and full-bodied, but simple, approachable, and refreshing at the same time. Solid stuff, and a good quaff."
""
""
"The Crack revealed yet another brimful craft CAN. I subsequently employed an inverted Glug, resulting in a finger-and-a-half of dense, rocky tawny head with good retention. Color was a coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose was both sweet and spicy, like malt coupled with pepper. Interesting. Mouthfeel was medium and the taste was bittersweet, a pleasant marriage of malt and hops. Some great lacing began to appear as I drank through it. Finish was tending towards bitter, so I am going to call it dry or semi-dry. Either way, it should give you some idea of what to expect. Not bad, and I am curious as to why they are characterizing it as an ""Amber"" on the CAN."

"The Rest: This is one of those beers that's Ok if you drink it fast, but if you really taste it, it isn't so good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent session beer on a warm afternoon."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Still a real solid ale but certainly not up to the high standars of the Long Trail Double Bag."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" This has a very clean yeast flavor which is good with a nice body and mild grainy malt which has a toasted, yet not quite caramel flavor with some hops adding balance, the only thing lacking is a bit more malt could have helped as it seems to be light for the style. I really enjoyed this for what it is a relatively mild alt. It is refreshing and is not lacking in flavor, yet it does leave you wanting more in the taste and aroma."

"Overall: A nice beer with a distracting flaw. I've held this longer than I should've (picked it up on a trip back east) but that didn't seem to hurt much. Nothing really to bring me back, but glad I tried it."

"A real good altbier. There's a good amount of flavor for such a low alcohol beer"

"O: An average to below average ale. I was slightly put off by the astringency but managed to keep with this one. Not a drain pour, but i wouldnt buy a 6 pack."
""
""
""
"O: I remember this being better when I drank it more often towards the beginning of college. Slightly better than average, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it, nor would I pay for this beer if most others in its price range were available."

"Light body with good carbonation. Overall not bad. This one was a left over from a gathering with a handful of friends. Not a bad beer, but not to exciting."
""
""
""
"Pours a crystal clear deep copper color with a decent sized fluffy white head that displays moderate retention and lace. Smells of sweet bready malt, toffee, hints of apricot and tangerine and a light herbal earthy hop aroma. Taste is sweet malts up front immediately followed by an earthy hop bite. Sweet toffee and a hint of butter contrasted with apricot, spice, pepper and a light fruitiness. Medium body with a dry finish, moderate to high level of carbonation with a sweet almost syrupy bubbly mouthfeel. This used to be the beer I drank when I went skiing 15 years ago, but I haven't had it in years. Sometimes when you try to go back it only serves to disappoint. Decent enough drinker, but really nothing special."

"O - Very easy drinking beer, I put back a few of these easily. Seems like the mouthfeel was a little off or the style, but otherwise, a nice, simple tasty brew."
""
""
"O: slightly above average, would recommend but wouldn't go out of my way to get it again. Overall approachable."
""
""
""

"Very smooth, easy-drinking ale. Long Trail has seemed to hone in on nice interpretations of the altbier style. Perfect for Friday night beer and pizza."
""

"O-An average boring beer. Long Trail has better offering but still nothing much to say about this beer."
""
"12oz bottle with a Bottled On Date of 091611. Pours a rusty copper color with a thin layer of head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is earthy and malty. Slightly sweet smelling with some citrus hops notes. Taste is sweet caramel malts with a bit of citrus. Somewhat bready. A bit sour near the end. Very drinkable. I've had this beer at least 100 times and never reviewed it until now, obviously. It's a pretty decent choice of beer when your at a place with a limited tap selection. Overall, a fine beer."

"needs a cigarette.. love the initial taste, color is pure. a bit of a soda pop aeration. after 3 minutes it smells better. so not too bad but the pallet ends up gritty. texture is bit foamy. makes pretzels very dry. possible bulk quantity for unexpected guests."

"You really can't go wrong with this beer. Its a great session brew or one to have after a day in the mountains."
"Clear copper in color, topped off by a short head of foam. The smell is tangy and sort of fruity. The taste is malty and sweet, finishes dry. The body of this beer is medium and works well with the taste, carbonated just right. Overall This is a respectable brew, definitely can't go wrong with it."
"The mouthfeel is crisp and clean to the mouth. Leaves nicely letting you to want more. The taste is exceptional for this type of beer. Overall we are impressed, this is a good American Ale. Enjoy"
"O: an enjoyable brew, not outstanding in any aspect but it drinks nicely and i do love long trail"
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a hazy, ruby-brown coloring with a thin, eighth of an inch, off-white, foamy head. Aromas of berry fruit sweetness, with a somewhat rich, toffee-like background. Flavors are rich and sweet, with the toffee character once again present, and a fruit blend not unlike a piece of fruitcake, with some nuttiness and sugary highlights. Very light in mouth, with a slick and substantial feel to it. The aftertaste is much like fruitcake as well...a bit of a letdown. The aftertaste is lighter than the initial palate, and the fruit characters and toffee-like body all get a tad bit watered down. The finish is light and crisp, without much of a linger. Very easy brew to drink, and not bad around a campfire."
"O: Easy drinker, good for a couple. Comes across as run of the mill non-offensive beer. I was hoping for a bit of charactor from an Altbier."
"O: Very drinkable, but not quite as good at the Otter Creek Copper Ale."
"Overall -- Really not bad, though not terribly thrilling. I can see bringing a case of this to a party. Not my favorite Alt, but still nice. Glad to have tried it."
"Overall a very tasty and highly quaffable ale."
"Overall - Well balanced, would be a good beer to offer a friend who is not into the craft brews we tend like."
"Very good. An easy drinker. A bit on the subtle side, but definately not macro-like. A good crossover beer."
"Just noticed the beer is listed as an altbier which I doubt I would've guessed."
"O - balanced; a malt-forward beer that doesn't get clumsy; though a little simple in places, there is plenty to enjoy, and execution counts for a lot; good stuff"
"D - This is a great east-coast stand-by!! I don't appreciate the last several 'B and C' grades some of the other members have given Long Trail Ale. The previous beer drinkers claim that this beer appears to be 'too-macro...' For cryin' out loud, this is one 1st beers of the micro revolution (mid 80's to early 90's) & paved the way for what everyone tastes now...was a fan in the back 'in the day' and remain one :~)"
"Overall - This was a pretty tasty beer that I could definitely session. It comes across as more of an ESB or a English pale ale than a Altbier however. For the price, it's worth a try."
"O: It's a good beer. Glad I tried it, but nothing for me to seek out in the future. Easy to drink, nothing special to remember."
"O: When the hell did Long Trail get this good? After not having one for years I had my first LTA at a relative's house last month and was pretty amazed. Way better than I remembered it, and I had to go out and buy some more to see if it was a fluke. It ain't. A great session beer."
"O: Pretty good. I haven't had many altbiers; it's been awhile since the old days of Stickenjab, and even Southampton's altbier (which I recall liking a lot) I haven't had in awhile. Non-offensive and drinkable, I can't complain about this beer. But it does nothing to impress, either."
"Overall, I find this a great ale, and I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor."
"Overall, one of Long Trails' stand out brew in a bottle, clean flavors make this very drinkable, style is somewhere between an esb and alt, but very tasty."
"O: Decent Altbier with a nice caramel balance character. Haven’t had too many altbier brews but this was pretty good and easily drinkable."
"This is a very simple beer which goes well at just about any occasion. Perfect mid-winter and mid-summer."
"Bottom line: this beer is a bitter version of the Double Bag with a less ABV. I also found this beer to be slightly more complex than Double Bag, probably due to the sweetness not getting in the way. The drink ability of this beer is also better because of this. It’s another respectable offering from Long Trail – definitely worthy of trying."
"D - Pretty enjoyable, and definitely sessionable. Well rounded and tasty, I'll have to remember to pick up some more of this one."
"Copper brown color, no head or lace. At first taste I thought this beer had some very lager-ish qualities. There was not much complexity, however it was smooth with a slight hop flavor. The Hoppiness came out more and more with each sip and overall this beer evolved into something I could drink again Easy to drink for a beer if youre looking for something different that a summer beer. Couldnt beat the price either."
"O - Great session ale. Perfect balance."
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are a bit light and unremarkable. It does not feel watery or empty, it is felt like it needed a bit more of a kick."
"Would like to do this side by side with Shiner's Old Time Alt, which I enjoyed..."
"O- Nothing especially outstanding, it went down a little too easily to be taken seriously on my part. It's not terrible, just a little too basic for my taste."
"Pours a light amber with a small off-white cap that didn’t stick around too long. The aroma is of light caramel, almonds, and some earthy hops. Not overwhelming nor overly pleasing. On the palate, this is a nice little drinker. Earthy notes, caramel, with some almonds in the mix. Very similar to the nose. A smooth, easy drinker with a clean, dry finish. A touch of bitterness, just to let you know it’s there, lingers on. Overall, I found this to be an extremely easy beer to put back. Crisp and smooth and a decent option in a pinch."
"AVERAGE, NOT A MUST HAVE!"
" pine like bite and dry finish left you thirsty at the end of it. Some nice malts mixed in as well as a decent amount of sugar. Super light and crisp, absolutly perfect for a summer day. Really impressed with the taste here. Really good, and quite suprised actually. This one really had quite a smooth feel to it. Lots of carbonation rippled through nicely and a somewhat slick, but not that bad of a feeling. It was just light enough to really be a good drinker."
"m/o: super clean and crisp, the carbonation seems spot on which i am pleased with after seeing how fizzy it looked when i first poured it. all in all, it's nothing crazy, nothing special, but this beer is one that i could bring over a friend's house and know that everyone would like, not to mention more than adjunct lags. just personal preference but i wish i had a little more hop to it."
"O-as may have said, pretty good from start to finish"
"Very drinkable. An interesting alt as for the style goes. As far as a beer goes its not very complex and its simplicity is nice for drink-ability but otherwise makes me a little bored with it. I probably won't have it again but if you want something to take hiking or fishing, this one would be pretty nice I think."
"Mouthfeel is clean and crisp, making this rather refreshing. Overall, for a beer I've had a thousand times before, I still enjoy it just as much as I did the first time. Nothing to exciting going on, but refreshing and enjoyable with a low ABV too!"
"This beer is a good summer session. Not much going on but easy to drink."
"Serving Type: On tap at the Wobbly Barn in VT."
"D: I could keep drinking this beer all night long; it goes down very easily and is quite sessionable."
"This was a very easy drinking beer, though it was fairly light, I expected something with a much lighter flavor. I wouldn't mind having this again."
"(from notes - tasted Sept 2010)"
"pretty easy to drink, it's a decent everyday beer."
"12oz. bottle served in a stange. Pours a translucent copper with a 1.5 inch, bubbly/frothy, white head. Head eventually dissipates into a bubbly band - some spots and clumps of lacing present during the tasting. Nose is rather faint - just a suggestion of light, toasted malts and an earthy hops presence; perhaps a trace of caramel. Taste follows nose, with the addition of a delicate floral character that expresses itself towards the middle. A bit of diacetyl is also apparent in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium, with an even carbonation. A light acidity presents towards the start, and a slightly oily texture comes out towards the middle. I'm not overly familiar with the style, so it's difficult for me to make a style informed evaluation. That being said, I found the brew to be simple, well-balanced and easy drinking. Not something I would seek out on it's own, but a nice addition to a mix pack."
"Its more interesting than I expected."
"Overall this is a very drinkable, pleasant, sessionable ale. A good flagship offering from Long Trail. This brewery rarely lets me down with their brews."
"M/D: Light to medium bodied, the carbonation helps this one out. Very smooth. Overall, very middle of the road, not great, but not terrible."
"12 oz bottle. Pours amber with a huge off-white head, intense lacing and carbonation. Aroma of grassy hops with caramel malt in the background. Medium, tangy body with grassy, earthy hops, caramel malt and hints of citrus fill the mouth. Long earthy, dry finish. Nice session alt."
"Drinkability: A thoroughly drinkable and exceptionally sessionable ale. If this were more readily available, I could see it becoming a regular session beer for me. Easy to drink, easy to enjoy..."
"Pours a hazelnut-brown color with a white head and a touch of lacing here and there. The nose is some light earthy hops plus a bit of light grain and bread. The taste is really mild as well with a bit of grain and some lightly-toasted bread. Feel is a bit light with adequate carbonation. Very slight amount of bitterness. Drinks decently enough but I'm not terribly impressed."
"Exceptionally drinkable. This is one to have around for any occasion and any guests."
"Good altbier. Not much really stands out on this offering. It's not that it is bad...just boring I suppose. I'm not crazy about the yeast profile in this one. Has a bit of a bite in the aftertaste. Not bad, but not anything to write home about. Their Double Bag Ale is better. Pass on this one."
"Drinkability is high due to the refreshing nature, lighter mouthfeel, and desirable aftertaste. A good beer for having a few, but nothing profound."
"an easy session beer, but nothing very special here. i got this in the survival long trial variety pack, otherwise i prolly wont seek this out again."
"D: Although nothing that's going to blow your socks off, it's quite drinkable; it was pretty easy knocking back a few of these, watching football; a nice, crispy beer."
"D: Not overly complex but a decent beer that could easily be sessioned if you enjoy a beer with more malt flavor and just a taste of bitter hops."
"Drink well my friends"
"A good offering from one of my favorite breweries."
"Long Trail is a beer that you don't go out of the way for, but if you see it on tap it is nice go to beer. You won't go wrong with this."
"Drinkability: I would likely limit myself to 2 or 3. By that point, I would be ready for a new taste."
"Drinkability: Meh, it's ok. Easy to drink, but I don't think I'd pick it up again."
"A rich mostly clear copper brew with a standard quarter to half inch head from a tap pour. Light tan head, stable thick layer, leaves a ton of thick sticky lace. Smells of mixed resiny pine and candied orange rind carry through to the taste. Finishes with a lingering bitter kumquat. Mouthfeel is dry with adequate sharp carbonation. Crisp and tasty, a worthy and enjoyable brew."
"Drinkability - a very light beer i could have a couple of these for sure."
"The feel of this beer is light with a good amount of carbonation. It goes down easy and has only a slight bitter mouth feel at the end."
"D - A fine ""non-descript ale"" indeed ! I would definitely have a couple of these."
"D - Not a great beer, but not a terrible beer either. Has some very pleasing qualities that can be accessible for a new-comer to craft beer. Nothing to sneeze at. I'm looking forward to trying some other Long Trail beers."
"Served in a pint at Joe Sent Me in Waltham. Reddish tinged, golden, with a bit of a head with some resultant lace. Malty aroma, with no clue as to the hopping. Balance, maybe leaning toward the sweet/malty side. Some of the hops come out in the finish. Medium mouthfeel."
"Pours transparent reddish-orange hue with white head that dissipates quickly. Weak aroma of sweets, light syrup, spices, malt, ginger bread. Spices, ginger bread, cinnamon, burnt malt flavors, light hops but they stay vague. Light, slight spritzy body that is very drinkable for an afternoon brew."
"D - Not something I would personally look for again, but a solid beer nonetheless."
"D - It's a fairly drinkable beer. It's pretty easy to sit down and have a couple. This was my first taste of Long Trail and I must say I was a little disappointed. Perhaps I expected too much. I can't really see myself buying this again. Though, I still would like to try more from this company."
"Ranks a pretty average beer, I like the taste, pretty unique in my opinion for a lager, a good base beer for Long Trail to work off of, but nothing spectacular that would keep me buying this on a regular basis, but still a solid brew."
"A real good New England beer. Good taste, easy to drink."
"This is a beer which is better on draft, if you can find it. Good from the bottle but not as good as on draft."
"taste is really swee , hoppy and rich. Honestly it's a great beer. Vert rich mouthfeel with a real strong wheaty and malt flavor. great beer"
"Now I'll lay feelings and probably biases to bear....As a native Vermonter I love the Long Trail Ale. Walk into any bar in VT and chances are you'll find this on tap or in the cooler at the local store. But, despite it's saturation in the Vermont market it's a damn good beer to boot! There's nothing in your face about it, but the balance and drinkability is spot on perfect, and it's low ABV means you can enjoy several without too much worry of alcohol's less desirable side-effects. There is no occasion, season, time, event that I can think of that Long Trail Ale wouldn't be suitable for."
"All in all, if you're into craft beer, avoid this brew. Nothing special at all. This would be good for mainstream beer lovers. If you like brews like Bud, Coors, and Michelob, then this is for you. Otherwise, avoid."
"D - The balance on this beer is like one perfect up and down of a see-saw, with the malts on one side, and the hops on the other. I swear, there's something about Vermont water that makes beers from there seem cleaner and fresher tasting. A wonderful session beer that can be enjoyed all day or night long."
"- Overall this is a fantastic representation of the style, and recommend it for anybody that likes a rich, flavorful, and rather light drinking session amber."
"Poured from a 22 OZ. brown bottle, says ""Take A Hike!", and you know this beer does make me want to go on a hike through the woods. A beautiful amber/light copper color with a decent head that leaves quickly, love this color. Smells hoppy and grassy with a light caramel sweetness. Love it. Tastes very well balanced, toasty malt, spicey hops. I could drink a few of these, a good medium feel with decent carbonation. Just a good new england amber ale. Of course i will be getting this again."
"D - A bit on the malty side for me. I'd prefer a blackberry wheat or an ipa from long trail over this one anyday. Not bad though."
"Pours a crystal clear copper color with a rather small white head that settles into a light ring. Nice color, looks like a liquid penny. The aroma is of bready malt with a tea like sourness, some metal and a touch of lemon. The taste is of the bready malt but not much of the tea sourness, light brown sugar and an earthy rust characteristic. Finishes with a light bitter hop. Moderate body with very fizzy carbonation; sweet overall but fairly balanced. An easy drinking brew, nice flavors with a low ABV."
"I first reviewed this from a bottle. Tried it from a can and much better. Yes, that can was from woodychandler. Has a caramel color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is a bit malty, bready. Taste is nutty, malty, some breadiness. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
"Got this at the Whole Foods store on draft and was more excited about it than I ended up feeling after i drank it. Color was an average brown golden, not great carbonation, decent aroma and ok flavor. I like Alt, like i do many german ales, but this is not one of my favorites. Nonetheless, worth getting on draft if you can."
"Pours a clear amber color with a finger of slightly yellow stained head. Slight bit of lacing and retension is lacking however it maintains a thin lace on top of the beer. Nose is a nice blend of faint hops, malt and some caramel notes. Taste is sweet with grains and a slight bit of spice hop character in the finish. It is a very clean and refreshing brew. Medium light feel and medium to high in carb. I havent had many altbiers to compare this one to but it's not bad. I would drink it again."
"D- Very enjoyable ale from Long Trail. Surprised in a good way."
"D - I could go for about 2 or 3 of these."
"D: Very refreshing, highly sessionable. Glad I tried this at the party. Would definitely drink it again if choices were limited, as they were at this party."
"D- Very refreshing, better when I had it in the brewery's bar"
"taste is a pleasant, well-balanced ale that brings out what the nose barely hinted at...neither malts or hops dominate, but are equally present. nice. nothing crazy, but a solid offering of this style. perfect balance (again) of carbonation and viscosity make this quite the drinkable brew that would pair with many foods and go solo with ease."
"Beer is bland and smooth. Light body and goes down unmemorably. Too bad. I was looking forward to it."
"Nice beer."
"D: Well, this drinks well but I kept asking myself if it was something I'd want to have again. I don't think I would. This is a very clean and well made beer but it was pretty boring. Not bad in any way, just, well, yawn..."
"D- A very nice and refreshing session brew from long trail. I'm stating to think that they enjoy going with very Euro style products after having this and a couple other of their beers."
"This beer is incredibly drinkable. It's something that you could easily stick with for one night that wouldn't challenge you, but would also stay interested. I'm shocked that this beer is listed as 6%. This beer should be required at every bar and restaraunt in New England, right next to Sam Adams as an excellent introductory craft beer that anyone can dig."
"Drinkability - Top notch session ale. Goes down smooth with a nice amber malt aftertaste."
"Overall, this is just a simple, good beer. As beers get more and more complex and imperialized these days, it's good to sit back and have an old fashioned, simple amber ale like this."
"D: This is a decent ale that goes down smooth. I could easily drink more than one of these at time. Not the most flavorful ale, but solid nonetheless."
"Cheers!"
"d- nice and refreshing, sessionable, this is my first altbier not too sure what i was expecting, but from the description on here i think it fits, it's delicate and not overly complex but very drinkable."
"D - Pretty damn downable. I went through a metric shitload of these that weekend."
"Not too bad, but a little on the boring side."
"Had a decent look to it. Dark orange and almost amber color. Had an off-white colored head that sticks around half the drink. Some ok lacing to it. Smelled kind of grainy with toasted malts followed by a gentle smell of hops. The taste was very pleasant. Tastes much more hoppy than the smell does, then followed by grain and toasted malts, very nice. Feels nice on the pallet, very refreshing, and I found this beer very drinkable. I consider this to be a very reliable beer from Long Train, however I'd consider it to be much more of a summer or spring beer. A good stand by to have for a cookout, but nothing overly special."
"Drink is decent nothing spectacular maybe I could give it a try some other day."
"D - Not a bad brew but I wouldn't seek this out again. I've had better altbiers and better from Long Trail."
"Cheers!"
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into an ale glass. Two fingers of light tan foam above amber ale. Smells like slight hops with a hint of roasted grain. Tastes like I believe a good Altbier should taste. Feels in the mouth like an ale that encourages you to retun to your glass to sip again. Very drinkable, I've enjoyed several of these and will continue to in the future."
"D- Not one of my favorite beers; just not very memorable overall."
"Drinkability: Forgettable and easy to finish. I'll be passing on it in the future."
"D - This is a pretty good beer. I was surprised to find an altbier and I enjoyed it."
"This ale is an example of the micro brew revolution spawning mediocre ales with poor quality ingredients. The hops taste stale and are obviously of an inferior grade. The lingering aftertaste is just plain bad, at has metallic notes akin to Beck's lager. The drinkability quotiant is very low, I had trouble finishing one."
"Drinkabilty: I would definitely have another one. It is a good beer, it's something that would be a go to if you're not looking for something very complex or heavy, just a basic beer."
"i really liked this amber ale.. when poured it had anice head about one and a half fingers.. nice copper coloring and smelled sweet and malty.. taste was great just the right amount of hops and great taste not over powering.. nice lacing.. great drinkablity you can do a six pack in one night and feel great to take a hike the next day... cheeers"
"NOTE: Reviewed Live/Real-Time at the Golden Rail"
"Nice and refreshing palate. Maybe a bit simple. At the same time, not really watery. Subtle hoppy characters flourish throughout the palate with an earthy flavour underpinning it. It's quite mild, really, with a bitter, clean finish. Palate though isn't all that complex, and apart from the noticeable bitterness, the cleanliness and subtlety remind me of an English ale. Very drinkable though."
"Drinkability: An above average brew, and one I enjoyed, though I'm not sure I'd be real excited to try it again."
"This is a surprisingly good brew for a larger microbrew. Pours a clear, copper-straw with not much head. Carbonation is well evident in appearance and taste. The smell is pretty light on this one, don't expect much here. As for the taste, the best way I can describe it is as ""grain tea."" Neither hops nor alcohol seem to play much, if any, role in the final taste, but the malty taste is quite enjoyable. I could drink these all night. An excellent session beer at a reasonable price."
"Good drinkability. Nothing here is going to overwhelm the palate. Alcohol isn't too high, nor is it noted in the taste. Good balance."
"Overall a pretty sessionable brew. I could see myself in some dive bar in VT that had this beer putting them down all night since the only others on tap would prob be macro."
"Pours a amberish-copper color, nice head with minimal retention, decent lacing here. A quick whiff shows off a nice amount of spiciness from the malt, a bit of fruit aromas are peaking through. Taste is of caramel maltiness, very sweet on the tongue, with a small amount of dry hop in the finish. Malt is really the star of the show with this beer, a very toasty malt profile makes this one a nice medium bodied brew, with good carbonation. Sits nicely on the tongue without getting too wet. Overall, this is the classic LT and it shows why, it's got a nice maltiness and is easy to session."
"12 oz. bottle with 021308 (production date?) on the bottle; sampled 7/3/08. Brewed with two-row, wheat, crystal and chocolate malts, hopped with Northern Brewer, Willamette and Mt. Hood. Pours a crystal-clear amber, with relatively high carbonation and two thick fingers of khaki head. Pretty clean aroma, with a nice maltiness that lends notes of buttery caramel and a touch of chocolate, backed by a light dosage of hops. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with wheat, caramel, and leafy, spicy, lightly earthy hops that lend a nice bitterness. The body is lightish, tingly, with a dry finish. Nice altbier; not in the Dusseldorf vein, but distinct and tasty. Almost the definition of session beer in my book - it's simple, flavorful, low in ABV (4.6% according to the website) and easy to drink."
"T - Medium mouthfeel with a sugar sweet start, a roasted malt middle, and a dry hopped finale. Good ""belch"" factor. Mild and fresh. Something I would have again."
"Pours a clear light amber color with 3 fingers of foamy off-white head. Good retention leaves some decent lacing stick. Smells of fruits, caramel, biscuit, and lightly roasted malt. Tastes of caramel, toffee, apple, honey, biscuits, and roasted malt with a citrus rind bitter finish. Medium light in body, smooth and mild. Nothing too extreme or memorable, but a pretty drinkable alt style."
"Thanks to a friend for sharing his mixed case. This is a nice, earthy (hops, we're talking about) amber ale. Dry biscuit, caramel, and toffee malts are matched with peppery, earthy, grassy Euro hops. There's a hint of vanilla diacetyl (no buttered popcorn), but this is otherwise a pretty clean beer. Certainly a fine session ale."
"Pours a three finger white head that fades slowly and leaves a good lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Malty nose. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Flavor has some malty sweetness but there is a hop bite. 12oz bottle part of 12-pak $10.99 Market Basket Concord, NH."
"Overall, you could pound these (flavor-intensity wise), but there's not enough strength to make you want to repeat. It was a party beer offering, and I'm done with it. Wouldn't refuse one, but wouldn't seek it."
"Bottle brought back by a traveling neighbor. This beer pours a clear amber-orange color with a thin and foamy light beige head. Thin sheets of lacing. Light roasted malt and fruit aroma. Light, smooth body with sweet caramel and malt flavors and just a touch of bitterness. The finish is sweet and the malty flavor does not linger long. Overall I would not have pegged this as an Alt at first blush, and knowing that is the target style causes it to lose a little favor with me. Still it is an easy to drink beer if nothing else."
"Pours with a somewhat weak head, breaks apart across the surface, does leave some thick lacing behind though. Dark amber to red-brown in color, very good clarity with active bubbles throughout. Sweet roast to the nose without malt domination, pine, fresh forest breeze, light dried honey, some salinity alongside hop, wheat, rye notes, texturally equally favors breadth and penetration. Light to medium-bodied, stronger carbonation keeps it active and adds to overall mouth presence. Sweeter here with oats, toffee, honey, never that malty though. Conversely, the hops, rye, pine, mineral water aspects incline things more towards truncated linearity. Seems intentionally watery, as in ""stream water freshness."" Granola and oats smooth out the finish further. Real easy drinker, friendly from the first sip to last."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinking beer. Potentially a good gateway beer."
"This is a clean finishing, crisp beer, whose saving grace is the honey notes found in it but is otherwise it needs a serious dash of flavor to bring it to Altbier standards."
"D: This is a good session beer - combination of abv, balance/finish and taste (not real big, but not boring)."
"An average brew in my book. I'd drink it if it was there, but I wouldn't reach for it on the shelf."
"D - This was a very drinkable beer for me...I'm looking forward to tasting the other Long Trail offerings"
"Probably wouldn't search it out, but would drink again."
"6/4/7/3/13 (3.3/5)"
"One note: The bottles are labeled 6% ABV (BA's description says 5%)."

"The one review that was on the other side of the page from the Simon Pearse tasting on Park Avenue a few weeks back. Thanks to this site, I learned of the style of the beer while sipping in a standard plastic sampler cup. Appeareance was partially cloudy light red with orange tints with an impressive dark tan head that laced even in the sampler cup and kept a full cap. The nose was gentle on the nose with toasted grains and small doses of hops. Taste follows the nose with the toasted aspect, but I sensed something different from what I've tried in the past and attribute to the style. It's mellow on all fronts by design Herbal essence through out and spiced clean and dry background. This being my first alt, I enjoyed Longtrails version and for better or worse shall be my benchmark going forward."
"This beer poured brown with reddish highlight and a fluffy single-figner cream-colored head. The smell is mostly malt with some floral hoppiness. The taste starts off with some toasted caramel malt that gives way to some hops in the middle and ends pretty clean. The mouthfeel is a little watery and the carbonation is a little aggressive, but still makes for a crisp brew. This is a tasty little beer that doesn't sit too heavy. I've had a couple at a time before without even noticing."
"Smooth and clean, this is an easy drinker with a light body that I have no problem rolling around in my mouth before the swallow. Nice session brew indeed. Nothing special, but quite solid all around."
"D- Overall not unpleasant but not something I would seek out or pay top dollar for."
"Fits solidly in that inoffensive, no one will love it but at least no one will hate it category. A ""safe"" beer which is probably why it's on tap everywhere."
"D: It was well balanced and tasty. A good session beer with a low ABV and nice clean finish."
"the long trail ale pours with a an amber color and a decent head. smell is a mix of hops and barley. the long trail ale is an ale I keep coming back to again and again. it's just a good solid ale that doesn't disappoint and is a good match with many foods and seasons."
"Notes: Overall it's an all around good beer with wonderful drinkability."
"A great session beer right. A lower ABV, awesome taste and mouthfeel, and a good price. Long Trail takes on a lesser known style here by making an Altbier as their flagship, but it tastes great. One of my favorite beers to go to when I'm not sure what to get."
"Pours a deep amber with a creamy three finger head. Visually very pleasing! Smells of herbal and spicy hops with a hint of dry toasted malts. Taste is a nice herbal/medicinal hop flavor and bitterness followed by a sweet toasted malt with hints of honey, a very clean finish. Felt nice and full in the mouth. Overall this is a nice beer and a nice take on a German altbier."
"Drinkabiliy - Yummy , very drinkable. I think I'll have another, thanks!"
"Please try...your taste buds will explode!"
"Don't drink and review."
"Notes:An o.k. beer. I suppose I would have it from time to time during the summer."
"Nonetheless, a good solid session brew that's pretty versatile with food."
"medium brown in color, almost like a very dark walnut. soft head. dissolves rather quickly. i like that about it. very smooth. almost watery. but not so much that it doesn't linger on the tongue. not very bitter. more so than sweet. very drinkable. i would be hard pressed to pair it with a food. it seems to stand well on its own. you could pretty much drink it with anything. so not much stands out."
"I ordered this on tap at an authentic Connecticut Mexican food joint. I've had this before but this time I paid attention so I could review it. It came to me with a very thin head that vanished quickly and left no lacing. It was a light copper color and looked carbonated. Smelled of mild hops and malt and certainly didn't excite the sense of smell. Mouthfeel was light and fizzy and the beer went down easy. Like the smell, the taste was lightly hoppy and malty. No real taste of alcohol. It did go quite well with the Tex-Mex dinner and I ordered another glass. It went down smooth and easy with the jalapeno guacamole. I enjoyed it."
"Sort of middle of the road. Amber-brown color, small head, not much lace. A bit of a hoppy sweet flavor but pretty much ho hum. I was a little disappointed but it's not bad at all. There are others in the same category and pricepoint I'd rather have but Long Trail as a while is pretty solid."
"Pours a clean copper/ orange-ish color with a light tan head. In the aroma, saaz hops and somewhat lager like. In the taste, saaz hops, and a small roastiness of malt. A smooth and medium mouthfeel, with a small maltiness in the aftertaste. OK ale, nice hop presence, but nothing spectacular."
"Sampled at the brewery in bumble-F, Vermont. Poured a pleasant copper color with a thin white head that fizzed out quickly. Some lacing of the thin ring around the rim. Smells of some spice and piney hops. Flavors of the same hops some toasted malt, earthy hints and slightly herbal. Pleasant mouthfeel, medium carbonation, smooth. Nothing stunning but a good flagship Ale and great for pairing with food."
"D- Very sessionable right here. Decent offering from Long Trail. Don't expect anything extravagant, this is not it. Nice beer!"
"D: All the factors of flavor and mouthfeel make this a very drinkable beer. A very drinkable beer that also has a nice flavor profile and is not too filling? Yes, please! I will have another."
"This is one of my favorite beers locally on tap. High drinkability and still a great ale. A great beer for a steady night of drinking."
"Long Trail's Double Bag was a better depiction of a true Altbier in my opinion, but this one still satisfies..."
"Over all good beer. Nothing really jumps out to make it great but it's still a very well balanced beer."
"D: nice attempt at an Altbier. It is very drinkable, and I have enjoyed several of these before. good session beer."
"Crystal clear with a bright orange colour. Fine bubbles of off-white foam left clumpy and streaky lacing on the glass as the cap fell to a thin skim. Malty aroma, bread crust and a bit toasty. Moderate bitterness with some fruity esters and herbal hops, mostly toasted malt in the flavour. Medium to light bodied, smooth and creamy. Easy drinking, nicely balanced."
"My first from this brewery. I snagged a 12'er for a vacation up in cottage country. I'm glad I got it as this will make a nice one to hit down by the lake. It's got some nice body, but not filling by any means."
"Bottle- Deep transparent copper pours an eggshell one finger head. Nose of caramel and bread crust, spicy, floral hops and rye. Tastes of bitter hops and subtle caramel malts. Spicy notes lead to a slight fruity component. This is a very well balanced, easy drinking beer. One that I would purchase regularly if it were available to me locally."
"D: Highly sessionable beer. I really enjoy this one."
"12 oz bottle into a tulip. Pours a nice dark orange with a huge pillowy off white head with an aggressive pour. Smells of sweet malts and a touch of pine. Taste is a smooth, sweet malty start with a clean finish. Classic flavor. Tastes like many good english ales. One of my all time faves and very drinkable, over and over."
"Pours a clear amber color with lots of little bubbles rising up the glass. The one finger white head consists of lots of little bubbles also, dissipates quickly with little lacing. Caramelized malt, grapefruit and some floral aromas are present. Up front flavors of lemony/tealike hops lead to some subltle malt that continues to grow in strength until it returns to the lemon/tealike hoppy finish, nicely balanced. Medium carbonation, medium body, it leaves a creamy mouthfeel with a tart ending. Good drinkability, the tart ending balances the sweet malt in the middle begging you to come back for another sip."
"It's a pretty enjoyable beer. Solid, easy to drink, quite flavoursome and light enough on the palate to drink a few. It doesn't rock my entire world, but I could see it rocking a small part of it on occasion."
"Had a few on tap last Saturday at Devlin's in Brighton Center. Poured on tap into a pint glass, there is a noticeable lack of carbonation or head. Very watery looking. Smell was minutely spicy. There's a bit of hops in the taste, but overall just an average ale. The one thing that I do enjoy about this beer is that is it very smooth and drinkable, as I find most LT beers to be. Very easy going down, and also pretty decent with food. A good brew to have out at a bar having a few while watching a baseball game."
"I like this beer because I feel that it has a little something for everyone. It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn good."
"This bottle poured a clear copper color with an average white head and average lacing. The aroma was of caramel and slight herbal hops. I got a charcoal caramel flavor with mild citrus hop and brown bread. Very drinkable, nice carbonation, fairly thin but not bad for a peppery refreshing ale. A pretty dependable choice in bottles or on tap."
"Came home from CPR training the other day only to find a case of this sitting in my living room. My dad asked me if I liked this stuff, as he got a case for a very cheap price, to which i replied, ""yeah, this shit is pretty good!"" Pours an amber color, with a good dosage of light lace heading. Aroma is of toasted grain, some mild fruit, buttery diacetyl, and a medicinal presence like bandaids. Taste is an impreovement, with bits of grape, graham cracker, honey and pumpernickel bread. Feel is on the light side, bordering on medium. Long Trail has quite a session brew on their hands. I went through four while watching the Bruins get slaughtered by Montreal. Anyway, a good brew from Long Trail that works for pretty much any season during the year."
"12oz bottle. Pours a clear amber-red body with a half inch of off-white head that dissipates rather quickly. Smells malty initially but gives a fair bit of American hops in the aroma also. Tastes equal parts malt and an American hop bitterness - grassy, piney, with some citrus. Light to medium in body with ample carbonation and a semi-clean finish. Reminds me more of an American Amber than an altbier. Either way, a very tasty drinkable beer. I can see buying this one on a regular basis."
"Pours an orange amber color with a short and medium bodied off-white/tan head thant settles to a small amount on top of the beer. It smells like very sweet malts, some honey perhaps as well. The taste is a sweet malty taste with a hint of honey and then a nice hoppy bitter at the end of it. The mouthfeel is nice and crisp and refreshing. The drinkability is ver good and this is a nice beer."
"This is an ale you could bring to a cookout. It's an easy drinking ale to share with your friends. It might not blow them away, but it won't scare them away either."
"Like Sam Adams Boston Lager, this is one of my favorite ""transitional"" beers for the uninitiated. Pry the can of Bud out of their hand and put a bottle of this there instead. It'll be familiar enough not to be worrisome, but of a high-enough quality to get them thinking about what they drink."
"nevertheless, a pretty drinkable beer, and sessionable too."
"This one might be a good beer to get people starting on craft beer as it is available on tap all over New England and is pretty easy drinking. That being said, it has a lot of great qualities that might get people to appreciate good beer more."
"Another sample from the winter pack. The appearance of this one is not bad: dark amber colors with a good thick, foamy head. The smell is a bit light but malts can definitely be sensed. The taste is spicey and sweet. A good, medium bodied carbonation gives it a solid support with its malts. I wish this Vermont brewery's staple beer had more punch to it, but overall this is a pretty solid beer."
"Aroma is a light amber with a big head from a fully high pour that is bubbly rather than creamy. Looks appealing. Aroma is faint, sweet malts, certainly an ale, nothing offensive but nothing groundbreaking. Certainly nothing was added (dry hop) to make this beer have a notable aroma, but that's cool in and of itself... Flavors are mellow like the aroma, mild both in malt and hop flavor. It's not too sweet like say, bass, which is good, so the hops, while gentle for an American beer, are still noticeable. This beer is bland cold, but when it warmed it revealed an interesting toastiness to compliment the gentle hops. The flavor was too weak when cold, and enjoyable but just shy of flavorful once warmed. Very approachable beer. MF is light, not watery on the tongue, but far from even medium bodied. Don't know much about altbiers, but as an amber ale it's very drinkable, but I probably wont stock it unless its for other people in hopes I can find better, though it's rather good. Must not drink it ice cold for the full experience. It's thirst quenching, conversational, and well balanced, so not for those craving an extreme beer."
"Very drinkable. I had about four of these before I realized it. Had to switch off, because it gets a little boring."
"Pours a clear amber. Some tan head off a pretty firm pour, but still not much. Nose seems so muted, I can't seem to pull anything off it. Flavor is light and crisp with what might be just a touch of apples on there. The skins I think, actually. Sweet tang hits me in the back of the mouth. Feel is nice. Standard liquid feel, nice carbonation. Drinkable, yes. I just can't say that this is an unbelievable altbier at all."
"The bottle has an artistic scene from a Vermont river, you ain`t in the city anymore. And once poured into a glass, it is a pure golden color with a foamy head. Once sipped, it tastes quite nice with a good flavor of hops. And the Ale from Long Trail is quite drinkable and especially nice in the cold New England weather."
"D- Easy to drink a few of these, would definitely buy again."
"picked up their vermont sampler 12 pack ; pours a med. copper-gold w/ a slight head which dissipates quickly leaving little lacing in my nonic ; has a malty, slightly diacetyl smell w/ some hops lingering about ; a crisp flavor from the onset, followed by a ""creamy"" malt flavor, some hop flavor present as well as a butterscotch-like diacetyl a faint metallic taste at the finish ; a dry light-med bodied brew, the co2 makes it a little thicker than the flavor, though ; all in all a good drinking beer, i definitely would have this again..."
"Drinkability: Alot of people say there is nothing special about this brew but I have many craftbrewed ales that you couldn'r pay me to drink again. My girlfriend loves it and I can drink it all not because its not BOLD."
"Drinkability- A decent beer, nothing spectacular, overall decidedly average."
"Looks like a normal amber beer. The smell is pretty ordinary and nondescript. nice smooth finish, but taste very similar to something I have had before (not sure really what). Not too hoppy and not too weak. A good smooth balance. I have 3 of them from a 12pk mixer, but I wouldn't want a whole case of them."
"Supposedly this is an Altbier, but if you blindfolded me, I'd say I was drinking Yuengling. Not that that's such a bad thing, but I was expecting more from this beer. It pours clear amber with a short white head, and tastes of thin malt and some sourness. Not much hop flavor at all. Try Long Trail's Double Bag instead - now that's a good (sticke) Alt."
"This is a good beer and not very strong at all.That makes it good and you can have a few.Nice beer."
"Poured a light brown color, little head that dissapeared quickly, and many carbon bubbles running up the side. I was not too fond of the smell: a little bit of sweet malts and a light hop presence, but overall I found it to smell a little macro and to be a little bit soapy (I made sure that it wasn't because of the glass). The taste, however, was deliciously crisp. A solid balance: a smooth, malty taste right up front, which gave way to a earthy, piney, pleasantly bitter sting of hops that lingered on in the aftertaste. Light mouthfeel, well carbonated, and tasty: I could have easily put down a few more of these."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, even though I like Double Bag better, this is a good beer to stick with for an evening. Since there are so few good Altbiers available, this one will hit the spot when you’re in the mood for the style."
"I was drinking this when it came out in the 90's but haven't had it in about 10 years until recently. Their IPA used to be my standby. The altbier Ale is a good, sound ale. Good balance of malt and hops, with trademark ale malt-sweetness present. The finish is clean as mentioned in previous reviews, and that's a good thing in the land of heavy amber ales. The ale yeast is adding a distinctive fruitiness. Somewhat over-carbonated, but that's true of most American ales (bottled anyway). For the price (11.99/12) it can't be be up here in NE...neck and neck with Dundee's offering's from the ol' Genny plant."
"I like this altbier from Long Trail, though their Double Bag is a little more up my alley, as it's more potent. But for a different session ale with more complex flavor than a lighter ale or lager, you can' go wrong with this one."
"Pours a clear copper with a solid sticky head. Nose is muted fruit, a twinge of metal, malt and floral/herby hops. Overall, it's solidly flavoured, but not smooth and not in-your-face. Well balanced malt vs. hops with a dry graininess and light toast. Neither light nor heavy, this beer is moderate in viscosity and also carbonation. Very nice and exceptionally drinkable."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1"" beige head over the clear dark amber brew. Creamy head lasts nicely, and leaves heavy coating froth in its wake. Aroma is minimal yet balanced. Taste is biscuity malts upfront, slightly tart in the middle, and closes with sedate hoppiness. Mouthfeel is impressively smooth, which helps make drinkability easy. A pleasing, widely distributed beer in the Northeast."
"This is one of the better beers coming out of Long Trail. It is an amber ale with a nice off-white head, good retention and lacing. This is a light bodied lale eaning towards medium on the heartiness continuum. The smell is indistinct and inoffensive ... hardly an enticing descriptor. The taste is malty sweetness, some nutty flavors, perhaps a bit of molasss or caramel as well. The hops are quite subdued and this creates too much of a cloying taste that compromises its drinkability. I wouldn't call this a session beer, in part because of the too prevalent imbalances. The aftertaste is very light, the mouthfeel watery. This is a very middle of the road American ale produced by a medium sized Vermont brewery worth supporting."
"This was an okay beer, but not one I will rush out to buy again anytime soon"
"Tastes is also neat and well put together. Sweet, a light hoppy bitterness and a fairly dry finish. I could drink this all day long, to bad I only have two left."
"Overall this a very good brew, it's a smooth mild tasting beer with a light body,thats easy drinking and well balanced."
"D - I was surprised by this style. It's, to my knowledge, the only Altbier I've had, so I found it a bit disconcerting that such a light ale comes in such a hearty package. Actually, as I'm thinking about it (and the ale in question warms up my stomach), I rather like that about it. The perfect compromise for the beer-drinker that likes a dark, local microbrew (this being a Vermont staple) but also appreciates the populist sessionability of, say, a Beck's or Heineken."
"D: High. You could throw this one down for days on end. Easily drinkable. A good standard ale."
"Would love to try it on tap."
"Pours a nice clean/clear golden amber color, nice carbonation, nice small fizzy head, some sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is mostly malty, slight hop, and caramel. The taste is malty, some hops pop through, lots of caramel. The finish is dry, and slightly bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, a nice little brew, glad to have had a chance to try."
"very drinkable. easy going beer."
"Copper brown with a tight white head. Lacing sticks to the glass well. Not to much of a nose on this beer although some hops come through. It is a good tasting beer with some balanced hops and a slightly bitter finish, nothing over the top. A bit over carbinated, but overall it was balanced. This is a easy drinking good tasting beer. A bit standard, but inoffensive and a beer that could be had again and again."
"overall, i was suprised with how much i liked the standard long trail ale. it's a great balance of flavors. this is one i will try again soon."
"The brew pours a light, golden color with a modest head. The appearance is unremarkable. The smell carries a little fruit, along with a slight malt aroma, a bit of toast, and a little grain. Not much hops in the aroma, but they do come through in the taste. Its a sweet beer, with a light body and a little effervescence. The brew is balanced, and the finish lingers with just a little hop bitterness. Its nothing to cheer about, but its a worthwhile brew."
"Pours a nice reddish-golden brown with a nice fluffy white head that lasts awhile and some good lacing. Has a nice malty and slightly nutty smell with hops in the background. Taste is nicely balanced. Nice nutty, malty and hoppy flavors intermingle. First comes a nice nuttiness which is soon joined by a nice malty profile. This blend of flavors then combines with a delightful hoppiness in the finish. Mouthfeel is good, nice medium body, moderate carbonation, very clean and smooth. Drinkability is very high. This is a nice smooth, easy-drinking, well-balanced brew."
"This beer pours a copper color with minimal foam that recedes quickly. The aroma is fruity with some hints of malt. The taste is somewhat the same with the exception that there's some harshness left on the tongue. Still goes down quite smoothly and the malt becomes apparent. Very drinkable for an altbier. Simple and yet, elegant."
"Drinkability - Short clean finish, with just a bit of lingering malt and hops. Overall very balance. Could drink a few of these. A good session beer."
"The taste is really quite refined and dellicious. Although I haven't had any German altbiers, it's easy to believe that the Long Trail folks have made a convincing example of the style. There is a hint of sweet malt at first sip that quickly gives way to a dry tanginess. An excellently subtle balance between toasty dry malt and restrained hops that carry on in a long dry finish that has some subtly spicy notes of cinnamon and allspice, even wood. Extremely drinkable, a great session beer you won't get tired of drinking. Impressive to me, I doubt this is an easy beer to make."
"Very nice-deep golden color. I think it needs more bubbles but that might be me. No real aroma-sort of lacking in that department actually. Very slight caramel sort of smell. Malty flavor dominates-quite smooth and creamy with just a touch of bitterness. Good full mouthfeel to it. Decent overall. Makes a nice change from all the ""double"" or ""imperials"" of every style going out there."
"It is drinkable, sessionable, low abv (it says 5% here - it says 4.6% on their website). Whatever, you can have a few of these with food and not feel overly full."
"Drinkability - Not a bad beer, could drink another one of these. I guess I have to, since I bought a case for Longtrail"
"Pours a copper color with a large and bubbly head, leaves good lacing. Mild aromas of malt, floral hops, and sweet fruit. Nice and smooth flavors in here, sweet malt, mild spice and fruit/nut with a touch of hop bitterness make this a very drinkable and enjoyable brew. Definitely sessionable."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability--Goes down real nice. I'll be picking this one up regularly."
"I was very impressed. I tried this beer while on vaction in Maine. I had heard good things but none of them did this beer justice. It was exceptional. It went down smooth and the flavor and aroma were great. I can't wait to try more beers from this company."
"Fairly easy drinking but not very exciting overall."
"The altbier had a nice dark amber color with a small head. The head quickly dissappeared. The beer smells of caramel and bready grains. The beer has a simple yet well defined malt character. It has a solid, rounded flavor. Not much hop balance or bitterness. The beer is quite drinkable and is smooth with decent mouthfeel."
"This beer is easy to drink with very few flaws. Not as interesting as I would like"
"Pours a clear honey color. Thin white head, with decent retention,and a nice lacing. Smell is on the light side, but sweet. Body is on the light side,with some carbionation. Taste,is smooth and mellow. Mostly malt up front,with some fruity hops in the finish. Not bad at all!"
"A little bubbly on the tongue, but smooth. This is a surprisingly solid ale. Doesn't quite make my mouth water, but is a nice selection for a six pack. Very easy to drink. It's a good beer to have between stronger ones."
"Not bad, but a pretty boring tasting beer. Nothing about it really grabs me and makes me want to have another. I love most LT beers, but this one doesn't do much for me."
"M&D - smooth and flavorful, highly drinkable, a great session beer, even better from the tap. a great basic beer from a world class brewery"
"Amber color white a nice just off-white head. The nose has some hops and malty sweetness to it a little hay. For an alt beer this one tastes a little too hoppy for me. It's fairly balanced though, and easy drinking as well. Not a completely remarkable beer, but very solid, no faults, no greatness either. a good all nighter."
"Smell is somewhat sour--salty aspects too. Nice clean crisp maltiness up front with a salty finish. Pleasant and crisp mouthfeel. I found this to be much more drinkable than most other alt styles I've tried."
"Bottle: Poured a golden color beer with a small head and very little retention. Aroma of sweet malt is quite overpowering with no hops discernable. Taste is very sweet with some light malt presence. Hops are very hard to discern. Overall, this is a refreshing but also quite boring beer."
"Drinkability: I find that the bottled version is superior to the fresh version and is a decent showing for an altbier."
"A poor brew. I wouldn't recommend this as anything except to try it for yourself. I am assuming it may be a bad bottle, and will edit this review when I try it again."
"This beer has improved. I've bumped it's score from a 3.5 for appearance to a 4.0 as it holds a great head and leaves some really nice lacing about the glass. Additionally I think that in general the quality has improved. Worth trying."
"Had this at dinner the other night with some nice veal and i think it complments it quite well. Nice medium copper color with a great head. Not much hop smell or taste, more of a barley malt flavor, almost a little too sweet at times but not to overbearing to take away from the overall flavor. Would definetly recommend for dinner with some good steak or veal."
"Not as clean and smooth as a true Alt. Heavy on the sweetness; almost artificial tasting, but not too overpowering/offensive."
"Rich, deep clear amber color with a nice tan foamy head that quickly disappeared but left a beautiful lacing all the way down. Clear malt with a buttery accent and a definitive hops scent hits your nose as you raise the glass and, when sampled, the flavor is both rich malt with a subtle sweetness that is at the same time just tart enough to keep you wanting more. Mouthfeel is rich enough to let you know it's a craft brew but thin enough (with just a touch of tingly carbonation) to make it oh so smooth. Excellent and very easy drinking with a (perfect?) aftertaste of bitter hops that make your mouth water in anticipation of the next swallow. Extremely true to the traditional German Altbier style but with a distinctly American edge that would likely appeal to a wide range of beer tastes if it were more widely distributed. A classic. And likely near the top of my list of favorite beers ever."
"I need to thank Chris Ennis for bringing this beer to me directly from Vermont! Poured a beautiful amber color with hues of orange in the light. Very thin head dissipates quickly leaving little dots of lace. Nice aroma with some mild hops, nutty with a sweet malt smell. A nice clean bitterness hits the palate and stays through to the finish. Tastes like an Amber ale with the pale malt characteristics going in and out. A good froth brings out a killer malt sweetness with the hops still holding their ground. This ale is awesome as it trades off between the Pale ale and Amber ale characteristics and you can feel the "" alt "" backbone as well. very drinkable."
"Light copper, smallish white head. Aroma is pleasant apple and cherry with a woodiness to the malt. Flavor is that sweet maply malt, nicely kept at bay by the musty metallic coat of bitterness. Full-bodied but goes down pretty easily. This is a nice beer that I wouldn't mind having every once-in-a-while. Not memorable, but pleasant."
"Carbonation is pretty high, hits crisp and clean. sometimes it's simply the best choice at a small bar."
"This is a pleasant beer. It was a pretty amber color with a fairly thick white head and a little bit of lacing. A malty aroma, not much else there. A good hoppy taste, with just a little bitterness at the end. Feels good. I could drink a few of these quite easily."
"D: Definately a good drinking beer. Very easy going and smooth. Could drink a bunch of these."
"I picked up a six pack from the local CT Bev. Pours a nice amber color. The smell is faint but still can smell the hops in it. The taste is of nice hops and malts, with a nice bitter flavor. A good brew to sit and relax with. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good ale"
"drinkability - Easy, definitely a session beer. A good crossover beer for the macro brew crowd."
"Definitely a great transition beer for the macro crowd, particularly for those who order a Killian's when they're feeling adventurous. There's not a great deal of complexity here, but what there is, is a burst of flavor with a medium body and an even, easy finish. Kudos."
"Drinkability: Easily quaffable and not filling, I could drink this beer for hours, except I might get bored."
"Musings: A pedestrian sort of drinker. Nothing really good - but nothing bad either. A suitable session beer."
"Poured from a bottle to a gass stein. It had an orangish-copper color with a bubbly white head that became a thin lace. The carbonation began as medium but quickly became low to moderate. There was not much of a smell. It wasn't bad, but very faint. The taste was a bit spicy, quite hoppy, especially for this type (though I do realize that it can very quite a bit.) Although it was a bit watery, it left a dry hoppy taste. I've had better, and I've had worse. Not bad, but nothing exceptional either."
"D- as i said, im disappointed. their hibernator and hit the trail ale are so good. oh well, nobody's perfect. =("
"Has a nice color, does build or hold a head at all. Has a ring of foam around the edge of the glass. Nice color when held up to the light. Not too aromatic, maybe due to the lack of head. the taste is the best factor of this beer. Good balanced taste. Not a complex beer, but what is there is right on the mark. Neither malt nor hop is dominating in this ale. Weighing in at only 5.00% I could drink this beer all night. This beer is good for days when you don't feel like spending extra for the good stuff. Overall this is a very enjoyable beer. Nothing extraordinary, but still very enjoyable"
"Pours with a short head of fine eggshell bubbles that quickly settles to a dusting and a brief ridge at the margins. Clear copper amber with a couple of slow carbonation streams drifting to the surface. The smell is subtly of sweet caramel and mild hop spice. The taste is modestly malty up front, with an overall crisp hop note. Finishes crisp and relatively clean, with only hints of lingering malt and hops. Well balanced and meshed. Medium body and light on the tongue with fine carbonation. Definitely drinkable."
"Poured into the glass it is absolutely beautiful, with a magnificient tan head that rapidly fell to a thin coating with nice lacing. Smell is average with a bit of sweetish caramel present. The taste is very mild with a light caramel taste and a modeerate hoppy finish. Finishes with more dry bitterness that beckons for another taste. Great drinkability. Would be a nice session beer with moderate alcohol content and a nice malt-hop blend."
"Had a couple on tap at Billy Good's in Newport RI. This was a pleasant change of pace after some pretty average Newport Storm ales the night before. Looked ok (can't really comment on the exact color in a dark place), not much head but some lacing down the glass. Tasted pretty good, no strong hops flavor like American IPA's, but a good balanced taste with a little bitterness and some rich malt flavor as well. Mouthfeel was just right, not too thin and no unusual aftertaste. Nothing spectacular, but I could drink and enjoy several of these. Too bad they ran out of Long Trail the next night. I got stuck with a really poor Newport Storm Oktoberfest."
"Drinkability-Goes down very easy. Have done several half and halfs with Guinness. Don't know why-it was a party on the 4th of July. Not bad with Guinness. Actually, better with Guinness."
"drinnkability: was i not nursing a hangover, i coulda drank these all f'n nite."
"A highly drinkable beer and glad I gave it a shot."
"I didn't expect much from this beer when I first saw the bottle, but I suppose beer and books are a like in that you can't judge them by their cover, or bottle. It pours a nice copper color, I had it in a pilsner glass and it looked great. This beer has a lot of flavor and I'm disappointed I was only able to have one because I would like to describe it more specifically. It was refreshing yet it had substance to it as well. While I believe it is available year round I would definitely classify this as a winter beer and recommend having it with a meal, however I would drink it any time."
"Pours a pale reddish color with a thick foamy white head. Nice lacing around the glass. Smells of citrus and floral notes. There is a nice hop presence. Taste is first of a smooth malty characteristic followed by a nice touch of hops that works well. There is a sweet taste of malts and also a malty note of maybe munich or vienna. Tasty alt-bier and it works well on the palate. Finishes with a nice blend of malts, lemons, and hops."
"This is a solid offering, if a bit average overall. Nice copper colored beer with great clarity. Not much of a unique aroma, in fact just a clean smelling beer with a hint of malt. The flavor was good, with some nice caramel notes and a hint of bitterness, but it's just really a clean, generic tasting beer. Mouthfeel was a bit thinner than I like, good for an alt, and it was an enjoyable beer. I'd definitely drink it again, but if I had to choose between this and something new, and try something new. But if someone put one in my hand, I wouldn't refuse it. I'd imagine it's a nice go-to beer for non-beer geek friends as well."
"Picked up a 12-pack at Shaw's for $9.99 (with your Shaw's card) Pours a orange/yellow color, inch high head, not overly carbonated. Starts a sweet malty flavor, a little thin but not bad. Grassy hop notes which lingers for a bit. For me this is a good session beer. Not the most exciting beer out there but can't complain about it either."
"Overall- not a bad beer to hide in your backpack and savor at the end of a long hike on the AT. Probably won't buy again but wouldn't turn 1 down. maybe a little to sweet."
"Not a bad beer in any sense of the word, Long Trail lacks a certain character. Not the best showing by this brewery, but I certainly won't turn one down."
"As it goes down, and it goes down capably, nothing grabs you, but then you're done, you realize the package is pretty good. Very smooth with a fundamental flavor, it drinks its way to a contented grin. It doesn't have to excel to be very drinkable, but it sure guarantees a follow-up offering. It makes getting back to basics a real comfort."
"A dark amber color with a very nice two finger head.The smell is a strong mix of spices and hops.This is very hoppy.This taste is very under stated,but with just enough spices.Its good,not great.This has a light/medium feel and is a very drinkable beer and one of Long Trails better beers."
"(bottle at the Parish Cafe in Boston, MA)"
"Cheers!"
"Overall: I was hoping this would be a nicely-priced alt that I could turn to on occasion, but it's basically watery and lacks the nice big falvor to make me want to pick it up again."
"i like this brew for sessions."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Nice full bodied carbonation and a solid backbone make this beer OK in my book... a bit spicy for my go-to session brew but mighty nice nonetheless."
"Drank it out of a frozen pint glass. Long Trail Ale had a small head that disappeared quickly after pouring. It has a deep dark amber color to it. The smell was hoppy, and had a hint of pine to it, not exactly a sweet smell. The taste was great. The first drink was exciting, hitting the front of the tongue, exciting the tastebuds. It had a slight bite to it, but not too overpowering. The aftertaste was just a pleasant, leaving a sweet aftertaste, one that gets the saliva buds going, makes the mouth happy. Not an overpowering hoppy taste, but very acceptable. Overall, very impressed with Long Trail Ale."
"A good, simple brew to have lying around for when you're in the mood for a cold one."
"Very easy to drink and a decent brew, nothing spectacular, but above average. Only the second altbier I've had (the other being Otter Creek Copper Ale) this was better and much more balanced. Overall, my jury is still out on the style, but I enjoyed this one enough to give it slightly above average marks."
"A very drinkable brew. I am really glad I picked up two sixes."
"Overall = A fairly decent beer. Nothing spectacular but I like how it settles in and enjoy how its 5% abv allows me to hold several down without going comatose."
"Nice amber color with a small, heavily-carbonated head. Nice balance in the aroma between the hops and malts. Some slight hop bitterness when tasting it. Very smooth and goes down easy. A decent beer, but nothing exciting about it. Nice appearance but could benefit from a little less carbonation."
"Poured with a soft carbonation. Light orange and copper in color. Very clear and topped with a thinning head. Lively and buttery sweet malt with a spicy character. The taste is very pleasant, dry and flavorful. The hops blend nicely with the buttery sweet malts in the beer. Well balanced. Overall, an enjoyable beer."
"poured caramel color, head diminished quickly, but left broken lace all the way through, smell had a breadlike aroma, with sweet fruity notes, taste is fairly well balanced hops and malt, a bit of nuttiness, smooth finish, pretty nice, mouthfeel was well carbonated and a bit creamy, drinkability is very nice, not a great beer, but a pretty good one, I will try this again. I like this style."
"Drinkability: This seems to be aimed at the macro-drinker; it's not even a crossover because there's precious little that can be considered ""better"". The trail would have to be exceedingly long indeed for me to drink this again."
"Light to medium bodied."
"Very surprised to find this at the bar I was at tonite. Discovered it in a ""trendy"" nite spot in Providence. It poured a pale amber in color without any head to mention. The hops were smooth and sweet. The aroma was of walnuts, but the taste was of the hops. A good beer to share a couple of pints with a group of buddies."
"Long Trail Ale is a decent American altbier. It really does nothing to warrant a second look from me, although I do appreciate its straightforward flavor and drinkability."
"a run of the mill brew from long trail that i seemingly have always enjoyed a bit more than most. its a no frills, flavourful and easy drinking brew. there's really nothing that separates it from teh pack, but it's still nice to be able to go back to every now and again. it pours a crisp amber colour with virtually no head (thanks big city...i actually watched them spoon the head out to fill the glass with more beer but was too tired to say anything). what was there was off white and mildly sticky at best. the smell is a bit buttery, rubbery and malty, with some earthiness. the flavour pretty much matches up with the smell, though a bit sweeter and bolder, but not by much. i like this one and accept it for what it is, which admittedly isn't much. this one is solidly made and i like long trail as a brewery as a whole so i think this one at least deserves a try by everyone, but if you want something bigger and bolder, look elsewhere."
"My first pint of Long Trail and it was pretty much what I had expected. Worth a try or two."
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks yankeeheel."
"A very nice ale coming out of the state of Vermont."
"This is one staple session beer for me. I have really enjoyed this altbier from Long Trail for many years now. Very drinkable."
"Pours a darker orange, with very good, thick white head, with lace that clings to the glass. Smell is average, lightly of hops. Taste is quite good. Low carbonation, but thick and full bodied, sweet with light hops. Drinkable, but I wouldnt call it thirst quenching. Overall, a good show. Reccommended."
"nice dark amber/copper with a tan head. hoppy aroma, with some smokey caramel maltiness as well. a hint of a dark fruit smell also. the taste is of roasted caramel malts that are a bit grainy, with a strong hoppy backbone to balance. the flavors don't really ingle well though, there are defined hop and malt flavors. slight grape/fig/dark fruit flavors in the aftertaste. medium/thin bodied with relatively strong carbonation. i've read some reviews and it seems like this beer is a little harshly judged. it's not superb or anything, but it's really not bad at all."
"Had on tap at the GLB in Portland a few weeks ago. While not blown away, I wasn't as dispointed in this as I anticipated. Dark rootbeer color when served, the low, of-white head, went away as soon as I took my eyes off the glass. I got mostly all malt and some chocolately notes when I took a whiff off the glass. Medium bodied, it had good small carbonation on the tongue. Tastewise, I got malt, but no real bitterness in the finish, more of a drying sensation. Probably won't get again, no real need."
"Very interesting flavor and easy drinking."
"12 ounce bottle with a ""bottled on date", on the label, of 6 weeks ago, nice FRESH beer! Pours a light almond amber, minimal head and not much lacing. Nutty, bready nose. Malt, malt and more malt characterizes this tasty quaffer from Vermont. Nutty and mildly roasted the sweetness of this brew is nicely rounded and full. Lightly hopped, it does finish with a snappy dryness and a slight chalkyness. Drinkable and refreshing. A classic Vermont staple brew."
"The taste was also slightly different... a little more bitter, no sweetness, and a bit of a bite to it. Very good. And very drinkable."
"This is one of my favorite beers to drink. Refreshing, smooth, crisp, and clean. Nice amber color with a frothy head. Smells light and fresh makes me want to drink it. Really a pleasurable experience. Leaves a nice flavor in the mouth. Not to malty and just the right balance of hops. I keep coming back to this solidly brewed beer. This is one brew that Long Trail really has done well with. It is enjoyable year round and reminds me of some good times during college in VT. This a great brew and a good choice to use if you are introducing new people to the micro brew world."
"Drinkability is good, very easy to put down, definite summer deck beer."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Voluminous and rocky head, a little ivory in color. Very clear amber liquid in the glass. Fresh malty nose, lightly toasted, delicate flowery hop notes. Firm maltiness on the palate with some biscuity taste fading into pleasant not-too-bitter hoppiness. Finishes light and more sweet than bitter, drying slightly."
"Pretty bland tasting stuff. Sweet toasted malt, a little bit of that apple flavour, and some floral hop notes. Medium bodied, slightly crisp w/ moderate carbonation."
"So whats everyone else's beef with this beer?"
"Long Trail Ale has a deep golden color with a fair amount of carbonation giving rise to a 1 inch head that quickly fades to a thin lacing. Aroma has a nice balance of bready malt and piney hops. Taste has a firm malt base, some toasted notes, a little citrus, with a crisp hoppy finish. An extremely drinkable session beer, and since it can usually be had at $10 for a 12 pack, one of my favorites."
"A dark amber colored brew with lager-like smooth malt and hop aromas. Nothing distinct here, but fresh and apetizing. Taste is similar with a nice hop bite and smooth robust malt. A nice middle of the road session beer, great for apres ski at Jay Peak, VT. Don't know that this tastes like an alt beer, but drink it anyway."
"This is one of longs trails finest. It has a nice color and a nice hops flavor and aroma. It has just enough bite to be interesting, but not to much to scare away some people. It is a great beer to convert people who hate a good hoppy beer. The aroma is great, somewhat fruity, but not to much. A good beer all around."
"Long Trail Ale was entirely unremarkable. It was pulled a clear, golden brown. It carried no head; in fact a scant film only vaguely hinted that the beer might conceive of such a thing. The flavor was generic, yeast and barley with a little hopping. I can't talk about balance, as there was no real flavor interaction. The beer was basic, perhaps a bit thin and watery. It neither neither succeeded nor failed. It's drinkable, but only something I'd select if it were a lone micro standout in a bar of macros."
"Char"
"It pours to a golden color with a small head that dissipates quickly and has hardly any lacing to speak of. The smell is pleasant with a bit of a floral bouquet. The taste is a bit bitter and very crisp, pretty nice tasting beer. Over all it is not a bad beer, one that I would never turn down if offered. It's just not one of my favorites but that is just one persons feelings."
"Thanks to rabidawg for the sampling."
"The beer pours a dark golden color with a frothy white head. The aroma is hoppy with crystal and pale malts along side. The taste is decent. There is a good balance here between hops and malts. This beer is very refreshing and clean tasting. The mouthfeel is good. This is a light bodied ale with adequate carbonation. This is a nice micro-ale from Vermont. A good sessions ale with a fellow BA."
"One of my standard favorites when I can get it tap-fresh up in VT: a good social brew and a good one to begin sessions with. This is an Altbier-styled brew similar to both the famous Düsseldorf Altstadt and Northern German varieties: Not quite the intensity of the city's, yet more bitter than most northern styles (I would not label this beer simply a ""moderately bitter brown ale"" by the German standard, but might be so inclined by American ones). Not sure how much Munich malt is involved, or whether they lay-down the ale for a period of maturity, but when I drink this, I do not necessarily relate it in my head to an Altbier. Just great-tasting enjoyment."
"Long Trail's namesake ale was my favorite beer from all the Thanksgiving weekend tastings. I believe it to be a great American tribute to German altbiers. It pours a deep amber-brown with a touch of clouding in the glass. This ale's white head doesn't last long over your pint. It smells of bittersweet toffee and/or caramel (I couldn't really pin it down). LT Ale starts crisp, flavorful, and smooth. It is full bodied with dominant wheat and oat flavors. There are several suggestions of both sweet and bitter flavors present in each mouthful. It finishes cool, crisp, clean, and most pleasantly. Were I ever in New England again, I'd definately look for another bottle of Long Trail Ale."
"Decent off-white head that left a good amount of lacing. The smell is like pungent grapefruity hops. Copper colored beer that's pretty transparent. Yum, great floral hop taste, a light malt base that's hardly there. The body is leaning too the light side, and the carbonation is solid. A good, not too bitter, easy drinking amber ale."
"I'll tell you what. Long Trail know alts. (I've had the Double Bag before as well.)"
"Taste is bitter. Bitter throughout for various reasons. Spicy malt flavors in there somewhere. Not sure of how to describe this but it tastes ""grainy", like unmalted barley. Hoppy finish and aftertaste. This beer is crisp and easy to drink. Would make a nice session brew during a ski vacation. Solid."
"Had this at a stop off in VT,had seen while living up there but never tried it.Poured a hazy orange/gold color with almost no head,aroma is light and subtley hopped with a light fruitiness as well.The beer has a decent balance of hops and malt but neither really stick out to make me want another,its not a bad beer but unspectacular in my opinion."
"The challenge is to describe my feelings of the beer vs. this not being one of my favorite styles. When looking at styles guidelines this beer passes all tests. I just find it hard to enjoy many of them; its just not my style. If you like Alts pick up a few and judge for yourself. Cheers!"
"Definitely not the best alt on the planet, but decent and drinkable. I don't care for the hops, but the malts are pleasantly coarse and rough hewn. i guess it's just not my thing."
"An excellent amber ale, would buy and drink again."
"Pours a beautiful amber with a nice white head. Tastes sweet with a nice hoppy finish. A solid tasting alt. Not as good as Double Bag though. A solid brew available all over Vermont. Certainly worth a sample. Mouthfeel is smooth. Easy to drink all night."
"Mmmmm. Perfect offering for the summer months. Light slightly fruity aroma. Nice coppery color that laced the glass sides quite nicely. Mouthfeel was somewhat light, but with enough body to keep me honest. Taste was nicely rounded with a pleasant, light aftertaste. Very drinkable...will definitely try other Long Trail offerings."
"Drinkability: A very drinkable beer. Much nicer than some of the other NE alts I've tried. This is quickly becoming my ""regular"" drinking brew. Definitely worth a try."
"I really quite like this: a nice, nutty, hoppy, malty ale."
"A very inviting nose....sweet and floral...it's really nice....pours out a very clear light orange...looks like buid Light with a drop of orange coloring in it...very lightly colored and clear....very little head....body is thin but drinkable....not very complex but enjoyable....flavor is enjoyable....you get some of the sweet, floral characteristics on the buds and also a slight twang of maltiness...finishes dry...I'm not sure how true to style this is, but it is enjoyable....the best thing about it by far is the wonderful nose....thanks to bierman9 for this pleasurable beer tasting experience..."
"I've always been a big fan of Long Trail beers and this one should please any palette."
"Very drinkable Alt beer..Im beginning to like this rare style..maybe I should make a trip to Dusseldorf one of these days."
"The beer pours a slightly amber brown color. Moderate amount of head. The aroma is mainly of maltiness. Not too much in the way of hops to it. The flavor is malty and fairly crisp. A hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall, it is a rather nice beer."
"Golden amber color with a small, tan head. Light lacing left around the glass. Very, very faint aroma of hop. Flavor is primarily of hop, with just a tiny bit of malt dripping through. The hop flavor lingers. Mouthfeel is watery. Everything about this beer seems light or faint, including my inclination to have another."
"Taste: Very thin body, and not as malty as I would expect for this style. Other than that, this is a dead-on American version of an alt. Very dry. I just can't seem to enjoy it, though. Much better on tap, imho. Not sure why. Drinkability definitely better, and seems less dry on draught."
"Nice head with good lacing and retention time. Good up front matly and carmal flavors with a bready finish. Some mild hop balancing that was pleasant but not very complex. Overall good but not great, I remember this one tasting much better on tap at this cool little bar at the base of Okemo in Vermont."
"Long Trail is an Altbier. Shiny copper and loaded with malty flavor. A yeasty and hoppy aroma finishes with a light herbal malt and pleasant finishing hop. The sharp metallic hop bite is as bright as an IPA. Nice white head. Best described as a cross between an Octoberfest and Pale Ale."
"Note:If you can get it on tap do so,because its alot better."
"I have not had many beers of this style so I can't really speak to the authenticity. It still tastes good to me."
"An okay beer to drink in the land of Macrocrappy lagers of Killington. Malt is somewhat clean tasting but tastes a little watery, hops are present but lacking for the style and leaves the beer a little too sweet. Hard to have more than a couple. If they would just ramp up the malt and hops a little and maybe condition it in wooden barrels, it would be more like a real Dussledorf Alt."
"I like the taste of this beer but for some reason, it makes me pee. Maybe its the hops, maybe its my mind, but even after one I have to go. The malt is ever present, so maybe its that. I would drink more of this, but I would spend the night in the Men's room."
"Good beer.  A good session beer that pours a brown copper color.  I had a decent head on mine, but it quickly faded - not much lacing either.  Not alot of different flavors, but it still had a good taste.  I tasted more malt than usual.  Very drinkable."
"Great session brew with its smooth, balanced flavors.  Cheers!"
"A vigorous pour is needed to get any head. Dark golden color, sticky white head, clean aroma full of malt. Malty and fruity with light trace of butter, clean drying hops that satisfy the tongue. Certainly hoppy enough to stand up to the big fruity malts, but not too hoppy - expertly balanced. Very nice mouthfeel, all in all a fine, fine beer. Not exactly what I would deem an alt, but certainly not a typical pale ale either. So sweet and fruity!"
"Copper brown color, no head or lace. At first taste I thought this beer had some very lager-ish qualities. There was not much complexity, however it was smooth with a slight hop flavor. After a few more pulls from my glass I began to taste a very hoppy, somewhat metallic aftertaste, more like the long trail ale I expected. All in all a nice smooth ale."
"slightly dark and very smooth with a rich and somewhat sweet malty flavor. it is a great beer to drink. very pleasant in smell and taste. the flavor of this beer is very strong and satisfying."
"133"
"Crystal clear light copper with lasting white head.  Grainy, nutty aromas and flavors with slightly bitter finish.  A simple, well-made alt, if not a little thin."
"Light freash slightly bitter nose.  Light amber almost peach in color.  Medium white head.  Light malty flavor.. and light body.  A quite light ale.. A great ale for the warmer months.."
"It has a full maltiness to it without being overly sweet and the hops are only slighty there and not much of a head. On a hard pour the head stayed only a minute or two befor turning to a thin white film that left a nice lace down the glass."
