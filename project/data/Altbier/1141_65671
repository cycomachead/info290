3.74,-1.1,3.5,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"A bit hard to find altbiers around here, this example from Quebec pours a coppery gold with ample off white foam. Aroma is tangy, fruity, sweet, some peppery coriander and nutmeg like notes although there is no such spice in the beer. Palate starts with pretty big burnt caramel malts, with toast and dark bread crust, fairly impressive bitter spicy hops relative to others of this style. Initially I had a bit of trouble getting past the malts up front to catch other flavor elements but as things progressed I started to get some vinous fruit, sour gummy candy, a bit of yeasty dankness, spicy root cellar and more bitterness at the end, perhaps some metal like sucking on a coin. Its sweet as well but this is less obvious at first. An interesting array of tastes that unfolds as you go: Have two or three and you'll probably notice different things each time, with the malts in control for one bottle and more fruit and hops in the next. Not too shabby and intriguing if you want to pay close attention for a session.","CalgaryFMC","Jul 26, 2013"

3.57,-5.6,4,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a thick off white head that quickly dissipates to stray bubbles on the top. The aroma is very malty with lots of dark sugars and caramel. Sweet candy hints of light sweet fruit and some earthy and herbal hops round out the nose nicely. The flavor is malty up front with a lot of the sweetness from the aroma. The sweet is cut with a spicy earthy hop bite as well as a bit of a mineral type flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly sharp mineral mouthfeel. This smells great! The flavor is a bit harsher with a mineral water thing going on that is slightly unpleasant.","johnnnniee","Aug 11, 2012"

More earthy notes with some subtle smoke. Taste has big wooden and earthy malt flavours, toffee notes, with some light spicing and grass in the finish. Light bitterness in the mouthfeel, but the earthy malts prevail and dominate lending some good full sweetness. Medium carbonation and easily drinkable. Very nice for the style, something I could easily revisit.","liamt07","Jul 17, 2011"
3.8,0.5,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Poured a amber-brown color w/ two-finger head that died slow and left lace down the glass on top of a somewhat hoppy, somewhat sweet and bready malt aroma.
