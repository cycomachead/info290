Taste has a good balance at the presentation till the end where it starts tasting like it smells. Feel is overall pretty smooth. It's a pretty average beer with a different taste.","Mrbseward","Mar 27, 2015"

4.2,8.5,,,,,,"DATE REVIEWED: August 23, 2014... GLASSWARE: Hobgobin stange... OCCASION: Lord of the Rings return to school prep... APPEARANCE: stately brown/orange body; strong, two-finger off-white head; spongy at first, sinewy as it clings to the glass; handsome... AROMA: surprisingly fragrant bouquet from an alt; blanketing caramel malts; some wet leaf and earthy tones... PALATE: heavy, full-bodied and long in its aftertaste; soft hops play at the teeth; palpable yet palatable ... TASTE: vibrant toffee and toast make this a brown with bite; the earthy malts make a course, somewhat complex sip; hops are floral and complimentary ... OVERALL: a Long Trail brew to get behind--a malty ale that brings the weight of 7.2 % ABV subtly; powerful and energizing...","dacrza1","Aug 29, 2014"

Aromas of caramel toffee and brown sugar with just a hint of butterscotch. Earthy bitterness in the aroma keeps this in check. The flavor is sweet rich sugars with some melanoids and a bit of burnt sneaking in there. Earthy bitterness with a touch of burnt butter round us out. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation. There is a bit of diacetyl here and that usually turns me off to a beer, but this is one of the rare instances where I think it works within the frame of the rest of the brew.","johnnnniee","Jul 10, 2014"

The beer is copper colored and I have found that you really have to play with it as you pour in order to get a noticeable head, which is cream colored and retains for about .5 secs. The beer has a faint noticeable smell that is malty maybe with a little fruit. When you taste it there is an initial very malty toffee flavor followed by a smooth hop bitterness and alcohol bite at the end which sometimes persists. This is a beer that stays with you in the back of the mouth, producing continuing flavors after the initial taste. It is very sweet and goes well after dinner. It is tough to drink a lot of these as they are very rich and flavorful.","Ctone33","Nov 20, 2013"

Aroma is rich and sweet, with notes of caramel, bread and fruit. Taste is very similar with just a slight hint of bitter hops on the finish.

The body is medium large, plenty of life, more lush than dry, and very drinkable. This is very nice, I remember when this beer seemed giant, now it is easy going down.","SawDog505","May 02, 2012"

4.2,8.5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, bright, crisp, orange-copper coloring with a bit of filmy head on the pour that disappears almost instantly, leaving behind a ring of film around the edge of the surface. Caramel and toffee aromas richly sweeten the slight toasting on the nose. Flavors are rich and smooth, with a creamy blending of cream and toffee forming the backbone. Toasty, rich overtones, with a sweetness similar to SugarDaddy. The aftertaste is toffee rich, with a crisp, roasted finish.

Interesting and consistent with my previous enjoyment form bottles. It's medium-light bodied with modest carbonation and a fairly aqueous feel.

Toffee and caramel malt sweetness dominate the flavor with a leafy and earthy hop flavor in the finish (but not particularly bitter).

For the wintertime when you're stuck at home, this is a great choice to warm up and mellow out to. It's a shame that this style isn't more readily available around here but there's no need to worry - Long Trail has it nailed and for any lovers of Altbiers, this will suffice quite nicely!","JerzDevl2000","Feb 12, 2011"

I remember it being a lot more malty, perhaps my tastes are a lot different and more in tune, or perhaps it has to do with the freshness as I was probably used to drinking older ones and this was bottled 12/22/10 so barely 5 weeks old.","jlindros","Feb 04, 2011"

Also a hint of honey. Really smooth beer, drinks incredibly easily. I can't believe the ABV is over 7%. Drinks more like a beer around 4%.

A bready dryness is evident as well, maybe a roasted/toasted malt as well as some stickiness. Picking up minor hop fruit flavors that are bitter and I think I'm getting some apple.

The alcohol warmth isn't strong but is quite pleasant. I would describe it as slippery, medium-bodied, and yet at the same time enormously clean and refreshing. A good solid hops, slight maltiness, hints of fruits and some alcohol. Overall this is a well made beer that comes very close to being excellent.","claspada","Dec 23, 2010"

Its head isn't overwhelming, but present, and honey white in color. It smell like none other, its mild almost sweet and smells somewhat like bananas. The taste is good, it not harsh in any way, it doesn't taste nearly as alcoholic as it is, again, like its smell its somewhat sweet, (but no banana taste, so far as I can tell). The mouthfeel is strong and crisp, the way I like it. Overall, this beer is very very drinkable, so much so that you might not realize its high alcohol content after putting back a several pints until the buzz hits you strongly. Delicious, thank you Long Trail.","Saint","Apr 11, 2010"

That being said, I was pleasantly surprised with the results.

The light hoppy flavor hits the tongue first quickly followed by mid-low bittering. Bitter flavor could have been a bit stronger. The sweet, toasty malt fills the mouth and sticks through a dry aftertaste. Mid-full mouth feel and a bit light on the carbonation, which may have helped add to the bitter taste.

Well, both characteristics come out in this brew with nice, clean and refreshing lager traits balanced and complemented by fruity esters and malt sweetness and body. Fruits, berries (cranberries, blackberries and some cherries) and caramel sugar in the nose. It is a nice, clear, medium brown color with red highlights and a thin, white, bubbly head. Tastes malty and sweet but with enough bitterness to satisfy the hop-heads; a very balanced presentation in all. Both malt and hops are fully enjoyed in this brew.

4.15,7.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Definitely a German beer. The malt is very sweet w/ a very subtle fruitiness to it. A deep amber w/ a thick but quickly faded head. The nose is somewhat alcoholic but that doesn't carry over to the taste. Alcohol is barely noticeable and gives it a slight tingle towards the back of the mouth. I can't describe what makes this beer so reminiscent of German beers, but the flavor is unique and tastes very clean. Although the malt is very sweet, there is also a nice complement of roasted malt and light hops which keep it from being too sweet. The mouthfeel is very smooth and clean while the drinkability is crazy, although it can get heavy towards the end of the glass. I'm finishing the last few sips right now and the beer is very close to room temperature but still tastes great. Although this beer claims to be a ""secret brew," it still remains very close to German style. Definitely my favorite offering from Long Trail.","Gatch","Jul 31, 2007"

If taking a blind taste test, I would say it had the same as any other beer on the market even though it sits at a nice 7.2%. It goes down nicely with very little bitterness which is nice if you're just looking for something to have after a hard days work.

Alcohol well hidden, perhaps best detected in the mouthfeel which is a bit heavier than the lower ABV LT Ale. Really nice beer.","kenito799","Jun 28, 2007"

The smell is big barley with some fruit and a little dried spice, not sure what. I'm most impressed with the aroma since I have a bum nose that's usually too clogged up to smell much. Mouthfeel is a nice middle of the road. I love malty beers, but if they're too unbalanced the taste seems thin. This has enough hop to counterweight the malt, but buttery sweet malt is what it's all about. You'll never taste the alcohol, but after sipping for a while I did notice some numbness in my tounge.

About as clear an amber as you'll find, it's got a nice buttercream colored head, that actually lasts quite a bit. Aroma is also quite nice, some German maltiness, but if you dig deeper, that 7.2 %abv starts showing itself as well. Tastewise, there is a good base layer of malt, but I am also picking up on some small hoppy and tannic flavor which is also very nice. Finishes a bit dry. I do notice the abv by the end of just one bottle. Mouthfeel manages to stay medium, carbonation is pretty low.","PatandDavid","Aug 21, 2005"

This brew is rich and sweet, serious yet playful. When I dabble in mixed drinks, I often have Manhattans. This beer is right for the Manhattan drinker. It's August and hot, yet this one isn't too heavy. In the depth of winter, I expect it to take on rich, warm flavors that strenthen the soul. Double Bag is a sticke, a ""secret"" beer. Be a snitch.

The nose was rich and enticing, with a lightly roasty oatmeal cookyish maltiness and an excellent citric-vague banana fruity edge as a counter point. The taste was also rich and very well-developed, with a lightly astringent/roasty chewy malt profile that released some oatmeal-raisin cookie-banana and limey citirc flavors in the transition to the tasty, chewy (though still slightly astringent) malty, moderately bittered, light citric-fruity finish.

4.57,18.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Now here's a kick ass beer....a double alt is something new to me but it seems to fit that style....it is rich, sweet and syruppy, but also exhibits alt bier like characteristics...pours an impressively clear dark orange.....nose smells a bit like a scotch ale minus the smokiness....malty...some alcohol (like rum..and even some nuttiness....with some floral hop notes....I mentioned the body, but it finishes with a nice tight dry hop bite....that really seems to balance this out and make it special....the taste is very malty....sweet plums,pears,mangos....but then there is that nice dry finish....this is really a dandy..a big giant ZAP thanks to Bierman9 for this beauty....","ZAP","Jun 17, 2003"
4.13,6.7,3,5,4,4.5,3.5,"Average appearance.I expected more from the appearance from this beer.Poured a small head that reduced to almost nothing.The color is a dark amber to red.Aroma is excellent with a well-balanced blend of hops and malt.First sip delivers an immediate warming feeling to the stomach due to the ABV.Alcohol is noticed but not overpowering.A very creamy malt thickness with a real bitter finish.Full bodied with a ton of malt.This is Long Trail's best brew.Well balanced malt,hops,bitterness,and alcohol all in high amounts.I would certainly buy this again,but drinking alot of these would be out of the question.Sweet malt taste with trace amounts of lacing.Hail the Double Bag!","kelticblood","Jun 13, 2003"
4.33,11.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"First time I've had a beer which labels itself as a ""double alt"". Whatever it is, it's definitely a fine product. Nice amber color and lasting head with a definite malty emphasis although hops are by no means lacking. Excellent body which might be expected from a 7% brew. Would make a good winter seasonal but fortunately it's a year-round product. When I purchased a 6-pack in NH, it was priced no higher than Long Trail's other products which makes it quite a bargain. I had a Sierra Nevada Celebration just after the Double Bag and didn't find it to be any tastier - and I love the Celebration.","Greenlabel","Jun 04, 2003"
4.57,18.1,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"Pours out a nice copper amber with a white head. One will fall in love with the malt flavor of this wonderful Alt ale. The mouthfeel is superb. Feels so good and tastes so good. A touch of hops finishes the sip quite well. This brew has everything going for it. We drink it all night long! If you're in the VT area get yourself a case. You will not regret it.","scottum","Mar 03, 2003"
3.71,-4.1,4,3,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: The alcohol sneaks up on you since this beer is quite smooth and drinkable. I find it funny that drinkability is used as a criteria for shared thoughts on beer, since it seems such an individual choice.","IPAlot","Feb 24, 2003"
3.5,-9.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Not too impressed with this offering. Poured a deep amber, just a wisp of a head. Had a sweet porter taste to it. Hops were definitely lacking. The ABV was not over powering. A good malt base though. It went down smooth enough. A good beer, but just not impressive.","bewareOFpenguin","Jan 30, 2003"
4.32,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer is perfect for the winter time, as the higher ABV definetely provides much needed warmth. An aggressive pour brings about a small tannish head that lasts a few minutes. While the malt flavors dominate, they don't overpower. I was a little nervous that it was going to be too sweet for my liking, as some stronger ales are, but this brew was very drinkable and very well balanced. Another great beer from Long Trail.","nixhecks","Jan 04, 2003"

3.65,-5.7,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Without even seeing the label I knew this beer was going to be a big beer. Although the alcohol didn't come through in the aroma, the thick, malty, sweet smell had to have been hiding something quite sinister. In color it was copper leaning towards brown with a head that managed to hang in there for a while. When I poured it there was a little bit of sheeting on the glass. The carbonation was big. Mind you, I don't mean it was overcarbonated, just that it had big bubbles. I guess because it was more viscous than some. Also, big malty taste with caramel and bread crusts. The hops were bitter enough to balance. After the beer was swallowed it was warming. That's when I knew it was well over 6% abv. Very nice, hearty ale all around. Another good one from Long Trail.","yen157","Oct 17, 2002"

4.1,5.9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"An exceptionally well brewed beer. Very well balanced with the alcohol mostly hidden. Light enough to enjoy more than one, but also full of flavor. Highly recommended.","NeroFiddled","Oct 11, 2002"
4.44,14.7,4,5,4.5,4,4,"Pours a nice copper color with a creamy tan head that sinks to a thin lasting head and leaves a nice cligning lace all the way down.  The smell is just loaded with toasty caramel maltiness.  There is also some decent spicy alcohol aromas floating around in their.  The brew opens up with the intense creamy maltiness flavors that have some light caramel flavors to them.  The chewy malt flavors last right through to the end with some nicely subdued hop bitterness and some warming, spicy alcohol in the background all along.  This is one intensely creamy and chewy brew but it manages to not get into the too sweet area and does not becoming cloying or sticky which keeps the drinkability high.  This would be a great brew to enjoy in the cold winter but fit me just as well on a cooler summer morning.","Murph","Aug 08, 2002"
2.68,-30.7,3,2.5,2.5,3,3,"a little too malty for me, but not an undrinkable beer. as a strong ale, this one is pretty good. somewhat sweet malt and a smooth rich consistency. i can't say i would get it again, but it was not the worst strong ale i have had","ElGuapo","Jul 27, 2002"
4.32,11.6,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This is a quality strong ale.  Nice roasted malt aroma and a deep copper color introduce a nicely balanced body of mild malt sweetness.  The smooth medium body makes for an easy drinking warming beer.","beernut7","Jul 20, 2002"
4.43,14.5,4,3.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Not knowing what to expect, I anticipated that this beer would be heavy and rich.  I was correct in that it was rich and inviting, yet not heavy.  Contrary to my belief, this beer  has a lovely rich texture and taste, with an abundance of malt.  I thought this beer was so good, I was saddend to find I had only one.  It's almost dangerous, being 7.2%, but a pleasure to drink.  This is why I love beer.","AaronRed","May 15, 2002"
3.65,-5.7,3,3,4,3.5,4,"Nice citrusy nose. Body is very malty, just a little sweet. Has moderate bitterness with more citrusy flavor giving it a more refreshing taste than you'd expect from a beer of it's darkness. Very drinkable and pleasant. My main complaint was that there was no head. Maybe the trip from CT to GA by mail harmed the carbonation a bit, though.","aracauna","May 13, 2002"
4.26,10.1,2.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Not alot of head, looks like a cloudy red uneventful ale.  Sweet maly and cherry nose.  It does taste so much better that it looks.. what a shock...  Bursting with malty bitterness and a wonderful.. full mouth.  I was taken off guard but for once, in a good way.  There is also a spice bite in the finish.  I like the bitterness alot, and am unaware of the 7.2% ABV.  Great for cold weather months...","frank4sail","May 12, 2002"
4.8,24,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"After roughly 2yrs, this has gained incredible additional character. Nearly pumpkin-pie-esque with its spicing with ginger and cinnamon notes. Huge caramelly pears and apples. Dry cedar wood closure. Overall rating stays the same, but this beer sure hasn't. Just a fantastic brew, young or aged. This is an absolute favorite of mine.","cokes","Apr 28, 2002"

Anyway you catagorize it, this is an excllent brew. Deep copper color, great looking head. Rich malty aroma. Flavor and body are rich with a hint of chocolate. A pleasant alcohol warming sensation follows each swallow. Hops balance things out nicely. Good drinkability for such a strong, rich beer.","John","Mar 27, 2002"

4.37,12.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"Notes: A very intense and interesting brew, well balanced and finishes quite clean for a brew that boasts 7.2% abv. This brew is called a Sticke (secret) Alt Style Ale, an obscure sub-style of the Alts that is only brewed as a specialty ( once in a blue moon ) in Germany, Long Trail has done it justice for an American brewed version.","Jason","Mar 07, 1999"
