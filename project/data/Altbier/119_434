3.57,-1.4,3.75,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"First time re-visting this beer in a long time - an early craft brew that I drank quite a bit of in the 90's. Served in a nonic. Pours a copper hue with a slight haze. Head quickly dissipates into a band around the edges and a soapy froth across the center. Nose expresses toasted malt with a little biscuit and a hint of sweetness. Taste consistent with nose with a slight metallic quality. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a crisp carbonation. Overall, an exemplar of the style, particularly from the American craft market.","Jwale73","Jul 07, 2014"

APPEARANCE: dark amber body that is lively and slightly opaque; off-white head is mostly creamy with a bit of rocky space; good open lacing... AROMA: sharp caramel malts with enough metallic clank to disturb the doughy biscuit that settles... PALATE: smooth yet slightly warm; mellow, swift and too light to hold attention... TASTE: nutty and caramel with the sweetness near to lip-smacking; hops are in check and not distinguishable... OVERALLL: serviceable and sessionable, but not a six-pack I'd seek to revisit; rather straightforward and predictable, with only the comfort factor working in its favor....","dacrza1","Jun 06, 2014"

Head of foam and surprisingly white with a yellow tinge that holds lacing. Aroma is predominantly hops, and very clean; not a favorite aroma, but a good aroma. Taste is light and malty, hops make a showing as does a distinct toasted flavor. This is like a less intense and more sessionable version of Redhook ESB, a beer I really like, but I'm unsure I want a less intense version. Flavors are great though, simple as that. Mouthfeel is watery; aimed for sessionability so it's acceptable.

It's okay, nothing special, just okay.

I dig their Stovepipe Porter, and their White Sail is good too. They also have growlers that seem to be seasonal and regional that are worth a shot.

The taste is a little grainier than expected, lightly sweet up front with a moderate bitterness that comes out on the finish and transitions from citrus to more of floral taste as it fades. Theres a light metallic tinge in there. It has a medium body, watery texture, and good, moderate carbonation. I remember absolutely loving this beer when I was first getting into craft beers and stronger hops. Yes, I still think its a good, well-balanced beer, but its a little too thin-feeling and the flavor is a little weak in the middle.

This is my first altbier, so i didnt really know what to expect...but this is definately a mellow ale and you can tell it was lagered for a while. Alot of the fruity ale esters have subsided into the background and it lets the malt profile take center stage. The malt profile is very dry, and has flavors of hay, whole grain oats and a slight presence of lemon. The finish is herbal and lightly bitter (saaz hops i suppose...those germans love em).

The nose is lightly fruity and peppered with leafy and spicy noble hops amidst a delicate, toasty malt base. It's fine-bubbled, restrained carbonation leaves it slippery-smooth across the palate with just a gentle caress on the tongue. The fruitiness is less apparent in the flavor than the aroma, but it's still there and it works exceptionally well to brigthen the maltiness and offset the grassy/spicy/leafy/floral hop flavors; and it's precision tuned bitterness is solid enough to balance it perfectly.

A very nice beer with a meal or by itself.","chilidog","Dec 07, 2003"
3.85,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pretty clear amber color. Being an ""Alt-styled"" beer, the aroma does not predominate. Sweet caramel malt ""beer"" smell would describe things. The taste is where it's ""at."" Again, crystal/Munich malt with balancing hops (not overhopped the way other light ales can be ""overdone""). This is not an Oktoberfest nor an IPA: huge malts or hops are not to be had; balanced, light drinkability are.","Hobbz","Dec 06, 2003"
3.41,-5.8,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"This ale pours deep amber with a creme-colored head. It is crystal clear in the pint glass. A most impressive appearance, I must say. Copper Ale smells of bitterness (I swear I'm not making that up) and it's rather distinctive hops blend. It starts fragrant with hoppy spice and intriguing malt undertones. This beer is medium bodied with caramel and nut-like flavors dominant. The finish is smooth and dry with a slight taste of wheat. Copper Ale was my second favorite beer from all my Thanksgiving tastings.","theozag","Nov 30, 2003"

4.03,11.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Beautiful dark amber color with a nice thick tan head that settled and left clingly lace all the way down the glass. The smell was of sweet, maltly caramel with a wisp of hop notes. The taste was very, very big with a sweet and smooth mouthfeel with just a little bite near the end. The carbonation was at a perfect level, making every sip crisp and fresh, but not taking over the taste. This was extremely drinkable. I had a 5 gallon keg for a little over two weeks and kept interested, excited and satisfied with this beer the entire time.","Gasp100","Nov 20, 2003"
3.62,0,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a nice coppery amber color with a thin white head which quickly diminishes to nothing but a ""skim"" of bubbles. Toasted malty smell with a bit of hop spiciness. The first time I had this beer the taste surprised me a bit-not quite what I was expecting, although I'm not sure why. Some nice sweet malt flavors along with a bit of hops. Fairly smooth and drinkable, a nice beer.","tar","Nov 18, 2003"
3.86,6.6,4,3,4,4,4.5,"A friend picked up a couple of bottles while in Vermont which were fairly recent and fresh. I was impressed with the pour.

3.5,-3.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This copper ale is just a little hazy. Streams of CO2 surface at a leisurely pace. The aroma is fruity and sweet. An herbalness is present as well. The flavors are pretty clean (an indication that this alt was properly lagered??) Malt tones are biscuity and toffeeish. Hops impart a dry hebal tone. The finish leaves me wanting more. Fruitiness is present, but subdued. Medium full body and a mouthfeel that feels just a titch too carbonated for the style. That's being pretty picky though. This is an above average alt, not much more.","Bighuge","Nov 07, 2003"
2.51,-30.7,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,2,"Not much going on in the head department, just a thin off-white film across the surface. The color is a dark copper. The smell is strong and very malty with some caramel thrown in. The taste is malty, too with a bit of burnt toast. Maybe it's supposed to taste/smell like this, but for me it's too much. I've had this beer in bottles and from kegs before, and it was a lot mellower, not overpowered by what tastes like the center of a Malt Ball (I hate Malt Balls!). I'll give it another try down the road, but I definitely woln't be seeking it out anytime soon.","HappyHourHero","Oct 27, 2003"

3.58,-1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Another good all around ale from otter creek, copper color with a white head (which lasts slightly longer than their pale ale). Smells of citrus and malt, the citrus is a bit sweeter varity than the pale ale though.

3.48,-3.9,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured out a slightly cloudy orange amber color. The head was huge, dense and looked like bubbly sea foam. Some graininess and grassy notes. The body is a bit thin.

4.06,12.2,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Otter Creek Copper Ale is a nice clear amber color with a medium bodied white head on the surface. The head dissolves slowly leaving behind a good amount of lace on the side of the glass. I found the malty aroma with a hint of hops to be rather faint. However, the taste makes up for the smell. Each sip of this medium bodied beer is a pleasant combination of toasted and caramel malts. An acidic flavor lingers on the tongue for a few moments before the hops take over for the mildly bitter finish. There's a nice malty taste left behind similar to what you would find if you just had a sip of scotch. This is a great tasting malty beer that is very drinkable.","WanderingFool","Sep 09, 2003"
4,10.5,4,4,4,4,4,"A solid malt aroma with nice breadiness was the prelude to the great taste that was immediately impressive of the malting, but had solid hopping layered in as well. The feel was also very solid and full providing a very nicely drinkable Alt. This is a beer I'd go back to often if it were widely available. Unfortunately it's a bit hard to find in SW Ohio.","AtLagerHeads","Sep 06, 2003"

3.65,0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This beer sometimes seems a little sour and watery, and this is enough to make it sometimes uncomfortable to drink. The carbonation is very nice, moderate and unassuming, but present. Overall, this is a little thinner than I might like, especially given the potential that it shows, and I know that copper ales have delivered in the past.","Kongquistador","Aug 19, 2003"
3.12,-13.8,3,3.5,3,3,3,"As its name implies, this has a deep copper body that just seems like it's a little lacking. Pours with a thinnish head that quickly fades to a partial layer of foam. Slight malty aroma that brings to mind a mild vienna lager or oktoberfest aroma. Taste is slightly grainy, with a touch of malt sweetness and a good dose of huskiness. Lingering bitterness on the finish is more distractig than completing. More of a ""prolonged continuance"" than a ""finish"". Mouthfeel is a bit on the light side. Drinkability is OK. Feels like a lager to me. Decent, but not memorable, other than for its apparent identity crisis. ""The Ale that drinks like a lager."" This one goes down better in large gulps. Drink like an Irishman for this one.","aaronh","Aug 15, 2003"

3.78,4.4,4,3.5,4,3,4,"This will be my first taste of an altbier, here it goes this one pours out a ruby copper tone with an off white cream hued head leaving even lacing rings around my glass. Aromatics are very nice within this little brew with an exotic floral hop with some very pronounced malt tones giving touches of toasted nuts and caramel not bad at all. Flavor breeds a wonderful balance between shots of hops, mildly sweet robust malts with a wonderful chestnut finish. Nothing is over the top but this medium bodied brew gives off many great qualities to ensure a clean crisp flavor with no offness just brewed to be drinkable. A great starter for the altbier category in my opinion I enjoy it and now I wish to venture toward other similar beers.","WVbeergeek","Aug 03, 2003"
2.9,-19.9,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Poured a beautiful golden color with a small white head. Smells of faint bread and a little bit of citrus. The taste was a huge dissapointment. Much hoppier than I expexted for an alt style. Finished bitter and not so pleasent. Mouthfeel was also a little thin. I gave it two tries over several days. There are much better offerings in this style.","yankeeheel","Aug 03, 2003"
2.15,-40.6,4,1.5,2,2.5,2.5,"Looks can be deceiving. This beer looked fine, sporting a rich copper hue. The smell was bad; like opening the freezer and smelling old fish sticks.

4.38,21,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Tried this as a alternate to Red Seal Ale by suggestion, and really thought it was a stand-out. The color was a wonderful-dead on pale copper-it should NOT be cheated out of a glass pour! !The aroma was enticing, with lots caramel, pine needle, and bitter hop fighting for the lead. A very satisfying mouthfeel and taste featuring more creamy, bittersweet caramel, and some sweet malted grain-superb balance here. I think of this beer as a sort of Red-Seal ""light"" but, that may be cheating a very fine beer from its proper name, which really should be ""damn fine ale!"" Delicious!!","moulefrite","Jul 24, 2003"
3.8,5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"True to its name, it pours a light copper color with a very small off-white head that flattens right out. Aroma is light, and consists of sweet malt, some hints of pear, and a bit of cinnamon. Flavor is sweet malt, a bit of hops in the finish, and a lingering pear with some spice. Mouthfeel is crisp and a bit tannic. Light hop and caramel linger in the aftertaste. Overall light but tasty and drinkable.","far333","Jul 15, 2003"

The lace was some-what present but only in patches. The aroma was of hops (floral, citrus), caramel malt, yeast (bread), dandelions, and some alcohol at the end. The taste was fairly similar to the smells it produced. There were tastes of hops, flowers, some citrus, bread/yeast, dandelions, and alcohol as well. It ended with a slight hop aftertaste, but not overbearing. It had a medium body that filled the mouth quite well. A good beer, that I rather enjoyed.","Jarod","Feb 04, 2003"

Well balanced battle between hops and malt across the tongue and on through the aftertaste. Malt takes a sizeable lead, but there is a little hop bite at the very end. Goods down very easily. Good solid drinking beer, and would go easily with many foods. I had a couple with pizza and was quite happy.","RonfromJersey","Aug 17, 2002"

The smell does not impress me, although my particular sense of smell should not be considered.  Althought the brew is not particularly bitter, the unbalanced hops bite through.  This imbalance may lead to its great dryness. There is a mildy light body that borders on harsh is held too long. The big STRIKE of this beer is its after taste that is long and uncomfortable. Drink this one with some food and it will be a better experience.  Like the others say, it does grow on you.  Looks nice and is hoppy and dry, I dig it","BillyBrew","Jun 16, 2002"

This was a very unexpected but also a very excellent brew.  I agree with Thrasher, it definitely grows on you.  Every sip that I took made me like this beer more and more.  The dry characteristics are very different but very nice as well.","Murph","Apr 24, 2002"

A familiar flavor that I can't identify, but in entirely new and exciting surroundings. Much more complex and interesting than your standard American ale. Fruity, robust, and satisfying. This is one beer where it really makes a difference if you drink it too cold. Maybe that's why some other reviewers didn't enjoy it as much. If you let it warm up a bit, the malts really shine.","Thrasher","Mar 26, 2002"
