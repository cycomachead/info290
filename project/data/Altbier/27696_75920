I'm not too stuck on "style," but when you say this is an altbier, and I get my tastebuds ready for an altbier, it better be an altbier. This tastes like a Shiner Bock with hints of brown ale, which is cool and all, but I want a real altbier, dammit. Too toasty. Oh, TX brewers, this tastes like the "old ale" from Southern Star. I'm starting to think US brewers just like the NAMES of STYLES and like to tag them to their random half-assed homebrew concoctions. Mouthfeel is so-so. Can't really describe it, just kind of there. Not crazy about this.","goochpunch","May 09, 2013"
