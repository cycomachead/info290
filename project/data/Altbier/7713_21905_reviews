"Overall:  it's OK, but nothing special"

"Notes: Bready/biscuity malt. Golden caramel. Dry apple & minor pear notes from the yeast. Some spicy/floral hop flavors. Really nicely balanced. Firm bitterness. Finishes dry with some residual leafy caramel."

"Not great, but not a bad Alt at all. Certainly it’s a somewhat rare style in my neck of the woods, which is a shame. I drank the hell out of all the Alts I could find when I was going to school in Germany in the late ‘90s, and wish I could find more of the real thing (yeah, I’m glaring at you, Alaskan Amber). Not terribly expensive, and seemingly no worse for wear despite being nearly 5 months past it’s best-by, I might take a chance on this again."

"O: Good drinkability. Classic German Alterbier. Pleasant and recommended"

"TASTE: Crisp, toasted grain, dark bread, dried grass, slightly biscuity, mineral, balancing hop bitterness, mealy apple skin, leafy, slight alcoholic warmth, dry-ish finish"

"Overall this is a pleasant altbier, brings both malt and hop character to the field. Not complex, but it doesn't always have to be, I can respect that."
""
"O- Not complicated, but good all the same. There's nothing mind-blowing but one I would drink again."

"O- Nice enough . Not great."
"2014: on draft at Radler, a little better and not as oxidized. Would give it a 3.25."

"Pretty crisp, easy drinkin Altbier. Not bad, but not worth buying again."
""
"O: Easy to drink and enjoyable - reminds me of a visit to Dortmund a couple of years ago where I enjoyed quite a few of these. Nice flavors and aromas, pretty true to the style in my opinion. Nice complexity and balance."
""

"Taste is nice, lightly toasty, faintly caramelly bread crust sweetness, a nice, gently dominant toasty-woody-grassy bitterness. It's dryish but with noticeable sweetness and bitterness, and an excellent, characterful session beer as a good alt should be."
""
"I used to drink this on a regular basis years ago: I still like it."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a clear coppery amber with a thin, persistent light tan head with some lacing. Mellow aroma of caramel malt with light wheat. Fortunately the skunky whiff I got when opening the bottle was not present in the aroma from the glass. Green bottle, why do they do this? Flavor of caramel and bready malt, finishes with light grassy hops and a long hop and malt aftertaste. Starts slightly sweet and finishes slightly dry. Guess I got a bottle of this soon enough that the skunk had not affected taste. All flavors are pleasant, but very low key and unmemorable. Light to medium bodied. Definitely would consider this as a pleasant dinner beer, but would never buy it again if it is in a green bottle. Not worth taking the chance."
"It suprised me by not totally sucking."

"O: An interesting Altbier, with the dryness and the nettles."

"O: This beer is very easy to drink but the taste might have suffered a bit as a result of the long trip across the pond and the green bottle."

"O: this one might be one for those that like their beers ending with a bitter kick."
"O: Worth a try if you see it around"
"As an Altbier, this doesn't have too much to offer. An over-marketed average beer."
"Pours a nice copper brown color with medium head. Aroma was very nice - sweet, floral, and herbal. Taste was mostly sweet malts with a light herbal hop finish, although on the whole this was a disappointingly weak beer. Very light with decent carbonation, the palate was surprising for something that's supposed to be in the Altbier realm. Also had a weak hop profile compared to other Alt's."
"Mouthfeel felt like an altbier at the onset, but the hops were a bit of a surprise. Not unpleasant, just a little unexpected."
"Grade: One thumb up beer. Wouldn't kill to have it again, although I wouldn't avoid it at all costs."
"Good beer to try: balanced and pleasant"
"D-Nothing I would search for but if you come across it I would give it a try just so you can say you have had one."
"D: Very drinkable, but difficult to place. At times, it seems to be a Bitter, then an Altbier. Still, this qualifies as a solid effort."
"A good beer, with a kind of hardcore old-school vibe. It's easy to imagine this beer being just like this in 1893, you know? Untouched by time and trend and all that..."
"Very good beer wish I could drink this more often."
"A natural tasting and spicy beer, very aromatic. Indeed like an Altbier, only with a little less fruitiness; akin to an English Bitter as well."
"Drinkability: This went very well with my meal and seemed as if it would go well with any meat dish. It also was smooth and interesting enough to make me want it back as a regular back in new york."
"D- Has the drinkability of any good German lager, plus this one has that extra taste complexity that I really enjoyed."
"D: This was very easy to drink. I would definitely have more of this."
"D- I really did feel i was drinking a cross between an 80 shilling and an altbier. All the roasted malt characteristics of these 2 styles with a firm body. Nice, but metallic quality puts me off wanting another"
"The beer poured a clear, red amber color, with tall, very creamy, off-white foam that persisted and clung to the glass. The smell was very nice, with some sweet malt and a hint of noble hops. The taste was richly malty with a touch of sweetness. The hoppiness was modest up front, but became stronger toward the finish. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with medium body and moderate carbonation. It was malty with a good hoppy finish. This was a very drinkable beer."
"This is thoroughly enjoyable."
"D: I could drink quite a few of this beer - it's a nice, well-developed flavor without being heavy; kind of reminiscent of an altbier in that respect."
"M&D: I tend to agree with the last reviewer (paterlodie) that this beer tastes more like a well-lagered, filtered Altbier than a naturally murky Kellerbier, while Sigmund's comment also hits the bull's eye that the moderate level of hop bitterness seems to well balance the mixed maltiness. The finish is slightly sticky rather than consistently clean, but overall this medium-bodied and lightly fizzy bitter amber beer is definitely a thirst-quencher; if only the brewery used real hops rather than hop extract!"
"BB 24-10-06. Nice white head and a brown clear beercolor. Nose is very malty; bit sweetish and with that qyuiet fruity.IMO more like an Altbeer then Pils/Lager( top fermented) and with that also filtered so nowhere near a keller/zwickelbeer. Nice body also and full of taste that's a nice combination of caramel and roastmalt before a well dosed bitterness comes in and takes over. Good sweetness in it too as there is some but not to much and fitting the well dosed other components. Well balanced and enjoyable brew if you like altbeer."
"500 ml heavy dark green swingtop bottle, cool. Bought in Bier Spezi, Hamburg. Amber colour, large to moderate off-white head. Lovely hoppy aroma when pouring, not equally impressive in the glass. For something from Germany called ""Bitterbier"" I kind of expected a hoppy explosion, but the bitterness is actually very moderate. Still, some hops are around, and they are quite well balanced with the malts. Hints of caramel and a certain herbal spiciness too. Unusual style for Germany, but not really remarkable."
"Nice, but not for me. Great bottle, though."
