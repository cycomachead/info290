3.85,-1,3.25,3.75,4,4,3.75,"Beer is medium bodied, with medium to medium-low levels of carbonation, bordering on the line of fizzy, but never crossing it. The result is a lightly effervescent, then foamy and smooth mouthfeel. Ethanol is not detectable at all in this 8.5% ABV brew. Closes semi-dry, with medium level stickiness clinging to the palate.","falloutsnow","Beers"

4.05,4.1,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Picked up a single at Princetons in Maple Grove, MN. Mmmm. Reminds me a bit of a doppelbock for the big fruity tang. A little roasted barley follow it up, but there's a distinct, creamy yeast character that ties the toasty malt to the dry cherry/currant fruit. The finish is dry and crisp and the body isn't too thick. You can take this as a sipper, or treat it as a regular beer. Worth checking out.","tempest","Nov 22, 2011"

3.91,0.5,2.5,4,4,4,4,"This is on the cusp of something special. Clean the particles out and remove the light chunky sourdough/vinegar-y from the yeast flavor, and this becomes one to talk about and search out. It's $11 a six-pack, and probably worth it, even with these gripes.","cokes","Aug 15, 2011"
3.98,2.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Overall this is a richly malty, well-balanced brew. I'd like to see more noble hop presence but age could be a factor as this beer was purchased 3 months ago (and lacks freshness dating).","BrewerB","Jul 15, 2011"
3.96,1.8,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Sweet and sticky, tobacco, almond and walnuts, mild hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Robust and silky, a warming malty blanket envelops and settles over the palate nicely. Full bodied with lower levels of carbonation. Pleasant malty aftertaste of woody tobacco and brown sugar. Very flavorful, and somewhat rich with toffee and notes of caramelized sugars. A tasty beer that was pretty impressive, hope to run across more of this soon.","emerge077","Jul 08, 2011"
4.17,7.2,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"Dark copper into brown colored, a bit of fish food swimming in a pretty hazy brew, small tan head doesnt last too long but contributes to a fair amount of lacing. Scent is thick and syrupy caramel malts, with a bit of alcohol detected. Nice thick sryupy brew, lots of caramel malt, some fruit notes, just a dash of bitter hop, sipicy alcohol. Medium bodied. Pretty nice brew overall.","Tballz420","Jun 19, 2011"
4.23,8.7,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"all in all, one of the more impressive alts I've had in a long while. smooth, solid flavors, clean. all in all, this one hits on all cylinders. not one I'd want a ton of, but as a single, it's exceptional.","djeucalyptus","Jun 13, 2011"
4.26,9.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"O - Uber Alt is a ramped-up version of the German classic that absolutely nails the style while remaining dangerously drinkable. Definitely one of Rush River's best brews, I can see why they call it ""yum-yum juice!""","BeerFMAndy","Jun 02, 2011"
3.7,-4.9,3,3,4,4,4,"""Uber Alt"" is a weighty rendition which brings to mind others (Doppel Sticke, New Glarus Alt...) which are a tough act to follow, but here, the whole is better than the sum of its parts. Worth a try, and is probably worth picking up bottles to lay-down for a spell. Pairs very well with lighter entrees.","Chaz","May 28, 2011"
4.35,11.8,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Really digging this brew. Not sure how well it fits the style, but I'm enjoying it too much to care. Loads of depth, sweetness and character. Time to get me a sixer of this!","jera1350","May 19, 2011"
4.79,23.1,4,5,5,4.5,4.5,"O-Nowhere near as bitter as the alt style typically calls for. That is a good thing in my opinion. All alts from here on out should taste like this one. Rich, malty and decadent. A dynamite beer! Make this the prototype!","ZAP","Apr 27, 2011"
4.47,14.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, I strongly recommend giving this one a try at least once. Well, maybe not if you are an IPA person, but if you dig Scotch Ales, look this one up and give it a shot.","WastingFreetime","Aug 07, 2010"
4.47,14.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a hazy amber color the head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of toast, toffee, light caramel, nuts, and a hint of floral hops. There is a lot going on in this aroma, and it is literally making me salivate. The taste is very malty with a lot of caramel, buttered toast, nuts, light toffee. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a velvety texture, and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a really good beer. It reminds me of Victory Brewing's Ten Years Alt which I was very fond of. I can easily see Uber Alt becoming a regular of mine.","KarlHungus","May 12, 2010"
3.73,-4.1,3.5,3,4,4,4,"On tap at the Black Forest Inn, this brew is a dark orange amber color with a light oatmeal colored, modest head and minor lacing. The aroma brings somewhat nondescript wheat and vague salty malt. The flavor, however, comes on with a licorice herbal hop layered over toffee malt. Decided and satisfying for sure. It has tiny bubble carbonation, sprite in feel with a medium-light body. Pretty drinkable though not a classic session beer. Once you dive in for a taste, it doesn't disappoint, so I recommend you try it and see for yourself. A good backyard quencher when you're not planning on more than a couple...or so.","Durge","Beers"
