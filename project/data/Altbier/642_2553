3.77,2.4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"This 'Altbier' (German for 'old style') style brew pours a pretty copper-amber in color with close to a finger of a off-white foamy head. Some 'ring-like' lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of mostly nutty roasted malts. Pretty much is said for the taste as well with good very light bitter finish that doesn't last too long. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall a tasty brew.","BeerWithMike","Feb 07, 2015"

This is a rather dark beer with a small fuzzy head, and, as advertised, a great balance between malts and hops. The malts will hit you first--smooth, coffee-flavored, full-bodied. Then come the grainy, spicy hops. The flavor is rather pronounced but neither element is very strong. Great beer.","AmyfaceNYC","Mar 21, 2014"

Luckily this hadn't pervaded other aspects of the beer all that much. It's too bad as I really enjoyed their barleywine and that had no off flavors at all.

The smell is rather intoxicating itself but the mouthfeel is smooth and it goes down glass after glass. The taste is slightly sweet and fruity, usually reminding me of plum. It carries a good amount of kick and after 5 I feel like I want one more. It has the right balance between hoppiness and yeast which makes this Altbier a pure delight.","duhbled","Jun 19, 2010"
3.98,8.2,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"D: Very drinkable, for the smooth and fine quality of the malt, a good medium bodied ale with a hefty malt flavor and a light balance of floral hops. This is one of the most popular beers in Lawrence, and it is obvious why. I can only hope Freestate goes national soon.","BeerIsArTT","Mar 26, 2010"
4.15,12.8,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"It's a good choice and recipe for a house beer. Different enough not to be just another amber ale in the portfolio.","JEdmund","Mar 07, 2010"
3.82,3.8,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Free State is an impressive little brewery that is slowly but surly expanding. Their Ad Astra ale is one of their oldest offering but it holds up as a worthy part of their lineup.","Reaper16","Dec 25, 2009"
3.73,1.4,3.5,3,4,4,4,"It is a deep reddish brown, with clarity. The head doesn't last long. It smells and tastes malty, and reminds me of a marzen style beer. It drinks smoothly and cleanly, excellent for accompanying food. A definite favorite.","ZebedeeDuBois","Aug 16, 2009"
4.13,12.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Aroma was mainly malty with mild multigrain and sunflower seed notes. Flavor was similarly bready with some light sweetness that finished dry. There were some notes of earthy hop as it came to room temperature. The body was light for an alt, but this rendered it very drinkable. I drank my half of the growler no problem. Free State is on my radar, hope to visit the brewpub someday.","emerge077","Jul 21, 2008"
3.95,7.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4.5,"The body was full and well rounded, not heavy and very smooth. Drinkability was great, if available to me, this would be a regular quaff. Overall, a wonderful beer that makes me want to visit Kansas.","beertunes","Jun 17, 2008"
3.46,-6,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"D-Not a bad beer but this one was a bit too boring for me. I found nothing exceptional about it. A good ""training wheels"" craft beer","Deuane","Jan 21, 2008"
3.58,-2.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability is fairly high with good flavors.","Goliath","Beers"
3.75,1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3,4,"D - This is a very good alt and yet another good brew from the Free State Brewery.","zeff80","0"
4.18,13.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall this is one of my ""go-to"" beers at Free State. It's a real smooth, easy drinking, award winning beer.","SafeAtFirst","Apr 08, 2006"
3.76,2.2,4,3,4,4,4,"Draught: Mine poured a clear amber color that was tinged with red. It had a bit of an off-white head that left a decent amount of lacing down the glass. The aroma was a bit weak, while still nice. It was somewhat malty and a bit grassy. The taste was much better. A decent maly body without any real sweetness. A bit of a roastiness to it with a hint of coffee. A fair amount of biterness to it. This is really a decent brew.","Boto","Jan 30, 2006"
4.1,11.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Most drinkable!","karst","Aug 26, 2005"
4,8.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Taste was a good balance of malt and hops, citurs and nut. Good finish, wanted more","Mebuzzard","May 08, 2005"
3.48,-5.4,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"As Astra is a pretty good session beer. Not a lot there to overwhelm, but enough to make it interesting. Dark red to brown in color, served with no head. Aromas of backed goods, and some brown sugar. Light sweet toasted flavor with decent bitterness. Light inthe body.","tjthresh","Mar 08, 2005"
4.3,16.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"On draught at Old Chicago in Overland Park, Kansas. Excellent altbier. Pleasant malty aroma and flavor, with nice, rich dark reddish-brown color. Light head that disappears rather quickly. Nice orange aftertaste to go along with initial terrific flavor.","Dansting","Jul 13, 2004"
4.3,16.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This copper hued ale was the first to be brewed in Kansas since the wild west days. This is an easy drinking beer, with a slight sweet edge that is balanced nicely with the hops. Perhaps too easy drinking on a monday night with $1.75 pints on tap. This is excellent beer.","KansasNate","Aug 10, 2003"
3.41,-7.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A good beer, Free State's first, and I believe possibly the first beer brewed in Kansas after it became legal again. A good one to try, and probably try again, but not really that outstanding.","Rio","Feb 07, 2003"
3.04,-17.4,4,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Clear, dark reddish/slightly bronzy hue, served with a thick off-white head, excellent retention, laced well. Clean nose there was a slight dull maltiness disappointing, mute invitation. Moderately flavorsome palate, the maltiness is the focal point, accomplished, the hops play a minor supporting rule, they do add a touch of bitterness. Some caramel and nut hints too. Nicely balanced if not too soft. Modest carbonation. The finish is clean decent enough to drink. Not really that impressive of an offering try something else.","bditty187","Oct 13, 2002"
2.63,-28.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,3,"Deep clear amber color, nice white lasting head, malty bready aroma. Light and sweet caremel malt flavor, some light hop flavor stand out in a clean dry finish, light body and a thin, watery mouthfeel, a good one for microswill drinkers just to bland for me.","maxpower","Apr 19, 2002"
3.33,-9.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"This American amber ale possesses a deep amber color with no head.  The very insignificant aroma is slightly of malt.  A nice smooth heavier body supports a sharp malt sweetness and a lingering bitterness.  The sweetness becomes a bit harsh toward the bottom of the glass, but a latent fruity spice helps to curb it some.","beernut7","Beers"
4.1,11.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Dark orange / copper in color and very clear.  Impressive, thick and sticky head.  Nutty, lightly roasted malt aroma, w/ a mild green and floral Hallertauer nose.  Toasted and dark caramel malt flavors are accompanied by moderate hop bitterness.  The medium body and fairly high carbonation make this brew quite effervescent and refreshing.  The finish is quite dry and tannic, but in a pleasant way.  Ad Astra is an all around very drinkable beer and a fine example of a style that isn't brewed enough.","marc77","0"
