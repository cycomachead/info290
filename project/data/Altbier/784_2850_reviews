"Pours a copper red color with a thin creamy head.  Smell is not overly active, but can smell the malts.  Extremely smooth finish in which Carmel, malts, nuttiness and slight hop comes together very well.  Nothing overbearing.  Very drinkable.  I could drink many of these."

"It's just above average. Not really what I'm used to with this brewer, so slightly disappointing. Everything is muted."
"I liked it more what I scored it than described it. A hoppier version of the style. All in all, a good brew."

"Tyranena Headless Man Amber Alt ---4/5."
"O- This beer is a bit watery with some nice malt hints but also taste like it is a bit old."
"O-A bland boring beer. Other Altbiers (Long Trail's) were more complex but this one brought very little to the table."

"Overall: A solid sessionable amber. Not a beer I would go for every day, but certainly once a month. It has a wonderful combination of toasted malt and earthiness."

"Another middle of the road offering from Tyranena."

"O-its ok, not anything I would go out of my way to get, but definitely wouldn't turn one down"
"Trying the Headless Amber Alt from Tyranena. The beer is v ery interesting....at least for me. The beer is clear rich amber in color and the decent carbonation forms a nice thin head which seems to be lacing nicely. The smell is sweet belgium malt/sugar. The taste includes an earthy zest, almost comes across with a coffee bean zest. There is definite malt and hint of sweetness. The mouthfeel is good, at 5% ABV, it has a huge flavor, and would be a good session beer if you like malty/earthy/peat/coffee tones."
"On tap at the brewery. Amberish colour and a small head. Neutral aroma. Lots of caramel, little bitterness. Low carbonation. Not so drinkable. A tad of complexity, caramel,coffee grounds, chocolate, and some spice, but need more complexity. Good ideas not well executed."
"Overall- I think it is a very solid altbier, haven’t had one in years, and this was pretty enjoyable, and you could definitely session this. I would probably drink it again."
"Cheers!"
"Overall a drinkable malty session beer."
"Its ok overall, clearly a bit flawed with the lingering sourness, but it almost adds a little something that would otherwise be missing."
"Overall not bad. I am not really sure one would look for this one in any way, but you really cannot complain too much about it"
"Overall, I give this one props as a fine session ale, enjoyable and well balanced."
"It is tasty, and easy drinking, but not a beer to rave about."
"Finally, my first Altbier! This one pours a cloudy dark amber in color with a white lacing around the glass. The aromas are very sweet. I'm picking up a lot of malt with light yeast. There is also some dark fruit apparent. The taste too is of sweet maltiness. It has a little fruityness to it but they're hard to define. It's kind of like a potpourri. It drinks medium in body and isn't too bad. It isn't too good either. This seems like a wannabe Belgian. It definitely doesn't seem German. This one is average at best. I'll have to try the Uerige Sticke next."
"I liked the mellow blend fruit and sweetness here and the body helped keep this approachable but the hop profile just seemed to come get in the way a bit too much, leaving this with an unbalanced feel overall. This is an interesting Alt for sure. I'd be willing to give it another look sometime."
"Another beer thanks to my brother's random buying habits. (Lovin' it.) It pours a sunrise russet-amber topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises mild toffee, very light buttery biscuits, light greens, and a hint of orange peel. It's all meek and ineffective. The taste holds notes of grass, wheat, light orange peel, very light buttery biscuits, and greens. With all the meekness, this beer must be inheriting a larger portion of the Earth than others. Not only is it mild, though, but it's overly grassy and leafy, with nothing else going on. Kinda odd, if you ask me. The body is a straight medium, with a just-under-moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a sad beer, one that just doesn't seem to accomplish anything but disappointing."
"All of the Tyranena beers have good names, artwork and stories on the bottles and this one is no different. I enjoyed this beer and would recommend it."
"All in all this brew was lighter side of medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation and a semi creamy texture."
"Nothing special but enjoyable. Easy drinking and refreshing. I wish I could describe the taste and smell better...but I don't get very much."
"Pours a moderate amber color with a bit of an off white head and some mild lacing. The nose brings forward some mild sweetness with a bit of caramel and bread. The taste doesn't bring much more--a bit of dough, caramel, and toffee. The body is light to medium with decent depth. Drinks okay, but not a terribly eventful beer."
"Drinkability - I'm not crazy about this beer. It's something different and it has that trademark Tyranena fun about it, but I'm not sure I'd purchase this again. Maybe its the style."
"D: Pretty quaffable. I find German style beers improve by the second or third glass, and I can see this happening here. It's nice to see a bottled American Altbier around, precisely because I love drinking them over the long term. This one's fine. It scratches the itch, but doesn't blow me away."
"Overall drinkable though one of the weaker Tyranena brews that I've had."
"Highly sessionable, Headless Man is a smooth, well-balanced Altbier with a refreshing, thirst-quenching drinkability."
"D: unlike most beers from this company, i cannot really recommend this. it is not a bad beer but not overly exciting and the dry, bitter flavor is just a bit much for me and this style"
"light-medium bodied with a smooth mouth-feel and lightly dry finish."
"D-Very easy drinking nice sipper from Tyranena."
"Really not a ton of complexity, just a simple beer to sip, and I'm glad to have tried it (for free), but there are more worthy brews to be had."
"D - This is a very drinkable brew. The excellent flavor followed by a low ABV makes this a brew you could session during the Summer months. An excellent brew from Tyranena."
"(D)- A decent beer with some basic flavors. Easy enough to drink & enjoy."
"D - This is an easy-to-drink, tasty, sessionable beer. Recommended."
"D: A nice red/amber ale for spring. I would drink this again, however I think there are better examples of this style of beer."
"I liked this one. I can see having a few of these."
"D-Meh. I like other alt beers I had, but I'm not sure how drinkable this one is on an overall experience."
"D: Good. Very drinkable, almost sessionable, though I believe this is more of a result of crafting this beer for mass appeal, more than anything else."
"This was not fantastic by any means but a nice good consistent beer. Its an ""everyday"" beer. Don't expect to impress people with this one. On par with leinenkugel's amber."
"Picked up a single at Princeton Liquors in Maple Grove for about $2. The beer has a tall light tan head with a hazy amber-red body. The flavor is akin to a typical, dry red ale with a fair share of hops. The malt provide a mild toffee and dried date. The hops quickly kick in after the malt with grapefruit and orange rind flavor that offers a nice balance to the barley. Oddly enough, the aroma remind me of a sugar cookie with dark bread notes, no hint of hops. All in all, a decent and dry amber that about as hoppy as your average pale ale, but with richer malt character. The overall feel is almost astringent with the combination of hop bitterness and dry malts, but it's otherwise very drinkable."
"Pours a nice hazy red color, maybe some orange, a little lighter than red, with a decent 1 cm head. It falls back kind of quickly leaving a bit of a ring which leaves only a bit of lacing. Decent looking. A little more clarity would be nice. The smell is pretty good. And interesting caramelly toastiness comes up front. Something is a little fruity, something is a little herbal and spicy - minty a bit, and something is a little leafy. The nice breadiness in here makes this one interesting. I really love the taste of altbiers - I think it's an amazing blend of what I like about German lagers and American ales. The malt body is really interesting too. It's like a nice nutty bready taste, with this minty sugar syrup poured on top of it. I really like it - it tastes fairly clean, with just a hint of fruity flavors. I like the graininess too, that isn't a flavor that comes out in other ale styles. The body is nice, medium full, a nice rush of carbonation, and a little bite in the finish. The drink is pretty good. Enjoyable, nice and light, a bit clean, the flavors are nice. I could probably drink quite a few of these - and I find that to be quite normal with the style."
"D: I'm not really enjoying this very much, though I'd love to try a fresher bottle."
"D - Brewed for drinkability, this beer has the flavor of an ale with the mouthfeel of a lager while being complex yet session-able. Very tasty and drinkable, I would partake in this beer any time it's available. It's a great example of a Dusseldorf-alt beer."
"Pours a clear, copper color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing. Smells of sweet malt, slight hops, citrus, smoke, maybe caramel, and slight earthy malt. Fits the style of an Altbier. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, roasted malt, hops, earthy malt, and hints of smoke in the background. Overall, a pretty solid Altbier with good body and decent complexity."
"Purchased from Ray's Liquor's in Wauwatosa, WI. Poured into the perfect pint glass, it shows a nice amber color and a puffy white head. The aroma is malty and bready. Has a medium body and crisp mouthfeel. Toasted sweet caramel flavors with a low amount of bitterness in the finish. Good drinkability. Nothing out of the ordinary here, but tasty brew."
"D= good. Ill have many in a night no problem but not very interesting"
"Mouthfeel is light bodied and smooth with good carbonation."
"Pours a rusty copper and amber hue. Very quick head and no foam, bu some nice sporadic bubbling. Sweet toastd malts give off a strong caramel aroma with some light lemon hop aromas. Starts with crisp gypsum hopsand hard water flavors. The sweet toasted alt malt slowly comes through to the end. Very crisp, sweet, and very smooth beer. Great session alt, but he overall flavor is a bit thin."
"D: Not a session beer. Good, but a very good single beer to have, and enjoy."
"pours a clear copper/deep amber with a minimal creamy head/lacing. bready caramel malts and some dark stone fruits in the aroma. taste is just a bit of sweetness from the caramelly malts and an underlying hop bitterness cleaning it out. finish has a bit of tea-like astringency to it. light/med bodied. maybe i'm spoiled from having german alts on tap before but this could have used a bit more malt sweetness/character and not have the astringent quality to it. also a bit more carbonation would have elevated the mouthfeel. still a very nice sessionable brew, a style i'd like to see more of."
"Appearance is a copper or deep gold color. I don't know what I can add for smell or atase. There was not much of a defining characteristic for me. Although if you have ever had NG's ALT, this one (tyranena's) was better. Drinkability was pretty good."
"D- Pretty easy drinking, nothing great about this beer that makes me want to have it again. Not bad, not great."
"Mouthfeel was active and mouth-filling carbonation. Medium to light body. Solid all around."
"D: Not the best amber or alt that I have, but the story behind it is pretty nice."
"Drinks fairly easy, a pretty good Alt, but I expected more from these guys"
"D - Its not something to drink all night. Have one early in the evening while you can appreciate it and its complexity. Almost drinks too fast and lets the details escape you."
"D - This a pretty solid brew overall. For inexperienced drinkers this one maybe a little harder to drink because of the bitterness that is evident in this beer."
"It's nice to see a domestic brewer crank out a respectable Alt. Even though I felt the carbonation was a little high, it's still worth checking out."
"My first experience with this brewery is a good one...dark golen in color..pretty clear which this style should be...a nice creamy white lace....GREAT nose...grains/malt...and a herbal hop smell as well....the taste is nice...clean maltiness accented by a dry herbal hop finish....maybe a little too hopped up for my liking but I am still getting to know this style...definitely finishes on a dry note...a pretty nice little brew....thanks to Cokes via BigHugey for the beer..=4.1-Bottle"
"D: Pretty complex for a 5% brew. Drinkable and low ABV."
"D- Nothing outstanding but would drink again if offered to me. I don't think I would go out of the way for this beer. However, it was a very simple beer that I would recommend to those that like red/brown beers."
"Paired this up with Jasper Hill bandage-wrapped cheddar."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to drink for a while but it's not the first one that I would choose in the style."
"This beer pours a dark cloudy amber with basically no head. The smell is of nuts and apricots. The taste is ok, I must admit I am not an altbier fan but this one is better than the other one I have tasted. Its kind of like you are going to get a big citrusy hop bite like a DIPA but it never happens and the flavor fades rather fast. Not the greatest after taste/mouthfeel after you swallow, and its a drinkable beer just not something I would go out of my way to attain. Overall a pretty good beer."
"D-Very drinkable, and a good summer session beer, but as a a tremendous fan of this brewery, this is the first one I'm not a big fan of."
"I will have to try this style more to sanity check this review, as I'm not sure I have a beer to test against yet."
"D -- Very nice. This is the first alt beer Ive ever had. I like it."
"D -- Very good. I hadn't had this beer in a while and received a bottle in trade, I'll be hunting down more!"
"Thanks to Maximum12 for this extra! Poured into a teardrop glass. Deep orange/brown color with a good amount of haze and thick head with an aggressive pour. Not much on the nose- perhaps some caramel and malt. Smooth full flavor. Good malt backbone with a lingering sweet finish. Smooth mouthfeel and very drinkable. Not my favorite, but another fine beer from this brewery."
"This is a medium to light bodied beer. There is a good level of carbonation that gives a little bite to the tongue."
"I like this one, it came through very well for the style and was memorable."
"Pours a nice golden amber color, nice little creamy tannish head, nice carbonation, leaves some nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, very slight hop, and some caramel. The taste pretty much follows the nose. The finish is slightly dry/bitter. Medium body. Drinkable, I like this one, glad to get to try it out. Thanks Daniel."
"D- solid amber beer."
"Thanks to Beertracker for trying to get me to warm up to Altbiers. Pours a nice amber (duh) color with near perfect clarity. Absolutely no head at all, I suppose next time I should pour harder, I didn't exactly ease it into the glass this time. Smells of light German malts and toffee, little to no hops present. However, hops tingle the tongue upon tasting. As it warms the toffee becomes more prominent. Nice earthiness in the tail end with some light malt flavors. Soft spicey hops develop in the aftertaste. A nice easy drinking medium bodied beer. A much better Altbier than my previous experience even without a head."
"Pours a deep amber in color. Moderate carbonation and lacing shows up as well. Smells of great malts: caramel, some subtle fruits, some toasted bread. Taste brings forth a good hop presence. Somewhat spicy and a good compliment to the brew. Mostly about the malts. Nice silky, refreshing mouthfeel. A good session brew if I do say so myself."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a burnt orange color with a slight tan head leaving minimal lacing. The smell of this brew is almost nonexistent. There was a slight roasted smell of malt and minimal hints of earthy tones. The taste is of mild hops and rich malts. There is a good balance leaving traces of the bitterness in your mouth. Medium body with mild carbonation. This brew is decent, but that's all. Not enough to merit going out and buying a sixer."
"Drinkability: A good, well-balanced beer and a real quaff sensation."
"overall, this is a very good brew"
"drinkability is good. this brew is not too heavy or bold, but smooth and refined. nicely crafted. altbier is a style that is often overlooked, and Tyranena has done a solid job at creating a good example of one. cheers!"
"This beer pours a clear copper color with an off-white head that settles to a solid cap. Lots of sticky lacing coats the glass. A very attractive beer that justs exudes quality. The smells are faint but hints of sweet malt and toffee. The taste is just that as a sweet malt is dominate with a hint of toffee. It leaves a creamy coating and a light/medium body. Very pleasant all around and a low ABV makes this a easy drinking beer. Definately will be buying this again when in need of a lighter tasting sessionable beer."
"Pours a copper-ish orange color with a white head. In the aroma, somewhat skunky and a sweet malt. In the taste, a sweet skunky malt, just like it smells, A smooth malty mouthfeel and a dry malty aftertaste. OK, malty and kind of skunky, nothing really that great."
"Solid Alt from Tyranena. Probably my least favorite from them I've tried so far but a solid example none-the-less. The only reason this is my least favorite is because every other beer from Tyranena I've sampled has been from really good to spectacular."
"Easy to drink a few of these."
"This beer pours a clear amber color. The head is large, billowy and off-white in color. The aroma is of malty with a nice caramel and floral notes, but is rather faint. The taste is very balanced with caramel up front and flower in the background. The mouthfeel medium bodied with nice carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a pretty good beer. I can see myself drinking this again."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with a plenty of carbonation. An easy drinking alt that ends up being quite refreshing too. Overall, Headless Man is a tasty brew from Tyranena and one of my favorites from the regular lineup."
"A nice session beer."
"All in all this is a fine ale. If you are looking for bold powerful flavor, this is not where to find it. If you are looking for a pleasing relaxing and refreshing ale, please, sir or madam, drink up!"
"Good solid beer. Served with a nice full head and plenty of lace. Very nice reddish color. Mild aroma. Super balanced. Malty, caramely and a little dry. Definitely a session beer. Good body. Nice clean and easy finsih. Reminds me of their fighting finches mai bock."
"Drinkability - good session pick, props to jj21 for this sample."
"Quite enjoyable! A very clean, well-brewed ale that exemplifies the altbier style nicely. Well done!"
"Overall, I would recommend this beer."
"There is no real backbone to the beer, very light for the style. There is also little to no head or lacing. It drinks decent but only because the flavor is rather weak. The malt has a decent flavor, but again is underdone."
"Drinkability: Overall, I think I could have a few of these. There just aren't any tremendous flavors to keep me here too long."
"12 ounce bottle. Thanks afatty!"
"Not overdone in any way and all the better for it - just a solid, good tasting Alt. Thanks to BA KeffKrenner for the bottle!"
"Da good session brew in this one, I would have it again for sure."
"This is a very drinkable lager. Would make great session/crossover fare. Im sure ill be enjoying this one again sometime."
"Pours a medium/dark amber-orange with a finger of off-white head that fades to a soapy film. Nose starts off with a blast of metallic-copper-rust, grainy malt, caramel and toasted nuts. If there's such a thing as a ""Nut Bomb"" this is it. Nuttier than most nut browns I've tried, along with loads of bready/caramel sweet malt and a mild hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisply carbonated on the tongue but silky smooth in the mouth. This is a hell of a drinker - plenty of flavor, light-bodied, refreshing. Again, this beer is nut-rageous, so if that's not your thing, well, you've been warned. Otherwise, seek this one out. Another winner from Lake Mills."
"drinkability: sessionable"
"While it's hard to say that anything really stands-out to make this beer exceptional, it might be slightly better than the sum of its parts. It's certainly a quality beer, quite drinkable, and I highly recommend it. Try pairing this with brats or pork for a special treat."
"Minimal carbonation yet decent white foam with minimal retention. Color iswellold amber Creamy-sweet nose with a big floral/lemon element. Tastes sweet, almost cloying with touches of whiskey, caramel, and sugar in the raw. Laid back but well hopped. Bitter, floral finish. Clean, drinkable, and very enjoyable. Doesnt seem to fit too well in the style but Im no Alt expert so what the hay, Ill give it the benefit of the doubt."
"Drinkability: Oh, you could throw back about fifteen of these, but you still wouldn't get much character. An altbier is apparently an aged brown ale, but this is definitely amber/red territory."
"Pours a rich golden amber color, with a very fizzy yellow head. Aroma is caramel malts and noble german hops, spicy like. Taste is doughy and bread like up front. There is some definite nuttiness to the taste as well. Some hop bite is apparent at the end, again its a spicy noble hop presence. There is somewhat of a metallic aftertaste present to this beer as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, not too light. A great session brew here. Not sure how stylistically sound this example is, as it is my first, but I will now definitely explore."
"Pours out to a dark amber in the glass with a moderate-sized head. Aroma is that of biscuit dough and malt. The taste is malty with a residual, light sweetness on the swallow. This would be a good thirst quencher on a warm day. (Thanks to fantome for the offering)."
"This beer pours out a clear amber color with an off-white head. Malty aroma. The flavor is caramel malt with some tangy fruitiness. There is not much complexity to the flavor, but it is still tasty. A little hop bitterness, but the flavor is mainly malt. I would like this beer more if it were a little more crisp. Decent drinkability."
"Dark amber color, faint malt aroma , little or no head, slight malt sweetness along with the taste of yeast or some adjunct, rather thin on the palate. I think I had this on tap once and it was a little better, but for the time being, I'm going to pass on the bottles."
"Drinkability: ummm, not a great beer that offers a hell of a lot but yet it is an easy drinker that goes down not half bad. make sense? i didn't think so. im up in the air over this one."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1/2"" of light beige head over the orangey-honey hued brew. A little light in color for what I would expect from an alt, but the lacing is okay. Aroma is minimal, and what is present is reasonably neutral, with some apple or fruit notes. Taste is caramel malt, tempered with some crisp fruity flavors, similar to the nose. Not sure if it's what I think an alt should be, but standing on its own merits, it's not bad. Mouthfeel is good, and drinkability is even better."
"Clear medium amber appearance, nice head of sustainable 1/4 inch foam after about 30 seconds. Simple lace, slipping strings on the glass. Malty aroma, candied apple and malted milk with slight esters. Mouthfeel is shy of medium but sub creamy. Flavor is well-tempered and laid out, sort of unfolding like a ball of caramel rolling down a caramel hill. Looked for more hopping, just a slight sense of pepper and a nut skin sense give an impression of bittering. A very pleasant beer in drinkability, I just get more snap from some Alts and there's a bit of ragged texture here at the end of the glass that takes away from its initial smoothness."
"An Old Headless Cheers to BigHuge for this one."
"Mouthfeel is very nice, but the chalkiness on the finish distracts. Nice level of carbonation. A very nice beer for a session, but would be excellent if a bit better balanced. Many thanks to Ave for the sample!"
"Pours amber in color with a thick off-white head. Aroma consists of roasted malt, caramel and hops. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth. Taste primarily consists of sweet caramel malt. Hop and malt balance are pretty nice. Dry, cleansing finish. Actually turned out to be a refreshing beer on a hot day."
"A fine session ale, refreshing, and generous with flavor."
"A nice aber color with fluffy, white, thick head. The aroma is floral hops and sweet malt but not overly strong.It has a spritzy carbonation at first with a malty beginning finishing dry and flowery. The body is light to medium and punches in a higher level of hops than the German style. A nice session brew or after a good bike ride."
"Thanks jeffboo!"
"Lacy white head and a nice pale amber color. Citrusy and nut aromas are most evident. Sweetness is very prevalent in the taste with a nice hop bite near the finish. Finish itself is rather dry with a slight roasted character. Overall a pretty decent beer, but there are better out there."
"This medium bodied alt style brew presents with a rich copper color and creamy off-white head.  German yeast and bready hops control the aroma.  The creamy body and sweet malts are balanced very well by a strong, but not overpowering hop presence. Quite a good beer."
"This beer is a perfect copper shade with a thin tan head.  A hugely sweet caramel maltiness is dominant on the nose.  Pretty nice.  Taste is predominantly malt.  (This is definitely not on the high side of the spectrum for hop rates in an alt.)  It has a really nice clean malty taste.  Different from a malty bock taste though.  This is more toasty and non complex.   Very mellow tasting, as it should be from the extended cold lagering that this ale undergoes.  And if anything, the hops that are used add a touch of dryness to the finish."
"Quite a solid altbier. I am glad to have it around, as it is my beer of choice in just about any situation. I likely drink this more than any other single beer, as it is my ""go-to"" session brew."
