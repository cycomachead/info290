"As I stated earlier, a unique hybrid. Nice to see a holiday-themed brew doing something besides adding spices. This beer may not truly understand what it actually is, beyond fairly delicious."

"Decent beer, not my style"

"Great looking beer. Glowing dark brown with a creamy off-white head. A decent Winter seasonal, but MUCH stronger and hoppier than a real Alt. Considering the seasonal competition, I wouldn't get it again though."

"Pours a deep, dark nut-brown with a thin lacy head. Tasted just plain awesome, with thick, sweet notes of molasses and malt with a refreshing evergreen hop bite. Went down smooth and easy despite the ABV. I didn't get to try a whole lot of it for myself, but I'm glad I didn't give it all away!"
""
""
"Overall this is a nice seasonal.  Unfortunately I did not see that this comes in a sixer format.  Will definitely pick up a sixer for next year!"
"To me this drinks more like a strong ale than an alt. Really enjoyable and the malty sweetness and slight hoppiness paired very well with the halibut I had it with. I've gotten out of the habit of buying Ninkasi, but this was leftover from a six pack that my son in law had bought, so I'm glad he left it! I'd definitely buy this once in a while during the winter season."

"This seasonal release poured a nice dark brown. It's nose was a slight nuttiness with a hint of molasses. Strong coffee flavour with some caramel in the mouth as well as some hoppiness that wasn't very prevalent on the nose."

"Competent. Quite bitter, yet well balanced. Not as rich a mouthfeel as I'd expect from the look and taste. Would like more malt here."

"A strange, and very American re-telling of an old European story - y'know, boozing and hopping up an Altbier, not to mention trying to pass it off as a holiday seasonal.  Well, they seem to have succeeded on all fronts, as despite this one's weird astringency, it still goes down well in the face of snowfalls and stupidly overcrowded shopping expeditions alike.  Oh, and I suppose I can let some ""Bloodline"" roll, in honour of punny names everywhere."

"T: High malt character. Some dark fruit flavors and perfume from hops. Kola nut flavor really reminds me of Christmas, but just because of those Coca-Cola cans. Still, this beer works psychologically. Probably not as good as the rating suggests. Earthy flavors and very nut-like finish. Slight metallics really linger in the aftertaste."
"Malty and earthy from what I'm guessing is noble hops. Not my normal style of beer I would choose but I got it because I was going to a slayer concert. It was a hit with all the people going. I think it was more on the novelty of it, but it was a fun beer to try."

"Pours a lovely brown with ruby tint to it. A head of tan foam that fell fast.  Nose is a pleasant malt that smells dry and deep.  It has the beginings of what might have been dark fruit but it was forbidden. So tempting with it's sweetness and rich scents.  Perfect clarity form this beer. It glows softly from within to sport those garnet hues like a hidden gem deep within the beer.  Malt is rich and extends beyond the beers  time on the palate.  it seems to go on forever. It has a dry crispness in and of itself  it has a bit of bitterness in the finish.  caramel is laid under the dry malt. it's as though the heartier aspects wanted to be up front and so they stayed there.  It has a medium mouthfeel  and it is appropriately thin on the palate. It is not weighted down or heavy even though the malt is substantial.  it finishes dry and with that bitterness that is a bit of a surprise but it makes you smile. The richness has abated for a moment, like it's toying with you. This is a lovely altbier and I think it's one of the best american alts I have had.  It's clean and crisp. Relatively bitter"

"Poured a clear, deep brown body with reddish tint when held to light and a one finger bubbly off-white head. A very nice looking, true to form altbier. Scents of rich, sweet malt, light fruity esters reminiscent of apple and grape and a medium level of Noble hop perfume, floral and spicy, especially pepper, aromas. Overall impression of aroma is of a classic, very well executed Dusseldorf Altbier that hits the style exactly. Extremely well done. Flavor begins moderately bitter with a floral and perfume-like Noble hop presence evident, a light fruitiness that matches the aroma and a medium-light level of sweet malt. This moves into a middle with the same Noble hop character, but adds a more pronounced and complex malt flavor that is sweet and slightly bready in character. Fruity ester flavors are still present, still light and still apple with a bit of grape. Finish is medium-dry with a moderate Noble hop character and prominent hop bitterness, light fruity esters of apple, light toasted malt and nuttiness and a clean finish. Aftertaste is moderately bitter with a medium-light presence of sweet, bready, grainy and biscuity malt flavors. Overall impression of flavor is of a nicely done Dusseldorf Altbier that trends towards the bitter end of the style, yet fits it quite nicely. Well executed and enjoyable. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall impression of mouthfeel is of an excellent and true to form Dusseldorf Altbier. Overall this is a good Altbier. It is very true to style and pleasant in aroma, flavor and mouthfeel. It is a nicely done, aromatic, flavorful ale and quite nice."

"Overall, this is tasty and worth checking out."

"Quite dark and slightly reddish hue, with tan head. Taste is toasted malts, pretty bitter but smooth."
"Overall â€“ Very malty and grainy with a lower level of sweetness.  Not a bad altbier, but not the easiest drinking either.  A nice one to try and good if you are not feeling anything sweet."

"Overall, it's a really good beer and shouldn't necessarily be a winter beer as this would be good year round with that dry bitter finish. Really happy a friend from just north of the Washington-Oregon state line sent me this."

"O - A decent beer and not what I expected. Would like to for it to have had a little more flavor and aroma. It was a little dissappointing. Still, an enjoyable beer overall."
"O - Aside from boosting my egoism and having a name that made me want to enjoy this with Hell's Angels in a pool room. This was very subtle, everything is balanced, just wished it was brought out more. With a name like Sleigh, this is not a beefed up beer of this style."
""

"Over all I have to recommend this to anyone that likes darker sessionable beers. It's almost in the realm of a stout or porter, but not quite there."

"Overall an easy drinking beer and quite similar to many ""winter warmers."" Alcohol level is on the high side but is mostly hidden by all the rich flavors. Recommended."
""
"Overall: I had high hopes for a beer that bared the name of the almighty thrash lords known as slayer. It did not let me down. I need to blast some altar of sacrifice while I enjoy this. I'd recommend this beer to any metal or hop head."
"defiantly a beer worthy of slayers name"
""

"Overall a very enjoyable beer. Glad Ninkasi is holding it down for us folks here in Oregon."

"I was drinking some of this around the holidays, and thought it bit hoppy for my taste. Oftentimes, I think many craft beers, particularly those brewed on the west coast, suffer from too much of a good thing (hops). The hops in this beer seem a tad bit toned down after the interim of about 4 months, and I found myself enjoying this a bit more than at Christmastime. Now that it's come down a bit in price, I'm liable to get another bomber or two before it's gone."

"Slightly chalky palate with a well balanced, bitter finish. Would buy again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A decent session beer. It's 10 below right now but I still can't quite call this something for winter with such a mild taste."
""
"I bought it because I love the Slayer homage on the label, but thought it was average at best."
""
"I definitely prefer this beer on the warmer side, although it is still good cold/chilled."
""
""
""
"Deep dark brown with reddish hues. Substantial off white head that slowly recedes to a fluffy cloud like lacing. Aromas of fruity malt, dough and alcohol. Mild sweetness up front with a bittersweet finish. Finish is dry and slightly bitter. Alcohol flavor definately comes through as well. Slight roasted chocolate and cola notes. Nice smooth and creamy body with medium carbonation. It has a good feel and is drinkable but there are some strange flavor notes here that I'm not that crazy about. I'd have again but probably wouldn't seek it out."
""
"Note to reader: I had a raspberry candy before imbibing and after review of other reviews, this may have had an affect on my perception of this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This may be too malty for me (and not yeasty enough, which is what I enjoy most in ""dubbel"" styled beers), but it isn't bad at all, especially when consumed chilled. Warmed up is a different story altogether, but I'll probably have another for the holidays. Worth a try, as it's quite experimental in some ways."
""
""
"Delicious and a great take on combining a holiday ale and alt styles."
""
""
""
"Overall - This is a solid winter seasonal, though I'm a bit perplexed at labeling this a ""double alt"" when I've had standard alts with just as much flavor and ABV. Still, I'm enjoying the brew, and may be a future purchase."
""
""
""
"O: Not a fan, to be honest. It's an okay beer, and I wouldn't recommmend or have again; but still, I'm not a huge fan of altbier in general."
""
""
"O- Very malt forward and not really any hop presence, which is rare for a Ninkasi beer (even their oatmeal stout is pretty bitter hop bomb)."
"O- I love it. Tastes hoppier than I would expect from a dark double atlbier (though I've never had an ale described exactly like that before this), but less bitter than the IBU rating had me bracing for - this hoppiness works brilliantly for such a sweet beer."
"This was a pretty good beer, although I think it could have been better. Iâ€™m a sucker to chocolate and cherry in the beer and it worked here, but not as much as I would have liked."
""
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt and caramel. Taste is much the same with a herbal hop flavor on the finish. There is a medium bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but I am liking the smell over the taste."
""
"Medium Dark brown when poured, with very little foam, but, a fair amount of lace on the side of the glass. The smell of roasted malts, caramel, fruit and spices was sort of weak, but after a few more sniff's, you could pick it up. The taste was of roasted malts, bitter/sweet dark caramel and a hint of dark bitter chocolate. On the palate, the 7.2% alcohol wasn't that much a factor. The bitter flavorless taste linger just to much. Overall, it could have been a touch softer."

"M - Light to medium body. Light carbonation."
""
"D - Very drinkable. Nicely balanced Double Altbier. Nice malty backbone with some dark fruit, chocolate, and yeast character to balance."
""
""
""
""
"O: Good stuff at this age, the alcohol seems to be stronger and the hops a little less. Might have let it sit a little too long but it is still one of my favorites."
""
""
"Review from 11/2010 notes. Poured into a Nostradamus flute glass. Pours a dark brown with red highlights; light head and lacing. Aroma of fruit, bread and malt. Medium body. Malty flavor with a peppery bite in the middle. Roasty and dark malt, light fruit, a bit of nut, some cocoa, mild hops. Dry spicy finish. A nice revisitable seasonal ale. This really grew on me as I finished the glass."

"The appearance turned out to be...eh, not bad. The lacing was there, but it wasn't that pretty. It was somewhat patchy and EXTREMELY soapy and bubbly. It didn't look like your average lacing at all, rather - worse than average. I'm not quite sure how to grade this because the head was nice. The body wasn't really amazing, but better than average I supposed, for sure unique regardless. The lacing wasn't bad, just...not my cup of tea. I'm going to give it a 3.5 for appearance. I could give it a 4 but...I wouldn't say I've cut this beer any breaks, but there have been a few grades that I gave a 4 to instead of a 3.5 already."
""
"Overall, solid and smooth. A nice winter brew, and mild given the biggish ABV."
""
""
""
""
""
"If your looking for a malt-centric beer to cuddle up to while waiting for Santa, this may be a good stocking stuffer."
""
""
"While the aroma doesn't lead you to expect much, this packs a singular malty punch without excessive astringency. The specialty malts are well displayed but in no way overwhelm the base malts."
""
"D:3.5 so so. not too complex."
"it has a sweet smell almost flowery and has no head at all very weak no foam at the top. smalls like nail polish very alcholic heavy mouth feel but can seem moderate aond some what watery has a very sour taste with a bitter finish it lingers little but not to much when you swollow i didnt like it myself but it i liked beer i might"
"overall - tasty malty beverage from ninkasi, not their best, not their worst"
""
""
""
"Overall: This is a good winter beer and I would recommend it and drink it again"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good Christmas beer, but some more sweetness on the palate would go a long way to balance it out."
""
""
"Nothing too special, but an enjoyable beer. Good flavor, and easy to drink. Has a wintertime feel, but neither too sweet nor too strong."
""
""
""
"Not bad all up, but a little average. The problem is that it's not that interesting, and it's not even that classically ""Altbier"". Solid enough on its own terms, but Ninkasi can do better."
"A drinkable brown ale in an unusual style. I doubt I'll see this after the holidays, but ti was fine while it was here."
""
""
"On the brewery's website it mentions this has an IBU of 50. So I was a bit confused because the draft form of this I had was a chocolate malt bomb that had bitter chocolate flavor and no hop bitterness. However it was not a bitterness I would rate at 50. It pours a very dark brown, almost black, as the label indicates. It formed a white head, which indicated that this was not as dense or containing as much roasty tones of a stout but was going to be an interesting experience. When I smelled it, it really did not have much of a scent due to it just being taken out of the fridge. But there was a bit of that dark malt scent. After the first taste, you get that maltiness up front and through the rest of the sip. There are no hops but was a bit disappointed that the chocolatey malts I got on draft was not in the bottle. It was kind of subtle. So this is totally a draft beer for sure. The mouthfeel was medium and the carbonation was the way you would want it. Overall, I gave this a 4 because its a solid beer but get it on draft. Its a much more pleasant experience."
""
""
"I'm not really sure what a dark double alt is, but this is a decent winter warmer."
""
"Itâ€™s a unique one, and itâ€™s tastyâ€”not your typical holiday ale!"
"D - Nice alt for how big this beer is. I was afraid it might be a bit sweet but it is nicely balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Has too many big minuses for me to give it a great grade. Smell is weak, taste is weak, and mouthfeel is weird. That being said, I might actually buy this again. Something about it strikes me. Maybe it is the 7.2 percent ABV."
""
"O: It's decent. Nothing special at all. Nothing bad."
""
"Again, I've yet to have anything negative to say about anything from Ninkasi Brewing! Check this one out, or anything else they offer. Great stuff!"
""
""
"O - Overall this was an interesting beer, almost reminds me of some Chinook hopped beers, but I could be wrong. Good if you like malty beers and some aftertaste, not too hoppy. Not sure of this thing though, it kinda confuses me.... But good beer."
""
"I'm not an alt expert, but this one is clearly more northwest winter warmer, or even American red, than an authentic German altbier. Seems to me anyway. And that's just fine, because it's the quality that counts, and this one delivers."
""
""
""
""
""
"A double dark Alt turns out to be a winter warmer by any other name but this is one for the maltier side. You can taste the hops but the big strong malt comes through in the finish. Quite drinkable and most likely a canidate for one year in the cellar I thought this one the money and tsting close to Full Sail's Wassail."
"O: Really enjoyable after warming a bit; it'll be nice to work through the six-pack during these dark evenings."
"Pretty good all around; not to sweet or spicy. The abv seems reasonable, too. I'm not sure about the style, but whatever."
"O - Liking this beer a lot. Definitely on the malty side, but has a nice slight spice and long bitterness. I like the warm balance it creates with the alcohol. Went great with my lamb sausage. Sweet beer, smoky lamb."
"O: Pretty drinkable for 7.2 ABV"
"Overall a tasty beer. The extra hops was a mistake though, it covers up flavors and gives this an astringent edge."
"This is a nice take on the style. A pretty straightforward take with some nice simple flavors and aromas but it's done well and works well."
"Taste is quite malty as to be expected with the style, there's a nice earthy and slightly sharp flavor that rounds it is out well, it doesn't seem syrupy or overly sweet but it's making my lips sticky..."
"D - Drinks extremely easy and smooth."
"Pours a moderate caramel-brown color. Really, really murky without any real head formation or lacing afterward. The nose brings some light caramel and toffee plus a bit of bready easta nd some light toast. Flavor is mostly just a touch of caramel with some very light hopping and then some bread. Mouthfeel is medium with a bit of booze. Not bad, but not something I'd look for again."
"Great beer has got to be the #1 reason to live in the Northwest. Ninkasi is producing some remarkable contributions to the craft beer legend here. The dark couble alt, Sleighr, is a worthy offering. Beautiful mahogany color, nice enduring lacing, malty without tasting like my mom's drop bisquits. Smoth mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. Makes my day."
"A wonderfully colored beer: dark brown body that's nearly black, but a beautiful shade of crimson glows as light filters through the edges. A bold aroma of crystal malt and that distinct laggery alt smell. Taste is the moderately sweet alt flavor we expect and well balanced with an amped up dose of hops. The beer's only downside is that the hop flavor is a little one-dimensional, leaving a bitter aftertaste that lacks some character. Still, a flavorful beer with voluptuous texture. Great winter drinking when one needs a break from the typical winter stouts and ales."
" Palate is sweet and malty, nutty and slightly chocolatey. Some mild, fruity hops keep it from being an overwhelming malt blast and leave a pleasant bitterness on the finish. Body is full and a bit creamy, a very nice vehicle for the assertive flavors. I'm not sure I've had more than a couple of beers in the double-alt style, but I've sure been enjoying this one all winter long. A nice break from the usual Ninkasi hop bombs."
"Not a bad beer, but it isn't a flavor bomb by any means. There are definitely better winter seasonals out there."
"A little bitter, but overall, a well made beer that's easy to appreciate. Would love to have another bottle of this stuff."
"D- Not bad, but I wouldn't seek it out."
"overall another solid brew sent my way...thanks again bro"
"Another winner from Ninkasi and a nice way to treat yourself on a cold, grey winter night."
"Drinkability: Not a bad drink. There isn't too much to it. Its kind of a let down for how dark and strong of a beer this is. But the alcohol and flavors mix well."
"For a beer that is both as strong and as dark as this I am finding it surprisingly bland."
"'cause this ones for us."
"Taste is a lot of toasted barley (singed, almost burnt), caramelised dry leaves and wood, black pepper. A burnt-pepper bitterness just dominates dark toffee sweetness at finish but backs off before becoming too bitter. Bitterness lingers with some hints of sweet, dark dried fruits and a light winey element. Bitterness is just a touch too assertive at end but it has good character and flavour. Feel is good, solid, not heavy."
"Finally had a chance to open my growler of Sleigh'r which had apparently done 30 days in bourbon casks before I had gotten it. Very, very nice. It had been in the growler aging for about a month on a road trip to Albuquerque. Waiting for the right moment to open tonight in rainy Oregon. It poured with a lovely brown head, with the aroma of bourbon. Great mouth feel lots of maltiness from the bourbon and simple hopping and generous use of Munich and Vienna malts , a true double alt. I'd missed the regular Sleigh'r last year, but still remember the 2008. The added aging in whisky casks made this a truly wonderful surprise. A bit better than my keg of the great 2010."
"Light in the mouth, but fitting for the style. A nice dark take on the alt style."
"D - nice balance, warming but not harsh, and overall pretty tasty. very well suited for the winter months."
"D: It's OK, very inexpensive for the bomber ($3.50) which helps, just wish there was something more to it."
"Not a bad beer, enjoyable, some alcohol present. Have a had few from this brewery, ill reserve judgement till I have a few more. What i've so far i've liked ok."
"Nice beer; not what I expected but very good albeit not real comlex. A bit of an identity crisis on this one. Smokey with coffee tones with food."
"22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. No freshness info. This bottle has been in my fridge for a month or so and I am just now getting to it. Pours a lovely light brown color with an inch of lumpy foam. Good lacing. Sweet malt on the nose with slight roasted notes and an herbal bitter quality. Hints of dark chocolate. Fairly full bodied with a nice, round mouthfeel. Good carbonation. Good drinkability for 7.2abv. The nutty taste of the roasted malt prevails all the way through to the finish. The bitterness that comes from the hops doesn't really complement the rest of the flavor profile. I don't think the style needs this much hop bitterness. They stayed true to the style but I feel like they upped the hops along with the alcohol and the result is too bitter. Not bad though. Something different but nothing great."
"This would be a fantastic beer for someone (for example, the one raving about it sitting next to me.) Just not for me."
"Appearance pours a dark ruby brown with a thick off white head having good lace. Smell has a light roasted malt aroma. Taste of lightly roasted malts having a good balance with the hops ending in a light piney note. Mouthfeel is a heavy medium with good carbonation. Not a big or complex as expected, but still a simple easy drinking Alt ale."
"I'm not sure how to feel about this beer. Initially, this is my first experience with an alt (which I bravely will be brewing in the next few weeks). With a beer this dark I usually expect it to deliver a little more sweetness. It smells delightful, to be sure, but taste is simply roasty. If that is your bag then this beer will be awesome. I think it would be much improved if it had a bit more sweetness to it. Then again that may well just be the style."
"Good mouthfeel, nice carbonation and dry finish. Good drinkability as well."
"Mouthfeel: About a 3/5 thickness but not coating. Feels a lot like a root beer."
"I really like this brew. I would buy it again ... and again ...."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and light for a winter ale."
"Drinkability: this beer has a good feel to it, but I just can't get behind the dry, biscuity malt flavors -- they just don't turn my key. Still, a decently crafted brew."
"Pours a nice crisp herbal, off-brown, cream white head. Interesting balance between malt and hops. It leans towards the sweeter side. This is a very malty, dark, herbed beverage. I feel like I'm drinking an extremely toned down shot of Fernet. The flavors remind me of winter. There's definitely a nice pine malt/hop bitterness to it that seems to be the main theme of this drink. Notes of pine and annis are definitely in your face. I've had a cookie that resembles the flavor of this beer. The mouthfeel is smooth and is easy to drink. The herbal notes are definitely not bad, but I think after one of these bottles, I'm good for a week or two. This is my third bottle in two months. It definitely makes you want drink it again, just not in a hurry. This is definitely one of the more unique holiday beers."
"Pour a dark dark brown color with a small cream colored head. Smells like nutty chocolate with a hint of mint. The taste is strong on chocolate and hops. It seems more like a porter than an altbier. The nutty smell isn't really there on the tongue as would be expected from an altbier while it also has strong carbonation. The mouthfeel is great. It drinks very clean and crisp. The sweet chocolate lingers on the tongue well."
"If you like Malty winter beers this is for you. It is a wonderful departure from the typical over hopped holiday ales. It's simply not overdone making it a joy to have and have and have. Although I usually say away from cold winter brews, I find this one enjoyable served at a typical fridge temp. Buy as much as you can..."
"A pretty good beer overall but doesn't do a whole lot for me"
"All in all, this is a pretty impressive brew. It doesn't really fit the name, nor the label, as it's neither heavy metal nor holiday spiced, but it's one impressively delicious brew that's definitely worth seeking out."
"Really didn't enjoy this one - just not my kind of beer."
"Cheers"
"Smooth, drinkable, malty, but a bit ""flat"" in flavor. Basically a typical brown ale in a nice bottle."
"D- Very drinkable, and tasty."
"D - I just killed a bomber inside of an hour and could easily get started on another one... if I had one."
"Verdict: You can find this beer cheaper under a different name, but all old school Heshers have to drink it out of deference..."
"Overall impression: Perhaps not as smooth as it could be, but pretty tasty."
"Drinkability is quite high. This is another solid beer, from a very nice lineup from Ninkasi. As mentioned before, this beer is a nice example of the ""winter warmer"" style."
"Ninkasi Brewing Company--SLEIGH'R Dark Double Alt Ale--Seasonal Release!--2010. 7.20% ABV. 50 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Alt--Imperial? Lacy lasting big dense tight tan head. Deep dark ruby brown color. No sediment. Light roasted cocoa hint pine hop front. Creamy mild sweet smooth toasty roasty rich mild chocolate spicy big brown ale mildly resinous & chalky body. Mild satisfying smooth end. Sampled 22 oz. bottle purchased for $4.00 10/12/2010 @ Seattle, Fremont PCC on 10/29/2010"
"Overall Impression: Good beer, but nothing that will knock your socks off. Better seasonals out there, but enjoyable nonetheless."
"Fairly interesting flavors although they are a bit subdued as is proper for the style, except this is supposed to be a double. It seems very similar to Full Sail's wassail but I didn't taste it side by side but just had it recently. Easy to drink but not a whole lot to look forward to."
"D: I remembered enjoying it last year, but this one is a bit of a letdown."
"I usually find beers similar to this style usually are a bit tougher for me to drink through, though I found this beer extremely easily drinkable and pleasant. A very nice winter seasonal and one I will look forward to enjoying again."
"Overall - A nice little gem in the winter ale/altbier categories, and with a rad name to boot! If you're looking for a solid, balanced beer that's on the darker side without being quite as bitter/roasted tasting as a porter or stout, you'll enjoy this one."
"22 oz from Fred Meyer. S.Salem. Attractive brown with red accents. Nice looking bubbly tan head Nice malty aromas..caramel,coffee and some nuttiness. Deep malt driven flavours, coffee, dark chocolate WalnutsTouch of spicy hop at the end. LIked the palate on this one..its complex yet highly drinkable. Overall a nice malty beer for the winter. ,"
"This is a delightful fall/winter beer, and my favorite Ninkasi brew to date. Reasonably good buy at $3.59 per bomber (still that's eqivalant to $11.75 per six-pack....which seems real high when I can pick up Jubelale for a $7 per six-pack all winter long)."
"Not a bad beer, but just not really my cup of tea."
"The smooth nose continues on the palate where each component of roasted malts, hops and alcohol blend harmoniously, creating a very enjoyable beer; especially if you happen to sit in front of a fireplace during a cold winter night. It is delicate, yet robust in its composition, successfully creating an alt beer which has gone to the Dark Side."
"D-This is a very drinkable winter seasonal since it has a lot of flavor but is not filling. 7.2% ABV is masked very well. Competitively priced bomber at $3.79 to $3.99 but would be better if available in sixers of 12 oz. bottles."
"Other comments: The ABV is well hidden because the alcohol warmth is pretty understated, hitting you really late and kind of deep in the chest. A nice winter seasonal."
"Of course, it looks like a winter seasonal, we drank it in September, so i dunno if this aged and mellowed or whatnot, because that split bomber is my only insight, so I guess at the very least I can say this beer does just fine aged up to 9 months."
"Mouthfeel is not too thick, but a little sticky. Tasty, drinkable beer."
"Worth checking out."
"This is a 6 month old bottle. Pours a diet coke caramel brown with a small head that remains for awhile. Smell is faint sugar cookie and yeast. Taste is mild and pleasant. Most of the hop bitterness present fresh has disappeared but has left a sweet and refreshing drink. Figs, fruitcake, apricot, brown sugar. The mouthfeel is thin and appropriate for the style. Pretty dry finish. The alcohol is very well hidden. A pleasant beer, ignore the letter rating."
"d - I thought this was a decent beer. Some nice roasted and sweet malts but nothing really jumpoed out about it to me. Would give another shot."
"With the possible exception of Tricerahops Double IPA, everything that I've had from this brewery has been as solid as granite. Sleigh'r is a pretty cool name, but this is a beer that should be available all year round."
"D: Okay, not a favorite of mine, but drinkable nonetheless."
"Drinkability is good, this is a nice malty brown, very well made, satisfying but dangerously smooth."
"The beer pours reddish brown with a white head. The aroma is caramel malt with brown sugar. The flavor is caramel malt, toffee, dark fruits and grassy hops. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A little disappointing overall, but a beer worth trying."
"Great tasty warmer that goes down very well. Good balance with a nice hop rush."
"M/D - Medium bodied and very easy going. The tastes all play together very well."
"Dark brown body, a bit of chill haze, substantial off white head, slow dissipation, an impressive looking beer. The nose is quite malty, a bit more sweet than bready, not much hop presence to speak of. The taste is the same as nose, with a slight smokiness, and some caramel malts, pretty well balanced. The finish is a bit bitter, was wondering when the hops would appear, pretty viscuous. Mouthfeel features significant carbonation. Drinkable yes (though a bit boozy for the style,more of a sipper than a quaffer), memorable no. To be honest, the second best Christmas beer from Eugene I've had this year, after Oakshire's Ill Tempered Gnome."
"overall a pretty good altbier. yum."
"Overall, a better than solid beer that's worth your time."
"D: I'm farther down this beer than I realized between when I started this review and now. It's really delicious."
"Pours a dark amber with mildly off white head. Retention is medium. Malt forward flavor profile with hints of dark fruit and bread plus mild tobacco notes. Bitterness is medium, lingering well into a dry finish. The hop character is very subdued in both aroma and flavor, but is apparent though balanced throughout. A good drinker, but not session material at 7.2%"
"D: Very smooth and drinkable and as stated the abv goes unnoticed and the hops make it refreshingly crisp. Very well done Ninkasi. This is a solid altbier and very representative of the style, just wish it had a little more uniqueness for a winter beer, but can't fault it for style points."
"4.5/4/3.5/3.5/4"
"- This is a great Alt, but I am not overly impressed... it doesn't really stand out, nor does it have anything unique to offer... spices etc..."
"D: easily drinkable! I got this one on draft at the Belmont Station and they served it at the correct temp allowing the flavors to really challenge the palate. Wonderful beer!"
