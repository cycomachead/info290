3.68,3.4,4,3.5,3.75,4,3.5,"Can at Euclid hall. Pours red colored with a one finger white to off white head. Aroma is floral with some nice fruits coming through. Flavor follows this closely with a crisp hop finish it seems, very floral notes, and some fruits galore going on here. Light bodied and goes down very easy. Not really in the Altbier traditional style, but a pretty decent beer bordering on the session ale side.","BMMillsy","Jul 03, 2014"

Flavor was more of the same and almost made me think of wet dog. I really didn't much care for this beer and would not order one again.","ArrogantB","May 19, 2014"

3,-15.7,2.5,2.5,3.25,3.5,3,"Have an inkling I got a bad bottle. Absolutely no foam on the pour, couldn't get a decent aroma for the life of me. Still mildly effervescent on the tongue, but also a metallic aftertaste that I'm pretty sure was not intentional. Other than that a bit grainy, pours a deep translucent amber that's quite fetching. But a bit of a bad deal overall. That's what I get for buying sale beers.","QueerBeer","May 08, 2014"

4.23,18.8,4.25,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,"O â€“ Very nice offering here. This is typically not a style of beer that I enjoy. This one is an easy drinker and remarkably balanced. The mild hop notes can unfortunately have a tendency to fade with age on this one, the malt notes are still there of course, but it does come across a bit sweeter. Still, great offering here from Grimm, nicely done.","Moose90","Dec 08, 2013"

3.75,5.3,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"A rather pleasant Alt, the malt kept tight to the chest, while the fruit and hops put their heads down and do their background jobs.

3.53,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours a clear orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, honey, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with a caramel flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some solid aromas and flavors.","UCLABrewN84","May 06, 2013"

Overall, not necessarily a bad beer but not one I was a huge fan of. I am not very familiar with the style, alt bier, but I'd personally grab an Alaskan Amber over this.","denver10","Aug 19, 2012"

3.53,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"on tap upstairs at wyknoop brewery. i am shocked to hear this won a gold at the GABF. not because its a bad beer, but because it doesnt stant out at all as something special to me. poured a clear redish caramel color with a frothy off white head. smells of amber malts, caramel, and a bit of dried fruit. flavor is a bit watered down, malt forward, and bland. i dont know, just not a lot here to get excited about. its good, but is it a gold medal worthy beverage? i would have to answer no, but then again im not a professional beer judge (hey, where do you sign up for that anyway?!). feel is fine, medium to light body, mild carbonation, weird aftertaste. decent drink but not a champion in my book.","StonedTrippin","Apr 10, 2012"
2.94,-17.4,4,2.5,3,3,3,"O-This is ok. It is sorta what i expected. For a crisp lager it has a decent amount of flavor, but the off-flavor is a little distracting. Not sure what to think.","znichols","Apr 01, 2012"
4.37,22.8,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Had this on tap at the brewery. After tasting several Alt's of german origin this one fit very well with some of the best i've had from germany. It uses a touch of american hops to it so its drinkable to the hop heads on this side of the pond. It was a hot day and this seemed to really go down smooth. Although not a radical beer its very drinkable and would be one I would drink more than one pint in a sitting.","Osprey77","Dec 22, 2011"
3.67,3.1,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"A decent altbier. Nothing to go out of the way for. A nice amber color verging on a cherry red. After their porter this seemed bland and so light. Don't know much else to say except I didn't write notes and it tasted similar to an Alaskan Alt. I wouldn't go out of my way for this one or spend too much but I would for the porter.","claytong","Mar 22, 2011"
