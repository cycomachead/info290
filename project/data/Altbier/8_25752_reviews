"not bad, but really not special at all. generic, even for these guys, who usually do pretty well with flavor in conventional styles. this one is a bit watered down for me, not a whole lot of the rich caramel german malt i like in the style, and its not lagered, yet i think it has a pretty similar grain base to the marzen beers of the season. usually i would be all for that, but it just has not much flavor, and it finishes with a strange metallic tang that obviously doesnt belong. i do get a hint of citrus there, and then the bittering hops on top of the grain, but the whole thing is just too light for my tastes, especially this time of year. carbonation is on point, but it has no body and that hurts it for me. the ale yeast adds nothing, and im left pretty underwhelmed on the whole."

"From 12 oz bottle, this has got to be the brightest beer I have ever seen.  Pours a brilliant orange, very clear, nice layer of foam and light lacing.  Nose of caramel, bread, and light floral hops.  Flavors follow the nose with sweet caramel malts tot he front and sides with a nice light floral hop flavor on the back.  Okto finishes clean and crisp.  Highly recommended for a session, and great for fans of autumn and fest lagers and alts.  Very nice.  Cheers."

"Pours a very light orange with a quickly dissolving creamy head.  Aroma of fruit and bread.  First taste is of caramel, moderate malty backbone.  No discernible hop presence.  Very thin mouthfeel.  Very sweet overall character.  Smooth drinking and average for the style."

"Amber in color with excellent clarity.  A fingernail of khaki colored foam is on top.  Light Brussels lacing.  Aroma of gentle amber malt is present.  The flavor is packed with gentle notes of amber malt and a touch of caramel.  The mouth is fairly light,but with a bit of depth and smoothness."

"O- a nice malty & easy drinking brew for the fall that has some nice floral notes to boot"
""

"Pours a deep clear amber. The fizzy white head burns away quickly. The aroma is nonexistent and the taste follows closely. Only the faintest malt tones exist. Body has a decent weight and just a tinge of carbonation. We'll crafted except for the total lack of flavor."
""
"Overall (3.93) : This is why we drink beer. To taste the good varieties and interesting beers that celebrate special times of the year, and to relax in our work. This Oktoberfest is another great example of a beer you can enjoy and savor the flavors of autumn. A good choice for the style."

"Initially surprised by the ale in a lager dominated specialty.  Nice color and great mouth feel but after that it fads.  I'll stick to lagers for Octoberfest."

"I enjoyed this one quite a lot.. Easy to drink and inoffensive as they come, everyone should give this one a go."

"Horrible stuff - I realize this is an older bottle but it should have held up better than this. Alas, I'm reviewing this because I feel that even in its freshest stages does it retain these off flavors throughout. Am I crazy, or did I get a bad bottle or something? Not anything I'd want to revist again - and I could definitely say the same for most of Widmer's beers at this point."
""
""
""
"More caramel and fruits than expected: Not really a classic altbier, but still an OK beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a good value at about 7.50 a sixer, despite the fact that it wasn't as fresh as it could be."
""
"Overall: Pretty good American version of an Oktober fest beer, and a little surprising coming from Widmer Bros., who’s beers tend to be much hoppier than this, too hoppy for my taste. This one is very well balanced and tasty."
"O: I was looking for a seasonal brew to get me pumped for Halloween, something better than the tried and true Sam Adam's Seasonal fare, this was not the beer I was looking for. Maybe I can hand it out with the candy this coming Thursday...to the parents."

"Pours a pretty burnt orange in color with a 1-finger off white head that hangs around for a while. Good lacing was seen with each sip. The aroma is of some caramel, spice and hops. Very nice! The taste was the same and much better than other ""Oktober"" brews I have tried. Very smooth actually and went down easy."
"The malts are certainly the focal point in this one, with the hops doing a good job of adding some complimentary notes in the finish. A well done example of a tasty, malt-forward beer."
""
""
"Booze this beer! It's killer! Good color Great Taste and awesome buzz..LOL..seriously though This is a impressive Oktoberfest Beer In the mix of contenders and pretender's...This beer stands out I was impressed CONTENDER!!! Walk on home boy!!! RESPECT!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"S: Caramel, malt, chocolate, delicate hop aroma."
""
""
"O: Decent. An easy drinker, non-offensive, and generally hits the right notes for the style."
""
""
""
"I really wanted to like this beer, but to be truthful, it falls way short of my expectations. An Oktoberfest beer (for my taste) should be very malty and spicy/toffee flavored. This beer was just....bland. If I had made this one myself, I definitely would not be very proud of it. Not a bad beer, but not great - I wouldn't bring it to a friend's home to share, which is my baseline for a great beer. This is not the first time I have been disappointed in a Widmer Brothers product - most likely will not buy anything from this house again. If you are a WB fan, I don't wish to offend you, as it is probably just my palate, not their product."
""
""
"Not a bad beer and easy to drink, but lacks the rich toffee flavors distinct for the style, and the citrusy aspect is a little weird. It's pretty to look at though."
""
"Overall it's alright, no complaints but seems a bit lacking."
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a bright, copper-orange coloring with a slow flow of carbonation in the body and a filmy, light, fluffy white head on top. Aromas of toasted grain, cinnamon and nutmeg spices, and subtle caramel sweetness give a true harvest feel to the aromas. Rich and pleasant nose. Flavors are roasted and sweet on the forward tongue, with a sugary undertone that detracts from the overall balance of the beer. Roasted caramel notes hit a tangy level, while the spices present on the nose seem to all but disappear on the palate. Light, slighty frothy body from the carbonation, but even that can't help clear the cloying, sugary linger that bleeds all the way through to the slick finish. This one started great for me, but then seemed to spiral out of control from there."
"O: Well-balanced and drinkable beer. My last review of Widmer Bros. was an unexpected disappointment but they have redeemed themselves, which I knew they would. This beer shows how versatile they can be as most of what I have tried from Widmer Bros. has been hoppy ales. This has a nice delicate hop in the background that accents this beer nicely."
" The flavor is malty up front with some light toasted and caramel flavor with a gentle yeast element which gives way to some light herbal and slightly spicey hop flavors which continue into the finish with a subtle dry quality but no alcohol is apparent in the taste. I like a good Alt and this fits with a bit more hops than the German counterpart perhaps, but the flavor is clean and it is a drinkable example of the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Just 'OK' flavor-wise and mediocre in other categories, too. Pretty easy to drink, however, if you're craving an ale of the style and on the 'light' side."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste was more bitter than the aroma led me to believe it would be. Some mildly sweet malts up front but slight lingering note at the end."
""
""
""
"Overall a tasty fall brew. Brewed on date Aug.12, 2013. About one month old."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I think this beer might suffer from not quite meeting octoberfest standards and not quite having anything distinctive about it (balanced). As such, I would guess most raters are going to put this dead in the middle, no high ratings, no low ratings, lots of average ones."
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather crisp and enjoyable brew overall with a nice blend of roasted flavors, light sweeter flavors, and spice flavors which overall create an easy drinker."
"Overall: A decent beer that could use greater hop inclusion or some other flavors to make it more interesting."

"The Verdict: Not bad. A solid German Altbier with good malt backbone and enough caramel and hops to keep it interesting. Some Octoberfest brews are overpowering with spice to me, but this one is just about right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – I don’t hate this beer one bit, but I certainly do not love it. It is just so-so. I wouldn’t recommend you run out and buy it when it’s being made but I might want to try a fresh one of these one day to see if the added IBU brings something else to the table. Overall, a good beer for sure, but not outstanding."
""
""
""
"Overall: Not a bad ""Oktoberfest," although it definitely tastes more like an altbier. Pretty unoffensive but mostly forgettable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Toasted malts and spicy bitterness give way to cookie dough malt semi-sweetness. Fruity edge to it. Finish is more vegetal with some spicy, grassy hops. Lingering caramel and carrots. Moderate body with a slick, smooth feel. Nice."
""
""
""
""
"O - If I were Widmer, I'd look to develop a different strain of yeast for this beer. It's fairly good, but stops short of great. A little more tinkering and this could be a better beverage."
"An ok beer but with so many great fall seasonals on the shelf, this one will get passed over in the future."
""
""
""
""
""
"A pretty light Oktoberfest style makes this a very easy beer to put down, but all the time wishing it had more to it."
""
""
"Decent beer overall. A couple flavors I found a little off, but overall it was still enjoyable and very drinkable."
""
""
""
"Overall, my favorite Oktoberfest bier of 2012. It's just exactly as I like them."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: it's a bit unorthodox, but I like the idea of a citrusy altbier."
""
"O: A delightful beer to drink. It goes down easy but is still substantial."
""
"Another middle of the pack beer in my book - good enough that I'd go for more, but not enought that I'd seek it out again."
"Definitely the Altbier that they have talked about the past, some minor tweaks over the years and ends up being a solid brew. A good pick for a fall seasonal, happy to see this one back."
"Nothing mind blowing, but a really solid example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"Not a huge fan of the Widmer Weissbiers, but I must say that this seasonal isn't too bad.... As you fill a pint glass, a beautiful reddish/copper beer appears with a nice inch head that leaves a decent amount of trails as you drink it.... The smell is that of toffee, caramel, and a bit of toast.... The taste is also toasty with caramel notes, and slightly hoppy and nutty.... It has an average to full body that leaves a pleasant aftertaste.... Overall, a pretty good brew."
""
"O- This is a good beer. Nothing flashy or surprising, but well rounded with no glaring flaws."
"The flavor is malt-forward, with toasted grain/bread and light caramel. It has mild bitterness and some estery fruit. Hop flavor is noticeable but takes a back seat; floral. Body is medium and somewhat sweet on finish, despite balancing bitterness that gains prominence as the beer approaches room temperature. I would probably pick it out as an amber ale if I weren't told anything about it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a decent beer, but it lacks the malt complexity that is typical for the style. The caramel notes are too light, and melanoidin flavors are absent."
"O: A solid Oktoberfest offering. Nothing stands out as spectacular but has a nice overall character. It definitely leans toward the sweet side but has just enough bitterness for balance which makes it interesting."
"what can i say i dont normally buy widmer but i like the color of the bottle wow very nice beer with a little hop to it but that ok all i can say it s a good tasting beer for a octerber fest so if your looking a beer that crisp with a hop this is a beer for , good color good taste little hop enjoy"
"Pours a copper body with one inch of foam with decent retention. The aromas are reminscent of bread crust and baked biscuits. The front palate has a light earthy hoppiness, with breadier, more biscuity flavors dominating the middle. Medium to full bodied, finishes crisp. This is my first Oktoberfest of 2012, and I like it a lot."
"O: quite good, I am a fan of alts in general. I do not regret this 6 pack at all!"
""
"Overall not a bad beer. Probably won't buy again though."
""
"Looks like a fall beer, vibrant copper with a thin head of foam that drops some lace. Thick, steely caramel with warm toasted bread maltiness. Hops are clean and herbal. Balance is about even. Clean fermentation profile, lager-like even if it is technically an ale. Nothing spectacular, but another solid beer to have in the cooler during football season."

"Surprising found this at Chameleon's in Mount Vernon, IA. ""Pours a clear amber with a thin white head that disappears immediately. Smell of sweet malts, with just a hint of hops. A little watered down. Taste has malt, caramel, and some hops with just a tad of bitterness. I would say this would be a very average Octoberfest; nothing stands out."
""
""
""
""
"D: Looks the part & smells alright. A bit light on malts, and heavy on the hops. But hey, they are west coast brewers. And the hops do taste German. Okay for an O’fest / fall ale."
""

"Malty and nutty. Frankly, a little more complex that what I'm looking for in an Octoberfest. Can you truly call it an Octoberfest? Probably, this brewery has been at it for a while. The nuttiness is the most agressive characteristic. It's not a filbert taste, but similair. Over all, a great beer for the days just before the snao begins to fall. But I'd grab a 22 oz.er of something else to clear your pallet in between three packs."
"Light-bodied with good carbonation. Goes down quite easy. Not a favorite of mine, but worth a try overall."
"O: not bad."
"An interesting take on an Oktoberfest beer, as it's an altbier rather than a typical marzen. Poured a coppery orange with a creamy white head that left a nice bit of lacing. Caramel malts on the nose, light fruity tones, and some leafy hops. Similar taste: sweet malts, light indistinct fruits, and subdued hops make for a light, not overly flavorful or interesting, but well-balanced drink. Not quite medium-bodied. Sessionable."
"D: Flavorful but too sweet for the style, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, whether it’s a true O-fest or not there are better alternatives that are similar."
"Mouthfeel is medium-light, average carbonation. The lack of taste and feel makes this go down so easiliy. Overall, a pretty boring beer. Not interesting or enticing at all, just something that goes down easy."
"O: Wonderful looking ale and the mouthfeel was solid. I think the nose and flavor was a bit off though. I liked the Sudwerk slightly better."
"O: Honestly, I think I'd rather have a Bud."
"The feel of this beer is smooth with a nice drinkable feel that goes down easy and is pretty refreshing."
"Overall: This Oktoberfest really got me excited. From the first sniff when I got that rush of malt and fruit, i knew there was a great deal of balance ahead of me. This beer has a great deal of toastiness that makes this great New England fall weather seem somehow MORE like fall. I will be seeing this bottle again real soon!"
"Pours an amber ale with a decent amount of cream colored head with nice lacing. Lotsa bubbles being produced from the bottom. Getting the caramel in the aroma with some butterscotch and light apple and some distant chocolate whiffs. The taste is malty with a slight hoppy bite on the swallow. Slightly yeasty and bready but not bad. Kinda nutty aftertaste as well. Overall I enjoyed this session. Overall I liked the nice blend of the malt and hops and the lower alcohol is welcomed. A solid showing from the Widmer Bros."
"D: Not high on my list, this beer just isn't that good."
"Half finger very light tan head, quick dissipation resulting in thin broken layer on top of medium amber clear body, numerous streams of uprising small bubbles. Malt forward nose, mostly caramel with some biscuit, floral hops, not much else. Taste mirrors nose, more caramel than biscuit, floral finish. Mouthfeel on the light side of medium, not a lot of effervescence. IMHO they'd have been better off just doing a seasonal bottling of the classic Alt, one of Fred's favorite beers and a historically important microbrew than this, which lacked both depth and character, though fairly sessionable."
"Overall-Nice flavors, low ABV packs some nice, drinkable punch. I liked it."
"I cannot get over the taste.... but it smells so good."
"It reminds me of a Jolly Rancher, except it doesn't have that cheap, artificial taste that I dislike. The label has also been improved."
"O: Meh. I don't get the craze on these beers (Ambers/Octos/Marzens/Altbiers), I really don't. This beer is more of the same; hefty caramel malt bill, generous sweetness, maybe some nutty/wood-like attributes, light hops that add little beside aromatics and a touch of bitterness."
"Overall: Hard to come up with comments for this one, it's a pretty flat beer in general. It has all the good makings of an Oktoberfest, but all of the flavors need to be more pronounced. Bigger flavor. There just isn't much there."
"O - Overall, it's a nice seasonal offering, and basically comes off as an ale version of a Marzen/Oktoberfest. Nice twist on the style, and something I can see myself coming back to on occasion. Good session beer for the fall."
"Pours an autumny copper with minimal foam. Little lacibng. Malty smell, sweet - caramel like. Sweet caramel taste, smooth with light carbonation. Very drinkable. Mild mild hop at the finish, only noticeable seconds later. Almost too easy to drink. Nice Octo."
"D: Overall a very sessionable beer with a nice mix of everything and a good take on the oktoberfest style."
"O: If you like a sweeter, caramelized beer you'll like this option. Those liking anything with hops or a bit of a bite should avoid. I think it's an interesting beer and didn't expect as much caramel, but enjoyed this beer overall."
"A nice-looking, clear amber color with foamy, tan head and decent lacing. Bready caramel aroma with some floral hoppiness. The flavor is brimming with caramel sweetness and nutty malts. Medium body with a rich, creamy mouthfeel; this one is definitely on the sweet side. A good food-pairing beer."
"Not a bad beer by any means, but not one I'll seek out either."
"O - I think I really like the dry/leafy/sorta bitter like finish on this beer. I haven't experienced that in a beer in a while. Overall flavors are simple, quaffable, and tasty. I'd love to crack a few of these in a sitting, especially with some sort of munchies. I'm a little turned off that it's brewed under the style of an Altbier and sold as an Oktoberfest but I say definitely give this one a try."
"o: Decent."
"A tasty autumnal ale based on the alt style. Lots of rounded malty notes that work well with the fullish mouthfeel. Very drinkable and well balanced this is a beer to enjoy with food and the cooling nights of Fall. Based upon the orginal Alt recipe that was Widmers first beer"
"D- This one is an easy drinking beer with nothing overly exciting. It is a solid beer and the best I've had from Widmer so far."
"But the taste, you ask? It's sweet, with the caramel malts up front alongside hints of a nutty, even almost roasty character. Very well-done, and an enjoyable brew."
"O: I thought this actually smelled pretty nice, but the flavor was not all that enjoyable."
"D- Not a typical Oktoberfest. I'd agree with the altbier classification. Worth a try, very interesting flavor."
"Pours a clear dark amber with a 1 inch light tan head that fades to an oily cap on the top of the beer. Thin broken rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of grains and some slight caramel notes. Really a very subdued smell on this one. Taste is of malt/grain, caramel, and some citrus zest. A slightly bitter taste lingers on the palate after each sip. A pretty good level of carbonation with a crisp yet smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer from Widmer but nothing that special."
"Very easy to drink, just as, if not more comfortable to drink in summer as opposed to the fall when you might want something of greater substance."
"Didn't realize this was supposed to be an Alt until I entered this review. Why brew an Alt and call it an Octoberfest?!?"
"Great oktoberfest/altbier for the autumn/winter. Fits very well for this type of seasonal beer. Will be returning to this one in the future."
"overall, this was a very nice brew that I would buy again"
"Not too shabby of a brew. Doesn't present anything great, but all around is pretty good. Drinks pretty easily, but can't say this stands up with the better beers in the category."
"This is fairly smooth and light, even for an O-fest which is clearly a beer made for consumption. Maltier than bitter, sweeter than toasted. Herb notes poke in toward the finish. Light body, hard to begrudge the style. (Although, it's listed as an altbier here. At which point, the mouthfeel is unacceptably pathetic and the malts not up to the task.) As an Oktoberfest, in the month of October, Okto does a fine job."
"A solid drinkable beer that's versitile for most situations, including lunch with a gigantic BBQ beef sandwich and a tremondous helping of curly fries."
"Not bad; going in the right direction. Poured with a medium sized very light tan head that is somewhat persistant and some lace. Color is a clear orange amber with lots of little bubble trails. Aroma is malt, fresh beer, and a bit of fruit. Flavor is much like the nose plus some caramel and a little on the dry side. Body is good; ditto carbonation. Finish is like flavor and somewhat short in length."
"definitely not an oktoberfest, but inspired and influenced by the style into a sort of alt. recommended and worth a six pack or so every fall."
"I am a sucker for Widmer espcially a tasty season."
"Taste is caramelly toast, gentle light fruits, light leafy-peppery bitterness just dominated by the creamy-caramelly light sweetness."
"Verdict: probably worth the price, but you get what you pay for."
"Drinkability - Aftertaste is a little much for me, but not too bad. Good brew in general, but not terribly complex. Smooth enough to make it worth coming back for though."
"Overall: A good drinking beer to be enjoyed in large quantities with friends. Classic Widmer"
"Pours a copper/amber color with a 1/2"" white head that leaves a little bit of lacing in the glass. Smells of a bready malt, there is a little bit of sweetness in there too. It looked like a marzen when I poured it, but I really noticed it wasn't when I took my first sip. Taste is of a sweet malt, finish is just a little bitter. Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation. Overall, it was a good beer, but I am not that into Altbier and there are other beers I would rather have when it comes to Oktoberfest brews."
"The smell was biscuity with a soft fruitiness to it. The taste was a medium body with a crispness to it. It had a component of the biscuit like malt that stuck on the tongue. It stays in the mouth for some time as a pleasant after tone. Overall I was pretty impressed by the brew."
"Picked one of these up last week as part of a mixed six pack. Expectations were not high, and this beer did not fail to live down to them. Pours a dark amber color, with a good inch or so of tan foam. Aromas of caramel, sweet malt and not much more. Similar on the palate, somewhat hoppy with a long, bitter finish."
"Overall not a bad beer but not particularly good just kind of bland. There are far better Oktoberfest beers out there."
"5th beer in my Oktoberfestbinge-- it is the best tasting one. But it is also disqualified for being an Alt... Come on! I know lagers can do better than this... whats wrong?!?!"
"I love Widmer beers, but this one is not getting allot of love from me. Taste is somhwat bland, aroma is not pleasant and it just doesnt have the flavors that it should in my opinion. Although with an ale yeast that could be one of the factors, but even still it is not somthing I'll return to."
"Widmer Brothers Brewing Company, Ltd.--OKTO Oktoberfest Munich Style Ale--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 5.50% ABV. 25 IBU's. (4.0 / 5.0) Amber Ale. Mild lace thin fizzy off white head. Pretty bright rich ruby amber color. Lightly toasted malt mild hop fruit hint front. Delicate sweet doughy biscuit toasted caramel black cherry malt rich refreshing body. Clean smooth tasty mild hop lingering Fest end. Sampled 8/17/2010. Sampled three bottles. 6 - Pack $7.99."
"Widmer Brothers releases some pretty impressive beer on occasion. Most notably, Drifter Pale Ale and Brrr. Okto isn't quite that good, but my opinion might be colored by the fact that I don't like Oktoberfests as much as APAs and winter warmers. Worth a single and maybe even a sixer."
"Bought this on the Oktoberfest spree with no preconceptions of what it would be. Not bad but I can do without the hops in this style. I know it says Altbier but is more of a weird O."
"D: Flavorful, smooth and fairly balanced - probably more so than many of the Alts from US craft brewers."
"Poured a deep, deep orange body with good carbonation and a small white head. Nose is caramel sweetness with some fresh bread around the edges. Taste starts with a layer of malt,and a slight hop twang at the end. Very clean, definitely German as opposed to American, but not very interesting."
"I love Widmer Brewery and I love Oktoberfest beers. And Widmer being a German-style brewer, you'd think they'd do a bang-up job with their Oktoberfest, eh? Alas, no. This is a big, round, strong, heavy beer. Like a Northwest ale without the hops. Completely misses the flavor and body of an Oktoberfest. Just kind of the blimp of beers. Pass."
"D-Enjoyable beer...definitely more of an alt than an ofest."
"This beer pours a clear red color with a small white head that recedes slowly into sparse lacing. The aroma is dominated by a sugary sweetness covering up anything else. The taste is still sweet, but it is a malty sweetness that lets some floral hops come though. Still it is overly simple. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is an okay beer. I could drink it again, but I can't see what situation would drive me too."
"D-Only average. My third try from this brewery's offering. Doubt I will try much else, at least not that I am willing to pay for since there is much yet to try from other brewers and much I like better from competitors."
"- Super drinkable, and as good as I remembered from the last one I had about 4 years ago... been looking forward to it again this year... a must have."
"Pours an amber brown, body somewhat opaque. Big creamy light tan head. Good lacing. Grape juice aroma, some maltiness. Somewhat malty taste, almost sour aftertaste. Some grapey foretaste. Some balance, but more on the malty side. Pretty good session beer."
"Overall: A slight carbonated mouth feel with a medium body. The finish is slightly sweet and bitter that last for a few moments. There is a nice balance in the malt with a decent amount of hops. It not too bad, there is rich caramel sweetness in the beer. I think that it is a malt bomb and rather sweet."
"Update 12/8/08: After e-mailing Widmer bros., Okto is made using an alt yeast and then lagered."
"D: Nice session beer."
"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass longneck bottle, with a pop off crown. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Mouthfeel is slightly astringent, but the malts cling to the palate well and overall this is a decent Oktoberfest. It's more malty than a lot of others, which I like. There are better Oktoberfests out there for sure, but this is a solid offering."
"Not a bad marzen and is pretty good by Widmer standards. Might not buy a whole sixer of this, as there are plenty of better Oktoberfests out there, but I certainly wouldnt be pissed if someone handed me one of these to quaff."
"Prost"
"The aroma is oddly dusty, not pleasant at all. Luckily the aroma has no hint of this while it also has very smooth caramel malts. This actually reminds me of Negro Modelo, but not quite as nice. I'd say that considering how drinkable and tasty so many other O-fests (and ambers) are, this beer is easily avoidable."
"3.5/4/4/3.5/3.5"
"Cloudy copper pour with a nice and big off white head. Smell is somewhat light, but nicely of caramel and toffee scented malt. Somewhat light on the palate, yet not watery. Nice body, nice biscuity, toffee malty flavor. Nice, easy drinking , yet nicely flavored beer. More Oktoberfest like than amber, in my opinion, but nice either way."
"D- nice take on a marzen, enjoyable and sessionable"
"Overall, not exceptional. I'd also rate this higher were they to call it something other than an Oktoberfest."
"Drinkability: I'm not a huge fan of IPA's...and that's what this beer reminds me of"
"Appearance has a golden amber color with a dissapating thin head. Smell and taste of sweet malt, spice and biscuity with a good amount of carbonation making for a crisp fall beer. Mouthfeel is medium with good body. Overall not to bad, has a slight metallic bitter aftertaste that I could do without though."
"Poured from a 12-oz bottle. Deep amber/copperish colored, not much head, but the carbonation keeps a steady but thin film of bubbles on the surface. Wonderful, sweet toasted malty aroma! No hop aroma. Flavor is a sweet toasted malt with a caramel note or two. No hop flavor. This is a wonderful beer!"
" This beer is a crowd pleaser. If you can pick some up."
"Zum what???"
"Nothing earth-shattering...but very drinkable."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Not overly impressive, but certainly not offensive. Worth a try."
"Drinkability is moderate, the taste was just a bit off so that I wouldn't want to drink to many of them."
"D: A below average Oktoberfest in my opinion, they probably should have stuck to making a lager instead of spinning this into an ale. I'll finish the 6-pack with no problem, it wasn't that bad, but I won't be buying this again."
"Easy drinking, but unexciting. Not a very good oktoberfest."
"Worth a shot!"
"Pours a pretty orange-amber hue, topped by a half-inch of creamy white head that subsides rather quickly. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, light fruity hops, and just the slightest hint of molasses. Palate is a nice blend of sweet caramel malt and light noble hops. A subtle smoky character rounds this one out into a smooth, easy-drinking beer. It certainly sufficed at Widmer's Oktoberfest party this year, and comes through nicely in the bottle as well."
"The beer is sweet and fruity up front; both hops and malt contribute to this perception. I get notes of raisins, cherries and sweet tangelos. There is an almost cough-syrup type fruitiness here; a hint of that fake fruity cherry note that is often a component of cough-syrup. A solid bitterness runs throughout, along with a sharp pine and menthol note, it tries to balance the sweet & fruity notes. This definitely strikes me at times as a good example of an Alt. It has a nice maltiness to it, mostly caramelized but a light, almost roasty note is here in the finish as well. And the fruitiness is certainly characteristic of many a traditional German Alt. The body has a certain heft to it and this beer does have a lingering mouth coating character to it that is quite nice. A pretty tasty beer and if it was not for that fake fruity note I would say it is down right good."
"Just a quickie review because, frankly, there wasn't too much special about this beer. A nice tasting offering for the season, but trumped by the plethora of other festival and autumn ales available."
"This is a drinkable beer, and representative of the style, but I think it lacks character. It could be more full flavored. I'll be looking for a better Octoberfest Ale this year, and I'm sure I'll find one."
"D: I was somewhat disapointed with this beer. Had it last year and I thought it was pretty good actually. Don't think I'd drink this again"
"Tannish orange color, slight haze. Faint crust of head yields to a weak ring in a moment. The appearance is dull and flat. Faint macro-like aroma with only the slightest hint of caramel malt. Nutty and dry in taste, lightly roasty with a tame bitter finish. Hint of leafy hop flavor. Light body, but not watery at least. Average carbonation. The drinkablility is average, no off flavors to speak of. I would label it ""approachable"" at best..."
"Drinkability  I thought this was way off-style to be a good beer, and on its own merits wasnt that much better."
"drinkability: certainly drinkable, but with the abundance of quality seasonal ales out there this time of year, why settle?"
"Could drink this all the time, yum"
"I was excited when I first picked this brew out to buy, but found it dissapointing. As an amber ale it is still dissapointing, and doubly so as it is not a real oktoberfest. I would go with something else before returning to this one."
"As rich and sweet as this is for a beer, one or two would do it for me. I've got so many better rarer beers in the fridge, it'll be a while before I drink this again probably. But, it's a solid daily-drinker for when I get my stash drank down a bit."
"Not too bad, though."
"The taste almost reminded me of cinnamon but that would have been a welcomed note at this point. I'm not the biggest fan of the style but this is one that I'm sure that I won't try again."
"It says Octoberfest, then says ale, what is it really? To me it tastes like a Vienna lager, and not a bad one at that. Deep amber body was topped by a thin tan head that left delicate lacing. Faint malty aroma was evident. Very smooth practically all malt taste, just a touch of hop, some roasted character as well. Refreshing and drinkable."
"Drinkability. I had a second one, but then a few sips into it, I wish I had decided on something else. Not much to hold my interest with Widmer Brothers Okto."
"Pretty mild drinker, not nearly as much body and complexity as other Octoberfests I've tried. Not a bad beer, but I could see how this could be easily classified as an amber ale."
"Amber color with no head to speak of. Carmel smell. Very mellow avg. beer. Sweet malty flavors dominate with a hint of bitter in the end."
"As for taste, my impulse to tag this an English bitter was not far off the mark though the bittering is derived from noble hops and their American hybrids. Okto reminded me a lot of Bridgeports Ropewalk only slightly lighter in the body. My pint showed flayed lace and offered a distant, non-descript aroma. Its a clean and casual beer with a flat bitter finish, but not an Oktoberfest lager by a long shot."
"Overall impression: A bit lighter than some other Oktoberfests, but definitely an enjoyable fall brew."
"This is ok, but nothing spectacular. I agree with others who have noted an unwelcome similarity to Drop Top, albeit with a little more character."
"Ill finish the sixer, because its there, and Id drink one if someone gave me, but I won't be buying it again."
"Pours an inviting amber with a good sized head for a lager. Moderatly carbonated. Smell is of malt and grains. No hint of the sulfur common in poorly aged lagers. Beer taste is watery maltiness with an aftertaste of floral noble hops. Bitterness is balanced, this is an easy drinking beer. A reasonably acceptable example of the Marzen."
"Too early for Oktoberfest? Considering it's been 100 f'ing degrees the last 5 days here in Portland, I'd bloody well say so. That's not going to stop me, however, from diving into the first of the upcoming seasonals. Indeed, Marzen-Oktoberfest is one of my favorite styles. Widmer's example is respectably authentic, but it seems a bit dumbed down from last year, which I remember enjoying thoroughly. This year is a bit closer to Drop Top territory, not a good place to be, in my mind. Pours a handsome if predictable copper amber, with pretty good lager head and retention, although not as creamy as the best of the Germans. Excellent, if subtle, aroma of brown sugar, red apple skin, and spicy roasted meat. The flavor itself is a disappointment; caramelized malts with little depth or complexity. Again, just a shout away from crappy ol' Drop Top. The hops are present, but provide little of the intrigue that is necessary for a successful example of the style, and none of the spiciness promised in the aroma. The beer stretches out a bit upon warming up, but again, you need a spicy hop element to make the transition from a standard blase amber lager to a truly complex, wonderful Fest bier. That said, this beer is cleanly flavorful with no off elements, and it should pair very well with food, especially roast chicken; pork will work too. Mouthfeel is all right, can't hold a candle to the best German lagers but that is hardly surprising; almost no American lagers can. Drinkability fine as well. It will probably not be a surprise to those only familiar with their Hefeweizen that Widmer falls short of the mark here, but as someone who's visited their brewpub (Gasthaus) and was wowed by their triumphant Muscat Love at this year's Oregon Brew Fest, I was hoping for much more."
"Pours a golden dark orange/yellow with a little white inch thick head that falls flat. Lacing is horrible, nothing to speak of. The smell is of grain, slight lime hints, very grainy, clean otherwise. Taste is lacing definition, the grain, wheat is detectible, malt is of watered down sugar, no hop content to speak of, medium bodied but doesn't offer that pizazz. Won't drink again."
"Side note: My wife had the drop top amber, and side by side, the two were remarkably similar. Oddly enough, the Oktoberfest had a much more robust malt body."
"A good way to welcome the newly found crispness in the air here in the NorthWest."
"another pretty looking beer from Widmer..that turned out to be all cover and no book inside..boring."
"The pour a pleasant lipid amber to copper color, the head is modest, frothy and the lace decent enough to cover up the glass. The aroma of malt is the dominant, sweet, as is the malt-laden start. Top is skinny in its feel, the beer finishes with a delightful hop spicy bite, and is moderately carbonated the long lasting aftertaste dry a desert bone."
"Orange body topped by a fizzy, rapidly decaying white head, which almost instantly breaks down into an ""oil skid"". Nose is caramel sweetness with some fresh bread around the edges. Taste starts with a layer of malt,and a slight hop twang at the end. Very clean, definitely German as opposed to American, but not very interesting. There is none of the deeper, chocolate-like notes with classic marzens. An ok amber, and that is what it is sub-headed as, but I expected more from this brewery, and I feel prior years had more substance."
"The finish is a tad abrupt, with the hops pulling the rug out from under the sweetness. Still, one drink follows another. Glad to be home."
"2002 release. Beautiful amber, pours a nice head but it doesn't retain well. Characteristic märzen bready/grainy malt aroma, but with more hop character than some others. Very tasty, grainy sweet malt mingles with slight hop bitterness for a crisp, refreshing bite. Slightly spicy and tingly mouthfeel. Not as much sour breadiness as others in this style. Overall it's very tasty and would be a wonderful session beer, as a märzen should be."
