"This rusty brew is intense and imposing, with organoleptics of toffee, butter, caramel and yeast layered around a minty pine-y center. Some citric hints sneak through on the tongue, to unfortunate effects as it clashes with the darker flavors. Furthermore the palate is flabby and coarse  with a premature finish. Extremely unfocused with some questionable choices made regarding the hops."

"O: I expected a bit of a sweeter beer but this one is herbal, earthy and dry. I think I was expecting something more like a sticke doppelbock. This thing is seriously herbal and bread crusty. Not bad but a little too one-note at points."
""
"O: Good beer overall. I would by again if the price was right. Interesting as Alt's are one of those styles that I feel doesn't get enough exposure."
"O: my first experience with the style, I did not know what to expect. I am not sure whether I would purchase another bottle, but I am not unhappy with this beer. I think I need to enjoy more beers in the style for a better feel."
"375ml bottle. Stange glass. Deep amber color, foggy appearance. Yellowish off-white froth creates a close, foamy & lasting crown leaving lacing on sides. Caramel, Munich malt & fudge chocolate intense aromas. As expected from aromas, sweet toasted upfront yields to chocolate flavors. Full body. Soft carbonation. Viscous palate. Hints of toasted biscuit & bread, herbal notes & dried nut touch. Long & smooth sweet/bitter finish. Nuts are back on the aftertaste. Solid malty backbone holds hoppiness in well balance, despite its high IBU profile. Nice spot of the Sticke Style: hoppier - but bitterness remains clean- & more caramelish maltiness -but no cloying at all- than a regular Alt & finally a well integrated ABV. Flavorful & delicious!! A masterpiece."

"Beer is medium to meidum-light in body, with carbonation of medium to medium-low intensity, leading to a mouthfeel that is lightly foamy (1/3) and otherwise smooth (2/3). Generally soft and smooth, this manages to fit well with the profile of the beer and the style. Closes very dry, with heavy stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."

"Since Mexas Ranger didn't exactly light my world on fire, it's up to this stuff to salvage the latest BotM shipment. It pours a clear garnet topped by a finger of relatively short-lived dirty cream-white foam. The nose comprises candied orange peel, mildly-buttery caramel, a spit of booze, and a touch of toast. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a small contingent of dark, tobacco-like greens. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a solid sticke alt, nothing really all that special, but an enjoyable, malty little brew."

"O: Interesting in that this beer is slightly more hoppy than I have come to expect for the altbier style (especially having spent a couple of weeks in Dusseldorf). The flavors are a little more bitter and more complex than others in the style."
""
"O: This beer is rather bitter for the style but is interesting nonetheless and quite complex to other altbiers."

"Overall: Really enjoyed this one. Worth your time for sure."

"Color copper-orange with a nice foam when poured. Aroma of bread, cereal, and nuts. Hops aromas resin with a little floral. Medium bodied with a good hops attack. Taste cereal, little caramel, toasted malt. Bitter finish. Like all Signature Serie product from Trois Mousquetaires, it's a really good creation."

"Overall, I'm really digging this beer. Flavours mesh well together, and find a nice balance. Mid range of complexity, and nothing overdone."
"O - This beer is bold, and certainly not for the faint of heart. It packs a strong bitter punch and catches you off guard. Certainly more hoppy than I expected, and the bitterness was quite memorable. I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not certain I would run out for another bottle in the near future."
"O/D - Just sort of lacking in ways. I like it, yet its dusty character leaves room for improvement. Good, but not great."
"Overall - This one reminded me a lot of their Kellerbier; which I also enjoyed. The Sticke Alt has a touch more sweetness however. This is a solid beer; I'm happy with my purchase."
"A complex brew with a real live rustic feel to it that seems to be a constant for the Signature series from Les Trois Mousquetaires. The beer is full of nuances including a real interplay from the hops and malt in the finish. The mouthfeel is full and makes the beer feel like a higher ABV . Great beer of a style not often seen outside Dusseldorf"
"Another winner in a long line of winner from Les Trois Mousquetaires. These guys have German styles down pat."
"D- While I do like this beer, one bottle is more than enough for me, as it's a powerfully flavored beer and the hops are more than enough to satisfy my tastes! The alcohol is very well hidden I think this would pair really well with salty foods and think I'd get this one again, as long as I have someone to share it with."
"Pours a ruby red/light mahoghany with a generous 3 finger head. Lovely lace from a soapy head. Nose is of dark breadiness, and woodiness, grassy and floral hops and some general spicing. Taste is similar, general woodiness and a grassy/mossy/herbal feel with a touch of light caramel. Taste like the Boreal forest? lolwut? Finishes dry and bitter, with tons of dark bread and grain here. Medium carbonation, and lasting bitterness from teh hops. Relatively drinkable, and well crafted. Certainly quite different from anything I would typically pursue."
"Full mouthfeel with just a hint of tingly carbonation. This beer has a lot going for it but the flavors are all a bit too prominent - it never really gels - which is fine for one or two but I couldn't drink more of it. Very nice in small doses, though."
"D: Well, it is balanced, not much alcohol, so nothing to stop me."
"I do like altbiers, and this is a pretty good one. I love the refined, slightly subtle characters on it, and the nutty palate. It's quite pleasant."
"A tasty beer. I love the unusual bitterness here with the complex, tasty, dry maltiness. Very nice."
"This isn't a style I generally seek out, but I enjoyed this more than the altbiers I've had in the past. The distinct bitterness made for an interesting drink, even if it was a bit too dry for me in the finish. Regardless, I'll have no problems finishing off the 750."
"This brew pours an impressive cherry,mahogany hue with beautiful carbonation that leaves behind a very frothy two finger head and nice lacing here,there and everywhere,the smell is a mix of aromas of sticky date pudding,dark plums,cherries and dark malts,it has a nice fullish mouthfeel just above medium bodied whcih is lively carbonated,the taste starts off with the dark fruit flavours with a middle body of toffeee malts and it finishes very bitter indeed so bitter that i noticed it was which isnt the norm for me as i do love my hoppy beers but in saying that after the next glass i quite enjoy this bitterness,its definately an interesting brew that showcases sweet and bitter with a touch of more bitterness than sweet which i dont think i could compare with any other brew i have tried if someone asked what's it like compared to? as it definately stands alone with its different,unique but nice mix of flavours and i will revisit this thats for sure."
"D - i'm generally a fan of the more bitter offerings, this is good but a little too far in that respect to be very drinkable, while the flavours are interesting it does not have thirst quenching properties"
"Nice, light carbonation. A big beer, and very nice to drink."
" Rich, deeply flavorful, satisfying and outrageously drinkable...perhaps that is the secret of this ""Sticke"" Probably this brewer's best effort ..an Alt to die for...hope it's available again...I'll buy cases next time."
"I was slightly taken aback by the flavours in this beer - the proclaimed bitterness was certainly present, but in a dry, unorganized manner, given the very minor sweet/fruity offset. Quite distracting, and not in a particularly good way - I'm not all that sure what to make of this style - it just seems to be coming and going at the same time."
"On first sip I really wasn't sure whether I liked this, but the beer grew immensely on me and probably ended up my favourite of the evening. Its certainly a very fine rendition of an alt, and continues in the trend of this brewery's excellent pedigree."
"Superbly drinkable, nice balance between the malt and the hops, lots of flavor. Would go well with lots of food, nice drinker. Thanks Colin!"
"It's a good idea, but the hops really are overdone I think."
"This brewer is like that box o' chocolates...always as surprise...good and average. This one falls under good/very good depending on if you like beer that finishes bitter"
"A German version of an English ESB produced in Quebec, that's how I connect the dots with this one, and it's one tasty picture. I'm not the biggest fan of such high amounts of Continental hops personal palate-wise, but it's still an impressive and enjoyable ale all the same, and LTM sticks to their guns by producing fine versions of traditional German styles."
"Cheers..."
"I will admit I hate reviewing styles I know little about. this is a great beer and it may be even better then I'm giving it credit for when reviewing for style. that being said you should try this one if you ever get the chance"
"You have to like bitter beer to like this one, and I'm not talking IIPA bitterness here. Not for everybody."
"Certainly tuned me in to Sticke Alts. Obviously a quality product. I want more."
"drinkability is good, if you like hop, its fine and bitter"
"Interesting but lacking balance as the hops overpower everything."
"For me this is too bitter to drink much of. I find all of Les Trois Mousquetaires brews to have this quality: while they definitely know what they're doing, they're all too intensely *something* to drink much of. I always struggle to finish off a bomber to myself, not because it's bad but because it's too intense. Drinkable enough to really enjoy a pint, but that's it. The label states that this beer is, ""...dominated by a gripping bitterness."" I agree. None of the Serie Signature are sessionable in my experience so far."
