"It's lighter in body that expected, though it actually fits fairly well and isn't watery or overly thin. It does lean a little too much in that direction, but not heinously so. It's definitely crisp, with a fair smoothness off of even carbonation."

"O: Nice amber that goes down easy. Good for a few."

"Overall, not my style, just tasted unadventurous, a solid malt beer for people who don't like hops or bitterness. Too pricey for me to drink when I'm not all that high on it to begin with."
"The key to this one is freshness. If you can find it somewhere still in the box, try it out. Otherwise its spoilled and hard to enjoy."
"I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a deep, clear amber with a sticky white head. Toasted grain rules the nose. The taste more or less follows, along with a pleasently bitter after taste. The beer is medium bodied and well carbonated. I enjoyed this beer, a solid all around brew."
"I found this in the beer fridge at my brother-in-law and sister-in-law's house. I figured I would pop the top and take some notes. It is an amber or light brown color. Little to no head to speak of. The nose is the ""highlight"" of this beer with some nutty malt tones. The attack is initially clean and then the flavor follows like a mouthful of straw. It instantly made me think of a beer I had some years ago before I started reviewing called Bitburger. Some people like it, but I remember it for how much I did not. Grolsch amber ale conjured memories of that long ago brew. The tones and flavors in this Grolsch amber are nutty and straw-like."
"A decent if boring lawnmower beer."
"Ugh. Not much ale, more American Macro Lager. Kind of flat. While it is better than most Lager, when you're expecting an ale, this was disappointing."
"Conclusion: This is a simple but quite tasty amber ale with plenty of flavor and high drinkability."
"This beer poured with a generous head and a deep amber color. The aroma is light caramel maltiness balanced by a touch of hops. Medium bodied with good drinkability, the taste is pretty similar to the smell. Very nicely balanced, this is a decent beer."
"(rated Feb 12, 2008)"
"I like the clear bottle in that you can really see the filtered contents within, but as there was no age date, ya gotta wonder how fresh or old this beer is by the time it reaches your tastebuds. But I like it and will drink it periodically throughout the year."
"A fine session beer. Finished the third bfore I tried to review it. (purely an accident, I assure you.)"
"Drinkability: I could have a few of these with no issues, it tastes fine, smells fine, and goes down well. I probably wouldn't reach for many though, its not the type of beer I see as having more than 2 of."
"I'm used to just seeing swing-top green bottles of Grolsch Euro lager on store shelves, so to see this clear-bottled beauty was a rare treat. Not the best beer to have all night, but it probably won't steer you wrong."
"D - Too sweet. To me, this tasted like a sweeter Newcastle with a hint of hops. It isn't a terrible beer, but it is decidedly average."
"D: Decent drinkability, could have a couple of these with a nice dry toasted woodiness and equally nice flowery hopping makes for a decent example though the mouthful hinders a better rating."
"Not a bad amber from Grolsch. A decent session beer that I would have again."
"drinkability is decent. this is a lighter alt in body, with a decent character, but overall lacks in richness. it resembles an alt-flavored red ale, which could be a good thing, but it falls short in certain areas."
"Drinkablity: Decent European flavor with dark characteristics. Easily consumed."
"D: Other than the slight strange bitter metallic taste this is a good beer."
"Actually drinkable, if you plug your nose and don't expect anything spectacular. One of the ""better"" offerings from Gross, um, I mean Grolsch."
"Way too sweet that is my first impression. I am kinda dissappointed since it has been compared to an Altbier by some People. An Altbier tastes different. I am thinking of flying to Duesseldorf to get that real experience back. I just notice if Grolsch Amber is really cold that sweetness becomes less bothering. I don't know how this could be superiour in any way to newcastle brownale by the way."
"Pours a great mid-amber color with wonderful head and good, if uneven, lacing. It has a nice scent, a bit hoppy with a nice fruity kick, although the smell is not very strong. It has an excellent malty taste with a bit of light citrus/tangerine flavor. It's not a hoppy beer at all. It goes down extremely smooth, it's a very good beer."
"Decided to pour this into a pils glass rather than a stange or flute. The smell was sharp as the carbonation kicked up there, leaving a foamy two-finger head. I picked up hints of citrus and yeast, plus earth tones but nothing too hoppy and no strong malt presence. The taste is different though, as the frontkick is drying and hoppy, but it passes over the tongue smoothly as there might be coffee or roast/burnt malt in there. For the price of the 6-pack it wasn't bad, and that aids its drinkability. It is just not complex/lacks depth that holds it back."
"¡Salud!"
"Did not expect much from this to begin with, but it was even worse than I thought it would be, I would not drink this again or recommend it to anybody either"
"Bottle smell is a sweet lightly toasted malt. Poured into a pint glass it has a huge creamy head that clings like there is no tomorrow. Color is, well, amber. Upon sipping the taste is very malty with a broad based bitterness that underscores but doesn't overshadow the sweetness. A typical Holland beer by all means but with a twist. The carbonation is good and the body is very heavy. This is a delicious beer. I could drink this all night long."
"pours a clear dark copper to brown color with a beige one finger head a lots of lace sheeting through the finish. fruity aroma along with some caramel in the nose. fruity and bready slightly grainy taste. mouthfeel, light and good carbonation. nicely balanced beer and i would buy again."
"Pours a dark amber, with burnt bread crust edges and no head to speak of. The nose is very slight -- just hints of bready grains and some earthy, clay-like hops. On the palate, only slight bitterness that's identifiable as hops -- instead there's a medicinal quality to it, like it's chemically derived. Too sweet at the mid-palate and the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit heavy and slightly metallic. Overall, there's nothing to recommend this beer, but it's not terrible."
"d-this will be the last grolsche amber ale i will ever have, unless its the only beer on tap."
"Drinkability is OK but there are so many more macros that are better than this.( I suppose that is not a good thing to say)."
"Overall: Not bad, not bad. Better than expected. Im not familiear enough with the altbier style to speak to style adherance, but this is a decent brew nevertheless. I dont see me paying a premium import price tag for another sixer, but I wouldnt decline a few if offered. Worth a try."
"A delicate and flavorful session beer; but maybe a bit dull in the end. Starts off with a brilliantly clear, abundantly carbonated deep golden / light copper hue, with a favorable foamstand that laced throughout. Aromas show a balance of malt and sparged grains with a mild noble hop (grassy) scent. Mild sulfers is the only deterant in the nose. Flavors also take on a nice malt / grain blend, albeit a bit strained. Sweetness takes on light toasty, biscuity, yeasty heartiness with light hints of caramel and powdered sugar. Sweetness is balanced by German hops, but don't offer much in the way of flavor. Feels light, nearly watery; thus finishing with a linger of grassy hops and mild grain-husk astringency. Fair beer that either needs to be flawless in it's style or gain a bit more intensity in flavor and feel to win beer-lovers over."
"Unfortunately, I was in a smoky bar when I tasted this, so that could have affected my review. That said, the aroma I could smell, besides the smoke, was pretty good, slight caramel and some aromatic hops. Clarity was great, 3 out of 5 on sweetness, light body, since it was bottled, I had no head :( Good carbonation, and of course you can reuse the bottle for home brewing (always a plus)"
"Grolsch Amber Ale pours a reddish brown with an off white head from a clear twelve ounce bottle. There's a little grainyness in the nose, that's about it. There is more flavor than I expected, a bit of toasted grain, some caramel malt, just a hint of sweetness. Much more interesting than I was expecting from Grolsch. Definitely worth a try."
"Pours a dark red amber color, with a nice foamy head that dissipates quickly. Smells like a hint of smoke, some sweet maltiness is also present. Taste is much like a smoke beer, bacony and malty, maybe i'm just crazy though. very unique amber ale. a bit watery, but nothing to turn away from."
"Solid mouthfeel with a full body and no unpleasant residual astringency. Once again, though, the taste really isn't enough to make me come back to it."
"just another well made, reliable, inoffensive brew."
"12 oz. bottle- color of clear dark amber , with a frothy egg shell colored head - nose of sweet malt , and slight hoppieness  taste of sweet maltyness , white corn , caramel , slight bitterness , and semi floral - body is medium , dry , and with medium carbonation  aftertaste of metallic , malty , and hint of sourness"
"Poured into a glass, a thick head arises from the copperish-red body. It's a sweet beer, kind of a hybrid of Bass and Newcastle. Toffee, toasted malts, and a soft gentle hop aroma. Firm, crisp, and easy to drink, I found their Amber Ale to be a pleasant surprise."
"D - This was pretty good. Sometimes with ""old-school"" imports branch out it isn't so good, but this was pretty good."
"Verdict: Lacks complexity. It may not be a great representative of the style, but its availability makes it a good standby beer for those times when better brews aren't within reach."
"Smooth to a point. the malt gets old after a while. Overall, better than the lager, wish the skunkiness would go away."
"Overall a bitter, moderately dark lager. A bit bland, but certainly drinkable if nothing better was sitting around."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a true amber color with a huge head that leaves nice webs of lacing. Smell is all malt, mostly of lighter corn but also slightly of the amber malt and a slight metallic smell. Taste is of caramel and toasted amber malts, nice balance of hops, slight metallic taste as with the smell. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth. Overall, this is a drinkable beer and in my opinion better than Grolsch's Premium Lager."
"Good choice if you are looking for a change. Happy Holidays from the Keystone State!!"
"Drinkability: I could put a few of these away. It has a nice taste, not exactly what I expected from an amber ale, but definitely not unpleasant. This would make a nice session beer."
"Grolsch Amber Ale was clear and amber in color. It had an off-white head with good retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was mainly malt. The taste was malty as well with a slight twang and a dry finish. The mouthfeel was fairly light with medium carbonation. It's nothing special and I prefer the premium lager."
"Picked this up at the local pbblix. It's amber in color, as it should be, it is an amber ale. It has a good aroma. It has a complex, robust taste and yet it still pretty smooth. The mouthfeel is there and it is pretty strong, you feel this ale, and it compliments the taste. All in all a pretty good ale."
"A huge step backward in my search for the best Altbier. I'm sorry, but calling this an Altbier is like taking the phrase ""Fine Pilsner"" on the ""Miller Lite"" label seriously. This is a watered-down, slightly hopped-up version of Newcastle Brown Ale. Medium brown/red (almost artificial-looking) color, slight head, lots of bubbles; smell is hops (even a bit of skunk?) and the taste is (like I said) a Newcastle clone. Nothing against Newcastle; but it is what it is. I was not impressed. To paraphrase a former VP candidate, ""I know Altbiers; I've tasted Altbiers; and believe me, this is no Altbier."""
"Drinking this beer was a very unique experience. I looked at the bottle and was very pleased with the appearance. When I took my first sip, however, I was rather suprised to find that I was drinking nothing but water. This beer had minimun tast at best. What was worse was that I couldn't feel the beer in my mouth at all. This critique might just be me, but I felt that I should have experienced a taste and experienced some sort of feel in my mouth, but none was givento me. This is why I wouldn't recommend this beer. Again, I am still looking for someone to shoot me in the direction of a book or place that can teach me more about the ways of beer."
"Appearance is a copper color with good ivory foam and lacing. Aroma is strong: malt, dough, a faint hops. Initial taste contains sweet fresh bread, a thickish mouthfeel, crisp, bitter hops balanced nicely with malt. The mildly sweet flavor persists to the end, and the finish is barley, malt, fruity hops and is nicely dry. A well-brewed ale."
"poured a medium copper with tannish chunky head that threatened to escape from the glass. Smell is very minimal with a slight malty caramel sweetness present. Taste is very malty with some dry hoppioness initially noted, but rapidly fades to to leave only the caramel malt. Finish is also big on malt. A very easy to drink beer. Nothing special."
"I probably won't buy any more amber ale from grolsch but I won't be opposed to drinking it again either."
"The beer pours an amber color with a thick frothy offwhite head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a mildly sweet crystal malt scent along with a dry aroma. It's simplistic, but good smelling. The taste is decent also. It has a basic malt bill; pale and crystal malts. It's semi-sweet with a dry finish. It goes down easy with a smooth taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good amber ale. There's nothing special going on here, but it tastes good nonetheless."
"A drinkable brew no doubt..and it was ok IMO, but not one i would reach for with better beers available."
"Overall drinkabilty isn't that good. After the appearance, it went downhill. I still prefer this over Grolsch Premium Lager though."
"Clear bottle. Pours dark copper with a thick, chunky, long-lasting head. Aroma of dark (I wanted to say caramel, but that didn't seem right) malt with a sharp hoppiness. Quite smooth malt flavor, very tasty. Hops provide solid bitterness, but there is something ""off"" about it. I can't quite put my finger on it, it's certainly not the skunkiness I've experienced with Grolsch lager. This is an altbier? If you say so. Either way, it is decent for a change of pace."
"This beer is copper colored with a creamy white head. It has a malty bouquet with a slight DMS (dimethyl sulfide - corn) aroma. It has a nice, medium-bodied malty flavor with a light, clean, dry, bitter finish. Not as clean and smooth as Schmaltz's Alt, which I think is a better example of the Altbier style."
"Drinkability: I am not impressed with this one. Yes, it is drinkable, but I would rather choose something else before drinking it. On another hand, it is easy to get something worst than this beer."
"Taste is about the same, rather balanced, but certainly a tame example of the style. Eager carbonation and a med/light body. Easily forgettable."
"Deep clear amber color with a big white head. Sticks around the glass a little bit. Clean hops aroma with a nice roasted malt and wheat back ground. Taste twangy from the wheat and hops. Roasted malts, some grains, and a clean finish. Smooth going down and very drinkable. I am glad I picked up a six pack."
"Forgettable but not regretable. I've spent $3.00 on worse."
"I'm sampling this 6 months or so after it's ""best by"" date. The beer doesn't taste like it's been affected. Grolsch Amber is brown in color with an average-sized, creamy head. Aroma is malty, not too strong, but inviting. Taste is malty sweet, reminds me a little bit of Newcastle Brown, but is better tasting. Finish has a mild lingering sweetness. This is a good, sessionable beer, not too complex, but very much worth drinking."
"I prefer this over original Grolsch. Poured out to an Amber color, decent white foamy head that was quite dense when poured quickly. Aromas of hops with a touch of floral odors. Flavors of roasted hops and malt. Slightly crisp, but had a aftertaste of wheat in the finish. Not bad, but nothing special overall. Worth a try."
"On the bright side, it wasn't skunked even with the clear bottle."
"The best that I can say about Grolsch Amber is that it has no major faults. As noted above, I consider it to be a better beer than its more famous, green-labeled, swing-topped brother. Unfortunately, that's far from a ringing endorsement."
"Funny, before I became a BA (but after I started sampling better beers), this was one of my favorites. It was better in the swingtop bottle, which isn't available anywhere down here now. Now, this beer just tastes weak and thin. Overly sweet, with nothing really standing out. I like Grolsch lager (when I don't have a better option), but this is nowhere near as good as I remembered it a few years ago. How far I've come!"
"I'd never seen this one before a fellow BA brought it over for me to try. Pours a light amber color with a small head that dies off fast and leaves no lacing on the glass. The aroma is of sweet malt. Very little hops in the nose. The flavor is mostly comprised of biscuit malts with a slightly grassy hop. Seems slightly thin, but very good beer. This is a good session beer and much less skunky than the standard Grolsch."
"Bottle-clear: date coded for 1 year freshness dated...produced 4 months from the pour. Poured a clear copper tone with a nice 2 finger fluffy, sticky off white cap that has good retention (We are surprised) Aroma is understated: some musty malts grassy hops slight sourish tone like an alt. Body is smooth..silky, malt pronounced...nice departure of toasty nutty malts with the Hallertauer + Hersbrucker hops present but still in the background...finshes clean but mellow with the toasty malt after tase. This is a mellow altbier... the hops and carbonation are toned back to give it a flavorful nutty-malty taste...it hasnt the sharp edges a well hopped German alt has...its falvorful and quite drinkable I think its been underrated. Then again I may be biased I like Alts and this is a unique malty one."
"Bottle: Poured an amber color ale with a huge off-white bubbly head with good retention (even leaves mark after each sip on my glass which is quite good for macro-type beer. Aroma is only about malt, but its so weak that I would qualify this as neutral aroma. Taste is mildly refreshing with again malt being the only thing really noticeable. Overall lack of character does not make this beer very interesting."
"Foam city on amber and then some pleasant malt followed by metallic dry sweet astringant bitter aftertaste. Grassy thin/medium mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Canadians seem to like this, outside of Quebec. The type you drink cold on a hot summer day. Could do worse, signature grolsch definition."
"I like this beer better than regular Grolsch. Color is ok, clear amber. Taste is roasted malt with a slightly metalic/chemical aftertaste. Hop profile is ok, but not great, over powered by the sligthly sweet malt. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but it does go down smooth. Imagine if Newcastle made a light beer. Although, I would wager the ABV is slighly lower than Grolsch lager."
"Grolsch's amber ale is a decent beer that doesn't have any major flaws other than it's profound unremarkableness, if that's a word. It was one of my starter beers a few years ago and it would be a good one to use to introduce beer drinkers to the craft brew world. No complaints here."
"Malt profile took some thought to sort out. Some vague chocolate malt flavors and a smokeyness that waffled between a peat smoke and oxidation. In a blind tasting, I'd probably have tried to put this in some sort of Scottish category. A bit of brown sugar thrown in for good measure. Not bad, but at the same time there was not a lot that engaged me."
"Looks great with good head retention and lace. Smell is weak but all-malt. Flavor is very weak malt and a slight sharpness contributed by the wheat malt and hops. Mouthfeel is smooth but a bit watery at times. Finishes clean and refreshing. Not offensive in the least.... but BORING."
"Light amber color, medium white head. Aroma is grainy and malty and sweet. Lighter bodied altbier. Lightly hopped, medium malts, slightly sweet. Mild flavor. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly hoppy, some malts, no bitterness. Kind of bland, but a least it dosn't have any objection flavors."
"This was kind of boring for a darker beer. A very average brew. I wouldn't turn one of these down, but there is nothing here that would make me keep on buying this."
"Poured a clear reddish brown hue under a thick tan head with lots of contour. The head stuck around a long time, and left outstanding lace all the way down the glass. The nose was very malty, while the mouth was sweet and prickly. The taste was a bit on the watery side, with largely malty tones, followed by a decent hoppy bitterness. The aftertaste was mainly hoppy and quite pleasant. Despite the price, I liked it enough to have another."
"Clear deep amber color with a minimal head that skims the top of the glass but that forms nice and delicate lace. Sweet aroma, sub-caramel and more like dark brown sugar with some sense of straw. Bready and biscuity malt profile, less carbonation than the Lager. Hops are slightly metallic, somewhat grassy, and are early-comers to the flavor profile. Finishes fairly clean with some tart apple impression. Not bad, Alts rarely are super memorable for me but this is a quaffable beer."
"The beers color on the pour a burnished copper with a massive head that is frothy in texture and a light tan color as it evaporates the lace forms an adequate covering upon the glass. Nose is malt, clean and fresh, start is sweet, lots of malt, top cadaverous, finish is lightly acidic, lightly hopped, dry aftertaste, a Benign beer, and one that I suppose is suitable for a summer cookout, as it does Wet Your Whistle!"
"A nice brew with a meal...Recomended."
"Came with a grolsch ""Bremasters Selection"" 12pk. 2 different beers...what variety!!! Enough with the sarcasm. I paid $8 for this 12 pack and at that price it was a steal. A clear brown beer with nice bubbly white head. Smell is slightly skunky and somewhat flowery. Taste is crisp & mellow with a slight maltiness. Very easy to drink and a good easy on the wallet session brew. There's really not much bad to say about this beer, yet nothing stands out either besides the trademark holland skunk factor. A decent beer,and for the price it's hard to beat."
"I bought myself a Grolsch sampler pack and encountered this beer for the first time. Overall, this seems much more like Bass than regular Grolsch. This beer isn't quite as good as Bass, but its still pretty good. The taste is a little thin, with the alcohol taste quite noticable for an import. As I said, I bought this beer in a sampler pack. Its not very common, and not really worth going out of your way to find. Bass is better. However, Grolsch Amber Ale is pretty good. Drink it if you have it."
"I know I've had better samples of this beer in the past, but if they insist on selling it in clear bottles then they will have to live with the consequences. I'll give this beer high credits for a very attractive beer. Nice frothy head with great stamina, attractive amber colors with hues of brown, and light red. Clear. But because I think my bottle was old both the aroma and flavor were flat and dead. Each had a malty quality that wasn't necessarily unpleasant, just dead. The other area for credit was the very soft mouthfeel. In fact that is what made the bottle worth finishing. Maybe if I have a fresher bottle sometime I'll update this and give it the credit it may deserve."
"Deep and clear dark amber color with a large cream-colored head that retains quite well. Carbonation is moderate; the excellent lace leaves prominent rings in the glass. Aroma consists of dark and bready malt with hints of brown sugar, quite pleasing. Taste begins with solid bready malt notes, reminiscent of home-baked dark bread. Finishes dry with substantial mild hops and dark fruit notes. The mouth feel is creamy and smooth. This is an unflaggingly excellent beer that I will assuredly buy again."
"A very nice surprise, I am quietly highly impressed by this very drinkable beer. And all for just 80 cents. Not bad. I would buy this again for sure; well as soon as they start to sell it in the new ""Single Women Aisle"" anyways  LOL."
"Darkish reddish-brown (amber), off-white head, no real depth or staying power but it did produce waves of lace. Clean nose, hints of malt and grain. A solid dollop of malt hits your tastebuds, a faint hint of roastedness. Medium body, good consistency. Not complex yet very enjoyable pleasing. Clear bottles scare me but I reckon this would make a very good session beer. Try it, recommended."
"Pours with a ""thick"" sound as the dense, creamy, off-white head develops.  The head lasts a good while, leaving a coating of heavy lace on the glass.  The beer is more of a dark amber/mahogany.  The aroma is sweet and very malty, yet clean.  There is a component that is very inviting, yet I can't quite place it.  The flavors are many, including roasted malt, chocolate, and a hint of fruit (I want ot say pears, but that just seems weird).  The alcohol is apparent in the taste, but in a good way.  It has a rather creamy mouthfeel that really caught me off guard.   The hops are barely evident, but are present in the finish (and perhaps are the source of the inviting aroma).  Perhaps one of the more flavorful ales I've tried, and an excellent beer that I will definitely purchase again.   Much better than the lager, which is a good beer."
"Rich copper to brown in color, nice fluffy head that hangs in there for a while. Coarse lace down the side of the glass. The nose was of malt, caramel, and noble hops. The malt was the only one that realy stood out, though. Roasted grains really came through in the flavor, along with a tiny bit of bittering hops. Also, there was a dose of nice, mouth warming alcohol, though the abv is most likely normal. THere may have been a little metallic taste as well. THere was nothing special about the mouthfeel, very average in every regard. Grolsch Lager is one of my favorite beers, mostly for sentimental reasons, and this Amber Ale carries the name well. Much better then that god aweful Blonde crap (that had the same dirty cap problem)."
"Amber brown color.  Foamy head.  Floral caramel hoppy nose.  Toasted caramel malt, spicy hops taste.  Well balanced.  Slightly bitter and enjoyable.  Light bodied.  This beer went very well with my roasted turkey sandwich on fresh white bread with mayo and Tuong Ot Toi Viet-Nam Chili garlic sauce and so did the second one.  Very smooth, very drinkable, well rounded beer."
"Pours into the glass with a nice long lasting rocky white head. Great tea-colored liquid, smells a bit of new mown hay with a light malt aroma. Mouthfeel is light-bodied, due to the addition of wheat malt, with some sweet malt flavors creeping in. Finishes sweet too, with just a hint of hop bitterness. Overall smooth and very drinkable...love the clear bottle/cool label presentation too."
"Notes: We can all assume this is an Altbier or something close to it, I dare not say “German” or I might offend. It’s much further away from American or English styles so that is what they must have been going for. Who really cares right? This is a decent amber ale and goes down just as good as their lager."
"Light amber color w/ a decent head.  Clear w/ no chill haze.  Slight toasty munich and caramel malt dominate the aroma. Subdued floral hop nose.  The aroma is all around clean and unassertive.  Light body, with a smooth and agreeable mouthfeel.  Hop bitterness is fairly low and leaves the beer w/ a slight residual sweetness that isn't overbearing.  No surprises in flavor in this brew.  Innocuous, quaffable and MUCH better than Grolsch in the green bottle.  A pleasant surprise."
"this beer didn't impress me whatsoever, infact it tasing like crap, thin murky brown liquid witha sweaty taste, yuck."
"Reddish amber color.  Head dissipates down to a thin layer of foam.  Clear.  Wild hops and a weak barley/bread aromas.  Herbal malts and slight hoppy notes on palate.  Clean and crisp.  Leaves with a distinct roasted after-flavor.  This is a really good brew.  Very similar to regular grolsch lager.  Not what I'd label as a true premium beer, and not entirely lame and boring like Budmillercoorsweiser.  This would be great on a hot summers day."
