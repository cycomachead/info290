"Ishmael is a decent attempt at an American twist on a German-style altbier. However, the earthy hops were rather overdone for my liking. Perhaps I need to try a fresher bottle to see if the hops contribute more than just bitterness."

"O: looked and smelled great; flavor was unbalanced and not really to my liking;"
""
"O - This makes for a really drinkable copper ale.  The flavors aren't too complex, but they're enjoyable and the body light enough to throw back a few."

"Drank straight from the bottle while walking to the drug store to buy trash bags. Beer has this bizarre mineral taste I can't place. Burton water salts? Heard that a large portion of Munich malt may contribute this flavor too. Would prob taste better paired with food. On it's own a little weak, but not bad for walking around the hood on a mission. Bet it'd be real good in chili or used to steam sausages."

"A good roasted malt character highlights the taste experience with a mellower but somewhat earthy hop finish. This is not a spectacular beer but it is easy to drink."

"A decent take on German altbier. Smooths out nicely with every ongoing sip. Nice balance between malt grains and bop bitterness. Nice, light malt sweetness overall."
""
""

"M: medium,, light harshness on the tongue, no aftertaste or finish"
""
"Overall: A solid and above average English tasting altbier. I would pick this up again, but there are better in the style ad from the brewery."
""
"22oz bomber: This one pours a slightly hazy, coppery color. There was a very small off-white head on it. It has a nice nose. Malty and nutty notes are most prevalent. Some earthy hops and a few lurking fruits. The taste is good. A bit bitter, with an underlying sweetness: a good balance. Caramel malts, nuttiness, a hint of roasted malts. A pretty solid beer."

"O: A nice, simple American version of an Alt. Nothing crazy or out of this world, but the amount of hops add a nice dimension to the style. Pretty solid for $5.99 a bomber"
""
"O: a pretty average brew here, not a horrible one, but not a great one either."
"Overall, very decent. Not sure how many of these I'd want to have in a row, but I enjoyed the big bomber. Decent beer."

"A well-balanced beer with a dry malt start that is accentuated by the white pepper hop flavor. Reasonable body with an equally neutral carbonation. The swallow has elements of a brown ale with an elevated level of hop."
""
"Poured only a 1/2"" head, opaque Naples yellow in color, but it had decent lifespan. The body in masstone lookes like iced tea, held to the light is more of a Raw Sienna yellow, and in either case I wouldn't really describe it as copper. It smells nicely of malt and caramel. Taste mirrors the smell and the munich malt really comes through along with a bitter hops reminding me a little of British though they're American. Medium finish. Nice enough beer."

"Not my favorite style but I've been so impressed with Rising Tide I'll try anything they put out. Good but still not my thing."

"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a hazy, opaque, dull copper coloring with a thin, white, filmy coating along the surface. Aromas of roasted caramel and sugar sweetness, as well as some nutty highlights. Flavors are light, with a caramel and toffee sweet blend riding a smooth, light body. Roasty highlights, with some subtle spicing of fenugreek and nutmeg. The aftertaste is light and short-lived, with a touch of caramel sweetness and roasty notes. Smooth, clean, quick finish. Solid brew...safe beer to lure people into the world of craft with."

"O: this is good for the style and good for me"
"Still quite drinkable overall, interesting take, not exactly falling in love here, but enjoyable."

"22oz bomber purchased at Trader Joe's in Portland, ME. Pours a hazy amber-red body with a good sturdy inch of khaki-colored head. Smells malty, with caramel, chocolate, fruity, nut. Malt dominates the flavor too. Nut, dark chocolate, caramel, and bread all contend to be in front. Medium to full in body with ample carbonation. Awesome. A really solid alt. Tasty and quaffable."
""
"Overall: A solid offering from a very good “up and coming” brewery. I’d peg this one as a great lunch time beer."
""
""
"O - Overall this was a nice beer from Rising Tide. Not my favourite one, but, a good beer nonetheless."
""

"amber in color with copious amounts of carbonation bubbling up toward the surface throughout. Nice white head on top, maybe an inch and a half before settling down to coat the inside of the glass for a minute. Interesting aroma, mix of grains, light bready malts, and a touch of a grassy, herbal hoppiness. Nothing crazy here but nicely balanced. Same could be said for the flavor, nice pale taste, light bready notes balancing a herbal sort of hop. Lightly sweet with a decent amount of carbonation, this one could go down like water."
"o - again, kinda reminded me of the well-balanced approach brought by a Boston Lager. obviously it is a different style of beer, but i'm just using the Boston as comparison since it is an enjoyable, sessionable beer. i won't get this beer again because it didn't stand out too much, but i did definitely enjoyed it and i'm glad i got it"
"Overall, this is a fairly nuanced, yet accessible brew. Decent."
"Second bottle from RT that has been overcarbonated and a bitch to pour. Oh well. Flavor's great though. Lots of potential for this new Portland brewer."
"This is close to being a malt bomb, but dries out nicely on the end. The caramel and fruit flavors dance around. I get some wet, new leather in the back. Smoke? Nah, can't be. The feel is lighter than it looks like it would be. Prickly on the end. Actually went well with the Tuna Melt"
"D - At this ABV and light flavors, very drinkable."
"a bit off-flavored. kinda hard to describe. its still pretty good, just my least favorite of the three Rising Tide beers I've tried."
"A tasty beer that's easy to drink. A nice session beer."
"Overall, a crisp and refreshing take on an alt. Fairly hoppy for the style but still really drinkable."
"Drink is decent, the slight salty minerality on the finish as well as slight astringent flavors take away a bit from the drinkability, but with a nice dry finish and smooth taste, it's almost sessionable."
"Tastes like a homebrew very fresh and smooth with crystal and roasted malts through out. To finish not a lot of body or carbonation leaves a dry roasted flavor"
"D: A surprisingly good beer, with a lighter body than expected, making for easier drinking."
"M/D: Extremely thin with no carbonation. The taste is ok, but the body was a huge let down. When I bought the bottle the store had just gotten them in, the owner took it out of the case and sold me the first bottle, so it wasn't sitting long. Hopefully I will get to give this one another shot."
"Maybe it's my mood but this beer seems like it has the right combination of subtile flavor and mild characteristics for times when one wants a less that robust flavor but still a satisfying beer experience."
"d= decent beer that sort of reminds me of a brown. Fairly easy to drink and still has some flavor. I would drink it again."
"The beer fits the style quite well. I enjoyed it, but wouldn't actively seek it out again. That being said I would like to see what other offering become available from this brewery."
"Pours a khaki, four-finger head that fades slowly leaving a very good lace. Cloudy amber/red color, with some yeast left in bottle. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Indistinguishable nose. Flavor is a bready, barely sweet caramel with the hops coming in late. Lingering bitter aftertaste. $6.75 for a 22oz bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"Solid drinkability."
"Extremely drinkable, rich wonderful taste. Fantastic."
"Medium bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation. This one finishes clean with the flavor lingering on the palate just long enough. A nice solid offering from maine's other nano brewery. I'll finish this bomber with ease, making it one of the more drinkable beers I've had."
"D: Goes down very easily, mild kick, not too filling, very good representation of style. This is a really solid beer. It's the first altbier that I enjoyed as opposed to simply appreciate that it met the style."
"Serving type: 22 oz. bomber"
"Drinkability is great, no problems getting through the bomber, and the crisp bitterness cleans the palate."
"This is a very drinkable beer. I will have problems drinking the entire 22oz bottle. I could even have a second one. This is a good initial offering from this new brewery."
"This was a smooth, easy-drinking beer."
"Interesting choice for a debut beer - not particularly a lot of personality, but a really nice mellow flavor and really a pretty tasty beer. Reminds me of a mild or something. Will definitely keep an eye out for other beers from these guys. Goodluck to them, and cheers!"
"D - Not bad but perhaps not my cup of tea either. Not sure if I would have another but it is worth a try and may try again if offered."
"According to RTB's website (and other reviewers here), the official launch is not until October 1st. The Bear is likely now sold out of the pre-release but we stumbled across a few bottles at Bootleggers in Topsham, ME. Not sure if there are any left but if your curiosity gets the better of you (and it should!) call Bootleggers (or RSVP in Portland) for availability. You won't be disappointed."
"Overall, a great beer from a new brewery. I'll keep my eyes open for more of their stuff, could have another MBC on our hands."
"As for availability, the bartender informed us that regular distribution of Ishmael begins October 1, so keep an eye out."
