Light to medium bodied, pretty good mouthfeel. Taste is a bit watery, reminds me of a not so good brown ale. Definitely a malty one, doughy notes.

3.08,-13.7,4.5,4,2.5,3.5,2.5,"Pours a very clear amber color with more than a finger of white head composed mostly of big bubbles. Head receeds slowly leaving a sticky amount of lace on the glassware and a ring or line identifys just about every sip taken. The aroma is of malt and caramel is offset by a bit of hops. Upon taking the first sip, one of the first things noticed is how crisp this beer is. Then you start to note the malt and a bit of hops that are present. However, a downside is that it also has some sulfur twang to it. Finish is quite crisp but the taste of sulfur lingers along with a touch of hop bitterness that balances out the malt. As the beer warms a little bit more of the sulfur comes out along with a bit of a yeasty taste that almost makes this beer seem young or ""green.""","stakem","Mar 19, 2010"

It doesn't ""take me there"" but the bitterness and overall presentation make me think that this is the style that they were trying to hit. It isn't like a true Altbier, but that may be alleviated if there were some more cold conditioning to take place on this beer. Either way, it isn't bad and I will drink the whole bottle.

It's copper brown color, slightly cloudy with carbonation, becomes apparent as it's poured from the dark bottle into my tulip pint glass, the head fading fast. Smells and tastes a little like Beck's Dark lager, with it's malt heavy character. Subsequent whiffs yield a cheese-like funk, not necessarily a bad thing, but unexpected. Malt is the major player tastewise, although the hops seem to prevent the ale from becoming too one-noted. The ale has a smooth light mouthfeel and I feel like that helps it's overall drinkability and prevents the maltiness from becoming cloying.","JBON","Jan 08, 2010"

The flavor is sweet caramel malt along with some hop character to balance things out a bit. I am glad Southampton chose Saaz rather than Hallertauer hops for this one. The spice pairs well with the sweetness of the malt. The use of the Munich malt along with some wheat help to give this beer a good body. I would say the mouthfeel is somewhere along the lighter side of medium. Drinkability would be rather high for this as it is brewed per style and alts are something to be sessioned anyways.","rtratzlaff","Jan 02, 2010"

This new beer from Southampton may simply be a ""Secret Ale"" repackage job, but the color, mouthfeel, and flavor are extremely close to the popular German breweries--at least so far as bottles go. I have missed Frankenheim Alt since it was no longer imported and I had not seen this before on the local shelves (Wells in Towson) but I love the other Southampton brews I've tried (including the ""Secret Ale"") and so didn't hesitate to pull a 6-pack from the shelf. In fact I bought two. The packaging described a ""Dusseldorf-style"" Alt and I think they've hit the nail on the head. In fact the label says the brewmaster went to Dusseldorf to study the Altbier style. What a pleasant surprise. Fantastic, deep mahogany color, light body with moderate carbonation and the unmistakable scent of malt in the nose. The taste was reminiscent of Frankenheim, though maybe a bit richer and a touch sweeter and nuttier--and much fresher. A bit darker and less fruity than some other craft-brewed Alts and I may actually be ready to suggest that iit's better than the legendary Long Trail Alt; but until I can do a side-by-side (and until I can actually buy Long Trail anywhere in Maryland), this will be a welcome addition to the fridge. Incidentally, this is one beer that sneaks up on you as a session offering because there is no taste of alcohol--none. It's just rich, malty goodness from beginning to end. Good stuff. I am a happy beer lover today. I'll buy this stuff by the case. And thanks to BA Magazine for the timely Altbier article.","tugdriver7","Jan 29, 2009"

Taste was initially good solid malt, but this was quickly taken over by an earthy hop bitterness and finished with an unpleasant metallic twang. Mouthfeel was light-medium with medium carbonation. Drinkability, for me, is not very good with this beer. Right off the bat, the flavor is great, but it quickly diminishes and keeps going downhill. Overall, I didn't think this was a very well-balanced beer. The bitterness was too overpowering and lingered for quite a while, not letting any of the other flavors hang around.

Not much lingering bitterness. Medium body, with a dry finish. Very nice. I liked the malt character, and how subtle things seemed to be.

The flavors at first lean more towards the fruity side of things, with apples, melons and a subtle peach flavor. From mid-sip onwards, a biscuity malt flavor emerges, with a slightly sweet caramel character towards the end. Unexpected mineral twang at the finish. Light body for the most part; clean and airy mouthfeel. It's not light in flavor, and this makes it darn drinkable.

Again, there's a hint of brown sugar and a brief grassy hop flavour in the middle. The finish is dry with a lingering herbal bitterness that's slightly more aggressive due to the malt falling away a little earlier. Medium bodied with a creamy texture and soft carbonation.

The aroma is nothing to write home about--literally, I guess, since I didn't mark down any notes--while the taste is expertly balanced but lacks depth. An almost candy-like sugary sweetness and powerful carbonation are quickly countered by a very strong resiny hop character and, in the background, caramel and malts.

Aroma was a malty scent, with what to me seemed like faint notes of chocolate. Maybe nutmeg? Interesting, but not really all that impressive. Very faint aroma altogether.

The same fruit-malt number that tickled my nose is also apparent in the taste. The carbonation is light, but helps keep the maltyness from becoming overpowering.

3.25,-9,4,4,2.5,2.5,4,"Maybe I was expecting too much, but I felt kind of let down by this one. While it smelled like a decent pale-ale, my first taste was a bit of a let down. I felt the hop presence was a bit too understated, as was the maltiness. As I swished the flavor around in my mouth, I couldn't help but notice a similarity to Sam Adams, but less so, as if it had been watered down. While not a bad beer, it seemed a bit thin. Maybe it was just a bad bottle, but it felt like they were lacking something. For me, it was sort of the ale that almost was. I think if they added some tettnanger or willamettes it might give it that little bit of flavor it's sorely lacking.","DrunkPagan","May 24, 2006"

3.45,-3.4,3.5,3.5,3,4,4,"12 oz. with no freshness date. It pours a hazed bronze/dark gold with some visible particles and finger of tan head on top of a lot of streams of carbonation. It has aromas of caramel/toasted malts with additional notes of grains and spicy hops. The taste is kinda metallic - like a canned beer - and there are notes of lemony/spicy hops, toasted malts, and some kinda ""off"" character that fades as I drink. The body is medium and almost tingly and the drinkability is fairly high. It became more flavorful as it warmed, and it would probably make a good session beer, but I'm not sure if it's worth calling it their ""secret"" ale, as I've heard that they make beers of much higher quality than this one. Hopefully subsequent experiences with this brewery will be more memorable, although, to be fair, I think my recent run-ins with doppelstickes (Uerige and Victory Alt) may have numbed my palate to milder sticke versions.","mmmbeer","Mar 28, 2006"

Bready, nutty flavors of the malt is topped with a touch of chocolate and gives way to grainy almost astringent bitterness when the malt drops out at the end. Seemed like it needed a bigger mouthfeel to support the bitterness. Carbonation was also wierd, almost like seltzer water, which gave it a bite and gave the malt flavors an abrubpt ending.

4.03,12.9,3.5,3,4.5,4,4.5,"Slightly hazy, coppery-gold in hue with amber influences, the liquid has some charm. The head was off-white in color, at the apex the foam was almost a finger in height, it quickly faded to a soapy cap of modest size. The retention of this cap was fair; it slowly fizzed away to a collar. There was no subsequent lacing. The appearance is pleasing but ordinary. Occasionally the bouquet on Alts just dont do much for me, sometimes they lack excitement. This one falls into that category, sadly. I find it too clean and it is not saying much. I have to work very hard to detect some lovely bready aromas and light spicy, peppery notes. I want more. I want a more articulate invitation to drink. Oh well. Thankfully the palate is damn tasty. All of the inadequacies of the nose are forgotten. It was love at first sip. It is as complex as an Alt can get. From start to finish is a bready, lightly caramely mixture with a kiss of nuts. It is kind of dry. I really like how the malt shows itself. The hops offer some spicy qualities, peppery too. The bitterness is moderate but firm and crisp. There is great balance here. Modest fruity notes are in play, some candy apples. Herbal. This is as good as any Alt I have tasted. It would take a hell of an effort to improve on this beer; it is just some well made! Obviously with the taste and modest abv this would be one great session beer. Like Ill every get to opportunity to do that! Medium in body, light but natural carbonation, the mouthfeel is pleasant plus it is sturdy enough to hold the palate in place without being ridged. Nice. Drinkable? Hell yes it is.

It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer although I've had many better than this. This beer was hyped up pretty good. Overall, not a bad sessions beer.","WesWes","Mar 09, 2005"
3.88,8.7,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"This beer pours a burnt orange, coppery color, with tall firm head that leave some lacing (not much) on the glass. Little rivulets of carbonation, but not a very ""bubbly"" brew. Smell was bitter nut, hint of metal and malt underneath. Smells like a light old ale. Taste is light malt and then the mildly bitter hops kick in. Not as balanced as I thought it might be. Dry finish and long lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, not a lot of carbonation and the bitter kicks in before the creaminess is fully noticed. The lingering bitterness would probably weigh on me after a couple. Easy to drink, but I wouldn't make it a session brew.","pentathlete","Mar 06, 2005"
4.11,15.1,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This is the only beer I have ever tried from Southampton Publick house and I certainly look forward to trying more. The Secret ALe is very well crafted and the flavors come together in great harmony. This is the only beer you can buy outside of the Brewpub from what I have seen so if you are in your local distributer I would definately recomend this quality beer.","Biggness","Feb 19, 2005"
3.9,9.2,4,4,4,4,3.5,"This poured a deep amber brown color. Topped with a thin head. The beer had a perfect clarity. The aroma was interesting with tinges of spruce and soft bittersweet fruits. The taste left me curious also. Light, dry and peppery with more touches of bittersweet fruits. Clean and very dry in the aftertaste. A bit more extreme and dry as some other Alts I've had, but overall this is a pretty enjoyable beer.","pezoids","Feb 03, 2005"

4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"Light brown body with an amber hue. Great looking tan color fluffy head. Aroma is all malt with a sweet caramel/brown sugar smell and then some spice. Taste is not as sweet as you'd expect. Malty but not sweet. Dry. Clean finish. Great example of the style. Southampton knows what they are doing. Nice move going retail.","palma","Jan 23, 2005"
3.95,10.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"I was looking at the bottle, thinking that the whole lock and key motif is a bit dorky. A secret to be unlocked. Something just rubs me the wrong way about it. Perhaps it is seeing a proper printed shiny label instead of the good old paper labels that grace the 750's. The beer itself pours a clear brownish. Smells clean, and maltless, more like a hoppy lager, which would be near to the style. Taste is interesting. Lots of initial carbonation leading to this clean nice bitterness and bready malts that are there to back up the hops but not to balance it. There is hardly any sweetness or maltiness, but there is the general bready-biscuit taste in the background. The hops are interesting because they're obviously there throughout, but not so overwhelming that you feel suffocated. Mouthfeel suffers because I think there is too much harsh carbonation. If this was carbonated less agressively, smoother, if you will, then it would be totally awesome. It's good, but not one of the better SPH brews.","twilight","Jan 16, 2005"
3.65,2.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Reviewed from a 12oz bottle drank on 12/22/04. Appears a fairly clear dark amber with decent sized off white head. A little lacing was present but not much. Sweet malt and a bit of doughy malt came out first. The smell is a touch spicy as well. Doughy malts started the taste off and mix in with a touch of sweetness and grain. A bit bitter with earthy hops. Pretty solid but not remarkable. Mouthfeel was about medium with a clean crisp feel to it. I could put a few of these away in a sitting. Solid example of the style. Thanks to slander for the sample.","meathookjones","Jan 06, 2005"
3.31,-7.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3,"Pours a highly clear copper with a nice thick off-white head. Bits of some miniscule floaties in there but still very clear. Smells estery with a hint of caramel. Tatses very nutty and almost a little astringent. Scant bits of sweetness blurb up from the bottom but they are quickly quelled by the slightly mettalic burn that haunts this beer for me. Moderate mouthfeel. I'm a bit dissapointed by the taste and drinkability.","yankeeheel","Jan 04, 2005"

3.8,6.4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured in an imperial pint glass, forms a 1/2"" light beige head, with minimal to average lacing. A slightly hazy dark amber hued brew, with deep a doughy malty aroma. Taste is upfront with a sweet malt hit, then turns slightly sour, and then smooths out with a subtle hops character. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both good, glad to have enjoyed another Southampton.","ppoitras","Dec 26, 2004"

4.55,27.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,5,"On Cask at David Copperfields, NYC. A dark nearly brown colour with small head of tan foam that dies quickly. The appearance of this brew on cask is quite different than it is on tap, but the taste is nearly the same. The aromas are very spicy, with some bitter orange peel, nuts, and complex bitter hops in the mix as well. The taste is spicy, fruity, and nutty, with an excellent hop flavor and a lovely malt presence as well. The mouthfeel is actually a bit light on cask, but the drinkability remains perfect. This is such an amazing beer to have as your staple, but I think I prefer it from the tap (i've yet to sample the bottles, but I was told at SPH that they don't live up to the *real* thing)","francisweizen","Oct 28, 2004"

3.85,7.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"My first ever S'Hampton in a 12 ouncer. Too bad, no freshness dating to be found. Pours dark honey amber, white head composed of tiny bubles, leaves minimal to moderate lacing. Doughy malty nose. Fairly full bodied, flavorfull alt, spicy, clovey, notes of crisp rye, bracingly bitter and a hint of sourness to boot. Complex German style ale. Anybody have some brown bread, sausages and spicy mustard? More tasty brew from SH.","Billolick","Oct 02, 2004"
3.51,-1.7,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"This is the first beer that Southampton has sold in six-pack bottles. I had this earlier in the year in a growler from SH, and I remember thinking it was pretty good, but not necessarily my cup of tea. I think it was better on draft, but in the bottle, it is still pretty decent, but again -- not my thing. I'm not sure if I don't like the style -- maybe I'm just not a fan of those German/European hops, and this brew has plenty of 'em. There is a weak malt characteristic right up front that actually has a hint of smokiness, which then yields to the aggressive hoppiness -- probably Saaz or Hallertau or something of that ilk. I do recall the draft version having more malt character, and thus, better balance. The finish is a bit of that good skunk, along with some profound linegering bitterness. I thought the mouthfeel was a little thin, but it's probably par for this style. Overall, my least favorite Southampton beer so far, but this could make a decent session brew if you like that highly-hopped Eastern European flavor.","bultrey","Sep 28, 2004"
2.96,-17.1,4,3,3,3,2.5,"This poured a nice, clear amber, with a decent slightly off-white heat. Good lacing. Unfortunately, the appearance was the best thing about it. A standard amber ale smell, nothing special or notable. Had a sour, bitter note that hits the back of the mouth, and stays there. It is malt, not hops, and not really pleasant. Kind of like rye, but I am not sure that is it. The bitterness overshadows the rest of the mouthfeel, and I would not have another.","TheJudge","Sep 28, 2004"

3.01,-15.7,3.5,2.5,3,3,3.5,"Deep copper color with a fizzy white head that left decent lacing, but no smell that I could detect. Bitter and metallic lemony hop flavor with a lot of spiciness; creamy mouthfeel that left a somewhat dry and slightly sour aftertaste (I didn't think that was possible.) Its mildness makes it pretty drinkable, probably a good brew for most breweries but dissappointingly average for Southampton. Got this at a reputable place so I don't think it was a bad keg or tap, but it got so many other good reviews I'll have to try it again I guess.","PopeJonPaul","Jun 15, 2004"
4,12,4,4,4,4,4,"Peach amber hue to the color with a nice thick sticky white dense head. Very intense sweet malt nose. Nice smooth mouth. Taste that dry black malt first then a little rye peaks out as well. Quite malty and rich. Dryish finish to the tongue. Slight noble hop finish. Solid drinkable.not a huge standout but it is something you can sit at the bar with... My first SHPH and quite good... glad I can now drink the rest of the Growler. Cheers to Andrew for getting me a long awaited sample from a respected brewer.","frank4sail","Dec 22, 2003"
2.9,-18.8,2.5,2.5,3,3.5,3,"The small head on this dull amber pint bubbled away quite quickly, and left no lace on the glass whatsoever. The faint smell seemed vaguely bitter and hoppy. The first taste was tangy, spicy, and somewhat acidic. As I drank it, there were several times when that faintly vinegary acidity brought red wine to mind. The spiciness seemed overly sharp and one-dimensional to me, as contrasted with the broad and complex spiciness of many of the other beers I've tried lately. Maybe I'm just inexperienced with the style, but I can't think of much to say about this beer other than ""It's kind of hoppy, bitter, and spicy."" To my mind it's just not complex enough to hold any interest.","Weissenheimer","Dec 01, 2003"

3.98,11.5,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Cask conditioned at the Blind Tiger in NYC on 9/20/03. A slightly hazy, very dark amber/copper body was topped by a creamy white head that lasted quite well and left solid sheets of lace throughout most of the pint. Its nose was mainly of a lightly caramelish malt with a touch of fruit (apple, berry) and some floral/herbal hops. The body was medium and exceptionally smooth due to the CO2 breakout from the handpump pour; and it had just enough fine carbonation to add to the mouthfeel and bring out the flavor which seemed to mirror the aroma. It was very well balanced by a solid bitterness; and it finished dry and lingering with some residual caramelish malt; fruit; and leafy, lightly spicy hop.","NeroFiddled","Sep 23, 2003"

3.97,11.2,3.5,4,4,4,4," The hops really came out in the flavor, but the sweetness was right there at their side. It had a very bready finish. The body was medium and it had a very smooth mouthfeel. The carbonation was very light. The hops come in for one last stand just before the grainy aftertaste. It is a nice beer. I could see it as a possible session brew.","ElGuapo","Aug 14, 2003"
