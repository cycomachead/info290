3.7,6,,,,,,"Hazy amber/brownish color with a tan head that gives way to decent lacing.  Both the smell and tastes are a good combination of malt and floral hops.  Very refreshing.  The finish is neither dry nor sweet.  The mouthfeel is good as is the carbonation level.  Overall this is a great beer to have with hot wings (which I did) and with the lower ABV it is an excellent session beer.","Retroman40","Sep 13, 2014"

Nice white head on top, maybe an inch and a half before settling down to coat the inside of the glass for a minute. Interesting aroma, mix of grains, light bready malts, and a touch of a grassy, herbal hoppiness. Nothing crazy here but nicely balanced.

3.88,11.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Overall, a very good alt or amber ale. It more balanced than the American pale ale from this brewery. I noticed the brewery packages this now as an ""amber"" ale instead of an ""alt"" like had for several years.","jkrich","Jun 26, 2009"
3.89,11.5,3,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a hazy copper color, nearly amber, with a loose head, which dissipates rather quickly, leaving just a little ring. There's a little lacing, but not much. Looks about average I'd say. The smell is primarily of maltiness - very sticky and sweet - munich malt I'd guess, but fairly dry in the smell. Nice minty hop presence, kind of slight, but still there behind the sweet caramel smells, with maybe a touch of chocolate. I don't know if I just love the noble hops on top of the sticky malt body, but this one tastes great. A nice malty backbone - caramel, butterscotch almost, nice and bready, a bit toasty. And then a beautiful minty hop presence that sticks to you and kind of washes down with a hint of lime. Low bitterness, almost no esters. This one is nicely balanced, malty, hoppy - but not American hoppy. There are both subtleties and very obvious tastes here, that are all pleasant. There's a kind of sharp bite of carbonation, maybe a bit much, accentuated by the hops. Nice body, not huge, kind of walks the line between thin and full. Maybe a tad on the thin side of medium. A good drink. Nice flavors, not too high on the ABV. Overall, a bit challenging, interesting, simple and enjoyable in varying degrees and phases. This would probably be my choice if I returned.","taylorhamrick","Feb 02, 2009"

Lower levels of carbonation allow this beer's malt character to shine, in my opinion without giving it a soda type of feel. Carbonation is fine and lightly dances in minute small groupings of bubbles on the tongue. This is an easy beer to drink, goes great with a medieval themed novel or movie-makes you feel even more involved in what you are watching/reading. This is one I recommend...a great offering from a local brewery. I'd like to explore this style more before coming back to it though.","becktone","Jun 17, 2008"

3.32,-4.9,3,3.5,3,4,3.5,"A medium copper color, with a quater inch white head, that slowly dissolves away. The scent of malt strikes the nose at first, followed by a light grassy fragrance, then a citrusy lemon scent at the end. The taste is strong and malty, with growing mild bitterness coming in halfway. There is a metallic taste at the end, but only lingers there for a short amount of time. The feel is a little chewy at the front, it then blend to a very consistant medium bodied feel. There is a tingle from carbonation, but nothing to put one off. This beer could be very good session beer selection, very solid in flavor and aroma. When I am at the BBC brewpub, this is a good go to beer.","cameraman","Oct 30, 2007"

Nice taste, too, a good malty beer (I got honey overtones, but that may be the smoothness). It is one of the smoothest beers I've ever had. Very good, very tasty. I would drink more, and will hopefully be able to try it in May when I'm in Louisville.","JamesS","Sep 03, 2007"
3.33,-4.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Really loved this on tap, and brought home a bottle to compare. The lack of freshness was striking and really took this beer down a notch. While the adherence to the dry, toasty altbier style was excellent, there was less crispness, less life, the taste was a touch stale. Certainly well within the best by date, BBC does better by this style with a fresh pour. There is also the issue of the fluorescently lit fridge, despite the brown bottle, which may have prematurely aged this sample. See my other reviews of BBC beers...this bottle was the least flawed so far.","kenito799","Aug 30, 2007"

3.85,10.3,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Much of what I expect from an Altbier is really ramped up in this one. It looks a brilliantly clear copper and golden and pours an over-carbonated white loose head that faded, but laced well. Smells malty, toasty and caramelly. Alcoholic phenols penetrate the nose. Tastes slightly roasty and malty. Nice frutiness like ripe pears and, to a lesser extent, peaches. Spices float in the background: nutmeg and corriander. American hops add to the spice and to the flavor. Sweet alcohol chases you through the body and into the finish. The finish is clean, crisp, and dry. A bit mouth coating: like butter? This is a bold Alt. What do yo expect from an American Micro? A whimpy beer? Not here!","BEERchitect","Feb 15, 2007"
3.33,-4.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Pours a translucent copper color with a nice off-white head. Decent lacing and retention. Smells of caramel, pine and a creamy coffee. Upon tasting, nothing much stood out. It has some soapy malt taste, some non-descript flavors in the middle, and a mild bitter finish. I can't place much of anything. It's not bad, really, but it's nothing real remarkable. It's fine in the mouth, too - maybe a little watery. Goes down easily, for the most part, but nothing is drawing me back to it. So, two thumbs in the middle!","MDekker","Dec 17, 2006"
3.18,-8.9,3.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Got a mixed six-pack of BBC beers from my brother for Christmas. The Altbier says it's best by April 2007. Pours a slightly hazy golden color, with a very small white head. Little to no retention on it. Smells like a classic Pilsner... bread, simple grains, touch of hops, wood, a little musty. Tastes very crisp, with a nice malty aftertaste. A touch of hoppy bitterness. A little chemically in the middle. Overall, could be a little stronger. Mouthfeel has some nice fizz on the front of the tongue, a tad watery in the back.

The body had a translucent golden-amber appearance. The nose was spicy, with herbal hops and slightly sweet toasted caramel malt. The taste was toasted, a bit metallic, but not estery - this beer was very lager-like, and reminded me of Brooklyn's O-Fest. It had a sweet finish, and little bitterness. The mouth was medium, and there was a lot of tingly carbonation. An easy beer, with nice body.","mjc410","Nov 29, 2006"

Flavor begins somewhat sweet, with light fruit and bready malt notes that give way to a nice balancing herbal bitterness. This is a subtle but very tasty beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. All in all, quite a nice effort!","zerk","Jun 18, 2004"

3.8,8.9,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Tawny-coppery-amber in hue, slightly hazy but some animation is noticeable racing towards the head, which reached a finger in height. The compact bubbles of the white head hung together well, in other words the retention was very good. A small, tight cap lasted the entire consumption. Impressive. Subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling well. The nose is pleasantly malty, as expected for the style. There is also an airy, grassiness that is mainly at the front. The malt imparts a touch of toffee and a very weak suggestion of peat and nuts. I realize neither of the latter two are typical for an Altbier. Honestly the bouquet seems more a kin to a Märzen and a Scottish Ale mixed. Whatever, I like it, it is inviting with modest potency. The palate immediately tells me it is German. However it is also very clean like a lager. Odd. The grassy hops with a slightly herbal hint and only modest bitterness say German. The hoppiness is good but the malt makes this beer work with its slightly sweet beginning and long toffee flavors in the middle. At the finish the beer dries out substantially. This works. The finish is muddled, just a bit, mainly because it becomes tacky and too sweet. But, overall, the palate is straightforward and tasty, if not overly complex. This is a good, clean, German Ale. Medium in body and modest carbonation helps produce a good mouthfeel. This is plenty drinkable, likeable as well. It is worthy a try. Thanks SheepNutz!","bditty187","Mar 06, 2004"
4.15,18.9,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"VERY easy to drink, this goes down like water but is a wholesome quality altbier. I was pleasantly surprised by this, not expecting much for an American-brewed Altbier. Light and refreshing. Nice.","Mitchster","Feb 29, 2004"
4.15,18.9,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"On tap poured into a pint glass. It pours a deep amber color with two fingers of head. There is lots of sticky lace left on the glass. The smell is both hoppy and malty, a very good balance. Some caramel aromas come out. The taste is malty and a little bit sweet at first, with bits of toffee. There is a good dose of hops on a nice crisp finish. The mouthfeel is very thick and smooth for the style. The drinkability is fantastic. This is one altbier I could sip on all day.","SheepNutz","Jan 05, 2004"
3.33,-4.6,4,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Appearance: Pours a copper amber tone with a nice size creamy textured cream head, the lacing coats the sides in speckled streaks. Aroma: Toasted malts some vienna possibly but not as sweet there's a slight woody tone with toasted nuts there to back it up, not bad. Taste: A very strange mix that I can't say it's sweet or bitter a bit mute overall a wave of biscuit malt with a bready characteristic that finishes with toasted malts. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied very crisp and smooth nothing cloying. Drinkability: I am not very familiar with the altbier style, but this one just doesn't do anything amazing for me it's alright but I haven't fallen in love yet.","WVbeergeek","Dec 26, 2003"
2.7,-22.6,4,4,2,3,2,"I was at first impressed with the copper color and the creamy head. But the head quickly sank and the aroma was correct. My first taste told me the whole story, it is not a great example of the style. There was no bite at the beginning, but it did however have a clean finish.","coasterfreak75","Dec 11, 2003"
3.65,4.6,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Copper colored with a light beige head that sinks quickly. Aroma is of sweet malt and honey, a bit bready. Flavor is light and clean, with round malts and butterscotch, some honey and a tingly citrus finish. Smooth mouthfeel. No other flavors come through in the finish or aftertaste, except a bit more of malt and a light splash of hops.","far333","Sep 29, 2003"
3.66,4.9,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Clear coppery amber in color with a large foamy puffed high dark ivory head, fades slowly down to thick haze always present and long stings of lace stick well throughout the consumption. Light toasty malt aroma with some grassy/floral-like hops and notes of toffee. Taste is nice and soft, well rounded toastyness of malts, light dry grassy hops dry out some of the finish with some mild bitterness lingering. Feel is close to medium with playfully light carbonation, fluffy textured and floats right down making for some easy drinking. A good session brew, filling in a calming easy fashion with just enough flavor and body to keep it interesting.

3.63,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a medium coper color with a cream colored head. The head displays excellent retention. Soft, malty aroma has hints of caramel and biscuity notes. The taste is initially sweet, with a slightly fruity component, then finishes crisp and bitter. A touch of sweetness sweeps in on the aftertaste, but is quickly replaced by the lingering hop notes. Mouthfeel is smooth and the beer is very drinkable. An interesting flavor combination. I'll definitely consider buying more of this on my next trip to Kentucky.","aaronh","Jan 29, 2003"

There was a slight cookie smell to the beer. The taste was a rounded fruity malt with a tart bitter finish and firm mouthfeel. Overall it seemed a good drinkable beer.","fattyre","Nov 26, 2002"
