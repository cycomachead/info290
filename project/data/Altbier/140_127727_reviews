"Overall: Excellent; malty and clean bittering.  Could drink this all day.  The best of a brown ale and a German lager together.  Would buy a sixer if readily available.  [My first Altbier.]"

"Overall: good beer"

"3.36/5.00"
"After the beer is finished the display of rings along the glass is very impressive, and since this is a style I don’t have often so I will appreciate it for what it is and deem this a pretty tasty altbier. It reminded me of October drinking outside and made the German in me proud."
"This is a great beer.  It's a touch more bitter than most alts, but thats part of the appeal.  I would gladly purchase this again.  Well worth a try."
""
"Once again, with (unintentionally) aged beers, a light hand is probably best, following the Pop!ping of the cap. The bartender's trick netted me a finger of dense, light-brown head with reasonable retention. Color was Coppery-Brown (SRM = > 17, "
"Nice brown color. Good malty flavor with good hop balance. I enjoy Alts and this one was quite good."
""
""
""
"Overall its a decent take on the style and a decent idea by Victory. Enjoyable."
""
""
"Working off old notes.  Will update with more details if/when I have another."
"This isn't too bad.  I'm not a huge fan of Alts, but this one is super hoppy.  I don't think I'm a fan of the citrus rind lingering bitterness on top of toasted malt."
""
""
"This is definitely worth trying. The malt profile is quite nice, as it's kind of like a light barleywine. It's true to the style, except for the hops, which feel a little out of place. A little too leafy and earthy for my taste."
""
""
""
"Russet brown body with a small, soapy, off-white head of broken bubbles. Aromas of dark malts, grain, brown bread, fruity esters, yeast. Similar flavor, with the addition of a mild hop character. Bready with a hint of bitterness. Sweet brown breads. Decent."

"11/5...BCAA 5/12...pours dark amber, reddish brown, lid of foam and some lacing. Sweet caramel malt nose. Bready and toffee too. Punchy hop bitter starts out and slides into a tighter and lighter sweet malt. Bitter in the background grinds. Better than a typical alt, chewy, good buzz."

"A very tasty and a touch toasty altbier. Very smooth and has a super slippery light texture. This is the first of the beer camp pack that I actually can say I enjoy drinking. very smooth, although there isn't a ton of taste, its much more about the texture of this one~"

"Pours a dark reddish-brown with a half inch head after a very aggressive pour. Aroma was pretty muted, with only a slight bit of bready sweet malt notes, and just a touch of some grassy bits, although this is probably due it it's age. The taste is a little more pronounced, with a bit of roasty malt flavors and some citrusy fruity tastes. The mouthfeel was medium to light-bodied, with some nice lingering bitterness that stays on the palate. Pretty tasty, but just OK, not great."

"A decent beer at best."

""
""

"Overall:  Nice altbier.   A traditional style that is good to see breweries make every once in a while."
""
"O- Not bad. Really drinkable. Like the balance of hops and malt, along with the nuance of flavors from cold aging."

"O: Perhaps a bit too hoppy for this style in my opinion, but was quite tasty on a cool fall day."
"Overall an excellent beer."
"Reddish dark amber in color, nice thick off-white head that has very good retention. Mild malt aroma, slightly sweet. Smooth flavor, easy drinking. Medium body and carbonation level."
"Packaged on date read 6/3/14. Poured into my Prima Pils cylindrical glass. Dark copper to light amber. Crystal clear with very nice carbonation and rocky foamy head that lingers. Some sweet toasted malts. Some spicy hops and maybe some faint citrus. Malty upfront with toast and some light caramel. Breadiness from the malts lingers with just a touch of bitterness to lend the proper balance. Feels slightly chewy giving it a medium to full body. Malt is dominant, and proves to be a well made beer. Appreciated this beer much more the second time around. Would go great with some German fare like brats & sauerkraut."

"Big malt with some earthy hops, light grain and hints of spice greet the nose. It pours brilliant light brown with a bone white 1” head. A very creamy palate starts with an initial fleeting hint of butter that quickly fades, replaced by biscuit with hints of caramel. The treatment of the bitterness in this beer is outstanding. It is assertive, present from start to finish but so well balanced by the malt. This is fresher than anything you will get imported from Germany. The imported stuff is often a year or more old and the hops are muted and some of the rich malt and grain flavors are hidden behind wet cardboard oxidation flavors. Here, the hops are in full bloom and a joy in perfect balance with the malt."

""
""
"This ""take"" on an Altbier is simple....add a lot of hops. Though it is tasty I prefer my Altbier very malty."
""
""
" The taste is very good with nice malt flavors and mild yeast with balance of spice and noble type hop flavor with mild caramel in the malt and light nutty woody taste from the hops with yeast support. Overall A very nice alt, I consider this balanced and drinkable"
""
""
""
""

"O-Another beer from the mix pack that seemed very average."
""
""
""
""

"O=This may compliment a pork dish, but on its own, its barely worth the time.  Okay for the style, but just not enough there to enjoy on its own...if you still have one, start it before a meal and see if the meal compliments it.  I wouldn't buy this if offered."
"O: very enjoyable to drink;"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"o; A pretty good representation of the style, makes a good dinner beer, but not tasty enough to be much of a sipper."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Amber in color w/ a slightly sweet aroma. Tastes of grainy malts w/ a tinge of hop bitterness at the end. Very balanced & tasty brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I am not a master of Altbier but this seems to follow the styles general guidelines with added hops and more fruit (probably not aged that extendedly). Another solid offering from the Beer Camp series."
""
""
""
""
"O - I enjoyed this beer. Being my first exposure to the style I have little to compare to but will probably seek out other examples based on this offering. Complex enough to hold my interest. Wish it was sold separately."
""
""

"Bottle from the 12 mix pack at Tipples. Pours very dark amber brown with a full creamy off white head. Lots of malts on the aroma, dark cherry, pears, some yeast esters. Flavor is sweet fruits, lots of deep rich bready malts, balanced by a bitter crisp hoppiness on the finish. Light to medium bodied with plus carbonation. Overall I found this very nice, though I'm not super familiar with the style so don't have much to say about adhering to what it should taste like ."
"I like this one a lot, very good alt with a nice aroma and body.  Not quite special, but good enough to grab one before they are all gone."
"Mouthfeel is pleasant sweetness in the beginning then mild hop and bitter crispness."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a decent tannish fluffy head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a clearish brown. The beer smell has a nice fruity and toffee character to it. The beer also has slight hop notes to it but are dominated by the other notes. The beer taste is similar but the hop notes are much stronger and mix well with the toffee and fruity notes. Slight bready taste. The mouthfeel is smooth and a little thick with some cushiony carbonation. Overall, a pretty good altbier and worth getting. Certainly one of the better collaborations."

"Damn good alt. Nice job by two of my favorite breweries."
"This beer has a very pleasant malt bill and sweetness with a well proportioned level of hop bitterness for the style."
""
"Not a bit Altbier fan but this one made me go out and buy a few other brands just to try them. So far none have tasted as good as this one which I think was due to the slightly higher hop flavor compared to the few I bought after the fact."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall:  I love a good Altbier though it is a style I rarely get a chance to taste; while this one is not traditional due to the hop bill; not sure what was used here but it really worked well from my perspective"

"Pours dark amber, almost red color with a finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are good.  Has a fruity, slightly roasted malt aroma.  Hints of chocolate.  Slightly roasted malty taste up front, followed by a moderate hoppy bitterness, ending in a stronger dark roasted/dark chocolate aftertaste.  Somewhat spicy.  Good beer.  I definitely did enjoy this one."
""
"D:  This is a highly quaffable brew in that it is well made with great balance.  It won’t deliver much beyond that but considering the style this is very good."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle: Poured a clear deep brown color alt with a nice light brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of caramel malt with some earthy and citrus hoppy notes also noticeable. Taste is also dominated by loads of caramel malt with some earthy and citrus notes with medium residual sugars notes. Body is about average for style with good carbonation. Nice take on the style with great drinkability."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Good but not great, tasty but not complex"
""
""
"Taste follows the nose, fairly uneventful. Stale finish. Drinkable but lacking any real character."
"Overall: New World hops in an old world style often work, i'm just not a fan in this style. (3.50)"
""
""
""
"This isn't bad, I kind of like this one."
""
""

"Overall a nice beer!"

"Overall: Solid beer overall. I took off a few points for not conforming to style. It's definitely a bit hoppy for an altbier, but that's okay for this hophead. It's definitely worth trying."
"O:  Another ""just OK"" style from the SN Beer Camp box."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste has more nutty maltiness, a firm hop bitterness, and a yeasty note. Well carbonated and with a relatively substantial body for an Alt. Dry aftertaste. Overall one of the more successful beers in the series. 4/3.75/3.75"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This was a bit of a let down. I thought Victory would absolutely nail an altbier but this kind of hot and too hoppy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It is a good beer."
""
"O- not really sure I've had an altbier before, I see Double Bag on the 'Other Beer Style Examples' list, but I don't remember it being similar at all, I also see a few Oktoberfest beers, I wish more were more like this. Two of my favorite breweries giving me a new style to try out and explore is a plus, I need to check out more in this range, because I really liked this!"
""
""
"Overall a pretty good beer -- can't really complain about it -- but not one of the best of the Beer Camp Across America pack."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Poured a gorgeous clear, deep copper colored body with three fingers of fluffy off-white head that slowly receded leaving minimal lacing. A nice looking altbier that is fairly true to style. Scents of sweet, bready, and grainy malt with a touch of caramel and very light levels of fruity esters most reminiscent of apple. Overall impression of the aroma is subtle, yet malty with a very light fruity ester presence. Good and true to style. Flavor begins malty and clean with light notes of sweet caramel and bready malt balanced by a moderate bitterness level with bright notes of grapefruit peel and pith and citrusy hops. Middle continues these flavors, though bitterness increases to moderate-high. Finish is medium-dry with notes of grapefruit peel and pith, bright citrus, light caramel and bready malt. Aftertaste is dry with lingering bitterness and notes of bready malt, light caramel, grapefruit pith and slight notes of honey. Overall impression is of a fairly bitter flavor profile anchored by a nice sweet malt presence that is rich and bready with caramel notes and a slightly more citrusy hop profile than is traditional for an interesting twist. Mouthfeel is medium-light bodied, very smooth in feel with moderate carbonation. An easy drinking feel that is quite pleasant. Overall this is a nice altbier. In many respects it sticks to tradition in aroma and in the malt aspects of flavor, as well as with its smooth mouthfeel. Yet it tries new things with more citrusy hop flavors. The end result is a fairly good take on the altbier style that is very pleasant to drink."

"A finger's and a half worth of crisp dense light to medium khaki colored frothy goodness comprised of medium to large chunky bubbles...  Excellent retention...  Turns creamier as it settles a bit and begins to show a slightly rocky top...  The color is a medium to dark brown with a slight reddish hue...  There are also some light caramel undertones...  A moderate bit of quick paced swirling carbonation...  Smells like you just walked into a brewery...  Loads of toasted malt and boiling wort...  A light caramel and toffee sweetness lingers a bit beneath the surface..  Medium bodied...  Sturdy...  Satisfying and smooth...  Some light carbonation...  Robust flavor...  Brown sugar...  A strong nutty presence...  Roasted malts...  Boot strap molasses...  A light kiss of hop on the finish...  An outstanding brew and my personal favorite from the Beer Camp Across American collection thus far (only 5 brews in)...  Leaves up to the expectations from a collaboration between two superb breweries...  Cheers..."

"Overall, this beer achieves what it set out to be, a citrusy altbier with plenty of care going into it.  I'd down a few mugs of these if I had the opportunity, the two that came in the mix case will do for now."
""
"The beer pours a crystal clear dark ruby red. Nice full ecru colored head that refuses to die down. Great fruity scent. Smells of grapes, pear and a hint of maple. Very smooth mouthfeel. Malt forward tasting, but less fruity than the nose. Finishes with a slight hop bitterness to balance out the beer. Very clean finish. Very well done altbier."
""
""
""
"I can't really recall and altbier's I've had but would like to try and find some to compare this one.  It's fairly different and I'd try it again.  Kind of refreshing!"

"O - Very enjoyable brew.  Reminds me of a hoppy Dopplebock.  I'll look forward to another one of these."

"A beautiful caramel nose with zesty, spicy hops. I get notes of coffee and bitter cocoa. The taste is balanced nicely between those very hops and dark caramel malts. High bitterness, actually kind of striking, as it lingers long after each swallow. Good medium body, there but not heavy, with solid carbonation. Overall, I'd like to see more of this style, and I really enjoy the hop presence and malt balance. However, the bitterness lingers on and on, detracting from the overall experience."
""
"O: A solid take on the style. Nice and robust while remaining easy to drink. Definitely one of the maltiest in the 12-pack"

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/3/2014. Pours crystal clear deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toast, toffee, brown bread, pear, apple, light roast, light herbal, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, yeast ester, and light hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, light fruitiness, herbal, floral, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown sugar, brown bread, light roast, light fruitiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and balance of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light yeast flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good altbier style. Good balance and robustness of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and light yeast flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"Overall, I love the way the citrus aspect and fruit come in to give the grain centerpiece a kick. I don't think I'd call this a ""traditional"" alt, but it's close enough to not have lost sight of the original style, and their interpretation is really tasty. I'd have to say that this one is the surprise beer of the pack for me. It's not my favorite, but it really exceeded my expectations based on what I've heard/read about this one from others."
""
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent copper color with a 1/4 inch of head. Some lacing. The aroma is malty with some citrus notes in the background. Lemon, caramel, and earth. The taste is sweet lemon and orange along with bready malts and some caramel. Hints of toffee. Some earth notes and more sweet citrus towards the end. Malty finish. Floral hop aftertaste with more caramel malts. Light body with not a lot of carbonation. Overall, pretty decent Altbier and better than I expected."
""
""
"Overall a well crafted beer, very drinkable and flavorful, a great example of the style IMO."
""
"O: Well they certainly took some liberties with the style, but that was clearly their intention. This is much bigger and bolder than any alt I've ever had. The flavors at work don't really mesh well though."
""
""
"I think Victory makes some damn good beers, but I was not expecting much from this one. This is the first Altbeer that I have ever had that I am aware of. It was more hoppy than I initially thought it would be, its a solid beer and well balanced, not a big surprise from Victory. It is described as an old style beer with a new take on it. I think this is one of the better ones of the lot but nothing spectacular either. It looked good, had good head retention and overall a solid beer experience. I would drink more of these for sure if they were around $7 a six pack."
""
""
"A well done Altbier. Easy drinking, with a well balanced hop and malt character."
"Prost!"
""
"I never have had too many styles of this beer before, but I still enjoy it. It has a strong malt profile. I get flavors of toasted grain, bread, and sweet malts that all lead into a slight citrusy hop flavor to finish it out. It is sturdy and warming but still quite refreshing!"
""
""
"Overall – A rather good alt. A nice level of roast that complements the sweet rather nicely and leaves one with just enough bitter from the hop to cleanse the palate a bit."
""
"O: A pretty enjoyable beer, overall, but the fairly strong lingering bitterness is a bit odd and holds the beer back as a whole."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: nice style, sufficiently interesting."
""
""
""
"O- The altbier is not a very popular style it seems, but I have had some really nice ones over the past couple years. This one is a little more average to me. Not a big fan of anise and missing some of the lighter fruity notes that I find pleasant in the style."
""
"O - This is good, would seek this one out. A nice relaxing beer that has the flavor and enough depth to keep it interesting, yet light enough to enjoy a few on a hot summer evening. More hoppy than most in this style, but it is very well balanced and works well."
""
"This is a damn good Altbier. I would be more than happy to pick up a 6 pack of this to quench my thirst on a nice warm day, or to sit back with at the end of the day."
""
"An interesting but not very drinkable concoction, though lovely to look at. From the 12 oz bottle that is part of the 2014 Beer Camp dozen."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Aroma is fitting for the style with some bready caramel and notes of German malts and a light kiss of hops which expands with warming. Taste follows with light caramel notes and some bready toasted vienna malt character. Offers a fairly long finish of malt depth, not overly sweet and with some muddled hops in the mix. A soft mouthfeel for the style is welcome and makes for a very quaffable Altbier. Not a style I'm overly fond of but a good example for my palate."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - tastes like an alt, but it's nothing spectacular. This is one of the more disappointing Beer Camp collaborations in my opinion."
"O: The taste of this beer has a very good balance between the malts and hops is very true to the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Crisp, clean and quite refreshing, its minerally finish concludes the medium-dry body that begins the show. Its light husky astringency reminds the senses of rye but is softer and gentler on the palate and taste even as its bitterness intensifies with each sip."
""
""
""
"O: a nice drinking beer of a sort I've never had before - similar in some ways to other brown ales I've had - mellow, roasty and hearty - as far as I can tell, essentially a German brown ale - if this particular ale isn't a good representative of the style, I wouldn't know, but as compared to American browns and IPAs and all the other stuff I've had, I'd say it's a good beer..."
""
""
"O: Fairly hoppy for an Altbier but still enjoyable - not quite the sweetness that I expected from the style (and I have been to Düsseldorf and enjoyed the majority of Altbiers available there). Alcohol is well hidden and this one is pretty tasty, making it easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Taste is definitely heavy on the toasted malts, with a bitter hop bite that cuts thru the palate pretty quickly, though. This one, with it's toasty, almost roasty character, reminds me somehow of an extra-hopped brown ale, almost. Regardless of comparisons, this remains a tasty and unique take on the alt bier tradition."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Nice character here. Kind of tangy, which I can deal with.Mild nutty thing going on. Very smooth feel, though somewhat thick. Easy enough drinker. Somewhat hearty, though not overly so enough that it makes it too much."
"The Verdict: Good beer. Victory is one of my favorite brewers and I can’t find them as readily out here on the left coast. I was hoping for something to knock my socks off from them, but I don’t think there’s a lot of room for experimentation in an altbier. Quality brew, but nothing unique or earth-shattering."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Really simple, a little boring,mild tasting, but still tastes and good and enjoyable. Nothing special and a little weak but still worth a drink."
""
"O- As befitting a collab between SN and Victory, this is a beer that seems to conform to the traditional style but with an American twist. Here, the pine flavours are fairly dominant on the finish but the rest of the beer is just enough to keep things interesting. This is hard to judge as I have not had any altbiers brewed outside of Dortmund, but this is what I imagine an American take on the style to be. I would prefer less of the signature pine bitterness, though."

""
""
"O: Another decent Beer Camp beer, of a more obscure style. Still has that SN taste to it though."
""
""
"Pours out a black tea body with a thinnish head. Smells lightly malty and a bit grainy. Honestly, I'm not picking up a whole lot of aroma. Flavor is a bit deeper. I get some dried fruit, caramel malts, toasty malts, a touch of grain, and clean yeast. Mouthfeel has a really soft carbonation. Smooth body. This is OK. Kind of like a lot of US made altbiers: they just don't cut it for me and lack that great German maltiness. Doesn't hold a candle to old world versions."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall interesting, altbiers are def a different style that most breweries are not sure how to do, and I have a tough time judging them. this is decent, big hop and malt balance, big on both sides but balanced, bit too big on spicy piney hops though."
""
""
""
""
"Overall not a truly traditional alt, but like the hop flavor on the palate that washes nicely with it. interesting compliment, and something different for once in this style. Hop aroma no, flavor on the palate, delivering. Fun alt."
""
""
""
"12oz. bottle served in an SA Perfect Pint. Pours a translucent mahogany with a loose, half-inch, cream-colored head. Nose expresses toasted malts and some fruity esters. Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also an earthy/spicy bitterness that cuts through the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively carbonation that leaves a residual prickle at the back of the tongue. Overall, a pretty good Altbier I have to say. Nice malt profile and just enough bitterness."

"Overall this is another solid beer in the Beer Camp series. Like others its not world class or mind blowing but solid."
"gotta be upper 40's to upper 50's IBUs here. seems a bit much, not necessarily for the style, but for the beer underneath it. Very enjoyable though. if I could get the balance it's got at room temperature, but 20 degrees colder, it'd be amazing to me. no warming alcohol or hop-based astringency, though the sharpness is distracting at times. Fairly crisp. Would drink again any time."

"O-Missed the mark. Was not high on this one. Surprised because Victory was the tag team partner here. Goes to show that much more often than not, when it comes to brewing beer, one head is better than two."
"Overall: Very inviting malt forward malt aroma. BItterness is prominent but pleasing in the flavor. Well made beer, I would drink many more. I will seek it out on tap."

"Overall, I’m impressed with the beer and the loads of earthy hops and balance it executes."

"My first altbier. Maybe my last. The malt bill leaves me kind of unimpressed and the lack of any other prominent flavor makes for a boring beer. Not my cup of tea."
""
""
""
""
""
"O. A very good Alt. Loses a few points for the noticeable (yet not overwhelming) booze on the finish. Would like it to have just a slightly more rounded mouthfeel. With that said, this is well crafted. Love how they got some marked fruit presence in this one. I dig it!"

"O: Another great beer from the Beer Camp 12-pack."
""
""
""
""
"Poured on-tap at a Beer Camp tap takeover, the beer was served in a shaker pint. The beer is a ruby-amber coloring, with a low, filmy, clingy, white head. Nose of roasted caramel and toffee sweet, subtle molasses notes, and hints of booze. Very rich and layered. Flavors continue with the rich character forward, with a caramel candy and roasted quality, subtle char, and an underlying bitterness. Smooth and rich in mouth, with a bitter, richly sweet caramel aftertaste. The finish is smooth, but surprisingly quick. Very nice brew."
""

"I'm on my third Beer Camp brew, Alt Route. This is an altbier, labeled to be ""anchored by a layered, slightly sweet malt body supported by citrusy hop flavor and aroma."" It delivers on that promise fairly well, but lacks in the ""malt body"" department. The hops have taken over, and while I'd usually shout ""Oh, hell yeah," the balance is off here. All in all, it's a good beer and Im excited to be working my way through the camp, with a full stomach and a sound asleep girlfriend. I think the first two brews went to her head... or maybe it was the white wine she started with while we were cooking."
"O- My first experience with an altbier and found I found it very enjoyable. I only wish I had a few more!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Not a style I am all that familiar with, but this beer is diverse and enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's malty tasting and sweet to start. Subtle hops give it a semi bitter finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The flavor is crisply malty, a tasty caramel note which tapers down into a smooth finish. Yes, adjectives are a dime a dozen here but this was a tasty one."
""
""
""
""
"This isn't the rich malt drink I've grown to love. I like the hopping and this has potential but the lack of clear rich maltiness is really a buzz kill and a big disappointment, esp. considering what an alt by Victory can be."
"Mouthfeel is relatively mellow to the full side. Dryness is the key player as you continue to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a brilliant medium brown with copper highlights and a lingering frothy cream head. Toasted malt and floral hops form the initial aroma, with grainy sweetness, resin, and body odor adding complexity. Flavor is floral hop dominant initially, with an underlying toasted malt backbone. The finish is fairly bitter and perfumey. Not a real fan of the finish. Citrus hop notes are light, and perhaps the most enjoyable thing about this offering."
"This is not my favorite style, but this really leaves it mark as a excellent beer."
""
"O) It's fairly good. Wish it had a little more flavor."
""
"Overall: I'm not always a fan of alts and ambers, but this beer is pretty drinkable. That said, it's got a lot of biscuit I could do without."

""

"Overall, the roast in the aftertaste of this beer really bugged me. The other flavors were good, however."
""
""
""
""
""
"The aftertaste is slightly bitter and very pleasant. I'd say this is a winner."
""
""
"The malt sweetness is superior with the dark fruits being played down a touch. It ends moderately hopped and moderately dry. Nice beer all around."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall: Very nice Altbier overall, or more accurately, Sticke. While I like hoppy and bitter beers, it may have been a titch too much here. Otherwise, a much better beer than I expected."

"Not enough malt character in this beer, and too much hops. So far my least favorite Beer Camp."
""
"another well made but somewhat unexciting beer from the beer camp box. ive liked victory a lot lately, and this is indeed a nice alt, with a little bit of a tannic malt sting before the clean finish, i think its intentionally and a nice twist to cut the sweeter red malt and to balance the fruity middle of this. its a red beer with a lot of character, rusty in color, clear as they come, and nice and frothy. there is a pretty decent hop profile on it too, english or german bittering varietals primarily, and i find this to be a rather authentic take on the style overall. a quicker finish for a red beer too, which i like. medium bodied and very robustly carbonated, it drinks a little lighter than it is. not the most remarkable brew in the box, but i must say i enjoyed this interpretation of altbier very well. maybe next year they will do more exciting stuff with styles, but this year i am thankful just for the opportunity to drink some cool new stuff, even if it is a little weak on the adventurous scale."
""
""
""

"O) Another really solid, although not spectacular Beer Camp offering. I'd definitely drink another bottle if I had one on hand. Glad to recommend."
""
""
""
"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, caramel, and slight citrus zest aromas. Taste is much the same with malt, earth, and citrus zest flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a fairly surprising amount of hoppiness to go along with the malt characteristics."
"appearance is dark brown with hues of dark chocolate, copper, and clear at the bottom. Smell is raisin, grain, plum, pine, and bitter chocolate. Head is memorable, with it sticking around and lending a nice creaminess throughout. The taste is light fruit, slightly sweet, malt and hops on the finish. Getting a little roast, but not much, more hops and carmel Balance, in malt, hops, sweetness, and crisp-dry finish, with some decent carbonation present. mouthfeel is light, and sweet fruit taste, with some hop presence throughout on this beer. Overall, would like to see more examples, since the balance of flavors, and a decent amount of hops, lends to a versatile beer. Pairs good with most German, BBQ, pot-roast. blue cheese, gorgonzola, muenster."
""
"Another beer that I can't specifically find any fault with, but which doesn't seem very appealing or drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"O- There's not a lot of balance in this beer. The alcohol is too prevalent without there being a sweetness to offset the strength and the hop bitterness is a bit too overbearing surprisingly enough. One of the duds of the variety pack."
""
""
""
"Interesting choice for both breweries. The appearance was a light brown almost with a nice cream head. The smell was mostly from hops with citrus and floral notes coming through the strongest for me. The taste was nice in the beginning with heavy malt flavors but then were overpowered by the hops to make a very crisp yet bitter finish. The mouthfeel was also good with being a nice heavy beer. Overall, not my favorite out of beer camp, but I know tons of people who would love this beer if they got their hands on it."
"Too bitter for an Altbier. The hops are covering up what would otherwise be a nice malt profile."
""
""
"o: flavor in this is good. it doesn't quite follow the aroma, but thats ok. flavor is definitely more spiced than the aroma - my criticism would be i would have liked a little more brown sugar in the flavor to smooth it out a bit. still, its tasty, but the mixture of spice and alcohol is a little harsh without some more sweetness to cut it"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"pours into a becker a deep bronze with a half finger white head that's gone pretty quickly.Sweeter aromas than my for the style with caramel and brown sugar with some roasted nuts present as well,some spicy hop becoming more present as it warms.Caramel and mild cookie dough flavors at the onset along with brown sugar, a nice drying more spicy than citrusy hop finish lingers nicely.I thought at first this was a little sweet but the spicy hops really cut thru the sweetness nicely in the finish,solid."
""
""
"Overall - Hmm. So much flavor opportunity available in the style, and they deliver a rather bland alt. Swing and a miss. Easily the worst of the SNBCAA mix pack."
""
"Not the best, but sometimes light and clean isn't all that bad."
""
"Overall, I'd have to say I'm not a fan of altbiers."
""
"12 ounce bottle, part of the Beer Camp Across America 12-pack. Served in a stange/altbier glass, the beer pours an orange/copper/brown color with an inch frothy light tan head that stayed around for a long time. There's also a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like caramel malt, dark fruit (raisins), bready/sweet malt and some light herbal hops. It tastes like caramel and bready malt, raisins, candied oranges, herbal hops, orange peel and a bit of nuttiness. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with moderate carbonation. I thought this was a good brew, definitely worth a try!"

"As to what's in the glass, it's an Alt, alright; maybe a bit big, but it hits the right notes to me. Nice aroma of creamy malt, but there's a freshness from the hops, slightly citrusy with an herbal and/or vanilla note, to provide a light counterpart. The palate is all toasted pumpernickel and caramel, but it finishes dry and surprisingly bitter. The toasty malt lingers a very long time. It may not be the most exciting of styles, but they did a very nice job while putting their own spin on it. The more I drink this one, the more I like it."
""
""
"Clear mahogany/amber pour with a small off-white head. Aroma is earthy with some light floral notes. Medium body has a really nice caramel malt flavor upfront backed by a spicy and astringent bitterness. Can also taste some bread and spice. Finishes with a spicy bitterness."

"Overall 3.75: I am not that familiar with the altbier stye, but my thinking is that this attempt to produce one in the style has a bit too much hops. Still, this is a very good beer, very refreshing and slightly smoky with a cloying sweetness that is appealing. Recommended!"

"Sienna-coppery brew with a tight khaki foam. Smells of caramel, sweet malt and bread. Taste is crisp and lightly bitter, citrus flavor folding into lightly sweet malt almost chocolaty. A wash of tartness almost lemony. Good balance isn't sweet. Medium body. Solid carbonation keeps it interesting. I enjoyed the citrus and malt interplay in this zestily carbonated beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Above average to good, but mostly good. A fair representation of the style and a beer I would recommend trying. It also makes me interested to try Victory's regular altbier."

"Not as nutty as the German originals, but the appearance and influence of hops probably has something to do with that. A little bit lighter in color also (dark amber) with a small skin of a head, malts find their way out from under the hops, very dry finish."
""

"Poured into an Euler stange. Pours a nice red coppery amber with a one finger khaki head with good retention and lacing. Unusual aroma of sweet malt and floral hops, not quite what I expected or like anything else I've had; intriguing. Flavor is drier biscuit malt with only hints of caramel, light rye and fruit sourness, with grassy, mildly citrus hops that linger into a spicy, mildly herbal hop finish with dark bread and rye. Light to medium bodied with active carbonation. Not a traditional altbier, although the basic darker biscuit malt, light fruitiness, hops and basic dryness are present. There is a rye-like mild tartness and flavor although there is apparently no rye in this brew. As a rye fan, this is no distraction. An idiosyncratic, but nice take on a altbier. The somewhat more aggressive hops, expected from Victory, work well here. I liked this a lot and as my first beer from the pack, a very positive start."
