"Pours a dark copper amber with a large lasting creamy beige head. Aroma and taste is of toasted caramel malt and grains, some grass notes, mildly fruity with a bitter finish on the end. Palate is a medium body with good carbonation. The finish is the same as taste with a good sweet toasted caramel malt and nutty flavor and a bitter ending for balance. Nothing really standout but overall a good drinking brew."

"Taste is very toasty, lightly caramelly, with nice earthy-leafy hop bitterness, a bit peppery, balanced with light sweetness but just dominating."

"Overall, a mild, subdued amber ale, easy to drink, no off flavors."

"O: Nothing to crazy here. Very easy drinking, could easily drink a few of these."

"An agreeable enough amber ale, of the decidedly American bent. The issue here, I propose, is the lack of actual German heritage, or at least a strict adherence to such. Altbiers have a sort of crisp, unassuming nature to them - this approaches that, but doesn't really follow through. Good, but not the 'goodest' - to mangle a now stale Colbert Nation trope."

"Nice altbier. Drinks like a hearty mid-season brew."
"technically an altbier, I already like this because we need more of these in the usa. however, this one is less than stellar. brick red with a decent off white head and decent carbonation. im picking up aromas of dry red malt, german caramel grains, and the aroma of a well toasted everything bagel. the flavor is pleasantly not sweet at all. the grains come through a little stale, and there needs to be some more hops so balance things out, but the dryness and relative lack of residual sugar for the style is a welcomed respite from the droves of sugary reds out there today. a nice almost oaty smoothness to this, but the carbonation dies a little and the beer gets a tad heavy for that reason. the finish is the best part, clean and dry, but still full of flavor, exactly as the style dictates. its not a flawless alt by any stretch, but this is a step in the right direction for American brewers. now that ive covered the basic mission lineup, I think they are a little all over the place, but might be on to something with their slight twists on mass appeal styles. I will keep checking out their beers as they come in."

"Overall sessionable but forgettable this beer was decent."

"Thankfully, this would make for a good session beer as there wasn't a lot of alcohol here and this went down easily. While not the best offering from Mission, this is worth a go once since more examples of this style need to be on store shelves. Just don't look for anything deep or fancy here."

"Glowing amber when held toward the light, a bit darker than the average amber, labeled as a Dusseldorf style altbier. Forms a light beige head, thicket with fine speckled lacing across the sides of my glass. Aroma has a pleasant fruitiness/grapes/roasted malts with spicy earthy/herbal hops going on as well. Toasted Vienna malts stand out and really bring to mind a good Vienna style lager. Tastes leaves a bit to be desired, a bit of harsh grain husks, dry finish, not enough malts shine through, with a bit of nutty earthiness making things pretty bitter and almost off putting. So far, I can deal with it but it's way to hopped up, earthy dirty hop profile muddles the whole malt experience in this beer. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh with hop oils/bitterness on the palate lingering, not as crisp as I would like. Carbonation is solid medium bodied alt style bier from SoCal. Good stuff, enjoyable brew I'm liking more as it warms up take your time with this one."

"O: Not a whole lot going on with this Amber. Not nearly as expressive as I'd like, though if I was looking to crush a sixer, I guess this would do. Not bad, just not all that great."
""
"Overall pretty good, much better than the blonde IMO, this brings a nice malt profile with a nice hop kick balanced well, a dry not sticky finish with a big bitter ramp up and light acidic bite that surprisingly makes my mouth water when the sip is gone."

"On tap at the brewery's Skid Row location in San Diego."

"Short, dry finish. Clean drinking. Slightly creamy, very smooth, low-medium carbonation. Nice but a little bland."
"Very average fare in my opinion comes off heavy handed in both the malts and hops, neither of which were handled very pleasantly. It was much more drinkable warm as the plastics fade. An affordable session beer if you like ESBs and medicinal hops."
""
"D- drinkable just not that exciting."
""
""
"Overall: A good hoppy amber. I'm told the beer isn't always this hoppy, but it's damn enjoyable."
""
"O: Not quite what I expected. Not necessarily a bad thing, but this came off as an ESB, which I am too fond of. That said, it's got something to offer and is quite drinkable, but I think I'd pass on this one in the future."
"Clear coppery amber with a beige cap that was a combination of fine and soapy bubbles. Good head retention with clumpy and streaky lacing. Malty aroma, not overly sweet though, with some toast and biscuit, grain, and faint herbal hops. Clean flavour with moderate bitterness (started out soft, but was sharper in the finish). More toast and biscuit with light caramel sweetness, slightly grassy with a hint of lemony citrus. Medium bodied with carbonation a bit higher than average, a bit dry with slight astringency. Very fresh tasting and quite drinkable. It's nice to see a someone take a (successful) stab at a less popular style."
"A pretty good everyday beer. Probably wouldn't buy it again, though."
"Flavor is again clean and smooth, albeit with a notable hop spice character which delivers some unexpected body. Some nutty caramel notes up front segue to a subtle orange citrus character on the finish and a touch of smoke. Offers a touch of spice and a moderately lingering finish as the pour warms. Nicely done and with a well placed level of carbonation."
"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is super-foamy. Pours a bright, crystal clear, pinkish-toned copper coloring with an off-white head that is big bubbled and lightly packed, and finally settles into about half an inch. Slightly sweet and sour caramel malt smells on the nose. The taste has the same caramel characteristics, but also a smokey tone that blends well with the sweet flavors. Very malty, but not overly sweet. The beer is dry and crisp, and the aftertaste again has that slight smoked quality to it. Very interesting. The finish lingers a bit with the caramel flavors. Nothing really outstanding about this one, but nothing overly disappointing, either."
"D: Overall, a good attempt, but it could use some improvement. I don't think I'll be rushing to try their other beers anytime soon."
"A pretty tasty, albiet kind of boring, Altbier."
"Poured into a imperial pint glass a clear deep amber/bronze with a thinner but well defined white head.Aromas os sweet dough with some light toastiness,a faint earthy hoppiness compliments the sweet element pretty well.The palate is pretty straight forward with lightly sweet doughiness standing out,not mush hop presence but there is a decent drying in the finish.A no frills malt tilted alt,pretty true to style just not anything spectacular."
"Amber-brown colour from the pour with a slight haze, and off-white head is generous and retains nicely. Nose has some toasty/biscuity aromas. On the palate there's a pleasant one-two punch of caramelly malt sweetness followed by bitterness from the hops. More of the toasty/biscuity comes through on the palate as well. Medium bodied and rather sessionable."
"D: Okay, but not great. I would not order another or buy this again."
"Not bad stuff overall, but nothing memorable. I'd like to try some of the brewery's other offerings."
"This was decent. A bit more beef would have been welcome in the body but for the most part this was a flavorful and easy drinking Alt."
"Good beer ok taste but mouthfeel ruined it for me."
"In the end, Mission Amber is a respectable altbier that I probably won't think about again once this review is in the books. Kudos to the brewery for trying something different rather than rounding out their lineup with yet another American amber ale."
"Not sure if this is really an Altbier or not. My reference beer for this beer type is Alaskan Amber and it is frankly better than this."
"Medium full body with high drinkability due to the relatively low ABV. The alcohol is hidden in every aspect. Overall a solid brew in a unique style that I definetly recommend."
