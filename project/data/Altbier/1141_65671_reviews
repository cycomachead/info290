"Overall meh."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Quite good but not as spectacular as other beers from this brewery (Disco Soleil, Rose d'Hisbiscus, Moralité). Still, this is a decent altbier."

"Malty nose, heavy body, hoppy taste, light bitterness."
""

"Quite a tasty alt and quite drinkable, pronounced yeasty character that coats the palate toward the finish. Perhaps the start could be lightened a bit as the caramel gets a bit heavy, otherwise a flavourful session ale, but far short of my favourite from this brewery, still quite tasty and impressive."

"Would have it if offered to me; if you have the chance to choose among their beers, there are better ones, though IMO. (3.5)"

"O: A good beer overall and i'd love to pair some mexican food with it."

"Overall - A very good example of a well balanced Altbier... well worth a try..."

"A very drinkable altbier. Lots of complexity and very nice roasted malt taste."

"Overall, not quite my style, but flavourful and enjoyable."

"A bit hard to find altbiers around here, this example from Quebec pours a coppery gold with ample off white foam. Aroma is tangy, fruity, sweet, some peppery coriander and nutmeg like notes although there is no such spice in the beer. Palate starts with pretty big burnt caramel malts, with toast and dark bread crust, fairly impressive bitter spicy hops relative to others of this style. Initially I had a bit of trouble getting past the malts up front to catch other flavor elements but as things progressed I started to get some vinous fruit, sour gummy candy, a bit of yeasty dankness, spicy root cellar and more bitterness at the end, perhaps some metal like sucking on a coin. Its sweet as well but this is less obvious at first. An interesting array of tastes that unfolds as you go: Have two or three and you'll probably notice different things each time, with the malts in control for one bottle and more fruit and hops in the next. Not too shabby and intriguing if you want to pay close attention for a session."

"Overall: An interesting brew that just doesn't cut for me. As a whole it's pretty average. I think this would work a lot better if it was a bit fuller."
""
"Enjoyable session ale. Mild malt, hops, flavour. Neat label on bottles as per, price point for the style great. Nice head retention as will most of there beers most likely a torrified wheat added to the malt. Goes down very easy, hop note on initial tastes as well as after finish. Would buy again."

"Overall- A nice altbier by DDC. I enjoyed the dark fruit flavours with the punch of herbal hops. I find this quite sessionable. Again, DDC doesn't disappoint."
""
"Pours a deep reddish brown color with a thick off white head that quickly dissipates to stray bubbles on the top. The aroma is very malty with lots of dark sugars and caramel. Sweet candy hints of light sweet fruit and some earthy and herbal hops round out the nose nicely. The flavor is malty up front with a lot of the sweetness from the aroma. The sweet is cut with a spicy earthy hop bite as well as a bit of a mineral type flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet bubbly sharp mineral mouthfeel. This smells great! The flavor is a bit harsher with a mineral water thing going on that is slightly unpleasant."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas."
"DDC GIVES a part of profits for société de la faune du Québec."

"Overall a real solid altbier here. Delicious."
""
"This is a great Altbier from a great brewery. Hoppier than I was expecting."
""
"O - This was a very pleasant surprise, as I was not expecting much from it (despite it being brewed by DDC). Certainly very sessionable! This beer isn't too crazy, not boring - just good!"
""
""
"I am a fan of this. It drinks very easily and is very smooth but still brings a nice variety of flavor to the table. I gotta learn how to brew something like this because it might be a long time until I get more of this."

"Pretty solid Alt - nicely balanced with lots of character."
""
"O: Nice, this is just as modest and nice as I like my Altbiers."
"Pours a deep ruby red hue which leaves a two finger fluffy head and sporadic lacing,the smell is brandy,sweet caramel malts,fresh baked bread and raisins,the mouthfeel is light bodied and has tastes of raisins,sweet malts,sticky caramel,herbal hops and finished with a sweet bitter dryness and overall its a nice ALT but not my favourite cheers."
"Carbonation is a bit full-on."
"A nice, crisp malty, bitter ale. Plenty of flavour and a unique take on the altbier."
"Overall - I've never had an altbier before, but it tastes pretty good. Flavorful. Gets the most out of the malt flavor without upping the ABV. Very nice."
"Pours a reddish marroon, a dense and creamy dusty offwhite head sits atop. Fantastic retention and lacing. Nose holds a rich toffee malt, spice, some woody notes (tree bark?). More earthy notes with some subtle smoke. Taste has big wooden and earthy malt flavours, toffee notes, with some light spicing and grass in the finish. Light bitterness in the mouthfeel, but the earthy malts prevail and dominate lending some good full sweetness. Medium carbonation and easily drinkable. Very nice for the style, something I could easily revisit."
"Poured a amber-brown color w/ two-finger head that died slow and left lace down the glass on top of a somewhat hoppy, somewhat sweet and bready malt aroma. A smooth, somewhat creamy body that has a touch of spicy hops balanced w/ some minor sweet caramel and breadlike malts. A little dry and crisp in the backbite for a nice finish (also some high carbonation notes). An enjoyable and easy to drink beer."
"Drink (4/5) - sessionability is about like a bock, so not too high. But it was very tasty!"
"Creamy flavor that reminds me of well-hopped porter. Has strong English ale elements--good caramel flavor, but the beer is not sweet. Full, round body with a decent dose of bubbles."
"Amber brown colour, mild white head with some lace left behind. Smell is malty with notes of caramel, sweet notes, lightly nutty and slight bitterness as well. Taste is all malt, caramel, sweet in the finish, lots of malt in finish and aftertaste as well. Mouthfeel is syrupy, big feel to this brew, nice medium carbonation. Pretty good, not fantastic for the style but still quite good."
"O/D - Didn't knock my socks off but I enjoyed it. Easy to drink and full of flavour. A little heavy to session but a nice one for DDCs standard releases."
"Medium body. So easy to drink. A session beer. A good one too. Very accessible."
"A decent enough New World melding of Yankee red ale and German altbier, but a tad tight, at times, I'm afraid. I will, however, raise the remainder of this glass to my 11 cents' worth of contribution to the recovery of Quebecois ursine species. Because wolverines be rockin', yo?"
"A pretty easy drinking beer that pleases overall. Not particularly true to style which is not necessarily bad but it stil has a few overall flaws, balance issues."
"DO: A good drinker and overall decent brew. I like it, but it's sort of a bigger/american interpretation of the style."
"O: Good flavours overall, clearly to style, nice to see a North American alt of this quality."
"Not fully on par with a typical Alt, but a very fine beer of its own accord and well crafted. Worth checking out at least once."
"Overall - Lots of different tastes going on with this beer.. It is quite complex yet very easy to drink. I am rarely disappointed with Dieu Du Ciel and I'd drink this beer again for sure."
"O - I'm really digging the altbier style, as they seem to possess very bold flavours, yet they are easily drinkable. Highly recommended ale and definitely worth grabbing a bottle if you can."
"I wouldn't characterize this as ""delicate", but overall this was fairly enjoyable. I would probably drink it more as a meal accompaniment instead of a session beer."
"D - DDC never fails to put out unique and tasty beers, this is very smooth and balanced, a warm and cozy drink"
"D: Another pleasing beer by DDC. From what I read from papat, I am glad that this replaced Fum..."
"Overall: Really easy to drink if you don't mind a bit of an edge. Let this warm up as more layers of flavor become apparent."
"I'm happy I have a 6er of this one perhaps after another 5 I'll have figured this one out a bit better. Now that I think about it perhaps I should review one of the bottles a little deeper in the box but what can you do"
"At 5% ABV I would enjoy drinking a few of these. Nice to see a solid example of a German style from DDC, and a drinkable one at that."
"Pours an amber-brown colour with a finger of white head. Some lacing down the glass, ok head retention. Smells of floral hops with toasted malt and caramel. Fairly sweet flavour for the style, mild bitterness does come through though. A little bit thin body, but smooth enough mouthfeel. Another nice beer from Dieu Du Ciel, but not one of my favourites from them."
"Bottle: Poured a clear dark brown color alt with a nice large frothy head with good retention and some retention. Aroma of biscuit malt is well balance with light residual sugar. Taste is also a well balance mix with some biscuit malt with great notes of caramelized malt with light residual sugar notes and light bready yeast notes. Body is quite full with a very solid malt backbone and good carbonation. Very well brewed for style and something I will have more then once."
"Thanks Fred."
"SMD"
"Really German in the feel, smell and taste."
"Will buy it again but I'm in no hurry."
