"First thoughts, wow this thing is dark for an Alt which in my opinion is a style of beer that often goes overlooked here in the states. The only thing I am sitting here wondering about is if Victor's Memoriale is really an Altbier, why did I get so much yeast flocculated in the dregs of the bottle? Enough nitpicking though, this beer is delicious and deceptively strong...really creeps up on you with that last sip."

"Overall: Two Brothers does it again…this is a great ale…the flavor is dynamic and well rounded…I know that there’s a bit higher ABV here, but it’s not overly dominate like some in this range…malts and hops balance so nicely…this beer is absolutely perfect while watching Tom Brady do his thing versus, well, anybody…great beer, hope I find another before it’s gone…(4/5)"
"O: Consistent from start to finish. This was truly one of the highlights of my holiday vacation, therefore, I went next door to a local wine shop and grabbed a bottle to bring back to DC to share at a future tasting."

"I haven't explored the altbier style much, so thought I'd give this one a go. It is smooth, balanced, easy drinking and has some flavor. I think it is pretty well to-style. It is definitely not complex or boundary pushing. But it is a tasty, balanced, well made beer."
"As it warms, the toasted malt character becomes more dominant, to its advantage."
"Beer is medium to medium-heavy in body, with moderate to moderate-light carbonation. The resulting mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, with just enough carbonic pep to make this move across the palate smoothly and easily. Closes rather dry, with substantial stickiness around the lips."
"Not as good as the Sticke brews from Germany, but it is close. Very well done."

"I wanna see if we can get a count of the number of new portmanteau words coined by brewers over the years for their beers' names... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear deep garnet topped by a finger-and-a-half of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises earthy greens, toffee, tea, and a kiss of clove. The taste holds notes of light tea, dry caramel, light earthy greens, light brown sugar, minerals, and a splash of cola. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, this was a pretty enjoyable alt, though it did at times come to resemble a dark mild that had been mixed with a cola. Still, not a bad combination in practice..."
"22oz bomber poured into a 25oz snifter is darker than expected - dark, dark brown and opaque topped with a bubbly ivory head that holds excellent retention and leaves good lacing on the glass. Aromas are fruity, malty, woodsy. Tastes are pleasantly complex with notes of dark fruits, plum, rich dark malt (but not roasted), apple, earthy, tobacco, tea leaf, faint anise and toffee. Mouth-feel is velvety smooth, creamy, nice carbonation allowing flavors to meld on the palate. Overall, I really enjoyed this one for its uniqueness. I wish this was a year rounder - or at least a seasonal offering. Very well crafted!"
"Found a bottle of this in Indianapolis...no date on the bottle, so I have no idea how old it is...yeah....overprimed....smelled like fermented milk...the appearance was nice very dark with red hughes....tasted awful. Perhaps it was good when fresh....but nasty now!"

"What I would like to drink on a farm after a hard day."
"F: Pretty bitter on the finish, with more earthy spicy hops. Pretty dry but maintains a good malty sweetness feel and a slight syrupy feel. The sour flavors linger only long enough for the long bitterness to seem to take over and ride out the finish."
"D: This is a good beer. I enjoy drinking the brothers Ebel's brews."
"Great ruby amber color beneath a nice two finger head that slowly recedes to nothing. You can barely see the bubbles in this dark ruby beer. The aroma is an awesome fruity, nutty, toasted malt extavaganza! The taste starts with a toasted plum with maybe some brown sugar. The middle mixes in some hazelnuts that move to very grainy but still pleasantly sweet. Nice mouthfeel that is grainy sweet and very well carbonated. Great integration ofthe abv. too. A session beer in flavor and palate. But the abv. makes that pretty unadvisable."
"This is my favorite alt style beer to date. It's a relatively straight forward beer that can be sipped or sessioned."
"I was blown away by this overall. I think I may have found my new favorite style. One of the easiest drinking, most complex beers I have had in years. Hands down this was great."
"Dark reddish-brown color, with a minimal tan head. Aroma is nice, with caramal, chocolate and dark dried fruits dominant. The taste was more roasted than the smell, with a fair hop balance mainly in the background. There is a bit of an alcohol taste in the finish but it isn't overpowering. All in all a very solid beer, though I wouldn't want to drink several of them on a hot summer's night! Would like to see how this one does after being sat down for about 12-18 months."
"Drinkability: A great beer for a cooler day, I was excited to try and consumed on a warmer day. The roasted notes and thick mouthfeel were a bit much for summer in chicago. i def. want some of these around for fall and will be putting a few away for a nice cool day of watching college football."
"Poured from a 22oz bomber and served in a shaker. This beer poured a deep, dark, mahogany brown hue with a thin head of tan foam that quickly faded into a lasting ring. Some clingy lace was left around the glass. The aroma of the beer was made up of toasted caramel, light chocolate, brown sugar, and some fruit. The flavor consisted of bittersweet chocolate, lightly bitter roasted malts, caramelized sugar, dark fruits, and a bit of alcohol. The mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied with minimal carbonation. Different and a little unusual. Way over the top for the style, but that's what the brewer intended."
"This is my first altbier so I didn't really no what to expect from the style, but this one is a well crafted, tasty, enjoyable brew."
"Very light feeling despite it's robust flavor profile. Easy to drink, something I could have once in a while. One bomber is the perfect serving size."
"Pours a dark mahogony with a full one finger khaki colored head that leaves a decent amount of lacing behind. Smell is a musty oak and new leather scent. Hints of caramel malt and some dark fruits in the nose as well. There also seems to be a bit of pepper and spice too. Taste is very similar to the aroma. Sweet potato flavor up front with molasses on the tongue as well. A tiny bit of alcohol finds its way in the flavor but doesn't take away from the overall complexity. Leather makes another appearance in the taste with an almost almond like nuttiness in the aftertaste. Somewhat slick feel with a medium body. Warming alchol flavor towards the end. Such an interesting brew. With the few I've had of this style, this one is easily the best. Glad I had the opportunity to try this one, hopefully more breweries will attempt this style."
"Drinkability: I unfortunately only picked up one bomber of this while in Illinois, and am now disappointed I didn't get more. A great, flavorful beer I could drink all the time."
"A deep blackish brown body yeilds a ruby glow on the edges when held to light. Head is a two finger perfect tan that leaves thick frothy lace. Nice wheat and malt balances dance with a hint of sweetness and dark fruit on the nose. As it hits the tongue you get a very rich malt backboned beer. Smokey feel is even and well balanced with slight rich sweetness. This beer drinks very easy with nice character. Mouthfeel is very thick and glazing. Meaty rich and long on the mouth which translates well into the overall taste. Nutty and burnt biscuit like notes do also develop as you enjoy this one. A success of a beer in a tough time for the brewers."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, some carbonation, tiny fizzy head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is mostly malts/caramel, and some toffee/vanilla. The taste is very nice, malty, a nice little sweetness, nice touch of caramel, toffee, and vanilla. Medium body. Very drinkable, this one goes down real smooth, highly recommended."
"Victor's MemoriAle Altbier can't touch the excellence of the Uerige altbiers, but it's one of the best American alts that I've ever had. Only Heavyweight Stickenjab (R.I.P.) and Victory Ten Years Alt can compare. This is a worthy member of the Two Brothers Artisan Beer series and was well worth the price of admission."
"D/notes: I think attenuation is the big issue here. Those strong flavor characteristics need some more alone time and a reduction in sweetness would help in terms of drinkability."
"The beer poured a cola-brown color with a tan, long-lasting head. Great biscuity malt aroma and flavor, with just enough hops and roast grain bitterness to balance. The dryness helped offset the weight that must have gone along with all that malt, making it an easy drinker out in the summer heat and sun. No idea that it was nearly 8% ABV until I looked at the stats on the beer here before I posted. Maybe if there's enough of an outcry we can get Jason to brew this one again like we did with Cane & Ebel."
"Last swigs: A porter meets altbier, but an altbier in the end. Now if I could only remember where this bottle came from? Clocking in at 7.8% ABV is impressive."
"D: The full mouthfeel and higher abv leave me content with the one bomber that I have. The bier is quite good however, a must-see for fans of the alt style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head over the clear burgundy brew. Head holds well, with ample lacing. Aroma is lightly of dark malty and fruitiness. Taste starts with fruity roastiness, goes a bit dry in the middle, and closes with hints of hoppiness. As it warms, the nuttiness comes out and balances the fruit well. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both okay, but this one just doesn't come together well for me. The late arrival nuttiness helps though."
"The taste is molasses and more dark malts with a somewhat nutty finish. Reminds me of hazelnuts and almonds. Unfortunately its not too drinkable with this high ABV and resultant sticky sweetness. Still one of the better Alts Ive tried. Very Good !!!"
"This is a tasty, well balanced beer. Reminds me of a Belgian Dubble. I thought the appearance was a bit flat and mouthfeel a little thin. Otherwise a great brew."
"Drinkability - very nice; a new style for me. I'll be out on the hunt for the next opportunity for this. The 7.8% is hidden from the"
"One of the best alts I've had. Very well done!"
"Pours a hazy brown, some red highlights, thin tan head, nice lacing, settles to a ring. Smell is malty, toffee, bread, some iron, dark fruits, minor roast, yeast, neat. Taste is very malty, roast, toffee, some fruits, bread, bit of chocolate, solid bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, low carbonation, alcohol is well hidden, shows itself as some fruitiness. Nice shot at doing an 8% altbier, this works pretty well. Doesn't come across as too big for the style."
"D: This is a very refreshing beer."
"Mouthfeel is super with just the right level of carbonation and thickness to balance each other out. As previously noted, ABV isn't apparent making this a deadly drinkable beer. The Ebels appear to be the real deal; if they were to focus solely on the beers that make up their seasonal/artisan roster I have little doubt they could become a phenomenon."
"Quite dark brown with a deceent head, but one that dissipates quickly. There are aromas of rye, an undefined graininess, mint, and some sweet maltiness toward the end. Really nice flavors here with lightly toasted grain, some bitter hops in the background, and some nice bubblegum flavors on the finish. The mouthfeel has good body, but its a little grainy and perhaps a tad heavy for the style. Very drinkable, just delicious. In the U.S., just rivaled by the 10 year alt from Victory."
"It pours a coffee brown with a very minimal head (less than a cm). Aroma is light, pleasant, and toffee-ish. Flavor is slightly sour and heavily caramel-y...more like a bock than I expected. The sourness seems slightly off to me, and I must say that the mouthfeel is over-carbonated, which is odd given the small amount of head when I poured it. This beer is also sticky in your mouth, which in my opinion is consistent with the style. Still, I must say i was a bit disappointed with the flavor of this beer."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, but this beer is fairly easy to drink. It's worth a try."
"Nice alt. Very drinkable. Smooth as a whistle and not as chewy as I like my alts. Again there is the cola, with a tobacco hint. Some dates as well as prune. Dark yeasy breads. Lacking depth of mouthfeel but has a finesse too it that is unmatched."
"This one pours a nice medium to dark brown. Purists would say it's too dark; they would probably also call this a dopplesticke, as it is rather strong. I didn't get much a head with my pour, but what foam was generated seem to last, leaving some thick lace. The body is just about right, medium, with a smooth as satin mouthfeel. The malt flavor seems predominant with burnt caramel and hints of chocolate and coffee (just little bits though). The bitterness at the finish is solid and nicely assertive. Overall, one of the Two Brothers best offerings so far."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with a slightly oily feel. Medium carbonation. I have really enjoyed every Two Brothers beer I have tried. Good stuff."
"A great, great beer."
"Mahogany. Perfectly clear mahogany. Brilliant looking. Bubbly beige head leaves nice rings of lace. Nice whiff of malt and hops. Toffee blends with a little nougat like maltiness and caramel on the nose with a backdrop of slight minty hops. Good nose. The taste up front is that of toffee and nuts and caramel and nougat. Even with the 34 IBUs, this is a malt dominated beer. And that's not a bad thing either. The hops add balance to this beer and a little dryness to the finish. Somewhat velvety mouthfeel. Medium-full body. At 7.8% a/v, this is quite a hefty alt. Sticke like in strength and texture. Not quite as good as Uerige, but this stuff is pretty damn good."
"Mouthfeel is great. Wonderful medium body and smooth carbonation. This one goes down incredibly easy and is quite refreshing. An intensely tasty, big altbier...I could get myself into trouble drinking this one I imagine. I'm sitting here kicking myself for only buying one bottle, it's time to go pick up some more. One of the best altbiers I have ever sampled. Cheers to the memory of Victor and everyone at Two Brothers...keep 'em coming!"
"Drinkability - this is a very good beer, very hearty, very solid. High abv limits the sessionability."
"Overall: I'm thrilled to see an American craft brewer attempting a Sticke Altbier. While I've only had a few other varietals (and I'm using Zum Uerige as the standard), this seems a bit too malty to fit the style. A more pronounced noble hop presence along with a slightly thinner body would put this in the same league as anything from Duesseldorf. Style guidelines aside, the beer is delicious. I would almost categorize it as an ale equivalent of a Doppelbock. It's not going to displace Zum Uerige Sticke in my cellar, but a wonderful offering in its own right."
"A very drinkable brew that belies its 7.8% abv"
"D- This beer has a smooth but light flavor. Even though it has a nice malt quality there isn't much depth."
