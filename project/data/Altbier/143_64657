Taste: more hops than malts, but the malts show up late--not a big-tasting ale at all... Overall: Alts are always an odd tweener--thee hybrid linebacker of the beer world--and this one is representative, with an Oktoberfest/Munchen flavor and a freshness that throws some ale weight into it....","dacrza1","May 19, 2012"

Nose was very biscuit malty with hints of dark fruit. Mouthfeel was very full, creamy and smooth. The initial taste was of fresh bread, followed by a molasses tartness and then a gentle grassy hoppiness. This was as pleasant a drink as I have had in a while and I could easily see why they would take pride in it.

Good head retention. Aroma is nice and malty with lots of caramel sweetness. Hops are well-hidden. A very drinkable beer - smooth, toasted malts; sweet but with a nice touch of bitterness. A solid, well-balanced beer. Shiner should sell this one in its own six pack.","goldbot","Jul 10, 2011"

Bit of toffee on the nose along with a faint hop aroma. More of the same on the palate, this beer has pretty distinct front, mid and finish, with nice hop bitterness bringing up the rear. The carbonation is nice and creamy, I really like the mouthfeel. A beer that goes down easy, but has enough going on to keep you interested even after having a couple. Also, this is the first Alt I have had in a really long time, and right now I am wondering why that is...","BeerAmbassador","Jul 02, 2011"

2.89,-20.4,2.5,3.5,2.5,4,2.5,"Picked this one up in a mixer sixer from Shiner. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is clear medium golden color which looks similar to apple juice and an off-white soapy head. The nose is a mix of fruity malt and citrus notes. The taste is similar with sweet fruity maltiness intertwined with a citrusy hop presence; there is also an off putting bitter, buttery finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full in body with a creamy, inactive carbonation. Overall, not really impressive or remarkable, won't be searching this out in the future but wouldn't turn it down if someone gave it to me.","gmfessen","Jun 05, 2011"

The taste is also quite fruity, but there is some graininess to balance and a bit of herbal hops as well. More of that banana in the finish. This is actually fairly tasty. It doesn't have the bite that you usually find in an alt, and it isn't quite as dry either, but it's still relatively crisp and the fruitiness is quite pleasant.

4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall: The best brew in the Shiner mixed 6 pack. Thoroughly enjoyable, too bad they don't make it available on its own.","MadCat","May 25, 2011"
3.53,-2.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"O: Again, this isn't a complex beer but it's a good selection. Straightforward malt and hop combo","brewemstrong","May 23, 2011"

2.92,-19.6,3,3.5,2.5,3,3,"D: Hard for me to drink - the herbal taste/smell is almost medicinal and I felt it was overcarbed too. Despite being very thin and low ABV I didn't find it particularly drinkable.","Dope","May 19, 2011"
3.97,9.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall-First beer out of the mixed 6 and impressed. Very nice beer that is sessionable and highly drinkable.","SWMeyer4141","May 18, 2011"
3.13,-13.8,3,2.5,3.5,2.5,3.5,"D/O - Drinkability is pretty easy, and its a decent Altbier. It's worry a revisit while it's around, but I likely won't.","EgadBananas","May 17, 2011"
3.88,6.9,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Nicely balanced and very easy-drinking and refreshing. One of Shiner's better offerings!","grittybrews","May 10, 2011"
3.43,-5.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"It has a kind of dark malty taste. Not much hops in either the taste or nose. I suppose it's right for the style, but the style has never been one of my favorites. I will try to avoid.","schoolboy","Apr 30, 2011"
2.88,-20.7,3,2.5,3,3,3,"This isn't a horrible beer, but my first batch homebrewed alt I made back in 94 was as good as or better than this. This is a light hearted attempt at the style at best","russpowell","Apr 29, 2011"
3.7,1.9,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall: A bit mild, as expected, but pretty decent. I drank it down. No, really, I did!","ChainGangGuy","Apr 25, 2011"
3.99,9.9,4.5,3,4.5,4,4,"O: Pleasantly surprised at the quality of this brew; was only disappointed in the lack of aroma. It would make a great six pack for the summer or spring. Nothing challenging here, but a great session beer.","videofrog","Apr 24, 2011"
4.05,11.6,4,4,4,4.5,4,"First ever beer from Shiner, I've always heard about it but never got the chance to give them a whirl. Interesting to see a pretty rare in the alt, but I definitely enjoy Otter Creek and Long Trail's versions. Pours a good looking light brown color, some great caramel notes on the tongue, nice solid mouthfeel, medium bodied. Nice and crisp and drinkable with a nice spiciness to it, really liked this one. Not too bad for only $11.99 for a mixed 12 pack.. psyched to try the rest!","oriolesfan4","Apr 19, 2011"
4,10.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Bubbly, patchy lacing has a nearly epic quality to it, and with a stunning, clear amber color, this brew ends up being a looker. Hints of caramel, taffy and spicy hops in the aroma. Oily hop feel and flavor; the solid medium body heavily brushes the palate with a smoothness. Bready maltiness flexes a bit; faintness of caramel and biscuit. Balance from the hops is sufficient, but the flavor just adds a greater quality to this brew. Clean, drinkable and interesting at that, as our palates continue to tell us that we would be able to quaff this beer all night long.","BeerAdvocate","Apr 06, 2011"
3.53,-2.8,4.5,4,3,4,3.5,"Poured into a Brit pint glass. One finger creamy off-white head that settles into a 1/2 finger cap that retains throughout drinking. Color is a deep copper-gold, clear with carbonation bubbles sprinkled throughout. Looks really nice. Aroma is a refreshing light pine-grapefruit atop slightly sour grass. The taste leaves me somewhat perplexed. It's refreshing and drinkable but what are the flavors? Initial spicy earthy hops quickly fades to mild citrus hops, mild earth hops, mild bready malt, not much sweetness, and pretty dry. Finishes with a long drying earthy-nutskin- popsicle stick fade.","atomicbeer","Mar 31, 2011"
3.57,-1.7,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"This one isn't bad. Drinks very easy, as it should. Good beer to sit and drink over.","Keffa","Feb 23, 2011"

3.51,-3.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Notes: Decent beer and representation of the style. Refreshing and nice to drink, but it is nothing that really excites me or entices me to drink more. Aroma is seriously lacking though. I'd have no problem drinking some more if given to me, but I probably won't seek it out.","FreshHawk","Jan 30, 2011"
3.98,9.6,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D - Very nicely balanced ale from Shiner. Light and easy drinker. Although it has its own taste, you can still tell that this is a Shiner product. I would love to see this as a six pack for the summertime.","beeragent","Jan 30, 2011"
3.38,-6.9,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"Drinkability: A solid beer overall and worth a try, though not spectacular. I'd have this again, but I can't say I'd go out of my way to drink it.","Mosstrooper","Jan 22, 2011"
3.06,-15.7,4,3,3,3,3,"I'm not familiar with this style beer, so I have no idea if alt biers typically are this sweet. All I know is that this beer is not really for me. I mean, it was good enough for one, but I'm not going to be rushing out to by another.","TheHoppiest","Jan 04, 2011"
3.91,7.7,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a transparent amber-red with a 1 finger head and nice lacing on the glass. Smells slightly metallic with a sweetness presented by the malt. Tastes more complex than the other Spoetzl brews-I perceived it as a brilliant upfront hoppy kick with sweetness settling in afterward-kind of opposite of most beers. Overall quite a delicious beer overall but could use a bit more malt backbone and more hops to really fill it out.","Beerbluesbiology","Jan 04, 2011"
3.11,-14.3,4,3,3,3.5,3,"Another new beer from Shiner that is decent, but nothing really worth seeking out. Still, it is a lot better than a lot of the other year-round beers made by Spoetzel.","Mora2000","Dec 31, 2010"
2.74,-24.5,4,2.5,2.5,3,3,"Welll. Poured with a nice fine, foamy, off white head that lasts and good lace. Color is a lovely garnet amber. Aroma was weird: skunk and funk. Flavor was totally different: more bitter than sweet, earthy. Like the commercial description. Body is a tad on the thin side. Carbonation is good. Finish is like flavor and rather long.","drpimento","Dec 28, 2010"
3.76,3.6,4,3,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, one of the 6 beers in Shiner's Family Reunion 6-pack. Served in a Stange/Altbier glass, the beer pours a clear orange/amber color with an inch and a half off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both good. Aroma is mostly toasted malt, along with some caramel and hops. The aroma is nice, but it's also weak. The brew tastes just like the aroma (but stronger), it's mostly toasted malt but also some caramel and hops are noticable. There's a nice lingering bitter grassy hop finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a little bit slick and is well carbonated. Drinkability is good, it sure goes down easy enough. I thought this brew was a pleasant surprise, I liked it.","bluejacket74","Dec 25, 2010"
3.41,-6.1,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - Quite drinkable, this isn't the best Alt out there, but it is a reasonable interpretation of the style. The aroma is a bit subdued with little to enjoy, but the flavor is very nice with lots of toast and some caramel to keep things interesting.","nickfl","Dec 22, 2010"
