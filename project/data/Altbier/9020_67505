Overall, it's a very refreshing summer brew. Taste reminds me of Alaskan Amber, both of which are like a crisper/better version of Newcastle. I'll probably share the rest of these this summer on the lake. Who knows, it may introduce some friends to good craft beer.","Swettenham_Shire","May 11, 2014"
