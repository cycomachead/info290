3.21,-7,3.75,3.25,3.25,3,3,"Pours a dark copper amber with a large lasting creamy beige head. Aroma and taste is of toasted caramel malt and grains, some grass notes, mildly fruity with a bitter finish on the end. Palate is a medium body with good carbonation. The finish is the same as taste with a good sweet toasted caramel malt and nutty flavor and a bitter ending for balance. Nothing really standout but overall a good drinking brew.","Samp01","Sep 13, 2014"

3.78,9.6,4.25,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.75,"An agreeable enough amber ale, of the decidedly American bent. The issue here, I propose, is the lack of actual German heritage, or at least a strict adherence to such. Altbiers have a sort of crisp, unassuming nature to them - this approaches that, but doesn't really follow through. Good, but not the 'goodest' - to mangle a now stale Colbert Nation trope.","biboergosum","0"

3.53,2.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,"technically an altbier, I already like this because we need more of these in the usa. however, this one is less than stellar. brick red with a decent off white head and decent carbonation. im picking up aromas of dry red malt, german caramel grains, and the aroma of a well toasted everything bagel. the flavor is pleasantly not sweet at all. the grains come through a little stale, and there needs to be some more hops so balance things out, but the dryness and relative lack of residual sugar for the style is a welcomed respite from the droves of sugary reds out there today. a nice almost oaty smoothness to this, but the carbonation dies a little and the beer gets a tad heavy for that reason. the finish is the best part, clean and dry, but still full of flavor, exactly as the style dictates. its not a flawless alt by any stretch, but this is a step in the right direction for American brewers. now that ive covered the basic mission lineup, I think they are a little all over the place, but might be on to something with their slight twists on mass appeal styles. I will keep checking out their beers as they come in.","StonedTrippin","Apr 17, 2013"

3.7,7.2,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Glowing amber when held toward the light, a bit darker than the average amber, labeled as a Dusseldorf style altbier. Forms a light beige head, thicket with fine speckled lacing across the sides of my glass. Aroma has a pleasant fruitiness/grapes/roasted malts with spicy earthy/herbal hops going on as well. Toasted Vienna malts stand out and really bring to mind a good Vienna style lager. Tastes leaves a bit to be desired, a bit of harsh grain husks, dry finish, not enough malts shine through, with a bit of nutty earthiness making things pretty bitter and almost off putting. So far, I can deal with it but it's way to hopped up, earthy dirty hop profile muddles the whole malt experience in this beer. Mouthfeel is a bit harsh with hop oils/bitterness on the palate lingering, not as crisp as I would like. Carbonation is solid medium bodied alt style bier from SoCal. Good stuff, enjoyable brew I'm liking more as it warms up take your time with this one.","WVbeergeek","May 26, 2012"

3.9,13,4,4,4,3,4,"Clear coppery amber with a beige cap that was a combination of fine and soapy bubbles. Good head retention with clumpy and streaky lacing. Malty aroma, not overly sweet though, with some toast and biscuit, grain, and faint herbal hops. Clean flavour with moderate bitterness (started out soft, but was sharper in the finish). More toast and biscuit with light caramel sweetness, slightly grassy with a hint of lemony citrus. Medium bodied with carbonation a bit higher than average, a bit dry with slight astringency. Very fresh tasting and quite drinkable. It's nice to see a someone take a (successful) stab at a less popular style.","DrJay","May 12, 2011"

2.81,-18.6,3,2,3,3.5,3,"Poured from a bomber into a pint glass, the beer is super-foamy. Pours a bright, crystal clear, pinkish-toned copper coloring with an off-white head that is big bubbled and lightly packed, and finally settles into about half an inch. Slightly sweet and sour caramel malt smells on the nose. The taste has the same caramel characteristics, but also a smokey tone that blends well with the sweet flavors. Very malty, but not overly sweet. The beer is dry and crisp, and the aftertaste again has that slight smoked quality to it. Very interesting. The finish lingers a bit with the caramel flavors. Nothing really outstanding about this one, but nothing overly disappointing, either.","GarthDanielson","Nov 12, 2010"
