"great beer.. more of a honey brown then an altbier... they call it a Dark Honey Ale.. its really good and worth trying.. no matter this rating"
""
"Not too sure how true to form this is for an altbier but I do know scurry is exceptionally drinkable.  The honey and molasses are very present but never overpowering.  The surprisingly crisp and light mouthfeel combine with just enough hop character to balance the sweetness.  Perfect sessionable beer for those cool summer nights."

"Flat. Unflattering aftertaste. Average beer."
"Appearance 3, Aroma 2.5, Flavor 2.5, Palate 3, Overall 2.75.  Sweet brown fizzy water.  I feel sorry for the oats that died to make this liquid."

"Good dark color.  I enjoyed the mouth feel initially although it finished with a very dry after taste.  Taste was initially okay, expected more sweet from the molasses and honey. The after taste is what got this beer poor ratings: the poor taste at the end and the dry mouth feel."
""
"Taste is of caramel, roasted malts, light smoke, honey, and a lot of molasses. makes for an interesting and complex sessionable beer.  Glad I picked it up to try.  Not sure if I would rush out to get this again, but it is tasty."
""
"Doesn't quite fit the style for altbier, but I do imagine they're not all that interested in that."
"I’m sorry to say this falls far short of the enticing description on the bottle.  While the acuteness of the oats is intriguing, this brew comes off as thin and sugary without much balance to speak of.  This is my first experience with Off Color, and I wouldn’t exactly describe it as putting their best foot forward."
""
""
""
"Not half-bad. Personally, I would have liked a little more from the malts but I didn’t let it ruin my night."
""
"Had this poured from a bottle at FIG in downtown Charleston, then subsequently returned the glass after about 3 or 4 sips and went back to the Revelry Crosstown Brown that I was drinking on tap. In the short time that my wife and I sampled the beer, there was plenty of opportunity to get an objective rating and experience. The beer was poured without so much as a suggestion of a head. No froth, foam or suds to be seen. It was a deep, roasty brown (in dim bar lighting) with decent clarity. The aroma was somewhat complex, with a sweet honey-like aroma, a little faint roasted nuttiness and an off sour vinegar scent. The flavor followed suit, imitating a toasty American brown ale, but with the addition of a peculiar green olive flourish.  I can't say if this is the desired flavor profile, or if this bottle was spoiled. The mouthfeel was pretty average. Adequate body and carbonation, so it didn't really stand out one way or the other. Minus the strange vinegar-like sour notes it would have passed as a mild brown ale, but I was simply unable to get past that odd quality. In reading other reviews, I've heard this beer described in so many different ways, it's a wonder that we are all drinking the same beer. Is it a matter of bottling or production consistency? Or is the beer that much of an enigma as to produce such vastly ranging descriptions? Hopped Porter, Stout, bubbly Scotch Ale, American Brown? These are all seemingly contradictory descriptions that you'll find here. Perhaps I would try this again, just to confirm whether the first bottle I had was off or not. At it's best, I doubt this is going to move the needle much either way."

"What else goes with barbecue ribs?"
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours fairly crystal clear deep reddish brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of caramel, toast, dark bread, honey, molasses, chocolate, light nuttiness, pear, apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester notes; with solid strength. Taste of caramel, toast, dark bread, honey, molasses, chocolate, light nuttiness, pear, apple, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, dark bread, honey, molasses, chocolate, light nuttiness, pear, apple, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Good robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; with a good malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice altbier style. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt and fruity yeast ester flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
"the nitro just makes this - I have had it from a bottle and on regular CO2 tap and thought it lacked body and was a bit thin - nitro is perfect for this - just sends it over the top with a fantastic mouth feel and rich body."
""
"Mainly dark fruits, good deal of malt, tad bit of spice, not very balanced.  Watery as well."
""
"Too flat for my taste"
""
""
""
"This beer was difficult to rate. It did not have any head, so it was ugly, it had a slight sour smell, which I hate and the taste was non-descript. Pretty bland actually. However it was not a bad tasting beer. It was slightly sweet and thats about it. I mean it was a dark beer but really did not taste dark. Good dark beer for a intro to non dark drinkers. or those who are scared of dark beers."
""
""
"O – Like most altbiers, this seems like it could identify in other categories, and this one gives a clear impression of a hopped porter or the beginning of an American stout.  Very flavorful, very drinkable, an excellent beer."
"O. A nice Porter like beer. Nice roster major flavor. Smells great but not of that translates to the actual taste. I like the mouthfeel for the style. Good beer. I would drink again but not go out of my way. Perfect for a ""make your own"" 6 pack."
"Something didn't work for me with this beer - way too much carbonation with a head that settled awkwardly and uneven on top of the beer with big symmetrical bubbles.  It had a soapy smell and bubbly taste on account of the carbonation.  It got slightly better after it settled and warmed slightly - the honey and molasses taste came out a bit that made me think it tasted more like a bubbly Scotch Ale.  I wouldn't buy this one again, but wouldn't write it off entirely as perhaps I got a bad bottle - I've liked the other Off Color beers I've tried."

"Low B-"
"Sorta underwhelming. Considering what the listed ingredients were, I thought it would be a bit more sweet and/or out there. Was good, but let down my high expectations."
""
"Pours a medium dark brown color with an off white head and plenty of lace.  Aroma of malt sweetness, notes of caramel, brown sugar.  The flavor has a good amount of nuts, caramel and raisin, pretty nice and well rounded ale.  Slight tangy flavor to go with the bread, nuts, caramel and raisin tones.  Oats smooth out the body with a hint of chocolate.  Full bodied, well carbonated ale.  Overall, this was a pretty good hybrid style bier and I would certainly drink this again some time."

"Oakey and a bit malty with a dark color and light body.  Flavor isn't super full, but it's drinkable.  I don't think I'd drink it again unless my only alternatives were cheap domestics."

"Bottle from Lazy Dog Macon. Pours dark brown with no head and lots of carbonation bubbles floating to the top. it looks like Coke. Aroma of honey, molasses and malt. Tastes of malt, molasses and very sweet. Light bodied with lots of carbonation with smokey finish. It’s like drinking an alcoholic Coca-Cola."

"This 'Altbier' (Old beer) style brew pours a deep mahogany in color with some ruby highlights. A very thin off-white is seen. More lacing seen than I did expect after the thin head. Very pleasant aroma of roasted and chocolate malts with a hint of honey and molasses also with more so in the taste. Great taste and goes down very easy. Medium carbonation as well as medium bodied. Overall, a different tasty brew."

""

"Pours a two finger white head that vanishes leaving no lace. Deep brown opaque color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied.  Not much of a nose maybe some honey and flavor is mild malts and hints of honey. $3.99 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."

"Pours dark brown in color with a slight mahogany hue. Head is this light tan izzy and dissipates quickly. Smell is malt forward with aromas of roasted cracker malt honey and a light fig aroma. Taste follows the nose with cracker malt and a very faint smokey flavor before some honey, molasses and very mild sweetness finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied smooth creamy with moderate to mild carbonation."
""
""
"It's very easy to drink but can't say that it wowed me over. Still nice to try a new style I never heard of before."
""
"I loved this and it's my favorite so far from this brewer."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is very good with malt flavor and slight molasses earthiness with sweet flavor and mild herbal flavor of hops with gentle earthy and dry yeast with a mild toffee-like semi sweet finish. Overall I consider this pretty good for the style a little on the sweet side but enjoyable all the way through"
""
"The body is just short of effervescent and rests on the border of light and medium. It's starts off with the promise of a bigger body, sweetness, maybe even creaminess, but dries out (which is nice) and still keeps some smoothness. It does go a little thinner than the style calls for, but all in all it's good stuff."

"Off Color continues to impress me so far."

"Overall - Simple and unassuming beer, but it's well made and balanced."
""
""
"O: No flaws but I expected more given the extensive ingredient list. Only my second time trying an altbier so glad to have the chance to try another"
""
""
""
""
"Overall, it was okay. Wasn't impressed. It taste like it's going to be amazing in the beginning and then just falls off into blandness."
"O- I'm glad I grabbed this in my travels. It's a very tasty, easy drinking beer. Surprised by the blend of raw grain and sweetness. "
""
""
""
"The beer is very easy to drink the honey probably plays a big role in the fizzy carbonation and lighter body. I enjoy the beer and find it an interesting recipe. Worth a shot."
""
""
""
"The flavor is less sweet than I expected. The hop is also much more present. There's some strong porter elements to this beer. Lowly carbonated with a fuller body. Short aftertaste but with a nice blend."
""
""
"Overall: Good beer. Though a bit cost prohibitive for me at four clams per bottle, were it to be a bit more reasonable, I would readily make this a standard addition to the fridge. It's got an inviting maltiness bolstered by the molasses and honey, yet it remains reasonably dry and nimble on the tongue, thanks to the healthy carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Altbiers aren't done a whole lot but Off Color's Scurry is a very nice, unique take on this German style, keeping in line with the malt and hop profile while spicing things up with wheat and flaked oats for a smooth body and honey and molasses for sweetness and a little sumthin' special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Didn't expect the tart character. Definitely malt dominant, with enough dryness at the finish to counter the suggested sweetness from the aroma. If that off flavor weren't there, this would fare better."
""
"overall: Pleasant and fits the altbier profile. A ""smooth"" and ""delicate"" beer. Nothing bad to say about this. Pleasant enough though nothing to get excited about either."
""
""
""
"Overall: This is only my second Altbier that I have drank. The other is New Glarus Altbier. I have to say that this is a really good beer style. Its like a sessionable brown ale; flavorful yet very easy drinking. This is honestly my favorite beer that I have tried from Off Color so far. I have had Troublesome and Apex Predator. Its a must try if you like Altbier, I definately prefer Off Color Scurry over New Glarus Alt. I would also recommend this beer to people who like a malty brown ale because this beer will fit into that niche very well."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Solid beer. Well balanced bready dark ale, nicely carbonated with some creaminess in the mouthfeel that adds a lot to this beer. I think it is brewed very well, but nothing I would seek out. Seems like what I have had from off-color so far is pretty great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Love, love, love Off Colors labels and their general ambiance. This is my second beer from them and both have been above average. I never mind being able to enjoy a well made offering of a style that is rare among the American craft beer scene."
""
"Overall: So Off Color Brewing defines this as a beer that is based on the obscure style, a Kottbusser which is a dark honey ale. I love the vision and inspiration these guys have and I really enjoyed the beers they have produced so far. If you want something different, these are your guys."
"O - enjoyable brew esp when I want something roasty but not so much a porter or stout"
""
""
""
"Overall a very pleasant summertime beer with a variety of flavors."

"very cool recipe here in a surprising beer. a honey and molasses dark beer thats heavy on the oats. i expected a sugar bomb and got a remarkably dry and full flavored beer that seems more appropriate for autumn than late spring. dark amber to light brown in color, some viscosity here, and not a ton of head, creamy and lazy looking. the nose is the unrefined sugar element of the molasses, a nice rich grain bill that ranges from medium crystal malt to chocolate malt and the buttery dry freshness of rolled oats. hops appear minimal in the nose. the flavor is great, i get the honey on the front end, the essence of the bee, the pollen and the flower, with much of the sweetness being fermented out. perfect grain profile for that flavor too, its just right. more molasses in the finish with a light spice and a very sturdy base in terms of body. a really dialed in and clever recipe, i hope this is around in the fall when the leaves start to turn, it has that hunker down and cozy in type of vibe without being a barrel aged enormous beer. i super dig this."

"Overall: as I said, I'm not a great fan of amber ales unless they are extremely well-done. The caramel in Scurry really is something to experience, and, while some of its surrounding flavors don't float my boat, I do enjoy this beer."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is a very interesting concoction, highly drinkable, and totally unusual. I'm not sure I want to try this often but it's great to share the adventurous spirit. From the 12 oz bottle purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle."

"Pours a deep brown with a few shades of maroon mixed in. It looks pretty clear but it's hard to tell due to the relatively dark color. Small head, beige. It's really just a smattering of bubbles and even those fade away after a minutes. The aroma has a grapey malt sweetness to it. Some deeper sweetness, molasses and caramel, is also fairly strong. Maybe, a touch of honey, but that's always hard to find in beer. Fairly nutty. Mild cocoa. I'd bet the molasses contributed a good bit of color because there isn't a ton of darker malt flavor. It's definitely more toasty, and lightly so at that, than roasty. The taste is similar, though there's a piney hop note and almost cinnamon-y spice flavor. Mild mint, too. It's fairly sweet, almost cloying for a ~5% abv beer. The mouthfeel is fairly full. Those oats give it some body. It's actually more altbier-ish than I'd expected. Regardless, it's tasty enough and they packed in a good amount of flavor for the abv, but it's just not all that enjoyable. A bit too much sweetness without really committing to that idea."

"Pours a clear dark reddish-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of toasted malt, molasses, and nut aromas. Taste is much the same with molasses, oat, and nut flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of toast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a very nice set of aromas and tasty flavors that get better as the beer warms up."
"I find this beer to be unique in that it's lighter in feel and abv, but the flavor is terrific and moderately complex. The molasses adds a brown sugar sweetness to go with the honey and it just compliments the cocoa notes fantastically. I could probably drink a whole sixer of this. Wonderful little brew."
""
"Scurry is a somewhat more hefty ale than what the Germans would have made, but its kiss of molasses and chocolate tilt suggests an American microbrewer hand was involved."
""
"O:  This is going to make some great pancakes."
""
"Interesting brew as it holds about 80 percent a solid roasted toasted ale and 20 percent a light watery mix."
"Poured into a He'brew small shaker pint. Pours a medium to dark mahogany amber with a thin light tan head with decent retention and light lacing. Aroma of bready malt, molasses, hints of nuts and chocolate, dark dried fruit. Flavor follows with dark sweet malt, molasses, nuts, dark dried fruit, dark bread. Medium bodied. A nice example of a old ale / altbier style brown ale with a pleasant sweet, dark malt bill and lots of supporting flavors. Well balanced and interesting."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours a clear mahogany/ruby red color with about an inch and a half light tan head. Head retention is decent, and there's a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like honey, molasses, chocolate, and some nuts. The brew tastes like honey, molasses, earthiness, chocolate, nuts, and some dark bread. It's a mostly sweet tasting beer. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth, a bit syrupy and easy enough to drink. I think it's a good brew. It's the first beer I've had from Off Color Brewing, and hopefully it won't be the last."
""
""
"O- I really enjoy the taste of this brew, a little thin in the mouth but it is very drinkable."
""
"O: This beer seems to have very non-descript aromas and flavors and doesn't stand out compared to any of the other beers I've had in this style."
""
""
""
""
"O: Really good beer that surprisingly comes in a six pack. Love that! The aroma is on point and the taste delivers as well. I would regularly drink this but the price is a tad steep. However, you get what you pay for. Cheers!"

""

""

""

""
""
"O: Good Altbier that is well worth tasting."
""
""
""
"Pour is dark brown with red edges and a fizzy tan head. Nose is mostly molasses and notes of coffee bean and roast. Taste is more sticky molasses and strong roasted malt notes. Some cooked brown sugar through a finish that thins a bit. Medium body with assertive carbonation thinning in the finish."
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid ale with a really fun label. While I didn’t get much in the way of honey or molasses the dark malty notes were fantastic. I am not too familiar with lagers, but the lager yeast wasn’t too prominent over the malts, which I really enjoyed. Recommended to all fans of malty lagers. Enjoyed while several ounces of snow accumulated outside my door."
""
"Appearance is a deep amber with white head. Nose feature dry roasted malts with light honey notes and chocolate. Very malty. The taste follows in suit with the nose. Heavy on roasted malts, with light honey notes shining throughout. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is moderate with light carbonation. Overall, a nice take on the style. Definitely worth trying!"

"o - a really well made beer. Very enjoyable. I look forward to trying more from this brewery. I hear they will be coming to NY soon, can't wait!"

"(O)- It would be worth enjoying a 6pack of for sure out of its enjoyment level. Another more obscure style that I do not have alot of experience with, but from past examples, this is much sweeter and richer for the style in my eyes."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark amber capped by a cream colored one and half finger head; nice-looking beer. Average retention, little to no lacing. Molasses, hints of maple syrup, and plenty grain on the nose. Caramel, toffee, and grainy accents upfront. Subtle notes of apple peel, pear, and honey midpalate that carry through to the finish. Hints of sweetness throughout, but very well balanced. Slick medium body with syrupy accents on the edges. A very enjoyable and very drinkable beer that I enjoyed very much and plan to revisit."

"O - Great beer for fall. Easy to drink with low ABV. Too sweet to be sessionable, but one goes down great."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a beautifully restrained ale, which reminds me of New Glarus in its drinkability. In other words, I could easily drink a six pack of this in a couple of hours, and I think that’s part of Off Color’s intention; it’s an easily crushable brew. Smells sweet and malty, touch of honey. Clear dark brown with a red tinge, but not approaching black. I love how it tastes, sweet up front but not cloying. Pleasant dry finish. Elegant, you might say. Palate is slightly creamy behind the up-front tingly carbonation. The overall effect is greater than the sum of its parts. I love it. BONUS: This is now in 12oz bottles in six-packs. A $9.99 per six-pack beer made by great local brewers? I was getting worried Chicago's new craft beers only came in $10 bombers, Half Acre being the exception. So, thank you, thank you, thank you, Off Color."

"Where else could Bachelor Party-Palooza 2013 end but Smut-n-Eggs at Twisted Spoke? Might as well indulge in some tempura-fried bacon and a Kottbusser. This stuff pours a slightly-murky sienna topped by a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises dry barley, mixed nuts, dried maple syrup, and a hint of oatmeal-raisin cookie. The taste brings in more of the same, though things are dominated by a toasty syrup-coated nut flavor that doesn't sit all that well with my tastebuds. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta slick feel. Overall, I wasn't the biggest fan of this beer. It was nice to try a style that's nearly extinct, but this one just tasted a bit too strange for me. Still, a solid way to end a crazy night..."

"O: Very nice altbier. Sweet but not sweet enough to inhibit drinkability. I probably had around 4 or 5 tasters of this throughout the night."
"The brewers mentioned the next batch will have more honey aroma, in this batch it was added all at once and sank to the bottom. Looking forward to this beer on draft for the summer (and beyond)."
