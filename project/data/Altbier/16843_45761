3.65,2.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A sweet, slightly crisp, slightly bitter, appropriately malt-dominant Alt.  There's really not much to say about this somewhat turbid, orange-brown beer: it's a very solid, very conventional alt.  It doesn't have a lot of depth, in terms of character or flavor, and it's even a bit thin in the mouth, but it basically subscribes to the general premise of Alts.  It's drinkable, if a little malt-dry—mostly toasted biscuit, and a bit of nut—and its hop-bitterness wavers in the wrong direction just a tad—not cleansing as much as it should; lingering more than it should—but it's an altogether competent, drinkable brew.","OrestesMethuon","Dec 09, 2014"

Lots of toasty, bready notes balanced with some caramel sweetness. I get some apple/pear fruitiness on the nose but again none of it is overpowering. Taste is more of the same with a good amount of hop bitterness to balance the roast and the sweet. Mouthfeel was fine, didn't detract from the beer but felt appropriate. Overall this is a really nice, well balanced beer. It has depth but is not overly complex. The flavors are sticking in my mouth and leaving me with a really nice aftertaste, this beer just keeps on giving. I will definitely seek this one out again.","quirkzoo","Nov 02, 2011"
4.15,16.6,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"O: Really to be honest, aside from their barrel roll series, this is the finest beer I've ever had from hangar. I've had multiple beers of theirs multiple times, and frequently I've just kind of shrugged my shoulders at their offerings. If I could consistently have this beer in this state every time, then I'd say it's one of the finest unusual style beers served in California. My home brew friends have raved about how stylistically on this beer is, so while I don't know the style, I have to say I really am impressed with this beer. If you haven't had a hangar beer in a while, it's worth paying a visit. Furthermore, They deserve more ratings on these beer sites for how well they seem to sell locally.","Cavery","Oct 06, 2011"
3.08,-13.5,3.5,3,3,3.5,3,"Nice amber color and lacing in the tall pilsener glass. Mild flavors with a touch of the sweet and sour that I associate with Altbiers. Very light body and the general impression is a lager gone bad. Murky flavors, a touch of roasted malt. Sprightly mouthfeel but just a dirty aftertaste with some hop bitterness. Slight beer smell. I think this one is just not worth bothering with, it seems to detract from the style. There are so many other pleasant beers with a touch of malt, like all the LTD lagers from Full Sail.","mactrail","Aug 16, 2011"
