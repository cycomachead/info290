3.73,7.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Taste leans heavily towards the malty end of the spectrum with a nutty yeast flavor and bold, near-burnt toffee…almost like licking a coffee bean….roasted and husky even. Sweetness is low and shows barely a light dusting of cocoa powder. Alcohol is up there, feels around 7% or so. Not bad, not bad…an interesting bockish-scottish ale that drinks pretty decent. I see this is an Altbier here on BA...I can see that, maybe like an Imperial ALtbier of sorts :)","twiggamortis420","Jan 18, 2012"

3.97,14.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"A smooth and thick medium body, but on the heavy side of medium with just enough carbonation to let you know that the beer is alive. The flavors are all sweet and malty. There is caramel, toffee, toasted dark bread, and a hint of maple. All of this smoothly transitions to a slightly bitter finish that's just dry enough to make you really want that next sip. I'm really enjoying this beer and wishing that altbier was a more readily available style.","SuperSpy","0"

3.58,2.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours a dark brownish-red color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of toffee with some dark fruit added. The flavor is similar. I get a lot of toffee and hazelnut notes, with some dark fruit thrown in. Light mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I don't have much to say about the beer because there is not a whole lot going on. A decent, easy drinker but nothing too exciting.","Mora2000","Sep 15, 2011"
3.77,8.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Opinion: This is a pretty decent representation of this style, and this is definitely one of my more favorite beers that I have tried from Rahr (Their Barrel Aged Winter Warmer is my favorite so far). This one is a little green, but this is a hard style to do well, and they did pretty well. If you are a big fan of Altbiers, like I am, I would give this one a "day in court".","SkeeterHawk","Sep 10, 2011"

3.67,5.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"My buddy Scott stumbled across this, cheers. It is dark, translucent brown with very little head. The smell gets things going, though, with caramel, wood, and a biscuit smell. The taste is slightly sharp and almost smoky with a kind of earthy aftertaste. Very easy to drink. See? I just did it. The mouthfeel is thin and a little slippery. Overall, definitely a refreshing beer with a noticeable but not overpowering character. I'd like it with BBQ, I imagine and I like it in me, I'm sure. Somewhere between "buy another sixer" and "buy a keg" I'd say.","roblowther","Aug 05, 2011"

3.65,4.9,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"While the Rahr brewery generally impresses me, this beer does not. I would probably have called it a strong porter rather than an alt. It doesn't fit alt characteristics at all. And, it's just not a very interesting beer.","allengarvin","0"
4.17,19.8,4,4.5,4,4.5,4,"The beer is dark copper with a thick tan head that faded and left a filmy layer and lacing. It smells strangely of mint with some spicy hops and fruit, it's a very different smell for a beer but it does smell quite good. It tastes bitter with lemon and pine, there is a lot of sweet caramel malt and dark fruit. The beer is thick with low carbonation and a sticky lingering finish. This is the best altbier I've had so far, it is very balanced between sweet and bitter.","JMad","Jul 12, 2011"
3.94,13.2,3,4,4,4,4,"O: This is tasty although I have no basis as to the style. Reading about some of the other beers in the style it seems pretty close. Well done, Rahr.","GregSVT","Jul 09, 2011"
3.68,5.7,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 oz bottle poured to pint glass. A hazed, dark amber pour with little head that quickly fades to collar and almost no lace. Aroma of toasted malt and a spice like a rye. The flavor is caramel malt balanced with a hay-like hop and tangy spice. Has an earthy, slightly bitter and dry finish. More than average carbonation keeps it lively. Think this beer would be perfect when paired with a grilled pork chop.","jALEson","Jul 08, 2011"
