"Very sweet. Cloying.  Strange astringent aftertaste.  Very unpleasant."

"Hard to review this beer. It smells fantastic; all the rich malty notes from quality dark european beers like toffee, raisin, molasses, etc. The taste follows the aroma but it's just too sweet for me to drink the whole bottle. Mouthfeel is full, a little syrupy. Sweetness lingers after the swallow. So although I couldnt finish the bottle because the sweetness was a bit cloying, I can tell its well made, and is what it is, really. I can others enjoying it if you have a sweet tooth. I imagine it would go well with game meat."
"The beer's full body makes it a slow sipping affair, But the thinning effects of aged acidity and alcohol keeps the taste palatable and manageable to avoid cloying. Its long and savory finish is chocked full of umami and spiced rum."

"Had this at Christmas and it massively exceeded my expectations. Wonderfully balanced, quirky beer with a complex mix of flavours - caramel, raisins, prunes, lots of malt - not overly sweet. Shares some characteristics with Doppelbocks, but the alcohol is much better disguised. Really hope to track this down again."
""
"Taste like fugde (very sweet butter) with some ogange zest and a quite nice bitter finish."

"O: A nice dessert beer, but pretty intense with some rough edges."
""
""
""
"Not very balanced and that is a pity...."
""
""
""
""
"Wow, this is a grand brew, very enjoyable and satisfying."
"Dark rich light fruit and toffee, nice cap to a great evening."
"Fantastic. Like a cross between a Belgian quad and a barleywine. Well balanced with a bit of boozy warmth"

"Overall- I didn't care for this beer. The aromas and flavors were good but it was a bit too sweet for me. I also didn't care for the excessively thick and sticky mouthfeel."
""
"Definitely sticke – a malt-heavy altbier that I could drink all day. Its appearance is outstanding, saying “Trink” while its flavor makes you want to drain the glass (or bottle or tap). A lovely malt bomb!"
""

""
"Low B-"

"This brew shows a dark and hazy mahogany color with a decent but delicate light tan head and a sure cascading lace. The aroma offers deep caramel maple malt with a subtle grassy edge. Maybe a little chocolate licorice to boot. Nice. The flavor climaxes with an intense sweet licorice malt and more grassy hops. There's a bit of rhubarb tartness and deep root beer flavor. It is a little sweeter than I normally like but it's tolerable as you enjoy the combined flavors. It finishes a bit harsh at the back of the palate with a modest carbonation and a smooth feel from this medium bodied brew. I would say that there's a cloying quality here that interferes with the enjoyment but they get kudos for big flavor."
""
"This might be the oldest beer I've ever consumed. It was amazing- the strong altbier had turned into a rich barley-wine like ale, almost like a very dry old ale. Some oxidation was present, but it didn't really detract. One of the best beers I've ever had."
"O-My limited experience with other altbiers was nothing like this. Whereas those other beers were mellow and lighter in body, this beer is hugely complex and substantial...a real sipper. I kept thinking I was drinking a quad or a hopped-up dubbel because the malt profile was so huge and similar in flavor. I'm not sure how true to style this beer is, but I really enjoyed it and would definitely drink more."
""
"My rating will be skewed as a result of the appearance, which really didn't appeal to me, but I otherwise found this beer to be good and presenting a lot of different aromas and flavors. I'd like to try this more often and perhaps much fresher to determine whether my rating reserves an adjustment. Still, I'm a fan."

"Nice beer. I wish I had a younger sample. The stales distracts on the intake. Yet can still imagine what a fresh version would be. Will seek out a younger one in time."

"Good beer"

"Definitely as malty as I expected, and without a doubt a far purer altbier - a polar opposite in so many respects from the rival kölsch recipe across the Rhine. Nevertheless, I doubt we get these as fresh as I'd like in the US. The oxidized notes are obvious, and the malts are far more on the sweetened, honeyed side more than I personally enjoy it to be. Here's hoping fresher German altbiers will come into the US - for now, I will sip on this let it lay me down like the boozy malty elixir that it has become."
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dull coppery brown with chunks of yeast and no head. Definitely looking both German and malty. The nose is definitely sweet with bit of fruity yeast and alcohol on the back end. The taste delivers the goods as expected with fruit and malt upfront reminiscent of figs and plums and a lingering burn from the alcohol clouding the palate and sloughing off some taste buds when it finally dissipates. It's medium bodied, yeasty, under-carbonated, slightly boozy, and quite malty. This is a tasty brew, malty and boozy, thanks for sharing doc."

"great beer to have on a fall night would not want to drink this daily but its very enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
"O- Nifty beer, better flavor than the smell. Not my normal style but I did enjoy it. I probably wont purchase again, more because I would rather have a good Stout."
""
""
""
"O: This is a fantastic beer."
""
"Taste- Caramel malt with raisin and fig notes and a bready malt that comes through just before the bittering hops lay a spiciness on the back of the tongue. Warming alcohol heat that does not come through in taste except for maybe a little sweetness."
""
""
"O: OVerall, very good, I would definitely get this again, it is very enjoyable and the higher ABV doesn't overwhelm the flavors at all. Would definitely buy this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer is a bit hard for me to drink. But, I can't say it's really my style of beer. I can appreciate it for what it is, though. I'd like to try some other beers of this style."
""
"O: Great balance of flavors that are smooth and palate pleasing. The aged presence really shines here. This is a beer I will be gravity g more of soon. Cheers!"
"O- very full flavor, glad it only comes in 11 oz bottle"
""
""
"Flip top bottle. Pours a thick dark mahogany brown with no head. Aroma of caramel malt, some dark dried fruit esters, brown sugar, yeast and bready notes fill the senses. Taste same as aroma with some sweet liquorices flavor, alcohol and mild bitter notes. Palate is a full body, sweet thick sticky mouth feel, mild carbonation. Finish is sweet caramel malt, very yeasty and bread, with some dark fruit, brown sugar, ending with a dry boozy lingering sweet bitter liquorices flavor. Overall a good strong flavorful brew."
"O: Interesting brew. Very thick, very heavy. It feels like some 15% monster. I cannot overstate how heavy it is for an 8.5% brew, by far the heaviest for the ABV. Nice strength and balance of flavors. A malty, sweet sipper for sure. I enjoyed it a lot."
""
""

"O - Superbly drinkable with world class balance."

"overall nothing special to me, but if youre a fan of dopplebocks this is a beer you will definitely enjoy."
"is a dopplesticke a style of beer? some sort of smoked dopple bock or something? this is my first encounter with one, thanks to the legendary claystation. this oddity pours a deep amber to brown color, with visible carbonation and a homebrewed root beer looking head, nice and thick and just off white. the nose is sweet and smoky, not quite on the rauchbier level, but definitely pronounced. there are a mix of dark roasted as well as sweeter caramel grains, and some yeast that's about strong enough to break it all down. the flavor of this beer is huge, about as much intensity as can be packed into a single (very interestingly shaped) bottle. long graham crackery sweetness all the way through, some pleasant oak smoke up front, and noticeable relaxing alcohol content that seems appropriate with all this malt density. claystation described it as meaty, like downright bacon. I was less inclined to say meat, and more maybe just smoke. I guess I can see some beef jerky going on here, but its not pervasive. long sweet finish. the feel is as full bodied as they come, and the carbonation is decent, but hardly lightens the texture up at all. this is a bomb, a bottle to be shared, and one of the more unique german beers ive encountered. not sure ill rush to find one again, but I enjoyed the experience and thought process involved here."

"Overall - An interesting beer.. kind of tastes like a dubbel/barley wine but with some gruit like flavours mixed in. Not something I'd drink a whole lot of, but points for originality."
""
""
""
""
""
"Full of character, at first kick as a mule with its intense flavors. From the Uerige’s versions I believe the Sticke is the most balanced, also flavorful but still with high drinkability to drink. This version is best at winter or for a slow degustation."
""

"Drinkability – This is a good beer. and goes down easy."

"Poured into a stange glass. Pours dark copper with a near finger-length off-white head. The beer is mostly opaque, but there is some light visible along the bottom of the glass. The head dissipates, leaving a thin cap of lace atop the beer. The beer smells of dark roasted malt, toffee, plum, and raisin. It's a very rich and inviting aroma. Like their standard alt, the beer has more hop notes than you would expect just from the nose. There's a strong bready malt backbone with some toffee sweetness, plum, and raisin. There's some earthy and woody hop notes in this beer that come through rather well to balance everything out and provides some satisfying back end bitterness. I can't taste the 8.5% ABV because it is masked very well. The body is full with moderate carbonation. The beer goes down smoothly and has a dry finish. This is pleasantly drinkable for such a big beer. This is an excellent beer."
""
""
"Taste is like a raisin rolled in brown sugar, drizzled with dark rum and thrown in a pan on high heat with no oil or butter. Quite decadent and the alcohol feels bigger than 8.5%, surprising considering how rich the beer is. Mouthfeel is great and silky, I would definitely buy this again, even with the fairly steep pricetag."
"This is an outstanding slow sipping beer. Not so strong as to make you comatose. A welcome addition to any cold weather beer drinking."
""
""
""
"Wow. This was difficult to score because I've never had quite an ale like this. I paced myself but, by the end, I wish I'd had a much bigger mug of this. Oh boy!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, one of the neater bottles I've held, and I was happy to go for a few more experience points in a lesser known style, but I didn't love it. This, certainly, could purely be personal preference."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: For a beer this sticky-sweet, it doesn't at all feel it (that's a good thing!). Drinks very clean off the palate."
"Overall. Very interesting stuff here. Can't say I've had anything like it before. (Edit: Just checked, haven't had anything of this style before) Not sure if it's my thing or not, but I'd try it again to see."
""
""
""
""
"Drinkability - High. Initial sweetness is well balanced by sharper flavors and bitterness to keep me coming back for more. Wish more breweries made doppelsticke beers."
"O- Very unique and quite drinkable for such a strong beer. I'm not in a hurry to have another but respect it for what it is."
""
"Overall: Uerige Doppelsticke is a fantastic altbier, it is easy to see why it is rated at the top of the style! I will certainly be getting many more bottles of this in the future."
"i wish there were a BROS score because sometimes there is a large discrepancy between the BA score and ""THE BROS"" score.... i dont know- this strikes me as the EKU28 or the SAMICLAUS did when i was just a younger man, with lots of fruity, brandy-like tastes and, apparently, a whole lot of alcohol. it's just not my idea of a good time, although i appreciate the fact that someone is brewing this stuff. it definitely is a sipper, as opposed to a 'hungry' brew, and i think back to a THOMAS HARDY i had back then also. that's it!! it's similar to a THOMAS HARDY. gawd, that stuff was a gagger then, and it's a still a gagger now. even if i do feel i have refined my taste buds a bit. i appreciate the taste, but it just isnt someting i'd buy a lot of . . . ."
"Review from 12/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Dark, dark red amber. Nice light tan head and lots of lacing. Malt, roast malt and fruit aroma. Excellent presentation, both the head and aroma are very nice. Medium to heavy bodied, strong malt, toasted malts and dark fruits up front. Middle and finish with a tannic, bitter malt flavor. I like the complexity of the flavor, but the finish is a bit too astringent for me. Well made, but not quite to my taste."
""
"overall; this is a tasty treat to be sipped and cherished. Not much of a session drink but beyond worthy to the distinguished palate. The burnt malt is somewhat to excessively strong and seems to take away from other more discrete flavor profiles. Wonderful but I'd prefer the lower alcohol offerings from this brewery, as far as taste and balance is concerned."
"O: A very intriguing balance of flavors in this rich ale. Recommended."
"O: Incredibly tasty! I would gladly polish of as many of these as I could, but also I would take as much time as I could possibly in doing so. The alcohol content should make most people wary of drinking one of these quickly, but I'm young and it's the weekend! Fantastic brew."
"O: This beer is well balanced between the malt sweetness and the bitterness but the mouthfeel and the higher ABV make this a beer that you could have only a single in a session. This is a sipping beer and is not sessionable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - A very nice beer! If you are a malt bomb fanatic, this is a nice beer to sip on. Complex, but straightforward. Keep in mind this beer is an ""imperial"" Alt beer. Very well executed and very enjoyable."
"WOW! Words cannot describe the aroma of this beer. This is a malt lovers dream come true. Very complex layers that meld wonderfully. Good alcohol presents that fits perfectly in with the rest of the flavors."
""
""
"O: Excellent Altbier – a little on the sweet side – but lots of complex flavors and aromas. Nice sipping beer at 8.5% abv."
"O: I don't want to say terrible, but what could have been really cool is absolutely ruined by whatever the hell is going on. I'll put up another bottle in the future, but as it is, stay far, far away."
"O: This certainly deserves the praise it gets, no question."
"Overall: A nice powerful winter warmer. Save for cold weather and drink as an after-dinner beer."
"O: Amazing all around. This is a must-try."
""
""
"Medium bodied with a similar amount of carbonation that creates a fairly creamy and smooth-flowing mouthfeel. Finish is quite dry, with plenty of residual stickiness on the palate."
""
"Highly approachable and mysterious in an Uerige Flute, luring one to seek more. One will easily look forward to trying this with smoked cheeses."
""
"Poured a deep violet, no real head is produced other than a film which faded about halfway through the glass. Little to no retention and some modest legs. Nose is heavy on the malt, sugary dark fruits, some brown sugar and dark bread. Although resembling a sweet fruity doppel(sticke), this had some qualities akin to what reminded me of a similar English Barleywine (call me crazy!). Taste has more dark fruits, figs and dates. Still lightly sugary, bready and malty as heck. Rich dark toffee and caramel, with a ton of herbal and spicy hop notes in the finish (producing the same dryness and bitterness as the others). No real alcohol on the palate, with a full and dense body. Sweet with a very low carbonation, that's a shade or two off of being flat. A big sipper for the winter, I can imagine this being immaculate on draught or cask."

"O - rich and full of flavor, this beer has a great balance and tons of character. Not too sweet and not to dry."

"All in all a very well-balanced beer with complex and refined notes and lots of drinkability. I am again highly impressed with another great beer from Uerige."
"I give it an A-. Unique looking bottle."
"I thought that even though a bit ""big"" for the style that this was excellent. Recco."
"Overall: Great example of the style but also a little pricey, one I would try again."
"Mouthfeel - Very creamy. Full bodied. Velvety. Slight astringency in the finish."
"A perfect beer to savor on a chilly autumn evening. Highly reccomended."
"M, D- This dark and weighty brew, with hints of alcohol, slows the drinking pace. The CO2 keeps it from dragging."
"Overall an expertly crafted beer that traveled to the States well. I wish the bottle, which will be perfect for future use in homebrewing, was larger because one pint might not be enough."
"Overall great. A very unique tasting beer and very distinct. Needs a good food pairing! Never had anything like it and I enjoy it."
"O: Overall it's a good beer. I would drink it again in a heartbeat, and would also recommend it to others. I can't give it 4.5 or 5.0 simply because it wasn't up to that standard, but it is a solid 4.0 which is a really good score in my book."
"O - How does an eight year old altbier taste? Pretty good! The caramel played nicely throughout the entire beer...I wonder what a fresher bottle would taste like?"
"D- A superb alt. Reminds me of Adnams broadside. Lots of hop and malt presence that balance well but still manage to hold their own indivdual characteristics in both palate and nose. A beer to warm the soul."
"O-One cannot deny that this is damned good stuff. I would hazard to say that this brew is the benchmark of the style but then again how many double altbiers do you see? I really need to track down a fresher bottle of this to see if the age has detracted or not."
"Overall pretty good, a nice dark German ale with some nice malts, hops, hint of booze, nice fruits and tasty overall beer."
"Finishes sweet with a little ethanol heat on the back of the tongue. An interesting beer, the imperial altness is not quite my thing on this hot eve, but I can see its vision in the fall..a glorious glass tempting me."
"This is a beautiful Alt. This is a huge beer, that hides its size wonderfully. It balance between the dark and sweet malt flavors and the hoppy undertones marry perfectly. This is a wonderful sipper, that I would buy again without hesitation."
"Poured a hazy, dark mahogany brown with a nice puff of off-white head. Aroma of caramel malts and dark dried fruit, with some musk, and a hint of earthy hops. Rich and flavorful, with tastes of sweet caramel malts, raisins and Fig Newtons, fresh hops, earthy, with a slight sensation of apple peel. Finishes nice and dry. Medium mouthfeel, and quite a pleasant drink."
"Medium bodied with a fine but soft carbonation."
"This is a delectable dark altbier, one that really makes the German style shine."
"Interesting and unique beer here, my first alt so I don't know what to make of it. The smokey elements balance the pungent fruit and malts, so overall I'm enjoying it. Hides its strength pretty well. I will need more time to consider this but for now I say it's pretty good but not for everyone."
"This caught my eye because the unique bottle they have. This beer pours out as a deep brown color with a minimal head on it. The smell of the beer has some rich malts on the nose, there's also a light roasted smell to the beer. The taste has a nice sweet flavor, with a malty dry aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a little thick which is kind of nice. Overall I found this beer to be interesting, I'd like to try this one again sometime."
"O: This is an absolutely delicious beer, and words can barely do it justice. Find it, drink it, be grateful to be alive. As their Web site says, it is 'the delicious droplet.'"
"O - Strange brew; I like it quite a bit."
"Creamy throughout, smooth on the finish, with a chalky dry feeling in the mid-palate. Fine carbonation allows the beer to dance on the tongue while allowing the body of the brew to shine. Easy to drink, and so complex that I can't imagine that I've caught it all, I definitely hope to return to this soon."
"Served from bottle into a Mother Earth strange. Poured a massively dark amber with a one finger light tan head. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark fruit, caramel, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel, sweet alcohol, and honey. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice brew. It was very well balanced despite having quite a bit going on. The aroma was not very strong but was still quite good after you worked to find it. I would have never guessed that the alcohol was this high on this one as the sweetness aspect of this brew hides it quite well. A definite must try if you have not done so already."
"Nose is sweet and bready, hints of toffee and cocoa, light fruitiness. Initial notes are sweet and light: cherry, molasses, toffee, bread. Followed by a bit of cocoa, earth, nuttiness and toast. Finish is nice and dry, almost roasty, plenty of bite. A hint of booze as well. Slightly thinner body, complex flavor, silky mouthfeel. This is a top notch beer - wish I had gotten a few more. It's a style I don't normally gravitate to but this is a damn fine beer."
"Reminded me a little of an Imperial stout with the complex, robust flavors. Halfway through the glass, I was wishing I had bought more than one!"
"Sampled on April 30, 2011. There was a code on the label that I simply could not read but I think it had a couple of zeroes in it. It has a gorgeous reddish-mahogany brown pour with a long-lasting, foamy head and seltzer water-like carbonation. The malt aroma is overwhelming. It is sweet like molasses and sharp like licorice. Oh, and did I say it was malty? It really tingles my tongue with its sweet malty, toffee taste and its dry bite stabbing me at the end. I also thought the bottle was kind of neat."
"Poors a mahogany brown. Big malty aroma. Roasted, Carmel, toffee, sticky sweetness almost like maple syrup or creme brulee. mouthfeel is rich almost a bit too sweet/cloying. Overall good. Trying to get into the German styles after assaulting my pallet with IPA's and Stouts for years...a good start."
"O: Good but not great. I'll probably chose to spend my money elsewhere in the future."
"O - very very pleasant. smooth. well balanced. more hoppy than i would have thought but def a brew to give a shot. yay germany"
"Draft. Sampled at Kickbacks. Served in a snifter glass and pours a dark, murky reddish mahagony brown color with a rich tan head. Some lace. I’ve NEVER smelled an Altbier like this! Rich aroma of dark fruit raisin and plum with some caramel notes as well. Medium mouthfeel. Caramel notes off the bat along with the mentioned dark fruit notes. Some roasted flavors creep into the flavor as well. Fairly complex. Booze shows slightly and ends with a lingering bitterness."
"Drinkability: Again, this beer defines umami. It is so delicious because it covers so many flavor components, and covers them all very well. It is complex, fruity, sweet, bitter and GERMAN. This is the best German beer I have ever had, and it rivals many of the overall beers I have ever had. As close to perfection as it gets."
"The mouthfeel is outstanding, substantial and even sticky."
"O: not my favorite; don't really like the flavor of aged brews, old ales, etc... As this was an aged version of an Altbier (Doppelsticke), it didn't quite do it for me; however, considering the style of beer it is, it was very well done, and remained true to its characteristics"
"Notes: Hmm, high bracket for the style? I have not had many Altbiers but all I've had before this was forgettable. This is on an entirely different league. Nice complex treat!"
"Full bodied with moderate carbonation. There is quite a bit of alcohol burn for an 8.50 % abv beer. The aftertaste is both bitter and sweet at the same time. A good beer which was a nice treat to find at Zipp's Liquors."
"Pours yields a deep molasses-colored brew with a good off-white head with good retention. Lacing sticks to the sides of the glass in a spotty fashion. The nose is incredibly rich with dark fruits, molasses, brown sugar, and some caramel. It's nearly a cross between a doppelbock and an eisbock. Really insanely enjoyable. The flavor doesn't back down, presenting a really nice fruity presence along with a touch of booze in the background. Mouthfeel is quite nice, but fails a bit in the finish. Good medium body presents itself well, but there's a bit too much bitterness in the finish, wiping away the beautiful flavor. Really quite drinkable. A solid hit on the best of Germany list."
"D: Sweet, fruity and full of chocolate. Not bad, definitely interesting. I'll have to seek out more beers from this style and from this brewery."
"The taste surprised me a lot with what I conceived of as a plumish spice. A bit of wheat smoothed the beer out after the plum but then came the alcohol taste followed by some malty sweetness. This is a very interesting beer and although it isn't my style it certainly tested my palette and was surprising enough to impress."
"Overall I really like this beer. It has a nice flavor, even if I cannot describe it properly, and is a full bodied beer. I like everything about this beer even down do the funky gasket bottle. I'm definitely going to be picking up another one of these. So this is definitely not my first German beer and definitely not my last. Germans can make a great glass of bubbly brew. My local beer store is selling these for $5.99 a bottle. Pick one up."
"Bottled on 06/03 which means this is 8 years old. Dark mahogany color, creamy head. Sweet smell of malts, supposedly this is an Altbier but it smells like a Dopplebock. Taste is great and exceptional, fruits maybe raisins. Nice caramel malts and a great sweet brew. Outstanding."
"D: Too rich for more than the one pint, but I would love to have this as an after-dinner snack."
"Drinkability: One of the best beers I've ever had; easy to drink and complex."
"A bit of a mouth takeover in it's flavor and mouthfeel. It seems to coat everything that it touches. Delightful but not sessionable. This beer makes me wish to get in touch with more Alt style beers."
"D: Tasty, and interesting. Not my favorite thing in the world, but I would drink it again."
"Overall a great example of a style which doesn't exist. Imperial Altbiers are really basically doppelbocks with ale yeast but this is really great regardless of what you call it. Thankfully it comes in an 11 oz bottle so you can ration yourself and not have to take an early nap. This beer should be on every beer geek's bucket list."
"Drinkability: This one is delicious. I'd love to sip and savor, but its too good."
"drinkability - at ~$7 for a 500ML bottle, combined with the fact that this is a sipper, I gave this one a grade of 3 on drinkability. Very different beverage when compared to the Pinkus Altbier, which is the only other entrant of this style that I have tried. Good beer."
"This beer pours a cloudy plum-brown color with not too much head. You can smell the concentrated Altbier on the nostrils. The extreme malty, bready, and boozy aroma in this case creates a very strong example of the style. For my money it's a bit too intense on the nose. The flavor is a kind of rum booze mixed with some roasted wheat flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit too sticky for my liking and this is still a good drinking beer. If you want to experience the style in all it's glory, there's no reason you shouldn't get this beer."
"In short: a complex, fruity, bitter yet malty lagered ale."
"m+d- Strong, warming ABV. surprisingly drinkable. I honestly didn't like it at first I think because it wasn't what I was expecting. But it is balanced, complex, full of ingredients, unique and interesting."
"D: This is a might tasty beer. The alcohol is hidden rather well, it has great flavor, and it is a nice intro for me into Altbiers."
"I poured into a pint glass to two fingers of tan head. This beer is a murky brown color. The aroma is dark fruit, raisins and prunes. There is a slight hint of alcohol, too. The taste is sweet and contains the aforementioned raisins and prunes. I also get a little bit of roasted malt and alcohol. The roasted malt lingers as I work on this one. The mouthfeel is thicker than most. This is my first beer in this style. It is not a bad beer. I would probably try this again and look forward to exploring more examples of altbier."
"D- meal in a bottle cliche applies more than ever here i felt the booze but it was totally worthwhile"
"I don't think I'm a big fan of Uerige beers as this is my second mediocre reaction to them."
"Drinkability: dangerously drinkable at 8.5% ABV. The alcohol says sip but the flavor says keep it coming. Plain delicious."
"Taste is frruity, raisiny & lightly spicey with brown bread, rich while wheat bread, light sweetnes and a nutty maple hint. It has a lot of character, great complexity and balance, and everything is well integrated. Feel is firm and somewhat lively. It is exceedingly drinkable."
"The beer a hazy brown color with a tan head. The aroma is a ton of caramel malt with some chocolate and earthy hops mixed in. The flavor is similar. I get caramel malt, earth and dirty hops, chocolate malt and smoke. The alcohol is fairly noticeable and the bitterness from the hops is low. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Glad I got to try this one."
"D-Exceptional drinkability.Smooth and well-balanced.No real sign of this beer's true ABV."
"Impression: Absolutely the star of an evening of great alts. Try this one and you will be an alt fan too."
"D: An outstanding experience!"
"D: I would definitely have another one of these because it has a good balance between sweetness and bitterness, but it's a sipping beer and there's no way I could have more than one in a single sitting."
"O: good, heavy and would only want a small pour of it but very good"
"The bottle flet like a small meal, but clearly worth it. I kept the bottle just because it looked cool. I'd say one of the best beers of its type."
"Looks like the bottle must've cost at least a dollar..."
"D-a malt monster. This one is for true grainiacs. A little too sweet for drinking by itself but would make an excellent food or dessert beer."
"d: This was a blind impulse purchase. I tried and loved an American made barrel aged dopplesticke, plus I liked the cool bottle. What a fantastic experience, rich and decadent."
"Pours a dark brown with a half inch head that stuck around for awhile. Thick, spotty lacing is left on the glass. Aroma is deep, complex, and rich. Dark fruit such as figs and dates primarily with an underlying caramel sweetness. Flavor is rich and sweet. Not as fruity in flavor as was the aroma. More of a carmel sweetness complimented by a dark bread flavor. A touch of dark fruit near the finish. Some hop bitterness helps balance the sweetness. Finally a touch of alcohol warmth at the end. A big body that I have not experienced in an Altbier before. Chewey texture. This beer feels like a meal in itself. Am I in Dusseldorf? Has the old world taste that just does not get duplicated here in the states."
"D: Goes down easily, quite tasty, well done, somewhat filling, though because of the lingering sweetness this is a one and done for me."
"D: Certainly one of the maltiest beers I've ever had, any fan of dopplebocks or English barleywine should try this, it's kind of a hybrid, tending more towards the dopplebock side."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, syrupy, chewy, slick, and warming."
"Up-front flavors of dates, raisins, toast, brown sugar and spice. There's a faint mineal twang, peppery spice, a bit of alcohol. Complex but nicely balanced, malty but not especially sweet. The mouthfeel is rich, almost syrupy and the finish is peppery and dry. This is awesome stuff."
"I liked it a great deal and am very pleased to have at last tasted one of these beers."
"Overall, I'm glad I finally got to try this one. I'd still love to find Uerige's regular Sticke and regular Altbier, but I've never seen them in stores."
"11.2 oz. bottle. Pours a cloudy reddish-brown color with a decent, frothy light-brown head, good lacing. Aroma is fruity, roasted malts, caramel, and a hint of wood. Flavor is sweet, fruity, licorice, roasted malts, a hint of alcohol, and earthy hops. Mouthfeel is medium, oily, flat, bitter, and slightly alcoholic. Very complex beer, more of a barleywine than an alt, lots of flavors, well balanced, warms well, and probably ages well."
"If style points for a cool bottle were available, I'd award some here. This was my first experience wiht this sub-style, so I don't have any frame of reference, but it was certainly interesting. Dark caramel pour, slightly turbid. Malt flavor of toffee and caramel, followed closely by a slightly tangy note that was not quite sour. Finished with bittering without characteristics of any particular hops varietal."
"Good stuff. A bit more challenging than something like Double Bag but much more rewarding."
"D - Alcohol fairly well hidden. Will have to try the regular and single sticke versions next."
"For all the rich malt, the beer is pretty dry. The mouthfeel is full, smooth, and sticky, with a lower moderate level of carbonation."
"This beer is an eye-opener, and I'd say it is to alts what a weizenbock is to a hefe. Everything is intense, rich and powerful. Not a beer to be messed with, but one I'd love to have a case of. Seriously good stuff!"
"Thanks Bobsy!"
"Nice and dark the head quickly disappears after pouring. The smell is mouthwatering and is a good representation of the taste to come. Malty and sweet with just a touch of bitterness, this coats the mouth and fills the stomach. A must-have for dark german beer lovers."
"I would be hard pressed to finish a whole bottle of this beer and I imagine it is presented in small pours fairly regularly. That said, it was a truly enjoyable sipper and I was happy to try this lovely example of the altbier style."
"Really impressed with this beer. I'll be buying another to store in the beer cellar. Bet this will mellow nicely if rested for a few years."
"All in all, this is a beer that is rich, bold, flavorful, and tastes great- what more could you ask for? ~"
"Overall: Feels much stronger than ABV. More bite than I prefer. Utopias probably drinks better."
"This beer really surprised me, which is odd because I didn't really have expectations. First, its dry but smooth. The first thing I taste is the malt, this really is a malt bomb, but it doesn't stop there. The mid-palate there are these odd spices, I can't really identify them, but they are definitely there. Its a difficult combination of flavors but it keeps me drinking. The spice is followed by a short and really bright round flavor that if it lasted any longer would be unpleasant but it is cut short by the back of the mouth dryness. The dryness causes this beer to finish completely. Mouthfeel is great, drinkability is moderate to high, not sure I could drink very many of these."
"D: a different take on the doppelbock. worth looking into if doppels are your thing."
"Mouthfeel is heavy and it sticks to your mouth for minutes. Not very drinkable."
"Full bodied, with ample carbonation. This has to be the stronger altbier I've tried, and I thought NG's Alt was out of character. That said, the alcohol presence was quite in your face, I imagine this is one beer that would definitely benefit from aging. If I ever find any bottles of it, taht is what I intend to do."
"Tasty and enjoyable. Topnotch for the style."
"D - Decent despite the intense palate because this beer is really tasty."
"Deep brown with reddish highlights, thin, off-white head with good retention and lacing. Leafy and lemony hops dominate the nose, with bright citrus contrasting the malt depth that's excellent. Wildflower honey, burnt caramel, dark wheat bread. Excellent. On the palate, it opens with a great combination and contrast of lemony, earthy bitterness and honey and caramel. I've never had this beer this fresh. Dark German wheat bread, with a mild spiciness, almost rye-like, that's probably a combination of the hops, the malt and the alcohol. Fruity, with plums and raisins. Excellent stuff. Medium in body with mild carbonation and a long lasting finish with bitterness and honey sweetness. Great stuff, I must confess that I couldn't drink too much of it, but that was probably a result of the environment in which i drank it."
"D: As drinkable as I would expect 8.5% to be. Not one that I am looking to gulp so I will be enjoying this for awhile!"
"Sessionability - I'm thinking you need to be in Alaska or Siberia to session this beer."
"MF&D - feel is a medium heavy body with an amazing creaminess. carbonation is perfect, just enough to make the beer incredibly drinkable. the only thing affecting the drinkability is the presence of the alcohol, but it is still a rock solid amazing brew."
"While it is kinda alcoholic, I have to say it goes down pretty easily. This is a nice beer, I like it."
"Some similarities to an eisenbock or a strong ale, but lighter than either variety. A little underwhelming, but a decent beer when you're in the mood for something a little different."
"11.2 ounce swing-top bottle. Served in a stange glass, the beer pours a hazy dark brown/ruby red color with an inch and half frothy off-white head. Head retention is excellent, lacing is good. Aroma is very malty. It smells like bready malt, dark fruit, caramel and brown sugar. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, but with the addition of some booze. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a bit creamy and rich with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, especially if you like the sweeter, maltier beers. I have to say this is a pretty good overall brew. I'd definitely buy this again."
"Future outlook: Good stuff. Very reminiscent of drinking a barleywine. I'd be happy to have again."
"Up to the finish, it's difficult to believe that this could come from an Alt base; it seems much more like a delicious barleywine than a strong derivative of Altbier. Absolutely delicious; it's quite understandable why this beer is brewed for the American market, as it doesn't fit in with the vast majority of German beer styles, with only Eisbock or strong Bocks such as Samichlaus even coming close in terms of palatal characteristics. Being a good American Bierliebhaber, I could definitely use another. Soon."
"Drinkability is high here but for the fact I have never seen this at all. Kane says he might be able to acquire this one. Hope he does."
"D- This is definitely a one beer for the evening brew. This is not a sessions beer. Though I do like the thinness to allow for seconds, its just too sweet. I could do more of these if I was eating something salty to balance out the sweet of the malt."
"D - Not very. This is a wonderful beer and a pleasure to drink, but I'd have a hard time drinking more than one."
"Great Sticke Bier:)"
"Overall this was an interesting take on an altbier, though I understand it was a bit beefed up for the American market. Regardless, it's well worth a shot."
"D= This one hides the ABV extraordinarily well. Not one I would session, yet easy to drink all the same. I'll be buying more of this one for sure."
"almost viscous, but not overly syrupy. astringency in the middle and on into the finish. light to moderate carbonation provides tingle and complements the light syrup feel."
"Overall very good. Complex, and malty beer reminiscent of a dopplebock with a hoppy finish. Definitely a sipper."
"A few would be OK, but more than 2 of these and I would be out. Good to enjoy one or two during a nice setting."
"M - Medium bodied, a little chewy, well carbonated. Have this beer bathed and brought to my chamber."
"don't think its any better or worst than that lighter one. certainly another world all together. i appreciate the Uerige Sticke on the basis that it is so complex and so light in comparison."
"Pours a clear dark amber/brown with a smallish tan head. Smells strongly of caramel malts and brown sugar, along with a fair bit of alcohol. Tastes of caramel, raisin, and toffee; overall, pretty molasses-like. Spice and alcohol warmth finish it out. Thick, quasi-syrupy body. This isn't even reminiscent of the classic alt. A bit too ""big"" for its own good."
"D: If you like altbiers this is one for you. This isn't necessarily one I'd return to."
"This beer pours a deep brown color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm cap of lacing. The aroma is of camalized malt, toffee, with hints of herbal hops. The taste has the malty tones of the aroma with the addition of a firm bitterness that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a velvety texture and nicely low carbonation. Overall, this is a fine beer that makes me wish there were more doppelsticke altbiers out there."
"Aroma is full of raisins, malt, deep dark fruit, very winey and complex. Creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is outstanding, surprising for an alt in its rich fruitiness. Recalls a great Belgian quad in the multilayered malty and fruity complexity. Wonderful to savor and sad when its gone--hence wonderfully drinakble. Must try this again."
"Nice and slightly viscous on the tongue. Very pleasant overall and an excellent beer."
"D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is a bit much overall and that does hinder this category a tad. The big malty flavors really work well with the finished product. At times, the alcohol also seems to fade a little and let this beer shine. I can see having another one of these in a session but that would be about it. Glad I got the chance to try this one out."
"for the abv range it's not the best, and the taste is heavy enough that i'd probably not want too many in a row. but i could drink this on a more regular basis if it weren't so expensive."
"This beer pours brown with a 2 fingered light tan head and nice lacing. The smell is of nice toasted malts. The flavor is ver deep, some hints of caramel and chocolate, tons of malt... very smooth. The mouthfeel is very nice and smooth with a nice carbonation level. A highly drinkable brew... minus the price."
"It poured up a very cloudy dark reddish brown colour with a sandy coloured foamy cap. Smell is quite nice with notes of sweet cereals (about a dozen breakfast cereals come to mind), a bit of caramel, some fruity aromas that I can't quite pin down, and perhaps a little bit of brown sugar. These sweet profiles in the smell are represented in the flavour, as well, along with a surprising earthy hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is about where it should be for the style, especially considering the abv. Carbonation, while certainly present, is modest and pleasant. This is a well crafted Alt and seems to be wonderfully balanced. I'm very glad I finally got to try this one!"
"Interesting. I really liked this beer on cask and in bottle, but on draft, the hoppy bitterness was a bit more then I would have liked. Still a good solid beer, but not quite what I was expecting."
"Overall impression is that this is an awesome beer, tons of flavor and character. One of the great German ales."
"This is by far the best Alt I have had. Very glad I picked it up."
"Poured out of a very unique bottle, this beer is about the color of a glass of Coke. As I got down to the bottom of the glass small protein particles were noticeable. It smells malty and bready and the same goes for the taste, with a bit of raisin. It's different from any altbier I've had; it tastes more like a doppelbock. Overall it's an easy drinking beer with a hint of alcohol. It's good but I don't know if I'd go out searching for it again, I'd reach for a quality doppelbock instead."
"Very different than the American altbiers i'm familiar with. Lots going on here, definitely a sipper. I love the aroma of bread and dark fruit, the taste was great as well. My only mark is the alcohol is very pronounced, bringing the drinkability down."
"Wow, a very complex brew, very unique as it hits on quite a few styles. A must try for any beer lover."
"This was my second time having this beer, and I enjoyed it as much as the first. The beer pours a dark brown with a tan head that settles to a couple of millimeters thick. It has very good carbonation and very nice lacing. The smell is unlike anything I have had before. Malty and bready at first, with hints of bittersweet fruit on the backbone. The flavor of this beer is very nice. It starts with a sweet malt profile, but that tapers off to a dry, fruity hop finish that stays on the palate. Although it has a higher ABV, this beer is medium bodied and is very elegant as it hits the tongue. Uerige Doppelsticke is a very good brew, and would make a great after-dinner beer. I couldn't even begin to try to pair this with any specific cuisine."
"This bottle was part of a funky beer run for me -- and this lived up to my expectations. A real treat -- a sipper for sure because of density of flavors, body, and boozy kick. But it was a one and done type of beer -- no way I could have 2 in a row -- I'm not that gluttonous. Get this in the cooler weather and curl up and enjoy. Very very good."
"Drink- A very good beer, very strong yet hidden well considering, not by any means anything but sipping beer but very good intriguing beer of the style, very complex and enjoyable"
"Out of a nifty, swing-top bottle this ""sticke"" beer (a more punchy version of an Altbier), was a very dark, nearly opaque, mahogany/copper color. The head was one finger of fine beige bubbles that retained themselves well as a collar and left streaks of lacing. The aroma was a blend of very fruity esters, raisins, caramel malt, dark fruit, yeast and a little alcohol. The flavors were excellent, very similar to a Belgian Dark Ale, rich and sweet. I tasted lots of caramel malt and toffee first, then dark fruit sweetness especially of golden raisins and figs, followed by alcohol heat, yeast and wheat with a semi-bitter, hoppy finish. Though it started sweet the elements at the end really balanced it out beautifully. The mouthfeel was silky, the carbonation delicate but not at all flat and the body medium/full. This beer really felt luxurious and the 8.5% was well blended into the complex flavors. I have no problem saying it; I think this is the best Altbier I have ever had and definitely one of if not THE best in the world."
"I'm new to Alts. If this is what they are all about, I'm in! This beer has a dark character. But, doesn't go too far. Smokey cedarwood, mellow fruits, and vanilla. Slighty sticky with mild carbonation. Maybe just a bit on the bitter side. But still very drinkable."
"on tap at papago... ruby tinted brown shade of black with a huge puffy off white head. additional aromas of fresh cherries and maple syrup added to the prior review. lots of spice and a hint of alcohol creep in on the palate as it warms. any sugar previously tasted from the bottle is no issue and really nowhere. roasty bitterness and fresh hoppy dryness really clean it up nicely. full rich body with a luscious creamy mouth feel...8/4.5/8/4.5/17/4.25"
"It's always hard to review a beer when you have no experience with the style. This being my first altbier, I would say it was pretty good and I look forward to finding some other examples."
"Assuming my memory holds up, this tastes and smells mighty close to Arrogant Bastard Ale to my untrained tastebuds and nostrils. A short review with equivalent ratings to my ABA review. Pricey but tasty."
"D - The mouthfeel alone makes this beer easy enough to finish in a few gulps. Luckily Uerige Doppelsticke possess an extremely different and unique character as well. Nothing short of greatness; I only wish I had more of it to drink."
"D: Different than virtually any altbier I've tried before, packs much more wallop. Pervasively warming, you have to know what you are getting into if you are jumping into these. You feel every drop, and it was a pleasure."
"Overall: A powerfully strong and rich beer well made. There is no roasted character in the beer but there a good level of bitterness. The malt surrounds the noble hops in turn providing a very clean and easy drinking beer. The mouth feel is astringent but clean and spicy/warm full bodied. You can taste the alcohol in the beer. The finish is a bit nutty and lingers on the palate allowing the drinker to reflect on the style of the beer. I love the bottle and don't want to throw it away."
"I wish for ""serving type"" there was an option for ""cool-ass bottle."" This bottle was very unique. Pours a clear dark, dark amber with creamy 1 finger head. Retention and lacing were minimal though. Smell was strong of caramel and raisin, with a bit of alcohol. Taste was complex, but this was a malt bomb if you ask me. When it was cooler I did notice a slight bitterness, but as it waremed it was all caramel malt with some sweetness, some dark fruit, and some toasted grain. Mouuthfeel was fine, medium-ish or so, reminded me a little of a Dopplebock. Overall a good beer, definitely a slow sipper. The alcohol is somewhat noticable in this beer which lends it to slow sippin."
"I will try this again but I was a little disappointed as far as the experience didn't live up the expectations."
"I really liked this funny little beer, this Doppelsticke (fun name, to boot). It's like a cross between an english barleywine (Nils Oscar comes to mind as I tried it recently) and a doppelbock (think Korbinian), very sweet, doughy, malt but with a ton of fruity tang and a mildly sticky feel. The flavor is mostly sweet doughy malt. It has a vinous and near-brandy quality. It's not as rich as a straight malt bomb. There is a much more delicate quality, particularly in a fruity yeast, ripe plums and bananas, and mineral to earthy hops. I guess there are probably sweet notes of caramel and chocolate lurking, but the sweetness comes through more in a barleywine flavor than most highly malty styles. The beer is a bit sticky sweet. Don't get me wrong. I certainly wouldn't recommend this as a session beer. In fact, it may be getting more difficult to drink as I go through the bottle. It's a lot of sweetness. That said, I would very much enjoy having a case of these to open whenever I was in the mood. Doppelsticke is a funny beer, and I may rarely be in the mood for it, but it's excellent in certain circumstances. Also, it does not seem to fulfill the characteristics of the style, but I imagine the brewery is aware of this fact and doesn't mind being somewhat unique. Also, the bottle is wonderfully, almost clichédly, German."
"D: Tough to finish the whole bottle. I much prefer the Alt. Doesn't do it for me at all."
"This was a great beer, I thought it was outstanding and what all altbiers should aspire to be."
"Served from cask at Redlight Redlight in Orlando. This beer pours a hazy brown with a fluffy head that leavs a bit of lace on the mug. Smell is amazing roasted malt, berry, nectar sweet fig and nuts...there was alot going on in this brew. The taste was amazing, sweet fig with layers of bread, chocolate, earth, stickiness and a amazing hop finish that left it all balance out. This beer was like nothing I have had before, very complex, warm and amazing, with each sip tasting different flavors of sweet goodness. This was such a wonderful experience that I will always remeber; this beer was simply out of this world."
"Thick and viscous. Very little carbonation. I'll be looking for more, and pretty damn interested in trying the other alts from Uerige."
"Deep amber in color with a ruby hue and medium off white head. Decent retention for a big alt such as this one. Smell is rich of sweet malts. Lots of fruity sweetness with raisin, fig, and cherry. Some toffee and light caramel. Also a faint toasted bread. Taste is pretty nice. Good fruit flavors and again, rich in sweetness. A light spicy heat is also present and possibly a spritz of citrus. Mouthfeel is mostly smooth and silky but a bit syrupy at times. Pretty full in body for the style. Still, it's pretty drinkable. Not so much as others but interesting either way. It's good but not one that I'll seek out often."
"Pours a cloudy brown almost cocoa color with a thin beige head that fades qickly without leaving any lacing. Week aroma that is malty with some hops. A little watered down for my taste. ABV well hidden with a nice balance of maltiness and hops s well as a slight nutty caramel presence."
"D: Drinks much bigger and bitter then others by style and really stands out."
"MF&D - Although, I believe the bottle I sampled may have been long pasted its prime, it was still pretty decent. I will definately try this one again, paying a little more attention to the best before date."
"Pours a very dark ruby brown in color with no head forming on the pour. Another beer in 'Clean out the designated beer fridge '08.' Smell is very toffee like with a shit ton of caramel malts. Taste is even more of the toffee and caramel malts. Make no mistake this is a dark, smooth beer. Very well done. This is something that I could drink a whole bunch of. Very nice."
"D: this is odd, i don't know about this beer, i want to drink more of it to get a better idea, but don't know how much i could. this is a different beer. i like it, but i don't know what exactly to think of it. definitely an interesting beer though."
"Definitely a sipper. Easily drinkable but works best if savoring in small doses. Well-done."
"A nice, well-balanced, thick, tasty German beer."
"The rich, creamy body of Uerige Dopplesticke starts with candied caramel malts and quickly transitions to layers of dark, musky fruit and bitter, powdered chocolate. Very impressive taste; the mouthfeel is even better, with a velvety smooth texture that balances perfectly with a peppery, spicy kiss of hops at the finish. The carbonation level is perfect, keeping the body from becoming too viscous and syrupy. Truly a phenomenal beverage...highly recommended."
"This is the first Alt I have ever tried, though it's more like a doppelbock. I think I am gonna have to try and seek out more in this style, as it is quite good."
"11.2oz very long neck swing top bottle. The bottled on date is hard to read but it looks like it says 04-06. Pours a cloudy medium dark brown with a 1 finger head, OK longevity and OK lace. Big malt aromas mixed with caramel & sherry. Big malt flavors too, again mixed with caramel, sherry and a yeasty chocolate flavor. Higher than expected hop bitterness that lingers for a while. Alcohol is present and this is a definate sipping beer."
"This is a very well done beer but is a real sipper. Not what I thought it was going to be. I drank this at about 50F which seemed close to right."
"As a fan primarily of darker brews I enjoyed this drink quite a bit. It pours a deep brown like cola with a thin tan head. Not much aroma there, but detectable hints of sweetness. Taste has a fruity sweetness with mainly fig in it (like a fig newton!) but also apple and pear. I found the taste very interesting, in fact I was not aware that the drink is an altbier, I thought it was a fruity variation on a dopplebock (the appearance and word 'dopplesticke' probably encourages this idea as well.) the malt sweetness was subtle but present with a hint of espresso. Mouth is medium thick and finishes clean with a very faint, enjoyable aftertaste of fig. Subtle carbonation almost like a stout. Its very enjoyable and easy to sip. Doesn't feel like its weighing you down, though I could see the sweetness becoming overwhelming."
"Even with the extra bit of alcohol content, this is very drinkable. A very tasty brew here. If you ever see it, try it. It's worth it."
"I'll try it again, but maybe I'll look for a fresher example next time. Cool bottle, though!"
"Pours a very dark brown color with a small but dense brown head that dissipated into a light cap. The aroma is of toasted caramel malt, fig, raisins/dates, and a bit of spice. Similar to an old ale. The taste is grainy, lightly roasted, molasses, red wine, an odd lemony twang, and rust. Not what I expected from the aroma. The feel is well bodied with moderate carbonation, finishes slightly sticky with a stale hop bitterness. A malty beverage for sure but it seems past its prime, though I'm not sure that it is. Has both good and bad characteristics, its ok, not sure I would seek out again."
"A wonderful little treat. If I ever find a fresher bottle I will be sure to update my review."
"Very interesting flavor profile: it's part alt, part doppelbock, and part bitter. I have to wonder if something like this influenced all the India brown ales we see nowadays."
"Tasted on 4/19/08."
"D - This is a very interesting beer. I don't think it quite fits the 'altbier' style where BJCP-like styles are concerned, but it's a very tasty strong ale version of an altbier. Oxidation clouds what this beer originally tasted like when it was fresh - which was probably really fantastic - but it doesn't spoil the experience at all."
"D-Not what I was expecting from this beer. Tough to drink and enjoy. The balance is just not their and nothing seems to blend well. A bit disappointing."
"Bought it because I like altbiers and thought a ""double secret"" alt would be even better. Nope, bigger is not better. Some styles don't amp up well, maybe?"
"The beer has a rich mahogany color with a thin lacing, swirl it around and the lacing thickens up nicely. Extra points for the cool bottle with the flip-top lid. The aroma is faint, but it's there, and it's flavorful. The taste is astounding. Such a rich, pure, full-bodied beer taste that tickles your bitter senses, but doesn't overwhelm the palate. Has a slight kick, but it goes down smooth and fast. I can't imagine nursing a beer like this for too long. It's so good, you don't even want to take a pause... the glass will be empty before you know it."
"Dark velvet brown body; pillowy half-inch head that settles to a solid brown--intimidating! Tremendous balance of malt, hop and fruity yeasts--pleasantly alluring.... warm, smooth and full-bodied--more like a porter or imperial stout in the mouthfeel... little alcohol to note... coffee and stout-like smokiness that rushes to the throat... malt is most prevalent and balanced with creamy esthers... in reading the ""commercial description"" I can see my expectations were pleasantly surprised... a bit challenging by mid-glass, but overall a warming brew--and at $75 a case, probably not an economic choice when seeking out doppelbocks (which I falsely thought this was)-- weighing that in, still an enjoyable beer to sit with, stare at, savor..."
"Enjoy one, Prosit!"
"Not a bad beer. If you like old ales, brown ales, porters, or anything along those lines you will probably enjoy this one. Recommended."
"Great after dinner beer, good character, but not one I could have multiple of in one sitting."
"Deep mahogany body topped by a 1/4"" tan head that fades quickly to a thin film. Aroma has a lot of brown sugar and alcoholic notes with a hint of noble hops. Flavor is also very sweet and malty, but the finish is balanced more towards the hops with a slight herbal biterness in the finish. After a few sips, the bitterness creeps in but it's definitely balanced by the malt. Mouthfeel is very solid as well, and the drinkability is very good for the ABV. This is a fantastic beer. Wish I could find it more often."
" D: Well suited alcohol...well balanced...great mouthfeel. Very well done."
"Pours out a deep amber tinged ruby with a frothy beige head that stays well put. Leaves some interesting lacing patterns. Smells incredible. The mix of toasted and roasted malts, dried fruits, fresh fruits, toffee, caramel, bread, nuts, honey and earthy hops is just about perfect. Kind of a let-down in the flavor compared to the nose. Malt is not as chewy and rich as I would have been led to believe. Has a nice toastiness and dryness, though. An odd, astringent bitterness starts soon after the sip and just lingers on and on. Also has a flat yeastiness to it. Not my cup of tea. Mouthfeel is rather light considering the abv but there remains a little stickiness and some lively bubbles. Drinkability is OK. It's not a drain pour, but I couldn't see myself buying this again. I much prefer their Classic over this one. Maybe I'm just not big on doppelsticke."
"Pours a light muddy brown color with light head. Smell is thin and caramel like malt mostly. Taste is toasty, creamy caramel, with a tart edge to it, in the way an Oktoberfest might be. Somewhat thin, but smooth. Very drinkable but didn't stand out too much. Still enjoyable."
"Poured into a tulip a nice dark brown color, very nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus creamy off-white head, lots of nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, tones of figs, raisins, plums, toffee, and caramel. The taste is malty, some sweetness, dark fruits, toffee/caramel. Medium body, very nicely done brew. The alcohol is hidden very well, smooth, very easy going down. Very drinkable, this is a unique brew, probaly the first for me with this taste, I've had Altbiers before, but this one is in a class all it's own, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: This has been aging in my cellar for over two years and while it is a little rough on the finish from the oxidization, it is still quite a nice brew"
"Flavors disappeared quickly except for some remaining nuttiness but smooth drinkability made me want another sip asap. Beautifully balanced texture. This is possibly the easiest drinking double bock I've had."
"D: A rather intense brew, and one to sip. The 8.5% comes out through the flavour, but suitably so. I'd take these one or two at a time, but it's intriguing enough to certainly do again."
"Full mouthfeel, moderate and even carbonation, a bit powdery and tanic. Very drinkable, real tasty beer."
"Note: I really need some westy to revive my hope in beer."
"Really fairly thick backbone to balance the high ABV.. again reminds me of a BW brewed by a German... This may be the first time I've had this one, I always seem to pass over it when I see it in the cooler... I know I've had at least 1-2 other Uerige beers over the years, but I think I would remember this fantastic brew."
"A big, flavorful yet balanced Doppelbock. A pleasant lager from a brewery I probably would've passed over: thankfully I didn't."
"11.2 oz bottle with swing top, 05/07. Pours a dark ruby with 2 cm off-white head that is mostly diminishing. Aroma is full of dark fruits, mostly raisins. Flavor is well balanced with dark fruits, maybe more dates now, and bitter hops and some citrus. Medium body, no carbonation, very light lacing, some alcohol noted as it warms. Nice beer and drinkable."
"Quite nice brew...memorable, easy to drink, and bold. I would buy this one again, but at this price, it's more a curiosity and not a stable."
"Drinkability: Not too hard to drink, surprisingly, given its strength."
"the doppelsticke tastes just like the sticke, but stronger and warmer going down, with about the same drinkability. slightly better but only different in that it pours alittle redder, and the nose is stronger. i like this better than the sticke, it has a stronger taste and warms the soul a little more, good beer"
"I am sure I do not need to go into overall drinkability after reading the above comments on this great Alt. I think it was a great easy drink. I would love to pick up a case or two or three of this wonderful nectar."
"I wasn't overly impressed with it, though I would try it again, but perhaps one with less alcohol. The alcohol burn and taste really detracted from the overall experience for me."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily possibly a little to easy for a beer at this ABV level, not too filling, good representation of style, nice strong kick, this beer is certainly unique as it has a lot more sweetness and packs a little bit more punch than most Altbiers. I could see myself drinking a few and it’s an excellent beer overall, but it’s not one that you would want to pound down for a whole evening."
"A really unique beer, very drinkable."
"Pours a dark chestnut with a head that fades pretty quickly. Some lacing. The smell has lots of dry malt up front. some fresh grain, wasa crackers, and powderey chocolate. The taste is similar, but with lots more chocolate- very big, dry, and smooth. A nicely integrated malt bomb with the alcohol well hidden and quite creamy as well. Delicious."
"This is only my second altbier and, while the first was unremarkable, this one has definitely piqued my interest in the style. Keep 'em coming."
"Full/thick mouthfeel,syrupy. Complex tastes more drinkable than i would have thought from first impression. Still a sipper,on the filling side. One of these is enough for me."
"D- A good dark alt, tho I don't recall the astringency in previous samplings. We'll have to compare these notes next time."
"D- one was good"
"Overall- $3.99 for a bottle and worth it. I highly suggest aging this. My bottle was bottled on 05.07 and it was sweet and fruity (4 months in). Give it time to ripen."
"Pretty light though there is a lot packed into the body. Carbonation is on the light side of medium but still a bit higher than I remember from aged bottles. Drinkability is pretty high, though this falls short of the near lethal drinkability of previous experiences."
"A nice beer, brown in color. Has that distinctive german aroma and malt flavor that is unique to German beers. Stronger than the Sticke alt but the hop level was adjusted so it is not sweet, like you get in a dopplebock versus a bock. Pretty fresh beer and it had just arrived in the state and was new on the shelf at Papago Brewing along with the sticke alt."
"I didn't like this at first, but it eventually grew a bit on me. Was it to style? Likely. Did I enjoy it? Only marginally. Uerige Doppelsticke is just too sweet for my general consumption, but it's interesting and would probably be a lot better if I wasnt drinking it on a sweaty 85 degree night in South Carolina. Try it and form your own opinion. At the least youll come away with a swell swing top bottle."
"This really is sort of like a German barleywine...really not like anything I've ever had. On a side note, I find it interesting they brew this just for the American market."
"Thanks jdoolin for adding this one to the trade, it was most welcomed!"
"Bottle courtesy of Plucier: Poured a dark brown color beer with a huge foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of chocolate and dry raisins is enjoyable but definitely not what I was expecting. Taste is comprised of sweet malt with some nice notes of chocolates and dry fruits with a somewhat dry finish. Well done overall but definitely not what I was expecting for and Alt but again it is style that I dont really know too well."
"D: The intensity of the flavor makes this one a sipper, and I think that 11.2 oz is going to be about all of this that I could drink in one sitting. Still, this one is damn good and one to look for."
"It had a lovely bitterness to it, with some big coconut in the finish. It was quite dry, almost sucking any moisture that was in your mouth to begin with right out. We questioned how fresh this was, so it would be nice to taste one that was a bit fresher."
"The drinkaility is good. This would be a killer on tap. Prosit MK"
"Poured with good bubbly, off-white head, that seemed to boil up and then simmer down. Some considerable clarity. Nice auburn and purple highlighting with the darker shades over top the beer. Aroma of esters and roting fruit with a soft malty underscore. Some suggestion of alcohol. The aftertaste lingers with strong malty notes. The flavour note as strong as it should be with the malts faded, the esters weak. The taste showcased alot of exotic fruit notes (like coconut) but oddly left your mouth feeling quite dry. This was alright, but I'm sure alot was lost with age. I'd love to be able to try this fresh (we didn't intend to age it) because I'm sure it's much better than what my first impression was... will re-review!"
"Again a very drinkable brew, ABV putting it up there with many Belgians."
"Very tasty beer, and one that goes down fairly easy considering the alcohol content. My only experience of Dusseldorf was passing through on a train (and doing a double-take while passing the whorehouse near the train station). This beer makes me want to pack up and move there."
"ooh that's tasty. it's the nosferatu of germany. robust, but plenty hoppy (big bitterness for a german beer). sweet and lightly fruity. it's clean, as an alt should be"
"Drinkability- Definitely a beer worth seeking out. Haven't had many dopplesticks yet, but this seems to be style-definiing in my opinion."
"Small pop-top brown bottle from Florian's in Auburn. Copper-red slightly murky translucent body with about a half an inch of off-white head that leavea fairly good lacing. Nuttiness dominates the aroma with just a hint of black licorice or root beer quality to it. Nut, caramel malt, roastiness all play big parts in the flavor with hints of black licorice, fruit, and smoke with a clean finish. Some alcohol warming present, although alcohol flavor is almost non-existent (impressively). A nice and surprising creamy mouthfeel. Drinkable for the abv and body, but I'd still approach this as a bit of a sipper. Actually impressed with this one. An impressive altbier and a damn good lager."
"A slight bit pricey for the dollar to ounce serving, but well worth it and one Ill be visiting again."
"Warming and rich is how this beer leaves you and more importantly it leaves you wanting more!"
"This is an example of a beer that typifies what beer should be. I could imagine someone hundreds of years ago ordering a beer and getting something like this. It's dark brown in color with a very full caramel flavor with a hint of burning alcohol just under the surface. There is plenty of flavor and the mouthfeel is substantial. If this is representative of the Altbier style, then I need to try some more from this style. Definitely a beer worth trying, but it might be difficult to drink more than two of these."
"Cheers!"
"11.2oz. bottle: This bottle gives a new definition to the term ""long neck"". This beer certainly has the longest, skinniest neck on a swing top that I have ever seen. It opens with a loud pfffft. Good color: is is a hazy, slightly reddish mahogany hue with a small head on it. Nice aroma. Notes of toffee, caramel, and some spiciness. An interesting taste. Slightly sweet, with some bitterness at the same time. The taste itself is quite complex. Full flavor, with notes of caramel, fruits, roastiness, and others coming through. A very good beer."
"Uerige DoppelSticke is packaged in a distinctive 33cl swingtop bottle. It pours a deep ruby-brown color with a thin light tan head. Aroma is slightly boozy, with lots of sour raisins, and a little bit of caramel. Maybe some slight citrus flavors as well. Taste is roasted malt, more raisins, with a semi-dry finish - hops are evident in this beer, but there is a ton of malt as well. Amazingly balanced. Almost a coffee like aftertaste. Medium to full body. So drinkable; I wish this beer were more available. My previous exposure to this style was Long Trail Double Bag. While I love that beer still, this one blows it away. I'll have to try the Uerige Altbier next."
"D - A tasty bigger more complex altbier than I have tried in the past."
"Lovely concentrated fruit malt aroma has some mild citrusy tingle in the nose and features fruitcake, baked pineapple sweetbread, bannana nut bread and some toned down caramel accents. Very lovely aroma highligted by the wonderfully malt complimentary pineapple notes. The body of the beer is a ruddy, dusky brown and holds creamy tan head that is about the thickness of a standard Bic pen. The fore is a rich and sweet (low-spice) fruitcake. Baked Pineapple accents here as well. More caramel flavor than aroma...rich sweet and malty with caramel through the middle. The finish is strongly sweet, but well balanced with a firm bitterness. this is one of those beers I always new Id try, but never got around to and now feel silly for having waited so long. Very nice."
"From the characteristic long necked bottle, this beer pours a deep brown-mahogany color that sports intense red highlights. The head is solid and tan. A powerful molasses and fruit smell leaps from the glass. Its mixed with a beautiful malt smell, wood, and leather. Theres a little alcohol aroma, and some mildly roasted qualities. This is certainly the smell of a big, complex beer, but it also has a sense of well-crafted refinement: all of the aromas fit together perfectly. The taste is similar, complex with a lot of sweetness and malt flavorsmolasses again, a little toffee, caramel, ripe fruit, and a modest warming. Despite the sweetness, theres a nice balance without excessive hops. The finish lingers. Smooth and heavy in body. This is an amazing beer."
"The smell is strong, with tons of malt, caramel, some nuts, and a bit of alcohol. The taste is very good. It starts with dark toffee and malt, then adds caramel and some dark fruit. Alcohol and some degree of bitterness take over the finish. The mouthfeel is solid and the drinkability is good."
"Overall: Finally I get my hands on a bottle of this famous Altbier, this bottle cost me $4.03 at HiTimes in Costa Mesa, but damn it was worth every cent. Quality in a bottle. Recommended and Highly Impressive. Lovely stuff!!!"
"Surprising balance, with hoppy bitterness following the malt throughout the sip and into the aftertaste. Smoky and oily in the mouth, but both enhance the flavor instead of distorting it. Terrific sticky lacing as well. Smooth, satisfying mouthfeel goes a way to hiding the hefty abv. Not really my cup of tea overall but you can't hide from quality."
"D-I like it, its full of flavor, and fairly easy to drink, will most definitely pick up more of these"
"Mouth: Malty up front with a bit of a chili pepper flavor. Real thick and yeasty with a very pleasant, long lasting bitter finish. Bitter enough that it tingles up to my ears. Chewy, creamy mouthfeel. Hops hit really hard with a slight grapefruit flavor. As it warms this beer gets fruitier and more enjoyable. Some banana flavor pops through and some chocolate and licorice. It's like a dark, hopped up hefe-weizen. Delicious!"
"Mouthfeel is off slightly and hurts the drinkability somewhat."
"This is an enjoyably complex, tasty ""sipping"" beer."
"Always comes in that oddball, yet so awesome looking bottle The color is a amber maple syrup with some trubby haze. Pretty crappt foam and head. The aroma is stale bread with some alcohol. The tomgue is hit with more stale bread, biscuits and hints of bananas. Ohh yeah, and alcohol. The alcohol is not overpowering, but more than wanted for an alt. But Uerige is the only brewery I've tried any altbier from, so I'm still open to try more beers of this style."
"Excellent for sipping. I plan to store the second bottle that I bought for a while to see how it changes."
"Mostly clear chestnut with a modest, yet solid, head of fine tan bubbles. Lacing is short-lived and coats the glass. Caramel dominates the aroma, but there are fruit and yeast notes that really round it out. Smells delicious! Mild bitterness with a hint of hop flavour to provide a bit of balance to the malt. Sweet to start, caramel and fruit (apple and raisin) follow quickly along with breadiness, then bitterness and alcohol warmth carry into the finish. Refined texture with a full body and well integrated, fine carbonation, though the low carbonation levels leave it feeling just a bit dull. This left a really good impression. It's reminiscent of some old ales, particularly those of higher abv. I'd definitely have this again."
"All in all, a great beer. Drinks like a alt, tastes more like a dopplebock. Well rounded, well made, and much enjoyed."
"This is one of the best beers I've ever tried. I will buy more of these just to keep them for special occasions. If you want a good example of the style this is one to look for."
"Bottled on 0604. Pours a dark reddish brown color with a nice creamy off white head. Aroma is fruity with raisens and caramel that is also a bit doughey. Taste is thick, creamy and complex that is very yeasty and bready with a bit of nuttiness. Overall, this is a brew that is definately worth trying! Recommended."
"Opinion: This is a pretty darn good beer. It will take me a bit to get used to such a bold version of the Duesseldorfer Altbier. I really enjoy it, but it is really in a different class from its traditional cousins. This beer is better aged to enhance the drinkability, but there is so much alcohol here, it makes the whole experience a lot different. This is not necessarily a beer for someone who likes Alts like myself, but more for someone that would like a German Barley Wineif there was such a thing. The hops are such a big player that it really doesnt fit in any other category. It is good and I would definitely drink it againbut it is BIG for the style that I am used to."
"Drinkablity: A fine sipper, I have heard Uerige beers are best fresh, and I believe it."
"Fantastic beer. just absolutely awesome."
"Mouthfeel is smooth, quite smooth. Medium-bodied. And smooth. Overall a nicely flavored brew. The smell is a bit misleading, but I like that the taste isn't as sweet as the nose would have you believe. It's a nice balance of sweet and bitter. Fruity coffee, but not really fruity... just smooth."
"Good, solid, tasty German craft. Some might have a hard time having more than one bottle but would probably seek to get it again at some point. As for myself, I could easily see sitting down with a few of these."
"Notes: One that I'll seek out in bulk. This is the fourth of four and i'm depressed that its gone for now."
"Dark brown hue with a tint of red  nice tan head, small bubbles  nose caramel , red fruit ( cherries and raspberries ) and subtle oats  caramel , cereal , cane sugar, yeast, and honey taste  raw grainy palate - aftertaste brown sugar , cereal , honey , and salty"
"Pours the color of dark rust with dirt and ruby highlights, appetizingly enough. Some carbonation and a relatively small but persistent head. Aromas are of very sweet molasses, spices, and sugared figs; very doppelbock like. No hops are apparent on the nose. On the tongue, the first sensation is one of sweetness, followed by pinpricks of carbonation. The sweetness fades then to metals, then into a long, dry, slightly bitter finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, with medium carbonation. The weight of this beer seems to thin out toward the finish. Overall, a wonderful beer, very smooth, with completely hidden alcohol. Weighty enough to be substantial, smooth enough to be enjoyed often."
"Medium body with little carbonation. Not very easy drinking."
"The only other version of this brew I've tasted has been Victory 10 anniversary so here it goes...appears a slight clouded amber dark copper with a light cream colored head leaves fine even lacing down my glass. Aroma contains complex tart raisin/citrus, anise fruity alcohol presence as well. Taste...alcohol is evident a little hot indeed nice spicy herbal content toasted nut caramel complex fruity notes alcoholic plum raisin mix very good stuff. Mouthfeel is medium bodied slight syrupy texture higher carbonation does tickle the throat light burn on the palate. Drinkability one to savor quite a rare offering that I have only seen on a few occasions, quality but not something I would crave over and over again."
"PROST! Beertracker"
"D: Very dry and quite enjoyable. IPA vs Doppelbock."
"not bad, not great. not much to this one imo..."
"Tawny in color with a fantastic head/would-be lace along the side of my glass. The carbonation was light and undisturbing. Aromas of roasted nuts, slightly sweet goodness and with a backdrop of almost hollistic German hops. Smooth on the palate, almost coating. The hops are in no way overpowering as it is the malt that speaks the volumes here. Again, the fruit notes come through on the tongue. Not for the faint of heart, this one may be borderline on ""knife and fork"" in its chewiness, and that is ok by me. A nice balance of the malt, underlying sweetness, and the hops. A fine, fine brew, to be sure."
"Drinkability- Very nice brew. Not my favorite style, but if you like altbiers this is a great one."
"This is one of the most interesting and enjoyable German beers I've had yet. Reminds more of a French or Belgian concoction than a German, but I never doubted the country's ability to make great beer...maybe I doubted their ability to make 'different' beer (considering their incredibly strict brewing laws). I stand reminded of this country's awesome brewing capabilities."
"The body is mid to full body. Limited carbonation. Overall this should have more of a drier flavor, but still easy to drink. Sticke it to you."
"Drinkability: superb and easy drinking. This was a wonderful find, and is better than the sticke version. Buy this if you find it."
"Drinkbility is great very enjoyable wishing I had another already. Little pricey but worth it."
"A very nice surprise. I was hoping for an equal exchange of goodness for the $5.29 per 11.2 oz bottle price tag. And got it. A special beer for a special price. And worth getting."
"This pours a clear dark brown with a good sized dirty white head. The smell has a real ""bisquity"" aroma. The yeast smell was overwhelming, like walking into a bakery, but this also has sweet malt and maple syrup scents. The taste starts with a creamy feel to it. The flavors include smoked wood,sweet malt, maple, toffee, and just a hint of alcohol. The m/f is medium and chewy with the flavors mixing extremely well. This is an absolute classic. You must try this beer."
"As an additional note, I love the bottles. Took it home to add to my homebrew swingtop collection."
"Pours a muddy brown with a light, nutty brown head. Sweet caramel dominates the aroma, but there is also some chocolate and maybe a slight port quality. The caramel is also the first thing noticable in the taste, but there is also a nice nuttiness to it. Slight hints of smoky peat. The alcohol becomes more noticable as it warms. Sticky mouthfeel. Probably too heavy to drink more than one of at a time, but something nice to relax with at the end of the day."
"Drinkability: Again, the maltiness is a bit much, providing too strong of a sweetness at times."
"A poster child for the Bigger is Not Better movement."
"Uerige Doppelsticke doesn't look quite as spectacular as the other Uerige beers because its darker color is more dull than their jewel-like majesty. In all other ways, however, it meets or surpasses their excellence. Has there ever been a more complex, more deliciously drinkable trio of similarly styled beers from any one brewery? Not as far as I'm concerned. The yummy droplet indeed."
"Drinkability is above average but overall this one was a large disappointment to me. Maybe the beer simply does not travel well."
"D - Very easy drinking, despite its 8.5% abv. Cant believe it."
" Dangerously drinkable! Sessionablity is a personal thing but a wee too heavy for me."
"A clean deep copper colored beer. Has a nice foamy beige head. The aroma is nicely sweet. With hints of caramel candy, some dried fruit and in the background alcohol and maybe just a touch of licorice.The caramel sweetness hits first in the taste. Followed by a quick rush of alcohol. Then some dried fruit and a bit of coffee bitterness with a dry finish."
"Drinkable, but too heavy to have more than 2 a session. Nice beer for a cold night. Wish i could've had some of this over in Deustchland, where I'm sure it surely cheaper & most likely better"
"definitely worth a purchase, a great after dinner glass."
"D - Not great. I wouldn't mind having it again sometime, but it isn't too easy to drink. The mouthfeel more than anything gives problems. It is unsessionable. As for food, it is strong alcohol ad sweet. If a Jack and coke would work, so would this."
"Definetly another beer I would find fresh to appreciate more of what it has to offer, but this isn' t bad at all."
"Rusy cola brown with an off-white, bone-like head that fizzles out quickly. Smells of many malts, toffee, caramel, sweet fruits, nuts, berries, sugar coated cinnamon dusted twigs, and more. Taste is sweet and malty up front, spicy and fruity in the middle, and boozy and drying in the finish to sum it up nicely. Mouthfeel is thick and sweet, drinkability is good, but the sweetness really cuts into me these days. Still a beautiful example of the style. An awesome double alt!"
"Dangerously drinkable for this level of abv.... additionally the taste is subtle enough to be an easy drinker.... I went through the bottle much quicker than I normally do... I could get myself into alot of trouble with this one.... very well done."
"Beer is good. Happy Desseldorf beering. Put me on a plane to Germany now! Quite excellent, really."
"Theres a whole lot going on with this beer. Its dry, sweet and clean and very easy to drink."
"This is a treat, but at 40 cents an ounce, it's has limited drinkability. Great now and then, but 8.5% makes it a one and done brew."
"This beer pours a nice dark amber from a 33cl brown swingtop bottle. Mild hop aroma, not much else. The malt character is fairly strong, the hops are present too. Has a fairly thick mouthfeel, with some definite alcohol burn in the finish. I don't think I've had an alt before. This beer is fairly drinkable, especially considering its alcohol content. Definitely worth a try, but it is on the pricey side."
"Finally tracked down at Premiere Gourmet recent shipment. Not as enjoyable as the others i have had from this brewery. The alcohol was burning me a bit in the nose, in the taste. Smooth mouthfeel, nice appearance in the glass but sourish which some like. Yes there is chocolate malt, which gave bitterness."
"Pours a three-fingered pillowy, cream head that goes slowly and leaves a good lace. Nearly clear amber color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is light hops. Starts with the hops and malts nearly balanced - some sweetness. Finish has some hops. Good Alt. Expensive - $4.99 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Flavor is sticky sweet, with some roastiness and green leafy hops in the middle. A little too sweet for my taste. steep $4.50 price tag makes it one I probably wouldnt visit again."
"Thicker than I thought. Perhaps a bit syrupy or oily."
"Awesome 330 mL swingtop bottle with a really long neck... bottled-on date looks like 04.18 maybe - it's really faded. Brewed especially for the American market as per the Uerige website. Served lightly chilled. It pours an unfiltered chestnut/brown with a half-inch of khaki head that leaves nice trails of lacing throughout. Smells of caramel and vinous malts, green hops/hop oils, sweetness, and maybe some metal - kinda like a dopplebock. It has a big maltiness up front and a big hop background with a thick body that drinks like a meal. Other flavors are burnt malts, raisins, hop oils, leafy hops, alcohol, and a good all-around bitterness from the hops and burnt malts. Overall very nice - a beer that I would come back to - reminds me of a dopplebock with ale yeast. Now to try others in the Uerige lineup."
"Overall, I still prefer the 4.5% alt but this one is excellent as well. I guess this could be a different style. Less of a session due to alcohol level."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" light tan head over a somewhat murky dark amber/light brown brew. Head fades rather quickly, with spotty delicate lacing. Aroma is sweet grains and fruit. Taste is slight vinous, with dark fruits, yet malt still evident throughout, and a light alcoholic close and warming. Flows tremendously easy over the tongue, and drinkability is also excellent, especially for something with a higher abv. Won't be sorry here."
"Lovely."
"Pours a dark brown with a redish hue. Nice head and lots of lace. Smell is sweet, malty and very inviting. Moutfeel is medium with a hint of carbanation. Taste is sweet and rich. You can really taste the alchol in the finish. This is a excellent beer."
" Tastes malty. Very slight oxidation may have contributed some sherry notes, but these flavors don't seem to be off in any way. Big mouthfeel. I will deduct from drinkability because of oxidation, even if it is slight."
"Drinkability- Another winner for tonight! Very tasty and worth picking up for a try."
"Pours with a frothy, fine bubbled tan to pale brown colored head. The beer is brilliantly clear, yet quite dark and amber hued. Wow, the aroma is concentrated and malty with notes of molasses and dark, sweet cake-like notes. There is a hint of cocoa powder, and even something resembling cinnamon. The taste is quite sweet and malty up front, yet it has a spicy hoppiness to it as well. The finish is dry in a sort of cocoa powder way, but some of the malty, toffee-like sweetness lingers on the palate and tongue even after swallowing this beer. This beer is quite rich and concentrated, definitely of bock strength. This almost reminds me of rich, dark German cake or sweetbread that has been lightly spiced. This beer has that characteristic fresh Alt hoppiness that no Bock would have; herbal with even a hint of citrus fruit. This is quite nice and flavorful."
"D: Don't think I could drink more than one bottle of this stuff - very rich. Despite that, it is still a very nice beer worth having from time to time. Quite enjoyable."
"I enjoyed this beer and I am sure I will purchase this one again. Also i would like to try the other ones they Brew!"
"Damned good stuff. Drink it when you see it!"
"Somewhat hazy reddish color. Quickly receeding head. Low aroma-sweet malt-somewhat toffeeish. Malt flavor dominates. Great caramel sweetness backed by a nuttiness that cant be beat. Very soft and velvety tasting-could that be the water? No hop bitterness to be found here. Great mouthfeel. Overall a killer beer. I could see drinking this all night, even at 8.5%. I wish I had bought more. Just great!"
"Taste is pretty similar to the smell. It's very difficult to distinguish this from a doppelbock. There are hardly any ale-like characteristics at all actually, as I don't detect any fruit, and the finish is very clean and lager-like. A nice nuttiness lingers on in the finish. The mouthfeel is pretty crisp but loses carbonation toward the end of the glass and becomes too watery, which hinders the drinkability a bit. Overall this is a very solid offering."
"Presented in a nice-looking skinny long-necked bottle with a swing-top. Poured into my stange, the body is a dark caramel color topped by a good three inches of creamy, sticky, off-white head that leaves some pretty lacing. Aroma is heavy on tangy yeast, with spicy hops, sweet caramel malt, raisin, and dark sugar accented by a significant alcohol presence. Palate is dominated by roasted caramel malt, accompanied by notes of raisins, nuts, brown sugar, and the slightest tinge of hops. Finish is slightly sweet with some warming alcohol. Body is full and just a bit sticky, just about perfect for a robust altbier. Man, this is pretty damn good."
"Outstanding!"
"Pours a medium-brown color that is about slightly opaque. The head is white colored that leaves behind a good amount of lacing. Aromas of figs, dates, and malt seem to come out. The taste is very much malt and sugar dominated with a fruity presence that intensifies as the beer warms. The figs and dates seem to blend together very well. It took me some time to identify these flavors because the malt is so dominant both in the taste and the aftertaste. A few sips leads to a warming alcohol sensation. An interesting beer since I haven't had this style before."
"So smooth for being so big and complex. Classic German flavors to the extreme, something unseen to these beer eyes."
"This beer pours a chenut brown with a slight reddish hue with a tight one finger head,awesome aromas going one very nutty with huge molasses and vanilla tones.This brew exudes complexities even more as it warms,very doughy with molasses and with an underlying nuttiness finishing with a nice herbal/spiciness that rounds it out nicely.A big complex gem here with alot going on flavor wise,glad I got a chance to try it."
"Alcohol is masterly hidden. And this beer is dangerous because it is way to smooth to drink for such a high ABV."
"Drinkability: To me, the alcohol presence seems a little out of context in this style of beer. It's an interesting concept, a dopple-alt, and applaudable. But I'll take their regular old Sticke any day of the week over this."
"So glad this is now in my market."
"11.2 ounce flip-top bottle. This beer pours out a reddish brown color with a small head. Nut and fruit aroma with some toasted malt. Caramel flavor with apples. Hoppy finish. Start out very sweet and finishes moderately bitter. Thick, sticky mouthfeel. No sign of the 8.5%. Great drinkability. I thought the sticke alt was good, but the Dopplesticke blows it away. Too bad it's so expensive."
"This stuff is for real...buy two bottles if you find it. I made the mistake of only taking home one. Purchased @ Cellars Wine & Spirits in Minnetonka, MN."
"Body is almost big, yet slick and almost juicey feeling. Soft carbonation adds to the silky smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable, the 8.5% is well integrated into the brew. Awesome bottle too, definately worth $3.50 a pop."
"Awesome drinkability because I want to sip this beer so slow so I can savor every ounce. This is a beer to pair with gourmet cheese. I found the palate to be simply complex, at no point am I awed or overwhelmed but I am delighted every second. Excellent. I purchased my bottle in Fort Collins, CO (I believe). I want more."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: This beer is dangerously drinkable. I could suck these down all night long. I wish I had bought more."
"cheers..."
"Even better than the normal ""secret."" This is the double dog dare. It is darker, prettier, and with a more healthy head. The aromas are darker, with molasses and dark sugar riding around with the usual Belgian. The same yeasty swirls are in there as well. The flavor is darker with a heavier mouthfeel. Candy sugar and dark malts run the show here. A great sipping brew. Yet again, this would be deadly as a tap version here in the states. But, please bring it anyway. Bottled 0418 and purchased from Dilly Deli in Cincinatti."
"brown, but not opaque, with ruby around the edges. tan head. sweet malty aromas dominate. dark fruitiness underneath that, with some interesting root beer notes. he taste is very sweet and malty. roasted dark chocolate and caramel with hints of coffee. dark fruit flavors including raisin and fig. the root beer from the smell comes back in a subtle way in the taste, adding a unique complexity to this beer. there are also some candied slightly belgian flavors. a little herbal bitterness is noticable, but no real hop flavor. the alcohol is detectable towards the back of the mouth with a slight warming effect. medium bodied, but coating in the mouth with delicate carbonation. decent drinkability, certainly enjoyable, but a little too sweet for more than one."
"clear red beer with some orange-to-yellow highlights. no head, virtual webby coating on the surface with more density around the edges. aroma is puzzlingly bizarre.. glue, bandaids, and cereal left in the sink overnight. sour malts. weird. excessively malty taste that evokes maple syrup with a hard bitterness.. waxy. pretty hot for 8+% as well. aftertaste leaves a puckering tart bitterness.. taking uerige sticke, a decent beer, and making it way too big for gluttonous american pigs. not sure this experiment is a successful one. had the chance to taste this at a b united event and liked it more then. i have one more bottle and will re-review in a few.. right about now, this is not one of my favorite beers. won't revisit unless this was a fluke."
"From one of the great Uerige swing-top bottles with a bottling date of 04 18. Pours a beautiful dark cherry laced brown with two fingers of a beige head settling to a nicely retained cap that leaves quite a bit of lacing. Big sweet aroma--brown sugar, molasses, dark berries--with a solid dose of floral hops in there as well. Taste starts out with a caramal maltiness, some fruit flavors like plum, cherry, and raisin coming through briefly, before a fairly big assault of grassy hops hit---leaving a slightly lingering bitterness which mixes with the alcohol taste as the beer warms. Mouthfeel on this one is somewhat creamy, and dispite the big sweetness, isn't at all syrupy. This is an interesting and complex beer--kind of the barley wine of alts, but in the end it's a little much for me and I'd prefer one of Uerige's other versions."
"I hope they keep brewing this stuff it is awesome."
"Comes in the spiffy looking small swing-top bottles. Opens with a loud pop then pours out a deep dark red with a good sized off white head. Some clumps of lace and a tight cap of foam is maintained. Pretty big sweet dark ripe fruity notes up front with a bit of toasty malt. There is a definite hoppiness going on as well that adds interestingly to the overall aroma. The flavor starts with the same big burst of sticky sweet fruits. A good bit of toasty malts are there as is earthy hops notes. There are some Alt characteristics going on but they are definitely not the focus. Very barleywine like in its overall flavor. A good amount of bitter fruit rounds this out. Pretty thick and sticky this coats with flavor. Damn drinkable as well. A 750 would have been nice. An interesting beer that has some Doppelbock and some Barley wine things going on. Highly recommended."
"Slàinte!"
"Yes! Now this is an incredible brew. Two thumbs up to Uerige!"
"classy flip top 11.2 ounce bottle (Bottled on 4-18, noted on the upper label), pours reddish coppery amber, soft and creamy off white head, leaves some scattered, fine stringy lacing. Spicy, alcohol, astringent nose. Clean, strong, flavorful brew, nutty, malty,rum soaked, crisp and tasty. simply one of the best brews out there, seek it out and enjoy this delicacy. World class sipper/night capper, would be great with some nuts cheese, dried fruits, you get the idea..."
"The taste follows suit in complexity, and is one of those rare beers that has the unique characteristic of having an entirely different taste from the beginning of a sip to the end. Starts a tad sweet, with nutty hazlenut flavors and spices that get you thinking of warming holiday brews. A mild yet crisp hop bitterness leads you towards the end, where you'll find yourself hit with a bit of carbonation and a massive wallop of malty goodness. Cripes! I didn't expect this to be this good. And the mouthfeel...so smooth and velvety. Perfection on that. Slightly warming from the alcohol, but it's hidden well. Definitely somewhat of a cross between a big, malty German Alt and an American Barleywine. Im'a go buy a few more bottles of this goodness, thank'ya very much."
"D- This is a good solid altbier. It has the great malty flavors and a nice hop bitterness with the alcohol warmth to balance. Very nice brew."
"Overall: Really glad I picked this one up at New Beer Distributors in NYC. As other reviewers have noted, it is slightly reminiscent of a barleywine masquerading as an alt, but with a much lighter, less severe flavor and texture. Moreover, the typical alt characteristics hold it together quite nicely. Try this one if you can."
"I'll treat this as a *dubbelbockalt* -- it has the sweet brown pecan pie spice aromas reminiscent of Celebrator ot Traquair House Ale. Creamy textured and loaded with sweet malt flavor, the alcohol pulls away from the roasted bitterness leaving a cough-syrup effect that could become a chore to drink. Sticky, tarry bitterness on the finish."
"Huge, creamy, light brown colored head faded slowly leaving scattered strings of lace. Dark copper, almost mahogany colored beer has a transparent candy hue to it. Sweet caramel malt, candied flowers, and a whif of pineapple in the aroma. Strong sweet malt up front feels fairly thick. Plums and vinuous notes in the middle mix with caramel and alcohol. A mild bitterness joins the party at the end supressing the sweetness in the finish. Mouthfeel is soft and full, but not to the point of thick. My first ""Imperial Altbier", there are plenty of interesting flavors and aromas, but I'm a bit put off by the strangely sweet caramel flavor that reminds of Samichlaus."
"11.2 ounce flip top bottle, thanks MABZ! Bottled on 04.18"
"The mouth is near full, too strong to session but its still a nice brew. Recommended."
"Pours a dark copper color with a light finger of head that falls to a very light coat over the brew. The nose is intense. I get notes of intense almond, roasted nut, light bread and very light raisin. The flavor is less intense than the nose. More hop comes through in the flavor. Its not bitter, but flavorful and light on the finish. There is a healthy toasted nut flavor, but its not as intense as the nose at all. The feel is thick, with a light carbonation. The alcohol plays no part in the nose or the flavor. Not a bad brew at all. I have another bottle that will get consumed pretty soon. An okay brew."
"Pours a brown color with a small head that has poor rentention and leaves little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of caramel sweetness. The flavor is much less interesting than the aroma, but that's not saying much. I really don't enjoy the flavor very much. Lots of caramel. Body is moderate, the drinkability is ok."
"Drinkability and Overall: A unique Altbier for sure, it's lacking something special to really throw it over the edge. You'd think the 8.5% would give it a nice kick, but it didn't. I still thoroughly enjoyed every last sip of it, and reccommend it to anyone, unless they can find the Uerige Altbier Classic."
"Drinkability and Notes  The thin body makes Doppelsticke exceptionally drinkable for such a big beer. This is simply the most flavorful alt beer that I have had. It is a far better beer than the regular Sticke from Uerige and far superior to every other alt beer I have had. Well worth searching out if you have been indifferent to other alt beers that you have had."
"Pours a beautiful dark red/brown. Medium to light carbonation. Small, tight bubbles. Smell is sweet and clean. Candied plums come to mind. Rich, syrup like mouth feel. Caramel candied plums. Definite doppel on steroids taste. Wow. Great taste and texture, but much too rich to drink more than one or two. Would drink every night after dinner however. Would make a great after dinner desert drink."
"Big Ups to BiermanVA for bringing me back a bottle from Boston when he attended the American Beer Fest. Even bigger props to him for managing not to drink it before it got to me."
"taste is carmel like with a fruitiness I can't quite place. Its sweet but not overly at all. Its sticky in the mouth and has a slight carbonation to it that makes it dance in the mouth. A very fine brew indeed"
"Stellar, just stellar."
"This one apparently had been flying off the shelves, which is why I had previously missed it. The beer poured a dark copper color and formed a nice foamy off white head that left trace lace as it slowly subsided. A small amount of carbonation is present. An aroma of caramel, candy, some plume and some altbier elements. The flavor was of caramel, candy and some malt. The body was creamy and the finish is sweet with a touch of astigency. Another amazing beer from them. Now if I could just find some more of it."
"The flavor starts with a splash of yeasty fruitiness (dark fruit skins, apples) that's quickly overshadowed by its deep, sweetish and bready notes of caramel malt. A bold bitterness cuts through the middle, bringing with it some grassy and leafy hops. It finishes long and bitter with a lingering sticky malt that's soaked in leafy and earthy hops."
"This was a special 2-keg extravaganza at Papago, and what a sight and treat it was, but you can read the story on the Papago website. The beer fresh from the tap is a dark beauty with a modest creamy light tan head that lingers long, leaving a fine coating of lace upon the glass. Nose is rich in bread dough, sweet and mouth watering this nose, hints of caramel and even a whiff of hops, apples and a bit of alcohol finish it off, start is sweet and thick with malt, the top is middling in its feel. Finish is delectable with its spicy hop bite, the acidity light and the sweet malt dry aftertaste lingers long on the palate, what a treat it was, had several glasses. Personally, I think it could be called a Barley Wine, and I must say it is the best beer I have tasted in quite some time."
"Very drinkable, very very tasty indeed."
"Pours from the swingtop bottle dark reddish brown, creamy 1/3 inch head. Smell is sweet, very malty. Taste... not quite what I was expecting. Lots of malt sweetness, bready, mollasses, a little bit of fruit and some hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is bready, doughy. Very sweet in the finish. Very very drinkable for an 8.5 percent beer. Very smooth drinking beer. I have however had a lot of beers that were better for $5 a bottle at the store, but this may be more personal preference than anything. I'm still very happy I tried it."
"Can an 8.5% beer be a session beer? This one sure seemed that way as each time I finished the 0,2 litre glass I was pulled back for another one. Thats what world class beers do and its not often one finds a beer this strong this drinkable. Well done!"
"Still an amazing bier."
"Creamy tan head on a russet body and fine carbonation. Sweetish nutty nose with beautiful hop notes. Moderate sweetness, flavors of nuts, dried dates, and light raisin toast. Bitterness is firm, but not overwhelming. Slick and quaffable its hard to believe this is 8.5%."
"Considering the high alcohol content and the almost rough grassy hoppiness, this is quite the drinkable beer. One of my favorite German beers, if not THE favorite (with only the regular Uerige Sticke and possibly Aventinus in direct competition). I'm glad I decided to re-review this beer, because even though I loved it in the past, my palate was not quite developed enough to decipher what I was tasting. It's been too long... from this day on I will make it my duty to go through as much altbier as possible, before it goes bad on the store shelves."
"(Thanks to Longstaff for the heads up on this one.)"
