The only thing I am sitting here wondering about is if Victor's Memoriale is really an Altbier, why did I get so much yeast flocculated in the dregs of the bottle? Enough nitpicking though, this beer is delicious and deceptively strong...really creeps up on you with that last sip.","smmeier819","Jul 13, 2013"

3.58,-12,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"I wanna see if we can get a count of the number of new portmanteau words coined by brewers over the years for their beers' names... Anyway, this stuff pours a clear deep garnet topped by a finger-and-a-half of sandy tan foam. The nose comprises earthy greens, toffee, tea, and a kiss of clove. The taste holds notes of light tea, dry caramel, light earthy greens, light brown sugar, minerals, and a splash of cola. The body is a light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, this was a pretty enjoyable alt, though it did at times come to resemble a dark mild that had been mixed with a cola. Still, not a bad combination in practice...","TMoney2591","Jul 28, 2012"
3.93,-3.4,4,3.5,4,4.5,4,"22oz bomber poured into a 25oz snifter is darker than expected - dark, dark brown and opaque topped with a bubbly ivory head that holds excellent retention and leaves good lacing on the glass. Aromas are fruity, malty, woodsy. Tastes are pleasantly complex with notes of dark fruits, plum, rich dark malt (but not roasted), apple, earthy, tobacco, tea leaf, faint anise and toffee. Mouth-feel is velvety smooth, creamy, nice carbonation allowing flavors to meld on the palate. Overall, I really enjoyed this one for its uniqueness. I wish this was a year rounder - or at least a seasonal offering. Very well crafted!","barnzy78","Feb 20, 2012"

4.59,12.8,4,5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Great ruby amber color beneath a nice two finger head that slowly recedes to nothing. You can barely see the bubbles in this dark ruby beer. The aroma is an awesome fruity, nutty, toasted malt extavaganza! The taste starts with a toasted plum with maybe some brown sugar. The middle mixes in some hazelnuts that move to very grainy but still pleasantly sweet. Nice mouthfeel that is grainy sweet and very well carbonated. Great integration ofthe abv. too. A session beer in flavor and palate. But the abv. makes that pretty unadvisable.","scruffwhor","Aug 22, 2008"

4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Dark reddish-brown color, with a minimal tan head. Aroma is nice, with caramal, chocolate and dark dried fruits dominant. The taste was more roasted than the smell, with a fair hop balance mainly in the background. There is a bit of an alcohol taste in the finish but it isn't overpowering. All in all a very solid beer, though I wouldn't want to drink several of them on a hot summer's night! Would like to see how this one does after being sat down for about 12-18 months.","OHLRangers","May 26, 2008"
4.22,3.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,"Drinkability: A great beer for a cooler day, I was excited to try and consumed on a warmer day.

3.47,-14.7,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"Poured from a 22oz bomber and served in a shaker. This beer poured a deep, dark, mahogany brown hue with a thin head of tan foam that quickly faded into a lasting ring. Some clingy lace was left around the glass. The aroma of the beer was made up of toasted caramel, light chocolate, brown sugar, and some fruit. The flavor consisted of bittersweet chocolate, lightly bitter roasted malts, caramelized sugar, dark fruits, and a bit of alcohol. The mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied with minimal carbonation. Different and a little unusual. Way over the top for the style, but that's what the brewer intended.","mdm46410","Feb 11, 2008"

4.23,3.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours a dark mahogony with a full one finger khaki colored head that leaves a decent amount of lacing behind. Smell is a musty oak and new leather scent. Hints of caramel malt and some dark fruits in the nose as well. There also seems to be a bit of pepper and spice too. Taste is very similar to the aroma. Sweet potato flavor up front with molasses on the tongue as well. A tiny bit of alcohol finds its way in the flavor but doesn't take away from the overall complexity. Leather makes another appearance in the taste with an almost almond like nuttiness in the aftertaste. Somewhat slick feel with a medium body. Warming alchol flavor towards the end. Such an interesting brew. With the few I've had of this style, this one is easily the best. Glad I had the opportunity to try this one, hopefully more breweries will attempt this style.","BeerTruth","Oct 18, 2007"
4.22,3.7,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: I unfortunately only picked up one bomber of this while in Illinois, and am now disappointed I didn't get more. A great, flavorful beer I could drink all the time.","beveritt","Oct 17, 2007"
4.18,2.7,4.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"A deep blackish brown body yeilds a ruby glow on the edges when held to light. Head is a two finger perfect tan that leaves thick frothy lace. Nice wheat and malt balances dance with a hint of sweetness and dark fruit on the nose. As it hits the tongue you get a very rich malt backboned beer. Smokey feel is even and well balanced with slight rich sweetness. This beer drinks very easy with nice character. Mouthfeel is very thick and glazing. Meaty rich and long on the mouth which translates well into the overall taste. Nutty and burnt biscuit like notes do also develop as you enjoy this one. A success of a beer in a tough time for the brewers.","SPLITGRIN","Aug 23, 2007"
4.1,0.7,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, some carbonation, tiny fizzy head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is mostly malts/caramel, and some toffee/vanilla.

Very drinkable, this one goes down real smooth, highly recommended.","Wasatch","Aug 07, 2007"
4,-1.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Victor's MemoriAle Altbier can't touch the excellence of the Uerige altbiers, but it's one of the best American alts that I've ever had. Only Heavyweight Stickenjab (R.I.P.) and Victory Ten Years Alt can compare. This is a worthy member of the Two Brothers Artisan Beer series and was well worth the price of admission.","BuckeyeNation","Beers"
3.8,-6.6,4,4,3.5,4,4,"D/notes: I think attenuation is the big issue here. Those strong flavor characteristics need some more alone time and a reduction in sweetness would help in terms of drinkability.","Nipitato","0"
4.35,6.9,4,4,4.5,3.5,5,"The beer poured a cola-brown color with a tan, long-lasting head. Great biscuity malt aroma and flavor, with just enough hops and roast grain bitterness to balance. The dryness helped offset the weight that must have gone along with all that malt, making it an easy drinker out in the summer heat and sun. No idea that it was nearly 8% ABV until I looked at the stats on the beer here before I posted. Maybe if there's enough of an outcry we can get Jason to brew this one again like we did with Cane & Ebel.","MillRat","Jun 30, 2007"

3.63,-10.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,3,"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4" tan head over the clear burgundy brew. Head holds well, with ample lacing. Aroma is lightly of dark malty and fruitiness. Taste starts with fruity roastiness, goes a bit dry in the middle, and closes with hints of hoppiness. As it warms, the nuttiness comes out and balances the fruit well. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both okay, but this one just doesn't come together well for me. The late arrival nuttiness helps though.","ppoitras","Jun 07, 2007"
4.37,7.4,4,4.5,5,3.5,3.5,"The taste is molasses and more dark malts with a somewhat nutty finish. Reminds me of hazelnuts and almonds.

Taste is very malty, roast, toffee, some fruits, bread, bit of chocolate, solid bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, low carbonation, alcohol is well hidden, shows itself as some fruitiness. Nice shot at doing an 8% altbier, this works pretty well.

4.3,5.7,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Quite dark brown with a deceent head, but one that dissipates quickly. There are aromas of rye, an undefined graininess, mint, and some sweet maltiness toward the end. Really nice flavors here with lightly toasted grain, some bitter hops in the background, and some nice bubblegum flavors on the finish. The mouthfeel has good body, but its a little grainy and perhaps a tad heavy for the style. Very drinkable, just delicious. In the U.S., just rivaled by the 10 year alt from Victory.","Georgiabeer","Apr 20, 2007"
3.05,-25.1,3.5,3.5,3,2,3,"It pours a coffee brown with a very minimal head (less than a cm). Aroma is light, pleasant, and toffee-ish. Flavor is slightly sour and heavily caramel-y...more like a bock than I expected. The sourness seems slightly off to me, and I must say that the mouthfeel is over-carbonated, which is odd given the small amount of head when I poured it. This beer is also sticky in your mouth, which in my opinion is consistent with the style. Still, I must say i was a bit disappointed with the flavor of this beer.","BeerBelcher","Apr 08, 2007"

4.18,2.7,4,3.5,4.5,5,4,"This one pours a nice medium to dark brown. Purists would say it's too dark; they would probably also call this a dopplesticke, as it is rather strong. I didn't get much a head with my pour, but what foam was generated seem to last, leaving some thick lace. The body is just about right, medium, with a smooth as satin mouthfeel. The malt flavor seems predominant with burnt caramel and hints of chocolate and coffee (just little bits though). The bitterness at the finish is solid and nicely assertive. Overall, one of the Two Brothers best offerings so far.","marcobrau","Mar 24, 2007"

Toffee blends with a little nougat like maltiness and caramel on the nose with a backdrop of slight minty hops. Good nose. The taste up front is that of toffee and nuts and caramel and nougat. Even with the 34 IBUs, this is a malt dominated beer. And that's not a bad thing either. The hops add balance to this beer and a little dryness to the finish. Somewhat velvety mouthfeel. Medium-full body. At 7.8% a/v, this is quite a hefty alt. Sticke like in strength and texture. Not quite as good as Uerige, but this stuff is pretty damn good.","Bighuge","Mar 15, 2007"

While I've only had a few other varietals (and I'm using Zum Uerige as the standard), this seems a bit too malty to fit the style. A more pronounced noble hop presence along with a slightly thinner body would put this in the same league as anything from Duesseldorf. Style guidelines aside, the beer is delicious. I would almost categorize it as an ale equivalent of a Doppelbock. It's not going to displace Zum Uerige Sticke in my cellar, but a wonderful offering in its own right.","Windigstadt","Mar 05, 2007"
