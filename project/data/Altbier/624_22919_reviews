"On-tap. Pours a lighter brown color. Tan head. Smells malty and Germanic. Flavor is yeasty with dark grain, dark bread and caramel. I enjoy the Altbier style and this one seems to fit right in line, although my experience with the style is mild at best. I loved its light body. One of the first craft beers I have ever tried but had it again and it sparked some nostalgia."

"This beer is a tad on the sweeter side and while nothing amazing, it is an agreeable, everyday brown ale that most will find good enough to recommend. As I said, it is very approachable and makes a good choice when you want some brown ale to serve guests and don’t want to offend anyone."

"O - nice beer. Not up to the german alt style at all but a pleasant American brown ale variant."
""

"This is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. This beer exceeded my expectations; I've never had a beer from Tuckerman's before so I'll have to make it a point to try more."
"Enjoyed on tap at The Thirsty Moose. A bold tasting malt with nutty elements of a brown ale. An acidic tartness, unexpected.Sweet malt in the aroma. Very dark red and lacey. A bit watery. Not so drinkable, maybe another place another time would yield better results."
""
"Overall, a nice surprise. A few flaws, but it still works. A good one from these guys."
""
"Good solid beer from a brewery I don't know a ton about. If I see another sixer of them around I'll probably be picking it up."
""
""
"O- A very unique taste for me...first alt type beer. I like it. Will try again."
""
""
"O: All in all, this is nothing special. This brew seems to bring nothing new to the style nor does it really take anything away. It's a very mild interpretation. This may be a good BMC to craft conversion brew."
""
"O - A nice earthy beer with enough flavor to please the palate. A sublime altbier."
""
""
"D: Fairly balanced – just leaning slightly to malts, but with fair bittering and bit of hop flavor. A rather nice rendition of the style."
"Certainly the better of the two from the 12 pk of these and the pale ale. This one is a good session beer that is slightly heartier than another popular alt from northern new England... And more sessionable as well!"

"Single that I picked up a while back and opened tonight. Poured into a Irish style pint glass. Dark auburn colored body. Great amount of carbonation surging upwards, and a nice amounts remains as I drink. The thin white head forms, and just doesn't go away. It stayed intact the whole time, which doesn't seem to happen very often. Not much lacing though. Smell had some nice notes of brown sugar and caramel. The flavor was dominated by malt. I enjoyed the hearty nutty taste and the creamy mouthfeel. The low abv is a bonus, as I could see myself quaffing a few of these. Very drinkable."
""
""
"I'd get this again."
"Draught @ Barley Pub: This one poured a clear, dark caramel color. There was a small off-white head that didn’t linger or leave any lacing. It has a lighter aroma. Some caramel notes, some toasted malts also. The taste is nice. Some toasted caramel malt, with a very faint chocolate malt taste. Slightly bitter, with a bit of a dry finish. Nice."
"Overall not bad, nothing special, a but lighter than I expected, but a nice malt profile, maybe a bit light on the hops as well."
"Overall not too bad but feels a little downplayed. The spice angle on this is totally unexpected and a nice touch."
"Overall a very drinkable session beer, fresh, fruity, nutty, and refreshing. Fairly light for the style, but the low ABV keeps it so drinkable. What it does, it does well, and I would happily reach for another."
"O: This is one of my favorite ""dark beers"". It is wonderfully balanced in flavor and much lighter in feel than most dark beers, but is still able to hold up to a full pizza such as those at Flatbread where I get it regularly."
"D: Great flavors, well balanced, easy to drink. What more could you ask. It is a wonderful beer in it's simplicity!"
"A nice looking beer. Brown with a reddish hue and a dense tan cap. Lots of chunky, clinging lace. Good head retention. Malty aroma, roast, cereal grains. Mild bitterness up front was more prominent in the finish. Malty throughout, roasty, some dry astringency. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation."
"Glad I tried this but not something I'll be seeking out again."
"eh. goes down ok. Would be better if not for the metallic aroma and ""chewing on tinfoil"" flavor. It is not the dominant quality, but it is there, and it detracts a bit."
"D - Love the amount of flavor packed in to an under 5% ABV brew. I could certainly have a few and not complain one bit."
"The feel to this beer is medium to light with a nice drinkable feel. It goes down well and makes for a good session ale."
"D very nice. Incredibly flavorful. Great grainiac beer."
"D: Quite drinkable. Although not my favorite of browns, I would definitely buy myself another round of this."
"D: Good, solid drinkable beer."
"The brew is a nice chestnut brown witha rocky, foamy tan head, leaves nice lacing. Nice clean malty aroma. The flavor shows an excellent balance with malt and hops that makes alt such a refershing and drinkable style yet with a toasty heft. Really nice job!"
" A light crispy and jazzy malty feel and flavor, light biscuit, dark wheat bread, dry, spicey hops and sour from the yeast. A most excellent balance, clean light feel keeps it going strong for a long session!"
"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of February ('10). Sampled on December 31, 2009. It pours a maple syrup-brown with three quarters inch frothy, long-lasting beige head. The aroma has a kind of perfumey-wooden note to it as well as a welcome cleanliness. The taste is slightly bitter with a sweetness that comes up on the tail end. A nice brew."
"Even being less then inspired with this beer, I can see casually consuming a few before really considering to put up an effort to change speeds. :)"
"D - Good brown ale although I am not sure if I would buy a six-pack."
"D: I had this at ACBF and I liked it more there. Probably because it was a little bit cooler. A really nice beer. On the plus side their staff are class acts."
"Simple, balanced beers don't get their fair shake a lot of times... it's hard to give a 5 for taste if it doesn't knock your socks off, but sometimes you aren't looking for a complicated beer to appreciate, just a simple one to enjoy. I think this may be that beer."
"D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, very mild kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice mild beer with some substance that is worth drinking for a whole evening."
"Out of a bottle purchased in Lancaster, NH this ""German Style Brown Ale"" was a deep garnet/ruby red color with three fingers of tan head. The retention was good as a small cap and the lacing sticky. The aroma was of toasted malt and dry grains. The flavors were similar, very dry and neat, toasted malt and hoppy bitterness in a good balance. Not complex, but on-point for the style. Rather acidic. The mouthfeel was a little oily, the body medium and the carbonation par for the course."
"Strikes me as more of a brown ale. A touch of ale fruitiness hangs faintly in there, no notable hop presence - but the bottle dates to march 08, so I suppose that's to be expected. Mouthfeel is pretty light with a little nutty oil, medium-to-high carbonation. Solid sessioner, not sure if it's quite right as an Alt, but I'll rate it as a none-too-shabby brown."
"Although I like this beer, I feel that the dry hopping goes overboard, and overshadows the malty sweetness of the alt style. But still, very good."
"I like their pale and stout WAY better."
"Pours dark amber, light mahogany, dark tan medium bubble head, showing some retentive powers and leaving moderate spots of lace on the glass. Light sweet, malty nose with a minor hint of smoke. Malty brew, caramel, vanilla, honey/malt sweetness smooth on the tongue. Again some very light smoke picked up late and dove tailing with drying yet smooth hops. Nice U.S. take on the style. Pleasant and respectable sessioner. Would work well with BBQ and/or as part of a marinade."
"D - paired with a clam chowder it was perfect after a long day adventuring in conway NH."
"12/10/2004. Sampled on tap. This is a new Brown Ale that's been introduced by Tuckerman brewing. I thought it was pretty good. Brown-copper color. Flavor is rich malts, semi-sweet, with a slightly bitter hop finish. Malts are strong up front and the rest of it seems rather weak. I'd get it again though."
"drinkability - Easy drinking. One of those beers that go down real easy. Very nice brown beer to taste."
"I haven't had all that many alt beers, but if this is representative of the style, I think I've been missing out. This is a very nice beer that pours a dark amber slightly cloudy color. It is quite carbonated with a slightly soapy tan head that hangs on and laces nicely. The smell is a nice balance between malt and hops, perhaps a bit nut brown or chocolatey hints in there as well. This beer is exceptionally creamy, quite mellow, with soft caramel and nut flavors, and a nice balance. The taste is mellow, perhaps slightly tilted to the watery side, but there are plenty of roasted notes in the flavor to keep it interesting. Between the prodigious carbonation, the creamy mouthfeel, and the light brown tastes throughout, you can't go wrong. There is a bit more hop in the finish, but this is just a really laid back type of beer that would suffice for all occasions. L'Chaim."
"This brew pours a solid brown with a thin layer of foam. Smell is a bit of roasted malts, some caramel, and some chocolate, and a slight hint of hops. Taste is more of the same - a definite nuttiness to this one, along with a solid dose of hops. Pretty tasty overall. Mouthfeel is solid - good carbonation and a nice feel. This would make for a pretty nice session ale overall. It's low ABV and solid flavor would allow you to drink quite a few."
"Pours a solid brown that shows some ruby highlights when held up to the light. Two finger off white head that dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lacing on the way down the glass. Smell is a bit roasty, chocolatey and some caramel thrown in there too. Taste follows the smell, but adds a hop bite in the finish. Medium thick creamy smooth mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. I am pleasantly surprised this is a great little session brew from an up and coming local company."
"Served in a standard pint glass. Poured opaque brown with some red highlights when backlit. Three-quarter inch off-white head, slowly dissipated into quarter inch layer of foam that retained its volume through the session. Fair amount of lacing with decent consistency throughout the tasting. Nose presented with roasted malt and hops. Taste similar to nose with addition of a slightly floral aftertaste (slightly bitter) at the finish. Nicely effervescent mouthfeel and low abv makes this a good session beer and a slightly different alternative to an English or American Brown Ale with slightly more emphasis on the hops than the malt."
"D: A little hoppy for the style, but works well with the mix of flavors. The carbonation adds a nice kick. Overall a very easy to drink beer."
"The beer pours a nice brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, roasted scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and special roast malts. It also has a light hop aroma. The taste is decent also. It has a crisp, brown ale flavor with a mild hop finish. It's not as malty as some altbiers. It's dryer with a more roasted component. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking beer, but there are better alts on the market."
"It's a nice American interpretation of a German Alt. A bit hoppy for the style, but not overly so, and it works well here. Certainly fuller in taste and body than some other American interpretations. Drinkable and enjoyable!"
"12oz brown bottle with a cool picture of a winter climber braving the headwall. Best before month notched on label. Beautiful brown color with lots of fluffy head that stays and sticks. Very tiny sediment keeps it from being perfectly clear. Smell is a wonderful blast of fresh and clean toasty malt. Devoid of fruitiness in the taste as an alt should be; the clean malt flavor dominates. Hops are to balance and lead into a lime-like finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and leaning towards creamy. Most of the alt beers out there are of a copper color with a medium crisp carbonation, and this one is brown and smooth but still retains that clean malt alt beer characteristic. It's uniqueness is a reason to seek out, and it's flavor is a reason to keep going back to it."
"D: Easily drinkable. Quite sessionable. A good take on what I would define as an American Alt."
"Drinkability: I like this one, quite drinkable. Alcohol unlisted, but likely low enough to be drinkable."
"pours a chestnut brown with a white fluffy head. good residual lacing. smells of malt and sweet yeast. the taste is really well balanced. good bitterness all the way through. nice malty characteristics. nothing overpowering, balanced is how i would sum this beer up. very dead on for the style, another beer to make new hampshire proud."
"Pours a dark reddish-brown color with a wispy head. Malty aroma with a bit of toastiness. The roastiness comes across in the flavor in a big way, followed by a bit of hop twang. As others have noted, there is a bit of a tea flavor that shows itself between the malt and hops. Pretty well balanced and not overly sweet. I don't know if it's a good representation of the alt style, but it's a pretty tasty and enjoyable beer."
"The flavors of an Alt are present, but are limited by the dryness and carbonation. A decent version of an Altbier, but not my favorite depiction."
"A good take on the altbier style... pours a clear, chestnut brown body beneath a creamy head of light tan. The head retention is average, and it drops shortly but leaves some nice lace before it goes. The body is medium and it has a delicate, fine-bubbled median carbonation. The nose is malty with a delicate note of caramel, and that's true for the flavor as well. It's not meant to be complex, just balanced. Solidly bitter, as it should be. It lingers on the tongue with some mild residual leafy hop notes and a dull bitter note. Enjoyable. Probably worth trying."
"This altbier poured a clear, chestnut red-brown color with creamy, fluffy, tan foam that slowly settled, and clung and coated the glass. The smell was malty with a touch of caramel. The taste was lightly malty, not sweet, with moderate hoppiness coming through, and a touch of yeast. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry with medium body and smooth carbonation. The aftertaste was light lingering malt and mild hoppiness. This was a very nice, German style altbier."
"This was a dark brown beer with reddish highlights. It had a thick coffee-colored head. Nice looking beer. It had a roasted grain aroma, and I thought a touch of nut. Taste was sweet caramel, malt, a bit hoppy, and again a touch of nut. A heavier beer than it looked; a couple of these at a time would do it for me."
"A very good brew and one I'm pleased to have picked up on a whim. It can't hurt that I got a free pint glass out of the deal. It looks like this brewery only has a few offerings thus far; hopefully that will change in the future."
"Drinkability is OK. Two or so go down well. Not really a session brew, as the metallic flavor tends to build up rather than fading."
"This is an excellent offering in the world of brown beers. I'd love to compare this (German) to a traditional English brown."
"Deep coffee amber color, thin head that leaves a frothy crust. Aroma of lightly toasted, cinnamon nut and coffee bean. Taste is a robust, toasty biscuit like flavor that fades leaving a slight bitterness toward the end. Less complex than the aroma suggested, but a flavor that makes it easy to drink. Medium body with soft, foamy carbonation. This one drinks pretty well, but could use just a bit more excitement to make a session ale out of it..."
"Medium brown on the pour, hazy with small flecks of yeast floating about. Generous, fizzy, almond flesh head, settling into a thick film. No lacing. Floral hops are readily apparent in the aroma, with grainy, slightly roasty malt. A bit chocolatey. The flavor opens with grainy malt, just a bit charry and chocolatey. Fairly clean, with some ale fruitiness, perhaps a bit too much for an authentic german alt. Everything from the fatherland seems to be clean as a whistle. Lighter medium body, with sturdy carbonation. Pretty easy drinking. More of an american brown ale with altbier traits. Nevertheless, it's a tasty beer. Grainy through and through, with robust floral hops in the finish. A touch of citrus, giving it that american flair. Moderate bitterness, a little bit of metallic flavor in the end, finishing clean and dry. Very much a darker american ale, rather than anything german, reminding me of mid 90's microbrews. A little rough around the edges, lacking refinement, but that's what you like about them."
"Tasted: 07/15/06"
"Overall a nice beer. I think it improves greatly as it warms. I think with a thinner body, it would be a regular for me. As it is, I will enjoy it on occasion."
"PS- I'm finished and the lacing is still on the top of the glass. Nice!"
"Poured a hazy copper color with off-white creamy head. Attractive lacing as the head very slowly fell. Smell is very light with some slight notes of roasted malt to be found. Taste is pleasant with a nice roasted malt characted combined with an impressive hop background. Very nice creamy mouthfeel. An enjoyable beer"
"pours a dark chocolate color with a big foamy head that settles into a 1/8"" creamy head that stays throughout the whole beer. Spicy aroma with some roastiness. Taste has a slight chocolate tinge, roasted malt, slight toungue burn, carbontion?, a little citrus on the back of the mouth. This beer is drinkable, I don't know if meets the Alt ber style but an all right beer. Saw this on tap along with the BMC choices, I would gladlt order this."
"A clear, light brown color with some red tones. Head was fairly small. The aroma was of malt, coffee, hops, caramel and a whiff of alcohol. The taste was more towards hops than malt, with a burnt toast flavor in the finish. No metallic in main or aftertaste. The mouthfeel was very crisp and astringent. Overall, highly drinkable and light."
"Beer poured a reddish-brown, with a well sustaining fluffy white head. Nose is sweet and malty, very pleasant. Taste at the beginning was very malty but the hops are becoming more prevelant now, almost astringent. Mouthfeel is ok, but a bit thin for the style. Overall drinkability is pretty good. This is worth a shot."
"D: Appearance and smell started off good but went down hill from there."
"D - high, easy down, would be great for a beginner"
"DI dont care for this one much. Not what I was hoping for at all. Im thinking that I might not like this style very much."
"D- A great job at tackling the Altbier Style, very tasty and paired well with some grilled bratwurst. I was happily surprised to see it in six-packs in MA."
"From a 12oz bottle ... copper color with rocky, off-white head and little lacing. Nose is warm, nutty, and a little bit of fresh baked bread or muffins. Palate is likewise - quite malty and bread-like, with only a slight hop presence. Enough to make the finish relatively dry and keep the mouthfeel from being cloying. To me, there is nothing exciting here. It's okay, but it doesn't stand out in any way. I could taste any number of brown ales that would be very similar, and can think of several that are much better."
"This was my first Alt. From what I know of the style, it seems to be apropos on most criteria. The tea note is kind of weird to me for a German-style beer, though."
"This is a well balanced very tasty brew. Easy to drink and very pretty in the glass."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" light tan head over the clear copperish brown brew. Head fades slowly, with average to good lacing. Aroma is grain husks, with light hoppiness. Taste is nicely balanced, with the medium malts dancing with the rounded hops throughout. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, and drinkability is very nice. I can see this beer again in my fridge."
"Had a last, lonely bottle I was holdeing onto. But now that I know it's finally available in MA, I'll be going out to get me some more. Pours hazy brown-gold with an impressive head. Smells like it was made yesterday, it's still so fresh after being in my fridge for a month and a half. All the classic components come through one at a time: citrus, hops, (coriander?- nah, it couldn't have been-what is that I'm tasting?) but the slightly malty finish wraps it all up in one clean punch. This is a damn fine brew, and it's a real treat to finally have another beer from these great folks!"
"moutfeel is pretty creamy but without being too heavy. pleasant and enjoyable, decently drinkable. this stuff is alright."
"Pours a two-finger white head that fades slowly leaving some lace. Not quite clear deep amber color. Vague malty nose. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Starts with a good mix of malt and hops, some sweetness, finish is clean and smooth. No real difference between the bottle and on tap. $1.30 for a 12oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH."
"Drinkability is not very good. I only got this because I'm a fan of the Alt style."
"Taste: Okay, the taste conforms a little bit more, caramel malts dominates and has a fruity mouthfeel, maybe again, a little too much hop finish. Brewed to style? No. Enjoyable? Much more than their Pale Ale which tasted too infected to review."
