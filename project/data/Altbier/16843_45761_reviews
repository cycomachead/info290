"O- easy drinking and malt forward, for the most part"

"TASTE: Very malty, massive bready character, brown malt, dried grass, faint apple, toasty, herbal hop, light spice, breath of alcohol, toasted grain drying finish"
"A sweet, slightly crisp, slightly bitter, appropriately malt-dominant Alt.  There's really not much to say about this somewhat turbid, orange-brown beer: it's a very solid, very conventional alt.  It doesn't have a lot of depth, in terms of character or flavor, and it's even a bit thin in the mouth, but it basically subscribes to the general premise of Alts.  It's drinkable, if a little malt-dry—mostly toasted biscuit, and a bit of nut—and its hop-bitterness wavers in the wrong direction just a tad—not cleansing as much as it should; lingering more than it should—but it's an altogether competent, drinkable brew."

"Overall, this is pretty tasty with a nice combination of fruits and malts.  Would like a bit less sweetness."

"Overall: Another solid example of the Altbier style. A good choice when you want something middle-of-the-road in terms of flavor complexity."

"O: Why doesn't every brewery have an Alt-Bier? Seriously. This is my favorite at Hangar 24. This beer is just asking me to go down to the Gourmet Pizza Shoppe, order the Peter Pepperoni, and sit back and forget about how I've probably aged 5 days in the last 24 hours."

"The Verdict: Not bad. I met California based Hangar 24 at a beer fest and they impressed me. This isn’t their best, but it’s a decent sample of the the style with plenty of flavor."

"Terrific alt-bier, provides good flavor and complex for a session beer, stands out in its own category. Impressive offering, and good value."

"Pours a clear golden amber color with a foamy root beer colored head. It barely has any nose at all. Toasted malt aroma. Mild to medium bodied, wet mouthfeel. Notes of chocolate and coffee with a distinct fresh chili pepper finish. An interesting beer."
""
""
"Nice sweet start that brings up this brown sugar caramel-like flavor and rounds out to a flavor reminiscent of eating a toffee bar with chocolate and nuts. Very nice and simple flavors coming off of this beer. It's smooth and medium bodied, with little carbonation. Its a solid Alt bier that I'd love to have again."
""
""
"Overall an OK beer, not sure I would buy again instead of Alaskan Amber."
"Decent beer but nothing too spectacular. Will keep giving Hangar 24 a try though, looking for one I like."
""
""
""
"O: I had to look up the style to see if it was an ale or lager, because it has some characteristics of both. This is a very tasty, easy to drink and seemingly very well-made beer. I would gladly drink this again."

"Overall: A pretty good alt bier with drink again next time I go to Hanger"

"Pours a clear copper with a light tan head that settles to an oily film. Chunky streaks of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of bready malt and some slight fruity aromas. Taste is pretty much the same with a nice herbal hop finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a pretty good carbonation level with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good alt beer with a nice malt and herbal hop flavor."

"Pours a nice rich mahogany with a thin off white head that recedes into a thin layer on the beer. The aroma is really nice. Lots of toasty, bready notes balanced with some caramel sweetness. I get some apple/pear fruitiness on the nose but again none of it is overpowering. Taste is more of the same with a good amount of hop bitterness to balance the roast and the sweet. Mouthfeel was fine, didn't detract from the beer but felt appropriate. Overall this is a really nice, well balanced beer. It has depth but is not overly complex. The flavors are sticking in my mouth and leaving me with a really nice aftertaste, this beer just keeps on giving. I will definitely seek this one out again."
"O: Really to be honest, aside from their barrel roll series, this is the finest beer I've ever had from hangar. I've had multiple beers of theirs multiple times, and frequently I've just kind of shrugged my shoulders at their offerings. If I could consistently have this beer in this state every time, then I'd say it's one of the finest unusual style beers served in California. My home brew friends have raved about how stylistically on this beer is, so while I don't know the style, I have to say I really am impressed with this beer. If you haven't had a hangar beer in a while, it's worth paying a visit. Furthermore, They deserve more ratings on these beer sites for how well they seem to sell locally."
"Nice amber color and lacing in the tall pilsener glass. Mild flavors with a touch of the sweet and sour that I associate with Altbiers. Very light body and the general impression is a lager gone bad. Murky flavors, a touch of roasted malt. Sprightly mouthfeel but just a dirty aftertaste with some hop bitterness. Slight beer smell. I think this one is just not worth bothering with, it seems to detract from the style. There are so many other pleasant beers with a touch of malt, like all the LTD lagers from Full Sail."
"A simple, malty altbier. Some caramel and toffee sweetness, but not a huge amount of character. Good with a delicious burger."
"O: Altbier can be a catch all, and I think this beer comes in to that definition of alt. The roast is overt and much more than you'd expect from something coming out of Germany. Still at the end of the day, it's a good beer, worth a pick up, just don't expect Uerige."
"I actually ordered this after trying it here - having it at the Underground in Redlands on tap and my craft beer friends enjoyed the tastes they had off my pint."
"Highly quaffable."
"I wasn't too thrilled with the mouthfeel, it felt a bit thin and not much carbonation either. Though it is a very drinkable beer."
"D: Perhaps I'm just not a fan of Alts, but this was not particularly interesting to me. Sort of bland all around, but I suppose it works for some."
"D: This could be A session beer if you like heavey malt flavor but,for me I need more than just malt so one is enough."
"Overall- This beer makes me want to visit this style more often."
"Altbier is a rare style to find among US microbrewers, so it is nice to see one done by one of my local ones. More important is it tastes good. Recommended."
"D - A great brew, goes great with almost any food and has enough character to stand well on its own. The unique balance of maltiness and sweet hop bite will bring you back for another pint."
"I have never been a big fan of altbiers before but I had to give this new beer a try from the local brewery, I am glad I did because it was the best beer I had of this style, Ben Cook is a great brewer and we are starting to see this more and more, I will be drinking this each time I go out to visit friends in Redlands now, recommended"
