"O: if somebody told me this was an American imperial IPA, I'd have believed them. it seems to follow none of the altbier's textbook characteristics other than it's definitely a malt-forward beer -- but here the malt seems very mangled up and messy. it's possible I had this particular bottle well past it's prime"

"From my tasting notes: The Gravel Road was a deep reddish amber color that’s not too heavy despite its 7% alcohol content. I tasted a malty sweetness and slight caramel as well. It went down fast and easy and was a good introduction to Rahr & Sons. Not a great Alt but not bad either."

"Summary - Very nice Altbier. This is becoming one of my favorite beer types."

"a – nice alt. reads as a Dusseldorf. good balance. though oxidization detected this is a very drinkable 7.2%"

"All told I enjoyed the beer finding it tremendously drinkable though not overly exceptional. Certainly a good accompaniment to pizza while waiting for my flight."
""
"Has an IPA bitterness but without the good citrus or floral smell and aroma. Not my cup of tea."
""
"The season is winding down for this. Grab a couple sixes if you can find 'em. Great brew for the Fall."

"Overall- More of a stickebeer than what I would consider an alt, I almost passed, but I'm glad I didn't. Rich, malty, substantial, almost Scotch ale-like. I'll keep an eye out for this one. Recommended."

"I like this beer and will be drinking more of it."

"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a standard Pilsener glass."
"Taste leans heavily towards the malty end of the spectrum with a nutty yeast flavor and bold, near-burnt toffee…almost like licking a coffee bean….roasted and husky even. Sweetness is low and shows barely a light dusting of cocoa powder. Alcohol is up there, feels around 7% or so. Not bad, not bad…an interesting bockish-scottish ale that drinks pretty decent. I see this is an Altbier here on BA...I can see that, maybe like an Imperial ALtbier of sorts :)"

"A smooth and thick medium body, but on the heavy side of medium with just enough carbonation to let you know that the beer is alive. The flavors are all sweet and malty. There is caramel, toffee, toasted dark bread, and a hint of maple. All of this smoothly transitions to a slightly bitter finish that's just dry enough to make you really want that next sip. I'm really enjoying this beer and wishing that altbier was a more readily available style."

"Bitter finish, yet very smooth."
"I also find it to be ever so slightly under carbonated, which is a common complaint of mine from Rahr beers in general."
"Overall, pretty good. This would pair better with food than it stands alone."
"The beer pours a dark brownish-red color with a white head. The aroma is a mix of toffee with some dark fruit added. The flavor is similar. I get a lot of toffee and hazelnut notes, with some dark fruit thrown in. Light mouthfeel and medium carbonation. I don't have much to say about the beer because there is not a whole lot going on. A decent, easy drinker but nothing too exciting."
"Opinion: This is a pretty decent representation of this style, and this is definitely one of my more favorite beers that I have tried from Rahr (Their Barrel Aged Winter Warmer is my favorite so far). This one is a little green, but this is a hard style to do well, and they did pretty well. If you are a big fan of Altbiers, like I am, I would give this one a ""day in court""."
"Overall this beer is okay."
"O: Great representation of the style as the hops and malts are very well balanced, it's easy to drink, and the subtle flavors don't overpower one another."
"O- Smoky, interesting, decent."
"Like most everything from Rahr, just ho hum. Nothing particularly wrong, but boring. Nothing I would recommend, but nothing bad either. Once again, I am still trying to find out what an Altbeir acutally is. I don't thing this is one."
"I'm all for supporting the Rahr Brewery, but I felt this brew was below their standards. I'd be willing to try another one, and give Rahr the benefit of the doubt."
"My buddy Scott stumbled across this, cheers. It is dark, translucent brown with very little head. The smell gets things going, though, with caramel, wood, and a biscuit smell. The taste is slightly sharp and almost smoky with a kind of earthy aftertaste. Very easy to drink. See? I just did it. The mouthfeel is thin and a little slippery. Overall, definitely a refreshing beer with a noticeable but not overpowering character. I'd like it with BBQ, I imagine and I like it in me, I'm sure. Somewhere between ""buy another sixer"" and ""buy a keg"" I'd say."
"O: I found this to just be ""okay"". It wasn't all that aromatic or flavorful."
"Overall-Altbier's are not a style I prefer, but have enjoyed the others I've had(Spoetzl, Long Trail) but this one didn't really bring much flavor or anything to really savor or enjoy. Not for me, and probably won't be for you either."
"overall, this was disappointing. I am going to revisit this if i find any difference when i come back to it, but ultimately a strangely flavorless brew."
"Overall - An enjoyable brew."
"Overall this is a pretty decent beer. A nice bit of experimentation - sort of a Altbier/Light Porter. Nothing earth shattering but I'd happily have another or six."
"While the Rahr brewery generally impresses me, this beer does not. I would probably have called it a strong porter rather than an alt. It doesn't fit alt characteristics at all. And, it's just not a very interesting beer."
"The beer is dark copper with a thick tan head that faded and left a filmy layer and lacing. It smells strangely of mint with some spicy hops and fruit, it's a very different smell for a beer but it does smell quite good. It tastes bitter with lemon and pine, there is a lot of sweet caramel malt and dark fruit. The beer is thick with low carbonation and a sticky lingering finish. This is the best altbier I've had so far, it is very balanced between sweet and bitter."
"O: This is tasty although I have no basis as to the style. Reading about some of the other beers in the style it seems pretty close. Well done, Rahr."
"12 oz bottle poured to pint glass. A hazed, dark amber pour with little head that quickly fades to collar and almost no lace. Aroma of toasted malt and a spice like a rye. The flavor is caramel malt balanced with a hay-like hop and tangy spice. Has an earthy, slightly bitter and dry finish. More than average carbonation keeps it lively. Think this beer would be perfect when paired with a grilled pork chop."
"Go Rahr!"
"This is a nice new brew from Rahr. Its dangerously quaffable. The alcohol never gets in the way. Its practically unnoticed. Not necessarily the best altbier I have had. It does, though, hit all the right notes. Props to Rahr for creating another tasty brew."
