Nose had a lightly molasses-like sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium with a molasses-like flavor on the tongue. Definitely not malty, but not bitter, either. It landed somewhere in the middle ground of the two flavors. Finish definitely had the grassiness of "German Noble hops", which I read as Hallertau.

Flavor is pretty neutral as well, with a delicate graininess of raw barley. Very balanced, but not very flavorful. According to BA's notes this was brewed once in 2012. Maybe this bottle is just too old (though it's an alt, so aging ought to be permitted). Since it's before the best buy date I consider it fair game to review. Drinkable but unimpressive.","hreb","Jun 29, 2013"

3.94,8.8,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Pours a crystal-clear dark amber with a thinnish head. Some caramel in the nose with herbal noble hops being the strongest aroma here. Flavor is CLEAN: something that a lot of US brewers fail to do with alts. Nice caramel, biscuit malts with a little toast (I'd hope for a little less toast still). Nice herbal, grassy noble hop flavors with a sturdy bitterness and dryness in the end. Mouthfeel has some prickly carbonation. Not too sticky nor slick nor heavy. Overall, this isn't the best altbier I've had, but it's one of the very few and rare examples of a US microbrewery actually making an alt instead of labeling a messy, estery, toasty mess an "altbier." Seriously, I'm tired of US breweries making generic dark amber ales and calling them altbier.","goochpunch","Jun 02, 2013"

Smell is of malt, grain, caramel, and grassy hop aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel.

This is actually the second bottle of this I have bought. Good price point for a bomber and I think it is a damn fine altbier. The nutty yeast makes more of an impact as it warms and the mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. However, there is enough going on to make this a nice, sessionable brew to share or drink alone. Versatile...thats the word Im looking for!","twiggamortis420","Jul 06, 2012"
