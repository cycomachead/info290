Extremely smooth finish in which Carmel, malts, nuttiness and slight hop comes together very well.  Nothing overbearing.  Very drinkable.

The beer is clear rich amber in color and the decent carbonation forms a nice thin head which seems to be lacing nicely. The smell is sweet belgium malt/sugar. The taste includes an earthy zest, almost comes across with a coffee bean zest. There is definite malt and hint of sweetness. The mouthfeel is good, at 5% ABV, it has a huge flavor, and would be a good session beer if you like malty/earthy/peat/coffee tones.","WoodBrew","Aug 16, 2011"

3.48,-2.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Finally, my first Altbier! This one pours a cloudy dark amber in color with a white lacing around the glass. The aromas are very sweet. I'm picking up a lot of malt with light yeast. There is also some dark fruit apparent. The taste too is of sweet maltiness. It has a little fruityness to it but they're hard to define. It's kind of like a potpourri. It drinks medium in body and isn't too bad. It isn't too good either. This seems like a wannabe Belgian. It definitely doesn't seem German. This one is average at best. I'll have to try the Uerige Sticke next.","aasher","Feb 11, 2011"

3.03,-15.4,3.5,3,3,3,3,"Another beer thanks to my brother's random buying habits. (Lovin' it.) It pours a sunrise russet-amber topped by a half-finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises mild toffee, very light buttery biscuits, light greens, and a hint of orange peel. It's all meek and ineffective. The taste holds notes of grass, wheat, light orange peel, very light buttery biscuits, and greens. With all the meekness, this beer must be inheriting a larger portion of the Earth than others. Not only is it mild, though, but it's overly grassy and leafy, with nothing else going on. Kinda odd, if you ask me. The body is a straight medium, with a just-under-moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a sad beer, one that just doesn't seem to accomplish anything but disappointing.","TMoney2591","0"

3.61,0.8,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"Picked up a single at Princeton Liquors in Maple Grove for about $2. The beer has a tall light tan head with a hazy amber-red body. The flavor is akin to a typical, dry red ale with a fair share of hops. The malt provide a mild toffee and dried date. The hops quickly kick in after the malt with grapefruit and orange rind flavor that offers a nice balance to the barley. Oddly enough, the aroma remind me of a sugar cookie with dark bread notes, no hint of hops. All in all, a decent and dry amber that about as hoppy as your average pale ale, but with richer malt character. The overall feel is almost astringent with the combination of hop bitterness and dry malts, but it's otherwise very drinkable.","tempest","Aug 30, 2009"
3.97,10.9,3.5,4,4,3,4.5,"Pours a nice hazy red color, maybe some orange, a little lighter than red, with a decent 1 cm head. It falls back kind of quickly leaving a bit of a ring which leaves only a bit of lacing. Decent looking. A little more clarity would be nice. The smell is pretty good. And interesting caramelly toastiness comes up front. Something is a little fruity, something is a little herbal and spicy - minty a bit, and something is a little leafy. The nice breadiness in here makes this one interesting. I really love the taste of altbiers - I think it's an amazing blend of what I like about German lagers and American ales. The malt body is really interesting too. It's like a nice nutty bready taste, with this minty sugar syrup poured on top of it. I really like it - it tastes fairly clean, with just a hint of fruity flavors. I like the graininess too, that isn't a flavor that comes out in other ale styles. The body is nice, medium full, a nice rush of carbonation, and a little bite in the finish. The drink is pretty good. Enjoyable, nice and light, a bit clean, the flavors are nice. I could probably drink quite a few of these - and I find that to be quite normal with the style.","taylorhamrick","Aug 18, 2009"

3.88,8.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a clear, copper color. One inch head of an off-white color. Great retention and good lacing.

The taste is ok, I must admit I am not an altbier fan but this one is better than the other one I have tasted. Its kind of like you are going to get a big citrusy hop bite like a DIPA but it never happens and the flavor fades rather fast. Not the greatest after taste/mouthfeel after you swallow, and its a drinkable beer just not something I would go out of my way to attain. Overall a pretty good beer.","Biggness","Jul 12, 2008"

3.71,3.6,2.5,4,3.5,4,4,"Thanks to Beertracker for trying to get me to warm up to Altbiers. Pours a nice amber (duh) color with near perfect clarity. Absolutely no head at all, I suppose next time I should pour harder, I didn't exactly ease it into the glass this time. Smells of light German malts and toffee, little to no hops present. However, hops tingle the tongue upon tasting. As it warms the toffee becomes more prominent. Nice earthiness in the tail end with some light malt flavors. Soft spicey hops develop in the aftertaste. A nice easy drinking medium bodied beer. A much better Altbier than my previous experience even without a head.","timbro81","Mar 22, 2008"
4.1,14.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Pours a deep amber in color. Moderate carbonation and lacing shows up as well. Smells of great malts: caramel, some subtle fruits, some toasted bread.

A good session brew if I do say so myself.","ncvbc","Mar 19, 2008"

There was a slight roasted smell of malt and minimal hints of earthy tones. The taste is of mild hops and rich malts. There is a good balance leaving traces of the bitterness in your mouth.

A very attractive beer that justs exudes quality. The smells are faint but hints of sweet malt and toffee. The taste is just that as a sweet malt is dominate with a hint of toffee. It leaves a creamy coating and a light/medium body. Very pleasant all around and a low ABV makes this a easy drinking beer. Definately will be buying this again when in need of a lighter tasting sessionable beer.","morimech","Oct 16, 2007"

Nose starts off with a blast of metallic-copper-rust, grainy malt, caramel and toasted nuts. If there's such a thing as a "Nut Bomb" this is it. Nuttier than most nut browns I've tried, along with loads of bready/caramel sweet malt and a mild hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is crisply carbonated on the tongue but silky smooth in the mouth. This is a hell of a drinker - plenty of flavor, light-bodied, refreshing. Again, this beer is nut-rageous, so if that's not your thing, well, you've been warned. Otherwise, seek this one out.

There is some definite nuttiness to the taste as well. Some hop bite is apparent at the end, again its a spicy noble hop presence. There is somewhat of a metallic aftertaste present to this beer as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, not too light. A great session brew here.

A little light in color for what I would expect from an alt, but the lacing is okay. Aroma is minimal, and what is present is reasonably neutral, with some apple or fruit notes. Taste is caramel malt, tempered with some crisp fruity flavors, similar to the nose. Not sure if it's what I think an alt should be, but standing on its own merits, it's not bad. Mouthfeel is good, and drinkability is even better.","ppoitras","May 10, 2004"

Malty aroma, candied apple and malted milk with slight esters. Mouthfeel is shy of medium but sub creamy. Flavor is well-tempered and laid out, sort of unfolding like a ball of caramel rolling down a caramel hill. Looked for more hopping, just a slight sense of pepper and a nut skin sense give an impression of bittering. A very pleasant beer in drinkability, I just get more snap from some Alts and there's a bit of ragged texture here at the end of the glass that takes away from its initial smoothness.","ADR","Jan 13, 2004"

(This is definitely not on the high side of the spectrum for hop rates in an alt.)  It has a really nice clean malty taste.  Different from a malty bock taste though.  This is more toasty and non complex.   Very mellow tasting, as it should be from the extended cold lagering that this ale undergoes.
