Aromas of toasted grain, cinnamon and nutmeg spices, and subtle caramel sweetness give a true harvest feel to the aromas. Rich and pleasant nose. Flavors are roasted and sweet on the forward tongue, with a sugary undertone that detracts from the overall balance of the beer. Roasted caramel notes hit a tangy level, while the spices present on the nose seem to all but disappear on the palate. Light, slighty frothy body from the carbonation, but even that can't help clear the cloying, sugary linger that bleeds all the way through to the slick finish. This one started great for me, but then seemed to spiral out of control from there.","GarthDanielson","Sep 26, 2013"

This has a nice delicate hop in the background that accents this beer nicely.","I3eck","Sep 25, 2013"
3.93,14.2,3.75,3.75,4,4,4," The flavor is malty up front with some light toasted and caramel flavor with a gentle yeast element which gives way to some light herbal and slightly spicey hop flavors which continue into the finish with a subtle dry quality but no alcohol is apparent in the taste. I like a good Alt and this fits with a bit more hops than the German counterpart perhaps, but the flavor is clean and it is a drinkable example of the style.","Slatetank","Sep 25, 2013"

Malt forward nose, mostly caramel with some biscuit, floral hops, not much else. Taste mirrors nose, more caramel than biscuit, floral finish. Mouthfeel on the light side of medium, not a lot of effervescence. IMHO they'd have been better off just doing a seasonal bottling of the classic Alt, one of Fred's favorite beers and a historically important microbrew than this, which lacked both depth and character, though fairly sessionable.","jdense","Oct 13, 2011"

There is an almost cough-syrup type fruitiness here; a hint of that fake fruity cherry note that is often a component of cough-syrup. A solid bitterness runs throughout, along with a sharp pine and menthol note, it tries to balance the sweet & fruity notes. This definitely strikes me at times as a good example of an Alt. It has a nice maltiness to it, mostly caramelized but a light, almost roasty note is here in the finish as well. And the fruitiness is certainly characteristic of many a traditional German Alt. The body has a certain heft to it and this beer does have a lingering mouth coating character to it that is quite nice.

3.56,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,4.5,"Pours an inviting amber with a good sized head for a lager. Moderatly carbonated. Smell is of malt and grains. No hint of the sulfur common in poorly aged lagers. Beer taste is watery maltiness with an aftertaste of floral noble hops. Bitterness is balanced, this is an easy drinking beer. A reasonably acceptable example of the Marzen.","zacharius","Sep 12, 2004"
3.89,13.1,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Too early for Oktoberfest? Considering it's been 100 f'ing degrees the last 5 days here in Portland, I'd bloody well say so. That's not going to stop me, however, from diving into the first of the upcoming seasonals. Indeed, Marzen-Oktoberfest is one of my favorite styles. Widmer's example is respectably authentic, but it seems a bit dumbed down from last year, which I remember enjoying thoroughly. This year is a bit closer to Drop Top territory, not a good place to be, in my mind. Pours a handsome if predictable copper amber, with pretty good lager head and retention, although not as creamy as the best of the Germans. Excellent, if subtle, aroma of brown sugar, red apple skin, and spicy roasted meat. The flavor itself is a disappointment; caramelized malts with little depth or complexity. Again, just a shout away from crappy ol' Drop Top. The hops are present, but provide little of the intrigue that is necessary for a successful example of the style, and none of the spiciness promised in the aroma. The beer stretches out a bit upon warming up, but again, you need a spicy hop element to make the transition from a standard blase amber lager to a truly complex, wonderful Fest bier. That said, this beer is cleanly flavorful with no off elements, and it should pair very well with food, especially roast chicken; pork will work too. Mouthfeel is all right, can't hold a candle to the best German lagers but that is hardly surprising; almost no American lagers can. Drinkability fine as well. It will probably not be a surprise to those only familiar with their Hefeweizen that Widmer falls short of the mark here, but as someone who's visited their brewpub (Gasthaus) and was wowed by their triumphant Muscat Love at this year's Oregon Brew Fest, I was hoping for much more.","Thrasher","Aug 11, 2004"
2.3,-33.1,3,3,2,2,2,"Pours a golden dark orange/yellow with a little white inch thick head that falls flat. Lacing is horrible, nothing to speak of. The smell is of grain, slight lime hints, very grainy, clean otherwise. Taste is lacing definition, the grain, wheat is detectible, malt is of watered down sugar, no hop content to speak of, medium bodied but doesn't offer that pizazz. Won't drink again.","beertaster13","Aug 03, 2004"
3.96,15.1,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Side note: My wife had the drop top amber, and side by side, the two were remarkably similar. Oddly enough, the Oktoberfest had a much more robust malt body.","freed","Oct 02, 2003"

3,-12.8,3,3,3,3,3,"The pour a pleasant lipid amber to copper color, the head is modest, frothy and the lace decent enough to cover up the glass. The aroma of malt is the dominant, sweet, as is the malt-laden start. Top is skinny in its feel, the beer finishes with a delightful hop spicy bite, and is moderately carbonated the long lasting aftertaste dry a desert bone.","Gusler","Jan 10, 2003"
3.2,-7,3,3,3,3,4,"Orange body topped by a fizzy, rapidly decaying white head, which almost instantly breaks down into an "oil skid". Nose is caramel sweetness with some fresh bread around the edges. Taste starts with a layer of malt,and a slight hop twang at the end. Very clean, definitely German as opposed to American, but not very interesting. There is none of the deeper, chocolate-like notes with classic marzens. An ok amber, and that is what it is sub-headed as, but I expected more from this brewery, and I feel prior years had more substance.","RonfromJersey","Nov 26, 2002"
4.47,29.9,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The finish is a tad abrupt, with the hops pulling the rug out from under the sweetness. Still, one drink follows another. Glad to be home.","putnam","Oct 31, 2002"
4.1,19.2,4,4,4,4,4.5,"2002 release. Beautiful amber, pours a nice head but it doesn't retain well. Characteristic märzen bready/grainy malt aroma, but with more hop character than some others. Very tasty, grainy sweet malt mingles with slight hop bitterness for a crisp, refreshing bite. Slightly spicy and tingly mouthfeel. Not as much sour breadiness as others in this style. Overall it's very tasty and would be a wonderful session beer, as a märzen should be.","hyuga","Oct 29, 2002"
