3.63,3.1,4,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"The color is dark amber with translucent clarity and thick beige head with fine bead and some lace with good retention. The smell has a slight fruity yeast aroma with subtle sweet malt scent and gentle hop note with hint of fruity yeast ester as it warms with light alcohol. The feel has medium high carbonation with  slight spice and light sweetness and gentle toasted aspect with mostly dry bitter finish with mild alcohol influence on the palate. The feel leads to a mix of malt with toasted flavor and spicy/herbal hop with gentle malt backing and slightly bitter hops with a malt emphasis on toasted grain flavor and finish is spicy bitter and mostly dry. This is a decent alt but more emphasis on hops than is necessary for the style could use more malt to fit even though it is still very drinkable and yeast seems to be a proper alt strain based on aroma and flavor","Slatetank","Jan 29, 2015"

2.9,-17.6,3,3,2.75,3,3,"Take a generic IPA and then toss in a few spices. Presto... you have this beer. Brown in color carries a large amount of head on a violent pour from the bottle, so much so that it ran over the glass. Within a minute or two the white foam was gone. I couldn't pick up that much on the aroma but the taste is sour. Yeah you can sugar coat it and say bitter but the lack of sweetness comes off as if you are sucking on a bag of buckles. Nothing to write home about, but good to taste in a comparison of winter beers. Def taste like a backyard brewer.","Ryanm1","Nov 30, 2013"

The balance is excellent and the hops hold their own without becoming fruity. Itâ€™s creamy but also strong and stately. What a treat.","utopiajane","Apr 23, 2013"

3.88,10.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"O: I enjoyed this beer, and Evolution Brewing has had several very good brews in their initial splash into VA (see Lot #3 IPA for the best of the bunch). Secret Spot is also a high quality brew that crosses style lines of WEst Coast style red ale with super-noble hopped altbier. Definitely this is a good one to check out.","argock","Dec 01, 2012"
3.67,4.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"O-once again the altbier is beyond me. At first I was like IPA? but then i was like nahhh. it certainly has the nose of an IPA, but the taste of a muted IPA that is somewhat more dignified and stable. It is what it is, and its proud, and it won't change. it is...worth a try I'll say. it's really just an easy drinker, much like an APA.","AdamBear","Nov 27, 2012"

3.83,8.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Clear honey-amber pour, topped with a small bubbly off-white head; minimal retention, and a few streaks of lacing. Caramel malts in the nose, some floral and citrus hops. Taste of caramel malts, toasted grains, toffee backbone, quickly giving way to a crisp hoppiness, orange peel and floral notes, fairly bitter from mid-palate onward. Hoppier than I'd expect for an altbier, maybe even closer to an APA, but still good either way. Medium body and pretty good overall.","Rifugium","Beers"

3.85,9.4,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"I was told this is a double alt or a sticke alt-that being said-Very nice coppery color. Sweet caramel and malt aroma with a touch of floral hoppiness. Very solid malty flavors upfront. Definate hop presence-more so then any other alt beer I have had. Lingering caramel presence. Great residual sweetness going on. Has a nice bite in the finish. Soft, almost a creamy body. Goes down quite easy. Very enjoyable. Nice beer for the colder months.","lackenhauser","0"
