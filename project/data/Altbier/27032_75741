3.9,9.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours lightly cloudy ruby red color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, plum, apple, light nuttiness, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, light chocolate, light nuttiness, plum, apple, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light earthy herbal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready malt. earthy hops, and light-moderate yeast fester flavors; with a nice malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice altbier. All around good robustness, balance, and complexity of dark/bready malt, earthy hop, and light-moderate yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Dec 29, 2014"

Sweet malt, caramel, and toffee on the palate. Almost too sweet - would like some bitter contrast. Nice Belgian lace. Extended lingering with hints of whole-grain bread. It is a filling and thirst-quenching ale.","carlborch","Mar 10, 2013"

Nice late winter, early spring beer. I can even see similarities to the Salvator I've been enjoying through Lent (even with obvious style difference). I'd buy it again when I crave a malty treat.","GRPunk","Mar 04, 2013"

Thanks to Jeff for sharing this one, though.","tectactoe","Feb 22, 2013"

3.15,-11.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,3,"Pours a dark amber, with a fine half inch frothy head and great lacing. Scents of sugar cookies, grass, balsamic vinegar, and molasses. Definitely an odd scent profile. Taste has notes of soy, malt, and a touch of molasses. Very different taste from the nose, not really much there. Mouthfeel is very light, some fine carbonation, but overall an incredibly easy drinking beer, almost too easy. Perhaps I got a bad bottle, but I felt this was really lacking substance.","srv33","Jul 13, 2012"

3.53,-0.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Tasting my second beer from Cheboygan Brewering over Father's Day weekend in Michigan. The beer pours a nice clear amber with thin white head that is not lacing. The smell includes milk chocolate and roast. The taste has what the smell provides. A very solid beer, but not my favorite amber....to me this is closer to a Brown Ale than amber. Nonetheless...worth part-taking in for sure.","WoodBrew","0"

4.5,26.4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall I was really impressed with this beer and I thought it was a great Altbier. This beer was all about the malts and they were very well put together and that made for one tasty brew that I really enjoyed drinking. This beer has great drinkability, it's real smooth, not filling, and the taste really grabs my attention, I could drink this all night and perfectly satisfied. What I liked most about this beer was pretty much everything, but I think the flavors were my favorite aspect, I really liked the combination of toasted bread and caramel. What I liked least about this beer was the absence of hops, a little more hop flavor might make this the best Altbier ever, I also didn't like the fact that it had not bottling date, all new brewerys should date their bottles, it just makes sense. I will for sure be buying more of this beer, it's too good not to and I highly recommend it to anyone, it's that good. I was really impressed with this beer and brewery, they sure made a very good first impression on me, for a beer and brewery that I have heard nothing about this was a great surprise and I am glad I took a chance on this brew. This has to be the best Altbier I have ever had, I don't think they get much better then this. Awesome job on this beer guys, rest I assured I will be more then willing to check out more of your brews, this is quite the sleeper beer, people need to know how awesome this beer is, you can bet I will spreading the word.","StoutHunter","Nov 26, 2011"
