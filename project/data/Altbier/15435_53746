3.65,-0.3,,,,,,"Its been a long time I wanted to try this one. Finally got my hands on one. Clear beer. Effervescent too. Amber color. Nice creamy head thrones on top of it. Malty and some burnt caramel in the nose. Tastewise, the beer is more roasted malts than anything else. Very refreshing. Effervescent too but still sweet in the mouth. Light body to medium. Refreshing and delicious. A good summer beer with lots of taste! Cheers!","ZorPrime","Aug 27, 2014"

4.04,10.4,4.5,3.5,4.25,3.75,4.25,"Final Grade: 4.04, an impressive A-. Beau's Festivale is a fine session amber, offering an interesting harmony between the sweet, biscuity sweet malts and its grassy noble hop bill. This is probably one of my favourite offerings from this brewery - this is the second bottle I've purchased, and I could certainly see myself picking up a few more before it's out of season. Highly recommended to any fan of balanced, quaffable amber ales.","thehyperduck","Apr 12, 2014"

They seem to brew what they want/like and not worry so much about what the other guy is doing. Without these types of thinkers alternative styles would probably have disappeared long ago.","korguy123","Jun 13, 2012"

The presentation is all there, nice looking, perhaps why the price is a bit high too, but Beau's has yet to win me over into multiple bottle purchases and that continues with this summer seasonal. One and done.","heebes","Sep 08, 2011"

3.86,5.5,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a rusty copper, with a couple of fingers of offwhite head. Moderate retention, and some pretty good lacing. Nose is earthy and woody, some caramel and dark malts, dark breads and more earthy/spicy hop notes. Fairly standard from what I've come to expect from altbiers. Taste has more earthiness, dark bread, some light sweetness and moderate grassiness. Characteristic 'organic' flavour I've come to expect from a lot of Beau's offerings. Quite light in the mouthfeel, moderate bitterness and a somewhat crisp finish. Easily drinkable, and nice within the style. I hope they plan on barrel-aging this as part of the Greener Futures project.","liamt07","Aug 29, 2011"
3.71,1.4,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,"This is a good beer. I would like some more aromatic hops and/or a more pronounced malt backbone. The end-note of toasted grain is really nice, more please!","CanuckRover","Aug 17, 2011"
3.88,6,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Beau's brewmaster is very adept at reproducing German styles - as the flagship Lug Tread Ale would attest - but few people outside of the Rhineland have succeeded in emulating this distinct style; I had no expectations that Festiveale would be as good as it actually is. Then again, I'm not at all surprised. Beau's doesn't make a habit of releasing bad beers.","biegaman","Aug 17, 2011"

3.5,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Bottle: Poured a deep clear brown color altbier with a nice large foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of light caramelized malt with dry cereal notes. Taste is quite refreshing with nice notes of caramelized malt and dry cereal with very subtle lingering sweetness. Body is about average with good carbonation. Well brewed for style and pleasantly drinkable.","Phyl21ca","Jul 13, 2011"
3.38,-7.7,4,3.5,3,4,3.5,"O/D - I'm a little torn. It's got alot of flavour, I'm just not sure I like it alot. It's good but not a jaw dropper. A little too earthy. It's really smooth but not exactly refreshing.","tbeckett","Jul 07, 2011"
3.53,-3.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Another fine product from Beau's of VanKleek Hill. Whereas Beau's lugtread reallly stands out especially amongst Ontario beers, Festivale is merely good. i say merely because I was hoping that it would be exceptional. This however is not a complaint. it's a fine malty treat with a butterscotch chocolate bottom.so some will love it.","shamus","Jun 29, 2011"

3.5,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"I tried this beer on June 24, 2011 at ""The Beerbistro"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The beer poured a translucent red colour with a thin white cap. The aroma was mild caramel malt, some grains, floral hops, and spices. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation. The flavour was sweet malt, toffee, fruity, and spice, and had a nice bitter bite to it.","cyrenaica","Jun 06, 2011"
3.5,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Nose is fruity, cherries and dark fruits. Caramel and biscuity malt, a hint of honey. Flavor reveals more of the alt characteristics, a slight metallic nature, earthy dryness, quite a hop bite on this one as per style. Still some fruit, a light sweetness in the body. A little thin on the body, a little low on the carb. Some flaws but I'm still enjoying it enough. Perhaps it's not in top condition, I'll have to revisit again.","ritzkiss","Nov 17, 2010"
3.5,-4.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall â€“ A solid beer from a local brewer. It's very similar to the beaver river ipeh, but perhaps a little more earthiness. Anyways, it's worth a try - especially if you are a fan of their other beers.","spinrsx","Aug 31, 2010"
3.48,-4.9,3.5,3,4,3.5,3,"Pours a light brown colour with a little white head. This smells similar to most things I've tried from Beau's, a slight malty sweetness with a big earthy aroma. Very well balanced slightly bitter with a nice roasted malt finish. Medium body, very nice weight. I would drink this again, I think that this should be there flagship and not Lug Tread.","peensteen","Jul 30, 2010"

3.92,7.1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Pours a light amber-brown colour with nice white head. Smells of noble hops and bready malt. Taste has a nice amount of bitterness to go with the sweetness of the malt. Some nuttiness too. A very well balanced beer. This went down very quickly, carbonation level was great.","kwjd","Jul 19, 2010"
3.53,-3.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Enjoyed on tap at Chancey Smith. Brown unfiltered body with a whisp of a white head. Suitable carboantion and average mouthfeel. Hoppy,generous noble hops, is most of the flavour. European malts, earthy.Aromas of what's to ome, a little hop and malts.","Sammy","Jul 01, 2010"
4,9.3,4,4,4,4,4,"On-tap at Chancey Smith's in London, Ontario. Taps a dark copper red with brownish hues and a thick ring of yellowy beige head. Some speckles of lace cling to the shaker. Smell and taste are HUGE bready malts, pumpernickel rye, very fresh, doughy, and aromatic, light biscuit, dried fruit, licorice, sweet cereal grains, whole wheat toast, and caramel. Noble hops are mildly floral and earthy with a clean, citric bitterness to end. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, chewy-medium, bold spiciness mid-palate, ultra dry and husky finish. If this is an ale, Beau's has me fooled. Amazing lager-like thirst quencher.","cratez","Beers"

Nice lace. malty nose is earthy, with caramel, some floral notes, dark bread, quite nutty too. Tastes of sweet toasty malts, caramel, some dark sweet fruit, with a very nice fresh hop presence. Quite bitter on the finish with a fresh hoppy linger. Creamy and very drinkable. Excellent.","mrmanning","0"
