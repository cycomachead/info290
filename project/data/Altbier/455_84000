3.63,1.4,4,3.5,3.75,3,3.75,"Altbier poured a clear mahogany colour, with a large off-white head that faded to a thin cap of foam, leaving some minor lacing and spotting in its wake. Its aroma was pleasant enough and consisted of sweet toasted malts. The flavour began with a sweet, rich roasted maltiness which gave way in the finish to a mild, slightly earthy bitterness. These flavours were nicely balanced and all lingered on as a pleasant aftertaste. Relatively light bodied for a beer this dark and with a fine carbonation, I found the mouthfeel to be a bit thin for my personal taste. Overall though, this fairly uncommon style of beer is probably the best of Creemore’s offerings, and certainly worth a try at $2.85 per can.","BuckyBeerBeaver","Apr 10, 2014"

Same character in the flavour, but with moderate bitterness. Nicely balanced with lingering lemon. Light bodied, average carbonation, decent texture. Pretty good, pleasant to drink.","DrJay","Dec 30, 2013"

3.77,5.3,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"I look forward to the day when a glass of Altbier is as popular as a latte and traditional brewhouses are as plentiful as Starbucks. That's the norm in Germany, though it is still a long way off here in Canada. Creemore Springs Altbier, however, is a step in the right direction. Here's hoping more breweries follow.","biegaman","Nov 08, 2012"
4,11.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Can: Poured a clear brown color alt with a large foamy head with good retention and some alight lacing. Aroma of dry caramel malt with chewy biscuit malt is quite great. Taste is a great mix between some dry caramel malt with light roasted nuts and chewy gain. Body is about average with medium carbonation. Pretty bang on to style, great drinkability and very enjoyable.","Phyl21ca","Nov 06, 2012"

3.48,-2.8,4.5,4,3.5,2.5,3,"Final Thoughts: I don't think Altbier is my cup of tea. As with my love for english brown ales, my preference for brown beer is malt over nuttiness and certainly over dryness. If you like a dry beer, but don't like the high bitterness of excessive hops, this beer is for you. I hate to say it, but it's my first disappointment from Creemore Springs, but I can't really hold it against them as at the very least, they continue to push the envelope by brewing this under represented style.","TheHammer","Oct 12, 2012"

3.83,7,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"A hoppy altbier? Sure, why the hell not - and thankfully not very adherent to west coast 'standards' in that regard. Anyway, a decent, balanced tipple, and a nice sideshow for this brewery, very helpful in showing we far flung customers that they haven't lost their old-world Deutsche moxie since, well, you know.","biboergosum","Sep 03, 2012"
3.94,10.1,3,4,4,4,4,"Deep copper colour, brilliant clarity. Poorly retained beige head doesn't lace. Malty aroma of bread, toasted grain, and nuts with floral hop notes. Flavour is malt forward toasted biscuit and nutty notes, followed by a firm leafy bitterness in the finish. Flavourful but but very balanced. Medium-bodied with low carbonation and a smooth, rich mouthfeel. Creemore have stuck to their roots making European-inspired beers while doing something fairly different for the Ontario market. They've also made a delicious beer. Prost!","mintjellie","Sep 02, 2012"

3.9,8.9,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"Final Grade: 3.9, an excellent B+. Creemore Springs' Altbier makes for yet another fantastic offering to add to their portfolio. Despite their acquisition by one of the nation's macro giants, this brewery keeps chugging along and producing some of Ontario's most widely-available, consistently solid beer. This is well worth adding to their seasonal lineup, assuming it doesn't displace their (also excellent) kellerbier. This is a great summer/autumn refresher that is well worth sampling.","thehyperduck","Aug 24, 2012"

3.5,-2.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall - Pretty decent I guess.. but nothing exciting. It's been a while since I've had an altbier so I don't have much to compare it with style wise. It's worth trying but I'd have one of their other varieties before this one next time.","spinrsx","Aug 19, 2012"
3.95,10.3,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Pale amber red colour, one finger of white head, lots of lace here. Smell is rich and malty, nutty toffee, caramel, lightly yeasty with a bit of floral hop present too. Taste is malty with rich caramel flavours, toffee with more grainy malts, a bit of earthy hops mid palate, starts off sweet but finishes slightly dry. Medium carbonation, medium body, a little dry and prickly at points. Defintley a nice altbier, I enjoyed the extra hops in this one and one of the more enjoyable brews for a style I'm not crazy about.","peensteen","Aug 16, 2012"
3.72,3.9,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Another good brew from Creemore, certainly a great project for their anniversary year. As a KW resident, I really hope this brew makes it to some of the Oktoberfest events as I can see myself drinking this again and again.","JohnnyBarman","Aug 08, 2012"
3.88,8.4,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Easy-drinking, well-made traditional altbier. Good flavour and complexity. Malts tend to dominate the palate a bit I find, but it works together. Not a common style to come across in Ontario, so a solid effort that is worth trying.","mick303","Aug 05, 2012"
3.8,6.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Brown in colour with a white head. Good lacing and retention. Nose has earthy and woody malt notes, bready and some grain character. Perhaps a hint of sulphur with warmth. Taste is again earthy and woody, but in moderation. More graininess, light sweetness. Moderately drying finish, with some grassy hops. A bit of mineral character. Medium feel , decent carbonation. A nice, drinkable but not outstanding altbier.","liamt07","Beers"
3.8,6.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Enjoyed on tap at The Beer Academy. Hop forward altbier. Not exactly what I expected from the style, yet a very drinkable and reasonably tasty beer.Some ace, slightly amber colour. Average mouthfeel. Me thinks this will be a hit. Collaboration with Zum Schlussel, reputed the greatest alt brewers.Good drinkability in the can as well.","Sammy","0"
