"Just got back from Duesseldorf and this is very close to All Bier. At little hoppy compared to, but darn near best found. Let it go a little warm and flat, and you'd swear you were in bar near the Rhine in D."

"Metro brews some great German styles. While I've never been a huge Alt guy I do love me some Ironworks. It's malty sweet but with an assertive bitterness and dryness that keep things flowing. The pints per sitting ratio is high with this beer.An easy drinker to put away one after the other."

"Iron Works Alt is a common occurrence where an American microbrewery makes a foreign land's style but does so on their regular equipment, with regular ale making techniques, and with as many of the already contracted ingredients that they can reasonably get away with. Although it has glimpses of Northern German Alts, its not a classic or authentic flavor or feel. It does make for a fairly good and clean non-descript ale."

"Beer is medium-light to medium in body, with carbonation of medium-high to high in intensity, resulting in a fairly fizzy mouthfeel that's a bit too pronounced for the body's weight. The result is a prickly feel that takes more than a few seconds to dissipate, eventually settling to a gentle foam on the palate. Closes fairly dry, with subtantial stickiness lingering on the palate."

"O: I think if it wasn't for the apple like flavor i'm getting (possibly the yeast?) I would have rated this much higher. I've not had many Alts, but this one fell short of expectations."

"It’s in a stange! Just sitting there staring at me like I’m some crazy beer knurd…and its got a beautiful semi-dark copper color that just gets darker towards its center, its mildly hazy and filled with some good carbonation. The head is thick and fluffy and just will not go away, did I mention that its in an off white color, maybe even tan. Medium lacing; nothing else to say here. Weak fruit aromas like apple, banana, raisins and mild malts. Crisp and sharp when it first hits your tongue, it mellows out into a slightly tangy beer over all. The malts are well represented here, herbs and mild citrus fruits also come through, very interesting taste. It warms up in the aftertaste and the tanginess wanes just a bit as well, and the alcohol is well hidden."
"O=I'm not too familiar with the style, but this was enjoyable...will definitely try the style again."

"Metropolitan Iron Works Alt ---3/5"
""

"Picked up a sixer of this over Memorial Day weekend at the Binny’s behind Goose Island Clybourn. Served in a pint glass. Pours a moderate brown color with a decent off-white head. Nose has some bready malt and a touch of nuttiness. Some herbal hops. Flavor is similar but has a metallic twang through the finish. The same appears in the nose as it warms. Body is light-medium with a dry finish. Not a big fan."

"Overall, it isn't terrible but I grew tired of it quickly and did not finish the bottle."

"O - Wasn't impressed, but didn't feel like it was a bad beer. Felt like Metropolitan rounded out their portfolio. Nice to try, but if you are a diehard altbier fan I'd pass."
"O: To me it seems like Metropolitan went for an easy drinking ""different"" lager, rather than make a true altbier"

"Displays an amber color with a two finger off-white head. A bit of toffee, caramel, and grassy, herbal hops dominate the nose. Starts smooth with notes of caramel, notes of apple and pear join in the midpalate and finishes somewhat dry and clean. A very tasty locally-brewed altbier. An easy-drinking, yet complex beer for almost any occassion."
"Nice and hoppy, surprisingly so for an Alt. A great balance between hops and malts and a great beer to transition or turn someone to Alts. Seriously this is a great beer to wean people who have been suckling on IPAs for too long."

"O - A complex lager for sure if you're in the mood for one. But I am having trouble with the metallic taste."

"Finally sitting down to try what comes across as the highest-regarded of the Metropolitan beers (which, for whatever reason, I've sorta neglected over the years). It pours a clear amber-copper topped by over a finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises caramel, Belgian candi sugar, lightly spicy greens, mandarin orange syrup, and a touch of red apple skin. The taste brings in more of the same, with the candi sugar really taking on a leadership role now. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a generally smooth feel. Overall, a very nice brew, one of the better altbiers I've had in a long time."
"A pretty good example of the style, pretty darn drinkable"

"O: Complex, traditional, fresh....overall quite really nice. Another great beer from Metro."
"I get the octogenarian part as this is a smooth and mellow beer, but I'm not so sure it has a punk rock attitude. I found it totally pleasant without any harshness at all."
"The flavor also tapers to a soft sweet finish that reminded me of a Bock. This is a very nice and easy drinking beer, that I'd be happy to offer to guests. It would also, in my estimation, be a great gateway beer if you're trying to get a macro fan to try some craft beer; it's straightforward enough, yet very subtle and intriguing personality that makes your points obvious."

"Is my palate broken tonight? grab a bottle and find out."

"D - Very tasty and easy drinking alt. Has all the great sweet malt characteristics while still being dry enough to have several in one sitting."

"Overall: One of the better alts that I have had, nice complex aroma and taste."
"this is really good. The feel is very good though the taste is lacking a slight bit. This is a real enjoyable beer on the whole"
"3, 3, 3, 4, 3"
"This is seriously easy to drink. It has enough facets to keep you engaged. Well done guys!"
"O - Actually not a bad beer, after looking over some of the reviews I get the feeling this might be considerably better on tap than in the bottle. Easy to drink."
"This review may not be perfect because I drank this sucker straight from the bottle. I can't speak much of the appearance since it's behind a brown bottle, nor the smell, since it's only being channeled out the end of a narrow bottle. However, this is one tasty beer. It comes across to me as almost a Newcastle Brown Ale clone, although it is not a brown ale. Real smooth drinker. I could definitely put a handful of these back in short order. Would recommend."
"D-This one is quite a bit hoppier than I'm used to for an Alt, but it's still a very solid beer."
"O- this isnt a style i usually choose, or one that im overly familiar with. it was an enjoyable offering from a local brewery. ill check this one out again."
"Not my among my top 3 Altbiers, but still a good quality brew perfect for tossing back a few on a summer afternoon."
"Overall- this is nice. Not a beer I'd drink very often, but not a beer I'll pass up if it's offered. I love Metropolitan, especially Krankshaft. This is another of their well-made beers."
"amber with lots of visisble carbonation and amazing clarity. A big three inch fluffy white pilow head on top faded quickly leaving behind just a hint of lace. The aroma was very malty. Lots of cereal and bread smells, along with a touch of banana. The flavor was light and very good. Lots of grains and bready like flavors, bit very nice balance, with a touch of banana of pear like fruit and a hint of spice as well. A nice strong finish left the mouth ddry and begging for another sip. The carbonation was great and mixed with a smooth subtle feel made this extremmely drinkable. Overall a very nice offering and definitly a quality session beer. I would look forward to trying this one again in the future"
"O- The nice clean crisp Alt has a very fresh malt flavor with some good depth to the toasted malts and a hint of darker malt comes through as another subtle layer. This is well lagered with a nice hop snap to finish the taste."
"pours a dark orange with some copper in the center, a light tope head provides some great sponge pattern lace to observe... nose is tough, pungent caramel, wet hops, and a bit skunky, not a fan of this at all... taste is a bit better as the sweet toffee notes are more tolerable but still a wet grain, bitter skunk finish... not my thing"
"O: I admit I was expecting a bit more of a hop kick as the label claimed ""assertively hoppy", but what's here is certainly not a disappointment. A really solid brown ale that's as clean as it gets. The only downside is it does seem a little thin and watery (taste wise) at times. Still good stuff."
"The reveal is Metropolitan Brewing Co. Iron Works Alt."
"Overall: This is an excellent beer from a rising brewery. This, like all of Metropolitan's offerings is a great, crisp, and refreshing session beer. Really solid stuff here!"
"O: Too many flaws for this beer to be any good."
"Full boded and slightly roasted with much more of a hop forward flavor than I expected. Dry, earthy hop notes give off some pine needle flavor and faint bitterness that linger throughout over the sweet malt profile into a slightly dry finish. The bitterness compliments the toasted/roasted malt character nicely, giving the beer good balance. Hints of caramel, rye, toffee, biscuit and nut. I'm also picking up some faint fruit, especially apricot. Pretty complex and easy to drink. Decent interpretation of the style."
"Overall, this is an excellent beer. Great taste, clean and crisp, great mouthfeel and carbonation, very easy to drink. Highly recommend picking this one up."
"D: I would go back to this alt as a change from the far too oft brown ales that rest in the pits of faux Britannia."
"O -- The nutty character up front in this beer reminds me of some American Oktoberfests; something I don't expect in an Okto, but I find very nice in this beer. The balance between clean and complex flavor characters is outstanding. I don't wonder that having these Metro beers be so fresh isn't the key to their perfection. Another that I may reassess because it may be about perfect."
"O: a very tasty and good-looking offering from my hometown boys, Metropolitan Brewing. This would be a great beer with a plate of Brats and cole slaw."
"True to teh real McCoy from Germany, lots of malty, with a spritz of hops to balance everything out. Toasted white bread, biscuits, illed grain, crumpets, and the earthiness from the hops. Very well rounded and sessionable. Thank you sir may I have another!"
"PICK THIS ONE UP!"
"Glad to see Metro branching out, can't wait to see what else they have up their sleeves..."
"O: Metro has a beer to be proud of in this one. It's a very solid rendition of an alt, something that Uerige or Kutscher would be happy to call their own. At just under ten bucks for the sixer, this is a great pick-up if you're into German styles or just some easy drinking."
"Overall, I seriously enjoyed this beer and plan on buying again for sure. Worth trying if you have access to Metropolitan Brewing beers."
"One of the best Alts you'll find in the US. An immensely drinkable beer with loads of flavor, just the right bitter backbone, and a touch of hop bite. Nice, full mouthfeel. Creamy head with a ton of lace. I had it on tap at Hopleaf. Can't wait to compare it to the bottled version."
"A great addition to Metro's line-up. I look forward to grabbing a sixer of this. The fat robot on the label is pretty gnarly too."
