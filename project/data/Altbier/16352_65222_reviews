"Review according to BJCP2008 guidelines (style 7C). AROMA: predominant malt aroma. almost absent hop aroma and absent esters. APPEARANCE: Orange copper color, clear, ivory persistent and creamy head. TASTE: well balanced flavour between moderate bitterness and complex malt. dry finish. very low esters, no diacetyl. Finishes dry. very low hop flavours. PALATE: medium to light body and very smooth. no astringency. OVERALL: a very well balanced, bitter and malty ale. requires a bit more hop aromas and flavours."
"Well, actually a Sticke Altbier. Not quite the same... I'm reviewing this as a Sticke. My rating would be quite higher if this was a regular Altbier."

"O: Now I need to state upfront that I have been to Dusseldorf and visited and tried all of the altbiers available there which probably has made me a touch overly critical of the style. I think there was an excellent balance to this beer with the upfront sweetness and light bitterness in the finish. Definitely an enjoyable beer."

"Overall a tasty representation of the style."

"O: This is a really nice brew that could be a good 2-3 pint session brew at BMB. It packs hoppiness, maltiness, and a smooth, drinkable feel into one package."
"Overall a good, drinkable beer."

"O - The Evan Altmighty is a nice example of the altbier style. A very pleasant and well-balanced brew."

"O: Nice altbier, if a bit boring. Very drinkable and sure to find wide appeal. I might not have it again, but I suppose I'd recommend it."
"Lovely golden amber color. On the nose- rich malt and barley with a caramel overtone. Leaves a slight lace on the side of the glass. Lively and rich, extremely drinkable with a nice complexity that prevents it from being boring. One of the better VA session beers that I've tried. Purchased a growler on draft to go at The Wine Seller."

"Drinkability: So I notice something I'm doing with drinkability as I've reviewed BMB brews, and I think it's been a little unfair of me. Whenever I have a Blue Mountain Kolsch and think about how drinkable it is, I realize that - though I'm mostly thinking about the beer itself - I'm also evoking memories out sitting outside the brewery tasting room in the shadow of the Shenandoah Mountains in beautiful Nelson County, VA, gazing out over the Cascade hop fields and the neighboring bucolic farms and vineyards, soaking up the perfect 78 degree late August afternoon air as it blows down Skyline Drive and the Appalachian Trail. Essentially, I'm thinking about how perfect that beer is for that time and for that place, and how perfect that place is. And you know what? I'm ok with that. I'm ok with rewarding a beer brewed for outside summer drinking with an enhanced drinkability score because it reminds me - even when I'm not drinking it outside during the summer - of how perfect it is to drink it in the manner in which it was intended to be drank. This beer offers something similar to me, though with a cold winter twist. That is, it's a rustic, roasty, earthy brew, traditionally brewed and laid down over the winter for early new year enjoyment ... and I can imagine few things nicer than sipping one on a chilly January evening, awaiting tonight's snowstorm, relaxing with friends. There are few experiences I can point that bring the importance of drinking (and eating, for that matter) seasonally (and locally). Soapbox aside, this is just a superbly well made, easy drinking beer, flavorful, relatively low in abv, and one I hope BMB makes again next year."
