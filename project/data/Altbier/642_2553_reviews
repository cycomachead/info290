"Slightly sweet with a firm bitterness that balances nicely. Great brew."
""
"This 'Altbier' (German for 'old style') style brew pours a pretty copper-amber in color with close to a finger of a off-white foamy head. Some 'ring-like' lacing is seen when sipped that sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is of mostly nutty roasted malts. Pretty much is said for the taste as well with good very light bitter finish that doesn't last too long. Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Overall a tasty brew."

"The medium body has both crispness and smoothness to it, though it leans light and the soft carbonation keeps up at the end of the session slightly less than it began."

"Overall - glad I got to try it"
"This is a solid (if not particularly memorable) local beer from Lawrence, Kanasas. This is a rather dark beer with a small fuzzy head, and, as advertised, a great balance between malts and hops. The malts will hit you first--smooth, coffee-flavored, full-bodied. Then come the grainy, spicy hops. The flavor is rather pronounced but neither element is very strong. Great beer."

"Overall, I think there is one way to describe this beer; an awesome American take on a German style that might beat the native Germans in terms of a smooth drinking lager."

"the beer poured ruby red/brownish. The head was thin and not too hearty as is disappeared quickly. It did maintain a little head to the finish but the lacing was scant. The taste was somewhat bready with a hint of molasses. Mouthfeel was really nice..very crisp with a medium amount of carbonation. Overall, a very good beer for a hot day. I wouldnt have a problem drinking a few of these!."

"O: Another solid beer from Free State this one doesn't do anything mind-blowing but is still a very well crafted beer and a good representation of the style."

"Beer is medium in body and strong. It has a nice finish to it but not my favorite alt I've had. A little roasty on the back end. Eh. I might have it again."
""

"Overall, I like it. I just may not have this one very often. It's an easy-drinking beer, and well crafted from this brewery."
""
"a beautiful deep amber pour with a half inch of head. smells of floral hops, caramel sweetness and honey. tastes of chocolate, cherry, caramel.. really sweet! light body crossing over to medium body with moderate carbonation. very easy to go down, very tasty, and very enjoyable overall."

"O: Honestly not bad, a pretty simple and malty beer. Drinkable and inoffensive."

"Pours a clear, brown color. 6/4 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of slight earthy malt, slight caramel malt, hops, slight sweet malt, and a hint of citrus. Fits the style of an Altbier. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, hint of citrus, hint of grass, slight earthy malt, hint of caramel, and a hint of honey. Overall, good appearance, aroma, feel, and blend."
"A deep dark brownish red with a creamy tan head. Smell is a bit of dark fruit and freshly cut hay. Taste is initially some munich malt sweetness, followed by a cinnamony, rye bread middle, and a slightly tart, earthy finish. Mouthfeel is rich, cask like carbonation. Overall a good beer. Not too often you find an altbier in the USA."
"Drink- It's good. I liked it, but needs to even out with some pop behind it."
"Drinks easy enough, but nothing special as Alts go"
"Yet another superior Kansas beer. I'm becoming quite the fan of KS beers I must admit."
"I like the beer overall but the flavor on the finish is a little strange."
"Pours an amberish copper with a creamy white head on it. Smells of toasts malts with a bit of nut character. The taste is close to the nose with a nice toasted malt but deviates from the aroma in that it has a stronggrassy hop bitterness. I don't lnow if it my palate or this brewery but I am getting a lot of grass hop on their beers. As Ith their other beers, I really enjoy the story behind the name and appreciate the effOrt put into the beer but it isn't one I would necessarily go out of my way for. Worth a try, though?, definitely."
"Not a great beer, but I certainly could drink a lot of them."
"Thanks Dan (and Ratman) for sharing this one last night. Although I sincerly appreciate it, I did not enjoy it. Poured a dark amber color with a little bit of head on top. Aromas of cardboard, nuts and caramel. Medium bodied, with flavors of cardboard, roasted nuts and caramel malt. Kind of sad, maybe this one sat for a while."
"This was quite an interesting beer, with some characteristics keeping this closer to traditional Amber Ale and then others finding their over more over to the Altbier category. It never really seems to find it's footing in the middle of the two. That being said though, this is by no means a bad beer in any way and just seems a little confused. There is still more than enough flavor and drinkibility for you to take a chance on it. Worth a look."
"The beer pours a deep rusty copper with a rocky white head. The head dissipates to leave a sticky lace on the sides of the glass. The smell of the beer is pure malty sweetness. The beer tastes of sweet roasty malts with a good balance of hop bitterness on the back end of the drink. The beer finishes relative clean, with just a slight malty sweetness. This is one of those great sessionable beers. Well worth picking up a six pack of."
"O- This is a nice fall/winter beer. I really like this and it would be good as a dinner pairing as well, with a burger or steak, or BBQ. A nice example of the ""altbier"" style."
"This is an OK beer. Too sweet and malty for me. The lack of any hop character is a downer for me. Great beer but not in the category for me. Very smooth and goes down easy is a plus though. Great beer Free State Brewing!!!"
"D: Very nice, drinkable beer; first beer from Free State but hopefully not the last"
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: in between light and medium bodied and pretty smooth drinking overall. This is definitely a beer that I could drink a few of, pretty nice. Looking forward to trying more from Free State."
"Ad Astra Ale is a beer I got from a Reddit Secret Santa gift. It is a nice looking reddish brown beer with just a little lace of rocky head. The beer smells darkly toasty like pumpernickel bread and also a little sweet caramel malt. The beer is a little fruity, very nicely malty and accented with good german hoppy bittering. This is a good beer with a nice aftertaste that I definitely enjoyed."
"Will be in my normal rotation as long as I can keep getting it around town."
"Pours a moderate brown color with a slight rusty tint. Short white head. The nose brigs some fruits and lift caramel plus a small amount of hops. Bad news underneath though. Just like other beers here, we were unfortunate to get somethig bad going on, as the taste here was quite buttery as well. Luckily this hadn't pervaded other aspects of the beer all that much. It's too bad as I really enjoyed their barleywine and that had no off flavors at all. Maybe we just happened to catch a bad time either with brewing or bad lines. It was at the brewpub though, so either way I have to say that it's on them."
"This is my favorite at the local water hole. The poor is full with a nice 1/2 inch head that is creamy white. The smell is rather intoxicating itself but the mouthfeel is smooth and it goes down glass after glass. The taste is slightly sweet and fruity, usually reminding me of plum. It carries a good amount of kick and after 5 I feel like I want one more. It has the right balance between hoppiness and yeast which makes this Altbier a pure delight."
"D: Very drinkable, for the smooth and fine quality of the malt, a good medium bodied ale with a hefty malt flavor and a light balance of floral hops. This is one of the most popular beers in Lawrence, and it is obvious why. I can only hope Freestate goes national soon."
"It's a good choice and recipe for a house beer. Different enough not to be just another amber ale in the portfolio."
"Free State is an impressive little brewery that is slowly but surly expanding. Their Ad Astra ale is one of their oldest offering but it holds up as a worthy part of their lineup."
"It is a deep reddish brown, with clarity. The head doesn't last long. It smells and tastes malty, and reminds me of a marzen style beer. It drinks smoothly and cleanly, excellent for accompanying food. A definite favorite."
"Aroma was mainly malty with mild multigrain and sunflower seed notes. Flavor was similarly bready with some light sweetness that finished dry. There were some notes of earthy hop as it came to room temperature. The body was light for an alt, but this rendered it very drinkable. I drank my half of the growler no problem. Free State is on my radar, hope to visit the brewpub someday."
"The body was full and well rounded, not heavy and very smooth. Drinkability was great, if available to me, this would be a regular quaff. Overall, a wonderful beer that makes me want to visit Kansas."
"D-Not a bad beer but this one was a bit too boring for me. I found nothing exceptional about it. A good ""training wheels"" craft beer"
"Drinkability is fairly high with good flavors."
"D - This is a very good alt and yet another good brew from the Free State Brewery."
"Overall this is one of my ""go-to"" beers at Free State. It's a real smooth, easy drinking, award winning beer."
"Draught: Mine poured a clear amber color that was tinged with red. It had a bit of an off-white head that left a decent amount of lacing down the glass. The aroma was a bit weak, while still nice. It was somewhat malty and a bit grassy. The taste was much better. A decent maly body without any real sweetness. A bit of a roastiness to it with a hint of coffee. A fair amount of biterness to it. This is really a decent brew."
"Most drinkable!"
"Taste was a good balance of malt and hops, citurs and nut. Good finish, wanted more"
"As Astra is a pretty good session beer. Not a lot there to overwhelm, but enough to make it interesting. Dark red to brown in color, served with no head. Aromas of backed goods, and some brown sugar. Light sweet toasted flavor with decent bitterness. Light inthe body."
"On draught at Old Chicago in Overland Park, Kansas. Excellent altbier. Pleasant malty aroma and flavor, with nice, rich dark reddish-brown color. Light head that disappears rather quickly. Nice orange aftertaste to go along with initial terrific flavor."
"This copper hued ale was the first to be brewed in Kansas since the wild west days. This is an easy drinking beer, with a slight sweet edge that is balanced nicely with the hops. Perhaps too easy drinking on a monday night with $1.75 pints on tap. This is excellent beer."
"A good beer, Free State's first, and I believe possibly the first beer brewed in Kansas after it became legal again. A good one to try, and probably try again, but not really that outstanding."
"Clear, dark reddish/slightly bronzy hue, served with a thick off-white head, excellent retention, laced well. Clean nose there was a slight dull maltiness disappointing, mute invitation. Moderately flavorsome palate, the maltiness is the focal point, accomplished, the hops play a minor supporting rule, they do add a touch of bitterness. Some caramel and nut hints too. Nicely balanced if not too soft. Modest carbonation. The finish is clean decent enough to drink. Not really that impressive of an offering try something else."
"Deep clear amber color, nice white lasting head, malty bready aroma. Light and sweet caremel malt flavor, some light hop flavor stand out in a clean dry finish, light body and a thin, watery mouthfeel, a good one for microswill drinkers just to bland for me."
"This American amber ale possesses a deep amber color with no head.  The very insignificant aroma is slightly of malt.  A nice smooth heavier body supports a sharp malt sweetness and a lingering bitterness.  The sweetness becomes a bit harsh toward the bottom of the glass, but a latent fruity spice helps to curb it some."
"Dark orange / copper in color and very clear.  Impressive, thick and sticky head.  Nutty, lightly roasted malt aroma, w/ a mild green and floral Hallertauer nose.  Toasted and dark caramel malt flavors are accompanied by moderate hop bitterness.  The medium body and fairly high carbonation make this brew quite effervescent and refreshing.  The finish is quite dry and tannic, but in a pleasant way.  Ad Astra is an all around very drinkable beer and a fine example of a style that isn't brewed enough."
