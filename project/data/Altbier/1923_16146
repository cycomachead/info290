I tend to skew towards domestics, and altbiers are one of the few styles that do not seem to be prevalent in my area. So, in order to review this beer, I can't really compare it to other altbiers off the top of my head, but overall, Uerige Sticke stands it's ground as a solid ale! Unlike other brown ales, this altbier isn't overcome with molasses and caramel flavors, this has a more fruity flavor with a hint of smokiness. When poured, the head is lush, and when you take a sip, the suds stick to the liquid, giving a generous, aerated sipping quality that is quite refreshing. After you swish around the lovely flavor and swallow, the aftertaste maintains the essence of the beer itself, with no degradaton. A very tasty experience!","supercodes","Beers"

Caramel comes up too with a faint earthy hop in the middle, no trace of the 6%. Feel is medium, carb is there but not felt under the body.

Out of the flip-top bottle this beer was a clear, copper/brown color with one finger of head. The retention was good and the lacing consistent down my glass. The aroma was a complex mix of malts, caramel, rum, some wood and nuts as well as some golden raisin. The flavors were not quite as pronounced as the aroma for me but the balance was ideal. Caramel, burnt caramel, nuts, earth and then a kick of piney hops to finish it. Very, very drinkable assuaged by the quick, clean finish of an otherwise very malty beer. The body was medium and the carbonation average as well which also encouraged quaffing. Impresive.","thekevlarkid","Jan 01, 2011"

As it warms I can pick out subtle notes of mineral and soil. The palate shares the same berry-like character that I detect in the aroma, but it's also aggressively hoppy. Malty, lightly toasted but quite dry, hops take over mid-palate and leave a lingering bitterness that suggests citrus rind, bitter herbs, earth and minerals.

Deep caramel malt character is present, with honey contrasting well against the hops. On the palate, it opens with a firm hop bitterness, very grassy in nature. Surprisingly bitter. Malt character is deep, with mild brown sugar, honey and jaggery, while remaining very light on the palate. Finishes dry and bitter with a mild sweetness.

The beer is a highly-sedimented medium copper with ample carbonation, topped with a two-finger tannish head that slowly recedes to a creamy cover, leaving tons of lacing on the glass. Very earthy in the nose, with perfumy/green hops and a roasted malt backing. Nice roasted and caramel malts on the palate, a little chewy, with a complex, fairly bitter hop profile that contributes perfumy/floral/leafy notes and lots of lingering oils. It has a well-carbonated, medium body that imparts a dry, fairly long finish.

Moderate caramel aromas swirl about a pungent grassy, fresh hop scent that promises a more hoppy Alt than most I've had. Flavors are more dry and better attenuated than the nose suggests. The beer has some low-lying sweetness but stronger caramel flavors. Cracker-like and lightly biscuit-like. The hops are quite strong and balances the beer beautifully. A firm bitterness hangs in the back of the throat while giving a firm floral, spicy, German hop, herbal-grassy flavor. Super crisp and dry in the body; the beer basically evaporates in the mouth.

There's a nice little bit of bitter astringency in the finish, which works well with the initial hit of sweetness. Mouthfeel is moderate in weight, but it's kind of fizzy for me. Delicious. This is definitely the best the best altbier I've tried. Very quaffable considering the abv.","goochpunch","May 13, 2008"

A fine thread of faint herbal hoppiness comes around before powdery grain husk brings in the finale. Moderate carbonation cleans and dries out the finish further Â– its effervescence creates subtle, earthy notes that were perhaps missed in the initial nose.

ThereÂ’s considerable malt in the aromaÂ….lots of caramel, along with a lightly toasted, Vienna-like character. Very light hop smell also mingles with the malt, but takes a decidedly back seat. Slightly dry and nutty taste, with the malt character following through. Bitterness develops late in the mid-taste, and the beer finishes with a nice, lingering bitterness. Very clean and crispÂ…reminiscent of a lager. Very drinkable, with an entertaining balance. This is an extraordinarily good brew.","Suds","Sep 25, 2005"

The taste is lightly sweet and fairly malty with notes of caramel. This is quite fruity as well with notes of cherry, raisins, and a bit of strawberry and some notes of bergemot as well. For some reason the fruity character in an Alt I have always associated as an interesting mix of hop and malt character.

Tastes sweet nutty caramel and toffee with a piercing sour countering beneath. Yeah, I'm sorry, but that sour pine-sol flavor is just ruining it for me. Let's see what I can get after it warms to room temperature. The sour is still present, but it comes across as more of a black patent sour than a pine sol sour. There is also come coffee roast.

I detected an apple-like smell, but maybe it was just my sensorial schematics. The Sticke, German for ""secret," a fact which other reviewers may have addressed - I never read previous reviews prior to putting mine online, is extremely light-bodied for an altbier and offers a seductive hint of malt, yet still holds back to prevent overwhelming other aspects.

4.23,3.2,4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Poured into a Middle Ages imperial half pint glass, formed a 1/4"" light toffee head over a clear, caramel-hued brew. Laced well. Aroma is lightly of yeast, and a snippet of malts, but not prominent, I'm afraid. Taste is smooth caramel, which slithers across the tongue, and just as you start to think it perhaps may be a bit too sweet, the hops take over, clear the malt out, and change the taste completely. Very nice. Mouthfeel excellent, and drinkability is as well. Excellent brew, easily can see how this would be mind-boggling fresh and/or on-tap.","ppoitras","May 21, 2004"

4.5,9.8,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5," The mouthfeel is smooth with light carbonation and a medium body. A big malt backbone compliments the nice floral and citrus flavors well. It has sour notes as well as a nice cinnamon flavor to it. A buttery flavor comes and goes. The complexity is pretty well-rounded and well-balanced. Roasted flavors jump out in the dry finish. It is extremely drinkable, and I could have a few of these during a sitting. I think that this one really defines what I like in an alt. This is one quality brew that you shouldn't miss.","ElGuapo","May 09, 2004"
4.22,2.9,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,"Orange brown body with a foamy white head. Aroma presents rather vague bready and earthy malt which is caramelic. Surprisingly, yeast plays an important part giving it an interesting banana fruitiness. The 60 ibus appear rather well hidden though, mostly displayed as peppery hints. It doesnÂ’t seem too complex though. Once you take a sip though, itÂ’s immediately superior to the aroma. ThereÂ’s a very spicy hoppiness complementing the beautiful yeast. The image IÂ’d use to describe it is a flower in a cemetary. Aftertaste is rather complex as well, grassy, green, robust yet balanced with tea hints. Medium bodied with rather low carbonation. I didnÂ’t expect to enjoy it that much and was expecting an hyped alt for itÂ’s rather rare, but this is worth seeking.","Rastacouere","May 06, 2004"

4.12,0.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Bottled in 29 01 best by 29 02, well that's what the bottle says let's give it a shot anyhow. Appearance: Pours a nice caramel amber tone with a nice sized bubbly tannish cream head leaves even specks of lacing. When I cracked the flip top seal their was a huge pop almost champagne bottle like. Aroma: Caramel sweet sugary malts that are very appetizing blended with a nut edge and grassy noble hop finish. Taste: Big sticky flavors seems like the pinnacle of the altbier style, really ties everything together. Mild sweetness with grassy leafy herbal notes that represent the German hop flavor here decent bitterness in the finish. Very good alt gets my approval and the bottle I have says it's 6%abv, I think when I find a fresher bottle I will definitely grab one seems like some of the malts would be more flavorful if fresh but good stuff nonetheless. Mouthfeel: Medium bodied german ale very even carbonation to me, not bad. Drinkability: Like I said this beer sets the bar for the style I haven't had any alt that was this enjoyable easily could drink a few of these would like to go to Dusseldorf and sample on draft.","WVbeergeek","Apr 09, 2004"

The taste is quite malty and deep upfront with the various spices and flavors working their way into your tastebuds. The middle is very roasty and malty, and the finish provides you with a nice bitter blast, and lingering aftertaste of spicy hops. The mouthfeel is thick, but not too thick for the style and the drinkability is very very good. I'm very glad I got a chance to sample this rare nectar!","francisweizen","Mar 30, 2004"

There is a little bit of lacing left on the glass. The smell has lots of fresh hops to it, and some sweet caramel lingering. The taste has toffee and caramel all over it, nice and malty at first. The finish is a brave dose of hops, and just a touch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is as thick and smooth as an Altbier can get! And the drinkability is just perfect. I could knock several of these down.

The beer is a dark brown/amber with an ultra thin off-white head. Very little lacing. The aroma is nice and full, with caramel, malt and sweet fruit. Medium-bodied and very drinkable with a pleasing blend of flavors such as malt, raisin, caramel and hops. The finish is the only place it falls off a little. There is a slight metallic tinge to the fruity finish that was out of character with the beer. A slightly bigger hops finish would make it nearly perfect.

No visible head, the tiniest wisps of bubbles float on top for a bit. Color is a crystal clear polished brown suede. Aroma is very sweet and caramely, just a hint of alcohol and hops. Taste is very sweet and malty, nice caramelization and a bit of nutty/woody flavor, alcohol is noticeable up front as well. Maltiness gives way to a startling hop bitterness that becomes more apparent as the beer warms a bit, leaving it just a bit dry at the finish.
