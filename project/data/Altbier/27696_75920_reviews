"Once more, the Crack! revealed a brimful craft CAN and I feel as though I have gained something extra in the bargain. The inverted Glug revealed a darker beer than I had been expecting (dummy, me) and this produced a very noticeable pseudo-cascade which settled into three fingers of dense, puffy, light-tan head with excellent retention. Color was Brown – Dark Brown (SRM = > 22, "

"I'm a big altbier fan and now I have another choice, made better in that it's a local brewery (as local as we can get here in Tx). One more plus is that it comes in cans. Very nice job hops and malt!"

"O- Altbiers don't seem to be a very popular or trendy style. Most that I have had have been drinkable but not too exciting. This is absolutely the best I have had in the style."

"Overall: Never had an Alt before but this was quite tasty. I really liked H&G's Zoe and wanted to give this a shot. So far, I like what they are doing there in Austin. I would be more than happy breaking this out during any get together."

"This is a tasty beer overall and it’s the type of beer that most everyone will like who tries it. It already has one major award under its belt and will likely win more in due time. It’s a nice beer in most every way and I recommend a tasting, if you can find it."

"The beer pours a dark copper brown color with a solid off white head. I detected a nutty aroma with a bit of a caramel sweetness and a hint of tobacco. Some earthy hop flavor up front followed by a malty sweetness, slightly roasty with just a hint of chocolate. It's light/ medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a crisp, slightly dry finish. Solid beer all around, for $6.99 a six-pack I would go back to this one regularly."

"O/D - A good albeit a bit heavy altbier. ABV is manageable, and a bit filling. A good fall beer I would reckon."

"Appearance is typical brown ale-ish. Smells a lot like a mix of Shiner Bock and a brown. Taste just does not hit altbier on the head enough. I'm not too stuck on ""style," but when you say this is an altbier, and I get my tastebuds ready for an altbier, it better be an altbier. This tastes like a Shiner Bock with hints of brown ale, which is cool and all, but I want a real altbier, dammit. Too toasty. Oh, TX brewers, this tastes like the ""old ale"" from Southern Star. I'm starting to think US brewers just like the NAMES of STYLES and like to tag them to their random half-assed homebrew concoctions. Mouthfeel is so-so. Can't really describe it, just kind of there. Not crazy about this."
""
""
"Taste has some nice nut and coffee flavors and the mouthfeel is rich for an alt with barely a touch of sweetness. It is a tad on the astringent side though and just needs a bit more caramel and sugary malt to even things out. Not too shabby, I'll probably pick this up every once and a while, but I dont see it making it into the regular rotation."

"I don't think I have had a true Altbier before, and this one seems pretty legit. Similar to a dark lager or Schwarzbier, and ultra drinkable. Something I would recommend."

"Great opening taste from Hops & Grain, look forward to trying more. Cheers to new breweries in Texas!"

"Thanks, Phoenix2443, for the opportunity"

"It seemed that the more I drank the more the light burnt taste came through, not really sure if it was in a good way or not. I wish I had brought more of this back from Austin. I could run some more taste tests, seriously."
"A really rich and tasty version of the Altbier style. On tap at the Westside Alehouse, somewhere behind a motel on I-35 in Nowheresville, Texas."

"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce aluminum can, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice. Purchased at Spec's today."

"Lovely beer. Smooov and mellow, and all with a roasty-toasty-malty finish as per the style I suppose. What hops? But that's OK. The dark brown pour implies a malt-bomb-wallop, but no such bludgeoning exists. Subtle is the word that comes to mind, and after a few sips a bit of caramelized complexity. I taste toast. And a raisin. And maybe some hay. And it's my new fishing beer at 5.1%"
" aroma, but overall a fantastic beer."
""
"O- Good. I think I actually preferred this one out of a can versus the pint glass. Can seemed to better harness the aroma ..."

"The beer pours a brownish color with a beige head. The aroma is very malty with a lot of caramel and toffee notes. The flavor is more of the same. There is a lot of brown sugar, caramel and toffee, as well as a little bit of nuttyness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Straightforward, but enjoyable."
""
""
"It pours a brown amber color with a ruby hue to it. There’s a light caramel aroma to this. Tastes of caramel malts while hinting at some cherries. There’s a piney hop flavor and a piney, almost herbaceous finish. I’m kinda geeked out to see that Hops & Grain is brewing an alt as one of their year-round beers."
"The flavor has a straightforward bitterness about it that's earthy and green on the tongue. Caramel-toffee maltiness is clean and somewhat spicy on the finish. The spritzy body is nicely carbonated, but feels a bit too thin on the back end. A minor nit-pick for an all-around excellent altbier. Perfect for the cool Austin weather this time of year."
