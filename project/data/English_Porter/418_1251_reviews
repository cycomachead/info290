"Don't be fooled by the BA score of 84.  This is literally a perfect porter.  The first time I had it, it blew me away.  The second time I had it I got it on tap at a bar and it was even better.  Smooth and chocolatey with a roasted coffee aroma, it was nearly too beautiful to drink.  As the beer warmed up the flavours became even more pronounced.  This beer is beyond a score of 84, I'm not exactly a 'beer expert' but I know that everyone I know who has had this porter has raved about it.  Go out and give it a try."

"Great job again Left Hand!"
""
"Weak watered-down brew, with no backbone."
""
""
"Overall: Another win for Left Hand in my book - it doesn't displace their Milk Stout as my favourite Left Hand brew but as porters go this is a mighty good one."
""

"2.83/5: Whoops, I just went bust"

"The color was a little lighter than I expected, with virtually no head, but the smelland taste more than made up for it."

"Overall:  This is a damn good porter!  Great flavors of toasted malt and brown sugar!  Delicious!"
""

"Best porter I've ever had. Ever."
"Pours a bit light for a porter, has some auburn notes, little to no head retention at all.  Aroma is malty and sweet.  Tastes very simple for a porter.  Everything about this beer is a little bit thinner than what I was hoping for.  Good carbonation.  Overall not bad, but there are definitely a lot of better porters out there."
"Overall I found the beer to be somewhat disappointing.  It did not have any particularly bad qualities but it did not give me much of a reason to come back for more.  I would drink it again but I wonâ€™t be actively searching for it."
""
"Everything about the approach of this beer is great. When it hits your mouth it seems just okay. Would buy again but only if 3rd or 4th on the shelf."

"Solid beer, to me it's more like a thin stout tho. Very enjoyable coffee & malt sweetness"

"Pours a very dark mahogany brown with ruby highlights in color, very close to black. Has a thin beige head with some spotty lacing seen when sipped. The aroma is of dark roasted malts, cocoa, and a hint of vanilla. More going on with the taste with a hint of black coffee and even a wee bit of black licorice in the mix. A tasty Porter that isn't over done at all. Medium+-bodied with perfect carbonation. Really liked this one!"
""
""
""
"O- A straightforward porter that leans more toward the chocolaty side but isn't very sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
"This was HEAVY. A meal on its own. I love and have had many porters, but this one seemed denser than normal. Rich chocolate and Carmel notes. I will say, the label had me slightly confused. The ""J" kind of looks like an 'S", and I'm genuinely uncomfortable drinking something called ""Black Sack."" Ami alone in this?!"
""

"O - One of the better porters I've had in a while. My favorite character is the smoothness of the body."

"BBD 3/09/15.  Very dark amber pour, but not opaque, with a dark ruby element. Below average head, lacing and retention.  Very weak nose of roast and chocolate over a mineral note.  Nice medium body with a touch of creamy texture.  Below normal carbonation with minimal effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is outstanding - intense, balanced and complex. It begins with bitter dark chocolate that flows into a blend of light roast and coffee.  The middle is moderate hop bitterness over a light sweetness with nut and grain characteristics.  The finish is somewhat clean with a slightly astringent note."

"O. Slightly above average porter. I would recommend to porter drinkers. Pretty decent buzz for 6.8%. The label is awesome like the rest of LF labels."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Notes:  A very good example of the style and quite drinkable.  I will certainly pick this one up again.  Cheers."
""
""
""
"This isn't my favorite Left Hand beer, but it's a pretty good porter nonetheless.  Has the requisite coffee and chocolate flavor of a porter, but not as smoky as some.  Probably would go for their Milk Stout if given the choice between the two."
""
""
""
""
"Recommended. Not my favourite porter but certainly one to come back to. Not as flavoursome as the 6.8% ABV might suggest."

"Taste is pretty down the middle with a good amount of porter char and roasted chocolate.  Mouth is cooling and char and very porter like.  Nothing really fancy about this, just a run of the mill porter.  No big coffee, no deep chocolate, no vanilla...good, not great."
""
"One of the lighter-colored porters I've had. It's quite nice."

"Fairly light pour, clear deep brown with minimal head that dissipates to nothing. Aroma is chocolatey and nutty, with a hint of roast. Deep caramel emerges. More deep chocolate and bitter roast, with toffee notes and a slightly bitter finish. Lots of chocolate."

"O: I usually only rate one beer a day and I was tempted to dump this one and sneak in one more tonight. It is really underwhelming. No real flavor or smell to make it worth continuing. It has a best by date of 7/14/14 (next month) so it still has some life in theory. I won't get this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall I like this beer but it is a little boring."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I can't say this is a bad beer, but it pales (literally) in comparison to many other porters. Decent for the price (paid ~11 for the 6 in a low tax state). Might be better with a light meal, and definitely one that can be consumed in high volume. Alcohol is certainly present. If you're looking for a full bodied, knock-your-socks-off, dark flavor, I wouldn't recommend. I would bring to a party, but it didn't satisfy my craving."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black Jack has a nice dark complexion right out of the bottle. Smells of a dark roast of coffee with hints of cocoa present. Taste is nutty and filled with coffee, with the chocolate coming in late with a bitter hop finish. A good porter, remarkably easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: I found this porter to be very easy to drink. I would definitely consider this beer to be sessionable. The aromas and flavors from the chocolate malts are particularly inviting."

""
""
""
""
""
""

"Really good Porter. Light head and nutty aroma. Mild carbonation and a really smooth body. Dark roasted flavor offset with a soft sweetness, taste some vanilla. Finish is nice and bright with a little bitter hoppiness. Great beer with balance in taste and body."

"Overall, this beer is great. I would say it's pretty drinkable, although it's very filling. I would recommend to anyone looking for a dark, roasty 'Robust Porter,' and will definitely buy again. Certainly a contender for my 'go-to beer' for the upcoming winter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A solid porter that is definitely worth a try. I was hoping for a bit more of the espresso component but the chocolate through in a nice porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: A bit dry and unsubstantial for a porter, almost comes across as a roasty black lager (with less carbonation). Style aside, the beer is drinkable and tasty and 2-3 can be quaffed in a sitting. At 6.4%, this is a very smooth and balanced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: More in the vein of an English brown porter, which I was not expecting. No bells and whistles, but it's tasty and very approachable."

""
""
""
"A decent but not outstanding porter. Chocolate color with not much of a head. Smells biscuity with a few hints of chocolate. Kind of lacking in taste; follows suit with the scent and malty with a little bitterness at the end. It's not very strong or full-bodied compared to other porters I've had. Quaffable but not something I would buy again."

"Pours a Dark ruby/brown with a thin tan head. Aromas of Christmas spices and a hint of coffee. Taste begins with some tart fruit, followed by some dark chocolate, finishing with a piney, earthy, woody bitter finish. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a good Porter."

"Overall this is a vey enjoyable beer. Love the complexity of the taste!"

"Not bad but not exceptional. Looks a bit lacklustre, though the aroma is nicely rounded. Flavour is OK but not amazing - it lacks depth. Body is a bit too thin. A worthy effort, but it doesn't match the best porters I've tried - increased fruitiness in the flavour/aroma might improve it. There is the possibility that it has faded over time, although it doesn't seem off. Worth sampling, but no need to hunt it down."

"Left Hand Milk Stout is ubiquitous now. Everywhere you look, it's on nitro tap, and the Nitro bottles bring the experience home. Black Jack Porter doesn't get that kind of attention at all. It's the black sheep of the Left Hand lineup. Black Jack Porter pours a red-tinged deep brown with a couple fingers of head. The aroma is coffee and roast forward, a little on the burnt side, and there's something sweet here that doesn't quire meld. The taste is actually rather similar to their Milk Stout, just take out the lactose and push the coffee to the forefront instead of the chocolate. It's been a while since I've had a non-nitro Milk Stout, but I remember the normal variant having a similar mouthfeel - creamy and lightly carbonated. The drinkability is solid. Overall, Black Jack Porter was a good drink, but I'll take the Nitro Milk Stout over it every day."

"Pours very dark with little head. Smells of chocolate and caramel. Could sit and smell this beer all night, absolutely love it. The taste was as equally impressive. Caramel flavor with just minor bitterness. Very drinkable and found myself downing an entire 6 pack before I knew it. I'm looking forward to trying more from Left hand."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I enjoyed this beer but was a little disappointed. Perhaps I was mentally comparing this to Left Hand Milk Stout, one of my favorites, and it falls short. Overall, a decent beer."
""
"O: Good solid porter that I could have a few of."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is a nice, well rounded porter. Not particularly strong, rich or complex, but easy drinking, tasty and well-crafted."
""
""
""
""
"O: Maybe this beer was designed to be a session beer? I can't help but long for creamier, richer, more complex beers like Old Rasputin or Greenman's People's Porter after drinking this beer."
"Overall: Not crazy about this brew. Not something I would buy again, but is decent overall. For a similar price go get yourself some Founders Porter."
""
""
""
"I was surprised by this beer. It tastes better than its name suggest, which told me it might be a bit bitter being a black jack. It is incredibly smooth and rich."
"O â€“ I was pretty impressed with this porter. Normally, I think of porters as thinner versions of stouts with less robust aromas and tastes. Not so with this beer. While the appearance has me wishing for more, the aroma and taste is pretty damn good. The mouthfeel is one of the best around for a porter as far as Iâ€™m concerned. This one is not thin by any means. This is an all-around very nice beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I have never been impressed with a porter and this once again does not fulfill that task. Average at best. Luckily, this isn't real smokey. In a list of porters I may choose this but overall I would not order this again."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/2 inch head of an off-tan color. Good retention and great lacing. Smells of dry hops, sweet malt, oatmeal, slight pale malt, slight roasted malt, and a hint of alcohol. Fits the style of an English Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with a low carbonation level. Tastes of alcohol, roasted malt, sweet malt, dry hops, oatmeal, hint of pale malt, and a hint of liquor. Overall, good appearance, aroma, blend, body, and feel."

"Overall- A pretty average beer. Drinkable but not outstanding."

"Dark brown pour with a small cap of beige head; moderate retention and a bit of lacing. Dark malts in the nose, typical of a porter, fairly roasty, coffee notes, toasted bread. More of the same in the taste, toasted grains and malts, caramel, notes of coffee and cocoa, decent balance of sweet and bitter. Body was on the lighter side of medium, carbonation was moderate. Not a bad beer overall."
""
""
""

""
""
"O. Well crafted brew. Rock solid porter."
""
""

"A pretty smooth porter overall with a mild flavor profile. The 1.5yrs seem to have mellowed this out quite a bit."

"O - I enjoyed Black Jack Porter. I wouldn't turn down a pint of it, but at the same time there are more memorable options out there. I have sort of a soft spot for Left Hand, because their milk stout is one of my all-time favs, but this was a good beer regardless. I recommend it."
""

"This beer poured out as a deep brown color, the head was thin with a creamy tan color. The smell of the beer had some nice roasted notes without much of any hop aroma. The taste of the beer was probably the best part, it's was sort of creamy and lightly roasted. The mouthfeel was soft, gently carbonated and smooth. Overall this is a good brew in my opinion. I could see myself Drinking this one again."
""
""
"O - very nice sipper. I'm a fan of this porter."

"Pours black with a half thumbs width mocha head that quickly recedes to the edges. A rich and roasty aroma of roasted barley, chocolate, some coffee,and a nice dose of molassess. A big, rich flavor. Starts off with the molasses and some light coffee, then comes the roasted barley, then closes out with a nice creamy chocolate. Big flavor for the lower abv. Also kinda feels like a stout, thick and creamy. Overall, as expected a nice porter."
""
""
"O: Really wasn't expecting the boldness from the toasted malts and smokeyness here. Kind of curious what everyone else thought so i looked thru some reviews and im not sure if this particular bottle was off or what. Would def try it again and would like it to be on tap."
""
""

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 2/12/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent lacing on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, biscuit, nuttiness, light coffee, slight fruitiness, and herbal hops. Very pleasant and balanced aromas with decent strength. Taste of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, nuttiness, slight coffee, light fruitiness, and light herbal spiciness. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, toast, and roasted malt on the finish for a good bit. Great balance of flavors, and a nice malt backbone; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Very easy to drink with no alcohol presence other that a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice porter. A good amount of robustness, with great flavor balance; and very enjoyable. Really well done."
""
""
""
""
"O: On the whole, a decent enough beer, but not particularly memorable."
""
""
""
""
"D- this one is ok, but not the bomb. Less alcohol would be welcome."
""
"Black Jack Porter is one of the best porters Iâ€™ve ever had. Itâ€™s more wowing than Sierra Nevadaâ€™s totally respectable and enjoyable porter, though not as massive and flooring as Foundersâ€™. Glad to realize this is a year-round beer, as I will not want to wait a year for another release. I will be buying more soon. I like it a lot. Good work, Left Hand!"
""
"It's not bad, but I prefer my porters on the sweeter side."
"O- An above average porter - recommended for any occasion due to it's drinkability."
""
"A decent porter that does have a bit of an English feel, in body and flavor."

""

""

""

""

""

"Definitely give it a shot (even if just for the bottle art alone: I love the labels Left Hand puts out). Not one that necessarily warrants a fervent hunt for, but certainly worth drinking. Might be good for those who are not accustomed/who aren't super big into big dark beers (aka an intro porter to get a friend newly hooked??)."
""
"O: Not bad for the style. Not overpowering just an enjoyable Porter."
"Overall a very solid porter which I enjoyed greatly and would definitely recommend trying if given the chance. Classified as an ""English Porter"" which would be my first as far as I know."
"O: Solid porter but didn't really care for the mouthfeel or the floral hops in this combo."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Black Jack isn't bad beer, it's actually pretty decent beer, but it's too light even for English-style Porter. More like an English Brown with it's crystal malt driven backbone. Toffee, caramel chewiness, a hint of nutty roast in the background. Mild hopping with an earthy spice current just beneath the maltiness. With the exception of the Fade to Black Series, Left Hand beers seem to be getting dumbed down slowly over the years - just sayin'."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a nice middle of the road porter."
""
""
""
""
"M: Just a bit on the thin side, but still creamy and mostly satisfying, with enough texture to feel in a slightly dry presentation."
""
" Overall another solid entry from Left Hand, a good english porter that has a lil more in the body, mouthfeel and abv than normal but these are all a plus and very well done."
"There is a very mild coffee nose to this offering. Some light chocolate comes through in the flavor along with classic roasted bitterness. The bitterness comes on stronger on the finish which is the best part of this offering."
""
"big beer for a porter, felt more like a stout to me on all counts. smells like very strong coffee, english dark malts, and burnt sugar. flavor is huge espresso notes up front, mellowed out by a nice chocolatey smoothness and some noticable hops in the finish. mouthfeel is heavy, very full bodied, i was in this particular instance hoping for a more sessionable porter, but not the case here (although i did manage most of my sixpack nonetheless). super thick, almost sludgy at times, again much more like a stout, but im okay with that. overall i am not disappointed with this beer, it definitely pushes the envelope"

"o - enjoyable and a solid example of the style. really a well executed and easy drinking beer. will certainly be buying more of this."

"3.5 D: Decent porter. Nothing really stands out, but it's an easy drinker."

"O - Great porter, will definitely drink again."
"O: Overall, a very nice and easy drinking porter. Nothing too crazy, but it doesn't really have any off-notes. Good beer to have around when it's winter."
""
"O: This is solid 4.5/5 for me. As stated, I'm struggling to figure out why this isn't rated higher on here. I'd consider it to be up there with some of the best porters and stouts I've had. This is a fantastic beer and I'd definitely pick it up again."

"I tried the Black Jack Porter at The Bank in Wheaton, IL. The beer came in a standard pint glass and was opaque in color with 1/2 finger thick tan head...that didnt lace all that well. The smell was a nice roast earth/peat with hints of sweetness and coffee. The taste followed the scent and made for a very nice porter. The mouthfeel was medium body with good carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good porter and would recommend to anyone."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a thin black look, dark amber when held to the light, with a 1/2 finger tan head. The aroma was full of burnt malts, coffee, and chocolate. The taste is upfront and full of burnt malts. There is a thin finish of coffee and some slight toffee and caramel sweetness. This is such a thin beer with minimal carbonation which is fine for the style. A little more substance would be nice. All in all nothing more than an average porter."

"I'm overall not too impressed with this beer, but it's not too bad a porter. I would probably pass on trying this a second time."
"A very candy porter, but at this time I wanted a dessert so it was very good!"
""
"O: Good beer and I would certainly enjoy 3 or 3 of them. Iâ€™m also not giving it a fair chance to stand out on itâ€™s own as that Iâ€™ve had a Gumball Head and a Surly Coffee Bender prior."

"Overall / Drinkability: A decent English Porter. Quite drinkable, went well with food (Welsh Rabbit) and I could see myself having another. Simplistic flavor profile, but that's not a bad thing really."

"Taste is lightly roasted around a light sweet caramellic center. The beer has notes of chocolate, tabacco and an earthy taste. Bitterness is quite low, but seems to be into balance with the mouthfeel. The body of the beer is quite thin. Sometimes this fades when the glass is empty, but the last sip is also thin. I am not too sure about this beer. It all lacked a bit."
"Overall, this is a good porter.. definitely worth a shot, but it's just short of being something really special."
"Excellent brew! I let it warm a bit from the cooler and with slightly aggressive pour I got a medium sized, foamy tan head that soon settled down to a light cover. Color is a clear, deep smokey garnet with cherry highlights and a couple of nice bubble trails. Aroma is malt, cocoa, roast, toffee, caramel, hint of fruit. Flavor is like nose, plus a bit of salt, some good carbonic tang and a nice, mild, pleasing balance of bitter and sweet. Good body and carbonation. Finish is like flavor and of average length. This is a very good, traditional English style Porter, I'd like more."
"Dark black color, thin head. Smells like chocolate, dark chocolate. Flavor is more dark chocolate, cocoa, bakers chocolate, tootsie roll. The flavor reminded me of the old barrel-aged imperial stout a bit. Overall, very easy to drink but not sure I'd want more than one of these since the chocolate flavor was so overwhelming."
"SOLID, WORTH TRYING!"
"In the end the damp squid wins out."
"Poured into a standard pint glass. Pours a fluffy, creamy pillow of a head, but dissipates to a wisp with a cream ring of bubbles around the edge. The beer is rich coffee color, held up to the light the coffee brown shows through. Pretty decent sticky lacing. Slightly alcoholic smell to this, with a hint of bitter chocolate. This beer tastes of bitter chocolate and deep roasted malts. It doesn't have that burnt charcoal profile, and that's a good thing in my eyes. Mouthfeel is a bit watered down. This is a nice porter, pretty drinkable, but I gotta admit it's a bit strong for my liking. At 6.4%, the alcohol really comes through, but overall this isn't a bad effort from Left Hand, but there are better porters out there."
"Notes: Definitely an English porter with a good amount of dark fruit and toffee/caramel. Some roasted malt and coffee/cocoa as well. Not a bad porter but not my favorite."
"Overall I thought this was a good English Porter. I don't have a lot of experience with this style but I am starting to like the lightness and complexity of this style as apposed to some of the more robust American Porters that border on being a stout. This beer was pretty damn drinkable, it went down pretty fast and if I had another one I would drink it, I could see drinking 3 or 4 of these on a cool fall night. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, it wasn't overly robust and it turned out to be pretty complex. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, the carbonation needed to be bumped up a couple notches and it wouldn't hurt to make it a little thicker for a medium body. I could see myself buying this again when looking for a nice and easy drinking English Porter. I would recommend giving this beer a try it has just the right amount of balance and complexity to do this style justice. I still think Arcadia's London Porter is my favorite English Porter, but this beer comes pretty close to it although still being pretty different, but I have yet to have a traditional English Porter from England so I really can''t tell which one is more tradition, but I am willing to bet that Black Jack is closer to a traditional English Porter. I am glad that Left Hand is now available in Michigan, so far I have only tried their darker beers so I am interested to see what they can do with some of the lighter styles, guess I am going to have to track some down next time I am at the store."
"Drink- This was pretty good. A little bit of roast and some chocolate and some coffee. Was nice to see a medium body. Right in line with what I was hoping for. I'd have this one again."
"Overall: A pretty good porter. Wish it were a bit toastier/roastier."
"O- Good porter overall. Although not my favorite porter, certainly something I would revisit. Another solid offering from Left Hand."
"O- A middle of the road porter for me. I'm glad they included it in their mixed pack, but I wouldn't seek it out on it's own merits."
"O - An ok brew. Flavor doesn't seem full but what is there is good."
"Overall this is a very nicely balanced English style porter, perhaps just a tad sweeter than I like but that is no real detraction.While I feel it could use a touch more complexity I would gladly drink this porter when offered and if I can find it as fresh as I got this six pack I will gladly buy it again as well."
"overall a good beer i might look around some more before picking this one up again but i like alot of variety to begin with."
"OVERALL: This is a nice interpretation of the style by Left Hand. As with most of their other year-round beers this is a very accessible, affordable and tasty choice."
"Overall - I really enjoyed this. Its moreso a dessert porter, sweet and fruity, yet has the roasted malt backbone. Different then a standard porter. Easy to drink and enjoy."
"O: This wasn't too bad. I don't know if I'd seek it out again, but it was respectable."
"M- Very creamy and full. Thick bodied, goes down incredibly smooth."
"Full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and very mild carbonation. Nearly perfect porter."
"Good to the last drop, which is really nice. Unlike a more bitter beer, no less fun finishing this one when it gets warmer. I've had this one twice now, and it's impressed me both times."
"A solid porter distinguished by its very nice creaminess and licorice notes. Pours a very dark brown edging toward black with a nice creamy head and some spotty lacing. Nice licorice and cream notes in the nose, fairly soft. The taste has more of an edge, but more of that licorice along with a roasty note and some bitter, citrus peel tasting hops. Full but creamy in the mouth. Very solid, and with a delicious creamy finish. Imo, better than most have rated it."
"Overall: A proper porter."
"O- Very easy to drink, but not as flavorful as I would have liked. Is very average for its style, but that being said it was a good attempt, and worth at least a try."
"not much going on here"
"The first impression that one has to face is that the brew is slightly spicy but soon takes over the chocolate definitely possible. It also collects the mocha. In the mouth, mild coffee as if it were sweetened milk but without being sweet and bitterness while retaining its characteristic, especially in the aftertaste. Note that one can detect a hint of black cherries. An exception to be still because with ease to drink quite impressive."
"Poured this English Porter into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. This porter poured a dark brown color and produced a foamy tan head. Below average amount of lacing. The aroma was full of roasted malt and smoke. The taste of this porter was full of roasted malt, chocolate and liquorice. There is a touch of hop bitterness and it is a little sweeter then a typical porter. This is a full body beer, not a session beer. Dry finish. Very good porter!"
"Overall - not terribly interesting taste, but a good taste. Easy to drink and worth drinking more of."
"Overall, this is a nice brew but i dont know that i will purchase again"
"Overall: Easy to drink and has a nice chocolate flavor, though it is lacking in complexity"
"Drinkability: It's a very good Porter with a lot of flavor, but never too heavy. Flavors come out a little more as it warms, so don't serve it too cold. Will definitely drink this one again when I want a good porter."
"O: Another solid Left Hand product. Shouldn't disappoint any fan of porters or sweet stouts."
"Overall: A solid good beer."
"D/O- Nothing sticks out on this one, which isn't necessarily a bad thing...just an easy drinking porter. With all the great examples of the style, both American and English, I recommend reaching for something else."
"Another local Colorado brew I haven't given a chance to. Just bought one in a mixed six and I am impressed that it's one of the better domestic Porters."
"Overall it's a shame I can only get this in Ohio because this makes me excited to try there mild stout (love stouts) Not a bad porter and I love how smoky it is!"
"Not really anything special about this porter, delivers a nice aroma still easy to down, I wish something else stood out here to keep it unique from every other porter out there."
"Overall: Thicken this beer up and this beer will really be tasting good. Average porter, nothing fantasic, but it's just average."
"There is a little more carbonation than I like in a porter but its still easy to down. Not one of my favorite English porters but still decent."
"D - This is a nice, well rounded porter. It has a nice level of malt complexity with notes of licorice and smoke, though its sweetness and restrained roasted character prevent it from being mistaken for a stout."
"Enjoyable."
"A decent porter, but in a style with so many good examples, this one is slightly too sweet. Still, I always find LH's offerings to be decent, and this is no exception."
"The glass is filled with a very dark brown brew caped with almost no foam. The aroma sweet malt that's somewhat robust. The taste is sweet with hints of cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg, caramel; there is a slight earthiness that I found appealing. I found the body to be a hair on the thin side. It is very smooth with a good aftertaste. I hope to eventually find more of this."
"O: I like it. Will add this to the porter rotation."
"O: Decent. I wish it had slightly more hops for balance, but still enjoyable."
"O - A really great porter this beer is complex and rich. A very well rounded flavor with a great balance."
"Overall, a bit of a letdown in flavor and character. Much better English porters are to be had either from England or the U.S. in my opinion."
"This beer pours a dark, ruby brown with fleeting head. The aroma has hints of chocolate, toast, and nuts and possibly a bit of vanilla. It's flavor begins as chocolate that turns to dark chocolate, followed by coffee as it warms. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy and filling. Too filling for more than one. Left Hand Black Jack Porter is a decent beer, recommended."
"O: Overall the beer was just ok. I had some high expectations for Left Hand, and I was a little let down. The flavor and smell were both very underwhelming but hints of roasted malts, semi sweet chocolate and coffee come through. I wouldnt necessarily recommend this beer to other, because I think there are definitely better porters out there."
"O - If there was such a thing as a sessionable porter, this would be it."
"Extremely well balanced brew; I find it to be quite drinkable."
"Medium body, relatively light effervescence, slightly warming the throat. A really nice brew, balanced throughout. Glad I got a six-pack instead of just one."
"Muddy brown with reddish edges and off white head that leaves lacing. Inviting scent of brown sugar, burning wood, hops, and slight chocolate. Tastes of chocolate syrup, slight cinnamon, brown sugar, some hops in the background. Medium bodied with light carbonation. A sweet porter with some nice flavorn notes but some of them could be annoying on the palate. Worth a try but not one of the best porters around due to it's sugar characteristics."
"Pours a French roast dark color but appears to not only be syrupy but unsettlingly thick. Roasted stuff hits the nostrils and basically attacks my whole body nutil I take a sip. It tates rather blandly of a two-dimensional dark lager with some artificial fruit flavorings to the side. Not much else. The roasted flavor is prevalent but it can't really save this one."
"They're givin' this out cheap now, so I decided to give it a go before my world is rocked by '80s music. It pours a dark ruby-tinged black-brown topped by a half-finger of light ecru foam. The nose comprises light roasted malts, light coffee, dark chocolate, and a decidedly light twinge of pine. The taste holds notes of mild roasted malts, milder coffee, cocoa, and some light spruce bits. The body is a straight medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry-ish finish. Overall, a pretty standard, nice, unoffensive porter. Straightforward all the way."
"Mouthfeel is on the thin side for a Porter with just enough fizz to keep it from seeming weak More a ""session"" sort of Porter than a slow sipper and with it's reasonable price,broad availability,that works out well for drinkability"
"Very drinkable beer. A little strong for a session beer, but very sessionable. Could drink these all night and not tire of the flavors."
"Picked up as part of a mixed six. Pours a rich black color, with an inch of medium tan foam. Aromas of roasted malt, sweet milk chocolate and coffee. On the palate, this one was medium bodied, with flavors of milk chocolate, a little black licorice and roasted malt."
"Drinkability - This is an ok Porter. Not the best, but nothing to scoff at either. This would be a fair entry level Porter for someone interested in the style in my opinion. It is easily drinkable and I wouldn't have a problem quaffing it for a night."
"D could drink throughout evening, but I would think they do not consider this a signature beer. It leaves more to be desired. I was expecting a little more being that I LOVE their milk stout, more so than bells double cream, and compare their milk stout to duck rabbit milk stout... I cannot get this is NC, sop when I got this during a Florida trip, I was really looking forward to it being great. I can see where this could be someones session beer who can get it easily."
"400th review, unfortunately"
"D - A delicate carbonation and the bitter that balances sweetness make this beer very drinkable."
"D - I like the feel of a solid porter but this seems to have a strange bitter finish that persists after drinking. I wouldn't drink more than two in a row. Still enjoyable and interesting."
"Darker than a black steers tuchis on a moonless prarie night. No head but to be expected with a porter. Dont see any carbonation...but its pretty dark in there. Smell sweet, coffee, chocolate, toffee. Tastes pretty good. Thick and rich, taste some chocolate. Mealy comes to mind. Overall pretty tastey porter."
"D - Not smoked/burnt roasted enough to be an American pseudo-stout, but lacks any sweetness to balance the bitter chocolate taste like a good porter. Imagine drinking quite bitter dark chocolate without the melt-in-your-mouth creaminess."
"Pours dark brown with a nice brown head. (Bottled on 2/03/10) Aroma of dark roasted malts and coffee, caramel.Taste is same as aroma. Palate is full bodied, nice and creamy texture, with good carbonation. Finish is malty, coffee, creamy, with some bitter hops for balance. Overall a very nice porter."
"D - Not something I'd drink all night while playing cards, but this porter is good nonetheless."
"12oz bottle. Bottle on Date of 02 and the rest is extremely smudged, a common occurrence I have noticed with Left Hand. Pours an extremely dark brown with a very small amount of head. Some lacing. Aromas of roasted malts and dark chocolate. The taste is mostly dark chocolate with some more of the roasted malts. Sweet. Pretty solid porter. I'd look for this one again."
"D: A very solid porter, especially if you like sweet porters with a little bite. Nothing fancy, just really nice beer. I would try this one again, and fresher for sure."
"Another good brew by Left hand brewing company. Nice dark color with a decent tan head. Smells fresh. Taste okay, it is smooth but could be a bit smoother. A bit tarty. Mouthful I would say the same think. One could drink this beer often, but I wouldn't go more than 4 or it will lose its luster."
"(25th)"
"T- Too tart, in fact. Kind of soapish and dull. There's some nuttyness to it. But limited on all accounts. Not bad, just bland."
"Carbonation hits full on in the front then a slight bitterness tasting of anise gathers in the back, finnishes with molasses. There are some faint chocolate notes - more bitter than sweet though. This was an older bottle - bottled in 08 - and finnished a little watery at times. A good porter."
"Conclusion: Anyone trying this beer must remember that it isn't and American Porter, for as such it would fall short. However as an English Porter I feel it is on a good track, and succeeds. There is sufficient complexity and good overall balance. It just lacks that 'something' that makes some English porters so irresistible."
"Love coffee/chocolate taste in my beers, get plenty of it here without the crazy heaviness or motor oil mouthfeel of an imperial stout. Passed on this many times, sorry I did now! Wiill definetly seek this out"
"Atmosphere is pretty solid. Appearance is nothing special, but a deep, rich tone, and a decent foamy head. Nose has an interesting combination of malt and a subtle sweetness. Flavor, the same. Malty, and thick, with just the slightest sweetness, and a bitter peaty finish. Overall, this is a really nice quaff."
"This is the 3rd time I've had this beer and I like it better every time. It's a little on the sweet side but not sticky or heavy."
"Its not bad beer at all, but there are many other porters out there I would prefer over this one. But at the price, its not a bad deal."
"Certainly a rich beer. I think it'd be hard to put down more than a couple of these, but it's certainly OK. I'm not sure I'll seek it out much, simply because the thick sweetness is a lot to deal with."
"D: Well made, but just not my kind of flavour profile. Too hoppy for the style, not satisfying."
"D: Drinkable and enjoyable but I wouldn't hunt it down. If you see it somewhere give it a try."
"Enjoyable well balanced Porter. 2 for 2 on my lefthand tasting tonight. I would buy this as a Porter."
"Purchased a single to give Black Jack a try. Served in a British style pub glass. Dark brown color. Lots of Guinness-like surging carbonation when I finished pouring. A large milky head forms, with some good lacing. Smell had a nice chocolate aroma to it. Taste was great. There were notes of coffee and milk chocolate, but there was a sweetness at the finish that I was not expecting. There was a sugary taste that I noticed on my palate that I really only find in milk/sweet stouts. Interesting. Mouthfeel was adequate, but on the thin side for a porter. Drinkability was very good, considering it's smoothness and sweetness, and also now that I see that the abv % was over 6, which was not noticeable. This would be a good session porter, or a good porter for a warm day or evening due to it's light body."
"drinkability: solid. but would not seek out again"
"Drinkability: decent drinkability. Hides nearly all the alcohol content, but the quality of the taste seemed to diminish somewhat on the second one."
"Yeah overall it's a decent mild porter, pleasantly sweet but dark, nice balance. Doesn't have a lot to offer but what's there is pleasant. Smooth and drinkable dark ale."
"If you are in the UK then I would seriously think of tracking it down as you won't be disappointed."
"D: Solid porter. Flavorful and balanced. ther than some aspects of appearance, very good."
"D - if it were not for the bitter after taste this could be a drinker."
"D - This is a pretty nice porter. I like the fact that is English-styled."
"Taste focuses more on the honeyed malts with a little bit of roast and coffee flavor. Fairly sweet and does not show much in the way of hop bitterness. Just a bit of toasty malt on the finish. There is still a bit of mild light fruit, maybe some honeydew melon and strawberries. Decently creamy mouthfeel and is adequately carbonated. Pretty easy drinking porter that is neither really good nor bad. Falls in the 'above average' category and I could see myself drinking this every once in a while."
"D: There are better porters out there, but this isn't that bad. A nice flavor and smell too it and the alcohol is barely noticeable."
"-Bye"
"Strong, rich aroma is of quality roast coffee with a firm overtone of sweet chocolate - tres tempting. It pours a semi-opaque Coca-Cola brown with a fairly thick beige head. Flavor is like a fine mocha, roast coffee and chocolate, slightly sweet, with a surprising and pleasant bitter hoppy undertone. Texture is tingly and smooth, very pleasant going down the hatch."
"Drinkability: Nothing bad about this, but nothing stands out either. The smell is the best part of this beer."
"Poured this dark brown beer into a pint glass. The foam that frothed forth was a generous inch beer and reduced real slowly. The aroma of the beer is that of a roasted, cooking chocolate. The taste follows suit with a hint of malt towards the end for the aftertaste. Overall, not that bad of a porter to have on a chilly night."
"All in all a very good drink, imo. Easy and pleasant."
"Mouthfeel, well, mahogany accompanies the licorice and alcohol. Not too drinkable."
"Poured this into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. This beer looked like it was going to be great during the pour, but got closer to pretty average the more time went on. At first it had a huge creamy head on it that looked like it was going to have decent lacing to it but it went away fairly quickly and just left a little bit of lace at the top of the class. Its a hearty mahogany color that has lighter brown highlights to it. Only after it's been out of the fridge for Id say atleast 45 minutes does the smell start to get better than average and even work it's way to good. Initially you can't pick up a whole lot, just sort of a dry pine hop. But as it warms up you can also pick up that it smells well malted with aromas of cocoa and even a feint hint of coffee. Once it warms up it actually smells pretty well blended. The taste is a slight step down. Has the initial taste of the roasted malts chocolate and coffee but it doesn't blend well with the hops at all. On top of that the coffee taste to it is similar to coffee that's been on the burner a little too long. Mouthfeel is ok, I would have to say pretty average for this style and that's probably being a bit generous, complex and finishes with I would say an awkward bitterness. Due to all of the flavors not meshing well together, it's not very drinkable overall. I was a little dissapointed. Only the 2nd beer I've had from this brewery and the first I've reviewed. I've had the milk stout several times and really enjoyed it, I'm hoping maybe I just a bad bottle, but no indications on it seems that it was out of code. I may try it again in the future if I have the opportunity."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation, some alcohol comes through. Not a good porter. Thanks Russ!"
"drinkability is good. good balance. a nice english porter."
"An ok porter, quite fruity and floral for the style. There is some coffee there, but it doesn't really stand out, making this more similar to an English bitter. Nothing really pops in this beer, but definitely drinkable."
"One of my first real Porters i must say. This one fell into my taste a couple of weeks ago and iv been drinking it since. A nice porter all the way through! The A is very good (boarderline 5!) with a nice foam that settles calmly onto the dark surface. The easy smell that this very porter has i nice but in not the best iv smelled.. Perhaps my nose isnt train for this very smell since im new to the porter scene..? The taste is nice and has a bit of sweetness in the end. The afterburner chamber in this badboy is very nice, its the strongest iv felt so far among the world of American porters! Can be warmly recommended."
"Got this bottle from the Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam. Actually this one is a good beer! I drank it in a dutch beer glass. Gives a nice foamy broken white head. Beer is pretty darkbrown. All in all i very nice beer to drink, even if one is a fan of the Belgian beers."
"Appears a dark mahogany with ruby highlights it's hard to call this porter black especially when held toward the light. It forms a creamy light khaki colored head that dwindles typically with non descript even fine lacing. Aromatics offer up a touch of black licorice aka anise, with a roasted malt character bringing out some dark chocolate and mild coffee accent notes. Herbal hops in the back ground, a bit of caramel complements the party as well. Flavor brings out the dominant caramel presence with a touch of roasted malt characteristics including the mild coffee and dark chocolate, again a mild herbal hop bitterness in the finish for some balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied evenly carbonated, there is a harsh bitterness that is left on the palate giving me an aftertaste that I don't truly care for between sips. Drinkability overall is decent not my favorite dark that's would have to be their milk stout, but this will do for now average dark brown/porter style ale."
"Well I am the queen of hearts (love that song Juice Newton!) with my lip stuck out, because I am considerably disappointed with my buddy Jack. There is virtually NOTHING on the nose. And believe my I search, I wait, and I search again. A little hint of pepper and spice (and nothing else nice unfortunately) and that's it. Only AFTER drinking the final beer, the Black Flag Imperial Stout with its surge of hoppiness, and returning, did it seem like a porter, with touches of maple syrup. Before that, it was just a bland brown ale. If I had to summarize in one word, ""nondescript"" would be my linguistic choice."
"d - very nice beer. a session porter if there ever was one."
"Pours a deep brown color with a small creamy tan head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is of milk chocolate, light roasted nuts, and some vinous notes. The taste is of a light roasted malt, milk chocolate, wet wood, and a touch copper. The feel is light, almost watery, has fairly soft carbonation, finishes on the sweet side. A rather mild porter, some decent chocolate flavors but nothing bold. I like my porters to be lighter than stouts but this one bordered on being watery. Nothing off about this brew but no wow factor. A sessionable porter."
"My bottle looks exactly the same the only difference being my ABV on this bottle is 5.8%,This beer pours a black cola colour with nice carbonation that leaves a fast vanishing one head and a ring of lacing,it has aromas of dark coffee,dark plums and some feint hops,it has an above average mouthfeel with a strong dark coffee,chocolate taste about it that finishes with a subtle kick of hops and no taste whatsoever of its 5.8% ABV so for me its a very drinkable porter."
"12 oz. Deep brown pour, some off white head. Roasted malt, caramel, earthy peat, miniscule hop aroma. Descent medium body, not quite creamy. Flavor is a little sweet, but not overly so. Malt, toffee, chocolate and peat/grass/slight tobacco earthyness. Warming does not help this one much, a just a bit too mild. Kind of a sweet carmelly finish, some smokiness. Drinkability is good. If you are expecting an American porter you might be dissappointed, but a solid American version of an English porter. Solid brew from Left Hand, but pretty forgettable."
"Pours a dark brown with a nice tan head. The smell is of roasted malt with a little bit of chocolate. Some fruits and breadiness as well. The taste is similar--nice and simple to drink without too much complexity. The body is full and is fairly drinkable for a porter--not too dry."
"This was a decent beer, not my favorite of thiers, but good none the less. Appearance is deep brown with almost no head or lacing. Smell and taste are nearly identical with lots of deep roast and dark chocolate malts. There is a hint of earthiness with honey mixed in as well. Mouthfeel is acceptable, but on the border of being too light. Drinkability is decent as well."
"Drinkability: The flavours just aren't powerful enough, which give it an almost bland creamy taste, which is a shame. There are better, much more flavoursome porter out there, which manage to achieve this with a lot lower ABV."
"D- Very good, a good choice if you want a darker beer with a light body."
"Overall- Slightly bland, mediocre. Middle of the road at best."
"Light bodied and watered down up front with some oatmeal, smooth chocolate maltiness, toffee and slightly bitter subtle hop presence in the finish."
"The mouth feel really is on the bubbly side, but not prickly or crisp."
"Pours with minimal head, lacing stronger than any foam on top. Not quite black, just very dark brown in color, turning to a faint orange around the rims. Not a lot of roast to the nose, more caramel, butterscotch, vanilla fudge and then black raisin, plum, cherry fruit, has a spring water freshness to it, not a lot of density, drifts off rather quickly. Medium-bodied, while it doesn't have a lot of weight it still manages to feel sluggish and unwilling to move. Coffee notes perk it up some but then it's basically the same story as in the nose, chocolate, caramel, butterscotch and plum, raisin, other dark fruits. The carbonation much more fluffy and active than you'd guess from the absence of any head. Light breadiness with some bitters, here it tastes like fizzy mineral water rather than still stream water. Fairly lacking in complexity and finishes short. Another beer more marked by absence of positive traits than presence of negative traits."
"Overall... Probably better for porter newbs, who are put off by dark colors. The sweetness is probably easy to like. I honestly prefer the robust porter for their superior aroma and taste which contributes to drinkability. This is NOT a robust beer."
"Nice dark pour, not a lot of head. Very little aroma, just the bare hint of coffee. Not much flavor either, mostly cola with a little bit of coffee; bland. Not a lot of body. With nothing in the way, it goes down fairly easy. As a southpaw myself, I had high hopes for Left Hand Brewing, but Black Jack porter did not come through as anything other than average."
"Pours a dark brown with a little deep red hue along the edges. It also initially poured with a nice 1 finger white head that dissolved way too fast and left little lacing. The smell is quite pleasant with traces of cocoa. Mouthfeel is a little lighter than what I would want but it makes it easier to drink and want another. Taste has a little bit of hop bitterness up front and on the finish. All around you can taste a little bit of chocolate."
"D- I like how the ABV is not dangerously high but this one did not quite do it for me so one pint was enough. I have yet to be wowed by Left Hand offerings and I hope to find one more to my liking in the future."
"D- A porter it is, nothing special it be. I do like the name."
"Pours a deep/dark brown. Almost black. Creates a tan head that disappears rapidly. Smells of roasted malt, and maybe some dark chocolate. Tastes almost sweet with the fairly decent sized roasty/toasty malt profile. Theres a good amount of hop bitterness present, as well as some earthy hop flavor in the finish. Nice and warming. A fairly decent porter."
"I enjoyed it, not sure I'd want another straight after though, more of a nightcap for me than a session beer."
"The chocolate and sweetness makes it quite drinkable and accessible. This is the first beer that me and my girlfriend both enjoyed, although I wish the malt was a bit more roasted and bitter."
"Rich and fairly full mouthfeel. Tasty beer, very drinkable."
"A solid porter."
"D - Pretty smooth...as much as I liked the other areas of the beer it took more of an effort to get through it than expected...maybe too much of an alcohol presence with this beer"
"D- Overall I'm liking this beer. It's not the most balanced porter in the world and I could do with some more hop flavor (or maybe just some more flavor that isn't coffee) but I'd order it in a pinch."
"Not a bad (English) porter but nothing amazing."
"I was sort of let down overall with this beer.. It has many characteristics similar to german bocks, as opposed to a porter.. The aroma is a bit smokey and malty with some caramel but its quite subdued.. Pour is very cola-like, dark with a slight head and reddish when light passes thru.. Taste is dry and malty, a bit chocolate-malty, but a bit watery almost.. Mouth is lighter than expected but its not bad and is one of the strong points.. Its drinkable in that its not too heavy or such, but it has flaws"
"If this beer were a Blackjack hand, it would be a 10 and an 8. It's good enough to win some hands, but not enough to win against others."
"Many bars make the mistake of pouring porters too cold. This one, if ordered on draught, must be allowed to sit if you wish to truly experience it - the way it was meant to be. A complex beer that is surely deserves our respect."
"Drinkability: This is not a bad beer by any stretch. It is a victim of timing. I have had a lot of excellent porters lately and this is not up to the same degree. If this was in a variety pack, I would have fun consuming--however I am more likely to get one of those other porters as a single first."
"The finish is the same way. There is no bitter finish, and there is no hint of sweet, everything counterbalances so you're left with nothing."
"Pours a ruby red with a good sized creamy head. Coffee and toasted grain in the nose with a bit of a solvent edge. Flavour is quite toasty, very fruity, with some chalkiness and coffee. Moderate bitterness with a soft body and moderate carbonation. Little bit sweet, and tart. Fairly refreshing and drinkable."
"great drinkability."
"D: An average porter. I am a big porter fan but this did not strike my fancy that much."
"overall a nice high quality porter. just dont plan on drinking all of them in 1 sitting."
"Overall very drinkable and great mouthfeel, not too carbonated but noticable. Very good for the price will buy again."
"overall, I like this beer. I'm a brown ale fan, and for me this feels more like a brown ale plus. I'm happy with the malty profile of this beer. Could use more hop flavor."
"D: A nice drinkable porter. Nothing too stupendous, but definitely above average. Good sessionability."
"Drinkability is good. This is a solid porter that is well worth trying."
"Pours with a 1/8 inch head that quickly disappears. Lace is minimal. This brew is fairly similar to Left Hands Milk Stout, with a few exceptions. First off there is a hint of caramel in the nose and taste, along with the coffee and dark chocolate that's dominant in the Milk Stout. There's also a tiny bit more carbonation and a touch more of hops that leaves a slight hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Like the Milk Stout, there is some sweetness. A good brew overall, but two is enough."
"Date consumed: 12 September 2008"
"The beer pours a deep brown to black with a huge, frothy head (decent retention), and a fine lace blankets the glass, both are light chocolate in color. Aroma is of sweet malt and hints of (possibly) syrup. Start is sweet, the middle is moderate , the finish has some carbonation. Decently hopped, and a fair to midline dry aftertaste. An ok beer - one that is alright for a session, however better porters are out there."
"Firm this one up and the flavor is there. Middling for now."
"D_Heavy body is very filling. Repeatability is low"
"Overall - Pretty good. Not much else to say about this beer."
"A pretty good porter indeed."
"This porter pours a typical porter color with a one finger khaki head. Some lacing remains throughout the glass. Smell is chocolaty and sweet, think tootsie rolls. Tastes sweet initially but finish has some nice bitterness. This beer seems a little thicker than some other porters, but it works very well."
"This is not an English Porter IMO. I need tons of roasted malt. I do not get that with this beer. Don't get me wrong, it is a good beer that I enjoy. Just not what I think of for the style."
"D - I would have to add this to my list of favorite porters. Nothing objectionable about this at all. For an American version of a British ale, this one is spot-on!"
"Now this is a damn good porter. More tasty than most. Aroma was a little weak. HInts of chocolate were there but slight. Pour was a deep dark brown with a thin tan ring for a head.The flavor was big for a porter. Strong chocolate malt in the beginning which is very sweet. Then a bitter roastiness comes in and balances it out with a dry finish. Thick and chewy but with a lot of carbonation. Nice."
"Overall a good sessionable porter. Pairs very well with white cheddar cheez-its!"
"Future outlook: Probably won't seek this out, but it seems to be a nice addition to the Mountain Mixer in which it came."
"Overall - I like it. It's a very smooth porter. I could be quite happy drinking four of five of these in an evening."
"OVERALL: Definitely drinkable. Needs a stronger aftertaste to bring it up a notch, but it's certainly a good brew that I'd go for again."
"Mouthfeel could be a little heavier, certainly not thin but then again this is an English Porter. Drinkability is pretty high, solid brew nothing that really stands out but solid anyways."
" ~ This is a solid beer. I'll certainly recommend to my pals that they offer it a shot. Also, even though I write with my right I swing lefty!"
"The aroma is a rich blend of semi-sweet chocolate, light java, and cream. The flavor follows up with a hint of spicy hops at the end in addition to the chocolate grains. MY only complaint is that it could be more complex. The mouthfeel is pretty balanced, and while this is a bigger beer, it's still fairly drinkable. Worth a try for a big, chocolatey porter."
"M + D: A crisp carbonation... maybe a little sharp, but not too much. A nice roundness to the body that kinda saves it. It's a good enough beer... not the best I've experienced, but not too shabby."
" Overall drink ability was good , one or two bottles at a time , have bought this beer many times and would recommend to others"
"The beer pours a clear, very dark brown with a nice garnet hue. The head is thin and tan. The aroma is chocolately and sweet with a bit of roasted malt. The flavor is quite chocolately, bittersweet and mouthfeel is quite smooth. Carbonation is medium-low and body medium. Overall an easy drinking, flavorful porter."
"Not bad for a porter. I like the simple flavors that make up the layers of this beer. Dark but not too dark, sweet but not overly saccharine, bitter but not too sour. I think this is a good workhorse of a beer. It isn't a very big or innovative porter but it has my thumbs up."
"Pitch black colored porter with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is a strong mocha coffee.Taste is chocolate,coffee and burnt malts.This is very smooth and goes down like water.Highly recommended!!Another great job by the people at Left Hand Brewing Company."
"Light-medium in body with unobtrusive carbonation. It's like Left Hand took a decent porter, cut it with mineral water, and bottled it. The end product is entirely drinkable, but pretty forgettable."
"Complex, solid flavors, and smooth textures make this brew quite enjoyable. I only had one but it made an impression. Recommended to the porter lovers out there."
"Overall - A pretty decent and slighty unusual porter... well worth a try..."
"Maybe a bit thin. Overall, pretty easy to drink, with some nice flavors."
"It's dark, but some light does make it through, especially around the edges. Tan head that falls away quickly. The smell actually seems to be roasted barley. The taste as well contains an aspect of burnt smokiness that I don't expect from a porter. Mild hop bitterness is in line with the English porter style. A little dense. Creamy. Pretty good stuff."
"A fairly decent porter. Nothing harsh or overly bitter or burnt here."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, dark in color with a hint of red. Absolute minimal head retention and no lacing. Aroma was not prominently displayed but it was evident that this porter would have some sweetness to it. Very thin mouthfeel for a porter, but creamy and very smooth. The best thing going for this one is the flavor. I didn't expect much based on the aroma and appearance, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was correct to expect a sweet taste to this one, chocolate malts easily make themselves known, and are well blended with other roasted and coffee malt flavors. A slight hoppiness is present which I think really brings this porter full circle. Well made overall, although I wish it had a thicker body to it. I would surely try this one again, preferably on tap."
"Served a nice dark brown with ruby highlights and a thin diminishing head. Aroma is a decent blend of carmel and chocolate. The taste is a slightly bitter chocolate with some undertoned hops. The beer is on the light side of medium with low carbonation. This is a decent porter for a cool rainy afternoon."
"Drinkability is excellent. I'm glad I tried this and will make it a regular purchase for me. Definitely enjoyable all year long, but I'm really looking forward to enjoying this in the winter, maybe while cooking some s'mores in front of the fire."
"I suppose it would make for a good summer drinker."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a deep ruby-brown, almost black with a thin, milky head. The smell is not overwhelming, but is of strongly roasted notes and chocolate malt. The taste has a similar profile, with a touch of peat smokiness at the end. A decently balanced beer, but definitely malt forward. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a minimal carbonation. Overall, not a bad beer but not one that stands out in my mind either."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, decent kick, good representation of style, this isn't a bad beer but there are definitely several other porters that I would pick first."
"D - Overall I think this is a good beer its not going to blow you a way but its a good easy to drink porter with a good taste to it thats worth trying"
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a . The aroma is dark roasted malts, a good dose of coffee and a hint of dark chocolate. The taste starts out with smooth dark roasted malts and finishes with some bitter dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but a little thin for the style. Overall, Black Jack Porter is a pretty decent porter, but really doesn't stand out enough for me to purchase again."
"I had tried a Left Hand beer a few years ago. I thought it was horrible, tho my taste buds were too immature for these beers. This is a good beer regaining positive reputation in my book for Left Hand. I'm happy I brought home the Mountain Mix pack and I'd buy this porter again."
"sufficient carbonation. full body. i like this beer. i am a big fan of porters and this one i would buy again."
"pours up black with little to no head. not much retentive lacing. nose is chocolate malts, coffee, lil caramel. taste is same as nose with some hop crispness in the mix. pretty light bodied, easy drinkin, low to medium carbo. im not much for porters but this one is definately drinkable."
"D- I would recommend this. As a fan of porters though I like some others better such as Sierra Nevada. Left Hand beers tend to be around $11-12 a six around here which I think hurts this beer since its not even my favorite porter, yet cost more. I wouldn't turn one down, and I do like it enough to buy again. I like this better than the Left Hand Milk Stout."
"Drinkability: Ok but nothing spectacular. Maybe my taste buds are off or something but I can't find too much to be impressed about with this porter."
"to celebrate me birthday ... very roasty! ... a bit thin but highly drinkable ... nice aftertaste ... strange but likeable ... just can't put my digit on it.. my server when she saw me reviewing, ""that's cute", well honey..you were! ..left hand"
"As for now, I'll be looking forward to the next one."
"Rich, creamy, slightly thick mouthfeel with a very good level of drinkability to match up... A solid sample from Left Hand and a overall solid depiction of the style..."
"Drinkability: A solid porter that's certain to make for easy drinking."
"drinkability is good. this brew is mild and easy going, with solid flavors and an intriguing profile. very smooth and drinkable porter. cheers!"
"#3 on ""porter day"" was one from the left hand sampler ; pours a deep garnet color w/ a thin tan head which dissipates quickly leaving a moderate lacing in my nonic ; a moderate smell, sweet, biscuty malt w/ dark fruit and nuts, maybe a hint of hop, but not discernable ; a sweet darker-malt heavy flavor, a strong date/fig-like undertone throughout, blends well with the toasty nut flavor, also detect a bit of woody hops ; drinks a bit lighter than the flavor, though still pretty full feeling, it just seems like this brew should be way fatter ; a very good beer, extremely quaffable for a 6.4% ABV porter, i'm glad i have some more to enjoy..."
"This is my first beer from Left Hand and I have was very impressed. I would definitely order this again."
"Drinkability is nice and easy-going smooth!"
"D- Good session beer. Nothing too overwhelming but unique enough to stand out amongst other English style porters"
"D- Goes down easy and without complaint. A decent session beer, though by no means phenomenal as porters go."
"The whole beer just turns to creamy head when I sip it, giving that spot-on feel that those Guinness widgets try to do. There's so much going on in the flavor - it tastes very good and doesn't get old. World class!"
"Pours mahogany with cherry hues. Has a one-finger light tan head that fades fairly precipitously leaving little in the way of lacing. Sweet caramel drifts up to the nose followed by almonds, various other nuts, coffee and a hint of tea. Tastes a little bitter up front with some toffee and a light maltiness left behind. Goes down smooth with a medium-bodied mouth-feel. Very drinkable porter, and not as hefty as many of it's other brothers."
"D: I will be going back to this one again. Very nice."
"Pours a deep brown with dark ruby highlights. Not ad with the very light tan head. Aromas of cocoa, dark pecans, and walnuts. The firs sip is chocolatey mixed wih a dark roasted bread. The first sip is a dry, powdery chocolate. Then a srong toasted mt bill with notes of slightly burnt wheat toast. The fnish is a creamy coffee, vanilla, and Hershey's cocoa mix. The palate is smooth and simple. Dark, bright, yet easy drink."
"The flavours in this porter are quite nice, but there is nothing that sets this apart from the other porters; this is quite nice and almost an introduction to the porter style."
"Poured deep brown to black with a thin tan colored head. The nose is dominated by milk chocolate. There is a touch of roast malt, and just a little citrus in the end. The flavor has the milk chocolate, followed by roast malt (it's almost a burnt malt character). A bit of sweetness accompanies a mild citrus finish that gives it just a hint of bitterness, and offsets the chocolate well. The mouth feel is a little thin, a bit slick. Drinkability is OK."
"M: Nice smooth beer with medium to heavy body, for a porter."
"This would be a good accompaniment for BBQ or Burgers."
"A clean dark brown beer with mahogony highlights. Has a small creamy light brown head with a little bit of lace. The aroma is full of roasted malt notes, Chocolate, coffee, molasses and a hint of licorice. The roasted malt bitterness bites at the tip of your tongue with bittersweet chocolate notes. There is a hint of coffee just before a sweet nut like malt character washes it down your throat."
"Very smooth with a lighter feeling body,colud pass for a brown ale. Easy drinking beer could put a few of these away."
"D: This beer is a good, solid Porter, but nothing to go crazy over."
"Drinkability- Really smooth and a pleasure to drink. Roasty, nutty and creamy with a nice soft mouthfeel to it. Much more balanced than the smoked porter Left Hand also makes that I also enjoy."
"Overall, I find this to be solid across the board. I was mostly impressed by the ease of consumption, the depth to the flavors and the smooth feel on the palate. I really enjoy a good robust porter and this is a quality example to be sure. I will definitely have this one again."
"D - The roast is a little too upfront for this to be very drinkable. After two it gets overpowering. Still a nice beer."
"S - Fruity smell with hints of coffee. Extremely pleasing."
"Pours a very dark oak brown with translucent orange-ruby highlights if you hold it up to the light. A foamy tan head accompanies. The smell is soft. Some sweet caramel malts along with bitter cocoa, and roasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium-light and slightly sharp. The sharpness being the result of some bitter cocoa and light molasses sweetness. The finish is dry and roasted and that sharpness spreads to the sides and edges of my tongue. This beer is just very mediocre. It isn't bad; it has flavor and hits the style profile but it doesn't really stand out anywhere. A coach class porter."
"Black Jack Porter looks good - dark brown body with moderate head and good amount of lacing on the glass. Appearance is the highlight. Aroma offers only faint chocolate. The taste is of chocolate, coffee and a hint of hops. It's not bad, there just isn't enough to make much impact."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours very dark brown with about an inch frothy tan head. Head retention is average, lacing is excellent. It smells like dark chocolate, roasted malt and a bit of coffee. The taste is similar to the aroma, although I can also pick up a smoky taste too. Nice robust flavor overall. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's a little bit slick and creamy with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and it wouldn't be hard to put a few of these away in a night. Alcohol isn't noticable at all in the aroma or taste. I think it's a good overall porter. I'd recommend this to others to try."
"Pours an extremely dark brown. Tan-nish head that actually sticks around for a while, even as it falls. Nose is like mildly scented dark chocolate bits that my mother used to cook with. Flavor is surprising. Smooth and even with a more robust chocolate and roasted bean flavor than I had expected. There is almost a sweet fruit edge to it. I want to say there are very slight cherry hints, but that still might be over-exaggerating. Feel is very smooth. Goes right down. On the end of the liquid feel it seems to get a slight bit watery. I still say it is good though. Very drinkable. A pretty robust porter and one that definitely has enough character to justify trying."
"nice try, but not much above average ..."
"Tastes wet sweet with chocolate and hazelnut. Roast is mild and there is some ashy from dark grains. Hops are english, perhaps fuggles. Underlying dark caramel flavor really fills this one out and there is almost an oatmeal-type creamines. Finish has a sour tang that accompanies a revisit of the sweet chocolate wonderfully. Md body and md-heavy thickness. Strong fine carbonation strips the sweet off the tongue in the finish and leaves an acrid and metallic sting on the tastebuds. A heavy brown more than an english porter"
"D - Not really a session porter but could put away 2 or 3 without any complaints."
"D - Good porter. Very easy to drink."
"T: this is a solid tasting beer with some roasted malt and coffee tastes. nothing is too evident however or over powering. I would call this a very mild mannered mellow porter that is easy to enjoy but wont shock you. Same is true for mouthfeel and drinkability. An above par porter than wont shock the senses."
"So another in the line of regulars from Left Hand graces my glass. This one I was looking forward to as the Porters have always been a favorite of mine. This one poured a nice thick dark brown with a large creamy tan colored head on the top. Great retention let it hang around for what seemed like forever before finally being nestled down into just a thin layer across the top. The aroma was very full and sweet. Lots of chocolate roaming through it along with a touch of coffee and lots of sugar. A slight smoked presentation as well. The flavor was also very full for a porter. This almost had a stout like feel to it as it was very thick and full with a great robust profile. Lots of chocolate and coffee notes dominated it. Overall it was hard to believe this was actually not a stout. It was so full bodied, a really great porter. This would make an excellent addition to a winter lineup. A great beer and something that I will defiantly be looking forward to trying again."
"Drinkability - this is a decent ale, but not terribly exciting."
"This, unfortunately, ends up on the lower end of my personal porter scale. It lacked some meat, if you will, in terms of flavor and complication. Overall, not an impressive porter, and I can't say that Left Hand has wowed me on the whole, with the exception of their Milk Stout. Other than that, I won't be stopping in front of its place in the display case anytime soon, sad to say. There are too many other good, bold porters to drink."
"I once made a comment that IÂ’ve never met a porter that I didnÂ’t like. That is, until now. This Porter tastes remarkably like the Left Hand Milk Stout which I didnÂ’t care for either. Too much of a dry, lactose, bittersweet chocolate aftertaste and simply is too thin, watery, flat and lifeless."
"D: Passable porter and will drink again, however one would keep searching for better examples before sharing with friends."
"D: Pretty darn good. After this single bottle, I wish I had bought more."
"d- a very good porter, i will def have this one again"
"Has a ""wet," watery feel for a porter, but with a syrupy finish. A bit more milky as it warms up. Very easy to drink. Bitter enough to warm your insides, but sweet enough to take the edge off."
"Pours out a ruddy ruby with a frothed tan head and nice lacing. Chocolate is most powerful in the nose with underlying raisin and roasty grain, but mostly it's Hershey's chocolate syrup. Smells pretty thin overall. Chocolate again comes out strong in the flavor with some loud esters, and a toasty yet midly roasty and lactic finish. Mouthfeel is thin and watery yet smooth. Not interested. Won't buy this again."
"Left Hand's Black Jack Porter is a pretty decent English Porter. But there's something about it that keeps me from drinking it more often. Maybe it's the aroma. It starts off pleasant enough, reminiscent of dark chocolate covered malt balls and with moderate fruity esters that become more prominent as the beer warms. The taste has toffee and licorice overtones that blend well and achieve a slightly bitter balance. The mouthfeel is smooth and, overall, the Black Jack is a tasty beer. But, there's something about the finish, and the lingering aftertaste, that keeps me from getting too excited about this beer."
"A very drinkable English porter with an interesting American twist."
"It's a bit heavy so no more than 2 at a sitting, but this is a winner."
"Mouthfeel is thin for a porter. Very gassy which is also not very porter-like. Drinkable for basically an average effort at brewing."
"Overall: Give this beer a try. It makes me what to explore more porters."
"Pours a deep brown with moderate head; thorough lacing. Impressive for a porter. Sweet with no lack of flavor. Doesn't disappoint. Not my favorite style, but if you're in the market for a porter, this one is worth a try. Won't leave you hanging on the finish. Complex enough to engage the pallete."
"though. Worth a try!"
"Pours the darkest of browns,with a redish hue in the light. Thin tan head,not much retention,but a good lacing.Aroma Body is medium with some carbionation. Roasted coffee,and dark chocolate. Nice,but not very strong. Taste is of bittersweet chocolate,and coffee. Nice sweetness tio the finish."
"An ok porter."
"Darkly translucent (that is, a few steps away from opaque) and has a rich brown/mahogany color. Tan head that started off big and then gradually dies down. Lacing was quite good. Roasted and caramel sweetness, some coffee, and a touch of earth in the smell. Roasted nuttiness hits first in the taste and sweetness thatÂ’s close to molasses but not that sharp comes in after. Also seems light a bit of butterscotch, but that may be how IÂ’m tasting the sweetness. If thereÂ’s any coffee in the taste it comes through more in the not unpleasant resin-oiliness of the finish. Mouthfeel was medium with light apparent carbonation (so I can see why some would call it thin). For me, though, the mouthfeel struck a great balance. Not too drying or too sweet in the end. Solid effort. For me this is a Â“buy again.Â”"
"Drinks too easy for the abv, this & , Odells Cutthroat, New World (Avery) porter are two of the better porters on offer from the centennial state IMO. Would pair great with dessert or game (might marinade some elk steaks I have in this)"
"Good brew, very dark color, thin head that i keeps, fairly tight but some big bubbles. Very nice lacing. Nice roasted malt odor, semi sweet. Coffeeish taste, distinct coffee aftertaste. Nice carbonation level and the roasted malts are obviously a major presence. Reminded me of burnt chocolate milk. Great cold weather brew."
"A tasty porter - Malty but with some balance. A nice example of the style."
"D: Disappeared quickly - and I wasn't in love with the taste. I would imagine a coffee drinker could guzzle this all night."
"Overall: Not a bad beer at all. There are many I like better though. This is the worst of the Left Hand brews I picked up, but its no slap on the brewer. They make solid micro brews, but nothing I have tried as of yet is earth shattering in the micro world. If your a porterman, add this one to your resume'. It is worth tasting, but nothing to write home about... For me anyway."
"Drinkability: Not my favorite porter... but not bad.... I will have more of these and would recommend them."
"A solid looking blackish-brown color and a two-finger head that fills the pint glass. The head holds as a light brown cover throughout. The aroma is rich and immediately gives off vanilla followed by a little maltiness. First taste blends the same malty warmth with dry smokiness. At times the finish is a bit too bitter for my taste but as you drink it you kind of adjust and it settles into a substantial flavor experience. Ideally it would be a bit more drinkable for me if the bitterness could be toned down a bit but this is a finely crafted brew. There is a subtle chocolate hint as well but it gets hidden at times."
"Good porter, easy to drink a few."
"Drinkability: A definite winter quaffer IMO. The higher alcohol content keeps this from being anything that one would session with. Instead, it had the feel of a nice sipper on a cold winter day."
"This is a very smooth and rich porter with a nice balance of crystal malts and subtle hop bitterness. The coffee bean/ unsweetened chocolate taste is quite prevelant, along with some dark fruits. Mouthfeel is a touch thin, but overall not bad. I really enjoyed this one, it's perfect for a cooler evening."
"It's medium-bodied and easy drinking. Has nice complexity, as is oscillates back between the sweet/bittersweet and the roasted and charred elements. Would not turn one of these down."
"Mouth: Starts in the mouth smooth and on the sweeter side which progressively gets more bitter and chewy as it moves back and the roast malts come out. Notes of stone fruits and brown sugar. Excellent malt profile. Mouthfeel is strongly carbonated and completely drinkable."
"I keep telling myself no more from Left Hand but I am running out of new things to try at Grapevine. Pours dark, pretty much black. Aroma is very light with sweet malts and I think coffee. The mouthfeel is pretty weak with just a little hops and some sour/bitterness at the end. Not the worst Porter but again, nothing near the best. Not much else to say."
"Not really sure what to think about this beer. It pours a very unimpressive head yet it's FULL of bubbles, odd. It's very dark amber, not much light gets through so it might as well be black. The smell is pretty weak, nothing to talk about imo. The taste isn't bad, it's just not interesting or good. It's toasty which can be good but in of itself isn't anything special. It's got another sort of fruit flavored (mostly just a weak sweat flavor). The bubbles and light flavor work well in the mouth if you want a beer to drink a few of. I could definately drink a lot of these if I like the flavor more. I mean it's not bad...I could definately drink a 6 pack if I had it around."
"After all, quite pleasant and drinkable."
"this is a great bud lite for beer folks, flavor and a bit of depth, but a water filled session beer all at once.."
"Color was an opaque black with abundant head. Aroma was a lightly sweet roastiness. Flavor was a muted roastiness, with an aforementioned vegetable taste I didn't really enjoy. Mouthfeel was unremarkable. All-in-all, I wouldn not recommend this beer."
"Dark and robust flavors with cocoa, caramel, chocolate syrup and coffee. A nice porter quality with that roasted malt profile that I enjoy. A touch of sour dairy mixes in with a mini hop bite on the finish. Solid drinkability level overall."
"pours almost black with deep ruby highlights, nice tan two finger head holds very well and with good lacing to the finish. nose is big roasted malts with coffee and toffee aromas. taste same with slight hop bite ending, very balanced malt and hop. mouthfeel light to medium, with a light carbonation. had five for the review guess thats a good sign of its drinkability lol."
"This is a great reason of why I love porters! Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a dark brown/almost black, forming a thick creamy 1 inch head, that slowly fades, leaving medium rings of lace on the glass. The aroma is heavy roasted malt. The taste is thick roasted malt, creating a delicious coffee flavor. This is what a porter should taste like! Medium mouthfeel, with a smooth finish. Overall, this is a beer I could drink all night. IMHO, this is definitely what I expect from a porter."
"Pours a nice dark brown/black color, nice carbonation, nice small foamy tan head which lasts awhile, nice sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is of nice roasted sweet malts, toffee/caramel. The taste is very nice sweet/roasted malts, and toffee/caramel. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is an awesome little porter, highly recommended."
"Heavily roasted malt in the flavor with coffee tones and a small bit of tempering hop bitterness. Well balanced flavor matches themedium mouthfeel that sstarts carbonated and flattens out at the end, nicely rounding the prolonging the mellow aftertaste. Almost no hint of alcohol at all, which is impressive. A extremely sessionable and likable porter. I'll definitely look for this again."
"This is still a really good porter with a lot of dark roasted character. Probably the best I've had in the state."
"D - Despite not being as heavy as most porters (or as rich), I still really enjoyed it. I drank it as more of an after-meal beer, but I wish I had consumed it during the meal instead. Not as expected, but still enjoyable."
"I like porters, but they are not my favorite style--I could see how this could be a session beer for people that really favor porters."
"The taste is very nice, full bodied- malty and rich. The steely maltiness melds into the chocolate malt and again the hops, this time in the form of a slight bitterness, accents the overall taste. There is also more of a hop character to this porter due to the Magnum and U.S. Goldings used, making it more balanced and less malty. Not as roasty as alot of Porters, but is more true to the Engish Porter style with a complex balance of young and old flavours. Very complex with differnet flavours in every sip as the beer warms. Mouthfeel also fits the beer itself and style well. Drinkability is good as well."
"Rougly pours a nice big head, with a black color. The smell is soooo good, it has the smooth roasted malts that actually remind me of a Breakfast Stout. The taste is even smoother with chocolately roasted coffee malts that are just great!! The mouthfeel is pretty good, no bumps, but it is a medium bodied porter, still pretty good though. Overall I will go back and buy a bunch of this...very good!!"
"Interesting stout...first english stout I've had so I will rate based upon enjoyment."
"A very nice porter. Great beer to wash down roasted pork with rice and beans. A decent effort, and well worth a try if you can pick up a bottle at your local store or bar."
"I could drink a few of these in one sitting. There is a great deal of flavor without it being too strong, and it's just heavy enough to be full-bodied, though not thick or chewy."
"Drinkability: I got to say, I am very impressed with this porter, one of the best I have had. I could see drinking this all day as you unload the ships."
"Overall: Nice and simple, this beer doesn't try to innovate or impress. My only complaint is with the full mouthfeel, which seems a bit full even for a robust porter. I do love the balance between the sweetish start, and the bitterness that lingers into the finish. I think I'll have another."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with a brewed on date on the front label. Color was black unless held right to a light where it was a deep, deep mahogany. Had about 2 fingers of brownish foam that evaporated to a thin head and lacing during the drink. The smell was really off on this one for what I expected. Not sure if something happened during shipment but it a really strange aroma that I couldn't identify. Even had the wife who is good at picking out smells try it and she said ""ugh - that's awful"". In the background, I could smell the coffee and chocolate malts but overpowered by the other. I'll rate a 3 as a mix of what I got (1) and what others have said (4). The mouthfeel was pretty good but a little on the watery side. The taste was excellent. A year ago, I wouldn't drink a porter if offered but I've really developed a taste for them lately. Overall, another outstanding beer from Left Hand who are quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. Highly recommend. (4.0, RR, T,Y)"
"This is one easy to drink brew. I'm glad I have some more to drink in this cold weather."
"After a very promising start, this beer kind of went to tasting like a watery tea made from dried hay. Glad for the chance to have tried this but I can't recommend this beer based on this bottle."
"Drinkability: Best porter I've had so far this year. Doesn't try to overdo it with the coffee/roasted flavors. Glad I have a couple more of these left."
"Recommended."
"Oh well, their stouts are very nice, but this porter is a pass."
"Perfect drinkability. An excellent beer."
"Smooth and medium bodied, this is very drinkable. This is complex enought to be sipped and savored, but light and enjoyable enough to be enjoyed with food or as a session brew."
"Overall good beer. The taste was a bit grainy and chalky, but it still held its own. I recommend you try this one at least once."
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve ounce brown glass bottle, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"D- Very nice porter. Nothing over the top but very well done for the style."
"The body is between mid to full. Carbonation is light but somewhat masked by the smooth texture. Overall a good porter but not something I would bet the house on."
"Pours a blackish red color with a 1 inch fluffy head. Smell is very faint but a I smell some roasted peanuts in the mix. The taste is a a very unbalance hoppy/roasted character, it actually reminds me of roeasted grasshoppers that I had before. This is a decent offering from Left Hand, that I had in the moutain mixer."
"Its all here, the coffee, chocolate, and such. Comes off thick enough and chewy. Drinkable on a nice summer day."
"DÂ—a very drinkable porter, heavy on the chocolateÂ…might be a good winter beer (although it is very good in July as well)"
"D- results in a high drinkability for any porter lover, otherwise it may not be as high"
"Overall impression: Nicely balanced - just a bit thin."
"This brew pours a dark brown color. The head is one finger in height, and recedes rather quickly into decent lacing. The aroma is full of chocolate with burnt malt underneath. The taste is of burnt malt and chocolate. It has an overall sweetness that is much greater than any other porter I have had. It isn't bad, but also isn't quite to my liking in a porter. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a decent brew, but there are much better porters out there to be had."
"12 oz. bottled on 3/22/06, sampled on 4/24. It pours a deep dark brown/ruby with a half inch khaki head of medium-sized bubbles. The smell is quite pleasant with a big roasted, nutty, earthy quality along with some coffee and perhaps oats. It has a medium body and a taste that resembles the aroma, with lots of earthy malts with a mild citric/pine hop profile that leaves a tamed bitterness. Not only did this exceed my expectations, but it's also pretty tasty and quite drinkable."
"Overall a pretty poor porter, I will avoid this one in the future."
"Bottom line: lf you're looking for something dark that would work in the summertime, this will probably work."
"This is a lighter version of a porter. I would prefer a heavier mouthfeel and bolder flavor. It's not bad, but it's too mild for me to consider searching out."
"Brownish-burgundy color, with a full head of light brown cream. Light aroma with hints of brown sugar and chocolate/toast, light berry. Flavor is dry, very yeasty, earthy, full of cocoa, chocolate and roast flavors. Body is light. A fairly average porter. Drinkable."
"Left Hang Black Jack Porter pours a very dark brown with ruby highlights from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is on the malty side, but fairly subtle, and improves upon warming. Taste is pretty good, malt predominates, some fruitiness is present. Notes of chocolate as it warms become evident. Not bad, worth a try for sure."
"D- definatly a brew that hard liquor folk can enjoy. Very fun and intersting taste. Not going to always keep it on hand, but will being looking for it some time down the road."
"very smooth and too sweet in my eyes. yeah, it's an english porter, but could have been drier. smokiness and coffee make this a decently complex brew. almost black in color with a supe creamy head. made pouring concentration-intensive"
"Opinion: I am enjoying this beer. It is a bit light for my taste, but is still a very drinkable brew. It is hard to say what I would like better about it, except that it finishes a bit acidic, and would probably benefit from a bit more basic water. That is about all I have to say cause it is a pretty good beer."
"cheers..."
"I have to admit I am very impressed with this brew. I have been let down the last few times I've checked out Left Hand brews, but this was impressive. It poured with a very dark, black-brown body with a small tan head. The aroma was suprisingly well-balanced, with hints of chocolate, coffee and espresso, deep roasted bitter and sweet malts, and caramel. It had a similar taste, with a toffee, carmely, smokiness due ot the roasts, but was relatively smooth and not very overpowering. It was definitely a sipping beer, with a smooth, warming mouthfeel. One of the best from Left Hand."
"Notes: I really enjoyed this offering and wish they had this sitting on the shelves of my local grocery store. I have had nothing but good things to say about the Left Hand brewing company and it looks like they have struck gold again."
"Deep brown head, ruby red highlights when angled towards bright lights. Gorgeous large tan head, patchy and stringy lacing noted throughout. Sweet noseÂ—molasses, toasty malts and plums. A nicely balanced porterÂ—the initial palate is full of caramel and burnt malts, traces of chocolate and cocoa. Loads of other flavoringsÂ—raisins, figs, nuts and freshly ground french-vanilla coffee beans. Slightly carbonated, just an underlying touch of English-like hops. Very nice, oily slick and quite smoothÂ—a standout English porter."
"Nice and thick feel, good charcter. I'd drink this again but I'd rather have an Edmund Fitzgerald or Arcadia London Porter."
"A much better beer than what I was anticipating. A rich black malt, chocolate, and milk sweetness to the nose. Thick and dark, almost black with a soft creamy, lightly tan head. Tastes creamy and bold without heavy sweetness or body. Chocolatey, robust, toffee, and espresso flavored. A nice lactose sweetness softens the beer considerably, offering a fermented sourness. Creamy and smooth texture. Finishes lightly chocolatey, modestly sweet, and clean for a porter. Hinges on a milk stout, otherwise, a terriffic porter."
"I've said it before and I'll say it again: ""a fine beer but I'd be unwilling to buy it again"" given the other choices on the market. Give me a free bottle or a lack of other choices and it's what I'd drink. Bonus points for a solid 6.4% alcohol when many competitors are closer to 5 than 6."
"Left Hand is capable of brewing outstanding dark beer (Imperial Stout) and lousy dark beer (Milk Stout). Black Jack Porter falls somewhere in the cavernous middle. It's okay, I suppose, and should be acceptable to a wide range of beer drinkers, but I'm trying my damnedest to suppress a yawn."
"D- The slight sweetness and darker malts add some interest but the finish doesn't offer much."
"Deep brown to black with a thin tan colored head. The nose is dominated by milk chocolate. There is a touch of roast malt, and just a little citrus in the end. The flavor has the milk chocolate, followed by roast malt (itÂ’s almost a burnt malt character). A bit of sweetness accompanies a mild citrus finish that gives it just a hint of bitterness, and offsets the chocolate well. The mouth feel is a little thin, a bit slick. Drinkability is OK."
"This one was off to the races from sip one. It goes from start to finish in a flash, denting the consciousness, but barely. The elements blink on and off too quickly to fully develop, which is a shame because they all show some promise. It is drinkable, and is in no way a labor, but that's partly because you need more in your mouth to keep the flavor from being forgotten, so a quick next sip is mandatory. It's fair enough, but only that, what with its happy feet and all."
"This beer is worth checking out."
"Overall: A nice smoky porter. Would recommend to people who are fans of Sierra Nevada's porter. Doesn't have the same chemical smokeyness of O'fallon's Smoked. Has a natural smokiness which seems to stem from the malt. I like Left Hand's pale ale, but this has to beat it."
"Pours dark brown in color with a short light-tan head that soon fades into a bubbly lace. Nose is chocolaty malts and smoky charcoal. Body seems a bit thin. Taste begins with sweet malt and dark toffee followed by cocoa and some more smokiness. Grassy and mildly spicy hops show up in the finish. A decent porter but nothing all that special."
"Overall Impression: Almost too easy to drink. Light body, watery texture, mild taste, I guess that equals good session beer. The flavor is ok, nose is good, looks good, mouthfeel is lacking. WhatÂ’s the opposite of Imperial Porter?"
"This porter is very good and worth trying. It is a little wet and over-coffee for my tastes, but it is definitely in the realm of a very good beer."
"The color is a dark nutty brown with an average-sized, off white head. The aroma is of sweet, dark malts with just a touch of roast. The overall taste is a little sweeter and not quite as rich as most porters I've tried; I think that is why I'm enjoying this beer so damn much. The primary malt flavor is still of dark malts with an ample chocolate flavor, but sweeter than expected with perhaps a mild caramel malt taste. Roast flavors come into play towards the middle of a sip and help carry an extra long sweet finish. Black Jack's long-lasting finish has to be the highlight here, the flavor from a sip seems to last forever. This is now one of my favorite porters, the sweet complexity leaves me craving more. A big thanks to Left Hand for bringing this beer to Texas."
"Mouthfeel is nice and full, but not too heavy. One of the better craft porters, a style that is very often overlooked. I could easily session this one, maybe even put it on the fridge rotation."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Very true to style for an English porter, goes down easy, smooth as a babyÂ’s bottom, tasty to boot, and I can get it fresh anytime I want Â– so eat your heart out! GREAT brew."
"Black in colour with muted aromas of roasted nuts and a touch of chocolate and smoke. The flavor was far less sweet than I had expected. The roasted grain chalkiness was the dominant flavor. Little hop presence to speak of, and not a heck of a lot of body either. Perhaps this was an old bottle? Either way, I've had better porters."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby red tones. A nice tan head poured at the start but disappeared without a trace within a minute. Nose is detecting chocolate roasted malts. Taste is balanced more towards the chocolate roasted malts as the hop presence is barely discernable. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy but thin for the style. Overall drinkability is pretty good. This is a decent beer but one I will not go out of my way for."
"The taste is light up front, but followed by a rich roasted caramel not and a bit of chalkiness up front. I get sweet fruity notes of burnt raisins as well as some nice rich chocolate notes. This is a really nice malty porter, there is not much in the way of hop notes, just a mix of sweet and dark malt notes. While I really like the malt character this beer is a bit too thin to solely rest on it, there needs to be a bit more hops, or a thicker body to support and compliment the lush maltiness of this Porter."
"I don't find anything much stands out in this beer."
"The mouthfeel is great. Once again my chocolate milk analogy comes to mind, though this is somewhat watery even for a porter, much less a milk. Still has a creamy feel to it which is delightful, though. This is probably my second favorite porter next to Bully! Porter."
"This one is a certainly lighter than your average porter. A blood red color almost, with dark brown hues, as opposed to dark brown with red, as most porters tend to be. Smell is a bit odd. Nice and malty though, but there's a kind of disagreeable soy sauce taste. I just recently had a Sam Adams Triple Bock, which I thought was terrible, and ultra soy saucy, so maybe I'm sensitive to that smell. Let's see how it tastes. Ehhh... it's ok. Not as rich as I was expecting. Malty, of course, roasty, and a bit of coffee taste, though that odd soy sauce is there. I don't know what that is... anyone?? Very strange, and not in a good way. Thin watery mouthfeel and not really the kind of beer that makes you want another as sood as you're done. Get something else instead of this."
"Very, very dark brown color on top, completely opaque, until you get to the bottom of the glass. Head foames up nicely, falls down to a solid layer of creamy foam. Nice strong chocolate and coffee, with some acidity, and frosting sweetness present. Taste has very well balanced flavors, but lean toawrd the understated side. Low acidity evident, which is a plus in my book. Coffee tones are full and slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is full, and well carbonated. A good change after the flat beer I have been getting lately See: VIking."
"Overall, a pretty good beer. It isn't my favorite porter, but it is still pretty good overall. Worth a try certainly."
"Notes: light to medium body, good mouthfeel, leaves a dry aftertaste. Its good, but not as well balanced or full bodied as I expect and enjoy. Very drinkable for a 6.4% beer."
"The color of lapsang souchong tea, and a bit of that flavor as well. Thin brew. Little froth, less lacing. If it were all a wee more.... it'd be great. Everything is in balance here, sweet and smooth with a smokey chaser that adds some musty dryness. It's just not big enough. I mean I could drink a bunch of this, but it's not real satisfying."
"Reviewed from a 22oz bomber on 12-27-04. Pours out brown with reddish highlights and a slight tan head that disappears quickly leaving no lace or bubbles. Roasted malt, chocolate and caramel make up the aroma. Taste starts off with a bit of sweet caramel before a bit of chocolate comes in. A bit plain overall and it lacks any significant roastiness. Mouthfeel is about expected and the drinkability is ok. Nothing special or bad just your average run of the mill porter."
"Drinkability: This is the type of porter that could be thoroughly enjoyed at almost any time of year. Why? The beer is simply very well-balanced, not at all 'heavy', has a clean palette, but is chock full of complexities. Quaff or savored, this is a well-built porter."
"Body is thin. short clean finish."
"Poured a pretty looking black with an ivory head. Strong smells of black licorice, coffee, chocolate... The beer was a little watery and lighter than I hoped for - looking for something to chew on here. The taste was above average. Toasty marshmallow, coffee and bittersweet chocolate flavors. No noticeable hop flavor but lots of malty goodness. An OK porter that I wouldn't mind trying again."
"Palate starts with in-your-face roasty sweetness. Almost too sweet up front. Sweetness is partially tempered by some roasted coffee bitterness. A little sweet for me. Big bodied, with a syrupy mouthfeel."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a small head that fades off fast. The aroma is very chocolaty with some hints of coffee and other malts. The flavor is much the same. A semi-sweet malt comprised mostly of a chocolate flavor and backed with some coffee. Very smooth with a medium body and great mouthfeel. This is a really good porter."
"This beer departs a nice brown color with a ruby hue. The head is a finger that falls to ring the beer. The nose is all about chocolate. Damn it smells nice. The flavor is also a huge blast of chocolate that sticks with me way through the finish. The feel is thick and creamy. The drinkability is really good as well. I like this beer. For my friend Don...This is just a good beer."
"Medium bodied. Smooth at the start and finish, witht he roasted malts lasting briefly on the tongue after swallowing. Very drinakble as this follows the porter style well, a session beer with just enough flavor to enjoy all day."
"No bottled on date listed. Could not find ABV, though this site says 6.4% and I bought this in a state that unfortunately could not sell beer over 6%. Nice color porter that had little head and even less carbonation. Great taste for a porter though a stronger than average aftertaste. No real sensation on the tongue but a drinkable beer nonetheless. Definitely try this porter out."
"This is a porter that pushes the brown ale side of the style meter. It's a decent beverage, but not one I'd go out of my way to hunt down."
"pours a slightly above average medium to dark brown colour with pretty much no head. it looks almost like a flat (though slightly thicker) coke. not bad, but not great. the aroma is mostly caramel and malt with some wood notes. again, slightly above average, at best. upon first taste, you get virtually no flavour. weird. then the burnt malt kicks in along with som semi-sweet chocolate flavour and some wood/cardboard. overall, this one was a bit too thin and carbonated for my liking when it comes to porters. it seemed like it was doing a balancing act between brown ale and porter at times, and i much prefer my porters to be closer to the stout end of the spectrum. it isn't a bad brew, it's simply underwhelming. i'd give it a marginal thumbs up, but with much room for improvement."
"A nice mouthfeel, with plenty of creaminess. However, I ultimately don't find this beer to be that ""drinkable."""
"Pours with a two-finger tan head that fades quickly to just a thin layer leaving a little lace. Deep red/amber color nearly opaque. Light carbonation, medium bodied. Nose has a hint of chocolate. Starts with a roasted sweetness and finishes smooth with no bitter aftertaste. A good porter; nice to find a 12oz bottle on sale for $1 from Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY. Their site lists the ABV at 5.8%."
"All and all this was an average porter, in my opinion it was too thin and watery. Still it was very drinkable and refreshing."
"Final Thought: I was disappointed with this since my acquaintance and owner of the liquor store praised it... still pretty good though!"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dark roasted malt scent with little hops and a dry yeast aroma. The taste is average. It has a grainy dark malt flavor with a dry finish. It is watery and weak tasting. The mouthfeel is horrible. It is a medium/full bodied beer with little carbonation. This beer drinks average. It has little aroma and flavor along with almost no carbonation. This is a average porter at best."
"Pours a deep amber with a thin head that leaves a trace of lacing,aroma of coffee and fruit with some bitter chocolate as well but it is subdued.Taste has a fruity edge to it with some milk chocolate and earth it mingles pretty well together.A pretty solid porter what have liked a little more muscle to it but good none the less."
"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a small 1/2"" beige head over the dark reddish brown brew. Good lacing, and this offering has a light aroma of hearty malts. Taste is sweetly of the dark grains, a combination of what seems to be coffee, chocolate, and maybe rauch. The mouthfeel is excellently smooth, even if a bit too sweet. A bit heavy for major drinkability, but certainly would have another..."
"Blown away by another brew from this company. I saw their cheesy labels and wasn't expecting much. I've been surprised by each one that I've hand. Give me a 6'er of this is one hand, and a 6'er of Jackman's in the other! Exceptional brew...wonderful porter! Kudos!"
"It's a nice beer after a long week."
"12oz Bottled 10/28/03 Poured a rootbeer brown with nothing of a head at all. Coffee and chocolate notes in the aroma. Somewhat thin mouthfeel and slightly flat. Flavor a bit weak, roasted malt and lots of coffee. Slight metallic in the finish. Overall an average porter."
"A nice porter, not my favorite but a decent offering."
"Ruby chocolate color with a quickly dissipating head. Decent lacing. Light smoky taste. Initially sweet coffee flavor with a decent biiter end. Mouthfeel IMHO was somewhat light. Didn't seem like a strong Baltic Porter, but more of a tamer regular Porter. Drinkability was very good, went down smooth with a slight bitter aftertaste. Probably a good choice on a warm day. Overall a decent offering."
"The Black Jack pours a mild brown body with a suttle yet noticeable copper head. Not a creamy porter, but tasty nontheless. Hints of licorice tickle your tongue while a blend of sweet malts and fruity hops combine for an ale-like finish. Not your typical porter, but worth the try."
"Pours a dark brown/copper color with decent head that fades quickly. Smells of roasted malts, raisins, and a hint of licorice. The taste is a nice blend of chocolate and a fruity raisin flavor followed up by a smooth licorice taste that complements the beer quite well. Clean crisp taste and a little weaker than most heavier porters out there. Still a smooth beer and very drinkable."
"12 oz bottle. Poured the color of ice tea. with a moderate head that didn't stick around long. Lacing is evident on the glass. Aroma is sweet with a hint of chocolate. The taste is sweet malt and creamy smooth. A bit thin mouthfeel for style but still a very enjoyable beer. Very drinkable!"
"Depsite the lack of body in this beer (a significant factor to my personal enjoyment of porter styles), it is still quite good. This is my first experience with the Left Hand Brewing Company, and I would definitely like to try more of there offerings."
"A good porter that has a decent appearance, light nose and good taste. The body is a deep reddish brown and pulls up a reasonable cream-colored head and leaves minimal lace effect. The nose is smoky and also a bit sweet smelling. The flavor is a chocolate and carmel delight that takes the smoky nose and buries it in sweetness and good maltiness. The body is too flat, however, and lets down on supporting the fullness of the flavor. Still, drinkability is enhanced by the good flavor and only slightly elevated ABV."
"This beer is a very dark brown that shows a bit of red when held to the light. A nice little tan head sits on top of that. The smell is heavily roasted. As is the taste, roasted, with coffee and creamy flavors coming through as well. This is a very smooth tasting beer, a pretty damn good porter."
"F"
"Dark brown, ruby in color with ample carbonation resulting in a large, persistent, and very lacy light tan head. Aroma is malty sweet and chocolatey. Sweet chocolate starts off the flavor, too, which develops a rich, creamy mouthfeel and a roasty finish and aftertaste. A good porter, though without a ton of depth."
"Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is chocolate malts and sweet. A light bodied porter. Malts are chocolate, coffee and sweet. Hops are piney and spicy. Well balanced. Very choclately. Finish is more coffee than chocolate. Finishes a little light for a porter, but still tasty and very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"22 oz. bottle with what I think is a very cool bottle cap featuring a red left hand on a white background. Pours a dark brown to black with a one finger thick off-white (almost yellowish) head. The head diminishes rather quickly leaving an unimpressive looking beer---it does look purplish when held up to light which is a cool feature. Smells very pleasant, with aromas of coffee, roasted malt, and some chocolate. A fairly nice taste is also present, although a bit mild--dominant flavors are that of malt and a bit of chocolate. A very smooth beer (although feels a bit thin in the mouth) which I found to be easy drinking. While I wouldn't seek this beer out, I'd certainly try it again if the opportunity came up."
"Pours a dark, reddish brown. Thin, sudsy, and relatively stable head. Smell is of roasted grains and american hops, but I'd call it lacking and muted for a good porter. Taste is malty-sweet with bitter chocolate. It's a little on the sweet side of things, but has a creamy, full-bodied texture. At times, it seems a little acidic....don't know where to place that sensation. All in all, it's a decent, enjoyable beer, but not outstanding."
"12 oz bottle served at the Food Shack in J-Town, FL. Murky deep brown color. Hints of purple-ruby edges depending on the light. Smooth, silky, rich smell of roasted coffee and sweet chocolate. Same tastes follows. Nice hop snap follows. Both bitter and sweet chocolate tastes are present. This beer then takes a turn, the flavors are full and rich, but a slick chalkiness lingers, then the body turns watery. I gave it lower grades for mouthfeel and drinkability for this reason. I am still glad to see it Florida and would buy it again."
"This brew poured a small head of fine off-white bubbles and a semi-transparent dark brown body. It had a nice malty aroma and a coffee flavor with some mild roasted caramel notes that was smooth from start to finish."
"When poured into my glass, this brew had a small off-white head with small bubbles that quickly diminished. The lacing with this brew was fair. The body was brown in hue. This brew had a moderate malty aroma along with a mild coffee aroma. It had a mild flavor that was long lasting. The body was light and somewhat watery in my opinion."
"The taste was of caramel with a sweetend coffee finish. Medium-full body, but still a little light, that goes down very clean and smooth and is very creamy. Very nice porter."
"A nice looking dark porter, not that dark, with a decent creamy head. I detect a caramel like malt aroma. It has a nice mild hop bite. Tastes more like an amber ale but the caramel and coffee undertones come through after more sips. Leaves a dry aftertaste."
"Color is a dark caramel brown, fizzed out foamy head leaving barely any lacing. Smell is of sweet malt and tangy, slightly roasty and soft. Taste is more of the same, lightly robust of drying dark roasted malt with a light presence of hop bitterness. Light and airy, earthy dry bitterness throughout the finish. Feel is a bit thin for a porter, could have some heavier boldness. Its a drinkable porter for sure but I was a little put off by its lightness."
"As it warms, the dry chocolaty aroma grows, as does the earthy, slightly metallic subflavor. Inexplicably, the balancing, subtle hoppy bitterness grows right along with the maltiness. Finally, a late flavor of slightly green coffee, or possibly moist coffee grounds rounds out an enjoyable bomber of beer. This one was nice and fresh, malty, subtle and well balanced: a well made-detail oriented effort."
"Dark coppery-brown body, initially a big 3-finger head. Head retention good, some residual lace on surface and glass. Pretty straight forward malty, chocolatey aroma. Very chocolatey, slightly bitter flavor with notes of roasted grains. Flavor is very good, but perhaps a bit thin. A bit light bodied for a baltic porter, but smooth and rather creamy. Leaves a thick oily hop coating in the mouth. A very quaffable brew."
"This one landed at #39 in Stuart A. Kallen's 1997 book ""The 50 Greatest Beers In the World"" with Samuel Smith's at 7 and Geary's at 34. I'd have to disagree. It's good, don't get me wrong, but I've been drinking a lot of Anchor Porter lately."
"This beer poured into the glass a dark ruby/gold/brown color. THe head was fairly thick and beige in color. Somewhat lasting to 1/2 glass. Lace was foamy. The aroma was light, hints of grains and malt. The taste was decent, tastes of malt, chocolate, some dark fruit, semi-sweet in the beginning and middle but dry at the end. Only thing I wanted more from this beer is more aroma, with this I believe the tastes would have been more prominent."
"Dark black in color, nice lasting creamy off white head, roasty chocolatey malty aroma. Roasted malty burnt coffee flavors, nice dry burnt bitternes in the finish. Light-medium body light creamy mouthfeel, the hops really stand out in the end, this is decent porter, I like it."
"This beer pours with about a half inch of creamy headand nice lace. Very light colored for a porter (it is almost red). Light carbonation. Very well balanced taste with a hint of chocolate. An above average beer that I will have again."
"The pour a deep brown to black, mountainous and frothy head, and a fine lace blankets the glass, both are light chocolate in color. Nose is sweet malt, hints of maple syrup, lightly toasted grains. Start is sweet, the middle is moderate , the finish has pertinent carbonation, acceptablely hopped, and a fair to midlin dry aftertaste. A decent drinking beer, good but not great and none the less worth a try."
"Note: this beer was #39 in Stuart Kallen's ""The 50 Greatest Beers in the World"""
"Pours a clear but dark reddish brown color, with a decent tan head. Aroma is lightly malt, notes of caramel and dark bread. On the palate, the flavors are moderately sweet, caramel, slightly husky, and dark bread. Mouth feel is slightly watery but smooth... light to medium body. The finish is semi-sweet with caramel notes. Overall I like this porter."
"Has a good color to it, if not a dark as other porters.  Good flavor, if a bit light, with chocolate overtones.  Not one of the best ones out there, but definitly worth trying."
"Short but staying caramel head.  Unexpectedly light in color, amber.  Nice malt/carbonation balance (not highly carbed). An initial dark malt, intersected by a side-cutting tofee and coffee sweetness.  Overall, a distinctly sweetened coffee flavor.  A little thin.  Nice."
"Notes: One of the better Porters to have passed along my palate in a while. Just the right level of sweetness and astringency"
"Pretty average, nothing distinguishing good or bad."
