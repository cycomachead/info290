I didnt care for the mineral quality at all that seemed to dominate the brew. Overall a good idea but it just didnt pan out the way it could if the recipe was revisited.","stakem","Sep 02, 2012"

3.8,1.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"I had this beer on tap at pardidise by the slice in wernserville,pa. The appearance was a dark brown color body, with a thin creamy lace round the top of the body. The smell was of roasted malts and some molasses. The taste had some choclolate notes but the malts and the molasses was the dominate flavor. The mouth feel was great nice and smooth and not thick like a regular porter. Over all i enjoyed this one and wish they bottled it.","chefhatt","Jan 01, 2012"

3.37,-9.9,3.5,4,3,3,3.5,"Pours out as a transparent dark brown color, with almost no head at all on it. This has a surprising appearance for a porter, the color to me should have been much darker. The smell of dark roasted malts and just a little bit of molasses on the nose. The taste is pretty weak, I really hoped for this beer to be much more flavorful but to me it seemed as though they were forgetting something. The mouthfeel was watery and kind of boring. Not really sure about this one.","Knapp85","Apr 28, 2010"
3.63,-2.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Had a pint on cask at Tap and Table. It appears a murky dark brown with a short tan head. The beer is smooth and drinkable, but a bit strong for the flavor impact. It sounds silly, but a 6% beer should be richer. This had a pleasant chocolate and coffee roast flavor, but not much else. I'd have expected it to be only about 4.5%. Anyways, it's a simple but tasty beer. Certainly worth drinking a pint.","tempest","Mar 22, 2010"
3.68,-1.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Dark tan with a thick two-finger, mocha head. Nose is molasses, brown sugar, roasted barley, malt and chocolate. Taste is what I should have expected, having had shoo-fly pie - molasses and brown sugar with some bread and chocolate. Very sweet. No false advertising at work here! Finish included a welcome slight bitterness. All together a decent beer, but not one I could drink a lot of.","regspeir","Jan 11, 2010"
3.11,-16.8,3.5,2.5,3.5,3,3,"D- Not much of a porter of molasses fan, but I wasn't too impressed overall with this. Felt a little bland. Hopefully this falls off tap soon and the pub gets something a little better up.","bigfnjoe","Dec 23, 2009"
3.98,6.4,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Overall this was a very solid American Porter, that contains nothing really unique in its flavor, but it is quite solid and very balanced. Recommended.","Lunch","Nov 30, 2009"
3.86,3.2,4,3,4,4,4.5,"Drinkability: this is a very sessionable porter that is easy to quaff and hits the spot when looking for a beer in the style. Worth trying this.","Gavage","Nov 22, 2009"
3.61,-3.5,4,3,4,3.5,3.5,"I love the aftertaste of the Shoo-Fly Porter. You can take a sip and feel the malts playing with your taste buds for a long time after swallowing. However, for being only 6% it does have a distinct alcohol flavor. With so much riding on its great aftertaste i think this beer is best as a slow sipper.","Ranbot","Oct 19, 2009"
3.88,3.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Drinkability: A very solid porter from Lancaster, and I liked the nitro aspect with all the flavors it was bringing. I'd drink it again.","asabreed","Jul 20, 2009"
3.53,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - I guess I was expecting more from this beer...if I had to chose I might actually have a piece of pie over this beer...nice for dessert but a little too much molasses for me","thain709","Apr 14, 2009"
3.8,1.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D-Good. This brew doesn't blow you away but it builds into a well done, easy drinking and flavourful brew.","Deuane","Mar 11, 2009"
3.61,-3.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"Drinkability: Reasonably drinkable so that I could easily have a couple more. While the flavor is not as intense and rich as eating a piece of Shoo Fly Pie, the taste and aroma capture some of the experience. I'll probably try this one again.","drtth","Mar 09, 2009"
3.97,6.1,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Overall- Sweet, very close to Shoo-Fly pie. A nice dessert/ night cap beer.","NJpadreFan","Mar 09, 2009"
3.53,-5.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is a bit harsh with the carbonation. Full bodied, and spritzy along the tongue. I'd like to try this either on nitro, or on cask to escape the zippiness of the bubbles.","weeare138","Mar 01, 2009"
3.68,-1.6,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"D - This is a far better way to taste shoo fly than traditional co2 - I find the malt to be smoother and nuances of malt come forward and the chance to taste the molasses is there. John Frantz asked 'how did you like it?' I must say I appreciate the cask much more, it isn't gassy and I actually wanted to order more than 1, but the cask was kicked","Slatetank","Feb 28, 2009"
3.83,2.4,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D - Not as much of a Shoo-Fly presence as I was anticipating, but still very tasty and drinkable. One of the better offerings from Lancaster I've had, and certainly unique, especially for the area.","ffejherb","Beers"
4.08,9.1,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"This one was dispensed via gravity pour and arrived with two fingers of soapy, foamy, deep-tan head with mild retention. The color was a deep, dark, brown with little to no light penetration. Nose had an interesting mix of slight charcoal and dark chocolate. Mouthfeel was slightly full, approaching creamy. I got an anise-like flavor on the tongue. The finish was dry, especially so for a porter, but better that than the God-awful sweetness of its namesake.","woodychandler","0"
3.49,-6.7,4.5,3,3.5,4,3.5,"d: I liked this more than the score would indicate, I was just hoping something more diferent I suppose. If you have the chance, definitely try this one.","DIM","Feb 18, 2009"
3.86,3.2,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D- not too bad but the dark roast portion of it is a tad overpowering. I think the molassess should be the focus, given the name.","Dodo2step","Feb 15, 2009"

3.42,-8.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"On tap at Capones. Poured a dark brown color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of chocloate, lighter roastiness, and caramel. Tastes of chocolate, molasses, roast, and caramel. Some lacing left on the glass. I love Shoo-fly pie, but just didn't see it in this one.","hopdog","0"
