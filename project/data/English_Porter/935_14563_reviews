"For occassional beer drinkers, this is a fine beer."

"O: Easy to drink with a pleasant amount of complexity of flavors and low alcohol which makes it sessionable."

"Overall, a shining example of an English Porter, such a great beer and is really a true example of the style. Great representation and a beer that I will revisit many times over."

" This is not the beer to sip. Its a true English Porter. Drink 1, 2, and 3, wait a bit, then repeat process."

"notes; lighter in color than any other porter I have had. No smoke flavor maybe there are no roasted malts here only toasted. Overall this is a pleasant tasting beer, lacking in complexity."

"I may have to go back and reassess my perceptions of this beer and the style. My 3 favorite examples (Fullers, Sam Smiths, Old Engine Oil) are all noticeably darker - in color and flavor. This beer reminds me most of an American-style, brewpub brown ale."

"O - A beer I'd go for based on how drinkable it is. Good session beer."
""

"Pours an opaque black with a 1/4 inch foamy tan head that quickly fades to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, caramel/toffee, dark fruit, and some port wine aromas. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, and some dark fruit and port wine flavors. There is a mild tartness in the flavor as well. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very average beer all around and honestly a bit disappointing in my opinion."
""

"Overall, this is very drinkable. Good stuff. I would have this again."
"Much thanks to friends for introducing this on to me."
""
""

"O: A fantastic porter. I often find myself not really caring for dark stouts and porters because they're so overrun with bitter chocolate overtones, but this really strikes a nice balance and becomes actually very drinkable, even long into the night. Awesome!"
""
""
""
"O - This is a very tasty beer, but it's hard to justify at 4/$12.99 Being that this is the first and only time I've seen this beer, it's hard to tell if it's the store or brewery. Not too shabby though."
""
"O: Solid English porter. The sticky lacing and flavor were really good. I preferred this porter over the St. Peter's."
""
""
"O= a noteable and worthy English Porter."

"This is a very nice porter and perhaps a standard-setter to build from."
"Slainte."
" I can not tell if this is as good or better than the 1825 recipe that I tried in the past."
"Overall: This is a fine beer, but I'm not sure I'd say it was worth the price. If you're not on a budget, go for it."
"D- This beer has some subtle but unique qualities underneath a mellow roasted malt flavor and a nice light cherry tartness that compliments the flinty hint in the nose."
"O=Good porter, a beer with highs and lows, but very solid overall."
"Pours dark, with fast disapearing white head. Malty and a moderate roasty aroma. A bit above average mouthfeel. Very smooth, good drinkability. The taste is mostly rich malts, the roastiness in the secondary. Biased on the sweet side. Good understated carbonation."
"This English porter has a touch of spice and a little more rich/heavy than a plain jane brown beer. The best attribute of this beer is its aroma. I prefer a beer like this on a cold wintery night. It will fill you up so don't plan on pounding the Original Flag Porter."
"D: The beer is easy to drink and it is quite sessionable with the low alcohol content."
"I'll but this one again, when it's time to read a book about 19th century beer brewing, which happens to be every so often."
"Dark mahogany color, almost black with thin, tan head that dissipates quickly. Some lacing. Rich, roasty malt aroma, bready with some caramel and raisin notes. Roasted malt flavor, a bit of sweet caramel. Hints of raisin and licorice. Good depth of flavor and complexity. Subtle bitterness. Medium body with a slightly chewy mouthfeel."
"D. Oh yeah, getting this one again. With that silky mouthfeel, i would gladly accept many waves of this ruby-black ambrosia. cliche, but it is 1825 and all..."
"Poured a really dark black with ruby hues around the edges. small tan head quickly dissipated and left no lacing. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. Taste is pretty much the same, nice roasted taste in the back, and some nutty flavor at the end. Mouthfeel was pretty thin and I felt lacking to me. I was expecting more robust flavor of something, but the thiness kind of threw me off. Overall its a pretty good beer but I would not find myself seeking this one out again."
"To my surprise, the whole package is considerably tasty and drinkable. One of the sweeter porters I've had, and with little doubt one of the better tasting ones I've had."
"Does not impress, but offers a few unique flavors. Nothing I would go out of my way to have again, but I wouldnt turn one down if offered."
"Beer is thinner than expected and mostly sweet with minimal roast in the back of the mouth. It is simple and easy to drink but I fail to see what is special about it. The original yeah I get it but what else? I find myself wanting more of anything here, more body, more carbonation, more sweetness or more roast. I'd have it again but I doubt I'd buy it again, unless on cask, I'd be interested then."
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is easy drinking and a very decent example of the style. The warmer the brew gets, the more the aroma and flavor clashes with the difference between sour almost lactic notes and fresh chocolate."
"Overall, this beer was ok. This wasn't as pronounced with its flavors, and seemed somewhat muddy. The bite from the carbonation was nice and the body was good. However, in the end I wouldn't buy this again."
"Flag Porter has a nice dark brown colour with a very good foamy head and lacing. It has a nice roasty malt smell with some chocolate in there. The flavour is malty with some coffee notes and a hint of charcoal in the aftertaste. This beer is creamy and thick like a milkshake. This is a really exceptional beer. It greatly exceeded my expectations."
"Head gets to near two fingers of deep tan foam, mostly larger bubbles with a steady dissolve, more stick to the fat lacing than thus expected. Very dark brown liquid yet not quite black, you get a wide band of orange at the glass's bottom. The nose at first makes you think it will be softer and sweeter than it finally ends up, wiry length to the rum raisin to coffee ice cream, molasses crisp and caramel popcorn, more concentration than sugar to the fig, black grape, blackberry fruit scents, more pastry flakes than bread, still touch of wheaties or bran cereal. Medium-bodied, muscular mouth presence with tight carbonation which nevertheless guides the whole from start through the finish. Goes low on the roast and toast, more scone, buttered biscuit, granola with distinct hoppy pep. If anything, there is a semi-burnt edge which plays off the sweetness of the caramel, coffee, chocolate powder, peanut brittle notes. The date, golden raisin, fig joins fresher cherry, apricot flavors. Dry, malty finish, flavors knit together and lift off the palate. Maddeningly easy to take sip after sip. That is, if you treat it is an English porter and not to be understood in the American idiom."
"D - I will drink this anywhere, anytime. I can't believe this was not previously on my radar."
"Drinkability: An infinitely drinkable porter that seems to conform very well to the historical description of the mixed beer style. Not sure if this is available locally, but I would certainly revisit it."
"D: Tasty, low alcohol it would make for a nice session porter. English Porters have really been impressing me as of late, and this is another good one."
"Smooth and decent but there's much better porters. I'd keep this one cold too, everything about it seems to weaken as it gets warmer."
"Bottle. Grabbed this on a whim after seeing it in the cooler. Pours a lighter brown color with a nice slightly tan head. The nose reminds me of light roast coffee and almost chocolate or fudge and maybe some caramel. The taste is subdued and easy. Smooth with any real bite at all only a slight bite of bitter in the end. I was hoping for something more like New Glarus Olde English Porter so it is kind of a let down in that respect but this is a very easy drinking porter. Very different compared to todays porters. The mouthfeel is pretty light."
"Nicely drinkable with a soft roasted aftertaste."
"Clear dark coffee brown with a slight filmy tan cap. Dark fruit, coffee and faint notes of charred oak and herbal hops in the nose. Raisin and molasses with mild roasty malt flavors, pretty spot on for an English porter. The body is on the lighter side of medium. The beer doesn't really live up to the cool story on the bottle but is a nice English session beer."
"thin body and low abv make for a very sessionable beer. would be a great default option at the beer store if it weren't for the high import price."
"D- as with most English beers I've tried, it was a very sessionable easy drinker"
"Poured into a Sam Adams glass. Pour deep dark mahogany with tan head that disap[ated quickly and minimal lacing. Malty aroma. Great taste with hints of chocolate. Very smooth and inviting beer. Really enjoyed the history behind this brew and enjoyed drinking it too."
"D - you could easily drink this all night. The flavor is a little mild, but good enough to keep you reaching for another."
"HV"
"taste is great. rich thick creamy chocolate milk with some mild fruitiness and a soothing sweetness"
"Pours a deep brown color with bright highlights when held to the light and a small light brown head. Milk chocolate sweetness, mild notes of coffee bitterness and an ashy texture. Light/medium in body, malt forward but not chewy enough for my taste in the style. A sharp but easy drinking porter."
"Either way, you are comfortable, and that is the biggest impression I took from this beer. It has easy, good solid aromas and a smooth palate, with no rough edges. Easily a crowd pleaser."
"Pours a near black color with some brown highlights around the edges, small yet dense khaki colored head that settled into a light ring. The aroma is almost non-existent, I pick up some light caramel and buttery notes. The taste has a very mellow roast flavor, with a hint of honey or caramel sweetness. A touch of lemon in the end. Nothing very exciting in the flavor department but no odd flavors either. The feel is thick and chewy with soft carbonation, has a silky feel. A neutral porter in terms of flavor, not much going on but it seems to be well made. Nice thick body, no odd flavors, mellow."
"I had this from a bottle, it poured dark brown with very light lacing. The smell was chocolate and coffee slightly burnt. I enjoyed the taste but it was a lot lighter than I expected. I had high expectations for this one based on the reviews I'd read and was let down. That said if I'd tried it with no expectations I wouldn't have anything bad to say. A good beer and one I'll have again, but I wouldn't go out in the rain for one."
"Served @ 45 degress (a bit cold) as the temp rose some of the more enjoyable characteristics came on stronger. The nose was the best part of the beer. Worth a try."
"m&d: crisp mouth, light to medium bodied. drinkable but better porters available"
"Good drink. Not exceptional for the style, but its pleasant and a few wont do no harm."
"Overall, I had no problem drinking this one, but it is a mid-range porter at best. Worth a try, but not worth killing yourself to find or selling the kids to get in a trade."
"Conclusion: Damn good example of an English porter, and the historicity of it is cool as well. I wish I could find this a lot more readily. This goes down with Black Cat Mild and St. Peter's Old-Style Porter as some of my absoltue favorite quaffable dark brews. Give me this beer over an Irish Dry Stout any day!"
"Poured a dark brown with an moderate head with that quickly reduced to a bare collar. The aroma was vinegar, like a wine that had turned, with a slight malty sweetness in the background. The taste was not sour at all, but the choco-coffee was pretty mild. Feel was light bodied and oily, with little carbonation. Drinkability was good. This was a nice, safe porter, unwilling to offend anyone, but reluctant to impress anyone either."
"Drinkability: it's not a bad beer, but really its flavor is just not my cup of tea, which impacts its drinkability."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent sessionable porter that is worth drinking for a while if you're in the mood for the style."
"12oz bottle. Pours very dark brown with a fluffy, light beige head that recedes to leave good lacing. Dark chocolaty malt smell with the typical porter yeast signature. Light molasses with some metallic notes. Tastes of toasty malt with more chocolate and molasses. Dry finish. Medium-full body. Decent porter."
"Very drinkable. I really liked this and it grew on me."
"Only a 5%er so this could be a great session brew if it had a little more umph of coffee and a smidgin more of suds."
"D: easily sessionable if this is your style of choice. I can see friends downing several pints with fish & chips. I just prefer something a little more strongly flavored. As is, I get the impression it's trying to mate the floral smell and fizzy feel of a pilsner to a darker beer, and it just doesn't work for me."
"A decent porter no doubt."
"D: The promising nose didn't hold the rest of the experience together. A bit too much of a light stout for my tastes. The acidity detracted from the experience."
"M/D - very smooth and creamy, a very nice porter that i would definitely go back for again."
"Dark brown with tan one finger head and some lacings. Aroma is molasses. Taste is brown sugar and bitter hops. Some cocoa malt. Mouthfeel is full with good carbonation. Some leather and molasses in the finish. Sessionable and quite good. Nice smooth bitter finish."
"I picked up a single bottle from my local co-op, but I will go back and get a six-pack in the future. A very solid, drinkable, and enjoyable porter."
"This pours a rich dark mahogany, with hints of red around the edges. The caramel colored head dissapears quickly. A malty, biscutty aroma gives way to alcohol bite though it is not reflected in the flavor. It starts with a strong malt character then moves to subtle hop bite, finishing with soft chocolate notes. Always seems a little flat on the tongue, but a nice easy drinker. My last bottle, and i'll be sorry to see it go."
"Very nice, compelling porter. Definitely not too strong, but tastes stronger than it is. Flavor is so mesmerizing that I could plow through a bunch of these. I am truly impressed and surprised. I've had some good English beers, but usually I am not so smitten by them as I am by this one."
"This is a nice smooth, creamy porter that pours a pretty inky dark color with a decent tannish head that retains and laces just a bit. The aroma is sweet malt, caramel, some chocolate notes, and some coffee hints as well. The taste is quite sweet, caramel, chocolatey, there is a roasted texture to the beer, and there is also some charred flavors near the finish. Overall, the beer is quite sweet, has a slightly tart caramel and butterscotch flavor. This is a decent porter. There is enough hop presence to give the beer a bit of a bittering balance, but not so much as to take away from the sweetish caramel flavors in the backbone of the beer. A good beer, worth seeking out."
"Poured a blackish-brown body with a two-finger head that receeded quickly and left some lace patches. A mild sweet malt smell mixed with some coffee or dry malt. A really smooth and creamy porter, with roasted (and possibly coffee) malts mixing with dark, maybe unsweetened chocolate and possibly other sweet malts (caramel?). There is a very minor hop presence that perks the beer up so it isn't a syrupy mess, and it does go down with only a mild drying sensation and rather smooth. A rather mild porter but one I really enjoyed."
"The taste is light but flavourful with toast, chocolate, leaves, and light toasty-earthiness. It's very clean. It lacks the lightly sour stewed fruit or tart quality that many porters and the like have or a licorice-herbal-pepper quality others have. It is light but somewhat silky in feel."
"Wine Specialist/11.7 oz bottle/$2.35"
"Overall I recommend this lighter bodied porter as a good example of an English Porter."
"Drinkability: Really the defining quality of this beer. almost perfect. - so easy to finish a bottle and then miss the taste 10 minutes later."
"Well at the price this cost for a four pack, I would never buy it, but I just bought a single and it was worth a try. The smell reminded me a lot of the Anchor Porter so I got pretty excited but the flavor isn't quite up to par. However, it is kind of cool to be drinking a beer made with some yeast harvested off an 1825 shipwreck."
"Slainte."
"D: This is a pretty drinkable beer. I'm not huge on porters, but this one is a decent brew."
"Bottle from City Wide in South Bend. Pours dark brown and clearish. A little ring of an off white head. Sweet chocolate malty odor. Smooth, slightly sweet chocolate, with vague fruity truffle flavor. Some alcohol. Smooth, kind of thin mouthfeel, but well-balanced. Close to a blatic porter...very smooth with a fruity tinge."
"D: Very easy to drink. Could easily spend an afternoon with a few of these."
"Body is medium, lightly carbionated, very creamy and slick. Overall very mild, tastey, and approachable."
"Kind of a chalky dryness accompanies a thin mouthfeel, making for a very quaffable beverage. It drinks like water. Need I say more?"
"Smells of sweet, Belgian chocolate at first. Unfortunately, cardboard creeps out as it warms and knocks this down a notch. Otherwise, it's highly drinkable. It appears brown with an off-tan head. The flavor has a touch of herbal hops with the Belgian chocolate and chocolate grains. A tasty beer, I wish I could get it fresh."
"Drinkability: Goes down smooth, but there isn't much going on here. As I won this on a football wage, I'm not out anything, but I would not pick this beer up on my own."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was black with a thin head that dissipated so fast I could not tell what color it was. The smell of the beer was sweet. The taste was old, flat and not good as in OLD. What a shame. Very out of date tasting yet my importer just got this one in, so I guess this is what the beer is like. I will not buy again."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Light bodied profile. Carbonation is okay, but not great. It's decently smooth, but its bland taste limits drinkability. Overall, it's okay but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"Drinkability: I paid $3 for the bottle, but I'm not sure if I'd do it again because it goes down so damn easily. I'd be getting 6-packs if it were cheaper. An interesting and extremely drinkable rendition of the style for sure."
"drinkability - Pretty good, easy drinking beer. Would buy again."
"Promising in aroma, but reserved in flavor and thin in texture makes for a disappointment. Not an English Porter that I'll return to."
"Nicely carbonated and smooth, one could order a few of these without blinking an eye. Truly excellent and, with a better nose, would be ranked even higher."
"D - A masterpiece for my taste, a top notch porter, world class, sessionable and supremely drinkable."
"Pours very dark brown that you can barely see through, even though it is clear. Minimal tan head in my snifter. Nose is very nice. Thick chocolate. Not cocoa powder or beans, but more like a chocolate bar. Flavor is as you would expect from the nose. Nice thick malty tones. Pronounced bitter tone stays firm. For staying power, this one keeps a good score. Feel is thin though on the liquid side. A lot less than you would think, but the carbonation is good. This is a very good English Porter. Definitely worth trying, though I would absolutely love to try an extremely fresh sample of this."
"D - I could see having a few of these on a regular basis. Very nicely done, there are just a few odd aromas and tastes that keep this from hitting higher, perhaps I just have to get used to them and try another. Give it a shot."
"This beer pours a midnight black color, with a slight amber hue around the edges when held up to the light. There is zero head when pouring, only slight foam that sits on top of the beer from the bottle. The smell is big and delicious, with many roasty flavors reminiscent of other porters. The taste is pretty unimpressive for the first half of the mouth, but as it sits on the tongue it develops with a thick chocolaty consistency with a sweet malt kick. Successive sips are still impressed by the size of this beer, and it seems there are new flavors each time. Well worth seeking out."
"Pours very smooth dark brown, light tan head that quickly dissipates to a spotty lacing. Slight sweet, malty warm smell. The robust taste I am accustomed to with porters was not present here. It is a bit lighter and lacks the full bodied flavor I expected. The beer is very easy to drink, low carbonation, low alcohol lever. The taste that you are left with is a warm nutty malt taste."
"D: Easy drinker for sureIm sure very quaffable even with the dark complexity. Not that complex of a beer which does diminish the desirability factor for me."
"A very nice evenly balanced porter. Very dark borwn in color, almost completely opaque. Minimal head, nice dark cocoa, coffee, complex smell... Taste even better, cocoa, coffee, char, toast, toffee, can't describe all the complexity. Low carbonation.. a good thing. Very nice all-around porter... not too dry, but with enough hop to let you know it's there. Kitchy description on bottle, but well-worth the try. One of the better porters I've had."
"Overall a very pleasant, smooth, drinkable beer. I'll be picking this one up again."
"This has the characteristics of a classic English Porter, meeting the requirements of the style very well. Nice example of the style!"
"Heard about this one from a friend and knew I had to taste it. What can I say, I'm a sucker for cool stories and neat packaging. Poured into a pint glass, this one had just a little head which slowly vanished. The beer is thick and dark, it looks quite a bit like espresso in the glass, with bits of the legendary salvaged yeast floating throughout. Smell is very smooth, coffee and cocoa, I can't wait to taste it. Taste follows smell amazingly well, still coffee and cocoa, just more prominent and rich. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and silky, without being oily at all. Drinkability is very good, only suffering the slightest bit from the richness. This may become a mainstay in my fridge yet."
"drinkability is medium range. this one is moderately drinkable, but houses flavors that do not agree with all palates. still, this one is a great example of an english porter."
"***Note: I am reviewing this again under Elgood's Flag Porter 1825 Original (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/3049/7282) because even though my bottle says Darwin brewery, this beer based on description and the picture is exactly the same. What is the difference between these two?"
"This IS an EXCEPTIONAL beer. The perfect balance between body, flavor, texture, and etc. For a porter that is. There's a nice roasty, malty, chocolatey, ever so slightly hoppiness. A chuggability too. Color is strangely either a hazy brown with some reddish overtones or a dark cherry brown with brown overtones. Ok, just shoot me. whatever. Want to try this beer warmer."
"Overall: Plenty of contrasting flavors, mixing together without fighting in the mouth, light carbonation, medium body. An all-around great beer."
"Overall: A decent though hardly exemplary porter. Im not sure that yeast from an 1825 shipwreck really makes a difference. Worth a try."
"Overall, Darwin's Original Flag is still a decent beer that would no doubt be much more worthy when served off a fresh tap."
"Overall, this is a decent porter, even if the yeast strain is somewhat of a novelty. It's a solid porter, it fits the style well."
"D- A nice porter the more porters I try the more and more I like the style. Would be nice on a cool night"
"Poured a deep dark brown, nice opagueness, but still some light through on the sides and bottom. Nice short lived off white head with decent lace and audible carbonation. Smell was a decent english average porter. Caramel sugar and roasted malts were really the most notable aromas. The taste was smooth, crisp, a tad watery with the caramel being mellowed somewhat by a nice albeit small hoppy back. Overall this was a nice light sessionable porter. Could really throw down a few of these and the light caliber went well with dinner. Not really a late night sipper, but not a bad ballgame beer."
"Drinkability: Very good porter. Well balanced. I would definately consider this to rank very high on my porter list."
"D- Not for the faint of hearts, excellent example of a porter. I wouldn't recommend as an everyday but definitely as a treat of something special!"
"Opinion: This is a pretty good British Porter. I like the clean flavor and light mouthfeel making it a good session beer. The fact that the yeast survived since 1825 to give birth to this beer is pretty cool and makes it all the better. I think I like Fullers London Porter better because it has more depth of flavor, but I would certainly drink this beer again."
"i hope to be able to revise my review after i drink my other bottle, but as it stands, this is undrinkable, and nowhere near worth the money."
"Mouthfeel was thin, yet there was some sparkling carbonation in the mouth. The history of this one is far more interesting than the actual beer."
"Drinkability: The beer is very drinkable and at 5% I'm sure I could drink a few of these. The taste just isn't anything spectacular and I was hoping for more."
"D: This wound up being a pretty good one. It doesn't have much bitterness--even in the chocolate that it features--but it's a smooth, drinkable porter."
"D: Easy to drink, but I'd probably opt for a better porter to make a session out of it."
"Medium-bodied, very easy to drink as a session beer, but still missing out some power on that taste. I really can't feel all the stuff the previous reviewers mentioned. Acceptable, but there are lots of better porters out there."
"Truly a superior beer."
"wow. pours a dark brown color with an inch of head. smells of roasted caramels, and a bit of vanilla. Roasted caramel came through on the palate, with more of a chocolately feel. Very balanced (abv 5%) with just a slight bitterness on the finish. Smooth and dry made this incredibly drinkable. Good session beer. Four pack did me well tonight."
"Served in a pint glass, Original Flag Porter pours brown with a small tan head which goes away quickly. It smells like roasted malt, smoke, chocolate and caramel. Overall the aroma is nice and sweet. It tastes the same way to me, except that there's a dark fruit taste in the beer too. Not a strong aftertaste either. The mouthfeel is thinner than I expected, but it's very smooth and a little slick. Drinkability is pretty high, I could easily have this as a session beer. I think this is pretty good, I'd recommend it to anyone to try."
"I bought a 4 pack thinking i might have one or two... I was wrong. back to the store. a nice session beer to enjoy with friends."
"Recommended drinking for porter drinkers."
"The beer poured a dark mahogany with a bit of a tan head. The aroma was of dark sweet malt and dark fruits. The taste was a very delicate smokieness that was followed by a smooth mix of sweet malt and dark fruit, quite a surprise. Mainly because I would never have conceived of such a combination. The feel is smooth and dry. This is an exceptionaly drinkable beer. It has a wonderful balance of smokieness and sweetness that delivers a beer that answers to both desires. This is definately one that will show back up in my supply."
"It is, however drinkable. The beer doesn't have any negative attributes, and has quite a few positive ones. It just doesn't all come together. Although the thought of harvesting yeast off a sunken ship is pretty damn cool!"
"D - Outstanding. This is just above water in terms of refreshment. I finished this before I finished my review, which is a rarity when I do them simultaneously. Honestly, if a local bar served this, I could drink a pint of this every day with my dinner. Since porters don't rank high on my list of favorite styles, that is quite a statement. It is really an everyday dort of beer. The price here isn't bad, so I imagine England is much better off. I wouldn't say it is the greatest thing"
"This one is a dark, nearly black beer with a notably tan head. When held to the light, a deep amber color works its way through the liquid. The aroma is fairly intense: lots of chocolate and roasted malts. Not much in the way of very highly roasted, black patent style aroma though. Instead, the smell is mostly sweet and malty, with a decidedly chocolate base. The taste is similar, with a lot of sweetness, caramel, and fruit. Plums come out right away. Again, chocolate is prominent in the taste. The finish is sweet as well. I thought that a little more hops wouldnt have hurt the balance on this one. The body is a little light, which made the beer more drinkable than I first thought it would have been. All in all, this one is interesting, but not the type of Porter that Id seek out."
"the flavor is dark malts, little roasted, chocolate, malt, its a little dry, it could also have a little more body, but over all a good porter, just a little expencive."
"Pours dark and certainly porter-like, but no head. Lots of chocolateon the nose, almost smells like a Yoo Hoo. The taste delivers deep roasted chocolate, with a mils dissapearing finish. Drinks clean, but with a slight smokey, over-roasted (burrnt) flavor to it."
"Drinks okay, but nothing special as porters go"
"The mouth feels just bit too thin for me. This is an ok porter but I really wont look for it when the porter thirst strikes me."
"Dark coloured body capped with snow white head. Bits of bubbly foam form over and assemble to the appereance of constalations. Body shines a ruby colour up to the light. A chocolaty sweet aroma. Maybe some vanilla in there too? Very agreeable aroma. A bit of chestnut in the flavour as well. I still claim to get some vanilla! The yeast works in there well, lending this some likeability. As a whole though, these flavours fall rather short of anything great. No dimension in terms of 'roastness'. Flavour seems to skip out on some sips. I enjoyed drinking this beer just fine, but as far as reviewing it... it just seemed inconsistent, mild and passive. Came across as being a little too commercial for 'authentic, traditional', real-deal English porter."
"It's a tough one to qualify because I do like it but I wouldn't think of it as a porter."
"Overall, if you have the opportunity, I highly recommend this one. It would be nice on a cold winter night."
"Although not my favorite style the beer was well made and fit the profile of a good porter. This beer might have been a bit past its prime"
"Notes: Not something I'll go out of my way for, or for that matter pay the high price compared to brews made locally. Plenty of good porters stateside with good prices...Damn fine beer, just not going to be in my stable again soon."
"D- yes it was thin, but i have to say i enjoyed the hell out of this brew. I wouldnt session this, its too good for that. This i would consider a great kick back relax and enjoy beer."
"Flavor was smooth and creamy with waves of chocolate and coffee. Finished cleaner than expected, and not taken over with the bitterness like a bunch of the American rivals. Made this one come off as creamier and more drinkable."
"Overall a great porter. This could definitely be a session beer, it's so smooth and well-balanced."
"Overall i am starting to think i might have a bad bottle. i've had one of these about a year ago, but i remember liking it. It doenst taste bad, so i am still reviewing it and will get another bottle of it sometime and re-review it if i think things have changed."
"This one was a muddy dark brown with just a ring of off-white bubbles. The nose straight-up smells like yoo-hoo. The taste is a swirl of nut, toffee, slight coffee and hints of choclate, with a backbone of muted, earthy, bittering hops. I suppose this is a more traditional/ authentic approach to porter but I'm not so into it. Mouthfeel was thin and watery. This a decent, drinkable, way overpriced beer."
"First time drinking this beer. I'm thoroughly impressed. Good aromas of chocolate, coffee, barley malts, and roasted malts. A hint of fermentation sourness adds to the complexity. Looks nearly black with a slight tan foamstand that stayed til the end. Tastes full and round with the chocolate, coffee, toffee, caramel, and a hint of cream. Never aggressive not dominant in any flavor. Melded together nicely. Quite rich and smooth on the toung. Easy drinking. Quite silky and bold. I highly recommend."
"Smooth and clean mouthfeel makes for a great beer."
"Drinkability: This one is all about the chocolate malt, yet its still well-balanced. A really nice surprise from a beer I had never seen or heard of before."
"One nice porter, hands down. I can't recall why this is a beer in the news, but regardless, this was a crowd favorite at the discussion tent at the World Beer Festival. Many asked for seconds and I had to agree with them. Darker than others in this style, nice malty chocolate with a hint of hoppiness. I would love to try this one again soon but unsure where to find it."
"Drinkability: All in all, despite its flaws, a very drinkable porter"
"Medium bodied, smooth, almost creamy after the carbonation drops away. A lingering smoky maltiness and molasses. Yummy! ""Thank you, kind publican, may I have another?"""
"This makes a nice dessert beer. I would find it tough toi drink several of this rich brews."
"This has always been a favorite English Porter; of course, you need to find it. My bottle has a weak, quick dissolving head, but holds a smell a bit rendolent of molasses. A very dark color and rich bodied beer, this beer (supposedly) is brewed with yeast brought up from a shipwreck. Urban legend or not, this is a great quaff that must be drank at room temperature."
"Drinkability- I'f I can find it again, I'll probably snag a few more. I think it was about $2.75 per, but worth it."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: A solid beer, nothing to write home about. The history behind the beer is more interesting than the beer itself in my opinion."
"Medium bodied, and smooth, rather nice - it's brewed to an 1800s recipe with a yeast recovered from an 1825 shipwreck."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich and creamy black and chocolate malt scent. It is sweet with a bit of a dry finish. The taste is good as well. It has a black and earthy flavor with a sweet, creamy chocolate malt finish. It's thin, but a very flavorful beer that drinks well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine porter. I love the chocolate characteristics. It has a great aroma and taste; a good drinker."
"ps - after posting this I only just now read the previous review, by Yoko. We had almost exactly the same experience of this beer (and wrote about it the same way). Pleasantly surprised that so many of my perceptions of this or any other brew have a common ground with others'."
"This came highly recommended. I can appreciate why it was enjoyed by another, however, this is not my preferred porter style."
"Good tasty Porter. Smooth and drinkable."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin, Id prefer a bit thicker feel on the tongue. There is something in the taste, maybe a lack of hops which bring the sweetness in balance which hurts drinkability a bit, but good overall. Worth a try for sure and Ill probably pick up a couple more."
"Although I normally prefer (often big) American porters to (often not so big) English ones, I wouldn't change a single thing about Old Flag. It's a classic version and is great beer no matter what flag you drink under."
"This is pretty good stuff. I'd like a little more flavor and bitterness from hops and/or roasted grain."
"a very solid porter, nothing outrageous but very solid."
"Dark brown almost black in color with a minimal light brown head that reduces to just a ring. The aroma is chocolatey, and roasty, with coffee notes. The flavor is of roasted malts and coffee notes. It is medium in body and an easy drinker. Not a bad Porter overall."
"Pours a deep brown with ruby highlights thru out almost no head to speak of here,great aroma of cocoa,smoke,and dark roasted coffee very rich and appetizing.Taste does not live up to the aroma though somewhat watery but there some smokey flavors and some bitter chocolate.Like I said the beer seemed a little to watery thinbut there are some good characteristics for a quality brew going on."
"Could I please try this fresh from a just-tapped cask? I can only imagine though this beer survives travel fairly well."
"Smoky with sweet malty character bursting on the tongue; little to no hops which leaves you free to enjoy the malts which linger. Good, not great."
"Silky, rather than syrupy, on the tongue. Light yet flavorful, this traditional porter is clear in its influence on its contemporaries. Roasted, smoky flavors. Singed chocolate and grilled fruit concentrated and rehydrated. Remarkably delicate and well balanced. Just easy, good, flavorful drinking."
"Absolutely beautiful. Gorgeous, velvety, feminine perfumes of baked blue fruits and Caribbean chocolate. On the palate it is rain water clear with chunky, meaty suggestions of marrow, roasted seeds, blackberry paste, bitter chocolate, smoky branches and creosote. Much lighter than modern Porter convention would have it, there is something profoundly drinkable about this brew. Very complex, succulent and interesting. The best Porter ever."
"Taste combines a slightly dry malt flavor with an almost brown-sugar sweetness. Its not as dry toast bitter as I expected, but its really a nice, filling sensation. However, the sweetness accumulates and makes it necessary for some water."
"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights when held to the light. Small tan head quickly disappears but some lace is left along the sides of the glass. Roasted aroma with dark chocolate and rum. Flavor is dominated but raosted malt, dark chocolate and coffee. Hints of dark fruit and molasses are also present. Hops are not noticable and the bitterness is provided by roasted grain. Thinner then expected and smooth. Nice drinkability, nothing heavy to stop you from having a few. A solid porter."
"This is a nice porter. Not as heavy as some. Pours a limited head that leaves quickly. Even so there is a bit of lacing. Very dark amber. Chocolate smell. I didn't notise the alcohole. The flavor is chocolate with the light tar expected from English porters. Not heavy on the tongue move like a lager then a porter. Usually I drink a porter for favor and approach it like food. This porter is actually refreshing. This is worth a try."
"It poured dark dark ruby black with a small tan head. Got a good whiff of a woody and smokey odor. My first reaction is this brew is not nearly as heavy as I expected. Its very smooth with typical porter flavor punctuated by an almost fruity aspect. The finish is very sweet and sugary. It's ok, although I would say it tastes like a borderline porter."
"Pours out very dark and lovely. Nearly opaque black with faint red highlights when held up to the light. Aroma is medicinal/alcoholic, roasty and fruity. Taste is very complex with dry roasted malt as the primary profile with hints of coffee, smoke, raisin, chocolate, black pepper, and licorice. Lactic acid like sourness also adds to the complexity. A bit thicker than most other ordinary porters Ive tried. The complexity makes the drinkability suffer a bit. Makes a fine sipping beer to wind down the night."
"Poured a dark brown with ruby tints. Not too much head just some bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. Smelled sweet with plenty of molassas and brown sugar. Taste was more heavily coffee flavored with tasty sweetness and a doughy finish. Thin mouthfeel without much carbonation. All in all a tasty beer."
"Brewery website has an interesting story about the recovery, analysis, and development of this Porter's recipe, and the 1825 shipwrecked barge from which they got the yeast strain."
"Poured a very dark brown with a reddish tinge. Head was small, tan and didn't hang around for a while. Lacing was moderate, with a nice collar of foam visible throughout this beer's time in my glass. Smell was of roasted malt, similar to dark chocolate with subtle cherry notes. Taste was of dark, rich, velvety chocolate with fruity notes hovering in the background. The mouthfeel is pleasingly thick. This beer has a filling, stick-to-yer-ribs effect, and would be great paired up with a nice dessert. This same richness works against it in drinkability, as its a little to heavy for repeated pints. All in all a nice porter."
