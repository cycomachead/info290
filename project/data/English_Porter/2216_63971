I'm not sure this beer is totally successful, but it is unique, so credit it for that. sort of lost in the middle, not quite a sour, not quite a dark ale, it gets caught out in no mans land a bit, but i like it anyway.","StonedTrippin","0"

The lightly tart fruit flavors are an odd mix with the more roasted/cocoa malt flavors...it tastes a little disjointed. I also think the body is a bit thin thanks to the higher levels of carbonation.

3.83,-0.3,4,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours pitch black, opaque in the glass with a nice two finger light brown head with great retention and thick lacing. Aroma of toasted malt, Belgian yeast, cinnamon, light sweet and sour dark fruit; porter meets Belgain double. Flavor starts with semi-sweet toasted malt, Belgian yeast, hints of cocoa, then quickly develops a more sour dark malt, finishing tart and somewhat vinous with a light metallic flavor. Medium bodied with fresh active carbonation. An interesting and unusually flavored dark malt beer, smelling and beginning like a porter, but quickly showing its wild yeast and light Belgian character. In a blind taste, I might suspect a compromised porter or stout, except in this case the finishing sourness is intentional. Taken from that perspective, an interesting and well made dark ale that works well. I'm not expecting the the tart finish and this style does not appeal to me as much as a traditional porter. Sour fans who also enjoy dark malt should take this for a spin. Interesting but not my style.","LiquidAmber","Feb 28, 2014"

3.92,2.1,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"The bottle shop got this in yesterday and I couldn't resist a try. Claims to be unusual. It is. Pours black with a thick tan head that leaves a coating of lacing down the glass, much like a Guinness Draught. The aroma contains chocolate, sweet malt, faint fruits and sourness. Similar taste with some bright fruitiness, a building, sour lactic backbone and a long bitter sour raisiny finish. The sourness is mild. The mouthfeel is thin but slightly creamy due to the head - again, like a Guinness Draught. This is an easy drinking and enjoyable beer. Tastes more like a porter with some sourness rather than a wild ale. Enjoyable. A bit expensive, but a worthwhile experience. Wouldn't mind drinking it again but not in a rush to buy more.","brianmandell","Feb 07, 2014"

A sticky lace lines the sides of the glass. Smells of tart cherry, toasted grains, and a bit of smoke and mild chocolate. The tart smell is pretty overpowering. Upfront taste of cocoa nibs, a bit of smoke in the middle, with a strong tart finish. Beer is full-bodied and well carbonated. This style is a new one for me. I have had both porters and sour ales, but never a combo of the two. Interesting beer nonetheless.","brian44556","Nov 25, 2013"

Was too curious to wait and tasted it the very day purchased, at the brewery, fridged briefly to cellar temp. and served in a tulip. Poured coffee-like, not that leggy but mahogany dark, with a pinkie of densely packed,custard-colored head. Roasted coffee aromas, along wish toast, anise, cinnamon and maybe mint or some sweet herb, some cherry, a bit of yeast and cellar but not pronounced in any on those notes. I didn't have a strong mental image on what to expect, taste-wise, but my expectation was of a cidery-fruity sour attack with a swartbier sweetness coming through. It turned out more the reverse. I get a roasty, porter-like first impression with good sarsaparilla, vanilla, clove, pepper swirling around, and then some lactic sourness bleeds in, becoming more and more pronounced as it lingers, into a more sour and woody aftertaste. Mouthfeel was not a mouthful, a bit thin, soapy, just a gentle lap of carbonation to give it some presence. It's complex, odd, something to wrestle with before I decide whether to embrace it. I'm glad in have a second bottle for another taste, but not now.","ManforallSaisons","Sep 05, 2013"

Poured dark brown with a one finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, milk chocolate, roasted malt, earth, and subtle funk. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. When I saw the description of this one on the menu, I really didn’t know what to expect if I am completely honest. However, what I found was actually quite nice. It had all of the aspects of a nice porter going on in it with just a kiss of funk to make it interesting.

Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, sweet and tart fruit, and some molasses. It tastes similar to how it smells, like roasted malt, chocolate, tart and sweet dark fruit (plums, cherries, raisins), and a bit of nuts and red wine. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and easy to drink. This definitely isn't a traditional porter!

3.85,0.3,4,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Zwet looks really dark in the glass boasting a dark brown bordering on black color. The firm cap of foam is dark tan with some strength and firmness leaving some notches on the way down. Smell is roasty with some nuts and some brett from the addition. Old world porter quality in taste with English appeal with some brett backing it. Not entirely funky, this is a nicely mixed drink. Nutts with roasted malt with some coffee flavor within. Feel is at about medium with a long lasting finish. It's carbed up nice and I would have no problem taking down a glass or two of it, yet I would not go out of my way to get it.","BARFLYB","0"
3.88,1,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,4,"On tap at the Trappist. Pours a dark brown, almost black with a two finger tan head that stays a long time and leaves huge streaks of lacing on the glass. This beer was served relatively cold and changed a lot as it warmed up. The aroma was some light roastiness, a bit of coffee, some lactic notes, barnyard funk, and some light lemon. The funky notes and non traditional porter aromas came out more as it warmed up. The taste is some dark roasted coffee, followed by some light lemon zest, a bit of orange peel, some brett funkiness, a bit of cherry, and some lactic tartness on the finish. Again the roasted flavors were more dominant when it was colder, with the other flavors coming to the forefront as it warmed up. Medium-full bodied. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy. Medium carbonation. Not sour, but slightly tart. I enjoyed this. It got significantly better as it warmed up.","jethrodium","Oct 09, 2011"
3.78,-1.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Black pour with a light brown head, retention and lacing are great. The smell is of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts with a backend of funk. More porter than sour, the beer has a roasty coffee finish. Funk is noticed throughout, but does not dominate the beer. Medium to heavy in body, sort of a strange aftertaste. Interesting to try, wouldn't get it again though.","russwbeck","Oct 07, 2011"
3.72,-3.1,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Pours a charcoal and dark brown color with little head. Mild scent of heavy roasted coffee, light chocolate and dark bread crust combine with light fruit and mild tart and sour notes. Taste is mild and light with the tart sourness covering up much of the roast profile. Lighter side of medium bodied and light in carbonation, quite dry. The experiment is appreciated but the execution is lacking.","rfgetz","Oct 02, 2011"
4.12,7.3,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Most of the dark barrel aged beers I've had have covered up the barrel's flavors. This beer is very barrely tasting. Some serious vinous oak going on in the nose. Tastes a little bit like brett and coffee, but they do a pretty darn good job of merging the two worlds. I enjoyed this one from start to fin.","musicman575","Oct 01, 2011"
4.3,12,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"I was quite impressed with this step outside of the box by Drie Fonteinen. Despite initially thinking a "Bretty" porter sounded excessive, I was really taken by this beer.","deapokid","Sep 27, 2011"
3.6,-6.3,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall: A bit weird. The flavors work for me, but I think something was missing. Don't know that I would have it again.","oline73","Sep 21, 2011"
4.2,9.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"D - Very drinkable. The balance of regular porter elements and the sour elements brought upon by the lambic yeast is really nice.","ngeunit1","Sep 19, 2011"
3.35,-12.8,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"O - This was different, but nothing that I necessarily cared for. Had my pour, moved onto other things.","AgentZero","Sep 18, 2011"
3.51,-8.6,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Overall: This beer is far from bad; however it just doesn't work for me. Maybe some time in the bottle could help.","Thehuntmaster","Sep 17, 2011"
3.58,-6.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Overall, this is a good porter, though, in my opinion, it falls short of Armand's other offerings. I preferred it to SN Exportation, but I think that SFTO still stands at the top of the sour porter style for me.","NittanyBeerFan","Sep 17, 2011"
3.56,-7.3,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The body is full and robust with sharp carbonation. Not bad but I think I've had porters I would take over this one.","Bendurgin","Sep 16, 2011"
3.58,-6.8,4,3.5,3.5,3,4,"O - Interesting beer. I would have liked a little more funk and a little more roastiness, but that's just personal preference. I would get again.","SMortiL987","Sep 13, 2011"
3.83,-0.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Poured into a tulip glass, a nice dark black-brown with a finger of creamy beige head that dwindled down to a ringlet, leaving lots of attractive, foamy lace behind. A little swirl of the glass would stir up a little whorl of bubbles on the top. Aroma of roasted malts and mild chocolate, yeast, and notes of citrus with a touch of funk. Taste started out like a typical porter: roasty, malty, touch of chocolate. The mouthfeel was much lighter though, and within a second or two it was obvious that something else was going on: tart cherries, lemon peel, and Belgian yeast obviously coming into play, and a bit of funk as implied in the aroma. But balanced... It wasn't like "Ooh a porter!, I can has malts!" then you take a sip and pucker your lips in revulsion. While the balance was there, I still felt this was a bit weak overall, thin and not as full-bodied as it seemed it should have been. Still mighty good though.","Rifugium","Sep 11, 2011"
4.07,6,3.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Fuller medium body, higher carbonation, tingly and dry on the palate. Very drinkable and flavorful, definitely an interesting take on the style by 3F which seems to work well.","xnicknj","Sep 10, 2011"
3.7,-3.6,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Black like ink with a good sized head and stringy lace. Big mocha aromas make up much of the nose; so far it smells like a "normal" porter. That changes in the taste; you guessed it, it's a sour porter. Mocha and cocoa notes are subtle, though the tartness is still mild. Still, fairly smooth and not very acidic. While it's not a world-beater, it does show that there's more to Drie Fonteinen than simply lambic.","DoubleJ","Sep 10, 2011"
3.61,-6,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A mildly soured cherry stout. It's not particularly drinkable or all that exciting, though it is more than decent.","ehammond1","Sep 06, 2011"
2.24,-41.7,4.5,3,1.5,2.5,2,"A very untraditional take on a very traditional style. I knew before ordering this that it would be a sour porter, but I still had a difficult time stomaching it. A rough go to say the least.","amphion1065","Sep 05, 2011"
3.68,-4.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"O: Maybe not what I was expecting from 3F, but I quite liked it.","Halcyondays","Sep 02, 2011"
3.88,1,4.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Overall I think it is a solid beer that I personally like more than the sum of its parts. Maybe it's that I find it to be a very interesting beer and that scores some points with me. I plan on ageing a couple of these, and I think we may have a completely different animal in a couple years.","thepeter","Aug 30, 2011"
3.75,-2.3,4,4,4,2.5,3.5,"O: Good stuff, I like the flavors and has potential to get better with age given its extremely high level of carbonation.","flannelman808","Aug 28, 2011"

3.5,-8.9,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Mild acidity with medium body and higher carbonation. Interesting at least, but only decent.","nickd717","Jun 02, 2011"
4.15,8.1,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Overall: Reading all the reviews, I expected a very average beer, with clear sourness in it. I have to say, the sourness is only slightly present, and mostly in the smell. Maybe it is because I am a geuze drinker, but this is more like a regular porter for me. Nice beer.","rvdoorn","Beers"
2.7,-29.7,4.5,2,3,3.5,2,"I understand the concept of a sour, Brett-inoculated Porter, but I don't think it's a marriage that was ever meant to take place. Non-intentionally metallic and intentionally sour = bad combo.","dasenebler","0"
4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Bottle: Poured a dark black color porter with a nice thick off-brown color head with great retention and some very good lacing. Aroma of funky yeast with light sour notes mix in with some roasted malt. Taste is a quite complex mix between some roasted malt with some sour notes and some funky yeast notes. Body is not too full with super great carbonation. Nothing close to a standard porter but a very nice beer nonetheless.","Phyl21ca","May 01, 2011"
3.05,-20.6,3.5,1,4,3,3.5,"D - Everything about this beer is pretty good, except one (horrendous) aspect of the nose.","ktrillionaire","Apr 24, 2011"
3.44,-10.4,4.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D - This started out alright, but got worse as time went out. I'm not certain this is a very successful experiment. I think I preferred Southampton Vic for similar approach to making an "infected" porter. I had no problem with 4-6oz of this, and it went down fairly quickly, but it's a very strange beer and definitely isn't for everyone.","MasterSki","Apr 09, 2011"

4,4.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice body, it went down like water. I liked this quite a bit but nowhere near as much as their world-class gueuze creations.","TurdFurgison","Mar 13, 2011"
2.98,-22.4,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"OVERALL: A porter in name only. For an infected porter, however, this one is actually alright. I enjoyed it much more than the other infected stouts I've had in the past year, such as infected Abyss, Sexual Chocolate, and Black Tot. To say that I enjoyed this would be going too far, but the mixed fermentation seems to have kept the sourness in control enough that I could certainly finish it without much issue. Not my style, but to be honest, it's done really well, and some people out there would probably love this.","Jeffo","Feb 12, 2011"
3.63,-5.5,4,3.5,3.5,4.5,3.5,"Yup... the only 3 fonteinen (so far). Sourness in beer is just not my thing. Putting that aside I think this a very good attempt to mix a porter and a sour beer. If the sour part doesn't scare you this might be very interesting for you.","doopiedoopiedoo","Dec 23, 2010"

3.88,1,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Black color/ fleeting tan head. Roasty malt, chocolate, dry hay, barnyard aromas. light to medium bodied. Mild chocolate, medium roast malt, earthy flavors with some drying barnyard hay to finish.","beerpirates","Nov 28, 2010"
