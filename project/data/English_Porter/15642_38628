The aroma is of roast, light chocolate, and some faint oxidation in the form of dark fruits. Taste is roasted malts into some vinous red wine and dark fruits. Appears to be a tad over the hill and off, but it still remains drinkable. Mouthfeel is creamy but the beer has a certain mineral quality which detracts quite a bit. Overall this is clearly a beer that gets ruined with age. This must have at least a year or so on it and oxidation is seeping in and messing with the delicate porter notes. Drink fresh!","davey101","May 01, 2013"

At first I thought the nose was coffee, but on second thought it's more clearly a clean roast with an earth spice coming out with the warmth. Strong malt with a roasty smokiness in the taste that's supported by a light but not thin body. Ends with a bitterness that lingers lightly. A very solid porter that pushes the style towards robust. In reading Flat Earth's description, Cygnus is made with rye malt, which explains the bite that I noticed but couldn't place. After I've had the straight Cygnus X-1 now, the differences overlaid in the S'mores infused Grand Design I took home at Christmas are clear. Cygnus is a slightly off centered porter that's fun and interesting to drink.","FightingEntropy","Beers"

Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a dark reddish brown with a minimal light tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, and a subtle spiciness. The flavor was of roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, subtle sweet malt, and a subtle pepper spiciness. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I was quite surprised by the pepper spiciness on the followthrough. This was a pleasant surprise by the way... The rest of the brew was okay, but nothing special. Glad I got the chance to give this one a shot, but doubt I would seek it out in the future.","thagr81us","Dec 13, 2011"

2.7,-28.8,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Thanks to brewnic for the extra. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a dimpled glass. The body is dark brown/black and atop it is a finger sized, tan head that fades slowly and is somewhat bubbly. So far so good. The aroma here is coffee, chocolate, tart dark fruits, low-key, but noticeably skunky hops and a generalized roast fragrance that leans toward bread and cereal grains rather than specifically malt. Roasty coffee and chocolate notes bloom in the fore and then segue into yet sweeter notes of fruit malt. This arrangement is pleasing, but there exists a metallic background to the whole affair that is distracting, from a flavor standpoint. While I wish that metal twang would go away, it was kind of a deal killer for me. The mouth feel is mostly where it should be for the style; full carbonation. I can't say I was impressed with this beer and wouldn't want it again though I respect the style.","CuriousMonk","Dec 20, 2010"

Nice, robust smell carries over into the flavor, which is similar but not as sweet. Black malts meld with a creamy iced coffee character. A porter through and through, not even remotely stout-like (this is an attribute I quite like, providing much needed separation between the styles). Very little roastiness or bitterness.

There's also a funny, slightly off flavor to the beer that I also tasted in Flat Earth's Angry Planet. It's not as strong here as it was there, but it's still an odd bit of background noise.

2.86,-24.5,4,3,2.5,3,3,"Poured a medium brown with an enormous head that slowly faded to a one fingered one. The aroma, while chilled, was vinegar, but as it warmed you could smell the chocolate. The taste too, was very sour, like vinegar cut with soda water. The flavor was helped by warming, but not a great deal, and remained somewhat sour. Feel was light bodied, even for a porter, with only a small amount of carbonation that survived the head. Drinkability was only fair. I had been looking forward to trying something from Flat Earth and was a little disappointed. I had thought that the contents had spoiled or been infected, but too many reviewers expressed similar experience with X-1. Oddly, a large number reported the opposite, a malty sweetness, so something wasn't quite right. Reasonably priced and not terrible, but I'd be reluctant to try again.","kegger22","Aug 15, 2009"

Like a raspberry tart porter. I thought it might have been a bad bottle, but then I saw others here experiencing the same. It's not really roasty or dry, more sweet.

Worth checking out.","prototypic","Apr 03, 2009"

Some smoke flavoring but very very thin for this type of beer. I wanted something to stand out and say....yeah. But that never happened. Drain pour..No. But I won't be purchasing another one in a very long time considering there are MANY more better porters out there and for less money. This beer tasted CHEAP. Like it was made at the old Pig's Eye brewery. Come on guys, you can do better. If you are going to use a classic rock band's song for a beer, please make a quality product. I am afraid RUSH wouldn't be proud. No endorements from them or from me for that matter.","schellsbeer","Mar 30, 2009"

Pours a dark ebony with some garnet highlites when held up to the light. Minimal head but fine lacing. Nose- light roast, dark chocolate. Taste- quite dry, surprisingly spicy for style, chocolate, medium fruitiness, nuts. Carbonation is a little high, and the finish is metallic. Drinkability is not too bad.","oakbluff","Jan 27, 2009"

Some scorched caramel and chocolate detectable, but mostly sour and woody. Taste is, as expected, overwhelmingly tart and sour. Overcarbonated and gushy, with unpleasant woody tartness.

Since it was such a surprise I am enjoying it quite a bit and I would love to try it on tap but it just was not what I would expect from a porter. I don't think I would reach for this one to warm me up on a cold night like the bottle suggests, but I will reach for again when I'm at the store. I wonder what a Flat Earth stout would be like?","optiontwo","Nov 10, 2008"

3.12,-17.7,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,3,"I bought this at Stimmel's in OH for $5.99 a month ago, never seen it for sale again before or since. The beer is dark reddish brown colored, clear but with low light transmission, with an enourmous poofy foam that takes forever to recede. The smell is good, and in fact is the strongest attribute in my opinion. Loads of roasted malt and chocolate. The taste has a surprising amount of sourness in it, so much that I suspect there's something wrong with my bottle (maybe the bottle wasn't disinfected properly before filling, the flavor seems similar to a homebrew problem I had once). Anyway I can still get some chocolate flavor out of if but the sourness makes it difficult to enjoy. I'll try this again if I see it in MN, hopefully from a different batch, and revise the review in case I had a bad bottle.","TurdFurgison","Oct 31, 2008"

I chilled it for a couple days in anticipation of an overflow but instead I just got a huge head on the first pour. Its a very dark brown with a fluffy, light brown head. It smells mostly of roasted grains and light chocolate malts but I get a slight bit of hoppiness and smoke on the tail end. The taste is really complex and well blended. Similar to the smell with a pronounced bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel was a little thin and this was definitely over carbonated but it seems like they are on the way to fixing that. This could easily be one of the best porters I've tried to date.","thickerfreakness","Apr 17, 2008"

Not particularly challenging, yet there is some depth to this brew, its just that in my opinion the overall experience would be enhanced with a slightly more robust porter character. Recommended for fans of porters and rye brews, and would serve quite nicely as an introduction to these types of beer. Almost sessionable, although the 6.5% ABV would catch up to the drinker sooner rather than later. That being said it would be pretty easy to drink this one all day and or night long.","demcorhip","Mar 27, 2008"

Dark brown and nearly opaque, it left decent lacing on the glass. Starts with a malty, roasty, chocolaty nose that leads into a roasted, toffee taste. It has an earthy bitterness with a slight smoked flavor. It finishes with a quite clean aftertaste. A full mouth feel rounds out this filling, high quality beer.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, silky, and has adequately mild carbonation. Overall, this is a great porter. It is complex without being overpowering, and is very drinkable. I can see this becoming a regular in my fridge.","KarlHungus","Jan 23, 2008"

Chocolatey and muddy and earthy and malty. Yeah, lots of good stuff going on there. Most of that translates nice over to the palate along with a nice, chalky dry cocoa feel. The rye shows its face with some spicy accents. Nice roasty bitterness lingers as well. This is a very nice porter.","Bighuge","Dec 22, 2007"

3.8,0.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,4.5,"A fairly smooth and tasty porter. There's a hint of something like whiskey, probably rye, around the edges that really comes out as this beer warms (and really, you need to let this one warm up). The taste is a subtle mix of chocolate malts and espresso with a very smooth body that reminds me of Firestone Walker's Reserve porter. Not as big and bold as some American porters, but worth trying.","tempest","Dec 04, 2007"

Once it settled the aroma is of chocolate, bready goodness. Taste, oh the taste. Let's see...chocolate malts, grassy hops, a hint of smoke, and oh so easy to drink. The grassy hop bitterness balances really nice with the dark malts. This beer could use a bit more mouthfeel and then it would be 5 for certain. Don't miss this gem!","beerkittycat","Nov 13, 2007"
