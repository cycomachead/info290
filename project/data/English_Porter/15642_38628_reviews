"Inky black. Smells of roasted malts hints of coffee. Very dry, burnt coffee grounds. Thin mouthfeel."

"A very good offering from a very small brewery in St. Paul, MN. Plenty of character can be found in this distinct English Porter. Worth picking up."

"Pours a dark brown body which borders on black. Two fingers of mocha foam which sticks around for a while. Moderate level of lacing. The aroma is of roast, light chocolate, and some faint oxidation in the form of dark fruits. Taste is roasted malts into some vinous red wine and dark fruits. Appears to be a tad over the hill and off, but it still remains drinkable. Mouthfeel is creamy but the beer has a certain mineral quality which detracts quite a bit. Overall this is clearly a beer that gets ruined with age. This must have at least a year or so on it and oxidation is seeping in and messing with the delicate porter notes. Drink fresh!"

"not really impressed by this beer at all. not sure how old it is, but the sourness is not a good sign. i have a feeling this will end up being a drain pour."

"Low C+"

"Overall: I didn't get much from the rye. I can't say I was a big fan of this beer. I don't think I would want another."

"O- A fairly good porter. It leans a little too far sweet and not quite roasted enough. That said, still tasty."
""
"With a little less alcohol and a little more flavor, this would be quite session-able, though it is a bit too middle-of-the-road otherwise."
""

""

"O: Meh. Not my favorite. Too bad since its local and they have been around since Surly."

"Very light brown head lingers nicely before falling to a thin lace. At first I thought the nose was coffee, but on second thought it's more clearly a clean roast with an earth spice coming out with the warmth. Strong malt with a roasty smokiness in the taste that's supported by a light but not thin body. Ends with a bitterness that lingers lightly. A very solid porter that pushes the style towards robust. In reading Flat Earth's description, Cygnus is made with rye malt, which explains the bite that I noticed but couldn't place. After I've had the straight Cygnus X-1 now, the differences overlaid in the S'mores infused Grand Design I took home at Christmas are clear. Cygnus is a slightly off centered porter that's fun and interesting to drink."

"O - I've only had this for a week or so, but have no idea how old it is. Anyway, this was undrinkable. Bummer, as I was looking forward to trying this."

"D: Oh yes. Again and again."

"O- A solid offering, but lacking a little flavor depth"
"Big thanks goes out to MBrausen for sending me this one so I could tick it! Shared this one with the NoDa Brewing crew in celebration of their grand opening weekend. Served from bottle into a Mikkeller taster flute. Poured a dark reddish brown with a minimal light tan head. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, and a subtle spiciness. The flavor was of roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, subtle sweet malt, and a subtle pepper spiciness. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I was quite surprised by the pepper spiciness on the followthrough. This was a pleasant surprise by the way... The rest of the brew was okay, but nothing special. Glad I got the chance to give this one a shot, but doubt I would seek it out in the future."

"O: Although I love this beer, I don't like how the peppers are adding to this beer. No comparison to Grand Design (Smores)."
"Not quite smooth and caramelly enough to be an English Porter, but still quite nice. While additional points of complexity are light and quite subtle, the malt profile is multi-faceted and shows great depth. A very drinkable, tasty porter."

"Overall a great porter and one I wish was distributed around here."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer."
"Good beer that might be even better on tap, a good choice when one doesn't want a huge dose of alcohol or a phalanx of hops."
"o - Overall a pretty nice porter. I liked the nose a lot and thought there was a lot of sweet chocolate. Would like to try again."
"Overall: A very good porter from Flat Earth. One of the better ones I have tasted."
"O- this is a great porter. Lots of roast but never burnt on the palate. Just enough sweetness to keep the flavors going."
"Sk√ÖL!"
"O: Not a huge fan, mostly of the flavor profile. It was just too much coffee for me. If it had a little more chocolate or roast and was a little thicker, I think it would have done the trick for me."
"Notes: This beer is medium bodied, and has a very creamy mouthfeel. It lacks a bit in body from what I expected, but flavor and complexity make up for it. A very tasty beer. I must admit, the first time I had this beer, it was an infected bottle, which turned me away, but now that I have had this again, I will be buying it more often, and I will be stocking it at the store in the near future."
"Very muvch a standard medium body porter, this beer clocks in at 6.5% abv and the alochol isn't noticeable. I shared the bomber with my roommate and a friend of his, and I'd probably do it again. Overall this is a solid, but not overwhelming beer. I'd be lucky to have it on tap, because it's very true to its style."
"a pretty good porter. lacks depth but is very approachable. recommended."
"Poured a very dark brown with a massive tan head that lingered. Smell is a bit light for a porter, more fruit and caramel malt and not quite as much roasted malt as I expect. Taste is nice, moderately complex, typical porter chocolate malts with some bitter hops following. Highly carbonated for a porter. Generally good, but not great."
"Thanks to brewnic for the extra. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a dimpled glass. The body is dark brown/black and atop it is a finger sized, tan head that fades slowly and is somewhat bubbly. So far so good. The aroma here is coffee, chocolate, tart dark fruits, low-key, but noticeably skunky hops and a generalized roast fragrance that leans toward bread and cereal grains rather than specifically malt. Roasty coffee and chocolate notes bloom in the fore and then segue into yet sweeter notes of fruit malt. This arrangement is pleasing, but there exists a metallic background to the whole affair that is distracting, from a flavor standpoint. While I wish that metal twang would go away, it was kind of a deal killer for me. The mouth feel is mostly where it should be for the style; full carbonation. I can't say I was impressed with this beer and wouldn't want it again though I respect the style."
"D - This is a really nice English-style porter. Very easy drinking and tasty."
"Good, but alcohol could drop a few points for a simple beer like this one."
"Overall: I was excited by the smell, and then disappointed by the taste. So overall, an average beer."
"Pretty good drink. It's tasty, and something I would venture for regularly, but not in the same night."
"Drinkability - A pretty good, but not great Porter. I'll try Flat Earth's other beers"
"D: A decent beer. Drinks well, but the roasted malt and roasted coffee flavor hang on a bit more than necessary."
"drinkability: good"
"Drinkability: Average. There is a flavor note, possibly the coffee bitterness, becomes a bit too lingering in an otherwise decent brew that isn't hard on the palate. Note: This is my favorite Flat Earth offering to date."
"D- Great as the weather starts to cool, a great balance of flavor, solid ABV is hidden nicely, great depth and fits very nicely into the style. I really like this beer and will certainly purchase again."
"Smooth, medium bodied, somewhat dry. and nicely carbonated. This is very drinkable, and very nice. I must seek this one out again."
"Bomber poured into a pint glass. Sort of light in color. Closer to the red end of the porter spectrum than black. Settles somewhere around auburn in color with a fluffy beige head. Aroma of See's Candies, mocha coffee, roasted grains. Nice, robust smell carries over into the flavor, which is similar but not as sweet. Black malts meld with a creamy iced coffee character. A porter through and through, not even remotely stout-like (this is an attribute I quite like, providing much needed separation between the styles). Very little roastiness or bitterness. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel is full and almost milky in consistency. Really a sublime porter in every way."
"Dark mahogany brown with a tannish head which lasted an impressive amount of time. A wonderful nose that revealed fresh bread, a hint of rye, coffee, and cream. Upon tasting, I actually thought it was a sort of sweet stout with lactose! Robust and rich, although somewhat thinner body. Carbonation helps bring it up a bit. Velvety smooth and definitely quaffable. I approve."
"Very drinkable. Relatively low ABV and everything else I've noted make this one go down easily. I'm glad this is a bomber rather than a 12 oz. bottle."
"I really liked this beer - but half way through it I started feeling like i was living around a campfire at the campground - smoked and burnt wood. While that brings present memories in this cold time, it isn't necessarily a great beer taste."
"Nice if not incredible porter. Cygnus X-1 pours a clear, dark cola brown with a medium beige head. The aroma consists of caramel, nuts, toast, bread, some chocolate and a bit of spicy rye. It's a pleasant, subtle porter, somewhere between English and American in flavor. The taste is a lightly dry. There's also a funny, slightly off flavor to the beer that I also tasted in Flat Earth's Angry Planet. It's not as strong here as it was there, but it's still an odd bit of background noise. Mouthfeel is a tad thin and carbonation is prickly. Good beer but wouldn't look to get another bottle."
"Easy drinking brew."
"Overall, not my favorite Flat Earth brew, but it's definitely a good one."
"Drinkability: About as dry as a Porter can get - which I like. Hard to stop drinking."
"D= As I mentioned in the taste portion I think the taste of this beer is somewhat mild and delicate so I find myself constantly coming back for sip after sip to keep the delicious taste on my tongue. Great representation of a porter and really reminds me of why I began drinking craft."
"Grabbed this one at a growler fill night right at the brewery. It's a great time to go in a get to try all of the beers and sodas available. The price is also pretty fair (as low as $9 for a growler)."
"The mouth is pretty average. Some carbonation play, and slight creamy feel. This is a pretty sour porter. The roasted coffee flavors I was expecting are absent. In their place is a sour mineral flavor that isn't all that pleasant. I had higher expectations for this, but I couldn't even finish the bottle. Not impressed."
"Taste is really big in the coffee. Come chocolate notes as well, big malt bomb for sure. No hops to speak of. The dark malts linger on your palate for quite a while. Body is pretty light, reminds me of a dry stout (I'm thinking cadillac mtn stout) more than a porter."
"Poured a medium brown with an enormous head that slowly faded to a one fingered one. The aroma, while chilled, was vinegar, but as it warmed you could smell the chocolate. The taste too, was very sour, like vinegar cut with soda water. The flavor was helped by warming, but not a great deal, and remained somewhat sour. Feel was light bodied, even for a porter, with only a small amount of carbonation that survived the head. Drinkability was only fair. I had been looking forward to trying something from Flat Earth and was a little disappointed. I had thought that the contents had spoiled or been infected, but too many reviewers expressed similar experience with X-1. Oddly, a large number reported the opposite, a malty sweetness, so something wasn't quite right. Reasonably priced and not terrible, but I'd be reluctant to try again."
"A 22 ounce bomber bottle poured into my standard shaker glass. The porter appears a hazed deep brown color with about two fingers of ecru foam. The foam settles to a thin ring in less than a minute leaving no lace behind. Nose and flavor are of medium roasted cereal grain, bittersweet chocolate, slightly spicy, sour, licorice notes, some smoke. Medium in both body and carbonation with a slight alcohol burn as the beer warms up."
"So this is a very a good beer. My first by this brewery. Appearance is good, very dark small head and some lacing. Smell and taset are very similar. Lots of bitter chocolat, a vit of roasted nuts and some sweet malt. Not a lot of hop presence, but this is to be expected. Mouthfeel is also good, medium body and slight carbonation. Drinkability is very good."
"Pours a kind of flat looking dark black into the pint glass. Not flat, but not super-lively looking either. Smells like sweet, not just malt sweet, like there is some fruit in there as well. Taste is a lot different than anticipated. It's actually kind of sour, not really vinegaric, but tart. Like a raspberry tart porter. I thought it might have been a bad bottle, but then I saw others here experiencing the same. It's not really roasty or dry, more sweet. Mouthfeel is pleasant and coating, but drinkability suffered from the unexpected tartness. Not bad by any means, just different."
"Clearly needs to be consumed in season."
"I don't know if this was infected or it was supposed to taste like this, but I definitely didn't like it. Very disappointed."
"My first experience with Flat Earth is a bag of mixed results. The big positive is that it has a nice, interesting, novel flavor due to the rye infusion. The big negative is overcarbonation. Way off the mark. Remedying that problem would do much to improve it. Nonetheless, I like the flavor and approach. Worth checking out."
"For an English Porter, had some funky smell and taste going on. Not clean. Bottle wasn't infected but it was just ...off. Some smoke flavoring but very very thin for this type of beer. I wanted something to stand out and say....yeah. But that never happened. Drain pour..No. But I won't be purchasing another one in a very long time considering there are MANY more better porters out there and for less money. This beer tasted CHEAP. Like it was made at the old Pig's Eye brewery. Come on guys, you can do better. If you are going to use a classic rock band's song for a beer, please make a quality product. I am afraid RUSH wouldn't be proud. No endorements from them or from me for that matter."
"D - Drinkable, even if it has an aftertaste."
"D: Very easy, very smooth. A pretty standard ABV, so not really sessionable, but if you have the tolerance it won't fill you up."
"Bomber that I forgot about- probably pushing a year old. It didn't explode while in the cellar, so we are off to a good start! Pours a dark ebony with some garnet highlites when held up to the light. Minimal head but fine lacing. Nose- light roast, dark chocolate. Taste- quite dry, surprisingly spicy for style, chocolate, medium fruitiness, nuts. Carbonation is a little high, and the finish is metallic. Drinkability is not too bad."
"Clear maple syrup amber brown body. Large, creamy, lacy, dark beige head. Good retention. Nose is, surprisingly full of sour cherries and lemon tartness. Uh-oh. Some scorched caramel and chocolate detectable, but mostly sour and woody. Taste is, as expected, overwhelmingly tart and sour. Overcarbonated and gushy, with unpleasant woody tartness. It's too bad, because I was really looking forward to trying this beer! Better luck next time Flat Earth."
"Overall, gross."
"D - My expectations where not met and I hope this was a single bad bottle."
"Overall: I've been wanting to try this for a while and I am kind of mystified by it. Since it was such a surprise I am enjoying it quite a bit and I would love to try it on tap but it just was not what I would expect from a porter. I don't think I would reach for this one to warm me up on a cold night like the bottle suggests, but I will reach for again when I'm at the store. I wonder what a Flat Earth stout would be like?"
"D-This a good one, and one of my favorites from Flat Earth. Although not spectacular, it's very enjoyable and has been an enjoyable choice on several occasions. Also, nice with a meal, as I enjoyed the second half of the bomber with dinner."
"I bought this at Stimmel's in OH for $5.99 a month ago, never seen it for sale again before or since. The beer is dark reddish brown colored, clear but with low light transmission, with an enourmous poofy foam that takes forever to recede. The smell is good, and in fact is the strongest attribute in my opinion. Loads of roasted malt and chocolate. The taste has a surprising amount of sourness in it, so much that I suspect there's something wrong with my bottle (maybe the bottle wasn't disinfected properly before filling, the flavor seems similar to a homebrew problem I had once). Anyway I can still get some chocolate flavor out of if but the sourness makes it difficult to enjoy. I'll try this again if I see it in MN, hopefully from a different batch, and revise the review in case I had a bad bottle."
"Headlong into mystery...."
"Spinning, whirling, still descending like a spiral sea, unending!"
"This beer goes down nicely and goes down easily. Nicely drinkable porter."
"D - I could tip more than a few back, although the aftertaste - while excellent - tends to grate."
"this beer was super easy to drink and at 6.5% i could drink it all day."
"D - Excellent porter. I love the rye twist! I'll be looking for this one again and next time I'll have some Rush on the stereo!!"
"Drinkability - a super sessionable porter. Gets better as it goes, just like the tune. Thanks to WankerWeasel for the bottle; good one, Ben."
"Cygnus X-1 is a terrific English porter that is only a bit more barley shy of blowing both my socks off rather than just the one. I will wait until I've had the other two Flat Earth beers that are in my cellar before passing final judgment on this relatively new brewery. So far, though, it looks like they have a bright future. Thanks feloniousmonk."
"hop in the aftertaste. A very nice Porter to be sure."
"This one didn't suffer from bottle bomb but it did have a lot of carbonation. I chilled it for a couple days in anticipation of an overflow but instead I just got a huge head on the first pour. Its a very dark brown with a fluffy, light brown head. It smells mostly of roasted grains and light chocolate malts but I get a slight bit of hoppiness and smoke on the tail end. The taste is really complex and well blended. Similar to the smell with a pronounced bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel was a little thin and this was definitely over carbonated but it seems like they are on the way to fixing that. This could easily be one of the best porters I've tried to date."
"D: Oh, this is an easy one to drink!"
"D: Damn! I wasn't expecting this. Once I got beyond the ridiculous carbonation (and if they toned that down I would give this a higher score), this is one hell of a beer. Elements of a porter, smoke ale, as well as a milk stout come through. The end result is amazing!"
"It is a curious beer for sure. Keep the beers coming Flat Earth!"
"Magnificent brew here... Different, but in a very good way.."
"No issues with drinkability. Not particularly challenging, yet there is some depth to this brew, its just that in my opinion the overall experience would be enhanced with a slightly more robust porter character. Recommended for fans of porters and rye brews, and would serve quite nicely as an introduction to these types of beer. Almost sessionable, although the 6.5% ABV would catch up to the drinker sooner rather than later. That being said it would be pretty easy to drink this one all day and or night long."
"Drinkability- A very easy drinking porter, at 6.5% that I intend on drinking again. Per the advice of KarlHungus, I also plain on pairing this with BBQ. I can easily see that would be a solid pairing with this particular offering."
"Drinkability: Very good. A very enjoyable beer."
"This is a wonderful smelling and tasting porter but again it is ruined by poor bottling."
"D: Tasty and easy enough to drink with being as heavy as it is."
"Poured from a 22oz Bomber bottle into an Imperial pint glass. Poured aggressively, resulting in a 1 finger tan head of foam that lasts quite awhile. Dark brown and nearly opaque, it left decent lacing on the glass. Starts with a malty, roasty, chocolaty nose that leads into a roasted, toffee taste. It has an earthy bitterness with a slight smoked flavor. It finishes with a quite clean aftertaste. A full mouth feel rounds out this filling, high quality beer. A very impressive 1st tasting from the Flat Earth Brewery, I'm looking forward to trying some more!"
"D- Very good for an english porter."
"Purchased in bomber at Rum River Liquor. ABV 6.5%"
"This beer pours a dark mahogany, almost black color. The head is large, creamy, firm, and recedes very slowly into a thick cap of foam. The aroma is of chocolate, whiskey, oak, and burnt caramel. The taste is of oak, vanilla, whiskey, dark chocolate, and toffee. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, silky, and has adequately mild carbonation. Overall, this is a great porter. It is complex without being overpowering, and is very drinkable. I can see this becoming a regular in my fridge."
"Clear mahogany. A silky smooth light brown head forms with the pour. It recedes to a thin pool of oily froth that coats nicely as I drink. Very nice aroma. Chocolatey and muddy and earthy and malty. Yeah, lots of good stuff going on there. Most of that translates nice over to the palate along with a nice, chalky dry cocoa feel. The rye shows its face with some spicy accents. Nice roasty bitterness lingers as well. This is a very nice porter."
"Overall, a phenomenal porter. It fits the syle perfectly w/ a charming uniqueness. I will be picking this up again for sure. I had one the other night and found myself craving it all day at work. Truely a fine creation from a great brewery."
"A fairly smooth and tasty porter. There's a hint of something like whiskey, probably rye, around the edges that really comes out as this beer warms (and really, you need to let this one warm up). The taste is a subtle mix of chocolate malts and espresso with a very smooth body that reminds me of Firestone Walker's Reserve porter. Not as big and bold as some American porters, but worth trying."
"Poured into a pint glass this beer came to me with a frothy and thick light brown head. Appearance is deep reddish brown, almost black from a distance. Once it settled the aroma is of chocolate, bready goodness. Taste, oh the taste. Let's see...chocolate malts, grassy hops, a hint of smoke, and oh so easy to drink. The grassy hop bitterness balances really nice with the dark malts. This beer could use a bit more mouthfeel and then it would be 5 for certain. Don't miss this gem!"
"D - Very drinkable. This beer drinks very easy and such a nice mouthfeel that you are always left wanting more. A wonderful tasting porter. I hope to see this beer in bottles soon. In my opinion this beer could easily rank up as one of the better Porters out there."
"[Served chilled, in a shaker pint]"
"Served in a Flat Earth snifter at the Happy Gnome, unfortunately that makes it hard for me to smell. Tastes good though, I like the roasted flavors of the porter and the grassy, pilsner-like hops. Hopefully it will be bottled eventually!"
"Mouthfeel felt rather thin, but other than that it was a nice brew. The alcohol is almost unnoticeable so it would make a nice session beer for a cold evening."
"Overall: I liked this beer a lot. What is a solid porter was made more interesting with the extra layer of flavor the rye malt gave it. Maybe it just that I haven't had many rye beers, but I had to think a bit harder about what I was tasting. And I think it helps that I like whiskey. Good job Flat Earth."
"On tap at The Muddy Pig, this pours a clear brownish black color, with a brownish head and ample lacing on the glass. The smell is of raisins and malt. The taste includes raisins, plum, a slightly smoky flavor and dark chocolaty malt. There is a slightly hoppy finish, bringing a nice balance to this beer. The mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing. This is a terrific porter and is yet another great reason to drink Flat Earth beers."
"Way to go on this one FE."
"Good effort, though...one of my favorite Flat Earths, and one I'll try again, for sure. Good to see more quality dark brews coming out from the locals."
"The drinkability is a glide of fun, solid, porter taste and has an easy going character and complextion that seems simple but does not approach any such missing elements. A well crafted brew by Flat Earth. Perfect for this crisper, cooler Autumn air."
