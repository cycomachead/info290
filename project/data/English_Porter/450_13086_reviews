"This beer paired very well with my pulled pork sandwich."
""
""
""
"Very medium with a lingering toasty taste."
""
"Refreshing, crisp, would acquire again. A good Porter."
"Twelve ounce bottle. Clear dark brown with a light n brown head. Good lacing. Nose has molasses, dark brown bread. Fruity yeast. Taste is rich with malt and molasses. Fruity yeast flows into mild hoppiness. A bit of mineral, no alcohol anywhere.  Smooth full carbonation with moderate weight. One of my my favorite porters."

"This is a fairly strong, dark porter with a nice, rugged brownish head and good lacing.  I liked the maltiness and full body.  Not a bad choice, served on tap for Valentine's Day (and on Presidents' Day weekend).  I would definitely get it again."

"O: Not as unique as Deep Six but more refreshing; solid and enjoyable all-around."
"On draft at the Landings in New Hope, PA."
"Nice porter. Pours a nice dark colors with a cinger head that fades some. Leaves some nice lacing. Overall a nice drinkable porter"

"Wasnt a big fan of the taste. Tasted almost like somebody poured a shot of whiskey in my beer. Had the other 2 revolutionary ales and this was by far the worst one. Usually love Yards beer but this wasnt my cup of tea"

"Taste is surprisingly sweet from the molasses. Almost as sweet as a milk stout. Notes of coffee on the palate but the sweet chocolate predominates. Drinks like a light milk stout. The finish is bitter dark chocolate. No wonder we won the war."
""
"Taste: A solid malt and porter taste with lots of coffee, some chocolate. I'm naive about how some of these porters are made, but I won't be surprised if a dark coffee is blended in with this porter. My experience with porters is limited, but I was somewhat disappointed with this one as it appears to try too hard to be a porter. I hope that makes sense."

"O: Other porters I have had are either too strong in the coffee, chocolate and other complex flavors. This beer is very drinkable and has more simple flavors than many other porters. But, this beer still has a delicious balance of more simple ingredients that makes it very drinkable but still tasty"
""
""
""
""
"O: This is quite a nice porter. I would recommend this to someone who doesn't want the chewy flavor and mouthfeel of a stout. It's essentially a mini stout, Good complex flavor in the malt and nice balance that leans toward the malty side."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I last had this in 2008 and don’t remember the circumstances, but I will upgrade the rating in my database. This is a very pleasant porter with a definite molasses flavor and sweetness but is not cloying. The appearance is enticing, the aroma is weak, and the flavor and palate are very good."

"o: A tasty and easy drinking porter with a slight muskiness reminiscent of old-time taverns. Or am I just imagining the latter? No, and I like it."
""
""
"Overall excellent. Highly recommended."
""
"O: I cannot tell a lie: this is a fine porter. It's not up there in the elite tier by any means, but it's certainly not gross, either. Personally, I think it's a bit too licorice-y. Oh well, still worth trying."

"Overall: A decent porter that is not complex, but has a good flavor. Would not seek out again, but glad I tried, based on how much I liked the Chocolate Love Stout from the same brewery."
"Pours a deep brown, possibly black, no light gets through to be able to tell. It has a moderate tan head that has almost no retention, but leaves a little lacing. The aroma is mild with some dark roast notes and a little hint of alcohol sweetness. The taste is very roast forward with just a hint of earthy hops on the finish. There is a little silkiness to the mouthfeel and a slightly lighter weight to the body. An above-average porter from the first president."

"O: This is a great porter and a great beer. I like to believe that George Washington would have been drinking something very close to this. I love weird/old stuff like this. I mean DFH's Ancient Ale series got me into beer. This has me very excited to try the other two ales of the Revolution."

"Deep brown in color with good clarity (you'll need a bright light of course). Poured with a short, rich, light beige foam that slowly reduced to a wispy cap. Roasted malt and sweet toffee aromas with earthy, herbal hop and dark chocolate notes beneath. Medium bodied with a creamy smooth feel and soft carbonation. Dark roasted and chocolate malt flavors with sweet toffee up front and earthy bitter hops through the middle. Bitterness fades to roasted malts at the end as this finishes crisp and dry. Outstanding."
""
"Porter is one of my favorite style's. This one is a standout. Perfect porter profile, sweet chocolate and coffee notes. Subtle hop profile. Nice head and great finish TRY THIS BEER!!!! Its a great…nay the best porter in PA. I would put this up against founders and great lakes for the best representation of the style. I am glad I bought this case. I will be savoring it this winter!"

"O: This beer is extremely easy to drink and has an interesting mix of aromas and flavors."
"O - Pretty good beer all around"
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
"Note: This beer was tasted at the Yards' Brewing Tasting Room on January 18, 2014."
""
"Kickass beer! Why was is so hard for them to evidence the goodness in the aroma? A fault is a fault, but it's still a 4."
""
""

"Its interesting and different than most of the American porters I've had recently- perhaps its a reflection of the English porter style. Its not as roasty or chocolatey as it is straight up sweet with molasses and toffee. It has a little more in common with barleywines than it does stouts, indeed. I won't try this one again, but it was definitely an interesting change of pace for porters."

"This ale drank better than all of the others of this beer I drank out of this case (this is my last one.) I'm sure that it is because I'm actually thinking about it and not hitting several up with friends and catching a buzz, but this isn't too bad of a porter at all. A pretty respectable beer from Yard's (who I am not USUALLY overly impressed with.)"
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Great porter, very close to a stout. Best if you enjoy a combination both strong hops and malts. One of my favorite porters."
"Overall, this is a great beer, to style and unique at the same time. Porters are always under-appreciated. Even better brew on cask or at the brewery."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a very nice mild English porter. Apparently Washington had this brewed for his troops. Hope they were as pleased with it as I was. (Even though I'm british :)"
""
""
""
"Overall: Damn this is a great beer! One of the better porters I’ve had in fact. According to Yards, this beer was created using George Washington’s own recipe. If that’s accurate, our (I’m American) first President made a damn great beer! I’m continuing to be impressed with the Yards Brewing Company. I'd love to see what the bourbon barrel-aged version of this beer is like!"

"Overall, this was a nice porter that definitely has some qualities of that of a belgian dark ale. This one stands out, and I'll definitely try this one again."
"Pours black with light foam. Clear on top. Light coffee nose. Malty. Chocolate layers. Smooth classic porter taste. Subdued bitter where chocolate/coffee pokes through. Very smooth. Really good porter."
""
""
""
""
""
"A deep, thick black appearance with a decent tan head that settles a bit but holds on for a healthy trail of lacing. The aroma offers relatively mild malt with nuances of charcoal, coffee and grass hops, but relatively polite overall. The flavor jumps in with smooth cocoa-coffee and maybe a touch of diluted licorice. Impressively gentle on the palate yet offering a pleasant grassy hop edge that blends tastefully. I don't think it's too much more complex than that, but this is very solid and highly drinkable. It's medium bodied with a satiny, smooth feel including delicate carbonation. Very much recommended, an any time porter!"
"O - Decently complex but traditional and full feeling, good porter, would like to have on tap for sure."
""
"Overall, I would like to say that this beer is world class. I think that some may argue with that assessment on the grounds that it may be too sweet with too much molasses or somehow doesn't completely fit with the grain bill. But it seems to me that this is a pretty broad category in beers and allows for such differences. I'm going out on a limb here and calling this 5 out of 5. It's so very complex, sweet yet dry, balanced with the only hint of the ABV being the warming feeling in my stomach. World Class!"
"O - worth revisiting this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A nice porter that was easy to drink. Nothing out of the ordinary but solid."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – Quite a delicious brew. The flavor has lots of transitions with all of them being relatively smooth and un-abrupt. Other then the somewhat weak creaminess/body, it was quite a nice brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, creamy and smooth on the tongue. This is one of the better Yards offerings with a nice feel and more pronounced flavor than some of their other brews. I'd be curious to see how the barrel-aged version matches up."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Solid Porter with an English feel in the malts and yeast. You can taste the influence of Great Britain on this early American recipe, luckily we threw them out and now brew our own styles of beer."
"O - Pleasantly surprised with this one, as I have been underwhelmed with virtually everything I've had from Yards. But this is pretty good."
"O - I like many of Yards offerings and htis is another goodie. a mild porter for those who like the dark malt flavors without a heavy bodied beer. Pretty enjoyable."

"Date: 17 January 2013...Glassware: Yuengling pint...Occasion: The Blind Side on NetFlix--probably the last football fan to see this film (call it a Ravens aversion)...Appearance: dark burgundy body and a thick brown head; fits the bill for a porter, and an old-school one at that...Aroma: fragrant, lactic scent with a hint of peat that is indicative of a deeper flavor--rum and spices (nutmeg?)...Taste: malty, pleasant, smooth and lightly smoked--easily a win when considering the weighty 7% abv this beer's pushing...Palate: thick, creamy, full-bodied porter--much creamier than expected...Overall: Nice to know that goodbeer doesn't change much in terms of its recipes; this is my favorite of the the Ales of the Revolution sampler--and that is a Hancock-sized compliment! This takes its place among the Yuengling, Samuel Smith and Victory's offerings..."
"Overall - I liked this beer a great deal more than I thought I would. I read ""brewed with molasses"" on the label, I knew I might be picking up a bottle that was way too sweet for my taste. General Washington's Tavern Porter is a nicely balanced example of the stylearhat is fairly easy to drink and I would definitely buy it again."
""
""
"Overall, a very drinkable porter, not heavy at all."
""
"O: My brother brought a case of these from PA for Christmas. A couple weeks later and there are only a few left - and I don't think I've shared any more than a bottle or two. So yeah, I've been enjoying this as a pretty easy-drinking porter that packs a decent punch at 7% ABV."
""
""
"O: I prefer other English porters like Fullers and Samuel Smith's Taddy. This one wasn't bad though."
"O: While the body could have a bit more heft, this is a very good porter. The aroma is decent, but the beer shines in its flavor. It almost seems too sweet at first sip, but the bitter finish balances the beer nicely."
""
""
""
""
""

"Pretty good porter...robust but not too roasted or bold. Solid offering."

"D: Excellent, given the strength. No wonder we won the Revolution. If you’re ever in a war and one side’s drinking this while the other is drinking tea, bet on the side fueled by this beer every time. Big flavor, but surprisingly light body makes for solid drinkability. Much lighter than the flavor would suggest. Overall, very nice composition. I love it when a “novelty beer” delivers above and beyond expectations."
""

"This whole series of ""Ales of the Revolution"" are far from gimmicky, and the three I've tasted are each excellent in their own way. From the 12 oz bottle bought at Food and Friends."
"Although this is in that pack it tastes nothing like the other two. This is dark and a bit heavier although maintianing the median ABV of the group. Nothing is transparent when poured into a glass and the foam is white. My least favorite of the 3 AOR but can be found on draught at the City Tavern."
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied and carbonated with surprisingly, a smoother, creamier feel than I recall the tap having. I’m not a fan of overly carbonated, prickly porters and this one was smooth and soft enough in the mouth to be very pleasing."
""
""
""
"A tasty solid porter. Another impressive item for Washington's resume."
""
""
""
"The bottle states that it's color is a deep garnet... and I find that I rather agree! You can see the light coming through towards the bottom of the glass... a beautiful color, and it has a mountainous, pillowy head that sticks around for quite a while, never fully receding. Aroma - Roasted malt, toffee, vanilla cream, milk chocolate, and perhaps the faintest bit of hops. In the flavor I am picking up coffee, molasses, and definitely some hop bitterness in there. The beer coats the mouth very well and tingles as it goes down. The ABV is imperceptible, however. Overall I would recommend this. The bitterness to the finish adds a ruggedness to the character of what would have been an average porter."
"O - Nice complexity and balance to this porter. The alcohol is hidden well. Overall, an excellent sipping beer that only gets better as it warms."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is mild, some roasted malts. Taste is roasted malts, molasses, some notes of coffee, a touch of alcohol. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
"O: I really appreciate what Yards has done with this brew. It takes me back in time and makes me wonder what the founding fathers must have drank. I think Yards executed this one flawlessly and it's a fine interpretation. Being in Philly, I also can't help the fact that I can find this one real fresh."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a good beer. There is very little differentiation between this porter and the average porter from many other breweries. It was good to have this after a very long day, but on it's own I wouldn't go out of your way to find a bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is an okay beer, I won't buy it again, but it's very cool to try an old historic recipe!"
""
""
"This is an excellent porter for a cold winter night. If Washington did brew a beer similar to this it was definitely worth fighting for."
""
"Theres a bright fruit sweetness somewhere in here if you look for it. Eh."
"YUMMY, TRY SOME!"
""
""
""
""
""
"The palate opens with rather excellent flavors ruined by excessive carbonation. Robustly roasty with a pleasing blend of grainy bitterness and acidity, complemented by flavors of cocoa, a little caramel and fruity yeast, this is quite an enjoyable porter. Very dry, this beer has flavors of unsweetened cocoa. Drying on the finish with a mild bitterness, this beer is light in body, quite excessively carbonated, leading to a not wholly welcome carbonic acid bite and lightening the body to the point of wateriness. Despite it, though, there's a nice fruitiness that also lingers. The alcohol is fairly well hidden too. All told, a pretty decent and enjoyable porter. Allowing the carbonation to settle down greatly enhances the moutfeel, and I'm adjusting my score up by half a point to reflect this improvement."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I found the Tavern Porter to be an interesting take on a porter. It's sweeter than most normal porters, which is probably attributable to the molasses. An interesting colonial recipe that is timeless."
""
""
"Overall: This is impressive porter. If Washington brewed a similar beer, he truly was the right man to lead this newborn nation. I wonder if he sold six packs?"
""
"Morey's Bottom Line: This falls a bit short in today's market, but I wouldn't have been first in line back in the day. If this is what our leaders were drinking then, what happened! Shame on the BMC's drinkers of today!"
""
"This is so good, I might even buy a case!"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm glad I picked this one. Can't have more than 2 in one night, but that just makes my stock last longer."
""

"The aroma was steep with roasted malts. Rich notes of caramel and molasses. Light grain touches and a bit of a herbal note persisted. Nice robust flavor, rich and sweet with a dry finish. Lots of roasted malts and a classic coffee and chocolate profile. Smooth, mellow and quite nice"
""
""
"I think if there's anything this beer lacks, it's a little complexity. The taste, while awesome, gives itself away almost immediately. But hey, if that's the only problem I have with this beer, I am most certainly ok with that. Delicious."
"Thanks ericwo for the trade!"
"D: George Washington was clearly the best brewer of the three statesmen. Or at least this beer was the best of the series and, for my tastes, the only one I'd buy again. I love the concept of Ales of the Revolution series, but they should be released seasonally or something. No one wants to drink colonial recipes year round."
"Pours a three-finger light tan head that fades slowly to a ring leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Light-medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Baked chocolate nose and flavor is baked chocolate with some molasses. $3.00 for a 12oz bottle from Mount Vernon Gift Shop, Mount Vernon, VA."
"Another great selection from Yards, recreating G. Washington's old recipe. (Such a recipe does exist: see Mosher's book.) Pours a dark reddish-brown with a decent tan head that leaves a soapy lacing on the glass. Rich aroma that hit me before I even touched the glass. All kinds of sugars, caramel, toffee, molasses. This carries over into the taste without disappointment, rich and sweet, smooth and malty, with just a bit of coffee bitterness. Very nice. Heavy-medium body, and quite drinkable."
"I give it an overall of 4.5 this is a very good Porter."
"Overall a pretty good beer and I would buy it again for sure."
"A nice porter. I would drink it again."
"O- Not a bad offering from Yards, glad to try it once but nothing to special or mind blowing, thanks Centennial for sending this and the many other Yards beers."
"D: I had planned to serve beer from a certain brewery based in Otsego County, NY to my friends from Europe when they arrive; I think I'll start them off with this instead. For one thing, its historic pedigree is unmatched (and one more reason to love this country); for another, it is an unusual pleasure to drink no matter what continent you're from."
"A really solid porter. I tend to like a bit more oomph from the black patent, but this is thoroughly enjoyable."
"O: Overall this is a good porter. Thanks again to Rhong187 for the chance to try this one. Would love to have again if I have the chance."
"The cost of this stuff is atrocious, what, is Washington's family getting royalties or something?"
"The beer is dark brown with 1/4"" of tan head that leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma brings some roast, malt, chocolate, and subtle alcohol. The flavor is decent, but relatively bland. The body is thin to medium, with solid carbonation. Unexciting, but unoffensive and easy to drink. I would drink a pint of this again."
"I liked this porter. A simple, straightforward take on the style, embracing the roots. Enjoyable from start to finish."
"O- A decent beer, but I really expect more body out of a porter. Good flavors, but they disappear and just don't linger like I'd like."
"O: Nicely balanced porter. The alcohol is present but not overwhelming. An easy drinker and very enjoyable"
"The body was light and crisp (for the style) and had a clean finish. Drinkability was good, the beer went down easily. Overall, an interesting brew. Worth seeking out for a try."
"Poured into glass. Head was about 2 fingers and the color was dark and rich not quite yet black. Taste was smooth and malty. Overall mouthful, this beer went down really smooth and was no after taste to it. Overall a good beer just the way General Washington intended it to be. Thumbs up and Bottoms Up"
"Food Pairing: Meat, Blackened Items, BBQ (Sweet BBQ Sauces would be great), Pork with fruit salsa, Shark would be really great with this, Medium-Strong Cheeses."
"O - Not a bad porter. Glad i got to try it."
"D: Moderate, at 7% ABV"
"O - Delicious porter, well balanced and including some nice dark notes. Pretty drinkable."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, sweet roasted coffee. In the taste, a small roast of sweet to dry coffee. A smooth and medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry roast in the aftertaste. Nice roast, with a nice coffee presence."
"D: Flavorful and smooth. Nicely balanced"
"O: Overall I found the beer to be very satisfying. The smell had some interesting smoky notes and the flavor balance the sweet flavor, roasted malt flavor, and slight bitter aftertaste. I'd definitely recommend you try this beer, especially considering its historical background."
"Overall, I enjoyed it, it's a solid porter, and something I would drink 2 or more of in a sitting. If it really is what George Washington was drinking, then he was a Beer Advocate. I can't believe it says this is 7%, I got no hint of that at all."
"Way to go Kehoe!"
"Slightly high abv is the only thing that brings down the drinkability. Really well done, if you are having only one or two."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, It was a nicely flavored and easy drinking beer overall. It had some nice chocolate flavors to it that I really enjoyed. Very nice porter."
"D- Smooth and easy. Alcohol notes are not masked as well as I would prefer, but this is nice for a cool night to warm up!"
"Mouthfeel is rich and smooth. Drinkability is very good. I could enjoy a few of these on a cold night."
"D: Porters are something I drink on occasion and today was a great occasion for one - nice, chilly day outside, football on inside. Went down nicely."
"Slainte!"
"thick velvetly mouthfeel. a damn good porter."
"Black in body with fleeting off-white head. Smells of roast, earth, wood, and hops. Tastes of roast, hop bitterness/dryness, cola, tang, and some syrup. Medium bodied and cola mouthfeel. Flavorful and sessionable. The best of the revolutionary series."
"A good session porter."
"It reminds me alot of what the base brew for Anchor Christmas ale would taste like before they add all the twigs and stuff."
"D: I really do like the flavors and the interesting historic perspective (label-bragging about 'following General Washington's original recipe' and being 'brewed with molasses' = good move). Good enough to have again and again...but that'll take another trip eastward. If you're in the mid-Atlantic, you owe it to yourself to give this one a try."
"Pours a fairly dark brown with a bit of a garner tint. Off white head with some good lacing. Nose is pretty sting with roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and a bit of molasses. The taste brings forward the roasted malt and some chocolate. Light to medium body with good carbonation levels. Drinks fairly well, especially being in a location where Washington himself used to hold meetings."
"Yard's George Washington Tavern Porter is a really nice English Porter. It is a dark brown, almost black with just some transparency when held up to the light. The beer smells very roasty with definite coffee and chocolate notes with some malt toastiness that is almost like a mocha with a bowl of oatmel. The beer has a molasses, caramel sweetness, medium roast flavor and a subtle bitterness. There is a jammy fruit character from the English yeast that melds well with the coffee. This is well balanced, without any dominating flavors allowing this beer to be easily enjoyed and many flavors to come through."
"Drinkability is good. Nothing stands out or is complex about this porter, but its still an easy drinking beer with some good flavor. Easy to put back a pint or two."
"This beer is very dark, and pours with a about 1 cm of off white which dissipates to a ring around the outside rather quickly. Not bad. The smell is of coffee and caramel. It tastes a bit different from the other times i had it, when it was strong coffee and cocoa flavor. unfortunately, there is a little bit of a metallic note, but fortunately it is mild enough to not detract too much from the beer. The mouthfeel is smooth, and creamy with good carbonation. Great drinkability for such a heavy porter at 7%. It really is a great component of Yard's revolution beers."
"Honestly this is one of the better, most balanced porters I have had. Looks great, taste great and can drink loads of it. Yards has another winner."
"D: Not as porter like as I was hoping. Not a bad beer by any means just not what I was expecting. Worth noting because it is brewed from Washington's recipe... beyond that not much."
"Pours a very dark brown with a beautiful, frumpy tan head that sticks all over the glass. Aromas a brimming over with molasses and spices like cinnamon and ginger. There's far more alcohol on the nose and far less roastiness on the nose than I normally like, but the uniqueness of its spicy bouquet has completely stolen my heart. This porter tastes (in order of flavor intensity) like sweet molasses, burnt sugar, Christmas spices, dark chocolate and general roastiness. Unlike any porter I've ever had. Intriguing stuff, for sure. I'm going to give this beer, along with Yard's Spruce Ale, as gifts to fellow beer geeks this December."
"Having a pretty good idea of what the historic British Porters tasted like, I have a hard time believing this is any more than slightly close to George's porter. That said, it's probably my favorite of the ""Ales of the Revolution"" series."
"Drinkability: Not a bad porter, though I was expecting a bit more oomph. All of the flavors are very well balanced, though they are a bit subdued. I would say that if you are looking for an easy drinking porter, this is your beer. If you're looking for a ""punch you in the face"" kind of porter, there are better choices out there."
"At the Coppermine Pub in North Arlington, NJ. Poured coffee brown, with one finger of tan-colored head, and good lacing. Smelled of bitter chocolate, roasted coffee, biscuit, and malt. Tasted of roasted coffee and very chocolatey, with a malty-sweet finish. Smooth, not overly-carbonated medium-to-thick body was very pleasant. Great session porter."
"Goes down like liquid candy. No significant carbonation to slow you down. If you dig the flavor, you can put back several of these in one sitting, especially when pairing it up with a hearty meal - turkey, stuffing, potatoes, root veggies, for instance. I will admit, though, that the sweetness does grow to cloying after 3-4 without any food to intercede. But, nonetheless, this is one of my faves."
"Taste is an interesting combination of licorice, dark fruit, smoke and cocoa. I could see this as being a historically brewed beer with some high fermentation temps and maybe a little bit of wood from being cask conditioned. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), much to Martha's chagrin there are many better porters out there to choose from. Although, it is fun to step back and think of what the founding fathers drank and talked about nearly 250 years ago...fun beer, I enjoyed it."
"Attributed to a recipe developed by George Washington. This porter is pretty much black as the ace of spades, but with dark ruby edges, topped off with a dark ivory head. The nose is heavy with molasses and chocolate, how I love those smells. In the mouth it is like drinking rich dark chocolate melted and lightly hopped. Yes it is that good! Another superbly well made and simple beer."
"D - Well I didn't like this more than the Tavern Ale but it wasn't terrible. Didn't expect it to be so bitter but since it was my 4th beer tonight it worked its way into my palate. If I seen the variety case again and had nothing else to buy I would consider it again."
"Poured from a standard 12oz brown bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. Appears a dark brown color with some reddish hints and a lighter brown color around the edges. Tanned head initially presents itself about a finger strong but receeds fairly fast to just a thin layer of lace upon the top of the beer and slight lacing is evident along the glassware. Very pleasant dark roast aroma with scents of chocolate and some suggestions of dark fruit like plum. Taste is the dark roasty malt with flavors of bitter dark chocolate and a warming and noticeable flavor of alcohol. Slight bitterness from the hops is there in the flavor as well towards the finish. Medium feel with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is one very drinkable and enjoyable porter. Lingering flavors of chocolate and dark fruit almost like plums or rasins is left lingering in the mouth. Overally quite good and one of the better beers I have had from Yards. Well done."
"Dr. A really good porter, but one will do it. It's too thick and heavy to have a bunch. I followed it with a Smithwick's."
"It's undeniably best served from the cask at cellar temperature. The molasses involved in the brewing process makes it a great dessert beer or even a winter warmer. I'm content with just one, but if you happen to this brew in the cask soak it up while you can."
"D: A competent porter that was pretty good with good attention to malting and a nice hops finish. A little more molasses would provide more originality and sharpen the flavor a bit more, but, all in all, a good brew."
"Would I buy more of it? - yes, I wish I could get Yards beers up here in MA. Next time I am in the Philly area visiting family I'll need to pick more of this up."
"Purchased at Wexford Ale House in Wexford PA. It isn't bad at all but not as deep of a flavor as I usually to for. The smell is nice but rather weak. Flavor is not bitter at all. Very mild after taste but it is rather good. Very dinkable. Not heavy so you cam enjoy a few at one sitting."
"This is tasty stuff. Nice, easy drinking porter with a good deal of flavor. Very drinkable, and something I'd certainly pick up again."
"I'm glad I live in PHiladelphia and get can this anywhere."
"single from Whole Foods, Fair Lakes, VA"
"Don't drink and review."
"Some pretty interesting stuff going on here, not expected in an English porter but definitely not off or unpleasant. That said, I didn't enjoy it as much as I would've a more conventional porter, but was intrigued to have something off the beaten path. Pretty tasty & smooth nonetheless, I could see going through 2 or 3 of these until the novelty wore off."
"d - A decent porte; nothing great but not bad at all. I thought it was a little lacking in taste and pretty mellow, but still pretty decent. I'd try this again but not go out of my way to."
"Poured into a Shaker pint. Clear deep dark walnut color with red highlights, close to being black. Very thick creamy tan head that ever so slowly goes to a thick foam with pretty good lacing. Not much in aroma to say very neutral. I enjoyed the taste, a good example of a porter. I thought it was going to taste more stout-like but I was pleasantly surpised. Big carbonated bubble tickled the tongue. Hints of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts. Very drinkable. All in all a pleasant experiance."
"D - Again, I love the concept... Beer brewed using the recipe of the founding fathers... However, I'm very glad brewing has come a long long way since then... An average at best porter, that is drinkable in a bind, but there are many other offerings to choose over this one..."
"This is drinkable, but nothing I would go out of my way for. Pretty average."
"Pours very dark brown, almost black, pretty much opaque. Nice slightly tan head, but somewhat poor lacing. The aroma was not too pronounced. I got some dark sugar like sweetness and a hint of roastyness but I was a little underwhelmed. I was, however, pleasantly surprised by the taste. The first thing that struck me was that it did not have as much roasted malt and coffee like flavors as some other porters. I could taste some nice burnt sugar sweetness that mingled with the malt, as well as a touch of bitterness. I found it to be very pleasant and thought that while the body was a bit fuller than many other porters, it was quite drinkable. I definitely found this beer to be more than just a novelty, and recommend it to those who find most porters a bit too roasty for their taste."
"Drinkability: This is easily a session porter for me. It should make its way into my porter line up. Not as good as some of the porters i have had, but its a good winter drinker."
"Overall I thought this was a decent porter that was a bit on the sweet side and suffered a bit from the fruitiness as it warmed. Don't avoid but don't seek out."
"Full body with light carbonation. Very smooth."
"Mouthfeel: Very smooth, quite boozy"
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle with little to no head and very small carbonation retained. Appears dark brown as I would expect. Smell is very inviting of roasted grain or almost like a burnt oatmeal. Cocoa sweetness is upfront in the flavor. Although it finishes a little more watery than I would have enjoyed. Drinkability is okay."
"Pours a nice dark brown color with some decent head, but no real lacing. Nice burnt grain scent with good hints of coffee. Nice taste, a robust porter with nice coffee flavors, but also a bit of an alcohol kick that took a bit away from it. Goes down smooth, if not creamy."
"Pours a dark cola color with a khaki color head that is about one finger in size. The smell is of roasted malt and some chocolate notes. The taste is of a sweet chocolate malt and a slight toffee malt as well. Flavor is sweet but not sugary. The mouthfeel is of medium bodies and smooth. The drinkability on this beer is high, there is nothing to make you dislike it. Overall its a nice abv for a porter however, the slightly higher content is well masked and doesn't detract from the flavor."
"Drinkability: A very tasty porter this one. I'm already thinking about opening another and even if I don't I'll be having another one fairly soon. I've always wondered if the General gave up very much when he swore off drinking any British brewed porter in favor of those brewed in the American colonies. From drinking this beer I'd say he didn't make much of a sacrifice limiting him self to American brewed porters. I could easily limit myself to drinking only this porter if I had reason to do so."
"Had some good spice undertones. Would definitely have again, but not something I would seek out specifically."
"D- very good porter with more drinkability then the more heavily bodies porters im used to. excellent little tastes of complexity."
"Drinkability: I am very impressed by this beer. At 7% abv, it packs lots of flavor and great drinkability. Maybe it's the molasses that makes it so smooth."
"Notes: A tasty porter from one of our founding fathers. It went quite well with dessert,but I would not have more than one."
"poured dark with thick tan head. smelled of roasted hops and chocolate, fairly complex. thick body/heavy feel, again can really taste roasted hops with suble hints of the molasses. finished a bit dry. drinkability is the only downside to this satisfying porter"
"Pours an opaque color. Nice dark, coffee, raison like malts with a bit of dryness, finishing with that bone dryness, which is nice. Medium bodied, maybe not as creamy as a a bunch of other porters I've had, but still a decent interpretation of the style. Very easy to drink, bit of lacing, not much head, unlike true great porters, Great Lakes leading the way. I would give this multiple shots and can be sessionable."
"I could easily have a couple of these but alas this is my only one."
"Very dark brown beer with a slowly fading head that laces the glass.Aroma and taste are molasses and chocolate.This beer is as smooth as silk and feels like heaven in your mouth.Lightly carbonated and overall a good beer.I see no reason why anybody would not want to try this."
"I could put away a few jars at the bar pretty quickly with one.. and the 7% is so well hidden i might regret it later, but it is that easy to suck down. I would make this an everyday type of beer if it were local to me."
"Tasty stuff here. Appear dark brown without much head. Medium body and carbonation. Fairly sweet and dessert like. Finishes with a dry roast and fruity, chocolatey sweetness. This beer is big on the chocolate flavors. It tastes like milk chocolate on a ligtly burnt chocolate chip cookie - in a good way. It reminds me of another sweet porter favorite of mine, Middle Ages Duke of Winship, a must try if you like this beer."
"Drinkability/Overall Impression: I was hoping for more complexity in this beer, especially for a porter. I found the taste to be somewhat one-dimensional, with the raisin/fig/prune flavor to be the only real discernible flavor outside of the malt, which had a difficult time asserting itself. I have a hard time panning this beer, though, considering it is a historically accurate recipe and brewing knowledge and techniques have improved dramatically over the past 230 years. The history behind the beer and the fact that Yard's didn't deviate from Washington's original recipe is to be commended. The simplicity of the beer makes it very drinkable, though I would probably reach for another brew if I were in the mood for a hearty, belly-warming porter, as this one didn't quite have the body I was anticipating."
"D-Surely drinkable but the amount of carbonation turned me off a bit. Surely slighty better than average...tasty once you can get passed the gas!"
"On tap at McGillin's... pours a deep brown, with ruby highlights... or lowlights, whatever way you look at it. Thin tan head that falls into a coating over the top. Some lacing. Smells like dark chocolate, mollasses and toffee. Tastes mostly of chocolate malts, some honey, and toffee. Mouthfeel is velvety and has somewhat of a smokey bite. This is a smooth porter that could go for a few pints."
"Pours a perfectly clear ruby hued brown. Smooth malty nose. Flavor is nice and smooth with a thick malt presence. Nothing showy or crazy here. It's just a nice smooth profile. Good liquid feel. Easily drinkable. I like this porter. Nothing crazy, but a pleasure to drink."
"Being 7%,you cant really taste it but if you have too many you will feel it.I have had better porters but I would'nt turn this one down."
"D: Sorry George, this one's a dump."
"Overall: A good drink. A bit sweet, and a little more bitterness from the hops would help to balance this beer out. The 7% is hidden very well, and as I have seen from other yard's beers this is an easy drinker that I could sit down with friends and polish off a few."
"Scott"
"Pours a dark brown, near black color with just a touch of head on top that dissolves very fast. Nose is an excellent surprise. Lots of strong roasted malt, some chocolate and coffee. A little spice as well. Taste is likewise solid. Lots of roasted malt up front. A little biting on the tongue. A touch of chocolate as well. Feel is good and nearly cream, although maybe a touch thin. Overall, this was a pleasant surprise from Yards. Tasty and filling."
"Flavor is of roasted malts, molasses, and light hops. Made an excellent finish to the meal paired with a delicious apple cobbler."
"D - An easy drinking dark ale. An average porter, but has its redeeming qualities, also. I would try this again, it is a drinkable porter."
"Tasty and creamy. A bit too rich to be ""sessionable"". (Fine considering abv, which is fairly well hidden). But, a very nice sipping brew. It went well on its own, with the turkey pot pie and the chocolate dessert I ate at City Tavern."
"Yards General Washington Porter poured a dark brown color with a tan, creamy head. The head stayed for the duration of this rich porter. The smell was indicative of what awaited me in this glass of American History; a rich, malty nose with just a hint of molasses and only enough hops to balance. The taste was great. The front is malty and sweet with just a hint of molasses, but not at all overpowering. The finish is smooth with the roasted malts coming through nicely. The mouthfeel of this brew is smooth and enjoyable, and it does nit sit heavy or leave a poor aftertaste. This beer is quite drinkable, but at 7% ABV caution must be taken to not overindulge! Cheers!"
"This poured with a thick, deep-tan head with decent retention. The nose was roasty, malty, and a bit chocolaty. The color was a deep, dark brown with garnet highlights. The mouthfeel was very full and I experienced a lot of chocolate and charcoal flavors on the tongue. The finish was more chocolaty than anything else. I found this to be a highly pleasant beer and would recommend it as a finish to a romantic evening (especially around Valentine's Day)."
"Value beer. A simple porter, black, roasty, headless, bit of carbonation. Medium or less mouthfeel. Molasses as it warms. I could still drink a bunch of this. A touch of chocolate malt. Coca-cola aftertaste, more sweet than bitter, which arrives in the finish."
"D - Pretty good. It is a bit strong for a porter, but easy to drink and definitely something I wouldn't mind having again."
"Drinkability-with it not being to rich or sweet, this ones east to drink and enjoyable on a cool day."
"Cheers!"
"To smoky for me, but not too bad."
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is less than medium bodied. The carbonation is low. This beer has no off smells and aside from a astringent taste that is not really anoying this is a pretty nice beer."
"Pours a rich, murky brown/black color with a 1/4"" tan head. Aroma is roasted coffee, caramel malts, and molasses. Flavor starts off with a nice blend of coffee and molasses, with notes of roasted malt and caramel evident mid-sip, before it all rinses away for the cleanest finish I've ever seenin a porter, with a little alcohol warmth present afterwards. Mouthfeel is very full, and thick, but it's finish adds to it's drinkability. This beer is probably better kept for the winter though....which is when I'll seek it again!"
"Yards has a winner here. Worth getting a six at least, and a case if you like the style."
"We spoke with chef/proprietor Walter Staib who told us it took quite a few trials and errors to reduce the ABV down to its present 7% and get the taste right. That, they certainly did! Very good porter!"
"Had better, had worse, and a week from now, I might forget I had this. There's something here, don't get me wrong, but it's a bit of a chore to really assign flavor to it, and the aroma is equally so-so, just a bit more than average. That said, the ABV is big enough that what it's not delivering in flavor works against looking this way again. Sure, it goes down easily enough, but it never gives much to remember it by, and I tend to want to recall the high points of what I've had to drink. Not enough high points here, though."
"Poured a very deep brown color with reddish highlights. Moderate creamy off-white head that left slight lacing as the glass. emptied. Smell is toasty with very strong notes of dark bitter chocolate. Taste is reminicent of strong black slightly bitter coffee. Some nice ripe dark fruit taste is also present. The alcohol is slightly present, but really compliments the other flavors in the beer. Finish slows a moderate bitterness, mixed with coffee and chocolate and leaves a truly excellent taste in the mouth. Nice and creamy. A perfectly balanced beer. Excellent."
"D: Good could have a couple but not too many due to sweetness."
"Drinkabilty OK...one is enough."
"Drinkability and Overall: Delicious!!! Try it."
"cheers..."
"Aroma is very muted, but some mild sweetness of indeterminable origin comes through. Dark brown with a large creamy head. More sweet than roasty, but it has sort of sulpher tinge to it rather than any molasses I have had. Some mild cherry fruit flavors in the finish. Doesnt have that roasty wholesomeness I expect froma porter."
"Drinkability: This is a beer that I wish I liked better and perhaps it merits another taste to see whether the unusual finish was a function of an off bottle"
"Drinkability is good a different kind of porter then I usually go for but the flavors are good even though they are more subdude and not as big and in your face as others."
"Overall, this is an excellent porter and one that hides it's alcohol content very well."
"Poured a deep crimson with deep brownish tint with a thin light brown head that didnt stick around long,black strap molasses is big in the aroma along with bursting fruitiness,very effervescent.Molasses and bitter chocolate notes hit up front maybe a touch of orange finishing with light earthiness to keep things in check.My only complaint and its a small one is that it seems a bit thin but the alc% is hidden well and is quite drinkable.I bought it on Presidents day for the fact it was GW but it is a real fine beer what ever day you buy it."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The frothy carbonation just saves this beer from being too watery in the mouth... it is light, make no mistake. At 7%, it's not quite the session beer but it really is an easy drinker. Closing my eyes, I can imagine our forefathers gathered together at City Tavern discussing the important issues of our country, while enjoying the nectar of the future President's creation."
"The mouthfeel is pretty good, but there is an odd roughness to it around the tongue. The taste is complex, and I could see myself drinking a few of these in a row. Solid, but different from most porters."
"This looks good, a nice dark brown color,and the carbonation is crazy.I know this is bottle conditioned and the head is like four fingers.The smell is alittle slight,but with fruit and some roasted malt .The taste is OK,some roasting flavor,it almost tastes like coffee with prunes or raisins.This doesn't taste bad,but it is very different for a porter. I'm a little intrigued.Every time I take a sip I taste a different flavor.Sometimes medicinal,some chocolate,fruit, and some coffee.The label says this is an old recipe.I'm going to give this another try,maybe I'll grow to like it more and more."
"This could be the last Yards beer I ever try. Almost every one I've had has the same damn off characteristics. Someone at Yards needs to completely dismantle the brewery and sterilize everything. They've got bugs in the works. If, for some reason, these are the flavors and smells they are seeking, they need a new recipe writer, or a new yeast, or something. Their stuff is just weird."
"[edit] The bottle says there is molasses in it. this may be another factor in the unique flavors I get. Nicely blended and not dominated by molasses at all."
"Drinkability is ok but I was hoping for more, as I do enjoy it in the bottle."
"This offering from Yards, one of their Ales of the Revolution, pours a clear dark brown with a thin head on top and very little carbonation apparent. The aromas are of roasted malt along with hints of vanilla, dark chocolate and bitterless coffee. Taste was a mix of charcoal and smooth coffee. Not bitter, but smooth. Very smooth ending with some dryness in the front of the mouth. A bit more watery than I would've liked. A pretty good beer."
"Flavor is way too roast-malt acidic. Yes- there are other beer-like characteristics and some coffee and chocolate-like qualities, but the acid dominates to the point of being a real detriment. Something could have gone wrong with the bottle conditioning, but I just didn't enjoy this beer."
"Felt a bit too experimental and homebrew like to fully enjoy. A different take on the style to be sure."
"Drinkability: This is quite a good brew with a big roasty character. I would say that this beer got a bit better after aging a year. It's still just as good with BBQ though. This beer is one of the many porters that borders on a stout. Wisely they still call it a porter and it represents the style quite well."
"Pours a very dark brown with a huge almost overflowing cream head and excellent retention. Nose is rather light, some coffe, sweet milk chocolate, maybe a little sour milk. Taste is much better, sweet molasses, chocolate, caramel, toasted malts, slightly wine taste. Mouthfeel is extremely creamy with a nice dry finish. This is a really nice tasting porter, I'd buy it again."
"Poured a nice dark color with a long-lasting mocha head. Surprisingly little aroma - what there was seemed to hint at sweet chocolate. Flavor profile was puzzling - almost no roasted malt flavors other than the barest coffee at the very end. The predominant flavor was an oddly wine-like flavor, both sweet and tart. The combination did not harmonize well. Bottle notes that the beer is brewed with molasses. Perhaps I'm simply too acclimated to beers brewed in the traditional English style and the American interpretations to be able to appreciate this reincarnation of the Colonial ""Philadelphia"" style."
"Overall-I haven't had many porters but I must say this is the best one I've had, full of flavor with a nice mouthfeel and balance and while it isn't exactly complex it's certaintly one to pick up."
"Last swigs: Strong Porter! Rye & toasted coffee. This bottle saved my visit to Rembranbdt's on a pubcrawl. This was the best beer they had."
"Overall, a good porter, very robust and quite enjoyable. It's kind of hard to believe that this is George Washington's real recipe. A darn good beer"
"much thanks to KafkaESB."
"Overly carbonated, took forever to pour this one! Very thick, pillowy head that is lightly coffee colored. Rich dark bark color to the beer. Nice lacing as I drink it. The aroma is fully of roasted malts and nuttiness. A little coffee in the background too. This is a very tasty beer! Loads of molasses, roasted nuts, toffee and some espresso too. Just enough hop presence for a nice balance. The mouthfeel is very creamy and the carbonation just seems to stick to the toungue."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: A decent beer; reminiscent of homebrew experimentations gone right and wrong. The final sip was far better than the first with this brew. Theres something a little funky about every aspect of this one, yet it is imminently endearing. Id love to try this one on tap, and Id probably even get it again in the bottle despite all of my complaints. Its certainly different, and in a good way!"
"Deep, deep chestnut brown in color. No real head to speak of. Low aroma-some roasted malt and a slight cinnamon spiciness. Good flavor-roasted malt,slight chocolate flavor and an almost vanilla finish in the backround. Nice body-maybe a touch beefier for my liking. A very drinkable brew-my only complaint and it doesnt affect the overall review of the beer is the price. $9 and change for a six pack is a bit stiff-might be my locale but Ive seen it this price in 3 states-overall it doesnt warrant that price. A damn good porter but theres better ones out there for cheaper."
"Poured a bold-looking deep and dark, dark brown, almost black in color with a nice-looking dark tan head that not only lasted but also managed a good ring of lace multiple times on the pint glass. Aromas are heavenly...all sorts of requisite porter scents: cocoa, dark & bitter chocolate, toasted malt, coffee beans fresh from the grinder. Flavor sees the same profile as the nose, but there's a sweet twang that I would attribute to the molasses. Not as big as I'd expected, but still flavorful. Ends with a dry and bitter chocolate-red wine flavor. A little on the thin side but still drinkable."
"poured with a light coffee colored head and a clear mildly dark brown color. smooth creamy in the aroma with an underlying sugary sweetness and a dry burnt quality. everything is fairly subtle and subdued/balanced wcept for the lingering sugar sweetness that stands out amongst everything. smooth mouthfeel, kinda weaker and bit thin than most porters. chocolatly witha subtle sweetness and a burnt malt aftertaste. still very good and definetly not to be passed up."
"I don't think I'll be drinking the second one I had."
"Deep dark brown appearance. Thin light tan head with little retention. Lace is negligible. The aroma is funky and barnyard....yes, like a lambic to an extent. Seemingly there's some cherry as well. And some chocolate malt as well. The taste is funky as well. I think something has gone awry here. But not in a real bad way. It tastes o.k., maybe a little off putting, but not dumpable and in no way does it taste like a porter. It's sweet and cherry like. A little husky astringency. Dry finish. A titch sour, but not disturbingly. A little acidic. Not something I'd reach for again if this is what it really is supposed to taste like."
"($1.79 / 12 oz.)"
"I'm wondering if the unique Yards taste is in the yeast. As noted it works best in this ale-> the best I've had so far. Also as noted I love the historical references and attributes. George Washington on the label and cap. Bravo to Yards."
"Tried this one, as it was recently stocked at my local beer store and I really like their Love Stout.A very interesting take on the Porter style. What got my immediate attention was the fact that this Porter did not have any telltale bitterness, very soft in the finish. Another positive attribute is that the 7% abv was not overwhelming by any means; just a creeping warming feeling. I don't know about the claim that this beer is based on General George's recipe, but I really like this one and will buy a bunch more. The next time I'm in Philly, I will be sure to stop at City Tavern to seek this one out on draft."
"The taste is warming with a fruitiness(cherry?) and a bit of yeastiness. Some coffee notes as well in a quite drinkable brew. No loud hops which was fine for this malty dark fruity ale. I think the yeast brought out a bit much ester, but overall it went down easy and would like to try it on draft."
"The hidden alcohol, and lack of bitterness combine with the fruity flavors to lend this a pleasant drinkability. Very offbeat for a porter, but this is said to be modeled after 18th century recipes. The Founding Fathers imbibed well, if this brew is a true indication of their favorites."
"I expected a much larger beer from the outgoing smell and alcohol content, but this one is smooth and balanced. Taste is small and sweet in the mouth, notes of coffee, caramel, and toasty graham. Clean and controlled finish: smoothness with a late touch of mineral hops. Goes down fast and smooth."
"Another pleasing beer furnished by kmpitz2. Very nice label. Pours a dark brown color (a little light for a porter) with a small head that sticks around. The aroma is full of a dark fruity-ness as well as some coffee/chocolate. Interesting flavor. Not what I expected. Lots of caramel flavor and a good malty character. This seems a bit thin for a porter, but it's still a great beer although a bit odd."
"This beer pours a deep dark brown with finger of head that sticks around to cover the beer. The nose is interesting. Theres some fruity grape in the nose, not what I was expecting, but intriguing. The flavor is also interesting. There is a sweetness and a roasted bitter that lingers after swallowing the beer. The label says there is molasses in there. That may be some of the oddness I find in this beer. The mouthfeel is thick, but there is something I don't like about the feel. Drinkability suffers from the odd flavors. I guess its the original flavors in Washingtons beer, but its not on my list of things I want in my beer."
"Looks more like a dark ale than a porter. Thin-looking body, light showing through the liquid at the edges of the glass. Beige head doesn't really rise, but dissipates quickly. Aroma is toasted malt and cocoa, plus some hops shining through. Mouthfeel is full and round, leading to a quick initial roasted malt and cocoa flavor, but morphing almost immediately into bitter coffee and a cherry tang. Cherry flavor lingers, as does a tannic talc feel. With each successive sip, the cherry builds and adds a bit of raisin. The tangy flavor unfortunately overwhelms the malt profile."
"12 ounce bottle, lacking any freshness dating, Boo. Pours dark chocolaty amber, light for a porter. Tan head, with decent retention. leaves long stringy lacing. Nose is maple syrup. Medium bodied and fairly chewy. Malt sweetness upfront, more maple, caramel and some light coffee notes.Sweetness linger and leads to a dry and slightly bitter finish, with some chalkyness in the mouth. Eh, so so porter"
"Drank this one at cellar temp from a chalice. Deep reddish brown color with a frothy tan head that lasts and leaves considerable lacing. Smelled fruity with hints of alcohol in the background. Malty sweet taste to start with a long dry finish. This is a rich tasting flavorful beer. Not sure how true to the style it is but I will drink and buy again. This is a beer to savor whilst reading or surfing the web."
"12 ounce bottle. A very nice drinking porter."
"This pours out a reddish-brown color that lets some light through and has about an inch of light tan head that quickly dies down to a cap of bubbles. Leaves a good bit of lacing rings around the glass that sticks around for a while. Smells more of a brown ale then your typical porter, with slightly sweet malts coming though with light scents of coffee and chocolate. Sweet malts and a bit of nuttiness are the main factors in the taste with a good amount of hops as well. Overall a very mild taste and smell. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but well carbonated and the drinkability is not hindered by any taste of alcohol. This is a decent beer that seems more of a hybrid of a porter and brown ale that is a little too light on the flavor for me."
"Pours a translucent deep copper/brown color with a sustaining light tan colored head. Dark berries and roasted malt mostly in the aroma with some decent hop characteristics, too. Treacle-like weetness and thin mouthfeel, yet complex on the palate. Earthy and grassy in the hops, and peaty, bark-like and mossy in the malt. Dark berry-like and slightly tart in the finish. Good 18th century style interpretation. Moderately drinkable."
"Tasting note: If you mix Yard's George Washington and its Thomas Jefferson, you get George Jefferson, which is what Yards entered in the Skullsplitter Barleywine Fest I was at a few months ago. I like this mix more than George Washington alone, although not as much as TJ alone. The hops and malts are better balanced in the mix than in the GW, and there's more complexity."
"ng"
"Extremely dark reddish-brown body with a light tan head thats light and airy. The head fades to a thinner, wetter coating. The aroma is slightly sharp, with molasses and brown sugar. Its got the same dark sugary flavor with a mild fruitiness. Slightly chocolatey and nutty. Really interesting beer that is bigger than what I had expected from a porter."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 1"" of tan head, which made for excellent foamy lace over the slightly reddish, dark brown brew. Aroma is slight and somewhat generic, not the dark malt aroma one would expect. Taste is dark malts, balanced well with an appropriate amount of hops. Not overdone with the darks like some porters do, and not overly sweet either. Nice. Mouthfeel is great, and drinkability is as well."
"Head is light tan, big at first then slowly dies down into a creamy film that stays for the rest of the beer. Dark brown colour filled with ruby highlights. Fruity smell splashed with malt. Unexpected fruitiness up front, this caught my off guard and made me fear I did not like this beer. Thankfully I'm quickly given a healthy blast of malt. The chocolate in background teases my confused taste buds. For some reason this beer is not very pleasing on the palate. It's hard to say why. I wouldn't go out of my way to try this again."
"Backwash: I wasnt nearly as impressed with this as with the Jefferson Ale. While not a bad beer, it lacked the punch and complexity that the Jefferson Ale did. Maybe I expected too much from this after having the ale, but this was a bit of a disappointment. I cant really find anything to fault, nor can I single out any particularly salient aspects (except perhaps the mouthfeel and carbonation). However, Ill definitely give this another try, and will look forward to enjoying the rest of the series."
"Light smell of chocolate malt but not that much detectable nose. Dark opeque ruby color in the glass. Brew settles to a tan sheen (not quite a head) on the surface of the brew. Robust malty sweet regal roasty malt taste with nice overtones of cocoa and roasted hazelnut. A brew that tastes better than it looks and smells."
"Pours an odd brownish red...maybe I expected darker. Barely any head though some bubbles cascading to the top show it does have some decent carbonation. Soft aroma of dark chocolate and used coffee grounds. Mouthfeel is kinda thin, and the flavor is severely lacking. Tastes like...well, nothing. Just begins to hint at some nutty, chocolate undertones, but doesn't build into anything at all. Maybe this is how beer tasted when Washington lived...if so, we've come a long way. Maybe that's what Yards is shooting for, I don't know. Kinda reminds of the flavorless bread I ate one time that I was told was a clone of what soldiers during the civil war ate...I think it was called ""hard tack"" or something. Ughh. 7% ABV can be felt somewhat afterwards as it is slightly warming, but not really detectable in the flavor. This is pretty disappointing. Yards brews some good stuff, but this isn't included."
"Thanks to beerluvr for another quality beer."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thin lacey off-white head. The aroma is decent. It has a warm, roasted, dark malt scent that reveals it's elevated abv. . The taste is average. It has a rich malty flavor that goes down easy, but finishes warm and bitter. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is an average porter. I like the concept, but I'm not sure I can drink too many more of these."
"Pours a dark coffee/caramel with a small tan head. Not quite opaque, but about as dark as it could be while still allowing some light. The aroma is sweet, roasted, and ever so lightly tinged with alcohol. A heavy mouthfeel that is full yet not filling carries a taste that is simply wonderful -- nutty with anise highlights and hints of roasted coffee, all blended into a slightly sweet and satisfying flavor. There is just a suggestion of alcohol in the aftertaste, cutting down slightly on the drinkability score -- but a very nice brew none-the-less."
"It is a dark brwon to black in color. The aroma has some roasted malts and dark fruit in the nose. It is really smooth and sweet. Not overly sweet, but it is on the sweet side making it an excellent close to any meal. There is chocolate, fruit, and caramel notes. In finishes with a long molasses taste. It lingers for some time and coats the mouth well. There are so many flavors going on, that i did not notice the alcohol. It is comforting."
"I really enjoyed this unique and rich porter."
"The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Very flavorful as the roastiness lasts well after swallowing. This is a little heavier bodied than other porters but is extremely drinkable. Great brew."
"taste: fine porter flavor, a bit thin though, little bit of plums going on in there? can taste the slight hint of molassas very pleasant taste although not as robust as I'd like"
"Appearance: Deep ruby amber brown with a huge creamy tan head leaves behind thick even patches of lacing, nice. Aroma: Some sharp fruit sweetness wrapped with the dark roasted malts that breed some chocolate and mild coffee tones with a kiss of alcohol noticeable. Taste: Creamy edge with chocolate roasts and alcohol infused plums or something of that nature, very robust porter nice offering from our friends at Yard's. Mouthfeel: A medium bodied ale but a bit thin for a porter, decent carbonation. Drinkability: Decent overall nice robust flavor solid in the aromatics, I just want a little more body to chew on."
"The taste is a wave of flavors, all dark. First some roasted, then dark wood, like burnt pine cones (if that makes any sense). There is some caramel flavor too but without the sweetness. Its more pronounced, more full, like a charlestown chew. The sweetness never gets to overpower the beer because the roasted grains come in again and again. The finish is medium and dry. Thats the only thing stopping me from having alot more. Excellent!"
"Thanks to Francisweizen for throwing this in!"
"First off, I like porters. This is a good one. It pours a dark, reddish-brown with a medium tan head. There is a lot of lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is of chocolate, coffee, and smoky malt. The taste is similar but more on the coffee, malty side. It has a bitter hint that I like (sometimes porters can lean toward the sweet). The sweetness that is there has a hint of dates or currants. The beer is a real mouthful. It is thick and creamy and goes down smooth with a little bite at the end. Definitely worth more than one."
"Very dark brown in color with a small tan head. A distinict vanilla aroma dominates the smell. The taste has none of the afore mentioned vanilla charactistic. It starts out hinting at a roasted malt but quickly goes away from that to an almost sour finish. I know that vanilla flavors in beer are not high on alot of peoples list but I think if it had a little of that in the flavor to match the aroma it might have increased my enjoyment of this beer."
"I like the idea behind this 'historic' brew, based on an authentic recipe, even if the style is not one of my favorites. Color is dark reddish-brown, with a medium-small tan head. The aroma is fruity, almost fruitcake like, with a hint of olive. The fruity character shows up in the flavor of this beer, which finishes on a noticeably sour note. This one would be nice for sipping in the evening after dinner, especially on a cold winter night."
"Pours a very dense head that is creamy and thick, whipped up like a meringue - unique and going nowhere. The beer is dark brown and transparent with red edges. Thick lace and stain all over. Smells of dark roast, some soda-like quality (think Dr. Pepper), and some quite nutty scents. Taste is sourish at first, almost-cherry like, with dark toasted flavors slowly creeping over. Slight molasses notes, too, with a dregs of coffee flavored, drying finish. Full-ish mouthfeel. Looks better than it tastes."
"A solid porter, with plenty of character, just a little ""cherryish"" for my tastes."
"was hoping this one would outdo the jefferson ale and it certainly did. pours a nice dark brown to near black colour with a medium sized off-white head which is rather creamy looking. smelled sweet with malt coffee and chocolate hints throughout. earth tones also were apparent. so far, this looks and smells more like a tame stout to me than a porter. nonetheless, no complaints thusfar either. different = good in this case. the taste here is rather solid with an ever so slightly smoked coffee and malt flavour dominating a steady bitterness throughout. just the right amount of carbonation provides for a silky and smooth brew that is quite drinkable. much more enjoyable than the good but not great jefferson tavern ale. different, but tasty."
"Overall, a damn good porter. I'll buy this the nex time I'm at Jon Ron's in Wall Township. I highly recommend!!!"
"Comments  I received this gem as part of the Christmas Exchange put on my xlperro this year. I was fortunate enough to draw jcalbi, and this is just one of many terrific bottles that he sent my way. A big BA thanks for this Porter."
"Definitely not your typical porter, which in this case is a good thing. Don't get me wrong, I love the roasty malt porter, but it's nice to try something different. Bravo to Yards for bringing out the beers our ancestors would be drinking at the time of the Revolution, and I certainly look forward to trying the others as well."
"This was a different and tasty Porter from the folks at Yards. The appearance was black with a nice, light tan head of foam. The aromas were of dark fruits, hops, dark roasted malts, alcohol, and more. The taste was very fruity, with hops and roasted malts in the forefront as well. The fruitiness was a bit overwhelming and in my opinion, it shadowed the potential chocolatey goodness and deep roasted flavors that this porter could have had. The mouthfeel was medium bodied to thick and the drinkability was decent. This was almost like a dark version ot the regular tavern ale."
" I don't see how this beer costs the liquor store I work at about $12 a six pack, but it is a pretty good beer."
"Pours with a nice light tan head settling over very dark red liquid. Nose is lightly malty with some anise notes in it. The taste is sweet at first, with some brown sugar tasted then roasty malt kicks in, very slight alcohol note pops up as well. Finishes with a rich mouthcoating maltiness. A bit out of the ordinary yet nicely done and quite enjoyable."
"Presentation: Bottle conditioned; big 1 liter, flip top bottle with George Washington on the label. Poured from the bottle the body is a nice dark brownalmost black with a short creamy tan colored head with great retention. The aroma is nicely roasty with little hop presence. I enjoy the nicely sweet malt profile, hints of chocolate & peanuts. There is little to no bitternessMouthfeel is super slick and creamy. The General Washington Porter is only available in Philly at the City Tavern in historic Olde City... good brew."
"A slightly hazy, very deep chestnut body appears almost black on the bar but reveals russett highlights when held to the light; and it maintains its creamy, light tan head throughout almost the entire glass. Beautiful creamy rings and short sheets of lacing eventually deteriorate to wide splashes but also add greatly to its appearance. The nose displays dark cocolate and yeasty fruitiness over a touch of lightly roasted malt and just a slight hint of hops in the background. Some alcohol is evident but never detracts from its appeal. The body is medium; and its very fine and natural (bottle conditioned) carbonation leaves it exceptionally creamy in the mouth. The flavor sets forth a balanced combination of light yeasty fruitiness, chocolate, caramel, and a cusp of delicate roastiness. It finishes drying with a quick note of alcohol followed by some roasty dryness and a clear caramel and molasses flavor. It's not really complex, but there's enough going on that you might miss some of it the first few times around; and it is rich and inviting, calling you back for another sip. A decent beer that deserves a try although I think its alcohol might be a bit limiting in overall drinkability."
