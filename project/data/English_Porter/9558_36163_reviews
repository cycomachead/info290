"This is a great unique local brew.  Malty with hints of whiskey.  Refreshing this time of year."

"O-A non-Imperial barrel aged beer that maintains enough whiskey flavor to keep my interest. It has it's flaws but it's a tasty beer overall."

"About as close to a session barrel-aged dark beer as you can get. Really impressive how they can cram in a ton of flavor to a lower abv porter. Of course, it's not as thick or bourbon forward as a lot of big BA stouts and porters, but that's not what it's trying to be at all. For what it's trying to be, it's damn near perfect."

"O - I feel like they did a very good job crafting this as a low ABV barrel-aged beer. It is often the case that I would like a barrel-aged beer, but I'm reluctant due to the high amount of alcohol. I could see this filling in nicely, especially if they put it in 12 oz. bottles."

"On Tap at the brewery in Troy, NY. Pours dark brown with long lived off-white head and nice lacing. Aroma is of coffee, caramel malt, dark fruit and whisky. Body is medium and smooth. Caramel malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, whisky and hint of hops combine on the palate. Finish is long and semi-dry. Interesting tasty porter."

"Overall: A badly crafted beer that suffers the most at the hands of the mouthfeel and minimal time given in the barrel."

"Overall, this is a decent beer that I prefer on draft. Interesting for a 5.75 percent ABV porter--but not for a whiskey-barrel beer. It's nice to have a barrel-aged beer that's not of a hefty ABV, though."

"O-First review of a cask beer, it did have the notes of being on cask but it seemed to add an oak flavoring to the beer above all else."

"Cheers."

"O - I liked this one a lot for never hearing of the brewery. I was skeptical of a barrel aged beer with such a low ABV, but this was a tasty, easy drinking beer."
""
""
"O - I have lived in Troy for 4 years and haven't had this beer until today. I have wasted 4 years."

"The body is medium, and the highly alcoholic aspect manages to stop short of astringency, which can be a problem with aging a beer in a barrel of something like whiskey. It's just crisp enough and flows just smoothly enough to make for easy sipping."
"Got this as an extra from a trading partner. Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. This brew pours a 95% opaque black two finger head, thanks to a SDTM pour. The bourbon's faintly noticeable, but there's a decent amount of coffee in the nose. The taste isn't domintated by the bourbon, but it's there, and it's a nice addition. There's a lot of coffee, vanilla, and toasted malt in the flavor. Really a good mix. The mouthfeel is a bit on the astringent side, but it's not overbearing. Finishes off smooth, leaving the bourbon behind. Very decent beer. Would have again."
"D - Surprisingly solid beer. It'd be hard to drink a bomber of this on your own, even though it's fairly low in ABV. Still, it was plenty enjoyable for 8-12oz."
"Light whiskey notes over modestly roasted malts, with a lingering sweetness that never gets overpowering, really tasty. Light bodied, this goes down much easier than many other whiskey barrel aged beers, I guess this treatment works very well for a porter."
"Picked up a growler while visiting family. This is one of my favorite beers, by far. Poured in a pint glass, the beer is an extremely dark brown coloring, almost black in the deepest points. The brew starts with a thick, chunky, airy head that starts around three inches and quickly settles into a thin film. Good level of bubbles throughout the brew, and there is a decent lacing on the glass. Nose is extremely robust and round, with a strong mocha chocolate backbone, a hint of coffee bitter, and a good overtone of rich vanilla from the barrel aging. Flavor is coffee initially, with a rich, creamy vanilla and whiskey hue, and a touch of bittersweet chocolate. Body stays rich and creamy throughout, with a great feel for the flavors. The aftertaste is roasted coffee and chocolate, and the finish is creamy and slick. Tremendous brew!"
"This beer changes tastes depending upon the brand of ""whiskey"" barrel pieces used. IMO opinion, the first year was the best. Still, this is one BIG, wild and uneven beer, Kudos for your successful experimention. One of Brown's best."
"O- A pleasant beer. Has nice characteristics from the whiskey but still maintains the boldness of a porter. Well crafted."
"Overall, this might be the closest thing to a barrel aged session beer I've ever encountered. The short time spent in barrels here added just a little extra dimension to a pretty good tasting base beer. This isn't even in the same neighborhood as the more gigantic barrel bombs I'm familiar with. A nice diversion, especially if Brown's wanted to bulk up the body just a bit."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability â€“ Well-balanced, complex, and quaffable. For those that love barrel aged beers, but get tired of the high ABVs, this may be the beer for you. Browns gets it done yet again."
" A must try for porter fans, get a bottle if you can. I will buy another bottle next time I am in the store. Even though I am trying to stay away from bombers this one is easy on the wallet and very drinkable."
"Notes: A very drinkable BA-ed porter. It succeeds at both being a decent porter and at integrating the barrel flavors without white-washing the beer. Not an ""extreme"" barrel-aged brew, but a nice one for sure."
"D- So smooth and easy to drink! Perfect match for a sweet honey BBQ'd glazed Venison tenderloin, or Maple/Pecan glazed turkey breast!"
"Steve"
"The beer is sweet but not cloying and the bourbon notes are strong causing anticipation of some heat, but it isnt there. Nice smooth brew that any true malty will love!"
"D/M: drinks smoothly but slightly heavy, warms the pallet, very slight carbonation tingle, overall loved the brew"
"D - Very drinkable beer. Has a nice balance of feeling light but still having a lot of flavor and not feeling empty at all. The flavors are very well balanced and overall the beer is very smooth."
"Drinkability: A sipper. The oak is done well. It is not too overpowering as to lose the porter taste. This beer is incredibly smooth. One or two per sitting, but a very good job."
"Pours a nice deep dark almost black colored brown with a small yet ample off white head. Really had a nice porter look to it. There is also a big whiskey barrel aroma, some scotch like vanilla characters in it that make this really inviting for the winter and colder months. Big maple roasted malts also. The flavor is a little off and tastes a bit of infection because of a sour cherry component it gets. Really nice on the palate as it's light bodied but off balanced and disjointed on the flavors. I get a little bit of whiskey and porter like qualities, but the cherry flavor puts this off. Tangy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice as this is perfectly low carbonated as should be a porter. I would like to revisit this, especially in troy at the brew pub fresh and on draft. Nice beer but not doing it like I thought it would."
"Probably wouldn't seek this out again, but it was a decent beer. A little light in body and whiskey for a barrel aged porter. Worth a try though, and not terribly expensive"
"Poured into a chalice a nice black color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some nice whiskey notes, chocolate/toffee. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, nice touch of whiskey, some chocolate/toffee. Medium body. Drinkable, this is my first brew from Brown's and it's pretty tasty. Don't see too many Whiskey Porter's in the under 6% ABV range. Glad to have gotten a chance to try it."
"I had to try this because I heard it won some award at TAP NY this year. Maybe I'll try it again some day. Perhaps I just had a young bottle."
"Biggest surprise of the season for me, this ""local"" beer is incredible."
"D - Well though certainly not bad the taste and drinkability are hurt by the sour notes that I am getting. Would love to try this one the way it was intended!!"
"Mouthfeel is fine, dries up nicely, but the medicinal flavor does not leave me wanting more. I've heard good things about this brew, and like their others, so I suspect that I got a bad bottle."
"Off tap at the brewery this beer was a nearly opaque brown color with one finger of tan head. The retention was good especially as a collar and the lacing scattered. The aroma was surprisingly subtle, roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate and a hint of whiskey barrel wood. The flavors were damn tasty, full or roasted malt, chocolate malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, toffee, whiskey, wood and hints of vanilla. The sweeter notes lead me to believe the whiskey used was bourbon and the bite of the bourbon really came through. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation perfect."
"D: Very good."
"The bourbon or whiskey appearance would normally indicate that this would be a sipper rather than one to drink straight up, but the flavor from any barrel aging was so subtle and smooth that this was easy to take down. A very nice beer that was enjoyable and which I recommend trying."
"Mouthfeel is a bit on the lighter side with solid carbonation that makes this what I would call a session barrel aged porter. Quite tasty and I would imbibe in this more often if I was able to purchase it locally. Thanks to dmeadows for the opportunity to sample this tasty brew!"
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/4"" tan head over the slightly cloudy mahogany brew. What head there is lasts nicely, with slow-falling lace. Aroma is sweet and boozy. Taste is a quick whiskey character to start along with ample dark sweetness, dark fruitiness in the middle, and closes with a lightly boozy tartness. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, with the tart prickles, and drinkability is good. Very interesting brew, I'd like it better without the tart, but there it is."
"D: We split the bomber and one could easiely drink this by themselves. Massive taste with a very reasonable ABV. Well done Browns."
"This beer is delicious, I can't wait for more, thanks to my sister for bring some home"
"I absolutely love this beer. Brought it back from a trip to Brown's in the bottle. Amazing. It has a nice dark brown color with a beautiful caramel colored head. The smell is sweet with the hint of whisky over dark roasted malts and a nutty aroma. The taste is exceptional. It is a complex flavor with the taste of roasted malts and a hint of whisky and nuts. The aftertaste is excellent - very dark roasted flavor with a clean sweet finish. Very good mouthfeel and very drinkable. This may be Brown's best beer they make."
"On nitro tap at The Man of Kent in Hoosick Falls,NY,poured a deep dark brown nearly black with creamy one finger slight off white head atop.Aromas were pretty light just light vanilla and roasted notes,the oak flavors come out more in the flavors somewhat woody and highly roasted the vanilla tones are tame wich I like its not like so many wood aged beers that are just overpowered with woody flavors.Creamy easy going down mouthfeel a nice beer to have with lunch,I was hoping to have on cask but nitro was fine."
"Incredible smoothness and delicious flavor just begs for more. Nice subtle complexities. Easy to drink and is versatile enough to accompany a burger, have with desert, or just enjoy on its own."
"Unfortunately, I had to dump most of the bottle because it's a big glass of butter. Probably much better right from the brewery. Cheers!"
"This is a great beer. It is an English Porter that is aged in Jack Daniels barrels. It pours nice and dark with no head. The aroma has some light roasted malt but a good amount of sweetness as well. The flavor is great and is similar to the aroma. There is a good roasty flavor with a good smooth sweetness from the whiskey. It is on the upper end of medium bodied from the sweetness and has great drinkability."
