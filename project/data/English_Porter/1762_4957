Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. I think this is a pretty good brew.

Poured pitch black with a three finger very light tan head that subsided to a one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and tobacco. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, and tobacco. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation (an almost creamy texture). Overall this was a pretty nice brew. It was almost spot on for the style it was targeting without a doubt. The flavors on it were very light and refreshing, which might have been its only downfall. I was really hoping for more robust flavors in this one going into it, but it did well with what it had. The mouthfeel on this one was quite excellent though. A definite must try if you get the chance.","thagr81us","Aug 26, 2011"

I can drink this by itself, and I think it would go really well with beef or pork. Not really a sipper, and indeed, it went rather fast - but - I think it becomes better once fully warmed up and a mix of American and English porter styles comes out.

Taste is mostly caramel and milk chocolate with an earthy hop bitterness that balances well. Hints of molasses and toffee underneath. Just a hint of dark roasty malt bitterness.

4.2,5,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Following the pour, a very dark brown brew resides, with a thick head of ecru cream that lingered for a few minutes before mostly abating. A syrupy smell issues forth, though enough roast comes through to keep the nose from getting too sticky. The taste brings things back to Porter Reality, with more body, more roast, with that nice licking of molasses. As heavy as it initially feels, it lightens over the course of the drink, leaving an impression of medium body that allows for good drinkability.","TMoney2591","Feb 02, 2010"

The flavor comes across as smooth and chocolately, along with some notes of roasted barley. There's a wonderful silky texture on the tongue. I didn't pour it into a glass, so I didn't get the full aroma or appearance, but nothing about this beer tells me I wouldn't want to have it again!

You can sense once the toasted barley, the hint of hops, almonds (or some other kind of nuts), and an astrigent taste of coffee. The body is medium and the coating of the mouth leaves a sticky film.

The flavor is dominated by burnt malts, but there's also coffee, bitter chocolate and hops, and a sweetness akin to an oatmeal stout.

Balanced with robust flavors of chocolate and caramel. Easy to drink and enjoy more of in the future.

The lace clung nicely all over the glass as if fearing for it's life. It had a nice burnt brown look with deep ruby undertones. The nose was deep bodied, smelling of freshly roasted coffee and a nice cherry, dark berry hint. Only upon taste do you find the nice dark chocolate over fresh coffee taste. The roasted malt dominating and a very slight fruitiness that fights off any hop taste. At the end, you have the tiniest taste of hops that just slightly sours your mouth but quickly fades away, begging you to come back to it quickly.The mouthfeel is medium-light to medium, yet creamy smooth and crisp. I would prefer it just a bit heavier on the mouth, and just a bit less carbonation though. The nice smooth aftertaste lends quite well to the drinkability and I would easily be able to have it as a session beer or even just with dinner. This is a great example of American porter that balances complexity with drinkability. It's easily right up there with your Anchor and Sierra Nevada porters.","Bleedingshrimp","Jul 24, 2005"

I am also able to pick up some chocolate like aromas mixed with a nutty scent; over all this is a very pleasant smelling brew. Has a pronounced roasted malt flavor that highlights coffee along with chocolate tastes. Finishes with a slight sweet flavor that seems like it would be expected based on the overall flavors of the brew.

The nose displays deeply kilned malts with a roasted edge and a deeply caramelized, almost burnt-sugar side; as well as some rich nuttiness that includes pistachio. The body is medium and it's gently crisp across the palate with a fine, moderate carbonation that softens as it warms. The flavor is slightly richer than the aroma indicates, but the character remains the same with the addition of a solid bitterness that takes the whole thing just a little bit further. A faint fruitiness appears upfront, coat-tailed by a rich nuttiness that's immediately jumped on by bitterness (think peanut skins). The caramelized sugars become apparent as it warms (caramel, molasses, burnt sugar); and its coffee-like roastiness develops towards the finish. Dark caramelized sugars, nuts, a touch of baker's chocolate, and bitterness linger in the aftertaste. Quite rich and enjoyable but without being heavy or cloying.

Some slight bit of sweet malt comes back again in the aftertaste. Not much hop bitterness to this brew.

The aroma of roasted malt and molasses is your first introduction to this porter. Taste is very, very good. Malt with a touch of earthy tones coffee, maybe some chocolate? A very easy Porter to drink. I recommend this one to all!","Stubbie1","Jan 02, 2003"

3.93,-1.8,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Pours black with dark ruby hues poking through.  Rocky head with clinging lace.  There are coffee notes all over this brew.  Starbucks, not Dunkin Donuts.  Fruity esters fight their way out and a bit of chocolate as well.  Good mouthfeel, finishes dry.  A good porter, but I couldn't see myself drinking a bunch of these.  Nor do I drink a bunch of cups of coffee at a time either.","pbrian","Jul 31, 2002"
4.48,12,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,5,"One of the blackest porters I have ever seen.  Pours super black with a nice brownish head and decent clinging lace.  Very nice roasted flavors combine with a nice smooth bittersweet chocolate flavor to make this a very interesting aroma.  Taste starts off with some nice roasted malt flavors before going very chocolatey.  Bitter, roasted coffee then comes back to combat the chocolate sweetness and balnce the brew.  The extremely smooth and creamy mouthfeel of this beer make it exceedingly drinkable as well as one of my favorite porters to date.","Murph","Jul 18, 2002"
