The aroma is mild with some dark roast notes and a little hint of alcohol sweetness. The taste is very roast forward with just a hint of earthy hops on the finish. There is a little silkiness to the mouthfeel and a slightly lighter weight to the body. An above-average porter from the first president.","delta490","Apr 18, 2014"

Roasted malt and sweet toffee aromas with earthy, herbal hop and dark chocolate notes beneath. Medium bodied with a creamy smooth feel and soft carbonation.

Its not as roasty or chocolatey as it is straight up sweet with molasses and toffee. It has a little more in common with barleywines than it does stouts, indeed. I won't try this one again, but it was definitely an interesting change of pace for porters.","Stevedore","Dec 20, 2013"

3.99,4.5,4,3.75,4,4.5,4,"A deep, thick black appearance with a decent tan head that settles a bit but holds on for a healthy trail of lacing. The aroma offers relatively mild malt with nuances of charcoal, coffee and grass hops, but relatively polite overall. The flavor jumps in with smooth cocoa-coffee and maybe a touch of diluted licorice. Impressively gentle on the palate yet offering a pleasant grassy hop edge that blends tastefully. I don't think it's too much more complex than that, but this is very solid and highly drinkable. It's medium bodied with a satiny, smooth feel including delicate carbonation. Very much recommended, an any time porter!","Durge","Apr 22, 2013"

But it seems to me that this is a pretty broad category in beers and allows for such differences. I'm going out on a limb here and calling this 5 out of 5.

4.03,5.5,4.5,4,4,4,4,"The bottle states that it's color is a deep garnet... and I find that I rather agree! You can see the light coming through towards the bottom of the glass... a beautiful color, and it has a mountainous, pillowy head that sticks around for quite a while, never fully receding. Aroma - Roasted malt, toffee, vanilla cream, milk chocolate, and perhaps the faintest bit of hops. In the flavor I am picking up coffee, molasses, and definitely some hop bitterness in there. The beer coats the mouth very well and tingles as it goes down. The ABV is imperceptible, however. Overall I would recommend this. The bitterness to the finish adds a ruggedness to the character of what would have been an average porter.","Neorebel","Mar 24, 2012"

Robustly roasty with a pleasing blend of grainy bitterness and acidity, complemented by flavors of cocoa, a little caramel and fruity yeast, this is quite an enjoyable porter. Very dry, this beer has flavors of unsweetened cocoa. Drying on the finish with a mild bitterness, this beer is light in body, quite excessively carbonated, leading to a not wholly welcome carbonic acid bite and lightening the body to the point of wateriness. Despite it, though, there's a nice fruitiness that also lingers. The alcohol is fairly well hidden too. All told, a pretty decent and enjoyable porter. Allowing the carbonation to settle down greatly enhances the moutfeel, and I'm adjusting my score up by half a point to reflect this improvement.","DefenCorps","Jan 02, 2012"

This porter tastes (in order of flavor intensity) like sweet molasses, burnt sugar, Christmas spices, dark chocolate and general roastiness. Unlike any porter I've ever had.

4,4.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Poured from a standard 12oz brown bottle into a SA perfect pint glass. Appears a dark brown color with some reddish hints and a lighter brown color around the edges. Tanned head initially presents itself about a finger strong but receeds fairly fast to just a thin layer of lace upon the top of the beer and slight lacing is evident along the glassware. Very pleasant dark roast aroma with scents of chocolate and some suggestions of dark fruit like plum. Taste is the dark roasty malt with flavors of bitter dark chocolate and a warming and noticeable flavor of alcohol. Slight bitterness from the hops is there in the flavor as well towards the finish. Medium feel with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is one very drinkable and enjoyable porter. Lingering flavors of chocolate and dark fruit almost like plums or rasins is left lingering in the mouth. Overally quite good and one of the better beers I have had from Yards. Well done.","stakem","Apr 09, 2010"

The first thing that struck me was that it did not have as much roasted malt and coffee like flavors as some other porters. I could taste some nice burnt sugar sweetness that mingled with the malt, as well as a touch of bitterness. I found it to be very pleasant and thought that while the body was a bit fuller than many other porters, it was quite drinkable.

I found the taste to be somewhat one-dimensional, with the raisin/fig/prune flavor to be the only real discernible flavor outside of the malt, which had a difficult time asserting itself. I have a hard time panning this beer, though, considering it is a historically accurate recipe and brewing knowledge and techniques have improved dramatically over the past 230 years. The history behind the beer and the fact that Yard's didn't deviate from Washington's original recipe is to be commended. The simplicity of the beer makes it very drinkable, though I would probably reach for another brew if I were in the mood for a hearty, belly-warming porter, as this one didn't quite have the body I was anticipating.","Phillyduke","Feb 12, 2008"

Perhaps I'm simply too acclimated to beers brewed in the traditional English style and the American interpretations to be able to appreciate this reincarnation of the Colonial "Philadelphia" style.","Brent","Apr 28, 2005"

The aroma is fully of roasted malts and nuttiness. A little coffee in the background too. This is a very tasty beer! Loads of molasses, roasted nuts, toffee and some espresso too.

Good flavor-roasted malt,slight chocolate flavor and an almost vanilla finish in the backround. Nice body-maybe a touch beefier for my liking. A very drinkable brew-my only complaint and it doesnt affect the overall review of the beer is the price. $9 and change for a six pack is a bit stiff-might be my locale but Ive seen it this price in 3 states-overall it doesnt warrant that price. A damn good porter but theres better ones out there for cheaper.","lackenhauser","Feb 11, 2005"

Aromas are heavenly...all sorts of requisite porter scents: cocoa, dark & bitter chocolate, toasted malt, coffee beans fresh from the grinder. Flavor sees the same profile as the nose, but there's a sweet twang that I would attribute to the molasses. Not as big as I'd expected, but still flavorful. Ends with a dry and bitter chocolate-red wine flavor. A little on the thin side but still drinkable.","OldFrothingSlosh","Feb 01, 2005"

What got my immediate attention was the fact that this Porter did not have any telltale bitterness, very soft in the finish. Another positive attribute is that the 7% abv was not overwhelming by any means; just a creeping warming feeling. I don't know about the claim that this beer is based on General George's recipe, but I really like this one and will buy a bunch more.

The label says there is molasses in there. That may be some of the oddness I find in this beer. The mouthfeel is thick, but there is something I don't like about the feel.

Mouthfeel is full and round, leading to a quick initial roasted malt and cocoa flavor, but morphing almost immediately into bitter coffee and a cherry tang. Cherry flavor lingers, as does a tannic talc feel. With each successive sip, the cherry builds and adds a bit of raisin.

Smells more of a brown ale then your typical porter, with slightly sweet malts coming though with light scents of coffee and chocolate. Sweet malts and a bit of nuttiness are the main factors in the taste with a good amount of hops as well. Overall a very mild taste and smell. Mouthfeel is a bit thin but well carbonated and the drinkability is not hindered by any taste of alcohol.

Just begins to hint at some nutty, chocolate undertones, but doesn't build into anything at all. Maybe this is how beer tasted when Washington lived...if so, we've come a long way. Maybe that's what Yards is shooting for, I don't know. Kinda reminds of the flavorless bread I ate one time that I was told was a clone of what soldiers during the civil war ate...I think it was called "hard tack" or something.

4.08,6.8,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"A slightly hazy, very deep chestnut body appears almost black on the bar but reveals russett highlights when held to the light; and it maintains its creamy, light tan head throughout almost the entire glass. Beautiful creamy rings and short sheets of lacing eventually deteriorate to wide splashes but also add greatly to its appearance. The nose displays dark cocolate and yeasty fruitiness over a touch of lightly roasted malt and just a slight hint of hops in the background. Some alcohol is evident but never detracts from its appeal. The body is medium; and its very fine and natural (bottle conditioned) carbonation leaves it exceptionally creamy in the mouth. The flavor sets forth a balanced combination of light yeasty fruitiness, chocolate, caramel, and a cusp of delicate roastiness. It finishes drying with a quick note of alcohol followed by some roasty dryness and a clear caramel and molasses flavor. It's not really complex, but there's enough going on that you might miss some of it the first few times around; and it is rich and inviting, calling you back for another sip. A decent beer that deserves a try although I think its alcohol might be a bit limiting in overall drinkability.","NeroFiddled","0"
