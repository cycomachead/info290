Taste follows with light malt and dark fruits. A modest dark ale, light body, mild corn aftertaste. These Ridgeway beers have a nice presentation and generally taste good, but have really muted and bland flavor levels.","LiquidAmber","Beers"

Aromas are mild, with a solid coffee tone throughout. Some lighter malt and hops scents come off on the nose, also. Flavors are dry and crisp, which is a great representation of the style. Good blending of dry roasted coffee and mild chocolate malts, with a smooth character and light, smooth body. The aftertaste is rich and slightly roasted, with a dry feel to it. Slow, dry finish, leaving a good linger of flavors behind. Good brew.","GarthDanielson","Jan 02, 2012"

The beer poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle with a deep amber color that you can still see through. There was a small slightly off-white head. Smell is of peat, roast and malt.

Lots of sweet roasted malts in the aroma along with sugar and a nip of laid back hops. The bodu is in the medium range and also rather smooth and creamy.It definitely espouses a pleasant bitter flavor but it really reminds me of most sweet British ESB's which always seem to have this soft water characteristic and lots of approachable flavor.","puboflyons","Nov 27, 2011"

It really has a dark chocolate taste, with some raisin bread qualities. The aftertaste is where you really taste the alcohol. At 6.0 abv, the alcohol taste should be nonexistent.

There seems to be a mix of porter characteristics and Strong Ale characteristics even as eary as the nose. There is a big malty aroma showing sweetness, syrup, and chocolate; as well as strong fruity (cherry), booze, and caugh syrup strength. Flavors reinforce the nose with strong chocolates, cherries, berries, grapes, plumbs, spicy hops and a dominant alcohol sensation. The body is full and rich, thinned only by the alcohols and tart fruit flavors and mild astringencies. Finishes with a firm malt / fruit character, a fermentation twang, and alcoholic warmth. Interesting brew that offers more than just typical Porter expectations.","BEERchitect","Aug 10, 2006"

The taste comes around alright, though. Roasty, slight butterscotch flavors with some woody notes & hops tagged onto it..not bad. Considering the pitiful mouthfeel, I'm surprised this one could carry the flavors as well as it did. English ales seem to have some kind of commitment to being watery, so the body was no real surprise here.

I am not quite sure about this beer, is it off, if it is it is only lightly so. It could just be an idiosyncratic English yeast strain.

Not malty or biscuity, no hints of cocoa or coffee, molasses or fig. That's what it's not, but what is it?

Rather roasty and chocolate malty, with a little amount of fruitiness coming through. Tinge o' chicory. Pretty nice porter, it certainly does fall into the realm of an English one (6% yet tastes thin). Lowly carbonated, but not off; other than the lackluster head.
