Mouthfeel provides a decent body with sharp carbonation. Overall, a pretty run of the mill porter. Some decent flavors, but nothing to keep me coming back.","homebrew311","Apr 10, 2012"

Starts off a little chocolaty rand then fades to more of a burnt malt / coffee / smokey flavor. There is also a touch of grain in the mix as well. Medium body with average carbonation goes down smoothly. Pretty decent porter. Nothing to crazy, but sessionable nonetheless. Definitely worth a shot.","birchstick","Nov 14, 2011"

3.88,8.7,4,3.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle ($1.79 a single at Liquor Barn), bottled on 9/22/2011. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours mostly dark brown with some ruby red tints along with an inch tan head that stays around a while. There's a good amount of lacing, too. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, nuts and a bit of dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, grain and nuts. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth, a bit slick, goes down easy and has moderate carbonation. I think this is a good brew, I'd buy this more often if it was available in Ohio. Too bad for me it's one of Schlafly's seasonal beers and not available year round.","bluejacket74","Oct 29, 2011"
4.12,15.4,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Overall Impression- Tasting this Cherry covered Espresso Bean flavor was so crazy! Not sure they were going for this but it came across when I went to enjoy it.

3.85,7.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"This is a very solid everyday porter that Schlafly should have available year-round. At 5.4 ABV (per the Schlafly website) and refreshing quality, this could be a standard session porter.","jkrich","Oct 22, 2011"

3.79,6.2,3,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Easy drinking porter, not great but solid & just another example of how Schafly turns out on point examples of styles when it mass bottles them. Need to do a side by side with their coffee stout, pretty similar I'm thinking..","russpowell","Oct 07, 2011"
