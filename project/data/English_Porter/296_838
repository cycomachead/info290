The aroma is a bit vinous with some dark fruity aromas. Burnt sugars, light chocolate and coffee playing supporting roles. The flavor is a touch lactic with vinous and dark pitted fruits melding into toffee, caramel, and a hint of smoke. Medium to thin body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet burnt mouthfeel. Interesting beer. This is not really what I think of when I think porter, but it was good enough to keep me interested through the glass.","johnnnniee","May 04, 2013"

The former are big, loud, avuncular porters that offer a muscular and meaty handshake; St. Peter's, on the other hand, is slender and subdued and understated. As porters go, it's a great beer on a lighter scale. The aroma has enough roastiness and coffee to immediately qualify for the style, but it's got the British twang of hoppy oranges without actually tasting like oranges. It's very smooth and a tad thin, but I didn't find it so watery as others have. I detected a touch of scotch in both the aroma and the taste, which was a pleasant addition.

Mouthfeel is nice and viscous, but could use a little more carbonation IMO. Drinkability is good for the style, but not mindblowing or anything to write home about.

St. Peter's recently switched bottle shapes from the lovely ovals to boring round stumpy bottles (common UK bottle shape) for most of their beers. But kept the same green color.

I think the best trait this porter has is the exceptional balance between ingredients. A strong roast flavor comes through without the acrid burnt flavor typical of near black ales. A true porter that doesn’t try to be a stout. Unfortunately the lighting was horrible at The Mercury so I can’t comment on the appearance other than the unique bottles are quite an interesting sight. The mouth-feel was just thick enough to let you know a lot went into making the beer without making it filling, and the hops were just bitter enough to prevent the drink from having a sweet aftertaste. A beer that is good for a short session or with dinner. Again, the balance with this one is quite good. I hope to try one again some time.","AAvgerinos","Apr 11, 2007"

The first thing you taste is a bitter edge of the porter but it rolls on to your tongue quit smoothly and has a semi crisp taste by the time it gets to the middle of your tongue. It has a dull slightly bitter after taste that reminds me of some sort of candy and only has a hint of alcohol.","vickersspitfire","Mar 06, 2007"

What a mild porter, from a style which was a thick working mans grog meant to be both tasteful and filling to this pale approximation. I still think the attendant at my local beer store must have popped it open, drank a third and topped it off with water. still I doubt I'll spend the money to prove him guilty","chuckm","Feb 06, 2007"

Though the mouthfeel is strangely thin for a porter, I cant say I mind as the flavor sensations are complex, ranging from a bitter coffee taste of hops to hazelnut qualities on the tongue. Just the right amount of carbonation helps it all go down. The label on the very attractive bottle contends that this is a porter in the classic mold, and if that is the case then Im sad we dont see this style around much anymore. The lightness tends to allow more appreciation of the taste. My drinking companion comments its a porter that doesnt force you to choose between a beer and dinner, which I find nicely sums up both of our feelings.","Gattopardo","Feb 02, 2007"

The pour showed a lighter and more opaque hue than found in today's Porters-- somewhere between rich amber and brown. Though nice head retention, the beer also shows over carbonation and lack of protiens. The aroms confirmed the fear of part-grain character, though turns out more malted barley than the nose revealed. Along with a slightly better than average maltiness, the flavors also showed a moderate bready, lightly grainy, cola-like flavor that fell short of Brown Ale status. The feel was a bit too light, pushing the grain emphasis. Finished with that cola flavor and feel. Though the beer was not a disaster, I was expecting better in terms of rich chocolate, malty, richness and fuller, firmer body.","BEERchitect","Jan 31, 2007"

Not much on the nose, except for a bit of toasted malt. The head was mid-sized and faded quickly, though it did lace well. The mouth after a while, the taste faded into a bitter-ish, dark coffee.

Big butter aroma, mixed with highly roasted malts and an impression of dryness. That dryness is not borne out by the palate, however. It starts off with sweet coffee, rich buttery cream, and a touch of dark fruit before finishing with a slightly sour note that's reminiscent of beers made on a Yorkshire square.

I guess the shape of the bottle is what drew me to the brew, odd old type of a bottle. The brew it self poured to a deep dark brown color that was more close to black than brown but the light that was able to filtered through gave it ruby highlights. The head on this brew was very small and had a cream tan color that left some lacing. I guess the lack of a head could have been due to my careful pour, maybe a little to careful? Over all it is a fair looking brew. The aroma is pretty good with highlights of chocolate, roasted malt along with an earthy scent. The taste had a sweet taste at first then broke to a stronger malt taste highlighted by a accompanying hop taste that went well with it adding a degree of spice. Over all it is a pretty nice tasting brew. One thing that I did notice is that it is a dry brew and it also feels almost watered down for a mouthfeel? Not a bad brew and one that I would have again but do feel that there are other better Porter examples. Definitely am intrigued buy the bottle and would like to try some of the other brews they offer.","Stimack","Nov 28, 2004"

Dark tan head rises and falls in a minute. Nice thick lacing on the glass. Heavy aroma, malty but pruney with lots of spicing and slight medicinal qualities. Thick and chewy mouthfeel. Flavor is interesting in its depth and layers -- more prunes, fortified wine, dark roasted senses, a seeming layer of ashy bitters at the finish. Aroma keeps backing up the flavors in the mouth. Interesting rendition, lots of flavors to note that imply more alcohol than is really around. Reminds me of what an historical Porter may have tasted like, tavern owners blending all sorts of brews and even adding strange and unexpected flavorings for balance and color. The drinkability is kind of subjective to me, its a little different.","ADR","Nov 15, 2004"

It has a rich and dry black malt flavor with a lingering grainy aftertaste. It has a nice chocolate flavor that would be enhanced it the mouthfeel were any better. The mouthfeel sucks. It is a full bodied beer with very low carbonation. This porter has good aroma and flavor, but because the mouthfeel is lacking, the drinkability suffers.

The mouth is a tad small though and causes a bit of excessive splashing on the pour. Nevertheless, the beer comes out fine, as the head - which is a tad small - is composed of fine small bubbles. The beer itself is a bit light in color, more of a dark brown rather than black, which is fine for some porter styles. The aroma seems a bit one-dimensional: its all coffee, roasty malt. But thats OK, in this case the simplicity is nice and helps you focus on the beer itself. The flavor is a tad bitter from roasted burnt malts, not too sharp, with a faint hint of malt in the background. The aftertaste seems to accentuate the bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little thin, with some slight astringency (think: tea). But overall this is pretty nice, maybe not my favorite porter but not bad either.","KroMagnon","Sep 14, 2004"

4.18,8.6,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Dark brown in hue, black in the middle, shiny ruby around the edges; the color is attractive. A beige head topped the beer, it was a finger in height on a harder than normal pour. The head retention was fair, after a moment it faded to a foamy cap and then to a loose collar. The subsequent lacing was spotty. The nose is soft; it smells like chocolate milk with a dash of coffee in it. At the back are notes of astringent roast. Overall the bouquet isnt very complex. However the smells are quite inviting. Then I smelled it again, after a few moments, and I got a suggestion of tobacco leaves, husks, and some earthy hops. Really working to pick up the details paid off. Lovely. Still, the potency is too low. The palate is awesome. This is a tasty porter. It is much roastier tasting that the nose leads on. Tricky bastard. There is a good amount of astringency, charcoal, charred husks, bittersweet chocolate, distant lactose sweetness, and earthy flavors. I am deeply impressed. The finish is long and charred. I bet this beer would really match nicely with some KC-style BBQ. The aftertaste is equally long, very roasty and even a little sweet. I really like this porter! It is not the most complex porter Ive enjoyed but this is one of the yummiest. Sometimes there is nothing wrong with being a straight shooter. Medium/medium-full in body, low carbonation. The mouthfeel is pleasantly filling. It is a meal in a bottle. This is a very drinkable and agreeable beer. I really enjoyed it.

The taste is of chocolate, coffee, sweet malts, and mild hop bitterness, in fact most of the bitterness seems to come from the dark chocolatey black malts rather than the hops.

3.17,-17.7,3,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"Notes: Not too robust, very sweet flavors with slight roasted bitterness. Good beer. Might be a good intro to darker flavors.","beerinator","Aug 28, 2003"
3.48,-9.6,4,3.5,4,3,2.5,"This is a very characteristic English-Style porter, comparable to Fuller's in many ways. While this in a good brew, I prefer my porter's with more body.","Mitchster","Aug 24, 2003"
3.82,-0.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"A little light for my liking -- very see-through and more reddish than brown/black. Looks like a weak dopplebock. Decent head but no real retention. There's a lot going on in the nose here. Very roasted and sooty with some s'more chocolate. Lightly roasted malts, coffee character, and a semi-sweet chocolate are covered by a hoppy finish that balances nicely. A little light in color and in body. A good porter but not outstanding.","marburg","Aug 10, 2003"

3.77,-2.1,3,3.5,4,2.5,4.5,"This one poured a medium brown color with no head on it. Smelled of weak malt and hop mix. Taste was quite good but also quite weak. Roasted wood comes to mind here. Floral hops are in the background and come through by the middle. Other flavors are too weak to detect but they are there. Finishes roasty and leaves me wanting more. Like the color, the body was too thin to be a porter. This could have been really good with a nice bold body to it. However it was quite drinkable, I feel like I could drink a whole lot of these in one night . . . (but not at how much they cost!)","granger10","Jul 28, 2003"

3.46,-10.1,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"There was very little head on this beer which had a nice dark brown colored body. The aroma has a hint of coffee in it. Some carbonation rolls off the tongue, but not much. It has a pleasant taste indicative of the porters I have drunk, but it was not as good as some of the other Porters. Still it is a beer I can drink all night long.","TheDM","Jun 29, 2003"
4.12,7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"St. Peters Old-Style Porter comes in a unique, olive green, flask shaped bottle. The info on the bottle say that this is a blend of mature old ale and young light ale. It pours an opaque, deep brown that allows a little ruby to show through when held up to the light. There is minimal head with poor retention and a just little lacing. The aroma is sweet, healthy and earthy, like fruity chocolate. The flavor is sweet yet roasty and full. Overall a delicious porter.","bobinverted","Jun 20, 2003"
3.62,-6,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A brewery reintroducing us to an old method of blending old and young beers. A good one for the curious, as the results are an aquired taste not unlike a lambic. It is a reddish brown brew with a tiny tan head. The aroma is very complex with notes of molasses, malt, raisin and licorice. It has a tangy malt and hop flavor with a rich malt finish that's dry and acidic like a red wine. It reminds me of some of the flavors I noticed in Sam Smith's Imperial Stout. Give it a try even if just to support this type of experimentation.","jeffboo","Jun 03, 2003"

3,-22.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Translucent brown color. Some roasted malt and chocolate is noted in the aroma as well as the flavor. Malt backbone is lackinga bit thin. The roasted malt lends a faint bitterness thats passable I guess. Is this old style? True to style? I dont know. But Ill pass next time. Theres too many others that are far better IMHO.","John","Jan 28, 2003"
3.35,-13,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3,"Drinkability: Average. This is an interesting brew, having been brewed to old porter standards, where an aged, dark ale and a young, lighter ale would be mixed to create porter. Having said that, I don't think I would go back to this one often.","MJR","Dec 28, 2002"
3.43,-10.9,4,3.5,3,3.5,4,"Not a fan of this beer for the style it claimed to be, it seemed to have real taste of chocolate and caramel in the beer from it's natural grains. It was as if they had actually added flavors artificially to mash. It had a small and fleeting head and seemed a bit watery and flat on mouthfeel. It tasted was sweeet and finished tha same as it tasted to start. My friend had one and said it was real good and compared it to a local Beer in Bru Room @bar in new haven, CT " damm good expresso stout" which is the greatest beer I have ever had in a brew pub, but I'll review that one at a later when I finish undercovering all is many complexities. . My point I guess about my friend is that he knows nothing about beer [after making those comments] or life for that matter and he was drunk. This beer was just average and one dimensional. I will not buy this beer again,","OatmattStout","Nov 24, 2002"
3.12,-19,3.5,4,2.5,3.5,3,"Pours a deep amber witha small head and leaves some lace. Fruity aroma with hints of dark chocolate, yeast and a buttery scent. A bit thin for a porter but did have a smooth mouthfeel. Taste started roasted malt and grain with a little spiciness. Finishes with a somewhat sour twang that is undesirable. If the aftertaste was better, this would be pretty good. Could have been a bad bottle, so I may give it another shot.","Lupe","Nov 19, 2002"
4.29,11.4,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer is a very dark, almost black, tea-like color.  It presents a very thin, shallow head and a magnificent roasted grain aroma.  Also, the smell has some floral characteristics and a little alcohol can be detected.  The taste is of bitter coffee, with burnt and roasted grain flavors.  Overall, the beer is very dry, however, and nicely complex.  The finish is a lingering bitterness.  Great beer...I liked the bottle too.","Suds","Oct 31, 2002"
4.44,15.3,4,5,4.5,3,4.5,"Oily black w/ rusty accents, pours with almost no head.  Strong dark chocolate with hints of roasted coffee on the nose.  Taste is roasty, malty and sweet with prominent bitter chocolate and coffee notes.  Very thin mouthfeel, finishes rather brief with a faint lingering smokiness.  Drinks very smooth and easy with blatant yet pleasant flavor.","jmatthew","Oct 22, 2002"
4.1,6.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Notes: Old style porter to say the least, A blend of old and new beer. A very well structured beer with lots of flavour going on … a sharp cheddar and whole grain crackers pairs extremely well with this one.","Jason","Aug 25, 2002"
