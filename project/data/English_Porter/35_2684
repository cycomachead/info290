My first sampling from a beerfest a few months back was creamier in mouth feel and had a slight Russian Imperial ""whiskyness"" to it. My most recent one was weaker, less flavorful. Looks good at first pour with a decent head but evaporates quickly. Mouthfeel was more like an IPA than a porter. Just average and I was expecting much better.","Murphious","May 24, 2013"

The taste of the beer is slighty burnt or roasted in the beginning and settles down in the aftertaste as a sweet and elegant mix of the roasted malts and the honey. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side for a dark brew.","Knapp85","Apr 21, 2011"

The head is fluffy like a marshmallow, with wonderfully fluffy retention and plenty of lacing adorning the glass. Aromas are acidic at first whiff, with sweet chocolate and roasted coffee malts coming in to balance it all out. Flavors emphasize the heavily roasted malt. Biscuit malt expected from an English style porter, complete with the acidic coffee characteristics. There is a nice balance between the malt and hops, and the honey is undeniably present. There's high carbonation at first but it seems to mellow out with a bit of time and warmth...or maybe I twirled the glass one too many times? Nice residuals left behind from a rather light body.

The smell is mostly honey but it smells like bitter malty honey. The taste is something getting used to. At first I was offput with the strong coffee and chocolate taste of a porter with sweet malty honey but it grows on you. By half glass it starts bitter porter, sweet honey. with a hoppy finish.

Honey and chocolate are the first aromas to hit my nostrils. Sorghum molasses, raisins, coffee bean, and a hint of citrus linger in the background scents. Oh yes, I see why it is called Honey Porter. As with the smell, honey and chocolate are in the forefront, and with every sip and slide around my mouth comes another flavor; caramel, roasted wheat, coffee, lime, and hops.

The malts and honey provide the sweet backbone with the roasted dark chocolate coffe flavors far in the back ground. Very smooth. Nice chewy mouthfeel goes down very nicely. It would be better if it had more of a hop bitterness and some more complex roasted smokey notes to balance the sweetness. The sweet is in the driver's seat the whole way.

Flavor is malty and dark.. not much honey characteristic, in fact I would never guess it was supposed to be a honey porter unless told so.

A foamier head would have nailed the 5 in my opinion due to the contrast of colors. The honey and the malts are very mildly coming out in the nose and that is about the strength in the flavor. While you kind of want more, you also fear that more honey would not be enjoyable. I think they were likely limited by ""good taste"" with how far they could push it here. There are some grainy flavors at the finish. The mouthfeel is pretty thick and reasonably enjoyable. There is a bit of a honey aftertaste, and again, I don't know that they could do anything different with this and avoid tipping the balance.

The aroma is of roasted malt and a hint of chocolate and smoke. A big roasted flavor with bitter chocolate and a hint of smoke which is somewhat offset by the honey presence. The feel is fairly light for a porter and perhaps a touch over carbonated. The honey adds a nice smooth feel and balance but the roasted bitterness wins out in the end.

On the nose a nice mix of honey and caramel malt. The beer is well balanced-slight bitterness followed by the honey sweetness. A full bodied beer that is easily drinkable, a nice combination. The beer does not taste as sweet as I feared, a darn good beer.","bonkers","Oct 06, 2008"
4,9,4,4,4,4,4," This porter poured a deep brown accentuated by subtle reddish highlights. The head was a creamy tan that was quite attractive but faded quickly to lace. The aroma was of nice roasted malts. Flavor is roasted malt and of course the honey. There is a flash of bitterness at the end but the honey counters with a rich sweetness. The buttery and thick mouthfeel pairs nicely with the sweet and roasted flavors. Overall this is a nice little package but not a wow! experience. Couldn't see myself drinking 2000 calories of this baby unless I was a really hardworking Porter.","N8TheGreat","Oct 05, 2008"

Aromas of chocolate, brown sugar, and honey burst forth, with only a little roastiness. Flavor is roasty throughout with honey undertones and a dry finish. Body is rather thin, and that's the only real flaw here. Carbonation is good and drinkability is excellent. Almost a great porter.","illidurit","Oct 04, 2008"

The nose is malt forward followed by sweet honey and espresso. The taste is sweet and honey filled, what is extremely unique about the beer is the mouth feel which resembles a refreshing beer while sucking on one of those honey stick candies kids eats. Really unique, but works well. Not the most drinkable beer due to the sweetness, but I could definitely have 2 or 3. Solid offering!","aquaderek","Oct 03, 2008"

This one is full honey ahoy, almost too much I think. It's a very sweet porter so make sure you really like honey before you try this one. Luckily I do like the flavor, but I felt it was a tad overbearing. Also, this beer had some terrific lacing, very sexy for a beer.","oriolesfan4","Sep 30, 2008"

Quickly became a one finger thick cap that retained very well and laced well throughout. The aroma was sweet, caramel malt, raw honey and some roasted malt underneath which combine to make a toffee-like smell. The flavors were also sweet, but here the honey was a little too much for me. Don't get me wrong, the honey flavors are good but they dominate the palate. The roasted malt and coffee flavors appear towards the end. The mouthfeel is ok but could be a bit heavier given that it's a Porter. In general, this is a good beer but I wouldn't sit down and throw back more than two.","thekevlarkid","Sep 27, 2008"

3.61,-1.6,4,3,4,4.5,3,"I was hesitant to try this as my experience with ""honey"" beers began and ended with Michelob's Honey stuff or whatever about 15 years ago, this is different. Poured into 12 oz glass forming a creamy light tan head that disipated quickly into lacing on top and around the glass. The color is mahogany with tan lights at the edges. The smell is all malt, toasty and some sweet note, caramel? The hops aren't there to my nose but the taste is sweet and the honey is very apparent up front. The taste starts with honey, then the malt is apparent and finally the hops, citrus somewhere betwixt oranges and grapefruit. The mouthfeel is different as the honey seems to linger on the lips and the malt on the tongue with a dry finish, overall the feel is almost tannic. Very intersting brew, perhaps a bit sweeter than I'd like for just kickin'back a few but I'll bet it's killer with seafood.","saradad","Sep 26, 2008"

Sweet honey and a hint of astringent alcohol at first, a richer dark malt and a smooth roasted caramel emerged the longer it sat in the glass.

The honey flavor is most overpowering - I don't understand how they can claim any kind of spiciness as there is none. This beer's aroma is simply honey...nothing else...no complexity at all. In fact, all that I can say about this one is its appearance as it does look very tasty and full.

Poured an opaque deep brown, almost black except for the deep ruby highlights when the light hits the base of the glass. Tremendous tan head cascaded over the side of the glass after the initial pour finally settling into a solid layer of foam leaving behind lots of sticky residual lacing around the top 1.5 inches of glass; lacing during the session was copious, but watery and did not adhere well to the glass. Honey and malt in the nose as well as a trace of coffee. Taste is similar to nose; however, coffee flavor reveals itself as a little burnt, but not overpoweringly so. Honey nicely co-mingles with the malty backbone concluding in a slight hops bitterness at the finish. Decent mouthfeel, good consistency, but a little too much carbonation across the tongue. Much more drinkable than I initially anticipated. Initially thought the honey character might be too cloying, but definitely does not come across as so.

There is a definite sour note to the beer, but chocolate, and extremely roasted malts both come out. Oh yeah, there is also the honey that kind of smacks you around. Mouthfeel is exceptional. My biggest complaint about porters is they are often really thin and overly carbonated. Neither of those qualities is present in this beer. It's nice and think, slightly carbonated and has a nice oily texture to it. Wonderful. While, I'm not a huge homer on the taste, it's still a pretty good beer.","hwwty4","Apr 03, 2008"

Underneath, hidden away, is the sweetness the name implies. A slight hop bitterness and essence of pine finish things off. Mouth-feel is smooth and medium bodied.

Aromas aren't too intensely roasty, but they lend a coffee and chocolate note as well. A sweet floral note comes through as well, given to the EKGs as well as the honey. On the palate, things are much more roasty, however a higher than normal carbonation for an EP lends it a lighter body. The sweetness from the honey is borderline cloying for this style though as it should be a relatively dry beer. The finish is surely dry and bitter from the hops and roasted malts.

Throw in the hops and this brew adeptly balances between three separate aspects, with the malts taking the desired lead. I mostly enjoyed the fullness of body and taste, as well as the uniqueness of the overall flavor. I think this would appeal more to those with an open palate, for it is not for the faint of heart.

The aroma is of molasses and roasted notes. Good. The flavor is more grainy, with a little dark chocolate, and a sweetish bitter finish that lingers a bit. Pretty creamy in the mouth, solidly carbonated. For the most part, it went down pretty easy, too. This is another decent SA offering - not the head of the class, but well done.","MDekker","Aug 09, 2007"

All over the place really, and in a good way. Taste is a touch more straight-forward, but still good: lots of roasted malt, breadiness, and light prunes. Body is medium, a little thin for a porter, but the carbonation is solid. Overall, this one's a good beer, one I'd definitely have again. It's fairly well-suited as a porter for newbies.","soupyman10","Aug 09, 2007"

4,9,4,4,4,4,4,"This brew came in the Sam Adams mixed up six pack. I was sort of hoping the scotch ale would be found in here, but nonetheless I was happy to have three dark beers on hand. Poured into a Sam Adams glass a dark brown color, with rosewood hues when held up to the lamp in my living room. Head was large at first, then rapidly faded into a lace that held up well. In the aroma honey was all over the place. I have never smelled a beer with such sweet, rich honey inside. Although the honey dominates, there is some trace of molasses and carmel as well. Taste starts off very much like an English Porter in that it is dry and musty with some chocolate notes, but upon finishing the honey flavors come pushing through to leave a sweet sticky after tatse on the palate. Mouthfeel is right in the middle on this one. The tastes are big, but the body a bit smaller. The last time I had this brew was around Christmas time, when it had just begun coming back out after being retired for a while. At that time I was not so crazy about it, but now I am appreciating it a whole lot more. I plan on pairing this with something from the bbq. Cheers.","jamie2dope","Jul 16, 2007"

The taste is of roasted malt, caramel, honey, and has a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a porter, with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a prett good beer. While most honey beers I have had showed to trace of having honey in them, this one explodes with it. If only the porter beneath the honey were a little more vibrant, I would drink this beer a lot.","KarlHungus","Jul 08, 2007"

Leaves thick, frothy milk-like, raised lacing all over the glass. Aroma is of raisins, dates, plums, figs, chocolate, honey, nuts, bread, molasses, herbal hops notes, and faint coffee-like roastiness. Flavors starts off more along the lines of molasses and dried fruits. As it moves on toward the middle, chocolate comes out a tad, and by the finish, it is much more prominent, leading on into the aftertaste. Also, by the middle, I pick up some moist perique tobacco. The finish brings on roasted flavors and herbal notes from the Goldings with a pleasant and mild bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little richer than medium in how it sits on the tongue, and the carbonation is pleasantly present, but, thankfully, remains very mellow and creamy. Excellent porter. I'm kind of surprised Sam Adams managed to pull it off this well.","goochpunch","Jun 24, 2007"

3.96,7.9,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"12 oz. bottle, best before August '07; brewed with English hops, Scottish heather honey, and dry-hopped with English Goldings. Served in an SA Double Bock tulip, it pours dark mahogany at the bottom, and near black on top, with light carbonation, and a finger of khaki head that compacts, then slowly subsides into the (unfiltered?) body; however, the head never disappears, and leaves loads of lacing on the glass. On the palate, there are roasted and lightly charred malts, hints of coffee and green/spicy hops that eventually emerge, bringing with them a slowly-increasing bitterness. The body is medium, quite smooth - almost feeling conditioned - with medium carbonation and finish. Overall, a pretty solid effort, but it is more mellow than I'd like. It beefs up as it warms, but a more robust brew would be ideal. Still, a unique brew that I'd definitely revisit.","mmmbeer","Jun 15, 2007"

This one pours a dark brown, with a khaki colored head. Smell is bombastic, malt, cocoa, toffee, and coffee all vie for the top spot, and manage to blend together rather well with just a hint of sweet honey. Taste is very much the same, with the sweetness of the honey helping to balance out the bitterness of the coffee and cocoa flavors, while blending marvelously with the toffee. Mouthfeel is very good, this one manages to be hearty and crisp at the same time, and goes down very smooth for such a rich brew.

There is honey present in the aroma along with a malty background. The boldness of the aroma left something to be desired, especially because I served the beer on the warm side. The lightness of the body was pretty surprising for a porter. It should definitely be heavier in my mind. The flavor is pretty light as well but very smooth until the end. There is a bit of creaminess in the front of the palate along with the honey flavor and malt background. At the back end though, there is a bit of a bite that I can't quite place. It's not an off-flavor, but it doesn't sit well with me. Overall a pretty average beer.","drseamus","Jun 11, 2007"

A moderate to light Porter character shows light (Columbian) coffee, a hint of chocolate, mildly roasted grains and a lot of yeasty flavors from the fermentation. The body seems light, maybe toward Brown Ale proportions. The honey adds a subtle, underlining sweetness, perfumy aroma, and a delicate spiciness. Finishes a bit on the astringent side...seems to be typical of roasted grains in a lighter body. Otherwise a fine beer.","BEERchitect","Jun 01, 2007"

The aroma is nice, malt sticks out giving is a sweet scent that reminds me of caramel and I suppose some honey although it is not screaming it. Has a smooth start which seems to have a break in the middle where the taste gets a little harsher from what I would presume are burnt/chocolate malts. The end seems to have a slight bitterness but I am not sure if that would be from hops or possibly burnt malt? Also has a slight metalic taste at the end. Regardless the end is nice, over all this is a good beer, are there better brews in this category, yeah sure but for it to be included in the brewmaster collection is fine by me.","Stimack","May 14, 2007"

3.28,-10.6,4,3.5,3,4,3,"Best before August 2007. Still-looking cola brown with a dense and thick khaki head. Sweet and roasty aromas, with caramel and toasted grains coming through most strongly. Getting really close, I pick up a faintly stinky honey/propolis aroma. Some herbal hop notes and a slightly sour scent are also present. At first, the taste is almost jarringly sour, as an acrid grain mash and grassy hop melange present themselves. Midway through there is a startling sweet soda flavor, like Mr. Pibb, I swear to god. Weird. The finish is a nice and roasty chicory coffee affair. Gently tingly mouthfeel, smoothish, and off-dry at the finish. All in all, I don't think it's a bad idea to put honey in beer, but I don't think it really shines as an ingredient in this porter.

The taste is great, very mellow, and almost not roasty at all, especially for a porter. I'm starting to warm up to the black beers, and this is only helping me along. The moutfeel is heavy, I mean, it is a porter...I could probably drink a good amount of these baby's. Much mellower and drinkable than their black lager surprisingly.

Not a whole lot of porter going on in this aroma if you ask me. It almost smells a little underattenuated from the honey sweetness. Taking a sip I find a strong honey character, a mild toasted to roasted character, finishing with a moderate bitter that is a bit astringent. The aftertaste is a little solventy due to the astringency. Mouthfeel is light with a light carbonation, leaving a little to be desired. It is just very watery feeling. It finished a bit drying as well that accentuates the astringency. Overall, I am not as impressed with this as I would have expected to be.

This newer version isnt the robust porter that the label claims- it is actually a medium- bodied brew and while the honey taste is obvious, it isnt as evident as I remember. Its a good tasting beer that comes up short in one main category: It fullness. The label claims its a robust porter with a full body but this is not the case.

Nose is a bit subdued, but theres honey in there you betcha, alongside pale and dark malts. Smells a bit sweeter than I expected. I did pour this cold, so I let it warm a bit. Smooth on the tongue, with a combination bitter, tangy, musty flavor. Sweetens, dries, and smoothes out midway through the palate, and finishes with an interesting, lingering aggregate, part roasted malts, part unctious honey, part bittering hops. Body is on-style, fairly light and very drinkable. Not nearly as sweet on the palate as the nose would suggest, and while the honey is a prominent flavor overall, I would imagine that it's an acquired taste in terms of a flavoring for this style of beer. As with coffee-flavored porters, I can usually put down one or more if so inclined, but I guess prefer flavored stouts!

The bitterness is more than firm, solid but not bold, but dull, perhaps muted by the honey sweetness. It finishes kind of dull and muddied, with some sticky honey (that's not necessarily sugary, but coating, and with honey flavor), and a solid bitterness and some dark malt acidity.

3.91,6.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Pours a very clear, dark ruby-amber. The pale biege three-finger head is a thick cream, holding exceptionally well and leaving wide rings of lacing. Crystal malt, toffee and sack honey in the nose, with soft earthy hops in the background. Caramel and brown malt upfront, followed by herbal honey, a dark roasted flavor, and mild coffee notes. Aftertaste is dried by the roasted barley and a fuggles bitterness/flavor. I washoping for a more pronounced honey character,but it's balanced and the flavors meld well without need for more sweetness. Light-medium bodied and appropriate lower carbonation, a smooth ""english handpull"" type mouthfeel. Finishes easy; a touch roasty with some residual caramel/honey and earthy hop tones.This is a nice addition to the mix pack, and considering Sammy Adams resonable prices, I would consider picking up a six-pack if the brewery decided to market it.","PBRstreetgang","Feb 08, 2007"

Boy, this really smells like honey and I really like it. There's a slight roasted character and some floral notes as well. Taste is roasted malt up front with a dry hop middle and finishes a little sweet with the honey - an excellent dessert beer. Mouthfeel is rich, but it could stand to be a little creamier. This is a very good beer - very tasty. I could easily drink more than one of these, Recommended.","montageman","Feb 08, 2007"

The smell is of honey, deep toasted malt, sort of reminds me of graham crackers. Taste is mainly of the roasted malt and has a smooth honey finish. Beer is lighter in body than I would have expected and has creamy carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, light in body and a smooth finish. I would recommend this beer, not outstanding, but very solid.","gmfessen","Feb 04, 2007"

It goes down easily enough, feels just like a macro BMC in the mouth. I won't be buying this brew again. Doesn't have a good taste, and just sucks in general.

Gorgeous offwhite foamy head stayed in place for several minutes. Very impressive. The smell was almost entirely honey. There is some roasted malt in there, and a bit of earthy hops, as well, but you really have to search for them. The honey is really, um, ""present"". Taste, too, is loaded with honey. There is, however, quite a pronounced bitterness on the finish, which I would probably really enjoy, but I feel it clashes with the honey a bit. Interesting thing about this one, is how there is some malt present up front, then some honey, then the hop bitterness on the finish, then, several seconds after you have finished with a sip, there is certainly a lingering honey aftertaste. Mouthfeel was really average for the style. Not spectacular, but you could do worse, too. Not sure if I could session this one or not. More than two might be a stretch. It certainly is very surprising and quite pleasant to sit down and enjoy just one, though.","SilentSabre","Jan 05, 2007"

I'm not sure I could session this porter, but one during a session wouldnt be bad. I've never had a honey porter before this one, and wasnt quite sure what to expect.
