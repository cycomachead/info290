"Okay, but there was not much ""honey"" as far as taste/aroma. My first sampling from a beerfest a few months back was creamier in mouth feel and had a slight Russian Imperial ""whiskyness"" to it. My most recent one was weaker, less flavorful. Looks good at first pour with a decent head but evaporates quickly. Mouthfeel was more like an IPA than a porter. Just average and I was expecting much better."

"Cost about $34 pesos or $3 canadian dollars. I would like to try it again while pairing it with a Toronto winter. Cheers Mother F***ers."

"Brought to me via the six pack. Poured a dark reddish brown/nearly black color with a good brown head. Aromas of dark chocolate, roasted malt and coffee. On the palate, this one is medium bodied and rich, with flavors of roasted malt, dark chocolate and cocoa."
"Overall: Not a huge fan of this one. Honey just doesnt seem to come through in the honey brews I have tried. It has more of a smokey taste than I like."
"A decent beer, hard to categorize for your American friends. Too dark for girls and BMC guys, too thin for your hophead/imperial everything crowd. A neat niche, but nothing spectacular."
"This has the color of a porter pouring out as a dark rich brownish color. The head is a light brown color and fizzles away to just a ring around the glass. The aroma is deep and roasted with a really interesting sweetness in there from the honey. The taste of the beer is slighty burnt or roasted in the beginning and settles down in the aftertaste as a sweet and elegant mix of the roasted malts and the honey. The mouthfeel is on the lighter side for a dark brew."
"D - The drinkability is pretty decent. It went down pretty smooth. I could probably drink a few of these in a sitting. Overall, I think this is a pretty good beer, but it is certainly not great. I think its worth giving it a shot."
"Pretty pedestrian, even for Sam Adams."
"D- Leaves a good layer/coat in your mouth, and in a sense keeps your mouth ready for more."
"Over two fingers of beige head. The porter is ruby and brown hues. The head is fluffy like a marshmallow, with wonderfully fluffy retention and plenty of lacing adorning the glass. Aromas are acidic at first whiff, with sweet chocolate and roasted coffee malts coming in to balance it all out. Flavors emphasize the heavily roasted malt. Biscuit malt expected from an English style porter, complete with the acidic coffee characteristics. There is a nice balance between the malt and hops, and the honey is undeniably present. There's high carbonation at first but it seems to mellow out with a bit of time and warmth...or maybe I twirled the glass one too many times? Nice residuals left behind from a rather light body. This is a pretty solid porter!"
"D- Not too bad to drink and easy. Coats the mouth well and there is just enough to keep my interest."
"D: This is a decent porter but nothing exceptional. Like many Sam Adams beers, the flavor is muted. These go down easy but nothing I would seek out again."
"One day, I will try this again - until then, I will not look at honey-laced things the same way. I'm avoiding the sugary condiment aisle in the Supermarket for about a month."
"D - Very drinkable. None of the characteristics are harsh or overbearing."
"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with a foamy, long lasting, tanned head. Good amount of lacing. Aroma of coffee, roasted malt and hints of citrus hops. Medium, tangy body. Flavor of dark fruit, coffee, chocolate and hints of honey. Medium, balanced finish. Tasty, easy drinkable porter."
"Another Samuel Adams tick found at my local place. Beer might be a bit old since it expires in December 2010. Pours a nice deep black amber with a nice inch of head. The smell is mostly honey but it smells like bitter malty honey. The taste is something getting used to. At first I was offput with the strong coffee and chocolate taste of a porter with sweet malty honey but it grows on you. By half glass it starts bitter porter, sweet honey. with a hoppy finish. Mouth-feel is light but moderate due to the bitterness of the porter. Drink-ability is decent but I didn't really enjoy having to get used to honey in my porter. A smooth light beer."
"The beer pours a deep black color, with a slight amber hue to it. The beer smells of malty. The flavor is what id expect from a porter. Dark roasted malt character, im not picking up really any honey. The mouthfeel is medium. I dont find this beer drinkable. Ive had this beer several times and havent been able to develop a taste for it. I just dont find it well balanced."
"Overall, its a solid effort by Boston Beer Company but its far from my favorite porter. Boston Beer Company tends to play it safe with their beers and this is no exception. Worth a try, especially since its pretty easy to get, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this one. Cheers."
"Fairly clear dark amber brown color with a thin fizzy tan head. Smells of bitter coffee and some honey malts, with a light hoppy zing. Tastes is light and flavorful; classic earthy porter taste with an uplifting honey and hop finish. Finishes pretty clean without a lot of lingering flavor, some noticeable adjuncts though. Light for a porter, pretty thin body with just a little too much lively carbonation. Mediocre drinkability, just not my first choice for American Porter. Too zippy and light and superficial."
"Drinkability: This seemed to go down quite nicely but that was in part because of trying to tease out the aroma and flavor components. As a drinking beer I'd be happy to have this one again and will take advantage of the opportunity to do so, but, that said, I'll also not go out of my way to track this one down or add it to my shopping list."
"D- I think I was expecting a little more but still a decent beer."
"Good solid drinkable porter. Lacks hoppy or super bitter distinctions, and that is a good thing. The honey mellows this one. Great balance. Haven't had this in a while. Glad I grabbed a bottle."
"Dark as porter should be. Pulls a 35 on the SRM beer color chart. I was hoping for a little more head, but one finger was all I got. This head was light brown and tight fluffy bubbles. It actually took a while for this small head to convert to nice lacing around the side of my glass. Honey and chocolate are the first aromas to hit my nostrils. Sorghum molasses, raisins, coffee bean, and a hint of citrus linger in the background scents. Oh yes, I see why it is called Honey Porter. As with the smell, honey and chocolate are in the forefront, and with every sip and slide around my mouth comes another flavor; caramel, roasted wheat, coffee, lime, and hops. It has a billowy mouthfeel, like marshmallows. Oh yes I will have another. Should be good with glazed donuts."
"This is quite simply, one of the most vile tasting ""premium"" beers I've ever had the displeasure of tasting. This beer is a challenge to choke down. Syrupy sweet and almost undrinkable. I wish I had something good to say about this beer, but it's really that bad. This tastes more like soda than beer, but much thicker and less refreshing."
"This beer has a nice dark color to it, with nice brown head that last a while. I smell a hint of honey and malts. The taste is out of this world, not to sweet but has just enough balance of hops and honey to make it really taste like a good porter. Great mouth feel and is very drinkable. I can't wait to drink another one."
"actually goes down well. would be exceptional with some more roastiness, but if you don't mind a bit of honey its actually quaffable. I'm thinking of mixing the last half of this with another beer, but I wouldn't mind drinking the rest on its own either."
"Again, no complaints about this solid session beer, although overall it's not particularly complex or even overly creative."
"Bottom line - Would recommend. Good dinner beer, in other words, enjoy it with a meal."
"D- Nice feel and flavor very easy to drink"
"Recommended, not in the Fall."
"Drinkability is good. Easy to enjoy in a session, or as a after dinner sipping beer, this brew has quite a lot to offer to anyone's palate."
"Very Nice Beer.. Cheers!"
"D- don't think this one is for me. Waaay too sweet..."
"Yes, but not for a while. It's a standard porter with a twist, but not a knock-your-socks-off experience. A good stand-by porter but not for special occasions."
"D: I could spend an afternoon drinking these. I love honey and have been known to dip a spoon in the jar and eat it straight. It's not my favorite Sam Adams brew but it's certainly worth trying and I would buy it again."
"D: This is a great beer to sip all night long. It goes down easy so you could easily drink a few of them, but why would you want to? This is one to savor."
"D- It could be drank in a couple at a time. Probably not going back for it, but wouldn't turn it down."
"My only disappointment is the metallic taste that you 1st taste in the beer. After a few sips, its gone. Perhaps it warms a bit or it breathes a bit and disperses the metallic flavor. Not bad at all."
"Sorry, Boston Beer! I am typically a big fan of many of your products - to me, this was a swing and a miss."
"D: It's really solid and a pleasure to drink. Maybe my favorite Sam Adams product. Quite light for a porter, and very refreshing."
"D: Very easy to odrink; not hot and cloyuing like some honey varieties."
"D: easy to drink this 1 its a winner. Time for my 3rd one!"
"Another very solid offering from SA."
"Drinkability - I could put down maybe three of these at a time, making it somewhat less than sessionable."
"D: Pretty good. I wasn't super excited about it, but enjoyed it enough. I ate some dark chocolate with it and thought that was really nice."
"Nice to have this one back. For paring, chocolates would be easy, so we recom- mend taking a risk and enjoying this one with some Mexican food. We think you'll find the match to be perfect, especially with spicier dishes or mole sauces."
"D - Good dark brew for sessioning."
"This is a great honey flavored brew, very easy drinking. At the same time a good brew to relax and enjoy. This is very much sessionable and ""case worthy""."
"This is a very good honey porter. I would be happy with a case of this stuff. Easy drinking and there is just enough honey - it not overdone at all."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is of malts, some notes of honey. Taste is like it smells, malts and honey, some chocolate, finishes slightly bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fairly good quality beer."
"The mouthfeel is nearing what I would call a full body. A nice lace now covers the glass. This might be my favorite porter to date."
"Too bad it's so sweet, as now it must be rather on it's own after dinner to be enjoyable."
"Dr. Very good. Goes down way easy."
"as a big fan of sam's beer i have to say that once again i was impresed with this beer thier are only a few of sam adams i do not care for but thats just me of course i will say that to me this beer out does it self in drinkabitly,like other beer that i just drank,,i did not fully apreacte this beer untill i started to enjoy them and not just drink them...if you are a sam adams fan,then this in my eyes should be at the top of your list to try...."
"Drinkable and (almost) complex, but not flavorful enough to catch a higher rating."
"Dark brown mahogony with translucent garnet hues when put to the light. Nice one inch tan head with good retention moderate lacing. Looks good. Some porter-like roasted smokey notes in the smell. Some sugary sweetness is noticable. Nothing overwhelming. This is a sweet beer, as is to be expected with honey in the name. The malts and honey provide the sweet backbone with the roasted dark chocolate coffe flavors far in the back ground. Very smooth. Nice chewy mouthfeel goes down very nicely. It would be better if it had more of a hop bitterness and some more complex roasted smokey notes to balance the sweetness. The sweet is in the driver's seat the whole way. This would be a good introduction to porters for someone used to lighter beers. I liked this beer, but the next time I'm in the mood for a good porter, it wont be the first thing that comes to mind."
"At last,this is one great porter that is quite balanced and blends so well.Damn,my glass is already empty."
"M/D: Lightish body, but creamy. Nice medium carbonation, which creates an excellent mouthfeel. This is an excellently balanced beer. It's excellent for cooking (I use it for bean dishes all the time), and very nice for drinking, too. Probably my favorite Sam Adams offering."
"D: another exceptional beer from Samuel Adams."
"Keep staying true Jim, this one's nice!"
"D - I thought this was a decent porter, one that could be almost sessioned. I'm becoming more and more of a fan of Sam Adams every time I try one of their brews."
"One of my favorite brews. I had not had this in a while (so many beers so little time) and was happy all over again at my first sip. Deep dark brown color with a light tan head. The honey sweetness is very evident in this big malty beer. Makes it smooth and silky in your mouth. Very subtle underlying tastes of coffee and chocolate. I could drink this all night."
"A nicely balanced porter which I could wish were just a bit chewier and more robust in presentation. I do like the honey presence which seems perfectly in balance with the other flavors. I will have no problems finishing the rest of the six pack!"
"Pours a cloudy dark brown with purplish highlights, fluffy khaki head, minimal retention and oily lattice like lacing. Smell is of smoke, burnt toast, toffee. Taste is of burnt toast, toffee, light sweet honey notes, somewhat smokey, definite hop presence. Slightly thin and oily for the style. Decent beer, doesnt wow me in any particular way, but enjoyable for its ability to be different."
"Overall, very descent for the price and availability."
" ~ Overall this beer is okay. I don't think its something I'd necessarily recommend to my friends but I wouldn't steer them away from it either."
"a drinkable brew, the taste doesn't jump at you and its heavier than i expected for whatever reason, but its still a good, enjoyable, balanced selection. for me, one of the more favorable widely available selections from sam adams."
"There's a touch of astringent and the sweetness takes just a little off an otherwise good drinkability."
"Very dark brown, when held up to light I can see some mahogany, but even when held up to light it is very dark. Almost a two finger head that leaves a lot of lacing. The smell is has a very strong roasted malt character, and a sweetness from the honey. The taste is again roasted malt and honey along with a hint of chocolate malt and a hoppy finish."
"Pours out to a clear, filtered dark brown, nearing black, forming a creamy light tan head with yellow accents. Retention is good, and lacing is average. Carbonation is moderate. The aroma is very English as one could guess from the ingredients...there is that ruddy soapy cardboardy nose I get from alot of English Ales, and I'm not particularly fond of, as well as honey when swirled and some buttery diacetyl (Wormwood?). Carbonation is fine and contributes to a smoother than anticipated mouthfeel, with a medium-dense body. The taste begins with wet cardboard, diacetyl, followed by a touch of honey sweetness and roasted grains in the middle"
"Pours a brown color that has a bit of redness about it as well. Can just barely see through this one. Has a slightly tanned head that fades fairly quick and leaves a fair amount of lacing on the glass. Nose has some honey sweetness in it as well as some slight chocolate notes. Taste is a bit metallic but also has some chocolate and coffee mixed in there as well. The yeast is noticable in this beer. Finishes crisp with a bit of bitterness from the hops and barley. Mouthfeel is medium on this one and carbination is tingly. Overall drinkability is quite good."
"Overall, a solid porter. Not amazing, but very good. Sam Adams does the job again. The honey taste might put people off from drinking a lot of this, but it is a little heavy to do that anyway."
"D: A very nice porter, surprisingly dry since there is honey in it - but very nice. I had it with hamburger and french fries (at a pub, not McDonald's). It was great - try it!"
"Pour is quite cola-like.. very dark with some reddish areas where the light passes thru.. thin off-white head. Not much viscosity. As a stout it would be a disappointment but it is a porter so I suppose that maeks it fairly good for its style. Not much aroma at all to pick up on, only the faintest hint of malt. Flavor is malty and dark.. not much honey characteristic, in fact I would never guess it was supposed to be a honey porter unless told so. Mouth is sort of thin, bordering watery.. definitely not very full-bodied. It drinks easy but its not very flavorful or too impressive so I wouldn't buy it again unless having no other real options."
"Nice light medium body that completely refreshes. That's why I'm much more of a porter man than a stout man and a lager man than an ale man."
"D: I thought this was an OK beer, very well brewed, but nothing about the flavor of it made me want another one right now."
"D - I had a few of these but that's all I could have. You start to get sick of the honey after awhile"
"Mahogany color that is very deep and pretty. While ""5" are rare, I almost clicked it here. I settled on 4.5. Wispy head of a little lacing. A foamier head would have nailed the 5 in my opinion due to the contrast of colors. The honey and the malts are very mildly coming out in the nose and that is about the strength in the flavor. While you kind of want more, you also fear that more honey would not be enjoyable. I think they were likely limited by ""good taste"" with how far they could push it here. There are some grainy flavors at the finish. The mouthfeel is pretty thick and reasonably enjoyable. There is a bit of a honey aftertaste, and again, I don't know that they could do anything different with this and avoid tipping the balance. It is what it is, and its not one of my favorites, but I will drink it a BBQ if its in a cooler full of macro beer."
"(from tasting notes on 12 June 09)"
"Drinkability - I could definitely have a few of these. Not sure if I would make this out to be a session beer though."
"Nice dark reddist-amaranto pour with a tan head and fairly clean lacing down the glass. The smell was a bit weak and somewhat like baker's chocolate but I couldn't detect honey. Tasted better than I expected from the nose with some sweet chocolate, something akin to dark cherries, a bit of toasted wheat bread, I really like it. Mouthfeel was a bit thin for the style but it was readily drinkable and hope to have this off tap someday."
"Drinkability: I was expecting more chocolate and honey taste, and am not a huge fan of the burnt notes. Past that, this is a very smooth beer, and easy to wash down."
"Overall I liked this beer. This was my first American porter and I feel it was a good intro into the porters. I look forward to trying different kinds in the future."
"Overall a nice beer, but pretty much just a typical porter."
"Smells strongly of coffee (and not much else), which carries through to the taste and in fact dominates it. Burnt/roasted qualities also make significant contributions to the flavor of the beer. Further in the background, smoke, honey, vanilla, and chocolate. It's mostly coffee-bitter, but there is a sweet edge from the honey. Pretty tasty porter. I wouldn't mind having a few of these in one sitting."
"another two thumbs up for Sam Adams. Thank you for pioneering the craft beer grounds of America. The lacing in the glass is also very nice."
"Drinks very well, but the porter is a bit light bodied."
"Prost!"
"Drinks surprisingly easy. Very good beer."
"Drinkability- Delicious and sweet, seems like this would go well with a wide range of foods."
"D- Definitely drinkable, a great example of a porter and the honey is definitely intriguing to say the least."
"D: Very easy. I'da liked more complexity, perhaps something more robust, but it'll do."
"D - Nice full bodied porter with some light sweetness. This goes down smooth."
"Drinkability: Excellent. I could throw these back all day."
" allows for optimal consumption."
"d- better with food"
"Very dark brown, clear, with a reddish tint. A short cap of tan bubbles fell quickly, leaving a thin collar and glass coating lace. Chocolate and caramel in the nose, along with floral and honey sweetness. Low hop bitterness, seems like a lot of the bitterness comes from dark grain. Quite sweet, honey and toffee, a bit of roast. Medium bodied, average carbonation, nice texture, a bit drying. Decent overall. Seems a little heavy on sweetness rather than black malts or hops."
"12oz bottle. Pours a clear dark brown with a creamy tan head that leaves nice lacing. Smells strongly of honey along with nice darkly roasted malts. Hints of coffee. Taste is dominated by roasted malts; slightly bitter, but balanced by the honey. Light-medium bodied and a bit overcarbonated for the style. Fairly nice, overall."
"I could easily knock back a couple of these."
"Drinkable, but the taste is a bit overpowering. I can;t see drinking this all evening. Maybe just a couple. Definitely not for a session."
"Good medium body, a nice feel with ample carbonation. Easy to drink porter even on a hot spring day."
"Presentation: Packaged in a 12 ounce brown glass long neck bottle with raised lettering and a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass. The Sam Adams bottles are a favorite of home brewers."
"Mouthfeel was good but I would have liked a little more body. Drinkability was strong because I enjoyed the flavors and the ABV is moderate. I'm not usually a fan of dark beers, esp. porters and stouts but this one is a winner. The honey really helped make it very good IMO."
"Mouthfeel is medium, on the side of heavy/thick, with a pleasant mouth-coating effect. Quite drinkable. There's enough going on to keep me interested, and thankfully the honey is kept in check to keep this from being sickly sweet. Overall, this tastes like a good, roasty porter sweetened by an appropriate dose of earthy honey, rather than a sub-par porter that allows the honey to take a back seat, or an over-the-top porter that just works to keep the honey hidden."
"D- The honey in the aroma and taste really make this one pretty enjoyable for me."
"But overall, a nice beverage."
"80% recommended."
"[Drinkability]: Drinkability is fair. Not the best porter I had, I'm kind of disappointed with this one."
"D - It has a unique flavor with a dry, bitter spiciness on the finish that ends the drink in such a way that removes slightly from its drinkability"
"Mouthfeel is medium light bodied and smooth with a nice crisp carbonation."
"As I didn't enjoy the finish this beer has, I don't consider it terribly drinkable, and I probably won't buy it again."
"Hopes were high for this one at first, but a balancing of flavors is necessary for something of this nature to work."
"Overall, this was one of the first craft beers I had about 4 years ago and I loved it then and I still love it now. Very flavorful and pretty easy to drink. I highly recommend this amazing porter."
"The color of the last remaining light of a cold fall day, very dark ruby red. Toasted cream head, with light carbonation. Smells like baked bread and syrup with a punch of crystal malt up front. Taste is very good for the style. Toasted barley, dark chocolate, and a variety of malts dance all over my tongue. Some note the hop characteristics, but I dont really get anything more than some holiday spice out of them. Not all that heavy for a porter, with a nice mouthfeel. Very drinkable, and a good representation of the style. Not all that sweet initially, but it has a good dry and sweet linger that has a unique ability to keep me wanting more."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" light brown head over the clear reddish brown brew. Head falls gradually, with lasting sticky lacing. Aroma is rich grains and sweetness. Taste begins with full malt flavor, goes honey sweet in the middle, a quick tart shot and then closes with a lingering sweetness. Mouthfeel is smooth, and drinkability is pretty good. Continues the Sam tradition of being an acceptable representative of the style, but nothing outrageous."
"Honey Porter is another solid offering from Sam Adams, though unremarkable in the world of craft beers. Probably would make a good starter beer for those looking to get into craft brewing."
"all things said, recommended (depending on the application...!)."
"Thoughts - I like honey a lot, and this one has a lot, very sweet and it really overpowers the rest of the beer. This would be a good beer for people that have only had the big company horrabrews."
"-RR"
"A good sweet stout, very sessionable, not too many bold flavors. Honey is very subtle, just lending sweetness in my opinion."
"A good session beer. Well balanced. I like the character that the honey adds. I could drink a few of these. Another good offering from Sam Adams."
"Mouthfeel is fairly smooth. This is probably one of my favorite offerings from SA but not necessarily something I would want to drink all night. A little too sweet too be considered sessionable so for me its more of a nice treat every now and then, maybe even a dessert beer of sorts. Still pretty decent overall."
"This beer is a boring."
"D: Nice flavor, appropriate body, and smooth finish--all make this beer quite drinkable. I'm glad I revisited this one--it's definitely one to keep in mind for my regular rotation for the future. New score: 4"
"D: Ok, a decent porter. Mouthfeel is near perfect. The flavors and aromas are a touch off for me."
"At least everything else from Sam Adams has been at least decent, this is horrible. Some hops compliment some malts, and some malts compliment some hops, the right combination was not found here. And they honey, wow, what is the point, just adds a funky sweetness to an already bad beer. Must have been a mistake that they decided to add honey too and market just to get rid off originally, then some one actually liked it I guess."
"This beer pours well with a nice foamy head. I instantly noticed honey aromas from the glass, followed by floral hops. The color is deep brown as a porter should be. The first sip is chocolately and bitter and nicely balanced by a light honey flavor. Not as heavy as most porters. Feels light and creamy. As it warms the honey really shines through, the last sip is pure sweet honey with a light bitter chocolate aftertaste. My favorite from Sam Adams."
"D- Very good. All around a solid brew."
"Poured dark brown with a hint of red into my pint glass. Not quite as thick as other porters I've sampled. The smell is of honey and chocolate. When I smelled the beer in the bottle pre-pour, it smelled like pure honey from one of those little bears. I'm not really into porters, but this is something I could get into. Feels creamy and rich in the mouth and goes down smooth. The chocolate smell equates to more of a cocoa taste...slightly bitter rather than sweet. Light hops also helps to balance out any sweetness imparted by the honey. Nice job Jim."
"One of my favorites from Sam. The color and aroma are very good on this one. The taste is very very good. It is not too complex but it gives you enough to keep you interested in. This is a very drinkable beer. The honey taste is faint but complementative as opposed to over powering."
"12 ounce bottle taken from my friend Scott's fridge last night, also poured into a pint glass, color is a dark reddish brown, tiny 1/4 inch bubbly off white head that did not last long at all, also minimal lacing, aroma is honey, sweet malt, roastiness, mild hops, and faint chocolate, taste starts off pretty roasty with chewier malts in the middle, finish is slightly sweet with a mixture of honey and dark malts, gets more roasty as time goes on, moutfeel is slightly roasty and sweet, pretty weak overall, medium body, a little too much carbonation for its style, taste did not linger too long, could have drank a bit more of this and that is it, slightly heavy, can be too sweet at times, not in a rush to drink this again any time soon, might be worth trying"
"Bought in a Sam Adams Sampler Pack, traditional dark porter look, a finger and a half head that diminished quickly with medium lacing. Not much chocolate or coffee here, light to light-medium bitterness. The surprise comes when you let it sit in your mouth for about five seconds or more; thats when the honey is noticed. If you quickly drink it you'll miss out, so to savor the sweetness i recommend swirling it around a little. Overall great starter porter."
"Drinkability: Very good for a dark beer. A good ""starter"" porter for those used to drinking lighter beers."
"this beer pours a very dark reddish brown color with a nearly tan head. the aroma is almost overwhelmingly sweet, the combination of hops and sweet roasted malt covers any sort of hops that might be hiding in there. the taste follows with the honey right up front and a bit of the malt and not a lot else. the mouthfeel is on the light side of heavy, a little heavier than I'd expect in a porter. a pretty decent beer, but not their best."
"Sam Adams Honey Porter has a dark brown color with a tinge of red. It poured a nice light brown head about an inch thick. As I brought it to my nose I noticed caramel, chocolate, and coffee with a hint of sweetness. It tastes a bit sweeter than most porters. I tasted the roasted malts and got a coffee aftertaste. It is not a bad beer. I could enjoy one here and there, but I think I prefer Sam Adams Cream Stout to the honey porter."
"This is a rare miss by Sam Adams. This beer is terrible. It looks gorgeous, and feels okay in your mouth, but tastes awful, and smells bad. I honestly have to struggle to finish this beer, which is sad because Sam normally makes such amazing beers. I was shocked when I first drank this beer because I am used to delicious Sam. Oh well, I guess you can't love everything."
"Taste adds a light honey sweetness to an otherwise happy situation. Otherwise a bit gooey and chewy as the malt structure is quite simple here. A moderately sweet ale without much character yet better with a little exposure to the air. I find honey and porter to be strange bedfellows."
"Drinkability: Overall, I liked this, not one of my favorite porters I've tried but it's on point. I think if the carbonation was lowered and the malt presence was stepped up this could be a better contender."
"D: Not much CO2, but absolutely drinkable. It's a bit like drinking lemonade, easy to drink and very sweet."
"Drinkability: Now one of my favorite Sam Adams brews...Another, if it were a bit lower ABV, I could session. A very welcome surprise but a wonderful brew"
"All in all, it's a good start for someone who wants to try a porter."
"I was plesantly surprised by this porter, which was poured from a 12 oz into a pint glass. The bready, biscuity aroma was muted, but good. The beer was a dark brown with mahogany highlights. There was depth of taste with a little bit of honey coupled with the hops. But it finished very smooth with no residual bitterness or sweetness. I could certainly drink a few of these in one sitting."
"Had me thinking about making the pairing myself, and thinking about using this beer in a bolognese sauce..."
"Pours an inky dark brown colored body, with a dark white head, some decent lacing, but diminishing. Has a very strong honey aroma, overpowering. Hmm, Different. Has a malty slight honey taste, but not heavy. Not too bad, and interesting taste."
"Picked up a six pack to enjoy during the Super Bowl. Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark brown color, with some amber around the edges of the glass. Huge creamy head that lasted for quite some time. Great lacing on the glass. A good looking beer. Smelled like very mellow roasted barley. A very smooth tasting porter. I did not really get any honey notes in the taste, but I assume that term probably applies to the smoothness of the beer. It was lighter than most porters I have had lately, both in flavor and in body. While in some cases I might consider this a fault, I do not with this beer. SA has made a very easy to drink porter, which would be great for people just getting into the style or for someone looking for an easy beer to drink that also has some flavor to it. My favorite selection in the Brewmaster's Collection to date."
"A bit too much roasted barley and not enough depth for a really good Porter. More hops would help this beer. Try Yuengling Porter at half the price."
"Drank January 31. From Sam Adams Variety Pack. Bottle pour into shaker. Dark brown pour & thick tan head, lingering for quite some time. Malty, smokey, hint of honey. Nice lacing throughout finish. A bit above average and a nice offering from SA. With that said Porters are just not my cup of...beer?"
"Another well done brew from the Sam Adams crew."
"Drinkability is good, this is a good beer and would make for a decent session."
"Na Zdravje!"
" Drink: cand put a buch of these back in one sitting but would prolly not find myself drinking this beer to often i like to many other beers more"
"A little too sweet to be sessionable and a little thin for a dessert beer, but I did enjoy the one I had. A solid porter for a cool fall evening."
"D- quite drinkable; the honey is present and flavorful. This would make a good dessert beer."
"It's and okay beer, but it always seems to be the last one left in my fridge when I get a Sam variety pack."
"D: It goes down easy enough, and none of the flavors are too extreme. Pretty tasty beer all around. Mouthfeel throws it off though, which is sad, but other than that flaw, this is a tasty beer."
"Smokey flavor, yet the honey makes it sweet. Very dry. You really have to be in a mood to drink this beer. This is too dry but the flavor has a nice kick to it--if that's what you're in the mood for."
"Conclusion: Overall pretty tasty porter, marred only by a need for a bit more depth from the malt profile IMO."
"Not a great porter, but a decent ale with nice flavor. It poured a dark ruby brown with honey light coming through and a decent but thin beige head. The aroma was of roasted malt & sour lemon with a hint of weak honey. The flavor was likewise with some hoppy kick, and a crisp refreshing mouth-feel, although a bit too carbonated."
"Dark brown/ruby red, definitely see-through, with a two finger fluffy tan colored head and very nice lacing. Aroma is nice mixture of sweet honey, chocolate and roasty toasty malts. Flavor is an odd combination of sweet malts, chocolate being the prominent one, mixed with honey and a little bit of earthy spiciness. I'm honestly not digging on this flavor profile. Body is medium bordering on thin, almost too crisp with a high amount of carbonation. This is not a great beer, probably the most disappointing of SA's Brewmaster collection."
"Definately an interesting brew that I wouldn't mind having once in a while; but I can't see myself drinking more than one or two of these in a sitting."
"I generally prefer porters to stouts because of the generally less roasty flavors and this is no exception. Works very well as a dessert beer or even just a dessert in itself."
"A nice, ""lighter"" session porter perhaps for those who don't enjoy darker, more robust roasted porters. Would probably make for a good gateway ale for non-porter enthusiasts. Otherwise, just a decent ale in my book."
"D, notes: A pretty lousy nose but tastes smooth, sweet and is well balanced."
"D - Decent for a porter, perhaps due to its light nature."
"D: Two in a sitting is nice; I'm generally not a porter fan, but I enjoyed this beer"
"Poured to a nice two fingered head that was caramel in color. Head had some very big bubbles that clumped together. Had some very nice lacing. Porter was very dark in color with a slightly red tint. Smelled of malt, chocolate, coffee and some hints of alcohol. Had a slight smoke taste. Also tasted some chocolate, burnt coffee, and honey. Honey taste was not over powering. Had a slightly bitter aftertaste that hung around awhile. Felt good in the mouth. Carbonation was right. I think this is another beer that you would have to be carefull with if you decided to do a session with. Taste was very good, and all I wanted to do was gulp it down."
"Smooth, full bodied and very drinkable, but definitely not my favorite porter. The Holiday Porter is way better."
"Good flavor, really pleasant nose, great appearance, really substantial feel. It almost feels like you should be eating it. Nice finish. Overall, very good quaff."
"Overall - Another great effort by the folks at Sam Adams!"
"Taste: Very malty and sweet. The hop bitterness really complements the roasted malts. I'm not certain if the honey adds or detracts from the flavor."
"Drinkability: Pretty drinkable. I wouldn't want more than maybe two of these at once, but I wouldn't mind getting it again. Probably would be good with desert."
"MF&D - Medium/full bodied with a creamy mouth feel. This beer is sweet and sticky, but extremely well balanced. A great session beer."
"The drinkability is decent as well. Overall this is a good beer and I'd like to give it a higher grade but there are just several other beers, mostly stouts, I'd prefer to drink over this porter."
"D- Drinks ok for such a sweet, thick porter"
" Pours clear and golden deep brown to hazzlenut brown with a diminished off-white head. Mild spiced honey aroma with a light roasted malt base. Mild caramel malty and light roasted with a light chocolate smoothness. Smooth roasted malty and chocolate finish with a light bitterness just showing through."
"My first Sam Adams Honey Porter in years, and I was really looking forward to it. Nice head retention, a creamy beige head common to porters, nicely off-set on the dark mahogany beer. Smell: A bit of a nose, but not overpowering. Taste: Rich, flavorful, but not much of a presence of any honey. Not hoppy, and not as strong as many porters tend to be. Mouthfeel: Full. Drinkability: Very. I found this porter to be lower in ABV, so I would be able to have more than a few. A fine beer on a cold day."
"A very dark beer I would say black as the ace of spades. Very little head. The aroma is roasted malt, hops and a hint of sweetness. . The taste is toasted malt. hint of caramel molasses and hops. The honey comes at the finish. It is a full body beer with a nice hint of sweetness. I really enjoy this beer"
"Samuel Adams Honey Porter from Boston Beer Company pours dark brown to not quite black color. Has a nice tan 2 finger head. Not very much aroma but I can detect a little honey and a nice helping of malt. Lightly sweet on the tongue with a hint of nut and caramel. I can taste the honey here. Finishes with an ever so slight burnt bitter taste(not a bad thing but a good thing). There is a great combination of caramel, coffee, and nuts resting on top of a slightly sweet honey flavor. A well balanced beer and I'm a fan. A very drinkable beer. Brew on, you Patriots, brew on! This beer was purchased right here in the jungle of Central Alabama in a 12 pack Brewmaster Collection."
"Not very enjoyable at all."
"D - This offering from Samuel Adams was another hit for me, a very drinkable Porter that is decently priced and packs a good flavor"
"i get a little grainy mouthfeel when i let it roll around. not necessarily a bad thing. ok drinkability."
"Overall, from memory I believe this beer is better when fresh."
"Not so drinkable for me - can't get past the tobacco. Very interesting, unusual brew but not for me."
"The sweetness and honey overtones definitely keep drinkability in check. With the silky texture and sweetness, this is a good sipper, but nothing you'd have more than 2 of in a single sitting."
"Deep dark chestnut colored with a very nice fine whipped tan head that leaves fine lacing on the glass. Smell is mostly honey with a nice toasted malt aroma.Taste is much like the nose with the honey up front and nice roasty chocolate notes,faint hop finish balances nicely. A nice creamy medium bodied mouthfeel. Finishes pretty clean. Decent."
"now I have to admit, I'm bumping up the drinkability and taste a bit right now because, since having drank it a couple of hours ago, I find myself really craving another one. strange. strange."
"Overall a good tasty, easy to drink beer."
"D - This is a pretty good porter. There are others in the price range that I prefer."
"O- A very drinkable porter. A pretty good one overall. One of Sam Adams' better offerings."
"One of the best honey flavoured beers I have had. Love the bitterness in the eftertaste."
"Got this in a Sam Adams variety pack. Sam Adams is proving to be a very reliable and sometimes exceptional brewery! I liked this porter. I am discovering that I really like porters and stouts a lot. This one poured a medium brown with a good head. This is very smooth and quite enjoyable. Don't be a beer snob give Sam Adams a try."
"D-This beer is enjoyable with a good flavor. It's easy to drink and makes me want another."
"Pours a very deep brown color with a nice thick tan head that settled into a cap; left some nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is of roasted malt and a hint of chocolate and smoke. A big roasted flavor with bitter chocolate and a hint of smoke which is somewhat offset by the honey presence. The feel is fairly light for a porter and perhaps a touch over carbonated. The honey adds a nice smooth feel and balance but the roasted bitterness wins out in the end. Another very solid malty brew from SA and fairly drinkable to boot."
"D= A highly drinkable porter and certainly better than I was expecting. This Sam Adams Brewmaster's Collection mixed twelve pack I am working through is really impressing the hell out of me."
"A solid porter with a chance to be better, the flavor doesn't absorb on the palate as well as others."
"Easily one of my favorite beers"
"T - Tastes of these qualities but also with a initial smoothness then taste buds pick up on slight hoppiness leaving a smoothness. This tactile taste gives a honey flavor."
"D - A good effort. Doesn't blow me away, but I can't find anything at all to dislike about it either. An easy to drink, perfectly enjoyable porter."
"This is a nice porter. Nicer than most others I have tried."
"Drinkability: Surely interesting, however it's ultimately not all that convincing as a ""honey porter""... but as a porter? Sure! Give it a go ya ho!"
"One of the better Sam Adams beers that I have tried. Very flavorful and certainly one of the better American Porters out there."
"D - this is a pretty decent porter. Definitely easy to drink down and it isn't too heavy. Also it is not overly roasty or sweet in its tastes, which makes easy to have another."
"I poured a 12 ounce glass into my SA pint glass. It is a dark brown in color with a nice white head. This beer leaves lots of lacing. On the nose a nice mix of honey and caramel malt. The beer is well balanced-slight bitterness followed by the honey sweetness. A full bodied beer that is easily drinkable, a nice combination. The beer does not taste as sweet as I feared, a darn good beer."
" This porter poured a deep brown accentuated by subtle reddish highlights. The head was a creamy tan that was quite attractive but faded quickly to lace. The aroma was of nice roasted malts. Flavor is roasted malt and of course the honey. There is a flash of bitterness at the end but the honey counters with a rich sweetness. The buttery and thick mouthfeel pairs nicely with the sweet and roasted flavors. Overall this is a nice little package but not a wow! experience. Couldn't see myself drinking 2000 calories of this baby unless I was a really hardworking Porter."
"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark auburn with ruby hues. Thick tan head, 2 fingers tall, great retention and lots of creamy lacing. Aromas of chocolate, brown sugar, and honey burst forth, with only a little roastiness. Flavor is roasty throughout with honey undertones and a dry finish. Body is rather thin, and that's the only real flaw here. Carbonation is good and drinkability is excellent. Almost a great porter."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The appearance is very dark brownish red with a 2""inch head that dissipates to a nice lace. The nose is malt forward followed by sweet honey and espresso. The taste is sweet and honey filled, what is extremely unique about the beer is the mouth feel which resembles a refreshing beer while sucking on one of those honey stick candies kids eats. Really unique, but works well. Not the most drinkable beer due to the sweetness, but I could definitely have 2 or 3. Solid offering!"
"Wow, this is one robust beer for sure as the label states. Usually when you see flavors in front of porters they are kind of afterthoughts, but not this one! This one is full honey ahoy, almost too much I think. It's a very sweet porter so make sure you really like honey before you try this one. Luckily I do like the flavor, but I felt it was a tad overbearing. Also, this beer had some terrific lacing, very sexy for a beer."
"D - A really good porter. I don't know if the ""honey"" thing is worth noting on the label, as it doesn't really come trough. That aside, it's a fine, fine beer."
"Pouring this one out of the bottle and into my mug yielded a deep, nearly opaque brown liquid with a foamy tan head. Quickly became a one finger thick cap that retained very well and laced well throughout. The aroma was sweet, caramel malt, raw honey and some roasted malt underneath which combine to make a toffee-like smell. The flavors were also sweet, but here the honey was a little too much for me. Don't get me wrong, the honey flavors are good but they dominate the palate. The roasted malt and coffee flavors appear towards the end. The mouthfeel is ok but could be a bit heavier given that it's a Porter. In general, this is a good beer but I wouldn't sit down and throw back more than two."
"Drinkablity: Well done porter that is a real treat. I wish it was easier to get a hold of."
"D-Its what i've come to expect from BBC a solid shot not a bad beer by any means but nothing to write home about and drag your friends over to try."
"The flavor is on the mark, delivering baker's chocolate and caramel malts that meld into a sweet honey, slightly hoppy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is just as a porter should be: spicy & well-carbonated with a medium body. Finshes a bit chalky and dry, however. All in all, a solid brew from the BBC and one I'll be sure to encounter further down the road."
"I was hesitant to try this as my experience with ""honey"" beers began and ended with Michelob's Honey stuff or whatever about 15 years ago, this is different. Poured into 12 oz glass forming a creamy light tan head that disipated quickly into lacing on top and around the glass. The color is mahogany with tan lights at the edges. The smell is all malt, toasty and some sweet note, caramel? The hops aren't there to my nose but the taste is sweet and the honey is very apparent up front. The taste starts with honey, then the malt is apparent and finally the hops, citrus somewhere betwixt oranges and grapefruit. The mouthfeel is different as the honey seems to linger on the lips and the malt on the tongue with a dry finish, overall the feel is almost tannic. Very intersting brew, perhaps a bit sweeter than I'd like for just kickin'back a few but I'll bet it's killer with seafood."
"This is a smooth beer that has decent carbonation and is a decent session beer just not the best porter I have had."
"A very tasty beer."
"D - Not the better of the Samuel Adams, but pretty good nonetheless. Very satisfactory."
"D - Not too bad. I could do another one for sure. Improved more as it warmed and left me open to another."
"Overall, this well balance porter rocks. The honey shine through without taking away from the style."
"D- Drinks really easily. I could have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of these and not get tired of them."
"Overall a solid porter and worth getting occasionally."
"D- It is tough to see anybody going crazy over this particular style. I drank one, but was not reaching for a second one."
"This is definitely not bad. I've had porters I've liked more but a great example of the style. This went great with vanilla icecream."
"Sam Adams is one of my favorite breweries and this one dosn't disapoint. Thumbs up to another fine beer!"
"D: Perfectly drinkable, and probably a bit more appealing to the average beer fan for its sweeter and somewhat less robust taste for a porter. Still a decent amount of complexity and a nice offering overall."
"Drinkability: Might have had this one before, years ago. Another solid, true to style offering from Samuel Adams."
"12 oz. bottle. Pours a dark brown, creamy off-white head, excellent lacing. Roasted malts are evident in the initial smell. Good medium to full body with a syrupy feel. Sweet taste, the honey balances well with the malty/chocolaty flavor. Very good for a Samuel Adams."
"Got a couple of these from a SA mix pack. Pours a deep brown, almost black colored body. Nice tan head and quite a bit of lacing left on the glass. Sweet honey with roasted malts and hints of chocolate and caramel. Porter's are not my favorite style but this one is very drinkable."
"Good stuff. Not amazing but I'd drink it again."
"One of the best beer offered under the sam adams name. Pours a deep brown color with off-white head which falls back to a ring of bubbles and laces nicely along the glass. Flowery clover honey dominates the aroma, with a hint of roasty malts. The taste falls the same way with honey flowers jumping out and then falling back to a tasty roasted malt finish. The caramel malt isstronger in the flavor then the aroma which makes this beer a winner for me. It's a little dry as most Honey beers are, but I could definatly drink a few."
"Easy to drink and nice feeling beer. One of my favorites Sam Adams beers."
"M:not bad... carbonated, and not very bitter. leaves a roasted malt taste all around."
"Good stuff. Definitely worth a try."
"This beer poured a very dark brown with some red highlights and a single-finger lingering tan head. The smell is mostly malt with some toasty and caramel character. The taste starts off with some roasted malts with a little bit of hops in the middle with a very organic honey-taste all throughout without making it too sweet. The mouthfeel is a little thick with low carbonation. This beer sits a little heavy and I probably wouldn't want or need more than one, but it's a little drinkable than most porters."
"I had high hopes for this one and I must admit my first impressions were OK, but the beer tasted better as it warmed a bit. Nice brown/black (read ""cola"") color in the glass, with a decent head and soft carbonation. Smoky malt in the nose and in the initial taste. Sweet honey and a hint of astringent alcohol at first, a richer dark malt and a smooth roasted caramel emerged the longer it sat in the glass. Sam Adams--no matter the variety--has a unique flavor in the mix, and this was no exception. Great beer, but there are better porters out there."
"D - A great drinkable porter, perhaps a good introduction to the style. Nothing overwhelming or groundbreaking, but still an enjoyable drink."
"Very drinkable, though a bit sweet for my preference. Sam Adams does a great good of opening the door to the craft/micro brew world. They show the depth and the flavor available without going over the top. While my tastes have grown to appreciate the bigger brews more, Sam Adams is still a very enjoyable treat every now and again."
"D- Sadly I didn't really like this one. Porters are even my favorite style. I don't know what it is but I won't go out of my way for this."
"Notes: A good porter. I just don't like honey and despite that I thought it had good drinkability. I would only have one and I buy it once in a blue."
"Drinkability - Have one more sip in the one I poured in my Guinness pint glass, definitely looking forward to #2. Smooth and tasty, a pleasure to make the acquaintance of this beer."
"D: A porter that you could easily have a few of. Balanced sweetness and a nice creaminess that makes for a smooth drinking beer."
"Palate has honey at the entry and exit, with a carbonated roasty focus in the middle. Good on drinkability, and a touch of honey remaining in the aftertaste."
"Purchased as part of ""build-your-own-six-pack"" at local grocer. Poured a medium, very foamy head on a very dark body. Smells were very light, nothing stood out too much, rather odd for porters I've had. Taste was exactly what I'd expect from a dark, mainly caramel, and a touch of chocolate. The honey was in there also, but I would have just chalked it up to ""sweetness"" had it not had honey in the title. Very light, and smooth. Not the biggest fan of darkers, but this was pretty good stuff."
"D: Pretty smooth good beer, I just wish didn't have that slight medicinal/alcoholic taste at the end."
"Very good interpretation of the style. I've been having fun with the Samuel Adams samplers lately and this beer, just like the last few I've had, have been very accurate to the style and very quaffable."
"D: It is a solid porter, a tad on the sweet side, but enjoyable."
"Quite drinkable. Picked up a 6 pack of this and I'm looking forward to the remaining 3 bottles. One of the best SA beers I've had (and I'm not a huge SA fan)."
"Drinkability is great"
"D - Nice porter... Can't smell or taste the honey, but that doesn't take away from an excellent brew... I love the fact that it isn't too heavy..."
"Extremely satisfying. Very full tasting mouthfeel. Lots of roasty malt character. I can't believe how satisfying this beer is. A great choice if you only want to drink one beer. Not too sweet, not hoppy, very balanced. I love this beer. Another fine achievement from SA."
"D: for being a slighty under-average porter, I could probably drink a few."
"It wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about."
"This is a very good porter. The honey aspect really makes a bit unique. I didn't quite know what to expect from it. I honestly have been sitting on this bottle for a while. I just wasn't that excited about it. Very pleasant surprise. Another fine beer from BBC."
"Overall, pretty good. Would definitely recommend."
"Surprisingly complex. Mouthfeel is too thin, but a good porter."
"Samuel Adams = great porter-making brewery!"
"Smooth and juicy lip-smacking with a lingering sensation of soothing honey. Excellent drinkability."
"Drinkability here is average. If I'm in the mood I might get some more."
"I wouldn't buy a sixer of this, but I'd be glad to get this in a mixed pack and finish it off. It's just a bit too sweet for me to finish off a entire sixer."
"Being one that enjoys the taste of honey I had high hopes for this beer. Unfortunately it was a little too raw for my liking. Nevertheless I am not averse to trying it again in the future."
"Drinkability: Very well. It's a really fun porter to drink, because every sip reminds you of how dominant this porter's personality is. I don't know if I would have necessarily picked ""honey"" to modify the name of this porter. The very noticeable roasted malt is what gets my attention every time."
"D - I could go through a sixer of these pretty easily. Pretty good."
"Dark brown color with a nice tan head. The nose has soem roasty malts, smoke and some sweet honey. The flavor is also very toasted and clashes a bit with the sweet honey flavors. Could use either more hops or malts to balance it out. Well carbonated crisp body. A little strong on the honey, but a decent beer."
"Sam rarely makes a bad beer. This one is good too. It is a smooth, clean, sweet beer as expected by the name. Strong malts, light on the hops, pours clear brown/gold. Moderate head which lasted a while with light lacing. Smelled like sugar and cookies (? weird, but not unpleasant) Another good beer from SA - drinakble, but for a similar taste with more character, try a Moose Drool."
"overall this is a good brew"
"Dark brown almost black porter with a thick foamy head.Taste is caramel and honey.I have drank many Sam Adams products and have enjoyed them all!!This is no exception,I will buy again and recommend to anyone who will listen to me.I think I see a Sam Adams craft pack in my future."
"D- This beer has one of the better honey flavor I have tasted in a beer but the porter is a bit weak. The tartness at the beginning is a bit to much and after two classes I thought there was an on taste of old man smell that I could not get out of my mind."
"D- I'm not sure I could have more than one of these per sitting, but a great brew nonetheless."
"Worth a shot..."
"M&D - Nice carbonation; goes well with the malts. Flavors are a feeble when held on the tongue for awhile. Hops coat the palate after swallowing, but fade off quickly, which sets me up for another sip. Very drinkable and enjoyable porter!"
"I got this in the Same Adams Brewmaster's collection six-pack. Poured from a bottle to a pint glass, it poured a beautiful opaque almost black color with just the right amount of head. It was sweet with the honey with the deep malt flavor of the porter. Probably one of the best beers I've had, odd since it's from one the bigger names in beer. I absolutely just love it."
"D- Good drinkability. Not really overpowering. Could drink quite a few of these."
"My favorite style of beer is the Porter, but not this one. Let it be known that I'm not a big Sam fan...and this beer doesn't help. The honey flavor is most overpowering - I don't understand how they can claim any kind of spiciness as there is none. This beer's aroma is simply honey...nothing else...no complexity at all. In fact, all that I can say about this one is its appearance as it does look very tasty and full. I have a couple more in the fridge, but I will most likely not buy or drink this one again as there are PLENTY of better quality porters available....even in Alabama."
"The aroma is of sweet bready grains and honey. The flavor expands on the honey, adding a small, but crisp hop bite with subtle chocolate and caramel malt flavors. The flavor is a touch plain, but the overall feel has a great balance between the honey sweetness, dry malts and hops. Worth a try if you like honey, but this can't stand up to most porters."
"D: Nice beer, but I couldn't drink to many in one sitting. I will pick up a six pack from time to time to have a reliable beer at home."
"D- very supreme d, mild flavor and sweetness makes it sweeter than even a milks tout, and sort of reminds me of burnt chocolate milk...nice, jim."
"Samuel Adams Honey Porter pours a dark mahogany brown with a thick tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. There is a nice roasty malt aroma. The honey is definitely noticeable in the flavor, there is a nice sweetness that balances well with the roasted malt flavor/ bitterness. I get a little bit of cocoa, but not much coffee. Enjoyable."
"Mouthfeel is spot on medium. Carbonation seems just enough. Drinkability is good. A true sessionable beer with good flavor."
"D-I dont see why you couldn't enjoy these all night. There isnt alot of abv so enjoy."
"D = This is drinakable but I'm not sure I will search it out again. With a very swweet smell and bitter taste it just seems like a confused beer."
"Drinkability: A very nice easy drinking nite cap beer. I was dreading the whole ""Honey"" Porter, but this tastes pretty close to a standard porter to me."
"D: For a dark beer, this is fairly drinkable."
"The honey porter is a fine looking brew with a thick light brown sea foam head that leaves tons of sticky lacing as it slowly recedes to a thin cap.The nose has strong aroma of honey and malts.The taste reminds me of graham crackers,for a porter it has a nice presence of hops,and mild alcohol that warms the tongue and belly.A heavy body paired with such sweetness is nice,but I would struggle to drink more than one or two."
"Drinkability- Heavier, more body, darker, and even tastier, than many other porters I have had before. I must note, that this is a touch sweeter than a traditional porter but I think it works great. This is a great offering from Sam Adams."
"Sam Adams Honey Porter pours a clear, dark brown/black with very nice garnet highlights when held to the light. A thick, sudsy, tan head covers the glass in lace. The swell is basically some sweet roastiness with a hint of spicy hops. The taste is sweet, roasty and smoky with some raisin notes in there. There is a bit of hop bitterness at the end, with a lingering aftertaste that makes my mouth water after about 30 seconds post-sip. A nice, medium mouthfeel rounds out this very drinkable porter."
"Served in my SA Sensory Pint. Enjoy before August notched on the label. Poured an opaque deep brown, almost black except for the deep ruby highlights when the light hits the base of the glass. Tremendous tan head cascaded over the side of the glass after the initial pour finally settling into a solid layer of foam leaving behind lots of sticky residual lacing around the top 1.5 inches of glass; lacing during the session was copious, but watery and did not adhere well to the glass. Honey and malt in the nose as well as a trace of coffee. Taste is similar to nose; however, coffee flavor reveals itself as a little burnt, but not overpoweringly so. Honey nicely co-mingles with the malty backbone concluding in a slight hops bitterness at the finish. Decent mouthfeel, good consistency, but a little too much carbonation across the tongue. Much more drinkable than I initially anticipated. Initially thought the honey character might be too cloying, but definitely does not come across as so. Flavors are very well-balanced."
"D perfect dessert beer but would likely drink more than 2 of these in an evening. Good porter with honey, as advertised."
"I anticipate the arrival of this brew from the masters at the Boston Beer Company. It has a lively aroma, has a good balance of body and smoothness, and has a hint of honey that adds a bit of sparkle to the taste, making this an all around good beer."
"Nice brew all around."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into my Val-Dieu goblet. This is a beautiful beer. Pours a viscous, dark brown with a big, frothy, beige head that sticks around and leaves pretty good lacing down the glass. The aroma is sweet comb honey and milk chocolate. The taste is interesting. There is a definite sour note to the beer, but chocolate, and extremely roasted malts both come out. Oh yeah, there is also the honey that kind of smacks you around. Mouthfeel is exceptional. My biggest complaint about porters is they are often really thin and overly carbonated. Neither of those qualities is present in this beer. It's nice and think, slightly carbonated and has a nice oily texture to it. Wonderful. While, I'm not a huge homer on the taste, it's still a pretty good beer."
"Poured into a pint glass this beer has a deep chocolate brown color with a light hint of amber color. This beer has a decent 3/4 inch head that is a nice cream color. The initial smell is of mild coffee and roasted malts with light hints of chocolate. The taste is medium bodied, slight carbonation with strong tones of coffee and mild hop balance. Nice combination, don't taste the sweetness one would expect with ""honey"" in the title, but a nice brew. Once again I am impressed with Sam Adams, truly ""a patriot and a brewer""!"
"Pours dark with light barely making it through a pint glass in front of a lamp. Medium-to-thick head. Smells like caramel with hints of espresso - I didn't notice the honey smell/flavor some have described. Tastes good and very balanced bitterness/sweetness - no extraordinary flavors noticeable. Very low carbonation and alcohol flavor and a medium-heavy body leaving a good flavor on the palette. This is a good beer, but nothing too exciting."
"All in all an OK beer. However I would put this quite low on my list. Especially compared to other porters."
"D - Good beer. Could see myself settling down in the winter in front of a fire and enjoying one of these fellas. Definitely pick this up if you see it."
"Tasty but I am not sure about drinking too many of these. Almost too sweet."
"Honey Porter, mmm, sounds good. A black pour is topped off by a frothy, two-finger light tan head. The head recedes slowly leaving a nice lacing behind. Has an aroma of roasted nuts and malts, dark chocolate, faint hops, honey and caramel in the background. Tastes of coffee with a slight creaminess inhabiting the middle. Underneath, hidden away, is the sweetness the name implies. A slight hop bitterness and essence of pine finish things off. Mouth-feel is smooth and medium bodied. The thinness that plagues some porters is not here, which makes for a perfect step-down from a stout in that department."
"Drinkability: Very fine beer. Would buy again. I could use a little more flavor hops though."
"One or two, at bedtime. Several with steamed oysters and horseradish."
"I wasn't crazy about this beer when I had the first one in the pack, but I enjoyed the second one quite a bit more. I bumped up my scores half a point across the board. I would go for another if I had one. This has been my favorite out of the beers in the variety pack. I'll keep an eye out for it in the future. Recommended."
"Pours a very dark brown with a bit of ruby highlights coming through in bright light. Plenty of tan head is produced as well giving a very characteristic porter look. Aromas aren't too intensely roasty, but they lend a coffee and chocolate note as well. A sweet floral note comes through as well, given to the EKGs as well as the honey. On the palate, things are much more roasty, however a higher than normal carbonation for an EP lends it a lighter body. The sweetness from the honey is borderline cloying for this style though as it should be a relatively dry beer. The finish is surely dry and bitter from the hops and roasted malts. Overall, a very drinkably porter, but I think it's a bit out of style with the honey and sweetness."
"Drinkability is nice, this one has that weird (for the ABV) alcohol warmth that may be my imagination, but I'm not sure."
"Drinkable, though a bit sweet for the style in my opinion."
"Nice frothy healthy looking head of dark foam sitting on top of a molasses color ale. Mild sweetness on the nose with some nutty elements. Taste is a somewhat robust porter style -dark roasted malts etc with coffee chocolate notes.There are muddy elements both in the taste and nose but they are fairly pleasant. The finish is nice and crisp which you wouldnt expect from a beer in this style category, Quite nice and more drinkable than you think when you first taste it."
"I like this beer although I find the smell to be a bit deceiving from what you ultimately drink."
"D: This is a well rounded porter, even if the aroma is underwhelming. I could drink several of these and not feel overly stuffed."
""
"At the least, just another reason why the Sam mix 12 pack is so great."
"Notes: This one is a great way to get one through a winter night.Cheers"
"Taste is of roasted malt, the honey is only slightly more noticeable in the taste than the smell, not overwhelming in honey though and a bit disappointing, the sweetness is balanced nicely by the bitterness though."
"Very drinkable, I could go for another right now."
"D: Nice, solidly crafted in every direction sweet and mellow and easy drinking, a very nice offering from Sam Adams"
"This was a nice porter all around and a very drinkable beer, even for it's roasted body. The honey flavor is a nice and subtle touch. Glad I tried it!"
"D - Pretty good overall, and a well put together brew. I'd have another no problem, definitely worth trying."
"Pours a dark brown with some reddish hughes with a tan head that was about one finger thick and faded in about a minute to a ring around the glass. I let the beer warm up a little and the smell of honey was stronger as the beer warmed. There is also a little roasted coffee smell in it. A nice honey start with a little spicier finish. Good mouth feel with a bit more carbanation in it when i drank. It is a very drinkable but is a little filling. Overall i enjoyed it"
"Pours a dark brown in color with an average tan head. The smell is faint and of sweet burnt malts. The taste is bitter at first with allot of dark malt flavorings, but eventually leads to some sweetness and a noticeable amount of honey towards the end, with the last bit lingering being a residual bitterness. Feels pretty carbonated, so the mouthfeel is not to light, and the drinkability is pretty good. This is nothing I would go out of my way for, but a good change up beer in the mix pack."
"This is a very well made, very drinkable and enjoyable brew."
"Notes: Sadly disappointed, as I had heard good things about this beer. This was, to me, a fairly one dimensional beer that didn't excite me in the way I hoped it would."
"Ok,a little bit out of balance on the hops end of it, just a bit to tart and bitter than i would want in a porter."
"D - Very drinkable. Couldn't use as a session beer however because I just can't do that much sweetness for very long."
"D: Goes down smoothly and is quite filling, it's tough to put down more than a few. An overall excellent beer, by far the best I've had from Sam Adams yet."
"Drinkability - Not a great Sam Adams brew, but it holds it's own. Worth a visit a couple times a year or so just to remind yourself. I nice little treat on winter nights."
"Overall: I got this one in a brewmaster's collection six pack some time ago. I was worried when I saw the date that the bottle may have gone bad, but this is not the case. This is an excellent porter, and the honey blends in nicely. Highly recommended."
"Not a exceptional porter but not bad. Appearance black with brown on edges of glass two finger tan head with good retention. Smell honey, rosted grains and some hops. Taste honey hint of chocolate and coffee enough hops in the end to make it well balanced. Mouthfeel mediem body mediem carbonation. Drinkability not bad this is a once in a while beer but I could have a few."
"d - just good all around. Nothing too excptional, but nothing is lacking. A great porter."
"D - interesting beer; it's a solid porter with faint natural honey accents too it; and it's very well balanced; with the word 'honey' in the title I kind of expected a sweet, cloying beer, this was a pleasant surprise"
"overall, a very enjoyable porter, the honey is a nice touch, hops used to good effect in this one."
"Mouthfeel is full (although not creamy per se) with plenty of tannic dextrins. The sweetness limits drinkability a bit but overall it's such a well-made beer that it can be overlooked. Great offering from SA. Should be a year-rounder..."
"This is a praiseworthy example of one of my personal favorite styles. It takes the classic robust porter and gives it a twist. The honey not only serves to balance out the roasted malt, but it is also darn tasty. Throw in the hops and this brew adeptly balances between three separate aspects, with the malts taking the desired lead. I mostly enjoyed the fullness of body and taste, as well as the uniqueness of the overall flavor. I think this would appeal more to those with an open palate, for it is not for the faint of heart. I would certainly welcome another and I would feel comfortable recommending this to anyone wanting to try a well made beer with a strong honey presence."
"sweetness may limit mulitiples but nice in moderation."
"Drinkability - ok, nothing special."
"Overall a solid porter, definitely worth buying again."
"Very nice and drinkable."
"Appearance is very dark brown with deep ruby highlights. Thin cream-colored head that dissipated quickly. Roasted and somewhat burnt nose, somewhat faint but pleasant. Sweet and slightly burnt malt flavor with a slippery mouthfeel. The sweetness of the fairly big malt with the touch of honey is very well balanced with the bitterness. Hop balance is spot on. Could definitely drink a few of these in a night, but would mingle with other brews."
"Served in my complimentary Sam Adams glass. Color is a rich, dark brown with a white head that laces nicely. Aroma is sweet and malty. Taste is quite sweet; the honey is a nice touch that works well with the toasted malts. Slightly burnt aftertaste. Quite and easy drinking beer."
"Definitely a really cool beer."
"Drinkability - lots of flavor without being too sweet. I find it highly sessionable."
"D - Overall it was enjoyable and tasty. Very easy to drink. I would drink the rest no problem, recommended."
"Good stuff, even if the honey/burnt flavors become a little cloying midway through the glass. Genuinely full of flavor and definitely not boring."
"Smooth on the way down. Leaves you with a nice dry taste at the end. Makes me want to take another sip, giving it a nice drinkability as well."
"Overall a very drinkable beer, the honey is there but BBC has done a good job of balancing this one out with some real hop character, which is often lacking when brewers use honey. Very sessionable, IMO. One of my recent faves from BBC."
"D - Very solid beer that I will drink happily when available."
"Recommended to the porter/stout crowd."
"Could have a few of these without any problem at all, though again a bit muted for my taste and for that reason would rather drink something else."
"D: This is very quaffable but pushes my limits for a session at 5.45% ABV. It makes a great couple of beers on a weeknight though."
"Pours a really dark brown, almost black, with an off white, very thick lacy head. It has a very sweet malty scent with a hint of dark honey. The taste is good with sweet, dark roasted malts and a hint at the end of a honey aftertaste. I really enjoyed the flavor, especially the aftertaste. It has a good mouthfeel and it is a very drinkable porter. I think this is a good porter and I would recommend it for sure."
"An enjoyable beer that leans to the sweet side....a little more body a bit more 'hops"" would make this truly special...as it is, it is pretty good"
"a nice beer. there is a lot going on to ponder about, yet the ease of drinkability erases any lingering questions."
" It's worth a try if you see it in the store and aren't opposed to sweeter beers. This one has some interesting flavors but still has a good porter finish."
"D: A little too sticky-sweet on initial taste, and doesn't really beckon for another too quickly. Not something I could see myself rushing out for, but it smells alright!"
"Pours dark brown almost black in appearance, but is more brown with red hues in direct light. Has a nice 1/2 inch of creamy tan head with average retention and good lacing. Smells are sweet, of honey, caramel, and some chocolate. Tastes of burnt wood, coffee, caramel, nuts, chocolate, and honey mixed with a nice bitter hoppy finish. Medium in body with good carbonation and a creamy character. A little too sweet, but still easy to drink with a nice chocolate presence."
"Poured into a mug and got a almost black body with slight head and not much retention. Picked up honey and malts in the smell, but not much else. The malt presence is heavy in this but there is a smooth aftertaste of honey, but not much else. I could have one or two of these here and there. I am disappointed, this just isn't one of Sam Adams better offerings in my opinion."
"D - This is a pretty good beer. Balance of flavors was good. It was also very clean and smooth for a porter. Over carbonation is holding this one back a little."
"A deep dark brown/black pour with a thick, sticky tan head that catches and cusions the final drops of beer. Smells very rich and malty with honey sweetness. Very nice aroma. A malty, nutty taste with a noticable sweetness and a touch of bitterness, but not too much of either. Lots of carbonation and a hair shy of the body and richness I hoped for. Slightly thin on the palate but a small nice malty honey aftertaste. All in all, a quite good beer, that looks and smells great and tastes nearly as good. Worth drinking again."
"Drinkability- This is nice to drink in a sitting, but to drink many you have to really love honey in your porters. This one is a bit too sweet for my tastes and I'll have to try to drink the rest of them in a different sitting."
"I was looking forward to trying this, but I was disappointed. All and all an average beer in my opinion."
"This was a nicely done and drinkable Porter from Sam Adams. I was especially surprised just how deep the roasted chocolate came through. It's definitely worth a try."
"This one is a little off stylistically, but tasty, though I wouldn't buy it on purpose again."
"Picked up a six-pack on a whim, I will say if you enjoy Sam Adams brews this ain't bad. What I really mean is...If you are looking for a porter and this is available you can't really go wrong with Sam Adams Honey Porter. A fine example of a what a porter should be. And if you've got friends who are easily impressed by appearances this gal is a looker in the proper glass. Cue the catcalls when your pour this fine lady!"
"Drinkability: This beer is pretty drinkable. It's also pretty average."
"pours a very dark color with a big foamy head like a rootbeer, does not dissipate at all. just hangs out like a 3rd wheel on a blind date. smell is interesting, i smell a slight spicy hop aroma, followed by some strong roasted malt accents. even smells full bodied, if that makes any sense. not a huge fan taste side, its just kinda odd, not my cup of tea. i mean it isn't bad, just not good.i really can't put my finger on it, maybe its the honey, but i'm not a big fan"
"D: A fairly drinkable beer. An ok taste with a good mouthfeel makes it an ok porter overall."
"Still, I liked this beer and look forward to having it again someday."
"D: very drinkable. very sessionable. A six pack would be nice but I'll have to settle for two at a time."
"I managed to find a six-pack of this guy and promptly destroyed it. You can smell the hell out of the honey scent and taste it a bit too. Goes quite well with grilling out. I'd say this guy is the absolute best of all of sam adams normal beers. Just outright delicous."
"To smell this is to witness its honey, sweet, and toffee aroma. As I sip this I detect earthiness, some oatiness, and a slight bitterness. The mouthfeel, is medium on the tongue."
"This beer came off a little brash. Was impressed by the roasted effect that I experienced on the smell and on the aftertaste, but it was almost a little too much. In a nutshell, I'd say that it definitely looks better than it tastes, but its definitely not a bad beer. Just mediocre."
"Overall: Great beer. It would be better if they came in their own six packs instead of having to buy the mixed six pack."
"It poured a nice dark brown color with around a finger of head into a Guinness glass i stole from my roommate. Slight lacing left in the glass and the head dispersed quickly. The smell of roasted malts was nice and the taste is quite pleasant. It feels good in the mouth and goes down smooth. I could defiantly drink a few of these."
"D - Extremely drinkable. Mild finish doesn't overwhelm the palate. As my dad used to say, ""Tastes like another one."""
"Mouthfeel is velvety, rolls around in your mouth, perfect carbonation. Immensely drinkable beer."
"Drinkability is hard to fault... flavors are complex enough to keep you interested but not too strong to slow you down. My first porter and the best SA product I've tried so far!"
"very drankable, sessionable porter. Not he best by far, but still worth having a few around."
"An opaque black that has a chocolate brown tint to it on the edges. The head is the a cappuccino colored froth that leaves about a one finger head that seems to go away a bit fast. Smells of roasted malts and a hint of sweet honey. The taste that first hits the tongue is the bitter coffee taste, which comes in with a lot of carbonation. Almost too much for my taste as it seems to deaden the tongue. However, that bitterness melts away into something much smoother and better taste of malts, chocolate and honey. Mouthfeel is alright as I still think the initial carbonation is a little too much, but overall a pretty good beer that I would enjoy slowing sipping down."
"Low carbonation and a surprisingly thin mouthfeel."
"I have shifted to lighter beers and american lagers so I was worried this one would be too roasty and filling. It does have a little roastiness to it but it is well balanced by the sweet honey. I find it very smooth and credit this to the honey. I have had many porters but they tend to be overly dry tasting, this one not so much. The smell is well balanced between hop and roasty malt aromas. I like it."
"Drinkability - Very rich and flavorful; well done. Robust nose and taste make it enjoyable. High alcohol and burnt flavor would limit this beer to, say, two a sitting."
"Pours with a nice light head, dark body, taste is not overly sweet, smooth. Not the most complex beer of all time, but pretty good for a major microbrewery like Sam Adams. Definitely would buy again, especially when looking for a nice beer to relax with or drink with a meal."
"Pours with a four finger light brown head leaving a good lace. Almost opaque deep mahogany color. The nose is light honey and malts. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy body. Flavor is a chewy honey/roasted coffee with a bakers chocolate finish. $1.50 for 12oz bottle from Capitol Convenience, Concord, NH."
"This is a good, easy-going porter. It is a very dark brown, rich with roasted chocolate and caramel flavor but not overbearing, and smooth to drink. Some might find the flavors or the roasted aroma a bit strong, but I found the balance to be just right. This is a very good beer to follow up on a good meal, but difficult, in my opinion to match with a particular meal. Great to have while relaxing on the porch."
"About as good as I remember it. Nothing exceptional, but a good drinking porter."
"This beer has a nice thick quality to it. It's the kind of beer I can sit and nurse the glass. It has a really nice malt and honey aroma, and a balanced taste. However, I found it a bit too thick to serve with food. Drinkability is what I found lacking in this brew."
"Taste: Medium bodied. Begins with a bitter black coffee flavor that quickly becomes overtaken in the midpalate by a hit of roasted malt and a touch of sweet honey that isn't overpowering but adds and balances nicely."
"Nice dark brown color. Good lasting head. I smell sweetness and roasted malt and a touch of honey. I think I can detect some alcohol as well. The taste is sweet with a honey presence. Accompanied by a roasted malt flavor. This is a tasty porter that has the sweet honey kind of flavor that it says it does but it is pretty thick and chewy. A couple of these beers would do you just fine."
"Drinkability: It would be tough to drink more than one in some period of time like a night but it definitely invites you to go for more later. The carbonation makes it harder to drink consistently and causes many belches for the ladies."
"D- Not a bad porter for it being a Sam Adams. I am not a did fan of the brand itself but I have had better beers from them. I have also had some better porters. All in all it is not great but not bad either."
"This is a pretty average porter. Nothing really stands out about it but definatly far from being offensive."
"Overall: not a bad beer at all, but nothing to rave about either. Porters are not my favorite but this is one I could drink again."
"The taste is also sweet, perhaps abundantly so. The caramel and brown sugar flavors come through, and of course honey. There is little to balance out this beer, which is a bit unfortunate. Mouthfeel is medium-thin, but it is not overly carbonated. Overall this would suffice as a dessert beer, but it's too sweet to pair with much else."
"The excessive sweetness renders this beer fairly undrinkable. One bottle is more than enough."
"D - The honey character in this beer is exceptional. It blends well with the darker malts and dominates the flavor profile of the beer. I can't see myself wanting more than one in a sitting but it is a very enjoyable beer."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and slightly creamy. Very enjoyable."
"Good balance here. Clean initially followed by a syrupy malt, then strong roasted and caramal malts followed by a peppered hop and a sweet honey laced finish. Great mouthfeel, chewy and thick, yet sublime in terms of it's drinkability. One of my favorites from the BBC."
"A fine brew overall, and I would never turn this one down."
"The taste is too sweet for me. Honey dominates this beer. It even leaves a honey aftertaste in the back of the throat like you just consumed a teaspoon of straight honey. I don't get much in the hops department which is a disapointment. I enjoyed one of these, will have to wait a couple of days before I would want another. Feels a little slick going down, slightly oily. Not my favorite Sam Adams but worth a try. I prefer a more conventional porter."
"Wow. First, it's appearance is nice and dark. The smell though is what gets you. Man, is that a strong smell of honey! The taste too is very strong with that smell. The taste has a supplemented roast feel that goes with its style. It has a crisp, light and incredibly sweet mouthfeel. That taste makes this very accessible for a drinking crowd wanting something sweet."
"Drinkability: A decent beer overall, great with strong flavoured fall foods. Definitely worth a try. I think drinkability improves a bit with this one if its not terribly cold, better at a cellar type cool than a refrigerator type cold. Also smoothness and drinkability increases if given a couple of minutes in the glass to release some of the carbonation imho. A good beer, and hey you can't go wrong with a Sam."
"D: A great little porter, one of my favourite Sam Adams brews that I have ever had, this is definitely worth another purchase."
"Nice drinkability on this beer. This is probably the best of the Sam Adams sampler pack I pulled it out of."
"First Porter I have ever tried so, really don't have anything to compare this to. Poured into a pint glass, Poured a very cola color, with a tan head that went away quickly. Moderate to no lacing, decent carbonation. The smell is this is of roasted malt, with just a hint of honey.The mouthfell of this beer is suprisingly light, given the color and overall look of this beer. The taste is the same as the smell, roasted malt sticks out, with a tinge of honey in the after taste. Overall this is a quality beer, but aren't all sam adams? I would definatly drink this agian, and want to try more porters for this one."
"This is certainly a drinkable beer. Love it? No, but I'd take it if offered without much hesitation. Consistent and in line with other SA beers."
"#5 on deck is the honey porter; it pours a deep reddish-black w/ a slight tan head which dissapates quickly, moderate lacing; nice malty aroma, very faint hop aroma, but, you can really smell the honey in this one; a smooth malt profile w/ a sweet nutty honey aftertaste; med body w/ a good balance; not a bad drinking beer, just maybe a little too sweet for me..."
"Not stellar, but a nice, accessible porter. The honey is a pleasant addition and not terribly overdone, though if you let the beer warm up enough to enjoy the aroma, it can become a bit much."
"Picked up the Honey Porter out of the Samuel Adams mix pack. My only complaint is that the Boston Lager and Boston Ale took up spots in the pack and only allowing two Honey Porters. 12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Dark color with attractive creamy head. Terrific roasted malts and caramel smell. Taste was terrific. Not at all overpowering on the roasted flavors, but still present and well balanced. Very, very, very vague hints of honey, almost non-existent. Like most porters, you probably wouldn't session with them, but I would definitely enjoy one or two on any night. Overall, terrific brew and perfect if traditional porters are a bit heavy on flavors for you."
"Poured it into my glass looks almost black with a brown head that leaves lacing on my glass. Has a good smell the chocolate smell stands out. The taste is pretty sweet with hints of chocolate. Mouthfeel is good it has a full body creamy and smooth. While this is a good brew its a little too heavy to drink more than two of these in a sitting. I felt like I drank a chocolate cake when I finished my two bottles."
"The taste is, for me, very rich in chocolate on my first sip. wow. After another sip, I notice the honey and it goes well with this Porter, and there's some roasted notes along with some bitterness that's most noticeable near and through the finish. Very tasty brew and it has a good thickish mouthfeel and light carbonation. Again I say, this is very tasty *and* smooth. I'd buy this again, oh yeah."
"drinkability is good. this is a full flavored brew that is put together magnificently. another Samuel Adams classic. cheers!"
"There is a lot going on with this beer. It has a sweet/smoky/chocolaty taste. I felt like this beer is a bit schizophrenic. It is certainly a high quality brew from one of my favorite brewers. However, I cant figure out where it is going. Every time I picked it up to take a sip it was a different experience. Maybe this is what the brew master was going for. wont buy it again unless it is in a sixer mixer(this was)."
"Overall Impression: Not being a fan of porters, I really enjoy this! The graham cracker honey thing really is unique and enjoyable. Great job Sam Adams!"
"Overall a nice porter despite the uncomfortable upfront sweetness."
"Very nice honey porter from an always outstanding brewery. Tried this at the Carolina Brewmasters meeting tonight and it was probably the best one I had. Very sweet with honey, of course, and what seems to be molasses. No hops to speak of and though it may be hard to drink a whole bottle, this sample hit the spot."
"D: Probably the most drinkable porter I have tasted. It has a lot of flavor and is very smooth. It might be too sweet for porter-purists, but I really like it because it lacks much of the usual musty astringency of other porters."
"Full bodied and very sweet. If this beer was drier and turned the roast up 5 or 6 notches, it would be good. As it is, a sweet mess reminiscent of sub par brewpub fare that really turns me off. Not like any porter I've ever tasted."
"A tad sweet, but not what I was expecting, being a ""honey porter"" and all. (Not as SWEET as I thought) Very drinkable....dark, of course, and as smooth as can be. Malty and roasted flavors shine through. Very nice and fairly drinkable. Couldn't do more than a couple of these in a row, though. Part of the ""Brewmaster's Collection."" Try it if you can. I'm sure you'll like it, if you like this sort of brew. Cheers and SAAALUTE my BA friends!!!"
"I poured this nice brew into my tumbler at 50 degrees. It poured a nice thick black rich tar color and had a fair tan head. The taste was nice coffee notes with a slightly roasted burnt taste that I liked. The beer was almost chewable and I liked it a lot. I will buy again."
"A damn tasty and easy to drink beer that I really wish I had a growler of for the weekend. Super tasty beer and one that absolutely deserves to be available year round."
"Poured out of the bottle with a wonderful head, trailing up as good as any other porter I've seen. It has a really interesting dark color, with a nice light, caramel overtone, making it a bit lighter than other porters. Wonderful smell, coffee-like with a hint of sweetness, although it seemed more like a sugar than a honey sweetness. It's taste erased any worries on that issue, though. Wonderful porter taste, dark, thick, and coffee-like, with a hint of chocolate and caramel, along with a nice sweet, honey-like aftertaste. Goes down fairly smooth."
"This beer looks so dark and mysterious when you pour it. I used to love when this and Sam Adams Dark Wheat were brewed. Thank god they re-introduced this beer. Subtle and sweet smell of honey is the only thing I concentrate on as I love it! Honey, with hops, roasted chocolate. Great mouthfeel that coats your entire mouth. The finish is a little watery but wait a second for the sweet honey taste to get legs fill your cheeks and run down your beer tubes. I love this beer. I remember it being bigger bodied, but this is just fine. Great beer, Good times."
"Drinkability- A very drinkable beer, one of the best SA iv ever had."
"D: While a little too much honey for me, and just the fact that I normally dont care for porters, Sam Adams surprised me. This is a good beer for conversation and an after dinner treat. I would highly suggest it for the fall and late summer months, since in my opinion, its a good substitute for marzen."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black color with minimal head. Aroma is roasted with some faint hints of honey. Malty as well. Taste is much of the same except that the honey shows through by quite a bit. Sweet a bit and roasty with a nice aftertaste of honey and roasted malt. I definitely love how honey is incorporated into this porter. Very smooth as well. Definitely something I'd drink again."
"This would likely please your typical Guinness drinker, I found it to be not all that bad, would likely get this again, preferably on draught."
" Overall this one was a mixed bag. If I review it as a brown ale I would have to score it fairly high as it had a nice feel and a good all around flavor profile, however if I stick to the porter it just came off a bit too thin for my liking. I would have thought it could have been a little bit fuller. Even still, excellent session ale and a worthy choice in the series for sure. I would not turn one down if it was offered. I also would not by a sixer either, so definitely a bit of a mixed bag, but worth a try."
"Good no frills beer. Nice for when you just want a flavorful beer to sit back and enjoy. Nothing too complex or pretentious here. If you like porters, give it a shot. Recommended."
"It's back and as good as ever. It's gong to be one of my regulars again. Amen. Recommended."
"I usually think ""burnt"" or ""coffee"" when it comes to porters... this mixes hops and honey on the porter canvas. A hit."
"D- complex & tasty, honey is very well done, great balance, recommended, flavor may be a bit rich to pull a session with this though"
"Poured from 12oz bottle, last of a 6 pack sampler. Color is a rich mocha-brown with red hints to it. Nice thick, tan head with impressive lace. Good head retention. Smell is of mocha, malts, dont smell much honey. Taste is more so of coffee than honey. Sweet and malty, slightly bitter at the end. Leaves a dry, almost metallic aftertaste which isnt so enjoyable. Creamy mouthfeel to it. Its ironic because I got a six pack with their Black Lager and Brown Ale as well and I swear this is just the two of them mixed together."
"A very nice drinking beer. Wish they would do something with the smell."
"Drinkability: Just a bit to sweet for me; lacking offsetting complexity"
"D= This is a great after dinner beer but 1 or 2 is about the limit"
"The first chance to try this beer,poured into my Red Oak pint glass a deep dark brown with some ruby-like hue when held up to the light a large fluffy 2 finger almond colored head atop that left multiple sheets of lace behind as it settles into a creamy mass.Rather light aromas some roastiness bitter chocolate and the heather honey lingers nicely,a tad thin and fizzy in the mouth but not distracting.Flavors start out mild but become fuller as it warms a bit lightly sweet and definantly roasty a real honey flavor profile shows in the appetizing finish finish .Not the most complex porter on earth but its drinkable and just sweet enough,I like it."
"Drinkability - The beer itself seems to be of high quality, but this isn't my flavor. This beer gets a little bump for being one of the first brands to turn me away from macros."
"This dark brown beer has a nice fluffy malt chocolate head that sticks to the glass. heavy malt character, honey and malt chocolate in the aroma while the taste has a sweet, but not too sweet smoked honey-nut cheerios taste to it. Nice little bit of hop bitterness on the back end to balance this fine brew. IMHO, one of Sam Adams' best brews. Glad to see it is in its own 6-pack now. Cheers."
"Pours clear reddish-brown in the nonic pint. An inch of creamy tan foam slowly recedes to a film and leaves very rich lacing on the glass. The nose is deep with toasted coffee and chocolate malt. A bit of prickly hop and lactic sourness in the background. The flavor is similar, though significantly less bitter than the aroma. Smooth creamy chocolate and coffee malts interspersed with sweet honey and milk. Body is medium-rich with plenty of creaminess and only a touch of carbonation. Timid compared to the big American porters, but pleasing regardless.."
"Two big thumbs up from me"
"Upon pouring I get a dark ruby brew with a nice head - this is one of the darkest Sam Adams I've ever had. Good lacing on the glass as it goes down. The aroma is of molasses and roasted notes. Good. The flavor is more grainy, with a little dark chocolate, and a sweetish bitter finish that lingers a bit. Pretty creamy in the mouth, solidly carbonated. For the most part, it went down pretty easy, too. This is another decent SA offering - not the head of the class, but well done."
"Pours a nice dark brown, with a solid white head and fairly nice lacing. Nose is strong on caramel, chocolate, prunes, coffee, and roasted malt. All over the place really, and in a good way. Taste is a touch more straight-forward, but still good: lots of roasted malt, breadiness, and light prunes. Body is medium, a little thin for a porter, but the carbonation is solid. Overall, this one's a good beer, one I'd definitely have again. It's fairly well-suited as a porter for newbies."
"Pours a nice dark brown color with reddish hue and light brown head. Hints of coffee and nuts and roasted malt on the nose. Initial chocolate and coffee then a slightly citrussy and fruity end that cleans the pallet nicely. Full mouth feel with very refreshing qualities. Very drinkable especially with fish and chips for me."
"Soon enough I will be brewing another batch of my honey porter and I'll sit down with it and Sam Adams Honey Porter to give them a proper comparison. Though I think it'll be too close to call."
"Nice attractive aroma that begs of you to drink it. Nice head and lacing on glass. Nice malty taste. Beautiful dark color. Sam Adams makes some really good dark beers: Cream Stout, Black Lager, and this Honey Porter are all really quality beers. Porter lovers give it a try."
"Pours out a dark, rich, somewhat translucent brown with a nice thick but not persistent head. Aroma is very pleasantly malty with smoky stoutiness and hints of coffee and chocolate. Flavor is rich, typical of a good porter, with a whisper of sweetness and just a touch of hops. Thick and smooth, this should please any fan of stouts and porters."
"I don't know how they do it but Sam Adams never ceases to amaze me. Consider my favorite style is American Macro Lager and other ligher lagers, every single beer they make impresses the hell out of me. It has great color and head, and good smell. The mouthfeel is excellent, not too heavy but full and rich. The sweetness of honey balances the bitterness of the dark malt. The hops are perfectly matched. I can honestly say I enjoyed this more than any other porter I've ever had."
"Pours a nice dark brown. There is a red hue if you hold it to the light. Thin tan head,with good retention,and nice lacing.Smell is of roasted malts, and honey. Body is light to medium,and carbonated. Taste is of dark chocolate,and honey. I could drink this all day long! Excellent."
"Turns out I really like this beer. Was pleasantly surprised. Not usually a big Sam Adams fan but this has to be one of my favorites by them. Job well done."
"This brew came in the Sam Adams mixed up six pack. I was sort of hoping the scotch ale would be found in here, but nonetheless I was happy to have three dark beers on hand. Poured into a Sam Adams glass a dark brown color, with rosewood hues when held up to the lamp in my living room. Head was large at first, then rapidly faded into a lace that held up well. In the aroma honey was all over the place. I have never smelled a beer with such sweet, rich honey inside. Although the honey dominates, there is some trace of molasses and carmel as well. Taste starts off very much like an English Porter in that it is dry and musty with some chocolate notes, but upon finishing the honey flavors come pushing through to leave a sweet sticky after tatse on the palate. Mouthfeel is right in the middle on this one. The tastes are big, but the body a bit smaller. The last time I had this brew was around Christmas time, when it had just begun coming back out after being retired for a while. At that time I was not so crazy about it, but now I am appreciating it a whole lot more. I plan on pairing this with something from the bbq. Cheers."
"This brew pours a clear dark brown color. The head is one inch in height, light tan in color, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of mead, caramel, and toffee. The taste is of roasted malt, caramel, honey, and has a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a porter, with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a prett good beer. While most honey beers I have had showed to trace of having honey in them, this one explodes with it. If only the porter beneath the honey were a little more vibrant, I would drink this beer a lot."
"Overall this is a solid beer from Sam Adams."
"All in all this comes through more like a weak brown ale with honey, instead of a porter."
"Pours out a browned ruby with a thick tanned head that forms a plateau in the middle with craggy steps going all the way down to where the head forms a uniform elevation. Leaves thick, frothy milk-like, raised lacing all over the glass. Aroma is of raisins, dates, plums, figs, chocolate, honey, nuts, bread, molasses, herbal hops notes, and faint coffee-like roastiness. Flavors starts off more along the lines of molasses and dried fruits. As it moves on toward the middle, chocolate comes out a tad, and by the finish, it is much more prominent, leading on into the aftertaste. Also, by the middle, I pick up some moist perique tobacco. The finish brings on roasted flavors and herbal notes from the Goldings with a pleasant and mild bitterness. Mouthfeel is a little richer than medium in how it sits on the tongue, and the carbonation is pleasantly present, but, thankfully, remains very mellow and creamy. Excellent porter. I'm kind of surprised Sam Adams managed to pull it off this well."
"D- an easy drinking porter with surprising complexity I will be going back to this one again and again One of my favorite porters."
"Very beautiful beer. Nice dark brown color. The smell of the honey shows through. Taste is extraordinary, with the taste of the heather honey blending well with the traditional porter flavor. Mouthfeel is nice, very smooth and palatable. Overall, a very nice beer to sit and relax with some friends with."
"12 oz. bottle, best before August '07; brewed with English hops, Scottish heather honey, and dry-hopped with English Goldings. Served in an SA Double Bock tulip, it pours dark mahogany at the bottom, and near black on top, with light carbonation, and a finger of khaki head that compacts, then slowly subsides into the (unfiltered?) body; however, the head never disappears, and leaves loads of lacing on the glass. On the palate, there are roasted and lightly charred malts, hints of coffee and green/spicy hops that eventually emerge, bringing with them a slowly-increasing bitterness. The body is medium, quite smooth - almost feeling conditioned - with medium carbonation and finish. Overall, a pretty solid effort, but it is more mellow than I'd like. It beefs up as it warms, but a more robust brew would be ideal. Still, a unique brew that I'd definitely revisit."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little off-white head, some nice sticky lacing afterwards. Then nose is sweet, malty, and lots of caramel. The taste is sweet, malt, some vanilla, honey, and caramel. This brew is smooth and got a nice carbonation kick. Medium body. Very drinkable, glad to see this one finally show up here in utah. Recommended."
"This beers appearance is great large rocky textured tan head above a dark ruby almost black body with much eye appeal. Aroma roasted dark malts creamy sweetness charred roasty character with herbal hops no overt honey tones but subtle mellow sweetness is there. Flavor is clean charred malts give a bitterness creamy overall with a honey finish to it hidden sweetness among the dark roasted barley malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied even light for some porters but carbonation levels are great no need to worry. Drinkability is solid a staple for most beer drinkers into dark beer living in WV we don't have many options but this is a great even porter that I would welcome anytime."
"D - good brew, filling, but none-the-less still has good drinkability."
"I saw this one mentioned in the ""What is a Porter?"" page and when I saw it in a variety pack I knew that I'd have to give Mr. Adams a chance. Boy am I glad I did. This one pours a dark brown, with a khaki colored head. Smell is bombastic, malt, cocoa, toffee, and coffee all vie for the top spot, and manage to blend together rather well with just a hint of sweet honey. Taste is very much the same, with the sweetness of the honey helping to balance out the bitterness of the coffee and cocoa flavors, while blending marvelously with the toffee. Mouthfeel is very good, this one manages to be hearty and crisp at the same time, and goes down very smooth for such a rich brew. Drinkability is good, though I might be singing a different tune had I had more than one in a sitting."
"D - A bit too sweet for me, but still a nice porter, indeed. I didnt taste too much honey, but I still think the name fits, because it denotes a sweeter style porter, and that is what this beer is."
"My first impression of this beer was good because it had an excellent sound when I opened the cap. It poured a deep mahogany color with a fluffy off-white head. There is honey present in the aroma along with a malty background. The boldness of the aroma left something to be desired, especially because I served the beer on the warm side. The lightness of the body was pretty surprising for a porter. It should definitely be heavier in my mind. The flavor is pretty light as well but very smooth until the end. There is a bit of creaminess in the front of the palate along with the honey flavor and malt background. At the back end though, there is a bit of a bite that I can't quite place. It's not an off-flavor, but it doesn't sit well with me. Overall a pretty average beer."
"D: This is a good solid beer. There is not as much sweetness as I expected and that's definitely a good thing. I would certainly recommend this beer."
"Honey through and through and very sickly sweet. Full bodied and smooth. Malts are present and very little hops, no bitterness to balance the flavor. Very sweet from start to finish. Not good at all. I won't ever get this one again."
"Though maybe not a classic example of the style, this is a fantastic brew and definitely something I could drink all day."
"Had a chance to try this on tap this past weekend at the Magic City Brewfest. This was one of the offerings that really stood out. A good looking beer; nice taupe, creamy head, with good head retention sitting atop a mahogany-colored brew. Aroma brought forth hints of malt sweetness, toasted barley, and maybe a hint of cocoa. Great tasting beer as well, with notes of sweetness, and just a glancing of dry, honey sweetness at the back of the throat. Overall, this is a really good beer. Must have tried 50 different beers that day, but this one really stood out."
"Recommended"
"Although it tastes more like a brown ale than a porter, it is so delicious that I could care less."
"-Oelergud"
"Medium body, moderate carbonation. Balance is good. Flavor and aroma are both a little subdued for a porter. The roasted malt characteristic is there, but it just doesn't have a lot of punch...way too subtle compared to some of the better porters out there. Based on that, I'd have to rate drinkability low since I'd certainly reach for a variety of other porters before this one."
"I've heard much about this beer, but only recently has it been distributed to Central Kentucky. Turns out to be a fine beer. A moderate to light Porter character shows light (Columbian) coffee, a hint of chocolate, mildly roasted grains and a lot of yeasty flavors from the fermentation. The body seems light, maybe toward Brown Ale proportions. The honey adds a subtle, underlining sweetness, perfumy aroma, and a delicate spiciness. Finishes a bit on the astringent side...seems to be typical of roasted grains in a lighter body. Otherwise a fine beer."
"It pours into the glass a very dark brown hue with a nice thick tan head that slowly simmers into a medium head with some good lacing. It has a very sweet, roasty aroma that reminds me of a mixture of chocolate and coffee. It has a nice medium feel to it thats really smooth and semi-sweet, and has a nice sweet aftertaste thats hides a mildly bitter kick as it hits the back of your throat."
"The first sip was watery, but that was probably from serving a little too cold. Even after I let it set and warm up a little, I wouldn't really call this a solid porter...good beer, but a little low on the totem pole of good porters."
"Pours a very dark brown with a thick tan head that stuck around for a bit. The head revealed some hoppy notes, but the most potent aromas were the malts and honey. The taste stuck with the strong malt characteristics with the honey not overpowering but balancing a good and sweet porter. The aftertaste is very malty. The mouthfeel is smooth and well suited for this beer. This one is an easy drinker, a very powerful taste, but an overall great beer. Enjoy."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and the carbonation is a little on the harsh side. Drinkability is pretty decent."
"Drinkability is great. I could enjoy this all day. Highly recommended."
"Good porter. Didnt blow me away, but tasty and satisfying nonetheless."
"Decided to give a bottle of this a try since it is probably my favorite style. The brew was poured to a dark brown color, looks like the color of cola with think tan head that had great retention and left a fair amount of lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is nice, malt sticks out giving is a sweet scent that reminds me of caramel and I suppose some honey although it is not screaming it. Has a smooth start which seems to have a break in the middle where the taste gets a little harsher from what I would presume are burnt/chocolate malts. The end seems to have a slight bitterness but I am not sure if that would be from hops or possibly burnt malt? Also has a slight metalic taste at the end. Regardless the end is nice, over all this is a good beer, are there better brews in this category, yeah sure but for it to be included in the brewmaster collection is fine by me."
"Taste: An excellent porter. Lots of flavor floating around with a body *just* thin enough to stay quenching rather than becoming a thick sipper. Well rounded, toasted malt gets things rolling and gives way to a bit of an herbal tea note. A mild honey tang in the finish along with light, leafy hops. Nicely balanced -- it seems as if the malt sugars are low, while what sweetness remains comes from the honey."
"Pours a very deep brown almost black with a thin head that diminishes. The aroma was heavy on black malt with a hint of chocolate. The taste was a good blend of chocolate and black malts with a slight bit of honey thrown in, almost a mead characteristic, but not quite. The beer is medium bodied with low carbonation. This is a very decent porter."
"Drinkability: The honey definitely makes this more accessible. Ill definitely have more of this if I see it around."
"Pours a nice black with copper highlights. Good head that fades a little quickly but leaves some okay lacing. The nose is all sweet honey and malt. Not bad. The taste is similar, but maybe a little cleaner than the smell. Very noticeable honey upfront. Not just sweet, you get the full range of honey fruitiness and floralness. This is followed by lightly toasted grain and a late malt hit. Fairly good mouthfeel, a little sweet,but not sticky. Could be a little more hefty in body. Pretty nice, I'm glad to see this is back."
"D- Maybe I'm just in the wrong mood for this beer but I just didn't like the flavor combo. The hops weren't assertive enough and the malt was too much carmal. And I didn't like the booze character either. But if you enjoy a strong carmal flavor and earthy English hops, this one is probably right up your alley."
"Worth a try definitly. If your into Porter."
"Sam Adams is really hit or miss with me. This one is a hit."
"OK mouthfeel, a little thin for a porter...the carbonation was just right. Easy do drink and mild alcohol equals a sessionable ale that's worth a try at least."
"D: This is a fine beer, nothing wrong with it, but the sweet and honey turns me off - just too sugary."
"D: I'd probably turn to other porters again before this one, but that's likely because of the sweetness."
"D- this is one of the most enjoyable porter's I have had (though my porter selection has been limited). It is very drinkable and smooth."
"I thought it was done well. Not bitter,not to sweet, sorta like a good bakers chocolate. The honey aids the mouthfeel by providing a smooth slick feel. That aids the feel and appeal for the use of the beer with or without a meal."
"A beer that truly lives up to it's name. A porter with a perfect balance of honey. It's there in every sip, and yet doesn't overshadow. It's scary that I remember this beer 10 years ago before it was discontinued. I'm glad they brought it back."
"Best before August 2007. Still-looking cola brown with a dense and thick khaki head. Sweet and roasty aromas, with caramel and toasted grains coming through most strongly. Getting really close, I pick up a faintly stinky honey/propolis aroma. Some herbal hop notes and a slightly sour scent are also present. At first, the taste is almost jarringly sour, as an acrid grain mash and grassy hop melange present themselves. Midway through there is a startling sweet soda flavor, like Mr. Pibb, I swear to god. Weird. The finish is a nice and roasty chicory coffee affair. Gently tingly mouthfeel, smoothish, and off-dry at the finish. All in all, I don't think it's a bad idea to put honey in beer, but I don't think it really shines as an ingredient in this porter. The weirdness of the initial flavors mellows considerably as I drink more, but this is still a less-than exciting porter in my book. Worth trying once."
"The first thing I noticed about this beer was how dark this beer was. I was expecting a lighter, more amber color, but the color of this was a nice deep dark brown. It smelled of bold hops, sweet smelling burnt malt and slight undertones of honey. It tasted alot smoother than I thought it was going to be. At first the hops and malt were especially pronounced, but the finish of this beer is outstanding. The honey balances out the hopiness and gives the beer a nice smooth, sweet finish."
"Pours a dark brown with a tan headskie. Tastes rich and malty, quite good for a honey flavored brew and the notes of the added honey do stand out but are not overplayed. Hops are well balanced and really bring the beer together. Really I was supprised that I like this beer as much as I did, quite drinkable."
"A very interesting beer from Sam Adams, and one worth a try if you like trying different beers."
"Drinkability - Pretty good, but there are far better Porters out there. This was well worth the spot it took in the variety pack tho."
"Dark root beer brown. Clean. Garnet edges. Thick, whipped, glass-crawling, medium tan head. Roasted cocoa and coffee with hints of honey, tobacco, and milk sugar sweetness. Nice. Solid roasted barley flavors. Light wood smoke and coffee, before singed, sweetish malt and honey come through. Roasted, dark chocolate bitterness and herbal hops in the finish. Medium-bodied with a creamy feel. Tasty with good drinkability."
"The mouth is smooth with low carbonation. This is an easy drinking session porter. Hats off to Sam!"
"It goes down nicely. No real complaints. But I'm not craving another either."
"Part of the brewmaster sixer along with the black lager and brown ale. Saw 'Honey Porter' and thought things could get interesting...poured into a Stone RIS glass and looked exactly like a Stone RIS would look like sitting in the glass! A good start, and half a sniffer full of head. The smell is very mellow, but it does have that honey aspect to it, its lost in the taste, but right before you take a swig, you get the affect. The taste is great, very mellow, and almost not roasty at all, especially for a porter. I'm starting to warm up to the black beers, and this is only helping me along. The moutfeel is heavy, I mean, it is a porter...I could probably drink a good amount of these baby's. Much mellower and drinkable than their black lager surprisingly. A very good porter, a good recommendation for those you are looking to get into a more classic style of beer."
"D - Pretty friggin' good. I like this, it's an outstandingly drinkable porter. I pretty much bought the whole 12 pack mixer just to try this beer and I'm not disappointed. I wish that I could get sixers of this stuff!"
"Overall, a very interesting sweet porter with an awesome new dimension of honey added."
"Certainly not robust, despite the label, but I wouldn't mind seeing it again in a variety pack. For a full sixer, I'd go with Sam's Cream Stout or Black Lager instead."
"Porter? You sure about that? Maybe an average brown ale, but this is nothing I will return to regardless of the style."
"I had wanted to try this for a while, it was on sale at a local store so I finally picked it up. I would say this is the first ""honey"" beer I've had that has really reminded me of honey. It is quite sweet but not overpowering. Pretty good."
"This is a great beer in many aspects. It's a highly tasty brew, and I definitely recommend it."
"Hits my tongue like a regular porter, strong and malty. But then leaves a honey taste lingering in my mouth. Smooth and slightly creamy. I liked it, and I wanted another!"
"D - A great exampole of what tastes can be achieved when honey is used with skill. Quaffable and smooth with traces of alcohol in the taste and lightly spicy hop adding to the overall depth."
"Very interesting, solid beer. Very poor style example."
"D - This is a pretty good porter. It really has a unique blend of flavors with the honey, caramel, roasted malt and hop spice."
"D: Nothing special, but decent and an interesting beer. I won't go out of my way to drink this again, but I would take one if offered."
"Bottle says best before August 2007. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours very dark brown with an inch frothy tan head. Lacing and read retention are both good. It smells like roasted malt, honey, and some kind of herbal/spice, although the aroma isn't strong. The taste has a good mix of bitter and sweetness to it. It tastes like it smells, but a bit stronger. Mouthfeel is on the light side, lighter than I'd like my porters to be. With that being said, it is pretty drinkable, it goes down easy and smooth. Overall, it's a decent beer IMO."
"Tasty but not I'm not in love with it. I'd have another!"
"I don't need too many of these in one night, but for a change-up, this is an excellent choice. You won't need to convince your dark-beer loving friends, and those that normally dont' like a porter will have a reason to pause at this one."
"My drink of choice is a nice hoppy ale but I thought this is very good and definately worth a try."
"Poured a very dark brown with a copper hue if that's possible. Some medium tan foam. The smell was of roasted malts and a hint of sweet spices. The flavor was of roasted malts and mild and sweet tasting hops. There were also a hint of spices. This porter wasn't a thick or heavy porter when poured or even while drinking this porter it was smooth and pleasant. Nice balance with out the tart or heavy aftertaste."
"it poured a nice light honey brown color with a tan 2 finger head. The smell was not all that apparent but was sweet-esque with a nice malt presence. The taste wasnt bad but i wouldnt call it great. It had a nice hop/malt mixed taste with some sweet honey finish to top it off. The mouthfeel was not bad a little bite but nothing too significant. The drinkablility was a solid 3."
"Too sweet for a session but two sounds good."
"drinkability - Was ok, not bad, but ok. I thought it was going to be sweet but it is still a porter. Its drinkable for me"
"This beer pours a deep brown to black color with ruby highlights the head is light tan and shows good retention and lacing. The smell is a full range of malts along with a touch of honey and burnt sugar. The taste has a strong malty base with slight bitterness from the malt, over the malt is a good deal of honey and associated sweetness, hop bitterness is low but noticable. The mouthfeel is good this beer has a nice full body the finish is dry but leaves a distinct honey flavor which gets a bit tiring after a while. This is a good drinking porter, slightly too sweet for my taste but good just the same."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a pitch black with a minimal head that leavs some thick lace on the glass. Smell is a malty goodness with roasted malt and barley, not a bad smelling brew. Taste is a bit malty with a little roasted nut and herbs, I can't really taste the honey in the brew it does have a bit of a coffee after taste. This is a bit different but it is nowhere near the hefeweizen that sam adams replaced it with."
"Very drinkable. I will buy a whole sixer of this stuff if I find it before the weather gets too hot."
"An extremely drinkable beer that I thought beforehand that would be a little gimmicky and too sweet before I drank it (much like Sam's Cherry Wheat). Very relaxing, could easily put down 2-3 of these."
"Pours a very dark brown, with only slight caramel highlights and a nicely frothed head that leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma has a sharp, burnt note to it that is pretty unappealing, along with some honey underneath. Some roasted malt characteristics as well. On the palate, sharp sweetness first off, then things smooth out with honey and caramel malts. Roasty and increasingly dry on the finish; there's some hops that come out toward the end. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, with relatively little carbonation; this beer could have used more to lighten things up. Overall, this is a disappointment to me. The burnt aroma was off-putting, and the different elements never really gelled -- the honey seemed to exist apart from the rest of the beer."
"Worth a try."
"Pours a clear dark reddish/brown mahogony with a giant dirty white head that leaves good lacing. The smell is light with roasted malt,coffee,expresso beans,and a honey sweetness. The taste is bitter from the coffee beans,but pretty good. Chocolate,roasted malt, toffee, and expresso beans make this a pretty tasty brew. The m/f is light with the flavors mixing well. Not a bad porter,good job Sam's for a quality porter and another different style."
"Overall, i think this is apretty decent beer. I can see how the honey in this one will come off as cloying with the addition to the other flavors, but i think in the mood, i really do like the sweetness contrasting the roasted flavors. The flavor in whole is pretty mild, making it a decent sessionable beer."
"The aroma has hints of sweet honey, nuts and roasted malts. The flavor is nicely spiced with hops and given a good amount of roasted malt taste. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy, but, this one is very drinkable."
"Well, it has the potential to be a good beer if they used a different yeast and/or fermented it a bit cooler. Too buttery and cardboardy for me to enjoy. An interesting stab"
"The taste of this beer is where it really shines. There is a solid porter base to this ale, no traces of roasted barley and small hints of bittersweet chocolate. The honey character is present throughout the entire experince, it is really comforting throughout the finish. There is a subtle earthy hop note in the middle that slowly fades through the finish. This brew is very dirnkable and it goes down smooth leaving you wanting another."
"12oz brown bottle with best before date of july 2007. Pours a dark brown with a one finger head, good longevity and good lace. Smells of slightly roasted malts, some faint chocolate, caramelized sugar and somewhat of a hop floralness. Decent roasted malt flavors with some slight sweetness fron the addition of honey. Roasted malt bitterness mixed with a hop bitterness in the finish. It could stand to be a bit smoother and creamy but still decent. A good American Porter."
"Not going to get this again. Tasted like a sugary Yuengling, and I like the Y! I don't like this."
"It's nice to finally have the Honey Porter back. It's just as I remember enjoying it during it's initial run back in the mid to late 90's. Great to have this one around again."
"A fantastic effort by Sam, this sounded so interesting I just had to pick it up in a sampler pack. I'd definately buy a six pack of this. I wasn't sure about blending the honey and porter flavors, but they pulled it off."
"The beer poured very dark, like strong coffee, with a brown head of foam, which dissipated quickly. There wasn't a strong scent of anything, but it smelled sweet. The taste was very sweet, but the hops come through a bit on the finish. The beer is well carbonated, not too fizzy. The beer was alright, but not up to BBC's usual high standards."
"Some roasted flavors and hint of coffee to join the dark malt flavors but none of the deep, strong coffee and chocolate I expect from a good porter. This just doesn't have the muscle I was looking for. Mouthfeel is fine but like the taste is boring and a little weak. Slight metal shows up as well in the finish. Overall a bit disappointing and closer to Sam's macro side of the family than its craft brew roots."
"Opinion: This is an OK beer. It doesn't suck by any means, but is not my favorite. I don't really like the balance in that it leaves you with some acidity and a bit of sweetness to linger while it doesn't really have the chocolate and roast that defines the Porter style. It is OK, but I would certainly pick up any number of other Porter beers before this one."
"Came as part of an assortment pack (Brewmaster's collecton of beers). The Honey Porter is a great twist on a porter beer. Starts out sweet with the honey flavor and and alot of malt flavor. Finishes like a classic porter with a roasted charrred malt taste. This is a great beer. Very drinkable by itself or with almost any food. Not too heavy but flavorful. Never have been disappointed with any Sam beer, excepting the cranberry lambric of which I was not a fan. Keep up the good work."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my Samuel Adams shaker glass. Best by August 2007. Appears the color of dark cola with two fingers of tan foam that leaves a nice lace on the glass. Smells of roasted, caramel malts, and honey. Tastes really sweet from the honey and malt followed with a slight hop bitterness. Medium in both body and carbonation. I would drink this again."
"Drinkability: Nothing overly special. I had different expectations for the honey in both smell and taste. While I will try this again, I won't be making a ""beeline"" to pick up a six pack."
"This was actually one of my favorites from Sam Adams to this point."
"Pours a dark brown with a nice tan head with good retention. The smell of sweet honey and caramel dominates the aroma. The taste was definately honey with strong caramel hints and even a light smokiness that permeated throughout. This is a very drinkable porter that I could session anyday. Hopefully some sixers are in the future for this brew!"
"D: Tone down the honey and this might be great. However, as it is now, one or two glasses are enough. Worth a try."
"D - Very nice. Smooth enough for enjoying multiple beers in one sitting."
"12 oz bottle. The liquid pours a very deep brown color with a finger of tanish head over top that sits nicely after the pour. The beer is very clear and there is a lighter carbonation working out of solution. The aroma brings a strong honey sweetness backed with a lighter toasted maltyness. Not a whole lot of porter going on in this aroma if you ask me. It almost smells a little underattenuated from the honey sweetness. Taking a sip I find a strong honey character, a mild toasted to roasted character, finishing with a moderate bitter that is a bit astringent. The aftertaste is a little solventy due to the astringency. Mouthfeel is light with a light carbonation, leaving a little to be desired. It is just very watery feeling. It finished a bit drying as well that accentuates the astringency. Overall, I am not as impressed with this as I would have expected to be. It really strikes me more as a brown ale with a major honey character. The astringency is not nice. I would pass this one over again."
"D - This beer is way to thin to be a porter, it's too carbonated and I prefer a darker malt character. A lot like other SA beers...completely misses it's mark or just leaves you wanting more."
"D - I could see myself having another one of these. Its a pretty good brew"
"Drinkability: This is a very interesting brew, I really enjoyed it...I'd say good call!"
"Enjoyable taste, nice and sweet. Really grows on me."
"Nice carbonation and overall mouthfeel. It is drinkable but only in moderation as due to the sweet, sweet flavor."
"And I don't, at first. The honey is waaay more intense than I'm used to. But I take a few more sips and get used to it and it turns out this is actually a damn fine brew. Starts out up front like a very dry mead, big roasted porter grains in the middle and a nice spicy English hop finish. All three stages are clearly defined and each wonderfully compliments the last."

"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich, roasted scent that boasts of chocolate and special roast malts. It's creamy with a slight honey presence. The taste is good. It has a dry roasted flavor that goes down easy and finishes smooth. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good porter. It's nothing too awesome, but I enjoyed it and would buy it again."
"A very dark reddish brown color. A one finger head which barely survived to the end. The honey aroma is very apparent, but seems to disappear in the flavor until the ""aftertaste."" This porter is lighter in feel than it's dark color would suggest, and has very little carbonation. The honey is a nice touch and I would definately have another (which I wouldn't say about most porters.) You can always counton Sam."
"Overall impression: Well crafted, nothing off, but very safe. Probably a safe ""gateway"" porter. I'm not sure I get the honey in this one but there is a definite sweetness that is detectable on the palate. I'd take anything from SA on any day of the week. I know they are more ""mainstream"" but they work for me. Worth a try at least once."
"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights, produces a small off white head. Smells of of coffee like roast upfront, sweet and roasty as it lingers. Tastes slightly sweet and roasty with some bitterness derived from the roasted malt. Notes of coffee and brown sugar meld into the roasted malt flavor, and of course a tinge of honey, finishing with a nice hoppiness... the residual sweetness/roastiness sticks around as well. Smooth as silk, almost chewy and very easy to drink."
"I can remember tasting Samuel Adams Honey Porter in the past and from what I remember, this new version of Samuel Adams Honey Porter doesnt taste like the beer of old. The original Honey Porter was slightly fuller in body and was a little more honey- accented. This newer version isnt the robust porter that the label claims- it is actually a medium- bodied brew and while the honey taste is obvious, it isnt as evident as I remember. Its a good tasting beer that comes up short in one main category: It fullness. The label claims its a robust porter with a full body but this is not the case. Its a little thinner than the Samuel Adams Honey Porter from the past but it is still a tasty beer in its own right."
"Drinkability: Great taste that will have you telling your friends to, ""try this out""."
"Medium pour into a shaker produces a voluminous, visually impressive head. Its a rocky one, almost orangey-tan, and with plenty of clingy lacing. More than any other beer Ive ever poured, this one looks like a root-beer float! The brew itself is a brilliant crimson-chestnut in color. Nose is a bit subdued, but theres honey in there you betcha, alongside pale and dark malts. Smells a bit sweeter than I expected. I did pour this cold, so I let it warm a bit. Smooth on the tongue, with a combination bitter, tangy, musty flavor. Sweetens, dries, and smoothes out midway through the palate, and finishes with an interesting, lingering aggregate, part roasted malts, part unctious honey, part bittering hops. Body is on-style, fairly light and very drinkable. Not nearly as sweet on the palate as the nose would suggest, and while the honey is a prominent flavor overall, I would imagine that it's an acquired taste in terms of a flavoring for this style of beer. As with coffee-flavored porters, I can usually put down one or more if so inclined, but I guess prefer flavored stouts! Maybe not a standalone brew, but I can't think of what to pair it with, food-wise. Definitely worth a try, and superbly executed."
"Drinkability: Though somewhat artificial tasting, this beer gives the impression of buttersctoch candy. Seems overly filtered, too."
"Samuel Adams Honey Porter was a mahogany color with good clarity. The tan head started out thick and rocky, than gradually receded to a thin layer, leaving some lacing behind. The aroma was mainly honey. The taste was a nice blend of honey, malt, and hops. It was medium bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was above average. It's a decent beer to have occasionally."
"Drinks fairly easy, not my favorite porter but a good, if over dry (too much honey) effort"
"Overall impression: Solid porter - the honey adds a bit of interesting sweetness, and plenty of other flavors to keep it interesting."
"A good porter, although not special."
"Drinkability--Because it is a more subtle porter than most, this is a very drinkable beer. Probably a good introduction to the style for someone who isn't overly fond of strong tasting beers."
"Pours a deep mahoany color. I'm sure if i poured it into the appropriate glass, head retention would be much better, but in my globe glass, the head settles fairly quickly to form a collar around the glass with some foam settled in the center of the glass. Smells absolutely beautiful. Honey and toasted malt flavors are pronounced, but not overpoweringly so. Just the right amount of hop bitterness, and honey taste to complement it. Slight drying mouthfell, but nothing that would deserve any lower of a score in that department. Very easy to drink, not like any porter i've had in the past. This brew is singlehandedly responsible for removing the words ""I hate porters"" from my vocabulary. VERY WELL DONE!"
"Full and creamy mouthfeel, a little chalky and tannic, not overly carbed. Pretty drinkable, but not overly complex."
"I was expecting alot more from a beer voted back into production due to its popularity. There was not a good balance of flavors here, and the bitter finish did not come out well. Not recommended..."
"M&D - easy down, a good college bar choice in a BMC world, not SA best offering but above tolerable"
"This beer is definitely worth giving a shot. I'm a big fan of thier holiday porter and expected something a little more malty and a little less sweet, but I guess this beer was true to its name. The quality is there, and it's something different to try, but it goes down as middle-of-the-road as Sam Adams beers are concerned for me."
"Samuel Adams Honey Porter well deserves the 'Brewmaster's Collection' moniker. Just as I suspected from the nose, it's an interesting, original creation that just about everyone should like. As far as I'm concerned, the craft beer movement owes a debt of gratitude to the Boston Beer Company. The combination of quality and availability in most of what they brew has saved me more than once."
"Beef Notes: Seeing that the old version of this beer had some high praise and the Holiday Porter is nothing short of delicious, I was rather excited to try this. It turned out to be just a little disappointing but still a solid beer. Try it at least once if you can."
"Very 'average'. Nothing bad, but nothing inspiring."
"D: Tasty so far as its something different, goes down easy, just a little bit filling, its a good beer but I prefer a little substance and a little more flavor when I go for a porter."
"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date into a pint glass. It had a dark color that was deep mahogany when held up to a light. It had a pretty good tan head that slowly settled into a foam. Some lacing. The smell was all honey with not much else coming to the front. The taste was just OK. It was basically a bland porter with a huge dollop of honey thrown in. Mouthfeel was good. Overall, it's just not a very exciting beer. It falls way short of being a flavorful out there beer and is just too bland and honeyish for a session beer. Don't recommend. (3, NA-BOT, Tie, O)"
"It's not chocolatey, although there is an edge to it, but mainly it displays deeply caramelized sugar, a dark fruitiness, a smear of ceral-like graininess, and honey. It's mildly roasty, but coupled with the dark sugar even that seems softened. The honey comes and goes, appearing in different places... sometimes at the start, and often lingering into the finish. The bitterness is more than firm, solid but not bold, but dull, perhaps muted by the honey sweetness. It finishes kind of dull and muddied, with some sticky honey (that's not necessarily sugary, but coating, and with honey flavor), and a solid bitterness and some dark malt acidity. It's very nice upfront, but offers a sloppy finish."
"I was pleasantly surprised to find this in a mix-pack - I hadn't seen this beer for several years and thought it permanently retired. Poured a dark chestnut with tan-tinged head. A bit sweeter than the average robust American porter, and a little less hopped. Pleasant roasted malt flavor with no grainy off notes, well complimented with the moderate sweetness. Finish was smooth with no acidity. A nicely made beer."
"Good smell and appearance. I found this bear to be very subtle in its flavors, where specialty brews like this can often be very syrupy. On drinkability, I wouldnt think more than two of these in a sitting would be recommended as it is still very filling."
"Drinkability- Fairly easy to quaff."
"A bit filling,but drinkable,neverless. A good solid beer,one to give a try."
"pours out an red\brown brew with 2 finger head. smell of honey,,mild licorice. taste very smooth like a mild porter. very subtle honey flavors,,very well balanced. mouthfeel pretty standard stuff . Very drinkable beer,,i could put a few of these away."
"I thought the honey would totally dominate this beer, but there's enough malt and hops to balance it out. It's very tasty and quite drinkable. I look forward to another glass of this beer."
"dark brown with a ruby tint to the color and a tan two finger head and a mild lacing to the finish. smell is roasted malt, coffee, with a mild honey coming through. taste roasted malt with coffee honey finish. mouthfeel is medium, good blending of flavors and just right carbonation to match. i was very doubtful about this one thinking the honey would be over powering or be weak bodied but its a very nice beer and its on my buy again list."
"D---Nice honey aroma and flavor but its a weak example of a robust porter."
"Drinkability: I'm just not wowed enough to go back to the well. If you like the flavor, you'd be able to down a few of these without getting bogged down."
"Pours a very clear, dark ruby-amber. The pale biege three-finger head is a thick cream, holding exceptionally well and leaving wide rings of lacing. Crystal malt, toffee and sack honey in the nose, with soft earthy hops in the background. Caramel and brown malt upfront, followed by herbal honey, a dark roasted flavor, and mild coffee notes. Aftertaste is dried by the roasted barley and a fuggles bitterness/flavor. I washoping for a more pronounced honey character,but it's balanced and the flavors meld well without need for more sweetness. Light-medium bodied and appropriate lower carbonation, a smooth ""english handpull"" type mouthfeel. Finishes easy; a touch roasty with some residual caramel/honey and earthy hop tones.This is a nice addition to the mix pack, and considering Sammy Adams resonable prices, I would consider picking up a six-pack if the brewery decided to market it."
"Poured into a pint glass. Looks like black tea - deep reddish brown with a nice, foamy tan head that sticks around the whole time and leaves some major lacing. Boy, this really smells like honey and I really like it. There's a slight roasted character and some floral notes as well. Taste is roasted malt up front with a dry hop middle and finishes a little sweet with the honey - an excellent dessert beer. Mouthfeel is rich, but it could stand to be a little creamier. This is a very good beer - very tasty. I could easily drink more than one of these, Recommended."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is very dark, almost black and has a tan, bubbly head. The smell is of honey, deep toasted malt, sort of reminds me of graham crackers. Taste is mainly of the roasted malt and has a smooth honey finish. Beer is lighter in body than I would have expected and has creamy carbonation. This is a very drinkable beer, light in body and a smooth finish. I would recommend this beer, not outstanding, but very solid."
"Overall a very non-offensive brew. As porters go, it's not a very good example, but it is still worth trying if you like honey in your beer."
"Cost $14.99 for Samuel Smith Brewmasters 12 box."
"Cheers Jim Koch for bringing this one back, hopefully for a long time."
"Extremely light in the mouth, due to the fact that when a brewer adds honey to wort it adds alcohol and lightens body. It goes down easily enough, feels just like a macro BMC in the mouth. I won't be buying this brew again. Doesn't have a good taste, and just sucks in general. In my opinion the only thing Jim Koch got right with this one was an appropriate aroma for a beer brewed with honey and a good appearance."
"D - Highly drinkable due to its sheer spectrum of flavors and uniqueness. My little gripe about mouthfeel aside, this is a nice drinkable porter that goes down ;ike a session brew but has huge flavors."
"I enjoy porters but sometimes the roast can be overdone, however in this case it was a little underdone. I am not complaining, it is a smooth drinking porter with a complexity brought out by the honey and what seems like a simple grain bill."
"Very SMOOTH, medium/full bodied, feels great in the mouth. Easy to drink. If you like porters, or honey, this is one to try."
"I definately recommend this beer to anybody who likes porters or honey. Both tastes are not overpowering, it's very well balanced, and that's why this beer novice likes this beer. It's a good ""platform beer," that is, a good beer to start off with and keep around."
"Pretty tasty. A sweeter beer, if you think about it, but seems to be balanced fairly well. I'm happy to see this one again in regular rotation. One of the best offerings from Boston Beer Co. in my opinion. Nothing crazy to hold up to the better porters out there, but unique and delicious in its own way. I do like this now, even though I could only manage 2-3 sips in my younger days. It's crazy how much tastes change in a decade."
"notched as best by June 2007"
"I was very impressed with this one. It almost makes me want to run out and get the 12 pack that contains it and the other goodies (Scotch Ale, Black Lager) in it. Perfect set of offerings for the winter time of year."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Nicely done, well carbonated yet smooth enough after rolling around in the mouth for a few seconds. It's really nice for the style, and it breaks up the aggressive honey profile. Easy drinking and a fun twist on a porter... I'm glad there are still five left."
"D- Good. Again, there was not too much honey. It added a nice sweetness to offset the bitter flavors. Could have a few."
"Dark and thick with a creamy head. Honey taste is welcome alongside a slightly roasted malt and somewhat pronounced alcoholic character (I wouldn't have minded that final quality being a little more in the background). Mouthfeel is round and syupy, but almost too much so. Residual syrupy aftertaste dominates the finish. Not my favorite SA offering."
"Sam Adams come sthrough with another very good brew. This one pours a dark caramel with a good initia head and some lacing throughout. The smell is an inviting blend of honey and malt. I'm almost tempted to heat it and see how it tastes. Taste continues the honey and malt quality...not overwhelming...just right. A nice dry finish balances out the experience. Mouthfeel as above is initially sweet, but with a very dry quality on the finish. Very good on teh drinkability scale...looking forward to my second."
"Pours dark brown with a some ruby and golden hues when held to light. There is a small on finger cream colored head that doesnt last too long. Aroma is slightly roasted malt, honey, toffee, and a hint of smoke. Taste has a nice roasted malt base with a nice honey presence. Mouthfeel is very smooth. A pretty easy drinker. A solid beer from BBC."
"I expected a honey sweetness, and got it, but some more balance would have been nice. A coffee-ish porter was present, enough to give it a decent taste when mixed with the honey, but not enough to round it out. Not a bad brew for but the honey sweetness was a bit too much for me, personally."
"This beer holds a special place in my heart. It was in fact one of the first beers I purchased when I turned 21. Truthfully, I can probably thank Jim Koch for opening the door to better beer in my life. I'm not sure if this recipe holds 100% true to the original, it's been so long since I'd had one that I really can't remember. But I will say it's a solid offering, and I'm more than happy to welcome it back."
"DA: This might be my favorite Sammy."
"There's not a whole lot of balance here, very sweet and very full of honey flavor; not a preferred porter for me, not horrible either. I just prefer more traditional darker porters."
"This goes in and goes down just like a porter ought to. It's January and I'm looking for something to stick to my ribs. It's creamy and satisfying without being overly filling. Also, the subtelty of the flavor leaves me wanting more rather than anticipating it just being over."
"Nevertheless, I'm glad this offering is back in the rotation. A solid porter and one that I voted for in the ""Beer Lover's Choice"" Sam Adams promo at The Linwood several months ago."
"Eric"
"overall pretty good but little too sweet for my tooth without anything to say wow"
"The Samuel Adams Honey Porter pours dark brown with a little red around the edges and a thin off-white head. The aroma is roasty and sweet. Taste also roasty and sweet, but sweeter than I prefer. Mouthfeel is good for the style. Drinkability is better than average, but I don't think I'd drink more than one in a sitting. This beer is worth a try."
"12 oz bottle from the new Brewmaster's 12-pack. Pours a beautiful mahogany black with ruby-red highlights and a nice half inch tan head that dissipates slowly leaving a fair bit of lacing. Nice maltly aroma with some honey sweetness. Taste is very smooth for a porter. Good roasty malt background with just a hint a sweetness from the heather honey. Very well balanced with a creamy mouthfeel. An outstanding offering from the folks at SA. Good job Jim!"
"Overall an OK porter that has a nice sweet/dry thing going for it. The body and mouthfeel seem limp to me. The flavors didn't stick around long as they quickly diminished after they hit the back of my throat. I've heard great things about this ale when it first came out 6-7 years ago, so I believe the recipe must have changed some (?)."
"Cheers!"
"Poured a dark , semi-clear brown , with a rocky tan head that left lots of sticky lacing on my pint. Aromas are roasty , burnt sugar , definate honey scent , and some sweet malt. Taste is smooth and roasty , with sweet honey throughout , just a little bit of bitter and lightly spicy hop in there. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Overall a very tasty porter with a good twist. The honey is definately noticeable , and makes the brew on the sweet side for the style. Once again BBC does not dissapoint."
"Sam Adams brought this one back from demand. They gave a choice between two beers and this one reigned supreme. I'm glad they brought it back, because this is one tasty beer with a bit of a sweet twist added to a great porter. Highly recommended."
"Very nice SA selection. Pours a near-black/dark brown body with a two finger tan, foamy head, leaving a considerable amount of lacing on the glass. Smell was one of honey, malt, and alcohol. Taste reminded me of a brown ale; a little bitter, with hints of honey that come through more toward the end. A nice smooth finish makes me consider having this as a session beer. Very enjoyable."
"I could definitely have a few. The medium body was disappointing, but helps its drinkability. You should try it without hesitation."
"An old style brought back by Sam Adams in the mix packs. Pours dark brown, almost like a dark ale rather than a porter. Smells sweet with some smokiness? Taste really nice, not too much like a porter but a not too sweet scotch ale, a hint of bitterness, maybe some honey in there too. Good mouthfeel. Overall I really like this, I was expecting this to be way too sweet but it isn't, really nice flavor. Should be a regular instead of a mix pack special."
"12 oz bottle from the new Brewmaster's 12-pack. Black body with just slight ruby-red highlights with a half inch of tan head that dissipates slowly leaving a fair bit of lacing. Smells like malt sweetness and honey, though aroma is slightly weaker than I would expect. Taste consists of equal parts roasted malt and honey with a hint of alcohol. Creamy mouthfeel. Wow. This beer is fantastic. Easily a new favorite!"
"A tad thin, but nice sheet laces throughout the quaff session."
"Colossal honey! I was really unsure what to expect from this one. It poured a deep reddish brown with plenty of CO2 streaming skyward. Gorgeous offwhite foamy head stayed in place for several minutes. Very impressive. The smell was almost entirely honey. There is some roasted malt in there, and a bit of earthy hops, as well, but you really have to search for them. The honey is really, um, ""present"". Taste, too, is loaded with honey. There is, however, quite a pronounced bitterness on the finish, which I would probably really enjoy, but I feel it clashes with the honey a bit. Interesting thing about this one, is how there is some malt present up front, then some honey, then the hop bitterness on the finish, then, several seconds after you have finished with a sip, there is certainly a lingering honey aftertaste. Mouthfeel was really average for the style. Not spectacular, but you could do worse, too. Not sure if I could session this one or not. More than two might be a stretch. It certainly is very surprising and quite pleasant to sit down and enjoy just one, though."
"All in all, I'll buy this whenever I see it. Recommended."
"Easily the best Porter in America. Lives up to its bold name too."
"12oz. bottle, with a freshness date of 06/2007. Poured into a pint glass, the beer poured a dark amber, forming a nice 1 inch thick head, leaving nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is roasted malts, and a little honey. The taste is sweet honey up front, followed by the roasted flavor expected from a porter. The mouthfeel is medium. I'm not sure I could session this porter, but one during a session wouldnt be bad. I've never had a honey porter before this one, and wasnt quite sure what to expect. It has an interesting flavor, but its not one that I would go out of my way to get. But with that said, this is still an offering from Sam Adams worth a try."
"D: Very drinkable, but not something I would want to drink several of all the time as this is defenitely a ""sipping, slow down and appreciate it"" kind of brew. Not just the taste, but I even found myself stopping to smell the beer a couple of times as I was consuming it because of its awesome nose. I used to not drink Samuel Adams, and I heard this used to be one of their beers they brought back. I am damn glad they did, a wonderful porter I will continue to enjoy."
"Crazy crazy head and INSANE RETENTION on my glass. It's a thing of beauty. The smell is very present with chocolate malts and some honey. The tase is smooth of cours with some chocolate malts and some honey. very well balanced and smooth. Could cling a litle better to the mouth and be a little more crisp, but nevertheless I could drink this beer all night."
"The active carbonation lends to the bite and sweetness of the honey. Not the smoothest porter I have ever had but still pretty tasty."
"Deep, rich mahogany color. Nice, tight tan head. Good aroma-theres a sweetness to it with an almost spicy or cinnamon air to it. Distinct metallic flavor upfront. Flavor fades to a sweet, slightly roasted tinge. Again I get a spiciness to it. Not a robust porter for sure. OK body. Overall a decent beer. Theres better out there-even from Sam Adams. Page says it's retired but I had thought it was rereleased due to popular demand."
"Drinkability: I would enjoy another, a great revival over all for Boston Beer Co. I would say it is worth a try."
"D- Not bad but not the Honey Porter I remember ... I am sure my tastes have changed but this one comes off a bit too sweet."
"Tasted: 12/15/05"
"The color a translucent mahogany with an average head, frothy and light tan in color, lace is a fine sealing sheet. Nose is sweetly malt, crisp and fresh, hints of caramel, start is sweet, top is middling in feel. Finish is brisk in its acidity, hops mild, dry aftertaste, Porter just barely, more like a Brown Ale to me."
"I was in good ol' store 2-4 when I spied a single of this. I bought it, date unseen. Tasted awesome. Well rounded and rich. It was like a time capsule of what BBC used to be like. I went back to see if there anymore, but alas, there were not. The last soldier."
"Over the years it has become more mellow and the flavors more blended. The smell is very rich of honey, roasted malt, raisins and dates. It used to be more roasted than it is, and it has become similiar to, say, Sammy Smiths Oatmeal stout with the addition of honey. Very delishious and yummy!"
"SA Honey Porter was one of those Porters that got me into Porters. It was just solid, and very enjoyable. I truly miss this beer, and thought it to be one of Boston Beer Co.'s finest products ... to be able to sample this after it's death is a grand thing. I think I need some ""Todd"" time for a bit ..."
"Indeed this is another Sam Adams brew (along with the Scotch Ale) that is immensely missed, IMHO. I thoroughly enjoyed the robust body, coffee-like bitterness of this porter along with the subtle honey sweetness."
