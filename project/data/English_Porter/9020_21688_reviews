"O - The sourdough rye flavors in this brew diminished from what I like in a roasty porter. A decent brew but not in the same league as a Founders Porter."

"Fortunately for me, this was my first step outside of the standard domestic beers. As the bottle says, you're hit with a wonderfully rich flavor of chocolate (which was a bit of a shock to me) that is followed by a creamy body. It is ended with a slight bright of rye which continues to put a smile on my face with every sip. I hope to edit this as my palate evolves so that I may do this wonderful find in a sea of selections the justice I am sure it deserves. I can say that I am so impressed that a weekend sabbatical to the brewery in Nashville has been scheduled!"

"Overall very nice porter, favorable easy drinking and enjoyable. Only knock really is the lack of any good head."

"O - Really solid porter - I enjoyed this one the most of the mixed Yazoo sixer I received from a friend in Nashville."

"O - This beer fits right in with the Sam Smith's beers. This is a great English porter. It is loaded with aroma and flavor. This beer exceeded all expectations."
"O: A solid porter. Great with a chocolate chip cookie. Nice dessert beer."
""

"M - Light to medium body. Moderate carbonation."

"I think that Yazoo does a great job of making solid beers that most people would approve of. But I think that drinkability is too important for them in most of their core beers. I would love to see them just crank it to 11 and see what happens...I know they want to."
"overall: great balanced porter, but wish it had a higher ABV and it would be a truly outstanding beer, just a little too watered down for my liking. You can thank tennessee beer laws for that one. I'd rather have YAZOO's SUE anyday, even though that's not a porter."

"Not too bad. I like it better as it warms up. Pretty dismal appearance though."

"***nice feel, good balance, medium body, good drinkability. A nice rye porter."

"Overall, this beer was great. It was unlike any other porter I've had before because it seemed much more dark fruit forward than roasted. It was semi-sweet, but no where near too sweet. I'm glad I tried this while in Nashville."
"A very dark brown in color with a creamy tan head. Aromas of light cocoa. Taste begins with a bit of coffee, and some chocolate. Next was some sweet grain, and a hint of hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is good. Overall a quite good porter! The spiciness of he rye works well here."

"A buddy brought a variety pack back from a trip to Nashville. The beer pours a nice color which was slightly less dark than Guinness, with a tan head. The rye was indeed sly - the beer wasn't as astringent as I had anticipated. While not as bitter as I would expect from a porter, I found it quite drinkable, and wouldn't hesitate to purchase it if I found it in my part of the country."
"Reminds me of a Guiness Extra Stout. No real flaws but not what I look for in a Porter."
""
"To be honest, I expected a little more out of the taste. Has a burnt roast feel to it with a somewhat flat finish, even for a Porter. The rye does shine through which is it's one lone saving grace."
""
""

"A pretty good tasting beer, I could use a few of these on a chilly autumn night."
""
"Overall, I liked it as a session beer. Was somewhat let down because the Yazoo Sue is an incredibly rich smoked porter, very bold with lots of body and flavor. I was hoping this would be similar but it was toned down. Still, I liked it, there aren't too many porters widely available in the middle of Tennessee, will drink it again."

"Overall I enjoy the Sly Rye Porter and would not hesitate to pick it up again, but it isn't incredible. I've had a couple other Rye porters that I prefer, but they are almost impossible for me to get."
"Bottle: Poured a dark black color porter with a dark foamy head with good retention and some light lacing. Aroma consists of spicy rye notes with light roasted malt and some black chocolate notes. Taste is also dominated by spicy rye notes with some dry roasted m alt notes with light black chocolate notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Well brewed with rye contributing some interesting complexity."
"The mouthfeel is creamy and slick with moderate carbonation. Great mouthfeel for the style. Overall it was a very flavorful and drinkable beer. I really liked the little bit of rye flavor in it. Very solid beer all around, especially for the style."

"O- I have had rye IPAs and rye stouts, but this was the first rye porter I have tasted. This sets a pretty good standard, IMO. I hope I can score some more in the future."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a 1/2 inch fizzy khaki head that fades to nothing. Small streaks and dots of lace drip back down into the remaining beer leaving no lacing. Smell is of roasted malt, roasted nuts, and rye aromas. Taste is of roasted malt and roasted nuts, rye, and some slight coffee flavors. A mild roasty aftertaste lingers on the tongue with each sip. This beer has a higher level of carbonation for a porter with a crisp and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good porter with some nice roasty and rye aromas and flavors."

"Porter pours an opaque black with a small head that dissipates quickly. Wow is this dark. Very nice aroma of cocoa, licorice and spicy rye. Flavor is light chocolatey goodness with a small amount of roasted malt. Mouthfeel is quite thin but this makes it drinkable. Overall effect is that I would have this again but it is not on my shopping list anytime soon. Maybe it's not my favorite style but I encourage porter lovers to give it a shot."
"I enjoyed this a lot... Bought 2 and I'm trading one as an extra... Tempted to drink it though..."
"Overall: This is a very nice brew. Good enough to be a desert treat, yet light enough to be an anytime of the day beer as well."
"Overall, this porter is interesting, carrying some unique flavors for the style. It is drinkable, and works well across the palate. A bit too spritzy on the tongue, taking away from what could be a very creamy mouthfeel. But, on the whole, this porter works well."
"O- I really like this beer, and I think it both one of the better beers that Yazoo does, and one of the better porters available in the Nashville market. It's a shame that bottles are only sold as part of the Yazoo mixed 12 pack. I would certainly drink more of this if that were not the case."
"On tap from the brewery in a sampler. A chocolaty, cloudy brown with a medium tan head and nice lace. The smell was of chocolate, banana, clove, spice, pepper, and a hint of roast. The taste followed the nose. A chocolate covered banana with spicy elements throughout. Spicy rye, black pepper, banana, cloves and chocolate with hints of coffee and roasted qualities. A complex but light beer. a bit thin for a porter. On the watery side with a bit of creaminess in the swallow. Overall an enjoyable beer. Easy to drink."
"Flavor is very similar, malt driven and spicy with the rye component, blending seamlessly with the creamy milk chocolate of the porter side of things. Medium bodied, slightly dense from the malt content, easily sipped or quaffed. Interesting balance of rye and chocolate malt here, more sweet than bitter, but not overly so. Definitely worth a try, it's a different animal than Sue."
"O- Very good beer from Yazoo. If you like porters you have to give this a try. Highly recomended."
"Excellent beer. One of the better porters I've had in a while, & packing this much flavor into a brew under 6% ABV is always to be applauded. Very nice."
"Mouthfeel is a little thin. This makes for a good session beer because it tastes great. I will probably be a regular in the beer store getting growlers of this. Also want to mention that I made a great barbecue sauce with this beer. Was actually looking for Sue but they didn't have it, so I settled for this. Was a good choice IMO."
"D: Could and have drank a few of these in one sitting. This is one of my favorite Yazoo offerings."
"D: This porter is incredibly drinkable, sweet and dark without any harsh bitter flavors. I love the rye."
"D - This is a really good, easy drinking, flavorful porter. The dark fruits and rye add a nice change of pace for the style, helping this stand out from others in this class. Thanks to beerindex for this one!"
"Smooth and creamy mouthfeel. This beer is well done. One of the best offerings I've had from Yazoo."
"D- A solid porter. An attempt at including rye is appreciated and more or less well executed. A few tweaks and this could be great beer."
"A very good porter, and I'm not sure I've ever had one with rye. A good stand up beer, well made, well rounded, and definitely worth a six-pack at least. Recommended."
"Think I would pass on this if there was a next time to try it"
"D- This beer drinks easy and smooth for the most part. The watery at times mouthfeel makes this a good drinkability beer meaning you can have a ton of this. ABV is low so drinking a lot wouldn't be a problem as well. Overall a above average beer but not by much."
"A good beer, and one that I'm happy to pick up when I get the chance. Linus sure knows what he's doing."
"Beer is thin at leadoff and finishes really weak. There is a minimal sweetness, almost nothing in the midpalate and some rye and roast at the end that disappears quickly. Not a very good beer."
"Drinkability is very good. I could see having several of these in a row. A solid porter overall."
"Overall a highly complex porter without any smugness or fakeness. This baby screams Northern Michigan, even though it's brewed in Nashville. I really like how balanced and still 'offset' this ale is. Good job Nashville!"
"Overall, it is an alright porter. The nose was the most enjoyable part of the beer. The taste just wasn't there. Fairly average."
"Still, a nice beer. Could be a great autumn grilling out football beer."
"A decent porter. Would go well with smoked barbecue. A nice beer for a fall night with a nice meal. Worth trying it if your looking for a bit of a change from other porters."
"HV"
"D: Pretty good. Not the best of the Yazoo brews I have had (SUE rocks!) but it is tasty no doubt."
"Nice, smooth fuller body with this one. Enjoyable and easy drinking. This would make a nice autumn beer for the cooler nights out on the deck. Thanks, Jim!"
"Eventually goes completely flat, the first half of the glass was much more enjoyable than the second which I ended up pouring down the drain. Second one of these and both the same way. Even at its best, I see this more as a Brown Ale or even a Scotch Ale, but pretty weak for a Porter, and a below average beer regardless of style."
"Overall, a decent beer from Yazoo. Nothing overly exciting, but still a fairly drinkable porter. Easy to enjoy a pint or two."
"This may be my favorite Yazoo brew to date. I'm not good enough yet to pick out the rye's role, but I like it more than others with rye that I've tried."
"Nicely drinkable, could easily make a night of this one, some black bread, and a healthy serving of Schnitzel and potatoes."
"I think this is one of the better beers producted by Yazoo"
"Very good brew, solid body to pair with the solid brew. Looking forward to more Yazoo brews in the area."
"This one toes the line between porter and stout. The mouthfeel is medium, and drinkability is great. I have to be honest that I didn't go in to this one with much expectation after reading some of the reviews, but I really did enjoy it."
"Had this on draft at Findley's, in Opryland. Color was slightly less dark than Guinness, with a tan head. The rye was indeed sly - the beer wasn't as astringent as I had anticipated. While not as bitter as I would expect from a porter, I found it quite drinkable, and wouldn't hesitate to purchase it if I found it in my part of the country."
"A deep red/garnet color with a light tan head. A little sweeter than expected for a porter and a little more medium bodied than anticipated. This is one of their best. Trying my best to support the local Brewery, even though for a while I could only find it at their tasting room."
"M/D - Medium to full bodied with a somewhat dry, yet still creamy feel. Carbonation just high enough to provide life to the feel. Very easy drinking."
"Found the beer at Flying Saucer, Nashville. Looking for something with more character, but not quite a Stout. The beer opens with a heavily roasted, lightly chocolate blend, with some Brown Ale sweetness and a hint of cereal grains. The beer tastes more like a Stout with high chocolate notes than it does a Porter. A robust rye character takes charge as the sweetness subsides, leaving a pumpernickle spice, bread, pungent character behind. The body is certainly on the porter side, showing a deleicate smooth, velvety texture, aside from the roasted grain textures. Finishes with a nice blend of chocolate, coffee, and rye. All in all, the rye character was light and at times, hardly noticable."
"D = This went down very easily but overall wasn't as good as I hoped. It's obviously better than most macros but not my choice in craft beers. I much prefer yazoo's stout."
"Drinkability: Lacks body - needs more malt; I was looking forward to tasting this as I was intrigued by the rye (having enjoyed other rye beers - particularly the Terrapin Rye Pale Ale) but was disappointed by the beer's flaws"
"I'll quite possibly try it again, at a different location if possible, for fairness' sake."
"Had this one on tap in Nashville. Pours a moderate brown color with lots of light around the edges and a nice head. Leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is very malty with some presence of rye and chocolate. The flavor is very odd, but good. Rye is evident as well as a good malt character with some chocolate and a hint of coffee. Has an odd flavor, but very enjoyable."
