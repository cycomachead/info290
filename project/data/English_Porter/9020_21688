As the bottle says, you're hit with a wonderfully rich flavor of chocolate (which was a bit of a shock to me) that is followed by a creamy body. It is ended with a slight bright of rye which continues to put a smile on my face with every sip. I hope to edit this as my palate evolves so that I may do this wonderful find in a sea of selections the justice I am sure it deserves. I can say that I am so impressed that a weekend sabbatical to the brewery in Nashville has been scheduled!","BaalDagon","Jul 09, 2014"

The smell was of chocolate, banana, clove, spice, pepper, and a hint of roast. The taste followed the nose. A chocolate covered banana with spicy elements throughout. Spicy rye, black pepper, banana, cloves and chocolate with hints of coffee and roasted qualities. A complex but light beer. a bit thin for a porter. On the watery side with a bit of creaminess in the swallow. Overall an enjoyable beer. Easy to drink.","JayS2629","Jun 02, 2011"
3.8,-0.3,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Flavor is very similar, malt driven and spicy with the rye component, blending seamlessly with the creamy milk chocolate of the porter side of things. Medium bodied, slightly dense from the malt content, easily sipped or quaffed. Interesting balance of rye and chocolate malt here, more sweet than bitter, but not overly so. Definitely worth a try, it's a different animal than Sue.","emerge077","May 27, 2011"

3.94,3.4,3,4,4.5,3,3.5,"Mouthfeel is a little thin. This makes for a good session beer because it tastes great. I will probably be a regular in the beer store getting growlers of this. Also want to mention that I made a great barbecue sauce with this beer. Was actually looking for Sue but they didn't have it, so I settled for this. Was a good choice IMO.","dmbsteve","Feb 01, 2011"

3.72,-2.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D - This is a really good, easy drinking, flavorful porter. The dark fruits and rye add a nice change of pace for the style, helping this stand out from others in this class. Thanks to beerindex for this one!","birchstick","Jan 12, 2011"

4.22,10.8,4,4.5,4,4,4.5,"A very good porter, and I'm not sure I've ever had one with rye. A good stand up beer, well made, well rounded, and definitely worth a six-pack at least. Recommended.","BeerSox","Jan 07, 2011"

3.52,-7.6,3,3.5,3.5,3,4,"D- This beer drinks easy and smooth for the most part. The watery at times mouthfeel makes this a good drinkability beer meaning you can have a ton of this.

4.07,6.8,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Overall a highly complex porter without any smugness or fakeness. This baby screams Northern Michigan, even though it's brewed in Nashville. I really like how balanced and still 'offset' this ale is. Good job Nashville!","malty","Sep 19, 2010"

2.21,-42,1,2.5,2.5,1.5,2,"Eventually goes completely flat, the first half of the glass was much more enjoyable than the second which I ended up pouring down the drain. Second one of these and both the same way. Even at its best, I see this more as a Brown Ale or even a Scotch Ale, but pretty weak for a Porter, and a below average beer regardless of style.","elgiacomo","Jun 15, 2010"

4.08,7.1,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This one toes the line between porter and stout. The mouthfeel is medium, and drinkability is great. I have to be honest that I didn't go in to this one with much expectation after reading some of the reviews, but I really did enjoy it.","daythree16","Oct 18, 2008"
4.13,8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Had this on draft at Findley's, in Opryland. Color was slightly less dark than Guinness, with a tan head. The rye was indeed sly - the beer wasn't as astringent as I had anticipated. While not as bitter as I would expect from a porter, I found it quite drinkable, and wouldn't hesitate to purchase it if I found it in my part of the country.","HoppyInfidel","Mar 29, 2008"
3.78,-0.8,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"A deep red/garnet color with a light tan head. A little sweeter than expected for a porter and a little more medium bodied than anticipated. This is one of their best. Trying my best to support the local Brewery, even though for a while I could only find it at their tasting room.","Likeburning","Oct 08, 2007"
4.13,8.4,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"M/D - Medium to full bodied with a somewhat dry, yet still creamy feel. Carbonation just high enough to provide life to the feel. Very easy drinking.","ckeegan04","Mar 03, 2006"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"Found the beer at Flying Saucer, Nashville. Looking for something with more character, but not quite a Stout. The beer opens with a heavily roasted, lightly chocolate blend, with some Brown Ale sweetness and a hint of cereal grains. The beer tastes more like a Stout with high chocolate notes than it does a Porter. A robust rye character takes charge as the sweetness subsides, leaving a pumpernickle spice, bread, pungent character behind. The body is certainly on the porter side, showing a deleicate smooth, velvety texture, aside from the roasted grain textures. Finishes with a nice blend of chocolate, coffee, and rye. All in all, the rye character was light and at times, hardly noticable.","BEERchitect","Nov 29, 2005"

3.23,-15.2,3.5,3,3.5,3,3,"Drinkability: Lacks body - needs more malt; I was looking forward to tasting this as I was intrigued by the rye (having enjoyed other rye beers - particularly the Terrapin Rye Pale Ale) but was disappointed by the beer's flaws","brentk56","Jan 24, 2005"

3.9,2.4,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Had this one on tap in Nashville. Pours a moderate brown color with lots of light around the edges and a nice head. Leaves some lacing on the glass. The aroma is very malty with some presence of rye and chocolate. The flavor is very odd, but good. Rye is evident as well as a good malt character with some chocolate and a hint of coffee. Has an odd flavor, but very enjoyable.","clvand0","0"
