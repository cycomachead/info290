I do notpickup a lot of coffee in the smell, more of the roasted malt.  The taste however is where I was blown away.  The coffee was present, but did not dominate.  At first, I tasted a nice burnt caramel that blended into a malty seetness.  Towards the end of the glass, I noticed a nice biscuity/toasty flavor.  I was very impressed with this beer, and will pick it up again.","gibgink","Dec 28, 2014"

Pours fairly crystal clear reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark roasted coffee, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, roasted malt, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, and roast/toasty earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of coffee, dark/roasted malt, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of roasted coffee, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, and roast/toasty earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, chocolate, cocoa, roast, caramel, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of coffee and dark/roasted malt flavors; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and slightly chalky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice coffee porter. Good balance and complexity of coffee and dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Apr 28, 2014"

The half bottle shape, and the reserved label works for m e. On to the porter... one thing I hate is when beers claim to have some flavor (like a "coconut porter" or a "basil honey ipa") and when you go to drink it, the flavor is either hiding or unrecognizable. Some people may be more for subtlety, but screw that. When I read "Coffee Porter", I want it to taste like the inside of a Civet's colon... and does it ever. It starts off with just an aroma, that familiar porter and stout smell that leaves traces of coffee in your nose. But the taste, oh man, the taste. It starts out with some dark roasted malts of your average porter, but then brewing up like a percolator comes delicious, aromatic, intense espresso flavor with just enough creamyness to keep the coffee bitterness under control. The flavor persists long after you swallow allowing you to savor the flavor. This is a really great beer for anyone who loves coffe.","Samuel906","Jul 22, 2013"

When your coffee note is this good though, you can be one-note. The mouthfeel is on the light side, but that works with how actual coffee feels too. The drinkability is great.

4.12,9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Pours a dark mahogany brown. Quite clear. Small tan head. Nice colors but the head dissipates fairly quickly. Coffee is very well integrated into the aroma. It's more complex and holds greater subtlety than most coffee porters. The coffee is fruity and fresh with very little roast. The malt flavors are rich and soft. Dough, toffee, caramel, molasses, walnut, chocolate. Lots of flavor in the taste as well. It's sweet without going overboard. Nice coffee twang and light mineral hops in the finish. Toasty malt sweetness throughout. Mouthfeel is creamy and full, though could probably be a bit more in that direction in a perfect world. All in all, this is a very good beer. I think Meantime is oddly underrated by beer geeks. They're still on the pricey side, though many brewers have caught up. Still, they make high quality British beers and actually translate them well to bottles that are pretty easy to find in the US. Coffee porters/stouts aren't really my favorite, but this is a winner and I'd definitely put it in the lineup for any tasting of the substyle.","popery","Sep 24, 2012"

Aroma is mostly dark roasted coffee, leather, and tobacco, slightly ashy? Malt has roasty and chocolate characteristics at first, then the coffee takes over and brings with it the leathery/tobacco undertones. Finish is crisp, slightly bitter like a black cup of joe. Lingering cofee bitterness that's slightly smokey. Medium,silky body, maybe a tad overcarbed. This one improved a LOT as it warmed; the off-putting smokiness gave way to more enjoyable complex flavours from the coffee beans.

Mouthfeel is thinner than expected, well carbonated, a bit hollow, super chalky and parched aftertaste. A caffeine zip sets in midway.

Not an easy drinker due too the extreme overall bitterness of this brew. A wake-up and smell the coffee Porter it is.","scottoale","Nov 24, 2008"

I think the addition of coffee beans has hugely compromised the beer base that presumably is meant to be a Porter(?), as the sweet edge comes a bit overpowering and the coffee aroma too seductive for the more traditional (read "understated") winey/prune-ish sourness of a Porter to come through. If, however, forgetting about the name altogether, this is a successful coffee beer that comes with reasonable complexity, a good body of coffee-malts and a decent depth of roastiness and hop bitterness in the end to satisfy various preferences.

There just wasn't room for much else. Coffee and roast were prominent in the flavour, but caramel sweetness cut through from start to finish. Bitterness was moderate and lasted through the end and the coffee flavour rounded out the finish. The body was a little on the thin side, but still worked.

It was a bit thin and light in color. Lots of carbonation, but the smell was kickin' some serious coffee with hints of nut and chocolate. I enjoyed drinking this brew, but did hope for something more. It drinks lighter than my preferred porters like Flag and Black Butte; frankly it drank more like a doppelbock plus the bionic coffee. I just can't get over the smells from this nice beer. It's sooo very nice and deep. The pour was decent, but not much head to it. It poured with about 1 finger which died off within a few minutes and didn't leave much lace at all. This beer would have been better for me if it was just thicker and if it had a bit richer mouth feel to it. It drank with a bit more alcohol on the toungue than I expected from a 6% porter.

The nose brings a rich, fresh roasted coffee aroma with some dark licorice, dried cherries, dry chocolate, and subtle smoky notes. The flavor is a very deep dark roasted nature full or rich black coffee beans. The mouthful is full bodied and slightly oily and leaves a smoky dark roasted malt lacing on the tongue. There is a nice acrid minerality to the palate as well. There is some nice dry earthy hop bittering and campfire charred woodiness. The finish, while short, is full roasted, dark, and gently fades leaving a nice grainy coffee residual coating of black coffee grinds behind. Overall a solid good british style coffee porter with the richness and dark roasted nature you would come to expect from this style. A nice coffee grind fade leaves a gentle reminder of the full roasted heartiness of this drink leaving you wanting more to wash it down.","beerthulhu","Jan 18, 2008"

4.54,20.1,3.5,4.5,5,4.5,4,"11.2 fl oz brown bottle from Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a dark reddish-brown with ruby-red highlights and a half inch of tan head that dissipates rather quickly leaving virtually no lacing. Smells strongly of dark chocolate with heavy chocolate notes. Tastes like dark chocolate overwhelmingly, with coffee playing a strong role too. Chocolate dominates the finish. Slight hop bitterness and astringency are noticeable toward the finish too. Unexpectedly rich full body with just enough carbonation to keep this one drinkable. One sip definitely invites another, and this one goes quickly. Phenomenal. A very solid full flavored full-bodied porter with no noticeable flaws, and well worth the price.","MrHurmateeowish","Jan 05, 2008"

I also smell a hint of Ringwood like yeast but that may be just be seeping out of my pores. The flavor is dry and roasty, with any sweetness from the malt is covered by an astringent coffee flavor. The coffee is more prevelent in the aftertaste, but overall I'm not sure it adds too much to the beer. It's kind of a stale coffee flavor.","ericj551","Dec 22, 2007"

The aroma is intensely aromatic coffees, ground, roasted, almost charred, black patent malts have to be in there, a tad nutty. The taste is even more dominated by the bean, almost a mean streak, a bite accompanying a rise in carbonation through the middle, then settling into softer coffee and nutty tones, and the tongue is left prickling from the carbonation. The body is relatively full, particularly after warming. Overall, I'd say this is a pretty decent beer, not my cup of... erm, tea?, but it'll do, a decent coffee porter.","objectivemonkey","Sep 05, 2007"

4.36,15.3,5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"This brew pours a dark brown color with ruby hues around the edges. The head is monsterous, especailly for a coffee beer. It is two inches high, creamy, fluffy, and recedes very slowly into chunky lacing. The aroma is of coffee grounds, nuts, sweet milk chocolate, bitter dark chocolate, and cream. The taste has quite a bit more coffee to it than the aroma. Chocolate and cream rounds out the coffee flavors in the sip, while the finish in pleasantly nutty. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with fine, lively carbonation. Overall, this beer is does not have as much coffee in it as most American coffee beers. However, adding more coffee to this beer would probably mask too many of its other flavors and aromas, and I think that would be a shame. I like this beer a lot. I would drink it if I was in the mood for something with a punch-you-in-the-mouth coffee taste to it.

It has a bold coffee taste up front, but it mellows out in the finish. It has a light chocolate sweetness that rounds out the flavor. It's still dry and earthy, but not over the top.

3.35,-11.4,4,4,3,3.5,3,"I bought his due to the fact that I enjoyed their IPA. This was in an odd, 11.2 oz bottle that was shaped more like the 750ml their other beers are available in. The label notes that one serving is equal to one cup of coffee so this should be interesting. The color was brown but light enough to see through if held to a light. The head is short and light tan in color. The smell is like ground coffee beans and malt. The taste is sweet like maple syrup and a little milky-lactose but oddly not much coffee flavor, just a hint of coffee bitterness in the background. The more this warms up, the more the coffee takes over. This one was just average to me. If porters or coffee beers are your thing then by all means try this one. If you dont usually seek out porters specifically you can skip this one.","ArrogantB","Jul 31, 2007"
3.92,3.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"11.2 oz bottle. My glass is filled with deep brown liquid with a finger of ivory to light tan head that falls to a full coat atop the beer. There is very little carbonation after the initial pour and clarity is excellent. The nose on this one screams coffee to me. Lots of iced-coffee tones with a solid roasted backbone behind it. The coffee dominates and obscures any other aromas that might be in there. The flavor is a nice balance. The initial flavor hits coffee..very full coffee. This fades after a long stay on my tongue to chocolate and roasted malt notes, with a mild bitterness that brings coffee back to mind. The flavors are good. There is definitely a dominant coffee but the base beer comes through towards the end. Mouthfeel is thick, with a light to moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is a little thick for the flavor in my opinion. Overall, this is a little skewed to the coffee, but that means truth in advertising. I would gladly have it again, as the slant in one direction doesn't bug me too much, as I love some nice robust coffee.","kmpitz2","Jul 28, 2007"

3.78,0,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"For the past couple of years, the only things we got from Meantime out here on the west coast were 750s of IPA and Porter. I've had those and been impressed, so I went for the Coffee Porter as soon as I found it. Besides, they have cool labels with a Victorian mechanical feel...über-hip. I'm not usually terribly thrilled with odd ingredients in beer, beyond the traditional four, but the porter-stout range of the style spectrum is fairly easily doctored to drinkable effect. There have been others out there to use coffee in the dark ale, (Speedway Stout from Alesmith leaps to mind -- excellent stuff) some more successful than others. Meantime's coffee beer is pretty well-paired with the coffee, but I find I prefer a more substantial body with richer malt character to offset the bitterness of the coffee. On the other hand, comparing this to Speedway for drinkability, I could go through a few of these and still function. Consumption of an equivalent quantity of Speedway may provide you with sufficient caffeine alertness for you to put your arms up before your face hits the floor. In the meantime, I'm going to keep an eye out for more Meantime products as they filter out to this coast.","ctdfalconer","Jul 07, 2007"

The beer finishes with a chalk-like cocoa powder note, some roast-derived bitterness and a touch of burnt acidity. There was a solid amount of coffee used in this brew, I wonder how much, if any, dark malts were used in this brew, because I could totally see this as getting all of its dark color and character from coffee. I suppose though that the chocolate aromatics and flavor are probably derived from roasted malt.
