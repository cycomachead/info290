Aroma is dark toasty-roasty malts with some lighter notes of pine. Taste is comprised of deeply roasted malts, baking chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. Not sure if it is the age of the beer, but unfortunately, this beer is heavily over carbonated, giving it a lighter body than it should have and thinning out the taste. Overall, I could see this beer having potential, but the carbonation is far too lively for this to be a world-class beer.","Florida9","Oct 01, 2014"

4.32,3.6,3.75,4.25,4.5,4.25,4.25,"The darkest brown, slightly opaque with a thin head that disappears into a spider web of bubbles on the top of the liquid after a few minutes. The smell is a bit nicer with a heavy dose of chocolate malt, a touch of roast malt and the balance caramels. Dark roasted coffee and bit of sweetness come through as well. The taste is also very good. As with any classic porter the chocolate malt flavor dominates. This is accentuated by coffees and roasty character. Bitterness is there as well but primarily from the malt with only low hop character present, typical of a good English version of the style. The mouthfeel is tight and a bit prickly due to some moderate to high levels of carbonation. The finish is pretty dry with just some of the roast lingering on the tongue. Overall this is a great example of the style, nothing overly challenging here just a solid porter, a style that is often overlooked or made with more hops. A good sessionable beer that you can drink all afternoon.","fank2788","May 31, 2013"

The coffee is also very present in the taste, with low fruit esters and discrete hops. The malt gives the idea of bread and toast, slightly caramelized, with a medium-light body. The palate is very oily, and has low carbonation, with - guess - coffee in the aftertaste. Very pleasant session beer, for sure, although I expected more caramel expression in the malt.","HabiMendes","Apr 05, 2013"

Standard porter appearance- dark black with little opacity, tan head with little lacing. Medium mouthfeel, actually a little waterier than I expected. Tastes similar to smells- some coffee and chocolate in the background with a distinct roasted maltiness and hints of annis. Bitter smoky finish that doesn't linger. I enjoyed this one- a solid porter that goes down easily.","shangwang","Mar 25, 2011"

3.42,-18,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Poured a dark brown with an averaged sized frothy light brown head that was mostly lasting and had excellent lacing. The aroma was light of roasted caramel malts, a sort of barnyard scented yeast and strong notes of coffee and dark chocolate. It tasted slightly sweet and quite flavorful with notes of coffee and caramel at first and then a bitter sweet chocolate/coffee flavor engulfed the taste buds and stayed with you for a nice little while. Mouthfeel was medium to full in body and a little oily in texture with a nice soft carbonation. Overall a nice straight forward Porter.","KajII","Mar 10, 2011"

Slight leather with a hint of smoke as well. Slight bitterness lingers on. To me this is slightly bland upfront. Easy drinking though.","kbutler1","Nov 07, 2010"

I probably buy more of this than any other beer on the market. That's saying a lot, being that I'm a promiscuous drinker by nature. This is one one of the better porters out there, and very well crafted. It flies off the shelves here, so I always make it a point to grab some when I see it.","ryan1788a5","Nov 04, 2010"

I am getting a faint amount of roasted malt in the nose and a small bit of dark fruit, nothing special. The taste is fairly dry and watery. There is good balance for sure between hops and malt.

3.43,-17.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"12oz. bottle served at 51 degrees in my SA Sensory Pint. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured the color of cola with some deep red, almost brown highlights when backlit. Pour revealed a frothy/sudsy two inch, khaki-colored head that crackled and popped as it slowly receded into a fairly consistent quarter inch cap with thick swaths of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose off the bottle pop was coffee, roasty and perhaps a hint of smoked meat a la rauchbier. Nose in the glass is a bit more subdued - light coffee aromas and something else hard to tease out; maybe a hint of lactose and something else...Taste follows nose - smoky character definitely remains, but I also get a slightly metallic quality as well. Mouthfeel is medium-light with carbonation levels that approach prickly; however, this beer is also a bit gassy. Not a bad porter by any means, but a little too much CO2 happening here.

4.25,1.9,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Quite a treat, not just because it's very good but because it presents a number of unusual flavors. A very thick head, all-but-black color and aromas of toast, roast beef and celery, and even burning electrical wires (not bad, in my book). It has a dense body with moderate fizz that burns a bit on the tongue; there's much complexity in the taste but prominent flavors are roasted nuts, caramel, more celery, wet earth, sausages and perhaps roasted potatoes. Dry finish with a mild tilt of bitterness at the end. Not the greatest American porter I've had (that honor goes to Berkshire Brewing Co.), but unusual and excellent nonetheless.","gfreed","Sep 17, 2009"

Underneath the sweetness is a touch of gritty hops and light smoke, good stuff. Taste starts with roasted coffee beans and smoked malts. Midway a touch of dark chocolate and brown sugar balance out the tongue. Aftertaste is pretty dry with roasted grains slightly sweetened with a touch of vanilla. Soft light to medium body with a creamy feel and a prickly carbonation. Very drinkable, I'm starting to appreciate porters more and more, and this is just another stepping stone.

The taste is similar with maybe the barest hint of dark fruit at the end. Nicely balanced and the brambly fruit comes out a bit more as it warms. The tiniest bit thin in the mouth, but this also gets better as it warms with a bit of prickliness- just enough not to be unpleasant helping add some crispness to the porter. Quite solid, one that I would definitely drink were it local. Quite dry and fairly light and not as roasty as some, but very well balanced and with some nicely nuanced flavors.","Georgiabeer","Mar 22, 2009"

There are about two fingers of foamy beige head that takes an extended period of time to dissolve. It never really goes away. The aroma is smoked and of clean hops.

A slight floral hop hint with mild smoke lingering added to this extremely smooth and rich porter. Not too much alcohol tatse, and little carbonation definitely led to the stoutness of it.

Pours with a small creamy head, dark chocolate in color with strong roasted coffee aroma...ahh smells so nice. The aromas come from the Chocolate and Brown malts. Peated malt is in there for good measure. While the porter is hopped to balance the malts you'll struggle to find hop flavor, and that's a good thing for English Porters. If you're considering trying a porter or are an anti-hop fan I suggest giving Mayflower's Porter a try.","Acochran","Oct 26, 2008"

4.12,-1.2,3.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,"I couldn't help but compare this one to my own English Porter, this one definately won in the feel category. Nice carbonation not too much, it is English, but not to little, it plays on the tongue with smaller silky bubbles. As to the thinness, it also did great just enough body to keep the flavors bouyed up, English Porters can be watery if the brewer allows them to be.","currysage1","Jun 06, 2008"
4.3,3.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"D: You could session this, it is light enough with a small ABV (5%). Very tasty, one of my new favorite porters, and for me, easy to get right up the street!","blackheartbilly","May 24, 2008"
4.07,-2.4,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Growler purchased straight from the brewery in Plymouth. Poured in to an English pint glass a dark brown, with rosy hues at the bottom and sides of the glass. Smell is of milk chocolate, fresh buttery cream, and a roasted note. Taste is smooth as silk on the palate, with more of the milk chocolate taste, and a faint roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is light, with the malt coming through most, but a nice kiss of hops in there also. Drinkability is the high point on this beer, as it makes for a complex session brew. This ranks as one of the better porters I have sampled in recent memory. A trip to the brewery is more than worth it, as this and all their other brews taste great. Or if you are patient enough, you can wait for them to bottle, and distribute to your area. From what I heard, bottling started this week. Cheers to this new brewery.","jamie2dope","May 08, 2008"
4.55,9.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"I must say this was a pretty exceptional beverage. Appearance was dark black with a light, coffee-color head with eventual lacing. The best way to describe the smell was a definite ""icy", smoked feel wrapping around the strong mocha flavors. There was even a hint of vanilla I sensed. It was wicked sweet for my tastes with a soft, bitter aftertaste. Definitely strong on the mocha, coffee flavors. The mouthfeel, I felt, was a key to the success of the drink. A good solid body but wonderfully light and thin essentially. Allowed it to be enjoyed the whole night. Overall, an excellent porter.","fitzy84","Apr 19, 2008"
4.15,-0.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Surprisingly, this porter goes down easy and light. My mouth wanted more after my first sip, and I feel I could have obliged it a few more pints quite easily.","drinksandeats","Mar 30, 2008"
4.3,3.1,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Had on tap at Union Brewhouse. Excited to try it from a local brewery and one of my fave styles! Good looking beer- blackish brown with nice tan one finger head. Aromas of roasted malts, some chocolate, coffee. First sip has a wonderful smokey flavor. Then gets balanced out with the malty flavors (chocolate being most obvious) Medium to full body so it is pretty hearty for a porter, and a bit richer and smooter, also. Still very drinkable. Had about 3 the first time, and keep going back for more!","DrDogbeer","Mar 28, 2008"
