4.64,16,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.75,4.75,"I have tasted porters often and would like to like them but seldom do. This porter however is one of the absolute best I've ever tasted hands down. Had it fairly recently for the first time at the Meantime pub / brewery in Greenwich, London, UK on draft and I was totally blown away. More recently found a 750 ml bottle at a local favorite supplier in Durham, NC. Today, I cracked the cork and noted a little bit of a pop but not much. Aroma was outstanding and definitely reminded me of my original draft tasting at the brewery. I poured it into my Meantime pint glass from the original tasting, it was wonderful. On a full steady pour, color was dark brown chocolate with lighter brown 1"" head. Foam was very tasty and subsided over a reasonable time. Overall taste and experience in drinking this porter as a draft and bottled product is awesome. When the mood strikes for a porter, I'm looking for this fine offering from Meantime on draft in London or in the 750 ml bottle here in the USA. Happy to finally have a go to porter!","napetry","Beers"

Aromas of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, nuttiness, roasted malt, toffee, coffee, toast, and light herbal hops. Very nice and pleasant aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of chocolate, roast malt, caramel, nuttiness, toast, biscuit, coffee, toffee, earth, and herbal hops. Moderate herbal and roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toast, coffee, nuttiness, biscuit, and earth on the finish for a short bit. Great flavor balance and robustness, with good complexity and no cloying flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is well hidden as expected of 6.5%, with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent porter! Great robust roasted flavors with nice complexity and balance; and very smooth to drink. Highly enjoyable porter, an easy winner in my books.","superspak","Jun 08, 2012"

Definitely better when warmed up, but still pretty good when cold and first poured. My only comment which makes me wonder about this beer is that on the label it says ""bottle conditioned"" but there is no sediment at all in this beer, and, the beer is too clear when held up to the light - so where did the bottle conditioning yeast go? Or do they mean something else by bottle conditioned here? Regardless of this minor mystery, a very good porter and something I could easily pick up again despite the price. I must find a way to have it directly from a cask should I ever get the chance.","damndirtyape","Jan 22, 2012"

Poured into a tulip glass a dark, murky reddish tinged brown color with a big fluffy tan head that leaves lace as it settles. Dark fruit, roast coffee, sherry, and slight leather in the nose. Med/light mouthfeel that due to the carbonation leans toward the light side for me. Light roast coffee flavors gives way to some dark fruit sweetness and then ends with a slight bitterness. Some alcohol faintly noticeable in the taste.

Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like smoked and roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and a bit of caramel and dark fruit. Starts off sweet, then has a bitter and dry finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth and very easy to drink. If I had another bottle of it, I'd drink it now!

A little fruit and chocolate break up the smoke before the finish. Some alcohol warmth is noted. The body is medium with a nice soft, creamy texture.

It produced a nice a dark tan 2 finger head that was compact. The head seemed to linger for the right amount of time. It also produced a nice deep roasted malt aroma that had a hint of smokiness to it. Also hints of molasses, some alcohol as it warmed and I think I also got a little coffee or chocolate. Could have been a little more pronounced. The taste was exceptional. Huge deep roasted malt, with very subtle hints of the alcohol, a very lite touch of sweetness and as I neared the end I got some coffee or chocolate. I could not really distinguish (maybe if I had bought more than one bottle...to be updated). The beer had a medium body, I thought that it would have felt thicker, but it was very smooth, very creamy and solid like a good porter should be. The beer was very drinkable and I could have drank more if I had bought more than one bottle. If you are a fan of beer, you need to try this one. This will become a staple in my house.","PhillyStyle","Sep 20, 2008"

Coffee, molasses, booze in the taste. Taste is a little sour. The mouthfeel is what really takes away from this historic brew recipe when grading it by modern standards. It's thin body decreases the overall flavor and cannot sufficiently conceal the abv. It tastes like a high abv brown ale. Overall, this is a unique porter to drink, certainly enjoyable and fun to picture all the crazy 18th century sailors and pirates guzzling this stuff.","itcomesnpints","Sep 07, 2008"

It started off biscuity and malty, becoming fruity and roasted in the middle. Finished with some chocolate. Pretty good.

It had an average sized beige head that settled into a thin collar. A little lacing and carb. The aroma was roasted malts, some chocolate and smoke. The taste was good with a nice smoky feel with coffee and chocolate tones. Good mouthfeel. Overall, this is a really good porter. I enjoyed the smoky twist and could see a bottle going down every few months. Highly recommend. (4, RR, T, Y)","TexIndy","Nov 04, 2007"

Nose has a nice toasted grain aroma, sweet with hints of toffee and bittersweet chocolate, quite pleasing to the nose and eyes. Start is pleasantly malty, sweet with just a hint of hops, top is light to moderate on the palate.

4.23,5.8,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Pours out a ruby tinged cherry finished wood with a creamy, khaki head which leaves little bits of lace. Smell has notes of dried, dark fruits, fresh berries, chocolate, cane syrup, and coffee. I can pick up a touch of smokiness. Flavor is very full and rich with more fresh fruitiness coming out over the dried ones, but I still surely pick up some raisin and dried fig. Nice mix of breadiness with the sweetness reminds me of biscuits and cane syrup. A touch of cherry presses on through the middle along with some big chocolate. Finishes with roastiness of coffee. Aftertaste lingers on and on with big emphasis on cane syrup, preserved figs, and coffee (all this reminiscent of breakfast). Light twang in the finish as well, to mention. Mouthfeel is moderate in weight, has a gentle carbonation, but can be just a bit sticky. Drinkability is fine, but the sweetness could hold me back. Delicious beer, but I don't know if I'd pay this much for it again.","goochpunch","Sep 21, 2007"

The taste is nearly ALL malt with little or no hops up front and only a slight hop bitterness towards the end. Quite lovely. Especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is very, very smooth and creamy.
