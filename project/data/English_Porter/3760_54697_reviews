"My second stop on a flavoured porter tour. Mill Street has got the nitro can thing down - this pours, looks, and feels like a Guinness. It looks great, smells like vanilla extract, and has a robust roasted malt backbone. The aroma is a bit too sweet for my liking, but it manages to complement the porter in an odd way. The mouthfeel is  delightful, but the overall experience is a bit off."
"Unlike some others who still liked it, I could personally drink a lot of these at once (but I'm just not that kind of drinker usually)"

"On a side note, I wish that this beer had some banana flavours. At first, I thought that the flower on the can was a banana, but on second glance I realized that I was wrong.  I drank this porter wearing pyjamas, so I would have loved to have bananas in pyjamas. My dream was crushed upon drinking this brew. I did not take into account my fantasy in my review and rating of this brew."
"If you're just getting into stouts/porters and want to experience some of the various flavours to try, I recommend the vanilla porter. Great introduction to the vanilla flavour you can get in this beer type."
"Waited to review this until I had it a second time. Won't be having it a third."

"A sweet desert beer, more subtle and balanced than other vanilla porters I've tried."
"O: [4.25] I have had Mill Streets Cobblestone Irish Stout.  This tastes very similar but with a nice infusion of vanilla.  This would go really well with desserts - and maybe even with ice cream right in it.  The body is so smooth and the beer goes down really easily.  Other than a synthetic smell on the nose this beer hits on all cylinders.  I really like it as a approachable low abv beer."

"I was expecting more carbonation, this beer seems to be a little flat for me.  I am comparing it to of course one of my favorite drinks, vanilla coke, and so I was a little disappointed.  I would not order another one of these, but it does the trick for the time being and I have had alot worst.  It has a nice head to it, and pours smoothe.  You can down it pretty easily but it doesn't really have a nice smell ( a little overwhelming.)  In my opinion the BA score was a little high but I guess they have their reasons."
"Taste follows nose closely. However it feels and tastes light and more watery than I expected and had hoped."
"I found the vanilla heavy handed and the sweetness over the top.  Definitely not a beer I would revisit."
"A desert beer, omg this is good"

"Coined a great desert beer!"
"tastes ok like the coffee porter not keen on the device they put in bottom of can made the can basicly explode when opened lost half a beer"
""
"O - Decent dessert beer. Maybe a bit light to be great on it's own but combines nicely with rich desserts."
""
""

"OVERALL: Hate to say it, but this pretty bad. The vanilla tastes very artificial and the overall flavor is a touch too sweet to really be enjoyable. Wasnâ€™t able to finish any more than half the can before I was forced to water the flowers a bit. This is unfortunate, as their Cobblestone Stout is so well done. Avoid this one in the future. Cheers again guys!"

"O: Excellent, get your hands on one.  Very smooth and flavourful, one of my new favourites from this company. Drank in Kunming, Sept 10 2014."

"Overall: this is a pretty tasty beer. I could see finishing a meal with one of these sweet pints."
""
"Very very smooth, rich, dark. Chocolaty notes. Mildly sweet. Creamy."

"This nice little porter paired well with... chocolate. The vanilla goes so well with Belgium chocolate. Yum!!!"
""

"Overall: pretty good. I'd buy this again."

"I think mill street is pretty established on the 'everymans craft beer' track and this fits with that mantra, too sweet initially while also trying to be sessionable and bitter, I did enjoy it though. The vanilla is especially pronounced in the aroma, the beer itself has a fairly muted porter profile, comparatively little roastiness IMO. It is all in all quite one dimensional with the vanilla, worth a try maybe, just dont expect too much."

"One sip and I was overwhelmed with a taste of chocolate and vanilla. Not much beer here. Extremely sweet and too thick. I couldn't stomach it. Tried to take another sip and had to call it quits. Definitely has a niche market but I doubt a go-to drink for any beer lover."

"Can: Poured a nice light black color porter with a huge creamy light brown head with great retention and some excellent lacing. Aroma of vanilla is quite dominating with some good notes of bitter roasted malt notes. Taste is also dominated by loads of vanilla extract which ends up being a bit too over the top with light dry roasted malt notes. Body is light but has a nice creamy texture courtesy of the can widget. Well brewed but vanilla extract notes becomes over the top at some point."
""

"Clear chestnut, a bit of a reddish hue, topped by dense tan foam. Good head retention, spotty lacing. Roasty aroma, slight vanilla, chocolate. Low bitterness, more chocolate and vanilla, light roast, brown sugar and cocoa. Medium bodied, low carbonation. Decent overall. I liked that the vanilla was more of an accent than an overpowering characteristic."
"Sampled on tap at a Calgary pub early on New Year's eve. It is a tad unfortunate that Mill St. has succumbed to the flavored porter craze but OK, let's keep an open mind. I do like vanilla. This brew arrived in a Mill St. pint glass, a dark cola brown hue with the creamy light tan head you'd expect from a nitro-tap. A very light orange halo creeps along the bottom of the glass. Aroma is aggressive floral/sweet vanilla extract along with some roasted notes like dark coffee, a little white grape fruitiness which is somewhat unusual for this style ... One expects the fruit aromas to be darker. Palate featured some roasted barley and a chocolate brownie effect probably from the dark malts and the vanilla combined, butterscotch baking chips, blonde roast coffee, and a lot of vanilla extract, to the point where this was the dominant flavor throughout. I suppose that's the point, but I prefer spice additions to complement other flavors and stay under the radar a lot more than this one does. Still, its not too bad. Has a little of the sour character that you get in top-tier English porters and some subtle medicinal notes, perhaps this is how the hops make their presence known? Thinnish body and fairly aggressive carbonation but very creamy and smooth, again this could be the dispensing method used here. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink a lot of this brew, but all in all my pretty low expectations were exceeded. If they toned down the vanilla we'd have a solid porter on our hands."

"Final Thoughts: All in all, as advertised. If you want Vanilla and a Porter combined this is your beer. It's well done, but it just doesn't quite break out to having that wow factor, landing it somewhere between good and great. Thumbs up."

"Pours out a very nice, deep dark brown, almost black, with a beautiful creamy off-white head. Strong vanilla notes on the nose, with hints also of coffee and chocolate. Taste is of a light, nicely balanced and smooth porter - vanilla notes appear halfway through a taste and fade slightly at the finish, giving way to lightly bittering hop qualities. Mouthfeel is light, airy and creamy, like a whipped topping. Very drinkable. Could use a little more malt to smooth out to the hoppier profile, but overall, quite well-executed."

"Taste starts sweet, vanilla in the middle, and bitterness and vanilla through the close. Did I mention the vanilla? A bit overpowering and artificial-seeming for the vanilla, but still okay. Mouthfeel is nitro smooth, and drinkability is good. Pretty good brew."

"A nice Porter from Mill Street. Lots of sweet flavors but not overly sweet. Vanilla is out front obviously, but not as much as I expected. Worth a try."
"From the mixed winter 6 pack. Pours big and thick but the mouthfeel is underwhelming. The Vanilla is actually not a big detriment to the beer but rather a part of the flavour. I wanted a richer beer and the lack of a real mouthfeel let me down. Not as good as the cobblestone stout but drinkable,"
"Final Grade: 3.5, a serviceable B. Mill Street's Vanilla Porter is delicious at first, but becomes increasingly less interesting as you make your way through the glass. That gob of vanilla and milk chocolate that hits you with the first sip is really all this beer has going for it - after that, it just feels flat, limp and uninteresting. A decent dessert beer that I'd consider getting again, but Cobblestone is the superior product by a comfortable margin - both in terms of quality and adherence to style, as anyone looking for a serious porter is likely to be disappointed with this one."
""
"not all that complex but drinkable, memorable? not so much"
"Overall- An English porter that uses pure vanilla extract in a way that it remains balanced with roasted malts without overpowering. Delicious flavour that can be sipped on all night long."
""
"That second can may well be served as a dessert beer, and I just might take LCBO Lady up on her serving suggestion and give it the deep freeze first."
""
""
""
"Overall - Tastes like I expected it to. Maybe a little thin and watery.. but a great scent. Not something I'd want to drink more than one can of, but a decent example of the style."
"I really love vanilla - favorite ice cream flavor and everything - but I'm afraid that the vanilla and caramel sweetness are rather overpowering here, and it doesn't quite come together for me as a porter. I'm glad I tried it and I wouldn't turn it down if offered but I doubt I would buy it more than once a year. Mind you it would be gorgeous for baking."
""
"Overall - Not a bad beer by any stretch of the imagination, but not one I'm overly impressed with. Expecting more vanilla, even though that was the focus of this one-dimensional beer, and definitely expecting more of a porter fullness than what was provided."

"Vanilla yes, porter definitely not. From the marketing around this pub it almost seems to me like they're afraid of putting people off with big-flavoured brews. I get that but this effort is just weak. No brewer should ever be afraid of making a proper dark beer. They can still be sweet, tasty and drinkable anyway."

"Definitely more vanilla than porter, if going strictly by the name, as the base dark beer attributes get passed over to a large degree. There are smoke and sour-ish essences, to be fair, but they provide more of a understated support role. Worth a try, but I'm not certain that my palate, and sweet tooth, could take another dose of this."
"Clear dark brown beer with a thick nitro induced light tan head, a hint lighter than I had expected. Decent nose dominated by vanilla and not much else. The body is thin with no roast notes evident and the only flavour in play is vanilla. This may have been served a little cold but even as it warmed, no real other flavours came out. One-dimensional to a fault."

"An enjoyable pint and I'll buy it again, but my socks remained firmly on."
"O/D - A very tasty vanilla porter. Very nice with strong flavours and very smooth. A pleasure."
"M - Medium body and creamy. Light carbonation."
"Drinkability- Will give this another chance if I encounter it, but if this beer was right, it's definitely a huge blunder by the usually reliable mill street."
"Vanilla is one of my favourite flavours for any sweet treat and I've yet to find a vanilla something or other that I can't at least tolerate with a smile. But I don't love it enough to overlook this beer's lack of maltiness and other flavours. Gimmicky or not, a porter requires more than just some artificial flavouring. Otherwise, it's not much of a porter at all."
"Had this on nitro-tap at C'est What. Pours a really dark brown colour with a finger of thick white head. Smells of vanilla and chocolate with some mild roast, almost like a milkshake. Very sweet, almost no bitterness. Mouthfeel is incredibly creamy. Easy to drink porter, but I wouldn't want to drink more than one of these in a row due to the sweetness."
"Mill Street is hit-or-miss for me; this one was a hit, but not something I can drink too much of. Even though the vanilla/chocolate flavor was mercifully subdued, the brew lacked a roasted porter character to combat the sweetness. Had there been more porter characteristics here, Mill Street Vanilla Porter would have been a first-rate brew. As it stands, it is still a good brew, and a tasty one to enjoy right before the holidays."
"On tap at Chancey Smith's. Deep coffee like pour with ruby hues at the edges of the glass. Has a frothy mocha cap. Nose of intense vanilla extract, roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate too, but the vanilla is powerful here. Tastes of sweet concentrated vanilla, some hoppy bitter roastiness, dark chocolate, a bit of mint. Wow, there is a lot of vanilla here. Finish is creamy, medium bodied, leaving a lengthy vanilla finish. Quite good, but one pint is enough thank you very much!"
"A deliciously drinkable beer upfront but slowly it grows on you and near the end you find it hard to finish. I think they added too much vanilla here, if there was less of that and more of the porter this would be almost perfect."
"MSVP does not have the features of a traditional porter (smoke, hops, lots of roast, medium/full body) but it's still a very tasty dark beer. Worth a try IMO, even if doesn't adhere to the style."
"It was a pleasant drink, but if you come across it do not expect anything like the porter style."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, creamy and smooth. I have no idea who decided this was a porter. Zero porter character from the appearance down to the taste. Vanilla is alright but seems a little fake. Not too bad as a beer but as a porter this is shameful."
