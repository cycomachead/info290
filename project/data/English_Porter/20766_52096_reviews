"an outstanding glass of porter here, looking dark as pavement from the tap, with a mocha cream head on top and a deep dark complexion that flashes milk chocolate brown to obsidian black. the nose and taste are in line with one another, loaded with coffee notes and bitter roasted barley. it could be called a stout and not be off, its got the body and the roast levels for it, but it maintains its drinkability with a very clean finish from a robust yeast strain and a minimal hop profile. i think its very authentic, but also very rich and perfect for the new england autumn, which is fast approaching. so smooth in mouthfeel, just puffy like a marshmallow on the palate, but loaded with the dark malt character. one of the better homegrown porters ive had this year, and a great first impression was made here on me by the greenport harbor folks. looks from their listing like they do some cool stuff too."
"Would recommend this to those who like a Guinness type stout but looking for a little more adventure."
"03/28/12 Solid flavors. Cold weather brew. Save it for last as it's not a quaffer."

"Found at The Beer Bar in Manhattan and served in a large chalice this porter has a solid black brown appearance with a respectable light chocolate colored thin layer of foam and excellent lacing. The aroma suggests a boozy chocolate malt with a hint of grassy hop. The flavor brings much more of a charcoal grass blend and very little chocolate. It seems to have an odd swampiness to it, a bit like stagnant water, that isn't wowing me but it generally overcomes this to provide an overall okay taste. The grassy hop slides into a sort of herbal idea in conjunction with the alligator water element. The booziness from the aroma also dissipates as you adjust to the flavor of this medium bodied brew with a midland, slightly resinous feel. As porters go I can't help but wish this had a bit more malt centric flavors and the tainted water thing does it no favors. If the off flavor is intended, then I'd have to say, don't waste your time. But if it was just a bad line or something, this might have potential. It may be an overhopped outcome but as one who worships hop indulgence, I have to doubt that. I'm going to assume something was a bit off in this first sample but it makes it hard to judge."

"Had a pint at Astoria Bier and Cheese on a Sunday afternoon. Overall, this was just a nice smooth, yet roasty porter. There was a mild, underlying creaminess that should come with an English porter. There's no hops presence, but the barley brings a great mix of light espresso, blackened toast, and touch of dry, dark chocolate. Order a pint if you find this on tap."
"A huge head as I pour from my 64 oz ( Best Yet Market in Harlem $9.99, what a deal!) Finally able to fill the glass and the settles to two plus fingers, Slow fade leave a light covering and decent lace here and there. Fluid is dark brown with garnet highlights. Almost opaque but some light does get through when it is bright enough. Smell has lots of roasted grains and some char/smoke. A very nice blend of molasses and a dark English style yeast fruitiness. A bit of dark chocolate infused espresso. Some earthy hops. Taste has a great blend of dark roasted flavors. Coffee, chocolate malt, cocoa nibs. A bit of molasses sweetened brown dinner rolls. Yeast esters give a fruity glue to the overall character. Hops are dry and earthy giving a clean finish that leaves a light note of fresh hop leafiness. Feel is medium weight with a crisp refreshing dryness. Carbonation is just on the lower side but still enough to make my mouth happy. A great session ale. I went through the growler as I cleaned up my yard preparing for hurricane Sandy, eating dinner and watching football. Refreshing, quenching, and satisfying. Yum."

"On cask at Barcade in Brooklyn, NY. The beer is near black with a half inch of head. Ample lacing on the pint glass. The aroma offers chocolate, malt, roast. A bit of cocoa in the flavor with a slightly bitter finish. Pretty smooth on the palate. Overall, this was ok. Hard to pass up a cask ale."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the pleasant mix of malts, and ultimately how smoothly the beer drank. The grain profile showed many faces, with rye, earthiness, and even that dog food graininess, but in a good way. The nose was found to be mild, and things lightened up too much in the taste at times. The sourness was also getting up there, with a pretty acidic finish, but really it was an appropriate, decent beer for the style."
"Overall the experience wasnâ€™t bad but not quite as enjoyable as the draft version; I may have spoiled myself a bit since that original pour with a wide range of quality porters and perhaps gotten a little more discerning."
"Enjoyable, clearly a quality creation in brewing. More good beer from Long Island NY"

"O - May be my favorite Greenport Beer. Really a solid porter that anyone who enjoys the style would like."
"O: Great flavor for a low abv beer. Another surprising gem from a brewery I had never heard of."

"O. It's your prototype porter."

"O- A local treat that has me thinking that Greenport is a place I should be keeping an eye on."
"O: Flavorful, drinkable porter with a commendably modest abv."

"This is a dang flavorful porter and at a low ABV so it gets bonus points. I really like the woody/light smoke flavor. Best that I have had from this brewery."
"D: This is a solid drinking porter that I would definitely have again."
"Its a very solid porter and definitely worth a try."
"I could drink this all day long. It's a great example of this style."
"D - Overall pretty easy drinker. Not a bad porter, but a bit on the watery and bitter side for my tastes. Good one for the style and worth a try for Porter fans."
"Reviewed on 9/30/2009. On tap at the brewery. Pours dark brown with a tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, bitter chocolate, and sweet sugary malt. Flavor of burnt roasted malt, bitter chocolate, and pretzels. Ok but a little bland. I was hoping for a touch more flavor and a stronger palate from this one."
"The beer has a very nice thick frothy head with some caramel aroma in the nose. The lacing and billowing is quite evident. It's an enticing beer, the best that this small, new, compact brewery has to offer, and a real seeker-outer. The distribution isn't much beyond Greenport, but they will be on their way if they keep making beers like the Black Duck. There is a pumpkin ale coming out in a couple of weeks."
"Overall a superior porter. Enjoyed fresh from the source."
"The impressive dark malt character of the ale reminded me of an English Porter from a cask, which was highlighted by chocolate and roasted coffee bitterness. It was remarkably easy to drink in the hot weather of an August afternoon in Greenport, NY. It seemed to mild in the abv area and it tasted great for a new entry to LI."
