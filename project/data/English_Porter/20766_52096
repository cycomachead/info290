4,-1.2,,,,,,"an outstanding glass of porter here, looking dark as pavement from the tap, with a mocha cream head on top and a deep dark complexion that flashes milk chocolate brown to obsidian black. the nose and taste are in line with one another, loaded with coffee notes and bitter roasted barley. it could be called a stout and not be off, its got the body and the roast levels for it, but it maintains its drinkability with a very clean finish from a robust yeast strain and a minimal hop profile. i think its very authentic, but also very rich and perfect for the new england autumn, which is fast approaching. so smooth in mouthfeel, just puffy like a marshmallow on the palate, but loaded with the dark malt character. one of the better homegrown porters ive had this year, and a great first impression was made here on me by the greenport harbor folks. looks from their listing like they do some cool stuff too.","StonedTrippin","Aug 17, 2014"

3.53,-12.8,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Found at The Beer Bar in Manhattan and served in a large chalice this porter has a solid black brown appearance with a respectable light chocolate colored thin layer of foam and excellent lacing. The aroma suggests a boozy chocolate malt with a hint of grassy hop. The flavor brings much more of a charcoal grass blend and very little chocolate. It seems to have an odd swampiness to it, a bit like stagnant water, that isn't wowing me but it generally overcomes this to provide an overall okay taste. The grassy hop slides into a sort of herbal idea in conjunction with the alligator water element. The booziness from the aroma also dissipates as you adjust to the flavor of this medium bodied brew with a midland, slightly resinous feel. As porters go I can't help but wish this had a bit more malt centric flavors and the tainted water thing does it no favors. If the off flavor is intended, then I'd have to say, don't waste your time. But if it was just a bad line or something, this might have potential. It may be an overhopped outcome but as one who worships hop indulgence, I have to doubt that. I'm going to assume something was a bit off in this first sample but it makes it hard to judge.","Durge","Nov 11, 2012"

3.88,-4.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Had a pint at Astoria Bier and Cheese on a Sunday afternoon. Overall, this was just a nice smooth, yet roasty porter. There was a mild, underlying creaminess that should come with an English porter. There's no hops presence, but the barley brings a great mix of light espresso, blackened toast, and touch of dry, dark chocolate. Order a pint if you find this on tap.","tempest","Oct 16, 2012"
3.88,-4.2,4,3.5,4,4,4,"A huge head as I pour from my 64 oz ( Best Yet Market in Harlem $9.99, what a deal!) Finally able to fill the glass and the settles to two plus fingers, Slow fade leave a light covering and decent lace here and there. Fluid is dark brown with garnet highlights. Almost opaque but some light does get through when it is bright enough. Smell has lots of roasted grains and some char/smoke. A very nice blend of molasses and a dark English style yeast fruitiness. A bit of dark chocolate infused espresso. Some earthy hops. Taste has a great blend of dark roasted flavors. Coffee, chocolate malt, cocoa nibs. A bit of molasses sweetened brown dinner rolls. Yeast esters give a fruity glue to the overall character. Hops are dry and earthy giving a clean finish that leaves a light note of fresh hop leafiness. Feel is medium weight with a crisp refreshing dryness. Carbonation is just on the lower side but still enough to make my mouth happy. A great session ale. I went through the growler as I cleaned up my yard preparing for hurricane Sandy, eating dinner and watching football. Refreshing, quenching, and satisfying. Yum.","scootny","Oct 14, 2012"

The grain profile showed many faces, with rye, earthiness, and even that dog food graininess, but in a good way. The nose was found to be mild, and things lightened up too much in the taste at times. The sourness was also getting up there, with a pretty acidic finish, but really it was an appropriate, decent beer for the style.","TheBrewo","Mar 31, 2012"
