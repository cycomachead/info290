The taste is good, it's got a great effervescent mineral character over roasted malts and chocolate. The mouthfeel is prickly and light, and the drinkability is good.

Decent aroma of charred grain and molasses, not very strong but pleasant enough. There was a hint of citrus as well. Rather thin in the body, appropriately lacking in fizz; a tad watery overall. The taste was unusual for this style: there was enough toastiness and caramel to qualify it as a porter, but the ill-mannered fruitiness from the hops took over too quickly. With prominent flavors of orange and lemon, even a little honey, this tastes more like a bitter than a porter. Call it a dark bitter, perhaps? Worth a try, but only once.","gfreed","Jul 19, 2009"

More of the same as this medium-bodied beer is smooth and creamy with a balance of both noticeable sweet malts (chocolate, caramel, toffee) and dry malts (coffee, roasted, biscuit) for a sweet, chewey beer that has a dry finish.

Quite vinous or ester-like in the nose. Good strong malt flavor that lasts briefly fading into vinous notes. Interesting, but not my favorite of the style, I tend to like coffee and chocolate notes in my porters, none of which are present in this brew (except possibly in the slightest amounts in the finish). Definitely worth a try.","Drew966","Jan 17, 2006"

4.1,8.5,4,4,4,4,4.5,"Had this on cask at dba in Manhattan... a solid all-around porter. Very roasty chocolatey flavors melding with a good deal of hoppiness that was almost reminiscent of a good English bitter. Very balanced and drinkable to the Nth degree on cask. I would always order a pint of this if I saw it on cask.","bultrey","Aug 23, 2005"

3.75,-0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Dark brown appearance with cherry-colored highlights. Big frothed milk head of over 1/2 an inch in height and plenty of lasting power. Laces in thick attractive sheets. Sweet aromas, butterscotch and brown sugar. Lower carbonation and medium mouthfeel, easy-going. Starts out with a bittersweet chocolate and a nice integration with the aroma to give a milky sense. Bittering is mild, with a flowery tone to it. The texture falls a little in the later profile, diminished somwhat by the finish. Goes out softly, which makes it drinkable and appropriate at 4.5% ABV, but doesn't really stand as a memorable single bottle.","ADR","Mar 07, 2005"
3.83,1.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a very slight black and chocolate malt aroma. It boasts of roasted malts and English ale yeast. The taste is good. It has a smooth and creamy black and chocolate malt flavor that is slightly sweet and dry on the finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a fine porter. I love the chocolate character, but the carbonation needs to be less. Anyway, this is a fine sessions ale; a good drinker.","WesWes","Feb 28, 2005"
2.89,-23.5,4,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Old Slug Porter (great name, great label) is one of the lightest porters that I've ever had. It's so light, in fact, that it seems unfinished; as if the brewers sketched the outlines of a good beer, but neglected to fill in the center, to give it substance. This one is skippable.","BuckeyeNation","Dec 17, 2004"
2.52,-33.3,5,3,2,2,2.5,"Overall: High carbonation that added to the appearance really detracted from the brew itself. I wont give up entirely, but will try to check out some notably fresher or cask versions next month in the UK. It may have lost something on the shelves at Wells. With all the other porters out there, both national and international, the slug only stays ahead by a clever label and some other nice appearances.","Dithyramb","Dec 13, 2004"
4.74,25.4,4,5,5,3,5,"Decent amount of carbination, would enjoy it more with a bit less, but still has a nice feel. Great, dark tastes of espresso and hops. Walnutty, bit of oaky whiskey, aftertaste of chocolate and vanilla beans. Caramelly honey sweetness, but nothing that is too heavy or cloying. Very easy drinker for us stout and porter lovers.","shapudding","Dec 05, 2004"

3.58,-5.3,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"500ml bottle: This one pours a fairly opaque brown color. There was a bit of a tight, tan head to it. Some lacing down the glass. Some roastiness to the aroma. Maybe some subtle fruits in there also. The taste is mainly roastiness, with hints of chocolate. A decent porter.","Boto","May 31, 2004"

3.48,-7.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3,"Dark brown, almost black yet when held up to the light it is brilliantly clear. Little head, low carbonation levels. Roasted chocolate aroma, actually, extremely roasty aroma. Flavor is dry and very slight sour chocolate roast. Then the finish is bone dry roasted. The mouthfeel is spot on, but the dry finish and the roasted nature don't score high drinkability.","GCBrewingCo","Sep 03, 2003"

3.32,-12.2,5,3,3.5,3,3,"This beer poured a large head that was tan, creamy and had fine sized bubbles. The hue of this beer is dark brown and the lacing was fair.

3.61,-4.5,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"It's very dark, with ruby highlights. An enormous tan head forms quickly and stays chunky throughout consumption. There's nothing strong in the aroma, just hints of chocolate and roastiness. The mouthfeel is kind of watery, but the taste is smooth and mellow chocolate and roasty flavors. It's mellow for a porter, but very enjoyable. I much prefer the more rich and flavorful porters.","AudioGilz","Nov 06, 2002"
4.43,17.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,5,"Deep ruby-hued, murky, brown body. Huge head (even on a careful pour - the yeast was pleasangly active in this bottle) with excellent retention and finally settles into the appearance of a float. Smell of barley and toasted toffee with hints of chocolate and a light fruit undertone. Taste of toffee, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Flavor becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. Bitterness is fairly low. Finishes with a light chocolate taste. Smooth and creamy, but slightly thin, mouthfeel. This is an excellent bottle-conditioned porter, and a perfect session beer.","Viking","Oct 26, 2002"
3.83,1.3,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"1pt brown bottle. Slug label is cool. Deep shiny black color. Huge rocky tightly fizzy beig head. Laced all the way down the glass, and stayed. Subtle smells of coffee, chocolate and roasted earthen woody smells. Taste was subtle yet balanced combination of slightly roasted coffee, sweet roasted malt. Chocolate malt finishes nicely, but overall a bit of a thin watery finish, especially for the rich dark look and smell. Very good and close to a great porter. I think it's just a touch watery, but worth a try.","StevieW","Apr 19, 2002"
3.53,-6.6,4.5,4,3,3,4,"Foamy, beige head is enormous. Pouring additional beer leaves a dent. As it subsides it is forming a plateau in the center of the glass. Good lacing. Body is black and ruby.  Aroma is coffee with milk chocolate highlights. Taste has mild coffee and chocolate, adds some hops, but is overall very subdued. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than expected from the look of the beer.  Not a bad beer, but somewhat disappointing.","RonfromJersey","Beers"
3.46,-8.5,4,3,3.5,4,3.5,"The glass I used may not have been rinsed thoroughly because I got a slight soapy taste in the beer. I've heard some beers referred to as being a little soapy, but the guy I split the bottle with didn't get it. The head was out of control (again an unthoroughly rinsed glass could explain this) but it wasn't much smaller on the glass I poured my friend. Nice roasty maltiness and some coffee notes like you'd expect from a porter but everything was a little subdued. Nice smouth mouthfeel with some body to it. Beer is dark with blood/ruby highlights. Not bad, but I probably won't be a regular drinker.","aracauna","0"
