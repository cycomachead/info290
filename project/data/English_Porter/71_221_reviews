"- not the biggest fan of chocolate flavors but this was pleasant!"

"An extremely smooth porter. Sessionable, but, almost wish it had a little more bite to it. That said, I wouldn't hesitate to buy again."
"Pretty damn good beer. Easy drinking."

"Overall I thought this was a nice beer and I thought it was a good example of the style, this beer had every aspect that separates a English Porter from an American Porter and while i do prefer American Porters I can still appreciate this beer and know that it's a good example of the style.  What I like the most about this beer was just how true to style it is, it's just what I expect from an English Porter.  What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, It didn't have any off aspects or anything that shouldn't be there.  I would buy this beer again when in the mood for the style and I would recommend this to anyone who likes English Porters.  All in all I was happy with this beer, I had heard this was good and it lived up to it.  This beer made for a good first impression of this brewery and I would be interested to try more of their beers.  As far as I can tell this is the best English Porter I've had.  Good job guys this, this was a good beer, keep it up."

"Would I buy this again? Yes"
"Definitely better at a warmer temperature. No cold glasses!"
"Body is light and creamy."
""
"It is commercial transnational parody on a good beer."
""
""
""
"Deep ruby color with thin off white head that disappears quickly spite medium carbonation. Aroma is complex with an even chocolate, coffee, roasty, and spice character. Flavor is rich with a mild bitterness that is quite buried under a thick layer of malty, chocolate, coffeeness. Flavor is lingering but smooth clinging to the malty, chocolate, coffeeness. Excellent beer and top example of a tradition English Porter."
""
"Two finger creamy tan head. Mild cocoa like aroma.Very dark almost opaque as I had to hold it up to a light bulb to see a deep ruby like color. Mild bitterness. Soft chocolate and coffee taste. I sense a chalk like feel to the chocolate which may be the coffee side kicking it, Has a rich soft feel."
"Its sweet and the bitterness is not weak. Nice porter."
""
""
""
""
"Nose roasted malt, molasses, caramel, slight ash. Taste sweet roasted malt, faint coffee & chocolate, slight hops. Nice Porter!"
""
"11.2 oz. bottle from BevMo. Pours opaque black with a small, caramel colored head. Nose of roasted malts with a hint of chocolate. Taste of roasted malt, caramel, black coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Little carbonation. Rich and tasty. Not light by any means. More of a sipping beer. Nicely balanced. A classic porter."
""
"Feel is smoth, I prefer porters with higher body and carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: [4.25] This is a world class porter.  Weighing in with only 5.4% ABV it is really packing flavor into that small space.  It looks great in the glass, it hs an inviting smell and tastes delicious."
""
""
"Overall this is a wonderful beer, super flavorful with great balance in all aspects."
"Overall:  This is a great porter, one of the best actually!  Traditional flavors of roasted malt and coffee beans, balanced perfectly with some caramel and brown sugar-like sweetness.  A perfect porter and a perfect session beer!"
"O:  great brew and the brewmaster's deft hand at handling roasted (not burnt) malt here is excellent; it's almost too easy to drink; never too bitter nor too sweet"

"DATE TASTED: January 17, 2015... GLASSWARE: Barley Creek pint ... OCCASION: Silver Linings Playbook watching requires a comparable libation.. APPEARANCE: ruby black body; brown, fizzing, simmering head; holds to a quarter-inch that sits throughout; attractive... AROMA: robust chocolate, coffee, and that peat scent that is undeniably porter; light and alluring... PALATE: milky, silky smooth; an unbelievably agreeable beer to sip--I found half the glass drained before I even began the palate/taste analysis...TASTE: as lactic and chocolaty as a porter could be; the hops balance this extraordinarily; sugary and sweet--a dessert in a bottle...OVERALL: God, what a joy it is to revisit the greats; a beer this fluid should not be this flavorful and enjoyable..."
"Nice, toasty Porter without The ridiculous amounts of sweetness that can ruin a Porter."
""
""
"""Rich, dark and complex"" says the bottle, and that about summarizes it. A very strong flavor a bit like a roasted stout, but softer. Good for social events or personal degustations, a bit overkill for sports or outside events."
""
"O – An interpretation of porter that blurs the line with English stout, basically lighter in color and in bitterness but with the coffee-ish notes.  Enjoyed this very much."
"Middle of the pack porter. Perfect example of this style. Nothing to rave about. Solid."
""
"I wasn't sure what to expect with this one, but it definitely won me over. It poured very dark but not opaque brown with light dissipating head. Delicious dark chocolate coffee dark fruit nose. Palate follows suit with ideal balance between bready sweetness, fruity acidity and chocolate bitterness. Gentle but noticeable lingering hops finish. Looking forward to trying more from Fuller's!"

"500 ml bottle poured into English pint glass. very dark. 3 finger head that leaves some lacing. Nose has malt, chocolate, coffee. Very smooth. Coffee and chocolate notes with a slightly bitter finish. Excellent beer! Great Porter - a sweet malt finish."

"delicious.  to me, it's perfect. there may be better porters that i don't know about yet but this is exactly what i think a porter should be. the chocolate smell the chocolate taste, the coffee, the perfect amount of sweetness without being overwhelmed by sweetness, the drinkability."

"Overall: quite a nice English Porter - very traditional and good quality. The price is a bit over the top, as most English beers are in Australia - an equivalent case of 24 x 330mL bottles is around AU$110. Can definitely get similar for far less, but one every now and then won't hurt."

"BBD 11/15/14.  Clear pour that is almost as dark as a stout, but has a dark ruby cast.  Slightly below average head volume and retention, but laces well.  Nice nose of caramel, coffee, toffee and a slight burnt chocolate smokiness.  Medium bodied with a texture that approaches creamy.   Slightly below normal carbonation with just a touch of effervescence on the finish.  The excellent flavor profile is complex and balanced.  It begins with coffee then flows into a light caramel sweetness coupled with toffee.  Hops come forward in the middle with a light flavor and bitterness over a smoky chocolate.  The finish is somewhat dry and leaves you with a lingering chocolate smokiness with a mineral character."
""
"I personally enjoyed the aroma more than the flavor; and while the flavor is also quite enjoyable, I would have liked it more if it had followed the nose more closely and then persisted in that regard. Nevertheless, I did indeed enjoy this porter immensely and look forward to having it again."

"An outstanding porter"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a nice dark roast with a moderate head that breaks down to a few bubbles, the smell is sweet and malty, promising a taste that does not dissappoint. Great long finish."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: My first time trying this one and I was not disappointed. I'm a huge fan of porter and stout style beers and this fit right it! Buy some and see for yourself."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Final Thoughts: I think this porter would be a knock out on nitro or cask, allowing the malt to really shine. But even after my first taste of this historic beer, I completely understand why it has stood the test of time. Its just a plain great example of the style. Would I drink it again? Yes."
""
"The beer pours some cream colored and creamy textured head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a clear brown with a bit of dark brown notes. The beer smell is rich and divine. The smell has a combination of bready yeast smell with a coffee smell and a sweet and light dark chocolate smell. The beer also has a milky smell as well. The taste is a bit different than the smell. The taste is less milky than the smell and has stronger bitter hop notes. The bready yeast note is still there but not as pronounced. The coffee roast taste is also there in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very silky with very little carbonation. Overall, a very good English Porter and worth its reputation."
""
""
""
"My mark out of 100 would be 88."
"Expected a lot going in and I was not dissapointed. If you like a smoked porter, there's probably none more great!"

"O - It's an archetype, what more to say?"
""
""
""
""
"O: WOW. This is one beautiful malty treat. It's got the perfect amount of roast and coffee with just a hint of chocolate sweetness. The hop base, gives a mild bitter underpinning while still letting the malt steal the show. This is the perfect beer for those who don't like the full body of a stout but want a stout character. A definite winner."
""
""
""
""
"a very nice $1.79 spent... coco, coffee, malty nose. dark toasted oats, roasted nuts dominate the flavor with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Nice malts coming through and a wonderful coffee finish. couldn't really notice any significant hops presence, as the coffee rules the finish. A nice porter and very nice for the price."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall -This is an excellent example of the style. I tend to think of English Porters as being slightly sour. This beer lacks that element. Other than this flaw, it is very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste does highlight some of the toasty malty characters and biscuit. Mild finish. I mean, it is one of the Porters that others strive to emulate."

"Overall: I shouldve known what I was getting into after trying Anchor Porter the other week. This was just too sweet with not enough coffee notes. I prefer American style porters all the way (Founders, Smuttynose, Eddy Fitz)"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"o: A tasty and refined porter. Very easy drinking and sippable. I'll have to revisit Founders' Breakfast Stout to recall what that has that this one apparently does not besides higher ABV and ""fuller"" body, based on the differences in the BA ratings of the two."

"This was a treat that I will not hestiate to go back to when in the mood for a lower ABV dark beer or Porter. Fuller's London Porter has earned it's world class reputation in my book. Well done, indeed!"
"This Porter just blends the flavors together so they just flow over the palette to make a smooth, velvet flow of deliciousness."

"Fuller's London Porter was a blast to drink, and so quaff-able. I could make an evening of just drinking this beer. The wonderfully sweet nose blends well with the complex palate of bittersweet, roasty, and bready flavors."
""
"Pours a molasses-colored body, good head at first but doesn't stay long and not much lacing to speak of. Aroma is coffee grains, dark chocolate with roasted malt in the back. Medium strength coffee as main flavor, bit of bitter chocolate but the depth of the taste is not great. Slight metallic finish. Not full-bodied at all, middling. Average on most accounts."
""
""
""
"OVERALL - complexity and depth of flavor are excellent, balance is sweet and then wiped off the palate by gentle but creeping roasted qualities, hoppiness comes through, I revisited this old favorite because BJCP has it listed as an example of ""Brown Porter""...brown porter my ass, this is as robust as they come."
"O: Easy drinking, complex, balanced, urges you to sip it with some air coming in as you do to enhance the lovely smokey bouquet. Almost tobacco- smoke like, a sweet unfiltered Churchman's cigarette. 4.25"
"O) I really enjoyed this beer and would characterize it as a prime example of the Porter category."

"O - A porter that fully lives up to it's reputation. Delicious and easy to drink with a wide range of flavors."
"I was in the mood for a stout or porter, and noticed this at the local LCBO, which is shamefully devoid of those styles. For whatever god awful reason, I had it in mind that Fuller's wasn't considered to be a good brewery, but I was quickly corrected after both checking the score on BA, and trying it for myself. Top notch brew, which I found to be immensely satisfying. Glad I bought two."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle from Proof Bottle Shop. Deep clear brown with a finger of tan head. Fair lacing with good head retention. Tons of caramel in the aroma with some noticeable toasted malt. Taste is still lots of caramel and dreads, with some deep maltiness. Great mouthfeel! Good carbonation, medium to full body. Perfect for the style!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"although it is impressive, It isnt something I would drink regularly as the style is a bit heavy for my usual, but in the future I am sure I will buy this again , and if porters are your thing, you probably already know, this is a great one."
""
"I love Fuller's as a brewery and I have waited a while to try this classic porter, not because it is particularly difficult to track down but because as a darker malty beer it keeps longer in my way overstocked beer fridge: Gotta drink the hoppy ones first to capture the fresh aromatics. Finally fished a bottle out because it was a cold porter or stout kind of night. Anyhow, many sources claim that a good porter is dark brown to blackish with beautiful ruby red highlights (e.g., see Foster's book on Porter in the Classic Beer Styles series). Lo and behold, that's exactly what this brew looks like, quite sexy. Yes, sexy. Aroma is rich chocolate, roasted chicory, sweet dried fruit, and a little English hop earthiness. A little like sniffing a bag of chocolate-covered raisins. Palate lives up to the hype, massive English malt rustic complexity coupled with dark rich aromatic flavors of treacle, butterscotch toffee, pipe tobacco, and a little leather. Some floral aromatics and a tangy sour note dance on top, and there is also a healthy blast of dark bread crust likely from genuine brown malt (highly kilned rather than stewed, but there's chocolate malt in here too), with the latter particularly prominent in the finish along with a little charcoal. Less sweet and sour and more rich and toasty than some other London porters, probably this one is the benchmark for the lot. Moderately thick body with a decent amount of carbonation but the finish is a nice earthy bitterness that prevents things from getting too sweet or bubbly. Should be on any English beer fan's top 10 list and you can even get this in cans now."
""
""
""
"Overall- This is one of the best porters that I've tried. I will be seeking this one again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"As a major fan of porters, this one is about as good as they get. The pour is a beautiful mahogany brown, almost ebony with a luscious full two finger head which eventually fades to a small retention ring. Lacing is impressive too. All the great porter notes are present, coffee, chocolate, toffee, caramel, licorice, roasted nuts. The taste, easy drinking, follows the nose almost perfectly. What is really impressive is that flavors are very subtle and move seamlessly from one to the other culminating in a delightful roasted bitter finish. Mouthfeel is full, but not thick, and satisfying. This one is a must for fans of porters."
"Overall: I really enjoyed this beer. I can easily picture myself drinking this as a session beer for a BBQ or steak cookout. Very well balanced, flavorful and light. I believe I've found myself a new go-to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: very complex beer. It's not my favority profile, but really interesting and well made. But love the complexity and balance, will definately drink this again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall a nice example of an English porter."
"Overall - Was hoping this would be a good beer (hadn't viewed any ratings here, to know what the expectations were) and expectations were shattered. Brilliant beer, one that keeps you looking for the next sip constantly. A great sipper that i hope to enjoy soon by allowing it to warm a bit first for added effect."
""
"O - A damn near perfect English porter. Simple. Classic. Elegant. It's east to see why Fuller's has been around so long; by cranking out quality products like this for the last 150 odd years. I'm thrilled that this is now available in my area, and will be buying it often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is just an awesome beer all around. Definitely a buy-again."
""
""
"Atmosphere is excellent. Dark hue, nice head, lots of carbonation, and some fair lacing. Nose is great combination of coffee, wood, and bitter dark chocolate. Complex combination of coffee and tea, wood and peat, bitter chocolate and licorice. Has a very roasted character to it. Overall, this is a great quaff."
"500 ml. bottle, pours a dark, almost black colour, with an off white head that leaves a big lace. Smell is earthy, coffee, dark fruits, chocolate. It goes caressing your tongue with a coffee palate, then comes a chocolate, cherries and dark fruits. Coffee liquor like Kahlua or Tia Maria comes to mind. More complex than what I really said, it's a great beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- I would highly recommend this to anyone who is into porters/stouts and isn't looking for an over abundance of bitterness. Fullers London Porter is packed with malty goodness that will not disappoint."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into pint glass and immediately thought it looks a little light for a porter but it has a nice white head and lace. Or at least a little lighter than most porters. The smell has that burnt malt smell you'd expect but is also has a sweetness to it that you usually don't smell in a porter. At this point I'm not really expecting much out of this beer. The first sip changed my thinking quick. Very creamy and bold. It might be a little light but not to extreme to discount this as a porter. I very much enjoyed the consistency and drinkability. I think you can have a few of these in one session. Overall, I really liked this and will definitely have more of these is the fall and winter with some chilli."

""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A classic beer. Maybe has lost a touch over the years, or it could be modern extreme beers stealing the spotlight, but there still is something to be said for simple, full flavored, modest ABV beers. I'd always be willing to include a few of these in a session."
""
"O: a fantastic malt forward porter well balanced with an English hop finish"
""
""
""
""
""
"O- lovin' it! Excellent example of an English brown porter. Lower hop and roast bitterness than many American examples. Easy drinking and superbly balanced."
""
""
""
"O: I've had many examples of american porters and enjoyed most of them . But this is the real deal. It's even brewed in jolly ole"" England. I found it to be extremely balanced with every facet playing off of and complimenting the other. I also liked that it wasn't all hopped up like so many of its american counterparts. I can envision myself pounding back several pints of it with me mates at a London pub."

"This classic Porter has a dark drown earthy color, near black, with a tall head of soft foam. This beer has minimal carbonation, and gains some points for excellent head retention and lacing. The pleasant aroma I've drawn in is mostly dark fruit esters and molasses. After a tasting, more complexity is noted, bringing to mind mocha, toffee, and graham cracker crust. The mouth feel is very creamy and smooth, and the finish even has a light touch of hop bitterness. This could be my favorite overall low ABV beer!"
""
""
""
"Overall - 3.75/5"
""
""
"London Pride is a great dark ale that's more than the sum of its parts. Everything comes together to yield a porter that's tasty and easy to knock back, if not quite at sessionable ABV levels. While generally $10+ per sixer (in NJ, eastern US), it's worth the price tag."
"Would definitely have bought a few for tonight had I known I would have liked it so much."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, there is a reason this is a classic. It is not as adventurous as many new craft porters, but it is solid and there is a lot to appreciate."

"O- Another classic by Fullers. One of my favorite porters. So complex and so delicious. A brew that is tough to set the glass down. I felt like I just poured it, started making notes on the review, and before i knew it, it was all gone. Now I'm a little sad that I don't have another."
"I feel that the beer has the same appearance, smell, and taste as previouse reviews. I am writing this to note that the roasted hops come on strong and one would expect a powerful taste, but this beer is suprisingly light an complex given its rich and dark smell and appearance."
""
"Excellent beer. Not at all acrid, plenty of chocolate, not overly sweet. Very well balanced."
""
"Two Words: London Perfect"
""
""
""
"Overall: The shining example of a quaffable porter. Packed full of earthy flavors with just enough sweetness to keep you coming back for more."
""
""
"Overall, certainly worth a go, but not in the same league as the Kernel."
""
""
""
""
""
"To H.E. double hockeysticks with the big boy beers! Get out there and taste what really makes a beer like this a craft. It was crafted long ago and perfected over the years. There is ages of experience in this beer and you have to give it a try. If you hate dark beers, this is by no means a mild dark beer, but it is one of the best and you owe it to yourself to try it. I guarantee that in the least you will appreciate this beer as a quality beer. You may not like it, in which case I would deem you insane, BUT you will know what a good beer truly is. Life is too short to waste on watered down experiences, go full throttle! *enter rebel yell here*"

"Dark black color, decent head, surprised I haven't reviewed this before. Maybe I've never had it? Aroma was malty, decent. Flavor was malty with slight bits of cocoa and coffee as promised by the label. Overall, a decent porter and something I might pick up if the price happened to be right."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dark amber appearance with not too much head. Roasted chestnut aroma. The flavor kind of falls flat for us. The roasted nutty malted flavor and creaminess are apparent and taste great but without much depth or many nuances. It seems to not go the distance. Good beer but there are others that are more complete. Drinkability is also great as well as the finish. It finished a bit sweeter and it's flavor stayed strong."

"O: very easy to drink"
"Overall. This is a great brew. There's a reason why this is in the top 100. It's definitely one of the best English Porters I've ever had and it's a fantastic representation of the style. The drinkability is nice and this is a beer that I'll definitely revisit. I could picture myself drinking this in the rainy climate of London. Nice."

"Overall happy to finally get a fresh enough bottle to review and am very impressed. Can easily see why this is the #1 English Porter. A must try."

"O: It was a good beer. 50/50 chance I would buy this again. Bold and strong with an interesting mouth feel."

"Fullers London Porter is a tasty, easy drinking and flavorful English Porter."
"Pours dark brown with a creamy, fully lasting, brown head. Aromas are roasted, toasted malts, with some coffee and dark chocolate hints. The taste is again characterized by roasted malts, mild coffee, caramel. Leaves a well balanced flavor, between bitter, sweet, and dry, with a pleasant watery texture. Great example of an English porter."

"330 ml bottle into pint glass, best before 8/6/2013. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, cream, roasted malt, coffee, toast, light dark fruit, and light herbal hops. Fantastic aromas with great balance and strength. Taste of milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, coffee, roasted malt, cocoa, citrus, toast, and herbal. Good amount of citrus and roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, roasted malt, toast, cocoa, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic flavor balance and robustness; zero cloying flavors on the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol presence is invisible, with zero warming noticed on the finish. Overall this is a fantastic English porter! Great flavor robustness and balance; and extremely smooth to drink. Simply outstanding. I can’t believe I haven’t had this before."

"Overall – This is a fantastic brown ale. It has a great flavor with fantastic transitions. It has a great feel and a wonderful smell to boot A very good one to try if you have the chance. Delicious."
"Dark brown-mahogany pour with caramel colored two finger head with good retention and decent lacing. Rich and roasty nose with hints of cocoa, dark fruit, coffee, molasses, toffee, and just a touch of metal. The taste follows suit with lots of fresh roasted coffee, dark chocolate, figs, nuts, toffee, tobacco, wood, and some mineral notes as well. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth as silk with a great dry, subtly bitter finish. Hugely drinkable and not heavy at all. Truly a world class Porter!"
"Overall I think this is one of my favorite beers of all time. Enlih porter is my favorite style, and I'm not sure if I prefer this or taddy porter. In bottle form I'd choose the taddy, but the London porter on tap takes the cake... Until I can find taddy on tap, I can't say which is my top beer."

"O - very nice porter, perfect balance of flavors with alcohol."
"Fuller's sets the bar again. Nice blend of British water and yeast with a great malt profile. Easy drinking and sweet enough to feel like liquid bread."
"D - Completely satisfying... Textbook English Porter that everyone should experience... I can't say a bad thing about this beer... Lots of character and charm for a 5.4% ABV offering... I could enjoy quite a few of these in a sitting... I would gladly indulge in this again and highly recommend..."

"If you ever find it, try it."

"Overall a solid representation of the style, comparable to Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter."

""
"A recent wave of American porters in which adjuncts or specialized malts are used to foreground the flavors that classical porters like this one suggest Here, I am thinking of the dozens of nutty (e.g., pecan) porters, chocolate porters, coffee porters, etc., that I have tried in recent years. Fuller's London Porter achieves similar effects while maintaining a lightness and drinkability. Outstanding."
""
"Overall excellent stuff from London."
""
""
""

"O: As with others of this style, it gets high marks for drinkability. Not quite as good as Taddy Porter, but certainly a great beer for a cool fall evening like tonight."

"The classic English porter that is one of the best porters brewed today. Just a wonderfully crafted ale."
""
"Overall, a fundamental, wonderful porter that is not called ""world's finest"" for nothing. (500 ml into pint, BB 2013-08-06)"
""
"O: First beer I've tried from England and its pretty good, very complex but yet not overbearing and very refreshing. Little bit lacking on the flavor side especially for a porter in my opinion, but I like the style going here so it's a beer to get a hold of, the pros way exceed the cons."
""
""
"overall... what a darn fine product. i didnt expect to see ""the bros"" rate it so highly, especially since i cosider it more of a 'commercial' brew, but everyone else's reviews support my feelings about this stuff. less of a stout drinker, but i appreciate a really good stout, or porter, once in awhile but more accustomed to the higher abv'ed versions. i recommend this heartily. and because it's 'commercial', it shouldnt be too difficult to find if you have a BEVMO or TOTAL WINE near you . . . . . i would definitely like to find this in a keg somewhere...."

"O - Roasted and robust, Fuller's London Porter is a chocolate and coffee-like flavored treat which all comes from the malt complexity, no added ingredients! It's full-bodied but at no point does it become thick or undrinkable and it's so bold in flavor, it's impressive the beer remains around 5% alcohol. Fuller's London Porter is a stellar beer for any occasion."
""
"O: a really well rounded porter from beginning to end, nice complexity and depth,"
"O - Overall one of the best porter's I have drank thus far."
""
"overall: I like this stout. It's thinner then most, but is packed with flavor. It's not hiding in subtleties, but just delivers the coffee, chocolate, licorice and caramel flavors with a nice balance of sweetness and a light bitter. If i had to criticize it, i'd say it's lacking a bit of depth. It's not something i'd drink all night, because it starts to bore a little after one. Although to me, this is quite common for a stout. It may be a little too sweet and straight forward for me to enjoy even more. But it's one of the better stouts out there, so i'd say: recommended!"

"Future reviews: Coopers Brewery Best Extra Stout, St Peter's Cream Stout, D. Carnegie & Co. Klass III Porter"
"Smoky aroma is a joy to invite into the nose with its quality coffee, licorice and molasses notes and hints of charred wood, yeast and - anchovies? Pours a rich, cool sable that is just a kitten’s whisker above midnight black with a thick and fine-bubbled, it not too persistent, buff head. Flavor does not disappoint - smoked wood, roast coffee and licorice dominate the flavor but let through hints of treacle and herbs. Full body has plenty of fizz and leaves a nice smoky, slightly hoppy, slightly sweet finish. I can see - er, make that taste - why this is a top rated Porter! Mud in your eyes!"

"Medium body, medium-high carbonation. Not stellar but very good and certainly worth revisiting. Also, better on cask if you can find it."

"It comes to the table in a proper English pint a solid dark brown color with beautiful ruby highlights when held to light. Creamy tan/brown head shows great retention and covers most of the glass on the way down. Smells heavy on the chocolate, but also has generous helpings of caramel, brown sugar, earthy, and mineral aromas. The flavor leans to the malty side with chocolate and caramel dominating the flavor. There's an earthy and mineral flavor that does nicely to cut through the malt and provide some balance. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a creamy sweet mouthfeel. This is a really nice porter with a great expression of chocolate malt. I might have to drink more of these."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Excellent porter. Smooth and went down easy. Would grab this again."
"Fillers London porter pours a deep red brown with a beautiful brown head that lingers. The aroma is sweet, chocolatey malt with plenty of caramel and herbal, earthy hops. The flavor is malty with more slightly astringent chocolate. A nice round hop bitterness and more herbal hops finish the beer off with light carbonation."
""
""
""
"This was a very flavorful and well balanced beer. Especially the balance of the chocolate and the coffee flavors. I would drink this again."
""
""
"O: The bottle shop where I bought this wouldn’t sell singles, so I got a six-pack; and man, how great that turned out to be. Knowing that I have five more of these in my fridge is a wonderful feeling – this beer hits so many marks that I know I’d be going back for more if this were my only bottle."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a dark, dark amber with decent head and surprisingly full mouthfeel. Very pleasant aroma of roasted malts with oak tannins. The flavour is robust and well balanced, malty sweetness with a nicely dry hop finish. This is a beer I've drunk for years - an absolutely excellent ""go to"" pint. Well done, Fuller's!"

"FLP is a surprisingly good beer. I didn't expect to get such a treat when I bought this one. It pours a near-opaque dark brown with a light brown head that disappears rather quickly but leaves nice lacing. The smell is overloaded with malts but very good, with just a touch of coffee. More of the same in the taste and very well-balanced. Very dry finish. I'll be buying this again for sure."

"Served from bottle into a sampler shaker. Poured dark brown with a minimal off-white head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, chocolate, subtle coffee, and cream. The flavor was of roasted malt, cream, subtle coffee, earth, and earth hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. I really enjoyed the cream aspect I got on this one as it really did a nice job of balancing out the subtle coffee bitterness I got on this one. The aroma on this one pretty much let you know what you were in for on the flavor. Decent example of the style that I would suggest to a new Porter drinker."

"D - This is a winner, and has further roused my interest in the brewery. I've yet to have anything bad."
"Chestnut brown, nearly two fingers of off white/tan head, lots of lace. Smell is roasty and malty, chocolate and coffee, rich and decadent, some yeasty notes as well. Taste is roasted, chewy malts, coffee, milk chocolates, flavours layer very nicely and are all easily decipherable, lightly bitter but in more of a bittersweet type of way. Light carbonation, smooth and creamy, light-medium body. Outstanding stuff, this is the benchmark for the style in my opinion, would love the opportunity to try the cask version of this, this will see regular rotation in my fridge thats for sure."
"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip at fridge temp. A beautiful tan head forms on an aggressive pour and stays. The beer is very dark ruby, not entirely opaque; very pretty in the glass. The aromatics are roasted malt, cocoa, and dark caramel.That comes through in the flavor too, as does a velvety smoothness. The finish is nicely grainy. The body is light to moderate. This is a fantastic porter with a terrific balance and great drinkability."
""
"O: Thoroughly meh. The nose is quite pleasant, but the body and flavor profile are too light to back it up. If I ever wanted a super light, sessionable dark beer, perhaps I’d look to this, but it’s doubtful."

"Truly good with rich malt and chocolate characters, a quaffable quality is quite like an evil, couldn’t stop begging for more."

"Pours a super dark black, with a one finger cocoa head on it. Decent lacing on the side of my snifter. The nose is molasses, toffee, coffee, and chocolate. Really well done. The taste follows suit, with a slight bitter aftertaste. Medium in feel, with a bitter coffee aftertaste on it. I'd like a little more malt. Overall, a good porter.... I'd have this again. Cheers."

""
""
""

"Truly delicious and a treat throughout. Almost desert in a bottle. There is enough dark bready character, roasted malts and melanoidins to really push this above and beyond."
""
""
""
""
"O: Both porters are excellent. I enjoyed this one just a bit more than the Samuel Smith's due to its more roasted, coffee-like flavor."
""
"One of my favorite sessionable porters. Looks great with a two-finger tan head. Dark brown brew with solid lacing as you drink. Lots of roast, malt, dark chocolate, and toffee in the aroma. Nice balanced, basic porter taste that goes down real smooth. Overall flavor profile is pretty subdued, nothing really jumps out, but what you do get is wonderful. Really something I could drink all night without thinking twice. Nice roast finish on the palate."

"It's extremely drinkable and mild, and though that's not what I come to in a porter usually, it's refreshing, and ultimately a successful beer that serves as somewhat of a standard benchmark to judge others in the style against, for better and for worse."
"Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Lighter than expected. A pretty good porter. Smooth and well balanced. Interesting flavour profile."
""
""

""

"Overall: Really nice English-style porter with a nice balance of brown malt charater, roasted malt, and mild dark fruit esters. Quite drinkable. It runs about $12.00 a sixer. At that price point, it's certainly not something I'd buy regularly. Nice counterpoint to many American Robust Porters, but a bit 2-dimensional and lacking just a bit of depth. I'd give this a mid-high B: something I'd purchase every once in awhile for a change of pace."
"O: Though I can't justify buying this stuff everyday at $13 a six pack, this is still a great session porter overall. Thumbs up."
""
"Drinkablity: Very tasty. A sessionable porter is good to find."
""
"Pours out a dark brown almost black color with a sticky looking head. The smell is immediately bittersweet cocoa and coffee and again the vinous smell that I get from these English ales. It is nice roasty smell of a deliciously dark rich porter. The taste is wonderfully complex and rich. I'm getting plenty of dark chocolate notes, coffee, smoke, and some sweetness like a toasted marshmallow. The hops are in the background adding a nice finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. This is a superb Porter which most should be judged against."
"O- Overall a very delicious English Porter. I don't think it would be a stretch to call it one of the best of it's style."
""
"O: A very nice and enjoyable brew. Smooth, toasty, big, and robust. Think it should definitely be enjoyed on-draft though. Great job Fuller's!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is not a bad beer by any stretch, but I would not choose it over any handful of solid American porters."
""
"D: Quite tasty overall, which really surprised me after an underwhelming smell. A wonderful example of the English porter and certainly high on my list of beers. Love the bottle design, too."
""

"Drink- I wanted more and I think this one maybe a bit on cask would be better with the creamy feel. Still much more above than most american tries at a classic style."

"Drinkability: The flavor and aroma are well crafted and true to style. Though I expect a much thicker body, I think it does the job."
"Great drink! While the flavor is nice, it is this porter's complimentary qualities that bring it to the top of my list of best porters."
"This brew pours a brown color with two fingers of head that quickly drops down to a tiny cap. Aroma is full roast and chocolate with a touch of dark fruits. The taste is very good, it's a nice bitter brew driven by the roasted coffee and semi-sweet chocolate. The dark fruits are also present on the taste rounding out the flavor spectrum. The mouthfeel is smooth, but a touch less carbonated than I'd like. The drinkability is very good. Overall, a great porter."
""
""
""
"This beer is really the benchmark for the style and one that I will go back to again and again."

"Good Porter, although I’m generally more partial to robust American versions than classic English Porters, but this definitely fits its style category very well."
"This beer poured out as a pretty nice looking brown color with a creamy tan head on top. The smell of the beer had some wood like aromas blended with some roasted malts and other earthy aromas. The taste of beer is bold and bitter with some roasted chocolaty flavors. The mouthfeel was thin and dry with just a enought carbonation to keep this one alive. Overall this beer was pretty good. I'd drink it again."

"Notes: This is fantastic beer with a rich deep flavor. So drinkable, so pleasurable."
"A must taste for any serious beer drinker."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but a bit thinner than expected. Overall, Fuller's London Porter might just be the archetype of the English Porter and certainly a must try for any beer lover."
"This is light and drinkable. I prefer my porters American and hoppy, but one can't help but appreciate the balance between roasted malts and breaded malts. This is a top notch example of a porter."
"o - Overall a really nice English porter. I really liked the nose and this is a great example of the style. easy to drink and available all over, I'd certainly pick this up again."
"5.4% so I suppose it should be a bit weak, but man this is weak and watery. It could use the magic of a cask treatment or nitro tapping to up the body. Still has some carbonation and a bit of body so it doesn’t embarrass the style."
"Appearance is dark brown to nearly black, with a long-lasting dark tan head. A generous amount of lacing adds to the visual experience. Cocoa and molasses scents were pleasant but a bit weak. This is a very chocolate-tasting beer; more so than any other I've had. Slight roasty and bready flavors are noticed as well. Quite rich and tasty."
"This is a world-class porter that I can't really find much to complain about. Superb, rich malt flavours, good body, and a very satisfying brew all around, this porter is definitely worth a try and is basically the gold standard of the style to me. Not much of a session ale, this is a quick sipper for during or after dinner."
"O: I highly enjoyed this, and would probably get it again. I recommend that everyone at least try it."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson brown with a 1 inch puffy khaki head that settles to a thin cap. Nice foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee, and nice chocolate aromas. There is also a slight milk-like aroma I am getting from this one.Taste is of dark roasted malt, brewed coffee, and some cocoa powder. A mild roasty bitterness lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good English porter that is very easy to drink. With a lower ABV it is also something you could drink all night without getting too sloshed."
"D/O: A satisfying porter for sure; ample drinkability and smooth; traditional and tasty."
"I want more!"
"O: A solid, drinkable porter."
"O - A really top British beer. Rich, full flavoured and supremely tasty."
"Rich, full-bodied, medium effervescence. Aftertaste gets a bit ashy but otherwise its a really good Porter."
"Overall: Very flavorful and something I'd definitely get again where offered."
"This is the definitive brown/english porter in my opinion. Fantastic, delicious, and abounding with subtle complexities. I love this beer."
"O: 4.5"
"O: quality porter for sure, not really stacking up with the greats for me."
"This beer is a classic and I would love to keep it in steady rotation in my fridge but it's a bit too pricey for me."
"O: Excellent Porter with lots of character. A good choice to compare other porters to."
"O- A good porter, but I'm not sure the price point merits me buying it. Good, not great, but I'd drink again."
"Overall: A very good English Porter. Full flavored and tasty while still being light and smooth enough to be a session beer."
"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavours and aromas."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is alive with chocolate, roasted malts, a touch of coffee. Taste is the same except not as strong as the smell, still chocolaty with some malts and coffee. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a high quality beer."
"Extremely smooth and drinkable."
"Overall: Very refreshing and drinkable. I would highly recommend this porter. Don't get too many great porters here in China, so I appreciate this one."
"VERY NICE, GIVE IT A GO!"
"D: very tasty english porter. soft, elegant flavors make a rich and fulfilling drink. i love an intense stout/porter, but this is perfect for the the drinkability/light body that backs it."
"this is a fantastic english porter. recommended."
" If they didn't export it to America it would be worth flying to England to try!!"
"This is a good full-bodied beer that can stand on it's own merits or complement any meal."
"D - Extremely drinkable and goes down really easy. Although the the sweet chocolate flavor isn't exactly at the forefront here, it was still easily detectable and thoroughly enjoyable. I especially like that the roasted malt and coffee-like bitterness didn't bury the smooth chocolatey side of this carefully crafted flavor profile. Well done."
"Summary - I should be careful with this brew, I'm sure I could drink a few if I let myself. At the time of this review I have had this beer three separate times over the span of a year. In that time, my opinion of this beer has dropped a bit. The first time would have been all 5's, but it's still an awesome porter."
"Not as rich or thick as the American porters of today but still a refreshing and flavorful beer. Drinks very well and has a nice English feel to it."
"O- A delicious and tasty porter, loses some points for the total absence of head, but is still a great beer."
"Conclusion: Another outstanding beer from Fuller's. I have yet to taste anything from this excellent brewery that isn't outstanding."
"O - Drinkability is fine, but not something I would go for that often. Was expecting more and came away disappointed."
"Pours a dark brown (coke like color) with a large mocha color head with decent retention. The smells are subtle I get some chocolate, some dark roasted malts, and a little nuttiness. Feel is medium to light. The taste is far better than expected with the weak smells, I get a little chocolate, a smoked flavor and some roasted malts with a light bitter after flavor, good stuff, a very nice porter."
"It’s a very smooth beer. The nitro version is more impressive, but most nitro versions are. This is still a good, full flavored porter."
"Roots"
"This is a medium bodied offering with a modest level of carbonation. This is quite a smooth and creamy offering to the feel. Quite easy drinking with seemingly no indication of alcohol outside of the estery alcohol flavors. Quite a solid example that tastes strangely similar to another popular famous english porter. A must try."
"Wow this is one of the top English Porters? Forget it, this makes me want more Olde Engine Oil.... Pass."
"D: A delicious, chocolatey porter worthy of sipping or sessioning; excellent example of the style."
"Pours a dark, dark brown (with some red creeping in at the bottom) with a creamy head that lingers. I get a lot of roasted malt and coffee on the nose, and, without surprise, I taste a lot of coffee when I first started drinking it. My initial reaction was that it tasted TOO much like coffee, but the other flavors started to creep in as the beer warmed. I started to detect a minute amount of bitter chocolate, with the coffee taste mellowing somewhat as the beer warmed. Roasty, yet smooth. A pleasant offering, although I admit I will probably won't give this beer its due because I'm not a coffee drinker."
"Overall- To be honest I was rather surprised by this one, I wasn’t expecting much from this one to be honest being in the form of a can, although Fuller does make some quality brews that I have recently really enjoyed. It is nothing over the top, like this is more of a classic porter taste as opposed to an off the wall different tasting porter that you can find a lot on the American market, but don’t get me wrong this is a quality porter and runs circles around your macro Guiness, Kilkenny, etc. This would be a go to for me when I am looking for a good porter to drink a couple of them for cheap in a night, although I did enjoy the double chocolate stout from young’s a lot more."
"Overall this is a great, if not perfect, example of an English porter. I really enjoyed the robust flavors and and the full mouthfeel/finish. I can only imagine this being better on cask or tap... especially in England. Nothing earth-shattering or flavor explosion, just very very good."
"Overall: It's a session beer for sure...just with character and kick! If you pike malts beers with dry finish and balanced flavors seek out this one!"
"The flavour is a bit less intense than I was expecting, but very balanced. It starts out with some slight roasty bitterness, that makes way for some sweet almost molasses-like flavours. The body is a little light for my liking, but this would make a delicious session ale."
"O- Not an amazing range of flavours nor a particularly rich mouthfeel. Everything is perfectly mixed though and drinkability is very good. A classy beer"
"Overall I love this beer. This is the ideal benchmark for what I think a porter should be. Beautiful full bodied flavor with wonderful chocolate and coffee notes. I recommend this to all. I gotta try to keep this on deck at all times."
"Overall a very good beer. One of the better porters I've had though I don't love the style."
"a robust offering"
"On my first drink I really noticed a coffee flavor that made itself known. By half way in the beer I didn't really notice it. To me that is the perfect amount of flavor - let's you know its there without over powering the beer. Incredible mouthfeel - perfeact level of creaminess. The Brits make some of the best beers in my opinion and this is up their with some of the best. Plus the packaging and name make you feel like royalty as you drink it."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink because it is well balanced, although I would prefer to sip this and savor its interesting flavors."
"Definatley a good beer though! Goes well with a CAO mx2 cigar."
"Poured a two finger head from a nitro can, decent retention - rich chocolate colour - off colour caramel head - smell of coffee and malt - taste of bitter choclate and some coffee with a refreshing bitter after taste - perfect mouthfeel - a little bitter, nice carbonation and a silky smooth finish - overall - outstanding porter and one of my top ten"
"O: I've had this beer on many occasion and it has never disappointed me. Good stuff!"
"O - One of the the better porters out there, and very availble. Certianly a keeper."
"Very chocolatey, but almost overpowers the beer itself, which I find a bit thin. I'd like it just a bit thicker, but definitely above average."
"This was one of the best porters I have had the pleasure of tasting."
"Overall: This is an exceptional porter, probably the best I've had. If I could find this in anything other than single bottles, I'd be buying more. A whole lot more."
"O: The bottle states ""Rich, Dark & Complex."" I completely agree with all of these adjectives and have to add flavorful, deep, bold, highly drinkable, brillant... I could go on, but I won't. This beer is a treat. Different than the American porters that I am used to, and maybe, just maybe, what all for those strive to be."
"O: Really nice, extremely drinkable, goes down easy."
"Overall: An excellent porter, and my second favourite of all time, behind only Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald."
"O: I love this beer. As good as Founders. Different with a bit more complexity. In my top 15-20 of all beers for sure!!!"
"Overall: This is a very understated and elegant Porter, yet executed unbelievably well. Wow, I am really impressed."
"Excellent balance of sweet and bitter, with a great blend of flavours. Rich, tasty and smooth - just like a good porter should be. Top notch, and well worth trying."
"Very nice easy drinking but very flavorful porter. Years of practice makes this perfect!"
"A solid offering. This would be a great one to sit down with on a cruddy fall day in London."
"O: Overall it tastes wonderful so that weighs very heavily with me. I would recommend this to people looking for a great porter."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English Porter."
"Wow! Waiting to try this one for a while. Pours a dark brown, yet can see through the glass, head had lots of lacing. Smells of roasted malts, dried fruits in syrup, coffee. Taste is balanced, has some char on the tongue, bitter coffee as well. Like I said, balanced, really flavorful yet all tastes are shared. Overall, my new favorite Porter!"
"Drinkable as hell, certainly one of favourite my beers."
"The feel of this beer is medium bodied and seems to be just the right size beer for this style. Never throwing you a curveball this beer is smooth and creamy"
"For drinkability it's right up there and as it should be for a classic British ale. So many flavors but none knock the drinker over the head."
"This is a great brew...its super dark and complex. Its also got such a rich mix of flavors that make it a great porter. I would certianly reach for it again."
"It pours a very nice black with ruby highlights along the edges of the glass and about a 3 finger mocha coloured head that dies down to a thin layer leaving little lacing. It smells awesomel lots of coffee and some dark chocolate sweetness. the taste is very similar to the smell lots of coffee and lots of dark chocolate and a very faint hint of hops in there as well. it has nice carbonation and a fairly heavy and sticky mouthfeel that coats the mouth with every taste. overall i think this is an amazing beer that i could enjoy anytime of day."
"It may be served a tad too cold. It may have just a tad too much gas. It may take too long to open out. But there's something splendid about this very very very very very very very dark red beer. Vanilla sweetness, mild blend roasts, slight vineous hop edge at the end. One of those beers that I pass the hours away with when in a Fuller's pub."
"This beer went down extremely easy. The mixture of roasted coffee and dark chocolate along with the hops makes for a smooth satisfying porter with a great lingering aftertaste. I'm looking forward to my next"
"World class porter. The slogan says it all ""Rich, Dark and Complex""."
"D-A great English porter that shines on nitrogen. An adult chocolate milkshake. I'll be back for another."
"The beer was dark brown with red highlights, the khaki colored head was thin and bubbly. Smells amazing, you get a lot of roasted coffee and chocolate along with a hint of molasses. When you take a sip you first notice some bitter coffee flavors, then some toasty, smokey notes and hints of bitter dark chocolate. The beer is light but full bodied, it has low but sharp carbonation and it leaves the mouth very dry. I'm glad the guy at Central Market recommended this one, it is truly a great porter."
"Great soft carbonation, body could be a little thicker though."
"DRINKABILITY: A solid, easy drinking, flavorful drink that I'd definitely buy again. Flavor could be enhanced by a slight increase in hops flavor."
"Nothing extreme but a very solid porter overall."
"Overall this was an EXCELLENT Porter with the flavors blended together so well that it created a very creamy and roasty brew that was a pleasure to drink..."
"M/D) Dry, chalky mouthfeel. Medium body, not much carbonation in the palate. Flavors are good and abv is fairly low, but the chalky mouthfeel hurts the drinkablility of this beer."
"My first offering from a brewery I should have tried before now. I would love the opportunity to try this on cask. Recommended."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, the beer is a dark, nutty brown color with a healthy, inch thick, mocha colored head. There is a nose of coffee, a little choco-toffee, and a littly earthy-nutty. The beer has a very smooth body, with coffee flavors right off the bat, bringing a decent amount of bitter to the beer. Other flavors are sweet to balance, including a slightly dark molasses taste. The beer is surprisingly light and smooth in mouth, and it leaves a great lacing on the glass as you drink it. Very light coffee aftertaste with chocolate highlights that diminishes very quickly. Great finish, nice and smooth, and this is a very tasty beer to drink that remains light and easy to consume."
"Great easliy found beer that Very good. When found on Cask it is AMAZING."
"Pours beautifully into a Fuller's pint glass. Creamy head with a light roasty malt and chocolately aroma. Flavor is similar. Nitro really helps get er done. Light chocolate notes, perhaps a touch of coffee, amazingly smooth and clean finish. One of my ultimate rainy day beers."
"Drinkability: There is something really malty, like a cream soda that keeps me sipping it over and over again. Great classic porter."
"D - I could drink alot of this on a cold night. Lovely balance, not too sweet and a complexity complimenting its abv. Fuller's never disapoints. I've had so many porters I hated because they are so hit or miss for me, so I really appreciate a well crafted one."
"Flavor is likewise pleasant but a bit too middle of the road. Smoked malt notes are quite notable and with just a hint of fruit piercing through. Solid feel, slightly viscous in nature and with a creamy finish. Drinkability is kept in check for me by the smoky but simple finish. Bottom line: Rich, check; Dark, check; Complex, I don't think so."
"OVERALL: Really good stuff. If it weren't for the overly unimpressive nose, this would be one worth writing home about. Lots of nice flavor, and it looked great for the style. One of my favorite English beers. Recommended."
"The CPJ"
"Pours a dark chestnut brown, with a solid 3 finger tan head. Sheets of lacing, with solid retention. Nose is equally as solid, caramel, dark and milk chocolates, light smoke (maybe some smoked meats) and some roastiness. Quite complex and mouthwatering. Starts off smooth and super silky on the palate, chocolate up front with some caramel sweetness, dark roasted coffee, a touch metallic before it warmed up a bit more. Mouthfeel was great, creamy and silky. Drinkability is awesome, an everyday porter and something that may become a staple in my fridge."
"Morey's Bottom Line: This particular bottle had a best by date of last month, but I'm a little let down by this beer. I would take an Anchor, SN, or Taddy over this in a heartbeat. That being said, it's still pretty decent."
"Drinkability - Creamy porter that is very easy to drink , the flavors of the coffee and roasted malts are blended together beautifully ."
"Overall this is one of my favorite porters. Very enjoyable and not overly difficult to find."
"A dark brown color with a thin khaki head. Bittersweet chocolate hits the nose with a bit of roast. Starts off with sweet malt, very full mouthfeel and finishes full of bittersweet chocolate. This has more chocolate and less coffee than most porters, but I don't see anything wrong with that! An outstanding beer that I will be looking out for."
"D- Pretty sessionable with consistent taste, I can drink a few pints of this."
"This beer is creamy and luxurious. A good example of a porter, even though I've had better I'm glad I got a sixer instead of singles."
"Pours a rich dark black opal with a nice brown head. Aroma of toasted caramel malt and roasted espresso and cacao. Tastes is toasted malts and espresso with some dark fruits and licorice notes. Palate is rich full body and smooth creamy mouth feel, with moderate carbonation. Finish is toasted caramel malt, dark plums, espresso ending with some lingering licorice and cacao. Overall a very nicely balanced and tasty porter."
"as far as porters go, this is good. would definitely drink again. nice sipper this Jan. evening as I watch The Dark Knight with a dark porter."
"Very smooth, easy to drink. Great classic example of the English porter style."
"D: This is tasty, has a nice feel, and is quite quaffable: all you can ask for from the style."
"It looks great in the glass; almost black with half an inch of head. The malts and hops stay with you and make you wanna pick up the glass again."
"I would have preferred it to be a bit sweeter like I remembered (it's probably just the age), but this is a very good beer nonetheless. Easy to drink and quite tasty."
"This is a very nice porter and certainly an extremely accessible go-to well worth stocking."
"One of the most approachable and drinkable porters that is out there today. Not bold, but just delicious. You cannot go wrong here."
"A superbly mild and sessionable beer. The first truly quaffable porter I think I've really encountered."
"What a cracking beer, a lovely example of what the English can do so well. A smooth and mild beer, with nuanced and subtle complexity that makes the experience worthwhile."
"Drinkability - This is a super easy drinking Porter. Very good and inviting. Worth a try and a great session brew. I could see myself having this on a cold night with some friends just relaxing. Actually, having several of these on a cold night just relaxing!!!"
"Pours out to a black body with a tan head that has good retention and solid tan lacing clinging to the sides of the beer mug. The smell is strong in chocolate with hints of coffee, roasted malts and a smoked flavor. The taste at first is chocolate followed by some coffee, some bitter hops, and roasted malts. The finishing taste is of smoked hickory and leaves a chocolaty aftertaste.This beer is also well balanced so it is not too bitter, but not to sweet either. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy that clings to the mouth, tongue, and cheeks. This is a really nice medium to full bodied beer with decent carbonation that would go good with dark chocolates, or as a good after dinner beer. Just be careful because once you have one I'm very sure you will want another."
"Overall this is a great beer. I love chocolate and this pairs exceptionally well with dark chocolate. One of the better porters I've had recently. Very full in flavor but smooth and balanced. Great Beer Fuller Smith & Turner PLC!!!!"
"D: This one had a really good flavor to it. I'm excited to hear this will be out in nitro-cans because the moutfeel and carbonation could use a little work. Overall pretty solid though."
"First sip and I was hooked, even slightly too cold. Dry and smashing the entirety of my mouth. Brilliant malt bill. Extremely drinkable, didn't realize I was going to be such a fan."
"Had this on tap at Local 44, despite not liking it last year. Must have had a bad one then, loved it this time around. Poured a dark, thick black with some red when the light htis, frothy cream head, great retention and lacing. Smell super roasty of malts and chocolate, coffee too, very sweet. Taste incredibly chewing, almost like biting into a steak, clings to the mouth with sweet mellow and roasty. Incredible beer."
"Dark dark brown in the pint glass with hints of red velvet when held up to the light. Head? None to speak of here. Some coffee in the nose but more chocolate, toffee and other sugars. Taste follows suit but the roasted coffee comes through more strongly here, and there's a detectable char in the finish. You'd think with low carbonation it would be much more creamy, but it ain't. I can immediately think of a handful of more accessible and superior porters."
"This just drinks so elegantly - bloody creamy and smooth, not heavy, but with enough weight that it sits a bit. Fairly dry finish, which begs frequent sips and multiple pints."
"Thought I would try this beer, my brother swears by it. Presented in a brown 11.2 ounce bottle. Pours out a very dark brown, nearly black. Rich smell of coffee and alcohol. Surprisingly carbonated mouthfeel, with a finish of coffee, slight taste of alcohol and dark chocolate. If there is any drawback to this beer, it is the carbonation. Overall this beer is pretty good. Recommended for those seeking a tasty porter that is not too intense; it is highly drinkable. Pairs quite well with Led Zeppelin."
"D: A solid example of the style. It's not my favorite porter, but I definitely recommend it."
"Drinkability is great. Overall this drink is one fine, rich, complex brew, and I recommend it to try it out. It's delicious and gets better as it warms up."
"Good Beer, It's got a very specific flavor that would really make you say either 'Yum!' or 'Ikkk'. I didn't like the flavor, too yeasty. Dar and rich just like they say but the flavor is just no good to my taste. Kinda like Marmite, if you know it."
"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle, with the ""best-by"" date and ABV on the label. Nice dark brown color with a reddish hue against light and an almost disappearing head which somehow doesn't want to disappear. Aroma is predominantly coffee, cocoa, chocolate, with a hint of caramel. Taste is again a beautiful blend of roasted coffee, malt and caramel with a nice touch of chocolate after-taste. Mouthfeel is excellent, silky smooth porter with very good lacing. Drinkability is exceptional, I can have it any time, any place. Highly recommended for all porter lovers. A must have !!!"
"Drinkabilty - I can see why its so highly rated. Its so easy to drink, and has alot of flavors going on. I prefer my porters to be sweeter, or baltic though, but none the less, this is good stuff"
"Overall - An excellent Porter! Probably the smoothest I've had in the style. This one pairs perfectly with some smoked sausage. If you see this, it's definitely worth buying."
"The label says it's ""rich, dark, and complex," and the beer certainly lives up to that. This is an outstanding beer, one of the best porters I've tasted."
"A grand English porter that brings just the right amount of flavours to give it a high drinkability. World class!"
"T&M: Coffee, roasted. Some peppery notes for the aftertaste. Quite watery as the most English Porters. Carbonation is between light and medium."
"D-its a pretty sessionable brew. its very easy to drink and the taste stays fairly well."
"D - Delicious and oh so complex. The bottled version is a good porter, but this draft is an incredible and world-class beer."
"This a fine English porter it is full of chocolate,syrup and coffee flavor. Its dark brown.Low carbonation and has a disappearing head. Very easy to drink.I like the design of the bottle. Reminds me another english beer(Old Nick). Yes I'd definitely buy more. Happy Drinking Thanks"
"D: All around decent beer. Not exactly ""impressive"" despite being the gold standard of porters."
"Pour is rootbeer colour, turning black once settled, foamy tan thick head. The nose is roasted malt, toasty dark chocolate & coffee. A thick and creamy mouthfeel, which is easy on the palatte and quite drinkable. Smooth coffee and cocolate taste, veyr well rounded. The beer seems well carbonated yet there is a subtle ""flatness"" to it which is unsettling and throwing me off a little. Picked it up because it was a top 100 but at this point I could pick a dozen more beers to me that would be more worthy, still, good enough."
"Pours a solid black with a nice cream colored tight head that stays. Smells strongly of chocolate, roasted notes, faint hops. Some lacing on the glass as its drank. Mouthfeel is medium thickness, mild carbonation, and creamy. Tastes of chocolate and burnt coffee working very well together, the hops aren't coming through too much for me other than adding the crispness at the end, but that isn't a complaint. Amazing flavor. Very happy I picked this can up on a whim without reading about it, what a great find."
"D - Good, but I feel like the drinkability could be improved by a little more hoppiness to eliminate that weird aftertaste."
"*from notes"
"great drinkability, classic example of the style."
"Aroma is that of coffee and chocolate. Malt also fills the nose. First taste is bitter chocolate and coffee finish. This beer really shows well when a little warmer, allowing many complex flavors to show trough. Overall very nice porter, great dark brown/red color. Recommend at least giving this one a shot, definitely well put together."
"By all means a very well-balanced porter."
"D. Good, easy drinking beer. I could, and did, have multiple pints at one sitting."
"On tap at the Barrowboy and Banker, London Bridge, half pint, dark mahogany colour, almost opaque, small fading tanned head, kept some lacing. Aroma was roasted coffee. Could taste raisins after an initial burst of coffee and toffee. Smooth, soft carbonation, body on the heavy side. Decent depth, beer for colder weather."
"Drinkability: Whatever hesitancy I had after seeing how it looked following the pour were overcome by the amazing aroma. A solid, flavorful drink that I would kill to try on cask."
"Drink well my friends"
"Pours a dark brownish brew with a thick creamy beige crown. Nice and inviting coffe and cocoa aromas, no alchol scent. Coffe beans hit strong at first sip, then it mellows down to a dark sweet chocolate medley with a taste very near the aroma. Nice round body with a pleasant mouthfull of coffe beans and chocolate ones. Great drinkability. This is one smooth english porter."
"The flavor is smoky, dry malt, choclat. The flavor is robust but at the same time tame. Very concise and the after taste is drier with all the sweet parts still present. Maybe even a bit of dark fruits beneath the whole profile. Overall a very drinkable and tasty porter."
"Notes: Easy to drink, rich, tasty, and complex. Flavors open up more as it warms. This would be great as a dessert beer, but can certainly stand on its own as well. This is the quintessential English Porter, and a real treat to drink."
"D: Easy drinking porter. Tastes like another, which is a bit rare for me with porters."
"drinks well. not robust, but there is some flavor there. won't be a regular, but I would drink again."
"D- Absolute classic! Much more than an after dinner beer! I could enjoy this all day!"
"D - A classic example of the style. Something I'd drink lots of. Was so happy to find it here."
"Fuller's London Porter is a deep dark brown with a thin tan khaki head. Aroma was a minimal with a little roasted malt, but not too much, although this is certainly due to the very low carbonation. The flavor is dominated by bittersweet chocolate, caramel, a touch of coffee with a clean dry finish. The beer was smooth and carbed appropriately low."
"I love everything about this beer, except that I wish it was thicker."
"D - A tasty porter, but I've had better. It was flavourful, but a little too metallic for my liking. I'm inclined to think that this bottle may have been too aged and was on the verge of turning sour. I will have to try it again to see if it was just the bottle. Worthy to any porter fan, but don't expect to be blown away!"
"drinkability: I think its very drinkable. I think its a good beer to get if your just getting into stouts or porters. But still enjoyable for all the porter and stout fans."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with slightly below average carbonation. Drinkability is good, it had some great flavors to it and the balance really helps it too. A very easy drinking, smooth and flavorful beer overall. A classic example of the style."
"D: High. This is a fantastic beer. Really recommended"
"Delicious and so damn chocolaty, this classic stands up quite handsomely in a can and is a welcome addition to Fuller's ranks."
"Sweet with a lot of good caramel and chocolate flavor. This beer packs a good amount of flavor for its size. There's caramel, chocolate, roast and light fruitier malt touches in the aroma. The flavor is dominated by caramel and chocolate. There's a bit of herbal hopping in there, maybe. It's just a bit too sweet, ultimately. The flavors verge on candy bar, which is meant less negatively than it reads. I think my scores would go up with a stronger mouthfeel. It seems a little thin, and a full creamy feel would go a long way with this beer. I would definitely enjoy trying it from a cask. Appearance-wise, it's dark brownish-ruby with a relatively thin and dissipating beige cap."
"11.2 ounce bottle. This one pours black with the consistency of a cola. Full 1 inch head that's nicely tan in appearance with a creamy and bubbly head. Looks gorgeous, if it's any consolation. Deep, rich, woodsy smell with mahogony and chocolate. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel. Roasted malt reminds me more of a dark coffee (think Sumatra if you've ever had it) than anything else. Nice clean bitterness in the finish. Hop character lends a nice amount of earthy notes to the whole affair. Overall a very enjoyable porter and a nice night cap to my Labor Day."
"Drink - An outstanding beer that I will buy again and again."
"Overall, a very solid porter. Flavors are perfectly balanced and rich but not over-the-top. A must have for porter lovers."
"D- rolls off the tongue"
"Near black pour with just faint hint of mahogany highlights and a big, frothy, tan head. The aroma smells like malted chocolate milk with a fair amount of roast and a hint of coffee. The malted chocolate milk flavor really continues through from the aroma with a few notes of coffee, brown sugar and dark fruit. The body is a bit on the thin side but has a nice creaminess to it and soft carbonation."
"Great flavors and easy drinking, all the flavors are subtle yet this is a great porter to sit down with. It's balanced and interesting and fairly smooth. The slight sour finish just added an extra dimension that wasn't overdone and enjoyable."
"Pours dark ruby with a nice thin beige head that retains nicely. One of the best smelling porters I've come across. Nutty, roasty and chocolate. creamy mouthfeel. Great coffee taste and roasted tones. Vanilla bean and bittersweet chocolate make their presence known. Full body."
"Too pricey ($6) for a relatively unenjoyable drinking experience. Love porters, but not this one."
"Absolutely brilliant! Pours from the bottle a very dark with ruby highlights when held up to a light, with a frothy tan head that head that lasts about 3 minutes. Aromas are predominately of sweet malts, with roasty notes taking a back seat. Strong toffee and slightly less intense chocolate aromas hit me first; I also detect notes vaguely reminiscent of hazelnut coffee. Taste-wise, the front and mid-palate are very evenly balanced between these sweet and bitter elements. Finishes long on with a tasty toffee character. Medium-light body with moderate carbonation feels smooth through and through. Intensity-wise, it's flavors are not strong enough to pair with chocolates, but, when had all its own, this is one of my very favorite beers."
"The palate is smooth and chewy but could be creamier. Drinks amazingly."
"Beer is medium body, mildly sweet. Minimal coffee in the back of the mouth with decent bitterness. Beer is quite sessionable but there is an unfortunate aftertaste of ashiness that I do not find that desirable. Its a minor problem but it does detract from the mouthfeel of the beer."
"Drinkability: The rich, chocolate-espresso taste is nicely balanced by the bite on the finish. The result is a complex flavor that can only truly be experienced slowly."
"M: Enjoyable creamy body with a lasting ending, a little too bitter."
"D: The expense is the only barrier to this being a perfect session beer."
"Overall, quite drinkable. Not an overpowering dark beer."
"This is almost as good as it gets. It has its own very unique character and it's a beer you'll return to over and over again. I'm not sure why, but it somehow feels stronger than it really is."
"D: Nice porter. A bit drier than other Porters I've had (interesting)."
"Mild aroma of roasty chocolate malts. Mild carbonation and a nice thick and creamy mouthfeel with prominent chocolate, biscuit, and coffee notes. A bit of caramel sweetness on the finish makes this one very pleasant and easy-drinking -- tasty to the end!"
"Drinkability - This beer is a meal in and of itself. It's smooth and easy to drink, but don't plan on spending a whole night with this beer. It's still a treat for the night you're wanting something dark!"
"A very well balanced porter! I like it a lot. at 5.4% ABV, this is a highly drinkable beer. I would not mind buying this again."
"D - Wow! This has gotta be one of my favorite Porters, I absolutely love the intense smokey flavor & aroma, it's what Ive been seeking for a long time. This beer is so damn good! I could easily drink 4 pints of this fantastic brew, I highly recommend this one and can't wait to have it again. Cheers!"
"Easily a recommended brew in this style."
"The first every porter I tried and still my favorite English style porter. Pours your standard dark brown color with tan head. I absolutely love the nose on this beer. It smells like brewing dark beers with that huge roast and chocolate maltiness. There are just enough bittering hops to prevent it from being too sweet. They start on the front of the tongue and fade to the huge roasty, chocolate malt flavors. Just a fantastic lingering finish to it."
"Very drinkable, and can see why this is rated so highly. Detected some alcohol around halfway through. This was really nice with a piece of chocolate torte, but this would be great on it's own."
"12oz. bottle served in my SA Perfect Pint. 16/AUG/10 indicated on the back label. Perfect pour - entire bottle into the glass with the head neatly falling between the blue lines and the lip of the glass. Body was the color and clarity of cola with a rocky, tan-colored head that sizzled and popped as it slowly receded into a sudsy skim, leaving tiny spots of lacing in its wake. Big roasty, chocolatey, malty nose from the bottle, with a slightly metallic quality coming out in the glass. Taste consistent with nose, with a some lactose and a bit of char in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively carbonation and a somewhat creamy texture. What a delicious porter - some qualities seem to slightly mirror a milk stout (i.e. the creaminess, lactose, chocolatey goodness), but the charred character brings it all back, resulting in a highly drinkable and flavorful porter."
"It's only 5.4 ABV, but it feels stronger. The flavor mix is very robust, this beer really has character!! I highly recommend to drink it slowly, otherwise it's kind of heavy on you. Also, you might want to pair it with some bitter chocolate!!"
"I will make this a staple considering I can only get the great lakes when I'm up in Ohio. This stuff is scrumptious!"
"Drinkability: Very drinkable. I finished this one fast, but I do wonder if everything above would be a hair higher in intensity/goodness if I had gotten one of these fresh. I easily would have had another if it was available. Drinkable by itself or with a meal - but a meat and potatoes sort of meal."
"It is much better in the bottle then it is from the can."
"A very solid English Porter I will buy again."
"Pours a dark burgundy/brown with little to no head, though my pour was pretty weak. The smell reminded me a lot of Kahlua. It's a mixture of sweet coffee, vanilla, and chocolate. The sweetened coffee is the most prominent taste followed by slightly bitter chocolate and touches of vanilla. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of this. I'd really like this to be thicker, but that's a common theme for me. This is something I could sit down and drink in multiples."
"D-Really, really easy drinking, delcious and complex porter. I'll be sure to revisit this one."
"The beer had a slightly lighter medium feel to it, not heavy but not light either, and this gave the beer very good drinkability. Very much what I expected from an English-style porter and I could have drank a few more. A very good beer."
"D: This beer smells much better than it actually is. Nice feel and good complexity but the nose builds up the character so much that I feel like when I actually get to the beer, its a bit of a let down. Still, worth trying as it is a solid porter with a sweet twist that one seldom comes across."
"Found at M'Coul's in Greensboro, NC, this one shows a deep dark brown mohogany color with a goodly light oatmeal colored head and good lacing. The aroma is of roasted nuts and molasses malt, deep and delightful. The flavor offers thick charcoal nuttiness and malt sweetness with clear grassy hop bitterness. This is decidedly mid-plus bodied, smooth with modest carbonation. Very drinkable and definitely worth a try, a very solid porter."
"i've had this previously in cans and remember the canned version being just a bit better, especially in the mouthfeel. went through a case in a little over a week during christmas break! i'll have to find more cans and do a comparison."
"Porter one of my favorite styles, picked up this one in a 500 ml can, let's give it a whirl. Following the instructions on the can, I'm having this one after dinner. Popping the top this brew smells like chocolate and black licorice. Pours to a jet black with a thin tan head. On the taste there is lots of well roasted malt, some dark chocolate and a smooth bitterness. Mouthfeel is nice and thick almost chewy but not syrupy. Finish is a bit metallic with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Not as tasty as an American porter in my book but for an English porter it hits the mark. Very drinkable."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a khaki head. The aroma is chocolate with some dark fruit, roasted malt, coffee and some English hops. The flavor is similar. Roasted malts with some earthy hops along with some bready malts and sweet chocolate. Not much coffee in the flavor. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"D: Very drinkable, this is basically the definition of English Porter, really well done."
"D - this could most surely be an 'all nighter'."
"Can't complain about the drinkability factor either. Goes down real smooth. I would certainly have another, or two, or three? Maybe a bit heavy for a session, but, hey, I'd rather sip and enjoy this one slow anyways. Man this stuff is tasty. I was excited about trying this beer and it really lived up to the hype."
"D: Not nearly the best porter I've ever had. Definitely prefer the ESB and the 1845 to this. Overall, a good English brew."
"Drinkability: The first beer was somewhat rough, as I'm not a huge fan of the chocolate, but the beer definitely improved as I worked on the 2nd and 3rd. A good 6-pack beer for the night if your looking for something with a little more love put into it."
"D:Very drinkable and could be a favorite with any beef influenced meal mine waas with a pot roast, and a very good pairing in my mouth."
"Cheers!"
"Carbonation is perfect, with a smooth, if slightly thin body. Drinks very easily, would be happy to spend an evening with this one."
"D - Very easy to drink and a perfect example of what a porter should be. Definitely worth seeking out."
"Fuller's London Porter is an icon, so it's no surprise it is a good beer. I have to admit that I don't love it, but I do like it."
"D: Very easy and smooth going down. Tasty as hell. I would highly recommend this one to porter lovers."
"Well balanced between roasted grain, chocolate, and mild coffee. Smooth mouthfeel that could use a bit more umph. Easy to drink, easy to session. Nice all around beer but it lacks the ""wow"" factor."
"Pours a dark brown with a nice head. Good head retention with lacing down the glass. Smells of chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. The taste starts with coffee and the roasted malt and I can notice the chocolate a bit more in the aftertaste. There is also some sweetness of almost a caramel flavour too. This feels almost as smooth as a glass of milk. I frequently go back to this as it is the porter to which I judge all others."
"Poured a dark brown, almost black, but had a very quick dissipating head and remained non-existent for the life of the beer. Additionally, there was very little to no lacing on the glass. The smell is that of roasted chocolate, a hint of espresso and malts. The initial taste of the beer is that of burnt/roasted chocolate, paving the way for the coffee, espresso, and roasted/burnt caramel malt. The carbonation in this brew seems weak and barely any bubbles are seen half way through drinking this beer. This is without a doubt a beer I will purchase again."
"Notes: Nice drinkable porter that has a good balance of flavors. A very nice example of a porter, not an amazing beer, but a solid choice that I would gladly drink again."
"An excellent beer."
"I could see myself drinking a bunch of these. Really nice flavor."
"Just a fantastic English porter, everything reminded me of very rustic elements, but in a very good way, almost nostalgic. I could drink this beer forever."
"Medium bodied, but enough prickly carbonation to keep this from being overly cloying or even mouth coating. Drinks lighter than it is, and is very easy to put down. Nothing overdone or out of balance on this one, and no off flavors at all. Another one of those beers that makes you wonder why you don't drink this more often (too much choice out there I guess). A good reminder that this beer needs to get revisited often."
"Mouthfeel appropriate for the style. Quite drinkable."
"Blackish brown in colour with sharp ruby hues, a finger of tan head, and dots of lacing. Smell and taste are dark chocolate, roasted malt, raisins, toffee, cream, and a mild hop bitterness that resembles an English pale. Burnt grains and ash in the finish, very subtle. After a few sips, I get some nuts and molasses on the nose. Mouthfeel is rich, smooth, and chocolaty, on the full side of medium-bodied. This has much less dryness and roast than your typical porter, but that's not a bad thing. A tasty drinker from a brewer that never disappoints."
"D: Very drinkable, but it gets kind of gluey and metallic in the late stages of aftertaste."
"D - This is a superb brew on any occasion."
"Drinkability- a very nice session brew, its not to heavy but not to light either, its certainly up there with some of my favorite porters, its a boat load more complex then the taddy porter but there is something about the extreme drinkability of the taddy that brings me back to that too but this is what I would go for if I was something a little more complex to sip a little slower, a fine offering from a fantastic brewery"
" The roasted barley tastes are first and foremost in the taste. Fairly sweet with just a bit of bitterness from the roast. A bit of a coffee aftertaste. The carbonation is just a little harsh for the style , IMO. Sweet, medium-bodied, and ridiculously smooth; this porter is delightfully drinkable."
"D: Not the best tasting porter I've ever had, but the smoothness of the cask version is, simply put, amazing. Give this one a try regardless, but especially if you have a chance to taste the cask version."
"D - this is a beer that you don't mind having another of."
"I went through a Fullers/Sammy Smith/Youngs kick a few years back. I remembered that this was a wonderful beer, but...DAMN! I love Taddy Porter, but this has to be the best English Porter out there. A layer of caramel over a layer of cocoa atop a layer of roasted pecans. Nice fruity bitterness on the finish. All the creamy, smooth deliciousness you could ask for in a beer. A liquid lesson in beer history."
"Overall, I can see why this receives the top rating it does on BA. For an English ale, it's intense yet balanced without being too overpowering. I could consume at least three of these in a row and probably come back for a fourth or fifth. A highly session-able and complex beer. Cheers Fuller's!"
"better head than the bottle. good dark brown colour. abundant dark roasted malts with a strong dark chocolate backbone, a little coffee behind the chocolate with even less caramel notes in the far back. the taste is a close version of the nose. initial notes are coffee and some maltiness; there is also some caramilzed sweetness in the elusive midground."
"Currently my favourite English dark ale. Hope it comes in cask somewhere nearby."
"Dark, clear rosewood with amber highlights and a whipped, dense head of fine cream colored head that leaves silky sheets of blonde lace on the glass. The nose is roasty and rich with dark chocolate, coffee and a touch of vanilla bean. Nice roasted malty flavors with cocoa and black coffee. Silky smooth and medium light bodied with mild carbonation. This is by far the best ""pub can"" offering I've ever had."
"D-pretty drinkable very strong taste not too heavy definately sessionable and while it seems a bit light in the mouth it is as the bottle says rich, complex, and dark and not over the top"
"D - Not my favourite style of beer but I still found it pretty drinkable."
"D: Not bad, I prefer the non nitro version to this. This is good, but just not that great. Tasty none the less."
"D: Overall this is a very nice, even a world-class English Porter. Not that I'm saying anything new about the beer. I'd love to be able to get this on cask one day."
"Drinkability: this is one smooth, delicious porter. I will have to find a regular source for this, as it is simply wonderful."
"The body is moderate to light. Would like a touch more depth but still good. Overall, the black marker thing is off setting. I know I am sensitive to it so leave it at that."
"It felt thin and light on the tongue with a bitter aftertaste. Good, not all that noteworthy, just a plain old porter."
"Certainly drinkable (not bad, not good) and if I ever find myself in an English pub and this was on cask, I would probably order a pint to see. Otherwise, not really my cup of tea."
"Notes: I had a 4 oz. sample of this at a beerfest awhile back which really blew me away. It doesn't seem as amazing having a full bottle of it, but I can still see why it's a benchmark for English porters. I think my sample was from a nitro-can; I'll have to check this beer out in that format."
"This beer is pretty drinkable, even for someone like me who'd much rather have two IPAs back to back rather than two Porters or Stouts. I could put back a few of these in a sitting. This is definitely a beer I will be returning to in the future."
"I could drink these all night."
"D- A good drinkable beer."
"D: It's tasty, but I don't find this to be all that special."
"Molasses or rasiny color with a very moderate and short lived head. Fizzles away rather quickly, leaving a nice amount of lacing. Aroma is roasted and a tad bit sour. Lots of dark malts in there. Flavor is also well roasted, slightly sour, almost in a dark chocolate way. Stands well on its own or would certainly go well with any red meat. Lasting aftertaste and lighter body than one would imagine."
"D - I'm having trouble finding places to mark down with this beer. This is a drinkable well balanced delightful beer."
"Drinkability is high, an exceptional sample!"
"D: This would go great with a whiskey marinaded beef dish, a chocolate tort or plate of bittersweet chocolates and is very serviceable on its own. A very rich and malty brew, and at 5.4%, this classic English porter is just what the doctor ordered for a winter brew sit-in. Quite nice indeed."
"Pours dark brown/black, ruby glint in the light. Good retention with sticky tan foam. Smells a little oxidized, papery, weak coffee roast. Flavor is a little too much on the sweet side, roasty malt notes dominate. In the finish there's a distinct raisin/prune note. The coffee element is like weak instant maxwell house. Feel is smooth and slick, the sweetness borders on unpleasant though. Didn't really want to finish this. Will amend review with a fresher sample when I find one."
"Fuller's London Porter is a dark brown ale with a cappucino colored head that leaves foam all over the glass. It has an aroma like toffee-- but not too sweet. It smells roasty, like chocolate, coffee and baked goods. here's an earthy twang to it that's unambiguously English. It's medium-light bodied and quite smooth. he finish is ever-so-slightly chalky. It's not that sweet on the tongue, really. It's chocolatey and slightly bitter. It's perfectly balanced. It's a bit grassy and almost umami. Very classic; very drinkable."
"One of the few solid choices available at my hometown rural northern Ontario LCBO. Will likely be picking up a few more of these over the next few weeks of Christmas holidays"
"D - Very drinkable. Flavorful enough to be interesting, but not overpowering or cloying. I think this would be a good intro beer for people who've never had a porter or a really dark beer, but it's still good enough to satisfy an experienced beer geek. I might pick myself up a six-pack if I ever spot one."
"no reason not to drink this beer try it if you have a chance"
"Reviewed on 8/21/09. 16 oz. can. Pours black with a thick, creamy light tan head. Aroma of sweet chocolate malts. Flavor of the same chocolate malts, sweet crystal malts, a touch of hops. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Kind of bland overall, just a boring porter."
"Has depth and flavor but is still sessionable as all Jimminey. Just one of those perfect beers. Beats out Mayflower and Sam Smith's for the best English porter I've had to date."
"Mouthfeel is silky smooth and as a result it goes down well. I could easily session these. Once again Fullers delivers another great product."
"d-the subtlety of this brew make it a easy drink..nothing over the top but a decent solid porter..can think of a few i would rather have..but this is good in a pinch"
" Huge taste and thick texture, highly drinkable,All the good traits of a porter, chocolate/coffee, smells great. my wife is not the biggest porter fan and she loved it."
"One of my all-time favorite Porters and still my personal benchmark for English Porters. The overt chocolate character just can't be beat."
"I like this beer, and I want to love it, but it just seems slightly too much on the roastiness over a prolonged period. I will definitely buy it again, and would recommend it to friends, but the lighter body mixed with the heavy coffee/burnt flavors keep it a notch below excellence for me."
"D-Superb."
"D - full of flavors, smells, and textures...but highly drinkable. serve this at the suggested temperature as all the good stuff really opens up. good enough to almost make me want to watch soccer."
"What I liked a/b this one: smooth, virtually carbonation, slightly sweet, highly drinkable."
"I've had this beer many times and am finally reviewing it. Definitely shows a great example of a superior English Porter. A little less burnt and roasty than the American style I am used to. Sweeter as well. A lactic presence. Chocolate outweighs the coffee, but there is some bitter coffee towards the end and in the aftertaste. Maybe even a small amount of dark fruit mixed in there. Don't hesitate on this one."
"Along with Sierra Nevada's porter, this ranks as one of my favorites. Immensely quaffable and interesting, this is ideal for any season."
"Overall a full flavored and full bodied porter."
"Excellent porter, one of the best I've had in quite a spell. I'll be on the hunt for another bottle here in the States to see if this is really as good as I recall or if the ESB & soccer had clouded my good judgment."
"D: A very nice porter, sessionably quaffable. I've had this from a regular tap and bottle, but really enjoy it from the nitro-can best...better yet, I'll search for it on cask! Epitomizes what an English Porter ought to be: rich and roasted malt, chocolate-y aroma, moderate ABV that makes having a couple almost requisite. Alas, I have but one. Recommended."
"Dark brown color with a small tan head with poor retention. Smells of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. The taste is the same as the smell, with hints of molasses present. Medium mouthfeel, creamy, and high carbonation. A very good example of how an English Porter should taste. Very good drinkability."
"Dark brown thick viscous liquid with a brown head. Aroma is coffee, malt and dark fruit. Taste is rich, with chocolate and malt with a full finish and a dry mouthfeel. Quite the porter, I really enjoyed this. Although Fuller's rarely does anything wrong!"
"M&D: Creamy and smooth, very very sessionable and drinkable."
"Maybe one of the best roasted malts youll ever find... very classy beer and very well balanced"
"D : Yes, very much"
"F: Finishes not too long but the creamy chocolate hangs around at any part of the mouth it can hide. Stays light on abv and bitterness, but has a nice stouty taste. Light but rich and easy drinking."
"D - A real winner on cask draught. Great as a sessional, not too heavy and full of flavour. Fantastic as well in cans; well worth picking up!"
"D: A delicious English porter from Fuller's. Rich roasted chocolate flavor makes for a very nice beer. Full-bodied, tasty, and almost perfectly balanced and clean for the style. Definitely worthwhile."
"D- A great session beer. I could definitely drink a couple of these any given night."
"D= very drinkable if you like dark stuff, and even if you don't then you'll probably find new enlightenment from this beer."
"Overall, a solid offering from Fuller's. As stated on the can, this is an excellent after-dinner drink. Nothing is too overpowering, making this a pleasant porter to drink."
"D - Very good porter and another very good beer from Fullers."
"- Very drinkable and good. Perfect for the style. Which more American Porters/Stouts were like this."
"M/D - Very smooth and creamy on the palate. Not too heavy, really drinkable."
"D = This is a very drinkable beer which is interesting since it has pretty strong flavors."
"D: Well, I did an unusual thing (for me) and had a second glass of the same beer. 'Nuff said."
"Highly drinkable porter!"
"I had it bottled."
"Pours the darkest of browns, clear where there's opacity with an opaque center. A dense two finger nitro head tops the dark body. The nose is subdued but pleasant; milk chocolate and nougat, burnt toast and light fruitiness. The taste is much bolder though still mellow, opening with a pleasant chocolate and toffee sweetness, leading into a surprisingly dry, bitter and roasty fnish. Medium-bodied, nearly flat in the usual nitro-tap fashion but quite creamy. I put down a couple pints of this in less than an hour and could've gone for another, time permitting. One of my favorite English porters, I'd love to try this on hand pump some time."
"I love porters and this is a good'un!"
"This beer pours a dark brown,cherry colour with ruby highlights and average carbonation that leaves a one finger head with sporadic lacing,the aroma is roasted chocolate,coffee malts very nice,it has above average mouthfeel with a nice smooth thinnish mocha start that finishes with a little dose of hops but not bitter at all once again this is a great example of the style and so perfectly balanced out i can see why this was the drink of choice all those years ago and would recommend this beer to those who like a nice uk porter."
"Drinkability: An understandable classic. The taste and the feel of this porter are world class, and the potency and fullness of the flavours at just 5.4% ABV are phenomenal. The easy in which it goes down is a worry, like most good beers are."
"An aggressive pour leaves me with a thin layer of tan head over a black body. The body shows ruby highlights when held to the light. It has a deep roasted malt aroma of chocolate and coffee. It tastes of dark chocolate, black coffee, and blackstrap molasses. Bittersweet. Finishes long, with a lingering aftertaste of dark roast coffee. Medium bodied with almost flat carbonation - very smooth and creamy. It's substantial, but not overly heavy. I could drink a few of this delicious English porter, and would be more than happy doing so."
"This is a great example of the style, rich yet refreshing and oh so easy to drink"
"On tap at the Elephant & Castle in Boston. Served in an Imperial pint glass. Dark, rich brown color. Thin white head. Roasted dark chocolate malt smell. Taste nailed what I think a porter should be. Roasted malt, cocoa, licorice, hint of vanilla, and just a bit of smoke all rolled onto the palate. I loved the mouthfeel of this beer. Smooth and creamy, yet hearty at the same time. But, very drinkable and a moderate abv % level. This should be considered a classic example of a British porter."
"Drink: If you want flavor, specifically smoky, rich flavors, this is one excellent porter. I can definitely see drinking a few of these at the pub."
"Simply a wonderfully complex beer--exceptional!"
"I'd drink this beer over and over again. A beer you should buy. Although it's a bit pricey."
"drinkability - great - i would rather drink this beer then some light pales on a hot summer day"
"D- This is so drinkable I can't believe. I feel like I could drink a whole sixer of this. Please, If you haven't tried this one yet, go get it for real. You won't be dissapointed."
"This beer is exemplary in questioning the notion of drinkability. Would you drink more than one in a sitting? Like any porter, probably not. Would I want to? Yes. Will I buy more? Hell yes. I am excited to try this beer again and sample more from the Fuller stable."
"Overall, a great beer. I've had others of the same style that perhaps have a bit more character, but this is amongst the most balanced and drinkable Porters that I've had. I'd recommend it as a great introduction to the style."
"D- good english stuff, very enjoyable and easy to drink."
"The mouthfeel came off a little light and felt a bit watered down. Started off creamy but the carbonation completely disappeared by about halfway through. Altogether this was a very good porter. The initial aroma was very pleasing and my only real complaint about this one was the mouthfeel being a little too light."
"D: The smoothness and low carbonation make this an easy one to quaff."
"I miss my beer drinking friend a great deal. Its just not the same."
"D-Beyond drinkable--->Full of flavour yet ""light""! How can this be? Super smooth and absolutely poundable. A near perfect example of the cask delivered English Porter...this is my benchmark!"
"A creamy texture despite a relatively watery body for a porter. Low ABV of 5.4% (for an English porter) drinks well, but a little too light-bodied. Has a nice balance and a little cherry and plum on the back end, which, combined with the minimal carbonation, make the beer a touch sour, but finishes well."
"D - Good!"
"Overall, I did feel this beer was quite drinkable for a multitude of reasons, although there was definitely room for improvement. I would happily enjoy another and hope to have one in its homeland sometime in the near future."
"This porter is easy to drink and somewhat light-ish bodied, but still has a velvety, creamy, full-flavored texture. Great balance of sweet, roasty malts and toasty and hop bitterness. Just a touch of dark fruitiness enters the palate as the beer warms. Makes a great party sixer as it never gets boring and can easily be sipped (or gulped) all night. Fantastic, well balanced beer."
"This ale is expensive. But you get what you pay for. I will buy this one repeatedly."
"D - I like porters. This one falls toward the middle of my list of favorites. I say that because it didn't blow me away. I would drink it again over and over."
"Carbonation is abundant but not overdone. The bubbles are small and prickly, and together with the sweet malty flavor, they make for a soft, velvety mouthfeel. A very drinkable beer, a little different, great take on a great beer style."
"D - Fortunately, the roast malt finish is fleeting otherwise this would be an oppressive beer. As it is, there is no lingering bitterness, making this an extremely drinkable beer."
"D: highly enjoyable porter that doesn't try to do too much. Picks a classic style and executes to perfection. Simple flavors and low ABV make it easy to order another."
"Very good drinkability in that it has a lot of flavor but it isn't overwhelming. Very enjoyable porter."
"D - Drinking a 500ml can is no problem - the roastiness never gets out of hand and the ABV is pretty forgiving. This is one of the best options that is always available at the LCBO."
"D - Easy drinking beer, flavors are well integrated and not overbearing. ABV is manageable. Roasted malts due become a bit tiring."
"This is simply an outstandin porter however you have it."
"Drinkability is high. The ABV is easily managed making for a more sessionable beer. The flavor profile is quite nice as well making it easy to sit back and enjoy this British pint. Can't believe I let this sit on the store shelf so long before taking one of my own home."
"D: In my book, porters should have the malty flavors of a stout with the drinkability of a pale ale. Fuller's London Porter has both, and drinks easier than your average pale ale. This is a highly drinkable, flavorful beer that I will definitely be seeking out again."
"Taste is really out of this world. Rich with chocolate and real ale taste but not fruity like a lot of other American porters which keeps it a little more quaffable and unique. Not overly bitter at any point during the beer from either hops or roasted malt. Just amazing balance."
"D--This just doesn't do it for me, it's solid but I don't really care to have any more"
"D: This is a session beer, I could sit down to several pints of this easily. Tasty and downright quaffable."
"This is may be the best porter I have tried. This next to a Samuel Smiths would be interesting."
"That said, it's a great beer and I guess sometimes not having much to say about a beer is a good thing."
"Pours a very dark brown. There is very little head on it dispite my hard pour (felt little bit of a let down). I do remember this having a bigger head on draft so maybe it was something in the bottle or perhaps I poured it shitty. Smells like coffee and a lot of roasted malt. Tastes very strongly of roasted flavors, coffee like bitterness, and very dark chocolate. These mix with a very strong metallic/earthy hop flavor to make a very interesting porter. This is definitely something to have again. Went very well on a rainy day."
"Pours a deep brown that has mahogany edges with a creamy light tan head. Aroma is full of milk chocolate, vanilla and a dash of coffee. The flavor has dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, some coffee and nuttiness but its smooth. Its a medium-bodied beer that is slightly chewy but its definitely an easy drinker. This is a classy beer, extremely drinkable and would love to try this on-tap."
"Recommended to me by men online. Very pleasing, but certainly not my favorite beer or style of beer. VERY smokey."
"London Porter's a very solid English Porter. If you're looking for a pretty flavorful beer that's easy to toss back, you've come to the right place. To be honest, it's not quite as good as I expected. I anticipated more flavor, depth, and character. But, it's a pretty well put together beer for the style. Perhaps I'm just not the biggest English Porter fan. Well worth checking out in any event."
"D: I was surprised at the differences between the canned and bottled versions of this beer. Both are great Porters. Relatively low ABV makes it easy to have another. I will be visiting this again."
"The complexity really isn't there, but hint of smoke, molasses, earthy and floral hops are enough to keep me interested, and the dry, husky finish keeps it drinkable. Solid effort."
"I could drink this beer all night, delicious and highly drinkable. Stellar beer."
"Poured into my nonic Imperial pint glass. Appears a deep, dark chestnut color with about an inch of creamy ecru foam that lingers for a bit, leaving behind minimal lacing. A great looking pour(sorry, I drink with my eyes first and foremost). Smells and tastes of milk chocolate, bittersweet cocoa, frsh, rich coffee beans, and caramelized malts. Nice! A notch or two above medium in both body and carbonation. Every lover of porters needs to check this one out."
"Pouring into a pint glass results in a jet black ale with a bit of head that evaporates quickly, leaving minor lacing on the glass. Smell is very slight, but contains some mocha hints. Taste starts out bitter with some medium roasted coffee flavor, but evolves into more chocolaty than coffee flavor. Slightly dry, but very drinkable overall. I would probably save it for after a meal, instead of a complement to one, like a post-dinner coffee or chocolate."
"M&D--Mouthfeel's ultra smooth and creamy, medium-bodied. The flavor's are big so the drinkability gets cut down a bit, but a couple pints of this are like nothing. Try it with dessert, as I did--you won't be disappointed!"
"Poured a deep brown/black color. Completely opaque. Tons of burnt coffee aroma eminating from the glass. Little to no head, no lacing present. Very little carbonation to speak of but I suppose thats to style. This beer as a pretty decent body and goes down smooth. Of all the porters I've tried, this is about middle ground. Very drinkable due to low ABV and I could probably drink a few of these happily."
"Dark brown almost black. Large two finger light tan head. Some sheet lacings. Aroma is cocoa malts. Taste is burnt brown sugar molasses dark chocolate and a touch of vanilla. Medium dry bitter finish. Silky on the tongue. Easy drinker leaves you wanting more. Carbonation is minimal but that seems to be typical for British beers."
"Final Thoughts - Got this one from ludachris, all in all, quite good. I wouldn't call it truly exceptional, but for the most part a solid offering. I can see why my brother swears by this stuff. I'd like to see instead of Guinness on tap, without a doubt."
"D- In the realm of a sessionable beer with enough flavor to keep the good times rolling. I probably will never attempt to drink this from a bottle after having it this way. Smooth and silky with a stand out roasted character to itself. Would love to try this with some dark meats to go along with it. One of my favorites from the u.k."
"I'm sure if you ask around a lot of people might tell you that Fuller's London Porter is what turned them onto dark beer; it certainly isn't hard to acquire a taste for gratifying, bittersweet flavours like these. Nor is it hard to acknowledge the fullness and satisfaction you have come an empty glass. Fuller's calls their London Porter ""the world's finest"" which may be an exaggeration, but not by much..."
"This is a paragon for the style - a slick, smooth as silk operator, and deftly commendable as a cold-weather sipper, though worthy of a go anytime you might come across it, I would put forth."
"D: A very good porter with a well-rounded nutty, cocoa flavor. One of the standard-bearers for the style, although others are a lot more adventurous."
"Creamy beige head, deep brown colour, lacing. Aroma is heavily roasted, dark chocolate, coffee and brown sugar. Flavour is roasted sweet and plenty of coffee and chocolate. The flavour is very well balanced and yet intriguing. Mouthfeel is very very smooth with small bubbles and it is almost a bit oily.This is a great porter, met my expectations and then some!"
"Got an 11.2 oz bottle of this for free recently. Poured into my pint glass. Bottle has a best by date of March 2006, which I did not become aware of until after the beer was in my possession, but I figured what the hell? I am pretty sure that this bottle was sitting in a fridge for most of those 3 years. The yeast and carbonation are indeed still very active even this 3 years past the best by date! This beer pours a clear, dark brown color with auburn highlights. The tan head is about 3 inches thick when poured,l settling to a good nice after about 5 minutes. Good lacing. Head finally settles to a good 1/3 inch after a few sips/ Good staying power. Aromas of malty chocolate and coffee are certainly present, along with a sort of roasted nut aroma too. Brown nutty, roasted malt and coffee flavor upfront, giving way to sweeter chocolate flavors. Not really any hops, maybe a slight trace at most. Has a crisp, but mainly smooth, creamy, and frothy mouthfeel that coasts your palate. Full body with moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink in a good way. I was certainly impressed. Would be curious to try a fresh batch if I can find this in my area. maybe I'll age another bottle or two in my fridge for 3 years past the best by date, because this was damn good!"
"Dark and opaque. Aromas of charcoal smoke and black olives. Taste is initially of chocolate, followed by coffee and finishes with a lingering bitter and smoky aftertaste. There's a metallic aftertaste that goes away after a couple of sips. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Good drinkability although I have had better porters."
"Mouthfeel is very light and surprisingly pleasant. Quite drinkable -- maybe refreshing."
"Very creamy mouthfeel, almost like Guinness but this is cheaper and much better."
"D: Not the most complex I've had... but overall very drinkable... It goes down very easy. Not as filling as some Porters which makes it a little more drinkable."
"D- Quite a tasty porter and not heavy at all. Definitely one you could session."
"What struck me about the taste is how much this reminded me of the Irish stouts. I gather that way way back when, Guinness draught was their version of porter, so that makes sense. Both brews have that astringent roasty flavor, but where Guinness tends toward a sour finish, Fuller's goes to astringent bitterness, something I associate with black malt. All in all a decent brew, but not as rich or sweet as I would like."
"D - I could easily down a few pints of this in one night! An easy drinking, sessionable beer with the perfect balance of malty sweetness, roasted grains, and hop bitterness. An excellent beer!"
"I had high hopes for this brew and while it wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, it didn't measure up to what I was expecting."
"Wow, this is a great porter. I have seen better looking porters, but the taste, holy cow!! Pours a dark, opaque color, in the true porter style. Head retention was not high, but honorable. Tastes of chocolate malts, heavy mouthfeel, full of flavor. Damn, did I mention this is great. Smokey traces come through and cut through the malts. Ends dry with a touch of hops. Great, great porter!"
"D - A great porter, something that all that enjoy the dark beers should try"
"A reliable porter, this beer will always be a good choice."
"Drinkability: Another great porter that is very complex...I could easily have a six."
"Excellent drinkability, not too heavy on the palate and a decent abv make this brew a good choice to pound all night long."
"this one pours about as black as a stout with a nice tan head that fades kinda of slowly to a thin frothy head that almost reminds me of a nitrogen conditioned beer. when held up to the light it shows a dark dark brown color, almost ruby. the nose almost reminds me of a guiness only way more complex. lots of coffee aparent, some chocolate, and some really nice roasted malt aromas. a lot of the coffee and chocolate come through in the taste with a little roastiness, finishing with a nice semi bitter chocolate finish that leaves you longing for more. its medium bodied and not too much carbonation, just perfect. this has some great drinkability both cause great taste and average ABV. this is the first one from fuller's that ive had and i really enjoyed, ill definately be picking up some of their other brews. i highly suggest seeking this one out, i only wish that my porter turned out have as good."
"Drinkability - one only. This is a treat. I wouldn't have another until next Sunday."
"Cheers!"
"Oh to be able to have this one on tap in the wintertime. Very, very drinkable dark beer."
"D: A very nice porter, and one I'd be happy to have again. I've come to find that Fuller's tends to have a knack for making very nice beers, and this is no exception. Well worth it."
"Very good brew."
"Drinkability: Good ABV, taste and mouthfeel. Works for me in this category"
"on-tap at the diner in adams morgan, dc"
"Pich black colored beer with a slowly fading rich creamy head.Aroma is chocolate.Taste is cocoa,coffee and sweet cream.Incredibly smooth and easy drinking.This is one of the top beers I've had in the past couple of years.Highly recommended and I can't wait to get my next one!!"
"Beer poured a deep brown with ruby highlights, one finger off white head that dissapates slowly leaving think lacing behind. Nose is smokey and dark roasted malts, some chocolate and coffee notes as well. Taste is initially of smokey chocolate and coffee. There is a slight hop undertone that gives some bitterness to the beer. Overall, I thought very well balanced. Mouthfeel is lighter bodied, slightly creamy feel to it. This is a great beer - certainly one to sit with for a session."
"Sugary chocolate taste as well burnt malt. Mouthfeel is thick but smoothe. An excellent porter. This one is my favorite porter at the present time."
"D: Very tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very good dark beer to drink for a whole evening."
"A blackish body with a small tan head and minor lacings. A semi-sweet malt smell with caramel notes and hints of coffee malt. Very sweet and somewhat creamy, medium-bodied, with hints of toffee, roasted, coffee and chocolate malts all in there and balances with a dry, satisfying finish (a mix of roasted malt and hops) despite a tad syrupiness from the beer. I could relax with a pint of this anytime."
"Mouthfeel is about as rich as a beer can get. One of the more creamy brews I've had the pleasure to try. Has a pillowy, fluffy feel in the mouth - if that makes any sense. Easy to drink and I would have no problem downing a few of these during dinner or just relaxing before bed. Outstanding brew - simply a must try."
"Pours a deep amber to black color, with a light tan head. In the aroma, roasty and a sweet oatmeal malt. In the taste, roasty malt, sweet, and a small oatmeal presence. A smooth medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a dry roasty oatmeal aftertaste. Almost like a oatmeal stout minus the hops, mellow and nice."
"D - A great porter, something that all that enjoy the dark beers should try"
"B'ham UK January 2009"
"Pours a black colored body with a big tan head, with good lacing, but diminishing. Has an extremely malty aroma, coffee notes. Very light tasting, with some bitterness, some acid, and coffee tastes. Okay beer, kind of a session ale type drink."
" Overall, very pleasant and drinkable--a good session beer at 5.4 abv. Perfect to have on a cold wet January day(or any other day)"
"Overall: The beer doesn't have the burnt sugar or harsh notes to it. The roasted malt seems held back a bit to allow for a very smooth beer. The beer has a medium body and a velvety mouth feel that slightly astringent. The beer gives of a nice complex character but in a refined English way. The finish is slightly bitter allowing the drinker to find the hops that is hidden in this beer. A very well made and on point with its style. There are a few character flaws in the beer I feel could be a bit better probably from shipping."
"very drinkable and easy to session, went well with my steak dinner"
"Full bodied with moderate drinkability. I would say this is a good after diner beer with a slice of chocolate cheese cake or the classic King Dong."
"Overall - This is the paradigm porter. Simply one of the best porters I have ever had. Rich, tasty, roasty, and lightly nutty. Everything a good English porter needs and everything a good English porter has. If there was a standard of porter brewing, this would be it. Cheers!"
"Having finished 2/3 of the beer for the review, I'm now enjoying this with a Porter Chedder from Ireland."
"D: Would certainly be a great session brew. Drinkable, tasty, with no real glaring flaws."
"Poured a deep brown color, borderline black. Smooth, light tan, elegant looking head, nice retention, some lacings sticking to the glass. Toasted malts and cookie dough on the nose. Rich and creamy, some toasted malts, mocha, Milky Way Bar, with a subtle hint of hops. Nice complex rendition of a Porter. This is probably, if not the best Porter out there."
"D- i like the flavor and i could pound a few of these back especially during the winter. A very heavy beer though."
"D- Acceptable evening sipping beer. Goes down easily but is a little to mild in character."
"Ah, a wonderful porter! I just wish places still had it on draught again (ahem, Cornwall's...). The bottle pours out a dark, near black, brown with minimal head that holds onto it's retention all the way down. The smell is what you expect, chocolate-coffee-licorice, with a sharp alcohol nose. The flavor likewise incorporates the above with a bit of hops & malt, and a carbonation that lets the alcohol linger. The taste turns from the sweeter components to a more bitter flavor that rests nicely throughout your mouth and in particular, on the sides of your tongue. I just to sit in a pub with a fire going, then all would be fine...."
"Slim custom bottle poured into my Duvel glass. This beer pours a real dark brown, almost black with a small tan head. Smells of coffee, fruit and the black patent and roasted barley really come through. The taste is very complex as the bottle suggests. Tastes sweet at the beginning and is bitter at the end with chocolate and roasted coffee. The mouthfeel is silky and smooth with nice carbonated. Drinkability is high and is limited only by the high price tag."
"Overall, this is a super-yummy, very drinkable porter."
"Bottle and nitro-tap."
"Altough I'm not a huge porter fan, I'd call this a classic."
"Always a good choice, and my favourite porter."
"Serving type: bottle 500"
"Drinkability: is wonderful too ..you can put down a handful of these"
"D - A great beer, the ABV is a little low, remember me a homebrew I did some months ago, thumbs up, easy example of the Porter style"
"Pours a pitch black with a foamy beige head. Aroma of rosted malts dark chocolate and coffee. Taste very similar to aroma with malty dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Creamy and smooth up front with a dry bitter finish."
"A good after-dinner drink, great for sipping."
"A serious beer, complicated enough to sip thoughtfully."
"mid-full body. pretty smooth. good carbonation. i dig this beer."
"Verdict: An above average Porter, this is something I'd surely recommend for someone looking for a good, easily available example of the style. Rich, but well-balanced, this beer is a complex treat and worthy of its reputation."
"(On tap at Piper's Pub, Pittsburgh, PA)"
"D: seems very drinkable. The low ABV and light mouthfeel helps here."
"Hightly recommended, even for non-porter fans."
"This ale is a very dark reddish/brown almost black in color. With a medium pour, the head is dark brown, dense, and about .5 inches tall. Smell is of vanilla, dark chocolate, and a hint of alcohol. Taste is nice and malty, with a roasted chocolate flavor. A hint of coffee too. The English yeast strain imparts a slightly fruity, buttery flavor. In the finish is a nice, earthy hop flavor. Mouthfeel is smooth, with slightly high carbonation. Fantastically drinkable, it would be easy to drink several of these in a row. Another great one from Fuller's; I don't think they are able to create anything short of exceptional beer!"
"I am still looking for my first 5. Where can it be? Surly Darkness maybe? We will have to wait and see."
"Overall - Excellent, though for me it doesn't quite beat the amazing Colonial Gully Washer Winter Ale (which has been renamed Colonial Porter, and has apparently deteriorated in quality since I last tried it)."
"D: This is an excellent drinking porter."
"D - This is what I've always perceived a true English should be. Very rich and flavorful. Cheers!"
"wow! 634 reviews as of this writing. Hit an irish pub in boston with some colleagues (I know, an irish pubin boston...) for lunch during the work week and noticed this gem on draft. Ordered it up, had a spirited round of beer discussion followed by my friends enjoying their own pints of this great beer. Rich, dark, malty, light bodied and 5.4% AND on tap. How can you go wrong???"
"MF&D - Thin/medium bodied, but very complex and clingy. This is an absolute classic."
"Easy to drink for such a tasty beer, one of the greatest porters out there. Slightly ""worse"" (or better explained, not as great) than the bottle, a great can alternative."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. Full-bodied. Pretty decent drinkability."
"Overall - In dark beers, I'll go for a brown ale for something malty and nutty, a stout for something rich and smooth, and a porter for something sweeter and warming. This is clearly a quality beer, but it doesn't really hit any of those marks - it's sort of a porter crossed with a red ale. Probably won't be buying it again, although I'll be quite happy to finish up the 4-pack."
"A - 4.0, S - 4.0, T - 4.5, M - 5.0, D - 4.0. OVERALL - 4.3"
"D: Overall, this is a good example of a porter. It's a well made beer and easy to drink."
"Similar notes appear on the tongue, dominated mostly by bitter, burnt flavors. Light in body, with a rather refreshing middling bitterness that lingers afterward in the finish, leaving me wishing for another."
"Pours a deep obsidian with minimal head and lacing. Enticing aroma and similar taste of roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but overall not a problem. A fine English porter that I will come back to without question."
"D: Really good drinkability, rich and dark with a fresh roasted coffee flavor that is sure to put this on the top of your list per style."
"The aroma is a deep dark roasted espresso bean that is nearly burnt, awesome. There are also faint malt and caramel whiffs here. When I drank this, there was again espresso, but with chocolate and hints of malt. Nice slight bitterness in the finish that was perfect with a great crisp after taste. Nice thick mouthfeel that's chewy and refreshing. A great example of a great porter.... yummy!"
"d - It might have been because it has been a week since I have had a beer, but when I took the first sip of this it was freaking amazing. The uniqueness seemed to subside a little as I continued to drink. Not sure if my taste buds were just adapting or what. Definitely a great porter. I will have to try this one again."
"Thanks to BA for a great recommendation. Picked this up at Perfect Pour (Columbia) and couldn't wait to try it. Porters are a favorite style and this was no exception. Deep, rich brown/black in the glass, with a thin head. Rich smoky malt in the nose and in the initial taste. A subtle, pleasing sweetness follows with a nice, bitter finish that adds to the drinkability. Well worth finding and trying this one."
"This beer may be black as night, but the bitterness makes it surprisingly refreshing. Very drinkable."
"Overall a really good beer that I'm glad is finally available in Texas again. I really like porters in the cooler months and could see this one being part of that rotation."
"Fullers London Porter pours a medium dense dark ebony with a short lasting fizzy head. The smell is good, but only moderately strong. Taste has similar characteristics; its a fair tasting porter, but there isn't any boldness to the taste. Notable charactieristics include a smooth malt flavor with a slight smokeyness. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and a bit on the thin side. Overall drinkability was good, but I though this could have been a lot bolder in just about every aspect. If this was a reasonably priced six pack I'd say its worth picking up, but for what they are charging the quality is not worth the price."
"Very good stuff, it's hard to say whether I like this one of the Taddy Porter more. They are distinctly different however. If you can get your hands on some of this (it seems to have been eluding me for quite some time) then I would highly recommend doing so."
"D= Definitely a good porter, but with a few minor shortcomings. I would have preferred a bit less carbonation, however I was totally intrigued by the mild smokiness of this beer."
"Medium-bodied with superb carbonation and feel. Outstanding drinkability."
"D: Definitely drinkable, not too much on the coffee or chocolate notes in the taste. I can definitely see myself having this brew again."
"Definitely a good beer, but not as good as I had hoped."
"not too different from the (non-nitro) canned version, it seems. maybe less pronounced chocolate and coffee notes, and overall sweeter, but still just as good. perhaps the nitro also helps with smoothness, but not so much that it really ups the score any bit further."
"Pours a nice foamy kakhi head into english pint. One finger which dissapears quickly, nice deep brown color with ruby highlights when held to the light. A delicious aroma of coffee, and bready malts, and a flavor which delivers with a nice hop bitterness at the finish. A beer which rolls across the tongue leaving a smile on the face quickly inviting another sip to identify a characteristic you missed. Complex enough to try again and again."
"This beer had a deliciously creamy head on it, with a nice dark body. Smell was pleasant - could definitely detect a hop presence more so than the malts, at least in my opinion. The taste had the presence of chocolate and coffee. The finish was superb! A very subtle diacetyl presence, along with a toffee-like sweetness in the aftertaste. A fantastic example of a true porter."
"Poured into a pint glass. DARK brown in color, almost opaque. Nice white head. Carbonation is hard to tell, but I think it's in there. The aroma is a sweet licorice and slightly toasted bread. The taste has some plum pudding notes and then nice roated character. The malt is the backbone of the brew. The body is medium and not too heavy. There is a coating of sweetness throughout the entire session and an overall great beer."
"D-This is an excellent porter and may very well be the best one i've ever had, something even at 12.50 a six i'd be willing to pay."
"500mL can purchased from LCBO in Toronto. Pours a dark brown with a bit of white head. Light malty aroma. First taste is nice, with a solid roasted malt and chocolate flavours. Nice roasty aftertaste. The canned version recently fared poorly at a blind porter and stout tasting at C'est What - but its competition was against mainly draught offerings."
"Hell, I could drink this for breakfast!"
"Fullers london porter is a fine beer indeed, porters and stouts aren't my prefered type of beers but i found this one an excellent beer. It's apperence is almost black and smell is sweet and coffee like,and tasted liked it smelt with the beers body nice and smooth. Another great beer from the almighty Fullers."
"Poured into a pint glass, pours a back cola color with a ruby hue, a bit of lace on the glass. Smell is pretty standard sweet smell of coffee and chocolate. Taste is where this thing is at, one of the tastiest porters I have ever hard, very straight foward on the flavors of strong coffee, espresso, dark chocolate with a nice bitter sweet aftertaste of roasted coffee beans. I have had this on cask as well, the cask served is even better than the bottle if that is possible, let this one warm a tad to truly enjoy the wonders that this beer has to offer."
"D - I prefer Sam Smith's over this, but if I night of dark beer was at hand I wouldn't pass up one of these. Not the best, but still pretty tasty."
"This has become one of my absolute favorite beers, and is a classic example of a fine porter."
"got-damn near faultless! This is the stuff, wow! So fragrant. Really malty, grainy, a bit grassy and some molasses. Big very creamy clingy head with lotsa lace. Roasty chocolate malt flavor. Tan head wth lots of lace. This is fantastic! Not sure if a session beer; so rich. I want more! This was from a sample at Bodega."
"D: I can't wait to get more. This was amazing and it was a fluke I picked it up. Very nice and will drink again."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable porter in a can. Good example of the style. Easy to drink and easier to enjoy. I like it and might buy again."
"Overall a pretty delicious tasting porter. Deep and flavorful. Recommended."
"The smell of the beer is of molasses and dark roasted malts. The roasted malts are more in the tone of coffee than anything else. The beer has a sweet undertone to the dark roasted coffee. It almost tastes like a coffee that has been on the burner for a bit, but has yet to burn. The beer has quite a lot of flavours which are hard to place, but it makes the beer quite unique. There is almost no hop flavour in this beer; I don't think that's an issue, but it's worth noting. The beer isn't too drinkable for me, but it is a great beer to star the evening with."
"Bottle, $10.99/ 6pk I believe. Beautiful dark brown color with cherry highlights. Minimal off white head that faded pretty quickly. Chocolate smell dominates, but trace of coffee in background. Great mouthfeel, very easy to drink for such a complex beer. Taste is very complex to me, hard to easily describe as a new rater. Overall it is one of the easiest to drink of the great beers. How very British."
"Great beer. Wait, did I say that already? Well it's true. Definately something I'll be drinking again and again."
"Taste: Thick and creamy with a dominant cafe de leche taste. Smooth through the midpalate with a chocolate note and a lighter roasted malt note. Finishes as black coffee. Very satisfying."
"I tried this beer on October 7, 2007 after purchasing from my local LCBO outlet. The beer poured into the glass a beautiful, dark, murky brown colour with a large tan coloured head. The aroma was a combination of malt and yeast with some sweet hints. The mouthfeel was thick and full with some mild carbonation, almost creamy. The taste was malty with some hints of caramel (the possible sweetness in the aroma). This was a very good beer."
"Poured from a bottle it pours out dark Brown,with a 1/4 inch head which goes quickly. Smells of chocolate and Sweet malts with a touch of coffee smell. Tastes of Chocolate and malted coffee a little sweetness. Feels great in your mouth. Very nice beer to drink flavorful and enjoyable. It is exspensive but it is the Best Porter I have ever tasted! I will buy it again some time and recomend trying it!"
""
"This poured a deep brown, with almost no head. It smelled sweeter than I expected, with hints of dark chocolate and roasted malts. It tasted of dark chocolates, with a burnt malt and slight coffee aftertaste. It was very creamy and smooth as it went down, with a tad bit of carbonation. Overall, this was a great beer and very enjoyable to drink."
"D - Not sure I could do more than one of these in a sitting, the candy like flavor gets to be a bit too much after a while. Not bad overall and certainly worth a try."
"D: Extremely sessionable and very rewarding to drink. It's relatively cheap and available in most beer stores...oh yeah!"
"D: Easy drinking and a classic. I will revisit this for sure"
"D: Very drinkable. Drink with Red meat and sharp cheese. I am a huge fan of this porter, I will definitely look for this one again."
"The beer arrived with a translucent black body and a thin white head. The beer tasted of a pleasant mix of dark and pale malts with a bit of British hops. Well-balanced and very filling, but I feel that there are better options out there."
"Pours a transparent mahogany color with dark red hues, a pinky's width of beige lacing with little retention but good lacing. Smells of caramel, toffee, nuts, chocolate, dark fruit, and espresso. Taste starts of with roasted malts, caramel, molasses, and chocolate, with a touch of cherries and a bitter coffee finish. Medium in body and very smooth and creamy, but with a dry finish. Being lower in alcohol and rich in flavors make this a very easy beer to drink, especially during the winter months."
"Mmm, with the cheese this is divine. A solid porter."
"Notes: This is a remarkable English porter. This one could me through the coldest of winter nights.Cheers"
"Overall - A supremely well balanced stout... another world class brew from Fullers..."
"d: Very different from it's American cousins. I absolutely love this beer! It is not at all complex, it's just an amazing brew."
"One of the best tasting brews I have ever had. Complex with chocolate and coffee flavours. Deep and delicious! Unbelievably easy to drink with a full flavour and aggressive, yet not overly."
"Love this beer - I get all giddy when I see this at a friends house..."
"Bottle with best before 08/08 on it. Pours a real deep dark reddish brown with some light shining through it. The aromas are very welcoming with hints of chocolate, coffee, caramels, nuts, and some sweet fruity notes. It has a nice smooth mouthfeel and texture to it with a slight carbonation to it. Tastes of dark chocolate and expresso take control with subtle fruity and sweet tastes round it out for a very solid drinkable porter. I'll definitly keep and eye out for some more of this if I see it in the future. Great stuff."
"Good stuff... Recommended..."
"D - Definitely easy to drink, but would have appreciated something with more taste than smokiness and moderate malt-feel."
"D: This is definitely a beer I could drink all night. Delicious, not too filling, not too sweet and in general a very delicious porter. Wish I had more than just one!"
"All in all a decent porter."
"Tap @ Gingerman; poured very dark brown/black with a light thin beige head. Smell was great, and of dark fruitiness, dried fig, alcohol, and a definite mocha coffee smell. Taste was rich, creamy, and coffee like, with bitterness in the back of the mouth, and mouthfeel was almost a bit oily, and nicely thick for a porter."
"This is without a doubt the best porter I have had to date. There seems to be an enormous complexity that comes off as simple and enjoyable. Very much recommended."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The bber was a black ebony delight with a very tan head. The smell was of nice roasted malts and nuts. The taste was smooth coffee with toasted goodies that were just wonderful to savor. I can only imagine hoe fine this beer would be on tap and reallly fresh. I will certainly buy again."
"Fuller's London Porter is dark brown on the pour with a satisfying tan head. Sweet malt dominates the nose. Tasty chocolate is up front on the taste, with some roasted flavor and slight hopiness at the finish. The taste and body is a little on the thin side or this porter would be even more appealing. In any event, justifiably a favorite."
"Pint at Volo and also from cans and bottles. The beer arrives with a wonderful dark body and a nice foamy tan head. The aroma is of coffee and chocolate, and is extremely enticing! Very smooth - like drinking an espresso chocolate cake covered in cream. I find this to be far better on cask than the bottled and canned versions."
"Exellent example of the style, knock yourself out and give it a try."
"Fuller's London Porter is a beautiful dark brown and pours with a small amount of tan creamy foam. The aroma consists of chocolate and hops. The beer rolls smoothly over the palate. Roasted malt strongly comes through in the flavor with biting coffee and chocolate prominent and a mixture of hop bitterness. The finish is quick and dry. This is a nicely balanced and very drinkable beer."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brownish black with a light tan head. The slightly buttery aroma features dark roasted malts, coffee and just a touch of chocolate. The taste is roasted malts and coffee with a nice dry and bitter finish. Overall, this is an outstanding porter that is certainly among my favorites within the style. Highly recommended."
"I haven't had a bottle of this in a long time, so I decided to give it another go. It's not quite as good as I remembered, or maybe I've just drank lots of great beer in between! It's a little one dimensional and I wish it had more body. I had a pint of Bushwakker Palliser Porter last night, and it was better than this."
"The beer poured an impenetrable black with no head into a pint glass. Not much aroma, just a hint of malt sweetness. The taste was the classic porter combination of flavors - roasted barley with undertones of chocolate and toasted malt - excellent. Very low carbonation (no lacing down the glass), and served close to cellar temperature. Fullers is, in my opinion, the benchmark for the English Porter style."
"D-rather drinkable for such a dark pour,would be hard to stop after one if there were another lying around,but for tonight this was a great beer after a long holiday filled with watery beers"
"Poured dark and evil looking, black as the night. Nice 1 finger head with a hard pour, dwindling to nothing but some stickiness. Smell is of roasted, or smoked chocolate and caramel, perhaps some smoked wood as well. Taste was very smooth, smoky rich flavor, but not overwhelming at all. Mouth fell was fair, a little thin. Drinkability is way up there, as this is very smooth and mild to the mouth and nose. Nice to keep handy when you want something easy to drink that won't knock you over."
"D: Very easy to drink all night. This will become a regular for me."
"très beau porter de belle couleur brune opaque, mousse brune durable, avec un nez de chocolat, de café en grain, en bouche ce porter a une belle rondeur avec un goût de malt chocolat (torréfié), bonne amertume. très bonne bière"
"Drinkability: Nice flavor and easy to drink. Very good for a porter, just not my go to style. Highly recommended for porter fans, worth a try for everyone else."
"D - Very good. A fantastic dark session brew with the 5.4 % abv and satisfying coffee flavor."
"Very dark and inviting, thin creamy head that does not stay around too long. Seemed to dissipate after a short while. Some roasty, burnt flavors in the nose with a hint chocolate. The taste was full of roasted malt and coffee, with a little bit of sugar and chocolate. It was more smoky than I expected, but still very good. The mouth-feel was surprisingly thin judging by its appearance, but not too thin. This was a decent pint and will tag it as a safe-bet porter whenever I see it on tap anywhere."
"First beer from Fuller's and it was quite disappointing, not one of the better porters I have had, first place I have ever seen a bottle so I grabbed one, not recommended and would not drink again"
"D - A highly drinkable and well rounded beer with a great mix of flavours."
"D: Really good beer. Complex and enjoyable. At 5.4% you can enjoy more than one of these. If I had another bottle I would get into it. I have other porters to try tonight though."
"A creamy white head sits on top of the black body known as London Porter. It's both light and full of flavor. The taste is a fight between molasses, chocolate, and coffee, but overall it won't wreck your palate and goes down very easy. Finish is semi-dry with smoky tones. This would be some devastating stuff if the pub I had this on-tap tonight served it in a huge one liter mug."
"This is one of best beers i have ever had in my whole life. There is so much flavor in this beer. So rich in flavor that you should drink very slowly to make sure you get the full effect. Alot of effort was put into this beer, so I really can't describe it to a T. Just go try it for yourself. It is worth the few extra bucks."
"Would love to try this one on tap."
"I've had this beer on draught previously and seem to recall it being more viscous, but the pour seems thin and the head is virtually nonexistent. The appearance reminds me of soda like root beer or coke with less carbonation. In the nose we have chocolate, coffee, and a good amount of black licorice. Milk chocolate and licorice are the first taste followed by a dry hop bitterness. A decent amount of complexity makes this a delightful tasting beer. The mouthfeel could be richer for this style. Regardless of that, this is a really tasty and well made beer - easy drinking. Highly Recommended."
"Very dark, shades of brown with light. Nice creamy light tan head. The nose was strong of dark chocolate and fresh coffee. Aromas of the delicious English hops are present. Again, the taste is well balance with coffee, chocolate and the English fuggle hops. This is a very smooth and drinkable classic porter. I would recommend it with a good burger or fish and chips."
"Standard, well-rounded porter. Delicious and madly drinkable, but doesn't leave you entirely satisfied."
"Pours a very dark brown with a medium light tan head. Aroma is dark roasted malt with coffee notes and some floral hops. Nice malty taste. Notes of dark chocolate, coffee and dark fruit. Nice background sweetness. A few herbal hops. Just a bit of bitterness from the dark malt. Quite balanced, nuanced, and delicious. Mouthfeel is medium and just about right for this beer. Very drinkable and a great porter overall."
"Very, very, dark brown attractive pour with off-white head that lingered for a while. Aroma is of coffee. Taste is also of coffee, but this beer is not too bitter. Nicely balanced. Mouthfeel is nice as carbonation level is just just right. A nice sessionable porter."
"Pours a very dark brown with a couple fingers of quickly fading head. Smells very roasty, some chocolate and a hint of coffee grounds. Tastes of sweet roast, a little coffee grounds show as it warms along bakers chocolate and a minor bite in the finish. Light in the mouth with good carbonation. Easy going session beer with a little oomph."
"Not much more to say. This is a great beer, and like the ESB this is the standard for the style IMO. Highly recommended."
"A quintessential porter. Every other porter dreams of growing up to be like this."
"D - A great Porter - Rich, yet easy to drink many more than 2 at a time. This ale is a fine blend of malty flavors w/ subtle roast and char notes. Excellent tasting porter from the 1st sip to the last."
"This is a very drinkable ale. I've had porters that are heavy on the sweet side, which goes against type, or are too bitter. Well, this one's just right. I'll have another."
"This one confused me a little initially, but after I got used to it, turned out to be quite tasty. Poured a solid deep mahogany color with a finger of off-white head that dissolves a little quick for me. Solid lacing. Nose is pure, almost sweet roasted malt - roasted molasses maybe. Some light prunes, even pomegranate. Flavor is interesting. First off is actually tons of toasted malt. Some orange. Coffee. Not nearly as fruity and sweet as the aromas would suggest. A taste reminiscent of cigarettes as well, which I'm not loving. Light nuts and a hint of chocolate. Body is fairly full, with solid carbonation. I was totally turned off by that initial cigarette-y flavor (I have no idea what it could be), but it faded as I drank, and by the end I was quite enjoying this one."
"Bottle courtesy of Fisherman34. Pours out a cola redish hue, with surprising clarity. Excellent head retention, followed by a nice string of lacing. Nose is of a mild mocha coffee. Taste is medium roast and nuts. Slightly bitter finish from the roasted barley and some herbal hops. Not at all sweet and has a nice body to it. Great example of a sessionable porter."
"Pours a nice dark brown,with a ruby red highlight in the light. Aroma is of roasted malts,and dark chocolate. Body is on the thin side,with a bit of carbionation. Taste is of bitter dark chocolate,and carmel,with a hint of butterscotch in the finish. Good,but not out standing in my opinion."
"D- Very drinkable, even in warm weather, a great example of the style. Fullers seldom disappoints, and this is one of their better beers."
"I've had this many times in the past so really looked forward to finally reviewing it. Poured a dark although not completely opaque liquid with a light mocha-tan head that was a finger thick and had staying power. Good lacing. An understated aroma of figs gave way to the smell of a freshly opened box of dark chocolates, very subtle, not overpowering. Very good taste and mouthfeel with a smooth texture, well balanced bitterness and chicory overtones. The pleasant finish leaves you wanting more. I found this, as I have in the past, a clean and not overly complicated porter that always satisfies."
"Comments: One heck of a beer. Would be great with a Turkey on rye or a baked potato. Having a few Riesens wouldn't be bad either. It's one of those beers you have to say ""wow"" out loud after the first taste."
" Overall, This was great. I really enjoyed the roasted flavor and the full on malt assault. This could have been one of my more favorite brews to date. Really a top noth offering and I would be thrilled to get some more!"
"This is my second Fuller's, the other being the equally good ESB. More exploration of this great brewery is in order."
"An exceptional porter. Had from the bottle and was glad to see this on-tap this evening. Medium creamy head that left great lacing and also lasted near the duration of the beer. Smell of light roasted coffee and chocolate malts. Taste was much of the same. Very clean and refreshing mix of chocolate and coffee balanced by a faint hop bite. Mouthfeel was rich and smooth. Very easy going down and unlike any other I've tried. Easy drinkability. Session is one word to describe the phenomenon. I like."
"The taste is rather similar to the nose. Dark roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and the hops round up everything neatly. I will certainly make room in my fridge for this one."
"This is the beer that makes me reconsider my preference for the more hoppy American style porters. I love them both, but Fuller's is downright near perfect."
"Pours exactly as a porter should. Deep brown with a thick tan head that settles very slowly. Heavy caramel/molasses aroma with a hint of bittering hops in the front. The taste is very well balanced. Thick and creamy with dark roasted malts, molasses, nutty chocolate, and mildly bitter ending. Not too strong (alcohol-wise) keeping the taste mild for such a heavy beer. One of the most drinkable porters I've ever had simply because of the mouthfeel and rich character. Very close in competition with Sam Smith."
"Poured dark brown with a somewhat small head and okay lacing. Looks like a porter should. The smell is of lightly toasted grain and some dry caramel malt. The taste is similar. Rounded, with dry malt characteristics, licorice, and slightly nutty. A semi sweet chocolate aftertaste. The mouthfeel is dry and somewhat creamy. Very drinkable, and an excellent example of the style."
"Very drinkable. Tasty and full of body, the low to middle level of alcohol makes me think I could drink three or four of these while reading a book or hanging out on BA without too much consequence."
"Overall, right tasty brew. Will definitely be looking for more of this!"
"Taste is maltbitter, but mild, with coffee, chocolate and cacoa. Hops give the beer an earthy bitter and hoppiness, which is also a bit resinous. Mouthfeel is extremely smooth. This all sounds like another porter, but the amazing balance between the burned taste and malt and hops, make this beer stand out. Also the way the burned taste develops when emptying the glass is a sign of a lot of craftmanship."
"D: Excellent, I think that this is Fuller's best beer. It stands well and above the Sierra Nevada Porter I just had."
"Can't believe this is my first try of this classic brew. This beer pours a dark ruby brown with a lacy malt chocolate head. Aroma is heavy roasted coffee with some chocolate hints and malt hints. Taste is nice, a little thin, but nice coffee and dark cocoa with some bitterness as the backbone. This beer goes down extra smooth and makes an easy session beer."
"Great drinkability, this one goes on my list of favorites."
"Very smooth and very drinkable. The aroma and flavor are heavy on the mocha with a touch of cream. There's a decent dry bitterness, but nothing astringent or unpleasant, and long-lasting coffee aftertaste. To me the mark of a great beer is in the aftertaste, and while this isn't the most complex porter, it's a fantastic porter. A beer worth sitting down and analyzing, or just enjoying. Quite yummy, give it a try."
"overall, this brew is masterfully crafted to provide a wide breadth of flavors and aromas to satisfy picky drinkers of any taste (myself included). extremely well done Fuller's, cheers!"
"All in all, a definite winner - more flavour than Guinness despite the lack of any roast barley."
"D - Pretty good, goes done smooth because of its light body"
"Final Statement: A very fine porter. Try it."
"Drinkability - Good. Coffee lover's enjoy!"
"Wow. How did I miss this one? From a small deli in the middle of Union Square in San Francisco this poured very dark, almost black. Big fat tan head, and good chunks of lacing. Nose of chocolate coffee and a nice smooth mouthfeel. Flavors again of chocolate and coffee, with a hint of vanilla. Very nice slightly bitter finish. A simply outstanding porter."
"D - Not too bad. I wouldn't mind having this one again."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark brownish black with a light tan head. The slightly buttery aroma features dark roasted malts, coffee and just a touch of chocolate. The taste is roasted malts and coffee with a nice dry and bitter finish. Overall, this is an outstanding porter that is certainly among my favorites within the style. Highly recommended."
"Overall, I like it very much. Micro's aside this is my favourite porter."
"Great beer. I enjoy it more each time I have it."
"Pours a very dark brown moderate opacity. Small creamy tan head looks inviting. Aroma is mostly coffee with some roasty malts and cocoa. Taste is primarily coffee with bitersweet cocoa and roasty malts. Mouthfeel is a little on the thin side. Relatively drinkable, not my favorite style."
"M/D- good. Not too heavy, not too light. Carbonation is lively enough. With the taste being a bit different than other american porters I've had, I must say I prefer the american style, with a little less roastiness and a little more sweetness."
"Goes down very easy. Tastes bold, full, strong, yet I know I can safely have a few. Another is sitting on the counter warming a couple degrees even as I type this. Can't wait!"
"Too overpowering in the coffee stakes for me, the chocolate and caramel I can handle OK, but just a little too much decaff."
"Drinkability is very good, super smooth and well balanced."
"Overall im not a big coffee drinker, but someone who enjoys coffee will enjoy this brew. I really wasn't diggin this brew. Actually it was one of the more bland porters ive had. : P"
"D: At 5.4% abv, this is supremely drinkable."
"This beer has a pretty nutty flavor, along with some notes of charcoal, chocolate, roasted malt, and cold coffee. Not much in the form of a hop pressence, but it works. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is great. A very good porter."
"Best Before: 14/JUL/07"
"Drinkability: easy drinking mild taste and alcohol make for a desirable session beer. Real nice porter."
"Of all the beers I have ever had, this is my favorite! Poured from a 11.2oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer pours a deep brown, forming a very thin head, leaving light lacing. The aroma is strong mocha coffee. The taste is just wonderful! Thick roasted malts, light chocolate, heavy smooth coffee, with a hint of toffee. Nice medium mouthfeel. Overall, this is an easy smooth porter. I can drink this all night. If you havent tried this, you dont know what your missing. Definitely my favorite beer of all time!"
"Fairly light bodied and quite drinkable. I could have used a bit more carbonation, but it was fine and appropriate as is."
"pours almost black with some ruby highlights and a one inch tan head that fades quickly to just covering the beer but with sheets of lacing to the finish. smell, roasted coffee, dark caramel, brown sugar or burnt sugar. taste roasted coffee and chocolate with a slightly smoke flavor. mouthfeel is very smooth and carbonation is ok. would buy it again, very tasty enjoyable beer."
"Absolutely delicious."
"Cheers!"
"D- Pretty enjoyable, a good departure from your average American porter."
"The drinkability is very good. At first I thought, OK a good porter but I won't be hunting it down, but that later tastes after it warms are just great and yes I will be buying more. Prosit MK"
"Pours a rich, deep brown color....like coffee from a french press. Head is tan in color, nearly 2 fingers, and fades to a nice cream cap that lasts for the duration. Aroma is a mixture of roasted malts, coffee, and fruity apple-like notes as well. Taste begins with the coffee up front, but quickly gives way to hints of dark chocolate, and toasty caramel, with an ever-so-slight hop note....also a touch of fruitiness in there too, which seems to be a signature of English styles. This brew is easy on the palate with it's medium body, and finishes with a lingering chocolate-coffee effect. I could enjoy this one as a desert, or in the pub all damn day. Good beer, worth a try for sure!"
"Straight forward, plain and simpleand just great. I could drink it all day long."
"Dark black color, white creme colored, small head that dissipates quickly. Lacing does stick around the glass though. Smells really sweet, fruity, and malty. Taste great. Dark chocolate start, bitter coffee finish, A lingering coffee with a slightly hoppy aftertaste that makes the mouth tingle. Just the right amount of carbonation to make the bitter finish stick around for a while, but doesn't allow it to overstay its welcome, inviting the drinker in for another taste. Overall a very rich complex brew that is worth drinking."
"Superiorly drinkable. Great session beer."
"I'm really blown away by this one. Typically, I find most ""everyday"" British beers to be a bit ho-hum.... This one is fantastic. Some British beers stand out, like J.W. Lee's Harvest, Fuller's Vintage, etc.... this one stand in the same category as far as quality. I could drink this all night long during the fall/winter. Highly recommended for any porter lover, and well worth seeking out."
"Let's just start with the looks of the bottle itself. This bad boy is a 16.9oz James Bond villain with a beer cap. Pours into a pint glass with a down to business black coffee color, a dark tan, fairly lingering head followed. This beer had fantastic smells of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and light traces of toffee. The taste...oh what a taste it is....again, dark chocolate, with a heavy backing of rich black coffee that gave a subtle bitterness to the beer, following the English Porter style wonderfully. The mouth feel was substantial, but light enough for multiple pints of this beer to be enjoyed in one sitting. I could, and have, consumed this beer on a very regular basis. Pairs phenomenally with raw oysters on the half shell, along with a hearty shepard's pie...Enjoy"
"Overall, I was a bit disappointed with this beer. I was expecting so much more, given the reputation the brew enjoys. A good solid stout."
"Drinkability: Very drinkable and very tasty. If you've never had a porter, try this one."
"This beer is smooth, dark, rich, and oh sooo good!! The head wasn't big after some time after the pour, but the lacing was there. The smell is rich in coffee, but without bitterness. The taste is unbelievable, even better than the smell. The mouthfeel is very smooth, I love it. Overall, I really hope to get more of this fine brew. It's awsome!!"
"I think this is great beer to try if you have not. The most important thing is i would i purchase another six pack? The answer is yes."
"This beer was all it was said to be."
"Beer poured a deep brack with a hint of red when held up to light. Nose is somewhat malty and a hint of chocolate and coffee. Taste is very good, of chocolate malts roasted producing a coffee flavor balanced with a nice hop finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, very nice! Drinkabilty is extremely good, This is a beer that all porter fans must try!"
"Mouthfeel was thin to medium. Very smooth and highly drinkable."
"The taste is just as enjoyable. There is a burnt chocolate flavor, that is accompanied by hints of coffee, and a caramalized malt to accentuate the sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and very smooth. This beer is highly drinkable, and probably the best English Porter I've had to date. Fuller's has raised the bar for porters."
"A top-notch English porter -- a lot more smooth and creamy than American porters I've sampled."
"Solid porter no doubt. Not really anything amazing to me, but a good representative of the style."
"I highly enjoyed this one. Rich and malty but still complex in flavor. At 5.4% alcohol, this makes one great session beer. Highly recommended for dessert, before dinner, or whenever you feel like enjoying a great English Porter."
"Overall, this is an absolutely outstanding beer, easily the best porter there is. Not just extremely tasty, but also easy to drink, and with a mild abv. If you are a fan of the style, you will flat out love this brew."
"I could drink this forever."
"drinkability is great. well balanced and very tasty brew. a classic and delicious example of the style."
"Mouthfeel is good, slightly on the dry side, and drinkability is excellent, even for an English Porter. Downright sessionable. Another style defining beer from Fuller's."
"The flavour started with a bit of sharp coffee bitterness, but that quickly yielded to a smooth, chocolately taste. Low carbonation and medium body made this exceptionally easy-drinking  and a guaranteed repeat purchase."
"this is a great porter, fullers is one of the best."
"Overall, a classic. Drinkable, plenty of taste, well balanced. Just straightforward excellent porter taste. One of the easiest porters to enjoy out there."
"Drinkability: All the time please"
"Recommended."
"A great English porter. I love the creaminess in the smell and taste, along with the buttery caramel sweetness. A great medley of flavors. This is a perfect pairing to any rich and chocolatey dessert. Highly recommended and a must have for porter lovers."
"This was my first taste of Fuller's London Porter. I am a big fan of American Porter styles, so this was an attempt to try the original Porter style from Britain. I poured the bottle in a thick pint glass, and noticed very little carbonation. Short, caramel head. The aroma of this beer is excellent... mostly chocolate with some caramel. First taste hits the buds quite a lot more than other Porters I've tried. Reminiscent of a dark-roasted coffee. More hops that I expected, and not very heavy. After a few sips, the flavor settles into a very smooth and malty taste. This is an excellent Porter, no doubt about it."
"Quite easy drinking."
"Pours a deep black with molasses highights. Big, vulgar bubbles form the head and quickly fade to just a ring. The aroma is a huge improvement on the appearance; big malty chocolate aromas (think malted chocolate milk) jump right out, along with crispy roasted malts and just a hint of fruity sweetness (raspberry?). Beautifully balanced mouthfeel, with some roughness from roasted malts and some hops coexisting perfectly with a slickness not far from an oatmeal stout's. Tasty chocolate notes, along with dry roasted malt notes, form the backbone of this beer, but there are also earthy hops and a bit of smoke in the palate. This is truly a wonderful porter, one of the best English examples of the style that I have ever tasted."
"The most remarkable thing about this beer to me is its finish. I taste a very clear -- and pleasant -- molasses finish. I find it a rather sweet beer, with low hoppiness. Small but persistent head; little lacing. Average mouthfeel, but very pleasant taste. A winner; I'd definitely drink it again."
"The low abv could make this a great session beer and I would like to be a part of that session!"
"Great drink on a cool fall day. What a way to treat myself this fine fall afternoon. Could make a session of this, and what a rich and decadent session it would be. Also a great introduction to just what a porter is for those new to the style but ready to do some adventuring."
"Note: Just noticed a ""best before 9 Sept 06"" on the label. Stupid low turnover store. From how good it was, I can't imagine the bottle was tainted."
"I bought this beer in Idaho as I wanted to expand my English beer knowledge. Deep and dark color as a porter should be. Superior malt scent. Espresso/chocolate taste that is remarkable. Low alcohol and very good drinkability. To me this is a porter that should be drank when it's cold outside, in the evening, by the fire. Sit back, relax and enjoy ths wonderful porter!"
"Drinkability: High drinkability, low alcohol, I could drink many of these. Alas, I can not get more."
"Smooth and a little silky on the tongue with solid carbonation make this a nice feeling on the palate. This is a porter you want to always have in stock for those rainy days, and heck, sunny days too with all other days in between. Friggen amazing this one!"
"Served in a pint glass the beer pours dark brown, with a small sized tan head. It smells very sweet, like coffee, molasses, brown sugar and chocolate. It tastes the same way, except I can also taste some caramel and that it has a slight bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium, creamy and smooth. It's also very drinkable, it goes down pretty easy. Overall this is a very good beer, I think it could become a great session beer for me."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Mouthfeel is a little on the rich side. Drinkability is limited for the same reason. I liked it, but I have to call it overrated."
"Drinkability - If this is really what they drank in London in the early nineteenth century then I was born a hundred years too late!"
"Overall, after reading other reviews, I'm a bit non-plussed. Good, but nothing great to me. I was expecting a bit maltier and chewier brew."
"D: I don't really need to go into details...perfectly balanced and quite drinkable. There you go."
"drinkability: a little heavy for everyday use, but supremely pleasant nonetheless."
"This one rivals my all time favorite, Okocim, which I hold in almost religious esteem. That this one even approaches my hallowed beer among beers is really saying something."
"D: Excellent representative of an english porter, I wish I had a second bottle."
"One of the best porters out there, for sure."
"Fuller's London Porter is perfect after a hard day at work, a wonderful stress-reliever. An excellent example of the style, and a very good beer, period."
"D: I would drink this beer anytime it was offered. Simply tastes great and is surprisingly refreshing for a porter!"
"Rich and creamy with carmelized fruit flavors as well as black coffee and chocolate with smoky finish. Extremely drinkable, especially considering the cost of $4/bottle."
"Tall 11.2 oz. bottle, best by 2/9/07. It pours a deep deep brown that is practically black with a 2 finger, light brown head that leaves some lacing. Smells creamy/milky with rich, almost sweet coffee, chocolate, kaluha, cocoa, and a touch of green hops. Absolutely divine. The flavor is roasty with burnt/charred malts, coffee, chocolate, and a medium bitterness. It has medium carbonation, finish, and a body that is medium, slightly drying, and becomes creamy by the end. Overall a quality porter that I would definitely revisit."
"Pours dark brown with creamy tan head. Aroma is chocolate, carmel and coffee. Taste is carmel and roasted malt, finish is pleasant roasted flavor without too much bitterness. Medium body and with a fair amount of carbonation. This beer is too expensive to session, but this is a quality beer."
"A very nice English Porter, and one of my favorite Porters overall."
"Pours a dark mahogony-black with a half a finger, bubled, tan colored head. The head on the beer is unappealing and macro-like. The Aroma is caramelly, minimally hopped, and nothing special here either. Taste is very brownish, rather light, mostly sweet malts and a bit of chocolate in there as well. The flavor is rather fleeting, it appears and then disapears. Mouthfeel is medium light with a tangy carbonation. On the edge of too light for a porter in my estimation. Drinability-wise, this is extremely sessionable and a decent beer, nothing worth avoiding...it's a good drinking beer but doesn't scream ""made with pride"" given its characteristics. It's just a drinker. A step down from Samual Smith."
"I like this one better than Sam Smith's Taddy Porter, well worth it's 'Outstanding' rating."
"D - An good beer overall. Worth trying."
"A medium-plus body with the right amount of carbonation and alcohol give it a good, smooth mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable Porter that is a ""must try"" for sure. I had forgotten how good this stuff is...cheers!"
"D - Very drinkable. A very tasty brew. I've had a few Fuller's brew's and there all great. Highly recommended."
"Pours an opaque black/brown color with a large head of small brown bubbles. Strong roasted barley aroma. Biscuits. Taste is perfectly roasted grain. Fresh baked bread and malt. Chewy, but not syrupy. Excellent mouthfeel and body. The burnt, coffee like dryness lingers long into the aftertaste. Awesome brew. I will buy this again and again."
"One of the best beers I have had. Will be buying this a lot more but to bad I have to drive about 25 mins to get some."
"Oh, did I mention the ""best by"" date on the label? Pay close attention to that :)"
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable. I give Fuller's London Porter a hearty ""fine & dandy""!"
"Fuller's London Porter pours an opaque, deep, dark, brown with a tan head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. Really nice aroma, dark chocolate and coffee. Outstanding flavor, coffee. dark chocolate, even tobacco flavors. Highly recommended. I will be buying some more of this."
"Poured a very dark, reddish brown color with a medium-sized, creamy, light tan head that left nice lacing on the glass. ARoma of roasted and chocolate malts, vanilla, and light dark fruits in the background. Slight chocolate and roasted malt, with vanilla beans, and light caramel in the taste. Creamy and full mouthfeel."
"I could go on and on about this beer. If you haven't tried it yet, seek out a bottle and you won't be disappointed. World Class stuff from Fuller's."
"A unique and tasty porter. Has a little sharper flavor than many porters, but a classic in its own way."
"Overall a very tasty beer. excellent malt flavors. very good"
"This beer would probably make an excelent session beer. It is low in alcohol, and the flavor is quite mild. I havent hd this beer in a while, and I forgot how good it is. I will definately be having many more in the future."
"Nice dark look to it. Not pitch black but close. Solid one finger off white head with some staying power. Smells like molasses. Tastes a good deal like molasses as well. Am I spelling molasses right? Anywho, heavy maltiness. Fairly full body. Creamy, good carbonation. Very drinkable if you like that sort of flavor, but since it's so flavorful it might be a turn-off otherwise."
"Notes: I love dark, malty beers, and this is one of the best I've had. A real full-flavored porter."
"If there was a textbook pour for a Porter, there'd be a picture of this beer in said book. Black body that is dark ruby around the edges. Head is one inch of nappy brown foam. Nose is espresso, chocolate and a hint of molasses. Taste is pretty much the same with the chocolate reminding me of chocolate syrup. I also get just the barest suggestion of smoke. Mouth is thick with sparse carbonation. If you enjoy porters, this one is a beer that you'd surely be able to drink all night long."
"I don't like porters all that much, so I'm not a fair judge of this beer. I'd say it was all right, actually in pretty good shape considering it was 10 months past its ""best by"" date. I'd like to try it fresh and on tap in London for a re-review."
"Very drinkable. Hey Porter!"
"I'd never had more than a few sips of porter in the past, but figured I would give this one a try. Although typically I don't really enjoy the flavors of coffee and chocolate, here they come across (somewhat to my surprise) in a extremely enjoyable manner, especially with regards to the smell. I will definitely be having this again."
"This ranks as one of the finest beers I've ever had! I was expecting a good beer, and was pleasantly surprised to find a great beer. I've recently tried Stone RIS, and I rate the Fuller's London Porter much higher."
"London Porter is almost black in color with a tall, creamy head. Head's color is a dark tan. Aroma is of roasted malt alongside a sweet caramel. A sip starts with a blast of roasted malt with notes of coffee and charcoal. An underlying caramel sweetness is noticed towards the middle of a sip and only increases towards the finish. This porter has the most roasted malt flavor that I've tasted in a long time which makes the overall mouthfeel very dry. A strong, steady malt flavor make this beer a winner."
"This is a great beer and very drinkable. I will always go back to this one."
"It was like eating a very rich chocolate cake. It was silky and smooth, but the richness made it akin to eating a heavy chocolate cake. No matter how much you love the taste, you can only eat so much. This is a beer to treat yourself and indulge as a desert or a nightcap!"
"Drinkability: this has always been the enjoyable porter in my book, as I find this easy drinking and nicely flavorful. Solid brew."
" Medium light body, buttery smooth mouthfeel. I really enjoyed this one. This was my first Fuller's product, I will have to try the rest of their offerings."
"Mouthfeel- Pretty medium bodied for a pretty dark and creamy looking brew. There were lots of dark tasting flavors to back up the look and smell of this Brew. The palate of this brew is would go very nice with some Hershey's chocolate."
"Overall- A decent porter that needs a little more flavor. Not bad."
"Pours black with ruby highlights under a finger or two of dark khaki foam that lasts to the final drop. Nose is sweet and toasty with notes of toffee and cocoa powder. Taste starts off with the milky-sweet toffee/caramel and transitions nicely into roasted malt, toasted biscuit and a nice coffee bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth, gliding through the mouth. Probably the best English porter I've had to date as I have found them to be characterized by thin body and metallic aftertaste, neither of which were found here. Glad to finally find this classic gem."
"At a measly 5.4%, this beer has more character and charm than a lot of the bigger beers people lose their shit over. A nearly flawless porter, and I've yet to find another that even comes close to this."
"Beer is good. Happy world renowned eering."
"Drinkability is rather good... this went down easily. If you're in the mood for a porter, this one is a great choice."
"Just as good as it's ever been, the bottle I'm savoring now is fresher than the one I reviewed. Full tilt roasty goodness with coffee, chocolate and toffee/caramel notes. An awesome porter."
"medium-full body with a medium-high carbonation; not incredibly rich, but very smooth. chocolate and dark fruits with a clean, coffee bitter finish. nicely balanced and incredibly drinkable."
"Poured blackish brown with ruby edges and a half inch head. Aroma is of creamed and dark roasted coffee and chocolate , dark maltiness , and tinge of buttery diactyl. Taste is rich and roasty. Chocolate and coffee flavors dominate , some slightly bittersweet molasses and a bit of hops and smoke. Mouthfeel is creamy with a pleasant bitter/coalish aftertaste. An exellent English porter. Flavorfull and smooth , very drinkable."
"Taste; The coffee and bittersweet chocolate come out first as with the smell, followed by the toffee and a bit of a toasted flavor, and in the finish there's a touch of black licorice. There's very little bitterness to this beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a bit dry, and so easy to drink."
"Tan head with good lacing covers a dark brown beer. Aromas of Caramel, chocolate and malt on the nose. Well rounded balance in this beer. The Chocolate and Caramel sweetness works well with the hint of hops. Goes down so smooth. No heavy alcohol presence makes this easy to drink."
"Opinion: I really enjoy the subtle complexity of this beer. There is a well-rounded malt bill here that gives the palate something to contemplate. I can pick up a bit of hops, but they support the roast as much as actually contributing to the flavor. This is a nice beer, and one that I am sure that I will drink again."
"Quite a nice porter, and certainly definitive of an English style porter."
"D - extremely tasty porter, a classic. Very robust. Moderate to low alcohol makes this a very drinkable session porter."
"Simply, it's an impressive blend of history and tradition, mixed with wonderful flavor and presence. It's a joy to drink one, and as much a joy to drink another, and in fact, the anticipation is almost a force unto itself. Not many beers can boast of being a style's blueprint, but this one is just that, and more."
"This is a really pleasent porter that would be easy to sit back and sip all night long. Tastes good at cellar temp, tastes good at room temp, and has plenty going for it. Definitely something I'd drink again."
"1 pt., .9 fl. oz. bottle, a week past its ""best before"" date (26 February 2006). Deep translucent red -- almost purple -- leaning towards brown: like cherry cola with a frothy beige foam cap. Nose of sweetish roasty malts, caramel and vinous fruit aromas. Thin to medium bodied, the roasted malts flavor in this porter are much more subdued than anticipated. There is primarily a vinous cherry flavor (bordering on sour), with a smoky-charred character towards the end. Mineral finish. Earthy hop flavors and roastiness emerge as the beer warms. Very easy to drink, but I think it's probably better closer to room temperature. I wonder if this is ever served on cask...probably (?)...never been to London. Anyway, classy beer. Recommend."
"This pours a nice dark color out of the bottle, approaching black but not there. The smell is faintly of malts. The head is nice and foamy but very short lived. The taste is malty, in a dissapointingly singular way. A nice example of a porter to give a try but not worthy of searching out."
"Overall- Fuller's London Porter is pretty much what a porter should be. This one is close to a sweet or coffee stout, but it's damn good."
"Love it."
"Engine-oil colored with a nice puffy head. This is a great example of a smooth, English session beer. The taste doesn't knock you over with a bounty of flavors, but that's fine and intentional. The beer is smoooth and well-balanced, rewarding you more with each sip. There's a slight astringency, which is the only think that kept me from giving it a 5 for drinkability. The flavors that are there are just right, particularly the unexpected chocolate flavor. The mouthfeel is nice, no sharp carbonation or thick creaminess--just an even, reasonably substational body."
"Had this on tap and Barleyhoppers in Riverview. This is a blackish dark brown color that is easy to get lost in. Pours a nice tan head on top that hung around to the bottom leaving a cocoa colored lacing. Nice. This is a sweet malty smelling brew that sets my mouth watering. This had a nice roasty coffee flavor. It made me regret not drinking more porters as I often bypass them as being rather heavy. This was not. It had a nice mouthfeel and was very drinkable."
"The London Porter pours out a deep, dark brown color with a two finger head. It leaves very nice lacing on the glass, too. Instantly, you can smell the chocolate and malt. It manages that chocolate taste without coming off too sweet. It wasn't very heavy for a porter. It really went down smooth. When I finished it I really wished I had another one on hand. Very Good!"
"Drinkability: Verry High....I can't wait to recomend to some of my buds."
"Taste is toffee, espresso, bitter cocoa, and some smokey campfire elements. Bit of a bitter, sour aftertaste which lowered the taste score for me a bit. Mouthfeel is slightly thinner than I'd like for this style. Still a great beer though! Wish it was more widely available here!"
"Overall, this is my first porter, and I thought I would start out with a traditional and well reputed one. Could definately imagine myself sipping on quite a few of these in Londontown during the cold, rainy season of fall in a dark, dank pub and throwing some darts. Very delicious, but in a sort of an understated way. Englishness through and through, and I look forward to trying some more."
"I bet this would be murder served from a cask. From the bottle it is still a fine ale with a great deal of depth and a complexity of flavors that I have trouble picking apart."
"An extremely drinkable porter. My favorite from the UK."
"drinkbility - the best! its complex enough to drink tons of while staying interesting and good yet a low enough abv to drink alot of without getting trashed. very good beer, i like it."
"Drinkability --> This was an exceptional beer and matches wonderfully with chocolate dessert! It's exactly what I would expect from a great Porter. This is a definite must try!"
"I was very impressed by this beer and would recommend it. Strong but goes down smooth. Appearance wise it has the properties of a traditional ale and has a sweet aroma."
"Nonetheless a tasty offering. Deep, complex chocolate and roasted malt flavor. A little flat on the nose, slight wafts of cherry. A smooth beaut on a cold evening. Goes down easy in front of a roaring fire. At $3.00 a bottle, it's good to go."
"Medium bodied and thoroughly enjoyable"
"Drinkability: Very good. Enough taste and feel to be substantial but not so much that it fills you up, or is a chore to finish."
"Classic Porter smell and look with a deep black body supporting a firm, two finger thick, mocha head. Roasted chocalate overtones and great malty, toasty and roasty mouthfeel. Well rounded and balanced with ample chocolate and coffee notes. Worthy of its praise."
"Notes: This is a nicely done to say the least. You must try this at least once, more for taste than for the whole package."
"I was a bit sad when I poured this brew and virtually no head developed. The surface had some frothiness which mostly stayed in a ring around the inside of the glass. The color is like black coffee. The smell is faint, but you can detect chocolate, coffee beans, and marshmallow aromas. Very toasty. The taste is similar, with coffee flavor that is somewhat smoky. Decent bitterness. It seems average at first but improves very much over a few sips. The mouthfeel is slightly thinner than expected, and the carbonation is fairly low, although it doesn't necessarily feel flat. The overall flavor is solid and while not one of the best I've had, it seems like a beer that I could easily have a few rounds of, especially with the moderate alcohol content."
"Cheers..."
"Excellent beer"
"This beer pours a clear, slightly orange brown with a small tan head that left spotty clumps of lace. Smells sweet and tangy like caramel and a touch of green apple with the malt reminding me of a slightly roasted Dopplebock. Tastes of slight chocolate and coffee with a subtle, smooth and sweet sourness that finishes with just a touch of dry hop. Mouth feel is medium bodied with light carbonation. For such a strong flavor, I was surprised at how easily this went down"
"Deep chestnut nearly black. Fizzy head goes down to 1/4", pauses for a bit, then turns to gray wisps. The aroma of this beer is amazingly strong for a 5% non-hoppy brew! Stong and appetizing, it screams coffee and red wine to me. One of the few malt-centered beers that I could whiff all day long. Flavor is wonderful too. Charcoal and molasses, coffee and red wine. All I could ask for in a porter. Thin body and low carbonation is pulled off with help from the dryness and acidity. Very easy drinking, this one has a ton of flavor but is not as filling as most stouts or other malt-centric beers. A classic for all time!"
" This is an outstanding product from Fuller's. I wish I could try it on cask across the pond some time soon, like this summer. If not, the bottle is not too shabby."
"(16.9 oz. bottle emb with lots of brewery info)"
"This is a fine tasting porter, a real classic, but in my opinion it just doesn't hold a candle to Sam Smith's Taddy Porter. The biggest difference was the presence of some slightly ""off"" flavors late in the sip in the Fullers. Very nice beer for cold winter nights - warming and delicious. Definitely worth a try, recommended, but I do think there are better English porters out there."
"This beer almost perfectly matches what you see with what you taste. What you expect with what you experience. It is quite possible the perfect porter. Amazing."
"Well this was spot on for a porter. Dark and brown-black with a tanish head giving up lacing. Nice smell of toffee malty goodness meshed with some nice noble hops. Good from the first sip, tastes of dark roasted malt with a tinge of sweetness to round it out and a nice little bit of hops that leave there own floral taste. Well-rounded and very nice a good beer anytime."
"I just got a good deal on a 12 pack of imperial pints for only $10.99, only because the sell by date was a few months old. I don't care that's damn cheap. And I might just pick up about 5 more of those cases after drinking this bad boy."
"Very smooth and creamy. If you like Porter's, this one definitely hit's the mark."
"I think this is an excellent example of a porter. A very pleasant session beer. I can't wait to finish the rest of my 6 pack."
"This beer poured a very dark brown that looks nearly opaque. It formed a moderate sized head that was a dark tan and dissipated gradually. The smell was of coffee, chocolate and caramel, with some slight fruitiness. The taste was excellent, with coffee and chocolate being the dominant flavours, and the fruitiness coming through in the finish. Feels substantial in the mouth, but not so thick as to be difficult to drink. Great drinkability, just a wonderful porter all around."
"This is the benchmark of the English Porter style. Tasty, well balanced, and exceedingly well crafted. Delectable drinkability."
"D- This is an amazing porter. The flavors of fresh grain add up to make a wonderful smooth complexity. The slight sweetness is just perfect to bring out the softer flavors with out tasting syrupy."
"Taste is excellent. Chocolatey and roasted goodness. Some hop bitterness. Pretty well balanced. Delicious."
"Thanks to Fred for sharing this beauty!"
"This beer is very drinkableso tasty, and light enough in body to make it a sheer pleasure to quaff."
"Drinkability: This is a great example of how a porter should be done in my opinion. There are better out there I think, but I'll certainly be having this again. Quality ingredients and a quality brew."
"What make this porter special is the huge drinkability inherent in its black veins. It has all the roasted malts and such but the smoothness is not a lack of body but rather a perfect balance of all inside. Malty and creamy the finish is dryish with real lingering flavour. The dark cousin of the ESB."
"Overall, rock solid and recommended. Regrettably, my last time in the UK, they only had Pride on cask. This would be even more enjoyable in that manner"
"BBD of 06-27-05, but I don't really think this suffered too much for it's age. The shop I bought it at takes good care of their high-end ales."
"I had to edit this as I've been drinking this more and more lately, its become my favorite beer...Cheers!"
"Quite drinkable. One of the better english porters I've had, and highly recommended."
"Fun Beer to drink, Oh so drinkable!!! Great English Porter!!"
"Drinkability: Very easy to drink, but I think this might come at the expense of the taste, which deserves to be a little denser and richer than it is. Overall, though, my senses were satisfied without being overwhelmed. Very nice!"
"Overall: Quite a fine porter, and one that I'll take any time."
"Thick and dark (reddish-brown that nearly borders on black) with a frothy tan head. This beer has an intense chocolate aroma. Theres considerable malt, with a lightly roasted (again, chocolaty) smell. At times theres a little distracting smell that seems slightly like burnt grain. All in all, the aroma is amazing. Little hops, and very little fruitiness in the smell. The first sip reveals that this beer is full and satiating. Very creamy (at times, with the big chocolate aroma, it seems almost like a thick chocolate milk). The brew dries out by the finish, which is just bitter enough to offer some balance. The finish opens up and thins out a little, making the beer very drinkable. This is extraordinarily good stuff."
"D: Quite good, but it's a little bold for a session beer."
"The taste was the same as the smell only reinforced. Lovely malty, chocolaty, coffee thing going on that made drinking this a real pleasure. Time doesn't seem to have hurt this one too much at all."
"D: This is the best porter that I've had, and it comes at a great price. I will be drinking copius amounts of this in the future."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: I dont think that Fullers can make a bad beer  this is further proof of that. Distinctive, recognizable flavors, smoothness, that yearning for malted chocolate milk  cant think of a more wonderful way to spend an evening."
"This brew pours a dark black color with a creamy light tan head that recedes quickly. The aroma is perfect. Creamy chocolate with undertones of roased malt and coffee. The taste lives up to the expectations the aroma inspired. Chocolate and roasted malt engulf my whole mouth with each sip. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, medium bodied, and with ample carbonation. Overall, this is a great beer. Perhaps, even the perfect session beer."
"This is a wonderful taste experience. It pours a perfectly dark black chocolately coffee appearance that exceeds even Guinness. Smell is that of roasted coffee, exceptional. Taste is pretty good, bitter, with pronounced hints of mocha. It has a very thick consistency, somewhat heavy but still really good. Overall this is pretty drinkable, very nice change from ordinary beer that is for sure."
"A very well balanced treat, this porter plays it's varying flavours off one another beautifully. Fuller's London Porter is a fine example of a beer that is full of flavour, but doesn't go overboard or ""extreme"" with any particular aspect. Highly recommended."
"overall: very nice english porter. daddy likey. plenty of flavor to reward the palate, but not overwhelming. highly recommended."
"D: What more can I say about this beer... simply gorgeous~~ with such a glass of full-flavoured porter retaining a refreshing body and dryish aftertaste, it doesn't take a great Porter fan to fully appreciate its fullness and complexity--look what's happened to me!"
"Almost black with color with a tall light tan head of foam. Some scattered lace was left as the head held together nicely. Chocolate malt with a big roastiness and smokiness taking over. A good bit of sweetness underneath all that roast as well. Sweet caramel and lightly bitter dark chocolate flavors up front. After that the huge roasted flavors take over with a light smokiness as well. Finishes out on a lingering roasty and dark chocolate note. Pretty slick and creamy feel to it but could use a bit more body. Easily drinkable and sessionable. Lots of flavor packed in here and it stays interesting."
"Nice drinkable porter here. I do believe the Samuel Smith's version is better though."
"Drinkability: One fine porter that really blossoms as the beer warms"
"Not enough alcohol for a night capper and the metallic and astringent finish does not work for me."
"Cheers."
"This is a milestone of a beer. Much like a strong stout without the roasted grain bitterness, but with sweet dark fruits. Pours black with a soft tan head (like whipped cream for the beer lover). Smells solidly of dark grains, chocolate, and coffee. A mild tartness comes through, much like raspberries. Tastes sweetly of chocolate, dark grain, toast, coffee, and a little cream like. Add in slight raspberry and plumb flavors. A mild sourness runs through, maybe lactic acid; albeit light. Body is silky smooth, yet bold. Finishes sweet and lingering. A must-drink for porter lovers."
"I guess this may be the first time I've had Fuller's Porter in the past year, although it is relatively available in the area. Paid $3.50 for a bottle tonight, which is about the same price you can find at the grocery store for a single. Deep brown with nice chocolate, caramel, and coffee smell and tatse. I've tasted better porter's but few compare in their drinkability. Nice lacing and not too heavy."
"This porter poured a black color with brown near the edges. The foam was creamy and light brown, and it settled but coated the glass and left lace. The smell was malty, with notes of roated malt and light chocolate malt. The taste was malty with very light roastiness and light chocolate with a hint of licorice and a very light hoppiness. The mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy with medium-full body and low carbonation feel. The finish and aftertaste were dry and malty. This was a very nice pint and was very drinkable."
"On this beers birth certificate the name reads Elegance E. Porter. Incredible. The entire package is complimentary. Home run."
"Drinkability: A good beer to just sit around and drink. Interesting, just a little out of balance in my taste."
"I can see why this is the top BA choice for porters, and it is definitely a favorite style."
"At last - the elusive London Porter is mine! 500 ml bottle, bought in Denmark. Very dark reddish brown colour, large tan head. Aroma is first and foremost dark chocolate, but also rye bread, leather and oak. Flavour is again chocolate on a nice roasty background, decent hops linger in the aftertaste. Clearly a first class beer - Im sure its even better cask conditioned."
"The only dissapointing aspect of this particular Ale was the head. Other than that it was spectacular. The smell was very complex with chocolate, roasted coffee along with slight sweetness of berry. The flavor was right in line with the smell and the mouthfeel was an appropriate carbonation. I could drink far too many of these in one sitting. Yikes. Better keep me away from Jack Quinn's."
"Ahem.. Yes, moving on, mouthfeel is good, it's got a light carbonation that cuts through the sweet/syrupy taste so that it doesn't become like actual syrup. A nice refreshing tingle on the tongue, and not too thin either. Just right. Drinkability, well I'd say it's quite good, even on this hot hot night, though I would say it'd be better suited for a winter evening or something like that. Anyway, it is easy drinking, smooth and never boring. Something I do not regret buying a whole case of, which is a good thing, considering that is the most likely way I'd be able to get this one around my area. A good one!"
"It poured a dark brown almost black with a thick tan head. The head receded quickly and there was no lace. Light aroma with roast malt a bit of chocolate and hard candy. The flavor has roast malt coffee sweet candy and a mild smoke finish. Smooth slick mouth feel. Decent drinkability. This was the most stout-like porter Ive ever had (Im not a huge stout fan), yet, I found this to be uninspiring."
"Pours a jet black with slight ruby highlights and a thick tan head. Incredible aroma of chocolate, roasted coffee, spicy fuggles hops and toffee. Taste is complex melding of roaste and sweet flavors, roasted and bitter coffee beans and sweet chocolate and blackstrap molasses. Also hints of burnt toffee and that signature english fuggles hops flavor. Mouthfeel is creamy with a medium body and light carbonation. The drinkability is quite good, an excellent porter."
"Worth trying."
"Overall, not bad. I don't think that I will be buying this again, but that shouldn't stop you."
"Very full body. Very full flavor. Goes down quite smooth. One hell of a beer."
"Taste is quite satisfying. This brew has a medium body with a chewy base that coats the palate nicely. Chocolate notes are evident as is a slight tinge of coffee. Hops warm up the middle but soon vanish as the brew takes on a smooth smoky-chocolate finish. A solid porter no doubt."
"I intend to find out."
"Drinkabality is great on this porter!"
"This is a highly drinkable porter which always has and always will stay in my regular rotation of beers. Highly recommended to any beer lover."
"Pours a rich dark red/brown, big creamy head and leaves some generous lace. Smell is rich coffee roast, bitter chocolate, very tasty. Taste is really full deep chocolate up front, with a bitter coffee finish. My only complaint with this beer is that the mouthfeel is a little thin for the porters I like, but its still smooth and satisfying."
"Pours a dark rich brown, has a malty chocolate smell something that you could just sniff all day. I let this one warm up a bit which did wonders for the smell and taste on the tongue. Once it hit the palate it tasted of rich dark coffee, chocolate, and slight tabacco...a beer that would pair very well with english candies such as (Picnic, Twirl, or Flake)"
"Her taste is magnificient sorry but im falling in love with this beer, either it is the bottle of wine(yup I did drink wine, yes yes I will burn in beer hell for eternity). First thing you notice when you open your mouth to enjoy this beer is the aromas of roasted coffee, then caramel, some maltish flavours are present but everything is end up with a roasted coffee taste and a finish of butterscotch. Some notes of dark chocolate are also present but a bit too shy to my desire!"
"Overall an outstanding porter. I believe the reason I love this so much is that it's not trying to encroach into 'stout' territory. It seems the porters today are harder to discern from a stout. Very elegant and stylistic, but still an ale for the common man/woman. A porter of utmost class and distinction."
"Bottle dated 25/JUN/05"
"A nice, easy to drink Porter, that tastes more potent than it's listed 5.4%abv. Decadent!"
"Fuller's London Porter pours a lovely dark amber with a tan head and lacing that snaps, crackles and pops. Chocolate and toffee aromas dominate and foreshadow its flavor. At first, the carbonation dances inside your mouth, that gives way to a chewy, yet smooth texture. This porter is roasted, toasty, chocolatey goodness that's more than quaffable. Spot on."
"Yeah, baby! From the great deep, clear, mahogany brown pour with tan head that laced, to the intense chocolate malt aroma, this ones a winner. Sips tasted malty with powdery burnt toast/charcoal, and finished hoppy. Rich, full bodied  thinning as it warms. Defiantly a smooth porter to quaff and judge others."
"Not a bad beer, but I wont search it out again. Wouldnt turn it away either."
"great beer, sorry i hadn't had it until now. probably better with food. on it's on a 500ml bottle is a bit much at once. something to keep the palate clean would allow the flavour to stay fresh. by the end of the bottle it's a bit sour."
"This was a great little treat, nice and complex."
"A really enjoyable porter with absolutely superlative flavor!"
"Pours out dark brew with light showing through ruby coloring.Nice 1-2 finger head that hangs around for a little bit.My smell is off today but coffee definitely coming through. Taste is dry with dominant coffee that lingers. I could drink a few of these.Mouthfeel is just ok a little thin. Definitely one of the best porters ive had,i drank the whole thing before i finished typing this review."
"Very easy to drink and great to enjoy as I did here, as a dessert in and of itself. Not an outstanding porter, but certainly an all-around solid one that I will soon revisit."
"I'd put this among the most pleasant beers I've had. Not a beer to be missed."
"Drinkability- Good flavors and scent, the carbonation kind threw me for a loop though. Otherwise a very decent porter."
"Much better mouthfeel and body on tap than from the bottle. Luscious chocolate, licorice, coffee aromas, matched by the taste. Appears almost opaque, with deep ruby highlights, tan head. Roasty, caramel flavours. Palatable, easy drinking, well balanced. Easily my favourite porter. Nothing beats fuller's london porter for me."
"I'm really impressed with Fuller's. I've only recently been trying their beers but they really are a fantastic brewery producing unique beers. This porter isn't as dark as others I've seen, a bit of red showing through the edges of the glass. Smell is strong bitter coffe, roasted malts, and something that oddly reminds me of those little bacon bits things. Odd, because I've been a vegetarian since 8th grade. But strangely interesting. Taste is nice and bitter, unusual for a porter. It's got a nice hoppy backbone, which I usually don't notice in English beers, which I've just recently gotten into. Of course all the roasty toasty qualities of a typical porter are there too, and in full effect. Nice dark bitter malts and creamy undertones. A medium bodied porter like this goes down effortlessly. Another great brew from a classic English brewery. Between their ESB, 1845, and Porter, which I've all just recently tried, I'll be supporting Fuller's a lot in the near future."
"Pours out very dark, pretty much black with a small head. Nutty aroma and taste that reminded me of Guinness in a way. Very smooth beer, easy on the palate, and extremely drinkable. Went great with an American Pasty. Not too complex, but definitely drinkable. Very dark, even for a porter. Would like to try again, possibly from a bottle next time."
"Deep dark brown, small amount of carbonation. The aroma is strong, coffee, molasses, a little licorice. Taste is smooth and smoky, more coffee, with licorice toward the end. Mouthfeel was full, flavors keep things in place for a long finish. Nothing overpowering, balanced between the malts and bitterness. I could see drinking two or three of these after dinner with a good book in the cigar chair."
"Very nice looking brew. Not straight black, rather a deep,deep mahogony that one can see through and a creamy white head. The aroma is subtle, but very good. mostly coffee bean notes along with a few fruity esters. The taste...wow. This is by far one of the tastiest beers i've had in awhile. Strong coffee,malted milk, some lactose type sweetness, and a very slight butterscotch kick in the finish....just all around yummy. And the finish is good and dry. Great slick mouthfeel with tiny bubbles, making this one drinkable brew, regardless of style....awesome!"
"Overall just a really wonderful English Porter. If you get a chance to have it on tap, don't pass it up. It's good in the bottle, but the draft is just splendid."
"They recently got this on cask and beer engine at my local pub, so I had to try it. It poured a very dark color with red around the edges, a small head that had really good retention and left a little lacing on the sides of the glass. The aroma is very subdued. Lots of chocolate flavors with a small bit of coffee in the back. Slightly bitter finish. Very clean. Thick and creamy body. Drinkability on this one was wonderful. I'm not sure how it is out of the bottle, but I'm sure I'll be finding out really soon."
"Overall, this is a darn good porter. I've been meaning to try it for a while now, but this single I bought by mistake (I thought I had grabbed a London Pride). I'm glad I did. Although it's not super-special, it's definitely worth a try, more than once in a while. A nice break from those big winter brews."
"I love this beer and will readily chose it when I'm in the mood for a tasty and hearty beer, however its cost does influence me at times. I like to enjoy this with spicy foods like wings or chili, it's a good contrast and cuts the heat if I need it. Highly recommended for all occasions though."
"Kind of what I expected of this. Nice beer though. Pours a ruby tinted dark chocolate color. Very little head and some wispy foam on top. Leaves no lace. Some dark roasted malt and vinous character too. Pretty good on a winter night. Tastes like a basic porter should. Similar to the nose--dark roasted malt, chocolate caramel coffee profile not nearly as bitter as some porters. Mouthfeel is nothing noteable but good still. This thing excels in drinkability--very smooth not too high on the ABV--a pretty nice example of this style."
"A fantastic example of an english porter, everything you could ever want from a porter. I had this with profiteroles and it complemented them beyond belief, fantastic"
"An excellent porter all around. This is one of the more popular beers by Fuller's, and for a good reason: it's damn good. Can pair-up easily with anything meaty. And even though this particular bottle is over a year expired, it still tastes just as good as it always does."
"from the bottle best before 10/17/04. pured a deep mahogany, with a nice tan head. aroma bitter sweet chocolate, toffee, roasted malts, plums and prunes, hard time taking my nose away from this one. flavor, toffee, chocolate, raisins, honey, malts, cherries. mouthfeel was a nice and smooth and just enough bitterness"
"Well, this one is a classic, not sure why I have taken so long to write some notes on this one. On tap at 'bones. Very black, low head. Aroma is low and roasty. Medium body, this one is all about the malt. There's some pleasant roasty flavors, followed by a low hop finish. The beer does exactly what's expected with having any over the top notes or sore thumbs sticking out."
"The mouthfeel is smooth initially but has a but of a bite right after you swallow. Overall an easy drinking beer with a lot of taste."
"Pours a velvety black with an ample head that laces down the glass. Aroma of chocolate and raisins, the taste was full of rich malt gliding across the palate. The mouthfeel was a bit thin but the porter was very easy drinking. This is the only porter I could call quaffable. Overall a fine porter but I wished it was a bit more hoppy for my taste."
"Pours pitch-black with a light brown head that dissipates quickly into a thin veil. Very little lacing. Smells sweet and malty, toasted grains, cocoa and espresso. Taste is full of chocolate, coffe, and dark roasted malts. There is a modest hop flavor but it's enough to provide balance. Light mouthfeel with smooth and light carbonation. A yummy porter that is fit to drink all night long."
"I could definitely drink three or four of these, but it can be overwhelming to some. Like a true porter, almost a meal in itself."
"On tap.Dark brown, nearly black with some slight ruby highlights. Very thin wispy head. No retention. Not much lace on the glass. Slight chocolate and roast smell. Also notes of charcoal. Nice rich roast flavor with a hint of coffee. Slight hop bitterness to help balance out the beer. Medium body, low carbonation. Overall a good beer. Nice example of the English style. Good drinkability."
"A great choice for a Fall/Winter night yet packed with flavor to enjoy year round. This drinks a lot like a stout, but it's light enough on the palate and tasty enough to drink as a nice session porter. Worth a try."
"Porters and stouts are among the beers I'm least inclined to drink much of, but there's a lot of good stuff to appreciate in this one."
"The aromas of chocolate and tobacco make this beer irresistible. I have never experienced a beer that smells like this. I am very impressed by this porter. The flavor is soft and balanced and bitter dark chocolate dominates, with just enough hops to dry up the finish. This is a very well balanced porter and I will be revisiting this beer often."
"This beer served to warm up my beer sense this evening. It poured a very dark brown, with just hints of ruby coming through and without any head and no ring around the top of the beer. The nose is really nice full of coffee and hints of chocolate. I really like this one. The taste is outstanding. It starts out very much chocolate and fades to a really nice bitter coffee. There is just a touch of hop bite to let you know it is there as well. The feel is moderate to thick, pretty good for the style. The drinkability is as good as it gets. The is one of the best porters I have ever had. I will definately be trying this beer again soon."
"Overall an excellent beer."
"This is a great beer."
"mid sized bottle, with best before dating. Pours darkest of browns. Rich chocolaty nose. Minimal off white head, some light lacing. Medium body and light carbonation. Chewy mouthfeel, lots going on here. Lots of chocolate, expresso and mocho flavors. Classic of the style, wonderful tasty brew. Great with BBQ."
"Pours a clear, dark brown with an off-white head that subsides quickly. The aroma is of sweet malt balanced by a dry, burnt black malt aroma with no hops to be detected. The taste is very flavorful as the dark malts are no the only thing to be tasted in this beer. Porter was a blend of stale/old ale and new pale ale and brown ale, if this is to be a single sytle that incorporates all three then i will say that i believe iot could be true. The dark malts give us the brown aleish character as well as the dry, sharp stale ale flavor while possesing more hops than a stout so we can attribute these flavors to the pale aleness. With a rich malt profile the dark malts dont; overpower this brew due to a sweet maltiness that is hard to percieve as it blends into the whole malt flavor. A bit of hop flavor in the mix keeps thing interesting so that it is clear this is not a stout. Light carbonation lends a smooth mouthfeel to this beer and it is a nice porter that would make a pretty good session beer as well."
"Pours black with a decent head that laces the glass as it recedes. The head is dense but settles quickly. The aroma is of rich chocolate - not the type in most candy bars - and coffee grounds. The taste is great, more chocolate than coffee and a very smooth mouthfeel with a creamy finish. Highly drinkable too. I haven't had a porter before and this sat in my fridge for two weeks because I didn't think I'd like it but this is an awesome brew."
"On tap at Pub Italia in Ottawa, ON. Dark black with ruby edges and a ruddy brown head that lasts and leaves nice lacing as well. Aromas are all deep roastd malts, chocolate, espresso, green herbal hops, and biscuity breads. The taste is a wonderful blend of espresso flavors, green herbal hops, biscuity malts and lovely roasted flavors. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and nice, but noticeably inferior to the cask version of this beauty. The drinkability, as always, is excellent. Quite a good pint on tap, but simply sublime in it's cask conditioned form."
"Very dark brown color with dark amber highlights and a nice cap of fine, dense tan head that laces quite well. Aromas of toasted malts and caramel highlight the rich, soft nose. Unexpected light crispeness at the start of the taste quickly yields to roasted flavors than then share the stage with nicely incorporated bitterness. While the smell and taste are quite full, the mouthfeel is pleasantly balanced, which goes a long way in making this an exceedingly drinkable porter."
"This is an excellent brew that is very drinkable. Probably would do well with a newbie drinker that can handle a little roastiness."
"This is a complex tasting porter that blends chocolate, molasses, caramel, coffee, and smokey malt flavors together. Very enjoyable."
"Overall, I was expecting a lot from this, and was very disappointed. I've had much better porters. I wonder if I had a bad bottle - it is 3 months before the best by date though."
"Had on tap at the British brewing company, Hyannis MA. Nice dark brown / black body with a creamy off white head. There is a dark roasted malt smell, with a hint of coffee. The beginning is what you would expect from a porter, a roasted malt type flavor which leads to a certain malty sweetness in the middle. The aftertaste is light and of coffee. The mouth feel at the end is water which leads to a high drink ability, smooth and almost creamy. They way that all the flavors blend smoothly and subtly together in this beer is what makes it great. One that will fool people who dont know that dark beer doesnt necessarily mean strong and bold flavors. This is what I would call a perfect intro to porters."
"Drinkability  Could this be more drinkable than it already is? No, I think not."
"Pours a deep, dark brown, with a minimal tan head. A very lifeless head. Aroma is of coffee, some chocolate, and pipe tobacco. Taste is very winey, yet coffee-like. A little on the bitter side. Finishes dry with charcoal notes. Creamy, yet prickly mouthfeel. This is a nice porter. Not in my top five, but still quite good all around."
"Full roast character. Bitter espresso, with fruity accents swirling around. A decent chocolate note, and a short dry finish. Medium bodied, moderate carbonation."
"Drinkability/Overall: Smooth, complex, and easy to drink. Very good!."
"London Porter sits comfortably in the British pint glass, giving out dark ebony and super-dark red hues, looking thick and syrupy. The head is a copious, creamy, thick and viscous light-brown foam. The lacing sticks very well, leaving a screen of fine bubbles, and scarcely moving at all. The appearance is excellent by any standard, but, at the same time, I have seen many porters that look just as impressive. Rich is the word to describe the aroma: yes, rich, robust, heavy, full, nutritious, earthy, and very sustaining. A warm creamy smell greeted my nose first, next vanilla, strong dark licorice, then the chocolate/coffee malt. The aroma definitely exudes a literal warmness; small wonder this is a perfect brew for the colder season. Raisins, milk/cream, vanilla, mollasses, definite butter, with deep grain and malt. The taste is also full and robust. Sweet chocolate, coffee beans, mollasses, slight milky tartness, and on the finish chalky, grainy feelings; dusty, with a fitting hop dryness. The alcohol shows up in the finish as well, warming the stomach nicely. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth and buttery, almost oil-like slickness. This creaminess makes it easy to drink, though the dryness in the finish might become excessive after too many, not to mention the fullness it leaves in the stomach(which is a good thing). Well, I tried this out of season, in the hellish heat of July; perhaps this winter I will visit London Porter again. Right now, however, it rates high for me, but not as high as others I have tried. I cannot help but point to Samuel Smith, though I hate comparing. Something in the beers of SM, the water perhaps, make them far more complex than any other brewer of good darks in Britain right now. Still, Fuller's has not disappointed me in the in least with this, though I prefer their ESB and London Pride."
"Rich, deep brown/black color, with foamy. mocha colored head. Very strong coffee crounds aroma. Same scent as if you were to take a wiff of used coffee grounds. Very thick feel, almost creamy. Strong coffee and roasted malt flavor in both the front taste and the finish. Hardly no carbonation, which fits well. Missing the chocolate taste to round it out, but it has it in the feel."
"I think I understand porter a whole lot better now."
"On a rereview of a fresh .5 L bottle, I got a very nice, big head with lots of carbonation, so maybe the other bottle was old or something... I've bumped up Appearance half a point. Very nice beer."
"A really good porter, though I am not sure I will visit this one again in the near future."
"Dark brown with deep ruby highlights. Generous light brown head disappeared rather quickly leaving a thin lace on top of the beer and on the sides of the glass. The aroma is very reminiscent of coffee, with strong roasted barley, dark malts and slight graininess. The roasted and dark malts shine through in the flavour, but are nicely balanced by bitterness. Hints of chocolate and molasses. Full bodied with a velvety smooth texture. The finish is dry and has the flavour of roasted malt grains, but without the astringency that often accompanies it. Definitely a world class porter."
"Beer pours a deep dark black abyss that has a beautiful tan head that is amazing to see. Smell is of brown sugar and molasses, dark chocolate and mocha/coffee smells linger that will melt your heart. Taste is very sweet, brown sugar and molasses/caramel forefront, with roasted malt/coffee aftertones. Beer is light enough where you can drink it in the heat but thick enough to feel you up after a nice meal. Full bodied but smooth and slick as butter, goes down very nicely. Probably the best porter I've had to date, when you are done you will wish you had more."
"Pours a black/brown with a nice foamy tan head. Not much going on in the smell department but I did pick up hints of malt and carmel. The taste is where this beer really shines. I like the balance of roasted malts, coffee, and a little sweetness. The carbonation adds a nice balance to all the flavoring and makes it easy drinking. I had to be careful because this was so smooth and went down so easy. I really enjoyed this beer. This is a great example of a porter and I would definitely recommend it."
"A solid after dinner porter. Perhaps a little light for my liking but certainly worth the adventure. Pours deep red/brown with little head and even less lacing. The real gem of this porter is the aroma. Wafting sents of coffee bean and dark chocolate are very apparent but not too overwhelming. Lacks the richness of taste and robustness for a post dinner sipping drink but is still very palate friendly. Little to no aftertaste to speak of and the lack of hardiness helps you almost crave another (Or at least another smell)"
"Overall a great beer. Even though it is fairly rich it makes a good session beer."
"Poured almost black, but transparent with a rich amber when held up to the light. Not much of a head, the tiny one that did show up only lasted a few seconds and was gone. Lacing was spotty, kind of disappointing. This beer smelled great, with a mixture of caramel sweetness, and an earthiness that reminded me of wet leaves. Caramel flavor came through big mixed with a hint of roastiness, and chocolate. I've had a few porters that tasted more like stouts to me, but this one had no identity issues. I did get a little tired of the caramel flavors towards the end of the glass, but this beer still remains a great porter."
"The taste starts off with a huge rush of coffee flavors that coat the mouth. It turns slightly sweet, taste of carmel much as the smell, and finishs quite dry with a bit of smokieness at the very end."
"The aroma is a deep dark roasted espresso bean that is nearly burnt, awesome. There are also faint malt and caramel whiffs here. When I drank this, there was again espresso, but with chocolate and hints of malt. Nice slight bitterness in the finish that was perfect with a great crisp after taste. Nice thick mouthfeel that's chewy and refreshing. Great drinkability, no matter what time of the day. As a testament to that last statement, I had this for breakfast the other day and the coffee flavors complimented the time of day perfectly. Note: review not written from the morning session...but it was just as good"
"I find this very drinkable and could easily have a few of these, although I hope future ones will have a bit more head to look better."
"Dark mahogany color, almost non-translucent. Tan head that fades into a solid layer on the top of the beer. Raisins, coffee, chocolate, alcohol, a lot going on in the nose. Taste is wonderfully rich. Chocolate and coffee tones dominate. Hop sare not an afterthought in this beer, however. Thick mouthfeel. Excellent beer, and a very good random selection at the liquor store."
"Damn fine beer, but the heavy coffee flavor would prevent enjoying more than one or two. Would go great with any chocolate or coffee dessert."
"A ruby black up to the light appears a reddish brown. There is definite lacing from the 1/2"" tan head on the glass though it faded quickly. The smell is caramelly sweet, with almost no hoppyness. My first impressions are of roasted nuts, kind of a roasted peanut flavor. Only bitterness i can tell is during the long lingering aftertaste. No really this one has a very LONG lasting aftertaste, which the roasty flavor is predominate. Carbonation is light and nonintrusive, making this porter delicious as an after-dinner or dessert beer."
"Presentation is an imperial pint glass, with an excellent 3/4"" super-dense nitro head over the medium brown brew. Laced excellently with foam coated the glass sides from top to bottom at the end of the drinking experience. Aroma is medium and dark malts, even apparent through the nitro head. Taste was of the malt, then softened with an almost perfect complementary amount of hops. This brew impressed me by being able to blast its flavor through the normally deadening nitro presentation. This ability combined with the nitro-smoothing effect made the mouthfeel and drinkability tops in my book."
"Zum wohl!"
"This is the gold standard of Porters, the one by which all others should be judged. Its ruby black with a big tan head. Roasty malt, earthy, chocolatey, coffeeish, delicately hoppy, aromas. The taste is very smooth and rich but not overly rich. There is good malt sweetness in the front with a complex array of other flavors (coffee, chocolate, licorice) in the end there is subtle hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is on the watery side of creamy (whatever that means) and is very excellent. strongly reccommended."
"This one poured a deep and dark reddish brown. At first the beer seems opaque, but when held up to the light, the beer reveals its clarity. Thin creamy head topped the beer off. The aroma is dark and rich with roasted coffee and sweet toffee notes and dark fruits. The taste yields sweet chewy caramel and syrupy molasses. Sort of reminds me of cough syrup. Theres some bittersweet chocolates in there, too. Strong bodied that finishes with a dark and chocolate bitterness and a pleasant sweetness. A fine porter that has a lot to offer."
"I had the immense please of celebrating St. George's day at the Grey Lodge Pub in Philly. A very rare appearance of Fuller's on-tap. This beer is quite impressive. Off of the bottle, the coffee flavors are more powerful. On-tap, less so. But I'm rounding up. However, the flavor profile was still pretty good and in a weird way made it more drinkable. Looks great too. It was dark and a creamy head. This is an incredibly good beer from a world-class brewery."
"Dark brown body, almost no head, what is there is tan and leaves fast. You really have got to let this warm to appreciate the flavors. The nose is very chocolatey with vanilla and dark fruits. Palate is slightly grapey vinous with lots of plums, chocolate and a nice restrained roasty bitter finish. Hints of coffee and licorice in the finish. Smooth medium mouthfeel with friendly cleaning carbonation. Complex malt flavors as it warms and remarkably balanced."
"One of my favorite porters, and I don't really love them."
"The beer is so good, it's like drinking a good strong version of coffee. Not for the faint of heart in terms of the roast, but something that would definitely go down easily. Carbonation is light and nonintrusive, making this a quick quaffer. Beautiful."
"This beer pours nicely, and smells wonderful. The head is a bit disappointing, it starts strong, but dissipates quickly, leaving little lacing. Taste is chocolatey, coffee-like, with a nice creamy mouthfeel. This Porter is very smooth and drinkable, and is not at all bitter or heavy. It's like a cup of really really smooth cappucino. I really liked this beer."
"Poured from a 1pt 2.6oz bottle, this beer was a dark brown with ruby hues. Held to the light it was a glorious garnet liquid with a milk chocolate brown head. The retention was fair, although it left little lace on my pint glass. Its aroma was of chocolate and little else, but out was strong and inviting. The chocolate flavors were much more subdued than I had expected from the aroma. There is little hopping, but some burnt malts provide a balance to the sweetness. It's a decidedly British beer, light in the mouth and a little creamy. It would make a fine session brew."
"Ah, it's always a pleasure for me to do business with Fuller's. This London Porter pours out nearly black in hue, a deep mahogany when held up to the light. Creamy off-white head that soon fades to a thin mottled cap upon the ale. Earthy aroma at first, faint coffee and chocolate, and a dry woody smokiness. Earthy coffee flavour, tapering off to a smoky aftertaste, like pipe tobacco. Full but very dry mouthfeel, with a lingering roasted husk aftertaste. I'm not a smoker myself, but I could see this accompanying a pipe quite nicely, or any very smoked meat dishes. A very nice change from some of the very cloyingly sweet porters that I have sampled in the past. I must salute northyorksammy for enabling me to finally sample this after itching for it for so long."
" All in all, this is a really good porter and one of the originals that our pals in UK have drank for centuries. It's good enough to have as many as you can grab."
"The beer is a little light for a porter. It is a deep, transparent red, not black or brown. The nose is quite nice though. Big roasted, nutty goodness floating out of the glass. The flavor is nicely balanced between smooth, malty goodness and rough, roasted sharpness. Hops are detectable, but in balance. The finish is a little strange, quite dry. Mouthfeel is wanting, not as creamy as I'd like. Overall, a quite drinkable beer."
"A deep brown/mohagany pour with a nice tan head. Clear and very settled. The nose is nicely highlighted with soft chocolate and light roasted malt. The taste is nicely malty with dry, unsweetened chocolate notes and a mild coffee-ish flavour. Very nice staying power. The semi-bitter finish lingers nicely. A very smooth mouthfeel with a dry, coffee-bean-bitter finish. A great example of the style."
"Served from the bottle into a 20oz nonic pint glass. Pours with virtually no head. Smell is rich with hints of chocolate, coffee, and toffee. Taste is much of the same, with a smooth, not too sweet finish. Its not as heavy/filling as I expected. Quite a satisfying beer, and I usually do not even like Porters. What this one has going for it is the fact that it does not go overboard on the sweetness, instead keeping everything in balance. I do wish it had a bit more carbonation, however."
"Well crafted, and very fresh beer."
"The taste? Is this liquid toffee? Or beer? Or some chocolate concoction? I can't tell! All three of those fantastic flavors blend nicely together and lead into a light hoppy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is super thick, syrupy and and rich. Just delicious."
"Bottle - Poured a deep black brew with a nice head but lack some retention. Carbonation is average with a medium body (I was expecting a richer and ''fuller'' body). Aroma of chocolate is very subtle. Taste is a mix of roastiness, chocolate, and coffee with just enough bitterness at the end. Overall, this is a good beer but I still believe it might be a bit overrated."
"Over all a very good brew, must say that I am very impressed. Think that this is a brew that fantastic during the cooler and colder days of fall and winter. Seems to have the ability to warm ya right up. A brew that I will definitely have again, would like to try it on tap next!"
"Solid malt and coffee flavors with a roasted character. Powdery dry chocolate cocoa finish."
"Full feel, this is a drink all the time stranded on a desert island with one beer beer."
"I would expect something like this to be overwhelming: too sweet, too bitter, too thick. But this one strikes that perfect balance."
"Fairly lightweight porter, but an elegant, restrained beer. A great nightcap. I'll get some more of this stuff -- I'll even pay for it this time."
"This could well be my 2nd favorite non-robust porter after the Edmund Fitzgerald. A very rich and delicious porter, and absolutely one that I'd have again!"
"Very very drinkable. Goes down like liquid silk."
"This is just a bit thin and not warming enough for my tastes in porter. I like this for now but continue my search for a replacement for my Okocim Porter."
"I think I'm about done with Fuller's. This porter was fine. It just wan't special. The pour was a dark brown almost ruby with a good sized head and huge lacing all the way down the pint. It smelled mostly of roasted, smoky malt. It was okay but not very complex. The taste was the same, but I have had some porters that had a lot more complex smell and flavors. It does have a coffee-like taste that is nice. It was strong in the mouth, but one and done is the order of the day for this porter. I have to mention that in our area this retails for over $9.00. I can get a really good Heavyweight porter for a lot less than that. Brewpubs in the Philly area produce much better porters."
"Lighter bodied than expected with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel and minimal carbonation. Great drinkability."
"Fuller's London Porter is a solid English porter. Sure, it's much better than average, but it doesn't quite live up to the hype as far as I'm concerned. If you can manage it, get your hands on Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. Now *that* is an amazing brew."
"Taste had a mixture of dark chocolate & coffee beans with a minor fruit mash. Toffee finish."
"A nice and dark pour results in a light tan head of dense, tight bubbles with some variegation in the size. The head dies away with some spottiness, not really returning even with a swirl of the glass. The beer's color is dark, very dark brown; when held to light, fairly glows with a ruby-brown translucence. A lazy streamer glides upwards... Aroma is dusky and rich, deeply toffeeish. Toasting caramel sugars, brown sugar on white buttered toast (cinnamon might be stretching it a bit), enormous molasses; chocolate shavings and a nuttiness; and yet to all this sweetness there is a dryish ""snap," a ""pucker," if you will... and a plush, mallowy nosefeel. Quite nice. Flavor is wow big molasses with a gingery snap across the tongue. Chocolate brownies, liquid Oreo cookie sweetnesses in the forepalate resolve into coffee-with-sugar-and-cream bitterness at the back; the hops never outstanding but rounding this off well. Perhaps a bit of hazelnut syrup in that coffee? Mouthfeel is almost fluffy, not heavy in the least, and perfectly coating without being viscous; a softly dry finish. Mouthwatering. I cannot keep the glass away from my lips. Trying not to gush. Just. Great."
"From the wonderful Imperial Pint bottle. Pours a dark brown with red highlights. Lightly roasted espresson smell. Fantastic espresso flavors with a clean dry finish. Nothing heavy or cloying about this beer. Made to be drank for an evenings pleasure of socializing. Great stuff and a world classic."
"12 ounce bottle. Best before 22/NOV/04."
"From the classic ""1 pt. 2.6 fl. oz."" brown Fuller's bottle with the gold griffin on the label. Appears quite dark brown sitting on the tabel but shows substantial amber when held to the light. The head foamed up nicely and stuck around the edges in a fairly thick formation. Coffee, chocolate, and bits of fruit with a trace of hops make a delightfully complex smell. The taste is equally enjoyable, with everything melding together impecably. The mouthfeel is just slight thinner than some other favorite porters. Drinkability? I was amazed to look down and find the glass empty already. A classic for good reason."
"This is one BIG porter! Rich and full bodied! Seems to be lacking a bit of complexity up front on the palate but makes up for it on the mid-palate and the finish. Cocoa, chocolate, coffee, toffee and light fruits. This is really tasty!"
"All I could think the whole time while drinking it was, ""Wow, this is where Sierra Nevada's Stout inspiration came from!"" Some BA's noted that this beer would be a bit better with a higher ABV, but I love it just the way it is."
"I quickly picked this up at the LCBO, seeing the word ""porter"" and knowing it was a beer I've yet to have. Little did I know this quick snatch off a shelf was such a beautiful gemstone. Pours a light black colour. Yes, light black. It was a little transluscent. Not much change when held to the light. Just different shades of black. A big, beautiful 2 finger head that slowly dissipates with each sip. Ooooh, what a smell. Roasted malts, bread, sugar, burnt coffee, dark chocolate, blackberries, raisins are smelled. Great taste. Starts out sweet, with the malt kicking, leaves burnt and bitter, with the dark chocolate and slight hint of hops exiting the mouth. Something is out of place, however. Is that licorice, or another dark fruit? I couldn't place my tongue on it. Whatever it be, it's pleasant. A little odd, but pleasant. Silky, creamy, smoooth mouthfeel. It coats the throat in sinful pleasure. Drinkable? Damn straight. One could drink a dozen in a row and still enjoy the last as if it were the first. And with the low ABV, it doesn't surprise the weak when they try to stand. A terrific brew. I'm still excited I picked it up."
"Notes: Not a bad drink, but doesn't compare to the Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter."
"To me this beer defines the porter and all others should be compared to this beer. Absolutly perfect to style and my only improvement would be make it a bit more alcoholic."
"A fine offering"
"My score is based on the cask version in December 2007 which makes it an ideal cask, with just the required bitterness and stouty roast coffee. In bottle, Looks, smells and tastes like a chocolate liquor, a bit bitter, with some coffee and coffee roast. Rich and smooth in taste, aroma and colour. Drying finish. Had Feb 2005 again on tap and it just does it again.Fuller's and maybe all of the UK's best."
"Pours a very dark brown / near black with mahogany highlights. Tan head that shrunk to a thin brown ring. Aroma consists of coffee and chocolate, with a frosting-like sweetness to it. Nose turns a bit vinous as the porter warms. Medium-bodied mouthfeel. Initial flavor of roasted coffee and vanilla beans. Middle reveals a bittersweet chocolate flavor. Finish is somewhat vinous with a mild bitterness and ends slightly dry. Very nice."
"A satisfying brew."
"Drinkability: A great porter. Could use a bit more hop flavor, but overall, great. I could see myself drinking this one quite often."
"-Oelergud"
"Pours a very dark brown to black with reddish tones when held in the light. Capped by a thinnish light tan head consisting of many very small bubbles. Wonderfully complex aroma includes roasted coffee and chocolate scents. As expected from the aroma, coffee and chocolate flavors primarily dominate the taste. Smooth and medium to full bodied, I found this to be a highly drinkable beer. This is a very good beer in all respects and one which I will definitely have again."
"Exceptional black color with a long lasting, creamy head. Rich dark roasted malt aroma suggesting a full-bodied taste to follow. Roasted malt taste with hints of smoke. Flavors linger nicely into the aftertaste, which remains as a slight bitterness which is refreshing. Very smooth an ddrinkable. I put this one in my top tier of porters. Highly recommended."
"As I pour this beer fruit notes escape from the glass. As I stick my nose further in I get roasted notes of coffee and more of the fruitiness. A thick light brown head tops this fairly clear beer, which is dark brown in color with ruby notes as it is held up to the light. This beer has an incredible creamy mouthfeel to it. It is lightly sweet with a roast character in the finish. There is a very good balance between the roast character and the fruit notes. This is a wonderfully balanced beer, certainly one of the best Porters out there. The smooth creamy body of this beer is amazing."
"Probably not the best tasting of this beer that I've had, carbonation-wise, but still a wonderfully delicious and complex beer. This would pair nicely with raw oysters or as a base in meat stews."
"Bottle purchased at Huckleberry's in Spokane and poured at cellar temperature. Poured what looked to be jet black until held up to light, when it took on a rubyish hue. Big tan head that huung around for a bit. Stayed foamy on the surface throughout. The smell was an intoxicating mix of dark chocolate, roasted coffeeish malts, with just a hint of what smelled like berries of some sort. The taste, I'm happy to say, is just as it smelled. This one never even went into the fridge, and I'm glad, as the flavor was truly something to savor. The mouthfeel was downright creamy. Made me wonder what beer fudge might taste like. I had to grade down a little in drinkability, as repeated doses of this in one session would make the drinker incapable of self-propulsion. This is the first time I've seen this here, and definitely not the last time I buy it."
"ng"
"Appearance: Deep ruby brown almost purple when held up to light if not held to the light just appears deep prune, with a full bubbly highly carbonated tan head leaves lacing in thick chunks very nice. Aroma: Chocolate deep roasted layers of aromatic bliss this one has fruit thrown in ther some deep fig brandy like nuances very well done coffe esque roasts in the finish wow. Taste: Where do we start at the chocolate covered simmered fruit or the coffee tones great creaminess these guys are the orginators. Mouthfeel: Chewy crisp chocloate very rich robust sensation on the palate fuller bodied beer meant to be sipped on and enjoyed accordingly. Drinkability: Wow, simply easy effortless drinkability yet complex and soothing toward the beer lover's sould in me."
"almost black in color with a slight ruby hue at the bottom of the glass and an excellent tannish head with small bubbles. roasty, coffee, creamy (flaked barley?) aroma. very smooth and balanced flavors, slight roasty hoppy aftertaste. excellent creamy mouthfeel, I love this beer - very drinkable."
"Tastes nutty with bitter chocolate undertones. Roasted malt falvors as well. Bitter finish. Smooth and tasty. Medium bodied beer but rich tasting and complex. Very, very good porter."
"Notes: A truly stellar brew; brilliant flavor profile for 5.4% ABV."
"A nice creamy mouthfeel. It is oh so smooth. The charcoal leaves a bite on the palate and then the butter sweeps it away. Excellent. What a great mouthfeel this porter has."
"Man, this is a great beer! I'm really coming around to enjoying porters and stouts and IMO this is a clear leader in the porter style. Fullers has been brewing since 1845, according to the bottle, and they've certainly hit the bullseye with this beer."
"This beer pours a dark brown to even black in dark light out of an 18.6oz bottle. It has a small tan head. The smell is very chocolaty and very strong with roasted malts. The taste is of roasted malts with a touch of chocolate and coffee. It has a very smooth feeling while still a little watery. It is bitter and has some earth tones. While this is not my favorite style of beer I would still have to say for its style it is a good beer and worth the time invested in it."
"The freshness date on this bottle was 2/3/2003 so it was 7 months past it's prime. I don't know if this had any adverse effects upon it because even at 7 months past, it's quite good. I would really like to have this fresh sometime, but in Oklahoma that'll probably be fairly difficult, and at 9 bucks a 6 pack, it won't be something I'll buy a lot of, but all in all, very tasty."
" the taste is both smooth and slick, both sweet and bitter, with faint alcohol overtone. quite complex really. absolutely drinkable..i could have a few and smile the whole time. another quality brew from Fuller's."
"Highly Recommended."
"Pours a deep brown with some nice ruby highlights a lighter head that leaves some nice lacing,aroma is sweet and roasted with some light cofee aromas lingering.Nice and complex beer somewhat sweet with nice earthy tones, a rich marshmellow-like finish.A nice rich and sustaining porter very well made for sure."
"Ruby-brown with a thin tan head. Decent retention with some lace remaining on the glass. Smell is an inviting combination of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and caramel. Taste is essentially more of the same with a minor Goldings hop bite on the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, but a touch watery and thin. Easily drinkable, just not as full and palate-coating as I prefer in this style. Nonetheless, a very good English porter from a world-class brewery."
"A great example of a true enlgish porter. It's not a stout and it's not an ale. It meets somewhere in the middle in perfect harmony."
"Pours to a low thin head that form a ring around the glass. Color is light ruby and crystal clear. aroma is roasted malt--very low-key and not loud at all. Flavor is roasted grains with sweet maltiness balanced by just the right amount of hops. Finishes with a lingering roastiness that is pleasing. Must have on tap next time if available!"
"Overall Impression: One of the more enjoyable porters I’ve found. A well made beer with great drinkability. If you’ve had to move a lot of heavy things today, and need to reward your efforts, this is a good choice."
"Dang... what a perfect porter (sorry Bert Grants). Whether just having one or as a session beer this beer is perfect. Everything is just right with this beer. It's a wonderful balance of malty and hoppy and chocolatey. I have a new beer to put on my list of favorites."
"Dark black color, medium head. Nice chocolate and coffee aroma. Full bodied porter. Deep roasted malt flavor. Rich complex flavors; cocoa, chocolate, and coffee. Smooth taste. Slightly sweet. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and round. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. Very Nice beer."
"Rounding out a Fuller's tripel play this evening, I dig into a London Porter. This beer appears to be very dark and almost black, but reveals itself to be the deepest crimson when held up to a light. The head is tan and fluffy and the lacing is consistently present all the way down the glass. Aromas are of roasted malts and some light smokiness. Taste a sweet creamy milk chocolate with a slight burnt bitterness at the end. There is a light smokey feel to the taste as well. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but still refreshing as a porter should be. Overall this is a very unique porter and I really enjoyed the light smokey feel of it."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a creamy light tan head. The aroma is great. The scent of roasted barley, black patent, and crystal malts comes across well, but not too bold. The taste is sweet and rich; dark malts all the way. There is a strong taste of chocolate malt surrounded by the before mentioned patent, crystal, and roasted malts. The mouthfeel is fine. This is a heavy bodied ale that isn't a gusler, but is certainly one to enjoy."
"For a porter, this is definitely an assertive example, especially with hops that surprised me with their strong presence in the flavor profile. The hops start out bitter in the front and built during the middle only to fade into the finish and linger for a bit afterwards. A bit of burned bread is dominate in the middle of the flavor and while I'd be surprised if smoked malt is part of the mash, something's making me think of a campfire. A surprisingly good example of what a porter can be. Warm and toasty, but not as big and chunky as their huskier brothers, the stouts."
"Fuller's had a very nutty flavor and goes down sweet. It finishes with a little hoppiness that balances out the initial intense malt flavors. Kind of a lighter but the taste makes up for that and then some! My favorite london style porter as of yet."
"Deep mahogany brown, thin tannish head that evaporated far to fast but leaves impressive sticky, spotty ink-blot lacing. Smell is deeply roasty/toasty malts with a slight burntness with notes of hazelnut, dark toffee, and coffee. Taste is a fair amount of roasted malts, burnt-like toast and coffee, a bit acidy in the middle into the end where a tiny little fruityness slips in, finishing with a hoppy mellow dryness that balances well. Feel is medium to thin in abundance, no real richness or heftyness to be found for my idea of a robust porter. Its a solid porter by many means and quite a good drinker, I was hoping for more though."
"Had the thin body of a traditional porter; its appropriate mouthfeel was a little more than watery but not coating. I'd call this more of a session version of the beer, subtle and carefully done. Not made heavy to be something it is not (i.e. a stout), and like all Fullers beers it is solid."
"ive overlooked this for far too long and it was time to try it. poured almost black, a deep brown with a small offwhite head. smells of coffee and roasted malt. the taste is near perfect, smokey roasted malts, coffee and cocoa. good balance of everything. the mouth feel is lighter than i expected, slightly creamy but not heavy at all. the drinkability is extremely high as this does not weigh you down or hit you like a brick with a high abv. this is going to become a common member of my fridge."
"Tasted of roasted malt, smoke, and mild grease. Great mouthfeel, clean, smooth, and creamy. Wonderful. I can't believe how good this was. I thought it would be just an average mass produced porter. I was wrong."
"Pours out a deep brown, almost black, with a nice tan head. The smell is enticing, but not overpowering, with a smoky hint of coffee and chocolate malt. Taste is superb, creamy hints with the malt and chocolate hint coming through nicely. Mouthfeel is on the velvety side, though not as smooth as it could be. Overall a fantastic brew that's in my top 20 easily.."
"My first ""5" and im happy I eventually gave it out : )"
"I had this beer in a 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a thick deep reddish black with only one half a finger of light tan head, which dies down right after poured. There is almost no lacing left on the glass. The smell is fabulously strong with coffee and caramel notes. The taste is very smooth for a porter. Bits of coffee, caramel, and a hint of chocolate with a snap of hops at the finish. The mouthfeel is nice and strong. At 5.4%, this is a very drinkable porter as well."
"I am a big fan of Porters to begin with and for me, Fuller's London defines the style. It epitomizes robust. Poured a deep black with a cafe au lait head that was not too think but very creamy, especially for a bottle. The smell was deep, damp and earthy with aromas of sweet chocolate and toffee. The taste was rich and dark with serious notes of coffee dominating the taste and a well placed bitter hop finish hidden deep within rolling waves of toasted malts. The mouthfeel was exceptionally creamy and thick for a porter, but it was not at all obtrusive. If you are attempting to introduce a friend to Porters use this as an archetype."
"Porter-brown with a light tan head. Aroma is roasted malt and chocolate with an alcohol presence. Very smooth and creamy. One of the creamiest porters I've had recently. Crisp and only slightly bitter. This is one of the finest Porters I've had the pleasure of knowing. I'm not real high on English bottles but this is an outstanding example. Flavor is rich and nearly perfect for it's style. Chocolate stands out with hops complimenting roasted malt. Thanks for the recommendation John!"
"Originally sampled from bottle on 22 June 2002. dark brown w/ the aroma & flavor of coffee & chocolate. It finishes very smoothly. This beer is nicely balanced between roasty and malty. This is a world class beer that is readily available in a lot of areas. Enjoy it!"
"This is a very nice porter; very enjoyable. Pours a deep mahogany color topped off but a thick, creamy tan head that retained itself quite nicely. There is a punch of dark chocolate and roasted malts noted upon initial smell, followed by mild aromas of coffee and butterscotch. The taste has just as many different aspects as the aroma. Coffee and roasted cocoa are definitely the dominating flavors here, finished off with a slight bitterness of hops. This is a very well balanced, full-bodied beer. Its a little heavier than most porters that Ive had, but it was very enjoyable."
"I had four great beers tonight, but I decided on this for my 100th review. Fuller's is my favorite porter, and no beer in the world tastes any better (IMO). Not overly impressive in appearance, but this beer is perfectly balanced. Wonderful chocolate notes, smooth (but with enough bitterness to balance it just right). I really can't find any fault in this beer (and it's outdated - 8/02!). Can't imagine how good a fresh one would taste! (I did end up finding a new 6, and it was even better. Great beer!)."
"Dark mahogany liquid pours witha creamy tan head. Very good staying power creates an attractive lacing. The aroma is coffee, raisin, chocolate and roasted malts with a hint of spice. The taste is huge on coffee, with some bitter cocoa and a touch of fruity sweetness in the middle. Very nice bittering on the finish gives way to a long, roasted coffee aftertaste that is sprinkled with cocoa. Mouthfeel is good, with a lighter body and perfect carbonation. Drinkability is also good, but the powerful flavors keep you from pounding this one. It is one to be savored and enjoyed, not guzzled. A very good beer."
"Pours a bubbly dark brown with a very thick head, evaporating rather quickly, but some fine lacing throughout. Aroma is of roasted malts, chocolate and coffee beans, enough complexity to keep sniffing! Very smooth and crisp, a wonderful blend of roasted malt, chocolate, and dark roasted coffee mixed well. A creamy body, yet stays smooth throughout, a smokey and coffee beans feel left on the palate, leaves you yearning for more. Should be enjoyed by most, try one ASAP."
"Well, well, well. What do we have here. A damn fine drink i do believe. A nice light brown head that sticks all over the place, floating atop a nice almost-black body. Smells delicious. Yep, the taste confirms that. We got some fine mixing of chocolate, coffee and probably some caramel. Probably be better in the winter, but im trying to say this shit is good."
"If you're looking for a good example of a Robust Porter, this is the one you should try. It embodies the style perfectly. Many others I have tried are too close to the line between porters and stouts. This one is perfect."
"A darn good porter."
"This beer taste's hearty, bread in a bottle. I think i like it."
"Bottom Line: The perfect porter for quaffing."
"Creamy, espresso-brown head that stays a while. Pours dark reddish/brown with lots of small carbonation bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. Earthy smell with strong coffee notes and a kind of sour malt. The scent is not too strong, but pleasant. Big creamy beer that tastes like coffee with slight hoppy overtones. Finishes with more coffee bitterness and then slightly sweet malt. Well-balanced and smooth. This is a filling porter."
"A hallmark of porters. Smooth, with trace carbonation. As downable as any."
"Poured a beautiful black with that oh so beautiful nitro head. Smell was rather subdued. Overall I found the beer pretty bland. Their was a rather odd, ""fruity but not in a good way"" taste that I couldn't quite pin. Will have to try this one at another bar and see if it is any better. General overall impressions was not positive."
"In Heaven there is no beer that is why we drink it here!"
"Pours almost black, with ruby highlights. Has a thin, and quickly fading tan head. Aroma is malty, with notes of coffee, chocolate and smoke. Flavor is a combination of chocolate, bitter coffee, some grassy notes, and a bit of caramel. As the beer sits for a while, the alcohol becomes a bit more pronounced. Medium to full bodied, and very smooth., this is a very drinkable porter that really hits the spot!"
"Aromas of sweet malt,chocolate and a hint of roast coffee way in the back. It starts malty sweet, caramel? with a long finish that is roaty-toasty as it warms. It has a medium body that asks for more drinking, the texture is creamy and chewy.It's a beer that goes well with comfort food.I really liked this one- very easy to want a few pints in a sitting."
"A really drinkable beer - great for cold evenings."
"This is cast and mold for a traditional style porter. It pours dark, rich brown with ruby highlights showing up around the edges. The head is a dense light beige, yet disappears quickly. Malt, caramel, chocolate, and coffee dominate the aroma. The taste is again, very malty; rich chocolate, coffee, and a bit of treacle come through. Unlike a lot of American interpretations, there is a definite absence of roasted barley and a decision, instead, to focus on the black, chocolate and crystal malts. A lot of domestic porters have a stout-like taste profile due to the use of roasted barley (though usually in smaller quantities than in stouts). Very good, indeed. Taste this alongside Anchor Porter (also an outstanding porter, imho) and you'll see what I mean about the roasted barley."
"This brew poured a black color but there was a very deep ruby hue towards the bottom of the glass. Their was a creamy tan head cresting at three fingers and eventually settling down to about a quarter of an inch, with good lacing. The aroma was of dark chocolate, carmel, and roasted malts. The taste was similiar to the nose. It started off with the dark chocolate and malts and finished with a creamy buttery taste. There was a strong coffee aftertaste and the mouthfeel was very smooth. This is the kind of brew I could drink all night, so delicious. This is definitely one of the best porters I've had so far."
"The aroma is roasted and nutty, with some chocolate. Toffee appears as it warms. The front is roasted grains and toffee, but not a cloying sweet toffee. Bitterness in the middle. The finish is dry. Mouthfeel is velvet. This is an excellent, dry porter that hits the spot perfectly when I'm not in the mood for the sweeter blacks."
"This is a very nice porter, quite expensive though but it really deserves it's position up top. :)"
"Overall, this was a very delicious beer. It has a different flavor profile than most porters that I have had. Not a beer to pound all night long, but a beer to be cherished on certain occasions."
"This is a great porter that I will drink again and use to judge others by."
"went down smooth with a filling feeling...this is going to the top of my beer purchase rotation"
"482"
"This is a nicely balanced version of the English porter, and is certainly very drinkable, but I wish it had a smoother mouthfeel and a touch more body and malt sweetness. Some maltodextrin and lactose would really make this an amazing beer. As it stands, this is very good."
"Very dark ruby pour, medium tan, creamy head, slowly diminishing to leave good lacing. Aroma is strong, with dark choocolate, roasted cofee, and caramel taking the lead. Flavor follows, with the coffee taking the initial lead, followed by hints of caramel, and finishing with a long lasting dark chocolate taste. Very solid mouthfeel, light carbonation on the tongue, and that long lasting flavor keeps you remembering what you just drank for a while afterwards."
"Pours a very dark, almost black color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that dissipates into a heavy and sticky lace. Nose is smoky charcoal, sweet roasted malts and bitter coffee. The smoky charcoal also comes through in the taste along with some bitter dark chocolate and a touch of buttery dark toffee. As it warms, some notes of dark fruits and raisins start to express themselves. A very nice porter and a treat during the rare bitter-cold Texas days."
"This was well worth $9 for a six-pack of 12 ounce bottles, definitely my favorite porter so far."
"Brown with ruby highlights body. Foamy beige head. Nice lacing. Incredible chocolate aroma. I've died and went to Hershey's. Roasted malts, coffee, chocolate roll across the tongue. Hint of hops in aftertaste. Mouthfeel could be just a little less fizzy and a little fuller (no pun intended), but neither condition is a deal breaker. This porter is in for the long haul."
"pours out a very dark but clear brownish colour, transluscent ruby and garnet around the edges. thin but tight head settles down and gives way to a bit of fine lace. a decadent aroma of slightly burnt sugar, candied fruit, big whiffs of semi sweet chocolate, and discernible dark roasted malts. ever so slight floral hops peek out too. full bodied and unbelievably smooth in the mouthfeel. big malty flavors of layered chocolate cake, and hints of bitter espresso and other subtle coffee flavors. any malt bitterness is quickly countered by the superb balancing sweetness of residual sugars. finishes smooth, with a slight bite of hop crispness that just completes the beer beautifully. i could drink this porter everyday. the perfect brew for a cold winter's night! outstanding!"
"When poured, it was so dark brown that it could pass for black and the foam being brown with a beautiful lace all the way down the glass until the last drop. The smell and taste was of coffee, chocolate and to me just a slight hint of a smoke. The sweetness and bitterness was well balanced and very pleasant on the palate. This has to be one of the better Porter's I've tasted so far! It will be worth purchasing this porter again!"
"Very dark brown in color with a thin head. Aroma is a nice roasted maltiness which mellows into a caramely sweetness as the beer warms. Taste starts off sharply with some hop flavor and coffee-like malt. The malt becomes more caramely mid-palate, and ends with a roasty, bitter, dry finish. Medium-full body. Quite a nice porter."
"Drinkability: Damn high! This is one kick-a*s porter! Like their ESB, I could drink this all night. I'm going to have to get another pint of this from the handpump, like I had two months ago. Amazing stuff!"
"full flavored with enough complexity to keep me interested, this is just a winner. this is a balls out top notch porter. it is in your face with great flavor all the way through. looks like i will be making another 2 hour plus road trip to get more if i can't find it locally."
"Deep, dark brown in color, with a tan head that has fair retention. Leaves a bit of lace-work down the glass. There is a good level of deep roasted malt aroma, with a bit of hop aroma in the back. The roasted malt is in the forefront on this one, but there is hints of coffee and chocolate as well. The roastness is so much forefront that there is a bit of a ""bite"" from the roasted malt. The hop bitterness is at a good level, but kept in check by the roast malt flavors. It is medium-bodied, lightly carbonated, and overall a tasty Robust Porter. I am a big fan of Porters, and this one is no exception."
"Deep ruby-black color, nice thick head that clings to my glass. Fresh roasted aroma, chocolate-caremel and roasty coffee flavors. Medium body, nice soft creamy mouthfeel, one of the best porters around."
"What a beautiful site sitting in my glass this very deep garnet colored beer with a masterful head, the texture creamy with oodles of fine clinging lace to smother the glass. Impressive toasted grains dominate the nose, caramel, light earthy sweetness that I find quite appealing. Chocolate sweet start, the top middling, the finish has delectable hop spiciness, delightfully carbonated, droughty malt aftertaste that lingers lovingly on your satisfied palate. As you can see I think a lot of Fullers beers, and with Samuel Smith, make up my top two English Breweries. Personally quite a treat for us ""Dark Lovers", when the ""World"" is turning to the ""Light", I steadfastly clutch the Darkness."
"Why endeavor such perfection?"
""
"This was my first Porter to try. Poured a beautiful dark brown with a small head that disipated quickly. Taste was of roasted malt, also a tiny hint of spice. Went down smooth. It was so good I think I drank it too fast. Definitely one of my new favorite full-bodied beers."
"One word:  Delicious."
"[edited 4/18/05 to reflect fact that this is not cask-conditioned, but keg served through handpump]"
"This is a beer with beef and just like their site points out - a deep, dark, coffee-colored ale.  Good head and carbonation.  Some roasty maltiness and slightly hoppy finish.  The ABV is 5.2%."
"Every bit as good as I hoped it would be. I hit the jackpot when Andy's North Campus here in Columbus sent an e-mail that they had cases of this for $11.99. Excellent roasted aroma with hints of chocolate. Rich, dark color with a thin head. Hearty coffee/chocolate flavor that neither dissipated nor overpowered. One of the best beers I have tried."
"Dark brown with a garnet hue; clingy tan head. Toffee, caramel and coffee in the nose--supremely inviting.  Low carbonation and an extra-creamy mouthfeel. Sweet flavors of chocolate, coffee and caramel are dominant. Tops on my list of porters--a must-have, particularly on draft."
"From the toffee-like aroma to the charcoal finish. Fat, sticky head that tops a walnut edged pitch liquid wonderment. Roast and toast and hop and malt and balance, balance, balance. A superb Porter that compels you to drink it down. Simple and elegant."
"This has to be one of the best Porters on Earth. so damn tasty! Jump on the bandwagon if you havent already!"
"Mmmm, I love a good porter and this is one of them. Smooth is the word - malt, coffee and chocolate to die for. Yet there was my favorite taste in there to - some hops to keep me happy. Another brew that kept giving different flavor bursts from start to finish."
"I have been drinking alot of porters lately and this one is not too bad.  It is a deep amber color with moderate white head.  It had a malty aroma.  It was less roasty, but more chocolate than the Sam Smith Taddy Porter.  I liked it a little better than the Sam Smith too, not quite as stout."
"This is a great porter!  The head is dark in color which gives you the idea that it is an oatmeal stout, but upon tasting it, you realize you have stepped into a realm that is not matched.  The chocolate flavor is great but at times a little overwhelming.  The malt is very present towards the middle and can be complemented with a nice shot of irish whiskey.  It finishes very smooth and definitely makes you want to come back for more.  Definitely my favorite foreign Porter."
"I have to say that this is one of the best beers I have ever had.  Because it was hand-pumped, I know this review is slightly inflated; but I don't care.  Tremendous beer, beautiful dark color with tan head- you could see the richness ebbing from the top.  Carmel sweetness, but a rich, dark chocolate flavor, with some bitterness pulls you in and never lets you out.  So fresh, nothing to distract from the taste. Creamy, but not in a nitro way- just and abundace of flavor.  Wonderful."
"Pours a nice dark brown with a reddish tint. Nice sticky tan headholds pretty well. On the nose there are aromas of caramel and malt and touch of toffee and coffeesame on the palate caramel, chocolate notes, and toffee all becomes more flavorful as it warms a bit. At first it tastes lighter then Id like, but by finish time, a nice sweetness pulls through. Very enjoyable brew!"
"Okay, this is my first try at Fuller's attempt at a porter, having already sampled their 1845 and ESB.  It had a wonderful very dark ruby red color.  It created a wonderful dark tan head, but it failed to hold, but that may have been due to the temperature I had it chilled at.  The taste is good, with elements of chocolate, coffee and perhaps toffee.  The finish is good, it a little lighter than I like for this style.  Also applys to the body of it, while good, really not as heavy as I like porters to be."
"Pours dark ruby with a nice thin beige head that retains nicely.  One of the best smelling porters I've come across.  Nutty, roasty and chocolatey.  Very, very nice.  Wow.  What a creamy mouthfeel.  This is really an outstanding porter.  I've had this before but never had this type of experience.  (They were probably old beers in past.)    Great coffee taste and roasted tones.  Vanilla bean and bittersweet chocolate make their presence known.  Full body.  What a treat.  Great way to cap the night."
"Almost black in color with tannish colored lace. Great taste and full bodied. Another great brew from a great brewery."
"Dark ruby brown, almost opaque...nice pillowy head, absorbs drips like a sponge. Pronounced sweet mocha smell, one of the nicest smelling brews I've ever had. Deep, deep roasted to burnt chocolate flavors right off the bat, with a very smooth and consistent fade. Some sense of anise complexity as well. Satisfying richness in the back of the throat. Minimal hops, but they do add in concert with the coffee flavors in mid mouth. Medium body combines with lack of over-carbonation to give a nice mouthfeel without an overbearing impact. Nice Porter to be sure..."
"WHEW!  If I'm ever gonna be slapped in the face by anything other than a female, this is the one.  It's a slap you can smile about.  Roasted coffee with a taste that lingers.  Maybe a bit of chocolate tasted after your first breath. Only my second Porter to try...very different than my first, but I like it.  Small head that leaves a lace all the way to the bottom of the glass.  Thumbs up!"
"Medium to full bodied with a wonderful balance all around.  This porter is among the very best as far as I'm concerned-- perfect carbonation, chocolate malt flavor, black patent bitterness and exactly the right amount of bittering and flavoring hops.  Just great stuff."
"Good, but perhaps a bit too thick, not really elegant, but a good porter, very complex, and bitter, goodstuff."
"Notes: A more than decent porter ... a great brew during the wet raw days of late fall / early winter. Goes great with imported chocolates also."
"very dark and full bodied, a stronger taste of licorice? and coffee tones than other Porters. My porter of choice, and as in most English brews very smooth. Best in winter. I'm having second thoughts on this being my Porter of choice. The last two times I had this I wasn't sure I liked the very strong finishing taste. I think I might prefer the more mellow tones of the Anchor and Anderson Valley porters.  Still this is a great beer!"
"An exceptional, classic London porter. With it's simple complexity you know exactly what you're getting and won't be dissappointed. A treat on tap."
"Fuller's London Porter in the bottle.  Ruby black in color. Sweet malty aroma with a lot of dark roasted coffee and dark chocolate.  Strong hops with dark roast coffee and dark chocolate taste.  A very good bitter mocha aftertaste.  This is my first porter and in my opinion it is an excellent beer.  I hope to find this one on tap one day."
"A typically fine product from Fullers.  Pours with a big tan head that leaves a nice lace on the side of the glass as you drink.   Very smooth, with hints of coffee and chocolate.  A creamy, almost buttery mouthfeel that leads to a fairly dry finish."
"The first time i had this was with a slice of birthday cake and they actually went great together. I woudlnt say this is my favourite porter but it's close."
"A great porter.  Lots of depth of flavor, with dark coffee and a hint of dark chocolate.  If it were any more substantial, it would be a stout."
