"Dark brown with some ruby on the bottom, little lacing.  Smells of chocolate, toffee and faint coffee.  Taste is initially herbal bitterness upfront then followed by dark malt, some chocolate and slight coffee notes. More carbonation than expected for a porter.  Overall bottle description accurate but more bitterness than other english style porters that I had."
"Dark almost black but ruby highlights at the bottom.. Tan head with spotty lace.. A/T typical porter.. Dark roasted malt, slight chocolate, bitter roast, kinda watery with a metallic veggie finish.. Will finish the six pack with no problem but problay won't get it again."
"This is a quality beer and the description is just about 100% accurate. Carbonation seems a little high, head fades but comes back quickly with a little swirl. I would like to give this beer a chance to get to room temperature next time, I think the flavors would mellow together. Sweetness is different, English style toffee. Well worth a try or a 6 pack."
"Excellent full bodied and flavored porter."
"not my style of a porter"

"Dark brown pour with nearly no head. Smells of chocolate and toffee. Tastes of initial hop bitters followed by malt and coffee notes - all per the rather accurate commercial description!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Color perfect, four fingers of head, grains were right on. A good beer, but could have been better with a better hop balance."
""
"Smells roasty with hints of coffee and chocolate. Tastes great. Tastes like it smells, with mostly roasted malt up front and hints of coffee, chocolate and toffee to finish. The mouthfeel is a little lighter than I would like but it's not bad. Good amount of carbonation. Overall pretty good beer."

"O - a nicely done old world porter with heavy chocolate backbone. Cheers!"
""
"great porter.  dark, no overbearing coffeeness.  inexpensive."
""
"A very good beer. Big giant tall never ending chocolate colored head, very dark beer. Chocolate smell and taste oozes from this beer. It has a bit of a bitter finish but not too bad. It is a great product and I will buy this again."

"Great beer.  A little light on the mouth feel. Well worth it when you want a good porter!  Foothills has yet to give me a bad beer!"

"Poured an almost black body with small head and minor lace. Aroma is mostly a roasted, grainy malt aroma with hints of coffee and chocolate. Medium-bodied beer that has a roasted malt profile as dominant flavor, there are some coffee and chocolate notes but they are overpowered and don't offer much taste or balance. The finish is dry and grainy and I get a little of heated booziness at one point during the finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a black color. 3/4 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of liquor, alcohol, sweet malt, roasted malt, hint of yeast, and slight hops. Fits the style of an English Brown Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of strong alcohol, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, slight hop, hint of yeast, slight liquor, and a hint of dry hops. Overall, decent appearance, good aroma, body, and complexity."

"The People's Porter, a beer for the people. This beer is exactly what its name implies, a nice, solid, hard working beer. It tastes of the black morning coffee of a salaryman, the bread of a factory worker's lunch, and even a few notes of a caramel or vanilla like the manager might sneak at the end of the day. All in all the proletariat (as well as Foothills) should be proud to call this their beer. It's one of the more drinkable porters I have found due to its pleasant balance of flavors and (relatively speaking for a porter) low gravity. It is especially good for finishing off a six pack by yourself while watching football, avoiding your extended family, and waiting for day-before-Thanksgiving dinner to be made."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This bottle has been in my cellar for a while so the hops have faded but that is just fine with me as I find Foothills dark beers tend to be a bit hoppy for my palate; I like the way this has aged just fine"
""
""
"T: Lots of roasted malt with some day old coffee and some citrusy hops trying to pull through the malt. Finish gives a touch of toffee, hop resin and some charred espresso. Seems like the flavors start to fall apart a bit as it warms, but this is a pretty solid porter. Glad I got to try this."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A straightforward porter that doesn't really stand out among others but is solid enough. I guess that's why it's the ""People's"" porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep ruby-tinted brown with a pillowy tan head. The head has incredible retention and leaves substantial lacing. The aroma is a malt-lovers dream with big roasted notes of coffee and hints of chocolate. The aroma is similar but includes some mild earthy hops on the finish. The beer feels a little light on the palate, but not so much that I would call it ""watery"". A great big flavor English Porter."
"O - A decent porter. If it tasted like it smelled, it wouold be top notch. Still pretty good and very drinkable."
""
""
""
"O: I really enjoyed this beer! It didn't blow my mind in any way, but a well done porter."

"Poured on-tap and served in a shaker pint, the beer is a dark chestnut-black coloring with a foamy, light, low profile, tan head. Nose of coffee, cream, and chocolate. Smells great. Subtle aromas, but very inviting. Flavors are more chocolate forward, bitter and roasted, with some cream highlights. The body is smooth and slightly dry. The aftertaste is cream and coffee, almost mocha. Slick, slightly dry finish, with a subtle bitter linger. Very drinkable. Good brew."
""
""
""
"O: Its not bad, but its not great either. There are better dark beer options for this price range."
""
""
"A fluffy caramel head rests on top of an onix-colored body. I spilled a little onto my hands, and they now smell like Mexican hot chocolate. Cinnamon, chocolate malts, maple syrup, and a touch of coffee liquor are all present in the nose. The full taste is packed with bitter chocolate and coffee with a touch of vanilla and anise seed. Lacings grace the side of the glass like spider webs. I will grant that this is a solid porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A decent - if not amazing - robust porter, the hops here work better than some others in the style. Still, I wish some more of the malt character came through."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall the nose hints at real solid greatness but doesn't deliver the sensations on the palate at all that the bouquet hints at. Some faint tin and sourness also takes it down a notch in enjoyment. It's ok, but I have had a lot better porters than this."

"Appears opaque dark brown, capped with a cratered tan head that thins after a couple minutes. Smells more of fruity esters than expected, then the usual bittersweet chocolate and coffee aromas come through, almost alternating. Dark roasted coffee and dry cocoa dominate the flavor, leaving the mouth a bit chalky. Finishes plenty bitter. Medium body and carb where it should be. It's drinkable, but don't hurt yourself seeking this out."

"FEEL: Medium to full bodied, smooth and very tasty. Notes of espresso coffee linger on the palate."

"Cheers!"
"O - Another great beer from foothills. Not something I would buy all the time but definitely something I would buy again."

"O - A good generic porter, aroma is spot on but taste and mouthfeel leave a lot to be desired."

"O- A very solid porter. Straight forward and an easy drinker."

"This is worth a taste, but it's really not exceptional. Supposedly it's an English Porter, but I think Foothills added dirt instead of rocks (I'm sure that comment will make sense to at least one person). This may or may not pair with a piece of poontang pie."
""
""
""
"Good for porter. Smells a bit weak, but the taste and overall drinkability make it worth seeking out again. Solid all around."
""
""
""
""

"D: This was a solid porter with a basic but very enjoyable scent and taste. The body was fitting for the style, and the finish was pretty smooth, so it was easy to drink. Solid brew."

"For a porter, and especially considering the appearance, it's a little thin. It's more something underlying, as it begins with a firm heft, but something falls off as it goes. It has a crispness that isn't too much and is smooth enough to satisfy if only it didn't have that thinness in the body."
""
"The beer pours a nice dark brown to light black with a soft tan head of tiny, soft bubbles. The head leaves a lacing of slippery spittle droplets on the sides of the glass. The body is indecipherable in its darkness but shows some light molasses-like colors on its edges that seem clean of particles. On the nose, the beer smells of light, roasted coffee with a kiss of mocha and dark chocolate. Milk chocolate also briefly touches the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes of bitter roast with a kiss of hops. Sweetness is also prevalent from the malts, though subdued, and more chocolaty than sugary. In flavor, the beer begins as warm roasted chocolate which blossoms into roasted coffee, moving from light roast to dark roast and filling the mouth with a nice, bitter roasted flavor with slight hints of raisins and dark fruit in among the roast. The finish carries a slight flavor of ice and metal, oddly enough, with a dying bitter roasted coffee flavor that hints at chocolate and some slight earthiness that balances out the flavor. The aftertaste is of lingering bitter roasted coffee and char. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body, and perhaps even lighter, though the beer does carry a little heaviness in the swallow. Carbonation is soft and almost fluffy on the mouth, and the mouth is left roasted dry. Overall, this is a pretty classic American porter. There is nothing fancy about it, but it’s tasty. It has its chocolate, it has its bitters, and it has its roasted coffee flavors. A nice porter for when you want something simple."
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and caramel aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and metallic flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a solid cocoa and roasty presence."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- A decent porter overall. It had a good level of roasted chocolate and dark malt flavors with a nice bitter bite at the end. Not bad."
"Dark chestnut brown pour with a solid cap of beige head that sank to a thick ringlet and laced the glass nicely. Aroma of roasty dark malts, light hints of toffee and herbal hops; pretty thin. The taste was similar, dark malts, roasty, notes of coffee and cocoa, burnt caramel, nutshells, light herbal hops with a metallic twinge in the finish. Mouthfeel was pretty thin, body light-medium, bordering on medium, carbonation was moderate. Meh."

"O: Not smooth porter having just a slightly bitter edge with good roast. Roast and hops bitterness dominate while being enjoyable."
""
""
""
"O- easy drinking and well balanced, great value for the price"
""
""
""
""
""
"Very dark, with a long lasting head. Nothing descriptive in the aroma. Flavor and mouthfeel are good...I love porters and stouts, but this is coming across a bit bitter for me...not sure why. Perhaps it is because I just finished a Birdsong Lazy Bird Brown Ale which I loved. Anyway, this is drinkable but not memorable."

"Overall (4.0): This is a very solid porter, and I bet it’d be pretty gnarly on nitro. Smooth enough without losing any of its roast or bitterness, and maintaining a dry finish with levity, this is a really easy to drink porter, for those who enjoy the style. For those who aren’t into dark beers, this may not be a good intro, but for those who are, this is definitely a tasty, accessible, and very affordable option."
""
""
"O: Good flavor but heavy on the roast and low on complexity"

"I like this beer, but it is not great. It is a regular in my rotation due to it's availabity in my area. It is an easy drinking porter with decent taste, only the mouthfeel is a little watery and it has a slight burnt aftertaste. It gets better as it warms up. Still it a decent attempt at an english style porter."
"O: This is a very drinkable and enjoyable Porter. If it was a little heavier, it could be considered a stout. I'll gladly drink it anytime."
""
""
""
""
"I love this beer. Chocolate malts present as its poured into a tumbler, very good head and lacing. Aftertaste is very nice, chocolate malts finish. Abv is low enough to have a few and still be on point. Most porters are too light for my tastes, but this porter has a pretty full body."
""
""
""
""
"Color is dark and almost completely black. Taste is thick but not overly thick just right really for the style. The smell is toffee, some dried fruit, coffee, but not much and cocoa. That is what I find to be the strongest element of this one it is a well balanced porter with a lot of chocolate notes to it. It is sweet but once again not cloying in my opinion. Overall this is one of the better porters I have ever had and I do enjoy this style a great deal."
""
"The beer's overall enjoyment is high, but falls inconsistent first in its recipe formulation that over extends its flirtation with stout, and then leaves the mouthfeel thin to boot. Happy as I would be to drink the beer again, I would be careful not to group the beer with the likes of Sexual Chocolate or Hoppyyum IPA."

"Stronger scents and less watery in the finish and this could be a great one."

"One of my favorite go-to local beers in the winter. Rich malts with strong coffee and chocolate tones. Nice mellow bitterness. Full body that clings to the roof of your mouth. Dark brown with a tan head good legs. Just a slight dirty garnet glint when held up to the light. Mild hops that balances out the rich malts."

"Overall pretty good, nice malts, decent light hop balance, quite creamy and smooth, nice chocolate and light roast, but it does get a bit too acrid as it goes."
"Poured from growler into a pint glass. Very attractive pour with an almost black appearance. Very lively with a generous 2+finger mocca head that hung around for a bit. Almost stout looking. Smell was very woody and earthy. Burnt notes, perhaps some figs and carmel. Taste is very similar, but getting a lot of the wood characteristics on the front end. A bit of coffee, earth/dirt and carmel. Complex and busy. Again, a bit like a stout. Feel is rich and creamy with a good bit of carbonation and life. Medium to thick on the tongue. Overall- An interesting porter. I enjoyed the complex taste and limited hop profile. The wood/earth taste was a bit powerful. A strong porter IMO and bordering on a RIS. I like the creativity and blend of flavors. Not a bad brew at all and I'd hit another. It's more of a sipper. Worth a try-"
""
""
""
"What's the gobbledygook on this? ""People's Porter is a robust, English-style brew, with a dark, ruby hue. Complex chocolate, coffee, and toffee notes give way to an herbal bitterness, finishing with a pleasant hint of espresso."""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a solid porter with a full flavor. Easy to consume this one. Definitely worth trying this one."
""
"People’s Porter is another nice release from Foothills Brewing Company. They brew some really good beer. This one could be improved with a slightly stronger nose and a bit more body. Damn tasty as it is though. Easy recommendation."
"I wish this saw MN distro because it is so approachable but complex enough to satisfy any porter lover."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"People's Porter pours black, with just the faintest bit of ruby red highlights. Three fingers of khaki colored foam rise up atop the beer and stick around for a minute or two. There's a bit of lacing left along the glass, but not necessarily a ton. The nose has lots of caramel and a smooth chocolate aroma. The flavor's got a good bit of roast going on, though it's trending more towards coffee than chocolate here. A healthy dollop of caramel rounds out the malt profile. There's a light bitterness, and distinct earthy/herbal hop finish that's almost too intense at times for a relatively malt driven the style. The body is nice and firm, giving solid support to the malts, and the carbonation is just enough to cut through the sweetness and let the hops have their say. People's Porter is my first beer from Foothills, and I'm really enjoying it. I almost want to say it's too hoppy for its own good, but that's not quite the case."
""
""
""
""
"Well, this is a gorgeous porter with a great smell, and unfortunately the taste just doesn't live up. Disappointing."
""
""
"The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium to light carbonation. Quiet drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I like this quite a bit."
"Overall, a really great porter and one I would like to try again either bottled or served on regular CO2."
"O: I definitely will pick up more of this brew -- a superb example of a medium ABV porter."
""
""
""
"Not a bad beer, but the taste is very one-dimensional. Heavy on the char and the smoke, and I just want more different flavors, more depth, more something. Not my favorite porter."
"Overall: I was pleasantly surprised by this brew, as I expected it to be a pretty standard porter (perhaps fooled by the name!). In fact, it's a very rich and tasty beer, with some complexity as well. Perhaps it's not as complex as some of its counterparts, but it's certainly no standard porter. Recommended!"
""
"Overall an ok beer. It tastes like a pretty average porter with the usual tastes. With no freshness date on the bottle I wonder if I didn't get an old bottle as the finish tasted quite stale. Oh well, this showing was pretty average."
"O: Strange metallic presence in the taste really drags this one down. It's too bad, I had high hopes from the aroma. It's drinkable enough to finish at least."
"O- i am not a porter fan by any means but this brew is very good. it makes me think i might like porter. Very sweet yet bitter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A flavorful, roasty porter which, after warming at least, has none of the flaws found too often in porters (e.g., too smokey; burnt notes). More complex and satisfying than most porters, this is an excellent example of an Amer./English porter. [4.25]"
""
""
""
""
"O: People's Porter is a quality example of an English Porter. It went down quick and was a pleasure to drink. Thanks again Ryan."
"O: How does one mess up a porter? There's really no way to do it, and I'm proud to report that Foothills doesn't do it either."
""
""
""
"This is a very enjoyable beer. It's balanced, smooth, drinkable, enjoyable. I will definitely have this again in the future."
"Overall, this was quite good for a porter. I highly enjoyed it and would welcome more of it anytime."
""
""
""
""
""
"If not for the slight tang in the taste, this would be the perfect porter. I CANNOT WAIT for the barrel-aged version, but I promised someone I would share."
""
"Notes: Bomber picked up the day it was bottled, and had shortly thereafter. Fair porter, good quality bracket, but in line with the overall benchmark impression I got from most Foothills brews. Now, I´d gladly have it again when passing through the town."

"O: A very drinkable porter with a pleasant bitter taste. Would pair equally well with fish and chips or a juicy burger."
"O: This is an easy drinking yet quite tasty porter—the flavors never lost the interest of my taste buds through the duration of drinking a 25 ounce bomber."
"O: A solid English Porter, not outstanding, but solid."
""
"A very dark brown colored beer with a khaki colored head. The aroma is quite roasty with a little bit of toffee and chocolate. There is a little bit of toasted malt and perhaps a hint of coffee. A little light in the flavor department; it’s sort of watery. There is a definite bitterness to it, however. Still, some roasted malt and a light toffee and chocolate sweetness to it. A bit of a let down."
""
""
"O: An enjoyable English porter but not an amazing one. Considering this used to be a pretty local place for me before I moved, I probably enjoyed it more times than I would if I had to work hard to locate it. Overall just a hint of too much bitterness to be an easy drinker."
""
"Not a bad beer, but where's the depth? If the taste doubled-down on the nose, this coulda been a contendah. One-note, but still strangely appealing & slips away easily. Decent enough."
""
"This beer is beautiful. Pours close to black with an off white head. There is great retention and beautiful lacing. Aroma is outstanding as well. Lots of roasty bitter coffee. A bit minerally which I am not the hugest fan of, but very nice nonetheless. The beer is crisp and roasty with some coffee, a mild earthy hop character, a little bit of smoke, and a bit of nuttiness. The roast is verging on being overdone, but I think it is not quite there yet. Mouthfeel is thin yet somehow has a fine, creamy carbonation. It does make it very drinkable, but I would like a bit more body."
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied but a bit thinner than expected with a good balance of roasted, sweet and bitter flavors. There's a decent amount of roasted malt that gives off a subtle smoke character but it never feels burnt or overpowering. Hints of bitter dark chocolate, toast, caramel and oatmeal dominate the flavor before finishing with a lingering hop bitterness. Surprisingly hoppy for the style with more dry bitterness than I prefer. This element takes away from the more pleasant malt flavors and unfortunately begins to dominate things as I work my way through the bottle."
"Rich aroma has burnt wood, unsweet chocolate and quality coffee notes with undertones of molasses and licorice. Got my mouth watering! It pours an opaque dark-chocolate brown with a thick, fluffy and rather persistent light tan head. Delicious flavor lives up to the aroma, having roast coffee, chocolate, molasses and licorice tones plus a hint of caramel and a bitter hoppy undertone that actually helps round out the flavor rather than detract from it. Texture is the beer's weakest point - body is on the thin side, it seems, for a porter, and there is just a little fizz."
""
""
""
"o - overall a nice porter, not my favorite. a bit too much burnt chocolate for me, but enjoyable. robust indeed."
""
""
""
"O: It's a B- beer for me.  Many others are above this for me. Not bad by any means, just not the best porter."
""
""
""
"Dark, opaque, nearly black color with a solid head of tan foam that soon shrinks to a creamy cap. Somewhat sweet dark chocolate and slightly charred black malt aroma. Increased black malt in the flavor along with an added dark fruitiness. Roasted chocolate and coffee with some earthy bitterness. Medium, roasty, and drying. A little better on tap, but a worthy addition to the Foothills bottling line."
"Taste is a little too bitter for me. It feels like Olde Hickory Hickory Stick Stout. The wood feels bitter and astringent, and almost out of place. Smoothness is absent, and I miss it tons."
"This is a good local Porter, to me Green Man gets the nod here by just the slightest bit. I will have to give it a try in the bomber once they hit the shelfs. I rate this a B-, due in part to the bitterness and the lack of real complexity."
""
"Good effort from Foothills here... Nice session porter here...."

"O - A very nice porter. Holds it own and is pleasant enough to be quite sessionable."
"Color is a deep, dark chocolate brown that is barely translucent around the edges, and a big, thick head that takes a while to dissipate. The aroma has some toasted malts and hints of bittersweet chocolate and black coffee. The bitter coffee and chocolate continue through the flavor, with the overall taste being somewhat similar to Guinness. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but good."
"O-The beer is a drinkable porter. It is flavorful enough to be a session beer with enough bitterness to balance the beer."
"Growler from Riverside beverage company in Chattanooga. Dark black, puffy tan head. Smells good, roasty malts and very inviting. Flavor was rich, hint of dark chocolate but none of the coffee that other reviewers have noted. Overall this was very tasty and I was not sad I chose this over the hoppyum this time. I think I may need some sexual chocolate at this point..."
"O (D) - This is nice. Good coffee flavors."
"A drinkable, enjoyable beer that I'd be glad to enjoy again in the future."
"D: An extremely drinkable porter."
"Beer is thin, light in body, probably a little too thin but it makes for an easy drinking dark beer. There is some lead off sweetness with a mild roasty / bitter finish. Mildly hopped, overall a good drinking but rather boring beer. It was fine."
"Pours a deep russet brown color with a thick tan head and a good amount of lacing. Smells of roasted malt goodness, chocolate, and a little touch of coffee. Tastes of tons of roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, and some coffee. Mouthfeel is medium with a fair amount of carbonation. Drinkability is high."
"D: Quite drinkable, although for me, a porter isn't something I'm really into throwing back a lot of... that being said, this is really good stuff and I was impressed."
"Overall impression: Good stuff, worth seeking out."
"Foothills have proven their worth with big beers and sessionable beers alike. People's Porter is just another impressive brew on their can't-lose roster."
"I love this beer. It is my favorite offering from Foothills. It is absolutely delicious."
"Pours very dark brown with a nice off white to tan head with a bit of lacing and moderate retention time. Nose is roasted malt with a bit of light chocolate and coffee. The taste is a bit bland with only the roast really coming through, though that itself is well done. Somewhat dry with a good body. Drinks pretty well."
"HV"
"Overall, this is an excellent porter, up there with some of my favorites of all time (Smuttynose's Robust Porter comes to mind). If you see this on tap around the Southeast, do yourself a favor and IMBIBE."
"I also was able to pick up a growler of the barrel aged version of this beer, and I will review that after I get a chance to try it."
"Fairly creamy body, lighter mid weight. Drinks great after dinner or on its own in quantity. Should try if you can."
"Drinkability is immense. This is a tasty, easy-drinking porter. A very nice dark beer for the summer."
"One of the highlights of my trip to NC. Exceptional porter, exceptional beer overall. This beer incorporates elements of an American robust porter, without pushing things too far off style or hurting drinkability."
"huge complexity for a standard porter and a perfect example of why porters are my favorite style when done right."
"D - Pretty easy to drink. A solid representation of the style and a good beer but it certainly isn't the best of the style. This is a good fallback beer if I can't find anything else I really like."
"D - I really enjoyed this beer. It's another solid NC offering."
"Overall I was excited about trying this beer and it didn't let me down. A very well-done porter with excellent subtleties. Well worth a shot."
"D - This is fast becoming one of my favorite porters, if not my very favorite! This stuff is good competition for Great Lakes' Edmund Fitzgerald, another fine porter. The People's Porter is easily one of the finest examples of the style out there."
"The mouthfeel is thick but finishes nicely, not cloying in the least. I could drink quite a few of these. Not too bad at all."
"A heavy-handed pour results in a big, thick head that takes a while to dissipate, leaving a ton of lacing all over the inside of the glass. The color is a deep, dark chocolate brown that is barely translucent around the edges. I'm a little stuffed up, but I can still identify the toasted malt aroma with hints of bittersweet chocolate and black coffee. The bitter coffee and chocolate continue through the flavor, with the overall taste being somewhat similar to Guinness (in a good way) but with a more roasted character and greater depth of flavor. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but the overall drinkability is terrific."
"D - This beer is tasty and keeps you coming back for more."
"Just stopped in for a growler fill from the source on the way down to Myrtle Beach, not overly impressed. Quality across the board was lacking, one beer like Sexual Chocolate shouldn't really make you a BA destination. The beers were acceptable just not stellar, I would like to try the SC imperial stout if the chance comes my way. This one appears pitch black with large tan head with a mocha brown tint forms a nice cloud rising above the rim of my Foothilss pint glass. Aromatics offer roasted malts with dark coffee accents and a hint of dark chocolate. Alot of black patent malt more dark cocoa and roastiness than sweet and creamy. Flavor does have a mild lactic twang to it but more robust roasts come to play with herbal hop background peeking through, a touch of dark chocolate and mild coffee. Finishs dry with those herbal hops and dark roasts in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium to fuller bodied and carbonation was on overall I can't say anything bad about this brew, I thought it was the best of their lineups smaller beers and my wife loved it I had a glass and a half the rest my wife took care of on vacation."
"Reviewed on 06/21/2009. I had this on draft. This beer pours brown with a small head. The aroma is of coffee and roasted malt. The flavor is of bitter chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. Robust palate and quite delicious. This was a surprisingly top-notch porter."
"I received a growler of this from Loki in the Growling at the Moon growler exchange. Thank you! Poured into my nonic pint glass and appears a rather dark, but still translucent rich chestnut color with about a finger of creamy ecru foam. A thin, sporadic lace is left by the head as my glass slowly empties. Nose consists of medium roasted grains, sweet milk chocolate, cocoa, and earthy hops. Very nice! Flavor brings chocolate egg cream sodas to mind as well as toasted and caramelized malts and grains, mild chocolate and coffee notes. A few notches better than medium bodied with ample carbonation for the style. A highly drinkable porter. Glad I had the chance to try it. Most definitely a porter for the people."
"On tap at the Saucer and served in a English Pint glass. Poured a nice dark brown color with a 2 finger head. There was minimal lacing. Roasted malts and chocolate dominate the aroma. The taste has bitter chocolate, coffee and toffee. It is a little then but not so much that it is distracting. A nice sessionable porter."
"D-A solid, go to, good to have in the regular line up porter. All the highlights I like with hints of chocolate, roasted malts and coffee. Nice and smooth with plenty of flavour without going over the top."
"Pors out a dark brown, not quite black color with ruby highlights. The head is loose and tan colored, and it sort of fades fast, leaving a little lacing. The smell at first is of crisp carbonation, with a whiff of powdery, sweet malts, with a tiny hint of roasted barley/coffee in the background. About normal, but not as deep as I'd like. The taste is nice, a little raw, but nice. There's a dry caramelly maltiness, backed with big roast barley/coffee notes. I can also sense a bit of a hoppy flavor in here, which is interesting. There's a bit of a chocolate flavor, but its dry enough that its hard to notice. There isn't as much depth as I'd like, but I think its the dryness (a quality I've noticed as common in Foothills' dark beers). Just needs a bit more in residual sugars. There's just enough sweetness that it doesn't ruin the whole thing, but there isn't enough sweetness to really make it great. It's like a battle that neither side is winning. The carbonation is a bit prickly, but this one is about as full as I'd expect, but your mouth feels, well, I think it goes without saying. It's really easy to drink though, and not too high in ABV. The drink is enjoyable, but not stellar."
"M - Thin bodied, decent carbonation."
"The drink is on the heavy end of the medium-bodied spectrum and is one silky-smooth quaffer. Rich, creamy, and delicious."
"Drinkability: What an unexpected and pleasant surprise in the most unlikely of places. This is one of the best porters I've had in quite some time and manages to hit just about all the right notes. The alcohol's low and nowhere to be found, to boot. Just a really good, all-around enjoyable porter - recommended if you see it on tap."
"this porter is extremely drinkable! an outstanding beer from foothills!"
"Great crisp mouthfeel that felt nice and slightly tingly in the mouth. Wonderful flavors of dark chocolate, roasted nuts, coffee, and some dark fruits wash over the palate. My wife doesn't really like darker beers, but loved this one. Great warming brew to enjoy a colder evening with. Delicious. Recommend."
"Glad to have this on tap where I work,poured into a stadard pint glass a a deep dark brown wirh some ruby highlights thruought the glass,a very tight formed beige colored one finger head atop.Aromas of charred fruit,dark roast coffee,and molasses,I love the char.Flavors are alot like the aromas,quite charred and fruity with just a hint of smoke,there is a molasses-like sweetness to it and a nice dry lingering finish.Smooth as all get out,just an awesome porter from Fotthills.Good job Jsmie."
"Medium bodied with good carbonation to match."
"Overall, I again thought this one was excellent. There was really nothing I could fine wrong with it and it is remarkable that beers this good are coming out of NC and nobody knows about them. If you really want to try and excellent porter, get one of us to send a growler of this your way. Trust me, you will not be disappointed."
"Excellent flavor for an English Porter stlye. Roasted malts, toffee, rye, biscuity sweet chocolate, and coffee grounds came together with a pinch of hops to make an excellent flavor profile. Mouthfeel wasn't overly special, but still quite good: creamy, medium body, nice carbonation, and a solid, bitter finish. For 5.7%, this is one hell of a porter. I'll definately be filling up a growler of this next time I'm through Winston-Salem."
"All in all though, this was a very well crafted, tasty and hugely quaffable Porter from Foothills. I just missed this on our last visit back in November, so it was a pleasure to finally be able to try it."
"Way too drinkable. I was at a bar with 40+ taps and could spend the whole night drinking just this. Excellent porter, excellent beer. Go to your local tap room and order a pint. Go to the brewery and get you a growler. Or, trade for a growler."
"Frankly, this is another hit from Foothills, a company with which I'm rapidly becoming enamored. This is a classic pub porter. Well done."
"Prosit!"
"Had this one on draft at the Brewpub in Winston Salem. On some levels, it is not much different from most average porters. I am, however, much more accustomed to American style porters. The flavor was definitely on the robust side, with subtle coffee and cocoa coming through in the aftertaste. Very warming on a cold rainy winter night for a beer of normal alcohol strength. I hope to see this at the Raleigh Flying Saucer so I can have it again this winter."
