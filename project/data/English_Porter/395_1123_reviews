"o: A very good porter, although the bitterness level seems perhaps a bit higher than most.  Tasty notes of milk chocolate and black coffee along with some smoke provide just about everything one would expect in a flavorful porter."

"O - Like I said above, a very fine beer but more like a stout."

"O: Chocolaty, even for style."

"2.75 D: It's not a bad beer, but it's simple and the flavors it focusses on aren't the right ones."

"Feeling some cocoa and caramel tones but the burnt malt wins out in taste. Its followed by an almost watery feel. As for the taste, it's a nice Porter in line with the genre but the residual watery mouthfeel is a bit distracting."

"This is a pretty smooth and nice drinking porter. I feel like it's definitely better as it's warmed up. The one thing I dislike about a lot of the porters that I try is that the flavor profile drops off so fast. This is not like that at all. Super smooth and great character. Even has a little vanilla in there it seems. A great drinker. Could easily go for several of these in one sitting."

"O: This is a decent porter. It's a bit light and thin for the style, but it is still solid. For me, the only real problem with this beer is that it just doesn't stand out from the crowd."
"Extremely dark brown with next to no head. Roasty aroma with some dark chocolate, liquorice and molasses. Flavor started slightly sweet, with some coffee, more chocolate and long, dry finish. Light to Medium body.BBC is not on my favorite Brewery list from the 2 brews I had from them. The beer is drinkable, just not very memorable."
"Overall a pretty middle of the road porter. It is good but nothing really stands out."
""

"O: A little disappointed that this one gushed all over the place immediately after opening. (Note, open ALL beers over a sink just in case) Otherwise, smell was right on point with a classic english porter. Taste was a little bitter and notes of wood char came through a little more than I think a classic english porter should but I still liked it. I would not seek this beer again, but if offered I would not turn it down."
""
"O: The beer is drinkable but nothing really stands out in the taste as being very interesting."
""
""
"A huge let down..."
"Overall a really nice little porter I was very happy with"
"A highly enjoyable English porter worthy of trying. My bottle was several months past ""best by"" and held up very well."
"O: This isn't a bad beer by any means and fairly enjoyable. If in a grocery store, I'd buy this. If in a proper beer store, there's probably 3 or 4 better options when in the mood for a porter."
"This beer was given to me by a friend who wanted to know if I had ever had it before. I hadn't so I gave it a try. Dark Star poured out like any porter should. It had a nice dark body with a tan colored head on it. Even with the darkness the beer was almost see through, it could have been a little darker I think. The smell was nicely roasted and had just a touch of hops coming through. The Mouthfeel was just a bit too light for a porter I think. This beer isn't terrible, but better choices are out there."
"A bit too thin in my opinion for this to be a very enjoyable porter. Not bad by any stretch but no wow-factor other than the initial smokey character."
"A really solid and representative example of a sessionable porter. A winner, and one I'd easily return to, or refer as a fine and drinkable beginner's porter."
"This was my first beer from BBC, a company who I consider to be a local brewery in my KY territory; and it was a fine start. Very enjoyable and robust all in its own. While it's certainly not a mind-blowing porter, it doesn't necessarily do anything wrong. Consistent and enjoyable."
"Bottle nearly burst open when cap removed, foam going everywhere... an aggressive brew. Poured a stout-black with ample, rocky head. Nose of malt, alcohol, and anise. Tasty, sweet roasted malt, alcohol driven hop bite in the back. Aftertaste rather sweet for the style. Heavy body and low carbonation - perhaps due to the explosion when opening? Decently enjoyable to drink."
"Overall less than stellar. My first beer from the blue grass state and I'm hoping it gets better."
"D - Fairly drinkable for a porter but it's rather plain. Chocolate and cocoa are pretty thin through the whole flavor and mouthfeel."
"D = Not bad, I will revisit it periodically more because it's a local brewery than for any other factor. There doesn't seem to be a lot of complexity."
"Notes: Another one from my past that I'm revisiting. This is a good solid porter, especially for the price."
"D: I could have a few of these. Good offering from BBC for what it is. It was a $1.45 for a single so you really can't go wrong with a sixer of these if you want a decent porter."
"Body is crisp and bubbly. Carbonation level could be tamed down a bit for the style. Flavors of old coffee, mild dark chocolate, and a crisp hop bite on the finish. This is a good Porter, no doubt. Thankful for the opportunity. Thanks again, Rich."
"Pours a dark brown color with a lighter brown along the bottom of the glass. 2 inch head of a pale tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of yeast, sweet malt, slight alcohol, toffee, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of an American Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and sharp with a high carbonation level. Tastes of coffee up front, roasted malt, slight sweet malt, hint of smoke, and a slight hop finish. Overall, a heavily carbonated porter, but still has a good body and blend."
"Poured chilled into a pint glass this black-brown beauty is dark indeed, with a fair light brown cover that fizzes down to a dainty layer pretty quick. Lacing is decently spiderwebbed throughout. The aroma is a respectable molasses chocolate with bitter coffee at the edges. Very nice if you like molasses, and I do. The flavor brings out much more of the bitter coffee, very nice with just a suggestion of chocolate and molasses over it. Sweet but plenty bitter to tickle the tongue. This is a little bit under mid-bodied but thin in a way that only makes it more drinkable, somewhat refreshing in fact. It goes down easy with plenty of taste. Perhaps a bit more aqueous than some would like but I am quite pleased with this for a summer's evening porter with a healthy flavor in keeping with the style."
"Dark brown color that is similar to the color of black coffee. There is a mocha shade to the head. Clean attack and flavor. The presentation of the flavor is very mild and you experience the mouthfeel as much as any flavor. There is a dose of coffee close to the finish. This carries through the aftertaste and leaves the drinker with some coffee notes that are present in the aftertaste."
"Drinkability: This is a nice drinkable porter. I'd find it quite easy spend an evening drinking just this beer and I'd be happy to buy another and another."
"D: Again, skewed by the carbs. I would REALLY like to give this brew a shot at it's brewery or at least on tap. I think the brewer has a great idea on his/her hand."
"Drinkability: I could have two or three of these. This is a good, not excllent porter that is true to the style. A pleasant surprise"
"Dark ruby with a thin brown head. The nose is heavy, a nutty malt with some plum, coffee and caramel, and some esters in the background that didn't appeal too much. The first taste is dominated by the robust, nutty malt, the coffee is lighter and in the background mingling with the plum and esters, and a hint of chocolate. Medium bodied, smooth and easy to drink, paired well with the burger I had."
"Drinkability - Due to the carbonization of this it is a bit hard to take multiple sips one right after the other. I also don't quite like the burnt bitterness of it but if that is what you like then it here. Perhaps I could warm up to this style, given enough time."
"I've had this in a bottle as well as on tap at the brewery in Louisville, KY. The appearance is a very dark brown, almost black. The smell is an exquisite blend of coffee and dark chocolate of which made my mouth water at first whiff. It tastes very complex as a porter should. The consistency is a bit thin in comparison with other top notch porters. The mouth feel is just right with enough carbonation but not too much. The drinkability of this porter is the best of any porter I've tried. This is by far my favorite porter and is definitely my favorite ""every day"" beer. Simply delicious."
"Damn good flavor as well. Crisp, slightly bitter, very nice. Creamy mouthfeel and so easily drinkable. I have enjoyed my three beers from BBC. Never had anything from them before but the three I had were decent, solid beers; this was no exception. I would most certainly purchase this one again."
"D - It is a drinkable beer if it's your cup of tea but I doubt I'll be seeking this one out again."
"This is a medium to full-bodied beer. A pretty smooth texture. From the onset, you can feel the carbonation on the tongue. The taste starts with a slightly sweet start with a coffee middle followed by a subtle bitter finish to close it out."
"Drinkability: While there is nothing remarkable here, it is just a nice, straightforward porter that is easy to drink; touches a number of elements that make it interesting enough to come back to, if I have the chance"
"D - It's a decent porter overall and would be a nice session beer as well."
"Medium-light body, with moderate carbonation. Overall a fairly mild porter. Roasty character is evident in both aroma and taste, but is restrained. According to the style guidelines, this is pretty much right on for a ""Brown Porter", though I think it would be better with a little more body, and perhaps a little richer flavor."
"I got my bottle of this beer from a 2-month subscription to the microbrew of the month club."
"Beer of the Month selection. It's pretty dark, with some reddish tinting around the edges when held to the light. A modest head forms on top and lasts a while. The nose is not extremely prominent, but has nice notes of roasted coffee. Not too roasty to taste though: a good smooth blend of cocoa, a little expresso, medium-dark chocolate. Moderate bitterness dries things out a bit, with a light malty finish."
"There are better options out there even if you like where they're going with it. Much like their alt, it's not bad per se, it's just not my cup of tea."
"M + D: Something seems to be missing a little, but I can't quite place a finger on it. Carbonation is quite mild and suitable, body isn't too big - making it smooth and easy to drink. ABV is noted on the net as 5.21, which seems about right."
"D: A definite change of pace porter, but not one I'll go to very often because the cherry-berry sweetness is a bit much."
"Pours a decent opaque color with some head and lacing, but not much for a porter. Excellent scent, a very strong coffee aroma with hints of burnt grains. Excellent taste, a nice smooth coffee flavor with just a hint of alcohol at the end. Goes down fine, an excellent porter to try."
"D - I am a fan of well made porters and this one while not very well blended, has excellent malt and is very nicely balanced and yet not shy on the hops either. This has very dark charred malt too which reminds me of barbecue which isn't for everyone, but in the small amount here is tasty like the slightly burned crust of homemade cookies."
"A very easy drinking beer, but so full of flavor."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Creamy and velvety smooth in the mouth. Nice long aftertaste. This beer is full in body, I really don't think that you could ask for more from the mouthfeel dept. of this beer. This is a brew I'll be revisiting, I'm glad I've discovered this gem. I really urge you to try this if you've not had it before, its a damn fine beer...just be sure to drink it out of a glass, believe me it makes a world of difference. I didn't think that much of this beer until I drank it out of a glass, it is much different."
"A dark brown color, almost opaque, with hints of red along the sides of the glass. A two inch thick caramel to beige color head, that laces slowly down the glass. A burnt scent at first, then sweet malt takes over, followed by the distinct aroma of coffee and chocolate, with dry bitterness at the end. A medium bodied feel aat the start, that gains weight as it rolls across the palate. This is a solid porter good color and flavor, the aroma was bit of a slight let down. That takes nothing away to the fact that this is a good, solid porter."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's thin and light bodied. Probably a little too thin for this style. Carbonation level is pretty good. It's relatively smooth and drinkable. Drinkability is somewhat limited by the flavor. Overall, it's a decent offering. Worth a try."
"A decent porter, but nothing really special. I like their Bearded Pat's barleywine better."
"Nice porter, nothing that special. Pours a clear dark mahogany with only a few reddish highlights at the bottom of the pint glass. Head is tan, fairly small and fades fast. Not much lacing. Smell not really there, faint roasted malts. Tastes pretty good, roasted malt and some bitter chocolate. Very pleasant, very smooth. Slightly thin mouthfeel but aside from that, a nice drink. Very drinkable, a solid but unremarkable session beer."
"drinkability - Very nice porter, would try this again if I could."
"D: This is a nice beer but the burnt flavor subtracts from the enjoyability. It doesn't come across as a porter, there is a little too much of a stout. Probably worth trying but not worth seeking out. I will have to try a fresher sample (and update then) to make a good decision but I suspect this is not going to be one of my favorites."
" Prosit MK"
"Aroma is pleasant, chocolate and roasted notes. One the palate, all roasted bitterness, cocoa, both hop and char bitterness in the finish. A bit too much bitterness without a lot of complexity...certainly a decent beer but does not thrill. Likely better on tap, worth another try when at a BBC brewpub."
"Meh ... I wont be seeking this one out again. But a fairly enjoyable beer."
"Very impressive porter, deserving of others if I have a chance."
"Drinkability: Quite good. I could have enjoyed a few of these, but there were other styles I wanted to try."
"Drinkability: so-so at best. This just didn't hit the spot for me personally since I felt this was a bit thin."
"Poured an opaque black with a thin diminishing head. The aroma was of dark and chocolate malt with just a hint of pine hops. The taste was very well balanced between dark malts and bothe pine and citrus hops that were not afraid to do their job, even for a porter. The beer is light and crisp with a decent carbonation. This is a very enjoyable porter."
"M&D - light bodied, but full flavored, smooth and easy down. a nice sessionable porter, i would definitely buy this again, and in greater quantities"
"Overall this is a pretty straightforward and tasty porter that is worth picking up. There are other porters that have more depth but this one is solid enough to revisit now and again."
"Comments: Flavors nicely melded & work well in combination. One of the better examples of the style that I've sampled. Wish it was available in MA!"
"D: Tasty, goes down easy, not too filling, good kick & good representation of style (even though I think this one might shade more toward the Baltic style). I could drink a few of these and its a good beer, but it wouldnt be the first porter that I would choose."
"Dark mahogany brown, almost black. Thin head with minimal lacing. Light aroma with hints of coffee, english hops and walnut. Surprisingly weak flavor. Dry all the way through, with a very light, uninvasive presence. Mild, dark roast coffee, a hint of plum and walnut, finishing with vague herbal hopping. Very, very dry and nutty. It's ok, but kinda bland and underwhelming."
"Got this one for Christmas from my Kentucky-dwelling brother. Pours out nearly black with hints of dark brown; practically no head. Smells of bread, dark chocolate, and the similar dark roasted aromas. Upon tasting I think of mossy soil and mostly generic dark roasted flavors. A little flowery, but not much. Could pack a lot more interest for a porter. Moderately bitter finish. Thin and watery in the mouth; needs more carbonation. Not great, not horrible."
"Drank a 12 oz bottle of this with a May 2007 best-by date. Pours an opaque black with a thin, tan head. Decent retention. Smells of roasted coffee, toasted grain, some dark chocolate. Tastes much of the same - coffee, chocolate, dark toasty flavors. Not as strong as I would like. Mouthfeel is good, a tad on the watery side. Overall, an okay example of a porter - not nearly as strong and complex as I would like."
"Pours a dark coffee brown with caramel highlights and nice lacing from the head. On the nose, some nice malty chocolate notes and bitter roasted malts. Typical aromas but well done. The palate follows the nose, with some nice bitterness from the malts throughout and a tinge of initial acidity that I assume is from the hops. Nice mouthfeel, perfect weight and carbonation. This is just a really solid porter, true to style and very sessionable."
"The beer had a near opaque body, with ruby highlights. It formed a slight off-white glass ring, from the stadium pour. It did form some nice sticky and stubborn lacing. The nose had a light roasted, dark chocolate scent. The mouth was medium, with a very low carbonation. The beer didn't pair well with pulled pork, but was alright by itself."
"Beer pours a deep brown color with a good head that dies down with some decent lacing. Faint malty aroma, good roasted malt flavor that is balanced bitterness at the end. Rich mouthfeel but not cloying. This ale is pleasantly drinkable. This tastes like a porter should. Good stuff."
"Not a bad Porter, but nothing that memorable. Too heavy on the hops at the expense of what could be a rather nice, rich and creamy maltiness."
"An easy drinking beer with nothing standing out too much - nothing bad and nothing stupendous."
"O--Its an okay porter, from a mid-level brewery. Its not their best offering, and it doesnt hold up well to the really famous porters like Fuller's or Edmund Fitzgerald, but it's a nice take on the style. I wish it tasted as good as it looks."
"Drinks okay, just an okay porter"
"This beer pours a dark brown with a light brown head. The head settles into a nice lacing. The beer has a nice roasted malted hops smell with a hint of coco. It has a nice blend to its taste not too over powering and it has a clean after taste. Its a smooth and creamy beer with a clean feel and a good finish. I would say there isnt much spectacular about this beer but it is a great tasting quality porter. Defiantly worth a try."
"A dark brown beer with bright ruby highlights. Has a thick creamy light brown head with very good lace. A delicious roasted coffee character dominates the aroma with hints of milk chocolate and vanilla in the background. The mouthfeel was a little light for all that aroma. The major flavor characteistic would be light bittersweet chocolate. With just a hint of snappy hop bitterness on the finish."
"Drinkability: Recomended to me from my local beer seller as a ""Try it you'll like it"". And I must say I indeed was verry impressed with both the aroma and the taste of this beer, and would recommend this to anyone who likes a good Porter."
"Drinkability: A solid porter that's very easy to drink and easy to make a session out of. Solid on all accounts I think. My second Bluegrass brew and another that I've really enjoyed."
"Flavor is again slightly sweet, and has notes of thin french press coffee. The finish is dry, and dominated by a roasted grain bite. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, although the flavor lingers for quite some time. Drinkability is excellent."
"Poured a dark rich color with a nice head that keeps its retention. Smell is very malty with touch of coffee. Taste is a lot like an espresso with a light hop note. Mouthfeel is full but not as heavy as expected. This is a delicious beer that would be quite drinkable often."
"Altogether, not a bad brew, quite drinkable. I'll have to head up to Louisville to try this on tap."
"-UF"
"Mouth-filling texture, yet not rich. Thin/watery quality. Esay to drink but not one I will likely drink again."
"This beer is served at the Brewery in a pint glass. The head is lacey and white with a hint of yellow in it (could have been the lighting, wasnt the best). The beer itself was thick and black-brown. The smell was full and almost nutty. The tastes was strong at first but not to prevent from drawing in a big mouthful. It was a rich smooth mouothfeel and quite drinkable, as a growler was taken home."
"Served in a pint glass from the bottle the BBC Dark Star Porter pours a very dark brown, with not much of a head at all. What little head there was disappeared very quickly. It smells very nice, like coffee, chocolate, caramel, and roasted malt. The taste is mainly chocolate malt, with some roasted coffee flavor too. There's a bitter aftertaste that stays around a while after drinking the beer. The mouthfeel is pretty thin, but this is a very drinkable beer. I'd recommend this to anyone to drink, it's a good selection from BBC. I remember having it on tap a few years ago at the BBC brewpub, so I think I'll have to make another trip to Louisville and try it on tap again."
"Drinkability - I probably won't have this one again."
"Drinkability, in my estimation, was better than the draught version. I think this porter needs to sit for a while."
"Not much to recommend in this beer except that it would make a good session beer. With a light body it's not very filling, low carbonation and a light, inoffensive taste it'll take a lot to really notice this beer."
"I am a bit disappointed in this beer. I remember it as being quite a bit better in the past. The label has a best before date of last month so I suppose it could be a little past it's prime, but it has been in the fridge since well before. Not a bad porter at all, I'll have to get more to make sure this bottle wasn't off."
" I can definitely recommend this Bluegrass selection. It isn't much to look at but it has it where it counts. I will definitely be on the lookout for this in the future."
"Pours a deep brown color with solid amber to ruby highlites with a 3 finger head that settles to a healthy tan cap over the beer. Solid looker, though could be a shade darker. Nose is solid, with moderate to solid roast notes, leaving impressions of coffee, though with a lighter nuttyness hanging below it. I enjoy the aroma of this one. Flavor presents a more nutty profile, with roasted character being more prevalent in the aftertaste. The flavors here could be a touch more bold. I'm getting more of an American Brown vibe from this than a porter. That being said, this one still tastes good. Feel is solid moderate with a touch of creamyness and a light-moderate carbonation. Sold and where I expected it. Overall, this one deliveres, but slightly underachieves as a porter. Call this one Dark Star brown ale and I'd be more satisfied. Still nothing that sticks out as a flaw, just needs a bit more behind it."
"A nice, drinkable porter. I would like to have just a bit more uumph in the body...."
"Taste consists of dark malt flavors up front. Significant bitterness towards the end. Dryer than most other porters Ive had. Smokey aftertaste. Pretty nice mouthfeel. Good amount of carbonation and easy drinking. A solid porter. I would drink this again."
"Beer pours a deep brown with a decent head that is floating on top. Nose is a slight hint of the chocolate malts. Taste starts nicely with a compliment of those chocolate malts and ends well balanced with a chocolate dry hop finish. Mouthfeel is very good, velvety smooth and creamy. Drinkability is good. This is an extremely smooth drinking beer that is definitely worth a shot."
"Beer pours almost black, but held to the light you can see a ruby appearance. Frothy brown head with little to no lacing. Very soft carbonation. Smell has hint of roasted coffee. Taste consist of coffee and caramel with a smoky like aftertaste. An enjoyable beer."
"Taste is a burnt maltyness. Leaves your mouth with a wetness that is not the normal effect I get from a Stout-like beer. Carbonation is nice. I cannot taste any chocolate, just a burnt sensation. I thought it was pretty tasty, in the beginning, but drinkability seems to be getting worse as I go."
"Tasty at the beginning but too odd, and gets worse as the glass empties. A little too watery for the style, as well."
"Dan excellent brewto me, it is like drinking a cold espresso. Could drink several more as I really enjoy the coffee and cocoa combo."
"Drinkability: A nice, simple, eminently tolerable porter. What more could you ask for?"
"I love the British Broadcasting Company so I was delighted to see they also brewed, but youd think theyd be based out of London and not Kentucky oh well.. Roasted coffee beans aroma. Brown/black with a frothy head. Chocolate malt and some unexpected tobacco tinged flavor. Not a bad flavor just a little unexpected. A very nice sipping beer that finishes well."
"cheers..."
"While it sounds like I'm trashing it, Dark Star is fairly tasty, but not my top pick. Definitely better than your average beer, but there are many better choices out there. I was hoping for the best after finding this beer from my hometown of Louisville, but next time I think I'll try one of their other styles."
"The flavor is similar to the nose, all malt. I get some sweet chocolate up front then roasted malt and some burnt caramel. The roasted flavor lingers on my palate for a bit. The beer is very easy to drink and I think I could down a few of these quite happily on any given nite. There is no hint of alcohol anywhere and the smoothness and good flavor make it a winner!"
"This was my first beer from Kentucky; it started out with a great deal of promise once I poured it in the glass. However, I found myself liking it a bit less with each sip. I can't recommend it, given the large number of (in my opinion) better American stouts out there. However, as always, YMMV."
"drinkability: pretty drinkable"
"Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: Somewhere between watery thin and light bodied. The buttery texture probably moves it towards light bodied. Maintains a sort of fizzy carbonation during drinking."
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black, color with a tall pillowy tan head that coats the walls of the glass with sheets of lace as it recedes. Nose is chocolaty roasted malts along with a touch of earthy peat. Taste begins with sweet malt and burnt coffee followed by unsweetened dark chocolate and dusty cocoa. A mild herbal hop bitterness is present in the finish along with more of the same burnt coffee that was present upfront. Not great, but worth a try if you get the chance. Thanks to yakko for the sample!"
"Being from the distribution area, this is a beer that I have enjoyed ofter, buy only lately found new appreciation. It's big on the roasted barley, chocolates, and coffee flavors. More subtle in the nutty, barley, and toffee flavors. The BBC 'Americanized' this style by loading it with hops--so much that the tan head shows a slightly greenish tint. It's aromas are what you'd expect from a very hoppy porter with slight acidity and bittering from grain or husks. It's moderately thick and creamy. Finishes quite dry, despite the big sugars. Has a slight metalic flavor and shows some roughness in the swallow."
"thick brown pour with no head or lacing. aroma smells like a mix between dirt and grass... some sweaty aromas and a bit of maltiness to go along with all the weirdness. tastes better than it smells, although it has a very penny-like aftertaste. in the foreground are light notes of roasted malt and european hops. a little too crisp and bubbly for my tastes, and overall too light for me as well. not a beer i'd revisit. maybe a bad bottle, but ill have to see this on tap in order to attempt a rereview."
"Highly carbonated with a thin body, this yields decent flavor (nothing special, but decent), and a nice aftertaste. Seems just like a basic porter to me that's easy to drink and decently flavored, but just ordinary."
"I liked this American Porter because it represented the style very well. I would like to have this again sometime."
"from the bottle to a mug, fairly aggressive pour. Dark black color with a thick caramel creamy foam, visible flecks of something, makes me excited, 9reminds me of a few great barley wines). Light in the aroma, but did catch a bit of roasty sweetness, can't tell of what though. Taste is all right, notice a few subtleties to it (coffee, chacolate?) but the beer is a bit watery, not as thich and full bodied as the appearance would suggest. I've heard bad things about BBC from a few folks, so this is the first one of thier brews I've tried. I would say that while not the best porter, it was an enjoyable drink, and I'm now going to plan an outing of my other brew brethren to check out what else they have in store. I'll let you know ...."
"This isn't a bad porter, but it seems a bit thin to me, and not quite as robust as I would like. Give it a whirl anyway."
"a little thin on the tongue, so the flavors were not concentrated. still a nice session porter, though"
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice, earthy black malt scent that is roasted and dry. There is also some hop aroma as well. The taste is good. It has a smooth and rich patent and roasted malt flavor that goes down with ease and finishes dry and earthy. It has a slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a fine American porter. It has good aroma and taste; an excellent sessions ale."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a little 1/4"" of tan head over the clear mahogany brew. Head, although diminutative, seems to stay constant, with average lacing for the style. Aroma is dark, roasty grains. Taste is dark malts, with a citrus note in the middle, then fades back to the slight coffee bitterness and chocolate sweetness battling it out. Mouthfeel is excellent, extra smooth, and the drinkability is great as well. Worth seeking out."
"Mouthfeel has nice creamy aspects as well as a good medium body. Good for the style and seperates it from the stouts. I could have a few of these in one sitting...but it's not one I would search out. A good porter overall. Thanks to merlin48 for the opportunity to sample this brew."
"Beer pours a fairly dark drown with light reddish brown tints around the edges has a finger sized tan head that falls to a cap of foam, spotty lace. Aroma is slightly subdued coffee hints on lightly toasted caramel malt light pine hops some hints of chocolate. Taste is lightly roasted malts some light caramel sweetness still present light coffee flavors and bitterness and hints of chocolate and hops finish it off. Overall not a bad porter but nothing to jump up and down about, riding the middle lane between sweet and bitter. Mouthfeel is almost medium not a very robust porter. Drinkability is good, not exciting but very drinkable"
"Soft, sweetish milk flavors up front. Notes of chocolate come through mid-palate. Lightly bitter and roasty into the finish. Has an overall metallic echo to it. Finish is a tad bitter with lingering roasted sweetness. Not that impressive, but decent enough. Medium-bodied with a slightly creamy mouthfeel. Thanks to kmpitz2 for this bottle."
"Pours a very dark color with a moderate tan head that sticks around. The aroma is dark and roasted malts and a little chocolate. Nice. The flavor has a lot of roasted malt character, but there is also some smokiness that makes things interesting. This is a pretty good porter. I'll probably have this again."
"Drinkability is good. Great if you consider it was an airport bar."
"Largely brown, close to black in the middle with ruby highlights, especially when held to a light. The appearance is not as dark or dense as many Porters Ive seen. An off-white head of a finger quickly formed and then rapidly faded away to a foamy cap, thicker around the edge of the glass. The head retention could have been better. Subsequent lacing was spotty and it didnt cling well. The bouquet is soft with notes of coffee and chocolate being the focal point. It seems like the coffee has just a touch of cream in it. The nose really isnt that complex nor is it that potent. There is an invitation but all it really says is, Im a Porter. I translate that to drink me. So I do. The palate is straightforward and simple, however this doesnt mean it isnt tasty. This is a good Porter. The malty flavors, like the nose, are coffee with a dash of cream and some stray chocolate notes and a small amount of roast. Towards the finish a fair amount of hop bitterness is found. The hops seem to impart a small amount of grassy flavor. As the aftertaste is formed a muddled dry, milky, malty, roasty taste settles on the tongue. This could be improved. The mouthfeel is a bit slight, it isnt grossly thin but it is rather weak for the style. The carbonation is moderately low but workable. This plenty drinkable and likeable enough to drink again but I can think of many other Porters Id pull off the shelves before this one. However if it were not for SheepNutz I would have never tried this one at all, so thanks!"
"Dark Star is a wonderful porter from the Bluegrass state and those of you who have ready access should be grateful. As I am grateful to SheepNutz for giving me the opportunity to sample this delicious beer."
"Drinkability - easily my favorite from BBC. Serious taste, not too heavy, not too high in hooch. Yum."
"This is a decent porter, but it just doesn't do much for me. Very middle-of-the-road. I would prefer more body and roasted character, a smoother mouthfeel, and less hop flavor. The horse-shit aroma only bugs me if I swirl the glass. Still, it's enough to keep me away from a 2nd bottle."
" Interesting bit of an American porter."
"Sorry, this one is not for me."
"Appearance: Pours a dark ruby brown with a tan head that dwindles pretty quick, but it dows leave some nice tightly packed fine lacing all around my chalice. Aroma: Not getting too much strong tones but there is a nice mellow mixture of milk chocolate and very mild coffee roasts. Taste: Has a peculiar chalkiness in the finish but before that it starts as a relatively sweeter porter with the dry finishing notes of the deep roasted malts mild coffee tone to it with the creamy chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied porter not bad a bit overcarbonation, not overly impressed. Drinkability: A decent session porter I wouldn't shy away from this one next time I see it but there are many better offerings out there."
"Dark brown colored body with a timid and fleeting head. The aroma is a bit sharp and roasty with a little chocolate. The same follows into the flavor with a little toasted bread flavor in the middle. This is not a bad porter, although it is slightly metallic toward the end."
"12 oz bottle with ""best before July, 04"" date on label. Pours an opaque, deep brown, nearly black, color with a short lived tan head. Some webs of sheet lace were left behind. Nose was somewhat subdued, with burnt coffee highlighting a background of smoke, cocoa, and anise. Mouthfeel is creamy, with medium carbonation and a mild bite from the hops. Taste is based on caramel malts and is highlighted by dark roasted coffee, a hint of bittersweet chocolate, some smokiness, and some underlying floral/herbal hops. Finishes with a dry and bitter chocolate aftertaste that lingers for quite a while. A middle of the road porter that is very drinkable with its light body and absence of anything to overwhelm."
"Murky muddy brown color with a low, beige head that sinks quickly. Aroma is hops backed with cocoa and raisin. Flavor is complex, with many nuances jumping out at different times. Initially caramelly, followed by cocoa with some chalkiness. This morphs to bitter coffee as it rolls toward the back of the mouth. The finish brings out raisin and molasses, and a hop bitter lingers in the back of the throat. Medium carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel. Fine webbed lacing all around the glass. Nice selection, could use more roasted maltiness for my tastes."
"Though I'm not an enormous fan of porters, the BBC Dark Star Porter was surprisingly good. It poured a clear dark brown color. I don't remember much about the head. It tasted bitter with a noticeable but slight sweetness. It was fairly malty but it didn't seem as heavy as some other porters I've had. We had this at a hotel bar and it made us go try out the rest of their lineup at the brewery."
"Color is a burnt burgandy black toned liquid with slivers of deep ruby red sparkling inside. Soft and puffy tannish head that sits thick for a brief stint, fades to a loose collar and thin broken haze on top, lace in sparatic strings and globby spots. Smell is slightly burnt roasted malt with touches of cocoa, some light dark caramel and coffee beans with some light spiced nuttyness. Taste has a nice overall tight and lasting little roastyness, slighty burnt, slightly dark roast coffee note. Light hop bitterness builds within the roasted malt base and adds a bit of sharpness, but keeps a spicy herbed surface that is benefiting the dry flavor profile and helps to purge the palate. Finishes very nice with milk chocolate coming in with a cocoa powder-like feel and texture in the drying aspects which also has some coffeeness and nutty drying mixing in there which dissipates nicely off the palate. Feel is medium bodied, clean, dry, roasty, and altogether smooth. Goes down with amazing ease and has a relaxing bite and complexing subtleness in its drying. A very nice porter! Thanks Brent!!"
"Dark black color. Medium head. Aroma is malty with a touch of dark fruits. A medium bodied porter. Malts are slightly roasted, with a touch of fruitiness, kind of sweet. Hops are a touch spicy. Kind of a middle of the road porter. There is a slightly weird taste that I cant place, but it doesnt detract too much from the beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"A solid offering from this brewer, the body is decently dark without being opaque and it comes with a noticeable chocolate head and OK lace effect. The nose is mostly of roasted caramel malt and this parlays into the flavor as well. The richness is somewhat less than desired because the body tends to be a bit too thin and just a tad watery. Drinkability is quite good as this is not as heavy, filling, or heady as some competing beers of this style."
"Another big thanks for AKSmokedPorter for this one."
"Dark caramel color topped by a light tan head. Head shows good retention, maintaining a collar throughout the duration of the glass and a nice film atop the beer. Strong roasted malt and coffee aromas intermingled with dark fruits and a touch of hops dominate the aroma, but wisps dark chocolate and sweet cream appear as well. Smells more like an imperial stout than a porter. The taste is dark chocolate, fruits, coffee, roasted malt, and a strong bitter finish. Almost like eating chocolate covered coffee beans. The roasted coffee notes linger in the aftertaste. I'd prefer just a touch of sweetness to balance out the dark flavors and this would be about perfect, as this one is rather dry. Still very enjoyable and a very good porter. The mouthfeel is solid, with a good creaminess and moderate carbonation. The drinkability is pretty good, especially if you like a long roasted aftertaste. This is a very solid offering from Bluegrass, and I look forward to trying some of their other beers."
"I had this beer in a nonick pint glass poured from tap. It pours a dark black with 1 finger of medium tan head. There is a good amount of lacing left on the glass. The smell is not as strong as other porters, but it has a good burnt malt and caramel smell. The taste is very malty with molasses and roasted coffee in the taste. The body is a little weak, but isn't really bad. The drinkability is very nice for this fairly smooth porter."
"Much thanks to Marc77!"
"4's across the board for this one. Poured out to a nice, black color with a decent aroma of chocolate and malt. Taste is well balanced with plenty of rosted malt backed up by just the right hop presence. A very, easy to drink porter. Porters don't seem to get enough time in my 'fridge. Time to change that. I paired it up with a filet mignon I had just grilled. It was a very good compliment to the beef. I'd drink this one again."
"Two notches shy of black, with brilliant flashes of clear deep garnet when held to light. Thick, fluffy, light tan head leaves dense, muddled lace. Dryish, slightly burnt roasted malt and understated powered cocoa dominates the aroma; dark caramel malt is secondary, but adds a toffeeish undertone. Hints of sweettart prune esters add contrast. Caramel sweetness initially in flavor is offset by a burnt combination of black patent and a rounder, slightly smokey dark roast coffee note. Hop bitterness builds on the roasted malt foundation and adds a sharp, but herbaceous edge that serves to both dry the flavor profile and cleanse the palate. Both malt and hop bitterness subside late, allowing soft, milk chocolate to surface and meld with the mild, tracely tannic coffee presence to lend a lasting impression of Mochachino. Very well attenuated, almost dry stout like in mouthfeel, but this inobtrusive lightness doesn't detract from the dark malt and coffee character. Finishes mostly dry, with slightly nutty, woody hints of chicory along with bitter baker's chocolate. A delicious, well rounded porter that's not a ""java"" porter outright-- coffee is present as an undertone. Light on the palate and quaffable, indeed."
"Pours with a good head that leaves a little lace and some stays to the end. A very dark, almost black, ruby color. Nose is sweet nutty. Starts as a mix of hops and malts and ends with a hoppy finish. Reasonably smooth, a good porter, medium body - definitely not chewy."
"Malt and hops married well from up front to the aftertaste and some fruit flavors crept in midway through, only slightly marring the rich chocolate malt character."
"This robust porter a very dark black with a fine tan head. The lace clung to the glass. The aroma was malty with a fair amount of chocolate in the nose. The taste was by far the best part of this beer and maybe the best tasting porter I have had in a long, long time. The flavor is quite complex and in NOT subtle in any aspect. The first thing that grabbed me was the sharpness from the roasted. The flavor started dry and finished the same with a hint of chocolate. The warmer the beer gets the more the malts come out in both the aroma and taste. The one chocolate playing upon the other. The mouthfeel was a disappointment. It was moderate at best but actually was more light. I highly recommend this truly exceptional beer for all but particularly those who enjoy a fine complex dark beer."
"Poured a deep dark black with brownish edges. Also produced a pletiful tan head that had better-than-usual retention (good lacing too). The aroma was very roasty with burnt cocoa and sharp coffee. The taste was awesome, the same roasty qualities with a rich coffee, very slight hoppiness, and an overall smooth, heavy mouthfeel. A very good porter - very rich, hearty, satisfying, delicious, balanced...I could go on and on."
"Pours black, with some ruby highlights that shine through when held up to the light. Small head that did not last, some sporadic lacing. Roasted malt aroma with hints of coffee and dark chocolate, and some spicy hops in the backround. Medium bodied with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Coffee flavor dominates with notes chocolate. Finishes with a sharp bitterness, coming from the roasted malt, and a mild herbal hop taste. A very nice porter, easy to drink and tasty. Not too heavy, would make a nice substitute for coffee in the morning. Quality brew, only low point is head retention."
"Almost black... just a touch of amber showing through, with a persistant tan head that leaves rings of lace down the glass. Aroma is malty... a bit of chocolate with a subtle spicy hop backbone. Flavor begins malty with a touch of carmel... then becomes coffee-like and a bit astringent. Finishes with some herbal spice and bitterness. Has a somewhay prickly moutfeel with a medium to full body. A very interesting porter from a good regional brewery. Cheers!"
"Tasted at the Barrelhouse Brewing Company Microbrew Fest on November 9. Dark mahogany color with a thin milk chocolate colored head. Aroma was of faint chocolate. Very good roasted coffee bean flavor that was somewhat sharp. I do think it needs to be tweaked a little for a more rounded flavor."
"Named after the 1953 Kentucky Derby Winner (the brewery is located in Louisville, Ky., home of the Derby).  Nice roasted caramel aroma.  Distinct coffee notes, with spicy hops and a hint of chocolate in the finish.  A little on the mild side for a robust porter, but on the plus side it pairs well with food."
