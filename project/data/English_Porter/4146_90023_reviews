"This is a great Porter from the tap. The chocolate and peanut butter is subtle and not overbearing. Very drinkable pint after pint."

"Thanks, JesseLara, for the opportunity"
"Pretty nasty. It taste somewhat like plastic and mineral water"

"Peanut Butter Cup Porter is not what I thought it would be. A peanut butter porter would have been fine; sweet, somewhat nutty, easy to drink. Actually, the beer does meet these prerequisites. However, the fruity ester note from the aroma is the first thing I get from the beer's taste. Melded together, the flavor is okay, and it does retain an easy drinking behavior, but whether it's tap lines or the beer itself, my sample was not what I was expeting."

"O- Disappointingly thin, not a lot of peanut butter cup as advertised. It was not worth the cost of the pour. I would steer clear of this unless this happens to fall into your lap."
