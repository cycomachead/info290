"The taste has the Porter qualities I tend to look for minus the smoke. It features the more traditional chocolate and barley malt flavors, a decent sweetness, and a dry finish that lingers briefly at the end."

"Serving type: bottle"

"Overall: Good porter, probably fits certain tastes better than others. Closer to the brown ale end of the spectrum than the stout end."

" The taste is pretty great -dark malt with a variety of roasted and semi-sweet chocolate with some mild raisin-like yeast flavor combined with a slight spicy hop in the background which adds to the complexity with a toffee like dark sugar and mild fig-like flavor. The taste has a chocolate covered raisin effect with mild spice to keep things interesting -a mild dry finish and light alcohol makes it very drinkable. Overall I was really impressed, I have kind of found this style to be less impressive lately but this is an exception to the rule as it was satisfying and drinkable with pretty decent value as a bonus. I recommend this to anyone who likes this style."

"This beer is an utterly black ale. It has a lastin brownish head and a multifaceted roasty, malty, earthy aroma. There is a little fruit...some plum and berry. The taste is semi dry, with a lot of dark malt and roasted grain. Chocolate milk and mild bitterness. Malt. It is a mildly heavy Scottish ale. Dark and luxurious,"

"The beer pours dark black in color, like a good black coffee. The beer pours with a half a finger’s width of small bubbles the color of sand dunes, which leaves a lacing of medium bubbles that leave a sticky, thin webbing on the glass. In body, the beer is too dark to look through. On the nose, the beer smells light and bakers chocolate with nice toffee notes and hints of coffee with cream and sugar. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet with a good drying bitter from the light roast, and a soft touch of fruity acidity in the finish. In flavor the beer begins as light dark fruit notes, dancing somewhere between plum and raisin, though never touching upon the richer raisin notes. This light fruitiness slowly blended with smooth roasted malts, smooth and a touch of metallic flavor. The finish rings with light roast and a touch of lactic sugar, while the aftertaste gives light hints to the ginger in the middle of the throat. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a soft carbonation that tickles the tongue with a light scrub. The beer feels slick and leaves a little coating of saliva as it exits the tongue, leaving the mouth wet yet roasty dry. Overall, this is a damn good English (Scottish?) Porter with some nice unique notes from the ginger that help to give fruitiness to the beer. Try this beer."

"Final Thoughts: This is a very well done Porter and walks that line of being easy and interesting very well. With this Williams Bros has earned its place as one of my favourite Scottish Breweries. I suddenly want to hunt down a bottle of one of their Scottish Ales."
"This is a nice and robust porter (in a slightly more English tone than American). Mild smoked and peaty thing going on. This strikes me as what an English porter should be. Smooth feel. Very easy to drink. Glad to be able to try this one out and, again, glad to see something different from this brewery than their lineup of gruit style ales."

"Really tasty and flavourful porter. A really solid example of the style with lots of nice rounded flavour and easy to drink. Not too imposing or bitter, and it actually has a pretty respectable complexity for being quite light. I would like to try it on cask."

"Very nice, An easy drinker. I could have whizzed through a few more of these. I wish I had bought more. A welcome twist and change of pace from my usual porters."
"This pours a dark brown/black color with a light brown head. The scent is rich and robust with roasted malts, caramel malts, and coffee tones. The taste is bold but not quite as bold as what you get with stouts. The texture is smooth and reasonably light. There is a sweetness and cocoa flavor that is very prominent. It finishes with a slightly chalky after taste. Overall a pretty decent porter."
"Overall: A little sweeter than I would like, this is still a nice Porter that adds some Winter Warmer elements, as another BA noted"

"Overall, this is a very nice porter."

"overall: It was actually ordered wrong. Ordered other beers. So i wasn't planning on drinking this, nor did i know about the existence. But as it turns out, this is a very lovely porter. I like the way it integrates the dark fruit flavor without dominating, giving it just that little more freshness and originality to it. Well done!"
"O: Very enjoyable beer that goes down easy."

"Quite a lovely porter, pours quickly and easily creating small head which doesn’t dissipate completely throughout the drink. Quite a spicy, dark and thick beer with a bitter quality throughout the taste. Another fine product from the brilliant William Brothers Brewery, this is one of my favourite beers and a frequent buy when I am in the mood for a Scottish ale! If you can get a hold of it, give it a pop!"

"It's a good porter but it's not what I hoped for."
""
""
"This a well made, decent tasting but largely unremarkable beer with little depth or complexity."
"Overall this is a very enjoyable beer. One nice side effect of the thinner body is that it goes down so easily. One question I am left with is would this be as good a beer without the spice. Of course, I don't know. But as it is it's pretty damn nice."
"Overall: not what I expected, sort of like a winter warmer meets porter. Drinkable but not something I would go out of my way for."
""
"Poured a quarter inch mocha head with average fade. The body is a dark burnt umber brown color, almost coffee. The smell is very mild for a porter, even warm, but there's some roasted malt and cocoa. The taste mirrors and exceeds the smell. It has a nice oatmeal stout texture, smooth, creamy, almost milky. A good porter."
""
"Enjoyed at Rattle and Hum in NYC. Served at room temp, pours a deep brown, not quite opaque. Cask pour had no head to speak of. Had a slight smoky scent, peat maybe. Not overpowering in any way. Taste was remarkable, slightly sweetened plums or other dark fruits, smoky peat, whiskey attributes. Smooth, easy to drink, had no carbonation to speak of. A really nice offering."

"Overall, I like this beer, it's a tasty, solid porter which is more interesting than many other UK porters. It's good, but not great."

"Very nice porter that is great for eating some psuedo-English pub fare. I had more than one!"
""
"Then I read the label...ginger. That's it. Ginger not liquorice. A sort of Christmas Ale version of a porter."
"This is a very non-agressive beer that offers a fine balance along with some crispness. All in all a fne quaff from a small Scottish brewer. Check it out if you come across it, because ""if it's not Scottish, it's crap!"""
"O - This is a really tasty English Porter. Glad I tried this at 44 Stone Public House."
"D - Solid porter with a nice twist of ginger."
"Overall not bad, very creamy and lactose, nice malt flavors, not too bitter, nice chocolate and vanilla flavors, but could have had a bit more carbonation and bigger body, and maybe a hint more hops."
"The brew pours a dark cola hue with decent carbonation that leaves behind a creamy fast vanishing two finger head and a rim of lacing,the smell is nice and roasty with hints of chocolate,tobacco,coffee,liquorice and spicy hops,the taste is very similar with hints of chocolate,coffee,roasted toasted oats,liquorice and finishes with a spicy hop bitterness and overall a very pleasant porter and very drinkable cheers."
"O: The beer is easy to drink but I’m not sure if I could have more than one of these in a single sitting."
"Overall, this is a fairly modest and unassuming beer, but it has just enough richness in the flavor to keep it interesting. At 5.6% and a bit on the dark/roasty side, it's surprisingly refreshing as well."
"Poured into an imperial nonic a near jet black except for a few ruby highlights when held to the light,a 1/2 finger beige colored head that held well.Carred aromas with some black licorice really standing out as well,a bit of dark fruit and bitter chocolate as well.Heavy roast and charred dark fruit flavors,I was surprised at the dryness and the roast it was alot like an American style porter in my mind.A little sharp and thin in the feel but its a nice roasty porter,one I would buy again."
"OVERALL: A decent beer for sure, but I would choose Fuller's, or even St. Peter's before this one. Glad I was able to give this one a go, but I don't think I'll go back."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a decent beer to drink for a while especially if you like casked porters."
"A Porter with a twist. Dense and rich-colored froth adorns the top of the dark-brown-leather-colored ale. Smells of muddled raisins, brown sugar and vague spicing from the hops and alcohol. Medium body. Dry toasted malt with hints of brown bread, touch of molasses and an even more faint charcoal and crystallized ginger flavor. Woody hops, kiss of ginger, nutty oats and a drying cocoa powder all in the dry finish. The small addition of ginger root works extremely well here. A versatile beer: sessionable, or an easy beer to pair with."
"I poured this drink into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was very dark for sure. Black more like it with a chocolate colored head. The smell of the beer was very chocolate also and I had high hopes for the beer. However the beer tasted like a flat coke or Pepsi. I don't mean just flat I mean it tasted like Coke a Cola. I will not buy again."
"500 ml bottle, best before July 2011. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch and a half frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, oats and a bit of coffee. The aroma is nice overall, and mostly sweet. The brew tastes like roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and some ginger, along with a slight mineral taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. I think this is a good porter, there was just something about the taste of this brew that I liked a lot. I'd buy this again in the future."
"Pours a three finger, light tan head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Black color, no highlights. Nose is baked chocolate. Medium carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Flavor is baked chocolate, some malty sweetness. Nice porter. $4.00 for a 500ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, ME."
"D - I would not shy away from this. Solid for both drink only or with food."
"Drinkability-This is on its way to being a drainpour so I can't give it much; I didn't like this beer."
"D: A really quality beer. Very interesting and fun. Definitely recommended."
"Could do with perhaps some more seemless integration of these elements but still very nice."
"Pours a fantastic dark black with some wonderful head and decent lacing. Great deep scent, some nice roasted grains with a slight coffee undertone. Great flavor, a deep dark roasted malt taste with coffee tones and a slightly chocolate undertone. Goes down very smooth, if a bit dry. Wonderful porter."
"Pours like a thick coca-cola and floats a dense caramel white head. Smells clean, perfectly roasted, and slightly creamy. And the taste is quite that is smooth. That little ginger root gives it the spice. Not to harsh and just enough kick to make it unique. You Scotts know how to brew a great dark beer. Cheers!"
"Drinkability: This is a very nice, easy to drink porter though it is not a beer of which I would necessarily choose to have 2 in a row. I would be happy to have another in a few days or a week though. Maybe it's the burnt flavor that makes me feel that way but this is a bit different, yet very good, porter."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English Porter."
"D - Decent beer but not great. I would drink this again but wouldn't seek it out or buy if I had other options."
"Thin half finger of brown foam which doesn't stick around for long, leaves random islands across the surface, given this, more stickiness in the lacing than expected. Blackish-brown in color, opaque but not in a monolithic manner, light glimmer of burnt orange around the rims. Firm, well-packed nose of cocoa, dry dark chocolate, carob and a strong does of ginger, coriander spices, even a pinch of cayenne, the roast not acrid nor coffee-like, more like slowly roasted grains, has no distinct fruit nor citrus scents, long, if unobtrusive, presence in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, muscular presence, not immobile but you have to exercise those throat muscles to prod it down. The Indian cuisine like spices of ginger, cumin, anise and curry clear enough that they push most else to the side. This also hardens the contours of the cocoa, carob flavors. The carbonation moderate at best but does fit the general tone nicely. Odd that, again, virtually no fruit, citrus or other vaguely ""sweet"" flavors. This is a very intelligent and well-crafted beer, however, one that should be used in select circumstances, preferably with food."
"Pours a clear, black color. 1/3 inch head of a tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of hops, sweet malt, roasted malt, oatmeal, and slight dark citrus. Fits the style of an English Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is also a slight dryness associated with this brew. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, hops, slight dark citrus, hint of wood, hint of smoke, and slight spice. Overall, good blend, complexity, body, and appearance."
"D- Enjoyed it very much, would drink my other one if it was not already part of a trade deal."
"A tad thin, but not watery. Carbonation causes a not quite creamy body but pleasant. Very drinkable. Not a whole lot to it, but a good drinkable Enlgish Porter."
"D- Drinks quite well. I would have had multiple glasses of this if there weren't so many other beers to try tonight!"
"Smooth, rich and very 'moreish', I liked this a great deal."
"Big porter that almost drinks Baltic. Would go again."
"Notes: Worth the cask try but nothing particularly memorable. Good brew in any case... I wonder if part of the subdued taste is in part due to being an imported cask being on its last legs. Typically 3 weeks + to cross the Atlantic and get through customs for something like this, right?"
"Interesting; memorable; unique."
"The mouthfeel for me was much too carbonated, very sharp and hard carbonation, with a medium to thin body"
"Cherry black with a head that might make other porters jealous: tall, smooth, camel-colored, firm, and resilient. Wonderfully upfront with aromas of chocolate, coffee, malted milk, and a mellow ginger vibe, plus a nice mango/peach fruitiness, a wink of vanilla and just a hint of herbal hops. Tastes very reminiscent of root beer, no doubt from the combination of caramelized dark sugars, vanilla, herbal hops, and the light spice of ginger. The flavor segues from cherry cola into coffee, closing with a bitter finish of mocha and citric hops. Quite dry, although I fear the dryness comes at the expense of a fuller mouthfeel and richer malt character - but of course, this is a porter, not a stout, so the lighter body is not really inappropriate. Overall, this is delicious and interesting; the ginger is a welcome innovation, subtle yet noticeable enough to make this stand out among standard porters."
"D - Very easy to drink but I think after a couple in a row I would move on to something else."
"Notes: 500 ml bottle poured into an Imperial Pint glass. Best Before Date on bottle was MAY 2010."
"D - Pretty good. In spite of the intense, bizarre, herbal flavors - it is still pretty good."
"Very nice beer, but don't buy a case, try as part of a mix or simply pick up a couple off the shelf, if you can find it."
"Overall it is a great example of style I love and feel that I do not see enough of in the US or UK. Goes great with food, especially curry, and spicy stir fry! It is unique, delicious and very well crafted."
"Other comments: This is an astounding porter! Even though it was a bit too cold when I sampled it, the complexity was fantastic. Really well balanced and scrumptious as hell! Need to get some more of this!"
"On the whole a really nice beer and a success for this Scottish microbrewery."
"M&D: the texture is very soft in carbonation, med-plus bodied, very easy-drinking and quietly-delicious. I take this is the fuller version of Williams Black, with additional pleasure coming from ginger and herbal hops... At 5.6%abv., this quaffable porter certainly doesn't taste as such!"
