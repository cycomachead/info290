"When I first opened the bottle, it foamed for longer than 1 minute - and kept foaming after every sip after that. Bottle I had was way too over-carbonated and harsh on the throat. Not a pleasant drink or feel at all. Maybe it was just a bad batch, but I won't be buying anymore."

"Pours very dark brown, bordering on black. Little touches of foam. Nutty malty nose, slight coffee. Very creamy taste. Strong coffee bitter which holds throughout. Smooth, rich, bitter. Strong porter. Enjoyed it greatly."

"O: pretty good and a lot better then the few other beers i have had from this company but not sure if i could drink more than one at a time."
"Overall: this is a tasty beer, well within the style. The acidity in the flavor is a bit high for my taste, but I could see myself drinking this beer again. It is surprisingly sessionable despite its ABV and acidity."

"Notes: Very drinkable a good one to pick up. Cheers."

"Benchwarmer is aptly named. While it no doubt has what it takes to make the regular lineup in many mainstream drinkers' beer fridges, good as it is, I don't think it'll be getting another call-up from me. There's just much more gifted porters out there that are worthy of the playing time. Still, if you happen to find a bottle, why not give it a try-out!?"
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Very well done and nicely balanced."
""
""
"O Decent. Not great. I wish I knew whether this one is fresh (got it at the local Price Chopper as a singleton; there was only one other one left, so I'm guessing they're going through stock quickly. . . but you never know)."
""
""

"Medium bodied, smooth...very drinkable. Low carbonation. Well balanced but not really complex. All in all a good porter that I would have again."
"Easy drinker, very enjoyable. A solid English pale ale. Another good beer from a small beer crafter."
"My only knock is that this beer is a little thin, but otherwise this beer will get a spot in my starting lineup the next time I see it."
"Sampled from a bottle with no freshness date. Dark brown, nearly black, with amber hues on the edges of the glass. Poured with a brief, short beige head that quickly reduced to thin wisps. Earthy, musty, roasted malt aroma with hints of sweet dark fruit. Smooth and light bodied with delicate carbonation. Dark roasted malt flavors up front, again with sweet dark fruit flavors in the background. A bit of dark roasted coffee flavors, and a smoky flavor toward the finish as the bitter hoppiness shines through. Finishes lighty bitter and dry. Very tasty."
" This is definately one to serve to your friends and family!"
"O: A pretty good beer, the best from CBC that I have had thus far probably."
"o - overall a unique porter for sure. the fruitiness works well, but the finish is a bit rough. this is definitely one to seek out if you dig porters."
"The cpj"
"Very sessionable, but only an adequate porter with the exception of the nose which is amazing."
"Delightfully malty. Definitely preferred this over the stout. Poured dark brown with a white head. Malty aroma with subtle chocolate. Tasted malty with some sweet, dark fruits in the background, and a bit of various sugars. Nice smooth mouthfeel, and definitely drinkable. Pretty basic stuff, but good nonetheless."
"I drank this porter in the backyard over a campfire so I must admit, it went straight from the bottle to my lips. Overall it was a decent porter. It's flavor was just right - not overbearing and not tasteless. My biggest downer on this beer was the mouthfeel - I would love for it to have been creamery. That said, this is a porter where you could enjoy a sixer if the occasion called for it."
"overall, this is a nice, easy drinking porter. sessionable. not a whole lot going on, but what is there is spot on and tasty. i would definatly drink this again if offered, i wouldnt necessarily seek it out again however."
"All in all this is a pretty divers and solid beer. If I lived in NY it'd probably be a standby. I've liked most of the stuff I've had from Cooperstown, this however is the first I've taken the time to review. Unique labels and I like the bottle caps."
"All in all I think this is a decent beer but one that doesn't stand out at all."
"Drinkability: I'm glad I discovered Cooperstown when I moved to Vestal, and it was a treat to visit their brewery last week. I was surprised at how small their operation was, but a lot of quality and old school flavor go into making their beers, which you have to like. A solid and extremely drinkable porter, and with the prices as low as they are, this is a perfect session brew for the fall / winter seasons."
"D- easy to finish and a style i have really started to get into. this is something id pick up again were it available a little closer to home."
"D. This beer is quite drinkable. It's fairly light in taste, but has enough flavor to be interesting. I could easily drink 2 or 3 of these."
"D. A nice porter, Rich roasted malts, great bitterness good balance."
"Notes: This is just a good solid Porter. It is very enjoyable, very sessionable and easily my favorite beer from the Cooperstown Brewery."
"This porter by the Cooperstown Brewery is an extremely tasty brew. The characteristic flavors, aromas, appearance, and 6.3% abv all compliment each other for nice overall presentation."
"The drink is medium in body with mild carbonation. Quite an easy drinker; thanks to Lum for the opportunity!"
"Smell is weak and almost nonexistent. Taste is good, with dark flavors of coffee and ripe apples and other dark fruits. Some hop flavor in the finish. Fairly drinkable for a dark beer."
"Pours a deep dark brown with feint ruby highlights. Produces a nice tan rocky head that fades slowly. Roasted malts are predominant in the nose with a hint of hops (fuggle possibly?) Taste is great with some decent hop bitterness and a full balanced roasted malt flavor. Mouthfeel is medium to thick. Drinkability is fair, but it seems you could get quite full on one of these!"
"not a bad porter maybe the rest of the sixer will round itself out nicer"
"D: Just the right amount of carbonation to render this a very drinkable beer. The great flavor doesn't hurt, either."
"Pretty drinkable and and o.k. Not totally exciting."
"Notes: Really solid porter."
"D: It was enjoyable but wore on me the further I got into drink. The aftertaste got to me and hurt my impression of the brew."
"Overall, this is a solid porter. It doesn't trump Anchor or Edmund Fitzgerald, but it competes well. I would recommend, but don't go too way out of your way."
"D: Not again unless I have need to expend major gass."
"Benchwarmer lives up to its name. I'm a fan of Cooperstown, and look forward to next season, when this one may get a lift. Still a good beer, this one fills out the line-up, and worthy of trying when one just wants a good beer, or to while away the hours tossing a ball around with friends."
"I do not care for this at all. One of the worst porters (probably the worst actually) I've had. I won't revisit."
"MF&D - A little thin for my likings but went down well. Worth a try."
"This poured a hazy dark maroon with tan head. It smelled like lots of roasted coffee with a bit of lemon hops. It tasted like bitter coffee and burnt chocolate, very dark and dry with earthy tones. It was watery with some carbonation, and had lasting coffee bitterness in the aftertaste. Overall this was was one of the better Cooperstown brews, but it was too similar to all their other beers. It just had more coffee flavor instead of copper flavor."
"Very drinkable and enjoyable. lighter body allows for greater drinkability."
"D - Not bad. Not my favorite, but certainly drinkable."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured thin dark brown with a 1/2 inch light tan head. Rings of lace left behind after each sip. Smells of toffee, caramel, and toasted malt. The taste was watered down bitter coffee with hints of toasted malt. The beer was thin but crisp and refreshing. Too bitter for my liking. I have definitely had better. Dont go out of your way to find this one but give it a try if you come across it."
"M/D- The body is medium to full with a nice fizziness from the carbonation. This is a very interesting brew. The slight metal flavor is a turnoff."
"Thanks again to Joe for the chance to try this..."
"d - overall a great porter. It makes me a little angry to know that I went to college 20 miles from here and never visted the brewery. this is a definite staple in my fridge."
"D - easy to have a few of these, very drinkable."
"Drinkability: The bitter flavors are too dominant here. If they were toned down and the roasted coffee was given the spotlight, this beer would improve quite a bit. If you enjoy this beer, though, this is a beer that you could drink plenty of given the smoothness and low ABV."
"Pours a dark brown with basically no head. Nose is like roasted qualities. Flavor is roasted and just an old coffee bean kinda flavor profile. Feel is standard. Just feels a touch light. Lots of carbonation. Overall this is an odd porter. I can't really put it up against others I have had as far as similarities go. The body seems lighter for a porter. Overall though it is pretty drinkable. I would just never go back to it."
"Served in a nonic, as with all my brews. Poured out coffee brown with a half inch of light tan foam. The aroma was everything you'd expect from a porter, roasted coffee. The taste was sweeter than I was expecting, leaving only a light bitter aftertaste. It went down smooth, with a light fizz. All in all, I was surprised. After so much diacetyl in all of their lighter beers, I wasn't expecting such a good porter."
"The feel is extremely dry, with a bitter afterbite and film. A tad milky even. Hefty, and not at all watery. This is a smooth-sipping beer. A nice, sturdy porter. Really really enjoyable."
"This beer poured a dark brown with reddish purplish highlights and a two-finger tan head. The smell is a is a little malty with subtle coffee hints. The taste is very distinctive of a porter, with some coffee and chocolate hints and large amount of roasted maltiness. This is a very drinkable porter, and a nice one to reach for if you're looking for something a little less intense that's still a porter."
"This beer has great flavors but is slightly too carbonated. It almost gets a little fizzy near the end."
"This beauty poured a nice dark brown, almost black, with a frothy tan head, leaving lots of lacing. Smell is quite nice, roasted malts and coffee aromas in there. These are very apparent in the flavor as well, coffee and roasted malts, going down nice and thick. Very tasty, really smooth, easy to drink. This is a really good example of what a porter should be like, I really like this beer."
"Benchwarmer has a very dark appearance, more so than most of the other porters I've tried, and there have been numerous. The most distinguishable feature I notice is the pungent coffee flavor. Not overpowering but very prevalent. It makes this beer unique and the reason its constantly in my collection. It does seem to be very foamy, but still not in a bad way. It adds to its character. It has a bit of a bitter start, but has very sweet undertones and finishes so. This is a great beer for a fall day. I will definitely be partaking in more."
"12 oz bottle. This pours a ruby hued brown color with a 3 finger light tan head over top that falls to a full coat over top. Clarity is very good and there is little to no carbonation. The aroma is lightly caramel sweet and moderately nutty, but over-run with diacetyl butteryness that borders on offensive to me. I recall that they use ringwood years here, so this is not a big surprise. The flavor is a little better. There is a solid roasted character that moves to a more mild sweet caramel and finishes with a mild earthy hop and bitter. This is much better than the aroma. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. I am really not able to move past the aroma on this one. It just rubs me wrong to have that much diacetly. It is nice that the roast malt helps to cover this in the flavor, but it doesn't save this one for me."
"I liked this one. Probably one of the better Cooperstown brews. It's simple and it gets the style right. No complaints here, and one I'd be happy to have again."
"A dark root beer color with a modest and fizzy head but decent lacing. The aroma is a nutty sweet coffee blend that is pretty alluring. The taste brings out charcoal and chocolate but has a strong sour mash background. It is fairly acqueous and very fizzy but drinkable enough. The sour quality gets kind of prominent during the first half but mellows by the second half so it grows on you as it warms and sits a little bit. I liked it and would definitely welcome this at future sittings. Pretty refreshing for a porter, too."
"After the pour and the sniff test, I was all set for a full, rich, malty, buttery porter. What I got was something less than that, but I'm not too disappointed. I look forward to seeing what else Cooperstown brings to the plate. Bigger wood, I hope. Thanks BeerTruth."
"Drinkable, but I would not sit down for a long session just with the Benchwarmer."
"Hadn't had this brew in a long time, and for some reason I was just in one of those porter moods. Poured into an Old Rasputin mini pint glass a a dark brown, with shreds of light pulling through. A nice white head sat on top with good retention. Sort of musty in the smell, but with a little spin some fruit aromas came through...roasted apples come to mind. Taste had a lot of coffee molasses going on. The overall character of the beer was roasty, with charred smoke. Mouthfeel was probably my favorite part of this brew in that it is pretty well carbonated. It gives the beer a bitter ending, while also giving it a crisp and refreshing personality. I will have no problems polishing off the six pack of this beer. It is nice to see a porter with some character. Most of the examples I have had lately have been a bit on the boring side. Now if only I could find some of their stout."
"By the way, I guess this is my 100th review -- thanks BA for changing the way I taste things and for vastly increasing my understanding of all things brewed! Long live yeast cultures!"
"Solid and warming. A nice porter."
"D - I'm very glad I hid this one for a few months...I was looking for a good nightcap and it definitely fit. This is one that I wouldn't have appreciated anywhere near as much if I had it last year (or even a few months ago). I'd definitely include this in a style sampling."
"A serviceable porter. Black with tons of foam that was a delight on the palate. Nearly burnt coffee ground tarish aroma, sounds worse than it was. Average taste with significant burnt coffee bitter sediment, perhaps as it approached March expiration."
"Sean"
" Initially the clarity and lighter than expected body threw me off, but this is a solid example of an English Porter. This could easily be used as a session beer."
"D: This is a pretty fine beer. Not of the ""watery porter"" variety. Nice balanced flavors and a good bitterness to round it out. I'll be going back to this one for sure. My new favorite from this place. Well done."
"An exceptional porter, particularly on the taste."
"Another solid offering from a too often overlooked brewery."
"Drinkability: My last review crowned Back Yard IPA as the best from CBC. This beer takes that title hands down. The flavors are full and unambiguous, giving the beer a real body. This is hereby crowned the best beer at CBC."
"Draught @ Spuyten Duyvil, Brooklyn. Ruby brown color. Hints of raisins and black currant, with a very light coffee aspect, chocolate and milky cream in the nose. Very low aroma hops. Flavor is malt accented, fruity, with dried chocolate and hints of grapes perhaps. Not a lot of hops at all. True to style and traditional."
"D: Good drinkability on this offering from Cooperstown. I like this porter as its quite smooth and refreshing with a good abv. Definately a recommended one if you can find it."
"This pours a black ruby with a huge head. There is a ton of carbonation in this beer. The smell is very strong with dark fruit,coffee, and chocolate aromas. The taste is a bit thin with chocolate and dark fruit flavors. A pretty good porter with the chocolate comming out as it warms up more. The m/f is a little too light for my taste,but this is a top quality beer that should not be missed."
"I checked the website (minutes later) and they say they use Ringwood yeast. That makes some sense as that Yeast is pretty aggressive, but this thing feels and tastes so Belgian in origin I wonder if they didnt substitute a Belgian yeast for a batch."
"Poured a deep with a frothy cratered tan head with just great lasting power it just sits thee on top with no decline,aromas are somewhat faint I picked up some bitter chocolate and a little earth but it doesnt really jump out at ya.Wow a nice airy,creamy mouthfeel marshmellow-like you could say very nice going down,a well rounded porter subtle in many ways starts out with notes of unsweetened chocolate with a touch of buter finishing quite dry eand earthy with underlying woodiness.Not overly complex but there are some nice flavors going on and the before mentioned mouthfeel makes it ever so drinkable,a winner."
"This is a really a good porter. Dark and deep this beer (having tasted it at the bewery) has a great look. It also tastes and smells wonderful, A burnt aroma is present, but not overpowering. This is a nice and smooth porter. Bitterness is tamed and combined with some sweetness that lingers on the palate. Texture is also good without being too heavy. It's a nice all around porter with little flaw."
"Drinkability: good for a porter"
"looks and smells excellent, tastes really good, but the mouthfeel could stand improvement."
"This beer might as well be called ""dark-chocolate porter."" It is very tasty porter, and one of the biggest beers Cooperstown Brewing Company makes. It pours a mahogony with a lot of lace remaining as I drink it. It is slightly carbonated. The smell is all dark chocolate. The taste is similar, with a little bit of roastiness and bitterness from the mild hops. It is one of the better American Porters I have tried, and with the essense of dark chocolate shining through very nicely."
"definitely one of the better cooperstown beers I have tried. a solid porter that is rather easy to drink and just smells great. this doesnt just warm the bench, it warms your stomach with the ABV but it is tasty. recomended."
"Have had this brew a number of times and am surprised that I had not written a review on it before. Brew pours to a dark brown color with a nice thick tan head that has a nice amount of retention leaving lacing through out. The aromas are very enticing, slight smokiness is noticeable along with toasted/slight roast scent, seems like a lots of dark malt. The taste is top notch, had a dominant chocolate and coffee like taste that has some sweet characteristics. Slight hop presence at the tail end compliments and rounds out the offering. Only giving is a good for drinkability due to the abv even though I feel I could have many of them, just might not have a good morning! It is a favorite of mine, also like the fact that it is a local brew."
"Drinkability: easily quaffable, and this can be a decent session beer as the flavor is mild and well balanced."
"This was probably the most-overcarbonated beer I've ever consumed. When I tried to pour it completely overwelmed the side of the glass and took severl pours to empty the bottle. It appeared as a deep brown liquid with reddish highlights. Smell was roasty, caramelly, coffee-like. Taste followed through nice a nice chocolate, roasted malt taste. Finish was creamy with a trace of dryness. Would have been better if the pour was easier."
"Overall a great beer, my favorite porter as I said before. I think the extra carbonation might be one of the factors that attracts me to this one over other porters. The taste is definately there, but never overwhelming. I can put these back one after another and enjoy every single one. Drink this beer."
"I liked it better than their Stout. Nice dark brown color with lots of head and lacing. Rich, full porter flavor.Roasted, with just a bit of a bite. Had a little more carbonation than other Porters I've tried. I would recommend trying this beer if you have the chance.."
"Appears a dark brown color with quite the head. The head appears tans, sticks around for a while and also laces the glass with a nice ring of foam. The taste is one of coffee and chocolate roasted coffee and burt chocolate. The mouthfeel has a bite to it. This beer has more carbonation than I would expect form a porter. It is average. Thats all I can say."
"An interesting brew from Cooperstown. There are other versions I'd rather have, but this one is quite pleasant. One of my favorites from Cooperstown thus far."
"Quite drinkable, excellent session brew."
"It has been quite some time since I have had a benchwarmer. I do not recall it being this good. I will have to add this to my regular selection."
"Pours a dark brown - nearly black  with red hues. Theres a huge, puffy head with thick lace. The smell has a notable fruit qualitynot at all expected. Also in the aroma are roasted malt, chocolate, and something very much like a sugary sweet smell. The taste is very mild, especially considering the smell. Theres bitter chocolate and coffee, just a little sweetness, and a slight roasted graininess. Peppery hop finish. Average carbonation, and medium body. Fairly quaffable and interesting, but lackluster."
"A deep dark brown with mahogony highlights. Has a good foamy beige head. There is some chocolate and butterscotch in the aroma. The flavor has hints of chocolate and licorice with a strong backbone of bitter coffee. The mouth feel was a little off from the thickness I expected. But I liked the bitterness character on the the finish, nice and dry."
"Pours a deep ruddy brown, seems like some sediment also was in the bottle. The head is tan, quite agressive, and left alot of sticky, thick lacing. Nose was of dark malts and perhaps a wiff of vinagar. Rich flavorful porter. Notes of more dark malts, cocoa, chocolate milt, cafe au lait. Nice rich creamy mouth feel. Worthwhile porter, my favorite brew from cooperstown. The only one, so far, with any ""oomph""/Balls"
"Medium bodied, good drinkability, an acceptible porter nothing special."
"I picked up this beer by accident. Good pick up. A very charismatic porter. Pours as a typical porter does, I find there is not much difference in porters. Reeks of pine and freshness that just won't go away due to the ridiculous head. Head leaves rings leaving evidence on the far side of the glass from whence you just drank. Fantastic walnut and smoke flavors, no bitterness (the good kind) at all. Cream feeling left after a gulp, nice! Defiantly a must try."
"Rich, roasted coffe flavour. Hints of bittersweet chocolate. Plums & figs along with a bit of orange. Pleasant coffe aftertaste. Medium bodied, rocust carbonation."
"Nice try."
"Cheers"
"Pours a dark amber/red with a huge beige head and great lace. Smells of an average, that is what I consider average"" porter. Nice roasted malt with coffee and chocolate notes. tastes of roasted malts. More coffee notes than chocolate though. This one can almost be described as ""tart", but it quickly turns into some nice hop bitterness on the sides of my tongue. Finishes dry and is fairly drinkable - as porters go anyway. A fairly basic but still quite nice porter."
"Mouthfeel is medium, creamy but with a sharp carbonation. Pretty easy to drink as there is not much holding you back, but not much pushing you on. Stands in the middle of the pack."
"I was expecting a more hearty mouthfeel. But the lighter mouthfeel leads to a porter that would be easy to make a session of if one so desired."
"Another winner from McCall, Thanks indeed Sir, a damn tasty Porter that I shall keep an eye out for!"
"Very easy to drink and satisfying. Glad I grabbed this brew!"
"Cooperstown Brewing does a good job with their specialty beers, and The Benchwarmer Porter is no exception. It pours a deep, inpenetrabled ruby with a thin tan head. The aroma is, as it should be, smokey and nutty, promoting the chocolate and toffee fragrances. The taste is earthy and heavy, well-balanced and finishes with a spanking of caramel. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with just the right touch of bubbly. Very much worth a try."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a dense 3/4"" tan head on top of a dark reddish mahogany hued brew, which lasted a long while. Good lacing. Nose is heavy on the malts, with coffee and chocolate predominant. Taste is of those same malts, and you have to appreciate that the aroma is not guilty of false advertising. Certainly an enjoyable and drinkable porter, worth the search to find..."
"Nice dark chocolate color with a decent head. Malty presence in the smell with light chocolate notes. Taste was lightly sweet, then a tad bitter. Some fruitiness ? near the aftertatste. Mouthfeel was substantial and full. A little heavy overall. A ggod brew if you are having one.=."
"Poured a big fat dark hazelnut colored head that was fine bubbled with a froathy top coat. The head fades slowly leaving a nice lace around the top of the deep brown colored beer with ruby glow. Rich chocolatey coffee and sweet malt aroma with a bit of alcoholic cherry in there as well. Chocolate malt bitter coffee, a little roasted nuts come together in the flavor and finish in a bitter hoppy coffee bite. The beer has a tingly feel to it, the carbonation tickles your tongue with different flavors and then after it's gone the flavors stick to your tongue for a bit. Lots of flavor and aroma in this porter, the aftertaste is pretty darn bitter, but overall a nice beer."
"Tastes exceptionally good. Full of big dark malt, coffee, and a hint of burgandy. Finishes slightly dry and tangy. Silky smooth oily mouthfeel with a hint of carbonation make this highly enjoyable. Goes great with chili. Nice job."
"Nice heavy chocolate pour with a creamy nut-brown head. A heavy smoky chocolate aroma greets the nose. The flavors meld well with a hefty smoked malt base paired with hints of black and caramel malts. The body is a bit lighter that some porters. Complex and tasty all the way through, but could use a creamier feel."
"Thick dark brown color with a thin head. The sweet malt apparent in the nose also shows up in the taste. Smooth and full bodied. The sweet malt is counterbalanced by subtle hops, yet the smoky, cocoa, coffee taste really comes out. This sweetness reminds me a little bit of a Ringwood yeast, so ripe. The beer was quite smooth and I'd gladly drink it again. Nothing fancy or interesting, but a damm good traditional porter."
"Poured a very dark, nearly opaque blackness. Tinged with ruby at the edges. Thin, tan-colored lace does a nice job of lacing the glass. Aromas are toasted nuts, coffee, some toffee, sweet malts. Flavor is more of the same, with dark chocolate, and sweet caramel dominating. Finishes with a cocoa powder flavor. Just slightly bitter with some residual sweetness on the lips. Medium-full in body and quite drinkable. A great example of the style from the folks at Cooperstown."
"Pours deep ruby highlighted brown, with a small tan head that rushes away leaving just a ring of foam. Aroma is toffee, a good bit of butterscotch, and some roastedness. Flavor is dominated with the butterscotch, with some bitter roasted flavors bringing up the rear. Medium in body, easy to drink but not that impressive."
"Mediumish body with tingling carbonation. Overall a nice, drinkable porter."
"Black with reddish highlights and a thick, tan head - extremely creamy looking. Sweet malt aroma with a little earthy hop and a touch of roast coffee. It has a great medium body holding a chocolatey, sweet malt flavors with a dry roasty finish. Very quenching while out on a steamy summer night. This would be great at the ballpark."
"This beer poured a medium sized tan head that contained fine-small sized bubbles that was mostly lasting. It had an opaque body with no carbonation and a reddish-brown hue. The nose consisited of malt, coffee and some hops. The flavor was sweet, somewhat bitter, chocolate, and coffee that left a lingering aftertaste. It had a creamy, smooth and dry mouthfeel and it was medium bodied. This beer left a good lacing on the sides of my glass. This beer reminded me more of a stout than a porter and it had a little too much of a coffee flavor for my tastes."
"Russet brown pour with an offwhite, thin bubbly head. Coffee, roasted malt, nutty and hoppy aroma. Tasted of roasted malt, toffee and some espresso, with a nice dose of hop tang. The mouthfeel was a tad thin - I expected more for some reason, but still a small complaint. Overall a nice finishing, easy drinking porter."
"Very well done and thoroughly enjoyable."
"Overall, not recommended (on draft) to porter fans. Just a fairly uninspired take on a style that dictates a little ""more."""
"The beer pours a robust dark brown/light black color with a nice light tan head that fades to a thin lace. The smell is of toasted grain and caramel malts. There is a fruitiness about it with the lingering of noble hop aroma. The taste is great. Low mouthfeel, but all the malt character needed. The abv. slips just over 6.0% justifying the ""warmer"" aspect of the ""Benchwarmer"" title. It is lighter than a few porters that I've tried making it exceptionally drinkable. I like this beer quite a bit. It's very popular among college drinkers in the Oneonta/ Cooperstown area. A home run!!"
"Cheers"
"Opaque, dark brown color topped by a thin film of persistant tan foam and specks of lace from the quickly collapsing head. Faint but pleasent aroma of clean malt with a bit of charred wood. Light to medium bodied with grainy brown and chocolate malt flavors and a touch of sweetness before the hops hit the back of your tongue and mouth with a sharp ""twang"". The finish is all chalky dry-stout-like dryness with some lingering brown bread and molassos notes. Certainly less than robust, but a very decent Porter and very easy to drink more than 1...or 2."
"The beer pours a very deep garnet to almost brown color, the head portly in size, frothy in its consistency and the lace quite thick and clinging sheets. Hints of Smoke, light toasted grains, coffee, and somewhat sweet, quite pleasant with the start heavy malt and lightly sweet, the top middling in feel. Finish has a pertinent hop spicy presence, and the carbonation moderate the aftertaste quite dry and somewhat bitter, a quite decent representative to the style and well worth the effort to find and sample."
"Gotta thank Davo for letting me in on a little benchwarming action."
"As previously noted in several reviews, this beer is best enjoyed at cellar temperature rather than straight out of the fridge. Very deep brown/black, but clear with ruby highlights. The 1/2"" light tan head holds extremely well and leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. The aroma is of a roasty, sweet caramel malt (no hops). The body is medium /light with a moderate carbonation that leaves it quite creamy in the mouth. The rich flavor starts with a lightly acidic combination of earthy dark malt & herbal hop flavor that reveals a caramel sweetness, and even some light fruitiness, as it warms, finishing dry with a lingering roast and caramel maltiness. Very nicely balanced once it's warmed. Not very complex, but rich and enjoyable with exceptional drinkability. Well brewed!"
"Slightly reddish hued brown with a great big brown head that coats the glass all the way down.  Almost smokey maltiness with some very slight burnt and roasted qualities dominates the nose.  Nice chocolate malts with an almost husky feel to them start off this brew with a quick hop bite towards the end of the brew.  With a nice medium body and a decent husky grain character I really like the way this brew feels on the tongue and it is definitely very drinkable and would make an outstanding session brew.  Thanks to pbrian for the sample."
"Huge head that spills over the top if you're not careful.  Subsides to a rocky head that lasts.  Mild aroma of roasted malts and fruity esters.  Definate ESB-like base, very fruity with a nice balance of flavors.  Hops are done well.  Minimal coffee presence, which is a nice change of pace.  Enjoyable."
"Notes: Quite a tasty porter, and a pretty big beer also. Easy on the complexities yet very flavourful. This brew gets even more desirable after it warms up a bit."
"A smooth porter with 4% chocolate malt, a dark root beer color with 6.4% ABV.  I found it at a liquor store in a suburb of Albany.  Too bad its only available in New York."
"Big foamy head and very dark color, but not opaque. Lots of hops for a porter, and they work well in drying out a slightly chewy mouthfeel, as well as imparting nice hints of herbs and dry leaves. Very tasty underlying flavors of espresso, dry molasses and earth. The finish is dry, with the coffee/espresso flavors lingering with a touch of alcohol. Really complex on tap."
"A rich and toasty, coffee, malt flavor. Brilliant."
