The blackhook when I had it was just put available on cask and I enjoyed it. I am not usually a porter drinker, however I enjoyed this one. It wasn't too thick or too much on the flavor which I liked. It was a very smooth, enjoyable beer. I think for people who are like me and don't normally enjoy the darker porter/stouts, this one is definitely a good one to have. The head on the beer was perfect, and the color was beautiful. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a mug club member there, definitely a good beer.","FishScales","Dec 07, 2009"

4.08,16.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,4,"Poured from the nitro tap at the Portsmouth Brewery into a pint glass, this dark beauty shows a very deep coffee color with rose touches at the edges, a Guinness-like tan head and plenty of lacing to boot. The aroma is a mild coffee malt with a vague hint of citrus. The first taste is a silky and clean but mild charcoal, some coffee bean and vanilla. A bit more like a stout by my way of thinking but a pleasant pint either way, quite drinkable, not very strong in any one respect but there is enough coffee bitterness to keep it interesting. I don't pick up much on the advertized chocolate side of this brew, but no matter. A very nice feel, creamy, very worthwhile on tap.","Durge","Jan 13, 2009"
2.98,-14.6,4,3.5,2.5,3,3,"I had this on tap at Gas Light Co. in Portsmouth, right next door to the Portsmouth Brewing Co. The beer has all the makings of a dry Irish stout. It is inky black, has a very smooth creamy off white tannish head. It doesn't have the efforvescence of a Guinness, but it does have the nose that points to chocolatey, roasted, and dry malts. The taste is unfortunate. It doesn't have the nice hoppy balance of a porter and it is really lacking the character of an Irish Dry Stout. It is dry, slightly bitter, but not nearly creamy enough, and just lacking an Hibernian character. This beer really isn't all that good and really doesn't do justice to the American Porter label either.","albern","Dec 26, 2008"

But, as with the other beers served here, the Porter is served fairly cold and it's difficult to pick up on the mild chocolate aromas. These appear later as the beer begins to warm. The head forms a nice lace as it retreats, and my first mouthful is tremendously smooth. This medium bodied, low carbonated beer is quite a noticeable improvement over the version served on tap. The taste is rich roasted malt with coffee and dark bitter chocolate tones. It is nicely balanced, however, and has a moderately bitter, but pleasant, finish. If this were kept on cask all year long, this might be the only beer Id drink from Redhook.","86sportster883","Jan 12, 2007"

3.36,-3.7,4,3,3,4,4,"The pour into my Fuller's nonic raises a tan one finger head over a super-dark brown glass that lets pass just a little ruby light at the edges. Lacing is pretty nice, although the head falls low quickly. Nose smells of light roast, a bit of creamed coffee, and perhaps a bit of burnt caramel. The taste is slightly roasted and acidic, sweet in the beginning, with a clean finish. The roast and sweetness mingle nicely together. Not much depth, but quite tasty. Mouth is on the thicker side, with tingly but fine carbonation. An easy drinking porter, and a nice intro to Redhook.","mjc410","Oct 31, 2006"
2.85,-18.3,4.5,2,2,4,4.5,"had this on tap at Andy's tonight. Poors out a super dark brown, but with a slightly reddish hue to the edge of it. Not as dark as the normal porter. Creamy cappucino like head. Smelled of slightly roaste coffee, tiny bit of hops, not much else. Wehre's my embers? Where's the chocolate? I dunno. The taste closely mimmicks the nose, a bit of coffee, that's about it. Slight hops bringing up the rear.

3.59,2.9,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"This beer is very delightful on cask at the Forectasters pub at the brewery. It is very dark, nearly black, with a creamy light tan, very foamy head. The head retains nicely and leave big lace around the glass. It has toasty, scarcely mocha smells, but theres not much in the nose. The first thing about the cask conditioned version is the terrifically creamy mouthfeel, it is a superbly rounded smooth substantial beer with the hops coming on slowly behind the darkly roasted malted barley tastes which are coffee, grainy, and tangy. The hops are unfortunately non-descript and seem to be doing more bittering than flavoring. The finish is medium length, and I think a more distinctive hop profile would go a long way toward fixing this. Its a very drinkable beer though, and on the low-side of the 5%-6% abv mark, so nearly a session beer. I think the casked version is much more drinkable than the other manifestations of this beer.","xoqx","Oct 19, 2006"

Tastes similarly with a bitterness that more results from the roasted character than from hops. the malts fall away quickly leaving the beer watery and characterless. It wouldn't take much to make this beer a quality brew. Add more malts to bring the beer's gravity up to par with other good porters. A bit more of chocolate and coffee notes wouldn't hurt either.

Flavor is quite a bit lighter than I expected. It starts moderately nutty and caramel sweet, moving to a pretty light roast, and finishing with a moderate hop bitterness that hangs on into the finish. There is not a lot in this one that lets me know it is an American Porter. The flavors are all fairly weak, with the roasted character being almost an afterthough. This reminds me more of a brown ale. Feel is moderate, with a light to moderate carbonation. Overall, this beer is not what I expect in an American Porter.

Taste was light for a dark beer, not as thick as expected. could taste a hint of chocolate and something like roasted pecans.

Smell isn't very strong, mainly roasted malts are detected with a slight whiff of hops. Taste is complex and balanced. Roasted malts are the strongest component of Blackhook's flavor; coffee flavor is noted. Hops balance Blackhook out nicely, and make a tasty note midway through a sip.

Feel is close to medium, smooth over all with a crisp edge at first when cold, which is periodically left behind in some sips. Not as bold or as rich as it could be, seems to lack behind - more like its teasing you into thinking it could be good, go on take another sip, hmmm...nope still the same. Oh well, perhaps one of the better offerings by Redhook.","tavernjef","May 09, 2004"

This beer has a very attractive appearance, good flavor (although, in fairness, it's probably not bold enough to be a great porter), and a smooth aftertaste. I don't detect any offensive aftertastes and the level of sweetness seems just right to me. It does taste a bit watery at the very end, but for my money, that contributes to the drinkability (if not to the mouthfeel). I very much enjoyed this beer and will certainly buy it again.","AndIWantYou","Mar 22, 2004"

A chocolate, coffee aroma dominates the senses first hand. No hop aroma at all. First thoughts are something is not quite right. Some kind of rancid foul taste that is hard to describe. It also has a metallic aftertaste too. Mouthfeel is thin. I would like a thicker mouthfeel. After this first glass I don't think I will be asking for another.

3.3,-5.4,4,4,3,3,3,"Let me mention one thing before I start. The few times I've had a porter on tap, it is always served chilled. When I buy bottles from the store, I tend to drink it at room temperature. I get more of the flavor. I'm told this tends to be the preferred way to drink a porter in some regions. I will have to find those areas. When I drink a dark beer on tap, I am all about the pour. Generally, Blackhook (depending on the skill of the bartender) will have a nice thick head that does not fade fast and has a sweet taste to it. The best quality of this beer for me is that for a lot of porters, I find after 2 or 3, my taste buds are shot or tired. But Blackhook does not tire out my senses. It may be because it is served cold, but it also does not happen when I drink from a bottle.","MuddyFeet","Feb 07, 2004"

The smells that came from this were not many, consisted of slight roasted malt, a light colored coffee (coffee that is served in your cup that is light in color d/t the cream that was added), and floral hops. The tastes that came to me were roasted malts, coffee, cocoa, light berries and fruit (very light) floral hops and a slight yeast flavor in the middle. This beer had a slight bite in the end and a floral hop aftertaste. It left me with a medium dry feeling in my mouth. A big thumbs up to the bar, they had the knowledge to serve this beer at a warmer temperature (felt like 65/67 degrees) which aided in the experience and made it worth while. I think at a colder temperature it would have lost a lot.","Jarod","Mar 10, 2003"

The mouthfeel was very interesting. It was thin enough to be a pale ale or a bitter without any of the thickness of a porter. This was a very cool interpretation of a English porter.
