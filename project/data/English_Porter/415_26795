Sleeman Fine Porter isn't bad at all by macro standards - I could see myself potentially having a pint or two of this if it were on-tap at a bar without much in the way of craft options. It's also the best beer in this sampler pack by a considerable margin. That being said, anyone who has tried a quality craft/imported English porter will probably quickly forget about this brew, as it isn't an especially great example of the style. Possibly the best beer carrying the Sleeman name, although I'll need to try the Original Dark to confirm that, I suppose...","thehyperduck","Dec 29, 2013"

As it approaches the finish the smoke flavor really takes over and dominates the aftertaste while it manages to leave the finish pretty clean. The sweetness of the malt is set off nicely by the smoke and coffee flavors. This is hands down my favorite offering from Sleeman, but I also have an affinity for porters.

There is a slight roasted malt taste, mostly in the aftertaste, and a bit of hops in the middle, but really just a little bit. Caramel flavor becomes more apparent as the beer warms.

1.81,-40.8,3,2,1.5,1.5,2,"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Where to start, there a just so many flaws with this beer. I brewed a kit porter from Brewer's Best-I think it was my first homebrew-and it was better than this. The feel of Sleeman's ' 68 Porter is mostly like that of tonic water. Real thin body, much thinner than one would expect for a porter. In my opinion the carbonation levels are too high as well for the porter style, however since the body of this beer is so-damnably light higher carbonation actually does it justice. However, since porters are supposed to be lighter in carbonation and heavier of body this is off. This is a beer I'll not be buying again, ever. It completely sucks.","becktone","Mar 05, 2007"

Tastes of light chocolate, with a sweet hint of malt. However, it quickly finishes to a chalky, burnt grain taste. Hard to distinguish any hops whatsoever. Halfway through the session, there was a real alchohol bite to it. Fairly difficult to finish the bottle, I lost interest with its lack of overall flavor.","sauron681","Jan 25, 2007"

Nose is also slightly metallic, but with no overt hop aroma to speak of . . . Tangy and bittersweet, with roasted and dark malts. Bitter! Wow, there's more hop bitterness in this than I am accustomed to as per the style, sharp, and some might find it a bit harsh. Finish is dry, with some biscuity malt lingering and more of that insistant hop. Carbonation is moderate and body is on the thin side. With the bitterness as prominent as it is it lacks a bit in sessionability, but I can see knocking two of these back with no problem. Not bad overall, although the bitterness is a little bit overbalanced and overshadows the rather pleasant malt qualities. Still, it's from an older recipe and an older era, and I give Sleeman credit for this brave rendition - hope they maintain these recipes!","Chaz","Dec 23, 2006"

As I poured it I couldnt help but think it looks a bit thin for a porter, nice 2 inch beige head on it though, kinda a deep brown on the beer itself, personally i prefer porters darker. Smell is a bit better, hints of vanilla and roast malts. Taste is like watered down porter, really thin, hints of chocolate and roast malts in the taste, but nothing too strong. Mouthfeel is mediocre, its like water basically, nothing special about it, just thin.

The flavors are quite separate and don't meld well. The caramel flavor seems a bit artificial.

3.48,13.7,4,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a dark, almost opaque brown, with a tan head and deep ruby highlights. Aroma of roasted malts, coffee/chocolate, some toffee flavour, not bad. Taste was decent. This isn't bad for a Sleeman product. It's a beer that has exceeded my rather low expectations, but overall, it's pretty drinkable. Although way too sweet, it does have characteristics of a decent porter. Roasted flavours, chewy malt, slight bitterness to balance. Mouthfeel a bit thin, but drinkability is good.","baiser","Jan 27, 2005"
1.93,-36.9,2,1.5,2.5,1.5,1.5,"I'm reviewing this beer cold. I mean cold as a Bud served at a biker bar cold. As this beer warms, it gets worse. This porter pours a muddy black colour, with a bit of coffee coloured foam that quickly disipates. Their is one ring of lace at the top of the glass, where the top of the foam reached its peak. That is all. First smell is skunk. Not surprised. The glass is clear, and this bottle came from Canada to Africa. But I had the rest, and they were all the same. And, considering some of the disappointments I've had with Sleeman before, I'm considering it safe to assume that this would smell and taste the same if I bought it at the LCBO and drank it straight away. After awhile, I smell a bit of caramel barley and chocolate. Taste is skunky. But, it also has a caramel and chocolate flavour that reminds me a bit of a chocolate bar. Too sweet, but the skunkiness balances it out. Surprising, eh? Skunk actually balancing something. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and almost oily like a fish. It's pretty undrinkable, I find. Something I won't partake of again.","slitherySOB","Jan 14, 2005"
3.38,10.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark opaque brown poured from the traditional clear Sleeman's bottle. Full head, some tiny bubbles from continued carbonation, left a hint of lace. Dark, roasted malt aroma, plus smell of brown sugar and some nuttiness. Taste is of dark roasted malt, some coffee and cocoa, and slight hop finish. Medium bodied, yet thin and almost watery, but still a nice effort from Sleeman's. Good flavors and very drinkable. Not sure how it would stack up against other brews in this style.","BigBry","Jan 13, 2005"

3.47,13.4,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"Pours out fairly thin in body, but has an pleasant mahogany appearance with amber highlights. A small tan head on the pour, settles quickly to a wafer-thin cap, scant traces of lacing. The aroma is a winner for a Sleeman product, a fair amount of character. Toasted and chocolate malts, some toffee, with notes of licorice and roasted coffee. Although the flavour contains similar elements, there is no real backbone to it until the finish and the lingering aftertaste. Starts out weak and watery, picking up momentum for an aftertaste of chewy roasted malt, hints of espresso and chocolate. Curious that it tastes better after it's already been swallowed, no real action in the mouth. Aside from being fairly light and watery, even this porter suffers from the classic Sleeman carbonation issue, a little caustic on the palate. By far the best thing I've tasted from Sleeman to date, they are heading in a decent direction here, but still have a ways to go to put together a well-rounded offering.","IronDjinn","Dec 14, 2004"
3.7,20.9,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"A classy-looking 6-pack box, with the John Sleeman signature, date, alcohol content, ingredients and even tasting notes printed on a label which covers the opening of the box. Twist-off red cap with ""2004 limited edition"" on it. Clear bottle, keeping with Sleeman tradition. It poured decently enough, with a very large-bubble head, but one which formed a solid creamy covering over the beer. Deep rich rosewood and amber hues. Very nice looking beer. The lacing is cream coloured and could use some viscosity--this beer does not seem to leave much lace. The aroma is sweet, lactosed malt, with some definite spiciness and black licorice. Green, young grains, well-roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, cinnamon, and some raisins or plums. I was not expecting such a good aroma. The taste delivers on the aroma. Full up chocolate raisins at the front, dark coffee grains on the middle, and strong toasted flavours lingering in the finish. Extremely sedimentary aftertaste: you can feel the grains in this one, like barely-filtered coffee. Some cream, definite coffee, mollasses, some alcohol, and just enough hop balance. Strong bread notes in the long-finish. Porter being the mark, this is hitting it. Carbonation is decent, but a little more bite would be even better. This is a very consumeable porter, delivering on all the flavours I expected. I must admit, in a Sleeman desert, this is an oasis of the brewery. The first Sleeman beer I have bought in probably three years or more, but this is one I could enjoy quite regularly.","Cwrw","Dec 14, 2004"

3.53,15.4,3.5,3,3.5,4,4,"I like the classy packaging and the fact this is a limited release. This is nowhere as good as Tree's Spy Porter but I consider this to be the best beer from Sleeman and a good pint. Pours Opaque black with an okay head. The nose is average but the taste is quite nice. Burnt malts and a sweetish finish make this very drinkable. Not a sipper but rather a session porter, this is a step in the right direction for these guys.","canucklehead","Dec 01, 2004"

3.63,18.6,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Overall a flavorful mild porter with a couple of sharp edges. A good attempt at a mega porter, a sure step up for Sleeman. I'm impressed...I'll buy some more...I want to see what some age will do for the few sharp edges and the under lying charred grain tastes in the new brew. These are all that keep this from being a smooth mild tasty porter. Maybe that signature Sleeman dextrin taste will disappear as well.","pootz","Oct 30, 2004"
