"2/19/15"
"Decent amount of flavor, slightly light on the mouthfeel."
""
"0 - This is a great beer. The grainy, bitter dark chocolate is what makes it all come together for me. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O:  Glad I got to try this British staple.  A fine porter that drinks like a stout.  But then, there's not that much difference between the two.  Tasty.  Let it warm for maximum viscosity and thermal breakdown."
""
""
""
"Dark roasted malt, coffee, and dark chocolate flavors with a nice hop balancing act. Sublime mouthfeel. Fantastic brew. Cheers!"
""
"O: Maybe I was expecting too much, but I really don't see what the big deal is. It's good, but I think it benefits greatly from people reading ""viscous, chocolatey"" on the bottle and then finding/inventing those characteristics. The ""roasty", however, is there in spaded."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A must have for dark beer lovers."
""
""
""
"Very tasty, if you're into stouts.  Malty chocolaty notes. Very clean tasting IMHO.  Not as string tasting as Narwhal or Wake up Dead nitro.  Very well made RIPS."
""
""
""
"O- Very surprised that the flavor doesn't follow through with what the aroma lets on.  A very good porter but it's missing the flavor and mouthfeel to make it great."
""
""
""
""
"Fantastic porter, says this imperial stout aficionado."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: well I am very glad that I have decided to retry this beer. A full-bodied and full-flavoured English Porter that shows fantastic roasted dark coffee and sweet milk chocolate. Well worth the having at AU$5 a bottle."
""
""
"Overall: This is my first encounter with the output of the Harviestoun Brewery and it won't be my last. I don't care whether people classify this is a 'black ale' or a porter - categorising it won't detract from the fact that it's across the board awesome; lovely balance of flavours. Definitely a keeper."
""
""
""
"This beer is so underrated. Not sure what more you could ask for. It could be a little cleaner, but that's part of its charm."
""
""
""
""
"A decent beer and apparently rare in my area, but hardly worth the $4.29 I paid for the 11.2 ounce bottle."
"Pours dark and has an almost oily look to it - maybe it's just in my head. Nicely balanced beer with malt and coffee."
""
""
"I would definately buy this again."
""
""
""

"If viewed as a robust porter, this is an excellent example of the style.  It's roasty bitterness is at first abrasive, but it's exactly the way it should be."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottle. Dark and lovely. Nice chocolate aroma. Lightly roasted, sweet flavour. Nice long lasting bitter aftertaste."
""
""
""
"The silkiest of mouth feels, this is just bloody awesome. I'm glad I picked up a few bottles, both with the labels upside down and right side up."
"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, toast, light toffee, light dark fruit, faint smoke, and roast/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bit roast/bready malt and light-moderate yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, toast, light toffee, light dark fruit, light smoke, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, toast, light smoke, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of roast/bready malt and light yeast ester flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent English porter. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of roast/bready malts and light yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."
""
""
""
"Overall:  great stout/porter.  Would definitely buy again."
""
""
""
""
"Dark brown in color with ruby edges.  Some roast in the nose along with a trace of alcohol. The body is hearty and creamy. The roast profile is relatively mild but pleasantly present and the flavor includes a very slight kiss of sweetness underneath the roast."
""
""
""
"Had this on draft in an English Pub ( Craft) Great blend of roasted malt , some sweetness and a nice finish of bitterness. Very mellow. The aroma had a hint of coffee."

"Great porter. Very drinkable but not lacking on the flavor. More of a classic british taste."

"O: definitely a great beer. Glad I picked this one up to try it."

"I love this beer. Pours black as night with a thin coffee colored head. The smell is full of sweet malt and toasty aromas. The taste is full of toast, coffee, and dark chocolate flavors. Very delicious. Although it is worth mentioning that for such a heavy beer I thought the flavors were well balanced and it had a nice clean finish. I love the aftertaste as well which is good because it is a nice velvety consistency that coats your mouth and throat. Would absolutely recommend."
"Pours opaque brown-black beer with decent tan 2-finger head, prone to long retention. Robust coffee smell and taste with dark chocolate sourness in the finish. Viscous, with moderate carbonation. Smooth and well-balanced. Strongly recommended."

"a classic from a brewery yet to really wow me, this one is a game changer. a mix of so many styles, from dry stout to scottish ale to black ale and beyond, a lot of bases are covered here, a lot of lines crossed, but comfort instead of chaos results. this is a velvety smooth jet black shiny brew that foams up about in inch and a half on the pour and stays vigorous. caramel in head color, rich in aroma. notes of milk chocolate and light roast coffee cascade into a more earthy profile, but maintaining just enough sweetness to not let it get bitter, a great success. the flavor is a lot like the nose, with heaps of dark malt all the way through, but the brewers have somehow coaxed new flavor combinations out of familiar malts. its rich and chocolaty in a new way. its layered, and there is a hint of licorice right before the finish. pillow soft and silky in texture, yet extremely full bodied. carbonation is no more or less than a square medium, and its perfectly dialed for whats going on here. dynamic and nuanced stuff, different in flavor and feel from anything else in the genre, it may in fact be its own genre. i will be buying this one again, i like it far better than its barrel aged variants that ive had. it needs nothing."

"The beer is black with a quarter inch of off-white cap that holds steady for several minutes. The aroma brings milk chocolates, roast, malts, biscuits, brown bread. The flavor is sweet and chocolaty, followed by mild roast and sweet breads. A bit lacking actually. Not bad at all, but the flavor kind of drops off. Thin body and a bit too sweet. Eh..."
"O - This is a strong, assertive beer, whose assertiveness is based only on malt characteristics. That makes it a welcome change from today's typical hop madness. Still, I find it to verge on too acrid form my taste and I prefer some of the variants that have been aged in various barrels to mellow it and add some other complexities."
""

"This porter pours a very near black mahogany that only lets light in around the edges. The head is small, tan, and very short lived with some lacing. The aroma is chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. It is dark and roasty with notes of cocoa nibs, coffee, some fruity esters, and lots of malt. The mouthfeel is just what is promised...oily. This would probably be more drinkable if it had just a touch more carbonation to add a little smooth creaminess. The flavor is once again lots of chocolate as well as some dried fruits, European yeast, a little butter coffee on the tail, and a lot of malty sweetness. I do prefer my porters on the drier side but for a sweet one, this is quite good."

"O: A great porter - I could drink this all day. Too bad it would be an expensive six-pack...still, as a single bottle with dinner, it can't be beat."
""
""
""

"Bottle poured into a tulip glass. A real looker, a very dark black brew with a ruby red halo at the bottom of the glass and a supple, sumptuous latte tan colored head that looks rather like sponge toffee. Aroma is dark roast coffee and bitter chocolate, with a faint fruitiness that recalls sour cherries along with a little burnt toffee or perhaps maple sugar. Palate is much the same, creamed coffee, unsweetened baker's chocolate, a whiff of sour cherry, and earthy, near-piney hops that add a unique additional element to the more expected roasted elements. The uber-dark appearance and protruding smooth mouthfeel belie the rather thin body and relatively easy drinkability for such an opaque brew. Coffee flavor outweighs the chocolate and other components and alas, the finish is a tad husky and astringent to my palate. Skews toward the dry and roasted rather than the sweeter regions of dark beer territory, probably due to a lack of crystal malts. Still, worth sampling for the porter/stout aficionado."
"O: Great Smell, good taste, great name and label. Intense on the nose, a little lacking in taste in comparison. Still a must try."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is fantastic. It's richness really belies its ABV. Hell, I'd even consider it a benchmark for the English porter (or even the American porter, for that matter). Shame it's kind of pricey and not offered in 6 packs..."
""
""
""
"This was tasty and well crafted, perfectly balanced, wouldn't give it a pass."
""
""
""
"Yes, Old Engine Oil does it for me. A classic that needs recognition for what it is."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - excellent session beer and a showy one as well. Thanks Dan!"
""
""
"O – Quality needs no apologies. Difference between a pretty good beer and a really good - bordering on great - beer is abundantly clear here (OEO vs Pipeline). The first 330ml went down all too swiftly. Moreish on kettle chip levels. Wonderful."

"Overall: I loved this beer. It isn't trying to be anything other than an outstanding porter, which it is. This is easily a beer I could drink more than one time in a sitting and not feel guilty about. Some may say it lacks complexity but I believe, at least in this case, that simple is perfect."
""
""
"o: A fine and slightly different tasting porter. The coffee and chocolate notes are relatively mild as is the smoky finish. Easy drinking but still substantial. If this was half the price it is I'd definitely favor it over many other porters."
"MF – Thin, but smooth, even creamy. Medium-light bodied. Dry finish. 4.5"
""
""
"This classic Scottish brew has a good complexity. It is a must to try this and its “reserva"" version, the Ola Dubh. As for other brews from Harviestoun, I found the bottle version more robust than the tap version."

"Color is a lovely mahogany, head is a nice brown foam, good carbonation, strong bitterness prevails for me. Smell is definitely of hops, which I'm not a big fan of. Occasionally, I return to the style to see if my taste buds have changed, but alas, they have not."

"O- Cant believe it took me so long to get around to this beer. One of, if not the best English porter around."

"When you see a cask o' this at your local spot, you pounce, I figger. This stuff pours a deep black-brown topped by a finger of dusty khaki foam. The nose comprises coffee, dark chocolate, and darkly-roasted malts. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a Guinness-like (or acrid coffee-like) sourness swaying from the background to the fore, but never firmly taking hold. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light carbonation (livelier than most casks lately) and a smooth, easy-going feel. Overall, a very nice English porter, something I could easily see being drained from its current prison and down into my gullet."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my favourite non imperial stout/porter very flavorful."
""
""
""
"Overall a nice porter. Expensive for the 12oz bottle but no regrets."
"O: A crazy delicious English Porter. Absolutely worth seeking out."

"I really expected a brew with the appearance and consistency of well, old engine oil. Instead I got a mediocre black ale. I can name 5 beers that are thicker, cheaper, and more robust. Good but there are better for cheaper."
"Overall- save this for dessert, not the main course. It's filling and all worth it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks and dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, vanilla, cocoa powder, and milk chocolate. Taste is much the same with a char-like flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell but the flavor doesn't quite match up in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall, It wasn't bad. Definitely not a high class old ale though."
""
""
"O - A great tasting and well balanced ale."
""
""
"O. Very refreshing. A bit of a cough syrup taste, but not in a bad way."
""
""
""
"Overall, a very good beer. Would love to have this one again!"
""
""
""
""
"I didn't know until after I had it on tap but when I saw it for sale in a six pack it was 30 bucks, so if you see it on tap be sure to try it out."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Bottom Line: top notch porter!"
""
""
""
""

"This beer pours as black as the absence of light. There is a one finger medium brown head with only a small amount of retention and delicate spider-web like lacing left behind. The smell is powerful, mostly roasted malt and chocolate. The taste follows the nose. I get a big roasted maltiness upfront with some bitter nuttiness, followed by a mellow chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is thick and pleasant. Excellent offering."
"Old Engine Oil pours entirely black, with roughly a half finger of mocha foam crowning it. There's a little bit of head retention, but not much in the way of lacing. The nose is roasty, with the aroma definitely leaning more towards the coffee side of things. The flavor displays a malt character that heavily features roasted grains. It's still balanced towards coffee, but there is a little bit of dark chocolate present as well. A light bitterness transitions into a soft, earthy finish. The body has just a little bit of chewiness to it, and the carbonation is nice and muted. Old Engine Oil is a very solid lower ABV stout. It's straightforward and just very well executed."
""
""
"I had the pleasure of sampling this fine brew last weekend. I was in the mood for a good porter and the pub I was at had it on tap. It was served to me in a brandy type glass. It poured black and had chocolate colored head. Upon tasting it the first thing I noticed was a rich coffee/chocolate flavor. Secondly I was hit with a slight taste of sparkling wine. It had the dry sweetness of it, but none of the fizziness typically associated with that sort of beverage. This may be unique to the draught version of this particular beer. It was described to have been fermented in used wine casks. All in all a very pleasurable beer to drink, and i would not hesitate to try again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall much like I remember it, but the flavors and feel are toned down a bit. Much better on tap, but you can't complain about this either way."
""
""
"O: this is a pretty good beer for its style and one that I would come back to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"A pretty good dark beer. I don't know what you'd truly label it as as the brewer's web site has it as a 'dark ale', some bottles apparently as 'porter', and my bottle as a 'black ale'. Well, whatever, it is tasty, nicely balanced, rich and flavorful, and should be an enjoyable brew for any dark ale lover."
""
""
""
"O - Great. Could barely be better."
""
"O - A really good example of this style. I could drink a bunch of these. It seems that these beers have different lables (black ale on mine), but tasty all the same. Very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Looks wonderful, deep, dark, almost ebony in colour, one of the blackest porters I’ve come across. The rich, creamy, tan coloured head sat proudly on top. Mocha, dark chocolate and ground coffee esters sweep across the nose, no harshness or bitterness, this is one smooth brew. The taste follows the aromas, a slight hop bitterness infuses with the other flavours mentioned in the smell to give this beer a balanced and rich texture of an alcoholic creamy chocolate cake. One small bottle is enough though, too much weight in the body to have another. Just a little too rich for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - a very robust, warming and hearty porter come stout. Probably my favorite tipple from the many sampled around Scotland, it really is a treat best drank, imo, on cold winter evenings and christmas. Top notch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Great beer. Would totally drink it again. It's definitely the kind of beer that many porter drinkers have to try."
""
""
""
""
"Mouthfeel is definitely a medium/full body feel. I was honestly expecting it to be thicker, but the fact that it isn't does not detract from it at all. If a porter can be refreshing, this is it. Perfect for a fall day, I will have to pick more up when the breeze gets a little nippier."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This is OK, but didn't quite impress me as much as I had expected. I would drink another if it was offered. I suspect that a nitro tap would improve this significantly."
"Poured from bottle into pint glass. Pours black with slight tan head. Smells of roasted coffe malts and slight hops. Taste is of roasted coffee malts. Slightly hoppy or bitter but nice. Its thin, but nice flavors. All around, great brew, but could be a bit thicker for a porter...this was more like a black ale."
""
""
"The definition of a true english porter. Ink black, solid caramel head. The snow has certainly earthy and coffee aroma. The taste is a solid chocolate and nutty flavor. It has a nice long true finish that makes you enjoy this all the more. Easily one of the best of its style."
""
""
""
""
"A deep dark mahogany on the pour with a rich medium lasting brown head. Good lacing and head retention. Aroma of dark roasted malt, cacao beans, some espresso. Taste has a good roasted chocolate flavor, with nice espresso notes with sweet roasted malts. A slightly creamy texture on the palate with good carbonation. Finish is a combination of sweet roasted dark caramel malts, some good flavorful chocolate notes, espresso, some dark chocolate bitterness. The ending has a lingering sweet bitter cacao espresso flavor. Overall a very good, tasty, delicious brew. I would drink this again, Very nice indeed."
""
""
""
"Seriously, this beer doesn't disappoint. Color is a dark black until held to the light where the ruby comes out. Smell is rich and deep with chocolate and coffee hints and toasty. The taste follows the smell well, with the addition of some fruitiness and even a little citrusy. Malt bitterness is there, but not overpowering, nor is the sweetness. Creamy and smooth. This beer is great, worth buying and then buying again."
"S solid simple Porter."
""
"Overall I pretty fantastic beer with depth of flavor and pleasing to gaze upon."
""
""
""
"O: I found this beer to be very enjoyable and very easy to drink - probably a little too strong to be sessionable but certainly one you might like to have another of... Interesting because it seems to straddle stout and porter from a style perspective."
""
""
""
""
"Deep black in color. Poured with a short beige foam that quickly reduced to a spotty cap that left random trails of sticky lacings on the glass. Mellow dark chocolate aromas hit first with earthy roasted malt beneath and hints of sweet dark fruit. Oily, thick feel with rich, tight carbonation. Sweet dark chocolate flavor up front with dark roasted malt in tow. Bitter hoppiness in the middle that ushers in charred malt, dark fruit and dark roasted coffee flavors to the end. Finishes semi-dry with lingering burnt malt and hop bitterness."
"O - mild creaminess, great balance, a bit of olive wood, gentle porter and very smooth. Definitely one worth trying, well executed. 4.25"
""
""
""
"Overall. I wasn't a big fan of this one. Some bitter flavours, especially in the finish that I did not enjoy."
"O: An easy drinker that could use a better smell and mouth feel."
""
"notes. Intense flavours with a bittersweet finish."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Found this in Winnipeg and I wish we had it in BC. I have had the barrel aged version but this is a true classic porter with tons of flavour, mouthfeel and complexity. The beer is thick and dark like the name but is never overbearing to the palate. This is a more like a US version of the beer with its big notes and use of hops."

"Bought a bottle of this from Tanakaya in Mejiro, Tokyo. Poured into a Baird pint glass. A viscous black porter with a bit of a chocolate head at first that subsides to a watery dribbling down the glass later, leaving no tracing inside. The taste can either be described as subdued and refined or as a bit lacking in excitement, depending on what you're going for. The smell is wonderfully reminiscent of roasted coffee and bitter chocolate, and the aftertaste works to keep those flavors on your palate. The smell is also a bit alcoholic, and I enjoy that especially coming off of only 6%. This is my first Harviestoun, and I have to say I like it. I will be checking out their other brews as I come across them."
"A great name for a beer, but I have to say I prefer Fuller's porter over this one. A little more bitterness and not as thick of a feel as the name would have you believe."
"Overall: a very good beer. I feel like it could be made truly great with a little bit creamier mouthfeel."
"Poured this one close to room temp, The liquid looks brown coming out the bottle but finishes black in the glass. A nice two fingaz of dark shaded tan foam that clung to the glass on the way down. Smell is what you would expect, roast on top of some chocolate and malt scent. Some coffee in the back as well. Going in, this beer is some smooth stuff. It tastes delicious with a nice medley of the above mentioned scents going into the taste. The true gem of this beer though is the body. It is so silky smooth and goes down easy as pie. I have never drank a stout this quick but it was all to easy. No intrusion by nothing. The feel alone boosts up the drinkability and taste of this beer. The carb is there but does not make a dent through the body. Reminds me of a lighter chocolate milk. I could drink this till the cows came home, and Im not a stout guy."
"This is a great beer no doubt. With a good blend of complimenting flavors and a perfect mouthfeel it is perfectly drinkable. Creamy roasty it almost reminds me of a stout but not quite as heavy on the mouthfeel. A must try."

"Old Engine Oil from a cask poured out the same jet black color but of course with a severely impaired head (as did all of the cask offerings) and only minimal lacing. The main aroma/taste difference this brew had in cask format is a much heavier emphasis on stone fruits over the roasted malts. It was like cherries and prunes in a cup of mocha coffee on the nose! The flavor had some lighter emphasis on the stone fruits than the nose did, but it was still noticeably present on the palate. Transitions from semi-sweet to dry throughout each sip. Body is still on the thicker side of medium heft yet carbonated enough to avoid syrupy-ness."
""
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours black with a large, creamy tan head that dissipates slowly. The head retains very well. No light can be seen passing through this beer. There are smells of dark roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate. It smells a little sweet. The aroma is very inviting. The taste is just like it smells. There are flavors of dark roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. There's a mild sweetness from the malt to accompany the bitter hops. This is wonderfully balanced and delicious. The body is medium with not a lot of carbonation. It's creamy with high drinkability. This is very easy to gulp. Overall, this is a fantastic, flavorful porter."
""
"D: Maintains great drinkability despite big flavors and great mouthfeel."
""
"330ml bottle. Tumbler glass. Enjoyed on dec´11. Black in color. Beige, small bubbled, froth. Creamy, lasting head with copious collars. Roasted malts & slightly chocolate to the nose. Dry bitter upfront with roasted black coffee. Toasted malts follow providing a plentiful sensation on to the palate. Full flavor, medium body. Hoppy finish & aftertaste with hues of wood."
""

"Robust malt profile"
""
"You really can't argue with this beer if you like dark beers. It's got great head, lacing, taste, mouthfeel, etc. It's not over-the-top in any aspect which makes it that good - it doesn't have to make a statement to be a great beer. This is that beer - tres solid for its type - a black ale. Pour it in your oil chamber and enjoy!"

"Had this at BBC in Franklin, MA. It pours very dark, almost black. The head was creamy tan but small and dissipated rather quickly. There is some light lacing as well. Smell is of malt, chocolate, and maybe hops. The hops definitely come through on the taste, it's somewhat bitter with a hint of chocolate and malt. Smokey like a Porter usually is which is why I'm a Stout fan. The mouthfeel is pretty good but not the best. Drinkability: I'd take it if I had it, but I'm not sad that I don't. Definitely not bad, but at the same time it's nothing special."
"O - Very very well balanced beer. Perfect and fitting flavors for the style. Like it a lot."

"Dark and milk chocolate in the taste. Roasty. Slight asphalt. Finishes dry with a moderate, farily long bitterness. A very slight warmth in the finish from the 6% ABV. Straightforward and elegant, classic porter flavors. Smooth and a little slick in the mouth - easy to drink for sure but a bit more of the promised viscosity would be nice. Still, lovely. The store I bought this from has tons of UK beers on it's shelves that I am not especially interested in, but I'll always have time for this. Wonderful match with a salad of seared scallops, blue cheese, endive and hazelnuts, perhaps surprisingly. I'm likely to have another with dessert."

"O: An impeccably balanced porter. Simple and knows what it wants to do and does it damn well."
""
"Overall: This was my first porter, and I'm not even the biggest stout fan. However, Old Engine Oil is amazing. It's just so complex and creamy-smooth and luxuriously textured. Even the smell is incredible. I would highly recommend it. I see in some reviews that this is quite expensive in the US, but in my opinion it's worth a little extra for any fan of the style, or anyone interested in exploring it. Fantastic beer."

"Pours dark black with a decent head. Solid lacing. Rich and roasty aroma of some roasted malt, chocolate, cocoa, dark fruit. Wonderful taste to this, some roastiness, some bitter chocolate and milk chocolate, a little espresso, some dark fruits.s. Medium bodied, not much carbonation. Definitely the best porter I have had to date, this beer is really really good. Just wish it was more affordable."

"O - Very nice English porter. A bit pricy, but I would still pick this up occasionally."

"M - Not what I expected but for a 6% English Porter, the mouth feel is excellent. Medium to full body with a slight viscosity. Light carbonation."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It leaves the mouth dry, almost like licking iron. The warmer this gets, the better it gets. A real sipper here."
""
"Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is rich and creamy but is also nearly gulpable. The body coats your mouth well and is not sticky in the least. The carbonation is slightly fizzy but does not seem to detract from the flavors or the experience."

"Price Point - $4.59/single bottle"
"O: A nice ale. Good overall flavor, but I am not super impressed with this beer either. My favorite part about this beer is how the elements of sweet and bittered chocolate come together. At the price I paid for this beer, I will probably not buy it again, but I would not turn this beer down if offered."
""
""
"O- a very good example of a porter. Those who like that sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like."
""
""
""
"CONCLUSION: The label is smoke and mirrors; this is a tame, straightforward porter. Everything about this is entirely normal and civilized. Change the label and I'd give it higher ratings. It's a good drink, but why pay a premium for basic porter from Europe when you can support a local, craft brewery making the same thing? Lots to chose from domestically. Pass on this one."

"dark brown with a large creamy tan colored head on the top. Great retention let it hang around for what seemed like forever before finally being nestled down into just a thin layer across the top. The aroma was very full and sweet. Lots of chocolate roaming through it along with a touch of coffee and lots of sugar. A slight smoked presentation as well. The flavor was also very full for a porter. This almost had a stout like feel to it as it was very thick and full with a great robust profile. Lots of chocolate and coffee notes dominated it"

"O- Very good simple classic porter."

"O - Just a cracking porter. Have one after dinner tonight."

"Overall - Good beer, well balanced, recommend it!"

"This is a top class porter; dark and smoky and not overly concentrated."
"O: Very impressive. I don't really like porters but this is excellent."

"O-A very good porter. It really delivers on the roast flavor I want in a porter. Not quite as complex as American Porters but is everything you look for in a traditional example of a porter. I will definitely have this again."
"O: A good english style porter. Great for drinking when you just want a porter, nothing crazy."
"Overall a good beer and nice example of the style."
"D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. A neat little beer that ends up delivering on things I wasn't really looking for, but are welcome nonetheless. I was expecting a little bit more heartier given the name and description, but I can't say I was entirely disappointed by what I did get."
"Food match: Savour this with some dark chocolate or indeed it would suit a well made stew/beef steak pie. Hard cheese if that's your thing (personally cheese and beer have never mixed well with me). Also a shepherds pie would be ace."
"o - this is an incredible beer. highly recommend"
"O: Overall very good, a great example of a porter."
"o - the platonic modern porter. maybe not *quite* as interesting as Alice Porter but it sets out to be a perfect porter and it achieves that and then some."
"The appearance is like, well, old engine oil - pitch black with a dark tan head. Nice lacing on the glass. The smell is strongly cocoa and a bit of dark fruit. The taste is much the same - cocoa up front, dark fruits in the back, with a roasty flavor as well. Mouthfeel is wonderfully viscous. The description on the label says it's viscous, chocolaty, and roasty. This beer delivers on all three."
"Pours a dark as night black hue which leaves a one finger khaki head and sporadic clingy lacing,the smell is milk chocolate with fruit and nut,milky mocha and sweet malts,the mouthfeel is light-medium bodied and has tastes of dark cocoa,milky bittersweet mocha,a touch of fruit cake,sweet dark malts and finished with a mix of dark belgian chocolate and herbal fruit punch and overall i like this drop and prefer it then most of the oak aged versions cheers."
"This beer i will remember for its dark apperance and smooth taste. If I would have been drinking this in another occasion i would have been drinking it to some heavy roastet beef."
"mouthfeel - creamy and good. when it warms it gets a bit too thin. carbonation is spot on. terrific."
"Pours a solid black color with a creamy khaki head that shows moderate retention. Smells of caramel, coffee, roasted grains, slightly fruity with a hint of mineral water. Taste is roasty and chocolaty with hints of coffee and earthy hops. Creamy velvety smooth mouthfeel, light level of carbonation with a medium body. Great dare I say sessionable porter."
"O - My first Harviestoun beer and it won't be my last. Higly recommended."
"Overall, this is an excellent porter. Full of character, and reasonably easy to drink. Delicious."
"Good example of style."
"Overall,score takes a -1 for the price/cost factor."
"If you like Porters, you must try this one."
"Overall, enjoyable. Nothing amazing but a good beer."
"O - A very big porter. Worth a try."
"D - One of the better beers I've tried to date. Really complex flavor profile and near-perfect mouthfeel with this porter. I do detect something slightly off-putting, almost skunky in the flavor still, but it doesn't stop me from enjoying this one thoroughly."
"Overall Impression- As the bartender says ""This is one of our best dark ales", and I can see why! Perfect in almost every way but could use a bit more caramel/coffee characters. Of course an English Porter is usually lighter and has more dull attributes, but this would have made this an A+ instead of an A. Had never seen this brew before and am glad I got the chance to try!"
"Final Notes: This is a damn good beer. Big flavor and complex, deliciously sweet and savory. Excellent dessert beer or to finish the night out with. Highly recommended!"
"This is not an ale for the weak-stomached or weak-minded, and while that makes it exotic and extraordinary, it also marks a weakness, for it takes a special tongue to appreciate this kind of flavor. Try at your own risk, but *do* try--it's an experience you won't soon forget."
"Overall: Great porter and one I will recommend and have again."
"Over all this just went to my top 15 beers I would say. I am really impressed. I wouldn't drink several in a night but I would relax with one just about any night. This is a great beer."
"Not as complex as I would have liked. Not the best I have had of this style, but far from the worst. Who knows how old it was and if that played a factor."
"O - Highly pleasurable experience with great drinkability. Perfect beer to accompany meals."
"Picked this up at the biggest beer store in the UK, Beers of Europe Ltd. Dark brown-black pour with half finger head that fades quickly to a film with decent lacing. Very earthy, roasty, smokey nose with hints of coffee, cocoa, and a touch of licorice. The taste is dominated by roasty, smokey, burnt coffee and bitter chocolate. A spicy, herbal, bitter hop bite emerges as it warms along with a nice sweet malt finish. I'm typically not a big porter fan as they seem a bit thin to me, but this was slightly syrupy and thick and really smooth without being too sweet. And I never find myself wanting a second porter, but again, this was really tasty and had me wanting another. Very pleasant surprise!"
" Note: Added some Talisker 10 yo Single Malt Scotch in it later because this one seemed like a good candidate for fooling around. The aroma of this pseudo-aged beer became incredibly good, but the contributions to the taste were minimal. While the aroma was full of everything delicate about Talisker, the taste inherited a touch of peat smoke at the end."
"Overall: Solid porter I would get this beer again if I found another bottle of it. Just a bit dissapointed with mouthfeel on this beer, I wanted to see a fuller bodied porter than I got."
"Overall, what a nice beer. I got a single of this at a Giant Eagle of all places. What a nice little find. I will try to see if I can get more of these."
"O: I really enjoyed this beer. I love porters and this one is simple and delicious with all the clean roasted flavors."
"O- overall a very nice brew, I'd have this one again and I would especially be interested in trying some of the other versions."
"Overall: Amazing beer. No frills added but it gets all of the flavors it possibly can out of the ingredients. 6% abv is (relatively) low which is nice in this culture of huge alcohol beers. I wish this was more accessible but I will certainly be picking more of this up! Every aspect of this beer works together in perfect harmony. I have not been this impressed with a porter in a while. My new favorite for the style. One of my favorite experiences is picking up a random (and unhyped) beer at the store on a whim and having it be this good!"
"Pours near black with a single-finger off-white head. Retention is okay, and there's a good amount of spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. The nose carries some light chocolate plus some roast. More of the roast than anything else. A bit of coffee as it warms. The flavor is roasted malt with a touch of coffee and some slight milk chocolate notes. Medium body with low carbonation. Fairly creamy and lends a toffee-like feel. Nothing crazy, but a pretty good brew."
"O: I've heard this a gold standard of English Porters and I can understand why. A smooth and balanced porter with lots of depth and a hoppy finish I actually like!"
"I didn't notice the alcohol kick that a 6% brew should have; it's debatable whether or not that is a good thing..."
"This beer pours out much thicker looking than most porters out there. Even looks thicker than some stouts. The color is black, with a fan colored head that doesn't stick around much. The smell is earthy and roasted. The taste is rich with heavy roasted malts. The mouthfeel is pretty thick and had a oily feel to it. Overall pretty good brew."
"Overall: This is a great porter, or old ale, or black ale, or whatever. Looking forward to trying the Ola Dubh 16 in my cellar."
"The mouthfeel is an absolute highlight of an already great brew. It's full-bodied, creamy, with just enough carbonation to keep it from being a slog to get through. The drinkability is exceptional. Overall, a superlative porter that stands at the front of it's class. Highly recommended."
"This beer pours a medium bodied dark mahogany in colored that comes together to appear almost black. It features a nice beige lacing around the edges of my snifter. It smells of lightly roasted coffee with a nice bitter chocolate finish. It tastes of rich coffee and overly bitter chocolate. The chocolate aspect is almost too bitter. It does leave a nice after taste behind though. It drinks a lot thicker than it looked while pouring. It coats the palate. Overall this is a solid brew. I just wish it weren't as bitter as it was but it's still a solid porter."
"This was my first time trying this beer, but it will not be my last. An outstanding beer!"
"Overall an amazing porter that relies heavily in its balance between sweetness and bitterness (it starts out sweeter and turns bitter as you drink it). The main flaw IMO is that the aromatic hops shine a little bit too much in the aftertaste instead of the malts. Also, as mentioned above, the aroma needs a little kick."
"This has got to be, hands down, one of the finest porters available. A 'must-try' for ever porter lover. Highly recommended."
"Overall - Very good for the beer style, and a perplexing tasting."
"looks like the label has changed, it now says ""Black Ale"" instead of ""Porter"". no matter the style, it's a good beer."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium. This is a really good porter with lots of flavor a very easy beer to drink. I am glad I got to drink it."
"Though I probably wouldn't drink this as a session beer, or accompanying a meal, I think this would make a great desert beer."
"A little pricy for everyday drinking, but well worth the try. I got it because it is apparently the beer that becomes Ola Duba, which I grabbed for my cellar. Very nice brew, gave me hope for the future of my Ola Duba."
"O - There is good drinkability here. It has nice flavor, and I could easily drink a few of these in a night. It's sweet, but has a nice bitterness to it. I would definitely try this one again."
"Practically perfect in every way. Pours viscously with a brown head weighed down by the gravity of the beer itself. Smells of all the darks, roasted, chocolate, dried fruits, awesomeness. Super malt machine, easy and pleasant to drink. A porter that I can drink for the rest of my life."
"Overall - This is truly a world class beer. Everything about Old Engine Oil screams attention to detail and experienced craftsmanship. The price is a little steep considering the size of one bottle, but it is well worth the expense as this particular brew is truly sensational and an excellent addition to a fine meal."
"D: A velvety, bittersweet, full-bodied, balanced porter. Pretty good, but not as good as the Ola Dubh which uses this beer as a base. Recommended."
" Overall this is a delightful porter that makes me proud of my Scottish heritage."
"O- this could easily make itself a go to porter. Very good, great appearance, good roasted smoky flavor, and light enough to drink several."
"Pours a black color with no light getting through and a brownish/tan color head that is three fingers in depth and frothy. No lace is left. The smell is of roastiness along with dark chocolate and dark fruits. The taste has a roasty backbone with hints of licorice and dark chocolate. The flavor is rounded out by dark fruits. The mouthfeel is well bodied with minimal carbonation. The drinkability is high, the drink goes down very easy, very good flavor and well rounded."
"D: Well made porter, it's one I'll have again soon."
"Verdict:"
"Had on tap the glass was nice and dark slight head, smell was almost burnt ends with a strong taste of dark roasted coffee. The feel really lasted with the burnt feeling of coffee and chocolate. Finally the drinkabilty is good as this would be something I would drink again."
"D: An interesting change of pace for sure -- the dryness and the creeping sourness would make it hard to have more than two, but I enjoyed this one helping with no problem. A very unique brew that I will come back to periodically to check in with."
"A rare 5.0 here. Have seen this for years and never jumped. This is absolutely fantastic. One of the best porters I've ever had if not the best porter hands down."
"Wow is this drinkable stuff... Deep and dark, with a inviting head, the taste is rich with roasted malt. Some hops and a bit of smokiness come out in the finish. This is the kind of exceptional beer that I could drink all night on a chilly evening. In these days of DIPAs, Imperial Stouts, etc., it's easy to forget how satisfying a ""smaller"" beer like this can be."
"Overall I really appreciated it and it was just what I was looking for tonight. I would have been happy with a smaller bottle, but I'm gonna blame this one on my bored-as-Hell-no matter-what-I'm drinking tonight taste buds."
"Opinion: Overall this is a pretty good beer. The dark malts have an unusual balance with the flavor so that it comes across a little on the harsh side. It is getting easier to drink as I am about half-way through the glass, but I would have to say that this beer is just a little on the ""rich"" side to be a regular drinker."
"D - a hearty beer complex in flavours, a great example of a porter, though definitely not for the faint of heart"
"Drinkability: A good beer that I am glad I tried. I wasn't a huge fan initially but I believe this is a beer that could grow on me. I need to get more accustomed to this style of beer."
"D: Very tasty drink and well recommended."
"(D)- A great porter. Has a rich profile without being too over-the-top. A fine drinker for what it is."
"drinkability: I dig this. a good everyday drinking black ale."
"D - Really good. Great tasting and smooth feel make this a very enjoyable porter."
"D- Great drink-ability. I didn't give it a 5 here however just because of the lingering roasted and bitterness. For an exceptional here it would have had to have a cleaner finish. All in all a great beer; except for the $3.99 per 12oz bottle. That makes for an expensive afternoon and thus also brings down my ""drink-ability"" scale to a 4.5."
"Love to have another!"
"All in all, this brew kind of disappointed. Not as good as expected. Definitely many better ones in the style. Not worth your time."
"A sipper rather than a multi-beer quaffer."
"D: A porter that drinks like a stout! I think I'll have another."
"D - Very nice.This delivers exactly what it says it is striving for on the bottle."
"Drinkability: If you like your stouts dark, then check under the bottle top of this beauty. Your going to like it, trust me...my dad's a used car salesman."
"Very well crafted world class porter"
"very drinkable for a porter. nice and smooth. this is a good find."
"Mouth is very nice doesn't dry to much"
"D - A little tough to drink too much due to the dryness and astringent aftertaste."
"Very impressed with this beer and I will be picking up more at the first opportunity."
"D: First tried this one at a beer festival and have bought it quite a few times since then. It has a great taste and feel to it. You won't get bored with this beer with all the flavors it has."
"D - easily drinkable, but I would switch up sooner than layer."
"A great beer, totally drinkable and fun and tasty."
"Poured it out and it is very black and thick just as the name would suggest. Great head but went away fairly quickly. Lacing is great. Aroma is off roasted malts, coffee, and very bitter dark chocolate. I even get hints of wood. Taste is exceptional and sits very well with the smell. They seem to balance each other very well. Really like the mouth feel, very smooth. Aftertaste is very slight and doesnt stick around which is what i like most about this beer. You can go right to trying something else without having that lingering taste in the back of your mouth. I could drink several pints of this very easily. Great beer!"
"Nice, easy and enjoyable."
"MD - smooth, medium bodied and a bit thinner than I expected. Flavor is a bit more intence (but nice) though one is enough in a night"
"D - the name says it all. I can't think of another beer that suits the word ""oil"" better. doesn't have a high ABV, but is very heavy and filling."
"D - At 6%, it's very drinkable. Unlike many porters, it doesn't taste thin. Seems to withstand quite low temperatures. This feels like quite a demanding beer to drink though as it takes some analysis to get all the flavours out and in order. Alternatively, just sit down and enjoy the symphony. Fantastic stuff!"
"Price = $3.99 at Whole Foods"
"An absolutely excellent English Porter, incredibly enjoyable and worth seeking out. I will definitely be picking up more, and spreading the good word around every chance I get. One of the best of the style."
"Pours a deep black color with a thick tannish head and a good amount of lacing. Smells of roasted barley, a little smoke, and chocolate. Tastes pretty good with lots of roasted flavors, coffee, toffee, chocolate, and some smoke and just a touch of hops. Mouthfeel was thick and oily. Somewhat easy to drink."
"I like the beer, but I don't think I could drink a lot of it. The alcohol isn't all that high, but it's a bit more bitter than I like unless I'm drinking a high ABV beer or an IPA. There's nothing smooth about this."
"The pour procures an epically dark brown, nearly black, viscous liquid that is crowned with a 1.5"" thick, frothy beige head. The glass is adorned with much lacing and the head retains as a bubbly ring with a large island in the center. I can't even begin to describe how rich and balanced the aromas are. Can't help but take a sip and both aroma and flavor are described together. Hefty amounts of cocoa and coffee at first, then comes a nice and subtle (that's the key here) ashiness that is balanced by sweet caramel and biscuits. Hint of burnt toast and blackstrap molasses. There is no alcoholic burn; only a tiny warmth is apparent in the finish. Bitterness akin to coffee and char linger on and on. Carbonation is as good as is gets, yielding a velvety smooth texture to this surprisingly light/medium bodied beer. Looks can be deceiving! But as such, this is a lovely drinker that I would be happy to quaff all day."
"D - I could drink several of these."
"Even though it's kind of thick bodied it's not very heavy. I could have a few of these. It is a good enough beer to drink more than just one."
"Bought this as a single. Shop owner said is was one of his personal favorites. Pours a thick syrupy dark opaque dark brown to black with hints of maroon at the edges. Thin head which dissipates quickly. Rich chocolatey roasted flavor with hints of cherry. Chewy feel with no aftertaste. Wishing I had bought more than one of these! Think it's going to become one ofmy faves."
"Overall I didn't find this beer to be overpowering but rather had a good deal of nuance that the UK tends to favor more than us across the pond. An interesting and well made beer that's well worth a shot."
"D-A very good porter."
"Overall: This is good beer. A real easy drinking flavorful porter. I recommend trying this one."
"12oz bottle into a standard pint glass pours a deep almost opaque black with a nice frothy light tan head that lasts as a thin layer and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice amount of smooth dark malts with slight baker's cocoa. The taste is loads of dark malts, cocoa, smooth coffee and slight molasses, very complex. This is a great English Porter, one I would certainly have again."
"This is by far a session beer. The 6% ABV makes you aware the beer is there, and the body of the beer does too. I do think that this is a great example of the style and wish that more brands lived up to this standard."
"D - The char and bitter chocolate aren't overpowering. Would drink 2 at a bar if I caught this on tap."
"Good solid drinkability. Overall, a very nice brew."
"Drink- If I was having a second round of dessert or it was cold out another would have been ordered. Very good porter."
"D - An enjoyable English Porter that teeters on the edge of being a world class offering but falls ever so slightly short... I would still welcome on future occasions and would recommend for any serious BA... Loaded with enjoyable subtleties..."
"I poured into a pint glass to two fingers of brown head. This beer is dark brown with ruby highlights. The aroma is chocolate and nutty. The taste is dominated by some bitter hops with a bitter coffee taste. I don't remember this beer being this bitter. I recall a more chocolaty flavor. It fells viscous in my mouth. I am left disappointed in this one. The aroma was great but the taste was too bitter."
"D - Excellent. A great porter. Nothing bad to say about it."
"If this wasn't so damn expensive(3.50 for one 12oz), I'd drink this regularly."
"Fun labeling on good beer. This black ale truly looks black but basically is like an espresso(extra roasted) version of stout. Poured a meager 1/2"" head which dissipated. Same basic stout flavors of coffee and chocolate but certainly more so of each than usual. From the label and name I pretty much expected goop to pour out, but no, it's not anywhere near that thick, in fact many common stouts are thicker."
"T/M/D: Follows the aromas with the licorice and molasses dominating. A beautifully thick beer with a nice residual sweetness that balances the other flavours out to virtual perfection. Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy..."
"Poured from a brown 11.2 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is of malts, coffee, some hints of chocolate. Taste is good, a balance of malts and coffee, a hint of chocolate. Feels creamy in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"The mouth is creamy and smooth. Very mellow finish, but not flat at all. Well-done. Nice creamy milk chocolate flavors jived well with faint bitterness, and the mildest of hop backing. Well-balanced. Not complex, but wonderfully executed. Easy drinker for the cool evenings upon us now."
"Pours jet black with a light tan head. In the aroma, roasty coffee, but thinner than a stout. In the taste, roasty coffee and a small chocolate like hint. A smooth and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry coffee hint in the aftertaste. Almost looks and smells like a stout, but not as rich. Quite nice overall."
"Drinkability: I think I could really get into this beer on cool fall nights, much like tonight. The flavors are really good and robust, and the ABV isn't going to be something that knocks you on the ground."
"D - Finishing this one won't be hard at all, the amazing taste makes in a Porter to sip on and savor."
"D - 6% and all this flavor? Give me another."
"This is a big beer for only 6%. It's definitely a sipping beer and there's reason they only sell you one. I'm going to work on this one for a while."
"A well-made old school porter, with lots and lots going on, but not too much of any one thing, thankfully. The expected sourness is well accompanied by lots of cocoa, malt, coffee, and fruit, all in appropriate proportions, which goes a long way in explaining the steady, common popularity of this offering."
"Beer is thin and quite bitter in the back but that's from the roast. Its moderately sweet up front but there isn't much going on in the midpalate. The beer is creamy and smooth overall and leaves only this bitterness as a lasting / aftertaste. Its pretty good."
"D - Overall a very tasty offering, and more than I was expecting. Could throw back a couple of these at a time, and the mouthfeel keeps you craving more. Flavours are discreet and pleasant, but not overpowering. Recommended to any porter fan."
"This beer is unbelievably good, you can tell it has a Scottish heritage easy on the hops and big malt favor."
"Drinkability -- I probably won't be reaching for this one again. It's certainly an well-crafted beer, however there isn't enough depth of flavor and the burnt bitterness is piercing and leads to palette fatigue."
"D - Very enjoyable and not too heavy. I wouldn't drink this too often but when I do It will be a fun reunion."
"I didn't enjoy this quite so much the first time I drank it, but I appreciate it much more now; really enjoy the roastyness of it. Maybe it was drinking Ola Dubh (Old Engine Oil aged in scotch whisky casks) and feeling the things I enjoyed about that beer so much which increased my appreciation of Old Engine Oil."
"This is a nearly perfect beer. I can't imagine anything being changed on this brew to make it better. This is in my top 10!"
"Overall a disappointment."
"D - Very high and delicious. Near perfect based on ABV and overall combination and execution of flavors."
"D: Especially good."
"Cheers!"
"This is all-around good, but nothing jumped out to me as great. I had higher hopes, as I'm a big fan of the style."
"This is a nice stout, but tastes more like a Baltic porter, honestly. Too often when it comes to English style stouts, I find that the Fuggles and Goldings give them an oxidized, ruddy mouthfeel that I don't care for, but this seems to be nicely offset by the Galena. At $3.99 for the 12oz bottle, I'm not inclined to buy it again, as KZoo stout is cheaper, more readly available where I am at, and tastier, IMO."
"Dark color, almost black, but when placed against the light, it shows a dark reddish tint. Its foam is slightly persistent in the glass. Aroma: Nice boquet of coffee, light touch of vanilla and roasted malt. Taste of coffee. Bitter and dry. Very drinkable and delicious! The label of this beer is different here in Brazil."
"Pretty good offering that I may give one more shot at some point, but certainly nothing that blew me away."
"A wonderfully pleasant and surprisingly drinkable ale. Not really befitting the name, this is much more enjoyable than a glass of similarly-looking dirty engine lube... or at least I would assume as much."
"Very well done. This will likely become a beer that I keep on hand with some regularity. Pick some of this up the next time you see it on the shelf, you won't be disappointed."
"for a first beer from a brewer I think I picked a good one, I can't wait to try some of the other brews by these guys that just got released here in Alberta"
"Drinkability: While listed as a porter (it was once listed as an Old Ale) this is one of those beers that tests the myth that the difference between a porter and a stout lies in the dark roast malt. I've found with this beer that while it should be sipped slowly and savored, each sip also follows naturally from the first and I'm finishing this beer wanting more than there is. I'll certainly seek this beer out to have again in the future"
"Drinkability: The thick, robust flavor definitely makes it a beer to enjoy slowly. 	However, the complex taste is something that can definitely be enjoyed for a beer or 	three."
"D- Very drinkable given the lower ABV for how strong a flavor this delicious porter offers."
"This was the third in my series of British brews tonight, following Oxfordshire Triple B (England) and Williams Brothers Alba Scots Pine Ale (Scotland). Boy, did the Scots ever blow away the English tonight. I was a bit worried after drinking the fabulous Alba, but even though I bucked the trend, and rated the Harvietaun lower, it was a great beer to end the night with. Like an after-dinner coffee."
"I like how this is definitely a porter in the classic sense. Very drinkable. I'd pick this up again for sure. Great example of the style, though I'm not sure what it has to do with engine oil."
"D- This is definately drinkable and would make a good session beer if you are into this style."
"M: Dry and Light."
"This has to be considered a classic of the style. Coffee, bitter chocolate, molasses, dark fruits, charred wood, a bracing grassy bitterness that has a faint citrus note in there, nice toffee and brown sugar sweetness, slightly thin body but at 6% this is a supremely drinkable, loaded with flavor porter you would gladly session. Really very nice, this is what the style was meant to be."
"D-- Excellent porter. Well hidden ABV, complex and has a lot going on with it. Also quite drinkable and can have 2-3 and not get tired of it."
"Slight creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable. Excellent,"
"Drinkability is good. Tastes more like a porter than an old ale to me. Pretty good beer overall."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin for me, and the carbonation feels a little bit underwhelming, but it's still good, with small, quite sharp bubbles."
"An enjoyable old ale, and probably a good introduction to this style (both in flavor and price). I personally prefer their Ola Dubh which have a lot more going on with various subtle things in the flavor."
"Good nevertheless."
"I love this beer, most especially on draft. Great by itself or with fruity, chocolaty, or rich (in general) desserts."
"D: I could definitely drink a couple of these. Overall quite enjoyable. For sure I'd like to review this one again down the road after my senses develop a bit better and see if I can pick anything else out."
"D- Great beer and very easy to drink!"
"Overall - Overall, I'm very impressed with the beer. The flavor was very balanced and delicious. Great amount of chocolate and malts. Well done."
"Very sweet to me, with some ripe cheese and ginger bread perhaps?"
"D- I would have guessed this to be more of an english stout than an old ale but either way its quite tasty."
"Its a decent beer. Nice one."
"One of several nice birthday beer gifts from my wife this year, picked it out with help from John at Granite Liquors in Weymouth, thanks to both! Poured it into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. Comes out as close to black as possible, but it's dark brown. When held up to the light and pouring it you can see some deep mahogany colors right around the edges. It has an off white colored head, it doesn't take too long for it to go away and provides a little bit of glass retention. All in all a pretty good looking beer, I wouldn't say it looks like old engine oil in my opinion, but I guess that's a good thing. Smell is very good it has a lot going on. Has some dark fruit/fig characteristics, almost more like a dark fruity liquor though. It has some chocolate aromas to compliment the well roasted malts. This has a bready smell to it which I'm generally not a huge fan of but its quite pleasant in this mixture of aromas. Not a very hoppy beer, but not exactly a hop-head brew. The taste is equally excellent, chocolate roasted malts are the dominant flavor. It still has fruitiness to it, not as dominant as the smell, but still good. The dark fruit liquor taste actually takes a slight backseat to some hops hear, but only slightly, they are both in the vehicle if you know what I mean. Well balanced flavor overall, very tasty, if my jeep's old engine oil tasted anything like this, I'd be drinking it! The mouthfeel is very good, not as thick as I expected it to be based on the name. It's by no means light bodied, it's still a full bodied beer. It's somewhat smooth, close to creamy and incredibly drinkable. This beer could be drank on any occasion whatsoever. It's full enough for the lovers of dark beer and smooth and drinkable enough for the those who like the lighter ones. I think this would be an excellent gateway beer for those who are trying to get into darker beers, a truly great beer."
"Drinkability: Good by itself or with a meal, but it's so intense in it's bittersweet flavor that I think I could only have one an evening or I'd burn out my tastebuds."
"A nice solid beer, but not one that was really any better on cask then it was on gas (IMHO). Still a nice beer...."
"D: Drinking this beer wasn't that difficult, it seemed to be something like a hybrid between a porter and a stout."
"I really enjoyed this one. I'll have to go back and have another before the keg kicks."
"D: Very good."
"This is an amazingly drinkable stout-black ale. I wasn't that dazzled by the smell, a sort of sweet milk with some roast. But this dark brew has a LOT of chocolate and roast coffee in it. I will definitely seek out a couple more of these. Good job Scotland!"
"Best before date Sept 09. Yep, more than six months later this bad boy holds up pretty well. Black as....engine oil? Lovely nose of complex malts, roastiness, touch of coffee and some liqorice-its lost nothing. A rich viscous mouthfeel that finishes long and memorably. Top shelf black ale that proves it has life well beyond it's BBD."
"I'll jump on board the 'this really makes me think of a stout and it should be' band wagon. I'm sure they call it an Old Ale partially because it wouldn't be considered as special if it was 'just another stout', which it isn't. I consumed this faster than is normal for me."
" A lovely dark ale ...not in character with an ""old ale"" at all...had I tried this blindfolded, I'd have pegged it as a rich cherry-chocolate porter."
"M, D- Creamy, velvety. The slight bitterness is well within bounds and the overall balance is excellent. On tap, the old Engine Oil offers a bit more fruit complexity but is also a bit on the still side for CO2. Very easy-drinking for such a substantial brew."
"D: due to mouthfeel and great taste its a great drinker."
"Notes: Nice fairly complex beer. Has aspects of a number of different styles and has a bit more hop flavor than I was really expecting from an old ale that smells a lot like a porter/stout. It isn't my favorite beer to sip on, but it is definitely a nice one that offers a change of pace. I would definitely get this again, definitely worth a try."
"Overall this is a good beer. Its a bit more bitter than I normally perfer, but I can drink this all night."
"D-This was decidedly more drinkable than I expected it to be. I could see myself having a couple of these on a cold winter night, which is unfortunately what we have in store for us tomorrow. Time for a beer run!"
"Slightly thin feel at first (not too much, just thinner than expected). However this builds to a substantial body with very thick, viscous mouthfeel."
"Overall, this is a good beer to drink once in a blue moon. Worth a try if you enjoy the style."
"D: Goes down easy, it would be very easy - and enjoyable - to put down a few of these."
"Drinkability> would love this with oysters"
"Dark brown and impossible to see through with a whipped up tan head that leaves plenty of fine lace behind on the glass. Dark chocolate malt, dark fruit and some roasty coffee are all present and accounted for in the nose. Rich and roasty flavors are well balanced with a heavy handed hop bittering that really balances the sweet malty flavors nicely. Really nice and complex flavors. Nice and medium full bodied with bright carbonation. A truly unique beer."
"Deep, dark, shiny crude oil black at first look but with ruby highlights and lowlights. Minimal compact and creamy brown head with an agressive pour. Big, Bold, Intense roasted grain, sweet toffee, dark fruit, earthy and floral hops and molasses scents. Taste is slightly more subdued than scent, with a full roasted grain profile, without tasting burnt, backed by sweet nutty toffee, dark dried fruit, and a nice bitter earthy and floral hop presence. Medium bodied, smooth and faintly coating. Truly unique... name, appearance and smell make you think overpowering, but taste and bosy is nothing but pleasing and smooth."
"I'd be willing to order this for more than one round but not more than a few at a time...I want this beer to be a treat."
"This is a very good beer, and am glad to have finally gotten around to trying it. Not as rich, thick and overpowering as the big stouts so many of us are into, but it's not trying to be. There is alot going on for, especially for the size."
"Very drinkable. Old ale? I would call this more of a stout. Regardless, still a very nice ale that is worthy of a try."
"What else needs to be said...look at the ratings. This is easily on of the finest beers I have ever had the privilege to experience. The aroma of cocoa, coffee, roasted malt and caramel sugar waft over the thick creamy head and the thick viscous black liquid that lies beneath. Even after sessioning a few other beers including one of the IPA beasts from Stone this beers flavors are so rich and so pronounced that there is no denying the amount of care and quality in this product. My friend simply put it this way after his first sip...""If I could die right now I would be a happy man!"""
"At 6% ABV, this beer is not a session beer but just misses that by a notch. As others have alluded to, this seems like more of a Scotch Ale than anything else and is a good drink to have during these cold winter months. It doesn't have the bourbon-barrel aftertaste to it but nevertheless, it's a worth a shot once since this isn't a style that one comes across every day. In my opinion, this resembles ""new engine oil"" more than anything else..."
"Medium carbonation. Mouthfeel is nice, a bit on the thin side with a dry finish."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full, a tad chewy. This one threw me for a loop with the smell & taste combo. Fortunately it was not overwhelming in any aspect, & I had a real good time alternating the smell & flavor -- smells like a Flemish Brown, tastes like a Schwarzbier. Very interesting indeed. Not sure it lives up the name: ""Old Engine Oil"" conjures a thick, viscous brew a la ""Ten Fidy"" or ""Old Viscosity."" Throw it on the misnomer pile with Chocolate Indulgence. Very enjoyable, moniker aside."
"...(continuing)getting a lot more bittersweet chocolate now. Roasted maltiness, even a licorice. Not boozy at all. Has a great aftertaste that lingers in your mouth for a while. Mild complexity, nice and tasty!"
"Light to medium body with light carbonation. Seems to be lacking somewhat in body. This was fairly enjoyable but a little light for the style and not one of my favorites overall. Good to try but I probably won't come back for more."
"I was hoping to have my socks knocked off by Old Engine Oil, because I just bought a bottle of Ola Dubh 16. Old Oil wasn't bad, but I'm not sure I justified the purchase of what is basically an aged Old Oil for 9 bucks. Oh well."
"Was fortunate enough to have this great beer on tap at the Lions Pride in Brunswick. The beer has a strong head off the tap with a good smoke and hints of chocolate on the nose. The taste has a nice smoke to it with a slight coffee quality. I thought the beer was beautiful!"
"D: Overall a nice beer, more roasted and more chocolate than the style would suggest, closer to a stout than an old ale."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, decent kick, good representation of style, most of the Old Ales that I've had have been more like barleywines, but this one is more stout-like, which I expected since the label reads ""Viscous, Chocolaty, Roasty"". Overall it was a very good beer and seemed to handle the age quite well."
"I could see the correlation with a Scotch Ale. It has a roasty, smokey, peaty, and slightly burnt flavor. Not quite old engine oil in color and viscousity unless it is somewhat fresh and hot engine oil. Very small head forms and quickly settles to a thin cap. Very little lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is likewise that of a Scotch Ale. Maybe it has something to do with the region it is brewed. Roasted malt is the dominant aroma along with some smokiness. Not overly complex in aroma or flavor. Medium body with nice carbonation makes it pleasant to drink. I was a bit let down by this beer. I was expecting something much more complex. Without the benefit of barrel aging, Harvieston's Old Ales lack the little extra something to take them to the next level."
"Overall: Disappointing beer. Feels like drinking bitter water. What a shame. Highly overrated in my opinion."
"Overall a decent beer. A little too smoked and bitter but worthy of drinking for sure."
"Was purchasing Harviestoun's twisted and bitter and the clerk talked me into this. Looks good, black and lacey. Smells interesting, dark and mysterious. Taste is heavy on the smoke, really dominates and pushes everything else aside. Too much black patent malt for my t-buds, doubtfull I'll indulge again, tho it's impressive they've packed this much flavor into a 6% tipple, it's all smokestack."
"Served very cold with a dark black appearance and hardly even a hint of a head, but some spatterings of deep tan film were apparent. Smell was a little roasty, a little sweet, a little smoky, not much of anything in particular. Taste was about the same. Mouthfeel was very light and watery, not impressed with it. Drinkability was fine."
"Good beer wasn't what I was expecting at all. Was only the second ""old ale"" I have had and it was nothing like the first I had. Reminded me of a really good stout. Would definitely buy again."
"Well balanced beer that manages to get tons of flavour from the roasted malts without any unpleasant acidity or astringency. One of the best stouts that I've tried."
"Pours a beautiful inky black brew, impenetrable to light with a one finger mocha color head with a mix of both large and fine bubbles. There is minimal head retention, that gives way to an even blanket of fine lace. This Old Ale style gives off a nice roasty chocolate smell, with some caramel sweet malt and alcohol. The taste is pretty unassuming, almost subtle. First up, roasted malt flavors, and some dark chocolate. Dark fruit is released on the palate as the beer warms up. Some plum, vinous qualities and raisin give way to a bittersweet finish. This beer has a surprisingly lighter body than I expected from the look of the beer. It had that deep thick black appearance that an Imperial Stout has, but this beer was relatively light and creamy, with minimal stick on the palate, and only some heat in the finished, which perhaps has mellowed with age. This beer was a very nice drink, it has that thick beauty to it, without the heavy follow through on the palate. I would describe it to someone as a more roasty, robustly dark chocolate Guinness; which is never a bad thing!"
"D: I don't know if this is the base beer for the Ola Dubh series, but on its own it's a pretty tasty beer that seems well-suited to the whiskey casks they foist upon it. My buddy seemed to be less impressed than I was, but as a drinkable porter deal, this certainly satisfies. Not exactly outstanding in the old ale category though."
"Review from notes taken on: 10/2/09."
"D- Decent oatmeal stout (how I would class it based on flavour and oats in the ingredients), but not as complex and smooth as my beloved St-Ambroise."
"D - Quite good, since it's not that strong (compared to imperial styles or barley wines, for example) though very full-bodied."
"All in all, this is a well done old ale. Roasty, bittersweet. Enough elements to keep it interesting. Would pick up another one of these if I were in the mood for the style."
"I think this marks my first in the old ale category, but I am excited to go out for more. This one hits my mark."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a completely opaque black with a thick dark red head. The head clung to the sides nicely, and left a thin layer on top. Aroma was sweet, akin to a dark chocolate with a small bit of oatmeal. Taste was sweet, slightly milky. Melt a bit watery in the mouth, but yet still had body and texture. Pleasant to drink, but the ABV hit surprisingly fast"
"Overall, this is not a bad brew and it's definitely worth a try. I'll definitely seek out some other offerings from Harviestoun while I'm in Scotland."
"drinkability - well i doubt i ever drink this again unless its free - high price tag for black pils = pass"
"D - Excellent flavor, but everything else about the brew was quite average."
"Poured black, allowing no light to shine through. Thin mocha head appeared on top and dissapeared pretty quickly leaving only a couple bubbles on top. Smell is dark chocolate, unripe fruits, and burnt malt. Similar to a dry stout but more fruity. Burnt malt, chocolate, caramel, and toffee up front in the taste. Finishes with some dark fruits and and some hop bitterness. Complex. Actually leaves some sweet notes on the tongue afterwards, as opposed to the bitterness after stouts. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, low carbonation. Overall a delicious and quite drinkable beer."
"This is truly a special beer, full of flavor without becoming syrupy, thoroughly drinkable and interesting to drink with each new bottle. Great for sipping from a pint glass on a cold wintry night. I dream of one day finding this on tap, as that would really make for a memorable moment."
"Looking for a Dry Irish Stout brewed in Scotland? Here it is, and it a very good example of one. BTW, this is NOT a Old Ale."
"D - I think I could drink this all night, it's really very good in every aspect. This is one of my favorites, I've loved it every time I've had it."
"Drinklability: Beautifully silky ale, with rich and moreish flavours. Most people who know anything about beer will have already tried this, if you haven't, then you should."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this beer is quite fine...delicious, perfectly balanced, and incredibly drinkable. I've had this a few times before, once on tap at Nicholson's in Cincinnati...and each time I have it, I am reminded of why so many people buzz about this beer. It is worthy."
"Seams closer to a light stout then an old ale as far as color and flavour profile. Still gets some pretty high marks though"
"The mouthfeel and drinkability are fantastic, I will have to get this one again in the future!"
"A remarkably easy quaff, especially for it's style. I found it to be a fine accompaniment with lunch on a cold sunny day. However, it may suffer slightly from the hype. I have a couple of bottles back home, one for now, and one to age."
"A decent beer but it doesn't seem to fit the style. Regardless, don't let it stop you from trying it."
"Not a big mouth feel on this one, but conversely is easy to sip down pretty quickly. Also, not too strong to say yes to a 2nd."
"Got this one on a whim one night. I had no idea what to expect, I just wanted to try a brew from Scotland. It was shockingly black when poured. Literally looks like oil. The head was a wimpy beige colour and was basically gone in a short while. The smell is nice. Chocolate and coffee, malty and roasty (as advertised hah). The taste offers more of the roasty coffee, with only a hint of chocolate. It was surprisingly thin in terms of mouthfeel. Very light carbonation and smooth but not as thick I imagined. This went down easy and wasn't too heavy. I imagine you could knock back a few of these in a night. A pleasant find."
"D: Don't be scared off by the label/name claiming how ""thick"" it is. This isn't a one-and-done drink if you want to have a few. I don't know if it's my style for a session beer but would be able to have 2 or even 3 of these in a row without issue."
"D: Not hard to drink and the alcohol never really becomes prevalent. I think if you enjoy coffee beers or beers that are very forward with their roasted overtones, Old Engine Oil is probably right up your alley.  A nice English Porter that mirrors many flavors that I happen to enjoy in stouts, which makes this ale a nice bridge between the styles.  In terms of English Porters, I think I would give a slight nod to this over Sam' Smiths Taddy Porter, if only because Old Engine Old just seemed to have a more robust profile on both the nose and the palate.  However, I wouldn't mind trying the two side by side for a more accurate comparison.  Nor would I mind seeing how the vintage, whisky barrel-aged aged Old Engine Oil(s) stack up."
"I have to say with the name I was expecting a little thicker with a little more chocolate flavors. But I have to say it is a very enjoyable beer."
"EIDT: the warmer this got, the worse it tasted. No depth, no melding of the flavors...ended up drain-pouring half the bottle. I'm baffled as to the appeal of this beer."
"Great beer with lots of flavour. Really good for a beer that clocks in at 6%. Great on a cold winter's day."
"Very smooth and easy to drink, a decent dessert beer."
"Notes: A highly drinkable black ale. Smells like and tastes up front like an Imperial Russian Stout, but the mid-palate and finish are like the headiest black lager you've ever had. Crazy amount of malt and flavor for being only 6%. Highly recommend."
"D - For as heavy and ruch as this beer is (and it may be one of the richest I've ever had), it's very drinkable. I'm sure a few would do some damage, but I'd love every second of it!"
"Drinkability- Much more drinkable than it looks and smells."
"Poured black and smells toasted and like coffee. Tastes malty and roasted with a combo of chocolate, coffee, malt and hops that gives a touch of sweetness; the roasted flavor dominates, but the beer is smooth and light like an ale yet feels and tastes like a stout/porter. Overall a very good combination and a very good beer!"
"D--Nothing to separate this beer from the pack. Just a nice drinking but boring ale."
"I was scared to try this because it sounds like it would be black and thick and bitter- but the name was so cool. The black-brown-ruby color was really beautiful, and it turned out to be much less intimidating in aroma and taste than expected: there were lots of dark roasted scents and flavors: malts, chocolate, grains, coffee, raisins. Unfortunately, the nice flavor profile was kind of let down by the thin feel of the beer- a little more body would carry them better. Overall, it was drinkable, but tasted a little weaker than I would have liked, but I'd definitely order it again."
"Call it an old ale, call it a porter or a stout - call it whatever you'd like, this is a fine beer. It is rich and gratifying, a fulfilling beer worthy of always keeping on hand in the cellar. And it's a little like the old model Ford car on its label; it's big, loud, chunky and above all else, reliable. They simply don't make 'em like this anymore."
"This is a beer that never wows me in any area, yet I come away from it having enjoyed it quite a bit. I'll never turn one down, that's for sure."
"I wish the mouthfeel was a bit thicker but thats my only complaint with this beer."
"While I do enjoy this brew and will drink it again, when given the chance, it does not live up to it's name, sadly. I expected so much more."
"Thick smooth and creamy mouthfeel, heavy enough to be fulfilling without being overwhelming. For such a robust beer it was surprisingly easy to drink and it went well with a basic meal. The alcohol is well hidden too."
"The more I drink of this the more I don't like it."
"Thanks to Viggo for the bottle!"
"Quite good, and I'll probably buy it again."
"Conclusion: So simple; so smooth; so rewarding. One of those beers that knocks your socks off without really awing you in any distinct way; it's not a kick in the teeth like a Bigfoot or a different-flavor-a-minute complexity like Hennepin...it's just so simple, understated, smooth, and delicious. I've had chocolate porters and chocolate stouts made with real chocolate that don't come close to the cocoa aroma and flavor of this brew; damn good beer."
"I enjoyed this one from a cask at a beer festival in Edinburgh. Appears thick and black in the glass. Rather opaque, actually. Very thick mouthfeel and a bitter, roasted flavour with some chocolate sweetness. Nice aftertaste as well. I would have this one again."
"Old Engine Oil is an impressive Old Ale. I like it quite a bit. It'd benefit from more punch in the aromatics department. The flavor could be improved by somehow adjusting the acidic flavor. It's more than solid in all other respects. Definitely recommended."
"Overall: A delicious beer. It's listed as an Old Ale, but I would consider it a cross between a traditional Scottish Wee Heavy and a robust porter. It has that caramelized sweetness up front but porter-like roastiness (I would guess roast barley) and the results are quite tasty. Definitely one to seek out."
"Overall a solid beer! With a name like old engine oil I was hoping for this to be a very thick viscous beer which it was not. However, I was still very satisfied and I would buy this beer again. Cheers everyone!"
"This poured a clear black ruby with a bit of tan head. It smelled like brown sugar, honey wheat, and raisins, with some sweet caramel and roasted barley and oak. It tasted like roasted barley with some coffee and brown sugar, and a bit of oak. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bittersweet aftertaste. Overall this was a decent old ale, but not the best. The flavor wasn't as sweet as the scent, which is a shame. The body was good, but I would have preferred it to be fuller. It was clean and easy to drink, especially since it's a relatively low ABV for old ales. I imagine this is what old ales used to be like a long time ago, when they were a primary ingredient to porters. Modern old ales seem to have more of a barleywine character to them, which I prefer. This beer didn't really have anything wrong with it, but it was somewhat boring and forgettable."
"D - At 6% alcohol, this one is very drinkable. As always, I'd like to give it a whirl from the tap."
"Drinkability: What I got and what I was expecting were two different things. This is a very smooth and drinkable old ale and perhaps my favorite I have tried in the style. More complex than I have described, I will reach for this again."
"D - I would love to have this on tap somewhere around here. Fat chance."
"Overall: One of the best beers I've ever had. It is one of those beers that can be enjoyed thoroughly, as everything about the beer was nice. Highly recommend"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, maybe a little bit more watery than expected, moderate to low carbonation."
"M: It could be a tad creamier and thicker. I bet the beer is better from a cask, but that's probably true for most British beers."
"This beer is different than anything I have I had, and I like it. Malty, earthy, and bitter components all melded together in a way that I have not experienced."
"The pour was a very dark black with the look of a porter but almost no head. The aroma was extremely interesting and nothing like I had experienced before. It had a mixture of floral hops, chocolate, raisin, and brandy or some kind of hard liquor. The mouthfeel was fairly bold. The taste had a dose of hops, coffee grounds, and grain. It is very pungent. I can see where they get the name egine oil but boy it was a good experience."
"Overall, a really decent brew. From the bottle shaped like a piston to the description on the back, everything matches this beer perfectly. When they say smooth, they mean it. Something a little bit more pronounced in flavour and I would have given this a solid A. Nonetheless, one I look forward to getting again."
"Thick & full bodied, flavorful, balanced, and drinkable. What else is there to say? Great stuff."
"D: Oh my yes."
"Overall - Good beer, I like the mixture of sweetness with the bitterness that makes it seem to have a dry finish. It is heavy, but not too heavy. I would not drink a bunch of them, but I doubt that's the brewer's intnet. This is a good beer to savor and enjoy."
"Overall, I enjoyed this beer more and more as it warmed up. A solid choice."
"D: everything comes together to make a highly enjoyable dark beer"
"D - Fair, the bitter aftertaste keeps it to 1-2beers before it would be a little overpowering."
"Outstanding old ale. A dark brew that stops just short of a stout doesn't get any better. Chocolately and viscous throughout and a hint of licorce on the back side. Weighs nicely on the tongue before hitting the palate. The amount of alcohol is just right. The Scots do it again. Beer Bliss."
"D - Highly drinkable. Well balanced with a smooth mouthfeel."
"D: Highly drinkable, although I might consider this more of a dessert beer. Most english ales are quite quaffable, and this is no different."
"On tap tonight at Deep Ellum. Served in a proper Harviestoun Old Engine Oil chalice (very nice). Light black color, shades of charcoal. Decent sized white head. Smelled a bit like molasses and peat. Taste was good and a bit unusual for the style. Had an earthy, whisky, bittersweet chocolate flavor to it. A bit different flavor than other old ales I've tasted, which made this one stand out a bit. Smooth body made this a pleasure to sip. This beer was a pleasure to drink, and a top notch offering from this Scottish brewer."
"Final Thoughts - Before drinking this beer, I saw it on BA and thought, how can a beer called Old Engine Oil be a grade A beer. Even more so, since I figured that it would be thick, rich and excessively bitter. Fortune smiled on me, and I saw a bottle of it at the liquor store, so I figured I'd give it a shot and save it for a rainy day. That rainy day came today, and I was very impressed and pleased. I'm certainly going to buy this stuff again, and see if I can get some buddies to give it a shot."
"Drinkability: If it weren't for the cost ($8.00 for a 12oz bottle), I'd order this again. Loved the smell, and liked the other aspects of it. Not my favorite old ale, but a pretty drinkable one."
" It looked and tasted like a porter to me so that is how I reviewed it."
"Delightful, though the burnt finish might become overwhelming after a couple."
"It's a smooth beer, and quite drinkable, but slightly too raw on the back palate to me. Still, it's a very decent drop of beer, with lots of character and some most enjoyable elements."
"Drinkability: I'll stick with trying more of the Ola Dubh stuff, as this was decent, but nothing was overly impressive for me. It doesn't seem like an old ale as much as a dry stout, and there was a lot of depth lacking at what otherwise could've been a great beer. The $3 price tag also puts a bit of a damper on me wanting to ever try another one."
"D. Overall a pleasant beer. Not over powering and yet fulfilling."
"A great beer that I'm glad I picked up, and will again when the spirit moves me."
"D: Deep dark and delicious."
"Notes - Excellent, very complex aroma and flavor."
"Drinkability - Smooth and pleasant; somewhere between a stout and an ale, worth pouring again, would be a beer to pair with a chocolate dessert."
"D= Big beautiful flavors here that sort of defy categorization. It reminds me of an old ale and a stout blended. In any event it is incredibly enjoyable and highly drinkable."
"Pretty drinkable stuff, the one thing that detracts is the more bitter roasted notes that muddle things up slightly. Certainly recommended for fans of dark, chocolaty brews. All in all this is an approachable, chocolaty brew that would serve well for those looking to get into the darker styles of beer."
"Great drinkability, especially for a bigger beer such as this. Nice balance of flavors, not overly sweet, and not too bitter. I could easily drink six of these in a night."
"I poured this cool name for a beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was black as it should be. The head was a dark tan color. The lacing was decent. The smell of the beer was choclkotywith a bit of a burnt smell. The beer had a viscous mouthfeel, kinda chewy that I liked. I will buy again."
"Mouthfeel is smooth but a little on the watery side. It may have the look of old engine oil but surely it does not have the consistency. The one area I will give the beer credit towards though is that it ends better than it starts. Each passing mouthful is a little more enjoyable than the last and before you reach the end of your first glass, you'll already be thinking about your second."
"Concur with bowersdm below. An excellent pour with great color, aroma, flavor and a nice roasted chocolate aftertaste. Although pricey at nearly $4 for a 16 oz. bottle, this Black Ale is tasty and enjoyable and it doesn't carry a heavy flavor like a stout."
"Future outlook: Pretty big disappointment. This brew is supposedly age-able, but perhaps my bottle's Old Engine Oil was just too damn old...I'll probably try this again, but only if I'm certain the bottle is fresh enough."
"D - it's a good beer. I'd have another."
"Overall, this is my first Old Ale and I liked it. If I did not know what I was drinking, I would confuse it with strong Irish Stout. It was good."
"D - Even at 6% ABV, this is rich enough as to make it a sipper. Would be a good pairing for a dessert or cigar if that is your inclination."
"I poured this one into a snifter and it offered a black brew with a nice, brown head with decent retention and rather quick lacing. Smells of roasted malts with earthy/musty qualities. Also has some woody, tobacco and cocoa notes. Medium body with prickly carbonation. Very enjoyable brew."
"Pours a cloudy, dark black color. One inch head of a tan color (one of the darkest color heads I've come across). Decent retention and good lacing. Smells strongly of alcohol and roasted malts. There's also might be a hint of hops in the aroma. So far as I can tell, it fits the style of an Old Ale. Smooth and thick mouth feel. There's an average carbonation level present along with a noticeable bitterness on the tongue. Tastes of roasted malts first off, then the alcohol is strong. The aftertaste is of a malt dryness that matures into a slight chocolaty flavor. There's a hop bitterness, but not strong hop flavor. Along with the malt there is a sweetness to the brew that counteracts the malt and hop bitterness. Overall, a rather enjoyable beer that's worth a try."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours thick and black with a fluffy tan head. Smells of alcohol, malt and some fruit. Taste is thick complex malty with some chocolate and coffee flavors. Very smooth, much more drinkable than expected. Would drink again."
"MF&D - the viscosity of the brew is perfect, not too watery, not too thick. the only thing that could have been a bit better would have been some more carbonation. that would have helped add a bit more body to the brew. but other than that I though it a marvelous beer and one to be a complete paradigm of the style."
"This is ho-hum, nothing extravagant, but definatly ok for the style. This would be a terrific session beer, but I'm not sure how many more I'd want to drink with all that carbonation and oversmoked creal grain flavors."
"I guess I had higher expectations for something with a name like Old Engine Oil. It's a pretty good brew, but definitely not the best Old Ale."
"Pours with virtually zero head, perfectly black color, way too opaque to gauge amount of bubbles in the liquid. Extremely malty nose bursting with roasted coffee and nuts scents, hardened caramel, Valrhona chocolate, maple syrup and a glimmer of fig fruit and buttered corn, close to full absence of hop scents. Curiously light-bodied, given the depth of the primary flavors, glides through the mouth. Loaded with coffee bean, mocha powder, hazelnut with even a slight tarry edge. Bitterness breaks through during the mid-palate, gains traction towards end and breathes life into the whole. The level of carbonation appears too high at first but you can get used to it. No citrus but the vague dried fruit nuance remains. Vibrancy of narrow range of flavors amplifies finish."
"Mouthfeel - surprisingly light, watery and smooth from the low carbonation. Feels good but it would be that much better if a little more creamy."
"Good and very drinkable. The mouthfeel is kind of like an oatmeal stout, but the flavour leans more towards a classic english stout IMO."
"D. This is a very drinkable ale that would certainly be best on cask but is wonderful and available in bottled form."
"Flavour is all cocoa/coffee and roasty malts. Roast beef abounds. This is thick like engine oil and a gorgeous beer all round. Hoorah for my ol' mate Glenn for bring this around."
"Full and viscous; with this much malt, you can't help but be. Good viscosity and attenuation, as this is still pretty damn drinkable despite being somewhat thorny and quite different from what the American palate is used to."
"Thanks to northyorksammy for this!"
"Extremely drinkable. You almost take beers like this for granted, because their complexity is subtle yet quite deep; when you finally find it, but your glass is nearly empty since it's so easy to drink. Top notch beer in the British tradition. Cheers!"
"The carbonation though is very light on the tongue, shifting into a roasted nuttiness that seems to make laps on the tongue, leaving behind a bit of smokiness and some bitterness. Surprisingly, there isn't as much malty sweetness as you might assume with a beer this dark - while it's there at the very beginning of the drink, it quickly dims to completely fade away. Good and dark like I enjoy, but nothing overly execptional."
"The beer was full bodied and very pleasant to drink. My only reservation about spending a night on these is at 6% this may be a bit on the strong side. Very highly recommended, the best dark Scottish beer I have ever tried."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Mouthfeel if fantastic, pleasantly round, full, thick and unctuous. Drinkability is above average."
"8/4/8/3/15 (3.8/5)"
"Good, well rounded black ale. Not quite what I think of when I think stout or porter but pretty good. Worth a shot."
"(rated Apr 17, 2007)"
"The aroma is of chocolate and caramel. The taste is real smooth and velvety. There is a tad bit of bitterness that accompanies the second half down the throat. I found this to be one of the better old ale's I have consumed. You really get the caramel and toffee coming though most of the drink. This one is worth buying again, for sure."
"nice and dark. i like the dark ones, near black brown. stout but thinner. quite a creamy head. latte in color. nose is a good malt and fruit. the taste is bitter to compare to a stout. i can't really figure to coin it as anything other than a stale bitter, tobacco like. soft chocolate. buttery. the gentle fruit works great with the bitter quality. a soft leather and chalk also. great stuff. i think it may become a winter regular at 3 bucks a bottle."
"D: As I said, this beer isn't necessarily in keeping with an old ale, but it's still tasty and well made. Subtle, complex."
"Black pour with a tan ring of bubbles. Roasted malt and nuts, bittersweet chocolate, prunes, and coffee. Not as viscous as advertised. Woody, burnt oats, malt, raisins, barley, weak coffee, and just a little bit of smoke. I expected a stout with the name and look, but got a very good old ale instead."
"Drinkability: A well blended and very flavorful ale. I have heard much about his one and was glad to finally taste it. While I would equate the flavor profile more with a stout than an old ale, this is which I will revisit."
"D- Not an old ale in my book, but it is an enjoyable European beer. For the ABV, I was kind of surprised at home much of a sipper this was."
"Easily drinkable. I'm a fan of this beer."
"D- A very nice sipper for this cold night (even though I'm inside) but you get the idea."
"A thinnish black body with a well-carbonated one-finger head that slowly died and left little lace patches. An extreme coffee malt smell along with maybe some roasted and toffee malts and hints of cocoa. While thick and full-bodied this beer is real smooth and creamy. The taste is a mixture of unsweet cocoa and roasted malts with a slick and semi-dry backbite. Mild dark fruit and hop presence in this beer, but the malts are predominant. This is a musthave for any beer drinker."
"All in all, an awesome ale. If you can get your hands on one of these I would advise putting any hesitation aside."
"Poured jet black, name says it all. Had a nice tan head on it with some good carbonation. Nose of chocolate, toffee and tastes the same and perhaps some black liqourice. I have better Old Ales. Looks better than it tastes but still an ok brew. I am used to my Old Ales being a little stronger I suppose."
"Very drinkable although the $2.99 for 11.2 oz seems a bit high for this one. Overall, not bad and would pickup a few more if I find it for a dollar less."
"D: The complexity of this beer alone is enough to warrant a 5 but I just can't bring myself to do it, the mouthfeel needs to beer there more, its just not substantial enough for me. Other than that, anyone who has access to this beer and has never tried it should pick up a few bottles of this right now, it has tons to offer, go, go now, what are you waiting for."
"D - Nice offering. Like it."
"Drinkability is pretty good, a very tasty, full flavored old ale that is clearly in porter and stout territory. Harviestoun basically could have called this any of the three, and with the smokiness, could have even gone with Wee Heavy. Regardless, it's a damn good dark ale (which is actually all the label claims, ""Black Ale""). I like that it's so robust without being over the top ABV wise. Pretty nice price for this rarity to boot, $3.50."
"Poured an oily black color with a HUGE foamy and frothy mocha colored head. Looked like a Guinness pour at first with the gorogeous layers of bubbles sorting themselves out. The frothalicious head stuck around for quite awhile, very light and airey. Loads of lacing. The aroma is super malty with great hints of chocolate, roastiness and must. Awesome bitter chocolate, coffee and roasted grain flavor. Slightly fruity with a light hop bitterness. Not super heavy in feel but very very smooth and creamy to the tongue."
"D: I think I could drink quite a few of these. Very satisfying evening drink. It's not a session beer but it isn't intended to be. For me, it's a trip back in time. I am currently reading A History of Suds and Civilization from Mesopotamia to Microbreweries by Gregg Smith and I can just imagine being at an old Inn drinking one of these. Read the book - you'll get what I mean."
"D - While this is not a session beer, it is very rich and flavorful. As it says on the back of the bottle it would be good 'after dinner'."
"A tasty dark ale. I've seen this on the shelves forever & never tried it. No more. I'll be back frequently."
"If no Ola Dubh is available, go for this, especially as a chaser for your top shelf single malt of choice."
"Although carrying a sweetness that would align it with chocolate & coffee, the bitterness & char notes make me think smoked meats, salamis, and other charcuterie...."
"Mouthfeel was very smooth. Silky with low carbonation. The name of this beer really does reflect it's characteristics. Black, viscous, smooth, and socially lubricating."
"D: Quite drinkable."
"The taste is rich but zesty and also mellow and very smooth. It's similar to the aroma with light chocolate, fruit and stewed prunes, brown bread, toast, earthy leaves, a hitn of red wine and licorice. It's very nice and clean as well."
"Old Engine Oil pours a very DEEP brown color, one shade from black, some small slivers of reddish brown highlights. It sports a thick 2 finger mocha brown head with some sticking and very good head retention. Big nose of roasted malts, chocolate and toasted peanuts, black coffee notes and a slight metallic funk. While tasting, chocolate walks up and pummels your tongue, with its sweet semi-coating body, lots of good bright carbonation, a slightly warming and drying alcohol finish along with a gentle hop twang. Im trying to relate it to a definitive style i am familiar with, it strikes me as a cross between a dunkel lager/stout/porter hybrid, very unique and very tasty. Its got a light/medium body that gets a bit sticky at times but not offensive. Great beer from a great brewery."
"Seems a bit thin, lower carbonation. Lots of flavor. Probably the most complex 6% beer I can think of. Very nice."
"D - A little strong with the burnt and bitter flavors for my tastes, but still a very tasty and smooth beverage."
"Drinks a bit slow, due to the dryness. I do see this more as a stout, but most Brits would likely say this this is too strong for starters. Not a bad night cap, but prefer the reserve aked in whisky casks"
"Pours a dark black with hardly any head. Appears to be thick, syrupy, viscous. Aroma is dark malts with an emphasis on chocolate. Bitter dark chocolate. Taste mostly reflects the aroma. Mouthfeel is slick and oily with soft carbonation. Not a bad beer but I wasn't that impressed."
"Not much in the way of head, but awesome in color chestnutty brown highlights amidts an engine oil black to very dark brown. The aroma has a strong vine and roasted malt and coffee note. The taste starts wih some cheap coffee and hints of coca beans, very dry. These darker flavors mix with the viney nature ofthis beer in a very interesting melange. Although the av%is only 6%, this is a sipping beer. Not sessionable at all in my opinion. Pretty tart, but complexly malty."
"What can I say. It's rich with both chocolate and fruit flavors while being well-balanced and drinkable. This is a delicious beer, a must-try."
"D - enjoyable brew."
"Overall fairly complex and it tends to grow on you a bit as it warms. Still, I'm not crazy about this one, but I can see how so many are."
"Would drink again."
"I'll have another."
"Pours to a thin, dirty tan head and deep ruby black color. Aroma is chocolate, creamy malts, vanilla extract and sweet alcohol. Flavor is a perfect blend of Malt sweetness, caramel and vanilla and chocolate malts. Good thick mouthfeel. Very easy to drink for a dark ale--no tongue fatigue from lingering roast or hop bitterness. This is a very well made old ale that really drinks like a good cream stout."
"Interesting beer, but not what Iwould expect out of an Old Ale."
"Overall a rich, delicious ale that definitly leaves it's mark on your memory. Nice and complex, but still retains the ability to let you sit back and relax with a couple. A fine ale, and definitly something I will be buying more of."
"11.2oz bottle served in a snifter. Poured a deep brown/black with a finger of tan fine bubbled head. Not much in the aroma department, some chocolate and a little fruit. Roasted barley and some malty sweetness. Body was a little thin for a beer that calls itself engine oil. There are some hops in there, but most of the bitterness comes from roasted malt. Nice long finish."
"D - This is an interesting Old Ale. It's rather hoppy and reminds me of a good RIS."
"definitely syrupy and almost viscous. moderate carbonation for more body."
"Drinkability- I recommend an aged bottle, or reserve version as opposed to the tap incarnation."
"The drink settled with a very, very dark black color and a quickly evaporated head. Aromas were strongly woody wrapping, in general, mocha ingredients. The taste was perfect: very woody, malty and roasty. Just perfect. The mouthfeel was near perfect with an excellence in being a smooth, creamy drink but with a crisp carbonation. Overall, utterly awesome."
"Overall - Quite unique, but I'd usually prefer a regular English Porter."
"11.2oz. bottle: This one pours an opaque, dark brown color. There was a small tan head on it that dropped off quickly. Very little lacing. Some chocolate, coffee and roastiness to the nose. The taste is good. It borders on a full body. Taste is of chocolate malt, some coffee, dark fruits. A hint of bitterness in the finish. Very Nice!"
"D- Very drinkable for a thick, malty beer. I really loved the finish; it makes you want to keep sipping!"
"D: A great hearty drinking beer and must try."
"a Brooklyn Chocolate Stout. What I really mean is that I wish that stout had the same balance. I suppose the chocolate flavor has something to do with it. The ABV was good on the ""Old Engine"" and I enjoyed it very much."
"This was very interesting with a ton of different appealing flavors coming out. Unfortunately, they all seemed to crowd each other a bit, which I think kept things from really jumping out. Still, this would be a very good post dinner drink, especially paired up with something sweet."
"D: nice beer with a good smooth drinkability. very enjoyable and subtle. worth a try and great to marinate with as well."
"D - A nice beer indeed. Not something I'd drink all that often but worth trying."
"Kind of offensive green olive smell at first, then when it warmed up I got a little fruity sweetness, pours dark black and vicious in nature, small light brown head that fades and leaves a ring. Tastes of coffee and smoke, and leaves a dry chalky feel. Overall not to impressed."
"Taste is very bitter, almost sour. Roasted espresso and dark chocolate dominate the flavors, and the cherry noted in the aroma is noticeable towards the finish. Mouthfeel is a little thin in my opinion for something that is compared to ""gloopy car engine oil"" on the bottle but not bad by any means, although this lends itself to drinkability, which it is very drinkable. Reminds me more of a stout, but whatever it is, its good."
"1/2 a glass got poured down the sink. After reading other reviews I really can't see what all the fuss is about. I don't think I'll get it again."
"Tasted also with an 85% chocolate. Good pairing."
"D - Dark and mildly malty with a very strong roast character. Kind of reminiscent of a dry stout."
"I think this must be something special: the complexity of flavors and smells alone would garner this a very high rating in my review, but the flavors are mysterious and create the desire to keep on contemplating the contents."
"D, notes: Though the balance s clearly sweet the bitterness provides by the hops really makes this a unique and tasty beer with solid drinkability."
"This is a treat, and a great beer. Highly recommended."
""
"Served in my DFH snifter. Poured an opaque dark brown with some deep red-brown highlights around the edges. Quarter-inch off-white head dissipated within seconds, leaving an oily skim with copious ringlets clustered around the perimeter of the bowl. Only lacing present was the ring visible below the line of the brew after each sip. Scents of cocoa and dark fruit, but very subdued. Taste similar to nose with a malty backbone. Mouthfeel was somewhat watery. A little carbonation present, but not much. Not surprising considering the lack of a head. Went down easy, and flavors were fairly well-blended and complementary, but not what I would consider a go to brew."
"Drinkability high on this - it went down before I knew it was gone."
"drinkability is great. this is a rich brew with great flavors and solid profile, that does not carry a high alcoholic tag. smooth and mellow, with great complexity. excellent. cheers!"
"Pours a jet black with a medium sized flufffy white head that takes some time to settle and laces the glass nicely all the way down. It has an aroma of deep roasted malted barley, some chocolate, caramel, and a hint of hops at the end of the nose. The taste was really good with a deep roasted malt base with some chocolate, coffee, and caramel flavors mixed in as well. The aftertaste is really clean, just a nice chocolatey flavor left. The mouthfeel is creamy, velvety, and warming - very nice. The drinkability is good, especially since it doesn't have a very high alcohol content. It is a very interesting beer for an old ale and I really enjoyed it and it is most definately worth a try."
"Pours a charcoal black color with a nice 1/4 inch tan head. Dark roasted malts of chocolate, coffee and a wee bit of burnt flavors. Big and silky but not as viscous as I was hoping for. Slight bitterness on the tongue. Burned chocolate malts with some coffee notes. Light aftertaste. Would've liked to have seen a more layered taste profile. Don't get me wrong its still an excellent beer."
"12oz brown bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours an opaque black body with a thin film of tan head. Smells roasty and malty. Tastes very roasty with nutty and earthy hops toward the finish. Full rich mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Fairly drinkable, though definitely more of a sipper, which is to be expected for the style. A tasty solid ale."
"Disappointing."
"I am happy to see this again in Boise.. now I want to drink the Whisky Barrel Old Engine Oil I have in the basement side by side with this one. I remember the reserve having a bunch of whisky notes.. but I could see how they can add a bunch of complexity to an already great beer."
"Very Nice."
"Drinkability: Sits very lightly in the belly. Twelve ounces disappears too quickly. The beer offers a well-balanced flavor that leaves me wanting more."
"One of the most wonderful beers I've had. Pours nice and black into the glass, and has a delightful roasty-toasty aroma that lasts a long time. Tastes just a bit bitter with a roastiness that goes down very easy. You'll find plenty of tobacco notes as well. The adjectives on the label summarize this beer quite accurately."
"D: Sort of, but I don't know how many I'd have."
"Annother great beer to give to those who are afraid of the dark. Truly a fantastic beer."
"Very smooth mouthfeel but carbonation is a bit low. Really silky and tasty, very good beer."
"D - I could have a couple of these. All of the elements in this beer are great and are really balanced. Definitely give this a shot if you have a chance. Probably amazing on tap."
"Three words on the label sum this one up pretty well: viscous, chocolatey, roasty. I can add: delicious, complex, recommended."
"D: Off the proverbial hook. I could session these."
"A good beer for malt lovers. I could only imagine this being better on tap and a little fresher."
"This is an aptly named beer, since it really does look like old engine oil as it pours out thick and viscous into the glass. Not much of a head, but what little there is leaves a bit of lace down the sides. The smell is exceptional--malty and chocolately without being syrupy--and the taste is even better. Strongly chocolate with definite malt character, but the right amount of bitterness to keep it from being cloying or sweet. This is a very drinkable beer, especially on a cold snowy day. It's rich and delicious and I will be headed back to the LCBO to stock up before they run out."
"Very tasty, just short of 4.5. Drinkability is excellent, flavors full and reminiscent of bigger, higher ABV brews, so the 6% is appreciated. I'd have another of these for sure. Body is creamy, carbonation soft...it just needs a bit more heft to make it as viscous as it claims. Briefly sweet, before coffee roastiness takes over, sweet chocolate and fruit mingling with balancing floral bitterness in the finish."
"Good beer, get it."
"Definitely recommended..."
"D - Very drinkable. Overall, kind of light. I was expecting something thicker and heavier."
"Try it to believe it."
"After a couple of minutes its finally on to the taste. Lots of malty chocolate goodness, hop bitterness, dark fruits and earth. Very smooth and creamy. I can only hope we get this more often."
"This is a fantastic malt bomb of a beer. Very complex, yet nuanced and easy to drink. Another winner from this brewery."
"D: Very, very good. Is this sessionable? Hell yeah it is!"
"Aftertaste is slightly sweet english hops but drying and clean."
"The bottom line: Old Engine Oil is a tasty example of an Old Ale, and having it on the hand pull, and hence, also warmer from the start, undoubtedly enhanced my opinion of it. The beer is very low ABV for its style, but that just makes it more appropriate for drinking outside of the home."
"Pours an opaque dark brown, some red in the edges, super thick two finger tan head forms, refuses to leave, forms a very solid layer, nice lacing, looks great. Smell is sweet and malty, chocolate roast, bread, toffee, molasses and charred wood, some dark fruits, bit of raisin, enjoyable. Taste is nice, sweet malts, toffee, chocolate, like roast, bready, fruity, almost sherry in the finish, very smooth and a nice roast/graininess that underneath that holds it together. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, definition of smooth. Great low ABV beer, could drink these all night."
"I will immediately go pick up an armful of this stuff. Absolutely fantastic."
"Pours black with a mocha head that dissipates to leave a few wispy remnants on the surface. The aroma is very fruity, slightly bitter and dark. The flavour leads with a hit of fruit, before melting into caramel, dark chocolate and a slight coffee bitterness. The mix going on in this beer reminded me a little of Anchor Porter. The palate wasn't as I expected - the image of engine oil suggested a very thick, almost syrupy, liquid. Instead the body was medium-light, but with a creamy undertone that suits the beer well. Carbonation was practically non-existent, which I think is a good decision based on the flavours going on here. The lighter body and low carbonation made this a very easy drinker, and the glass was empty all too soon. I could easily have had another."
"This beer came as a bit of a pleasant surprise. It pours a very dark, thick black with some dark head that dissipates pretty quickly. The smell is roasted sweet malts, some hop character, perhaps a bit of coffee, and plum or other heavy fruit. The beer is surprisingly thin and very drinkable. The taste is bready, roasted malts, chocolate, cocoa, some hoppy bite in the finish, but overall very smooth. There are some fruit flavors discernible, there is also a bit of butterscotch in the body as well. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy and buttery leaving a coating of oil on the tongue. The beer is barely carbonated, and goes down very well. There is a bit of hopped up aftertaste, but overall it's quite mild. This beer is well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"I'd certainly have another."
"D: Great drinker. A bit high in the ABV for a seesion but a beer that I would have a couple of in a sitting."
"·	Drinkability: Near perfect old ale, I could sample one after another. Full of flavor yet easy to enjoy. You are urged to keep confirming how delicious it is."
"Pours a very dark brown with a nice quarter inch of head. Smell is malty and some cocoa. Taste is where a good amount of coffee shows up. There is a nice balance of coffee and chocolate. This is a easy drinker and goes down very easily. Well done."
"Quite similar to Colonial Porter, perhaps not quite as delicious but still an excellent beer. I will definitely be getting this again, as it is a very smooth, tasty, drinkable dark beer for Scotland to be proud of."
"D: Very smooth and rich with a decent ABV and nice finish. This is a very plesant and joyfilled old ale. I will seek this one out to include in my stash."
"Pours out a very dark ruby (nearly black) with a frothy tanned head that leaves very intricate lacing on the glass. Nose is fruity with anise and strains of roasted malts in the background. Flavor is terribly sweet with some heavy handed licorice flavor going on. Molasses, dried fruit, and chocolate are found in the underlying flavors. Roasted malts round out the finish. Finishes sweet. Mouthfeel is relaxed in carbonation, sticky in the body, and a little slick. This is OK drinkability-wise, but there is too much licorice. I think I like the whisky barrel-aged version a lot better."
"D: This is a nice beer from Scotland, a tasty little number that I'm sure I'll buy again, can't wait to taste the aged version, aged in whisky casks."
"D = A very drinkable beer in all respects. Excellent after dinner drink."
"Pours an almost opaque black with no head. Nose is like old tar from a tree. Just very earthy and resin like. Raisins. Slight touch of dried out wood that still holds a fragrance. Flavor is smooth. Definite raisins there. Nice aged woody flavor. Thick with character. Feel is good. Slight bubble, but an otherwise thicker texture over the tongue. Very drinkable. More of a sipper, but a nice aged old ale."
"Pours a nice little brown head and has a black color that you cannot see through. Head falls and leaves a almost no lacing behind. Smell is chocolatey great with some wonderful whiskey notes with some oaky smells. Taste is sour. Very sour, something is definetly wrong. Sour with some small flavors of roasted malts, but the dominant flavor is sour. There is some alcohol burn in the chest which is confusing for me considering it's a 6% beer. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, but acidic with bite. Overall, I wouldn't have another one immediatly, but would give another chance. Actually I can't finish the bottle I have."
"12 ounce bottle. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours pitch black with a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing is OK. Aroma is nice, it smells like roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and a bit of dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, however there's also some molasses and caramel along with a lingering bittersweet aftertaste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and smooth. Drinkability is good, it's easy to drink. With just a 6% ABV wouldn't be too hard to drink more than one. Overall I think this is a good beer, not a bad choice at all. I'll definitely buy this again."
"a good match for two"
"The beer is as dark as the name suggests. Smells of malts and some grape. It pours black. Thick head, good retention. Overwhelming roasted malts--not much of the chocolate taste that the bottle suggested. Mostly roasted malts and strong sens of alcohol. Not well balanced. My type of beer, but doesn't compete with the best in its class. Still it is unusual and bold. I give it points for that so, worth a try if you like the style of dark beers generally."
"Pours black with chocolate highlights covered with a slim, creamy beige head. Small spots of lace drip down the glass until the last sip. Malty chocolate aroma and a hint of rum...smooth milky creaminess, cherries, and maple syrup. Although the mouthfeel is insanely smooth and creamy, it isn't at all heavy. Sweet malty flavors, bitter chocolate, and a wine-like fruitiness. Very light carbonation and suprisingly drinkable finishing dry. Smooth, mellow, and malty...very nice on a lazy Friday afternoon off."
"D: Very drinkable for a beer with a 6.0% ABV"
"Served slightly chilled into a snifter, from an 11.2 ounce bottle. Poured a thick, oily, dark as night black, that not a bit of light could pass through. Beer was capped nicely with two fingers of creamy, dense tan head. Head faded somewhat quickly and left some spotty lace behind. Aromas of burnt coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malts filled my nose. Taste was quite a bit like the smell but a bit better. Somewhat coffee like with some chocolate riding shotgun with plenty of thick roasty/toasty malt flavors. Any alcohol is very well hidden, and finishes rather smooth. A nice full mouthfeel and great drinkability."
"Had on tap at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur, GA. As usual, poured in the appropriate glassware. Poured black with a bubbly head, some decent lacing and retention. The smell is malty with notes of licorice and blackstrap molasses. The taste is somewhat light- both for the style and for what both the appearance and nose suggest. Mostly detectable are dry malt and light noble hops, as well as a slight roastiness. None of the aroma notes make it into the flavor really. Smooth mouthfeel makes this an easy sipper, but there is not a lot of depth here."
"Poured into a chalice a dark brown color, nice carbonation, tiny fizzy tan head, some small islands and sticky lacing around the edges. The nose is malty, nice touch of coffee/toffee/caramel, slight roast/oak. The taste is big on malts and coffee/toffee/caramel, there is some slight roasty/oaky thing going on. For a 6% ABV brew, there is some warming effect goind down. Medium body. Very drinkable, this is a nice Old Ale, recommended."
"Wow! Pours great, an excellent pitch color that reminds me of a nice dark stout, along with the slightly tan head (although the head isn't as thick as a stout, nor the lacing as strong). It has a fantastic aroma, a great combination of chocolate, coffee, roasted barley, and even a bit of oakiness. It has a fantastic taste, a bit of coffee, a bit of roasted barley and oats, it's like some fantastic combination of a stout and a scotch ale, but with a nice slight hoppy bitterness at the end, as opposed to the usual maltiness of the other two. It goes down smoothly and is overall just wonderful."
"Drinkability: Good but nothing spectacular. Rather spend the money on a Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout in the same price range."
"D - If I had all night to spend at the Brick Store I could have done this one all night long..as it were it's now on my list of I want that one again"
"I had this after dinner, and while it was a decent post-meal beer, it didnt exactly knock my socks off. Im glad I tried it, but I wont feel the need to go out of my way for it again. There are better beers for less money out there."
"Finish is a little chalky and alcoholic."
"This beer is very dark in color and holds a chocolate head for a good amount of time. The smell is of deep roasted coffee beans with hints of chocolate lacing and almost a metallic luster. The taste is rich with malt and sweetness at first and finishes with a crisp but subtle bite at the end. The mouthfeel is smooth and thick but a little carbonated. The drinkability is decent for this type of beer."
"Tasting it at about 54 degrees; coffee is taken back a bit by some prune and date tastes. Chocolate appears towards the end. A bit sour. Nothing really stands out about this brew. A bit dry, adds to the bitterness making it slighlty tough to drink, but it does leave a nice taste."
"Overall, recommended. An interesting old ale, and an altogether tasty beer. I'm not sure it's a personal favorite, but I must admit it is well done."
"Coffee brown body topped by a small tan head that leaves just a smattering of lacing and almost no halo after its all too speedy descent. Only a bit of carbonation visible. Smell is watery but caramel and roast malt notes make it through. Taste is malt and roast, sour lactic, a bit of caramel and raisin, especially in the aftertaste. Thick and warming mouthfeel. Okay, nothing special."
"The bottle calls this ""a delicious after dinner beer"" and I couldn't agree more. A perfect beer to go with a nice cigar after an enjoyable meal. Unique and nothing like I expected. I will definately pick up again, even to share with company."
"This beer is black (as the name would imply) with a 1 finger rocky head. The aroma is strong of malt with some hints of spice. The taste is roasted, coffee, malty and bittersweet. The mouthfeel is full, but falls short of the chewy I was expecting from the name. I dont think Id put this in my car, but I would put it in me  and often!"
"Drinkability: Smooth and balanced, strong flavors, but enjoyable."
"Old Engine Oil was opaque black in color with a little ruby when held to a light. The light tan head was medium in size with decent retention and left some lacing behind. The aroma was loaded with dark malts, coffee, chocolate, caramel, and a little fruit. The taste was about the same as the aroma with some sweetness upfront followed by a balancing bitterness and long, dry finish. It was full bodied with good carbonation. Drinkability was good. This was a very good beer that I will have to try again."
"D- Not a bad beer, pretty enjoyable remarkably easy-drinking for as big as it first starts out as. Worth a try."
"Overall. There isnt anything about this beer that i absolutely love, but i do not find anything wrong with it. If i wanted to be a real stickler, i'd say the mouthfeel wasnt full enough, but this isnt a stout. I think this is a very solid beer that though i like others more that have a lower score i gave, i find this is a very well crafted beer that deserves much credit."
"My impression is that this beer is very porter-like which would probably explain why I enjoy this beer. Based on what I know of the style, it's very accurate and a fine specimen of a beer."
"The drinkability is excellent. Much better than you would think engine oil would taste. :^)"
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and a little on the creamy side, with a very smooth carbonation that only helps out in the drinkability department. I enjoyed this much more than I did the version aged in whiskey barrels."
"D - This is awesome. I can only fantasize about what this must be like on tap."
"Draft pour into a shaker glass. Very dark, nearly opaque. Light tan head. Smell & flavor are full of wonderful ""london porter"" or ""sweet stout"" type elements of toffee, dark fruit, and roasty/toasty malt flavors such as chocolate. Body is rich and smooth & pleasant. Quite easy to drink if you like sweeter/maltier dark ales."
"Pours very dark, almost black, with a dark tan small head that leaves a nice thin lace behind. Coffee and roasted flavors in the nose, also a bit earthy. Tastes is again a bit of coffee and chocolate with a mild bitterness to it. Feels smooth and full in the mouth without too much carbonation. Overall a nice dark beer that I do believe I'll have again."
"Medium bodied and very creamy with fine, pinpoint carbonation and a smooth, buttery texture. Drinkability of a session beer."
"This beer becomes exceptional once it crosses your lips. Very rich blend of flavors: starts with sweet cream, becomes cognac, and finishes with roasty chocolate malts. Yummo. Wonderful mouthfeel -- the minimal carbonation was fine considering the full body and the crisp finish. If I could find a place to pick up a case of this at a reasonable price, I'd be on it in a minute. Smooth and intensely flavorful. Harviestoun is a new reason to go to Scotland. Next: must hunt down the barrel-aged one again. I remember it having an amazing peat flavor that offset the sweetness."
"old ale? I don't know but here we go. Pours nearly pitch black, small brown head accompanies it. Smells a bit sweet with some soapy essence? Tastes a lot better though, caramel, cocoa, malty goodness and a slight hint of dryness in the finish. Overall it's a really nice beer. To me though this is like a really nice porter rather than an old ale in the way of flavor and appearence, but what the hey, if the Scots want to call it an old ale, an old ale it'll be."
"drinkability is great with this one. A very good beer that I will have again!"
"D: Somewhat leans toward an extreme, but if you were to be drink big malt brews all night, this one would kick you right back into the swing of things with its composition. The rarity of combining two malt beverages, beer and scotch, is what's charming about this beer. I see the appeal, and feel like this is a good one to break up any monotony with the malt-packed stouts."
"I would definitely get a pint again of this if I'm having a few that evening. Very drinkable!"
"d: appearances were deceiving here - not nearly as heavy as i would've thought & didn't get much whiskey flavor. too bitter for me, can't say i'll be picking up another of these"
"Poured a very dark color, not quite as dark as the engine oil reference in the name, but damn close. Light brown head but very small, laced nicely on the glass. Smelled of oats and coffee. Tasted just like the smell with a creamy stout flavor and held through the aftertaste very nicely. The aftertaste is by far the best part of this beer, I enjoyed the aftertaste. Holds on to your tongue. I will drink it again, but it's not an everyday beer."
"The drinkability is also good. I could down this a lot faster then I had planned for sure. Prosit MK"
"Notes: Decent."
"2002 vintage -11.2 oz. bottle - color of black , tan thin head - nose of prunes , leather , angave (tequila) , seaweed , rootbeer and malts  taste of portish , prunes , brown sugar , over ripe yellow apples and  body creamy slightly acidic and carbonated  aftertaste of apples and charred wood"
"Not sure what I expected here - thie was sold to me as 'almost a barleywine' by the barmaid. OK, so there was a good amount of aocohol, but.... I love the appearance, and it had a nice creamy head. Somewhat lacking in aroma though - I expected more, but then again, I'm not certain which style this beer would fall into. Quite drinkable, went down smooth, but I expected a tad more body. Oh, nad for the record $8.50 is an insane price for this in Massachusetts."
"Drinkability was quite good. For such a heavy and densely flavored beer this went down rather easily."
"Actually, with more than a bit of curiosity (and after having the scotch barrel version of this) i added a small dash of highland park 12 yo to the last 1/3 of this beer with pretty amazing results...the smoke aspect is no longer quasi-imagined"
"-Oelergud"
"D - Quite drinkable. There was nothing I particularly disliked about the beer, but I was under whelmed by the smell and taste."
"Creamy thick mouthfeel. Tasty!!!"
"D- bloody brilliant i think, i feel i would only want one though to sip and savour on a cold winters evening, a real winner in my book, will need to cellar some and re review next year, this beer is a real classic sipper!"
"Extremely tasty and slightly warming, this beer is pretty drinkable despite it's robust heaviness."
"Notes: A good beer all the way around. Solid smell, solid taste and solid mouthfeel."
"If it was still being brewed, I'd take Special Reserve over plain ol' Old Engine Oil every day and twice on Sunday. That doesn't mean, however, that this is anything less than a special ale that I'll buy in multiple bottle increments whenever I happen to run across it. OEO is the beer equivalent of comfort food and is giving me plenty of warm fuzzies as I pause over the final ounce. If that isn't a recommendation, then I don't know what is."
"Overall- A nice warming beer, the flavor dissappates in the end but nice on a cool evening."
"Big bubbly off white hea sits on a sludge like near black beer. The nose gives off some strong espresso, along with malt, and a nice chocolate roundness. The palate delivers a chocolate like bitterness, a little leather, burning wood. It has a decent moutfeel and a finish that lingers. A pretty straightforward beer, not terrible complex."
"Overall, a good beer with an unusual name that is slightly misleading."
"D: This is really, really excellent. In terms of dark beers with similar flavors, it's outstripped by Victory's Storm King and Stone's RIS, but that is heady competition with which to brook comparison. I will gladly seek out other Old Ales, but I'm willing to bet this benchmark will be hard to beat."
"D - Good. It looks almost as good as Guinness does (face it, Guinness is pretty despite its other flaws), smells incredible and tastes great. This beer is an easy one to drink. Seems strong than 6% though. Maybe I just haven't eaten enough tonight."
"Cheers!"
"Aroma was sweet coffee with a roasted/burnt smell. First taste on the palate is a quick sweetness with the alcohol faintly detected, then it gives way to a nice bitterness and then gets complex to the finish with flavors of chocolate, espresso and some tannins. A good froth heightens all the flavors mentioned. I have been aging this since March. I got my single at Gomer's in KC for about $1.99 I believe. Sweet enough to be quaffable with enough bitterness to be sipped as an after-dinner brew. Cheers!"
"A great beer! It was an opaque black with a thick, sticky, coffee-colored head. Aroma was sweet, dark cherry, a little chocolate. Wonderful taste: dark roasted coffee, chocolate, tiny bit of yeast. A very smooth beer. Not too high in ABV, so easily one to have a few of. My wife, who usually prefers wheat beers, liked this a lot."
"In trying to elicit a nice head from this ponderous ale, I pour directly down the center. My reward is a large bubbled, somewhat dark tan, one finger layer, which seems to hold its own at half its original size for quite a while. True to its name, I can't locate a speck of light seeping through this monster. Should I expect bits of crankshaft? This appears quite like a very big RIS. Thick tan suds ooze down the glass, as if over-encumbered. And yet, they still manage to leave some nice lacing. Odor is intense: dark cherries, molasses, caramel, espresso, chocolate. A wonder! Taste is of rich toffee, creamed coffee, sugar, and roast bitterness. There's also a slight acidity that goes with a lot of old ales. Alcohol seems to be present in its warming, spicy capacity. This is odd at only six percent, but very welcome. Low carbonation and a huge body, without doubt, lead to liquid luxury. This is a new favorite, and the alcohol content could easily allow a few in a sitting."
"Pours almost black with mahogany edges; very little head and slight lace despite a hard pour. Smells of alcoholic vanilla, oak, toasted chocolate malts, powdered cocoa. Flavor is not quite up to the aroma. Very sweet and rounded all the way through. Caramel and coffee malts predominate, with lots of powdered cocoa and burnt bread in the finish. Medium-light mouth feel, with good creaminess and gentle carbonation."
"Im not sure why Old Engine Oil is classified as an old ale and not a porter, but its tasty nevertheless. Nothing special in my book, but quite drinkable."
"Good mouthfeel, nice body on the tongue, Easy to drink despite its richness. Lovely after dinner drink."
"Pours an almost black color with slight dark ruby hues around the edges of the glass that produces a minimal tan colored head. The aroma is sweet and roasty with notes of dark malts and coffee. Mouthfeel is a bit too light for my preferenses. The taste is very smooth and well balanced. Overall a very nice brew that is plenty interesting and flavorful."
"I loved the Whiskey Barrel aged bottle I traded for, but this was nice too. A nice English Old ale that isn't that old but I could really see this progessing well with some oxidation adding flavors to an already flavor packed beer. I think I picked up a little maple syrup for a minute. I will have to get some to lay down for a few and see where they go. Nice stuff try a bottle, but not too cold."
"This beer pours an opaque black color that is not quite as engine oil like as its name would indicate, but is appealing nonetheless. The head is large, tan, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is more like a stout than an old ale as it is listed here on BA. Chocolate, cream, toffee, with a bit of hops in the background. The taste, however, is definitely more like an old ale than a stout. Chocolate, toffee and cream all remain present, but a nice bitterness cuts through them with ease. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice smoothness and carbonation. Overall, this is a nice old ale that I will revisit someday. It isn't as strong as others I have had, nor is it as unbalanced as most American interpretations of the style. It is certainly enjoyable though."
"Purchased as a single bottle at Bubbles on N Oak in Gladstone, MO. 11.2 oz bottle poured into an Imperial Pint glass. Dark mahogany brown/black. No light can come through. Bits of sediment suspend up against the glass. It doesn't swirl around, it's motionless like fruit in a Jell-O mold. Not a very big head, about a finger width. Very tight and sticky, the color of dark chocolate milk. Receeds to a thin lace. Smell is potent. I can smell the chocolate malt from about an arms length. There is also dried fruit notes. Taste is very complex. Chocolate, espresso, and earthy floral notes. Finishes pretty clean, very little aftertaste. Engine Oil is a good description of the mouthfeel. Very full bodied, creamy and smooth. Almost no carbonation. Good drinkability, though I wouldn't want to do more than one or two at a time."
"Very complex ale, that I found delicious."
"Overall: Not a bad brew; I guess I was thrown off by the packaging and price and expected a premium stout. I need to retry this later as the proper Old Ale that it is. Worth a try."
"Only disappointment was the for something called ""engine oil," the mouthfeel was a little thin and watery. Still smooth and coating (oily?), but not quite as molasses-like as I expected."
" Mouthfeel is a little thin for a stout but is uncommonly smooth and round throughout. Taste is malty and overloaded with coffee flavors that transform into a pleasant toasty aftertaste. Complex and delicious, I could drink these all night, apart from the abv of course."
"Not a bad beer but I think it could be much more. More carbonation would make it seem more lively. More body would fill it out some."
"Drinkability- The taste wasn't bad at all. Just knocked it down because I thought it really wasn't to style. Overall fairly tasty, but not as an Old Ale."
"I had expected more of a porter than a mild concerning the colour. I have heard a lot of good things of this beer. Surely it was good, but then"
"I poured this into a glass made just for this beer that was given to me complimentary in the beer store. When I poured it my first reaction was - This is aptly named! It is black with a thin head that lingers as a lace. The smell is of coffee with hints of a chocolate-like aroma. It is on the thick side, but not as much as it would have seem to have been by its name and appearance. Overall it was delicious enough to have if offered or easily attained, but not exceptional enough to go out of the way for. It's also on the pricey side."
"A fairly mild mannered old ale despite its appearance and moniker. Style aside this a tasty with admirable malt depth at least partially balanced by the hops that also exhibit some respectable complexity. A low-octane malty Scottish take on the style... and damne good one at that."
"Opaque brownish-black color, with a small, filmy light tan colored head. Rich malt and yeast aroma, producing gummy currant and raisins, light milk chocolate and salt. Chocolate silk caresses in a gentle way, with smoky soy sauce, toffee and a light hop bitterness on the finish. Very light, watery texture."
"Great name for a beer. Pours a virtually opaque deep, dark brown with a tan head from a brown bottle. Some vinous or fruity notes in aroma along with roasted malt and even some alcohol in the end. Definitely can taste some roasted malt, and is a bit estery in the middle. Not bad, worth a try."
"Dark pepsi brown with a small off-white/tan head of foam that dies quickly. Aromas of dark malts some chocolate, coffee, and a bit of the ole' roastiness. Hops are almost nonexistant. The taste is tight and roasty, very well balanced, with no boozy edge. A bit one dimensional and simplistic, but nice for what it is, I still prefer the reserve, but what are you gonna do? Mouthfeel is decent, but not as thick as you would expect given this beers chosen title. Drinkability remains nice as well...A good one."
"This beer poured with a small head. The color is very dark. Just a hint of light comes through. The smell is of roasted grains and a subdued sweetness. The taste is roasty up front and the finishes with a sharp off key flavor. The mouthfeel is also down a bit due to this lingering funk. The drinkability is fair. I could drink this again but it I don't it will be fine too. This beer has properties of an Dry Stout and Oatmeal Stout rolled together. Old Ale? More like a stout to me."
"This was a unique beer, grabbed at the Federal in Durham. Bragged as one of their newly acquired brews, I was anxious to try it. It poured a very dark brown/black with a small tan head and good lacing. Aromas of sweet malts, coffee, chocolate. Taste was much of the same, rather bitter but smooth. Also a very creamy and satisfying mouthfeel. Overall a nice sipping brew."
"Well I can't really say anything is bad about this beer but I don't really like it. An OK beer on all technical levels but it just doesn't come together for me."
"M&D: having tried some old ales, I think this one shows the most soothing and rounded texture by far, and the warming alc. seems to simply evaporate from the nectar?!... it's full-bodied yet ever so soothing, even, as its name suggest, a bit oily-lubricating in a sense. The mellow palate compensates for the lack of more robust and complex flavour upfront, but perhaps the beer, as it is, is at its most enjoyable as a good digestive. Very solid old ale to sip slowly~~"
"Another very good English / Scottish Old Ale, though they all start to taste the same after a while. Typical in it's heaviness, thickness, boldness, and sweetness. Atypical in it's amber-ish color and candied sweetness. Aromas and flavors of plumbs, raisons, prunes, dates, and figs with a root beer character and texture. Other sorgum-like sweetness and bit-eyness. Heavy and moderately thick to the mouth. Finishes sweet, bold, and lightly clean."
"D- This is a nice slightly sweet dark ale but it doesn't have the big flavors or alcohol I would expect from an old ale, although 6-9% is the typical ABV. I could drink this beer on a summer day just as easily as by a warm fire in the cold of winter."
"Old Engine Oil pours flat and almost black, with some lightening around the edges. The head quickly disappears and you are left with a very still beer. The nose is mostly coffee and toffee, with some dark fruit lingering in the background. The taste is incredibly rich and creamy -- the creamy sweetness reminded me of an egg creme at first -- with a bit of malt bitterness for balance. No hops to speak of. Mouthfeel is very still and creamy -- silky, really. Easy to drink... I imagine this would be great on cask. My first thought about this beer was that it would be an excellent accompaniment to a chocolate dessert. It might even work with something creamy, although that would cut the creaminess of the brew a bit, and without much carbonation I'm not sure if that would be a good thing. Anyway, something to try."
"This Ale pours a deep oily black that has highlights of purple when held to the light. Little lace is present and the head is absent except for a few clingy bubbles at the edge of the pint glass. The smell is clingy, malty, and grainy and becomes even more noticeable as it warms. The mouthfeel is medium to heavy and flat but slick feeling. This beer even though heavy has a great balance of malts with just enough hops to keep it flavorful. I really enjoyed this one. I will have to have another again."
"Very light malt and alcohol aroma. Caramel, dark malts, smooth creamy and sweet. Enjoyable brew. The mouthfeel was slightly oily on the tongue, leaving a sweet, but not cloying feeling. Not what I'd expect from an old ale. 6% was very drinkable and worth several."
" This is one I know I could drink a few of, but a bit heavy to be a session beer."
"Pours almost black. Long lasting tan head. Nice lace. Smell was on the light side, but was of malts and roasted coffee. Mouthfeel was not too light,not too thick. Taste was smooth and refreshing. malty, somewhat sweet start with a nice bite at the finish. Really good stuff!"
"Very tasty butt maybe just one!!"
"Nearly opaque mahogany colour with a thin, light brown head. Fine lacing covered the glass. Rich caramel and toffee aroma with raisin, figs and faint floral hops. Very malty with moderately high bitterness to bring things into balance. There's also a faint chocolate character that adds some complexity to the dried fruit (raisins, figs) flavour. Bitterness and caramel linger in the finish. Medium to full bodied with fine carbonation and an off-dry texture. A good old ale with plenty of malt character balanced by a surprising bitterness."
"Very dark brown in colour with medium carbonation. Porter-like aromas of dark baking chocolate and a touch of coffee. There is a very mild fruity flavor in this beer, like red grapes or cassis, that mixes well with the chocolate and coffee elements. Somewhat watery, but still very good. Reminds me a bit of a lighter bodied St. Ambroise Oatmeal stout. This one is more like a porter than the other Old Ales that I've sampled."
"In spite of how big I found this beer to taste i think its a pretty drinkable beer. I most certainly order it again."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Old Engine Oil pours out a not quite black color with a reddish tint. The head is small and fades quickly. The aroma is roasted coffee, molasses, and licorice. Flavor is rich and roasty, a little buttery, and sweet with caramel flavor. Some sweet cherry fruitiness. The finish is bitter, and it makes you forget how sweet this beer is. Medium mouthfeel. Not exactly motor oil, but tasty nonetheless. Very smooth and easy to drink. This is not what I think of as an Old Ale, but whatever it is I love it."
"I like old ales, and would enjoy this one again. Glad I picked it up...look forward to the aged Reserve!"
"Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color ale with a medium foamy brown head with minimal retention. Aroma of chocolate with roasted malt is easily identifiable. The roasted malt with some medium notes of chocolate and coffee also dominates taste. Overall, this is a very enjoyable beer from a style that Im having more and more of hard time to pin down."
"That this beer is aptly named is evidenced in the pour--dark as old engine oil with a reddish-amber tinge to it. Head is thin but nonetheless laces a bit. Smell is pleasant and surprisingly strong even when pretty well chilled. Nose has a smooth chocolate-toffee base and a hint of fruit that most closely invokes cherry. Question: Will it taste as smooth as it smells? Answer: Thankfully, yes. Sweet (though not cloyingly so) and smooth up front with some roasty bitterness quickly asserting itself and lingering nicely. The relative shortcoming is the mouthfeel, which seems watery when compared to the smell and taste."
"330 ml bottle, trade with maeib. Black colour, impenetrable for light. Moderate tan head. Looks like old engine oil, smells like old engine oil too - just add dark and roast malts, oak, leather, liquorice and dark bitter chocolate. Lovely roast malts flavour, oily texture. Elements of oak, dark bitter chocolate and substantial hops, maybe some dried fruits and English liquorice too. Great roasty bitter aftertaste with elements of peaty smoke. A great beer! Thanks, maeib!"
"This is really good stuff. Poured out to a pitch black color with low carbonation and a thin layer of foam. Some notes of lacing in the glass. Aromas of smoke, chocolate, coffee, caramel and earth blend well. Taste was very complex and inviting; flavors of coffee, roasted malts, nuts, grain and caramel whirl about in a sea of beer bliss. Some sweetness toward the finish. Aftertaste was slightly bitter and creamy. Mouthfeel was thick and heavy, like old heavy brewed coffee that was cold. Nice. This brews solid level of drinkability will bring me back in no time. Recommended."
"Mouth feel is medium bodied and a bit syrupy."
"Drinkability: There's not much to say about this beer. It's average and even boring for the style. Perhaps it took a hit on the journey across the ocean. I don't know. But I won't be having another one of these. It lacks any sort of complexity or depth."
"Old Engine Oil. What a great name. This beer pours with a dark brown with a frothy head. It that cappacino? There is lots of chocolates and caramels throughout. In the nose and flavor. Suprisingly, quite easy drinking. Nothing really bad to say about this. Good show."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich black malt scent that is dominated with chocolate aroma. The taste is good. It has a smooth and rich, chocolate flavor that goes down easy and finishes creamy with an earthy feel. The mouthfeel is awesome. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good drinking old ale. It has excellent flavor and aroma; a fine sessions ale."
"I get the feeling this is what an old ale is supposed to be. I haven't had many. This beer is fantastic. Highly recommended."
"An excellent brew - quite similar taste to Rogue Imperial Stout, though not as thick and heavy. Highly recommended...."
"This beer is darn good. A great after dinner snack or a nicht cap (the way I'm enjoying it). Nothing to complain about, and I even like the name. I just wish it were available more often here."
"The taste is of scotch, burned...well charred wood and just overall a strong malty character. This is a supurb beer that I enjoyed quite a bit. I don't think that I could drink all that many of them, but it's quite good. I took off for appearance because it didn't hold it's head for anything."
"Pours a pitch black (a little like motor oil) with a nice thick, frothy, creamy light tan-coloured head (not at all like motor oil). Leaves some nice bubbles and lacing down the glass. Aroma of unsweetened chocolate and caramel. Flavours of chocolate, caramel with some coffee hints and finishing off with a nice subdued roasted malt bitterness with some faint hops creeping through. Exceedingly pleasant indeed. Tastier than actual engine oil I should think. Quite smooth and silky mouthfeel for a bottled ale with just the absolute minimum of carbonation. This is a nice and drinkable old ale from the good people at Harviestoun. All their regular brews are solid beers and this is no exception. The only downside is it's awfully hard to find in Glasgow (until Sainsbury's brought it in for a festival) and impossible to find in Ontario. If you do see it, buy it. You will not be disappointed."
"A highly drinkable beer. HOWEVER... to really put it in context, and for another level of taste experience, you have to also have tried the special reserve aged in whisky barrels."
"Murky brown with a tiny bit of foam. Appearance gets a kicked a notch up though for long lasting head and nice lacing. Smell jumped out at me immediately after pouring. Strong roasted malt notes dominate with some dark fruit in the background. On first taste, the roastiness reigns supreme and the fruit is there backing it up. Caramel tastes as well. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation to keep things moving. Lots of bitter dark chocolate on the aftertaste, and the hop bitterness is actually pretty strong. This is my first Scottish Old Ale and it's exceptional! Drinkability is outstanding."
"Pours opaque and low carbonation, produces a minimal head, and low lacing. Aroma is slightly fruity, but also restrained. Taste is grainy, chocolately, smooth. Just a bit of hops in the finish. Nicely done, thick enough and interesting to keep my interest."
"Still available in Muncie, IN, at the Heorot for at least another week on cask...get there if you're nearby."
"Other comments: Reminded me of an ""Adambier"" at first (like Hair of the Dog - Adam that hasn't gone sour). It's like a concentrated dry stout. I gave it a 2.5 for drinkability because it is so rich and bitter that I could definitely only have one of them in a sitting. Might be interesting to age a few of them."
"This is lighter than a typical stout (I know, I know, its an old ale), carbonation is perfect, in my opinion for this brew. Very smooth and very drinkable, especially for such a complex (if relatively subtle) ale. This would be dangerous if it weren't for the price!"
"Smooth mouthfeel that makes for a very drinkable brew."
"Overall, a very thought provoking and enjoyable beer."
"It's good, but there are other stouts I'd rather have. This is an Old Ale? Sure tastes like your basic straightforward stout to me."
"The color is pitch black with a creamy tan head. Not much retention except for bubbles around the insides of my pint glass. The aroma is chocolaty with a touch of roasted smell. The taste is insanely rich. Sweet chocolate flavor is inhanced by light roasted taste, peat flavor, and just a little herbal hop. Old Engine Oil has a great depth of complexity and is incredably smooth. Only 6% ABV makes this even easier to drink. Highly recommended."
"It has a medium smooth body with fine carbonation filling the mouth. A really nice old ale, with mucho emphasis on the malt and yeast."
"A hoppy barley wine. Taste like a dry grainy lighter barley wine. Beautiful fruity aroma like fruity good wine. Some roasted malt and chocolate throughout. Dark colour and initial malty head. Not too sweet. Fruit on aftertaste. Smooth, would be fine with this all night."
"A fantastic beer, full of flavour, something to savour"
"Good finisher too. No alcohol burn, just a nice warming. I couldn't drink this one after another as it is kinda of heavy. But, I can see having 3 or 4 per session."
"Old Engine Oild was worth the try but at 4.95 a bottle I will not be trying this again until I hear of a good future vintage."
"This beer is pretty dark, but not real dark or oily as the name might suggest. It had very little head, very little smell, and not much flavor. The mouthfeel is weak and watery. I have a feeling they were trying to make a porter and fell way short. Maybe I'm not familiar enough with the Old Ale style, but this just isn't that good. At $2.49 a bottle and a name like engine oil I was expecting a lot more."
"I wouldn't seek it out again, but it's got a cool name."
"This seems more like a strong stout than an Old Ale to me. As such, it's quite a good example."
"good fluffy rocky tan mocha colored head with a dark brown clear color. yeasty bready aroma, very balanced and smooth aroma. caramelized sugary taste with a bready malty chocolatly bit too it. seems a bit weaker than I remeber, not sure if it handles better in the bottle or the if the keg was here too long. still I didn't have a problem knocking off a growler by myself for new years."
"The taste of the beer however was just ok. It didn't blow me away. The worst part of it was in fact its aftertaste. Once I was half way through, I was actually glad that I only had 1/2 bottle left as the aftertaste left a mildly stale taste in my mouth. Overall, Engine Oil wasn't terrible, but if I was going to spend 4 bucks for a bottled porter brew, I would look elsewhere."
"pours very dark, almost black. the head was creamy tan but small and dissipated rather quickly. there is some light lacing as well. smell is of malt, chocolate, and maybe hops. the hops definitely come through on the taste, it's somewhat bitter with a hint of chocolate and malt. the mouthfeel is pretty good but not the best. drinkability: i'd take it if i had it, but i'm not sad that i don't. definitely not bad, but at the same time it's nothing special."
"Smooth and creamy start with a long chocolate finish. Carbonation levels seemd light but were right for this style. A very drinkable brew that leaves you wanting more after the glass is empty."
"This one went down like candy."
"poured true to its name with deep ruby around the edges, with a small light brown head thast didnt last long. aromasweet dark chocolate, toffee, caramel, roasted malts, oatmeal, and a nice sweetness. flavor was a little disappointed I was hoping that the aroma would carry over into the flavor all flavors were weak, chalky some bitterness"
"A very dark brown almost black beer with a small but very nice creamy beige head the doesn't evaporate right away. The aroma is a strong roasted malt aroma that I swear has an engine oil characteristic to it. Ther flavor is a robust roasted malt with marvelous highlights of bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Very enjoyable to sit and savor."
"Very dark, brown. Tan 2cm head recedes to a lasting cover. Rich malty aroma with interesting notes of tar, licorice, vegetal oil, chocolate and tobacco. It indeed has quite a distinctive cigar suggestion in the petiness. Earthy licorice, soy sauce. Pretty good if those are your kind of flavors. Very dry from the beginning until the end too. Light tartness doesnt disturb too much. Medium body, low carbonation. More smoke or meatiness and this was a killer. The name is actually a nice fit."
"Drinkability: Very different and a nice change of pace when you have time to sit and contemplate its flavors"
"Deep black in color-nice slight tan head that lingers down the glass.Subtle aroma of malt.Slight chocolate smell.Roasted flavor dominates.Hints of licorice.Very subtle sourness in the backround.Full bodied mouthfeel.A very drinkable beer-comes off more as a stout then old ale to me.Very enjoyable none the less."
"A jet-black brew that forms a sizeable and lasting head, Harviestoun's Old Engine Oil is a pleasant find ? but not something that I look to consume regularly. The sour hop aroma mingles with some chocolate notes. The flavors are more complex, but not exactly balanced between hop bitterness, burnt malt flavors, with little chocolate or other malt sweetness. As an Old Ale, this well bodied beer tastes a bit like a porter."
"Blacker than black, thick dark tan head that stuck. Heavy chocolate, malts, coffee, and almonds on the nose. I can't possibly give this beer proper credit, I loved it in the bottle long ago, I like it even better now that I've found it locally on tap. The near perfect consistency/density feels great, meal-ish. The tastes are all moderate to strong, doesn't leave a dull moment on the tongue. Moving from sweet maltiness and baker's chocolate to a very very slight tart sensation on the finish."
"Pours a near opaque brown with a pillowy dark tan head. Smells are off chocolate, prunes, brandy and raisin candy. Taste is a bit sweeter than the smell.. Chocolate covered raisins dipped in scotch. A bit of milk anise sweetness thrown in the maltyness. A good overall stout.. Very easy to drink.. Drinkability is a bit lower due to the bit of sweetness and such. Definatily a one off beer. Not to say I would not get another because i would, but i would only want one in an evening."
"Overall this is a pleasant and complex beer that I would enjoy with chocolate or alone after dinner."
"One of the best old ales I've had, if you can get it, try it."
"11.2 oz bottle pours an opaque, deep brown into a glass. I've seen other ales that look more like motor oil on the pour, but this this one has a fine, tan head that lasts forever, and leaves sheets of lacing down the glass. Aroma is a wonderful blend of campfire smoke, molasses, figs, chocolate, coriander, and some dark fruits. Quite impressive on the nose! Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. This is a full bodied Scottish ale, with a taste that resembles the nose, but is even more complex. Raisins, burnt coffee, and leather emerge in the taste and it all comes together nicely with some bittering hops. A hint of licorice is also noted. This is, certainly, the best Scottish old ale that I've been blessed to sample. Very highly recommended!"
"The first sip reveals, a creamy thick body and average carbonation. Flavor starts with a fairly sweet twang and succumbs to chocolate and roasted malt flavors. Finish is long lasting and leaves a silky feel on my teeth, almost like hot chocolate. This is a very tasty brew that improves as it warms, I should have just had this at room temp."
"This beer had the loveliest head on any that I have poured so far. It was brown, thick, and lively with bubbles ranging from very minute to absolutely gigantic. The head was also very chewy with a taste reminiscent of bitter dark chocolate. The body was dense, mahogany brown with red highlights when held up against the light. The aroma was a mix of coffee, chocolate, wood smoke and resin. It was so good; I just smelled it for a while. The taste was wonderfully complex yet fully blended. I could detect raisin skins, licorice, butterscotch, and of course mocha. Velvetty smooth and rich, and oily (as expected) in mouthfeel. A very satisfying and fulfilling beer that is highly recommended."
"What a dark, nearly completely black beer. Its appearance is spectacular.thick liquid with a long-lasting, magnificent, brownish-tan head. Its really something. The aroma is a pleasant mix of roasted grains and malts. Theres a lot of complexity in the aroma.many hard to place smells.leather, over-ripe fruit, alcohols, multifaceted malts, etc. Its certainly interesting. The taste has a distinct and distracting acidic astringency. At times it seems to border on sourits like lactic acid with the power of a food ingredient citric acid. Not sure if it's a flaw, age, or intentional. Regardless, it's distracting, although not unpleasant. The front is certainly sweet and theres malt and hops there, but I have a hard time fighting the acid twang. Hops and syrupy malt mix in the finishwhich is fairly sweet. Fun, different, and challenging. Id be up for another of these."
"Quite an interesting beer. Appereance is well..almost like oil. Well not quite. It's more black with some hints of light brown. Almost looks like a stout or porter. Perfect amount of carbanation. Smell consists of sweet coffee with a little wood/smoky smell even. Taste is outstanding. A nice full body, creamy that mixes with a little bitterness. Perfect combo. molasses? Wow really nice. I could drink this all day. Got a bottle for $2.35. Can't go wrong, good beer for a good price. I would recommend this beer."
"11.2 ounce bottle."
"Poured dark brown with a nice creamy light head. First taste is great with a beautiful balance of malt, coffee and chocolate flavors in a creamy rich body. Easily drinkable like an excellent porter with lingering flavors that make you want more and more. A bit pricey at $4.50- got it at the corti bros. Market in Sacramento."
"Overall: Harviestoun are one of my favorite Scottish Brewers, they make some excellent Cask-Conditioned beers, but I rarely see, let alone try, their bottled offerings. Its my mission to get some more of this, and the Whisky Barrel aged version if possible."
"Drinkability - billed as an after dinner beer - I'd leave it there, one, maybe two. The combined boldenss of both the hops and the malts almost make it just too overwhelming. It's still a well-crafted beer, but I would choose something like Sam Smith's stout instead."
"Dark fudge brown color with deep ruby highlights and slivers of light brown at the bottom, very thin tan head that fades to a thin ring the whole glass through, lace in spots and globby strings. Aroma is sweetly roasty and deep with some light chocolate, molasses, and coffee mixing in; a nice soft nose. Taste is quite roasty with an old coffee-like flavor, some semi sweetness with a light bittering tang that holds for a good time and into the finish. The roastyness is nice but mostly mild and subdued in its presence. Good clean mouthfeel thats close to medium body and lightly creamy nearer the finish with a short lived little chocolatey tang and roasted dryness lingering in the finish, a nice touch. A fairly nice brew, I can see have'n alot of these, a good session brew for sure."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it avoids being watery. It doesn't quite coat the mouth like a stout might, but it sure isn't lager. Highly, dangerously, drinkable. The ABV at 6% is big but not huge, enough to feel. Generally, this is a delightful change from my recent fare of McEwans' and Caledonian's finest. Certainly worth grabbing if you see one, if nothing else than for an opaque Scottish ale. Brilliant."
"Taste: bitter hops tango with sweet malt in such a fashion that you get a little almost treacly sweetness, step 2, bitter tang, step 3, mild and mellow, repeat, cha, cha, cha. Possesses a far lighter mouthfeel than I'd expected, though still full in body, with dark, rich, and continually tasty flavor. Doesn't hang too heavily on the palate, making for higher drinkability and greater sophistication. This is listed as a Stong/Old Ale, but it contains a mere 6% ABV, and feels a bit stoutish at times. No matter what it's called, a fine ale all around, though, I wonder if it is based on an old Celtic recipe, as the label states, what did they call it before Henry Ford came along?"
"I've had this serveral times, also the cask. This was the regular version, on tap at Redbones. Pours dark as night, looks like engine oil in the glass. I find the aroma to have roasted and fruity notes. The taste was slightly sweet, with a bit of a tart finish. Would have more of these, but that abv is a bit of a warning. I think I like the cask version better, this one is not as smooth. Still pretty darn good though. I will always order one of these if I see it on. pat"
"A smooth flavor profile despite its fairly rugged stylings, it had a smooth mouthfeel with a tiny bit of texture. Fits the character of the beer well, which I would call a tougher brother of Old Peculier."
"I found this beer to improve greatly as it was allowed to warm up a bit. Pours a nice thick looking opaque black (much as the name suggests that it should), with a thin light brown head. Strong aroma of coffee and chocolate, with some unpleasant astringent acidity as well. Initially finished with an unpleasant bitterness--although this was smoothed out greatly as the beer was allowed to warm, and the chocolate and plum flavors were allowed to come out. Not a bad beer, but not anything special and probably not a beer I'll look for in the future."
"While this old engine oil would reek havoc on your car's engine it would certainly help lube up yours and keep it running smoothly for the next 15 minutes or .01 miles when you reach your recommended level for your next ""oil change!"""
"Drinkability: This beer is delicious, I'll be returning to this one often and trying to better describe how good it really is...."
"Drinkability  Wonderful to drink at any time and in any season."
"I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable beer. Quite easy to drink. Don't let the name fool you."
"Dark brown with some ruby highlights. Medium tan head, 1/2 an inch of stiff foam. Widely spaced fat laces. Chocolate covered carmamel aromas. Thick and deep malt impression comes on immediately, densely chocolate and viscous in mouthfeel. Smooth, with lots of aftertaste, hop bittering is just adequate, not much but a balancing act. A little too sweet and unidimensional in quality, but a good beer to have when you want a diverse arsenal at your disposal."
"With a name like this, one would almost expect the beer to pour with a ""glug, glug, glug"" factor. To the contrary, the body of this beer seemed a bit thin and oily for the flavor profile. Chocolate malt predominated, with nicely roasted flavors that were not overdone. The beer describes itself as being a good dessert beer, but I did not think it was sweet enough or had enough body to carry out that mission. Nice, but overall did not have the ""umph"" it seemed to need."
"Flavor: It's a bit malty with some alcohol bite, but not too much. THis is extremely drinkable. I can imagine sitting back and having a few of these"
"Pretty aptly named, appearance-wise. Deep, reddish brown. Dark. Very thin head becomes a long-lasting film. Strangely bittersweet to the nose -- chocolate and herbal hops. Kind of a bittersweet coccoa to it. Uniquely put together flavor profile as well. Coffee-ish -- almost stout like -- with fruits, oak, and hops. Fairly potent, bitter finish. Clean. Very drinkable and very intersting -- always a good combo."
"Charcoaly brown in colour, looks really nice. Pretty nice stuff tastewise. Soft medium bodied, light carbonation. Flavours of chocolate caramel, with some late salt, peat and citric hops. Bitter-ish finish, and relatively dry. Nice soft texture. Ever so slightly roasted finish."
"True to its name sake, this beer pours almost a solid black. Itd definitely reminiscent of old engine oil thats gone far, far too long between changes. When held up to the light, some garnet highlights could be seen. Very little tan head that becomes a small lace. Very malty aroma with caramel and chocolate malts sharing the stage. Very rich, creamy brew with lots of caramel and chocolate on the palette and slight roasted notes. Not much hops to speak of except at the finish were the hop bitterness comes through for a moment but give way again to the malt. Bit of a lingering roastiness and sweet malt. Mouthfeel is quite smooth, medium to full body with low carbonation. This is the first old ale that Ive had. Had I not known it, I would have thought it to be a porter or stout. Either way, its a great brew that I found quite difficult to keep from drinking too quickly."
"Pours dark with a creamy head. It appears a dark red when held up to the light. I can definitely smell a bit of chocolate. The chocolate continues in the taste with the accompaniment of hops. With the light carbonation it finishes with a bit of fruit and slight slight burnt taste."
"Hot stuff. Very similar to Old Peculier."
"Now this is indeed a marvelous brew. Pours about as dark as Coca-Cola with about a centimetre thick head. Laces the glass quite nicely and has a wonderful smell.(If you enjoy stouts and darks and such.) The taste is wonderful! A robust maltiness with an almost chocolate finish. I personally love this in a brew. The mouth feel is quite unique in that it almost feels like there is more carbonation present than there actually is. It almost ""stings"" one's mouth similarly to soda. If strong darks are your preference, the drinkability of this one is most definately 4.0. I will most certainly be purchasing this one again."
"Eclipse black color. Small head. Aroma is malty and peaty. A medium bodied Scottish ale. Complex malt flavors, chocolate, smoke, caramel and cherries It is a little sweet tasting, but it is balanced by the hoppyness. Nice smooth taste. Mild flavor. A nice beer for after dinner sipping. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, with a sweet finish."
"This beer pours a very dark color with a small tan head and little lacing on the glass. The aroma was a little hard to figure out, but malts were detectable. The body was really full and thick. I didn't find the flavor very pleasing, but it is interesting."
"Well why not try to buy this in Scotland?? a Scotsman will look at you like you have green ears, they have never heard of the stuff. It must be for export only, found in York, England for £1.49. Looks like a stout or porter totally black, tastes like a sweet stout, very smooth, very drinkable; too bad it was only 330ml."
"Certainly a beer that I will have again."
"I must say I had never heard of this until now,pours a deep brown with some nice ruby hues with a great creamy head that sticks very well.The aroma is a little caramelly and dry.A taste of unsweetened chocolate and some fruity notes with a slight dry finish.Very impressed with this beer."
"Old Engine Oil is certainly an accurate word to describe this dark beer's appearance. Poured a nice fluffy head of large off-white bubbles in my stemmed tulip glass. Nice lacing sticking to the glass throughout the beer. Smells of sweet chocolate and coffee malts dominate the aroma. Mouthfeel is velvet refined. Tastes sweet at first then slides into a gradient of wonderful bitter flavors--fruits(plums, grapes), Hops, Dark chocolate, espresso. All these flavors linger on the palate. This beer is best at cellar temerature, but start with it cold and sip it slow to get the full perspective of this beer."
"Nice beer, more of a porter flavor. Nice chocolate notes, good balance. Ordinary in appearance, but a real nice taste and mouthfeel. Substantial and a little different. Could pass for a good stout. I'll definitely revisit this beer. Thanks to the man in Osprey for the sample!"
"A very nice dark heavy ale that is smooth and creamy, dark and lacey. Superb malt sense in the nose and taste. Thick, creamy tan head and super lace down the glass. Chocolate and coffee notes are a free ride along with the nice malty flavor. A good black-as-night beer that has great opacity."
"The flavor is gratifying. Plush, milky cocoa expands across the palate and enforces a bitter bitterness of cocoa to cleanse the blueberry and cream sweetness of the attack. Subtle enough. Crafty, agile flavor. It wears well."
"Pours a nice dark, well, old engine oil color. Smell is very malty. Dark and mysterious. The taste is very light on the bitterness of roasted malts, and very heavy on residual malt flavor. A bit of hops on the finish, but not overpowering in the least. The mouthfeel is thick but not coating. Dunno about drinkability; it's not alcohol strong, but it's still just a sipper."
"This pours with a firm and creamy rocky tan head settling over nearly black liquid. The nose is wonderfully full of chocolates, some coffee & roasty maltiness, very light notes of dark fruit too. Taste is more of the above only with a refreshing slight tanginess added that enhances the enjoyability of this beer. Finishes up nice and chocolatey with a touch of hop bitterness...eminently drinkable and totally delicious!"
"Wow...this is great. Dark brown, nearly black with a light brown head. The head is small and drops quickly, but leaves a thin layer of frothy bubbles floating on top of the beer. The smell is faint, but hints of coffee and chocolate are definitely there. The flavor is big. It hits your tongue quick and hard, and it's great. It's full of hop bitterness, coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. The hops linger in the mouth. Carbonation is a bit heavy, but the mouthfeel is still smooth. The feel and flavor are well-balanced. Need to get more of this stuff."
"A beautiful, dark, dark, dark, dark beer with a lovely thick head which rests about a 1/2 inch on top. Roasted malts and oh, the chocolate play up the smell of this brew, yummy. Man, this oil is smooth, maybe I'll put some thick in the lawnmower. Quite smooth, light texture for being so dark. Chocolate dominates the flavor initially, with roasted coffee flavor coming through as well as the presence of hops in the end. The beer rested heavy in my stomach which takes away from the drinkability. Good stuff though."
"The flavor is very robust. A nice full body with a rich creamy feel to it. A good chocolate taste leads the way with a nice roasty character following closely behind. Sweet malts jump in next to mix things up a bit. The end has a bit of hops to round out the complexity of the beer. Aftertaste is all roasty. Very nice to drink, and it could be something that you could have a few of. 11.2 ounces seems to go a bit quick, and I would like to have another."
"Wow. It really looks like engine oil. So thick, practically no head. But it looks very inviting, though. Rich, thick taste that rounds out very nicely. Thick feeling, too, but it has a delicious aftertaste. The aftertaste sticks around for a long time, making you want more of the real taste. I could have a few of these in a sitting."
"This Stout/Porter hybrid is an unusual as its name. Mahogany colored with a thick, full, peaty and chocolaty malt. An aroma of faint chocolate, dry malt, alcohol and hops. High in English tea-like and mildly citrus hops. It's earthy, yet sweet and creamy. The white/beige head fades leaving behind a thin trace of lace. A truly unique brew! Noticeable alcohol. A must try!"
"Next, we move on to old anitfreeze..."
"I was very interested intrying this beer and a chance meeting with a bottle of it afforded me the oppurtunity to do so. Who wouldn't be curious with a beer that people may mistake for something that you put in your car engine? It poured out of the bottle like mud and kind of rested in the pint. It smelled dark and bitter with notes of prune and fig. The taste was probably the closest I may come to drinking real oil. It was sludgey and viscous. Cool beer."
"True to its name, this stuff pours thick and black out of the classic long-necked bottle. Its developed a fine, chocolate tan foam that receeded slowly. The lace was sticky. Old Engine Oil has a deep, rather prune-like smell (my wife said she was reminded of figs), and the taste is smooth and fruity with very little carbonation. I thought this a worthy brew, but not very complex, and not among the top I've had recently."
"I find this very easy to drink..but the label on the back of the bottle says its a good after dinner drink..and i suppose it is since i just ate my dinner."
"Pours a very dark red brown with a moderate lasting tan head. A syrupy malty raisin smell. The taste was toasted bread with a peppery bitter finish and a very slightly oily mouthfeel. A tasty beer that definitely tastes even better when at warmer temperatures. It really seemed more like a porter than an old ale."
"Very dark brown in color with some chunky sediement, and a light tan thinnish head. Aroma is lovely and inviting: chocolate and molasses combine with a roasty malt scent and blend into a rather port-like alcohol nose. Flavor is chocolate/ caramel sweet up front, with a light hint of cherry, a bit of alcohol warming mid-palate. Medium-bitter hop finish fades gently into the background, yielding to a a pleasant, roasty sweet aftertaste. Sooth, creamy, and rather full bodied. A nice treat!"
"Dark with a tinge of purple, good head. Aroma of Scottish malts, quite grassy and just a hint of smokiness. A surprisingly friendly beer, despite name and appearance. Smooth malts are not caramel sweet but more roasty and toasty, with mild hint of coffee. Some slight fruitiness gives this beer distinction; a very ripe flavor, kind of like a mild although the alcohol kick can't be denied. This beer evokes, for me, images of cloth caps, wood paneled walls and my grandfather's immense library of antique books. Hoppiness is very herbal, gives the palate a quick jab towards the finish. There is a lasting and lustrous finish that is wonderfully nourishing. Mouthfeel smooth, like oil, if not as thick and sticky as that simile suggests. This beer is labeled a number of things: old ale, strong ale, barley wine, porter; but to me the malts are indelibly characteristic of a Scottish ale. A unique and enjoyable beer that I will be buying lots of, if only I could find it priced less than $2.78 for 11.2 oz bottle."
"(source: RealBeer Tour)"
"It poured a very dark brown, almost black, with medium brown foam and medium head that dissapated fast, but leaving a nice lace on the glass. The smell was of a very sweet malty aroma, with chocolate and caramel to start. The taste was lacking the malty, chocolate and caramel that was in the aroma. I am very dissapointed in the finish of this beer. The sweet/bitterness is not what I expected. I just wished that it tasted the same as the aroma it gave out to start with."
"The pour, is the color of old ""Engine Oil", the head prodigious, the lace thick clinging sheets upon the glass. The nose is malt, sweet, caramel with a light hint of coffee. Front is sweet, the top skimpy, the finish is mildly acidic, pertinently hopped, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste. Personally I find it quite tasty and well worth a sample for a change of pace"
"A disappointment to me after much anticipation..."
"This beer poured a very dark ruby amber color and formed a bubbly light tan head that left some circular lace as it subsided.  Some sediment present.  An aroma of malt and molasses with a touch of caramel.  A flavor of malt and caramel.  A fairly light body for this style.  A slightly astrigent finish."
"Too easy just to suck down."
"It certainly has the look of old engine oil - extremely dark, almost black with just a hint of ruby red noticeable when viewed against a light.  Not as thick as I expected.  Decent head, but rather short lived.  Nice aroma of creamy, mellow chocolate and fruit.  Taste is smooth - very chocolatey with a nice roasted caramel malt character.  A bit of tart fruitiness - plum, I think - rests just under the chocolate.  Smooth and creamy beer.  Overall, a great treat."
"This does make a great desert beer.It also makes one hell of a breakfast beer.That's right! Before there was coffee,there was ale.I like to drink this at the same temp I would drink a porter.I find by not chilling it,that it wakes this mellow beast up a bit more.It really does look like old engine oil (not sludge, just slightly used).Great aroma with fruits, caramel and licorice.These same items vocalize themselves in the flavor as well.Fluffy mouthfeel with a smooth,hoppy finish and a hint of chocolate.Great warming characteristics going down and breathing out.My only complaint would be the max of 2-3 in a sitting."
"A special selection on tap at Redbones BBQ. Deep dark brown or black color, depending on the light. Slight ruby hints along the edges. Creamy light brown head, laced down the glass. Smell was a serious combination of sweet roasted fruit, sublte chocolate and carmel malt, and toffee. Taste was truly unique, roasted plums, raisins, subtle chocolate, and coffee bitterness finish it up. Finish lingers, but how can it not, with everything going on. Thick, full feel,yet slippery,  I could have only one of these at a time, especially with all the food they give you at Redbones. I thought it was a stout as I drank it, later learned it's an old ale. Very interesting, orginal, and memorable beer. Great name too."
"Note: The second pint I had a month or two later did not exhibit the apricot flavor that was there the first time, but every other flavor note remained. Odd."
"Possibly one of the most distinctive beers I've ever had. The color is deep ruby, but not black (although it almost appears that way in the glass). It's topped by a short but creamy light tan head that displays good head retention and leaves some spotty lace. The aroma is intense; full of toffee, dark fruit, roasted malts and light candy. The dark caramel flavor doesn't quite follow suit, but offers a very creamy, round, and full mouthfeel - but not as big as might be indicated by the name! Hops are present and well integrated. A very drinkable beer, full of great character but not overwhelming; although I'm not sure I'd want to drink too many of these in a row!?! Definitely a Scottish-style ale, but also something else altogether. Wow!"
"Nice, porter like look to it. Definitely what it says on the label, an after dinner beer. Nice chocolate and plums to the aroma. The flavor is roasty, some chocolate, plums and the slight apple peel taste that I'm starting to decide is a certain type of hops. The mouthfeel is really smooth. Love the name and glad that it caught my attention."
"Very smooth and balanced ""light"" old ale.  Beautiful garnet hues poke through a dark body with thin tan head sitting on top.  Minimal malt aroma.  Typical Scottish maltiness with plummy/cherry undertones.  Looks like I thought this was lighter bodied than other BAs, yet it still left long lasting residuals.  Although it's not a huge beer, many US brewers would be proud to call this their winter warmer."
"Thick and rich pour, and a toasty, and sweet smell. Excellent malt character, quite sweet, very roasted, with hints of plum and caramel. The mouthfeel is the best characteristic of this beer, slighty carbonated, and very thick, this beer could be as good a topping on ice cream as in a pint glass. Very good beer..."
"Boy the Scotts really know how to do up the malt. Every sip of this screams with chocolaty, roasty goodness. Big on the body with a wonderful mouthfeel.   Yummmy!! Hop-heads need not apply."
"Notes: A big dark beer to remember, had it on cask and I am pleased that it is easier to obtain now that it is imported in bottles. The likings of an old ale with a more than sturdy malt back bone to hold up against the heartiest of meals, lamb stew with parsnips and fennel paired with a loaf of multi-grain beer bread would do be just fine. 6.0% abv."
