4.23,13.7,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Benchwarmer has a very dark appearance, more so than most of the other porters I've tried, and there have been numerous. The most distinguishable feature I notice is the pungent coffee flavor. Not overpowering but very prevalent. It makes this beer unique and the reason its constantly in my collection. It does seem to be very foamy, but still not in a bad way. It adds to its character. It has a bit of a bitter start, but has very sweet undertones and finishes so. This is a great beer for a fall day. I will definitely be partaking in more.","RocPorterFanatic","Sep 22, 2007"
2.74,-26.3,3.5,2,3,3.5,2.5,"12 oz bottle. This pours a ruby hued brown color with a 3 finger light tan head over top that falls to a full coat over top. Clarity is very good and there is little to no carbonation. The aroma is lightly caramel sweet and moderately nutty, but over-run with diacetyl butteryness that borders on offensive to me. I recall that they use ringwood years here, so this is not a big surprise. The flavor is a little better. There is a solid roasted character that moves to a more mild sweet caramel and finishes with a mild earthy hop and bitter. This is much better than the aroma. Mouthfeel is moderate with a moderate carbonation. I am really not able to move past the aroma on this one. It just rubs me wrong to have that much diacetly. It is nice that the roast malt helps to cover this in the flavor, but it doesn't save this one for me.","kmpitz2","Sep 10, 2007"

3.94,5.9,3,4,4,4,4,"A dark root beer color with a modest and fizzy head but decent lacing. The aroma is a nutty sweet coffee blend that is pretty alluring. The taste brings out charcoal and chocolate but has a strong sour mash background. It is fairly acqueous and very fizzy but drinkable enough. The sour quality gets kind of prominent during the first half but mellows by the second half so it grows on you as it warms and sits a little bit. I liked it and would definitely welcome this at future sittings. Pretty refreshing for a porter, too.","Durge","Aug 21, 2007"

Poured into an Old Rasputin mini pint glass a a dark brown, with shreds of light pulling through. A nice white head sat on top with good retention. Sort of musty in the smell, but with a little spin some fruit aromas came through...roasted apples come to mind. Taste had a lot of coffee molasses going on. The overall character of the beer was roasty, with charred smoke. Mouthfeel was probably my favorite part of this brew in that it is pretty well carbonated. It gives the beer a bitter ending, while also giving it a crisp and refreshing personality. I will have no problems polishing off the six pack of this beer. It is nice to see a porter with some character. Most of the examples I have had lately have been a bit on the boring side. Now if only I could find some of their stout.","jamie2dope","Jun 18, 2007"

Brew pours to a dark brown color with a nice thick tan head that has a nice amount of retention leaving lacing through out. The aromas are very enticing, slight smokiness is noticeable along with toasted/slight roast scent, seems like a lots of dark malt. The taste is top notch, had a dominant chocolate and coffee like taste that has some sweet characteristics. Slight hop presence at the tail end compliments and rounds out the offering. Only giving is a good for drinkability due to the abv even though I feel I could have many of them, just might not have a good morning!

Chocolate malt bitter coffee, a little roasted nuts come together in the flavor and finish in a bitter hoppy coffee bite. The beer has a tingly feel to it, the carbonation tickles your tongue with different flavors and then after it's gone the flavors stick to your tongue for a bit.

The sweet malt is counterbalanced by subtle hops, yet the smoky, cocoa, coffee taste really comes out. This sweetness reminds me a little bit of a Ringwood yeast, so ripe.

Aromas are toasted nuts, coffee, some toffee, sweet malts. Flavor is more of the same, with dark chocolate, and sweet caramel dominating. Finishes with a cocoa powder flavor. Just slightly bitter with some residual sweetness on the lips. Medium-full in body and quite drinkable. A great example of the style from the folks at Cooperstown.","OldFrothingSlosh","Dec 07, 2003"

It had a creamy, smooth and dry mouthfeel and it was medium bodied. This beer left a good lacing on the sides of my glass.

There is a fruitiness about it with the lingering of noble hop aroma. The taste is great. Low mouthfeel, but all the malt character needed. The abv. slips just over 6.0% justifying the "warmer" aspect of the "Benchwarmer" title. It is lighter than a few porters that I've tried making it exceptionally drinkable.

Faint but pleasent aroma of clean malt with a bit of charred wood. Light to medium bodied with grainy brown and chocolate malt flavors and a touch of sweetness before the hops hit the back of your tongue and mouth with a sharp "twang". The finish is all chalky dry-stout-like dryness with some lingering brown bread and molassos notes.

Very deep brown/black, but clear with ruby highlights. The 1/2" light tan head holds extremely well and leaves some very nice lace throughout the glass. The aroma is of a roasty, sweet caramel malt (no hops). The body is medium /light with a moderate carbonation that leaves it quite creamy in the mouth. The rich flavor starts with a lightly acidic combination of earthy dark malt & herbal hop flavor that reveals a caramel sweetness, and even some light fruitiness, as it warms, finishing dry with a lingering roast and caramel maltiness. Very nicely balanced once it's warmed. Not very complex, but rich and enjoyable with exceptional drinkability. Well brewed!","NeroFiddled","Oct 13, 2002"

Nice chocolate malts with an almost husky feel to them start off this brew with a quick hop bite towards the end of the brew.
