"Dark brown in color with just a hint of light seeping through.  A quarter inch of beige foam covers the top.  Brussels lacing.  Aroma is comprised of caramel and roasted malt.  The mouth is velvety smooth and creamy."

"o - Overall a nice porter. Easy to drink and a nice nose, though the taste is a bit chalky. Worth checking out, would have it again."

"overall a really top notch porter in my opinion. i would highly recommend this for the winter season. great brew from Schlafly!!"

"Overall - I enjoyed this porter, but the carbonation is too high and it feels like I am drinking a AAL."

"Overall, just a standard, everyday, solid porter. Good flavors, good feel, and a good overall and dark beer to drink regularly."

"Overall: A vanilla presence comes on more the longer I drink this. Very good tasting porter."

"Overall, I was disappointed with this rather bland, tasteless, out-of-balance porter."
"When nothing sticks out (good or bad), it must be a good one, bang on the style."

"Overall decent but average porter."

"Poured into pint glass. Appearance is deep and dark with deep brown highlights. Dense brown head forms and has good retention. The nose has dark fruit, roasted barley, and chocolate. Notes of plum and raisin come through as well. Taste is primarily roasted and bitter. A bit of a metallic taste is present as this finishes. Mouthfeel provides a decent body with sharp carbonation. Overall, a pretty run of the mill porter. Some decent flavors, but nothing to keep me coming back."

"Very drinkable yet well crafted and complex porter; I wish we had access to Schlafly."

"This beer's pretty good. There are better porters out there, but this one's pretty affordable to boot."
"This is a nice easy to porter to drink. It's on the inoffensive side, so the lack of bold flavors could be seen in a positive or negative light. Regardless, it's well made and certainly a sessionable option."
""
"O: This is the first Schlafly beer that has really disappointed me, and I'm hoping that something was wrong with the last bottle I drank. Nothing about this beer indicates that it is or ever was a quality porter."
""
""

"Taste is a bit thin and has some definite fruitiness, tangy almost in a souring way. Dont think it is infected, but certainly different. Still maintains some sweetness and the malt profile is really nice and smooth. Hops get a bit leafy on the finish for a bit of a drying effect. I like it, would love to try it on tap."

"O- Its just one more off my list, im glad I tried it but I dont think I will bother revisiting anytime soon. Its decent enough to try."
"Beer is medium in body with a minimal bitterness at the back of the palate, an interesting little beer, decent enough porter, minimal sweetness up front, minor malt roast / bitterness in back. Not bad."
""
""
"Taste is mild but balanced and very appealing. Hints of coffee come in here, along with some chocolate malts. There's an evident roastiness, but it's not bitter or burnt. A perfectly balanced and enjoyable porter, and one to revisit for sure."
"Pours a chocolaty brown without much of a head on it. The nose consists of chocolates and a bit of smoke. The palate follows the nose. Starts off a little chocolaty rand then fades to more of a burnt malt / coffee / smokey flavor. There is also a touch of grain in the mix as well. Medium body with average carbonation goes down smoothly. Pretty decent porter. Nothing to crazy, but sessionable nonetheless. Definitely worth a shot."

"O: Decent beer, sort of a middle of the road kind of beer. Would like to try this on tap."
"12 ounce bottle ($1.79 a single at Liquor Barn), bottled on 9/22/2011. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours mostly dark brown with some ruby red tints along with an inch tan head that stays around a while. There's a good amount of lacing, too. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, nuts and a bit of dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, grain and nuts. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's smooth, a bit slick, goes down easy and has moderate carbonation. I think this is a good brew, I'd buy this more often if it was available in Ohio. Too bad for me it's one of Schlafly's seasonal beers and not available year round."
"Overall Impression- Tasting this Cherry covered Espresso Bean flavor was so crazy! Not sure they were going for this but it came across when I went to enjoy it. Wish there was a bit more body in this brew also... Still very good and would like to now go pick up a 6-pack and see if this flavor is in these as well!"
"This is a very solid everyday porter that Schlafly should have available year-round. At 5.4 ABV (per the Schlafly website) and refreshing quality, this could be a standard session porter."
"O- I know it's a good beer but I wish it wasn't so hoppy. I wasn't able to get over that fact and it's score suffered"
"Easy drinking porter, not great but solid & just another example of how Schafly turns out on point examples of styles when it mass bottles them. Need to do a side by side with their coffee stout, pretty similar I'm thinking.."
"This stuff is just ok. A little rough around the edges."
"A nice take on a style that sometimes doesn’t get attention."
"O - This is a very nice porter. I'm glad Schlafly added this to their lineup."
"The consistency in the mouthfeel is thin, but appropriate for the style and distinguishes it from a stout. This is definitely going to give Founders Porter a challenge for space on the shelf in my beer fridge."
"Overall it's a tasty porter. I'd like to try some of their other versions of this porter too."
"Medium bodied, firm but round. Pretty clean and well balanced. Not a show-stopper, but a solid porter."
"Overall: Some might criticize this for being too light, but this isn't an American Robust Porter, and it's not fair to judge it as such. As an English Porter, it's on-point, true to style, and quite tasty, by the way. B at $7.99"
"overall, not bad. nothing ground breaking here and i wish there was more boldness to it. id drink it again but would not go out of my way to find it."
"Screw drinking this again. In fact this will make me never taste another Schlafly beer for at least two years."
"Ill have to try again down the road, I cant believe this."
"Pours a dark brown with ruby hues and a small tan head with decent retention. Aromas of roasted and toasted malt with a little chocolate. Taste is pretty solid with notes of chocolated and roasted coffee. Overall a decently drinkable porter. Not the best I've had but certainly not the worst."
"I'm as big a booster of Schlafly as anyone, but this offering is a real dog. Not sure how a brewery capable of hitting such heights with their oatmeal stout can fail so miserably with a related style. A mystery indeed, and one I hope the folks at Schlafly solve before next year's Porter is released."
"The taste is good giving equal bits of chocolate and coffee with that nice roasted sense. The feel is very smooth and creamy, nicely crispy at the end. Solid, drinkable porter."
"The color was good (a dark brown/black liquid with a weak foam head). The aroma was faint, with the smell of malt. The taste was good with bitter chocolate and coffee coming through. The mouthfeel was smooth and sharp with a very sharp finish. The drinkability was very good."
