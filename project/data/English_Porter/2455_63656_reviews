"Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint, the beer is a jet black coloring with hazelnut highlights, and a frothy, low profile, light tan head. Nose of cocoa nibs, roasted coffee, and subtle cream highlights. Flavors are roasted and bitter cocoa nib forward, with a bitter coffee undertone. Thin, dry body, with a bittersweet aftertaste. The finish is heavily roasted, lingering on a dry, smooth feel. Solid representation of the Porter style."

"O - good, but not great offering, maybe just a smidgen too sweet."

"Atmosphere is okay. Fair head, and some light lacing. Nose is characteristic of the style... coffee and chocolate most notably. Roasted malt, with some unusual fruity sweetness and a bit of unwelcome pungency. Overall, this is an okay quaff."

"o - good porter but i've had better."

"Really enjoy the coffee aroma, but its nit amazing otherwise. Still a pretty good porter."

"O: The light-bodied nature of this porter makes it very east to drink. I would have no problem drinking several of these in one sitting."
""
""
"This is a pretty decent porter. Like the review I posted for the Wee-heavier, it seems like a good warm up beer or a good starter. Its not bold by any means, but does have some great flavors (particularly the roasted malts and chocolates) going on."

"O: Very enjoyable, I like the different complexities to the flavors/aromas that are slightly sweet but do not contribute overall sweetness to the beer. Pretty easy to drink and well balanced. Definitely one I would have again."

"Beer is medium to light in body and sweet with a mild roast with a nice coffee flavor throughout. It is a very drinkable beer. I'd have it again if this were my local beer."
""
""
"Overall a tasty, easy drinking porter."
""
""
""
"Overall impression - This is a pedestrian take on the style. Sure, it's easy to drink, but it lacks anything that would set it out in a crowd. Reasonably priced, at least when purchased at the brewery."

"O: A tasty porter for sure. Creamy and chocolaty. Only real downside is that it's a touch thin but it didn't detract too much."

"This is a good porter; to style, but simple. The coffee notes definitely dominate the flavor and the mustiness is off putting but not overwhelming. It's also a little thin for my liking. Overall, it was a good one to try, but it's probably not something I'll seek out again."

" good dose of coffee and chocolate was inside here, and that became evident from the very beginning. Lots of roasted malts here with a good bit of sweetness, a bitter dark coffee flavor, mixed in with baker's chocolate. Some nice vanilla maybe in there sweetening it up, but very light. Nice touches of lactose as well in here. Though I have to say I was hoping it would be a little stronger of a flavor, as by the time, it warmed up it started to fade and it all blended together. The finish started as bitter, but faded back to sweet licorice and caramel flavor, odd finish, but still very nice."
"Overall: Excellent Porter that is done right. Solid."
"A surprisingly thin body with a sharp, tangy effervescence on the tip of the tongue. Watery. Fortunately this was not an over-hopped West Coast style American porter.. Sadly, it just wasn't that good. The pour was the high point."
"3.0 D: I'm not pissed that I'm drinking this, but I really doubt I'll ever buy another bottle. There's too many good beers out there to drink a boring one."
"Medium bodied with a medium on the higher side carbonation."
"O: This is, for the most part an average beer. Hardly the worst I've ever had, but not very good either."
"A good porter, that stays true to style. One of the best beers I've had while visiting NC this time!"
"Poured a deeply roasted chesnut brown with a ceeamy-like beige colored head,a great pour.Roasted nuts and coffee dominate the nose,bittersweet chocolate underneath,the aromas are spectacular!Just a little light in the feel,not anything major but if this was spot this beer to me would be off the charts.Roast and more roast on the palate with sweet caramel malt playing a small role,roasted nuts and deep roast coffee really meld in nicely.This is a great porter,I would love to try this on an engine,its complex and very flavorful."
"I got this porter in a recent trade but can't remember for the life of me who sent it, thanks to whoever you are. Dark black color, boring smell that only briefly suggested malts. The flavor however was malt heavy, robust, not bad at all but I am a huge sucker for any porter. Overall I would not purchase this beer but I was happy to have had the opportunity to try it."
"If you couldn't tell by my ratings, this is a good beer. Good. That's about where its stops, but in truth, good is something I can rely on."
"Pours a slightly reddish sable with a decent, if not too persistent, tan head. Aroma is strong and oily with smoky, nutty and semi-sweet chocolate tones - very appealing. Smoky flavor has tones of coffee, unsweet chocolate, nuts and oak. Texture is smooth, fizzy and grainy, not as thick as a stout but still pleasing. Look for it."
"Pours a clearish dark brown with thin tan head and a couple blobs of lace along the glass. Smell: moderately roasty, an acidic coffee note, caramel, raisin, herbal and grassy. Taste: a semi-astringent roasted grain, caramelized sugar and a little bakers chocolate, sweet black plum. The mild sweetness is rather fleeting and balanced by herbal and grassy hop flavors. Carbonation is fairly sharp upfront but becomes creamy. Out of the bottle a little overcarbed. Pretty decent."
"Pours dark brown with a thin tan head. Nose includes roasted (burnt) malts, light chocolate and coffee and a hint of darker fruits. Mouth feel is very thin and the taste matches somewhat - its a little weak. The taste, as I mentioned, is a little weaker than I'd prefer, but not horrible. It's decently balanced with notes of chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. Hops are very understated. Its a decent porter, but there are certainly better ones."
"Solid Porter, pretty drinkable, but not as robust as others on the market."
"Drinkability is good an enjoyable solid brew from a local brewery."
"Overall, the appearance and mouthfeel were easily about this beer, otherwise the roastiness and lack of balance were too much."
"Drinkability: Stays on the soft, sweet, malty side of things, making for a pleasing, tasty brew."
"I thought this was a nice beer. The little bar I was drinking in as I passed through Asheville had only a few taps and most were local. When I said I wanted to try the beers this one got a few mixed reviews but I enjoyed it. The body was dark it also formed a nice head and lace. The aroma was malty more than anything. The flavor was not overly roasty but just right. The roasty bitterness equaled out the toffee and chocolate tones well. The mouthfeel was just a little bit thinner than most porters. Overall it was a good beer."
"Brand new beer from French Broad just kegged yesterday on-tap at Flying Saucer served in a standard pint glass a dark brown with a thin slowly diminishing head. Aroma is decent dark malts and subtle chocolate. The taste is a nice amount of dark malts, cocoa and burnt caramel. The beer is quite light and smooth with decent carbonation. Another great beer from French Broad, they seldom disappoint!"
