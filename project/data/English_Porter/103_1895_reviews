"Taste / Palate: As the aroma suggested it has loads of malty sweetness flowing over the tongue. It is bready and toasty as well as sweet and candy like. I get all the dark toast and caramel notes from the nose plus a light roasted almond like nutty taste. It’s palate feels smooth, a little slick but it’s light enough to keep from being cloying."

"The Middle Ages tasting room is quite special. About 8 beers on tap every day until 6pm. Tasting is no charge, and you can taste all you want. Not a bad marketing plan, because you will find one or more of their products you will want badly."

"O: A very enjoyable Scottish ale, not as sweet as some other but with in the style guidelines."
"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the nose. This held nice woodiness, booziness, and fruitiness, and was ultimately nicely inviting. We did, however, feel a bit skimped on the flavoring and sweetness that we have come to love the style for. Instead, the robust, lighter, and sweet malt profile was replaced by something more akin to a dry Irish stout. We found this beer to be decent, and a pleasant experience, but we were not overly satisfied or excited by much at all."

"Overall- It's good, but only makes me think of Middle Ages' delicious Scotch ale, Kilt Tilter, without delivering the full-flavored punch. It's also got a nice smoky presence that too many American Scottish beer stylings are lacking. A solid offering, and I'll pick it up when I'm pining for its big brother seasonal."
"by far the best middle ages beer, and if it wasnt for ommegang, id declare it the best beer made in new york state! pours a rich dark fudge color with w foamy white lacey head. smells smokey and sweet, bittersweet like pure cacao, and engligh malty like a euro brown ale almost. the flavor is just epic, all time! a blend of two styles scotch ale and porter, there is a lot of flavors going on. a robust smokey sweet chocolate malt thing up front, with a drawn out finish akin to a good glass of whiskey. almost tastes wood aged, and that version must be incredible, but the plain ole duke of winship is an amazing beer. medium to full body smooth as velvet. brewery fresh growler on thanksgiving made the day. seek this one out!"

"Almost a full-bodied ale which is very very smooth and very easy to drink. Middle Ages makes some of the best dark beers and I would highly recommend trying all of their dark beers including the Duke. They don't call it the duke for nothing, this is a damn good scotch ale/porter concoction. Highly recommended."
"This beer makes me wish I'd picked up more in NY. I'll definitely look into when I'm there next."
"With the balance tilted heavily toward the malty side, the complexity of malt development works well with the bulk of attention given to the more porter-like malt base. Any earthy/smokey/peaty complements are slight. The body retains its weight very deep, not relinquishing the sweetness as do many authentic Scottish ales. Still a very enjoyable beer; but maybe mor akin to a robust porter than a Scottish ale."
"Decent Scottish ale but nothing like the real thing."
"Nothing really makes this beer stand out average across the board."
"Pours very dark brown with a solid amount of off-white head. Smells a bit off. Some roasted smells but mostly just a odd smell. Tastes roasted and slightly fruity. A bit more bitter than i would like but overall not bad. Decent mouthfeel and well carbonated. Fairly drinkable"
"D- Duke is pretty good. The multi flavored aspects of the brew makes it pretty drinkable"
"I would check it out if your interested in western New York beers, but don't go out of your way for it."
"medium to thick body, somewhat creamy, lower carbonation. decent beer, I'd definitely grab it again."
"Pours the darkest of browns with a ruby hue in the light. One finger tan head, with good retention and nice laceing. Aroma is of roasted malts and coffee. Body is thick and carbonated. Taste is lighter than expected. Very porter like. Roasted malts and grains. Bit of dark chocolate and coffee. Not bad."
"Super drinkable and enjoyable. This beer totally took me by surprise with its simple, yet rich flavors and amazing texture. Not a classic example by any means, but damn tasty."
"Drinkable , although a bit heavy. I wouldn't down 5 of these. 1 or 2 is fine."
"This dark brown brew allows nearly zero light through and carries a stable foamy greyish-tan head. The smell is semi-sweet, toasty, smoke, caramel, cherries. The taste isn't as astringent or harsh as the level of smoke in the nose would imply. In the mouth it is a bit smoky, but rounded and smooth. Semi-sweet charred caramel, woody/ earthy feeling, finishes with vanilla and a bit of roasted malt. Mouthfeel is smooth, finishes dry, a bit under-carbonated."
"a really nice session beer, anytime of year in my opinion. a nicely made beer, and its definatly worth a try. middle ages makes some really good beers, i was pretty impressed. there variety 12 pack is definatly a good buy."
"D: High considering I didn't love the taste. Every beer from that brewery has been very good. I don't particularly care for scotch ales or porters but this is a nice twist. For less than $1.50 a bottle, it's worth the price to try it."
"Poured cold into a pint glass this hybrid brew looks nearly black mahogany in color, can't see through it. The half-inch light tan colored head settles to a decent covering pretty quickly and a blanket of lacing shows well. The aroma says licorice-malt, deep with molasses and some charcoal. Pretty nice. The flavor brings a sweet brown sugar malt and yeasty brown bread. Maybe a grass hop dry finish in there. But I think the final analysis features a charcoal malt taste that comes with a thinnish bodied brew with some tinny highlights. Pretty effervescent and drinkable enough if you like the flavor. Seems a bit too thin and doesn't really capture the scotch ale qualities that the label claims. Okay but not one I'll revisit most likely."
"Dark brown colored beer with a rapidly fading head.Aroma is chocolate and smoked malts.Taste is cocoa,coffee beans,and smoked malts.Smooth and drinkable with good flavor.This is something I can see buying again in the future and something I would recommend to my buddies."
"Drinkability: A good, drinkable version of the style, and more like a porter and darker than some. Good for the upcoming winter."
"It has an OK appearance, it pours black with a good amount of head and lacing. However, there is this charcoal smell and taste that I just cannot get over, and the mouthfeel is dry. It's not a really balanced dryness, its just a charcoal and burnt fish style style dryness that I can't get over. This is a just plain undrinkable dark ale, and I've had some good dark ales."
"It's also quite light and suspiciously easy to take down (despite its big flavor profile). I'm really happy with this dark beer from Middle Ages, and, of the three I've tried from my sampler, this is definitely the best."
"I think this drinks a lot more like a porter than a scottish ale. It's almost a bit like Black Heart's little brother. It's tasty and one of Middle Ages' best."
"Overall: Quite nice but there might be too much coffee for my liking."
"Nice big body, rich and creamy, swirling leaves a viscous trail on the glass which I really dig. This is a fine Scotch Ale, highly drinkable and eminently enjoyable."
"Very nice beer to me."
"Thanks to brothercannon for tossing me a bottle of this from his variety pack. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. This scotch ale appears a clear deep amber color with a finger of creamy light ecru foam. No lacing to speak of. Nice and malty, as it should be, with notes of chocolate, roasted and caramelized grains, bitter grassy hops. Just about medium in both body and carbonation. Worth your time if you like the style."
"D - Not a bad beer but it tastes more like a porter than a scottish ale to me the beer has a decent taste thats worth trying sometime"
"An interesting hybrid. A very nice Scotch ale with a porter character mixed in, making it a malty, unique brew. They accomplished what they had planned to do quite well, I'd say."
"(rated Aug 8, 2007)"
"D: Again I love being able to get this on cask on the regular. The oak aged version is a little better as it cuts down on the sweetness but this is a real champ of a drinker as well. Definitely grab anything you can from Middle Ages on cask if the opportunity presents itself."
"Notes - Taking a step back to observe this beer overall, I'd say Middle Ages did pretty well in crafting this hybrid Scotch ale/English Porter, as the characteristics of both styles are embodied in this brew. Worth a shot to try if you get the chance."
"I poured this Scottish Ale/Porter into a Victory pint glass. At first, this beer appears to be a jet black color, but a closer inspection led me to believe that it was more of a cherry mahogany brown with a few small traces of crimson red along the edges. On top of this beer was light tan colored 1/2 an inch head of foam. It had nice slow retention that left behind a spotty tan film and a small amount of tan spots of lace around the glass. The aroma was lightly roasted with dry roasted coffee beans, a hint of roasted malts, a touch of sweet caramel, a small drop of pine, and a speck of of roasted barley at the finish line. Nice Porter aroma! The taste however was lacking the roasted punch that the aroma had. It tasted like they watered down the beer a bit. The taste started off nice with roasted barley and roasted coffee beans, but then the taste went south. After the coffee beans, in comes some water to wash down the roasted flavor impact that the previous flavors gave the taste. It did end with a nice crispy floral hoppy finish though. But it was the water that ruined the taste for me. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a crispy yet roasted aftertaste of roasted malts, a splash of caramel, a hint of coffee beans, and a small touch of roasted floral hops. In the end it was a great looking Porter, a great smelling Porter, but an average tasting Porter."
" A wonderful Brew for the chill coming in the fall."
"D: This is a good drinking Scottish Ale. I'm sure I could drink this all night."
"d: I've never had anything like it, but this hybrid Scotch Ale/Porter works very well."
"it's a drinkable beer but I don't think I'll be revisiting it on a regular basis."
"Drinkability here is average. Middle Ages is my closest Brewery, and I give them props for crafting an interesting variety of brews. There are much better Scottish Ales out there, and Middle Ages own Highlander 80 shilling is better. Not a bad call though."
"Pours a clear dark ruby red/purple with 3 fingers of foamy light tan colored head. Nice retention and some clinging lacing. Smells of caramel, cinnamon, chocolate, nuts, and roasted malt. Tastes of citrus briefly up front, then nuts and caramel with a touch of cinnamon, grapes, and chocolate. Finishes with roasted malt, coffee, and slight grassy bitterness. Medium in body with nice carbonation. Very dry with some acidity to it. Finally, a Middle Ages beer that I don't think tastes like butter. A good combination of flavors for a unique tasting Scottish ale."
"D: Pretty drinkable. I like the mix of scotch and porter. It makes for a real nice combination."
"Pours a dark mahogany with two fingers of tan head which slowly dissipate leaving a good amount of lacing. Aroma of hazlenuts and malt. Taste to match, with some bitterness and roastiness present and a dry crisp finish. Light mouthfeel with good drinkability."
"D-Good roasted malt body, but a little to dry in the finish for me."
"Pours an extremely dark brown with a rocky two finger light tan colored head. Spotty lacing on the sides of the glass, nice looking brew. Smell is a scotchy ringwood with notes of coffee and caramel. Sweet chocolate and brown sugar with roasted grains that tickle the nose as well. Smokey chocolate malt and toffee on the tongue at first followed by a hint of scotch and oak flavors. The ringwood yeast taste fits in very well with this beer and doesn't over power in the least bit. Aftertaste is of coffee and cane sugar that leaves the tongue slightly dry. Medium to full body with a very smooth feel. Carbonation is slight and tingles the mouth. This is probably one of Middle Ages better beers although it doesn't get much recognition because of the style, it's just not ""imperial"" enough. I'll have to get this on cask one of these days at the Tusk."
"i saw this ""hybrid"" and had to try it ; pours a deep ruby-brown w/ a creamy tan head which lasted a good while leaving a moderate lacing in my nonic ; smells mostly like a porter, darkly toasted malts and dark fruit, but has a faint smoked whiskey and butterscotch note to it as well ; taste is similar to smell, a robust, deep roasted malt flavor, a bit sweet w/ a woody, slightly vinous alcoholic finish ; a med body, moderate co2 yet still bubbles all the way down ; a quite drinkable, yet confusing brew, i def. have to get more of this one..."
"There was something wrong with my bottle of Duke of Winship. It wasn't completely unpleasant, in fact if was labelled belgian-style and barrell aged, I would have scored it highly. The fact is, I got an infected bottle. Even with the unintentional funk, it showed promise, but I just can't give it a good score."
"I guess this beer exemplifies the style but the fruitness would have me move on after one."
"Nice simple well crafted beer."
"Finished with a mild bitterness from the hops. This was a pretty tasty beer and was pretty well balanced. An enjoyable beer."
"Not bad -- I remember not liking a previous bottle as well as I liked this one, so perhaps the 6 months age on it did it some good."
"Cheers!"
"It involved many of the same characteristics of similar beers of this style, but more so. Scottish ales do not tend to normally rank highly with my taste, but this was good."
"The label states that this is basically a cross between a Scottish Ale and a Porter. Yep, that's pretty much what it is. And pretty good too. Give 'em props for trying something fairly unique."
"Overall, I have to say I'm fairly impressed. I'm not sure I personally can pick apart the Scottish Ale aspect of it, but I haven't had too many of those to really be an expert. Either way, it is a nice beer with a distinct personality. Recommended."
"D - A generally tasty brew with sweetness offset by roasted elements. The dry almost burnt powdery taste is slightly distracting, but overall a pleasant malty dark ale."
"Very thick, and has a nice dry finish. A thick feel on the tongue at the end. Slightly ashy, even ... yet surprisingly smooth. This is a really nice brew. Has a pucker to it, but a nice dry balance."
"Overall a very tasty and complex Scottish Ale. Good Porter characteristics. Highly recommended."
"Pumps a nice deep tan foam that settles into a nearly black beer. Wispy thin brown foam on top. I'm a little confused as to what style beer this is: porter or scottish ale. It has the look and feel of a lighter porter, but the sweetness of a scottish ale. Slightly roasted and malty but very sweet and a little bit thin in the aftertaste. Some sort of hybrid beer IMO. Interesting."
"The pour produced a creamy dense thick foam head that was tan in color, and fairly sticky to the touch. As it was drank it produced a fairly decent lace to the bottom of the glass. The aromas the emerged from the glass were of sweet fruit (apples, grapes, etc), roasted dark malt, nuts, coffee, some bitter chocolate and tones of fresh earth. As it warmed the fruit and coffee seem to be more pronounced. The flavors produced slightly different tastes then the aroma would have hinted to, simple array of hops (pine) roasted malts, fresh coffee, notes of dark chocolate, more hops in the middle, hints of fruit arose and disappeared fairly fast, slate and hay as it ended. The aftertaste was of a burnt/bitter chocolate and coffee mixture - dry. The body was on the thinner side, a tad watery, not what I would have expected, would have liked some body for a beer like this. After being aged (left in the fridge) for 2 years it seems to have held up fairly well, when fresh it seemed to have more body, but even in its current state it is very drinkable. But to be honest I would have never guessed this to be a Scottish Ale when I poured it, I if I didn't know would have thought it be a Porter or in that family."
"I did buy it again and was even more impressed than the first time I tasted it."
"Overall, a smooth beer that eased up as it went on. I might not buy it again, but I am glad that I did try it. Give it a shot."
"D - Very easy to drink, Nice smooth flavor, but the heat of it makes it a little rough."
"Bottle from Lubière : Poured a dark color ale with a big foamy head with good retention. Aroma is quite strong with peat and bitter roasted malt. Taste is reminiscent of a mix between a scotch ale and a porter with a nice dose of peat that mix very well with roasted bitter malt with a nice sweet touch. Body is above average and medium level of alcohol makes it a beer I could enjoy often. Very nice beer that doesnt seem to fall under a particular style."
"The smooth creamy mouth feel made this brew a nice, rich, sipper that I enjoyed over the thirty-five minute ride home. Glad I picked up extras. At a buck a bottle this was a steal."
"Had this brew from a growler. Poured to a dark brown color, which let very little light through. Fair sized dark tan head that has pretty good retention and did leave a fair amount of lacing along the sides of the glass. Very strong caramel malt aromas giving it a sweet scent with a slight alcohol smell. The taste seems to be more about the malt than anything else. Caramel with a candy like taste dominate, but I do sense a slight hop finish. Over all it is a good brew, not a favorite but one I would get again."
"Dark brown, garnet-burgundy highlights. Dense beige froth, about 1/4"". Vanilla, caramel, roasted coffee, faint whiff of hops. Butterscotch, too, of course, as this is a Middle Ages brew, after all (gotta love the way they use that Ringwood!). Roasted coffee, dark caramel/chocolate malts. Herbal hops keep things spicy, and there is a meager smokiness, along with some mineral twang, at the finish. Unexpectedly, diacetyl does not show much in the taste. Rich mouthfeel; medium-bodied and creamy. An interesting beer, for sure. Seems to be more of a Scotch ale by the nose and more of a robust porter by the taste and palate. I'd really like to try this on tap. Definitely a buy-again beer -- great stuff!"
"Aroma is mostly sweet malt (caramel?) but hint of bread and brown sugar are also detectable. I swear this was a dark reddish brown when poured, but it turns dark black with a somewhat creamy, but mostly bubbly head. Some mildly smoky flavors in the fore with hints of carmelized roast beef proceed a sweet mildly chocolate/cocoa powder middle and vaguely molasses tinged finish. A different and worthy approach to the style."
"This was a pleasant surprise, as I was not expecting such a hearty beer from a scotch ale."
"Smooth, sweet, and hearty. My kind of beer! Thanks to dmeadows for this!"
"Just returned from a Friday night high school football game (in the cold) and it seemed like a nice time for a scottish ale. Poured a very deep mahogany color with adequate tannish head that feel to a nice ring. Smell is nice and roasty with notes of caramel present. Taste follows through with more roasted notes and some dark fruity tastes also present. Finished very mild with a moderate sweet maltiness and no hops to be found. I really enjoyed this beer, however it seemed more like a porter (Stegmaiers) than a scottish ale."
"Overall this is a beer to try for any dark beer fan. I'm more of a porter lover than scotch ale and generally think of it as a porter, but that doesn't matter. This is just a good solid beer thats damn tasty and treats you right. I find its generally fuller-bodied and tasting on-tap than bottle."
"Enjoyed with good ol' Redbones BBQ. Nice choice."
"A beer really under my radar, I'm happy it was in the sampler case. Look forward to revisiting."
"Beer is good. Happy free blended beering."
"This beer looked nice enough, but it started thin, and got thinner with each sip. The malt element wasn't there for long before it dropped away to an equally fast-ebbing hops component. In all, it's not a bad beer, but it is nothing special either. You could drink a few of these, but my guess is there is likely better available for the next one. Maybe I was wrong in expecting more, but I thought it was a disappointment."
"Thanks to shippos for bringing this one my way. It pours a dark brown color with a small head that falls fast and leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma has a bit of a smoky character with some caramel malt. The flavor is nice. Has a strong maltiness and a bit of smoked malt that is supposed to be there in a Scotch ale. The smoked malt seems to be left out of a lot of the readily available Scotch Ales that I've had recently. Drinks easily and the body is moderate."
"Dark brown body with a small tan cap. Bits of lace strewn about the glass as this was taken down. Deep sweet fruit notes with an unusually large roastiness for the style. Some chocolate malt and a dash of coffee. Definitely smell more of a hybrid than the standard, but it smell damn tasty. Flavor is kicked off with dark sweet fruits with a strong roasted malt upfront. Pretty big chocolate and coffee as well. Light alcohol is noticeable as is some caramel. Quite the malt bomb going on here in a very complex and tasty way. Strong lingering roasty notes. About a medium body with a smooth creamy feel. Very drinkable stuff. This threw me off at first put by the end of the glass I was loving the stuff. Not your typical Scotch ale."
"This beer pours a very dark brown color with a ruby hue. there is a finger of head that falls to a very healthy coat over top of the beer. The nose is full of deep rich caramel with a bit of peated malt. The flavor moderately coffee and slightly smokey. Its okay, but not what I consider for a scotch. The feel is a on the light side of moderate. Overall, this beer is very nice. I would definatley try it again, but not for a Scotch."
"On-Cask at the Blue Tusk. Damn does this brew improve on the hand-pump or what!? A dark brew, nearly black with a huge (for a handpull) head of espresso-like foam. This brew is fresh, in fact this cask was just tapped two days prior to my arrival at the tusk. The aromas scream porter, but there are scotch ale undertones as well. I detect a bit of somked peat in the aroma, as well as roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, and a bit of the ole' booze as well. Taste is great. Creamy, roasty, with chocolate, caramel, and coffee notes all over the place. Wow, decadent is the word to sum up this drinking experience. Mouthfeel is cask loveliness, and drinkability is insane as well. All of this in a 20oz serving size for just $3. Man, sometimes you really have to love the 'cuse!"
"Duke Of Winship might have been better served (and would have been the stuff of legends) if it adhered more rigorously to the Scottish ale guidelines. It's still mighty fine beer and is one of Middle Ages's best. My thanks to HappyHourHero for the bottle."
"Mouthfeel is good with a nice body and small bubbly carbonation. This is not one of my favorite styles...but this one is enjoyable and I could sit down to a few. Thanks to dmeadows for the opportunity to sample this!"
"Thanks to cmaruschak for the trade. Pours a dark reddish brown color with a medium thin off-white head that has fair retention. Thin and sticky lacing. Strong roasted malt aroma, with touches of caramel and fruit. Pretty full-bodied, and I like the style that blends characteristics of a Scotch Ale and Porter, although to be honest if I didnt read the label I would have guessed just Scotch Ale. Nice roasty flavor with malt, dark fruit, caramel and a hint of chocolate. The finish is a little smokey and has a nice bitterness. Enjoyable brew."
"great great beer- the Duke welcomes you with a little note on the bottle... how nice. Not to sound wrong, but The Duke is welcome in my mouth anytime! It's a dark brown, red if you hold it up to the light, a ring around the glass of tiny tan bubbles. Smells roasty like coffee with brown sugar in it, I love it! Tastes sweetish, butterscotchy, brown sugary, coffee, yeah. Slightly bitter end, like something roasted would be. Mouthfeel is lovely, fizzy enough so it doesn't get to be too much. Drinkability is good as well, yes, unfortunately I only had one bottle to split. I guess I'll just have to go back to the brewery to pet the kitty Bubbles and get more Duke!"
"A nice roast porter. Am I the only one to notice the correct style? Carbonation a tad on the aggressive side, but very fresh from the brewery. Nice dark colour and roast aroma. Small head. Yes, after the fact realize what a nice nightcap this is. Scotch in the taste. Ovaltine satisfying aftertaste. Recommended."
"Pours a light tan, two finger-head that goes slowly leaving a good lace. Very deep amber color. Light carbonation. Medium bodied. Nose is raisiny. Starts semi-sweet with hops in the background, finishes smooth. $3.55 for a 12oz bottle from Oliver's Beverage Albany, NY."
"This is the first ""real"" beer I have had in such a long time that I am overwhelmed by what were once daily pleasures for me in the realm of beer drinking. First of all, the beer looks quite amazing in the pint. It is almost jet black on first inspection, but look closer and there's a beautiful red tint around the edges of the glass. The head was a thick light tan, about half a finger, and receded rather quickly into an inviting ring, although with little lace. The smell is mostly roasted malts with some slight amount of hop undertones. There is also a delicate fruity burnt aroma. The taste is pleasant and warming (or maybe that's the alcohol), although some of the flavors are too unpronounced. It melds together into a nice overall taste, but its a bit sharp on the back of the palatte and I find myself wishing for a bit more malt presence. Don't mistake this for complaining, I could drink this beer all night (and I plan to). The mouthfeel is straightforward, not too thick not too thin, and plenty of small bubbles. Drinkability? Theres plenty, especially since I got it for free. Let the drinking commence."
"I don't really care for the consistency (too carbonated or something); flavors are somewhat harsh and not well balanced; overflowing with smoky character that I don't find appealing."
"Drinkability: Great dinner brew, or after dinner sipping even."
"I must thank my boss for getting me a case of this stuff."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, dense 1/2"" tan head formed, which laced excellently. Brew is quite dark, with a reddish hue when held up to the light. Heavily sweet malty aroma, almost has a slight milk tinge to it, whatever that means. Taste is stunning, the smoothness and heartiness of a porter, coupled with the sweetness and alcohol warming of my favorite style (at this point), the scotch ale. Taste did deteriorate a bit as warming occured during the drinking experience, but nothing too drastic. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent as well. A tremendous category-breaker from those wizards at Middle Ages."
"Drinkability is very nice. Interesting twist on style blending. Very nice beer."
"A cross between a Scottish ale and a porter and it shows in the pour of this beer a deep brown with a few red highlights not much head to speak of,aroma is earthy and fruity with a trace of bitter chocolate a good combonation in my book.Taste has a nice dried fruit flavor up front with a nice chocolate flavor that dominates with a real medicinal finish wich was unexpected.A nice beer with some complexity a nice night cap."
"EDIT: Had a 1/2 gallon growler, still feel like its a muddled and mediocre porter."
"A deep soulless brown color filled my pint glass. Sweet roast, caramel flavors with lingering hints of hops and chocolate malt fill the mouth. This beer has a fairly straightforward character that I ascribe to most lagers. As I finished the pint, the beer became more tart and I didnt notice any fruit qualities. I dont really see the scotch ale in this scotch porter blend. I taste black malt more then peat flavored malt."
"I agree with the a few others this beer is very much like a porter but it does have the nice Scottish qualities I love. Nice head and good lacing, and really nice cherry/auburn red color when held directly in front of my desk lamp. Really nice smokey and peaty qualities and tasty toasted and mocha chocolate finish of a porter. Also does have a nice slick buttery taste tying the two together. Really suprisingly good."
"The smell is mostly alcohol with a little bit of smoke. The taste is totally dominated by the smoke, with the alcohol not far behind. Malt profile is not all that dark, but the alcohol masks it's flavor, making it taste darker than it really is. Slighlty overcarbonated for a beer that is trying to be an old ale and/or porter."
"Drinkability: Make sure you always have a couple of these stashed away for when you have a hankering for an interesting blend of ale styles."
"Its good out of the bottle, but on tap it seems that the flavors play nice together, making it more interesting. If you are in an area that has bottles of MA, make the effort and find a bar where you can pick up ther growler, its worth it."
"The beer pours a dark burgandy color with a light tan head that stays strong. The aroma is an intense mixture of Ringwood yeast, roasted barley, chocolate malts, and patent malts; truly excellant. The taste is very unique. You get that buttery feeling as it goes down, but there is that dark grain element that adds such complexity to the palate. It does have a lot of porter qualities to it, but I like a beer that is willing to push to envelope a little. The mouthfeel is fine, although it is medium to heavily bodied. This one is a pleasure to drink. I think I'll have another."
"Ahh it got cold again so I have been relagated to drinking the warming ales. The Duke poured a regal brown with a huge crowning cafe au lait head. This receded into a very intricate and sticky lace It was very porter like in appearence with no light seeping through the glass. The smell was also very porterish, with sweet chocolate malts and burned currant flavors. It was bordering cloying in the nose, but not quite. The taste had a very interesting thing going on. There were some real huge robust porter flavors of toffee and coffee with seriously roasted malts, but it mellowed into a much more scottish ale type bear towards the end of the taste with blood red cherry and burned sugar fruits. There was just a touch of hops towards the finish. The Scotch qualities improved the further down it got with a much more warming mellow scotch flavor appearing. The mouthfeel was all ale with bubbley carbonation that was a little too fizzy. I would like a more flat mouthfeel, but not creamy like a malty stout or porter. More like a dubbel. This beer is, however, recomended. I am only just getting into the scottish styles."
"Wow. This beer is great even before tasting it. A nice khaki-colored head settles to a thing layer and provides excellent lacing. The beer is a deep dark brown color. Not completely opaque. I was lost in the smell, just breathing it in an enjoying it, and I lost control and had to sip it. Oak, berries, and chocolate aromas. Smokey, too. Tastes very smooth. Some chocolate and burnt flavors. Creamy and the aftertaste is lighter than expected. Wonderful beer."
"If you ever see this beer available on cask, run (don't walk) to try it. One of the better hand-pulled pints I've ever had."
"A salute to Syrbeer for introducing me to The Duke."
"I really liked this beer from the bottle design to the last drop. Blackest tones with hardly any light showing through the glass. Foam was even brownish-tan. Did not perceive much of a Scotch-styled nose -- bottle seems to hint that this one is something of a cross-styled brew (""...bids you welcome with smooth flavor of a Scottish ale, capped with the regal flourish of a porter""). Taste also was consistent throughout the session: Burnt roasted malts with some sweetness, noticeable alcohol and a very hint of peat smokiness. Great balance and taste; well-crafted."
"The quintessential Porter pour, a very deep brown to almost black in color, the head regal as it crowns the beer all nice and chocolate brown, creamy in texture and the residual lace fine sticky sheets to coat the glass. Light toasted grain aroma with sweet cotton candy like tones, buttery, a real treat to the senses. The front is malt sweet, the top middling in feel, the finish has a splendid hop presence, the carbonation moderate and the bittersweet chocolate dry aftertaste a pleasing seal to this quite quaffable beer."
"Thanks to Davo for this Regal treat."
"Dark brown, almost impenetrable. Solid head, roasted barley aroma with strong grasses and herbs. Others have commented how this beer falls in between a Scottish ale and a porter, and that is a fine description. Some upfront flavors have the smoky, grassy malts that are characteristic in a Scottish ale, and then the creaminess and dry finish as well as a lingering of coffee and roasted barley flavors indicate the porter. Excellent; tasty, warming, energizing, revitalizing, this beer should probably be treated as a porter since Scottish ales are delicate, smoky, and excellent as an after dinner drink. This beer has rougher edges, but could, in turn, be as useful as any good porter. The best of the Middle Ages beers I have tried."
"Excellent Scotch ale. Dark, robust and delicious."
