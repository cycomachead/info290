"Beautiful chocolate black color with average head, tan in color and good sticky lacing. Aroma is malt forward with a hint of chocolate elements. Taste is rich in chocolate and coffee, nice balance between the two. Mouthfeel is excellent, chewy, chocolatey with the right amount of carbonation..One of the better beers I have had from this brewery !"

"A little too coffee for my personal preference but very drinkable porter"

"This one is infected, unfortunately. I can taste the underlying English porter flavors I want, but it's masked by sourness. The nose is similarly off, reminding me more of sour milk than dark ale. I'm willing to try another one at some point, but this was one I poured out."

"O: I was surprised to see that this has a 90. After drinking it, let's just say I'm not. I'd even say it's top 10 among the style. This has great chocolate flavors, yet the roasted/hoppy bitterness balances it beautifully. A classic example of an under-the-radar gem."

"This beer was better than the St. George IPA I reviewed last, but apparently it was also past it's prime. Hopefully I will get a chance to try them both again with fresher versions."

"O- Not sure why this has such a high BA score since it's pretty much like every other average porter I've had. The only thing that makes it stand out is the aroma."

"O - Overall a great example of a porter. Will most definitely get a few more after Summer"

"Pours from the 12 oz. bottle a very dark, cola-ish reddish brown with a large rocky beige head. Too dark to tell what kind of bubble action is occurring in the darkness. Aroma is of roasted, smoky malt. 1st sip brings to mind dark unsweetened chocolate and black coffee. Mouthfeel is on the light side. Overall, a tasty, refreshing Porter that I would not mind having again."

"12 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a half inch tan head that stayed around for a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. The brew smells like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, and some caramel. It tastes like roasted malt, milk and bittersweet chocolate, caramel, cream, and a bit of burnt/charred malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. I think this is a pretty good brew. One of my friends picked up a single bottle of this for me on a recent trip, and if it was available in my area I would certainly buy this beer again."

"Out of all of the St George Brews that I have had this is my least favorite, but going up against many of their other choices is a hard contest. I look forward to all the options this brewer has to offer."
""
""
"O - This is just a good all around beer that doesn't disappoint in any category. The aroma has a nice blend of hops with coffee and chocolate malts, and the flavor is just as enjoyable and seems to improve as the beer warms. This porter is my favorite offering from St. George thus far, and is one that I'd definitely grab a six pack of in the future."
""
"This pours a deep brown almost black color with a 1/2 finger tan head that retains well. Smells of cocoa, coffee, and roasted malts. Nice smelling beer. Taste is similar to the smell with much more of the malts coming through. As it warms plenty of bitter chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall a nice porter."
"Overall, a good porter; esp. nice on a cooler evening."
""
""
"O: An excellent porter. Although porters aren't my favourite style of beer, I can see myself reaching for another of these in the future."

"O - St. George Brewing Co. has done a good job with this porter. While I don't drink a lot of Porters, I think this is a fine example of what a Porter should be. 4.0"
"O: Goes down easy, relatively tasty, not filling, minor kick, ok representation of style. This isn't a blow your mind porter, but it's worth sitting with for a while."
"Great beer. I highly recommend it."
"Big thanks goes out to drabmuh for sending me this one as an extra in a past trade! Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Poured pitch black with a three finger very light tan head that subsided to a one finger slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and tobacco. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, and tobacco. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation (an almost creamy texture). Overall this was a pretty nice brew. It was almost spot on for the style it was targeting without a doubt. The flavors on it were very light and refreshing, which might have been its only downfall. I was really hoping for more robust flavors in this one going into it, but it did well with what it had. The mouthfeel on this one was quite excellent though. A definite must try if you get the chance."
"O - Worth every penny, try some, store some."
"Thoroughly black, this beer has a slim tan head. It's aroma is a pleasant mix of dark roast coffee, ripe fruit, and dark bread. There is a fleeting chocolate smell as well. No real hop aroma. The taste is semi-sweet, with a nice balance of hops. Nice malt and grain favor...lots of roasted, coffee-like flavors. The beer has the feeling of a higher abv than it actually is...medium-full in mouthfeel, the body is great. Nice brew."
"Very drinkable, great dark roasted malt, and avoids the sour taste of more austere versions. Enjoyed at Capital Ale House in downtown Fredericksburg, VA."
"Overall, a very nice porter. It's not one of my favorite styles, but I enjoyed this on. Not quite the most complex porter I've ever had, but it was extremely drinkable. I had two of them with dinner."
"Dark brown, nearly black. Just a touch of light brown head. Average retention and little lacing. Dry, lightly roasty nose. Taste has a good bit graininess as well, with more neutral malt sweetness than I was expecting, but still rather dry overall. Roasty toastiness, but not a ton of flavor overall. Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Could use more body. Good creaminess for how light it is. Better than some of their other beers, but still no treat."
"Hopefully the rest in the pack will be good."
"Overall / Drinkability: Despite the singularity of coffee-like bitterness in this one, I rather like it, but then I also like my coffee black so I think that has something to do with it. I can drink this by itself, and I think it would go really well with beef or pork. Not really a sipper, and indeed, it went rather fast - but - I think it becomes better once fully warmed up and a mix of American and English porter styles comes out. Other than the lack of smell - a good beer."
"An easy drinker of a beer, low ABV, but a boring beer for it's style. It lacked any brown sugar or toffee notes, and it's flavors were pretty muted. Maybe I got an old bottle. It's not distributed in my area, so not sure when I will get a chance to try it again. For now it was fore getable."
"D-Interesting but I would probably not seek this one out."
"Wonderful Porter, fantastic after taste."
"Mouthfeel is dry and a little bit grainy (not unpleasant), thick and fluffy feeling. Very drinkable porter."
"Exceptional!"
"Drinkability is very good as well. Rich and smooth, good flavor and 5.00% abv. A worthy session beer."
"overall very solid and a nice treat in the end."
"D - I could drink a number of these before wanting less sweet."
"Overall, very nice indeed. It does border on being almost too bitter, but manages to maintain its integrity and balance. For my tastes, it's ever so slightly coffee-centric, which would make it difficult to sustain as a session brew, but my single 12 oz was thoroughly enjoyable."
"D: Nice, but overall not very memorable. Clean finish and very nice over all. This is clearly well made but does not stand out above the rest."
"From the Dragon Pack sampler the bottle pours a deep brown body that is not quite opaque when held to light. Some spotty lace is left on the glass. Aroma has milk chocolate, a hint of coffee, earthy and fruity hops, and a note of molasses. Medium body and carbonation. Taste is mostly caramel and milk chocolate with an earthy hop bitterness that balances well. Hints of molasses and toffee underneath. Just a hint of dark roasty malt bitterness. A good, but not stellar, porter."
"Following the pour, a very dark brown brew resides, with a thick head of ecru cream that lingered for a few minutes before mostly abating. A syrupy smell issues forth, though enough roast comes through to keep the nose from getting too sticky. The taste brings things back to Porter Reality, with more body, more roast, with that nice licking of molasses. As heavy as it initially feels, it lightens over the course of the drink, leaving an impression of medium body that allows for good drinkability."
"I can't fully get over the molasses thing - it's just a little too syrupy, which diminishes its pleasantness to some degree. But all told, a very solid porter."
"drinkability is good. alcohol is hidden pretty well. a solid english porter. good stuff."
"Pours an opaque dark brown, black almost, medium sized tan head forms, quickly settles down to a thick ring around the glass, with a thin layer, some lace spots stick to the glass. Smell is nice, malt balls, very roasty, chocolate, dark fruit, lightly milky, toffee, raisin, very bready and earthy, a bit musty, vanilla, very malty, pretty nice aroma. Taste is similar, very dry and bready, chocolate wafers, coffee grounds, malt balls, chocolate milk, dark fruit, biscuits, graham crackers, very dry and roasty in the finish, but a light fruit/raisin character lingers a bit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, very dry and roasty finish, quite nice."
"All in all a very pleasant beer and glad it came my way."
"Pours a deep chestnut color with a nice tan head. Nose has roasty malts, molasses, cocoa, caramel and coffee. Taste has burnt malts, dark fruits, chocolate and espresso. Medium body is a bit thin, so is the carbonation. Good beer to wash down some fish and chips."
"Thanks to my buddy chaz over on realbeer for this. Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into my nonic pint glass. Appears a translucent deep chestnut color with about two fingers of ecru foam. I'm getting aromas of rich roasted grains, bittersweet chocolate, chocolate bread (grab a loaf from Wegmans), grassy bitter hops. Bordering full bodied for it's style and amply carbonated. Smooth, creamy and undeniably drinkable. A great porter."
"D: A very nice offering. Chock full of roasted, chocolaty porter goodness. I'll be looking into more beers from St. George in the future."
"D = Goes down easily, a nice simple standard porter. It would be easy to drink a few of these while talking with friends."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Poured two shades shy of black with ruby highlights around the edges and when backlit. Half inch tan-colored head dissipated into a star-shaped skim within seconds. Some lacing, but weak adhesion. Nose reveals cocoa and toffee. Taste indicates, cocoa, coffee and a roasted character, as well as a slightly metallic aftertaste. Mouthfeel was between light-and medium-bodied and effervescent; a little too much carbonation for my liking. All and all, a decent and flavorful porter, but there are better examples of the style out there."
"A dark brown body with a mountainous head that left voluminous lacing. A mix of sweet malts that are more complex than me just saying cocoa or caramel (or gum, cotton candy or sugar) w/ some roasted and burnt malts as well. Medium-body, very smooth and creamy as the chocolate and other sweet malts dance all over the tongue but are kept in check with a drying sensation from the roasted and burnt malts. Finishes clean and dry, a perfect counterpoint to the beer's overall sweetness. A solid porter."
"D: Very drinkable English style porter, I really enjoyed this."
"Very nice color, brownish red and dark. Just a hint of hops for most porters. This beer was very solid. Scent had just a slight yeast smell. and the taste was good, more malty than hops. A very good solid beer and great to have a drink with the buds."
"Would buy again"
"Big ups to BA EriktheRed for a pretty sweet bonus brew!"
"pint at Taphouse on Queensway, Hampton, VA"
"This is a highly drinkable porter - light enough to enjoy in hot weather and heavy enough for cold weather sipping. The low alcohol content makes it one of those increasingly rare beers in this world of viscous Baltic Porters and Russian Imperial Stouts - a light, refreshing dark session beer."
"Two fingers of moca colored head top this very dark porter. I can see some red when held up to the light. First sniff is dominated by chocolate and molassas. I also get some toasted malts and a hint of fruityness. Taste is pretty much as advertised in the nose, dark bitter chocolate flavor is the mainstay but there is a noce almost citrus like hop flavor and a little bitter finish. It was just a hair thin for my liking but I prefer very thick porters. I will probably pick up a 6pack of this wonderful porter next time I see it."
"St. George brewing company seems to be more geared toward making English style Ales, this particular beer being an English Porter. I like it. It's malty without trying to reinvent the style with dry hopping. Slightly complex with some good cocoa flavors, very enjoyable. Recommended."
"Pretty drinkable for a porter, great brew."
"This is easily my favorite St. George brew, and one of my favorite porters. Definitely worth a try."
"Notes: Really nice stuff, quite mild and sessionable."
"12oz bottle courtesy of Dyan, thanks! I have never even heard of this brewery but I was impressed by this beer. Dark brown-black color with a nice coffee-latte colored head. The smell was my favorite part, roasted chocolate malted. The flavor deviates slightly from the aroma but is still in solid porter territory. Easy to drink, try it if you get a chance."
"T + M + D: Roast malts, a nice and modest coffee + chocolate profile. A dash of hops for balance, just right for the style. This is a particularly clean and smooth porter: refreshing, flavourful, clean, and smooth. This was very nice during a tasting, and even better from a full bottle to get the total experience. Quite nice, and a recommended try."
"Overall- Very good without being to cloying or rich. Brought a 6er back from VB and happy I did so!"
"D: Very nice porter, with definite chocolate character. A good session beer."
"D: A wonderful porter, especially if you like them on the sweeter side. Low ABV makes this a great session beer for porter lovers."
"As a bonus...it's great for grilling burgers as well. Whenever I've been able to get a hold of this, I saturate about 2 lbs of ground beef in 9 oz. or so of it, with a little bit of worcetershire and some garlic. It's bliss."
"Overall, this was one very smooth and drinkable porter."
"D - Pretty good, this is easily an ""anytime"" porter, which is hard to find for me. Usually I have to be in the right mood for a porter, but this just sits so well I could see this being a regular for me. Very tasty and highly recommended."
"D - This was a flavorful beer that went down smooth and easy. I would have to give this one a thumbs up."
"D - I could drink these often, I found this to be very drinkable, a quaffer at only 5%, yet full of flavor and many tasty textures. The ale is missing the overroasted chalkiness that is common in some porters."
"Drinkability - a tasty porter, worth a few more."
"I bought a sixtel direct from the brewery and I'm going to get another very soon !"
"Good all around, but just a tad watery in the middle. Perhaps just a touch more crystal malt would help boost the body. Overall very good though. It's always nice to see a brewery sticking with old world tradition, doing it well, and not making everything extreme. Well done St. George!"
"This might be one of the best porters I've had in quite a while. It was last night, and I'd driven 12 hours from NH to my brother's in Virginia before being welcomed in with this fine brew. Anyhow, it's got a great flavor and mouthfeel. The flavor comes across as smooth and chocolately, along with some notes of roasted barley. There's a wonderful silky texture on the tongue. I didn't pour it into a glass, so I didn't get the full aroma or appearance, but nothing about this beer tells me I wouldn't want to have it again! I'd definitely recommend it."
"Very nice porter! It has an excellent, dark coloring; very deep and robust aroma; it goes down very smooth; a very rich, smooth, mellow, and chocolatey flavor. I would recommend trying this. I wish I would have bought a six-pack of this, as well as the sampler pack when I was at the brewery."
"One of the more pleasant porters I've had in recent memory. Nice flavor with nice body. No complaints here, and maybe the best of the offerings from St. George's that I've been able to try."
"Porter is my first foray into the world of St. George beer. I'm impressed. I like the fact that it favors the more substantial end of the style spectrum. All those hops don't hurt either. Jolly good show."
"I really dug this one. It's hearty and flavourful but subdued at the same time. I can't get St. George brews at my local stores, but the next time I am in Delaware or Maryland I'll definitely take a look for some more of this stuff as well as some of their other brews. Recommended with ease."
"Pours a dark opaque black with a frothy off-white head that lasts and leaves spotty lacing. The aroma is of dark malts. The taste is of dark malts with some bitter dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, almost like a milk stout minus the roastiness. This would make for an excellent winter session beer, but is also enjoyable on a hot spring night. Likely the best beer St. George makes."
"Pours almost black with little head and no lacing. Poured it vigorously to try and get a head but didn't work. Smell was roasted malts and lots of chocolate. Taste followed smell with the chocolate flaovrs very much at the front and the roasted/burnt malt flavor being very subtle. A light-bodied brew but very smooth and rich. One of the easiest drinking brews I've had. A good, tasty session brew. Worth seeking out."
"[ serving type: bottle ]"
"Drinks pretty easy, a real straight-forward English Porter"
"This is one tasty and well balanced English porter. I think I will try to get his into the regular rotation. Porter fans shoud seek out one of these."
"Solid cordovan tinged brown. Steady and short walnut hull cap that leaves a single ringlet of lace after it eventually vanished. Rich chocolate, molasses, light smoky coffee, and gentle English hop aromas waft enticingly from the glass. Opening with some chocolatey malt and a soft mouthfeel, the finish is slightly chalky, and English hop accented (Fuggles perhaps). There is a pleasing roasted note that also comes up in the finish. The soft hops infuse themselves into the roasted chocolate body. There is also just a touch of complimentary sour fruitiness. Medium-light body with fine carbonation, this finishes on the dry side. A nice representation of an English porter, and a good session beer."
"Pours with a four finger light tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Hints of deep mahogany color. Light carbonation and heavy bodied. Chocolate/coffee nose. Starts sweet, a chocolate/roasted coffee flavor, some bitterness at finish. 12oz bottle gift from Vintage Cellars Blacksburg, VA Label puts ABV at 5.0%"
"Basically, it has the richness and flavor of a stout but the smoothness of a porter. The assertive burnt bitterness isnt too astringent and the malt sweetness isnt to overbearing, and, to top it off, they blend well together. I can see why everyone has had good things to say about this porter"
"Mouthfeel is a little thin for a porter, but still smooth and silky. Doesn't quite feel just as warm as it should, but this does help the drinkability. All in all not a bad offering and a solid English-style porter. I'd definitely recommend."
"I could drink a few of these, especially if I could get them down the street. Thanks phisig137 for sending this my way."
"D: A good porter, but a tad thin. The trickery of the aroma to taste doesn't sit well with me. Glad I got the chance to try this offering though."
"Overall: I'm not a big fan of porters, but I like this one a lot."
"Poured into a pint glass. This is a deep mahoganey brew with a large foamy head. The head stays with the beer only dissipating after about five minutes. The beer is not transparent. The aroma is of toasted barley, coffee, and nutty. The taste is quite good. You can sense once the toasted barley, the hint of hops, almonds (or some other kind of nuts), and an astrigent taste of coffee. The body is medium and the coating of the mouth leaves a sticky film. It is a quite quaffable brew, but unfortunately with most porters I can't take much of the astringent flavor. If you like porters this is a must!"
"D - Best beer from the Dragon pack. One of the top porters I've had in this young season. Overall, very enjoyable because of the lower ABV."
"D: Very drinkable, well worth a six pack."
"A really great porter that I would highly recommend to anyone favoring the darker, heavier, deeper end of the beer spectrum. Feels like a big beer without having a big ABV."
"D: Yummy porter. Recommend for all porter drinkers. Contact your resindent Virgina BA for a trade!"
"Drinkability - not an avid fan. good, but not great. much better porters out there."
"M/D- Med-heavy body,moderate carbonation for a porter. This beer was really good...better than I expected from the mix six of beers that looked like it came out of a harry potter movie....its hit or miss in the six pack, but the porter is definitely worth trying."
"Decent porter but a lot others I would pick over this one."
"Poured out black, with a brown head color, lacing on the glass. Aroma of sweet chocolate, roasted coffee, slight hop apparent, and some smokiness. Tastes of sweet chocolate, with some bitterness, roast in the back of the mouth lingering, slight hops at start. Mouthfeel of creamy, nicely carbonated, although in Baltimare when the rep at the AHA conference gave me the bottle recommended that I open over sink known to spew six inch foam fountain. Then he demonstrated it. I did not have this problem. Body medium-full. Overall a really nice porter, one of the best that I have had. It is well balanced. Everyone should be lucky enough to get to have this porter."
"Drinkability: An excellent porter and another winner from St. George. I'm not a porter session drinker, but if you are you should definitely try this, as it's complex enough not to be overbearing, but always remains interesting, and is fairly low in alcohol."
"Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. This is a good porter."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 3/4"" brown head above the barely translucent dark brown brew, with reddish highlights. Head holds on well, with heavy, foamy, sticky lacing. Aroma is dark roasty malts, reminds me of a brewhouse on dark beer brewday. Taste is sweet dark grains, with a coffee bitterness close. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and drinkability is not only nice, but the abv lets you revisit and revisit. This definitely one I could make a regular, if I could find it locally."
"Addendum: From Jason's Review ""faint blackberry."" I did a re-sniff, yep I smell it too."
"This beer is readily available at most upscale grocery stores in the Carolinas and for less than $7 a six-pack, I would recommend this as a good everyday Porter."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - served chilled in a nonic. Pours very dark brown, almost black, with a 1 inch tan head that leaves a few rings of lace. Smells of roasted/burnt malts, coffee, chocolate, some sweetness and dark fruits, and some sort of earthy notes. The flavor is dominated by burnt malts, but there's also coffee, bitter chocolate and hops, and a sweetness akin to an oatmeal stout. The body is medium and coats the mouth nicely and it is a fairly drinkable porter. Could be a bit more balanced perhaps."
"Overall: Not perfect, and the first couple of sips were a little tough, but overall, a drinkable porter with some interesting flavors."
"Visited St. George today and had this beer on tap-nice color, not much a head, smooth with a nice body. Some porters can be over the top-and to me-much closer to a stout. This porter is not one of those. As I review this beer I am having a bottle-and I struck by its drinkability. As other reviewers note-the balance is very good."
"I believe the first beer I ever reviewed was the last time I tried a St. George (IPA, I believe). This one may have been cask conditioned at the World Beer Festival, but I wasn't sure about this. Great example of a good, but not fantastic porter. Balanced with robust flavors of chocolate and caramel. Easy to drink and enjoy more of in the future. I think this one is found around here but since I didn't enjoy my first St. George's, I never took this one into consideration. Will probably pick up a six pack of this soon."
"overall: this beer really goes through some changes from start to finish. aromas and mouthfeel definitely are affected as the brew warms. flavors remain pretty much constant. can be a session porter or a sipping porter."
"Crisp at the start, and smooth at the finish. Roasted tones last long into the finish. This is a big, bold and flavorful porter. Great drinkability, and this is one I will be seeking out in the future."
"D- Lighter in alcohol than most, very flavorful ... put those two together and you get a very drinkable brew."
"This beer on a medium pour produced a nice one finger head that lasted for about a minute or so before dissipating into a ring and island. The lace clung nicely all over the glass as if fearing for it's life. It had a nice burnt brown look with deep ruby undertones. The nose was deep bodied, smelling of freshly roasted coffee and a nice cherry, dark berry hint. Only upon taste do you find the nice dark chocolate over fresh coffee taste. The roasted malt dominating and a very slight fruitiness that fights off any hop taste. At the end, you have the tiniest taste of hops that just slightly sours your mouth but quickly fades away, begging you to come back to it quickly.The mouthfeel is medium-light to medium, yet creamy smooth and crisp. I would prefer it just a bit heavier on the mouth, and just a bit less carbonation though. The nice smooth aftertaste lends quite well to the drinkability and I would easily be able to have it as a session beer or even just with dinner. This is a great example of American porter that balances complexity with drinkability. It's easily right up there with your Anchor and Sierra Nevada porters."
"Just had a pint at County Ale House and it was as good or better than the bottled version. Ebony, sticky lace, coffee, chocolate, toasted malts in the nose and taste. Just an all around excellent and quaffable brew. One of my favorite Virginia beers. If you make a drive down the I95 corridor, then this is one to pick up."
"A very good representation of the style. I would drink this all day anytime!"
"beer entered the glass as a depp brown almost opaque color with a moderate tan head that fell to a slight ring. Smell is a tantalizing mixture of chocolate, roasted grains, and an exuberance of coffee. Very nice. Taste is roated coffee with a background bitterness. Mouthfeel slowly grows to tangy dryness that continues to improve as you delay the next sip. A very enjoyable beer."
"This beer pours to what I would call a extremely dark brown color hedging on black with an adequate dark tan head that broke down somewhat quickly but left a nice amount of lacing through out. The aromas that I notice first are roasted/burnt malts that seem to lead to an earthiness smell mixed with a sweet like scent. I am also able to pick up some chocolate like aromas mixed with a nutty scent; over all this is a very pleasant smelling brew. Has a pronounced roasted malt flavor that highlights coffee along with chocolate tastes. Finishes with a slight sweet flavor that seems like it would be expected based on the overall flavors of the brew. Hard to pick up hops but am able to notice a slight bitter taste but it is far in the background. Over all this is a fantastic brew, very happy to uncover it while in North Carolina! Will have to look for this one when I get home."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Good to the last drop! Very interesting for a porter to have these fruit-like qualities, but that seems to be the trend in many east coast porters Ive had. Maybe thats the way they were intended to be once upon a time. Wish I could get this stuff around here!"
"Solid, Solid brew by St. George's. Nice, meduim pitch color, some head and lot's of lacing. Nice roasted malt profile, followed by a slight malty-sweet finish, Aroma matches the roasted flavor and texture to perfect degree. Over-all a good brew to enjoy any time of the year."
"The body is a dark brown color with a small tan head on top. Scattered lacing was left around the glass as this was consumed. Roasty malts and dark chocolate fill the nose of this. There are mild hints of ripe dark fruits in the background as well as notes of caramel and coffee. Flavor starts out with a big roasted malt kick before leading into a bitter sweet dark chocolate. Very deep roasted flavors all through the taste leading into the lingering chocolate roasted malt after taste. Body is medium with a nice creamy smooth feel to it. Great drinkability as this is very smooth to go down. This is one beer I should make my session beer a bit more often. Great solid example of the style."
"Fish n' chips with some malt vinegar would do nicely."
"Beer is good. Happy porter beering."
"Pitch chocolatey, root-beer dark... can't see through it. Bit of khaki head that was not much to begin with, then kept reducing down to only a dusting and then a tiny ring. Nice sherry, port, and chocolate scents. Good amount of carbination going on, but not too much. Just enough to foam up a bit in your mouth-but not enough to make it feel champagne-like. Tastes of roasted malts, black coffee, dark toast... nice. Goes down very well. Not too heavy, very drinkable for those of us that enjoy the porters and stouts. Enjoyed this as my first beer in Duck/Outer Banks!"
"Mouthfeel is medium, lots of body, finish is smooth and clean with a mild black (no cream, sugar) coffee aftertaste. A little sweeter than I think it should be but otherwise very good. Many thanks to meathookjones for BIFing this to me."
"Drinkability: A lot of subtle elements in this porter, with the chocolate dominant and the fruit and toffee adding another dimension"
"Taste: Creamy and full in the mouth. Limited sweetness, with nice sharp, acidic kilned malt bite after the swallow. Drying hops bitterness in the finish gives way to roasty charcoal. Gentle dark chocolate in the end. Very nice porter."
"12 ounce bottle, picked while on vacation on the Delmarva peninsula. Poured chocolaty brown, a hard pour raised only a 1/2 inch dark tan head.Didnt stay long settling into a film, left minimal lacing.Faint Coffee in the nose. Medium bodied, cool and crisp. Coffee,Chocolate, with a bit of caramel and molasas notes. Soft carbonation, adds up to a nice mouthfeel. Sweetness becomes more evident after a few sips.finishes dry with a nice almond and bittersweet chocolate flourish. Respectable porter. Not flashy but worth a try."
"It's been awhile since I had a brew from this brewery and man was it nice to try this one!Pours a deep brown with some ruby tints thru out with an of white head that was pretty thick for the style.A great aroma of fruit dark chocolates and earth very rich in aroma,Taste is buttery and fruity with some unswetend chocolate and great earthiness in the finish.An almost perfect porter big flavors easy to drink,awesome."
"12 ounce bottle, no freshness dating."
"Dark black color. Medium white foamy head. Aroma is chocolate, caramel and roasted malts. A medium bodied porter. Malts are nice and roasty with a nice chocolate and coffee flavor, Slightly spicy hops. Nicely balanced. Soft carbonation. Smooth flavor. Nice porter, this one surprised me, it was much better than I was expecting it to be. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"Pours a lovely deep brown/black with a lightly foamy, coffee-colored head. Minimal lacing. Aroma of deep roasted malt, coffee, and dark chocolate. Palate is rich with more dark malt, chocolate, molasses, and mocha. Finishes dry with a sweet mocha aftertaste. My girlfriend says it tastes like coffee and fish (2.0), but I disagree. I likes it."
"Drinkability: A boring porter, IMO. No character. Won't try again."
"This beer pours a dark but not quite opaque brown with a medium thin beige head. Thin and quick lacing. The aroma consists of roasted coffee, milk chocolate and malt. Medium-bodied with a nice blend of chocolate, malt, coffee and hops in the flavor, and there was a nice underlying roasted malt aftertaste throughout the glass. The finish is lightly bitter hops. Overall this is an enjoyable Porter, maybe not quite as good as Edmund Fitzgerald or Fuller's but solid all around."
"Its extremely deep chestnut body appears almost black on the bar, and it reveals brilliant ruby highlights when held to the light. The creamy tan head drops slowly to a wide collar, and it leaves some very nice lace throughout most of the glass. The nose displays deeply kilned malts with a roasted edge and a deeply caramelized, almost burnt-sugar side; as well as some rich nuttiness that includes pistachio. The body is medium and it's gently crisp across the palate with a fine, moderate carbonation that softens as it warms. The flavor is slightly richer than the aroma indicates, but the character remains the same with the addition of a solid bitterness that takes the whole thing just a little bit further. A faint fruitiness appears upfront, coat-tailed by a rich nuttiness that's immediately jumped on by bitterness (think peanut skins). The caramelized sugars become apparent as it warms (caramel, molasses, burnt sugar); and its coffee-like roastiness develops towards the finish. Dark caramelized sugars, nuts, a touch of baker's chocolate, and bitterness linger in the aftertaste. Quite rich and enjoyable but without being heavy or cloying. Certainly worth trying!"
"Thanks to DrewS. for the sample!"
"Good foamy tan head on top of a clear dark brown beer with garnet highlights around the edges. Head has good retention and a little stickiness that holds onto the sides of the glass. The aroma has lots of roasted caramel malts and chocolate with a slight hint of hops. The start is smooth with a slight sweetness. Lots of roasted malts then pick up with just a touch of chocolate in the background. The finish is dry and bitter sweet with a hint of smoke flavor. Some slight bit of sweet malt comes back again in the aftertaste. Not much hop bitterness to this brew. The hops seem to be tied together with the roasted/burnt bitterness in the finish that make for a nicely balance brew. Carbonation is somewhat low and the mouthfeel is light to medium. Definitely a good porter, but there are others that Ive enjoyed more. Ill certainly buy this again at some point (especially since its a very local brew), but probably wont stock my fridge with it."
"-cheers!"
"Beer pours very dark for a porter this beer is comparable to the colore of Perkuno's from Heavyweight, and after a slow steady pour about an inch of tan creamy head forms on top of the body. Trickled lacing kicks this beer up another notch on the food chain and the aroma this beer has to offer is full of milk chocolate, coffe tones created from the dark roasts used in this brew. This is just a textbook porter, one that I would love to attempt to brew at home because the taste is just heavenly. Light carbonation carries this rich robust porter with silky chocolate tones and a espresso finish this beer may be one of the better porters I have tasted for all around drinkability. I would buy a sixer of this stuff in a heart beat medium body not heavy just incredibly drinkable, a go to brew wish I lived near the brewery so I could frequent this beer and even have a sample on tap."
"Pours a very dark brownish ruby color with a short tan head that fades into a tight lace. Nose is sweet and chocolaty and is quite reminiscent of chocolate covered raisins. Medium to full in body and smooth and creamy in texture. Taste starts of with notes of sweet roasted malts and dark fruit followed by a dry and earthy nuttiness that gives way to notes of bitter-sweet chocolate and espresso. This is one fine porter that Id happily recommend to anyone. Thanks to Loki for the sample!"
"Very good porter and a great price. An overall great line so far."
"Gotta thank the Shit for bringing me one from his trip out East."
"Im so lucky that the Saint George brewery is just a hop, skip, and a jump down the road from me. This beer is always readily available. This exceptional brew pours a dark midnight black color with a tan, medium sized rocky head. The froth fades away slowly, leaving a sticky lace splattered on the glass. The aroma is rich with roasted malts, chocolate, and roasted nuts. Taste is full of roasted malts and coffee, with slightly nutty undertones. This is an extremely smooth and easy drinking beer. I highly recommend to anyone if you can get your hands on it."
"Note: This was the old porter (prob 2-3 years old) brewed at the old Brewery (Label states B.A. Brewmeister, Inc.) before it burned down. Label shows St. George slaying a Dragon ... much cooler than the new label."
"Pours a nice deep dark color which give way to a light brown head. The head turns to a film and lasted the whole ride to the bottom of the glass. The aroma of roasted malt and molasses is your first introduction to this porter. Taste is very, very good. Malt with a touch of earthy tones coffee, maybe some chocolate? A very easy Porter to drink. I recommend this one to all!"
"Cheers to Murph for picking this one out, and lugging it to Florida."
"Pours black with dark ruby hues poking through.  Rocky head with clinging lace.  There are coffee notes all over this brew.  Starbucks, not Dunkin Donuts.  Fruity esters fight their way out and a bit of chocolate as well.  Good mouthfeel, finishes dry.  A good porter, but I couldn't see myself drinking a bunch of these.  Nor do I drink a bunch of cups of coffee at a time either."
"One of the blackest porters I have ever seen.  Pours super black with a nice brownish head and decent clinging lace.  Very nice roasted flavors combine with a nice smooth bittersweet chocolate flavor to make this a very interesting aroma.  Taste starts off with some nice roasted malt flavors before going very chocolatey.  Bitter, roasted coffee then comes back to combat the chocolate sweetness and balnce the brew.  The extremely smooth and creamy mouthfeel of this beer make it exceedingly drinkable as well as one of my favorite porters to date."
