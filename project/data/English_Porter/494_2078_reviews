"Overall: a decent Australian take on the English porter. The usual flavours of chocolate and roast coffee, with a touch of liquorice and caramel to boot. The price is right, at around AU$58 a case, but a slightly fuller body could have improved it somewhat. Nonetheless, an easy-drinking, reasonable beer."

"O: Very drinkable beer. Nice take on the style."

"Overall a solid English style porter. Moderate flavour overall, doesn't build, doesn't overtake itself. Good beer-drinkers beer. Not the worst of the JS offerings either."
""
"A pretty average porter. Nothing there to offend, but not much to get hyped up about. Pretty modest, dependable and reasonably sessionable."

"On tap at the Generous Squire in Perth. Very dark body with a reasonably dense head. Aromas of roasted malt and chocolate. The coffee flavour hits first, followed by toast and dark bitter chocolate. Not bad. Mouthful is a touch thin and fizzy. One of the better offerings from Malt Shovel."
"Lightly carbonated dark beer with little to no head.. perhaps because I poured it straight from the fridge. Smells metallic and minerally. Nice smoky burnt caramel flavours, hint of chocolate and strong coffee aftertaste. Somewhat sour on the tongue and not very sweet, I feel it lacks the complexity of other beers in the James Squire range."
"O- For such flashy advertising, I find this beer fails to deliver the goods. Mainly, the level of robustness was hugely lacking as was the mouthfeel in relation to the style. It wasn't a disaster or anything, just a bit underwhelming."
"Pours chunky. Nice medium chocolate brown. Stout like on the nose with roasted notes. Flavours promised on the nose donâ€™t really translate but still drinks ok. A touch too fizzy for my liking. JS should have done better IMHO. Won't be back for this."
"A brew that has a lot going for it, but also could have done a lot more. The flavors are very nice, but are a bit muted and the mouthfeel is off. Still, a fine little porter and an easy drinker. Would certainly have another."
"Overall, decent, but I prefer a fuller bodied porter with less carbonation. I think perhaps Australia's warm weather accounts for the thinner, bubblier variation on this type of porter, or perhaps, I'm just giving a mediocre beer too much credit"
"Drinkability: I thought this was one of the better beers I've tried from Malt Shovel Brewing and while it wasn't an outstanding porter it was quite nice and went down easily. I'd surely have another, but that said, would not go out of my way to choose it over some of the others I've had."
"It's a drinkable beer that I'm ever so slightly suspicious of. At least it's something worthy of drinking when all your other options are variations on Tooheys New."
"Probably my pick of the bunch from the James Squire range. Haven't had this in years-good to see it hasn't changed much. A really nice pleasant chocolate driven nose backed by a touch of roasted coffee. Like most JS beers, this is a beer for the punters. Enough to keep a geek happy and not too far out to scare off Joe Average. A good medium bodied, medium bittered dark beer with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Goes down just fine this cool evening."
"Love the colour of this one, very dark chocolate with a nice white head. Typical porter smell. Arguably it is not as complex as a good porter should be but it has nice chocolate notes and I rate it highly for its drinkability and sessional qualities, there are probably better choices but considering price and availability this is a standout."
"Carbonation is a bit excessive, and the body is a bit watery."
"Overall: Middle of the road porter with good enough taste though not as complex as the label would have you believe.. Worth checking out."
"One of my favourite beers. An outstanding porter. I've rated based on drinking the beer out of the bottle but it's exceptional on tap. Tried it at James Squire Brewery Alehouse at the Docklands when I was in Melbourne. Best beer I've ever had on tap. Phenomenal."
"This beer pours a nice dark cola colour with good carbonation that leaves one finger head with subtle lacing here and there,it has aromas of malted chocolate and some subtle hops,it has an average mouthfeel with tastes of vanilla,chocolate,coffee and malted barley with a feint touch of hops,this is not a bad beer thats easy to drink but have had better takes on the style thats for sure."
"Alright, but not amazing. I prefer James Squire's pale ale."
"Pretty good."
"A decent winter time beverage. I'd probably rather a stout though I'm sure this would be a good choice to break things up a little bit."
"Probably best to give this one a miss"
"D - Sessionable ABV, tasty enough and not so thick as to be a challenge, this is quite drinkable."
"Taste is roasty and a bit gritty, like badly dissolved coffee. A bit weak, really. Unpleasant finish, like...Yeah, badly dissolved coffee. Mouthfeel is nice, quite full bodied, bit too much carbonation for the style. Apologies for a very unimaginative review, but I really think this is a very middle-of-the-road beer, quite unimaginative as a beer."
"Pours a dark chocolate in colour with a creamy head that lasts for a while and leaves some lacing on the glass. Smells very chocolatey and sweet. Smoky chocolate flavours with a slight bitter aftertaste. Nice mouthfeel with light fizz. Not a bad drop."
"I love porters as they have alot of the intensity of stouts, but are lighter & easier. This was a good porter for sure - Love the old porter style."
"Pours a very dark amber-brown with a creamy tan head. Looks like a porter. Aromas of dried fruit (dates?), coffee, with a slight astringency. Tastes of the same dried fruit plus a really lovely burnt-sugar sweetness, some soapiness toward the end, slightly ""dirty"" aftertaste. According to my notes: ""verrrry nice."" Highly drinkable, moreish, not too complex to want another round. Best beer I drank in Australia."
"Very nice London style porter - rare to see an Aussie made one too, and at a sessionable (well 2-3 at a time) alcohol level."
"poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. It has a deep brown color with a cream colored head which quickly receded. The smell was a bit sweet with notes of caramel and mocha. As it warmed the aroma of soy sauce started to come through. Taste was also a bit sweet with a bit of toastiness. Medium bodied with tight carbonation. This is an easy porter to keep drinking."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has a deep chocolate brown color with a medium bodied cream head that diminished very shortly after the pour. This brew had a strong smell of wild cherry and coco and coffee notes. The flavor was heavily chocolate and had a mild bitterness in the finish. There was also a sweetness that was unexpected. This had a moderate carbonation which fit the brew well. Nice work."
"Overall - I may be quite biased towards porters, but they taste so good that I can't help giving them high scores. This beer is no exception."
"D - Tasty and sessionable porter for these colder months."
"Another very good beer from James Squire! This is easier drinking, and more interesting to taste than most stouts. There is a small premium over mainstream beers, but for the quality you get it is more than worth it. This is an excellent beer for winter's nights, as it gives a real warming feeling, unusual for a beer than is not particularly high in alcohol."
"D- This beer is pretty thin for a porter and the flavor and smell if very light. It is smooth drinking but not much of interest is going on."
"Served with a nice small head and some lace. Very dark almost opaque brown. Nose is dark malt, a little dark fruit, a little hop, a little yeast, perhaps some coffee and roastiness. Flavors the same but with some significant sourness. Just a little too much. Velvety texture. Drinkable. Nice beer."
"Very drinkable, fairly light, and at an average alcohol content, the Squire makes a great session ale for a night out with the lads; or as accompaniment to a casual dinner with the wife or girlfriend - of which Squire had many, sireing at least 11 children through 3 women! And although no children were had, that doesn't include his last affair!"
"easy to drink..would have to get my store to order it in though."
"Overall impression: Middle of the road porter. For the price most shops here charge, there are many better options."
"James Squire's Amber Ale remains my favourite from Malt Shovel Brewery, with Golden Ale in a close second. While I can appreciate that this is a quality brew, I'm forced to give it a poor review due to my dislike for coffee, and the fact beer shouldn't take like beef."
"I think it's a great beer from James Squire - would love to see their take on a stout some time. A great take on this beer is their seasonal rum rebellion porter - it introduces a more exciting element to the beer to add to all of the ""subtle"" descriptions above. I may be a bit harsh on the mouthfeel score, but I may re-adjust when I find out just what consistency a porter should have."
"A whole lot of flavor from a fairly small beer. The shelf life of imports at the place where I bought this isn't exactly great, and so this is probably even better if drank fresh. A true treat!"
"This one has its ups and downs, but it is tasty enough in the end. I enjoyed it."
"Also perhaps a little one-dimensional, there's not much to it other than the roasted coffee. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, of course."
"mouthfeel was more subtle than i expected. which also goes for what i thought of this beer overall. its almost like a blackhole and the aroma and flavor just cant escape it. maybe its so good it wants it all to itslef? dont know. not bad but ill try something different next time. the guy att he bottleshop said it was great on tap...maybe?"
"A porter that goes down very easily -- it's very hard to stop at one."
"Drinks okay. not rich enough to meet my expectations of a porter, but better than lets say Tohoey's (sp?) dark. Still haven't found anything better than cooper from OZ. Would love to try this on its home turf"
"I suppose a good introductory Porter because there is really nothing offensive nor anything that stands out in this brew. Just very watered down, IMHO. Mostly it is the very, VERY thin mouthfeel that puts me off of this porter."
"Deep Brown. Deep, well cooked brownies in the nose along with other roasted and toasted malt elements (chocolate, coffee). Tastes of roasted barley and its attributes (chocolate, cocoa and coffee) along with a distinct burnt malt element, notes of marshmellow and vanilla, and a subtle hop job. A tasty little brew on a Saturday night."
"Drinkability/Overall: Very very easy to drink porter great beer. My first porter and I will have again for sure."
"The beer pours a rich brown color with clear ruby highlights. There is a small tan head of 1 cm that fades to an edge layer. Leaves tight lattice as it recedes. Aroma is chocolate and toffee with no hops anywhere to be found. I find the nose very appealing. First sip reveals a velvety smooth body and fine carbonation that rolls across mh palate. Flavor is similar to nose with some toffee up front that rolls to chocolate and finishes just a bit roasty. Very Very smooth and easy to drink beer. QUite a nice beer that I would buy again!"
"Smooth with just the right balance of bitter hops. Well done."
"I should think that it would drink well over a reasonable period of time."
"The initial taste is a bit of bitterness thanks to the coffee and bakers chocolate-like. A good try at a porter. IÂ’ve had better, but IÂ’ve certainly had worse."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Enjoyable, but disappointing in the way that biting into a Snickers and getting a Milky Way would be disappointing. Less black malt, and LOTS more chocolate malt might improve this beer dramatically."
"Bottle. Almost black with ruby tints when held to the light, fairly ordinary light tan head even when poured hard, although plenty of lacing was left behind as the bottom of the glass approached. Aroma somewhat disappointing, slight hint of roasted malt with a little milkiness which improves slightly as it warms. Taste is somewhat better, very mildly bitter dark chocolate and espresso with a slightly dry and warming finish. Mouth is watery; not what it could be I suspect. Sounds a bit like I am down on this one, but it is quite drinkable. Guess it could be summed up with ""good effort, could do better""."
"Not too carbonated. However I couldnt drink too many of these in one sitting."
"Notes: Not bad, a little on the weak side in terms of flavor, but it is easy drinking. Dissapointed by how thin the beer was."
"A unimpressive beer. This one had potential with its nice dark brown color, decent head and nice smell. But the taste was just average, with some slight coffee and dark chocolate flavors comming through. The beer would get a higher rating if it were not for the horrible mouthfeel. Thin, watery and over carbonated, this nearly ruined the beer. Pass."
"A light drinkable porter, it is close to a porter soda in nature. Not a connoisseurs beer, but a refreshing darker beer."
"This beer pours a very dark brown color, but not quite black like stout. The aroma is of faint coffee/mocha. It tastes very chocolatey and slightly like coffee. Very sweet, no discernable hop flavor/scents at all. Its very smooth and drinkable. A tasty brew, but probably not one you could drink on a hot day or all the time. But it's great on a cold night like tonite."
"Overall, a completely umremarkable brew. The flavors just didn't seem to get together as well as in other brews of the style. Nothing to wake up the neighbors about."
"Poured light black, deep red colors with a thin white head. Dark fruit and chocolate malted aromas dominate. Very light feeling in the mouth for a porter, mouthfeel is a little thin. Roasted malt taste is light with a lingering bitter finish. Just not enough complex malts to be a great porter."
"there are better porters in this region, let alone the world. its not really an accurate description of the style. still its an inoffensively pleasant beer thats not a bad starting point for locals who want to drink dark beers that arent guinness."
"Both this and the IPA by Squires are a little 'underdone' in terms of style. Would love to see this with a little more oomph."
"Notes: Totally forgettable, if not somewhat off-putting."
"Deep chestnut brown colored with a thick frothy head. Excellent lacing with this brew. Aroma is similar to a dry stout, chocolaty with a good raosted malt aroma. Flavor is lacking a bit as it seems to me a bit thin and watery. Overall not a bad porter, could use a bit more flavor is all."
"Dark brown color, medium head. A lighter bodied porter. Rich roasted malts, subtle hops. Mild, but robust flavor. Chocolate malts, slightly sweet. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is malty with a slight chocolaty finish. Milder, lighter tasting porter, but a nice beer."
"Flavors: Medium bodied, w/ a roasted taste. Some nice maltiness w/ very little hoppiness. The carbonation has a bit of bite on the tongue. A better than average porter, but nothing spectacular."
"It poured with an incredible head with excellent retention, settling slowly in a matrix of dimples. Ths, combined with the dark brown, slightly reddish color, made for an excellent appearance. It presented a slightly smoky, toasty, chocolate aroma. These characteristics were echoed strongly in the flavor, which was toasty and robust. A substantial body and lingering finish make for an excellent drinking experience. The grain bill for this beer must be a thing of magic."
"Who would have thought it heh? Â– Those bloody convicts made good."
"Per M.J. flyer: O.G. 1250 / 12.7 Plato. Chocolate malt and Black Roasted Wheat. New Zealand Super Alpha and Australian Willamette hops (23-25 IBU). Brewed with a lager yeast."
"Ruby in color, with a thin head. The aroma is malty, with hints of caramel and dark fruit (prune?) Slightly sweet. Flavor starts off malty, a little roasty with a hint of nuttiness. Dark fruits kick in mid-palate, and the roastiness re-asserts itself pleasantly in the finish, lingering on into the aftertaste. Body is smooth and bit coating. Only complaint is that the beer seems to start off a lot bigger than it finishes -- the complex combination of flavors at the start of the beer suggest a full-bodied, robust porter, but the beer finishes a bit on the watery side. Disappointing in the end, but definitely worth a try."
"The pour a deep ruby red color, the head spumescent, beige, the lace chunky. Nose is malt, caramel, lightly roasted grains, pleasant. Front is malt sweet, the top washy, the finish is modestly dry, minutely acidic, slightly hopped. Drinkable and a ""Beginners"" Porter, lacks a ""Robustness", I like in my Porters, not bad mind you, just a bit ""Thin-Wasted."
"Way too thin for a porter, have to say that up-front. Near black with a small dark-tan head. Roasty choclate and grainy malts. Has bits of coffee on the nose. If it wasn't so thin I'd really enjoy it."
"A solid, drinkable porter.  This beer is not a great porter, but a good solid one.  Noticeable toasty/roasted coffee-like flavors.  Fairly light in body for a porter."
"I don't mind this porter, neither does the bottle shop that i buy it from, they hide it from the rest of the beers, and i get a respectable dirty look from the owner everytime i buy some. Has a copper head, that looks alot like it has too much sediment running through it. but other than that i can't say a bad thing about this Porter. It's not as complex as some porters, but it's chocolate, caramel, slightly nuttish finish is still pretty good."
"Not that great, but a bit thin for a porter, apparently this is the shit on tap, but i haven't had that privelige yet, i'll eventually try it on tap though........OK, now i've had it on tap. Much better, more roast and chocolety nuttyness with a dry finish. Still a tad thin, but pleasant, nice for session drinking."
"It's a good porter, with all the right porter caracteristics, but not worth shipping halfway around the world for.  By coincidence, i bought some Catamount Porter the same day this came in the mail from MJ's Real Beer Tour.  Catamount is more complex in every way."
