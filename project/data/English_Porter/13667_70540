Not everyone likes a lighter bodied porter but if you're familiar with the style you're going to like this beer. This is a very well executed English porter with some tastefully subtle pumpkin spicing in the background.","Byrnie-madoff","Feb 18, 2015"

Its really not a pumpkin beer and its really not a porter in the traditional respect and if you are looking to rate it on those parameters then you would feel disappointed. I however thought it was a good hybrid style. You get those porter notes, in there, but you also get the pumpkin spices. I did not detect pumpkin itself, if there is really any in there to begin with. You do get the spices, which I enjoy on a limited basis and this is a good beer to have one or to finish off a night of fall beer drinking. Is it the best beer I have ever had? No, but it is interesting and was better than it has been represented here, for the most part.","humuloner22","Sep 28, 2014"

Also, the malt character is lacking sweetness with overly dry charcoal flavor. Hints of ashtray, burnt wood and charred toast making this beer intensely dry and unpleasant.

The beer is even worse when it comes to taste/mouthfeel in terms of clash b/c the sweetness one expects from pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, not to mention slight spice, seem to gets bulldozed over by a slightly boozy roasted and breadlike malt base.

The pour displayed a thin, murky-colored, porter that didn't seem that it would be exciting and my nose revealed that to be correct. Very muted, with some roasted pumpkin and maybe touch of spice and cocoa. Not much different on the palate. Very thin with little to no finish.

Smell is of pumpkin, malt, a little bit of spice, a hint of dark chocolate -- really nice combination.

So come on, put your heart into and create something really special, like what you've done with your Monticello Reserve. Even if I personally hate it, I'm sure to taste the love and passion put into the product. Because as it stands, all I typically taste is mediocrity.","Rhettroactive","Oct 11, 2011"
3.67,10.2,3.5,4,3.5,3,4,"Taste is an unusual mix of roasty malts and pumpkin & spice. Very flavorful, and lighter in body than expected. I was not sure how the porter would gel with the pumpkin, but this one works just fine. Enjoyable!","secondtooth","Oct 10, 2011"
2.06,-38.1,3,2,2,2,2,"M: too much carbonation not very smooth or full bodied like i would expect from a porter/stout","celticknot","Oct 09, 2011"
3.7,11.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"O: I'm glad I tried this, but wouldn't go for it again. Tasty, interesting, a nice mix up from the typical Pumpkin fall beer. But overall, it wasn't great.","russwbeck","Oct 05, 2011"
2.98,-10.5,3,2.5,3.5,3,2.5,"Overall: The word 'unexceptional' comes to mind. It was good, but not great. I'd have it again only if it were on tap.","CrystalShipMS3","Sep 29, 2011"
3.16,-5.1,4,3,3,4,3,"Overall: An interesting idea that doesn't really come off very well, in my opinion, as the flavors tend to clash and the medicinal element adds an off-flavor that is disconcerting","brentk56","Sep 29, 2011"
4.6,38.1,5,5,4.5,4,4.5,"Very drinkable. Not sure what the ABV is, but if it's any higher than 5%, it's hidden quite well inside of the deliciousness of this offering.","tlazaroff","Sep 25, 2011"
3.82,14.7,3.5,4,4,2.5,4,"O - The Boxcar is a nice seasonal from Starr Hill. While it's not the best pumpkin beer I've ever had, it is a nice twist and a welcome addition to the fall seasonal lineup. The only real drawback is the thinness of the beer, which is something I hope they work on in subsequent years. It is tasty though and something I'd have again.","WMEugene","Sep 24, 2011"
3.94,18.3,3,4,4,4,4,"Deep mahogany in color with thin, disappearing tan head. Instant aroma of pumpkin pie spice with sweet malt, caramel, and vegetal pumpkin notes. Like most pumpkin beers, just perhaps a bit more roasty. The flavor is definitely more porter than pumpkin like, although there is a distinct and very tasty pumpkin pie aftertaste. Otherwise, roasted malt and caramel flavors. Medium body with a smooth, carbonated mouthfeel. I thought I would be disappointed like with most pumpkin beers, but this one is a pretty nice combination, especially with the great pumpkin aftertaste.","goldbot","Sep 23, 2011"
2.67,-19.8,3.5,4,2,2,2.5,"O - Fairly absent of anything that could be construed as decent balance. I so very wanted to like this, but it wasn't to be. I'd love to be more of a homer for local beers, but this one is tough to take such a stand. BUT - They gave the pumpkin genre a shot and even did it with a less mimicked style (going porter), so here's to constructive criticism that inspires them to retool this for next year.","gopens44","Sep 13, 2011"
3.2,-3.9,3,3,3.5,3,3,"Overall: Nice idea, and good try on it but just wasn't where I like a ""pumpkin beer"" to be. I could drink a couple in one sitting, but why would I? I feel like a quick dash of pumpkin was dropped in an average porter recipe.","Muck4","Sep 13, 2011"
2.77,-16.8,3,3.5,2.5,2.5,2.5,"O: A pretty bland, boring beer with an odd tartness in the middle. Neither the porter nor the pumpkin aspects of this beer really stand out and it ultimately just falls flat.","n2185","Sep 10, 2011"
3.08,-7.5,4,3.5,3,2,3,"Picked up at Total Wine & More for $1.99. Had to try a Pumpkin Porter, but this was not such a great introductory.","hoptualBrew","Sep 09, 2011"
2.81,-15.6,3.5,2.5,3,3,2.5,"Pours black with one finger of light tan foam with decent retention. Aromas are entirely pumpkin spicy (cloves, cinnamon, etc.), but not the slightest whiff of anything that would tell a blind man he was sniffing an ale, which is a total failure in my book. Flavors are roasty and pumpkin pie like, with a typical porter finish. The majority of pumpkin ales that I've tried taste better than this, as do the majority of porters. In the end, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Downplaying the spices and/or an intensifying of the primary malts would greatly enhance this beer.","droomyster","Sep 04, 2011"
4.05,21.6,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,4.5,"This has been getting great word of mouth in Virginia. I grew up down the street from starr hill, and they finally knocked one out of the park. Pours an appetizing dark brown color with a big creamy white head. Aroma is of nutmeg , cinnamon, and toasted malt. Taste is complex, with the roasted malt bringing out the pumpkin spices. Not as tasty as the smell, but still good. Mouthfeel is perfectly balanced to bring out the flavor. Overall this is a resounding success for starr hill. Great job guys and gals","ramseye4","Aug 29, 2011"
3.72,11.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"O: The idea of this brew was definitely better than it's full realization. Still, it's a nice brew and an interesting take on the pumpkin ale.","Chaney","Aug 29, 2011"
4.5,35.1,4,4,4.5,5,5,"M/O: very well balanced beer. The pumpkin flavor has some nice flavor but the pumpkin really smooths out the bitterness of the porter. Great tasting and easy to drink.","pzrhsau","Aug 24, 2011"
3.57,7.2,3.5,4,3.5,4,3,"Overall an interesting brew. I would really like to see these guys push the envelope a little farther. Namely, I want more real pumpkin flavor.","Spider889","Aug 23, 2011"

3.8,14.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Pours a very deep brown with a two-finger tan head and some strong spotty lacing on the way down. Thin collar throughout. The nose carries a good amount of spice, though it's balanced by some nice roasted malt and dark chocolate. Pumpkin character comes through a bit, though it's more from the spicing. The flavor carries some roasted malt and pumpkin-pie spice. Also there is a good amount of dark chocolate. Medium body with a nice cask carbonation. Slight spice in the finish. Well done.","Thorpe429","0"
