3.92,4,4,3.75,4,3.75,4,"Enjoyed right at ground zero, the Phillips tasting room in Victoria BC (basically the front of the brewery). A dark brownish black brew with a faint yellow halo at the bottom of the glass and a smattering of khaki head. Aroma was rather fruity for such a dark brew, with some currant notes along with the expected roasted coffee and chocolate. Palate is initially bittersweet chocolate truffle, vanilla, and medium roast coffee, but this evolves over the course of sips, with some additional fruit roll up, peanut butter, and caramel notes appearing. Gets sweeter as you go, really. Body is quite light and drinkable, truth be told, with a smooth creaminess and a semi-dry finish full of cacao powder. Fantastic dessert beer that had to overcome some of my ""special ingredient"" biases to earn these ratings. Solid English porter base with a tasteful yet assertive layering of sweet flavors.","CalgaryFMC","Mar 14, 2014"

Fairly sweet with little balancing bitterness, the major flavour component seems to be tart cherries that are dominant from beginning to end. There's not much in the way of chocolate, roast, or malt here, but as it warms these qualities become barely apparent. The body's strange as well, with not much heft up front but a little syrupy in the finish. The carbonation is rough as well, giving it a bit of soda character. What a peculiar beer.
