"M - a bit creamy, but a bit of a bite too"
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is of roasted malts. Taste is of malts, some hints of coffee, finishing a tad bitter. Feels medium bodies in the mouth and has decent drinkability. Overall this is a good quality beer."
"A fairly standard porter (much better on nitro though)."
"drinkable, but the syrupy feel may prove to be a bit much after 2-3 of these. overall a pretty solid beer that i will be buying again."
"Drinkability: a solid porter. I wouldn't hesitate to have a couple of these in most settings."
"I had this beer on cask at the Redhook Brewery in Woodinville, WA and it was pretty good. They had 2 available on cask, the Blackhook and Winterhook. The blackhook when I had it was just put available on cask and I enjoyed it. I am not usually a porter drinker, however I enjoyed this one. It wasn't too thick or too much on the flavor which I liked. It was a very smooth, enjoyable beer. I think for people who are like me and don't normally enjoy the darker porter/stouts, this one is definitely a good one to have. The head on the beer was perfect, and the color was beautiful. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a mug club member there, definitely a good beer."
"Overall, one of the Top 5 best Porters I have had for sure and I would absolutely recommend someone trying this."
"D- Went great with the roast beef sandwich I had for dinner. I could see plowing through a six of this pretty easy. All in all, nothing spectalular but decent. I would say barely a porter though."
"A dark reddish brown color pour with a short offwhite head,medium carbonation. Aroma of coffee,rasins , and light chocolate with hints of roast. Flavor is roasty,with some chocolate and a bit of coffee , maybe a hint of hops . Thin body with a slightly oily mouthfeel , very sessionable . I find this to be one of the better offerings I've had from Redhook but as Porter goes it's nothing I would deem as special."
"Watery and thinner than expected mouthfeel. it helps in the drinkability, as surprisingly I think this would pair well with food. This is so far from what I would call porter that I'd actually consider drinking this with a pizza (and thus the higher drinkability mark). I was gifted a 6 of this stuff, and would never buy this for myself. Not horrible, but I'm not seeking this out again."
"I had the beer from draught. A nice black color with a thick head. Initially the beer had a sour taste, but after several sips the sour taste faded. I'm not sure what the source of the sour taste was. The aftertaste was nice and roasty, and there was a light creaminess from the nitro."
"drinkability - Easy drinking, but nothing big, wasn't that bad of a beer, but nothing to crave about."
"Workable, but otherwise too ordinary for words."
"Drinkability: Its a nice rich porter-not an imperial and as such, I was impressed. I would drink it again, and I think the taste grew on me more as I finished a six pack over a few nights ."
"Poured a light black with a small tannish head. Nose is roasty with some espresso, cocoa and toasted malts. Taste is average, kind of toasted with light hints of cocoa. Mouthfeel is pretty thin. A drinlable porter in my book but not something I would seek out."
"D-Quite high, really. Nice flavor and very smooth. I'd love to drink this one more often."
"D-Very drinkable, very impressed by Redhook!"
"This is a simple porter that I could session. Not bad at all."
"Overall, this was a disappointment. I rarely am not happy with porters, but this one just got it wrong. It's not drain-pour, but I won't be getting anymore."
"Pours a body that is black in color, with a big frothy head, tan big bubbles, and good lacing. Has an aroma of chestnuts, some slight coffee, and chocolate. A nice coffee taste, sweet, malts, nuts. Watery-not thick. Okay."
"Poured from the nitro tap at the Portsmouth Brewery into a pint glass, this dark beauty shows a very deep coffee color with rose touches at the edges, a Guinness-like tan head and plenty of lacing to boot. The aroma is a mild coffee malt with a vague hint of citrus. The first taste is a silky and clean but mild charcoal, some coffee bean and vanilla. A bit more like a stout by my way of thinking but a pleasant pint either way, quite drinkable, not very strong in any one respect but there is enough coffee bitterness to keep it interesting. I don't pick up much on the advertized chocolate side of this brew, but no matter. A very nice feel, creamy, very worthwhile on tap."
"I had this on tap at Gas Light Co. in Portsmouth, right next door to the Portsmouth Brewing Co. The beer has all the makings of a dry Irish stout. It is inky black, has a very smooth creamy off white tannish head. It doesn't have the efforvescence of a Guinness, but it does have the nose that points to chocolatey, roasted, and dry malts. The taste is unfortunate. It doesn't have the nice hoppy balance of a porter and it is really lacking the character of an Irish Dry Stout. It is dry, slightly bitter, but not nearly creamy enough, and just lacking an Hibernian character. This beer really isn't all that good and really doesn't do justice to the American Porter label either."
"Pours a dark brown color, nice carbonation nice little tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some toffee/chocolate notes. The taste is malty, slight hop note, with some toffee/chocolate. Medium body. Drinkable, this is not a bad brew."
"Overall, the best showing Redhook as made so far. Not great, but I would say it is decent and worth a pint if you have the chance."
"Drinkability: This is a good, rich porter to drink while sitting in front of the tv, having a conversation with someone, playing a video game, etc. It seems a little heavy to eat with, but a very good beer to enjoy while sitting back. Check this one out."
"D: High! This beer is very drinkable"
"Poured a black with a little coming through. Seemed thin during pouring, had a thin brownish-white head. Aroma was of hops with a slight hint of chocolate and malts. Taste was good, lots of chocolate, some hops and malts. Slight bitterness and aftertaste was of coffee, but good. Good mouthfeel, although thin for a porter. Not on the chewy side. Enjoyable, would not mind having a couple in a sitting. Six-pack may be a little much, it is on the heavy side."
"D: This beer was fine, but it's not all that inspiring. I'm not dying for more."
"Overall I'm not sure I'd want more of these. It's not bad, it's just... not flavorful enough, not enough to balance out the burnt flavor, and the mouthfeel is just too weak."
"Not special, but good."
"Appearance is a murky dark brown with a tan frothy tan head. Aroma is faint but I detect dark bitter chocolate and some smoke. Taste is much the same as the aroma with restrained hop flavor but moderate hop bitterness, interesting. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This is a decent American porter but it could use a bit more hop flavor and the mouthfeel was a bit thin. Overall a decent beer."
"Almost seemed like a stout to me with its flavors - but then porters are probably close enough."
"This was a downer, and not a very good porter. So many better versions exist--Arcadia's London Porter, Anchor Porter, Edmund Fitzgerald, Bell's Porter, Sam Adams Honey Porter, Bully!, and more just off the top of my head. I'd pass on this."
"overall i wouldn't purchase again, but was surprised by this one - not the same version of a porter i would expect, and definately hoppy in a good way"
"This porter isn't anything to write home about, although it makes for a great session beer."
"I won't be buying this beer again. Overall I'm disappointed. Although I've only rated 2 RedHook beers so far my memory of their other beers had me expecting more. Hopefully thinsg pick up a bit with their other ones. I'll keep trying them for now but I'm definitely done with the porter. Maybe I got a bad batch? This one is a little long in the tooth but not enough to completely tank the flavor I suspect."
"D- Unexciting, but the mouthfeel was nice and the body light to make this easily consumable"
"Tastes minty, blackberry, and woody english hops (so, I guess that would be Northern Brewer) over strong choclate malt over nutty with mild roasty character. The roast is borderline scorched and not particularly pleasant. Drying finish partly due to carbonation cleaning the palette. Aromatic grassy hop character rises up the back of the throat. Not terribly complex, but is drinkable. Md body with some silky. Carbonation is too strong for my preference of the style."
"Overall: Don't bother."
"This beer pours a very dark brown. The head is one inch in height, and recedes rather quickly into decent lacing. The aroma is of burnt malt with a touch of cream and chocolate. The taste has the nice burnt malt character of the aroma, but is much more mellow. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a high level of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent porter at best. It is weak in both flavor and aroma, but what it has is pleasant. I don't think I will drink this again."
"Notes: This beer is average at best, not something I would try again."
"D = Definitely drinkable. Indeed, it goes down very easily. Overall, I ended up rating this just above average in all categories. That is because it is pleasant and it is at least more distinctive than a large portion of the beers out there. But in the end it is not much better than average."
"D: This is a decent porter, and would make a good session porter, but it's not something to go out of your way for."
"Came out looking very good in a pnt glass, a nice dark color that still allowed a bit of light to come through. Pretty good head, although not much lacing. It had a nice coffee scent that accented the burnt malts. Nice flavor, a good deep porter with really nice coffee bursts. Goes down pretty well and is easy to finish. I've also had this in a bottle before and it was quite good that way, too."
"Poured a deep dark brown, with no noticeable head or apparent lace. Smell was very muted, lightly spice with a hint of caramel. The feel was flat, not enough carbonation for me on this one. Had a weird taste, caramel and coffee, mixed with a wet capet like aftertaste. Overall it is easily forgettable and nothing I will have a try at again I can assure of that."
"D - This really didn't impress me. It tasted okay but it was kind of weak."
"Upon first sip there was a very bitter hoppy taste, piney flavored. This is not a porter that I've ever experienced before. This is a porter for the drain of my sink. What a big disappoint. I a surprised that Redhook even put this swill on the market. This is the WORST porter that I've ever tasted!!! Why not call this an ""IPA Porter""."
"This is the way to experience this beer. The nitrogen enhances the experience immeasurably. If you find yourself in a location that serves Blackhook on a Nitro-tap, I suggest trying it, regardless of your previous experiences with this beer."
"Poured black with creamy head that it retained until the end. Nice lacing on glass, but little aroma. Very smooth with the proper amount of carbonation. Il liked it a lot. Tasted of roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. Mouthfeel was good, but possibly a bit on the thin side for a porter. Very drinkable."
"Pours black with crimson and scarlet tones. Solid, creamy, light tan head retains a bit; light-medium lacing. Aroma is molasses, caramel, coffee, and toasted nuts. Mouthfeel is silky, dry, and medium-bodied. Flavor is smooth, lightly sweet malts followed by rich roast, walnut, almond, and a hint of grassy sourness; taste on the whole is somewhat mild. A hint of dark fruits with butter round out the finish. Aftertaste is sweet, a touch sour, and dry."
"Not horrible, but I can't imagine choosing this porter over the countless others that have much more flavor."
"This has never been one of the exceptional beers in Redhook's lineup. I'm not sure why they keep this around and have let the excellend double stout disappear from the market."
"Pours black with minutely brown highlights at the edges, with a light collar of head. The nose is full of charred malt notes. It's relatively uncomplex -- just some touches of chocolate malt besides the charred, roasted malt notes. On the palate, it's excessively astringent and bitter from the malts, with flat, somewhat metallic ending. Mouthfeel is a touch watery, with poorly integrated malts. Overall, this is disappointing. It's certainly not terrible, but there's really no reason to seek it out, either."
"Blackhook Porter was a dark red-brown color with a light tan head. The head was quite large and had decent retention and left some lace behind. The aroma was sweet dark malt. The taste was dark toasted malt with dry finish. It was just less than medium in body with adequate carbonation. Drinkabity was average. It's a pretty average porter."
"d - easily drinkable, goes down fast which was a good thing for this beer."
"Light mouthfeel with subtle tartness. A nice pleasing taste,very easy drinking and enjoyable. A very good porter,delicious,would love to drink this beer again. Give this one a try!"
"Dark brown in color with a nice light tan head that stuck around a bit. Smell of sweet smoked malts, coffee and chocolate. Taste has roasted malts for sure with burned sugar/chocolate and a bitterness that sticks around a bit. A little light in the mouthfeel for my tastes in a porter."
"This beer poured a black color with a red tint  decent head that didnt stick around long. The smell is quite sour. The taste is malty and roasted with some bitterness. It has some spiciness. The mouthfeel is full but not heavy. This is a fairly smooth beer, and because it isnt heavy.lends itself to being fairly drinkable."
"Mouthfeel was rather thin with medium carbonation."
"Drinkability: Not a porter I'd sit down and love to enjoy all the time, but this isn't too bad. I like mine with more vigor, however, though if you're looking for an easy drinking porter this winter season, this isn't a bad one to choose in my opinion."
"I had an English pint of Blackhook Porter, drawn from cask at Redhook's Forecaster's Pub. The beer is an opaque dark chestnut brown with a light tan compact head. But, as with the other beers served here, the Porter is served fairly cold and it's difficult to pick up on the mild chocolate aromas. These appear later as the beer begins to warm. The head forms a nice lace as it retreats, and my first mouthful is tremendously smooth. This medium bodied, low carbonated beer is quite a noticeable improvement over the version served on tap. The taste is rich roasted malt with coffee and dark bitter chocolate tones. It is nicely balanced, however, and has a moderately bitter, but pleasant, finish. If this were kept on cask all year long, this might be the only beer Id drink from Redhook."
"This beer pours a dark amber, even somewhat blackish. Formed a nice 1 1/2 inch that left it mark on glass as it receded. Has a great smell picking up some black or chocolate malt. Doesn't have much body or mouthfeel to it, quite thin for a beer of this style. Has toasted notes, leaves you with a kind of burnt taste. All in all a good brew, just expecting more body from this style."
"A really nice find in a little convienence store in North Carolina, I just wish I had picked up a few more 6 packs of this outstanding porter."
"Pours a nearly pitch black color with some dark chocolatey brown notes. The head is minimal. Taste is robustly nutty and malty but still on the mild side for a porter. Very easy to drink with a nice smooth mouthfeel. One of the more simpler, easier porters without comprimising any wonderful flavor. I'm sure I'll be getting this again sometime."
"This would be a good crossover beer due to the inoffensive flavor profile. However, the lack of full flavor makes this a poor representation of a porter."
"The pour into my Fuller's nonic raises a tan one finger head over a super-dark brown glass that lets pass just a little ruby light at the edges. Lacing is pretty nice, although the head falls low quickly. Nose smells of light roast, a bit of creamed coffee, and perhaps a bit of burnt caramel. The taste is slightly roasted and acidic, sweet in the beginning, with a clean finish. The roast and sweetness mingle nicely together. Not much depth, but quite tasty. Mouth is on the thicker side, with tingly but fine carbonation. An easy drinking porter, and a nice intro to Redhook."
"had this on tap at Andy's tonight. Poors out a super dark brown, but with a slightly reddish hue to the edge of it. Not as dark as the normal porter. Creamy cappucino like head. Smelled of slightly roaste coffee, tiny bit of hops, not much else. Wehre's my embers? Where's the chocolate? I dunno. The taste closely mimmicks the nose, a bit of coffee, that's about it. Slight hops bringing up the rear. Finishes incredibly clean, but not surprising considering there wasn't much in the body to begin with."
"This beer is very delightful on cask at the Forectasters pub at the brewery. It is very dark, nearly black, with a creamy light tan, very foamy head. The head retains nicely and leave big lace around the glass. It has toasty, scarcely mocha smells, but theres not much in the nose. The first thing about the cask conditioned version is the terrifically creamy mouthfeel, it is a superbly rounded smooth substantial beer with the hops coming on slowly behind the darkly roasted malted barley tastes which are coffee, grainy, and tangy. The hops are unfortunately non-descript and seem to be doing more bittering than flavoring. The finish is medium length, and I think a more distinctive hop profile would go a long way toward fixing this. Its a very drinkable beer though, and on the low-side of the 5%-6% abv mark, so nearly a session beer. I think the casked version is much more drinkable than the other manifestations of this beer."
"Very Redhook-ish. Some good flavors, but typically undermalted, leaving the brew a bit bland. Weak aromas of roasted grain, toast, and caramel. Tastes similarly with a bitterness that more results from the roasted character than from hops. the malts fall away quickly leaving the beer watery and characterless. It wouldn't take much to make this beer a quality brew. Add more malts to bring the beer's gravity up to par with other good porters. A bit more of chocolate and coffee notes wouldn't hurt either. I'm still waiting on Redhook to surprise me with a great brew...I think they are capable of it."
"This is a fine, sessionable example of an American Porter."
"This would probably be an allright beer to give to someone who's never had a porter before, very mild in flavor. But if you've had some of the better porters out there i'd give this a pass."
"This goes down smooth and easy. There's a very likable quality in that. Also, this beer is easily accessible. However, I'd love to have a more complex flavor in my porters."
"Not to bad, taste a little to burnt to drink a lot of though."
"This beer seems closer to porter than some of Redhooks other beers are to their model styles. Solid work and quite drinkable."
"Easy drinking, middle of the road porter. Blackhook is simpler than many porters and makes a fine ""starter"" for someone unfamilliar with the style. Also, it could be me, but the East Coast version seems to be milder, while the West Coast version comes across as hoppier. I dunno. Anyway, it's worth a try, especially if you can split a six of this with the Redhook ESB. They compliment each other nicely."
"Medium mouthfeel and carbonation is spot on. Not too much not too little. Very easy drinking surprisingly."
"Dated on the bottle as 05.23.06"
"This was a dark brown beer with a coffee-colored head that quickly dissipated. Aroma was fairly nondescript: a little roasted grain/malt, not much else. Good porter taste, coffee, chocolate, and molasses. A little thin in the mouth, but still a nice beer and a good representation of a porter."
"Nice tasting beer, nothing great but a good drinking beer. This is a good session ale"
"Bottle label says: Portsmouth, New Hampshire"
"Cheers!"
"Black Hook Porter is a refreshing break from the six pack of blonds a day world and worth another look."
"Overall: A decent and inexpensive porter. Not the best by a stretch, but definitely worth a try."
"Drinks really easy, if you're pick about style guideline, you would pobaly still rate this a good brew, such as I almost did. I remember the late 90's early 00's version truer to the style"
"Overall this beer beer is a good thirst quencher. Perhaps it fits the Porter guidelines of the original Macro style."
"Pours a solid brown color with ruby hues at the bottom. Clarity is very good and a half finger head falls to a very light film over top of the beer. This one could stand to be a touch darker for my taste. Nose is light with roasted malt, with tones of nuttyness, and caramel, with a mild American hop tinge on the end. Flavor is quite a bit lighter than I expected. It starts moderately nutty and caramel sweet, moving to a pretty light roast, and finishing with a moderate hop bitterness that hangs on into the finish. There is not a lot in this one that lets me know it is an American Porter. The flavors are all fairly weak, with the roasted character being almost an afterthough. This reminds me more of a brown ale. Feel is moderate, with a light to moderate carbonation. Overall, this beer is not what I expect in an American Porter. The flavors are not strong or bold enough, the feel is a bit thinner than expected, and its just not everything I hoped it would be. I'll pass on this one again."
"Love dark brews, saw this in WalMart tonight and since I was in the mood for a gourmet beer figured I'd give it a shot. Color was a clear brown with a nice light caramel head that held and gave a nice feel on the palate. Could smell chocolate and roasted aromas also noticed some hints of fruit. Taste was light for a dark beer, not as thick as expected. could taste a hint of chocolate and something like roasted pecans. Went down smoothly, slightly creamy and left just enough bite at the finish. Would go great with a steak or grilled portabello. Not my favorite beer, but I would buy again."
"Overall, I would consider ordering this again matching it up to my dining choice."
"Aroma is malty with a hint of sharp hops and buried beneath that is a smattering of roasted chocolate malt. Dark brown with a smattering of head that mimics sea grass spread on a calm ocean. Initial sip has a bit of lager bite and thinness. Some muted malts and very little roast asspect. It is more in keeping with the older English style porters than the newer, roastier American style porters I favor. It's just not very satisfying it feels lagery."
"Light to medium body mouthfeel. A little watery. Nice carbonation. Pretty good overall. I will have no problem finishing the sixer I bought."
"Overall, i think this particular bottle is past it's prime for only being about 3 months old. This beer has a fuller flavor and fuller mouthfeel than this one bottle suggests. normally i like it, just not this one bottle."
"NOTE: The label and bottle have changed since the beer pic was taken."
"Brittle all in all and rather unsatisfying. Pennies. Not so drinkable, but passable in certain situations I suppose."
"Pours a coca-cola hue with a nice chocolate-tan head, that quicly dissiaptes. Smells promising - coffee bitterness, sweet chocolate, and some bready yeasts. Somewhat muted though. taste is faithful to the nose. Very satisfying porter, if a bit watery and mild. Definitely a nice 'every day' beer. Wish I could get them around these parts."
"Poured a deep brown, almost black color with slightly off-white head. Fell to an attractive coating. Smell is somewhat sweetish with only slight roasted malt noted. Taste is also on the swwetish side with a midertae hoopy botterness and a slight medicinal taste. Finish is more dry tahn malty and very attractive. A bit less than your average porter."
"Drinkability- Was dying of thirst, so at the time this was a 5 for drinkability. But, ordinarily this would still be a tasty drinkable beer. Almost has a cola like flavor."
"Pours a reddish brown coffee color with a slight tan head that didn't stick this time. I'll have to try another one later with a more vigorous pours. Smells of roasted notes and slight hints of coffee. Burnt nutty aroma and a chocolate sweetness is also present. I detect noble hops also. Taste is malty and nutty with bits of coffee and chocolate. Medium body with an earthy tone and there is something about this that makes it chewy. Aftertaste is a roasted or burnt coffee taste backed up with those earthy tones again. Solid porter in my mind and it is only lacking that head, maybe next time."
"I'm the kind of guy that likes that in a beer every once in while. I like a manly shit-beer thing sometimes. It just has to be real beer without all the added crapola. Anyway the mouth feel was a tad waterier than i expected but it wasn't much of a turn off. It is surprisingly drinkable to me. Definitely a step above your GOOD basic beer."
"cheers..."
"This pours a dark brown with a smallish white head.The smell is very faint and I could make out only a small roated malt aroma.The taste has a roasted malt flavor and a little bit of coffee,but it's nothing great by all means.The m/f is too light for this type of beer,but it is pretty well balanced.This is pretty much an average porter,nothing special,nothing great.I wouldn't turn one down,but I wouldn't go out of my way to get one either."
"Overall this beer has a nicely balanced taste."
"My first Redhook brew in a while, but not a bad one. I really enjoyed this beaut, especially the huge, fluffy head. It had awesome retention and lasted the whole drink. The smell was quite malty, with chocolate, some subtle spices, and roasted malts evident. Taste similar, but it also had elements of lights hops in the finish. All in all a good brew that didn't disappoint."
"One of the better American porters Ive had in quite some time. Its rich and roasty, and very drinkable, would make a fantastic session beer. Highly recommended."
"Drinkability: I session the absolute hell out of this beer on a regular basis. People have their 'go-to' beers that they like when they don't want something complicated, this beer is mine."
"How sad, one of the main reasons I bought this Redhook sampler case was because they don't sell this beer in six packs around here. Oh well, at least it was pretty cheap."
"Blackhook was a delicious example of a dark porter. The pour was a dark roasted color that produced an off-tan head. However, the head dissipated fast. The smell had a distinct roasted character with a slight undertone of sourness and chocolate. There was not any detectable hop nose, which makes me think this was not an American porter style. The taste was mellow with an even balance of sweet and bitter. The smooth feel of this beer caused me to take the time to savor the first sip and got many flavors in the aftertaste. The most prevalent flavors are that of roasted malt and chocolate malt. Overall, a great beer that is easy to drink."
"Pours a nice dark ruby and holds a good sized, slowly receding tan head. Has a slightly burnt roasty smell and taste and is lighter bodied than other Porters I've sampled although those were of the Baltic style. Not much carbonation. Finished smooth and proved to be, for me, a nice dinner beer that doesn't take over the meal."
"A drinkable porter, although it reminded me more of a sweet stout. I've heard it has a whole different flavor from the bottle, so I'll shall have to compare and contrast in the future. Nothing wow-ing here, but a solid brew. Probably my favorite from the Redhook Line now that Double Black Stout has bit the dust."
"Appearance is a burnt mahogany that allows a little light to peek through, coffee colored foam that leaves sticky lace. Aroma is a nice Starbucks Latte with hazelnuts and cocoa. Initial taste brings in the roasted grains, malt, dark chocolate and hops. Mouth feel is good carbonation. Medium body. Dextrin and malt remain sweet to the end, and the other flavors waft away  leaving a clean palate ready for food and/or dessert."
"Pretty light-bodied and easy to drink. Pleasant, enjoyable, but not outstanding. I probably won't bother seeking it out again, but it certainly not a bad beer."
" This is a very drinkable beer,3 or 6 would not hurt a man."
"Redhook is one of the rare micros that can be found in WV. We all know the story, so I tried to be open-minded when I sat down and had this, and just like the ESB it's a very nice beer. A nice chocolate flavor that is kept in check by a decent hop bitterness. While the nitrogen ruined it a little bit, it wasn't quite as bad as one might think, and I hope to give this beer a try in the bottle or on CO2 and compare."
"Had on tap at the brewpub. Very dark brown when served, came topped with 1/2 of thick tan head. Some metallic notes in the aroma. It would have been nice to try this as a regular(non-nitro) offering, as mouthfeel wise it came across as watery. Mostly low malt, with a roasty finish. Again: I think the beer would have come off better served non-nitro."
"I loved Winterhook, but my second 'hook' falls woefully short of what I would consider to be good beer. In fact, I'm fairly certain that in a blind taste test I wouldn't even identify Blackhook as a porter at all. Although there are too many major faults for it to be salvageable, cranking up the malt content would be a good place to start."
"Born on date 01/24/05. Pours a dark chocolate brown with a thin tan head. The smell of coffee and chocolate roasted malts are prevalent. Weak taste of chocolate and coffee malts with very little hop bite. To tell the truth, I am disapointed. Too thin for a porter in my opinion."
"OVERALL IMPRESSION: Yet another solid offering from Red Hook. Its very simple, balanced, flavorful, and quaffable, just like everything else they brew. Sort of like if your grandmother brewed beer instead of baking cookies."
"Drinkability: Despite my complaints about the beer, I enjoyed drinking it; it's a nice crossover beer into the style and it goes down nicely, with just enough taste to satisfy"
"Once again RedHook has made a very decent brew. It's definitely worth giving a shot."
"This is very drinkable porter indeed. Makes a great session beer. I do wish that the body was a little thicker, but I like this beer either way."
"Pours with a two-finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Deep red/amber color. Medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is roasted coffee. Bottled on 5/14/03 - now 19 months later and it tastes fine. Starts and finishes with a roasted chocolate/coffee flavor. $1.75 for a 12 oz bottle from Oliver's Beverages Albany, NY."
"Pours a very dark color with a small head that dies off quickly and leaves no lacing on the glass. Aroma of roasted grains and chocolate mostly, but fairly weak. The flavor is comprised of the coffee/roasted malts, chocolate and a bit of alcohol. Smooth and easy to drink. Seems like it could have a bit more body, but it's a good beer."
"This beer is lighter in color and flavor than almost any other porter I have tried. That might not be such a bad thing except that there were other flaws to this beer. Nose is roasted chocolate and coffee and maybe some alcohol. The taste begins with that roasted chocolate/coffee combo but its rather weak. Roasted barley comes and goes very quickly. Body is thin and hurts the flavors potential. The finish really got me though. It was buttery and had an alcohol kick. Really weird and something I did not enjoy. This beer seems to be really mainstreamed and maybe there were some problems with the yeast as well. Not something I'd go back to."
"thick body on this one, with the familiar, nitro smoothness. somewhat drinkable, but tone down the butter! (and i very rarely complain of butteriness, but this one was egregious.)"
"Pours out to a dark brown to black in the glass with a slight head. Aroma is that of roasted malt and coffee. The taste is straightforward malt with a hints of expresso and chocolate, albeit light. This would be a good session porter. Not too heavy and drinkable."
"Quite dark, brownish-black color with a thin tan head. Moderate to light lace. Aroma of roasted malts. Nutty and mealy smells mingle with that of smoke and coffee-grounds. Hops are notable throughout. Moderately sweet and malty, especially in the mid-taste. Occational metallic taste creeps in. Rather thin mouthfeel for the style. Easy-drinking and generally satisfying, but it didnt get me very excited."
"This isn't a bad beer, but there are so many other great porters out there to choose from. Ok for someone getting into beer, or in a pinch, but not something I would choose to drink again. On re-review 5/1/08 ($6.99 for a 6'er at Smith's in Albuquerque), the carbonation is better and the head retention is better as well. The mouthfeel is thin and cola-like, and there is alot of opening green hop bite and finishes with lots of burnt black patent. Definitely a west-coast version of a porter. Overall, it's a decent beer for the price, but not something I would care to drink very often."
"Black looking brew red highlights threw out, light tan head almost a off white head. Light coffee aromas with light sweet chocolatey malt coming threw. Taste is light burnt flavors and coffee with a burst of carbonation with light hop flavors and bitterness. Has flavors like a good porter but not as strong more like a watered down version of a good porter. Mouthfeel is also a little weak and light for a porter. Drinkability well it goes down smooth and easy so its drinkable but lacking the good flavors and body I was use too. Would not buy this again unless only other choice was macro swill."
"When I heard that Red Hook was partially owned by a macro company I had my doubts as to how good their beer could be. I ended up really enjoying Blackhook Porter, and am now eager to try the rest of their line-up. Appearance is dark coffee colored, head is fairly short and light brown. Smell isn't very strong, mainly roasted malts are detected with a slight whiff of hops. Taste is complex and balanced. Roasted malts are the strongest component of Blackhook's flavor; coffee flavor is noted. Hops balance Blackhook out nicely, and make a tasty note midway through a sip. Sip ends with more roasted malts, and a little more sweetness than before. I really enjoyed drinking Blackhook and look foward to trying their ESB soon."
"Wow was I suprised by this. Pours a dark black with a tan mocha head that is great to look at, lacing coated the glass. The smell is of coffee beans and milk chocolate, a marshmellow cream is detected, a slight hint of roasted barley. The taste is chewy and satisfying, up front is a nice coffee roasted grain taste and slight cream aftertones, a hint of hop brings up the rear, medium bodied and suprisingly good, will drink again."
"Huge head, lots of stick lacing on the way down. Body is translucent brown in color. The scent is very mellow, with hints of raisins and coffee beans. Tastes like a combination of a stout and a pale ale. Body was too thin. Has the flaws of most other RH beers."
"This pours out a nice deep black body with a tall light brown head. Minimal lacing is left after the head dies down. The smell is of roasted malts with a strong espresso presence. Otherwise I found the nose to be relatively mild but pleasant. Taste was of roasted coffee with a bit of smokiness and a touch of dark fruits. It had a bitter coffee aftertaste as well. Mouthfeel was good with nothing standing out except a bit of over carbonation. Drinkability was good as the taste was pleasant enough that I would definitely have one of these again. Pretty solid example of a porter not the best but good."
"Poured out a dark and rootbeery deep brown/black. There was a quick rising head that quickly reduced down to a tiny amount with mainly just a khaki ring around the edge a cloud in the center of the stubby pilsner glass. -Can't see through it. God, great aroma- could smell it while pouring, the scents just shot over to me! But for all that I could smell, the taste was not as intense as I was hoping for. Alot of carbination, bit of a disappointment there, too much for my tastes, felt like I was drinking a soda. Passed to a friend to try, asked what he thought about the carb, he said that he drinks soda through the day and that it was just fine for a soda-like carbination... Tastes of burnt toast and black coffee. Funny side note- A friends father who had swung by the bar happened to grab the bottle to try what was unpoured, grabbed a swig and said that it tasted as though it had gone flat. I found that odd since I was so put off by the high carb. I tried the bottle and noticed that when you drink from the bottle, you really do get a whole diffrerent mouthfeel..."
"Overall, though, a porter worth a try."
"Poured a deep and clear mahogany brown color with tinges of ruby coming through when held up to the light. A thin tan head with touches of redness covered the beer. The aroma is dark and rich with licorice and molasses, sweet dark chocolates and roasted malt. The taste is rich, roasty and flavorful, with some bittersweet chocolates coming through towards the finish. Light to medium bodied and overall a pretty nice porter."
"This is really quite drinkable. Oddly, the tap handle and point of sales never use the word Porter."
"Deep dark mahogany/ruby black color, thin cocoa brown head appears for a bit before fading to a thin collar and lacing sticks in spotty strings. Aroma has a slight burnt malt character to it with some singed sweet caramel and even brisker coffeeness underneath. Taste has a bit of crispness to it yet yields a smoothness thats enjoyable where it lacks in length it has some levels of interest. Blackened malts, a bit earthy, kinda burnt, mild sweetness from some caramel and vanilla cream, a bit astringent and chalky in the finish where slight coffee subdues but fades out quickly. Feel is close to medium, smooth over all with a crisp edge at first when cold, which is periodically left behind in some sips. Not as bold or as rich as it could be, seems to lack behind - more like its teasing you into thinking it could be good, go on take another sip, hmmm...nope still the same. Oh well, perhaps one of the better offerings by Redhook."
"What a drinkable beer! This beer has a very attractive appearance, good flavor (although, in fairness, it's probably not bold enough to be a great porter), and a smooth aftertaste. I don't detect any offensive aftertastes and the level of sweetness seems just right to me. It does taste a bit watery at the very end, but for my money, that contributes to the drinkability (if not to the mouthfeel). I very much enjoyed this beer and will certainly buy it again."
"A very nice tasting brew that has its flavors go right along with its aromas. A nice coffee/cappuccino flavor with hints of chocolate and roasted malts. Over all a real nice porter, one that I would get again!"
"Definitely a nice porter, enjoyed with some chocolates, very nice pairing."
"Poured into a pint glass, nice light brown inch tall head formed on a dark mahogany, nearly opaque brew. Large bubbles lead of heavy lacing, bonus! Heavy malty aroma, and a taste dominated by the dark malts, yet not overly bitter, which makes for smooth drinking. A easy drinking smooth quaff, seems to be what the porters of old were made to be."
"Sampled a bottle with a date of: 123003 and poured into a pint glass. A small tannish head developed and quickly faded after a few minutes and leaves very little lacing behind on the glass. The appearance is very dark like a robust porter. A chocolate, coffee aroma dominates the senses first hand. No hop aroma at all. First thoughts are something is not quite right. Some kind of rancid foul taste that is hard to describe. It also has a metallic aftertaste too. Mouthfeel is thin. I would like a thicker mouthfeel. After this first glass I don't think I will be asking for another. Too bad I have to finish off 5 more bottles."
"""Bottled on"" date of 121003--This one poured black with a dark tan head. Malt, yeast and bread dough in the nose. Some lace and tiny bubble film. Chocolate notes, burnt figs, toasted malt. Medium body, dry chalkyness, and then hops in the smooth finish. Decent porter."
"Very nice black appearance with a quickly dissipating head. Smell was malty and smoky, but slightly ""off"". Taste was initially sweet then had a bitter quality that lingered. Light to medium in body, it had a nice dry finish. Easy on the drinkability scale. A definite ste up from other Red Hook offerings I have tried."
"Let me mention one thing before I start. The few times I've had a porter on tap, it is always served chilled. When I buy bottles from the store, I tend to drink it at room temperature. I get more of the flavor. I'm told this tends to be the preferred way to drink a porter in some regions. I will have to find those areas. When I drink a dark beer on tap, I am all about the pour. Generally, Blackhook (depending on the skill of the bartender) will have a nice thick head that does not fade fast and has a sweet taste to it. The best quality of this beer for me is that for a lot of porters, I find after 2 or 3, my taste buds are shot or tired. But Blackhook does not tire out my senses. It may be because it is served cold, but it also does not happen when I drink from a bottle."
"Overall Impression: Man, I can’t get over that smell. Truly rancid, I don’t think I can get past the amount needed to judge it. Again, with the taste being fairly clean, I really think I got an ok bottle, but I may have to revisit this review just to be sure. Nothing to write home about, and since I can’t drink this one, drinkability has to be a 1. Ick!"
"Big, cookie-dough, beige, dense, pocked, imploding head. Black/brown beer with some red/brown held to the light. Psycho sticky, clumpy lacing. Mmmm... tangy, toffee, chocolate, hoppy nose. Yes! Tangy toffee, grainsy front before a malty! toffee, chocolate, thick middle. Bitter, hoppy chocolate in the finish. Very nice. Not as rich/creamy as some, but one of the best Redhooks, I think."
"A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut."
"Dark black color. Small tan foamy head. Aroma is coffee, chocolate and burnt toast. A light to medium bodied porter. Malts are chocolate and coffee, with a slight roastyness. Hops are slightly spicy. A little light bodied for a porter, the malt balance is right, but the mouthfeel is way too thin. There is a touch of vegetative flavor, not unpleasant but unexpected. Drinkable, but to light in body to be taken seriously as a porter. Mouthfeel is thin. Finish is clean and dry. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"There is no such thing as a bad porter, as far as I'm concerned. This one was pretty good. Dark brown, almost black in color with a thin tan head. There was a faint smell of coffee and chocolate. The taste was nice. a semi bitter, yet semi sweet taste that went down nice and smooth."
"Note: I drank this at room temperature, right out of the closet at about 62 F. Chilled review edit to possibly come soon."
"Prost"
"Drinkability: As graded, a very average porter. Many others are better and I'll be having one of those next time."
"Full-bodied, with coffee-ish tinges, but never rich enough for me. A bit too thin, I say. Not a terrible porter, but not terribly good, either!"
"Notes: One of the most drinkable porters in the US, give me some grilled meat or switch this beer up with some chocolates  or as a session beer, Ill take it either way."
"Tastes a bit malty with burnt malt undertones. A bit thin and watery. Taste leaves the palette quickly. Medium bodied but not much there. Weak flavored. Not bad, certainly drinkable but immensely boring. A forgettable beer."
"Agian, like the IPA, there wasn't a whole lot going on. Grainy malts once again, with a slightly roasted finish, a bit thin and boring, no length on the finish. Remeinded me of the IPA, with a slight hint of roasted malt and obviously darker in colour, pretty tame porter. (Cask- GBBF 03')"
"The aroma is of malt with some smokey sense, but not of an impressive nature. The flavor is a bit better, somewaht committed to its roasted malt body, but again not overly impressive. The body is deninitely light and a bit watery. Drinkable enough, it neither impresses nor offends and is light enough of an ABV to last awhile."
"Update  I thought Id re-review this with a 2005 bottle since I havent had it since September 2003. I pretty much found the same thing, except that the nose was a little less inviting. A drinkable porter, but not a very good one."
"Pretty much a classic robust porter, sticking to the style and not really breaking any ground. I thought the nitro was interesting, as there's not many porters served this way, but it really didn't strike me in any way as special, just good."
"On nitro tap at the Woodinville, WA brewery, this was a decent but tame porter. Deep black in color with a creamy nitro head, the beer looks very nice in the glass. Faint chocolate and hop aroma rises from the glass, but these flavors are only partially realized in the taste. Much of the character is stripped by the nitro, but the porter has a nice rich and creamy mouthfeel and is very easy to drink."
"A small sized tan head formed when this beer was poured and it had small-medium sized bubbles that quickly dissipated.The hue was black and the nose was malty.The flavor was that of coffee and the mouthfeel was smooth and light-medium bodied.This beer had good lacing to it."
"The beer pours a dark black color with a 1/4"" tan head. The aroma is of patent, chocolate, and roasted barley malts. The taste is good; a bit sweet in the beginning. There is a delicate balance between base and specialty grains. This beer has a whole lot of flavor. The mouthfeel is nice; not too carbonated. This is a full bodied beer that is a great sessions beer. A dark beer for dark beer lovers; complex, but highly drinkable and enjoyable."
"For all the porters that veer towards stouts, here is one that seems to be a very dark brown ale. There are not enough porters in the marketplace, but there are many better examples out there."
"I this this along with the Double Black Stout are the best from RedHook,this pours a deep brown almost black with a pretty creamy head,the aroma is not real strong a little muted,some bitter chocolate notes along with some woodiness.The taste is earthy and somewhat nutty with a light dryness,pretty tasty.Pretty drinkable for the style,could be a little fuller in aroma but not bad."
"Aroma is almost stout like in it's dark roasted quality and strong coffee overtones. Pours with virtually no head, and whatever was there leaves very quickly, leaving only a small ring on the outside. Almost black in color, with red hues when held to the light. Medium to strong in burnt quality of dark raosted malt flavor. Just hints of fruit and at times toffee, but nothering bold or outstanding. Bitterness level is on the mild side other than in the finish. Pleasant lingering taste that is mild and rather long lasting. Not particularly heavy, maybe even bordering on the thin side, yet enjoyable and lower in carbonation, but with enough to make it filling. Fairly tasty beer."
"This porter poured a very dark, black with hints of red if held to the light (almost opaque, but clear if held to a light). The foam was tan and creamy and long lasting. The smell was sweet, roast malt, with hints of caramel. The taste was slightly sweet: roasted malt, caramel, hints of coffee and cocoa, some chicory-like hop flavors in the background. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. The body was medium and the carbonation feel was low. There was a nice malty aftertaste. This was a very nice porter on nitro-tap."
"Dark brown color, with ruby highlights. Low, light brown head that disappears too quickly. Aroma of toasted malt and caramel, and a faint bit of hops. Flavor is of roasted malt and bitter coffee, plus highlights of cocoa and caramel. No aftertaste whatsoever. Mouthfeel is a bit watery, carbonation is very light. Not the perfect pint, but a very tasty, very drinkable porter."
"Very dark and poured very nicely by a barkeep who really knows what he's doing. It's nice to be able to try beers in different ways. It brings out different strengths. The tones were not as strong this way."
"Tasted: 06/11/03"
"I think this is a beer best described as a ""light porter."" As such, it is not heavy the way porters can be, and is ideally suited to the beer drinker not accustomed to porter. Give this to your Corona swillin' buddy to start him off on the road to redemption!"
"Despite its faults it like all RedHook products is drinkable."
"Poured a deep dark brown, virtually black in color, without much of a head - the bit that was there dissapated quickly to a thin film. Hearty, roasted nose, very malty with hints of burnt chocolate. The mouthfeel is surprisingly good, very smooth, low carbonation. The taste however is a little watery, not as full bodied as some of my favorite porters have been. A little coffee, cocoa, a bit of hops, not much going on here. But still, a drinkable porter that is cheap and while not the best, it ain't bad neither."
"Fairly easy to drink, but would not be my first choice for a porter. Perhaps a good beer to introduce people to the style."
"Less than average head espeically for a porter.Poured about a half inch and reduced slowly.Although,It did leave a solid wall of thick lace all the way around it didnt impress me.Opaque black in color.A sweet hop aroma that wasnt to strong.The mouthfeel was a bit watery and lacked somewhat in carbonation.Roasted malt flavors are quickly overshadowed by a long drawn out bitterness.A very average porter maybe even less than average.Maybe hints of smoke and coffee are noted but to hard to tell."
"This is the first mild dark beer I remember liking. It just goes down. It has a good backbone, nice balance of malt and coffee flavors. The Mouthfeel was grand yet easy, easy yet nice hops. This is by no means a fabulous beer, but this is solid. I guess the malt, hop, and coffee flavors are all well balanced yet clearly perceptible. I sucked down two bottles before I realized I had not written a word of this review."
"This beer poured a thin tan head that dissapated quickly. Blackhook seems to be a bit thin for a porter and it is also light colored for a porter, a bit lighter and it would let some light through. This makes it a much more drinkable session beer than your average porter. This beer is balanced more towards the bitter side but there are also tastes of roasted coffee. When I first served this from my fridge it seemed a bit tasteless but after the glass warmed up in my hand the flavors really came out."
"This beer came to the bar top a dark brown/black color that had a slight red hue on the edges when held to the light. The head was full, thick, creamy and tan in color, and the lace covered the side of the glass in rims and sheets. You could tell how much of a sip that you just took. The smells that came from this were not many, consisted of slight roasted malt, a light colored coffee (coffee that is served in your cup that is light in color d/t the cream that was added), and floral hops. The tastes that came to me were roasted malts, coffee, cocoa, light berries and fruit (very light) floral hops and a slight yeast flavor in the middle. This beer had a slight bite in the end and a floral hop aftertaste. It left me with a medium dry feeling in my mouth. A big thumbs up to the bar, they had the knowledge to serve this beer at a warmer temperature (felt like 65/67 degrees) which aided in the experience and made it worth while. I think at a colder temperature it would have lost a lot."
"This poured, looked and smelled like a pot of black coffee. There was no head, just a couple of errant bubbles. The color was pitch black without a hint of light. Blackhook's smell was pure roasted, columbian coffee; very deep and earthy. It tasted chalky and dry with serious espresso and coffee notes with just a little bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was very interesting. It was thin enough to be a pale ale or a bitter without any of the thickness of a porter. This was a very cool interpretation of a English porter. I will definitely buy more of this in the future."
"Pours out real dark with a beautiful head. Nice flavors in this beer. Mmmmmm... It has some solid hops and some solid malty goodness too. Feels great going down. Wet and dry all at once. This is a beer that I could drink all night, and have! Thank you Deacon for hooking up some brews down at Redhook."
"Nothing special at all in this beer. Has a relatively attractive appearance: Black and thick but pours a miniscul head. Flavor is weak: Just another porter type flavor, though it does have a heavy emphasis on sweet chocolate. Other than it is your typical porter, nothing more and nothing less."
"Brownish black....minimal tan head...nose is roasted grains...some sweet cocoa..nose somewhat subdued...I love the taste...some swweet chocolate mixed with dark baking cocoa..smooth and creamy...very drinkable if a bit thinnish...one of my favorite every day session porters.."
"A pleasing deep ruby red to almost brown color on the pour with an impressive head that dissolves into thick clinging sheets of lace that obscures the glass. Nutty sweet nose with malt, caramel also present lightly toasted or coffee aromas. Quite a sweet start, almost too much with the top being skinny and the finish nicely hopped, fair carbonation, dry aftertaste and a fair to middling porter, nothing special."
"For food recommendations...a thick, char-grilled burger would do well...maybe with some onion rings to bring out the sweet undertones of the brew."
"very dark....could be described as black. little head and lace and very little carbonation. almost no nose at all, just a hint of dark roasted malts. a nice pronounced hoppiness wafts up, too. a very smooth mouthfeel, no pronounced bitterness from the malts or hops, just a fairly dry and clean finish. some dark chocolate notes in the flavor profile...a hint of coffee too. really doesn't seem like a porter, has more of a ""roasted"" stout feel to it without the bold bitterness...the bottle proclaims that it is microfiltered and you can tell. seems a bit thin...in flavor too. this is a very easy drinking porter and would be an appropriate intro brew for those just getting into the world of porters and stouts. a good nightcap on a cold northern october night."
"The label says this is ""dark, but not bitter."" Well, they got that right. The beer is a dark brown color. The smell is relatively subdued, with notes of maltiness. The taste is of coffee, roasted malt and perhaps a hint of hops. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. An incredibly easy drinking porter. Would make a solid session beer if you like 'em dark (but not bitter)."
"What the f...?  This is a porter??  By every other measure this is a Guinness, it looks like one, it pours like one and they sold it as one.  The aroma was markedly different, and the taste was as well, sweet, honey and  coffee.  But a porter? This was pure cream and a quick, easy drink.  Not bad, but kind of misleading on tap."
"A great porter.  Very drinkable and complex, forward flavors.  Enjoy, repeat.  Cheers!"
"This beer is a dark ruby color.  A thin brown head recedes to an edging rather quickly.  Sweet caramel, burnt malt, chocolate and coffee tones are all perceived on the nose.  Very nice.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth and creamy.  Low carbonation.  I like the bitter aspect of this porter.  Coming from blackened malts and hops.  Nice chocolate taste as well.  Body is medium at best.  A little thin.  Overall this is a solid porter."
"Mind you, as I write this, I'm a hop head, so if my review seems poor it is for that very reason. But this beer is in fact a drinkable one. With it's robust dark color and full chocolaty roasted flavor makes this a decent porter. The head showed up for a bit, but then quickly faded. The flavor tends to stick around in the pallet for a bit to give the mouth a pleasent feeling. After drinking this porter, this beer certainly helps op-en my mind to enjoy more thick beers similar to this."
"Not bad for a beer from a Budweiser owned company.  Pours with a average creamy head and has a deep dark look.  Not much aroma to speak of and the mouthfeel is lacking.  But had a pretty good taste though not up to par with most porters i have had.  A very drinkable porter for the novice......CHEERS"
"Minimal head and lacing.  Nice coffee-like aroma.  Dark brown to nearly black in color with a nice roasty chocolate flavor.  Not as good as the Sierra Nevada Porter, but an excellent buy for a couple of dollars less than the SN."
"Enjoyed on a nitrous tap.  Poured black with a nice white creamy head that lasted all the way down the glass.  Smell was very weak with undertones of roast malt.  Some bitterness in the flavor and mainly roasted malt without any kind of subtle complexities at all.  Creamy mouthfeel and fairly drinkable.  Rather thin for a robust porter."
"I have not sampled many different porters and in fact bought this one because I am a fan of all beers Redhook.  That being said, I like Blackhook.  This is a richly-flavored beer that begins with strong chocolate and coffee notes and finishes with a smooth flourish of hops.  Its aromas are of coffee and chocolate, the former dominating.  Its color is quite pleasing, being a deep red brown with a caramel-colored head."
"This Porter starts out subtly chocolatey and finishes with just a touch of pleasant hop tang...I like the finish more than the initial taste...nice color, actually a little darker than other Porters that I prefer on taste...Blackhook has always been a consistent good choice to me, but not a ""must-have"" Porter..."
"Notes: This is one beautiful porter, great blend of flavours to make for a very drinkable ale. It has been brewed longer than you think, since 1983!"
