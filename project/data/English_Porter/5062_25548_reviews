"Light roast and dark cocoa malt in aroma. Nice, chocolatey flavor, nutty malt backbone, with a lightly bitter finish. Great example of the style, albeit a touch sweet."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - I think my bottle might be a little out of date.  Unless the sour milk/oyster type flavour in intentional?  A decent beer but the 750ml format is not ideal for me.  Worth a try."
""

"The tasting notes on this one are spot on. It definitely has the big malty flavor and the bit of astringency on the finish. It's color is a very dark brown which can just barely be seen through when light is shown through."

"Overall:  I'm a porter fan, and this one really hits the spot.  It has good complexity where it needs it, but remains highly drinkable.  This is a great beer."

"None the less, a very good porter, and a must try for porter fans. Definitely has a strong malt profile which gives quite a character to this porter. It's not the best, but it's not too miss either."

"O- One of the best in its class."
"Overall: Smooth and classy but relatively straightforward. Good representative of the style."
""
"O-Excellent porter, a bit stout like. Quaffable but with a lot of body, and complexity"
""
""
""
""
"O: a very nice porter, English-style, naturally - very enjoyable and robust"
"O - my favorite London Porter.. I love meantime and this is a gem from them. Just a grand English porter."

"I really enjoyed this brew!"

"Poured into a pint glass, great full tan had developed that retained and laced well. Appeared a dark cherry / ebony color with a nice chocolate and toffee aroma with hints of wood and smoke. Had a strong roasted nut and chocolate front, dry and a bit sweet, with a dry earthy finish. Mouth feel was full and silky with a dry malty aftertaste."
""
""
""
"Beautiful dark mahogany pour with a three finger foamy beige head with great retention and nice lacing. Big roasty nose with hints of cocoa, toffee, milk chocolate, leather, caramel, black cherry, and some fairly strong metallic notes. The taste follows suit with lots of roast and chocolate along with hints of tobacco, toffee, subtle smoke, cocoa, and black cherries. Unfortunately, the metallic aftertaste totally takes away from all the pleasant aspects of this beer. The mouthfeel is disappointingly thin and lacking any body. The finish is bitter and metallic. Overall, this beer started off promising, but the metallic aftertaste dominated the experience. I'll stick to the Meantime Chocolate Porter..."

"Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass, with thin, light brown head that dissipates quickly to a thick ring around the glass with nice lacing. Aroma of toasted malt, chocolate, slightly nutty. Flavor is light toasted malt with some hints of milk stout lactose, vanilla, nuts and a hint of coffee; finishing with light charred coffee, hops and toasted malt. Medium bodied. Flavors are slightly subdued, but very nicely melded and complex. A classic English style porter. The aftertaste lingers for quite a while and invites another taste."
""
"O: This is a seriously old school take on an historic ale style, but it may be a bit intense for fans of contemporary porters. Very turbulent and challenging. Somehow not as satisfying as I expected it would be, but still pretty good."

"O: This is an incredible brew. Balanced yet strong notes with a wonderful down-the-hatch feel. Porters often attempt to be this good, but so few really are."
"I have tasted porters often and would like to like them but seldom do. This porter however is one of the absolute best I've ever tasted hands down. Had it fairly recently for the first time at the Meantime pub / brewery in Greenwich, London, UK on draft and I was totally blown away. More recently found a 750 ml bottle at a local favorite supplier in Durham, NC. Today, I cracked the cork and noted a little bit of a pop but not much. Aroma was outstanding and definitely reminded me of my original draft tasting at the brewery. I poured it into my Meantime pint glass from the original tasting, it was wonderful. On a full steady pour, color was dark brown chocolate with lighter brown 1"" head. Foam was very tasty and subsided over a reasonable time. Overall taste and experience in drinking this porter as a draft and bottled product is awesome. When the mood strikes for a porter, I'm looking for this fine offering from Meantime on draft in London or in the 750 ml bottle here in the USA. Happy to finally have a go to porter!"

"Taste-Coffee and cream, caramel,toffee, faint charred bitterness in the finish. Nice depth of flavor and character. A classic English porter and a fine match for a steak or burger."
""
"worth a try for sure, what one would expect from and English Porter, I picked this up for 7$ and I have a feeling it was priced wrong by just looking at the big corked bottle."
"O - this is a proper porter, malty and rich but light and very drinkable, looking forward to trying more from this brewer as I just saw them on Calgary shelves"
"The medium body is perfectly sized to the style. My main issue is that the carbonation is really lively; it's not spritzy or big-bubbled, by any means, but it's really foamy. Otherwise, it's a lesson in how to make a porter just as robust as it needs to be without being too strong."
"Skip this and have the coffee version instead."
""
""
""
"Overall: not bad, but not interesting, the definition of average"
"While not the chocolate overdose of some new world offerings, that is the whole point. This traditional incarnation displays the sour milk, and old castle trappings of smoke, coffee, and leather, doing so with a traipsing elan, one more and more easily found these days, thankfully."
""
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color porter with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of floral coffee notes with some dry and lightly bitter roasted malt and some subtle dark chocolate notes. Taste is also dominated by some floral coffee notes and some subtle black chocolate notes with some dry roasted malt notes also playing a major role. Light residual sugar can also be detected with no astringency and good balance overall. Body is average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Solid rendition of the style with good balance overall."

"I strongly recommend against pairing this with Italian of any sort, anything that is sweet or overly acidic, contains tomato or citrus, is a ""light""-tasting food, or seafood. It may possibly be paired with raw oysters, mussels, and clams, at your own risk (for symphony and synergy in taste), but it is not a pairing that screams at me, as do the pairings with spicy meat dishes and carbonized steaks."

"Original porter with its own character. Excellent beer and definitely far from boring, I drank the whole 750ml and it was pure pleasure until the last drop."
""
""
""
"Drinkability/Overall: A fairly complex beer that I enjoyed; Somewhat ""one-sided"" though."
""
""
"Overall- I graded this as an ENGLISH PORTER so although thats not my favorite branch of stout/porter this one IS awesome at nailing that style. If you like English Porters with their bitter/almost sourness and very roast malts I'd say grab this one for sure."
""
""
""
"O - A tasty porter that offers up a tasty balance of sweetness and bitterness, solid flavour profile and easy drinking. It's rich, yet easy drinking, making for a great session ale. Will grab another bottle before this disappears from the shelves."
""
""
""
"Light body, high carbonation, slightly sticky on the lips."
"Rather nice, though falls short of perfection. Perhaps it's a little too old (despite being in date). Nicely presented in a corked/caged champagne bottle, and looks appealing in the glass. The aroma has a satisfying depth to it; the flavour slightly less so. The mouthfeel could be a tad more viscous. A tasty brew that goes down nicely, but could perhaps have a more defined roasted malt character. Nonetheless, a quality porter that is well worth trying."
""
""
"Deep brown colour, just over one finger of tan/beige head, some lace. Smell is of roast and black liquorice, coffee beans, cocoa beans, light but present earthy/leafy hop. Taste is roasty with black liqourice/anise, chocolate and coffee, medium bitterness mid palate, finish is nice and roasted and lingers around in the aftertaste. Light-medium carbonation, medium full body, nice solid feel. Quite a good porter, quite drinkable but this didn't blow me away, I could drink another glass of this again though."
"Overall, I feel as though I am drinking an authentic English Porter and tasting a piece of brewing history. A very flavorful, enjoyable and easy drinking porter."
""
""
"Dark brown, almost blackish, with deep red hues. Tan head with good density, webbed lace and pretty heavy retention. Nose has some dry chocikate notes, some mild fruity makt sweetness and a bit of caramel. Taste has more chocolate, light roasty sourness, and drying dark malt flavours. Light coffee bitterness in the finish. Medium body, and lower medium carbonation. Decent porter, unspectacular however."
""
"Overall, a tasty porter. Quite nice."
"If you're looking for a classic English porter look no further than Meantime London Porter. This offering has all the quintessential characteristics of the style and can compete with Fullers, Sam Smith, St. Peters or any other brand you care to name. And best of all: it comes in a 750ml bottle!"

"(I'm secretly wondering if this was a mislabeled keg of their discontinued(?) Coffee porter)"

"750 ml bottle into tulip glass, best by 4/19/2012. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, nuttiness, roasted malt, toffee, coffee, toast, and light herbal hops. Very nice and pleasant aromas with good strength and balance. Taste of chocolate, roast malt, caramel, nuttiness, toast, biscuit, coffee, toffee, earth, and herbal hops. Moderate herbal and roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, toast, coffee, nuttiness, biscuit, and earth on the finish for a short bit. Great flavor balance and robustness, with good complexity and no cloying flavors. Medium carbonation and body; with a fairly creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel that is very nice. Alcohol is well hidden as expected of 6.5%, with pretty much zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent porter! Great robust roasted flavors with nice complexity and balance; and very smooth to drink. Highly enjoyable porter, an easy winner in my books."
""
"Pours a clear dark brown with a dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt and burnt coffee bean aromas. Taste is much the same with some slight cocoa bean flavors on the finish. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip along with a slightly acidic tartness. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but much different than other porters I have had in the past."
"Pours a rich deep brown color bordering black. Off-white khaki colored form forms and leaves plenty of lace on the pint. Aroma of coffee, roasted malts, dark bread, and floral notes. In the flavor, roasted malts, dark chocolate, mild coffee and a mild bitterness. Even and roasty profile like a good porter should be. Medium bodied, medium carbonation for a loose easy drinking feel. Overall, a pretty nice robust export porter. Was nice with smoked pork and deviled eggs."

"3.5 D: Tasty, easy drinking beer. It's a little pricey, but I'm glad I bought a bottle."
""
"Overall. It's great. I'll be looking for this one again."
""
"O: Not a bad porter but oddly subtle and very thin mouthfeel with high carbonation. Feels and tastes more like a 4-5% porter than a 6.5%. Certainly drinkable at least!"
""
""
""
""
"D - 3.5 - the pleasant flavor combined with the lightness or mildness make it very drinkable, but one would possibly want something with a deeper flavor."
"Overall / Drinkability: A very nice English porter. Overall the beer is quite tasty, very drinkable (I wish I had another 750mL to split with the Mrs.) and went fantastic with a cottage pie for dinner. Definitely better when warmed up, but still pretty good when cold and first poured. My only comment which makes me wonder about this beer is that on the label it says ""bottle conditioned"" but there is no sediment at all in this beer, and, the beer is too clear when held up to the light - so where did the bottle conditioning yeast go? Or do they mean something else by bottle conditioned here? Regardless of this minor mystery, a very good porter and something I could easily pick up again despite the price. I must find a way to have it directly from a cask should I ever get the chance."
"A pleasure to try, thanks TATURBO! Chocolaaate."

"You know Maybe I am not a big Old english recipe Porter Fan! There is a sh*t load of better domestic porters on the market like Firestone reserve Porter, Deschutes Black butte porter, stone porter, rogue mocha porter, etc. Please try these first, there fresh and better!!"

"Roasted malt flavors greet the tongue. Light coffee bitterness mixes with dark chocolate richness. Some fruity esters percolate through. Earthy, mineral-y notes near the finish. Lingering chocolate and roasted bitterness. Medium-bodied with a lively, bottle-conditioned feel. Delicious and very drinkable."
"Deep, dark brown and a a thick half finger of chocolate/tan head that was espresso like. Nose is a light mix of roasted barley, dark chocolate/black patent malt and dark roasted coffee. The carbonation level is low and smooth. The roasted malts are at the forefront and then a nutty, coffee and chocolate cream middle comes out. A small amount of sour/bitterness comes through transitioning to the finish which is a dry and full of roasted barley and bakers chocolate. I was expecting the creamy middle to pull through for the finish but it was thin."
"Overall this is a great porter."
"Pretty good overall."
"Mouth feel is rather watery, despite the generous carbonation. A little drying/warming alcohol at the end."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and silky with a thin carbonation and a body that is approaching full. Not a bad beverage at all. I wish the malt flavor lasted longer but it's still a tasty brew. Well worth checking out."
"Pours a cola brown, with a light brown creamy head, with 2 fingers worth. Lace is fantastic. Aroma is very roasted, with a dry cocoa note, a nuttiness, and slight caramel notes. Taste is more chocolaty, light sweetness, roasted malts and a hint of candied sugar. Body is very creamy, medium at best. Feels good and goes down smooth and creamy. Drinkability is great. This is a solid daily drinker...wish it came in a smaller, cheaper bottle though..."
"I had this beer at NERAX cask fest in Boston in the spring ('11) and had to search it out. It's a very tasty beer that's a great example of the style."
"A dry elegant brew, good with cheese, ham etc."
"Im usually a big fan of Meantime's different brews. This one however is definitely not their best effort. Honestly this is an extremely average porter, however it is not bad. When poured I noticed the light amber brown color, the minimal froth and lace. The aroma was typical of a porter and was not impressive, nor was the taste. A typical run of the mill porter."
"O: Very good quality beer. Really easy to drink."
"O- Very easy to drink. Very nice porter. Will definitely seek out another."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink because it's lighter in body but still quite flavorful. I would have no problem drinking more than one of these in a sitting."
"Great beer, good friends - who could ask for more?"
"O - This is an extremely drinkable Porter, with a complimentary bitterness and balanced smooth taste profile. Definitely drinkable on its own or as a session."
"Overall: Nice, very classic traditional Porter."
"Light bodied, too much carbonation. Not impressed with this beer."
"Poured deep, deep red/mahogany with a nice two-finger off-white head that retained well and left very nice lace. Strong roasted coffee aromas with plenty of semi-sweet chocolate to back it up. Toss in some dark cherries. raisins and toast to create a complex, well-balanced profile. Flavors follow, with the coffee taking enter stage, the chocolate more subdued and the dark fruit coming forward. Medium body, more carbonation than expected, and a smooth, slightly watery mouthfeel. Not sure when a porter becomes a stout, but this has to be close."
"Very delicious...almost like sitting in a cafe sipping on a cup of coffee considering the taste...the smell alone lets the drinker know its going to be tasty and its well balanced where its not bitter nor tasteless but medium bodied with a load of tastes. Very recommended"
"Overall: Damn good beer with plenty of flavor that is very well done. I've had this one aging for over a year and it's kept very well. Definitely worthy of its rating."
"This is an absolutely cracking beer. I only gave it 3 days to settle and I think it would age fabulously. Wel worth a try and it's given me the taste for porters again after spending 3 weeks in san fran where all the porters are one-dimensional, coffee-packed, water-thin rubbish."
"Drinkability: it is very drinkable and I enjoyed it. I was just surprised by the level of chocolate."
"Overall the flavors and the aromas were complex and well balanced. This was a great pick from the local store and I have to say that I would buy it again. What is different about this porter is that it has a light body for a porter and in no way does this negatively affect the beer. Great offering here from Meantime."
"Bottle. Cracked this one open to a very surprising gushing of tan foam shooting out of the bottle, truly was not expecting that! Poured into a tulip glass a dark, murky reddish tinged brown color with a big fluffy tan head that leaves lace as it settles. Dark fruit, roast coffee, sherry, and slight leather in the nose. Med/light mouthfeel that due to the carbonation leans toward the light side for me. Light roast coffee flavors gives way to some dark fruit sweetness and then ends with a slight bitterness. Some alcohol faintly noticeable in the taste. Overall, I'm a little ho-hum on this one, the over carb and light body aren't doing any favors for it and the flavors are pretty subtle."
"Extremely drinkable and, if Martyn Cornell's studies on Porter are correct, mostly true to that being brewed during the middle of the 18th century in London. Rather complex yet marvelously easy-going, the 6.5% ABV doesn't really show itself unless drinking it in quantity over a brief period. The price point (this particular bottle came in at $7.99) is a bit high, but the experience is worth it."
"D: Quite drinkable, warming, filling, and satisfying. This porter is recommended. The bottle is lovely as well -- a thick, heavy champagne bottle with the meantime clock emblem on the neck (""Brewed for flavour, brewed with style"") and a well-designed label. I'm impressed."
"Body was kind of thin, but the carbonation made it kind of creamy which made up for it a little bit. Pretty easy to drink, although not as cleanly or strongly flavorful as I would have liked. Still, a solid beer, and I wouldn't mind having this again."
"D: This is definitely uinque compared to the English porters I've had thus far. This is a wonderful brew made great by its subtleties and nuances and features one of the best chocolate flavors I've yet experienced."
"The flavor is really quite bland. Really mild with a touch of diacetyl. Really faint chocolate is there as well. Other than that, some roasted malt and that's about it. Body is quite light and carbonation is a bit low. Drinkability is okay, but overall there isn't anythin really impressive about this brew."
"Chewy medium body with soft carbonation up front along with a nice roasty malt flavor. There's a slight lactic cream presence that compliments the chocolate malts as well as hints of caramel, hazelnut, oatmeal and toffee. Slightly smokey with a dry finish."
"The taste is spot on. It's a creamy, fairly full bodied affair, with lots of heavy fruits, chocolate cherry, and oakiness, some roasted notes, some sweeter malts in there too. The taste is very complex. There are the darker malts balanced nicely against the cherry chocolate, the oakiness, the dark berry flavors. This is really good. There is a touch of Old English butterscotch in there too. Really complex stuff, with each sip a slightly different experience, just the way it ought to be. This is well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"M/D: Very effervescent, smooth, velvet-y. I could drink this all day and not get bored. Expensive, but worth the $$$. The best English porter I've tasted yet."
"At the time of this review, this beer was #10 on the Top English Porter list."
"The taste confirms the roasted maltiness and a nice balance with a unexpected smokiness. I am surprised how light bodied the beer is. I did not expect this from a porter. A little overpowering sweetness, but a nice and very drinkable beer."
"I do like the cork system with the nice red label around the neck."
"D-Not bad, but I was expecting a little more from this one. Not sure on how old it is either as there isn't any clear dating on this bottle."
"D- all 750ml goes almost too easily. very drinkable."
"A very big beer for the style - blind tasting I probably would have put this in an American porter style, or perhaps even a stout. Loads of roasted caramel malt, with a bit of sweetness and a smokey (but not peat) aspect vying against one another for attention. Perhaps a tad thin at the end, but a very enjoyable beer."
"D - This is a very enjoyable porter. It's definitely from across the pond and delivers a great roasted malt character with very restrained hops and the fruity esters present. The carbonation seems a bit high to style, but it is bottle conditioned and may have sat for a while. This is somewhat remarkable because I don't really get much in the way of oxidation."
"D: Great all around Porter. Really, quite good indeed."
"Nutty and roasty with just the right amount of sweetness. Fruitiness ranges from dark to medium with even a bit of strawberry tartness. Chalky minerals round things out and showcase what an English Porter is all about. Full bodied and displays an elusive creaminess that is very much appreciated. One of the more expensive English Porters out there (I paid $12 for a 750), but certainly worth the splurge every now and again. Delicious beer and a prime example of the style done right."
"D- A great example of a porter, just the wateriness that draws back from it"
"Color: brownish red. Good lacing. It has aroma and flavor of chocolate (heavy), coffee (heavy) and caramel. Light beer and tasty. Nice drinkability. Medium bodied and with alcohol in the right measure. Could be a more potent beer, but it is very good!"
"Pretty carbonated, a bit overly so, with a clean finish. Might be a little light bodied, but good overall. There are better examples out there."
"Overall, this kinda sucked. Would never buy another product from this brewery because this was a totally avoidable mistake. The beer isn't infected, it's just carbed like Pop Rocks. Like Old Faithful. Like Alka Seltzer. Decent potential ruined by sloppy carb."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with an off-white head. The aroma is roasted malt with some earthy hops and some astringency. The flavor is roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and some nuttyness. I also get some earthy hops. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Na Zdravje!"
"drinkability: a nice evening sipper. I enjoyed."
"I really liked the nose and flavor of this beer, but the carbonation was just over the top and ruined it for me."
"Very complex. The initial taste revealed sweet flavors of pastry cream and chocolate. Then sweetened dark coffee followed by a meaty quality like beef jerkey or a smoked leg of something. Dry roasted flavors with a slick mouthfeel. Lots of chocolate toward the finish but not sugary at all. Good Co2 sends the flavors along. Very well received."
"D: I love English/London porters and this one is no different. With a more robust mouthfeel this one could rival Fuller's since the taste is there. A must buy, I don't know why I waited so long."
"Overall, excellent balance of drinkability and style."
"Notes: Interesting beer. Apparently this is more like a traditional porter. Much more earthy flavors and tart and dark fruit as well with less of the roasted, chocolate, and coffee taste. The flavor was a little thin, but there was a diversity of flavors. Interesting beer that was pretty tasty, but nothing really special. Worth trying if you can find it for a good price."
"drinkability: heavy and a touch dry, not something to drink willy-nilly. something to savor, yet easy enough for a session beer."
"Drinkability is good - this is a little stronger than many porters so I'll drink a couple of these, but I won't drink them all night."
"Aroma is quite strong, smoky and coffee-ish with a firm overtone of unsweetened chocolate and a hint of brown sugar. It pours a dark warm brown with a fairly thick and persistent light tan head. Flavor is smoky with good tones of fine roast coffee and unsweetened chocolate along with hints of molasses and a touch of spice. Texture is smooth, a bit thick, and somewhat fizzy."
"English porters are not normally my cup of beer, but Meantime makes a mean London porter. Thank you very much."
"D - Pretty easy to drink, but think it might get filling quickly."
"11.2 oz bottle erupted when I popped the cap. Poured with a 3+ finger head into a duvel tulip. Body is a dark brown with a red tint. Head is a nice foamy tan with some lighter streaks. Some lacing. Smells of coffee, roasted wood and...what the hell, tree bark. Taste is definitely coffee, roasted malts. You know the smell of the tip of a stick after you've roasted a dozen or so marshmallows on it - toasty, sweet? That taste is in there too. Mouthfeel is good - wish there was a bit more to it though. Very drinkable, delicious beer."
"750 ml caged and corked bottle. Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with about an inch tan head. Head retention is good, lacing is decent. Aroma is very sweet and malty, it smells like chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, nuts, and brown sugar. Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like smoked and roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and a bit of caramel and dark fruit. Starts off sweet, then has a bitter and dry finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating with good carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good, it's smooth and very easy to drink. If I had another bottle of it, I'd drink it now! I think this is a good overall brew, I'll definitely be buying this again."
"Overall, not bad. I would really like to try the coffee porter, as I'm a huge sucker for coffee beers."
"This beer along with the Meantime IPA are two of the best British ales to ever hit my tastebuds! KUDOS to them!"
"F: Finishes pretty sweet still, with lingering brown sugar and smoked malts. Some light bitterness comes through well, but still battles that sweet malty flavor. A lingering earthy bitter flavor adds a nice finish but an almost metallic flavor takes that addition away. The smoked malt addition is very nice."
"pour of coca cola... ruby in the light and a somewhat large head of very light brown. nose light of chocolate and coffee... equally matched with maltose and a nice apple fruit. a bit bready. palate is a bit toasty and a much harsher carbonation than expected. delutes the palate. marginalizes all the wonderful stuff that in the nose. probably wonderful after two years of storage."
"Mouthfeel is medium body leaving a bit of coatiung which deducts from its drinkability"
"A very, very nice example of the style. It attempts to provide the drinker with a feel for the older, original British porters using this beer. It's not hard to see why this style can be well-rounded if done right. Excellent."
"D: Kip says, ""thats pretty smooth, I can keep drinking it."" Agreed, goes down quite smoothly as I would expect from 6.5% and is a very enjoyable porter. Excellent example of the style!"
"D: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. It has a unique mix of flavors that kept me coming back to my glass. The mid-range ABV makes for easy drinking. A very nice pickup."
"Utimately a very good beer that is light on slight on complexity and velvety texture but is also flawless in it's design and exectution. Probably a slight dip in quality compated to Fuller's London Porter."
"D- Definitely enjoyable. Comes together as a light, smooth beer with enough flavor. It does feel a bit weak on flavor after the first few sips, but still a good drink."
"Drinkability: I'll try one more bottle but that might be it. Sorely disappointed in this porter"
"D = This is a very flavorful beer for how drinkable it is. It just flows down and I want to keep drinking. Doesn't get cloying too fast as sometimes happens to me with porters."
"This beer is very drinkable and uncomplex for a porter. Unfortunately, this means it does not have the depth of other london porters, such as that of Fuller's."
"I've now had the London Porter and the Coffee Porter. Both leave good footprints in my memory, though the Coffee Porter's is a larger imprint (not that this is bad). But if you're looking for a taste of the past, this is for you."
"Drinkability: An incredibly aromatic porter, with a bittersweet taste. It is clear to see why Meantime are become such a respected brewery. Very drinkable given the alcohol content, and even though it is sold in a large 750ml bottle it sometimes doesn't feel big enough."
"D= A pretty good English porter and easy to drink for sure, but not my favorire example of the style. The mouthfeel is a bit off and the aroma was lacking (but I also don't doubt my bottle had some age on it)."
"D. This beer tasted a bit thin and watery with not much malt flavor or depth and was supported by a tart hing but no hop notes at all. I found the over-carbonation a bit frustrating and I don't think I will try it again just because there are better porters and lower price points. There were no off flavors just no real flavors at all"
"Taste is mildly roasted with a heavy chocolate taste, which makes a sweet impression. I get hints of cacoa, vanilla, en cappucino. The beer's body is just right for this kind of beer. Some sweetnes, but not too sticky. Bitterness is low and the beer is nicely balanced."
"M/D: Smooth refreshing fluid feel creamy on the tongue. With this type of review of course the drinkability is awesome."
"Complex, but with the body and color, somehow insubstantial. Not nearly as tasty or as sessionable as Fuller's (the obvious comparison) but maybe at 6.5%, it's not meant to be. Just doesn't drink hearty enough, even for the style."
"I like this beer, although I'm wondering if American styles are ruining my palate. What I mean is that I've come to expect big and bold, rich and chocolatey, even hoppy porters. This ain't that. But what it is, is a drinkable, even mildly sessionable version of a English Porter. Trying to review this beer is a little like trying to write a 5 paragraph history of Porter itself. Not very easy. I like it, maybe you will too. Up for the challenge? Cheers!"
"A good brew for contemplation, though the flavors are not aggressive despite their persistence. A highly drinkable porter (sweetness and bitterness are both held in check, especially if the bottle is cellared for a while), with ABV just high enough to force you to savor rather than session it."
"Well, my bottle was a gusher, which turned me off a little right away. It had been cooled, never was warm at all, and wasn't shaken at all. Still, once I poured it, the head was gone right away. In general, there was nothing impressive about this beer at all, but nothing offensive either. I couldn't even really find much to write about it. Just not impressive and a little too bland."
"Very nice porter, poured from a corked 750 ml bottle. The beer is a rich black color with a frothy tan head. The aroma is sufficiently malty, with loads of roasted character. There's also a notable caramel quality and a little, distant, herbal hop smell. The taste is very solid. There's lots of roasted, chocolate, coffee, and grain flavors. The beer has a substantial bitterness that runs through the taste. It's a centerpiece to the flavor. Lingering, bitter, and very roasty finish. Full mouthfeel, yet not overpowering. Excellent."
"D: I can drink, and drink, and drink. This is a complex brew with plenty of beautiful subtleties. I look forward to trying the coffee version!"
"Beer poured a translucent brown with a decent tan head. Nose is roasted malts and coffee. Taste has a lot going on, roasted coffee, sweet caramel, and some light hops balancing the finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, fairly smooth, but a bit thinner than expected. Drinkability is good. This is a nice subtle beer that has some complexities going on that make it quite interesting."
"The taste is rich, zesty but smooth, caramelized fruit, leaves, bark, chocolate, sweet-sour fruit, a brown-sugar-raisin sweetness and a light, toasty-chocolaty bitter finish. The feel is wonderful, and it's compelx and engaging throughout."
"Pours a dark brown colored body, transparent w/Ruby edges. Average tan colored head, somewhat diminishing. Has a malty aroma, with some roastinsss, and coffee. Coffee taste, fizzy palate, dry roastiness & malts. Pretty tasty."
"Has become one of my ""go to"" beers."
"This London Porter has a deep, dark reddish/burgundy hue with a quickly disappearing head. It had a chocolate, bisquity aroma and a slight burnt chocolate taste. However, it did carry a nice, thick and smooth mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable porter. Very enjoyable and would drink this again."
"Drinkability - Not the greatest drinkability. Quite honestly, this is one of the biggest letdowns as far as beer goes that I've ever had. The last 10 ounces of this one became a drain pour, my first in a while. I love porters, but this one struck me totally wrong."
"D - It doesnt beat Fuller's London Porter, but this is a really great English style porter. Very unique and full flavor. A bit lighter in color and thinner in mouthfeel than I would have expected, but still a very sessionable porter. Definitely worth the price to try this!"
"A very good embodiment of what I consider a (Robust) Porter. One of the best I've had. Totally worth $10, every once and a while. Good show!"
"Pours a dark reddish brown with a large tan head that hung around for awhile until it settled to a thick head. Moderate amount of sticky lacing is left on the glass. I was a bit taken aback when I first smelled and tasted this porter. The aroma has a soft fruitiness but the taste is dominated by smoke. A little fruit and chocolate break up the smoke before the finish. Some alcohol warmth is noted. The body is medium with a nice soft, creamy texture. The ABV is on the higher side of English Porters so it is not as drinkable and sessionable. Good all around porter with a nice smokey character."
"D: Exceelent beer for a glass or two, not an everyday type of beer but excellent if you want to try someting good and very tasty."
"taste is sweet chocolate, sour malt, prunes, figs, some smoke, weak coffee, and creamy caramel."
"Very enjoyable and drinkable. No ploblem finishing the bottle in one sitting."
"Pours a four finger light tan head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Deep mahogany color. Roasted coffee nose. Good carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Flavor is sweet roasted coffee, smooth. Nice porter very similar to their coffee porter. $10.00 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"D - Good porter, though not as full bodied as i like porters"
"D - Not a beer I had any problems drinking. A great, mild English porter that I will definitely have again."
"Future outlook: Too many better, easier to get choices out there to be bothered with this one."
"Drinkability: A nice looking beer with good flavor. Carbonation level is pretty high. If I had this alone, I think I would have liked it a little more, but having it in a flight of porters, I see how many better porters are out there, many of them less expensive and more easily available. All in all though, I am glad I picked this up."
"Deep auburn pour with a short off-white head. Rich aroma of caramel and malt. Sweeter than I expected, but that seems to be Meantime's calling card. Bittersweet flavors of malt, brown sugar, cocoa, mixed with an astringent bite. Slow-drinking and very enjoyable."
"meantime's london porter, a smooth, full flavored, moderately strong ale with a robust creamy head. this ale epitomizes the porter for me; in comparison to a stout it has more hop characterstic, slightly more carbonation, and is slightly less dark. theres still ample roasty malt notes here which lean more toward chocolate sweetness and away from coffee bitterness. what makes this ale really stand out is how creamy it is without the cloying sweetness which typifies a milk stout or some brown ales. being a british micro its not an extreme ale but it has a respectable 6.5% abv. this is a porter that i could drink any time and all the time. well balanced between hops and malts, complex in flavor, and rich, smooth, creamy and full bodied."
"D: a good porter with some wide complexity and dark earthy notes makes this true to style and true to drink."
"Overall a tasty porter."
"Pretty drinkable, though I prefer more flavor to balance the alcohol against, and more body if the alchol is going to be turned up to 6.5."
"D- I had no problem putting away this 750. It was a very nice balanced porter, not disappointing in any aspect. Overall, this is a damn fine beer."
"Poured from a 750ml corked bottle. The beer poured a dark, deep cola-black color that was not quite opaque with some hints of red when held up to light. It produced a nice a dark tan 2 finger head that was compact. The head seemed to linger for the right amount of time. It also produced a nice deep roasted malt aroma that had a hint of smokiness to it. Also hints of molasses, some alcohol as it warmed and I think I also got a little coffee or chocolate. Could have been a little more pronounced. The taste was exceptional. Huge deep roasted malt, with very subtle hints of the alcohol, a very lite touch of sweetness and as I neared the end I got some coffee or chocolate. I could not really distinguish (maybe if I had bought more than one bottle...to be updated). The beer had a medium body, I thought that it would have felt thicker, but it was very smooth, very creamy and solid like a good porter should be. The beer was very drinkable and I could have drank more if I had bought more than one bottle. If you are a fan of beer, you need to try this one. This will become a staple in my house."
"Dark brown with flashes of ruby. Large head that takes the early train out. It carries an aroma of toasted nuts and roasted malt, along with a whiff of alcohol. Coffee, molasses, booze in the taste. Taste is a little sour. The mouthfeel is what really takes away from this historic brew recipe when grading it by modern standards. It's thin body decreases the overall flavor and cannot sufficiently conceal the abv. It tastes like a high abv brown ale. Overall, this is a unique porter to drink, certainly enjoyable and fun to picture all the crazy 18th century sailors and pirates guzzling this stuff."
"D - Not my most wordy review; Canes football is on. All you need to know is that Meantime has done it again. Like its IPA, an excellent recreation of a classic style."
"This stuff is great. It was a bit pricey at $10 a 750ml but it was worth it. I wish it was sold in six packs because I could drink this stuff all night."
"Clear, dark brown, not quite opaque, with a reddish tint. It poured with a two finger cap of light tan foam, quite chunky. The aroma was roasty and burnt, with some toffee and molasses, lactose and chocolate, plus a hint of smoke. Bitterness was restrained, but became a little more forceful in the finish. It started off biscuity and malty, becoming fruity and roasted in the middle. Finished with some chocolate. Pretty good. Decent texture, medium bodied, but carbonation was a little coarse, some dryness from the dark malts. Quite drinkable. Overall, a solid English porter."
"A 750ml bottle that I thought was a real bargain at $5.00. Poured into a pint glass the beer was black in color with red highlights. A thick tan head. The aroma was mostly roasted malt. Quite tasteful, with coffee and a little chocolate. A bit on the bubbly side. Very nice beer."
"Overall, Meantime London Porter is a really good English Porter that is worth another purchase. Recommended."
"Holly crap this is a great porter. I don't think I can ever give out a perfect score, but this came close. If you don't pick this stuff up, you are a fool. It went great with the grilled pork chops I had for lunch as well."
"It must have been tough for Washington to boycott his beloved porter if it indeed tasted like this."
"The flavor is what I would expect for a recreation of an English Porter: husky, organic malt notes blend with some dark fruit, biscuit, and sourness. Bitter baker's chocolate lingers on the finish. Mouthfeel is unnecessarily over-carbonated for my palate. Other than that, the medium-thin body is quite smooth and refreshing. All in all, this was a decent porter, fairly drinkable, but not worth the asking price."
"Mouth-feel is great. Bubbly and full bodied. Not stout-like thickness but just right for a porter. A little bitter aftertaste."
"What an enjoyable porter. I love the English style with the low amount of hops, all malt. It's fantastic. Recommended."
"750ml caged and corked bottle from Wilderness Wines in Rangely. Pours a dark brown body with a couple inches of slowly-dissipating rocky light tan head. Smells roasty, chocolatey, earthy, and slightly fruity. Tastes very roasty, with coffee and chocolate notes, nuttiness, with some caramel molasses, and hints of licorice. Flavors are very well-balanced, complex, and somewhat subtle. Medium bodied with a fair bit of carbonation. This a solid example of the style for sure, very tasty, drinkable, and enjoyable. Having said that, it's unfortunately an occasional treat at the price."
"D - This is an outstanding porter. One of the best that I've ever had."
"When poured, it was close to black in color, with a little bit of tan foam and some lace on the side of my glass. The smell of roasted malts along with a hint of chocolate and spice. The taste had a bitter tart finish on the palate of roasted malts, chocolate a just a hint of prunes. Nicely balance, even with the tart bitterness. It did seem to have a more mellow flavor when it got a little warmer."
"Overall, this isn't really a mind blowing experience, but it's a nice change of pace from American-style porters. Quite good, and well worth a try."
"D: Not really but I will have another to rerate this possibly infected bottle."
"Poured a dark brown with a huge tan head of large dark tan bubbles. Mild carbonation was apparent, but light enough to let the head subside over the course of a minute or two. Nose was clean with mild dark lightly roasted malts. Nothing overpowering in the nose. Flavor was smooth and dominated by a soft dark roasty malt flavor with a light alcohol taste peeking out from behind in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was thick without being heavy and left the flavor sitting on the tongue after the swallow."
"Drinkability: I hate to say it, but this is one of those beers that is more interesting, than it is delicious. It is good, yet I don't see myself picking up another $10 bottle in the near future."
"The aroma that mostly came through was roasted malts and slight chocolate. The taste was sweet with known flavor suspects like chocolate and nuttiness. It was highly carbonated like a soda pop and thin in the mouth. To me it was not overly complex and a good middle of the road porter."
"Light brown color and this beer had a nice tan head, lacing was decent. Smell of chocolate, sweet malt and a bit of coffee. Slight roasted tones with good malt, subtle hops. Kind of light mouthfeel only thing I didn't care for but it made at the same time a real quaffing porter. Like the IPA I thought this beer way overpriced but I liked it more than their IPA."
"D- Cool beer, but didnt live up to the hype. Maybe my bottle was bad? I will try this again though."
"D - I would drink this fairly often if it were available in smaller bottles. At $19AUS per 750ml bottle it's a bit too much for regular consumption."
"D - Not bad good ABV makes it easy to drink and the flavor backs that up."
"Recommended..."
"D - not bad; pretty sweet coming from the Guinness I just had (I know, I know, but c'mon I imagine many of us have fallen victim to St. Patrick's Day), but not overpowering. Enjoyable, but I'm glad I'm splitting half the bottle with my gf."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a one inch tan head. The aroma is of caramel, vanilla, cream, and burnt malt. The taste is of burnt caramel, with a moderate bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with lively carbonation. Overall, this is a good porter, that I could drink again."
"This is a good example of a good English Porter, however I felt that the packaging made it seem like it should have been more than it was. It got better as it warmed up closer to room temp. (served around 55-60 deg. initially) but didn't get any other reaction than, ""oh...that's a good porter."""
"Dark ruby red brown, with tan edges and a nice head of foam that whisps down slowly. Aromas of roasted malts, chocolate, slight coffee, and medicinal hop alphas. Taste is smooth and together with no one component stealing the show. Bready malts and green hop back palate kicks round it out nicely. Mouthfeel is smooth and drinkability is good, but this one is just kinda boring and gets old after a while. Not bad, but nothing new."
"Meantime won't win any awards for complexity, but it's actually not bad and would make a good intro to the style for people who ""hate dark beer"". Interesting historical brew."
"Poured a 750 into a Chimay chalice. Poured a dark mahogany with ruby tones and a nice beige head that melded into a thin layer on the beer. Aroma is of chocolate, raisins and a bit of coffee. Taste, well, that's where the marks start to drop. This beer has what I consider the worst flavor that can be added to a beer. Liquid smoke. Why, just explain to me why, its a needed flavor. It tastes like salt, salt and over cooked beef with bad BBQ sauce. I hate that taste. Everything else is lost in the liquid smoke. Mouthfeel is good for a porter. A bit fuller. I think that people that like that flavor would really enjoy this beer, but I will never be buying this beer again."
"Reminds me of the Fuller's Porter a bit, though this seems a bit sweeter and more sour. Wish I had more, this drinks far too quick."
"D: I like their historical recreations of old-timey beers. Definitely creative. I am fine splitting one of these. I enjoyed the IPA slightly more."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, slightly filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this good beer to sip for a long while."
"Pours a dark black with ruby highlights. Good white head but dissipates fast. The nose is thin but smells a bit of malt and the tiniest grainy cherry smell. Taste is a wonderful plethora of flavor. Some mocha type choco coffee action with nice malt and grain background. Finish has the slight bitterness of hop kick. This is a tasty porter that I recommend. And Im pretty sure this is the official brew of the london silly nannies."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a tan head. Nose is thick malts. Caramel is there too. Flavor is rich with malted caramel like flavors. Mild roasted tones. Smooth sweet edge to it. I think that defines this one: smooth. Smooth carbonation and a good liquid feel make this a nice one to try. Definitely worth it."
"Had on tap at the Brick Store Pub. Appropriate glassware as usual. Pours black with a head that quickly fades but that leaves some very good lacing. Smells fruity with prunes,black licorice, and stewed apples. Tastes winey and fruity with similar fruit as are in the aromas. Cocoa and a bit of coffee as well. Mouthfeelis smooth and creamy and it is very drinkable. I really like this company's beers. English styles done very well with just a bit of an American edge. This one is no exception, one of my favorite English porters."
"Tasty and smooth consistent flavour, a delight with food or even by itself. Medium mouthfeel."
"I had higher expectations, but in hindsight, I would stick to Fullers or Sam Smith for porters."
"Drinkability- A solid 5 on the drinkability here. Creamy, smooth and ultra drinkable. I have bought the rest of the supply that the store had and I will hoard the last bottle for many days to come although the urge is here already with 1/4 of the bottle still remaining."
"D - Extremely drinkable and enjoyable if you like porters. This is a must for a porter fan"
"Fit for a king or George Washington. I have no idea how accurate the replication is, but this is an amazing brew. A porter of this stature would serve well as a staple in any bar."
"Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle with a freshness date into a pint glass. It was a dark brown with ruby highlights. It had an average sized beige head that settled into a thin collar. A little lacing and carb. The aroma was roasted malts, some chocolate and smoke. The taste was good with a nice smoky feel with coffee and chocolate tones. Good mouthfeel. Overall, this is a really good porter. I enjoyed the smoky twist and could see a bottle going down every few months. Highly recommend. (4, RR, T, Y)"
"Drinkability: While there is a lot to this beer, I find it is more interesting to describe than enjoyable to taste; I have now had it twice and each time there is something different that is a demerit - the first time, there was too much charcoal and the second time, too much carbonation"
"I'll put this in the ""interesting"" category. Something ""unique"" and ""different"" out of England. As with all historic replica brews, I wonder how true to history it is - something we will never know. No matter - overall, I liked it well enough."
"The pour from the 750ml cork and caged bottle is a deep clear brown to almost black with significant ruby highlights, head is light chocolate in color, the texture creamy and the size exceptional, as it fades to nothingness, the lacing provides a firm sheet to surround the glass. Nose has a nice toasted grain aroma, sweet with hints of toffee and bittersweet chocolate, quite pleasing to the nose and eyes. Start is pleasantly malty, sweet with just a hint of hops, top is light to moderate on the palate. Finish is benevolent in its acidity, the hops amiable in their spiciness, sweet to the end with a dry aftertaste, quite a nice Porter, having sampled a few of their beers, they seem to be an excellent brewery"
"Pours out a ruby tinged cherry finished wood with a creamy, khaki head which leaves little bits of lace. Smell has notes of dried, dark fruits, fresh berries, chocolate, cane syrup, and coffee. I can pick up a touch of smokiness. Flavor is very full and rich with more fresh fruitiness coming out over the dried ones, but I still surely pick up some raisin and dried fig. Nice mix of breadiness with the sweetness reminds me of biscuits and cane syrup. A touch of cherry presses on through the middle along with some big chocolate. Finishes with roastiness of coffee. Aftertaste lingers on and on with big emphasis on cane syrup, preserved figs, and coffee (all this reminiscent of breakfast). Light twang in the finish as well, to mention. Mouthfeel is moderate in weight, has a gentle carbonation, but can be just a bit sticky. Drinkability is fine, but the sweetness could hold me back. Delicious beer, but I don't know if I'd pay this much for it again."
"Comment: I like the trend in craft beers to find historic recipes. This porter was rich and complex. Hat tip to the brewery."
"D: While perhaps not my absolute favorite interpretation, this is definitely what I think of when I hear the world ""porter."" Seems like all the ducks are in a row on this one, with the taste and mouthfeel matching the historical porter flavor profile."
"Pours black as the african night, smells good to the last drop maxwell house. The taste calgon takes away to a land of deep malty, chocolatey, roasty toasty, goodyness. The triangulation of belgian sensiblities, english personality, and a german attitude gives this beer its unique 32 pieces of flair to keep you coming back."
"Drinkability: Tore through this 750ml bottle easily, but best taken pretty slow to savor the complex malt profile here. I'll definitely be buying this again to punctuate special occasions."
"Drinkability: Tasty AND traditional."
"I am not going to slam this beer, but in my opinion it is very over rated and expensive for what it is. The marketing and packaging is top notch, the product however, doesn't live up to hype."
"Taste is more of the aroma with the toasted, nutty, malt flavors showing through and some of the brown sugar sweetness noted in the aroma as well. Finish is slightly bitter and fruity with a smoked peat pressence as well. Mouthfeel is smooth, medium bodied, and has a nice carbonation level. This porter is extremely drinkable. A very good english porter, and I will purchase again despite the slightly high price tag."
"Not bad, but at $9.95 not a beer I'd like to sample too often. Fuller's example is more affordable by volume, and at least as good as this."
"D - This definitely shows signs of brown ale and scotch ale but that just makes it more complex. I am guessing this is what old time porters drank like. Very nice."
"Pours clear and almost opaque with mahogany hues and a full wispy light tan head that fades fairly quickly. Some lacing follows. The smell is a creamy milky tootsie roll chocolate. Medium bodied, light textured, the mouth feel tingles at first from the carbonation then it gives way to a smooth creaminess. Full flavored, the rich malty taste is lightly roasted with notes of semi-sweet chocolate. A roasted latte lingers lightly in the finish. A nice drinker. Really glad that i had the opportunity to sample this one."
"Overall this beer is a pleasure to drink, 750ml might be enough."
"I shared this with my wife, and she really liked the flavor, so I would probably get this again to share with her."
"Overall, an interesting beer. They did a good job of recreating the old porter, but I think I prefer the newer versions. Still worth trying for sure."
"Drinkability is good the only thing bringing it down is the price. A nice enjoyable treat from a good brewery."
"Cheers!"
"Poured dark brown with a minimal head. Aromas were mostly of roasted malts and some subtle dark fruits. Flavors were of sweet roasty malts and some interesting mineral and earth notes. Not as full bodied as i was expecting but it still maintained a great balance."
"Meantime London Porter is an excellent example of an old style porter that looks and drinks like a modern day brown ale. I'm not sure that I'll pick up another bottle, but I'm glad that I gave this endlessly fascinating ale a whirl in my pint glass."
"From the bottle - Poured a head that was light brown and the body a nice dark brown. Aroma was malty with coffee, caramel, and chocolate. Flavor was sweet from the chocolate and lightly bitter and hoppy. Very smooth. Great finish. Tried this at a beer tasting and purchased a bottle right after the event. This was a very good porter."
"Large bottle, caged and corked, best before date info etched onto the bottle. Pours very dark honey amber, with a dark tan head, leaves a long lasting thick film and a gentle swirl, creates splotches of lacing. Roasty nose. Notes here of more roasted grains, some smoke, vanilla, nice tasting porter. I'm no expert, but to me this tastes what a British style porter should taste like. Not overpowering, but still sturdy and flavorful. Nice bottle presentation, makes this one well worth seeking out, bring it to a dinner party and show some folks what a classy brew this is."
"Not much of a pop, pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, some carbonation, fizzy little tannish head, not much lacing afterwards. The nose is of sweet malts, and lots of caramel. The taste is malty, sweet, lots of caramel. Slightly dry finish. Light-Medium body, not as thick as a American Porter, but very tasty still. Very drinkable, this is an very nice/tasty English Porter, highly recommended."
"Caged and corked 750ml bottle; The initial pour produced a nice solid topping of foam (subsequent pours werent quite as productive). The beer itself is deeply crimson-brown and light struggles to penetrate it. Although a bit chalky, the aroma is one of a nice bitter chocolate. Theres a bit of the chocolate on the tongue, as well ... with twists of strawberry licorice, espresso, and a tight finish. This is some good stuff. (#2767, 4/1/2007)"
"Holds its own against titans like Sam Smith's Taddy and Fuller's. Recommended for Irish stout fans, and porter aficionados of all makes. Would make a great accompaniment to any grilled meat, substitute for a rauchbier."
"I will be completely honost, I'm not a Porter afficionado, but this is the best I've had next to Anchor Porter. To me, a lot of Porters leave me desiring more, they are full enough, flavorful enough. The Meantime Porter is everything I'm looking for in a Porter. I highly recommend it!"
"Pass the sausages, this is one of the finest English Porters I've ever had."
"Deep, dark brown colour in the glass. Huge frothy tan head which lasted a very long time. Slight aromas of chocolate and roasted barley. Very surprised by the mild smoky taste. Finishes very clean with a slight coffee bitterness. Flavour and aromas are all very subtle and well balanced, making it a very drinkable and enjoyable porter."
"on an aside: excellent website for this beer and the history of London Porter. This is their true attempt at a real authentic 18th century London Porter."
"Drinkability: Good session beer. The bottle was split three ways for this tasting. Unfortunately, the price tag is not as session as the beer. All together, I probably wont buy this again but if I were offered a glass I wouldnt turn it down."
"Mouthfeel was medium to thin. Understated carbonation, present yet mild. Very well done. Every aspect of this one shines."
"Nice mouthfeel, but at times can seem undercarbonated. Regardless, very easy to drink and certainly a genuine, truly enjoyable London porter."
"Poured from 750 bottle to tumbler at 48 degrees. Beer had a dark not quite opach look. Big frothy head was creamy and lumpy like a ice cream soda. Bready toasted nutty taste with molasses and chocolate mingling together.Slight coffee note but not too overpowering. Never seen lacing this thick on side of tumbler. head was gone after about 8 minutes. This is one of the finest tasting porters I have ever tasted. I would love to have an endless supply."
"This is a very pleasant sipping beer really more in the tradition of what we in the USA think of as Scottish ale. Very mellow smoky and malty, like sipping a smoky Scotch Alexander to relax. Very much superior to the IPA"
"I <3 you meantime. please send cask. thx."
"Poured from a 750mL corked bottle a deep dark brown with ruby highlights. Thick foamy head which seemed to last an eternity. Sticky lace surround the glass I drink it down. Smells of bitter chocolate, definitely not the eating kind. Roasted coffee beans, malt, and hop finish. Tastes of coffee and chocolate with nice bittery finish. Creamy mouthfeel that the tongue just endures well after the swallow. Joyful beer which is not too over powering or indulgent but a nice tribute to this style."
"750 ml. bottle- dark brown / black color with light tan head - nose of chocolate (sweet and baking ), iodine , coffee , oat , dark fruit , mocha , and malts  taste of milk chocolate , vanilla , prunes, and coco  thick creamy body with some acidity - aftertaste bitter chocolate, malt aftertaste"
"Drinkability  This is a good drinker and would probably be killer on-tap or especially on-cask. Ah, dare to dream . . ."
"The body is fairly thin, the carbonation fairly mild. The rich and robust flavors work well with the sour porter flavor. Thin, clean finish. This is one of the most true to style, delicious, and drinkable porters I've encountered."
"An interesting historic brew."
"Overall, a very interesting interpretation of the style. Quite a bit different than other porters I've had, but not in a bad way. I think this is a good beer, but on the pricey side. I paid $7.00 for the bottle but got it marked down from $9."
"Other comments: The bottle-conditioning makes this one of the liveliest porters I've had. The cork came off with a tremendous pop. Very tasty beer. It gets a bit sweeter and much more complex as it warms up in the glass."
"Overall: A great porter, strongly recommended."
"A Mean London Porter alright. Fabulous stuff."
"Recommended."
"A full mouth with plenty of carbonation. This is a very tasty and complex porter that doesn't go overboard with the roasty aromas and flavors. I like it."
"This ended up being very different from what I was expecting. It poured a hazy brown, nearly as *light* as an English brown ale. It didn't look anything like what I think of when I think of a Porter. Smell is sweet malts and a touch of toffee. The taste is nearly ALL malt with little or no hops up front and only a slight hop bitterness towards the end. Quite lovely. Especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is very, very smooth and creamy. Almost chewy, again, as it warms. This was a good porter. Peculiar look about it, for a porter, but everything else was quite nice."
"Pours a muddy dark brown with a moderate head of brown bubbles. Smells of chocolate and dark roast coffee. Taste is thick and chocolaty. Burnt flavor is prominent throughout, but is dominating in the aftertaste. Very nice. Sweet and malt and chocolate upfront, burnt dark roast coffee in the finish. Takes on a woody character as it warms. Great porter!"
"M&D: softly-carbonated, very smooth on the mouthfeel with a lighter body than its aroma and fore-taste suggest... it seems eight-more-month ageing hasn't changed the already soft palate too much, but the flavour seems to be slightly more mellow than my last bottle and enjoys a longer aftertaste. All in all, I think this is a well-crafted, fruity as well as malty, utterly approachable porter to savour with mates, not over food."
"750 ml corked and caged bottle pours a deep ruby-black color, nice thick head that clings to my glass. Fresh roasted coffee chocolate aromas, chocolate-caramel, smoky and roasty coffee flavors. Medium body with a somewhat watery mouthfeel, a decent porter."
"overall a very nice beer, with a cool corked bottle. thanks to Viggo for sending this one my way."
"2 out of the three meantime beers I have tried I enjoyed a lot, so clearly this brewery is doing something right."
"Inky black beer. I could not detect any light through the glass at all. Its topped by a thick tan head. The head receded quickly, but left a delicate lace on the side of the glass. The nose is all roast malt. It has a lot of espresso, light chocolate, and a mild smoky character. The flavor really brings the roasted malt forward. Surprisingly smoky, with more of the espresso, bitter chocolate. A good bitterness attacks midway through the flavor and lasts into the finish which is composed of more coffee flavors. Smooth, and rich mouth feel, this is a wonderfully drinkable London porter."
"Overall - An excellent porter.... Recommended !!"
"A great beer, very interesting porter"
"Dark copper color, untypicallly light considering the style. Jammy fruits in the nose, with hints of plums and berries, not your typical chocolate, coffee porter aromas. Caramel flavors abound, with a variety of fruits. Nice flavor, with a mild body."
"Corked and caged 750ml. Almost brown with a tall tan head that left some webbings of lace around the glass. Aroma was full of sweet caramel and chocolate notes. Some light fruit was there as well. The flavor started off with more sweet caramel and light roasted malt notes. Mild fruit and chocolate followed. Finished sweet and dry. A good solid flavor for the style. Good body that was very smooth going down and quite drinkable as well. A good solid English style porter that is subtle yet still has plenty of flavor."
"Very drinkable & so out of type of what i expected...Worth the$9.00 a bottle IMHO. This is probably what porters tasted like in Dicken's day IMO"
"Drinkability is really quite good. Had limited expectations for this brew and it really surpassed my expectations. Highly drinkable, well made and enjoyable porter. Not quite up to the standards of a Fuller's but still enjoyable and worth the relatively steep pricetag."
"The aroma was clean with mild dark malts. Nothing overpowering in the nose. Flavor was smooth and dominated by a soft dark roasty malt flavor with a light alcohol taste peeking out from behind in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was thick without being heavy and left the flavor sitting on the tongue after the swallow. Good looking, mild aroma and great smooth flavor are what makes this beer so easy to drink."
"Somewhat sharp coffee aroma, but there is a tinge of some sweet malt as well. Amber brown in color with a quarter sized mocha head. Almost smokey malted fore with some brown sugar, coffee and chocolate notes. British porters tend to be lighter in color and less roasty and this one is no different. The finish is mild and tangy rather than mildy bitter and roasty like many American made porters. I think I have come to favor the American approach because while this is good it isnt exactly knocking my socks"
" I never knew a porter could be so good. Smoky, burnt malt, dark chocolate, and piney hops are fused into layers. This should pair well with filet mignon. Tastes and smells more vinous as it warms. Thick smooth mouthfeel. As this is the best porter I've ever had, it is insanely drinkable. I just want to fnow why it is $13 for 750ml."
"A very pleasing beer that I haven't seen at my local liqour store and picked up on a sort of whim. Very pleased with results."
"Drinkability: A very solid and above average beer, thanks to LuckSevens82 for the opportunity."
"Pours a deep brown with an amber hue with a creamy 1/2"" head that sits nicely atop very good staying power.Very nice aromas of semi sweet chocolate,earth,even a touch or iron.A porter on the drier side,coffee and unsweetened chocolate,and quite woody mainly in the finish.There is a herbal (fuggles?) note that comes thru late even more as I drink more,nice creamy mouthfeel holds up to the dryish flavors making it very drinkable.Is it worth $11.99?Well not so sure about that but a very well done porter one of the better I have had in awhile."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 3/4"" tan head over the brown brew with burgundy highlights. Head lasts well, and lacing is good. Aroma is dark malts, with tinges of coffee and chocolate. Taste follows the nose, with some hoppy bitterness in the middle and close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent, with the somewhat light body reminding me that the style was originally that way so that Porters could drink this style and still get their work done. Although the abv is a bit high in this example to meet that usage. Anyways, enjoyable brew for sure, and worth searching out."
"at first I was ho hum on this.. after 2 glasses? really dig it. over all damn enjoyable, maybe not the all around that the old raspy is.. but what is ? I will be buying this again."
"Fairly drinkable. I am going to chill the rest of teh bottle and try at a colder temp to see what changes I see in taste and feel. However, solid porter. I like!"
"The taste is lightly sweet up front with a palate that has a certain fullness to it, despite being quite light. The beer finishes with a dry burnt grain character and a solid dark chocolate note. Up front this tastes of sweetened black coffee, it also has note of biscuit malt and brown malt. The finish is quite nice, with a complex malt profile. Up front it is not quite so complex though, even a bit simplistic. The mouthfeel is too thin and the beer is a bit too sweet; both of these clash and downplay the nice malt profile, which is in the finish."
"Lightish bodied, but taut of structure and detail. This is a phenom. So drinkable that one begins to understand why George Washington and his peers wore those ridiculous wigs. But not so drinkable or stimulating as to make any sense of AN I FOR DENAL. And there is not enough of this in the world to make 51659 appear as anything other than an American zipcode."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Peaceful, calm and focused. Absolutely nothing in the way."
"Overall, an excellent porter. It's hard to find good porters in this area and I'm very glad I've found this one. I can't wait to try their IPA."
"Tastes of coffee and malts are standing out for sure. nice lacing. Taste is smoothe with an even finish. a nice porter"
