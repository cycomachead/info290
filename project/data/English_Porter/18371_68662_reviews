"A wonderful take on the style with its bitterness."

"O: a very interesting style and I'm glad Dann and Ron brought it back"
""
"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, hazy, chestnut highlighted brown-to-black coloring with a thin, frothy, foamy, off-white head. Aromas of heavy roasted coffee, both bitter and a bit smoky. Flavors are very heavily roasted, with a solid profile of coffee, both bitter and rich. Very heavy coffee profile. The aftertaste is bitter and roast, with a hint of bittersweet chocolate note. Dry, bitter, mid-lingering finish. Solid brew, and fun to see what brews used to be like back in the day, as they say."
"An interesting treat and I don't mind drinking it one bit."
"Thanks to Aaron for sharing. The beer is cola brown with a thin, broken, beige head. The aroma offers coffee, roast, brown sugar. Ok flavor. A tad harsh. Coffee bitterness with lingering charred roast. Moderately low carbonation. Pretty good. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone"

"Poured into a Pretty Things wine-style stem glass. Deep dark brown color with a small but lasting beige head. Dark roasty malts in the nose, coffee, piney hops. Notably bitter in the taste, roasty dark malts, a generous dose of piney hops, coffee beans, solid earthiness, ash, with a bitter and almost harsh aftertaste. Body was about medium, actually quite robust compared to other beers of the style. Good overall, but for me, just a little too bitter for a porter."

"o - Overall a pretty nice English porter. Normal chocolate and roasted characteristics with a little bit of a twist with the hops. Easy to drink, would have it again."
""
""
""
"O: Really pleasant and unique. My first offering from Pretty Things as well. Cool beer with a cool back story."
"A very drinkable and classic porter. Highly recommended. It may be my one of my favorite porters."

"O: If this is what was drunk in the 19th Century they had it good. And now that most are drinking the corporate swill it seems we are going backwards as a human race as far as beer is concerned. This is a great beer."
"O: this is a very interesting brew, and one that i really enjoy, both because of the taste and as well because of the story and history behind it. Unique and intriguing a great porter to keep you warm on a cold night."

"O: Mouthfeel aside, this beer is a winner. Over the last 2 years, I've come to trust that Pretty Things will deliver a quality brew. And if this beer is an accurate recreation, as the label suggests, then them soldiers were drinking pretty damn good."
""

" The feel is good with plenty of deep roasted and mild bitterness with slight caramel sweetness accenting with an almost creamy body and slightly dry finish without much in the way of alcohol presence. I love the taste - it has woody and slight nutty grain which comes off like a high cocoa content dark chocolate taste with subtle earthy elements and hint of hops giving balance but the balance does seem to be more dry than sweet and bitter with slight pine flavor and gentle dark sugar notes. I recommend this to anyone who likes a nice balanced porter which is not heavy on the sweetness. This is an excellent beer!"

"This is remarkably English-tasting considering it was brewed by Pretty Things. This is interesting, and I am glad I had the opportunity to try it."

"O - A memorable beer in a style category that is usually underwhelming to me, I'm stoked I got to try this!"
"Overall- Awesome porter. I'll definitely go back and buy another to share with a friend."
""
""
"O: One of the best in style that I’ve had, and a great beer at that. Smooth mouthfeel, rich flavors, easy to drink. Thanks again, Eric."
""

"O - Fantastic. Really complex with lots of flavors. Leaves a great smoked flavor that's both intriguing and delicious. Highly recommended."

"D - It is an interesting opportunity to try a beer recreated from the mid 19th century. I am used to historical beers coming from ancient recipes and coming with a rather loose interpretation of the original (ahem, DFH), but this seems to be quite authentic. The dark character is quite different from what one typically gets in a modern porter as this beer is all about dark sugar rather than roasted grain."
"Overall: very interesting and complex beer. suspect for many folks (with a better pallette) than moi would appreciate it. Perhaps w/ time I would like it more."

"O: A quite enjoyable and rather complex beer. Loads of flavor without being overpowering, cloying, or tiring. Very nice."

"O - This one could end up in the drain.... :( I wanted to enjoy this one!!! This is hard to drink, it's much like a bad homebrew. What happened to this brew????"
"If I had to choose one beer to drink for the rest of my life, this one might just be it."
"Overall: Damn fine take on the style. It's scary how well they copied British water. Tons of flavor and complexity for days. This would probably stand up to some aging, maybe a year."
"Pretty Things December 6th, 1855 East India Porter pours almost entirely black. There's a little bit of cherry shining through at the bottom of the glass, and that's it. There are about three fingers of light caramel head sitting atop the beer. Retention is outstanding, the head's creep down the side of the glass is a slow one. There's a solid ring of lace marking the apex of the head, but below that it's little too spotty. The nose is predominantly roasted coffee, with solid support from dark chocolate aromas. A nice herbal note lies far in the background, but keeps things interesting. The malt profile of the flavor is very similar to that of the aroma, with coffee being the primary note. Chocolate is a little bit more present here though. The bitterness of the coffee melds into bitterness from the hops, before closing with a subdued herbal noble hop flourish. The body is is a serious letdown, nowhere near rich/full enough and it crosses the line into watery. The carbonation is appropriately subdued, and doesn't overtake the lackluster body. I enjoyed this most recent entry in the Once Upon A Time series when it was fresh, but thought a little bit of time would improve it some. I think I was right, but held on to this bottle a month or two too long."
"Still, a great brew!"
"overall, it's definitely hoppier than most porters, especially English ones. I didn't like this one as much as their ""KK"" in the series."
"Pours dark amber with a rolling head that settles to a light brown 1/4"" foam. Nose is rich roasted malts, some chocolate, some hops just barely there. Taste is a bloom of roasted malts, some caramel some bitter hops aftertaste. Mouthfeel is pleasant some carbonation off the tongue as it passes through, some roasty flavors find their way through my nose, medium-to-heavy body. A solid porter with a real pop, the hops are an enhancing addition. Robust and malty, this is a porter I'm happy with and would buy again if in the malty mood."
"Overall -- Nice. Reminds me of Avery's New World Porter, which I am quite fond of. That beer was better, though."
"I love this beer. I've been looking for a Porter like this for a long time, it's one of the best I have ever had. Even though it is not technically perfect, I'm giving it a 5 overall because all the elements work so well together and the experience is just so damn enjoyable. I like it better on the cold side, before the hop taste fully kicks in."
"The CPJ"
"Poured a 3"" mocha head. Deep burnt umber brown body. Smells nicely of hops, caramel, chocolate. Taste is really nice and smooth too emphasizing cocoa and coffee followed by a hops boost to the finish. It all compliments each other unlike some of the other over-hopped dark beers popular right now in which the hops even overwhelm the dark roast flavors."
"Overall, this is a solid beer, and while there can be a slightly-too-powerful alcohol tinge at the edges of the brew--which is surprising since it's only 6% ABV--it's most certainly a delicious porter that features heavily the tobacco flavors of the style."
"O- I wish I had this in my immediate market year round. I loved the shit out of this. Sweetened up as it warmed, but overall this was a bonfied bitter, bad ass, mo fo..."
"Possible, the most perfect porter I've ever had. I'm gonna email the brewery to see if I can get a clone recipe. Amazing. If it weren't so damn pricy, I'd almost alway have it on hand."
"O: Very good and interesting beer. I would actually prefer it to be a bit less hoppy, though the hops were actually weaker than expected. It's not terribly bitter or anything, but I'd like to taste the rich malt flavors in an even gentler brew. Still, I'm a fan of Pretty Things, particularly these Once Upon A Time beers."
"O: Quite enjoyable. Easy drinking for the style, and not as hoppy as I was expecting. For once I don't mind that at all. I prefer there to be a slight break between the darker ales and ipas."
"Sampled on August 17, 2011. What a fabulous presentation with the ribbon over the cap and the gray tone label that mixes 18th century calligraphy with modern sans serif typewriter font. The pour is a handsome but cloudy brown with a long lasting foamy head. The aromas are rich with baking chocolate, smoke, coffee, and hops. The body is full. The taste is bold with smoky chocolate with a near dry finale. It is also very drinkable. Excellent brew from Pretty Things."
"D: Seriously yum. Solid solid porter."
"Overall nothing about this beer was over-the-top, instead it was a solid and easy-drinking beer made above average thanks to the mouthfeel. Well worth a shot."
"Pours a nice brown color, nice carbonation, nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, some very nice toffee notes, and chocolate hints. The taste is very nice malty, very nice toffee notes, and a touch of chocolate, slightly bitter. Medium Body. This one is very tasty, a joy to drink. Thanks Chris!"
"Pours a one-finger finger light tan head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Deep brown almost black color, ton of yeast left in bottle. Nose is roasted coffee and flavor is roasted/burnt coffee. Lingering burnt coffee finish. $8.65 for a 22oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"This could be outstanding on cask, though it isn't bad in the bottle. Lacking the multiple layers of roast that my favorite examples sometimes exhibit, this is a robust and direct porter none the less - very enjoyable."
"Once again, Pretty Things makes a very good beer that defies categorization. It definitely has aspects of a porter, and is probably closest to a porter if it had to be categorized but it has aspects that fit in line with stouts, brown ales and even IPAs in some respect (maybe Black IPAs). Definitely a nice, interesting and flavorful beer, especially at a lower ABV."
"Taste has a more upfront hop aspect with a long lingering bitterness, it isn't a harsh bitterness because of the roasted malt presence, it's actually like a burnt bitterness with a piney presence, carbonation is right in the range it's supposed to be and helps lends a touch of creaminess."
"Don't go into this with any preconceived notions, because I think it will end up being vastly different than you imagine. But it's a very nice brew and I'm honored to have tried a bit of beer history!"
"dark brown liquid that was only barely translucent. Huge head of tan foam on the top that settled down only briefly to coat the sides of the glass with a thick, spider like web of lace. Dark roasted malts are all over the aroma. Notes of molasses, cocoa, hints of brown sugar and light touches of everything from licorice to dark fruits. As it warmed it got a touch one sided as some elements of peat started to break the surface. But taken the first sip all was forgotten. Just huge rich notes of chocolate malts and a touch of licorice just come across the tongue in waves of flavor. Rich and very sweet, hints of molasses and roasted coffee now come across the tongue. Very well put together"
"Taste starts deep and worty, roasted chocolate in the middle, and finds the anise and some burnt coffee coming on at the close, with a lingering alcohol tinge to keep the dark flavors company. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth, and drinkability is very good. This one retains it's use from even way back then. Yum."
"Drinkability – I love the idea behind the Once Upon a Time beers. Taking a look into the past and reviving an original recipe. This is a unique beer with rough charred edges and a boatload of hops. Really great with steak and dark chocolate. Great stuff, Pretty Things."
"22oz. bottle served at 53 degrees in my Lost Abbey tumbler. Pours a semi-hazy brownish mahogany with a half inch, dense, khaki-colored head. Head eventually settles into a consistent quarter inch cap. Textured bands of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Great nose - roast, mocha notes, lactose, artificial sweetener and a faint piney/citrus quality. Taste consistent with nose - lactose creaminess really comes out in the flavor profile, as well as a trace of char and a piny/herbal bitterness at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a lively carbonation and a pleasant, creamy texture. I wasn't sure what to expect based on the description, but I get something of a porter/black IPA hybrid from this beer. Well worth your time if you have the opportunity to try this one."
"D - I thought this was a pretty successful brew - I'm curious as to the actual historical accuracy of the recipe, but it's a nice hoppy porter/Black IPA hybrid. The bitterness gets a bit fatiguing, but otherwise the low alcohol and nice flavors make it quite easy to drink."
"Thanks to Chris for this, how in the heck is this on the buzzed list... light brown with an amber hue, light tope head, ok retention and lacing... the nose is all black ipa, a hint of yogurt, ok... the taste is not good, all roasted soap, not worthing trying"
"A semi opaque brown colored beer with a fine tan froth that sticks around. Dry, toasty malt, more in the way of bittersweet chocolate, woodsmoke and burnt molasses than dark fruit. Hops are dominant, with a nice green stalk flavor. Fresh and bitter, leaving little malt sweetness on the palate. A little sting of mineral/metal in the finish, which is otherwise all hops. Tight, clean, bitter. My kind of porter-- reminds me of several Northwest beers I used to enjoy in OR."
"O/D-Pretty things is just a very solid brewery. This may be my favorite offering from them. I love their saisons and I really loved American Darling. This actually is on par with the latter. Nothing Pretty Things makes is less than a really good time. What a big porter; especially for the ABV. Had been putting off trying this one; won't be doing that again with this brewery!"
"O: Another fine historical experiment from the folks at Pretty Things. Hopefully this isn't a one-off and enters their regular rotation."
"O: This has made me reconsider pretty things after having their terrible quad. This is a fine ale, and I can so imagine some officers in an english style pub swilling this down. Quite a glimpse into the past."
"Notes: This is one great porter. The finish lasts for days, and it's packed chock full of vibrant tastes. If this is anything like what the British were drinking in the 1800s, they were truly spoiled. The history buff in me is really loving Pretty Things' dedication to these recreations too. Keep up the good work guys (and ladies)."
"Not really complex or interesting but certainly not bad."
"Very very solid porter. Very pleased with this one. Thought it would be hoppier, but a great porter."
"And the taste follows suit of the nose. Rich and roasty and very bitter. Dark cocoa like tannins which I believe are from the roasted malt, and flavors of unroasted barley. Very pruney in the mouth with raisin and fig about. Bakers chocolate, earthy hops, tobacco and leather. Semi sweetness in the way of burnt sugar and caramel is swiftly dried out in the long chewy finish. Some red currant flavors and molasses rule the palate on the finish and in the middle. Possibly my favorite porter I've had, but hard to say. So much going on and so complex."
"The beer pours a dark brown to almost black with very little to no light getting through. the head is tan and thick and holds to the side of the glass. the smell is rich roasty and hoppy. the flavor follows suit with a bit of hop flavor melded together with the roasted malt flavor, followed by a nice bitter finish. the mouthfeel is medium bodied and low to medium carbonation. overall a really excellent brew."
"Taste is... deep and earthy, the roasted malt really stands out. The alcohol seems to warm the palate and intensifies the malty goodness. There is a surprising hops bitter finish that fights through the deep malt backbone of this beer. Its really different, and its fantastic."
"Overall: I'm pretty impressed by this beer. I think this and Jack D'Or are my favorite Pretty Things beers and as a porter/stout fan, I think this is great. If this is the beer that was popular in the 1800s, I'm jealous. I would pick this up as soon as you can. Cheers!"
"O: Goes down easily, very tasty, not filling, mild kick, great representation of style. This has got to be one of my favorite porters. Yet another solid offering from Pretty Things."
"O: This is an excellent porter and definitely an interesting piece of history at the same time. I like porters but I find that most are a bit too smoky - a characteristic that isn't overpowering in this brew. The hoppiness is quite intriguing, it's kinda like an american black ale/black ipa but with extra roast and chocolate and coffee."
"Overall, delightfully drinkable and highly recommended."
"The mouthfeel is about average for the style with carbonation being a little above average. Overall it was a very flavorful and good beer. The hoppiness meshed pretty well with the roasty, chocolaty flavors, which is sometimes hard to pull off. A pretty nice beer overall."
"Editing 10 minutes later. The hops really come out after its qarmed up a bit. Nice hop bite that doesnt take over the porter flavor. Stuffs fantastic."
"Light carbonation, I could have gone for more and I almost wish I hadn't shared it at a game. Great stuff."
"Overall a fabulous beer that I would happily drink over and over. Once again, the Pretty Things Beer & Ale Project has produced one of the better beers in New England."
"Wow, these old school British folk knew their way around an aggressive pint of beer. And this stuff is aggressive by today's standards. I wish England was still making beers like these."
"O: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly because there is a good balance between the roasted flavors and bitterness."
"A very good beer dark in color with a slight tinge of blood red. The brownish head slowly wisps away like a ghost. The aroma of this beer hints at licorice, and roasted malts. A slight creaminess gives way to a slight bitterness with hints of burnt coffee, roasted malts, and anise. Had it at Sapsuckers in Huntington, New York."
"On tap at the new Porter Cafe in West Roxbury. Served in a Harpoon IPA glass. Dirty brown colored body. Thin white head. Chalky powdery cocoa smell. Taste was impressive, though. I found it unique to try a hoppy porter. The chocolate malt was there for the porter aspect, but there was definitely a nice dose of hops on the palate. Mouthfeel was a bit confusing though. Not thick enough for a porter, but heavy for an IPA. Doesn't hide the alcohol though, as I thought it was way above 6%. This is an interesting beer from Pretty Things. I am not sure that I fell in love, but I certainly am always impressed when I try a new PT beer."
"More Porter than IPA, but the hop presence is distinct. The body is surprisingly thin. The. Finish is cocoa with a bitter kick. Quite appealing."
"O: This is not a novelty beer. This is a tasty and well constructed, very hoppy porter. If this were regularly available, I would probably buy it as frequently as the Smuttynose and Founders porters. However, one bomber is certainly enough for a sitting."
"Overall - Good brew, if you can't decide between and IPA and a lighter stout or a black ale then this would be the #1 choice."
"This certainly delivers the goods for any porter lover, which I am. The hoppiness isn't off the charts, but it does present a nice change of pace from the norm. I would have loved it if the roasted char had been dialed back just a bit."
"Very dark brown with dark chestnut edges and a dense tan cap. Good head retention and solid sheets of lace clung to the glass. Interesting aroma, an odd combination of hops and malt. Toasted malts and burnt sugar, pine resin with a bit of sharp citrus, mild roast, and a hint of fruitiness. Notes of dark chocolate and vanilla as it warmed. Similar flavour profile with plenty of resinous bitterness, chocolate and roast, toasted bread, and milder contributions from fruity citrus and caramelized sugar. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, a little chalky and slightly astringent. I have to admit that this beer was a bit confusing to me at first, but as I worked through it I kept finding new layers of flavours as it warmed. I ended up liking it quite a bit."
"Overall: A fascinating beer and thanks to the folks at Pretty Things for bringing this historical artifact back to the present"
"This is an amazing, wondrous thing. I have a feeling that if I had access to this beer, I would buy as much of it as I could every chance I got to keep it around for as long as I possibly could. From the initial aroma through to the feeling at the back of the throat, every sense and emotion that is evoked by this liquid is pleasant, and most of them blow me away with happy goodness. This would be in my daily rotation if it could be, without question!"
"D - Very drinkable. The flavors are nice and balanced and blend together nicely. The hops are a nice addition to traditional porter style."
"Overall very enjoyable. It had more going that I thought it would. I expected a more straight porter, but characteristics of exciting brown ales and even Belgian style ales are found here."
"When I went to review this beer, I noticed that there is more than one instance of the word 'fine' in other people's reviews. Indeed, Pretty Things makes the kind of beer that inspires people to use words like 'fine' when talking about the craftsmanship. EIP is yet another example of this."
"A very bold porter @ 6%ABV. Outstanding flavor though a bit too bitter. Very much worth the purchase."
"The folks at Pretty Things are experts at brewing ancient, obscure styles and they concocted another interesting creation here. This is definitely worth a try, if for nothing more than posterity."
"D: A very enjoyable brew from pretty things and i love the idea that i am drinking a recreated beer. definitely the best one from the series thus far."
"Overall; Excellent porter when consumed fresh. Another good brew from Pretty Things."
"D: Not quite a beer I’d expect to me enjoying in the middle of May, but with all the rain and heavy air, this beer suits it perfectly. A fantastic porter that turns refreshing with hops at the end, making it seem lighter than it is."
"On tap at The Ginger Man NYC. Lacey, brown body and tan head. Understaed bitterness, despite claims of high IBU. Roast is understated. Oats,wheat, mollasses, lots of malt is what I mostly get.Fuller mouthfeel."
"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a really nice roasted malt scent along with a touch of hop aroma and a solid crystal/chocolate malt sweetness. It's dry with an excellent roasted nose. The taste is great as well. Again, the roasted character comes through nicely with dry toasted feel. Chocolate and caramel malts add a beautiful layer of sweetness that really rounds out the flavor. The hop character is outstanding. It packs a powerful bitterness up front and resinates through to the finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine English India Porter. It would be an excellent porter alone, but the hops add a good deal of depth; very nice."
"Can smell the hops off the bat with a little bit of chocolate and coffee. It's got a pretty decent bitterness, fading into the malt and chocolate and then back to the pine and floral hops. She drinks easy and delightful. Not thick, medium-bodied, but very pleasant. Yes, another pretty thing."
"overall, something I would drink regularly back in 1855, and could see myself drinking frequently even today. tasty mix of bitter, sweet, and roast."
"643"
"D: I feel like Pretty Things, as a brewery, are always on the overly complex side of their brews, and this concoction proves my point. Still worth trying if this is your preferred style."
"as an english porter... it thats what you're looking for exactly. this is absolute perfection."
"O: Really digging this beer and I am not normally a big fan of porters. Really interesting and an easy drinker."
"Overall pretty good, very drinkable, gets fairly bitter but never too far, lots of nice blended flavors, long finish, reminds me a lot of a cascadian dark ale, but doesn't go crazy like most American Black Ales do."
"Nicely done. I really enjoyed this one.Go get some."
"Initially was not overly impressed by this, but damn does it really turn around quickly. Delicious."
"This is good. About what I was expecting. Didn't disappoint. Kinda like a really good hoppy black & tan."
"O - Really glad I got to try this limited porter. Lots of complex stuff goin on with this one. A great ""recipe"" from the mid 1800's...go colonialism!"
"The beer is very interesting, almost like an IPA porter, if there is such a concoction out there. It has a very burnt, charred, and biting hop flavor with all the roasted chocolates, dark malts, and creaminess that you would fine in a porter. It isn't boozy, nor does it have the acerbic caramel and oakiness that you would find in an imperial stout, just the smooth, milky cacao and chocolate powder with some bittering hop that defines the beer. I will go back for another and add to the review."
"O: I really liked this beer, it was like an American black ale but different. it has a lot of porter qualities with a little bit of extra bitterness."
"Overall: Once again, Pretty Things comes through with an amazing beer, these people do no wrong. Great drinkability, complex flavors and aromas. Don’t pass this one up."
"Taste is bitter bakers chocolate and roast malt to the point of char. Bursting with herbal and pine sap hops. Hops not only add flavor in and of themselves, but also push the dark malt flavors forward."
"Beer how it was, now. Very pleased."
"O - this is an interesting creation from pretty things. lots of malts lots of hops. overall this all comes together well but i would have to say that this is not a particular favorite out of their selection. still definitely worth a try (all of their stuff is)."
"O- A very solid new brew from Pretty Things. A very enjoyable history lesson in the way things might have been over 100+ years ago. A hop forward porter that blurs lines and peaks interest. Highly recommended."
