"I really liked this one. A little too drinkable to me. A bit thin in the flavor arena (my New World bias and San Diego upbringing clouding my judgement?). Everything I look for in a Porter, just more subtle and lighter. I do not dispute the high marks given by others as this is the benchmark brew, but for those with my disposition a fair warning about subtlety."
""
""
"Not bad not good just right in the middle"
"The flavor profile is good, with reasonable intensity, complexity and balance.  It begins with a blended flavor that is tart and separates into light notes of roast and coffee and just a hint of chocolate.  The middle introduces a slight sweetness underneath.  As the sweetness fades, dark fruit is present."
""
"O: [2.75] I feel bad.  The beer is a year old.  I really like stuff from Samuel Smith and I think this didn't get a fair shake.  That being said it is what it is."
""
""
""
"got another one the next night so..."
""
""
""
"I was hoping to be impressed, however I just cant bring myself to really enjoy a porter."
""
""
""
"This beer is really good"
"Warming, satisfying and a wonderful flavour."
""
""
""
""
"Was a bit underwhelmed, but may be adjusting to the difference between English Porter and American Porter. Didn't detect much flavor or complexity in the taste and left not much of a mouthfeel."

""

"O: Its a little pricey for a 4 pack in my area in Hawaii but I feel lucky to try a world class beer such as this one. Not my favorite but if I ever feel like it I'll get another pack of this beer. Can't wait to try there other types that they make."
""
"Not one of my favorite Porters"
""
"Was expecting more really, but I think it's just my preference in Porter styles."

"Long subtle finish of coffee, hints of toffee."
""
"Poured jet black into tapered pub glass, 1 in creme colored head, smells like warm brown sugar, super smooth chocolate taste up front with a nice lightly carbonated  malt fig on the back end.  Super solid beer.  I will definitely be drinking this one again."
"Another middle of the road transition beer"
"incredible is just not enough praise"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Extremely dark brown, almost black, not allowing any light to penetrate. Head is cake-like and tannish. Aroma has hints of chocolate, some light coffee, dark fruits and sweet malt. Taste is a little lighter than I expected, with flavors of raisins, dates, figs and a touch of coffee in the finish. Overall, feels good on the palate, no alcohol burn(of course its only 5.00 ABV). Was thinking it was going to be a little more bold and bitter, but overall, a great sessionable porter with a decent balance.."
""
"Perfection, perfection, perfection, perfection, perfection"
""
""
""
""
"It's pretty much a slightly better version of the standard Newcastle Brown ale."
"Solid, very smooth, feel left something to be desired but overall delicious."
""
""
""
"Aroma far surpassed the flavor.  Finish was not there."
""
""
""
"Aroma roasted malt, chocolate, nuts, faint licorice & smoke. Taste sweet creamy malt, bread, cocoa, brown sugar, touch dark fruit."
""
""
""
"O: Great beer! One of my favourites!"
""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
"A really straight forward perfect porter. Give it a try."
""
""
""
"Overall, a good beer.  Not my favorite porter but it is definetly worth the purchase.  I will buy it again and depending on how my spaghetti sauce turns out, it may have become my go to beer for cooking chili, stews and sauces."

"Wow, really loved this one a lot. The color is dark brown with a khaki colored head that doesn't trail the glass. The smell was very decadent with hints of chocolate, sweet cream, and walnuts. The taste was just as tasty with chocolate and coffee being front and center and a little bit of smoke which evened everything out. Was very impressed and will definitely try again."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a perplexing beer for me, a difficult one to rate for sure. I want to smell this beer all day long, but then I get to the diacetyl and I'm not sure if I want another sip or not. Maybe I got a bad 4-pack, but I'm not positive. I can't decide if I want to drink the other two bottles I have left or cook with them."
""
"Lower abv than most modern American porters, but with more complexity.  Great beer."
"550ml bottle. Pours a deep ruby brown colour with a creamy tan head which lasted well and left lace plimsoll lines on drinking. Roasted malt aroma with hints of dark chocolate. Initial mild sweetness develops into a moderate roasted character and then into a lingering medium bitterness. Medium body and creamy texture. Very easy drinking. One for those that appreciate dark chocolate."

"Overall. Very easy drinking and tastes great. Can't believe I haven't had this classic before now ...or at least haven't reviewed it."

"550 ml bottle poured into a mug. At long last I am trying this classic. Dark chalky brown, near-black, with a moderate amount of rich creamy tan head rather like sponge toffee. Rich nose of semi-sweet chocolate, freshly turned soil, brown sugar, treacle, and a faint whiff of red berries perhaps.  Complex but not overbearing aroma notably in its earthy features. Palate is similarly earthy and vaguely sour, like cacao mixed with fruity molasses. Caramel develops on both nose and palate over the course of a few sips. Little in the way of caustic or rough bitterness despite the earthiness, which I'm thinking is hop-derived in part. Some cola-like brown spice. Smooth creamy mouth feel and moderate to thick bodied, with more of that odd chalky sourness in the semi-dry finish. Lingering caramel and raisin sweetness. Diacetyl from those those open square fermenters. Some of the written descriptions of this beer I've encountered may overstate this brew's ""smoky sour"" character but certainly this feature is present. I also get considerable sweetness of both dark and fruity varieties. Classic brew indeed and somehow light and mellow enough to enjoy in reasonable quantity."
"O: I'm a fan. This doesn't strike me quite as complex and tasty as an Edmund Fitzgerald, but it is a solid porter, and enjoyable. I think that's due to the heavy focus on the earthen flavors, which threaten to overpower the malt at times."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A classic porter with an understated complexity. It reminds me of fall, which is why I am drinking it...and any beer that has a unique enough taste ti invoke good memories is  a good one. It is earthy, mildly bitter, slightly sweet with a good finish. I love it!"
""
"Perfect for autumn evenings - when the leaves are flying and the temps begin to dip..."
""
"O- A fine porter I'd gladly re-visit."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This one is a touch less smooth than Samuel Smith's excellent Oatmeal Stout. It's still very smooth, though. It's not overly roasty like some porters and stouts. The sweetness doesn't get out of hand, either. This is an incredibly well balanced porter."

"Pours a near black in color with just a bit of small tan head. Average carbonation that leaves some nice lacing when sipped. Smells of coffee, with some chocolate with a hint of raisins or dark fruit. Overall taste is the same with a light bitter finish that wasn't bad at all. Actually a great porter."

"overall; an outstanding porter, very drinkable but very satisfying and interesting, will buy again fore sure."
"Overall: After having their imperial stout, I had high expectations, and they were met for the most part. Maybe a little lighter than I prefer, but hey, I'm an American spoiled on American beers. The flavors and aromas were balanced quite nicely however, and as my pallet has progressed, I've come to appreciate balance more. Not to offend anyone, but the dark fruit notes soley, remind me of Yuengling porter but turned up a few notches. The unsweetened bakers chocolate balances those notes well. This makes me want to give Fullers another try as I wasn't quite fond of it a while back. Maybe I have a soft spot for English beers after all. Only time will tell. For the meantime, this was another enjoyable offering from what is so far my favorite English brewery. Cheers!"

"I'm squinting a bit, as I strain to pick out the flavors in the mouth. It's admittedly a struggle, but there's real complexity. I'm thinking several fruits, with blueberry, among them! Rye bread, sort of greasy, like pizza crust. Mildly roasty malt, a yeasty tartness, and a hint of diacetyl dairy."

"O - The prototypical English Porter. Nothing mind blowing but always a treat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - what a fantastic session porter! goes down smooth, with the classic coffee and roasted malt porter flavours. the roasted flavours are kept in check, and the slightly higher than normal carbonation makes this beer more refreshing than anticipated. I wish I could get this on tap - A very good reason to visit Yorkshire I think!"

"-Enjoy!"

"Final Grade: 4.00, just eking out an A-. I've been searching a long time for a bottle of The Famous Taddy Porter, and finally my persistence has been rewarded. This is a remarkably well-made beer, and although it lacks the unusual flavours or intensity of many American porter interpretations, there's always going to be room for the classics in my fridge. I still like Fuller's LP more, but this is a good replacement that no stout/porter fan should neglect to try."

"Poured from a 22oz bottle into point glass. It has a black appearance with low to no transparency and a small tan head. It has a hoppy and roasted malt smell. It has a very roasted taste with a medium maltiness. It has a creamy mouth feel with a wet finish. Overall it's a nice porter with a good roasted character."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Awesome porter, very drinkable, 5%, not as bitter or roasted as some American porters but the balance is great, world class English porter."

"""A very dark, full bodied ale with a rich, creamy head and an intense dry, tangy character. Brewed with well water (the original well sunk in 1758 is still in use), malted barley, roasted malt, yeast, and hops. Fermented in 'stone Yorkshire squares.' The type of beer first brewed in the early 18th century; gained its name from being drunk by porters in the fish, meat, and other produce markets."""

"355 ml. bottle, pours, a black colour with a big head and there's always a ring and lace. Smell of chocolate, coffee, caramel, liquorice and some burnt wood. Creamy palate, so not full, taste is the same as smell, burnt notes more accentuated, but all is there: chocolate, coffee, caramel, and liquorice. Bitterswwet finish."

"An absolutely great beer. Classic example of an English Porter. Would love to try this fresh or on cask someday. Put it on the bucket list."
""
"O: Excellent example of the style. I would absolutely buy again. If it had a thicker body and few extra ABV points it would be a world class brew."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Expertly crafted from pure ingredients using a unique fermentation style gives this ale a special character that while subtle is not found in other examples of the style. Would love to try this on cask someday. Rated to style, it would be difficult to surpass (though I might prefer Meantime's London Porter over all)."
""
""
""
"Nice Porter, flavorful but not heavy. Very flexible, it could be a session beer or for slow drinking."
""
"The taste of this beer has convinced me that Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter is a masterful rendition of the style. The metallic nose leads me to suspect that there was something wrong with my bottle. I'll pick up another soon and re-review."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A really good beer, might be a wee bit heavy for most new to the style."

""

"for some personal context, i like Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout better. it's a cross-style comparison but the Oatmeal Stout is a bit more like chocolate and coffee; the Taddy Porter here is darker, a bit more burnt. BOTH are fantastic."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very nice, classic porter; great look and feel; taste is pretty much the blueprint for the style; enjoyable, tasty and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"This is probably my favorite porter that I have ever tried. I drank it a lot when I lived in England and still enjoy it from time to time in the U.S. (pretty affordable and widely available where I live). Perhaps the standard bearer for this style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall... a very nice porter, hops are present in a light style. Balanced in mouth even with a strong presence of liquorices and caramel"
""
""
"A smooth drinking beer. Another example of Sam Smith's well crafted beers."
""
""
""
""
"O: While it's decent enough, I can't help but be a little let down. I love the Imperial Stout from these guys, but this is only slightly above average. Maybe another porter I had earlier today (Anchor's porter) gave me unrealistic expectations. I wouldn't ever refuse it, at least."

"but well worth the search."

"Porter, the next best thing to a stout. Unless you grab a taddy porter. This is by far the best porter I have had to date and can stand up to most stouts and porters alike. The color is a dark rich brown almost black. The smell is great of coffee and malt. And the taste is balanced with coffee, malt, and a hint of chocolate. Truly a pleasure to drink. Samuel smith,s hits a home run with this one. Must try!"

""
"Pours a black color. 1/2 inch head of an off-tan color. Great retention and great lacing. Smells of oatmeal, sweet malt, hint of hop, hint of syrup, and a hint of roasted malt. Fits the style of an English Porter. Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, slight hop, hint of syrup, and hint of alcohol. Overall, very sweet aroma, good blend in the body, and decent feel."

"Good roast malt character, with enough chocolate for the style. Fairly complex, with the sherry and dark fruit notes. It's a little bitter at the finish."

""
""
""
""
"Poured a deep brown, with a gorgeous half-finger tan head. Very nice looking beer, very true to style. Scents of coffee, dark chocolate and a heavy roasted malt presence. Excellent. The taste is a classic porter. Roast malt, dark chocolate in the background, a bit of black coffee, some slight nuttiness and a dry finish, with a slight bit of tang throughout. Perfectly executed. Mouthfeel is true to form, with a medium body and medium carbonation. Overall an excellent porter, one of the best I've come across and well worth drinking."
""
"A great classic example of a porter, one that will always be tasty."
""
"Pours a very dark reddish brown in color. A light chocolate aroma. Taste begins with a bit of acidic twang, followed by some coffee, then finishing with some stone fruit. Mouthfeel is a little bit light. Overall quite a good porter that I would get again."
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is as sweet as the aroma suggests with a nice chocolate thing up front and a mellow but well balanced dry hopped finish. It feels more like an Irish dry stout at points. But this is the Porter that many try to emulate."
""
""
"Overall another great beer from Sam smiths, haven't been disappointed yet."
""
"O: For me, this is good but not great. I know its one of the standards of the style, but it just doesnt blow me away. That being said its a must try as it really is a classic beer from a classic brewery."
""
""
"Overall Impression: A nice English porter that brings great roasty flavor, sweet malty finish, but a smooth and medium bodied swig."
"Very dark black cherry look, clear, with a small fluffy head with minimal head lacing and retention. Smell is airy roasted malt, cocoa powder, and engish hops. taste is light roasted malt, malted barley, cocoa powder, earthy hops"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Medium bodied and slightly sour at the very end of the finish. I expected more power on the palate based on what I picked up on the nose."

"By far, one of the best all around and most true to form Porters I have ever had. There is really nothing to dislike about this brew. Pours a very dark red with khaki head with some retention. Fairly mild nose but plenty of chocolate, raisin, smoke, coffee and molasses. Taste follows suit with the perfect amount of sweetness, bitter chocolate, hops and roasted notes. Not heavy and overbearing like a lot of stouts and porters, but very drinkable. Medium mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. Overall, terrific beer... my new baseline for what a porter should be."

"I wanted to try this for a while, and I was not disappointed. Great!"
"Remarks: Did not score A, T, S, M at that time; disregard those scores"
""

"O- I expected a good beer when I picked it up, and I may have gotten a great one. The price is right on this one at just over $3, and they're really easy to find. I think I'll be buying more soon."

"Overall - What a beer! There's a lot going on here. This is what all other Porters hope to taste like when they grow up."

"A Beer, A beer, My Kingdom for a Beer, now If only I could afford to buy this Taddy Porter in Kegs. In conclusion, this is a perfectly blended Porter, one that is generous in both the iconic beauty of beer flavors while yet never being overbalanced in harmonious perfection. Clearly the legacy of Samuel Smith continues till this day and in my opinion stands out as a uniquely proud king of beers without equal."

"Taddy Porter is nearly opaque and the darkest oily brown color. A layer of tan sits on top and clings beautifully to the glass as well. The most incredible smells fill my nostrils as a breathe in the intoxicating aroma. Toffee, molasses, caramel, chocolate, roasted coffee bean, hazelnut, and light biscuit notes are present. The nose on this literally resembles a fine dessert. For the flavor, that toffee aspect dominates, but yet again with Samuel Smith's, we get a fantastic level of complexity for a low ABV beer. I can pick up some bittersweet hops, dark fruits, and smokiness along with the flavors previously detected in the aroma. The mouth feel is light to medium, and the finish is dry and pleasant. Another timeless classic... the perfect porter!"
""

"Really loved this beer! I need to taste more Porters for comparison, but it was very complex and well balanced. Maybe poured it too cold, but as it warmed the flavors opened up."

"this beer is divine, an English porter cannot get any better than this. it pours a luxuriously textured dark brown color with very little light coming in. the head is about two inches tall, and super creamy, light mocha in color. the nose is fantastically enticing, with a lot of milk chocolate notes from the malt, a bitterness from the roasted barley, and a hint of tartness to it as well from the hopping. the flavor is packed full with roasted malts, and is heavy on both the sweet and bitter chocolate components. this is even better than their acclaimed oatmeal stout, something about those stone fermenters really lets the yeast shine in all of their beers, and its an excellent complement to the dark bittersweet complexion of this porter. very little sweetness in the finish though, as the hops and burnt grains bitter it right up. full bodied and smooth as anything, I love the feel of this beer too. my only complaint is that its sold in four packs instead of six packs, I always seem to be wanting another one or two at the end of a session. wow this is just a splendid porter, an example to be followed on both sides of the atlantic!"

The aroma is dominated by tones of coffee and toast, and the taste also brings a background bread-like character. The medium, sly body is very well balanced with the hopness. At the end, a sensation of expresso and slight hopness among the teeth is very pleasing - just like the whole experience with this beer."

"550 ml bottle into imperial pint glass, bottled on 4/13/2012. Pours crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense and fluffy khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty foamy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of chocolate, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, toast, molasses, brown bread, raisin, light roasted malt, earth, and light herbal hops. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity; fairly light on strength. Taste of chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, toast, toffee, molasses, light coffee, brown bread, raisin, light nuttiness, earth, and herbal hops. Light earthy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, toast, toffee, roasted malt, light coffee, brown bread, raisin, earth, and herbal on the finish for a bit. Very nice balance of nicely robust flavors with good complexity; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and smooth mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a very nice English porter. Very nice robustness and balance of flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering as expected."

"Pours dark black with a decent head at pour. Little lacing. Aroma is smoked with the presence of pepper. Good flavor - definitely heavier, dark malts. Faint dark chocolate. Starts with a pleasant smoky flavor, then finishes with a slight chocolate but oddly also slightly sour flavor."
"O: An excellent beer. Wowza."

"Overall: I really liked this beer. From start to finished it was well-balanced and rounded, from the subtle sweetness to the full malt body to the slight bitterness at the end. I enjoyed the flavor it left on my tongue. Light and very drinkable for me."
""
"O - Awesome beer for what it is. Im used to more robust, aggressively flavored porters with a little more abv. But that's not what this beer is trying to be and thats fine, its good at what it does."
""
""
""
""
"Pitch Black with a slight, tan head that dissipates quickly leaving a small ring. Smoky aroma, like a camp fire gone cold. Full bodied, heavier than most porters. Burnt malt, strong coffee, not very complex but distinctive. This is probably as close to a stout as you can get and still be considered a porter. Excellent."

"O: A really nice, easy drinking beer. World class English Porter for a reason."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O: Famous is in the name for a reason. This is a great English porter with nice complexity that unwinds slowly. Great drinkability and price point, especially coming from across the pond. Highly recommended"
""
""
""
"Overall – A rather interesting take on a porter. While I am not a huge fan of the tanginess that comes into the taste toward the middle/end, it is somewhat intriguing. Other then the tanginess I enjoyed the flavors, feel and look of the brew. It is definitely worth a try."
"O: A great beer, definitely earns that ""famous"" designation on the label. It has to be one of the best porters ever."
""
""
""
"Overall - Maybe the king of porters, don't think I have had a better one"
"One of the best porters I have tried in some time, there is a great mix of fruits and chocolate and the body is great with very creamy feel. It went down wonderfully and left me wanting more after every sip."
""
""

"O: A pretty solid porter, no doubt. And for the price at my local grocer, it's hard to beat."

""

"An excellent porter with soul-soothing character. A smooth, rich, chocolatey mouth treat."
""
"O - Didn't realize that an English Porter could have that slightly soured character to it till I read the style description and the label, this beer definitely had it. Very smooth dark malts made this beer. Complex enough in the nose and definitely in flavor. Solid body with a good balanced feel."
""
""
"Overall, an excellent interpretation of the style. Nicely balanced, extremely smooth, and easy to drink. Just the right proportion of malt and aging."
"-Overall 4.5: Certainly one of the top if not THE best porter I have ever enjoyed. I cannot stress enough the creaminess and the butteriness of this beer. I imagine it would go good with food, but should be (IMHO) consumed on its own, so that the taster can hit all the flavor profiles present in this amazing brew. Recommended."

"This beer was incredibly hyped up to me before I finally tried it. Did it live up to the hype? It's hard to say. Probably not. Nevertheless, is it a good beer? Absolutely. One of the most complex flavor profiles for a porter I've had that still manages to keep your attention without going too far out-of-bounds. At 5% ABV, this is something you could drink all night. Solid porter."

"O - Classic porter from a classic brewery. Surprised by how smooth and easy it drinks for a porter. Feels almost like a milk stout. Makes for a good session beer at 5% ABV."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours dark brown (almost black) with a tall creamy brown head. The head actually hangs around for a while, leaving some lacing on the side of the glass. The nose is filled with aromas of dark roasted malt and chocolate. I picked up a hint of toffee in the smell as well. The taste absolutely follows the nose. The dark roasted malt, chocolate, and toffee flavors blend well and coat the mouth. I have to say I catch some coffee notes as well. It's not too sweet, so it's just right to make this balanced. The body is medium with a creamy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. The finish is pretty clean and smooth. The drinkability is very high. This is a most excellent beer."
"The obvious brewing skill and small touches show why this beer (like most from Samuel Smith's) is a classic. However, with the speed of innovation in the porter style and in craft beer in general, this beer may be relegated to more infrequent consumption. When I have this, though, it is very drinkable and disappears quickly."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: A very good porter. The malts could be a bit more assertive against the esters, but tasty nonetheless."
""
""
"I had saved this beer in my fridge for a relatively special occasion and decided to go for it tonight after finishing some code (nerdy I know). Although this is a damn good beer, it failed to meet my admittedly high expectations based on the Nut Brown. The flavor was good, just not irresistible like the brown. I might pick this up again now and then, but there are plenty of American porters that I like better than this and can be had for less."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Dverall this is a very good example of an English Porter but a but watery overall and could use a bump in the body to be great. Not to the level of Fuller's London Porter but a solid sessionable Porter for those winter months."
"O - One of the porters I summon when I feel the occasion calls. There are notes that are not found elsewhere, although the faults are worth taking note. Not perfect, yet represents the fine craftsmanship of the brewery."
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall, I could drink this very frequently. Dang near perfect."

"O: a venerable beer; should be on everyone's ""try"" list - I'm not a real fan of the style, but this is a classy beer"
""

"O - Easily the best porter I have drank thus far and one of the best beers; Samuel Smith has yet to disappoint and this beer is no exception; I would highly recommend this to any beer enthusiast and look forward to drinking more of these in the future."

"Final Thoughts: Samuel Smith's is probably my favourite English brewery, and I'm sure a lot of people say that. The best part is that this is a beer for all seasons, as I could even happily drink this in the summer heat, which is something that many Porters simply can't say. This is just another exceptional brew from another exceptional brewery and famous for a reason."
""
""
"O: This is the English porter against which all others must be measured. One of the most complex beers I've had to date; a new flavor presents itself with each sip. It really doesn't get much better than this."
""
"O: Very good! A slightly hoppy dark porter. Well done, but might benefit from more sweetness."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Thick patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, slight cocoa and coffee, and some dark fruit and port wine aromas. Taste is mildly tart and is of roasted malt, cocoa powder, caramel/toffee, and some slight dark fruit flavors. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is easy to drink but I enjoy the smell more than the taste."
"Overall: Easily one of the best in the style. It's not the most complex or intense, but it's highly drinkable with a ton of flavor. So creamy."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Probably the pinnacle for the style. I prefer a bit more sweetness like in American porters, but this is as good as an English porter gets. I'd like more alcohol, but this is close to perfection."
"O - Nice balance and flavor integration."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"O - Very impressed with this beer. A very well balanced porter that is smooth and goes down well. Slightly lacks in body to be right up there with the best but great nonetheless."
""
""
"Opaque in color with a nice mahogany colored head that last until the glass is empty and leaves sticky lace draped on the sides. Smells like bakers chocolate with vanilla. Very dry and roasted in flavor with hints of chocolate, coffee, nuts, and vanilla. Bitter acidic taste in the middle. Again reminds me of bakers chocolate. The flavors are subtle but blend real well for perfect balance. The dry finish and mouthfeel is what makes this beer stand out above other outstanding porters. Excellent session porter and I don't really see how you could do better."
""
""
""
"Samuel Smith beers are consistently excellent. Or so I thought. This is not as good as I remember. It's a good English Porter, but it's really not remarkable in any way. I would probably have rated this higher if my expectations were lower."
"Overall: A very nice and well put together porter. The only thing I think would improve it is a bit more body. The price is pretty high, but so is the quality."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a small off-white head. The aroma has quite of bit of chocolate and brown malt, as well as a hint of mint. The flavor is similar. What comes through the strongest is a slightly smokey chocolate character, with a hint of mint and dark fruit. The beer is very creamy. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very nice."
""
""
""
""
"Overall – This is an outstanding beer, one that I would absolutely buy, drink again, and recommend. That being said, I will still take a Deschutes Black Butte Porter over this one for price, availability, and quality. This is an excellent brew, but I think I like the American porters style a little better."
"O: Extremely easy to drink, sessionable, and enjoyable. This is one of the first British beers that I ever tried, early in my craft beer drinking experience and I fell in love with it. Well, I have to say this really stood the test of time because I still think it is pretty amazing."
""
""
""
""
"O: Nice night cap to drink with dried fruit and crackers. easy to drink and straight forward flavours that are simple and well defined."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Since it isn't super rich like some Stouts/American Porters it drinks very nicely. Good balance of flavor and a nice overall porter."

""
""
"I definitely think this beer falls inline with the other quality offerings from Sam Smith."
""
"In a bottle and from Whole Foods in DC for $5.99. What a great porter. No aftertaste. Hints of coco, coffee, and burnt vanilla. It's also listed at stores for $2! It was thinner in body than expected and I liked that. I didn't feel like I was getting full. On rate beer it's listed as a 98 and 99. 5% etoh. I would consider this a good starter porter."
"To drink at cellar t° (13 °C)."
"This was consumed at room temperature. The aromas were the only real let down, but this is a quality english porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is my favorite porter, and the standard I compare all other porters to."
""
""
""
"Even through this beer nails the style category, I personally was not a huge fan of it. The overwhelmingly dry, bitter, roastiness was simply too much to handle, and the thin body left something to be desired."

""

""
""
""
"Overall, very tough to beat."

"O: Every bit deserving as one of the best English Porters out there. Only slightly edged out by Fuller's (which I'll be having next!)"
"O- A delicious and interesting porter. The gold standard for he style."
""
""
"Smooth as silk. What a great beer. It gets better as it goes down."
"O- This is a beer that I'd definitely return to. It doesn't go overboard in any way and is consistent throughout. Nice example of an English Porter."
""
"Smooth and creamy with low amount of carbonation. It just glides down. Drying."

""
""
"Overall, a reference-quality English porter. I'm sure there are better ones out there, but this one is good and always readily available."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Good beer, worth a try."

"Overall - An old original, has held it's own over time. What this lacks in strong flavors, it makes up for in smooth, creamy, beautifully carbonated mouthfeel."
""
""
""

"Pours black/deep brown with a light colored coffee head. Nice lacing and retention. Aroma of sweet caramel, nuttiness, a bit of dark fruit, nice for the style. Flavor follows. Good nuttiness to start to go along with a milky caramel sweetness. Hints of creamy coco before a dark fruit finish with a light touch of crisp hops as well. Top notch in the style. Smooth and dry mouthfeel."

"O: This beer is very interesting. The aroma is unbelievably complex - I was floored as to how many things I was able to smell. However, the flavor just wasn't quite as good. Solid, but not great."
""
""
"The beer is very dark brown in color, nearing black, with an off-white head. Sweet toffee and molasses along with a lot of roasted malt. Perhaps a hint of coffee and licorice, too. The flavor has plenty of roasted malt, but it is not overwhelming. A bit of dark chocolate, licorice, molasses, and maybe some coffee. Just slightly dry on the finish as well."
""
" Overall, a standard of an english porter. Full, yet easy drinking, finishes clean and nicely balanced. Well done."
""
"Appearance is black with a good bubbly head. This beer is so good. Dark chocolate and coffee, smooth and creamy, with a wet finish. Not too strong at 5.0 abv...this is an easy drinking beer with so much flavor and class. As far as porters go, this truly sets the bar high. Let's go Rangers!! Cheers!!"

"O: It deserves a try for sure, good understanding of a porter. Remember to drink around 13ºC"

"Moderate body, lightly carbonated, and a dry finisher. Taddy Porter is probably one of the best English Porters that I've had. It's robust, easy drinking, and quite tasty."
"O: Awesome imperial stout. Only 5% means you can have multiple brews. Great flavors and aromas."

"Overall: A benchmark porter, one that is very drinkable. I can only drink one beer of the very smoky ones, but this I could have a few."
""
""
""
""
"Overall fantastic. I love this beer."
""
""
""
""
"O: I’ve never had the pleasure of “grabbing a quick pint” at a pub in the UK, but I can imagine that this must be a fairly respectable representation. A real treat."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This was the more fruity of the two porters. Both are excellent, but I liked Fuller's just a bit more."
""
""
""
""
"Smells like a porter, with a bit of coffee. The taste is wonderful. What got me is the metallic zing that really makes my mouth water and pucker. I'm a sour nut, and while this isn't sour at all, that metallic-ness brings out that similar mouth watering sensation that sours have. Real nice."
"Medium bodied, the medium carbonation on this keeps it light and almost stings the tongue. The beer is creamy goodness."

"pours a dark brown, but settles in black as night with a finger and a half of tan frothy head. two minutes later a seafoam cap is left floating on top with patchy lacing as a reminder of what once was. smell is typical for porters, roasted malts give off decent aromas of coffee, chocolate and caramel. taste provides the same, except with a metallic taste mixed in. mouthfeel is aa rich slick medium body with the metallic flavor making me pucker. also has a slight bitter end from the coffee flavors. overall i feel there are better porters that should be sought out before this one, namely founders, fullers and great lakes. however if none of them are available this is a decent starter porter for someone."
""
"Mouthfeel is thin."
""
""
"An excellent porter. Highly recommend to all."
"Pours a dark brown with a nice fluffy head of a dusty offwhite foam. Great voluminous retention and some decent lace, even for the serving vessel. Nose has some cocoa, some Sam Smith hard water/metallic notes, a creamy sweetness with even a hint of tartness. Taste has some copper, some dark fruit notes and a bit of milk chocolate and again, a shade of some tartness. Mouthfeel is medium light, with a bit of roast in the finish. Low carbonation. A nice porter, but I can't seem to get past these copper notes - it's like sucking on a penny. I've experienced this to differing degrees in Sam Smith beers, but this one (or at least this bottle) seems to have it in substantial amounts."
"O: Overall it's a nice sweet beer without being syrupy or heavy. It would work great as a dinner beer where you don't want to have a strong overpowering flavor. It would also work well with a dessert. I would drink it again, but it's not the best porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Very solid English Porter. Not quite as good as Fullers London Pride (IMO) but a close second and miles ahead of anything else that I've had."
""
"Overall, this beer is just about perfect. It's delicious with complex flavors that work hand in hand. If you like porters, do check this one out."
""
"Well done, Samuel Smith."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So the first time I had a Samuel Smith beer, it had that metallic taste to it that kind of ruined it for me (why I've never reviewed the oatmeal stout), and I noticed hints of that at points in here, but either it went away or I just topped noticing it, because by the second half of the bottle, it wasn't a problem. I'll be honest: I didn't feel that this lived up to the billing it seems to have received as one of the premiere brews of it's style. It's not a bad beer by any means, certainly enjoyable, but I didn't feel that it was the life changing end all be all of porters that it seems to have been attributed as being. Check it out. Decide for yourself."

"O: This is an excellent English porter. I've yet to find a Samuel Smith beer that disappoints me."

"Drinkability: A solid version of the black stuff. Drinking a couple more would give me a heinous hangover, but it would be well worth it."
"O - Man I really love this beer. A bit on the pricey side so I don't get a chance to try this very often but it is so very good."
""
""
""
"M: Dry and chalky, but with a center that resembles a stout. Very drinkable for such a tasty porter."
""
""
""
"It's a good beer but just not the best porter I've had. Lacks the malty pop I kind of expected and the off twang detracts a bit. One of my favorite breweries, but not their best beer in my opinion."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- This porter is not going to be the mouth-punch Edmund Fitzy or the like is, but it does a great job of just being a chill porter. Sit back and idle the day away with one of these in your glass and five more waiting for you in the cooler. Cheers!"
""
""

"Moderately creamy but with a body that’s on the thinner side, medium carbonation, very sessionable. Not as profound and complex as some of the contemporary porters but still an exemplar of the style."

"Very dark, almost pitch black when poured into a glass. Main smell is sweet... this may sound weird, but it almost smells like a mix between coffee with cream, and a banana. Something about the fruit notes smell very banana like to me. The taste is creamy, has a sweet taste, almost like coffee and cream. Slightly tangy on the other side, with more of sour taste then bitter per say. Mouthfeel is solid, good carbonation, starts creamy, less so as it warms up. Overall I really like this beer, but I can't say it's something I want to drink on a normal basis. The smell and taste is a very interesting profile, and not what I was expecting. I'm actually quite glad I had this, but I will probably only drink it occasionally."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very unimpressed given the beer's reputation. Skip this one and just go straight to the Samuel Smith Imperial Stout."
"O - Quite easily the best porter I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Each different aspect of this beer complements the next so well. It's a beautiful thing."

"Pours a dark brown color with a slowly disapating head. Scent is that of mixed malts, some roasted, a little hazelnut, and other roasted scents. Taste is smooth with a bit of a bitter/dry tone. Not exactly watery but the taste feels very light on the taste buds. A nice slow drinking pub kind of beer that drinks great. Very easy to see why it's called The Famous Taddy Porter."
"3.0 D: I don't know how the nose is so good while the taste is so mediocre. Either way, for some reason I expected a lot out of this brew and good very little."
"Pours a deep, root beer looking color with awesome frothy head; great lacing that slides along the glass. Smell is dominated by mild coffee and malted chocolate. Taste is superb: coffee; light, sweet chocolate; molasses. Excellent brew. Seek this one out!"
"Solid. Nothing more to say. Earthy, chocolatey, the perfect balance of dry and sweet. There are many better examples, but its easy to see how they grew from this."
"O: A pretty good beer, solid flavor profile. Just wish it was a little thicker and creamier."
"O: At times Samuel Smith disappoints me, but this is obviously not one of those times. This is the best drink they have offered me and when the claim it's ""The Famous Taddy Porter"" they are not lying."
"Smooth, almost creamy in texture, this slides down the throat far to easily, luckily it leaves a rich film of the aforementioned flavours on your teeth. This leads you into thinking it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, but you can’t tell because you’ve already taken another great swig of the beer; and so it goes on until you are spent and there is no more. A great beer and so, so easy to drink."
"A good tasting beer with many layers of flavor, but that flavor may be just a little too subtle. Not as as sturdy or robust as Fuller's London Porter this is nevertheless an excellent beer. The lack of the smokiness of this beer, which Fuller's has makes this a lighter and easier to drink but perhaps slightly less memorable British Porter. Still, this is a fine beer and quite enjoyable."
"This is a great porter. Subtleties make this one complex and it's well blended nature make it an easy drinker."
"My third review from Samuel Smith and at 4.25 this is my lowest rated one, amazing brewery"
"O: What you would expect from an english porter, in both a good and bad way. Nothing crazy/new/interesting flavor wise, but very well balance, well crafted and flavorful. Quite sessionable and about as much flavor as a 5% beer will carry. Good beer to have with a hearty meal (would make a great breakfast beer). Glad I tried it."
"Low ABV, smooth drinkability, and wide availability makes this extremely session-able and a nice go to beer for the colder months. Perhaps a bit pricey at $11 for a 4 pack."
"Go to English porter."
"Overall, i must say that this was a much better than average beer. It's not so pricey that i can't have it every once in a while, for which i am grateful. I am definitely looking forward to my next bottle of Taddy Porter."
"Overall - Really, for an English Porter, this is fabulous beer. No tinkering necessary with craft."
"o - Overall an above average porter with something a little weird in the nose. Taste is pretty good and very sweet and roasted, and the mouthfeel is great. Would give another shot but not my favorite porter."
"M- The mouthfeel of this beer is long-lived. It begins with a sharp carbonation and mouthfeel quickly changes to a lingering dryness, which mimics that of a merlot or shiraz wine. The slight burnt flavor and dryness both likely arise from the roasted malts which go into this beer."
"Overall: A porter with a strong English character. Solid and accessible, but not dazzling."
"Taste is mellow, crisp and smooth, a light hop bite but well balanced with the caramel malt flavors. The body is very light and watery, it almost tastes (and looks) like a nitro beer. Finish is crisp and smooth making my lips feel ever so slightly sticky."
"Pours black with an inch and a half of cream/tan colored head, really nice lacing and solid retention. Smells like creamy roasted malt, dry woodiness, faint dark fruit, dark chocolate, with some cherry and vanilla extract coming to the surface as it warms. Taste is mostly restrained roasted malt, finishing dry and slightly minerally. Light carbonation and medium-light body. Overall, this is a pretty good porter, quite drinkable but perhaps a bit one dimensional on the taste. I don't like my porters super roasty porters, and this one manages to be restrained enough to be drinkable."
"Definitely in the top tier of porters"
"O: its the standard in this style If you ask"
"It's hard for me to pick a winner, so I'll cop out and also give this one 4.5s across the board. I read porter has fallen out favor in Britain, which is a shame if it means the Britons aren't drinking as much of this delicious brew."
"O: A damn good beer that surprised me on all fronts. I really like the conception of porters I've gained from American styles, but if this is what a real British portertastes like, than I would love to try more samples of them."
"O - Overall, I don’t particularly like this beer. It doesn’t scream porter to me, but I could just be used to the American porters. The sweetness just wasn’t what I was looking for. If that’s your scene, this is the beer for you, just not what I wanted."
"Overal a good porter."
"This poured out with a nice deep brown colored body. the head was a light tan color that actually have a good amount of retention and lacing for a porter. The smell of the beer had plenty of roasted dark malts aromas and some light earthy hops aromas too. The taste of the beer was a little metallic at first buy faded nicely as the beer warmed up. The flavored of chocolate and sweet malts were dominant in this brew. The mouthfeel of the beer was creamy and rich with a good carbonation level. Overall it's a damn good porter."
"O: My first English Porter, it reminds me a lot of a cross between an American Nut Brown and an American Porter; dark malt, chocolate and coffee mixed with more caramel, toffee, wood and nuttiness. Not as much roasted character as I like in dark beers, but overall pretty pleasant."
"Overall: A great Porter from Samuel Smith with an interesting mixture of dark malts and fruity flavor."
"The beer appears black (dark brown at the edges when held to the light) with an inch of thick beige head. As the cap slowly recedes, it leaves a sheet of lacing cascading down the pint glass. The aroma has a strong chocolate presence, with some roasted malt behind. The flavor continues with a tasty chocolate character, with a hint of coffee, and a nice bready, malty finish. A really tasty beverage. I can't believe I haven't had this before. The chocolate component is perhaps a bit heavy, but overall, the flavor is pleasant. Not too sweet. I could throw back a few pints of this. I bet this is fantastic on cask."
"Overall: Good beer overall. Another fine offering from Samuel Smith. The only thing holding this one back is that the flavor seems to fade too quickly. Definitely worth a shot."
"I still like the oatmeal stout better, but that is purely personal preference. This one pulls its weight for sure. They don't call it ""The Famous Taddy Porter"" for nothing. This is a classic beer for sure and a signature aspect of Sam Smith's lineup."
"O: Very average porter. Wouldn't buy again and not SS's best."
"A lighter sytle of porter, very good beer!"
"D: very easy drinking English Brown Porter. just not my favorite style, but still quaffable."
"Appearance 4/5; Aroma 4/5; Taste 3/5; Mouthfeel 4/5; Overall 4/5"
"O – Its been said a million times but this is just a great porter. Very drinkable. Great taste. Winner all the way around."
"D - well balanced"
"D ~ This beer sets the standard for Porter, English or otherwise. One of my favorites on a Sunday."
"The color is like Black Garnet when held up to the light. This and several others are making me a Porter lover!"
"It's fairly thin in terms of mouthfeel, but then that's the style. It's appropriate. Overall, this is a textbook English Porter. It's very enjoyable."
"Please message me with any recommendations on similar porters/stouts."
"Overall, a great traditional British porter. Paired well with Saturday morning football."
"Overall, this is a very good English Porter, tasty, yet very easy to drink."
"Overall, very good."
"The biggest letdown really was the mouthfeel. I really expect something amazing from Samuel Smith's when it comes to easing the pallet, and this beer just didn't deliver. Carbonation just killed the feeling. But for all I've said, still a good beer and worthy of a taste."
"O: A straightforward porter. Easy to drink with any occasion. Goes down smooth but it’s not earth shattering."
"The beer is a very dark brown, not quite opaque, The head is tan, tall and foamy. It smells of maple syrup, caramel and roasted with a slight tang. The beer is big on roasted malt and it's very metallic and tangy, there is also a hint of coffee and molasses. It's medium bodied with some stinging carbonation and a very dry finish. This is a great porter with a nice tang to it."
"Notes: this one is reminiscent of Guinness Extra Stout, and that is certainly a good thing."
"O-one of the few beers that continues to get better as you drink it. if i were to suggest one thing, it'd be to drink this warmer than colder. it is a smooth a great drinking porter, much more easy to drink than some of the more flavorful porters. my 12 ounce bottle disappeared rather quickly and i was sad when it was gone."
"O - I'm surprised I took so long to pick this one up. On the scale of porters this one is on the top of the spectrum."
"Overall, this is one great beer and definitely would have again and again!"
"Pours dark brown, pretty much opaque, with a nice thick tan head. This beer has a lovely roasted barley aroma with hints of alcohol, chocolate and coffee. This is a pretty full bodied beer with an almost syrupy mouthfeel. It has a lovely roasted character with definite notes of malts, chocolate, some coffee and very subtle hops in the background. The beer finishes with bitter roasted cocoa. Pretty drinkable for being such a heavy beer, one of my favorite porters."
"This beer pours a deep, dark brown with auburn tones in the light. It's got half-inch head and lacing throughout. The aroma is of chocolate with roasted malt and hints of coffee and toast. The flavor is very complex and balanced, beginning with dark chocolate followed by cocoa powder and coffee with milk chocolate and some slight molasses notes in the finish. The mouthfeel is creamy and full. Samuel Smith's, The Famous Taddy Porter is an excellent beer, Smooth, complex, balanced, and drinkable. A perfect example of the style. Highly recommended!"
"This beer was around average slightly above. Nothing really stuck out with this beer. It had some nice creamy tastes to it, but as the beer went on that some what faded. I believe the attempt was to do a light porter, which was pretty good but nothing that really caught my attention. It wasn't a bad beer. If some one handed me a free one I would definitely drink it, but there isn't anything that made me come away wanting more."
"O - Pretty much the perfect dark beer. I am really holding myself back from giving this all 5's, as I am not quite sure how they'd improve it. This is the top of the line as far as craft beer goes."
"Notes: Overall, one of the more complex English porters. This stuff is awesome. Full-bodied, yet incredibly drinkable in a session setting. I've had this beer numerous times, and every time I have it, I sense more and more. It just goes to show how world-class the brews that Sam Smith has to offer. A benchmark beer for this style."
"O: Well-balanced, but not huge in the palate; there are some breweries that could learn a thing or two from old Sammy Smith. I don’t always want an extreme, flavor-fisting, palate-raping meltdown of 10%+ ABV when I’m drinking a dark beer. Sometimes I just want a solid, flavorful beer with a palate so versatile that I can drink it casually. And that’s exactly what Taddy Porter’s all about."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell has som e choco;ate, roasted malts. Taste is the same, roasted malts with chocolate, maybe a hint of coffee. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall is a high quality beer."
"D-Overall i like this brew, It was very creamy and smooth but still had great balance and great flavors coming out. It might have felt alittle thin at times even with the creamyness comin through. Would get this again for sure"
"Taste was creamy as expected and a slight bitterness on the finish. Very sweet and coffee like. As it warmed the bitterness ramped up slightly, but didn't become anything bad. This beer tasted good cold and slightly warmed. Mouthfeel was heavy and carbonation was good. This beer tasted just as it looked; creamy and sweet. Good beer, but I probably won't revisit it."
"Drink- To think I never had this, to me was a crime against beer. This should be on a list for noob beer drinkers. Introduces layering to the palate and just very well done. I'd have this again for sure."
"The appearance o this beer is the best part. It pours a dark brown to almos black color with a huge fluffy tan to light brown head. The smell is sweet and chocolatey. The tasted follows through with a slightly sweet almost cola like aspect. There is no hop flavor present in the beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth. Overall not at all what I was expecting but good none the less."
"O: Recommended! Would drink again; very drinkable. A sweetish porter, but one of the greats."
"D/O- I believe this to be my first porter love back in the day and it's been awhile since I've had one but it still holds it's own as one of the best in the style. Unexpectedly low abv for as much flavor as it packs."
"My pour created just better than a finger of light-brown head with decent retention. Color was a deep, dark brown with ruby/garnet/mahogany highlights. Nose was chocolaty with a slight underlying tang. Mouthfeel was medium and it had a smoky chocolatiness to it on the tongue. Finish was quite smoky, charcoal-like in its intensity, very dry. Wow! This is probably the exemplary beer for its style, but I had forgotten its intensity as compared to a lot of the American versions. I would definitely drink it again, but not on a hot summer's day after weeding the backyard."
"Pours black, brown on the edges, and is somewhat translucent. There is a chunky tan froth atop the brew initially, which recedes to an encircling wisp in short order. The nose is roasty and nutty with faint hints of smoke and soy sauce. There is also a plum-like dark fruitiness. The flavor delivers on the advertising of the aroma; hints of smoke are subtle yet especially impactful. Fruity notes are more subdued, nutty impressions are stronger and toastier, and there is a hint of alcohol on the finish which adds to the robust character. The feel is silky and creamy, and just what I like from the style. Overall this is a very nice brew, and a solid example of the style. Given the brewer, I'd expect nothing less."
"O- Insanely drinkable. A very simple but top-notch porter, I really never get tired of drinking this beer."
"an enjoyable english, my favorite samuel smith's offering to date."
"Pours a dark brown / black with a nice brown med head, with good lacing. Nose is dark roasted malts with some cacao, dark fruitiness. Taste is roasted malts, cacao, some plums. Palate is nice med to full body, with nice carbonation, nice smooth mouthfeel. Finish is sweet roasted caramel malts, cacao, with a nice light licorice flavor, and some light bittering hops add some balance. overall a very good creamy and smooth porter. Very nice"
"Don’t get me wrong, it’s good. But it’s not great. Nothing to brag about. It has a pretty cool story, regardless."
"I could drink this all day. Love it."
"Overall still impressive, but I think there's a few others I prefer than this. But this could do anytime for sure."
"O: Always satisfies. /thread"
"O - A tasty english porter and a solid sample of the style. Grab one for yourself because I know I'll be grabbing another!"
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth as always. Overall, Taddy Porter is a classic English Porter. A bit less robust and sweeter than some of the Porters coming out of America's craft breweries but delicious nonetheless."
"Just an amazing beer and really the prototype for English porters. Wish i could get this fresh, but pretty solid as is."
"Drinks very well and really has a unique complexity to it. This could be pretty sessionable. A nice well rounded beer."
"O: This was a real treat for a free beer handed to me at work. I had no idea this was so good. Best porter I've ever had, hands down."
"I seems you cannot go wrong with this brewery; despite the high price and no freshness dates, every product I have tried has been very fresh. There are many great American porters, but if you are seeking an English version, this is the one to choose."
"NOTE: If there were marks for Value, I would be forced to give it a fairly low rating. Reason being, Edmund Fitzgerald is available for $9/6-pack, while Taddy is $10/4-pack. Just not worth the $$ when a superior product is available for less. But if you have no other options, it's a decent choice."
"Taste is charcoal, malt, bitter, cocoa. This is a really complex drink that gets better with every sip. You would never know this is NOT a high gravity beer. The lighter alcohol does lead to a slightly watery mouth feel. I know, I am spoiled with all the American thick stuff. Flavorwise, this one is really good."
"the taste brings out the vanilla and liqurice more clearly. A bit of roasty bitterness there aswell. There is a thick and almost a little creamy body, and breathing out through the nose, it burns a little bit of alcohol there."
"This is an excellent porter. Hits the spot with complex flavors and perfect balance."
"I’ve found the other stouts from Samuel Smith to be underwhelming if not down right poor examples of their style. This porter gives me renewed hope that this brewery can actually make good beer. Very possibly the best dark beer from the UK (not barrel aged), but that’s really not saying too much."
"Taste dark cherries up front followed by bitter coffee. Finishes dry with rum/raisen notes."
"O: Definitely a good porter. Not as great as I remember in the past. Fullers is far superior for an English Porter IMHO. That said...this is nicer than many."
"This beer pours a black with a small creamy tan head that stayed with the beer. The smell is a bit smokey very roboust and heavy. The taste is initally watery, but then a dry smoked flavor hits the palettee. Nice carrbonation for a porter. Overall a bit different but fantastic."
"Overall, what we found most enjoyable about this brew was the creamy mouthfeel, helped along by the deep mocha head. As a whole this seemed to be characteristic of an “English Porter”. The slight bitterness and sourness was indicative of the style, and more specifically, something coming out of the UK. What detracted a bit for us was the overwhelming carbonation which, while it lent to the head and mouthfeel, became bothersome by the end."
"Although a little dark for a porter, this is nonetheless an outstanding brew. Nearly stout-worthy, this is a very enjoyable beer."
"O- 2 Reasons why I would move to England. 1) To follow the Barclays Premiere League 2) To drink Samuel Smith's on the regular. I have yet to come across a Samuel Smith's beer that has dissapointed me. Could definitely session this. Not the best porter, wouldn't say it should be called famous, but I'd definitely call it good."
"D. I expected this to be a bit sweeter than it is. Creamy sweetness rather than caramel notes that I expected. My wife's pick to pair with a seafood dinner for her birthday."
"O - Pretty good beer. I haven't had many English Porters, but if this is one of the best, I'll stick with the American style."
"When you put ""famous"" on your beer's label, it better be darn good. This beer is. It's varied, well-balanced, and just really tasty (though it could do with a touch less sweetness). And with the low ABV, it's a very sessionable porter."
"O - Taddy packs a wallop of flavor without the necessity of pesky heavy alcohol our American versions have. Highly drinkable, it's a session porter if there ever was one. God bless the English brews."
"O- A super easy drinking porter. If the price wasn't so high compared to many of the other great porters (about 2x oz for oz compared to Anchor Porter, SN Porter, etc.) it would be a regular purchase. Not as good as some make it out to be, but I can dig it."
"The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with just enough carbonation, and the drinkability is quite good, even if it drinks like a stronger brew than 5.0% ABV. This was another great dark brew from Sam Smith."
"Pours out near black in color with a foamy brown head and a opaque blackness that is mesmerizing. It has an aroma of roasted malts, chocalate, and medicinal hops. Very nice. Tastes of roasted malts, chocolate, toffee, grassy grains, and medicinal hops. Mouthfeel is thick and coating and wetting. Overall this is a gorgeous beer and a best in class porter."
"This porter has it all. ""The Famous"" Taddy Porter is right. This beer is creamy, smooth, tastey and down right delicious. Compared to other porters the biggest difference in this one is the mouthfeel - at times this can be a little ambiguous with beer but when this fills your mouth you will appreciate this category. The smell and taste are the perfect Goldilocks - 3 bears blend of just right. Not too much, not enough - just right."
"This is a great beer and feels brighter and lighter on the tongue than the color suggests; however, the dark brew yummy flavors are still hidden in there, so you are not ""skimped""of flavor. A wonderful beer and I will absolutely go for it again."
"overall - I was blown away by this porter. It is my first brew from Samuel Smith and I am a believer, looking forward to their oatmeal stout. I will definitely pick up more of these. I paid $4 for this 550ml bottle and to me that is a steal. Truly an amazing porter. World class. I might get another tonight!"
"Overall - Fantastic. All you could want in a beer. Flavor, balance, low alcohol and seems to be avaible most places. Easy a top 5 porter on the planet."
"O - Hard to beat this porter as it offers a lot"
"Pours very dark, slightly ruby with an off white head, didn't last long but more than likely it was the way my glass was cleaned. Sweat, almost yeasty aroma. Tangy in the flavor, a nice balance of sweet, bitter, and slight roasty notes in the middle, finishes dry with hints of chocolate. One of the better aftertastes you'll have drinking beer, stays in the mouth like sweet coffee."
"D- Very high, even with all the roastiness this is one that you can enjoy from start to finish any time of the day. Just a really good example of what a porter should be."
"M/D: The texture is so well rounded in this beer that it's hard do recognize any sort of bite in the finish. Each sip goes down smooth and carbonation is perfect to allow the flavors to show through and not come off too rough."
"Smooth creamy mouth-feel with flavors of malt and chocolate with a tinge of smokiness. Also has hint of roastiness but no burnt/coffee like flavors. Incredibly smooth, sweet, and easy drinking. Medium acidic bite typical of porters."
"I feel this would be a great thirst quencher while eating a hearty roast."
"Overall, excellent. Quite a satisfying porter. A top beer in my book, and another excellent beer from Samuel Smith."
"Deep ruby brown with a tan brown mocha color to the massive sized head leaving definite clear rings of lacing to it. Slight fruity approach mixture of hops in there to balance out the semi smoked deep roasted malts that provide chocolate and some coffee tones very nice.Definitely an acquired bitterness with a pleasant array of rolling sharp sweet tones blended with the coffee and chocolate available along with a sharp ale yeast driven fruitiness. a bit thin and needs some texture"
"Appearance is dark brown with big off-white head. Taddy Porter smells like roasted malts, nuts and dark chocolate; very low-key. It tastes quite nice, with roasted barley, plum, dark chocolate and other flavors coming across. MF is just right for a porter with a proper carbonation level. This classic from Sam Smith drinks well, another very good beer from them."
"D: The smoothness aids drinkability dramatically; an enjoyable beer, and I'll be picking this one up again... expecting I may like it even more the second time around."
"drinkability is great. nice balance. a good example for the english porter style."
"Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with medium carbonation. Goes down a bit harsh, but alright. Thanks Russ!"
"Damn, you really have to let this sit for a long while to reap its rewards, cherish its charms. At times it's nearly watery, and then it turns around and goes prickly slick. Teasing, dryish. Real good. Nothing to drink a 4-pack, slowly. Take your time."
"The CPJ"
"Poured a 2"" head which dissipated to 1/4"". Clear dark raw umber color. The smell is divine with ample coffee, chocolate, and malt. Taste is a little more subdued than the smell but still has all those same things, plus a little tart zing and a pretty long finish. Not really unique or special but nonetheless a classic example of a good porter."
"Overall I was very pleased with this brew as I am with all the Samuel Smith's brews. Definitely will have more of these in the future."
"Notes: I definitely recommend this porter, awesome flavor with a dark creamy feel to it. It lives up to the hype."
"However, like most porters I do not find them to be...enough. That is why I have a bias towards stouts. Porters to me are like baby stouts, that is, they aren't mature or what they're meant to be. I'm not taking anything away from the Taddy Porter though. It's a good beer that happens to be in a style that I tend to not find as enjoyable as stouts. I'm sorry!"
"Overall, I couldn't believe what this was when it was unveiled. I had a good experience with this beer a year before. This was a disaster. Hopefully it was just a bad bottle at the blind tasting, but at the price I'm not too eager to buy it again. Very, very disappointing for all five of us."
"D- This beer was a perfect example of the style. Low ABV does make this one very drinkable and I did drink a lot of it. Flavorful but not filling. Sam Smith does make excellent examples of the style and everyone should seek out this widely available brewery."
"Very very drinkable, this one deserves the hype. Glad this came to my area as I've heard about it for so long. Definitely try it if given the opportunity."
" Overall, This was great. I really enjoyed the roasted flavor and the full on malt assault. This could have been one of my more favorite brews to date. Really a top noth offering and I would be thrilled to get some more!"
"Color is pitch black, but with a tinge of burgundy around the edges when held up to light. About a finger's width of a tan head that fades fairly quickly. Not much lacing left on the glass either. Coffee scents are nice but a bit weak. It's the taste where this beer stands out. Starts malty with hints of cocoa and caramel, and finishes with a touch of bitterness, with a wonderful fig aftertaste. Nice mouthfeel as well.Looking forward to another one."
"For all that, it's a drinkable beer - inoffensive, easy to drink, looks quite nice on the way down."
"This beer is extremely drinkable and at 5% it will take quite a few before you're drunk. The great taste makes it easy to consume. Very delicious beer, it's a pleasure to be able to try this one."
"This was a good porter, nice balanced flavor, not easy to drink more than 1 or 2 of these."
"Not my favorite Samuel Smith, but so, so good."
"Conclusion: As is everything else I have tried from this brewery, this beer is wonderful. As English as it can be, it is subtle, satisfying, and so smooth it is unreal. A great example of a traditional British porter."
"D- This is probably the most drinkable porter that I have ever had."
"Flavor is a great roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and a bit milky. This was an extremely light mouth feel, which is amazing with a beer of this flavor. You can drink a lot this before you know it. A fantastic beer that lives right up to it's reputation. Drink this,"
"From notes at Old Chicago (2002): Poured from bottle into english pint. Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with light brown head that lingers. Aroma of dark fruits, plum, fig, roasted malt, slight coffee / licorice type aroma. Taste is roast and barley, with dark fruits, and some candied apple. I feel like it is hard to characterize this one with normal beer vocabulary. It's an excellent porter, which distinguishes itself from others with a unique, rich, and complex aroma / flavor. Smooth, slightly silky mouth feel."
"D - Pleasant plum notes and easy drinking but with a slightly unpleasant phenolic astringency and a little watery as well (3.5)"
"D: Good. A couple pints would be fine."
"I have begun to really grow a taste for porters and while this isn't my favorite, I must say it is pretty good. Easily worth a try."
"Overall this is one excellent porter, I would buy the crap out of this if it was more reasonably priced. But this is a nice cold weather beer that I could drink many of."
"Super dark ultra clear cola with a dark and plentiful head. Lots of lace all the way down. Smell is roasty and full of coffee and cocoa. Some dark bread and molasses and a bit of dark fruits. Some floral hops. Taste is a continuation of the nose with nice hop finish that leaves coffee dripping from the roof of my mouth and a leafy hop dry bitterness. Feel is silky like the Oatmeal stout but lighter. A quintessential session porter."
"The foam was a dark wheat in color, 2 finger depth, smooth and lacey. The color was a very dark cola with hints of amber in the light. The taste was deep and bobust, roasted malt a barley undertone and a crisp hops highlight. Mouthfeel - crisp, smooth, clean, full/heavy bodied but not too heavy. Drinkability - smooth and was alot crispier and a light feel than expected by the color. Nice session."
" I could go on and on about this beer (which i have to being short of 250 characters) Like the Bros say -- World Class."
"I like porters and this is a really good one. I would say the high marks are well deserved and that I would definitely recommend it."
"a solid classic brew that everybody should drink every now and then, not my favorite from this brewer but a great porter nonetheless"
"medium body, easy to drink. classic english porter."
"D: This is fantastic and incredibly quaffable and I found myself nearly gulping it at times."
"Smells a little bit corn-meally which i did not anticipate. The nutty malts dont taste stale though. Honestly a little of a let down after the first sip, starting to think i should have poured it colder. Very dry, almost harsh finish. Unique, but not special"
"This is a great find. I picked the Samuel Smith Oatmeal out and my girlfriend convinced me to try this, and I am ecstatic. Great bitter quality but with a smooth malty finish."
"Drinkability of this beer is very good. I can have this one any place and at any time of the day. This classic porter is a definite 'must- have' for every porter lover. Highly, highly recommended."
"Thank you, reviewers, for guiding me to this world-class beer!"
"A great brew. It's been years since I've had this until now, and lately when I've needed a porter I've reached for Ithaca Gorges, but I was feelin' this (thank you wegmans in penfield for having the craft your own pack section). It's just what you want a porter to be. I feel like everyone has said what needs to be said about it, just throwing in my two cents. One of Sammy Smith's best, and a quintessential porter."
"Drinkability: This is my session beer (well"" American session beer"" anyway). This is the standard for porter. Deserved of the moniker ""The Famous."""
"550 ml bottle. Pours dark brown with a long lasting, foamy, tanned head and much lacing. Aroma is of bready malt and herbal hops. Medium, smooth body. Taste is sweet toasted malt in the beginning followed by dark chocolate, some dry fruit and some acidity. Long coffee finish. This brew tastes more like American Brown."
"D: a delicious, middle of the road dark beer. The 5% ABV is a pleasant change of pace from the flood of Imperial dark beers that have overtaken the marketplace."
"D- Very well balanced and flavorful. Very easy to drink."
"Pours jet black with a nice tan head. In the aroma, sweet roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee notes. In the taste, sweet roasted malt and chocolate and coffee hints, a bit watery though. A small bite and medium to light bodied mouthfeel, with a semi dry roasted malt in the aftertaste. Nice roast, but a bit thin, although still good for and English Porter."
"Zillion reviews for this beer. What else can I say? It's truly an exceptional brew. Magnificent lacing throughout the session. Very well balanced roasted malts, chocolate. The epitome of an English Porter, at least in my limited experience. Does Sam Smith make a bad beer?"
"The taste starts with roasted malt, hints of coffee, mingled with some fruit like dried plum or prune. This sweetness of course is kept in check with a very balanced bitterness of mild hops and dark chocolate. Very smooth and creamy like all beers from this great brewery. Very , very drinkable!! This brewery has become my favorite, every beer you pick up from them tastes great."
"Drinkability - This is a very, very good Porter. I don't think I like this as well as the Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout, but this is still way, way above average and worth a taste if at all possible. I am definitely looking forward to picking this up again. It is so easily drinkable it would be hard not to like it. Haven't had a Samuel Smith's yet that I didn't like."
"This beer has a little bit more carbonation than I really prefer but is a solid porter that is very drinkable."
"D/M: incredibly smooth drinking brew aided by the sweetness, nice carbonation tingle, nice smooth finish and slight lingering maltiness"
"D: Easy drinker. Nothing spectacular about this one, there are way better porters out there."
"Pours a dark, muddy brown color with great cap of khaki brown head, great retention and lacing. Scent is earthy, notes of bakers chocolate, pumpernickle bread, dark roasted nuts, day old coffee. Taste is wonderfully smooth and combines the components of scent into a very good beer. Fuller side of medium bodied, a touch over carbonated. Ingredients are plain and simple, no flavors stand out but a good beer all around that shows craftsmanship is important."
"Opened a bottle of Taddys Porter on a cold, dry evening after a big dinner. This porter presents as well as any bottled beer I've experienced. An easy two inch, full tan/cream colored head formed after pouring into the glass and persisted for a few minutes. The aroma was fleeting, with wafts of toffee and caramel. Great, full bodied flavor I expect from a porter and makes for an easy drink as the robust flavor quickly leaves the senses, making the drinker wanting sip after sip. A creamy thick mouthfeel rounds out this porter as one of my favorite to date. Try one!"
"Hard to rate this one, I just wanted to drink it. Wonderful pour resulting in a rich brown head of three inches. Took better than three minutes for the head to clam down, when it did it left an amazing lace the clings all the way up the rim. The color is a 39 on the SRM beer color chart. Great aroma of chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, and molasses. Flavors of chocolate, coffee, toffee, licorice, caramel, molasses, butter, and spice rum. Lots of body in my mouth, like heavy cream, smooth and rich. This is a great beer, it has become one of my favorites. I little pricey, but worth it."
"Overall, this is the best porter that I've had so far, but that's a relatively small list at this point. This makes me look forward to the next porter that I can get my hands on."
"D- Excellent drinkability. This is the porter to which I judge all others. It is what I think of as the benchmark for the style. Excellent flavor and body."
"One of my all time favorites. You can't go wrong with Taddy Porter anytime of day or night. The standard for an English porter in my opinion."
"Drinkability: Drinkable, not a session beer but drinkable. Might be a good beer to just have by itself at a pub with friends instead of with food."
"Verdict: Delicious and worth always having around."
"Overall, I'm a little underwhelmed by this ""world famous"" porter. Good start with great looks and solid porter aromas. I feel this porter is weakened by the added metal characteristics from the well water used in brewing. I didn't hate it, but it definitely put me off a bit."
"Wish I bought more than one of these. Will be drinking it more in the future."
"A really enjoyable porter with enough character to stand out. The Taddy Porter manages to offer a great interesting taste without being overly-complicated. There is a nice down to earth feel about this porter. Definitely something I will come back to, and probably my new standard for porters."
"This mouthfeel as well as flavor gives this porter an unusual drinkability for its style."
"Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter has a very dark red colour. It has a good head initially and maintains decent lacing. The smell is of roasty malt and coffee. This beer has a very malty flavour with a little hops in there for balance. It has a delicious malty aftertaste. This beer has a foamy 'big' feel to it and is extremely drinkable."
"Body is medium, with high drinkability. Complexity is minimal, but it's a pretty great porter. A little thinner than I think I remembered, but one of the better English breweries at it again. Seek it out (I'm shocked never to have reviewed Taddy - it was a go-to when I didn't have access to a great fridge)."
"D: slosh em down!"
"drinkability; pretty smooth and easy to drink. Could be a little less heavy in the stomach though."
"Drinkability: Certainly one of the best porters in the business. Easy to drink and a great representative of the style."
"Pours a very dark brown with a bit of an off white head. Not much lacing to be found. Nose is overloaded with toffee and has some roasted malt, coffee, and light chocolate in the background. The taste really brings the toffee and caramel forward without regard to the better roasted characteristics that are in the background. Medium body with good carbonation. Not the best balance of flavors."
"All in all, I'm pretty impressed with this beer, as I am with most of Sammy Smith's beers. Another beer that exudes quality from a brewery that has been solid since the olden days. Drinkability is high on this bad boy. Getchu some if ya see it around."
"D- review the above statements. wonderful beer."
"Drink well my friends"
"Wonderful mouthfeel, balanced flavors, and very easy-drinking."
"Notes: This is an exceptional brew. Sheer ecstasy for the palate."
"The finish is a touch short and sweet, along with some mild lingering roast. Besides that, the beer is perfect in terms of mouthfeel. Creamy with perfect mild carbonation, the medium body feels great and keeps me wanting more. This was a great pairing with a lobster bisque and Samuel really enjoyed sharing his affinity for this beer. The young man will be leading the company soon, and he's ready to embrace their heritage starting with his love for Taddy Porter."
"Drinkability- Tastes much more complex as it warms to room temperature. Smooth with a hearty flavor. A nice porter that will be an excellent three season beer."
"Very drinkable, though - let's not forget that the milder something is the more one can just chug it down."
"This is session, potent flavor without potent ABV. I wish Guinness tasted like this."
"D-This is about as sessionable as a porter can be. This is quite good, and one of my favorite Samuel Smith's beers."
"Purchased a bottle last night for $3.50 at the local store. Served at dinner during the cheese course, where it was was paired with an Irish cheddar made with porter. Poured into stemmed glasses. Dark brown color. Nice white head with good lacing. The nose was a nice combination of chocolate and milky coffee. Taste was excellent. Really rich malt flavor up front, with a bittersweet chocolate flavor on the palate. Mouthfeel was also memorable, as it had a sturdy body to it, but was smooth and the abv was low enough to not be a factor. A very drinkable beer overall. This porter may not be the most flavorful beer I have ever tried, but it really seems to be one of the most authentic versions of a porter on the market. The word ""famous"" is used in the title for a reason and it's well deserved."
"Really enjoyed this one, will be keeping a few as my stock porter."
"Poured from bottle into Ikea beer mug. Incredibly opaque brown color with a light-brown head. It even looks delicious. Hint of a creamy type of chocolate on the nose. Starts with a hint of bitterness which is quickly replaced by a lucious, creamy coffee/chocolate taste. Very flavorful. Silky on the mouth, and leaves a nice oily coat feel. I love the drinkability of this beer. A great porter that I will definitely return to."
"I must say that this is one of the best porter I have had."
"Drinkability: A nice and rich porter that is layered nicely. Good for the style. This did not blow me away like I have been by other Samuel Smith offerings. Could have a couple but would buy others first."
"Another perfect beer from Samuel Smith!! if you are looking for a english brown with more body, texture, and ABV. this is it."
"D - a solid beer and good example of porters and stouts in general. Would get this anytime"
"D- An awesome porter; one of my favorites to-date."
"This beer is exceptional. I absolutely love it. Looks good. Tan appearance. Smells good. Taste kinda creamy, but in a very good way. The mouthful is exceptional and the drinkabilty is great. With one taste, this beer will have you coming back for more and more. The only hinderance I see in this beer and others made by this company is its price. $4.49 for a bottle. A bit pricey, but otherwise worth its value"
"I found this a more enjoyable brew than Samuel Smiths Oatmeal Stout. Will definitely be comparing and contrasting this to some future Porters."
"D - I could drink these all day, even on a 90 degree day. Flavorful and extremely drinkable. The classic modern brown porter lives up to the hype. For anyone confused over the difference between a stout and a porter I suggest you take a sip of the Tadcaster."
"drinkability: easy drinker if you like English porters."
"all in all, a good execution. Like most sam smiths, I think they are steeped in tradition and it comes through...good beer, just nothing to make me go wow."
"I'm guessing I'm just not a fan of the ""style," but compared to Sam Smiths Oatmeal Stout this is just way off. Flavor and aroma are minimal- rather fruity with some 'porter-y' malts but overall a strange salty, apple-y taste. How many nouns can I adjectify by adding an additional syllable? About as many as there are ""porters"" superiour (note the U) to this one. If it were cheaper it might make a decent session."
"This is a very good porter, not as sweet as I expected but still balanced and smooth. Pours a very dark brown with a nice creamy head, very little carbonation. Has a nice coffee, chocolate malt aroma, flavors aren't too bitter for my taste. As with many porters I've found the aroma and taste improves as it warms up a bit, you don't get it when it's too cold. This is very ""drinkable", it has a modest ABV and doesn't seem too filling, a couple pints are nice!"
"d- given i didn't have a bottle where the carbonation was off, i think the drinkability here would be great. it's a tasty beer, just wish it wasn't as flat as ten day old stale coke. off to buy a fresh bottle.."
"Drinkability: Excellent Brown Porter that shows how good a beer can be while still being low in alcohol and fairly restrained."
"Definitely a great porter. What I like is that it doesn't punch you in the mouth with roasted malts...and that it's so smooth. I'm a fan."
"Poured a near black with an ruby outline when held to the light. Nice two finger tan head that stuck around. Nose was appetizing with a strong roasted character with subtle chocolate and cherry notes. Palate is a dry, sweet and roasted melody. Quite delicious. Not as sweet as the alot of porters and I love it. Mouthfeel is a bit more fluid than I'd expect but still has a good presence. Awesome porter that is nearly flawless."
"It poured a VERY black substance with just a hint of brown showing at the edges of my perfect pour glass with significant carbonation making two fingers of tan head. The aroma had definite caramel and some cocoa with maybe a tad of liquorish. Taste wise it seemed just a smidgen sour, or maybe just a bit dry. It finished with a sweetness I wish was more present in the flavor. It's nice, but I know several porters that appeal to me better."
"This beer makes me want to go in the woods, build a fire, cook a nice meal, and sit and eat and drink. I really like this one."
"a very straightforward beer. a quality of earth molasses mostly with a finish of grape. palate is earthy bitter molasses toasty with a finish of fig and grape. very mild sweet sheltered in earth. a lingering mild quality of vanilla like in wine. very soft but not as defined as in a good foreign export. great beer with a nice smokey quality at times... some bitterness that works that way... sometimes smokey... sometimes bitter chocolate... sometimes tobacco. great if you get all three in a good bottle. but respectfully mild."
"D= if you like the first whiff or the first sip you'll want to drink it in quantities."
"This is a greatly drinkable brew. Lots of stuff going on, yet not overwhelming in any sense."
"Poured from a 12oz. bottle (no freshness date) into a Sam Adams perfect pint. Pours a deep, dark brown color with a big fluffy light brown head that doesn't want to drop down into the glass. There is also lots of carbonation with this one. Lots of roasted malts in the smell. Very roasty taste too, dark chocolate with some dark roasted coffee beans. Very nice creamy mouthfeel that starts off chewy and finishes with a crisp bitterness from the roasted malts. A very lovely porter that is wonderful to drink."
"Drinkability: This is an excellent porter and one that I would strongly recommend to any beer drinker. Possibly the best porter I've had- I could drink this every day."
"An excellent porter. It pours black into the glass with a good roasted malt aroma with faint hops. The taste is smooth and velvety. Based on Alton Brown's recent Good Eats episode on porterhouse steaks, I figured I try out the pairing--it worked perfectly. The mouthfeel is also impressive: the fine bubbles and foam taste like nitro. And, while porters can be on the heavy side, this was exceptionally drinkable (the 5% ABV helps)."
"This is an excellent, delicious porter."
"this is a beer to judge other beers by!"
"Flavor is one of the best of the brown porter style. Fruits, cocoa, little bit of roasty bitterness. Finishes closer to dry than I expected, and with the creamy body and soft carbonation and balance everywhere it is nearly the epitome of the style and ridiculously drinkable."
"The body is light to medium, and very easy to drink. The finish is creamy, and the finish lingers, filled with coffee and cocoa. Drinkability is insanely good. The texture and the consistency lend themselves to an easy drinking porter that certainly lives up to my high expectations. Sam Smith backs up its talk with a great brew."
"Its been a while since I've had an English Porter...Very good!"
"Pours to a clear very dark brown -ruby black color and thick tan head. Aroma is caramel malts, coffee, chocolate, brown sugar and maple. Flavor is roasty malt, coffee, sweet malt and some balancing hop resin bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is on the low side. Overall, an exceptionally well made and technically accurate Porter as you would expect."
"Dark brown opaque body, 1 finger light tan head with a bit of uneven rockiness. The nose is chocolate balanced by oak notes, the chocolate becomes more pronounced as it warms up. The taste is pretty complex, a bit of coffee, hints of chocolate with good oak character, very well balanced. Mouthfeel is fairly full not too sticky with good effervescence. Drinkability is very high, this is one smooth beer. While perhaps not as robust as other American Porters, this is one damn fine beer."
"I do think strongly flavoured food will drown out a lot of the flavor of this beer (as I experienced) as perhaps the flavor is a bit subtle, but that's hardly a bad thing; and is to be expected for the style and alcohol content. Make sure you let it warm for a bit before drinking."
"a nice beer overall"
"D- Very high, it's extremely enjoyable and worthy of the praise it gets."
"Sam Smith does it again. Every thing they offer is just about my favorite example of the style. This is history in a glass."
"Drinkability is pretty good. Its easy drinking and fairly flavorful making it a good choice for a session porter. Its a nice example of the style and I would certainly have it again."
"D-- It is 5% so being a bit thin is understandable, yet well hidden Highly drinkable and a great pairing with a chocolate cake or a big rich stew. Could also be a great night cap beer if you want one good beer. Lacks the warming sensation from a higher ABV but in a lot of ways this is a perfect beer to pair with food. Best part is can have 2 and not get tired of it. It is not perfect but it hides its imperfections very well."
"D: This is an excellent porter. A textbook example for a reason. It manages a diverse, deep flavor alongside an extremely sessionable body. Not such a hyped style, but anyone could enjoy this."
"I poured into a pint glass to an inch and a half of tan head. It is dark brown in color. The smell is baker's cocoa and some roasted malt. The taste is milk chocolate and some black roasted coffee to finish. This is a really nice tasting beer. The mouthfeel could be more viscous, but then again, I like chewing my beer. Overall, this is an excellent beer. I can see why it's famous."
"O: High drinkability. Delicious Porter. Highly recommended"
"M: Light bodied and leaves the pallet clean"
"A really dark chestnut brown with ruby highlights under about three inches of light tan head that quickly faded to a thin covering. Lots of sweet chocolate in the nose. Then there are some pretty subtle coffee and cherry scents. Chocolate is the main flavor as well, along with some dried fruit (figs, dates.) There's also coffee as well as the slightest hint of smokiness. Right as you swallow there is a touch of sour that hits all the way to the back of the throat. This is a porter that I'd actually enjoy sessioning."
"D: This beer is extremely easy to drink and is very sessionable."
"It retains its complexity but doesn't push into sensory extremes. The quintessential porter."
"Overall, not a bad porter, but I prefer a slightly more robust flavor and body."
"Strong flavor in this beer, with toasted malt, caramel, coffee and a little bit of chocolate that balances it well. Not the slightest bit of sweetness, but there is some bitterness in the aftertaste - similar to coffee. Full bodied and very heavy in the mouth - not for a warm day - but overall a really enjoyable drink."
"Samuel Smith's Famouns Taddy Porter is pretty good. Solid beer overall."
"Beer is medium in body, some roast comes up at the end, almost as an after taste, the bitterness lingers, not much carbonation on the palate. Overall the flavors are a little weak. I think its a good beer, a drinkable beer, but I'm generally bored."
"Notes: A good example of an English Porter. This brew is a bit more astringent/sour than other dark beers, so if you don't like astringency in a beer, than this might not be the brew for you. Personally though, I love it."
"Semi-sweet chocolate chips and strawberries coated with old-school eraser dust are the main flavors I am getting. A twinge of tartness here and a hint of sourness over there give it a pretty authentic British Porter feel. Very smooth and velvety mouthfeel, it keeps you wanting another sip each and every time. There is enough roasty malt to give a mild coffee flavor to the beer. Sweetness is kept pretty low on the beer and has a pretty dry finish that whispers 'yea, there are some hops in here'. At first sniff I did not think I would like this beer, but the sum of the parts is greater than...ugh...something or other - just drink the damn beer, it's pretty freaking tasty!"
"Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter is as good as other Samuel Smith beers I've had. It is a relatively dark beer. The smell might be the best part about this beer. The smell is very rich and somewhat roasted. The flavor isn't overbearing in this beer, but it is good. There is just a slight aftertaste. I really enjoyed this beer, as is the case with most Samuel Smith beers."
"Mouthfeel is light, quite drinkable. Nice beer."
"F: Semi bitter on the finish with the roasty bitterness. Dries off a little, but it's not too sweet on the finish either. It's more creamy too, with lingering lactose finish. Some of the roasty coffee bean flavor also sticks around on the finish adding to the bitterness. I get a hint of raisin and brown sugar as well late on the finish. The bitterness seems to get a little overwhelming for what it should be at least, or perhaps I'm too in love with how luscious and creamy the oatmeal stout is."
"D- Its a nice beer. Not much of a porter fan, but its a good solid beer for drinking on a beautiful evening. Its real easy to drink as well"
"quite enjoyable and very, very drinkable. definitely in the top three for the style imo. if you've ever wanted to know what a porter should taste like, this would be a good place to start."
"Not a bad beer but not one of my favorites. I prefer stronger tasting porters but if your not a big dark beer drinker this is a good option to ease into it."
"D - Approaching the Stout style to me, because of it's rich flavor profile, simple but well made, and I love the prices of Samuel Smith's brews. Just a solid example in my opinion, nothing outstanding, but extremely delicious. Worth trying, and I'd buy it again for sure. Cheers!"
"This beer pours out a thick black leaving a small tan head that quickly dissipates. The main smell is of roasted malt with almost a faint sweetness as the main smell fades. This beer has a strong roasted malt flavor, but with surprisingly little bitterness leaving you with an almost creamy aftertaste. The mouthfeel is smooth and full. While this beer is thick, it doesn't feel too heavy. This could definitely be a session beer for me."
"Overall - Samuel Smiths are truly the masters of dark English style ales."
"Drinkability - 5.0/5.0 - A great beer, definitely one that can go down quick and smooth. At 5% ABV, wouldn't get you in trouble either."
"D. I think I'll have another. Enough said. A true ""go to"" for this style."
"D-this is quite good and only improves as it warms. The smokiness mellows and the sweetness enhances. Smooth and velvety on tha palate, definitely a tasty brew."
"Pours a deep dark brown color with a creamy tan head. Sweet malty aroma with some chocolate and light smoke. Flavor is chocolate, roasted malt, and licorice. Medium-thin body with a smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable, another great beer from Samuel Smith!"
"Pours a clear and light brown color with a light and lacy tan head. A light sweet malt aroma is pushed out of the glass by the visible mild carbonation levels. The drink is light and flows well with the toffee malt flavor. Smooth and refreshing to drink it is well balanced and finishes quick and clean. Great example of an English style and great for the warmer parts of spring and fall."
"Verdict: Taddy is an easy and straightforward Porter that's great for when you're looking for something that is easy to drink without being boring. Sure, you could argue the intensity could stand to be notched up, but this stands well as it is."
"Great beer. At 5%, it's hard not to say, ""I'll have another"" more times than one should or could..."
"Notes: Very nice porter with balanced and nice flavors. Not too bitter and not too sweet. Smooth and nice body, but I would like it to be a bit fuller."
"Taste is oil, alcohol, brown ale and water. No hop quality. Like a mead from England. Mouthfeel is like a walnut mixed in with the aforementioned taste. Drinkability is lame, as its about $5 per 500 ml, and its just not enjoyable. Not my thing."
"D: superior drinkability, I could session these or I could have one and done. This is a fine example of a porter this is done right. oh so good."
"D - higher than the sum of its parts. This could easily be the soul beer you have all evening. Would be great during a card game."
"Overall - It's a pretty good beer"
"D: With all the hype behind this, I am very disappointed. Glad I only bought a single."
"All in all a solid, workaday porter, and one that I like a lot."
"D:This is a very drinkable porter i would buy it agian for sure."
"I cannot believe I have never reviewed this beer before. This is one of the first beers that got me in to craft brewing. I poured this in to a standard English pint glass. Color is chestnut brown, with a tall white head to cap things off. Deep chocolate and dark fruit dominate the smell, with some charcoal thrown in to the mix as well. Taste is full of chocolate, and more dark fruit, It also gets a bit metallic at times, which strangely enough really works for this beer. Mouthfeel is silky smooth, and drinks as easily as any beer I have ever come across. This beer reminds me of why I first fell in love with traditional English Porters. I think sometimes English Ales get a bad rap for being too mild, but this brew proves that notion wrong. Indeed, this beer could stand up to any American Porter or Baltic Porter easily. Cheers"
"Cheers!"
"Cheers."
"Malt sweetness up front, dates and prunes. The savoury middle reminds me of crispy roast potatos with gravy. Medium full body, medium low carbonation, scary high drinkability. Halfway through this review, I've poured another just to check.. Yep. It's good."
"Overall a great porter and one that had been overlooked too long. I'm glad I gave it a try."
"Overall- One of the most unique tasting beers I have reviewed to date. It is definitly something that you really have to try for yourself to fully appreciate."
"D: Very drinkable, I think it would suprise people who feel Porters and Stouts are too bold and heavy. I really enjoyed this one and I'll certainly be seeking it out again to share with friends."
"D: Not my style, but as with all Sam Smith brews, it's of the best I've had of the style. It's surprisingly big for 5%, but an easy session beer."
"D: While Fuller's is the star of this style for me, Sam Smith's version is excellent and much more widely available, I can get this anytime at the corner liquor store whenever I want a good and tasty traditional English ale."
"Poured black with some deep ruby in the light, 2 finger fluffy cream tan head. Looks delicious. I didnt let this brew warm up enough maybe as i wasnt getting nearly anything for aroma other than a faint coffee. Tasted some faint bitter chocolate and malt but the coffee was what really stood out to me with this guy. This was very sweet i thought, balanced and some dark fruit. It was alot lighter than i guess i figured it would be which is usually the case, i could drink motor oil sludge and still think its too light haha. Very drinkable/tastey straight forward porter though and if i was a coffee drinker which im not, id much rather have one of these in the morning with breakfast for sure, and with only a good 5% ABV it certainly wouldnt be a problem."
"After my initial review, I started eating something salty while drinking this. It seemed to really enhance the flavors of both. Reminded me of a beer you would drinking in a cabin or lodge on a cold winter night."
"Great Beer, Buy it!!!"
"The Taddy Porter pours a deep ebony color with a tan creamy head that sits atop. The nose is sweet malts up front with a coffee finish. Smell is not overpowering but solid. The palate is extremely smooth with toffee, coffee, and a bitter maltiness that rounds out the quaff. The flavor profile differs in bitterness/sweetness with every sip. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with little carbonation. This is a very drinkable porter in my opinion. The alcohol content is not too much while the taste is a great sample of this style."
"I'm going to look into picking up some of this stuff in the future and investigating this style more thoroughly."
"D- Goes down super smooth, and packed with fantastic aroma and flavor for such a low ABV beer. The only thing that keep this from being a regular session beer in my fridge is the price!"
"Another outstanding Samuel Smith beer!"
"Drinkability: I think now that I've had this standard of a English porter I prefer American porters, but, this one goes perfectly with a meal and I could easily see myself having another one if it was available. But I don't see this as an all the time great beer, for me it's a nice treat with a hearty meal. I will say though that I've learned from this beer that it has to warm all the way up to really properly enjoy it. No wonder the Brits like their beer warm, at least this one is best that way."
"This is a great beer and I am just mad that I haven't sampled it before now."
"A classic! The quintessential, real Porter."
"If you want to drink a porter, get a Sam Smith Famous Taddy. Wow."
"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
"D: This beer is not too strong in flavor or odor, but it has a good complex flavor that is easy to drink and very enjoyable."
"D: simple good porter, so simple to drink"
"Overall, a classic, tasty porter that is easily sesssionable. A classic example of the style."
"A pleasantly silky, supple, and tasty winter sipper - let it sit first for a spell if it is straight out of the fridge, though - the flavours seem to open up even more as it warms. Another paragon for the style in question from this brewer - they hit all the right buttons for their homeland's native brews, this much is certain."
"Code: SF2311 of unknown meaning."
"Note- Aftertaste is coffee-like, but not the unpleasant taste from after drinking actual coffee. Similar to cocoa coated coffee beans."
"T- It's very tart, very dry. The port-wine taste is slight. No hopes that I can tell. Quality, but not my style."
"If you like porters, this is a must try."
"I dare say this porter might be over carbonated, I'm into a heavier porter really. Certainly drinkable, though."
"CHEERS!"
"Overall - A delicious porter that is definitely worth giving a shot if you see this one around."
"Fabulously creamy though, and quite drinkable at 5%."
"D - light with a nice flavor profile. decent representation of one of my least favorite styles."
"Notes: Now I know what all of the fuss is about. This is a good porter."
"I could seriously drink this beer all night long, it is that good. Probably the best porter I've had so far...it puts a lot of others to shame."
"Pours an opaque black-brown color with a tan/cream colored head leaving medium lacing on the glass. Aroma is yeast, roasted malt, and chocolate with a hint of alcohol. Very pleasant. Taste begins with a nice mellow roasted malt, sweet, and then a bit tangy in the middle with a dark chocolate finish. Body is medium and smooth. Overall, another solid offering from Samuel Smith's of which I could easily have several."
"D: I could sit at a pub and drink this all night long, quintessential english session beer"
"D: Highly drinkable and enjoyable. This is comparable to their oatmeal stout with the same body but with more of a chocolatiness that I prefer."
"All in all, a bit one-sided. Consistent, though, and pretty damn good."
"Overall, this one of the finest porters I've ever had, second only perhaps to New Glarus' Olde English."
"D - A great drinking modern English porter. Sessionable to be sure."
"Poured from the gold foil topped bottle to my favorite snifter. Black appearance with a nice two finger tan head. Malty toasty smell and coffee roasted flavor. I liked reading a previous poster say campfire which is the word I was looking for. In a good way. Mouthfeel was medium. Light carbonation. Dangerously easy drinking."
"Drinkability is hard to fault. Like many english beers I could put away far too many of these without really worrying about it."
"Carbonation is quite prickly, something I don't like in porters and stouts."
"Decent beer despite my first bottle being ruined. It is very drinkable and quite enjoyable. After I drank about half the bottle I finished the rest while eating some good ham, I found the combo quite delicious."
"So easy to drink... I sought a hearty porter, and while this wasn't it, Taddy Porter was a great beer."
"Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very balanced flavors with no overpowering aftertaste. Could have one after another."
"Mostly opaque, but clear dark brown color with rub highlights with a thick, creamy light tan head that has little retention or lacing. Aroma is sweet and creamy, prominently features milk chocolate, cocoa, roast malt notes but overall mild. Medium bodied with smooth, light carbonation and a slightly bitter, cloying aftertaste that ends quickly and is slightly watery. Flavor is pleasant, balance of chocolate/malt sweetness and mild dark fruit bitterness, but overall the slightly thin mouthfeel and short finish detracts from the fullness of the flavor. I don't know, I hoped for more from this, not a bad porter but not exceptional like anticipated."
"a very heady beer, just like that oatmeal stout I just had. the head is a great colour, like a beige or desert tan, maybe a light chocolate milk colour. it is incredibly creamy and delicious. the body is a deep ruby brown, and lets light barely through the middle. the nose is fine for a porter, could have more coffee and malts, and could be stronger. the taste, however, is exceptional. deep dark roasted malts, traces of coffee and caramel, a touch of what I would call booze, something slightly sharp, and a miniscule tinge of sour. the feel is quite thin, even with the big carbonation. but this, however, coupled with the taste makes the brew incredibly drinkable and a great session beer."
"A good beer but why do I always feel let down by porters? It's probably that I just don't understand them properly I suppose."
"This clean and easy drinking beer was the perfect thing for my heartburn the other night. This was an old time go to before I was even really into craft beer and it had been way too long since I tried it. I remember drinking this out of the bottle in a brown bag while walking around San Francisco when I was 21 and loving it. Now that I know enough to give this inconic brew proper respect I enjoy it even more."
"A good brew, for sure. I wish Sam Smith was available in 6 packs. Also, at the risk of sounding like a broken record, if you liked this, try the Imperial Stout (or vice versa). Freakin' nice!!"
"Poured from a 550 ml bottle to my favorite old Bass dimpled made in England mug.Poured a dark brown with a thick foamy taupe head and good lacing.Light aroma of chocolate and coffee nothing too strong though.Taste is wonderful mostly of bitter chocolate with some coffee. Feels smooth and clean with a slight bitter finish. Drinkability is fantastic I could drink this all night without a problem. Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter was the first porter I ever tried and I am finding it hard to beat."
"The overall sensation this beer gives off reminds me of SS's oatmeal stout - you can definitely tell the two beers are siblings."
"550 mL bottle poured into a pint glass. Thick, dark, and creamy with a solid inch of tan head. The smell mostly reminds me of semisweet dark chocolate. The flavor has a bit of the dark chocolate as well but is hindered by a strong metallic aftertaste. Still, a pretty mellow and smooth beer with some other hints of vanilla and nuttiness. Mouthfeel is creamy, perfect for this style. Excellent drinkability for a stout."
"D: Well, this is absolutely drinkable by nearly everyone who likes beer. May very well be the best porter I have had to date..."
"D: Another great natural Samuel Smith. Great taste without adding chocolate or coffee... with Sam Smith they come naturally and in perfect balance."
"Could really enjoy a couple of these in a sitting but sadly had to move on."
"D- Very high on the drinkability scale! Delicious, practical, and for under 3 dollars a bomber, I'll be buying this again for sure!"
"Pours a dark brown color with a bubbly tanned head that receeds slowly leaving quite a bit of lacing on the glass. Smells of chocolate evident with a strangely similar aura about it just reminding me of other sammy smith products. Also picking up on some light malt sweetness in the nose as well. Taste is just as good. Chocolate immediately evident along the rich smoothness and ever so slightly bitter finish. Very clean, slightly lingering tastes of chocolate and burnt grains. Medium feel with low carb. Overall a solid product that is very enjoyable."
"D - Could definitely put down a few of these at a time. Kinda pissed that I only got one....for now"
"This beer didn't taste bad, it just didn't really taste like a porter to me - it tasted like every sam smith beer - faint alcohol and a few other faint flavors on the side. I am disappointed."
"All in all, I've reviewed this beer as I experienced it. From reading the other reviews, mine seems to differ a bit and I wonder if there wasn't some other variable at play. Maybe I'll give it another shot in the future, but for now, this is as I experienced it. All in all a fairly solid beer, but not really thrilled in the least."
"D- Seemed the more I drank of this one the more I wished it was a bottomless glass. Sam Smith got it right with this one."
"Overall, this beer way overcompensated for its faults with it's taste and mouth feel. I was immediately sad that I only had one of these lying around and will need to go get another one at some point."
"Drinkability: Like everything else that Samuel smith's produce, this is truly magnificent, a really classic porter, they way they are meant to be."
"M-A creamy, almost syrupy medium mouthfeel and at the very very end, it turns dry! So very nice."
"The mouth is extremely creamy and smooth. This is like silk going down. Very pleasant. Decent chocolate flavors mix with a subtle sweet creaminess that make this a very drinkable dark brew. Some roasted nuttiness finishes this one out. I really like this, and I could drink a few at a time. Well done."
"An absolutely delightful beer. Almost without question the best porter I've ever sampled. It now sets the bar for all others, although I'd be more than happy to just drink this one from now on."
"D - Much better at warmer temperatures. Very tasty."
"Drinkability: At 5%, there is no alcohol ""burn"" and the beer is so well balanced that I could have another. Sitting here, though, I am rather full and still have 1/4 of the beer remaining. For me, one is great enough."
"I'll drink more of this someday. It won't be my goto porter, but it will be considered when my Black Boss isn't available."
"Very drinkable for a porter. Absolutely delicious."
"Conclusion: Outstanding beer for the cool autumn and bitter cold winters in Chicago. The flavors are complex and obvious without being over the top. Highly recommend it to my friends."
"Drinkability is probably the least excellent point of this beer, only because it is like drinking a meal, it is a filling brew, and it isn't the beer to turn to for instant refreshment on a hot day (yes, I realize it is a porter) . Definitely a sipper for a cool evening in fall."
"All around just a great porter."
"It's not perfect, but it almost feels like it since it can be found almost everywhere."
"This beer pours a dark black cherry colour with some ruby highlights and leaves a nice frothy two finger cappicino laced head with decent lacing down the glass,it has aromas of woody,coffee laced cherries and a subtle coffee aroma in the background,it has an above average mouthfeel which starts off with a medium body yet finishes very light like water that fills the palette with tastes of blackberries and cherries laced in coffee liqueor,this is definately an excellent example of the style and because of the light finish drinkability is high."
"As usual, Sam Smith sets the bar. The standard for the style."
"Removing the wrap from the lid on one of Samuel Smith's Taddy Porters ensures a pleasant, classic night of roasted English dark ale. Tasty and robust with its slightly smoky, light nutty flavor, it's an easily irresistible porter out there that almost begs the drinker to swallow more."
"Good porter."
"Drinkability: it's a little thick to swill pint after pint of it, but a few of these in a long session would be quite nice."
"btw - I have found that the bigger bottles (fatty Taddy as they are known) is the way to go with this beer. Unlike some of the other Sam Smith products (i.e Winter Welcome and Nut Brown Ale etc) this one you don't want too cold, and the bigger bottle means it has more time to open up and come down to near room temperature. And of course you get more of the magical brew too."
"550ml bottle served in a standard pint glass. Poured the color of cola with ruby red highlights when backlit and a float-like, two inch, tan-colored head. Head eventually recedes into a solid quarter inch cap; no lacing on this one. Nose suggests chocolate malt, dark fruit, molasses and brown sugar. Taste consistent with nose, but flavors are considerably more subdued. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied with a mild, consistent background carbonation; a little too light-bodied and carbonated for my general liking. Easy drinking and flavorful - a nice session porter."
"Cheers"
"D - Extremely drinkable, this is my type of porter, I could tip down quite a few of these."
"This brew is very drinkable and a top example of the style - may be the best porter I have tried. Excellent."
"D - Very drinkable beer, with nothing to overwhelm the palate."
"Bloody good. I could drink several of these on a cold winters night. Be sure to let it warm to about 13 degrees, as it is nowhere near as nice when cold. A benchmark English porter."
"MF/D: Very very smooth, low carbonation, medium/thick body...a truly unique porter, very English."
"drinkability is good - this is so light you could drink this in the hot summer and want more"
"Taddy looks heavy, but is not; it is a mild bodied porter that provides for an elegant quaff before the manor's fireplace or a refreshing bracer following a fox hunt on the moor. So, here's to Catherine and Heathcliff. Who's your Taddy?"
"D - Very high thanks to the great taste, mouthfeel and low alcohol content. Would make a great session."
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown with a thick light tan head. Aroma of sweet malt, some vegetal notes, and bready malt. Flavor is predominantly bready malt and some roasted notes, but this really isn't like your typical porter. Weak palate. Meh, I'm not digging this."
"D: Very drinkable. A tip of the hat to the Beer Philosopher for pointing this one out. I love it!!"
"Drinkability: I'm not an expert on beers yet, but most of the darker beers I've drank are not something you can drink quickly , there slow sipping beers that demand appreciation. This does too however its very smooth and refreshing and easy to drink. Alcohol content is not very high, so it'd be easy to have a few if price wasn't an issue. Most sammy smiths brews are worth the $4 imho."
"A very solid porter - probably one of those that defined the style."
"Poured a perfect Imperial pint of 1pt. 2.7 fl oz. Tried this with Italian sausage and mustard, and it went very well with the red meat. English beers, I think, were meant to be drunk at room temperature not blasted cold in the fridge like yank beers."
"D: A great porter. I don't remember what it cost me, but if it's under $4 or so, it's a phenomenal value."
"Pitch black colored beer with a small slowly fading head,Aroma is coffee beans.Taste is chocolate,malts,cream and coffee.Creamy and smooth goes down very nicely.I think porter fans should try at least once.I know this is something I will buy again in the futrue."
"This is another great one from Sam Smith. It's pitch black with a good, creamy head. Chocolate, coffee, malty aroma. Taste and mouthfeel are both outstanding. Chocolate, molasses, malt comes through at the end, a little figgy, but finishes dry. Carbonation is excellent. I could definitely session this were I so inclined."
"tastes very smooth and thick, roasted barley, bittersweet chocolate, touch of coffee, and a little bit of nuts, ends dry and bitter."
"Drinkability - Extremely Drinkable. One of my favorite Porters. Would make a nice session beer."
"Pours black with a thick beige head that dies down to a thin line of bubbles. Chocolate, burnt malt, coffee aromas. It has a sweetness to the aroma. Roasted malt, dark chocolate, slight caramel flavors. The thing that I really like about this beer is that the carbonation kicks in and the mouthfeel becomes creamy and smooth just about the time the chocolate flavors kick and that really enhances the flavor. There is a very faint herbal/floral note to it."
"This is the way I like an English porter. Hurrah!"
"In general, I prefer American Porters like Edmund Fitz or SN to this. This reminds me/leans towards more of a Stout."
"500 ml bottle poured into a pint glass. Darkest brown in color with a creamy tan head. Aromas of licorice, smoked malt, and black coffee. Flavor is dark fruity with prune and grape, dark chocolate overtones, light smoke, and roasted malts. A little watery, easy to drink."
"D=very drinkable and quite enjoyable."
"I was intrigued to try this beer. I'm a big fan of stouts, and since the porter is really the father of the stout, I can easily see the comparisons in the roasted notes. Not as overpowering as the stouts I prefer drinking, but still a well balanced beer with a unique and enjoyable blend of flavors. Definitely outpaces all other porters I've tried to this point, albeit they were of the American variety (SA Honey Porter, Left Hand Blackjack Porter), not the ""proper"" English style."
"Notes: I've enjoyed this one for quite awhile, but this is the first time reviewing it. And well, it's not hard to tell why this is considered a classic. I love the way that huge roasted barley taste mixes with the rest of the flavors in this one. Quite tasty, but can't quite keep pace with some of the better porters out there nowadays."
"Samuel Smith's comes through again with a delicious and ridiculously drinkable beer! A must try for any porter fan."
"Overall: Really drinkable, good sweet and roasted flavors, no hops noticed at all, the alcohol flavor is present more so than most 5% ABV beers but luckily no alcohol burn. Great English porter!"
"Drinkability: Excellent session beer."
"A special treat. Pours a black lake pint with a cinnamon, off white thin head. Light lacing dabs the glass surrounding a light aroma of berries and bitter chocolate. The aroma is rather light, making it difficult to decipher notes. The taste is bangin...exactly what I expect from an English Porter. Refreshing roast, tangy zesty blueberry, with a hint of cinnamon. Crisp carbonation with a light body. One of the best sessions I have come across. Something magically historical lies within this pint. One to meditate upon."
"Overall - I really enjoyed this beer. It won't be part of my everyday rotation but mostly just for the import pricing. I will definitely have it again though."
"D- Not to impressed with the drinkability. Have had better porters. Could not get over the tartness. Would not buy again."
"Drinkability- So drinkable, probably the best session beer of the porter style I have had (at least right up there), great flavor great complexity, and so drinkable, one I will be visiting again much much more often, this was one of the first better beers I had tried way back when and I appreciate now even so much more then I did, just a great great beer,"
"Overall, pretty eh."
"D - Very easy-drinking and tasty. Could drink this all night and would go very well with some chocolate cake or mocha cheesecake."
"D- Session Porter?"
"D: This is a fantastic porter and I don't think Sammy Smiths can do any wrong. This porter is just amazingly sessionable. It has those really nice porter flavors but does not sit as heavy as some American porters. This beer shows that you can have that porter flavor and goodness without a huge ABV and over the top sweetness or hopping. This beer is meant to be sessioned and enjoyed and everyone should do just that. God stuff."
"Almost black in body with creamy cinnamon head that leaves lacing. A sweet aroma of chocolate cream, some hops, and sugar. A tranquil array of flavors are present but none seem to want to take the lead: slight roast, slight bitter chocolate notes, cola qualities, slight hops at the finish, some burnt grain. A cola like mouthfeel that is a little fizzy. Not quite my bag, baby but still a pretty good brew. For fans of English ales, this is one to look out for."
"550 ml bottle pours dark molasses brown into a pint sized pub glass, making a thick espresso like milky head that dissipates reluctantly, leaving snow-flake like lacing. Smell is sweet cedar mixed with Hershey's chocolate syrup. Taste is rich buttery pancakes and cocoa. Mouthfeel reinforces (or creates) pancake sensation. Bubbles exist only to remind you that you are drinking beer. Drinks smooth and wonderful."
"D = Highly drinkable porter. Low abv and pleasant taste make this the ideal session porter."
"Overall, this is an easy drinking beer with a lot of flavor. Very solid. The price is a tad high (not intended), but it was worth it."
"Morey's Bottom Line: I've moved away from dark beers over the past year, but I must say, this was a nice change of pace. Among the best porters that I've tried."
"Beer pours black with ruby undertones with a long lasting tan head. Nose upon opening was a blast of English hops with slight roasted coffee and dark fruit. Taste is supremely well balanced with roasted malts, a hint of sweetness from the underlying dark fruit, and a well stated English hop finish. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with above average smoothness. Drinkability is very good. This is a deliciious well balanced porter that is a must try of english porter style fans."
"Bold, smooth, full, but all in a nice package. If I was offered this over apres' meal coffee, this wins. Nice!"
"easy for this style. delicious and definately a genre spreader."
"D: Easy and pleasant to drink. Unlike many American takes on the style, this porter does not overwhelm the palate with the coffee/toffee malts. It's well balanced and was quite a welcome change of pace. An absolutely magnificent session porter!"
"Drinkability is decent, 2-3 and that would be about all i could handle for the night. Overall it is smooth, but a very heavy beer."
"Drinkability- For a porter, this one stands out as one I could drink all night."
"D - Probably my favorite beer so far. Could drink all week, month, year, and never get bored of it."
"Drinkability - Very good for such a dark porter. Could drink a whole 6-pack....if I didn't eat dinner."
"Taste is not in your face, its just a great balanced porter. Creamy coffee with some chocolate. Mouth is coated with sweetness, and just really creamy without being very heavy bodied. Drinkability is just about as good as it gets. I could sip on this all night. Great example of the porter style that should (and likley does) influence others who make porters."
"Low in alcohol, smooth on the palate, nicely dry, and with a wonderful balance of British modesty and full-on flavor, this makes for a great session beer and a delightful sipper. Porter is, sadly, a fairly rare style, having been taken over largely by its stout brethren, but it's great to see that some great, classic examples such as this one still plough on."
"My only complaint is that I only bought on bottle."
"One of the best porters I've tried. I could drink these all night."
"Pours a dark park brown/black colored body, with a tannish colored head, huge and lasting. Has a sweet coffee aroma, and some dark chocolate. A thin taste, coffee, and dark chocolate. A slight bitter coffee aftertaste. Light tasting."
"As the beer warms its character increases and becomes really good, I sure did enjoy this special treat."
"Great slick black appearance, slightly oil looking. Light brown colored head with some minor lacing on the sides. A burnt milk chocolate smell was nicely permeating from the drink. If only the taste was equal to the nice aroma: a little watery and light compared to a dense chocolate taste I was hoping. Mouthfeel, perhaps, is the main culprit in the odd taste with its light, watery texture with no real creamy aspect. The carbonation is also a bit off for my palate. Nevertheless, the mouthfeel allows it to be light enough not too much of a brick in the stomach. Overall, surprisingly imbalanced."
"D - Easy drinking with good balance, fine as a cool weather beer or accompaniment to a meal."
"*note: i did have a 90 Minute IPA before this so I will def review this again when my mouth is clear."
"Now, I'd just like to state that the criteria for the beer (appearance, smell, drinkability, etc.) all matches up quite well. It is an all around good balanced beer. I just don't think it is worthy of an A rating in comparison to some other porters out there. The taddy porter is good, but nothing to write home about. I consider it to be a fairly average porter. The taste is rather absent considering it's a porter."
"A very good porter. Drinkability is high. Would definitely seek out again."
"This beer is really something special. I am a big fan of porter's and this is certainly one of the best. Pours very dark, with very little head. The nose is rather surprising, all the dark malts that one would expect, but also a sour tang that goes delightfully well with the overall presentation. Taste is very mild, exceedingly smooth. Not too much roasted coffee here, but the chocolate is very pronounced towards the aftertaste. Somewhat lighter beer for the mouth than I had envisioned it, but overall the effect is great."
"cheers"
"D: An excellent porter that is super-smooth with a subdued, classic character."
"As you can tell, I feel pretty good about this beer. In fact, it is my favorite beer."
"Overall: I've only had a few English porters but I really enjoy them, this one in particular. The fact that the bitter chocolate and toffee flavors aren't as back seat as they are in American porters appeals to me. Definitely try this porter."
"Tastes like a malty roast heavy beer with a hint of caramel and maybe some coffee notes. Beautiful creamy mouthfeel with mild carbonation. This is one eminently drinkable beer. Thanks again Sam Smith."
"D: Rich and highly drinkable. Drier than expected and more roasted than expected, but ultimately a fantastic beer and deserving of the title Famous. I will have to drink the stout to get a baring on how this fits in the spectrum between nut brown and the stout."
"Overall, I love this beer for a great fit in moderation or for a session. Goes good with or without food. Just great porter. A must try."
"D - This brew has a lot of character, and there's definitely a nice balance between the roasted malt, bitter coffee/chocolate, and hops. This is a very solid, sessionable porter, and a great benchmark for other attempts at the style."
"Soft lightly carbonated mouthfeel that fits the beer and is reminiscent of many other Samuel Smith beers. Very well balanced between three main flavors: grassy hops, roasted malt, and sweet chocolate. Straightforward and delicious example of an English Porter. Great introduction to the style for the less experienced beer drinker and a solid staple for the seasoned veteran."
"D: We used to buy cases of the big bottles. this is a very drinkable beer. seems a bit metallic tonight but my taster may be off a bit."
"Excellent porter."
"Very drinkable, but also very filling. Clean, very crisp. No problem finishing this bottle. Overall, an exceptional porter. Slightly second, in my opinion, only to Entire Butt."
"good drinkability."
"The body seems a bit lighter than I would have expected. Still this is a very smooth beer. Obviously a low ABV and the presence of alcohol isn't really detected, making this an easy beer to drink and I wouldn't mind having another. I wouldn't go so far as to call this a session beer but it does make for a nice after dinner treat."
"As the previous poster noted, a little too rich for me to drink regularly, but excellent from time to time."
"Pours dark, dark, almost black with a small head. The taste is sweet with lots of molasses. While I would not turn this down if someone offered it to me, it would not be my first pick."
"Probably the best Porter going. Two thumbs way up."
"D: Very drinkable. Great as a dessert. Delicious."
"Very drinkable due to the smooth flavor and rich malty flavors inherent in a good porter."
"Great brew, worthy of it's 'famous' status."
"Body is about medium and a mouthfeel that is fairly smooth, but also going towards thin or watery -- perfectly satisfying anyway you put it. Carbonation is strong and stingy."
"(rated Jun 12, 2008)"
"Unfortunately since my initial review I have had this beer in a four pack of 12oz bottles and it had less flavor. Possibly due to age."
"Robust, good strong straight-forward flavor. No strong alcohol to overwhelm. Complex aroma, nice atmosphere. A good quaff to sit around and sip. Or power through and get another, whatever does it for ya'; as this one drinks easily enough to have another one."
"I think Sam Smith is an underachiever. Every beer of his that I come across comes close to greatness, but always falls short. Fortunately, this beer fals out of their normal paradigm. Very dark pour, with a ring of bubbles. Smoky with slight coffee and caramel malt aroma that is carried through in the flavor. Subdued, on the verge of weakness. A great example of a classic porter that avoids spilling into the stout category."
"Average drinkability I'm afraid. I'd probably go for a number of American porters over this one."
"This poured an opaque dark mahogany with tan head. It smelled like sweet vanilla and milk chocolate, with a bit of roasted barley. It tasted like subtle roasted barley and chocolate malts, with a bit of vanilla coffee and oak. It was thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a mildly sweet aftertaste. Overall this beer had a nice, clean flavor that was subtle but tasty. It was fuller bodied that I would typically expect from a porter (more like a stout), but it was really easy to drink. This is a beer I could enjoy over and over, although it's quite filling."
"Looks like the the English win this bout of the porters. But I would give Anchor porter another shot, maybe this bottle I have here is a bit old, but I can't tell."
"The color is deep, deep brown almost black with a thick tan head. Aromas of toasted malt, nuts, barley, coffee, chocolate and molasses. The taste is toasted malt, chocolate, coffee, slate, earth, barley, hops, and a smooth subtle chocolate coffee finish. this a good and very well made beer that is easy to drink."
"Very, very good brew. Pours black, motor oil style, smells of toasted coffee. Dark, toasted flavor, super creamy palate. A meal of a beer. Great winter brew, will definitely revisit this in the colder months, warms the belly very nicely."
"Poured from a 500mL bottle. The beer is brown with a thick fine-celled off-white foam. The smell is roasted malts, maybe a little chocolate, with a clean yeast aroma. The taste is classic porter, roasted malts with a lasting after-taste of chocolate. The body is thin but smooth and lightly carbonated, like a cask ale with extra fizziness. Very tasty, I'm liking everything I try from Samuel Smith's."
"A very hearty beer that I would not recommend during a hot summer day. This is one to enjoy late fall and all of winter."
"Future outlook: Superb in all areas. Repeat business an absolute certainty."
"Taste: Faint chocolate and coffee to it. I think I can best describe this beer as a dessert in a glass."
"This beer practically defines drinkable to me; great feel in the mouth, goes down beautifully."
"Taste: Bits of toffee, caramel, and a nice dark chocolate in the finish. Hard to really put a finger on the taste, not that its unbalanced, but with so much going on, good roasted flavors peeking around the corner. Its hard to distinguish a true taste on this. Hints of blackberry in the malt, very complex yet hard to disect."
"Notes: This is such a perfect porter. It has got to be the best porter I have ever had. The balance between the malts and the hops is heavenly. Do I dare give this art work all fives oh yes come hell or high water this gets fives across the board.Cheers"
"Pours a very dark brown color with ruby edges and a two finger foamy tan head. Aroma of oatmeal, roasted malts and hops. Lots of oatmeal and roasted malt up front, followed by chocolate, toffee and nut. Dry slightly bitter finish."
"A simple, excellent porter with a delightfully sudsy feel. This beer pours a very dark ruby with a big sudsy head that sticks around and coats the glass well. The smell is sweet with sugary malt and doesn't reach the same fullness found in the taste. The taste is restrained but complex. There is nice hop bitterness around the edges of a healthy malt backbone. There is a good deal of the earthy, musty flavor that marks porters, but it doesn't hit you over the head with it. The feel is almost exactly what I want out of a porter; suds build at the slightest movements. It is an immensely drinkable beer and I can certainly imagine spending a long evening drinking glasses of it in an English pub. I've been avoiding this beer for a little while as I'm not the biggest fan of porters or Sam Smith's beers, but the Taddy Porter has me changing my tune for the better."
"Drinkability - Low alcohol and great flavor make this a great candidate for sessioning. I'd love to sip on a few of these at home while watching a hockey game on TV."
"D - extremely easy to drink and delicious to boot."
"I really enjoyed this, as I paired it with a steak dinner, and then snacked on some dark chocolate covered nuts. Really went well with each, and presented it's own excitement on its own. Most impressive is the flavor and complexity you pull from this low ABV. I am not a huge stout/porter fan, but this has me grinning. Two thumbs up."
"D-Great drinkability. Extremely enjoyable. What a beer, with a very full flavor, yet relatively easy to drink."
"This one is a wonderful deep ruby colour, bordering on black, and the head was a frothy dark tan. The nose was really interesting as the first thing that hit me was soy sauce, which brought to mind the Pardubický Porter, however there were also light coffee hints and eventually something which brought to mind the kelp beds on the beaches back at home, which I am assuming was from the seaweed finings used in production. The pre-dominant flavour though was of caramelised bananas, one of my favourite desserts, as well as dark chocolate and a light coffee taste."
"Probably the perfect English Porter. I left some room for others as I have not had many of the style. Just proves that a beer does not have to have huge hops and high ABV to be excellant."
"D - A great porter that can be enjoyed again and again, never disappointing"
"Always on the lookout for a great porter, this one came highly recommended and it did not disappoint. Deep brown to black in the glass with a decent bit of foam on top. Rich roasted malt in the nose and the same in the initial taste, but the lighter body, subtle carbonation, and a hint of bitter hops balance the brew beautifully and make it extremely drinkable. Well worth seeking out. Just a quality porter. Period."
"Samuel Smith's, The Famous Taddy Porter pours dark with a two finger light brown head. It has a malty roasted aroma with hints of chocolate. This beer sure does have a nice mouthfell. Very smooth to me. It starts malty and sweet and finishes with a roasted chocolate and coffee flavor. Carbonation is right for the style. Seems to be very widely available across the fruited plain. The only negative for me is the somewhat high price tag."
"D- It didnt take much to put this porter down. I have to say it is one of the best porters i have had. Very great!"
"Overall this is a great beer. Nice complex malt flavors."
"M and D - smooth and soft and just perfect. I have to slow myself down, and enjoy every extra minute. Carbonation is fantastic, tiny bubbles help make it one easy to drink brew. this is the beer that brings me to the Sam Smith pubs!"
"I will definitely get this one again!"
"4.5 M&4.5 D: the mouthfeel is consistently smooth, even rounded, but has a refreshing texture, thanks to the tiny yet invisible bubbles in the black nectar; medium-bodied, with full flavour yet staying low-profile, this is a balanced porter with some excellent yet subtle characteristics. It takes time to explore this beer fully. Excellent beer."
"Very drinkable beer that is great."
"Was surprised that the beer was in a clear bottle as from looking at it the beer made the bottle look like the standard brown bottle. The foil was a pain to try and peel off ended up resorting to just using the bottle opener through it."
"The taste is mostly prunes, black pepper, red wine, with a hint of dark toast at first and soon chocolate and roasted grain and toast become stronger, esp. as it warms. The body is fairly light but it's lively and zesty. This is a good, solid, porter with lasting flavour and coimplexity."
"This is a very drinkable beer. Even though it's not a thirst-quencher, it is very flavorful, incredibly well balanced, and just tastes great."
"Overall, this is yet another badass English brew from the lovely people at the ol' Tadcaster brewery. I'm beginning to think that they're infallible, in fact."
"OVERALL: This is a very nice porter, one of the best I've had. Great nose and taste, as well as an excellent feel and finish. Golden. Very drinkable. Will re-visit this one for sure."
"D: What's not to like? I love porter and this is a darned good porter. I loved it before I reviewed it, I am loving it as I am reviewing it and I will love it again. Nuff said."
"D - This is one the best tasting porters around. Like all the other Samuel Smith's brews, an excellent example of the style. Compared to a lot of the other small brewery beers, Samuels Smith's is also an excellent value."
"Drinkability: This would make a great session beer. Would seek out again, but would have a hard time picking this up if it was next to the oatmeal stout."
"D- This would make a nice session porter, with a low abv. The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the sharp twang note off the bat in the taste department. Is this the best porter ever, I definitely think not, but I will definitely have it again."
"D: This is an excellent porter. So easy to drink and has a good amount of complexity in terms of flavour. One of Samual Smith's better offerings - I will be buying this one again."
"Surprisingly the alcohol is slightly noticeable at 5%, but it doesn't really detract from the drinkinabilty as this beer is incredibly smooth. I could session this one all night."
"A 550 mL bottle of ""The Famous Taddy Porter."" The beer is a deep chestnut brown color with a few centimeters of off-white foam. The aroma is inviting with chocolate, biscuit and barely detectable dark rum. Smooth and creamy on the palate. The flavor profile is chocolate and coffee with a little twang as it finishes smoothly. Flavorful and highly drinkable, this is great porter. Another classic from the folks at Samuel Smith."
"Loved drinking this for its aroma & flavour, makes me want to board the flying scotsman!"
"Pours a very nice dark brown, near black, with some excellent head, and just a bit of lacing. Nice strong scent, very dark, with hints of chocolate, a bit of vanilla, great burnt grains, but a slight alcohol scent, too, which is odd for a 5%er. Excellent taste as well, nice earthy flavor, good burnt grains, nice roast coffee finish, but again just a slight alcohol kick that shouldn't be there in a beer this strength. Very smooth, very silky. A truly wonderful porter."
"D: This beer is exceptionally drinkable. The few slight disappointments in taste would in no way prevent me from drinking another dozen pints. I find myself wishing I had bought more. Two thumbs up!"
"Pours darkness with a billowing dirty ivory head. Intricate lacing. Tantalizing smell of roasted malt and espresso. Roasted barley and hop bitterness on the tongue. Mouthfeel could definitely be fuller. Tadcaster brews have so far never failed to impress. This porter is great, just not quite of the same caliber as their oatmeal stout or Russian Imperial Stout."
"M + D: Smooth... creamy and well-rounded body which is a little more medium than it is full. An exceptionally easy drinker, and a great session beer. The price is usually right on them, too."
"Overall this is definitely worth a shot."
"This is an enjoyable, almost sessionable sipper and a stasndard-bearer for representation of a classic style. Well done."
"Does a porter get better than this? Pitch black in color with a fluffy brown head that goes away quickly but not before releasing tremendous amounts of bread, chocolate and molasses, even a little butter. The taste is so very smooth and mellow but is probably the most complex thing I've ever had. It would take several sessions to sort out all the flavors, but there's a malty spine of roasted Things that is incredibly attractive. It's rather filling; I had half the bottle one evening, sealed the remainder with a vacu-vin and finished it the next night. The difference in taste was pronounced: the chocolate was even more present, and the roasty taste was so much more developed."
"Man, what a beer. Rich chocolate with toffee and a bit of mocha java around the edges. The aroma is full of the same candy and cocoa flavors and the aftertaste has a hint of herbal hops to it. This is easily the best English porter, maybe just porter, I've had. Damn."
"D - This stuff is Stellar and could easily be sessioned, I would recommend trying this beer."
"I can't exactly pick out what the star of this brew is, and the flavors certainly aren't muddled, but I could drink this for hours and never get bored of it. I'd drink this every day of my life, and I can because it's available just a block from my house."
"Overall a very solid brew by Sam Smith. Some of their stuff I think is overrated (Oatmeal Stout, Pale Ale) but this one hits the mark. A very drinkable and enjoyable porter. Nice."
"Overall, a good porter. I continue to be impressed with Samuel Smith's beers."
"Very enjoyable. Will come back to this one."
"Very dark, almost black color. Poured a nice tan creamy head and left a good amount of lace. Roasted malt aroma and flavor with some coffee taste in there too. Slightly tart and peppery. Nice and warming and probably a decent choice during the winter. Medium to full-bodied and rich. One of the best Porter's I've tried, which generally are not one of my favorite styles."
"Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter poured a very nice dark brown almost black, with an excellent fluffy tan head. Smell seamed very light to me. Hints of dark fruits. Taste however was not light. Tons of chocolate taste on the entry. Followed by coffee and bittersweet flavors. Mouthfeel was good. Drinkablity was ok. I found it the slightly filling. Overall this is a great porter, very flavorful. Will buy again."
"D- I'm kinda kicking myself for waiting so long to try this. Porters are my favorite and this ranks up there with the best of them. If you like Samuel SMith Oatmeal Stout you will like this as well. Samuel SMith knows what they are doing."
"Overall, a very delicious porter from one of the older breweries in England. A well balanced ale that leaves you waiting for another sip, or another bottle! A few of these could definitly be had and enjoyed in a session. Also most Sam Smith beers can usually be found in most decent beer stores and all their offerings are excellent. Don't be afraid to grab a couple!"
"Wow. As black as tar in the mug revealing a deeeep ruby hue if held up to sunlight. Frothy, hearty, reddish-brown head of medium size bubbles that forms an impressive clingy cap after it settles a bit. Relatively light aroma of chocolate and dates. Complex on the palette; coffee, dark chocolate, bread, and toasted malts. Surprisingly light body for a beer so dark but this is a good thing. Nice mouthfeel and super smooth. The coffee finish just goes on and on. Impressive."
"Drinkability:Very drinkable, this is how a great english porter should taste. I love it!"
"While it smells like it might be a rough and dry and heavy brew, it is actually closer to medium-bodied than fullish. The coffee, chocolate and hints of roasted malt mix with something buttery to make for a very smooth and somewhat creamy offering that is very tastey and flows down your throat. Finishes with only a slight dry backbite with some sweetness on it. I haven't had too many porters, and I might not have to have another one. This beer tastes great, is filling and with a low ABV I culd sit and drink this ALL day. Top notch."
"D - This is a great session beer I could drink this all night while playing some darts in a bar worth finding to try"
"This is definitely one of the best English Porters out there. Very drinkable."
"The body is a little light, but it's not too thin. Drinkability is very high."
"I could easily enjoy one or two but probably not any more than that. I only have the one bottle and I doubt I'll buy more. It was definitely a nice pre-lunch treat."
"D-I'll come back to this one."
"D.I would have no problem drinking all four of these tasty treats."
"Overall, definitely a great porter. If this is available from a cask, I imagine it could get almost all 5's after some of the alcohol mellowed out."
"Drinkability is pretty high. Went well with a grilled steak, and was nice on its own after dinner."
"Finish is full of raisins. Roasty & malty, and very drinkable."
"Drinkability is amazing. I could drink this all day long, and wish I could."
"I've been meaning to try making chocolate mousse for a while and their serving suggestion of pairing this has given me inspiration."
"I would love to try this beer at a pub that had it on draft. In the meantime, I will be purchasing more of the Taddy Porter when the mood strikes. It is mid-July at the time of this review and I think my enjoyment of this beer will only increase as the Fall and Winter months set in."
"Even though I am not even close to being a real beer advocate yet, I would have to say this is the best beer I have tried so far. Tasted great, smelled great, and felt great. I have drinkin this a few more times since I treid it and I always get the same impression."
"Of the three Samuel Smith beers I've tried so far, this is by far the best. I highly recommend it."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, decent kick, very good representation of style, this is a nice porter with a good complexity that is worth drinking for a long time."
"drinkability - Didn't taste like a porter to me, was more like a wine, I didn't finish the beer, i did share it with others and we were not a fan."
"D - The crisp flavor profile and low abv make for a very sessionable porter. Definitely gonna pick some more of this up"
"I simply adore the old school label on this beer. Enjoyed in a plastic glass in a basic student resident. This is luxury! Classic black appearance with a ruby hue, and a thick tan head that provides generous sheets of lacing. The aroma has cocoa, caramel and figs. Great malty flavours at play, with a cocoa smoothness playing off a slight coffee bitterness, and a lot of depth similar to raisins. Fairly medium bodied and chewy mouthfeel with minimal carbonation. Huge drinkability. Highly recommended."
"MF&D - Creamy medium bodied English Porter. Rich and delicious. Highly recommended."
"An incredible brew. One of the best porters I've had."
"But, this is a porter and not a stout. I think it really sets the bar for the style, not going overboard and pretending to be a stout, while still being a force to be reckoned with. Drinkability is way high, the only limiting factor is that it's kind of expensive. Worth the try, highly recommended."
"D: Reminds me of a good after dinner beer, very sweet, not too filling, lower ABV makes me want to drink several in one sitting."
"I had higher expectations. Maybe a bad batch?"
"D - Mammoth Drinkability... Highly enjoyable... A beer to be savored and enjoyed, not rushed... A very relaxing brew..."
"Very drinkable brew, thinner than some Porters, but overall a very nice drink."
"D: I put this one down rather quickly. It's probably as sessionable of a porter as you'll ever find because of it's smooth feel, wonderful taste, and lower ABV. 5."
"Smooth, fullish in body and succulently quaffable. Taddy is ""Famous"" for a reason."
"Feel/Drinkability: Creamy and smooth feel with light tinglyness from the carbonation. A complex and drinkable porter. Not my favorite style, but with that being said it still rocks. Not quite as hoppy as i would have prefered BUT its one of the better porters ive had to date."
"This is a classic English porter. A dark brown color with a nice tan head. Very roasty malt structure with chocolate and coffee. The flavor profile is also quite roasty. Some mild hops and bitter molasses balance out sweet chocolates. The body is crisp and dry. A good drinker."
"M/D - Very thin feel but also very smooth. Very drinkable porter."
"Good, drinkable porter. The dry, tangy aftertaste isn't that pleasant after a while, but it is a smooth brew that is a great example of an english porter."
"Drinkability: This is a definitely fun porter to drink. Every sip keeps me redefining what I decided upon after the last sip. The smell and taste seem to contradict each other at times, and keep me thinking. Twelve ounces seemed to evaporate in a crazy amount of time. I would have enjoyed having maybe three of these right now, in order to really get some time with this one. For some reason, it seems hard to put my finger on the experience, but it is definitely enjoyable and repeatable."
"D - Very drinkable, if only is was a little less expensive."
"D - Nice malty character with pleasing chocolate and caramel notes. Easily drinkable."
"Overall, a highly drinkable porter with no real flaws. Highly recommended."
"The taste is great.... big bold caramel comes right off, lightly balanced with a tinge of bitter coffee-chocolate flavors, finishing with a crisp tangy almost- apple-like flavor. Its so well balanced, it seems over-simplified, but that really is the beauty of Sam Smith.... beautiful simplicity... very very drinkable, much lighter than it looks... a classic beer for any situation."
"I hate mentioning other beers in reviews, but I would not be drinking this over my Sinebrychoff Porter. It just tastes too simple and thin and I think that really detracts from the richness and complexity that the brew should be exhibiting."
"A highly drinkable, incredibly flavorful, and beautifully scented porter. At 5% ABV it's also a great session beer. If only all sessions were this complex! Complex, yet accessible. I would love to try this on tap one day. In a pub. In England."
"Oh joy of joys, one of my favorite porters of all time. Samuel Smith hasn't let me down yet. Enjoyed barely chilled in my Warsteiner mug. Poured a rich, midnight chocolate brown. Smelled of fresh baker's chocolate with a hint of berries and bread dough. Taste was smooth and complex, rich and layered. Coffee, chocolate, hints of biscuit, and a kiss of fruit. Good times and cheers!"
"I'm no expert when it comes to porter, but this is the best I've had hands down. I can actually differentiate this from a stout, a distinction I have trouble with regarding other porters."
"Notes: Impressive complexity coming from such an unimposing beer. Very good stuff."
"Note: Last a drank a Sammy Smith's it came in a clear glass bottle, this one is brown. I don't know when they changed but I am glad they did."
"Has become one of my top three beers of all time!"
"Taste: Introduction is slightly watery, but the beer is full of flavor. Nice, big malty profile that is primarily roasted coffee, but also has a nice creamy chocolate flavor. Finish is nice and smooth with a lingering black coffee note."
"A damn fine beer. The diacetyl, buttery mouthfeel and taste compliments the porter flavors very well. Its smooth, refreshing and flows easily down the throat. Very nice!"
"D: This is one of the best porters I've ever had. By far the best English Porter import. I've never been able to drink more than a few porters and I'm glad because I start to lose the distinction of flavor."
"D-this is a stand alone porter that deserves to be revisited in short order"
""
"An old favorite revisited...black body with brown creamy quarter-inch head that leaves a flawless lacing...roasted coffee, rich toffee, smooth and smoky accents... creamy palate--unbelievably smooth and milky...the texture is as firm as it is lacey...mellow and natural, almost perfect in its proficiency....the reason I fell in love with beer tasting, selecting from the beer menu at Russell's in Bloomsburg nearly ten years ago....for those Strat fans out there, like finding a SUPREME defensive rating...if you only drink light lagers and the occasional green bottle, start (and end) with this one from the dark side..."
"This beer pours a nice dark red-brown with a short and thin off-white head that fades to a ring around the top of the beer. It laces the glass pretty well all the way down the glass. It smells of very faint chocolate and coffee and roasted malts. The taste is really good as well. It tastes of the same as the nose with some hoppy bitterness in the middle of it that rounds it off very well. It tastes of sweet roasted malt, some chocolate, then some hoppy bitter taste, and then finally a caramel flavor that is really nice. The mouthfeel is very smooth and clean which makes for a very drinkable porter. Definately worth a try."
"Overall, this is definitely another winner from ol' Tadcaster. I recommend trying one for sure."
"If you're into porters, this is a good beer to get. I only drink them but so often, but this is a good one. It has a nice taste and isn't overly heavy."
"Overall a deliciously drinkable porter, definitely on the sweet side, but pretty well balanced. Just like I like 'em. If you haven't tried it, do yourself a favor. It's pricey, but worth the cash."
"D- Porter is not my favorite but they are starting too grown on me. This was a good beer and very drinkable. I do not know if I would drink it with a meal, but before one as an appetizer or after as dessert would be great. I might get it again. The taste was a bit off fro me so I might choose another porter before this one, but I would not pass this one up if it was offered to me."
"D: Great porter - sessionable - well deserving of its fine reputation."
"P.S paired this with a grilled frikadellen on a crusty roll, meat was a nice combo with the smokey roasted bitterness."
"This is a nice session beer , packed with flavor."
"D: This is a slow drinker to say the least, but a very enjoyable and complex beer. Much better than the other English porters I've had. I could drink maybe two of the big 550ml bottles, but it'd take me a while because I'd savor them so much! Definitely one of my new favorite beers!"
"Overall, the competence and talent of the brewers is apparent in this beer but it just wasn't for me. It was obviously well thought out and well made, I guess I'm just not a fan of this type of beer. Oh well."
"D - fantasitic on a cold night, seasonal for me."
"Overall: Great porter with a full body. Delivers on the hype."
"D: Well rounded balanced with full flavors makes this a stand out and a joy to consume."
"It's been at least a few years since I've had a Taddy Porter and damn glad I picked another up.... This brew could easily be a session or a sipper depending on my mood."
"Bottoms up!"
"Extremely easy drinking for a beer which such great flavors. Truly world class in my book."
"D: My favorite English Porter. Enough said. I only wish it didn't cost so much. I could break the bank with it."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: I was quite surprised by the mouthfeel of this beer. I quite expected more carbonation, however this beer has very little. This does makes sense to me though, the historical porter was originally a blend of three beers, a stale one, a mild and, a pale. Seems to me like there was a good chance the final product would have very little carbonation due to the stale, not to mention these were all real ales and cask conditioned to mention meaning they would have less carbonation to begin with. I believe that the mouthfeel on this engineered porter is just about perfect, seems to be very accurate according to descriptions. This is one drinkable beer, great to session. Prolly the best English porter I've ever had, well at least to date. Real impressed with this one, I will be coming back to it. Anytime I feel the need for an authentic English Porter this is where I'll look."
"Mouth is left clean and dry."
"Quite black with a nice creamy head. Smells of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, some smoke and sweetness. Delicious taste that tastes just as it smells and the texture is perfect. Nice and creamy with light carbonation and just perferct. This is the best beer I've had in a while."
"This beer is excellent and I would highly recommend it. I order this beer every time I'm anywhere that serves it."
"Mouthfeel is full, but has a moderate body and finishes tannic and powdery, dry and crisp. Small bubbly tingle flourishes in the finish. This is a great beer that brings back fond memories. Tasty and highly drinkable."
"Pours a thick brown/black with a nice tan head. The froth of the head clings to the glass all the way down. Very smooth beer with all sorts of different flavors coming through. Chocolates,figs,coffee,and berries are just to name a few. It is low on carbonation and very filling. Refreshing and crisp on the palate, leaves it begging for more. Very easy do drink and if you get hooked you can drink it all night."
"A good quafable porter that is recommended."
"very sessionable."
"D - overall a good porter that I would rink for but nothing that really blows you away. a good beer from Sam smith but not one that I would go out of my way for. I like it but you have to definitely be a fan of the roasty aspect of a beer to enjoy this one. Also you to enjoy the thick mouthfeel to really enjoy this beer. Overall a good porter that nearly exemplifies the style without doing anything crazy to the style. This is an English porter and what it should be."
"This may be one of my favorite porters. Lots of flavor in this beer."
"D - Below par, with some elements that detract from the overall enjoyment."
"Drinkability: nice session porter. Easy to quaff and a nice beer that I pick up every now and again."
"Velvety soft mouthfeel. Rich and creamy and a medium-heavy body. This is the first Taddy Porter I've had since I started reviewing and even after hundreds of other beers it's still as amazing as I remember. A legendary beer from a legendary brewery and for damned good reason."
"I'm already liking this as I pour it into a pint glass. As black as a stout with an attractive whipped head. Mocha and chocolate in the aroma, quite sweet. A little roasted character too. Okay now, first sip...mmm. Delightful. Not too heavy and not too light. Flavors are soft, some roasted flavor and baking chocolate, a little smokiness on the side. It's somewhat sweet too. Very pleasant indeed."
"d - a decent porter for me, but a little more sweet then I would have liked."
"Pours deep auburn with large bubbles in the tan head and leaves no ring or lacing inside the pint glass. Aroma presents chocolate and little coffee with subtle hints of dark cherries and sugared raisins. A roasted flavor of chewy chocolate nougat, nuts, and coffee again. These flavors help accentuate the medium body and soft mouthfeel that balance the finish of bitter hops and dense malt. Famous Taddy is a very enjoyable and flavorsome benchmark porter from a brewery rich in English tradition and history."
"2013 Update: Slight adjustment upwards by .25 points. This beer has stood the test of time, still awesome."
"This is a perfect beer for a slow night by the fire. Excellent."
"This beer far exceeded my expectations."
"I was fairly disappointed with this. It wasn't bad, just not as robust as I had hoped after immensely enjoying both Samuel Smith's Oatmeal and Imperial stouts. I'm glad I had it, but I would take the Oatmeal Stout over this any day."
"I recommend this beer to anyone who likes porters. It is one of the best I have tried if not the best. I mean all you need to do is look at the reviews and scores of this beer to realize that it is a great one."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, with a mild carbonation. Leaves a bit of stickiness on the lips. Very sessionable. A most excellent porter indeed!"
"A classic of the style. Pours a very dark brown, almost black, with a thick, creamy, tan head that fades to a ring. Smells roasty and winey with notes of chocolate and dark sherry. Tastes beautifully balanced between the firm malt, roastiness, slightly bready flavor in the background, and a touch of graininess. Very smooth and easy drinking. Nice to revisit an old favorite."
"Poured very, very dark brown, not much light passed though. It had a small tan head and smelled a little of perhaps coffee? chocolate? perhaps a mix of the two. Taste was malty, coffee and a bit chocolatey but not as good as I expected from Sam Smiths as their other beers are GREAT. This was onlt good at best. You want a real Porter..go for Rogues Mocha Porter"
"I certainly agree with many when i say this is probably one of the best porters i have tasted. It pours stunningly black with a tan head that makes for a perfect picture. It smells a little chocolaty and nutty, as well as a little scent of coffee. Its taste is creamy and smooth, ending with a little chocolate on the tongue as well as a mild nut after-taste. A very complex tasting beer. This is absolutly a traditional porter, a must for any porter lover."
"This is probably the best porter I've yet sampled... Samuel Smith is probably one of my favorite breweries, and this beer clearly justifies my strong liking of the company... pours a pitch-black, opaque color with a decent tan head... smell is of burnt chocolate and espresso... taste is full of cocoa, dark coffee, chocolate, and slight malts... an excellent porter, goes down smooth with no hints of bitterness... semi-sweet dark chocolate flavor lingers on the palate and is very sweet and satisfying... would go great with anything sweet, especially chocolate... very crisp, clear flavor... awesome sample... definitely recommended..."
"Another great beer from samuel smith, one of the better porters I have have."
"A sweet tasting beer from the roasted malt and coffee and hints of chocolate, a little bit of hops helps to not make it overwhelmingly sweet. Quite thick and creamy for a porter, not thin like some other porters tend to be."
"It had a nutty flavor and again of chocolate on the tongue. It was comfortable to drink and was soft in the mouth. Overall a solid beer."
"This is about as good a traditional porter that you will find in the bottle. It pours a luscious thick and creamy head that is nicely tan and smooth. The beer retains and laces quite well. The smell is deep chocolate, mocha, perhaps some raisin or plum, definitely roasted malts. The taste is very smooth and emininently drinkable. You will experience a strong roasted malt taste throughout but more pronounced in the finish with more of the creamy mocha and chocolate flavors on the front end. This beer is just a pleasure. The mouthfeel is pure cream. The aftertaste is a bit tart, perhaps a bit too roasty, but still reasonably mild. This beer is medium bodied from start to finish, buttery, creamy, and unlike so many poor imitations, not at all watery and thin. This beer is a classic for its style and well worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Drinkability is better than most porters, but this beer almost tastes more like a stout than a porter."
"Drinkability is great."
"This is a nice beer, I could definitely put a few of these back."
"D: This beer goes down very easy and I could drink plenty of these with some pub fare. The bitter after taste would hinder a session that didn't include food, but only slightly."
"I'm noticing a real trend with Samuel Smith after sampling two of their brews. I'm hoping it doesn't continue. There is a seriously wicked vinegary/salty after-taste to this beer. The taste is delicious butterscotch, some coffee ... even some dark roasted fruits and malt, but it is absolutely destroyed by some component I cannot identify. As a result, a beer that becomes less and less drinkable by the minute."
"Pours deep black with a beautiful and thick two-finger brown head which turns fluffy as it as it slowly fades away leaving a consistent lacing all around. Smells of roasted malts and a hint of sweet candy and cocoa. Tastes of dark chocolate and nuts. Not as full-bodied or thick as I would have expected, but drinkable and fairly tasty, although I do like my porters a little bolder."
"D- this has definitely increased my fondness for porters and the like and for a hophead such as myself, the perfect balance that i always find coming from the tadcaster is a welcome in my fridge anytime."
"D - One of the most complex porters I've ever tried. Ridiculously well built and solidly hopped. This is a shining example of what the art of brewing can be! Sadly, I'm poor and this is not cheap stuff. Anyhow, I think that there are lesser porters out there as far as drinkability."
"D: Pretty drinkable, but a little rich. I don't think I could drink more than 1 or 2 of these in an evening."
"D - Interesting beer. I like it enough to finish one and try it again another time."
"Probably the best porter I've ever had, this tasty masterpiece from Samuel Smith is a must for porter lovers. It might also be the best beverage that Samuel Smith brews. The head is a light creamy brown, modest but durable, and the body leaves a bubbly lattice work along the mug as it recedes. Taddy Porter is practically black in color. The flavors are subtle but noticeable, with chocolate, a bit of caramel, and a hint of mocha present. Smooth and with just the right amount of carbonation, Taddy Porter is easy on the palate, while accosting the taste buds with a multitude of flavors. It isn't at all difficult to follow one with another, and it also intersperses well with a good brown ale or a fruity, flavorful Belgian style. Close to a masterpiece."
"Another is a line of great brews."
"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights and about a finger of light brown head with good retention. Aroma is great, malty, roasty, and slightly chocolaty. Taste is mostly roasty but chocolate, caramel, toffee and biscuits round out the flavor. Almost no bitterness and no hop flavor. Good mouthfeel, medium-light body, moderately-low carbonation. Drinkability is excellent. This is a smooth, well-balanced, easy drinking brew. This is a great session beer and one I will certainly be having again."
"Drinkability: If you like darker beers, this is one of the best examples of an easy to drink porter. Not overly robust, but a little sweet and relaxing. In my opinion a great beer for a great winter session beer."
"Pours a thick black color with an ample brown head. Aroma is sweet and malty with some hints of coffee/chocolate in the nose. Taste starts out simple upfront and then fades to a mild smokiness/coffee flavor at the back of the throat. Has the complexity of a chocolate malt beverage. It's certainly very drinkable and true to the style. Decent."
"just as with the nut brown the flavor features more hops than the aroma suggests. robust, dry malty flavors. there's a creaminess to it that carries well the small amount of sweetness"
"D-Although overall this is very good beer, the drinkability for me ios not that high. It is above average and I will have it again but most likely only one bottle per session when I have it."
"This beer was a little different than what I was expecting in terms of taste. Before I get to that, let me say it's a great beer but maybe not one most people would go for everytime. It was very dark with creamy coloured head, leaving a nice lace around the glass. The smell is pretty strong and you can definently smell somethng slightly sweet and chocolately, and something that smelled to me like a dark roast coffee. And the mouthfeel! Mighty thick, in a good way. And so smooooth. Velvetly almost. Finally, the taste was rich and strong; the actual coffee taste is somewhat stronger than the smell. It leaves a bit of a bite on your palate that's rather tart and kind of reminded me of raisins. Overall, its a nice one from Sam Smith."
"D - Highly drinkable, extremely sessionable, each sip invites the next.."
"Incredible porter with tons of flavour. Robust, delicious, and would like to see more often."
"I will definitely be picking this up again."
"Overall, a solid brew, but probably not something I would drink on a regular basis."
"D: Tasty(yet subtle), easy on the tongue. I might get this every once in awhile. It's no Ed Fit but it holds it's own. Went great with my pork loin but had no chance versus the garlic mashed potatoes."
"Overall a nice beer in many respects, but it falls down a bit on taste. It just seems to have a very dull flavor. However, it's definitely a quality beer and worth a try."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very dark brown on the pour and appears black in the glass with a huge, frothy brown-tan head that dies down quickly. The smell is not overwhelming but what is there is enjoyable. Slightly roasted malts and chocolate are about all that is discernable. The taste is also pretty neutral but enjoyable. Very well balanced, slightly malty and finishes smooth. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a creamy, velvety, light carbonation. A very very drinkable beer, excellently done but no real wow factor. I guess if you make a beer that is this sessionable and smooth, wow is not an issue."
"This is an outstanding porter. Smells of toffee, coffee, roasted nuts, and chocolate. Another buttery offering with a nice head and some lacing. Also has a scent of caramel. Taste is great, of bittering hops and coffee. Some nice butterscotch flavoring to it as well. An interesting beer and again, at a lower price I would buy this all the time."
"One of my favorite beers, the Taddy Porter is highly drinkable and gets better as it warms."
"D: Would pair well with a steak or beef meal with chips. a little heavy but packs full flavor."
"D: This is a nice, drinkable beer. Doesn't blow me away, but quite sessionable."
"Pours a thick dark coffee color. Fizzy cola colored head settles very quickly. Smells faintly of toasted malt, peat, oak, coffee, maybe even vanilla. Taste is remeniscent of a dark chocolate very high in cacao. Taste lightly roasted Mouthfeel is slightly fizzy, mildly astringent, but with just enough sweetness to balance out any undesireables. Drinkability is good, flavor is well balanced. Nice malty profile. I'd definetly drink this again."
"Drinkability: A solid porter, not the best one I've had nor the worse. Very good though"
"Mothers milk in my humble opinion. This is the best porter I have tried so far and the one all others will be judged by. A good winter beer, I love the strength of flavor while at the same time being very smooth. Complex coffee/roasted grains/hint of chocolate flavors that change as the beer warms in my glass."
"Very dark brown to black in color below nice tan head which dissipates rather quickly but leaves some lacing on the surface and on the sides of the glass. Not a powerful aroma. Notes of toasted malt, sweetness, maybe a touch of chocolate. Taste is straightforward dark malts again with a hint of chocolate. Some herbal hops in the finish. Nice bittersweet aftertaste. Extremely well balanced. Tasty. Mouthfeel is medium not overly carbonated. Very drinkable stuff. Really good English style porter."
"Comments: God bless Samuel Smith. I really liked this beer; it's something very different from the rest of the porters. I will say one thing, I was expecting this porter to have more of a nutty taste, like Fuller's Porter. No worries though, this is a very nice and unique beer."
"Of all the finest beers of all the lands the Taddy Porter ranks near the top of the list. The beutiful black color with just a hint of ruby held to the light, The granite nose and finish, with a biscutty maltiness underneth. Roasty, Chocolatey, hints of coffee it's all here. With a deceptively light body. and ever deepening levels of malt, this is everything beer should be."
"D: This beer was solid all the way around. The bitterness gave it a nice character that complimented the smooth nature of the beer, Definitely a solid beer."
"Final Statement: A lovely porter, will definately purchase a bottle of this. I like this more than Fullers."
"Drinkability: Nothing objectionable to prevent me from having more than one...(except that ""In Good Taste"" has so many good beers that I must move on and try another....). This is recommended for the Porter style."
"Samuel Smith's, The Famous Taddy Porter pours a very dark brown, nearly black with a milk chocolate colored head from a brown twelve ounce bottle with a foil neck and crown cover. Caramel malt and a hint of chocolate make up the aroma. The flavor is also caramel malt, a bit of chocolate, some raison is also present, and maybe even a hint of coffee. I'd like a thicker mouthfeel. A very enjoyable beer."
"D - This is a very good porter.Great sweet chocolate and caramel flavors."
"Pours black with light brown head that stayed throughout. Nice aroma of caramel and black licorice. Softly carbonated. Very tasty, excellent porter. This stuff is fine and I highly recommend it to those of you who like Porters. If you like Porters do yourself a favor and try it."
"Drinkability - Pretty good. There are much better, but much worse porters out there."
"drinkability is good due to the lighter body for the style. this one is less filling than most porters, but goes down extremely smooth."
"Poured into a pint glass, a thick head arises that is tan in color. The head does not dissipate fully, and sticks to the sides of the glass. The porter is a nice dark brown color with a reddish hue when held to the light. Smell is of chocolate and roasted nuts. The mouthfeel is full-bodied with a little carbonation, but not so little that it feels watery. This has got to be one of the best porters that I have had. A nice chocolate/roasted nut/smoky flavor. The flavor is surprising at the start, but continues to be pleasant throughout. This beer is a little heavy, so I don't think I could drink it in any situation, but one thing can be said... the Samuel Smith Brewing Co. knows what they are doing."
"Drinkability - Soft and easy. Goes down well, will gladly have another when available."
"The metallic flavour carried over into the taste, but not overly so. Lightly roasted and chocolate malt flavours mixed well with mild coffee bitterness and a hint of black licorice. Lightly carbonated but medium-bodied  not watery at all."
"D - Traditional porter taste that sets the bar high with a complexity and drinkability that can hardly be touched. As the beer warms the fruity English ale character comes out and smokiness nestles under the great porter sweetness. An all around great ale."
"Bottom line: Samuel Smiths certainly can crank out the fine brews. No wonder they are my favourite brewery from the UK!"
"Overall, I think this is the best on style of the SS's I have had, and also is my favorite."
"Drinkability  Great. A nice Porter that is tasty and reliable as any."
"M?D: this is very good creamy and elicious. this beer is worth a try and is easy to drink its worth a try. its a great porter that seems to have a little something extra."
"Drinkability - Quite good and enjoyable. Would definitely get this again."
"18.7 oz bottle into a mug. Appearance is dark brown with some occasional lighter brown hints along the edges of the mug. A nice one finger tan heard, with no real lacing. Nose is very mild, light roasted malt hints. Taste is solid; smooth and oddly clean for a porter. Light lemon, some toasted malt. Just a very mild hint of hops in the end. Feel is medium bodied, pretty good. Overall, a tasty porter, if nothing too noticeable or strong."
"Got some bite to it - this is not a dessert porter, but much to be respected. Don't drink this one cold at all - needs warmth to show its character, otherwise the bitter/tart notes take over."
"Overall a very drinkable brew. I could drink a few of these easy. As I said before this is definitely on the lighter side and could use a bit more complexity. Another great offering from Samuel Smith...they have yet to disappoint."
"WORTH A TRY MOST DEFINITLY! Close to perfect."
"Very dark in color with no light through glass. Medium head but not lasting long and with no noticeable lacing. Smell is a little sweet, then smoky chocolate. Taste is also smoky with a hint of chocolate or coffee. Not very complex as expected for a Porter but it may add to its drinkability. Mouthfeel is medium but a little acidic on the perimeter of the tongue. Overall a good beer."
"All though this is extremely deliscious I would say that more than two would be hard to drink. The intense and dark flavors make this more of a slow sipper!"
"A must buy."
"Appearance is very dark reddish amber with a thick creamy head that sticks around. Smell of roasted malts and dark chocolates. Taste again of rich roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee. Mouthfeel is medium thats smooth and creamy making it easy to swallows. So far it's been hard for Samuel Smith to dissapoint me, it's a very well balanced porter and great one to try for anybody shy of darker beers."
"D - makes good company with the nut brown ale and the oatmeal stout."
"D: It's smooth and sweet finish makes this beer easy to drink for a long time."
"Drinkability: For me, it could use just a bit more body, but perhaps the current recipe tested better with focus groups. So what do I know? Still, though, its a worthy English porter and exceedingly drinkable."
"It gets only a good for drinkability, but it's not it's fault. I wish this was fresh from the tap. Still very good, better as it warms. It is a tasty beverage."
"Color is a rich deep brown, almost black - which I like in a porter. Aroma is intriguing - with one sniff I get hints of chocolate, with the next, roast coffee. Flavor is not as rich as I expected, but it is typical of a good porter with strong hoppy overtones, smoky undertones, and a soupcon of coffee. This is a beer to be sipped and savored, not chugged."
"I will have another. I could drink several of these."
"Poured from a 16.9oz brown bottle, is a dark black you can't see through with a 3 finger creamy tan head on aggressive pour. Aroma is very chocolaty, and the taste initially comes off as a lot of bittersweet chocolate. Halfway into the glass it becomes a little more roasty and acidic. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth. Carbonation isn't too high and enough to make it interesting."
"Drinkability- Good flavor and texture. One of the better traditional porters out there."
"Pours a clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice one finger plus tan creamy head which lasts a little while, nice small islands and sticky lacing afterwards. The nose is roasted malts, and toffee. The taste is very nice of malts/toffee. Medium body. Very drinkable, this brew really surprised me, very tasty. Will definitely add this one to my list."
"Pours a big head, I almost had it fall over the top, but the head was so great that it fell over the edge and stayed! It came back and left a thick little head that didn't go anywhere. The color is black. A slight malty characteristic comes through with a little roastiness, nothing big and noticable. The flavor is very bready, but light. Slight roasted malts and bread, that's all I got. Mouthfeel was nice, wasn't as smooth as I like my porters. I would try this again, but not anytime soon, good experience though."
"I made this a sam smith's weekend thanks to the brown bottles! 460 reviews as of this posting. I won't pontificate to extremes about how good this beer really is. I will say this is one of my favorites of this style, if not the favorite of the style. Enjoy it if you see one, it's worth trying!"
"D- flavor increases as brew warms, easy drinking, sessionable, recommended, great for someone who is afraid of dark beer."
"The creamy texture satisfies, and despite looking heavy the beer was not filling. A 22 oz bottle was easy drinking. ."
"Dark color, creamy, white head that retains some of the darker hues of the drink. Smells slightly yeasty, kind of a fruity apple aroma smells sweet. Taste is somewhat malty, not overly strong, seems well carbonated a little over carbonated for my liking but does not affect the overall quality, finishes well with a bite that leaves a persistent roasted malt after taste, overall a smooth pleasant combination."
"Pours dark with a great, creamy head. Aroma is a grainy coffee. Easy to drink and medium-bodied, a mild coffee taste is the main characteristic. This seems a little less malty than other porters, but it's well-balanced and a top-notch pick for a fine brew. The only downside is its price."
"This beer is black with a thick cream color head. The smell is sweet, roasted, and coffee like. The taste is malty, roasted, and sweet. The mouthfeel is heavy, just shy of chewy. I think that this is a great example of a porter beer. The smoothness and flavor make it quite drinkable."
"Not over the top. Not really strong. Diverse and pleasant. The flavors all work nicely together, with no noticeable downside. Quite tasty."
"Drinkability: A well-made porter from Samuel Smith."
"I could drink a bunch of these so I will rate it high on the Drinkability Scale."
"The beer pours opaque black with a full tan head. The foam quickly disapates leaving behind a light cover throughout the the drink. The aroma is more complex than I was expecting. More chocolate and caramel than coffee. I Get a little blueberry as well. The flavor has more coffee, dark malt than the aroma. There's noticable hop bitternes, but not much for aromatic hops. Hips are well balanced with the malt characteristics such that neither is overpowering. The mouthfeel is on the light side, but this isn't a Russian Imperial Stout. Carbonation level is good. This is a good drink. I'm not a porter/stout fan by any stretch of the imagination, but this is better than many other porters I've had."
"This is a classic English porter for sure. Makes for a nice ""session""."
"D: I couldn't have but one of these beers, very rich, very strong but good."
"An excellent beer overall and extremely sessionable drinkability. Not many better ways to spend an evening that with a few of these. If you enjoy English porter (or any porter for that matter), make sure you experience this beer."
"Poured an almost black color, moderate tan head that left little lacing. The smell is of caramel & roasted malts, buttery toffee. The taste is of light toffee, caramel, hint of coffee, a bit sour. Lightly carbonated with a full body nice and smooth. Very good overall though I not a huge fan of the style. I could knock back a few."
"The taste is extraordinary. There is a certain burnt grain taste up front, accompanied by coffee, chocolate, and a syrupy sweet malt flavor. There is an ever so slight bitterness to the finish for balance. This brew is smooth, rich, and complex. Mouthfeel is fairly full and creamy. It is incredibly drinkable. This is by far my favorite Porter I've tried, and another outstanding beer from Sam Smith."
"But seriously, good porter."
"The porter pours a nice deep coffee brown, with a light beige head that thins quite quickly. It offers up a rather heady almost earthy dense smell. The taste is a bit coffee and cocoa flavored initially, but with a light sweetness following. It finishes clean, with sharpness more expected with a higher ABV. The mouthfeel is rather thick and almost bready. A bit heavy to drink, unless you favor stouts, but decent and filling. A good choice for to accompany a hearty meal or with strong cheeses."
"Pours a deep black in normal light, deep red with a back light. The head is a clay brown that quickly settles. Strong, raw hop aroma, coffee and chocolate. A slight hint of skunkiness when first poured, may be just that bottle. Deep chocolate and coffee flavor up front, malt sweetness in the middle, and a light, cleansing bite at the end. Some fruity esters come out after I get used to the initial flavors. Mouthfeel is full and chewey. Drinkability is nice for a beer with this much flavor."
"M&D - what can i say, a masterfully crafted porter, smooth, sweet, slightly bitter, all in one, easily the best porter of this relatively unexplored style (by me) i have ever had"
"I absolutely recommend this classic to anyone who's a fan of porters. It's also light enough to recommend to anyone who is trying their first one of this style. Definitely one of my ""all time favorite classics"" though."
"M -"
"Poured from a clear 355ml bottle into a glass. The beer is dark black with a bit of a ruby tint when held to the light. The head is dirty white with ok retenetion and some lacing. The smell is malty to me maybe slightly week I'm also getting maybe some hops or skunkiness. Taste is just like the smell mellow flavors blended well but again I feel that age or light may have gotten to this one it seems like it is missing something. Mouthfeel is perfect for a porter smooth and with a good level of carbonation. This is a sessionable beer well it would be if the price was a bit better per four pack."
"Fairly thin. A little more residual sweetness than I would care for in the style, but other than that it isn't bad. Far from the best english porter I've had, but far from the worst as well."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with a small off-white head. It smells like chocolate, roasted malt and some dark fruit. It tastes the same way to me, but in addition to the initial malty sweetness, there's a bitter coffee-like finish. The mouthfeel is light/medium, and it's a bit creamy and smooth. The drinkability is good, but not great. Overall it's a good beer, but I've had better porters."
"Verdict: a standard. A good beer, I would never hesitate to drink one in front of me, but you won't find my frige full of them."
"This is one sessionable porter. For the lovers of chocolate malts. This is one to drink as the weather starts to cool down in the pre winte rmonths."
"The SS Taddy porter poured dark black with a great foamy head and lacing. light aromas of roasted malt and tangy fruit were present and the taste was amazing- a pleasant refreshing dark chocolate coffee malt, light but flavorful. The backend was made up of dried fruits and a slight bitterness. Great body and cool on the tongue. An extremely sessionable porter and very well balanced brew."
"Great drinkabilty. Nice session beer."
"Mouthfeel was smooth. Body was thin to medium. A classic beer."
"My favorite porter."
"Drink-ability: One of the best porters out there. I really enjoyed this brew and highly recommend it."
"The pour into my Fuller's nonic (why didn't I use my Sam Smith glass !?) raises a shallow sub one-finger head that falls quickly to surface lacing and then to a glass ring. The head's hue is a light tan. The beer is black initially, but clearly a deep ruby when backlit. The nose is roasted, but also has a special earthy smell. There's also some intense caramel and light fruitiness floating about. The taste is bitter-sweet, nutty, and roasted, with only the barest hints of coffee floating about. Ok, some chocolate too, but I didn't notice at first. The earthiness here is probably from some very nice hopping. A bit of acid too, and some butteriness. The mouth is on the lighter side, and the carbonation is pretty high but fine and tingly. A very nice porter."
"Pours a near-black with a small head, but what is there is thick and foamy with a coffee-like appearance. The smell is delicious with coffee, chocolate, and smoky malts coming through. The smoked flavor is even stronger in the taste. More roasted malts come through in the aftertaste. Very nice. The mouthfeel is mild and syrupy with a nice balance. This may be the most drinkable porter I have had. A great choice for the winter or anytime for that matter."
"After reading an article in the NY Times on the comeback of Porter's, it was the right time of the season to make my return as well. Pouring into a glass a nice head with tight bubbles appeared. The smell was a rich smokey aroma which was very inviting. The first taste was smooth with a full flavored mouthfeel. It finished with the smokey,coffee aftertaste. The drinkablility was well rounded and made for relaxation after a long day."
"This is a very good porter. A sipper to be savored and enjoyed. An hour had passed and I was still enjoying the same long-lasting pint."
"D- This beer is awesome. Great session beer if you have money to spend."
"D - One of the best porters out there."
"I'm going to move this one to the top of my porter list. I love the feel and taste of this beer. Pricey but worth it."
"This is a very drinkable porter. Unfortunately, it is very drinkable because it kinda lacks flavor."
"Overall a bit offensive! I will probably give this another try sometime....maybe. Dont know if it was just the bottle or me?"
"That said, this is certainly not a bad beer. Better than many. But nothing I'd go out of my way for."
"Mouthfeel is creamy and pretty drinkable."
"Perfect pour into my Carlsberg imperial pint glass. Great two finger that is almost perfectly even with the lip of the glass. Creamy, tan, bread dough head amidst dark coffee hues. Good porter aromas hit the nostroil. Plenty of roasted and creamy vanilla like malts. Great passover to the mouth with more developed creaminess. More light brunt malt notes in the back of the throat as well. Very smooth palte. But lets you know you are packing on the calories."
"Drinkability: Easily could drink this stuff all night. Friggen good."
"Pours dark brown with red edges. A few fingers of very creamy medium-brown head. Very good lace retention. Deep toasted bread, nut, and chocolate malt aromas. Flavor conforms with the smell. Chewy chocolate malts up front with some bread dough, butterscotch, and nutty flavors in the center. Excellent drying burnt toast finish. Superb medium body with just the right balance of cream and carbonation."
"Didn't really stand out as drinkable, will get another bottle another day, this may be old or light struck"
"My bottle of Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter is 550ml with gold foil on the top. And it is clear, as are all of the Samuel Smith bottles. Pours a beautiful deep brown with a thick tan head with good retention and lacing. Unfortunately, the first thing I smell upon opening the bottle is skunkiness, like every other bottle of Sam Smith's I've ever had. By letting it sit for a while, I can get some roasted caramel flavors and some hops but I can't totally get the skunkiness out of my nose. Taste is roasted and nutty with some coffee and chocolate notes as well, and if I could keep the skunkiness out of my nose would be spectacular. Finish is smokey and dry. Slightly slick mouthfeel. Would be very drinkable if ever bottle that I ever purchased wasn't skunked. It's a great porter, but unless they switch to brown bottles or I can get it straight out of the case, I won't be buying it very often."
"Overall, this is basically what I expected coming into it. That's not to say it is mundane or anything like that. Samuel Smith just has a certain feel to the beers, and this fits in, while differentiating itself from its other styles. It is an easy drinking porter, and one to be savored. Price is my only limiting factor, but even at a high price, I'll still buy. Its that good."
"GET MY BUZZ ON- n"
"A taddy birthday indeed."
"D: It's a decent porter that I could sit and have a few of, but nothing to rave about."
"Drinkability: Nice, low ABV, easy drinking beer."
"Drinkability - Very drinkable!! I'm not finished with this one yet due to the fact that I only bought one and I want to savor the taste! This is an outstanding porter."
"D - Super drinkable at the right temp. Not palatable when ice cold or warm."
"Cheers!"
"I enjoyed it most paired with a few bites of dark chocolate."
"D - Definitely a classic. One of the benchmarks for English Porter. Excellent drinkability."
"Drinkability: Very high for me, i wish i had another bottle or two, this will be a great porter to share with my friend when he comes back from new york this fall."
"An outstanding Porter."
"Drinkability- Pretty drinkable as the coffee flavors are not too dark, and it doesn't sit too heavy. Complex flavors keep it interesting."
"A very substantial brew, Thick, yet smooth so it goes down really easy, low ABV %."
"This is one of the widely available staples that everyone should at least try."
"The body of this beer is a bit lighter than I expected from the assertively malty aroma. It is still rich and even a bit creamy though. Notes of concentrated malt intermingle with notes of chocolate, black coffee, toffee, and lots of rich, umami type notes. The umami type flavors almost lend a sort of saltiness to this brew, though not quite. This beer really does drink a lot richer than it's strength would suggest; a mini meal in a bottle, and I can remember back in my early beer drinking days, being shocked by the flavors packed into this brew. Even now the flavors are still quite jarring; still this is a tasty tipple and one I am happy to revisit again."
"Eric"
"Pours a deep, clear reddish-brown, with loads of ruby around the edges, and a three finger medium tan head that leasts well and leaves copious lacing. Smell is intense, fruity and sweet, with grapes and plum mixing nicely with toffee notes, and a touch of roasted bitterness as well. Taste is heavy on the coffee, but the fruit still comes through, as does a caramel and chocolate note in the finish. Mouthfeel is a bit flat and undercarbonated, but has good body, and drinkability is quite good. Very good, all things considered, but can't match Fuller's in my books."
"Notes: I think the Fuller's London Porter is more assertive, but this is still a tasty porter. Definitely let this beer warm, the flavors come thorugh a lot better."
"I really enjoyed this beer and will purchase it again althought it is a little on the pricey side. But it is a good treat."
"Drinkability is not very good."
"This beer has a medium mouthfeel with loads of roasted malt flavors with more carbonation then I would expect for a porter. Not a bad porter, but I don't agree with the price."
"Color is pitch black, yes that's the beer, the bottle is clear. Small and scummy, almond colored head. Smells sooo good, english characteristics of course, sweet and malty, grassy hops. Inviting. Tastes mild actually, good flavor, lightly roasted, sweet and caramelly to match, not at all harsh, with a lingering finish that is hop and malt balanced. Yet just slightly stale and not quite fresh tasting for some reason. It may in fact have been on the shelves a while. Mouthfeel is where this is lacking. Carbonation seems very artificial and a seperate part here like a soda, not in quantity but quality of its feel on the tounge, and it is also watery, which may be a factor. Overall this beer is the reason why I gave porters a chance and look foward to a good porter more than any other style. If it were priced better, I'd drink one a day. I'll stick with anchor for special drinking or something lighter for refreshment (which this in fact acomplishes well, surprisingly) but this is an excellent beer."
"Normally I would not characterize a porter as crisp but this one comes fairly close. Extremely drinkable with a very well rounded flavor. Surprisingly refreshing."
"D- easy drinking for the style a soild offering, can't wait to compare it to Fullers"
"This beer has a medium full mouthfeel that completely envelops the palate, but not so much as to affect drinkability. Roasted barley melds with hops to create a distinctive element of zest. Finishes with a dry, prickly bath of carbonation which is almost completely clean. One of my favorite porters from one of my favorite breweries."
"22 oz. bottle. Good creamy head and dark rich appearance, as you expect from a Porter. Aroma and flavor is chocolate and toffee, but subtly so. As good as this looked and tasted, I was disappointed in the mediocre finish, which was watery and slightly metallic, or I would have rated this higher."
"Lovely body: thick, but not lacking in carbonation. Very drinkable, esp. for desert or after dinner."
"A King among Porters. Perfect!"
"A very good english Porter. Drinkable and quite tasty"
"An all-around wonderful beer. What else can be said?"
"Pours a rich black with ruby highlights color. Huge tan head that holds strong at one inch with thick lacing on the glass. The smell is pronounced and very pleasant. Mostly malty but a hint of bitter chocolate as well. The taste is primarily malt with some bitterness. Very enjoyable taste with no ""chalky"" aftertaste or any other unpleasant flavor. The mouthfeel is a little thin (I may be comparing this to the Outmeal Stout which has an incredibly rich mouthfeel) but not watery. I enjoyed this beer and would consider it a good session beer or something to savor on my deck (where I had this one)."
"Cheers Mates! MK"
"Pours dark brown with a one finger tan colored head. Smell is coffee, dark chocolate and butterscotch. Taste is of roasted malts and butterscotch with notes of coffee rounding it out. Overall this is a great porter and another great brew from this brewery."
"With that being said, this beer poured beautifully into my mug from the classic ""pint and change"" bottle that Samuel Smith typically uses, maintains about a finger of frother head throughout, creates great rings down the class... the aromas were fairly complex, with hints of different types of nuts and at points, chocolate and coffee. But the taste is where this porter shines. By far one of the best porters I've had, this really combines all the different facets of a porter to make one of the best porters around. Surprisingly carbonated with a GREAT drinkability (in comparision with other porters), if you're a big fan of the Porter, this is the beer for you. Very tasty!"
"This porter poured a dark brown with a small, quickly dissipating head. The smell had dark roasted malt aromas as well as a slight coffee scent. The taste was full of roasted malt flavor with a medium hop profile and bitterness. The taste was complex with a number of other flavors present, although I couldn't put my finger on them. The mouthfeel was medium/thick with a medium/low carbonation. The felt like I could drink these on a regular basis as I enjoyed it thoroughly. This is an excellent porter and I highly recommend it."
"Not the experience I was hoping for, this being ""The Famous Taddy Porter"" and all, but far from undrinkable/unenjoyable."
"Not as bitter as most American porters but not as rich and flavorful as Fuller's porter. An above-average porter that would be a good session beer."
"D- Very nice complexity with good flavors. The complexity of the malt really comes through in the smell and it would be nice to see all of the complexity make it to the taste."
"I think this beer would be a great session beer. It is not too harsh flavor wise. Also, it is relatively low in alcohol. I could drink a few of these."
"Poured an opaque, black color with a cream colored head that was both frothy and sticky. A bit of lacing was left behind in my pint glass. The texture appears thick with a somewhat murky presence that is enticing. Aromas of plums, dates, alcohol, roasted sugar, and old raisins seemed to come out. The taste was dominated by malt & fruit derived sweetness. Smoked and burnt wood flavors add depth to the beer, but also seem out-of-place in that they don't work with the other flavors. A bitter finish is quite enjoyable. An interesting brew with unique flavors and a nice texture, but not all of the elements I look for in a good porter are there."
"D: Very drinkable. I would suggest this brew to anyone who wants to start exploring the world of porters. It's sweetier then their American counter-parts."
"Overall a nice, tasty beer that one could be happy to drink a bunch of with friends."
"Drinkability: A good porter (on par with Edmund Fitzgerald--my favorite). Tartness implies a dry character and masks the body a bit. Very drinkable, and could pass as a session porter."
"This brew pours an almost opaque black color. The head is massive, creamy, and brown. Lacing is thorough and lasts until the beer is finished. The aroma is of chocolate, cream, toffee and has a touch of the famous Samuel Smith's house aroma. The taste, however, is rather bland for a porter. There is some toffee and burnt malt flavors that are nice, but nothing really stands out and makes things interesting. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with quite a bit of carbonation. Overall, this is a decent porter. At 5% ABV it could make for a very sessionable beer if it had something flavor wise to entertain. With that said, I would choose Summit Great Northern Porter, Bell's Porter, or Bully! Porter, all between 4.9% and 5.25% ABV, as my session porter of choice over The Famous Taddy Porter any day of the week."
"This is excellent. Loved the creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is very mild. The lower ABV makes this a definite session beer."
"The Famous Taddy Porter was one of Sam Smith's beers that I intended to try first - As a matter of fact, it could very well have been one of the first beers that led me into the craft brew world, but I picked up the Oatmeal Stout instead. I've gone through a lot of other beers in their lineup before getting to this one, and it's a tasty English-style porter."
"Cheers2Beers"
"Drinkability & Notes: Could make a great session porter. Not too filling for a heavy beer, and a low level of alcohol. Went great with Sausalito cookies from Pepperidge Farms."
"Deep dark brown, if you didn't know better it looks like a brown bottle, not clear bottle with brown contents. Brown tinged head that forms a thin cap and leaves thin lace. Lots of smells, faint but there including coffee, cocoa, and some smoke. Full flavored with blend of roasted coffee and dark chocolate, some burnt sugar-like taste. Overall, a nice porter-type taste. Sweet taste balanced by a bitter finish. Creamy smooth mouth feel, low carbonation. Expensive, but worth the treat now and again."
"A pleasure to drink and a great beer to break up the daily, or shall I say weekly style of preferance. Damn solid Porter...cheers!"
"Pours black with deep garnet highlights and excellent clarity. 3+ fingers of dark-cream colored dense foam will retain very well but leave minimal lacing. Roasted barley and black patent nose, background coffee and fuggles hops. The taste is not as sweet as you would expect, dominant burnt/roasted barley flavor leans the flavor towards the bitter end. The aftertaste is of smoked malt, black patent and drying english hops. The uncommon charred flavor seems off-balance especially for the english version of porter and tastes more like a milk/sweet stout! Fine carbonation in a medium body breaks up the rich burnt taste and the finish is mostly clean. The bitterness fades quickly and there is no residual sweetness so it manages a high drinkability."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Poured with a nice thick head of dark tan color. Aroma was clean with a hint of dark roasted malts. Flavor was rich, thicker than expected in the mouth. Dark chocolate with a fruity sweetness to balance a dark bitterness. The sweetness stays on the tip of your tongue long after the swallow. A mild alcohol in the back of the throat, but not overpowering. The sweetness lingers almost too long. A pleasant porter experience for sure, but I prefer the Meantime London Porter over this one."
"Overall: Has some of the elements similar to the house style for Sam Smith beers. Some unattainable characteristics in both the smell and taste. Really does have some spicy steak blood elements without too much of the metallic aspects. Very savory."
"Overall: A good porter; recommended."
"This porter poured out a dark brown/black with a large yet quickly dissappearing tan head.The smell was of coffee as well as in the taste.The body, in my opinion was very light.The taste was a little bland,almost metallic and I guess I was expecting more from this.Maybe I will have to go back to this one in the future and try again."
"Why don't I drink this beer more? Simply amazing, one of the most flavorful and drinkable porters out there. I can only imagine what this beer tastes like fresh, or not in a clear bottle, or... dare I say... on cask? Amazing beer."
"This certainly doesn't live up to the name... especially since it has ""Famous"" in it."
"This beer looks and smells great first off. really dark black with a brown head looks creamy. the smell is sweet and rich, could smell it as soon as I cracked the cap a little. the taste is great a light roasted malt flavor a bit grainy good though, not to much on the mouthful not to strong but it is smooth over all. good drinkablity on this beer I would like to try more like it."
"Overall a good beer. Very enjoyable, but for the money you could get the same quality taste for cheaper. One i would never turn down, but hard to drop the money on this import."
"D - Goes down easy, low alcohol. A person could drink more than a few of these. I was going to consign this to my bottle collection and never return to it but it really does improve as it warms. Do yourself a favor and dont drink this cold."
"This was an unusual mixture that had to grow on me after several samplings. Mouthfeel, on the other hand, was superb. A very smooth porter, with a substantial body, and a somewhat drying effect at the back of the palate. Quite drinkable, but more for an occasion of relaxation and sipping than a session drink."
"D - Well, I am going to be able to finish this despite the taste and mouthfeel. That says a lot actually. The parching nature makes sessioning this one difficult at best. The beer is too foul for foods. I think I will seek out the oatmeal stout and leave the ""famous"" taddy porter to it's notoriety."
"The beer pours a dark almost opaque black with a thick frothy tan head that holds well and laces well the whole way down the glass. The beer smells of faint roasted and chocolate malts. The flavor of the beer is where its strength really lies. The beer mixes roasted nutty malts (which I believe are hazlenuts) with chocolate malts. The beer is not too sweet though because it is balances nicely with some welcome bitterness. There is a fantastic thickness balanced nicely with some great carbonation. Overall this is a very drinkable beer and the best of the Samuel Smith Beers I have had so far."
"Could pound a few more."
"The nose is interesting, if not overly appealing to me. There are some smoky notes in there -- not so much as your average smoked porter, but a bit. The smoky flavor carries over in the brew itself, but on the palate it adopts more of a smoke-house, smoked meat kind of flavor, which I don't care for personally. A touch of sourness makes this a very complex brew, although it doesn't have the easy drinkability of the stouts."
"Very opaque , very nice black color with dark brown to red edges. Head is about an inch and dissipates quickly. Very pleasant roasty smells of chocolate , coffee, and barley. Mmmm! What a porter! Taste is indeed complex and intense. Malty at first , then some choclate and coffee notes , with a tangy- roasty finish. Full bodied mouthfeel that leaves dark fruity and mildly smokey flavors on the tongue. This porter is what a porter should be. I will be drinking many more of these tasty beers from Tadcaster!"
"This pours a jet black with a small tan head that dissapears quickly.The smell has faint hints of coffee,but it is pretty weak.The taste is a rich creamy mouthful.There are coffee and chocolate flavors in this beer.The m/f is heavy with a well balanced flavor.The mixture of flavors and the rich creamyness make this a real treat.This is one porter not to miss."
"Slightly expensive, but worth every penny. I really like this one allot. Sam Smith has hit a homerun again!"
" This is one of the best porters I've ever had. It's well balanced but also thick and filling. Porter isn't for everyone but this should appeal to the vast majority of porter drinkers."
"D: Nothing about this beer was very appealing to me. It's very drinkable in the sense that you could chug a bunch of these quickly, but that's not usually how I prefer to drink my beverages."
"This is what a porter should taste like. Simple, pure, clean, and full of flavor. A solid dose of dark malts and a hint of roasted barley and chocolate in both aroma and flaovr. Mild fermentation sourness adds a complex layer in the same way that milk stouts do. A medium body with flavors more commonly found in heavy beers. Gives a creamy coat to the whole mouth with a deep chocolate layer without becomming thick or sugary sweet. Finishes very clean with a light roasted grain bitterness. Terriffic from sip to finish."
"Cheers!"
"Not much of a head on this one, however it does exhibit lacing similar to a finely carbonated Belgian Ale. Smell of toasted barley with coffee overtones, a hint of licorice. Taste is smooth with a bit of smokiness from the barley and lots of chocolate and coffee notes. Moderate mouthfeel with a taste that lingers on the palate. Deep reddish brown hue. Quite nice on a cold winters eve, and a nice alternative to an American style porter."
"Drinks down just fine, not much to it really, but is clean and seemingly well made, just a good tad on the empty side."
"This is a very easy to drink beer. This is a good go to old faithful porter."
"Bottle: Poured a deep black color porter with a medium dark head with average retention. Aroma of chocolate and roasted malt is dominating. Taste is also dominated by some sweet dark chocolate with a slightly bitter finish. Body is average and carbonation is good. Seems to represent the standard for English Porter."
"Overall - An exceptional porter, one of my favourites. Highly recommended !!"
"poured from a 12oz bottle into my samuel smith nonic pint glass. A dark caramel brown with a small 1in head that dissolves rather quickly a little too fast for my liking. you immediatley smell the malt along with some mild hops and after that a little bit of a fruit kick. very pleasing. the taste at first is somewhat sweet with just a little bit of bitterness from the hops. a very nice smooth mouthfeel and a high drinkability because of the low alcohol content."
"Silky smooth mouth with low levels of carbonation. Easy drinking and very enjoyable beer here!"
"Pours a true black, you may be able to coax i ruby hint out of it in the light but you'd have to try hard. beefy tan head which fades leaving light lacing . smell is the only real downpoint here as it has some light coffee notes but nothing that really wets the palate. however, this beer is for drinking and what a wonderful drinking beer it is. silky chocalate milk feel with just a tiny bit of zesty sparkle as you swallow which compliments the smoothness perfectly. Mouthfeel is thick and wholesome, for a heavy beer this sure goes down fast. A benchmark with which to judge other porters."
"D: Quite good."
"Drinkability: First real cold night here in a long while (about 16 degrees F with a wind chill in the single digits), this beer just seems perfect for the weather. This is an easy to drink beer, not over-the-top with blow you away hops (but is a bit to the malty side). Would I want another? You bet. Could I drink these all night? Probably not, just too filling, but then again being responsible and drinking in moderation is part of Beer Advocacy is it not? Respect Beer, especially this beer, highly recommended must try."
"This is a very rich and flavorful porter that fairly easy to drink due to the slight but persistent carbonation. I was done after one bottle, but I could see myself having another had I not had this right after a meal. A very nice porter and IMO one of the best!"
"D: The odd plastic taste is off-putting and while the smell is fantastic, the taste and mouthfeel are little more than average. This is a brew I might be interested in re-visiting sometime, but until then it won't be a staple."
"Has a nice bitterness that makes this beer awesome on the palate and highly drinkable. Once again Sam smith proves why they are a top 5 brewery in my opinion."
"The beer poured a very dark brown with a little more than a finger of tan head that left fine lacing down the glass. The beer's aroma had hints of coffee, chocalate and some fruitiness as well. The flavor was off the charts, and a true treat. Taddy Porter's flavor fit it's ominous, dark color, with plenty of roasted malt flavor along some chocalate. The beer finished a smokey, caramel flavor that road through the end of each sip. This is a medium bodied brew that is super drinkable, if only a little cheaper of available in greater quantites - at least here in my area. A true treat, and I imagine something of a classic."
"Pours a very dark reddish brown with a very small, creamy, light tan head. Smells of very deep, rich, roasted chocolate malt, oatmeal cookie, light coffee, earthy, grassy and lightly herbal with a little cherry and oak. Dear god this tastes good! Huge toasted malts giving a hefty wallop of bittersweet chocolate, followed then by toffee, oak and molasses. It really turns sweet as it heads toward the finish. The finish is quite long, and while the big malt flavor linger to the end theyre accompanied by a light citrus bitterness that add balance, crispness and closure. This porter is full-bodied and slightly watery with very low carbonation. Wow, was this a great beer. Forget the desert, just give me a bottle of this after dinner. Sure this beer is a bit pricey, but Ill be getting a bottle of this from time to time for sure."
"A truly amazing porter, definitely a beer to be savored."
"A very, very good beer!"
"Drinkability is huge. I'm buying 2 or 3 at a time from now on."
"Full bodied and rich throughout, its a darn same its on the expensive side  it would make a good session brew if better priced."
"Drinkability: Judging from the other ratings, I was inclined to mark my scores up a notch but I wouldn't be honest to this bottle if I did that; worth taking another try in the future, I was put off by some of the sour elements in this sample"
"This was a disappointing brew. I am hoping I just got a bad one. I have heard a lot of good things about Sammy Smith's so I guess I was expecting something more."
"Maybe not for everybody, but for those who like a rich malt flavor, this is definitely recommended."
"The alcohol flavors are a bit too strong for me to have too many of these. Nevertheless, I find the beer to be very enjoyable... just in moderation."
"This is the first English porter I've tried, and I can't say I was terribly impressed. The bottle may have been off a bit, as there was a decidedly sour aftertaste that may not be typical. All in all not a terrible beer; I wouldn't decline it if free, but can find better brews for $3. I would like to try it on tap to see if the sour flavor remains or if I simply had bad luck."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Boy, I hope I get the chance to taste this fresh one day  I think Id have a much higher opinion of it. As it is, Im disappointed."
"Opinion: I really like this beer, and it stands out among the rest. There is a much smoother and richer flavor here as compared to just about any other Porter. The British malts do a lot for this style, and the processes at Sam Smiths make this a really smooth and almost creamy tasting beer. I would definitely recommend it."
"A nice porter. No suprises but a solid porter for sure."
"Notes: Sole US distributor - Merchant du Vin"
"Overall a very solid porter. Really good and I want some more."
"Pours a dark garnet red, almost opaque but light can pass through. Nice tan head that disappears after a few minutes leaving nary a coating. Smell is subdued, malty, a little fruity maybe. Taste is also less robust than I would have imagined - malty up front, not so much in the roasted coffee or dark chocolate I would expect from a ""porter", more on the milky sweet side, and finishing with apple skins and cider. Not much of a hop presence, but enough to balance and prevent it from being too sweet. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, if not a little on the thin side, but drinkability is way up there - definitely session material. Didn't blow me away, but an interesting take on the porter style, and solid all around."
"Pours a dark, dark black with a coca-cola-esque head. Smells distinctly of chocolate and brown sugar, but there is also a hint of mint and apricot. EXTREMELY sweet to taste, at first a bland chocolate flavor and hops, but then the taste of a strong, creamy chocolate erupts onto the palate. It is quite thick (in a good way) and damn drinkable, but only in small quantities, as this really fills you up."
"There is a redeeming quality to this beer, in my eyes though, and it lies in the drinkability. As you progress through a pint, the beer becomes more drinkable, and the sweetness and bitterness balance, much like a perfectly made cup of coffee. I would recommend this on a late fall night, to anyone who remotely likes English ale or hanging out in a pub- but if you do- this is probably already one of your favorites."
"Pours a deep, dark mahogany brown, about as dark brown as you can get before becoming black. You won't know the bottle's clear until you pour it. Remarkable foamy tan head that lasts a good long while. This beer looks so good I almost feel bad for drinking it. Great roasty aroma of coffee and dark chocolate. The flavor has all that, with the roasted malt being full but not burnt or astringent. Finishes with a quick sweetness followed by a lasting black coffee bitterness. Really wonderful drinking, and worth the price. This is one beer that fully lives up to its hype and history."
"12 oz. with no freshness date - served slightly chilled. Pours a deep dark brown with ruby highlights and a very thin fizzy tan head that doesn't leave much lacing. Sour apples, dark fruits, chocolate and roasted malts are in the nose. Very pleasant. It is fairly bitter on the palate from both the hops and roasted malts, and there are notes of apples, raisins, coffee, chocolate, anise, dark fruits, green hops and a malty sweetness. The body is very smooth with medium carbonation and it coats the mouth well. Another good one from Sammy Smith's."
"Beer is good. Happy world beering."
"I have had some relative bombs from Samuel Smith, but this is one afforded the label a parachute."
"Easy drinking and worth a try."
"I could drink this brew endlessly. It's nice that you can find it in both bombers and 4-packs."
"Overall a nice drink. Not my favorite style of beer, but this is currently my favorite of the category."
"Clear, dark chestnut, nearly opaque. Creamy, light tan head. Very chocolatey aroma, roasted coffee and toffee as well. Roasted malts are the dominant flavour, but there's a bit of hop presence along with some acidity. Dried fruit shows up at the midpoint and carries through to the end, where bitterness becomes more apparent as well. Creamy, smooth texture due in part to medium body and light carbonation. Also a bit buttery on the palate. Overall, a great porter. I didn't realize that this was the target I was shooting for in brewing my own porter all these years!"
"A deep chestnut color with ruby highlights. Puffy off white cap, laces the glass. Moderate carbonation. Light nose: sweet apple and cocoa mingle over light grass tones. Malty and smooth, mocha-like with pear or plum notes. Finishes wetwith a drying from the hop bittering....one fine porter...a true proter and probably one of the worlds best."
"The color was a deep and rich brown. There was a small head that hung around for a few seconds, perfect. The amount of carbonation was perfect as well. But the taste, clearly the best balance of hops and malt dominance. As a result mouthfeel is very good and it makes you want to savor every sip. I wanted more after my 2 pint+ bottles but the store is just too far away."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle with a gold foil top, the taddy porter looks great in a glass. Deep brown, like black coffee. A pillowy tan head swelling on top leaving some lacing on the glass. Malts come through as dark as you take in the wonderful smell, as does some toffee or caramel. that toffee/caramel smell come through at first in the taste, continuing with some earthy warmth, and ending with a bit of shortly lingering hops. Comfortable mouthfeel, easy to have more than one. And the easy drinkability of this beer will make you want to have another."
"Pours a thick, opaque dark brown, with a creamy, fluffy tan head. Smooth, mellow and full of dark, roasty, coffee flavours. Delicious aroma of rich toffee, dark malt and sweetness. Some metallic flavour, but almost not noticeable. Some bitterness from the hops. Finishes dry. Excellent session beer."
"Since Ive rediscovered the world of beers I have to say this beer isnt as good as I remember. I do remember describing it the same way back then, I just think there are so many better beers. But this beer will always have fond memories for me."
"I poured this beer with notebook at the ready to study what is one of my favorites. Understandably, I consider it to be very drinkable, but was almost surprised that my glass was nearly empty before I had finished making notes. So it was a given that I poured the second one. I would consider this a good beer to drink all night, not too heavy, with just enough body to slow you down to enjoy it."
"Drinkability: As good as I have had in this style. Low abv lends itself to session drinking in the winter. Coupled with great looks and flavor, I'll take it out any time of the year."
"Dark brown with ruby highlights. Big cakey light brown head with good retention. Smells rich with coffee, chocolate, and a hint of molasses. The mouth feel is rich with a slight amount of carbonation. Taste is dominated by coffee and bitter-sweet chocolate. Some fruity hop and butterscotch flavor can be detected as well. The fruit twang last a little in the aftertaste. A damn good Porter!"
"Beautiful looking beer, everything a porter should look like. Nice dark brown, nearly black body with a big fluffy tan head. Smells of chocolate and roasted malt, slightly fruity and smoky. Taste is smooth and full. Smoke and dark fruit flavors, chocolate and a slight porter-acidity. Vanilla flavors on the conclusion. What a great porter, I can;'t believe it has taken me this long to try it. Defintely one of the best porter's I have tried."
"Dark, muddy brown body with dark amber edges in the light. Nice, big, light brown head that laces well. Smells of semi-sweet chocolate, brandy, caramel syrup, underlaid by soft roasted notes. Light chocolate to cola sweetness up front. Some marshmallows, and then roasted coffee bitterness sneaks in. Finish is sweetish, with cocoa powder and a background bitterness. Medium bodied, with a slightly syrupy finish. Pretty good."
"The body is on the light side of medium, with a smooth creamy body accentuated by moderate corbonation. It went fantastically well with the tiramisu cheesecake we had for dessert. Overall, a tastey porter, but not as rich as Fullers or Anchor."
"Santé"
"A real good one. I sometimes overlook Sammy Smith because it seems to be around all the time, but I've recently been enjoying their beers. Appears to be ""pitch brown," my new term for almost black, or very dark brown and opaque. Can't really see any light through this one. Big thick foamy head that lasts. Taste is well balanced for a porter. Roasted malts up front, and a burnt bitterness and coffee bean hint that is really nice. Part of the bitterness might be the hops, of which there are plenty, for a porter. Nice and spicy profile. Mouthfeel isn't quite as creamy as the stouts, but that's kind of a nice quality for a porter. Nice, solid, drinkable, tasty brew."
"Large clear bottle, no freshness dating noted. Pours a very dark shade of brown, minimal light getting thru, head is tan and quickly turns to a film. Moderate lacing left behind on the glass. Nice smokey nose, smooth bodied classic porter. Notes of burnt malt, minerals, slate, vanilla.More smoke and burnt raisins. Yummy and refreshing, fine stuff. Worth getting to know"
"This beer is rough where it should be. Not rough like a bad neighborhood in Detriot, rough like a wooden rollercoaster. A fun, carefully designed kind of roughness."
"Best porter I've had? Could be close. It certainly was worth revisiting this beer."
"A treat, this one. Toasty and chocolatey, nicely balanced and complete."
"In short, this is good."
"Medium but very long-lasting head over a pitch black body; pours a matte black and is always completely opaque. Smell is a mix of coffee and chocolate; subdued but distinguishable. Starts thin and flat but settles on the tongue velvety smooth and full-bodied - although lacking a particularly distinct flavor. Egresses to the stomach VERY sour with a heavy weight to the aftertaste."
"Reflection: After reading some of the other reviews on this beer I have to assume that I tried a bad one. Will review again."
"Off-white cover tops a dark brown hue. Aroma is of growing distaste. Lactic soy beans soaked in yogurt a bit too long. Sweet chocolate and roasted bread fights the palate dominance over with a strong anise component. Sweet vanilla is barely mellowed by an unpleasant vegetal touch. At the same time, the palate is pretty light and proposes dull mellow carbonation. A bit disappointing compared to their stouts.."
"update: i had one of these last night and it was terriffic. much better thn the previous sample. a definite classic porter."
"Poured perfect with almost 2 fingers of head and stood for quite a long time. Plenty of carbonation can be seen and this beer produced some of the best lacing I've seen in a porter. Very malty aroma with hints of toffee and molasses. Astrigent flavor that is strong with an unexpected strong bitter finish. Mouthfeel was a little thin, but favorable since beer had strong aftertaste. I expected much more from the taste after taking in the aromas and witnessing this beer dance."
"Quite drinkable, but the astringency and fruitiness could get annoying."
"This beer is very similar to some of the well-known stouts out there, such as Young's Double Chocolate and Mackeson's. It has a bit more astringent flavor, however, and really assaults your taste buds. If you are into strong dark beers this one is worth a shot. I find it a nice balance between a dry irish stout and a sweet milk stout."
"Deep,deep burgundy color. Nice reddish highlights when held to the light. Small tan head atop. Good,somewhat sweet malt aroma. Slight roasted/coffee notes. Nice roasted flavor-very well balanced with the sweetness of the malt. Slight hop bitterness. Good body for style-some of the British porters can be a bit thin. An extremely drinkable beer-definately one to measure other porters against."
"A very very dark brown beer with some mahogony highlights when held up to a light. Has a creamy brown head that leaves some lace. There is a sweet malty aroma with some molasses in the background. A good strong roasted malt bitterness at the start and some toffee and coffee notes on the finish."
"Poured black with a bubbly tan head that quickly dissipated. Smelled of alcohol and roasted malt, with some chocolate and a hint of coffee in there. The taste was a good blent of malts. Good roasted and chocolate flavor. There might be some nut and coffee in there too. Goes down very creamy and smooth, with a pleasant dry roasted aftertaste. The overall taste is a little thin, but this adds to its drinkability. However, this brew accomplishes a very good taste without being too heavy, lending to its drinkability."
"Poured black as night good head that diminished fairly quickly, but left a good collar all the way through, smell was complex, coffee predominant, with chocolate notes, taste was opposite of smell, chocolate predominant with coffee notes, some alcohol presence also, reminded me a bit of those chocolate covered cherries, with the liquour in them, excellent! mouthfeel was fairly light and crisp,Drinkability is Fucking BRILLIANT! excellent stuff! That I will have again, and again, and again, etc.. highly recomennded!"
"A wonderful English porter that I always enjoy the most in the cooler months. It's subtle and complex, which makes it a world class ale. Well worth the $10 / 4-pack."
"This beer pours a nice dark brown color with a 2 finger head that falls to a finger over top of the beer. The nose is nore nutty than chocolate or coffee, maybe a little molasses sweetness as well. The flavor is nice, starting sweet, moving to a more roasted nut, slightly chocolate tone. The beer is also a bit dry on the finish. I taste a tad bit of oxidation as well. The feel is moderate, and as I said, dry on the finish. Overall a nice brew. Sam Smith's usually keeps things true."
"A good porter all around. I think it goes well with just about any meal, and is very refreshing."
"Taddy Porter is dark, dark brown with a good-sized, creamy head. Pretty good lacings around the inside of my pint glass. The aroma here is the best thing about this beer; strong, rich chocolate smells bombard my nose. Taste is great too. Rich chocolate flavors control my palate, a light coffee taste is noticed in the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy which complements the taste nicely. This is great, I'm wondering if it'd be even better without the clear glass bottle."
"First of all the damn gold leaf that covers the cap needs to go,,its a real pain in the ass. Pours out a nice black with a one finger tan head,,looks creamy.Smells just ok,a licorice smell{im not big on licorice}.Wow bitter taste as i first sip.Has a smoky taste,light on the licorice,bitter lasting taste.Has a nice mouthfeel not too thick,not too thin.Just an ok beer ,no freshness date so i dont know how old this is.I had high hopes for this beer and was let down."
"Overall: A truly magnificent and drinkable porter. Yet again the Samuel Smith brewery has impressed me. The dark appearance of this porter makes you think that it will be a challenge to drink more than a couple but it is quite light and goes down very easy, due to the excellent balance of flavours."
"The taste is quite the same chocolate with hints of coffee. Fruity tastes as well with a nice dry like finish."
"This beer pours a very dark brown with a small tan head that stays to cover the beer, but doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is of dark malts and coffee mostly. The flavor is chocolate and coffee with a sweetness of fruits. Smooth and slightly creamy. Could be a little thicker in the mouthfeel."
"Damn fine beer, pours a dark black with ruby streaks, the mocha tan head is fabulous. The smell is strong of cappucino and dark fire roasted chocolate, a nice fluffy marshmellow with just a slight hint of pine hops. The taste is great, the chocolate and coffee flavors compliment the roasted toffee and marshmellows, hints of roasted nuts linger. Very nice."
"I think this was the first porter I ever tried, and it's the standard I set for porters. Several years ago, it was fairly common to find light-struck bottles, but most Sam Smith products seem to move off the shelves a lot quicker these days."
"This has got to be one of my favorite porters. Pours a dark dark brown that is really closer to black. Nice brownish tan head that becomes thin but never really goes away. Smell is of darkly roasted coffee. The taste is bittersweet cocoa and coffee and perhaps a not so sweet fruit although I can't seem to put my finger on it. The mouthfell is great. Very smooth and creamy without feeling thick or sticky. The drinkability is good. You could defintely drink quite a few of these. Very tasty, not too high in alcohol and very smooth."
"Finally getting around to reviewing this. The Sam's (Smith and Adams) were basically my introduction to the world of craft brews. I first had the Taddy on my 21st birthday and have revisited it several times since. Well onto the review. Pours a super deep brown chocolatey color with a small off white head that has good retention. Heavy notes of nut, chocolate, and coffee blend excellently. Taste is super roasty. Chocolate followed by a slight roasted malt bitterness. Pleasant. Mouthfeel was a little thinner than I would've liked but overall this is a great beer and a cornerstone of my growing appreciation for beer."
"Pours out a near black with some crimson highlights. Big tan head that rose and fell. Good roasty character to it. Cookie dough sweet notes with some vanilla and cocoa, figgy pudding and grapey aromas, too. Very easy to drink. Not too overpowering with its maltiness, just about enough to give at rich smoothness."
"Final Thought: This is a step down from the other 4 Sammy Smith beers I've had. Despite that, It's still a solid beer."
"Dark, dark brown. Almost black. Kind of a brown head, creamy looking. Smells a little like chocolate and caramel candy. The flavor is a little chocolate, a little like Starbucks burnt coffee. The feel on the mouth is a bit thin, and a bit slick and creamy smooth. Some hop bitterness results. All in all, a pretty good porter I have to say, especially considering that its in a clear bottle."
"A great drinking beer. Easy to quaff all day and at just 5%, no problems downing several 550ml bottles."
"Pours with an anvil of head; a solid mass of sandy, khaki foam with milkshake thickness that can literally be scooped and shaped with a finger. Awesome. Each sip leaves a chunky stratum of lace. Beer is a sheen of mahogany blackness with merlot-colored highlights. Luxurious aromas of fudgy chocolate brownies, heady dark caramel creams, chocolate chip cheesecake, and puff pastries flaking apart in drawn butter are interwoven by vinous, sweet sherry tones in a dank, moist, and cakey nosefeel. Big sweet tastes of brown sugar-tinged molasses roll into the midpalate, developing body of dark chocolate and huge crystals of toffee and butter. Second half of the palate rounds out into bitter almonds, pipe tobacco, and a finish of old, dry leather. A slight acidity at the sides of the mouth is the only thing keeping this from being a ""5."" It's that close. Lightly dextrinous mouthfeel as of melted chocolate bars arcs across the tongue in a parabola of sweet, soft and bitter. Drinkable? I mean, come on... Less affable but more distinguished than its cousin from Fuller's, these are easily locked in a tie for the best Porters I have ever tasted. Just gorgeous."
"A straightforward and undertstated real and earthy porter. Molasses, bit of fig, smooth creamy roast and chocolate bitter but smooth aftertaste. Lingering roast and vanilla aroma and taste of the powders. Some wood smokiness. Thanks Irondjinn for the sample."
"Overall: Unlike any porter I've tried and by far the best. Very good, smooth flavor. Already a classic in my book."
"Overall Impression: Sigh; once again, Im just not a porter fan. This is a beer of obvious craftsmanship, and it hits all the marks one could look for in a porter. If this is your style, this is your beer. If you havent had many porters, you owe yourself a good calibration with this one. If you are like me, and just dont care for porters, try an Alaskan Smoked Porter if you are fortunate enough to see one, and this one just to be sure."
"A truly exceptional beer."
"Just a side note: Why do really good breweries like Sam Smith's, Wychwood and Marston's use clear bottles? Im sure it affects the quality of their products to some extent."
"550ml gold foil topped clear bottle sans freshness dating. Pours a very dark ruby-tinged blackness with a voluminous tan head that persists forever and leaves lace sheets on the glass. Aromas are very muted and tough to pick out, even when warmed to near room temperature. Whiffs of chocolate, caramel, vanilla?, and even some smoked dark fruit are noted. Flavor is not a robust as I'd expected. Perhaps I am unfairly judging this style (the first ""English Porter"" I've sampled), but it just didn't strike me as that tasty. There's the usual suspects of choclate, some cocoa powder, a dash of bittering hops, and some caramel, but nothing astounding. Mouthfeel was on the thinner side as well. Drinkable, but not like other porters I've had."
"How can beer like this come from a clear bottle and be great all of the time? This poured a deep brown, almost black with just slight ruby highlights. Nice tan head that left a fair amount of lace. Smells are chocolate, maybe with a slight hint of licorice. Taste is a nice roasty maly, with some buttery flavors. Fairly dry at the end with minimal bitterness. Slights hints of coffee. Medium body, with nearly creamy mouthfeel. This beer is so very easy to drink. What a classic. It had been a while since I had this. It will not be nearly as long before I have it again."
"As usual for Samuel Smiths, this is one expensive 4 pack. However, this beer is a treat. I shared this with a friend many years ago for the first time and as I grow a greater appeciation for this beer the more I have it. Excellent beer."
"What a jewel!"
"A very good porter, not quite up there with the baltics like sinebyrchoff"
"Other than the price this is one very drinkable beer. Should go well with pork tenderloin and ribeye."
"Mouthfeel is extremely smooth and creamy, and with a very chewy hoppiness lasting in the mouth. A very good beer."
"A damn good porter and a fantastic beer."
"Drinkability/Overall: at 5%ABV and great taste and texture, this is a very drinkable brew. Very good."
"i dont know what everyone else is drinking these days, but for me right now, this is one of the premier beers in my rotation. sammy smiths only come into my solar system on rare occasions, and while its here, im drinking effusively from that fountain. and the taddy porter is one thats demanded my respect and drinking time."
"Pours a jet black/brown with a tan-brown head that begins at about 1"" and then settles somewhat. Nice head retention for this beer type. Aroma- roasty malty, and slightly smoky. A little chocolate. Flavor is not as strong as you would think by looking at it. Nice and malty with strong reminders of sweet German black bread. Aroma profiles also follow through into the flavor. Mouthfeel is thin, drinkability is very good."
"This is a good enough beer for a session, and isn't too strong so I'd say it's decently drinkable. I'll have it now and again even though it isn't my favorite porter."
"This is a well-made and complex porter, but I can't take the bitterness at the end. I ""get"" this beer, but it's not for me."
"Big, tan, noisy, active head collapses doughily. Black beer with garnet highlights. One or two spots of lacing. Toffee molasses in the tangy, sweet, creamy nose and front. Sweet, creamy molasses in the light middle. Finishes dry, sourish with a little coffee and nice bitterness. Coffee aftertaste. This is a nice, light porter. Very good."
"The Famous Taddy Porter deserves its fame. It's classic and it's damn good. Attractive appearance, subdued nose, delicious flavor, medium body, highly drinkable. Sounds like a winner to me."
"Exceedingly drinkable brew, tasty with no harshness, and a moderate alcohol content."
"notes: my first porter even though I love stouts, I liked it quite a bit"
"D&N: A nice intro to the world of Porters. Max @ D's Hot Dogs recommended this one. I'm glad I listened to him. Tasty, complex, and a really nice beer."
"pours out extremely dark, almost black. nice red tint when held to the light. decent off white head, looks tastey. aromas are rich, coffee and toffee, dark malt...dark chocolate, light hopping. nice. smooth in the mouth, has good body, a hefty brew but not overly so. flavors are much like the nose with a def. semi sweet/dark chocolate flavor, some sweeter toffee like notes come in as well. a small but balanced hop bitterness seems to even things out and it finishes with a light coffee aftertaste. pretty damn drinkable, there are better porters out there IMO, but this is still a top notch brew that deserves the respect it seems to get. high five sammy smith."
"Finish is warm with dark fruits. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy, like a good porter should be, and the drinkability is great."
"One of the best porters I've had. Lives up to it's reputation"
"Let's face it, it's a legend, and it is damned good. That said, it's not tremendous, but still, as a long-time standard, it is a classic. It has the rich earthy elements you want in a porter, in a nice balance. Strong across the board, it's just what you expect, and drinking another is easy, enjoyable, and very likely. It's maybe not as big as many of its American brethren, but it is faithful to the style and it goes down smooth. It's a trusty beer to turn to when you want to get down to basics."
"Maybe the clear bottle had encouraged some ill flavors to develop, but I wasn't as impressed by this beer as I had hoped to be. The appearance was wonderful -it was dark with good head retention. It smelled of coffee and chocolate. The flavors began with a nice medley of coffee and chocolate but the long finish passed through some rougher territory - almost whiskey alcohol notes and some buttery flavors. It was a complex porter, but not exactly ideal."
"Eh, I would say go for the oatmeal stout, but, you should at least try this, for the sake of trying it"
"Taste is mildly chocolate with an aftertaste of coffee. Very smooth and very drinkable. Excellent beer and definitely one of my personal favorites."
"Seldom do I rave...I can only hope my ancestors has access to beer this good!!!"
"Despite this beers mildness, something reminded me of Stone Imperial Stout. Not intensity, but in livelyness. Maybe it was the type of hops (not amount) or perhaps just that both of these beers sing to me."
"Poured a deep dark brown almost black with a big tan head. Smells of caramel, chocolate and spicy. (maybe clove?) The smell is great. There are caramel and slight spice taste and small sweetness to this brew. The mouthfeel is much ligther than anticipated and quite unlike its heavy scent. This is a very smooth beer and very drinkable."
"The Taddy Porter. I love the appearance on this beer. Pours out a very dark brown, close to black as it can get with a hint of ruby shade on the bottom of the glass. Smell consisted of malts, caramel, some plums mixed in as well. Taste consisted of some coffee and some roasted flavors. Some of that caramel and plum comes into play as well. It's balanced so well. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, goes down very nicely. Only gripe is that it's some damn expensive, but you get what you pay for (most of the time)."
"John"
"It's just so easy to drink. The rasins in the nose blend very well with the overall flow of this beer. One of my favorite porters now, but it is much different from my other favorites, as the particularly fruity nose and taste set it apart from the others. I want to eat a steak and drink this at the same time...."
"Dark mollasses brown and black, with a great deal of thick, reddish brown head and stringy sticky lacing. The aroma is very rich, with many nuances. It is somewhat similar to Samuel Smith's other beer Oatmeal Stout, both in aroma and taste: the difference is that Oatmeal Stout is much sweeter. Coffee, chocolate, subtle fruits, vanilla, cream, raisins, and even slight spicy notes greet the nose. The aroma even carries some smells more common in fruit brandies . The smell, to me, is the outstanding characteristic of this beer. The taste is balanced well, sweet yet dry. Initially it has a crisp sweet syrup flavour, but gives way to a coffee-like dryness in the finish; and the middle is where you taste the medium alcohol presence. There seems to be a slight oak taste on the front of the tongue; yes, definite wood flavours slowly reveal themselves upon subsequent sips. I sense a strong graininess on the palate, almost as if there are coffee grains in the beer, and it adds delightfully to the character of the brew. The taste lingers on the mouth for quite some while, which makes this a highly drinkable and sociable beer: relax after dinner with one, slowly sipping and savouring. As a classic, this is not meant to be consumed rapidly."
"Excellent porter, my new favorite. Definitely something to try."
"Near black in color, with a large puffy tan head and good lacing. smell is burnt malt and chocolate/butterscotch and some alchohol. taste is similar...malty, with some chocolate, butterscotch and brown sugar tastes. There is some bitterness - I assume it comes from black malts, but hops are also distinguishable...but regardless of what causes it, the bitterness is very overshadowed by the malty brown sugar/chocolate flavors. mouthfeel is right... full but not rich. A good beer, although quite expensive."
"Served in a clear glass 12 oz. bottle at ""The Alchemist and the Barrister"" in Princeton, NJ. The appearance was excellent. Dark brown with a tan/offwhite medium head. Nice lacing that clung to the side of the glass in patterns that looked to be made by a spider spinning a web in zero gravity. The smell was good, toasted malt and coffee. But the taste was where this beer really shined. Toasted burnt malts, dark espresso and buttery toffee. Especially the nutty, buttery toffee flavors. Amazing. Very well balanced with the hops. I haven't been this pleasantly surprised in a while. Something about that toffee flavor just got me, I was in love. And I rarely drink Porters. Mouthfeel was great, not too carbonated but very plush and satisfying. Drinkability was excellent as well. If I wasn't driving I would have certainly had a few. This is defiantly going in my fridge next time I make a run."
"A delicious porter from Sam Smith, especially for those who are fans of the very dry, hoppy finished porters. Quite good, and certainly one that I'd look for again in the future."
"A good beer and an excellent Valentine's gift."
"Dark brown with dark red tints and a thick frothy head. There is a bit of lacing. The smell is very sublte but good aroma of roasted malts and chocolate. Burnt taste of malts and slight hints of coffee and toffee. Sweet chocolate taste with very smooth very rich taste of roasted malts. The aftertaste is creamy and outstanding. Quite enjoyable. Great blend of malts."
"Poured a graham cracker brown color into my glass with a medium head that laced pretty well. Smelled of coffee, carmels and bitter chocolates. Tastes hits the tongue with a bit of malt and alcohol and a fruit surprise at the finish - I say surprise because throughout the duration of this beer I never could nail what fruit or spice I was tasting to get this effect. The body was nice and thick and I'd drink this beer again - especially with a steak and potatos kind of meal."
"The pour creates a deep dark brown color. A minimal head of beige is erected. Staying power is not good. Slight aroma of cocoa and java and european malts. The flavor is not really on. It's not horrible, but it's just a little bland and perhaps a little light struck. Bland maltiness dominates and is accentuated by a slight sourness and some light roasted tones. This is just not a good porter."
"Pours an opaque, deep dark brown with a modest tan head. Lacing had a smooth, silky appearance as it left sheets down the glass. Aroma and taste surprised me with a complexity that was somewhat unique. Roasted coffee and chocolate were dominant, with earthiness, smokiness, and black walnut on the nose. Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, carbonation just barely adequate. Taste was much like the nose, but with some interesting twists that made for one of the best tasting dark beers I've ever tried. There's definitely a hint of cherries in this, and the twang of those funky English hops. I can't decide if it's licorice or cinamon, or some other bittersweet spice, but there's something here that melds perfectly with the chocolately malts, cherry fruitiness, and buttery walnut to produce an exceptional flavor profile. Just enough bittering hops to balance the many other flavors going on in this fine porter. Finishes smooth, and goes down so fine. High drinkability with the low abv. Finest porter that I've sampled to date."
"Pours the darkest shade of brown known to man. The head is just as it should be for the style-not overwhelming,yet always hanging in. A bit more lace would be nice though. Aromatics are of creamy bittersweet chocolate-strong black coffee, and black licorice. The roast is quite dark. Smooth and very creamy in the mouth with a mild fruityness, bitter coffee and more black licorice. The bitter is quite unique and appreciated. This is a tasty porter that I will be sure to pair with fod upon the next visit."
"Medium bodied with a velvety smooth creamy mouthfeel. Good drinkability."
"This beer poured into the glass a deep dark cocoa brown/black with hints of ruby when held to the light; it was clear and decently carbonated. The head that was produced was thick, and very dense, beige colored and long lasting. The lace that was formed was thick and sheety near the top, slowly broke apart near the bottom of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were fairly simple, which is nice, smells of coffees, chocolate and some rich dark malt. Classic. The tastes that I experienced were of coffee and hints of chocolate in the beginning, then slowly caramel notes came forth, then dark malts, then as it finished more combo of coffee , chocolate, and hints of dark fruits as it ended. The aftertaste was on the dry side, with combined flavors of malt and coffee. The body was medium. This is a classic beer, well represents its style. Creamy, rich, dry, hints of bitter and fruit make this beer worth the try and IMO would get again."
"I was all excited to get this one home. I like Sam Smith's beer a lot. I expect great things. Pours a deep lack colour with a rich brown/tan head the receeds into a brown lace. the smell is of roasted malts. The taste is rather soft for a porter. Roasted malts with a feel of coffee. Somewhat bittersweet. This is average, as far as i'm concerned. I guess I just got my hopes up too high. But it wasn't bad. I was expecting a pefrect 5."
"I have a real mix of thougts on this beer. It looked exceptional, but the strong tastes of this style aren't what I'm looking for. If I were to drink a porter I'm sure this would be my choice. Many of the similar qualities that make Samuel Smith's Pale Ales delightful are present here. However, I see this being a rare situation."
"The taste is exceptional. It is a smooth and rounded blend of roasty malts, cane sugars, and huge malts. Don't look for a hop prescence here, this is a malty-porterhead's delight."
"Beer was in a great looking clear bottle (normal for Samuel Smith), 550 ML."
"A very dark porter - black with a tan head that doesn't stick around for long. Smell was not good when cold, but as it warmed it became sublime. Wow - the aroma would fare well against my favorite dark Belgians. Sure, the dark chocolate is there in good balance with roasted coffee beans, but the great parts are the esters and the hops. The dark cherries meld perfectly with the earthy hops. Unfortunately I find the flavor to be a let-down after such an aroma. It is rather bland roasted malts with a slight acidic twinge and butteriness at the end. Not bad, but not anything special. The carbonation feels a little rough on the tongue, and the body is thin. I think I pick up some higher/fusel alcohols. I have a feeling this beer would be devastatingly good on cask, but as far as out of a bottle, it is just above average."
"The beer pours a deep black color with a thick tan head. The aroma is decent, but a bit on the dark side. It is full of roasted and black malts; a hearty porter. The taste is good. It has an elevated abv. taste with black malt flavor and a creamy finish. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent porter; definately not my favorite. I just can't get into these super black porters."
"When poured, it was very dark brown in color with a medium amout of tan foam and nice lace from start to finish. The smell of roasted malts is what first filled the nose and was very pleasant. The taste was a creamy delight with the flavor of roasted barley malts and a nice balance of simi sweet chocolate on the finish. Overall, this porter was full in body and packed with flavor. Intense, dry tangy character of roasted barley and chocolate."
"This one was instantly one of my favourites. I love this style and this one in particular was no exception. Poured quite dark, somewhere between coffee and old motor oil. Brown head dissolves quickly. Smells almost like it tastes. Smoothness due in part to the lack of carbonation as there is almost none to speak of. Taste is very pronounced coffee, chocolate, and caramel. Quite malty indeed. I detect a bit of nutiness, perhaps an almond like flavour as well. The only reason I gave drinkability 4,0 as oppossed to 4,5 is because this is a bit heavy, and I can easily see where after 3 of these (keep in mind I'm drinking the ,550 litre size) one would certainly have his or her fill of this wonderful brew, at least for a while. Nevertheless, this is marvelous stuff."
"Very dark brown body, almost black with a brown head that disappears rather quickly. Smell was complex but not that great - raisins, almonds, some coffee, some chocolate, and caramel. Smokey and a little wine like aroma. Taste was of coffee, licorice and chocolate. Big coffee aftertaste. Tasted slightly stronger than 5.0 %. Good amount of bitterness in the end. Mouthfeel was pretty smooth with light to medium carbonation and a little sticky."
"Poured from a clear 12 oz. bottle, it's dark brown with a trace of cherry when held up to the light. The initially fat head fades quickly but never disappears completely. In addition to the expected coffee aromas, it presented a bit of a winey smell that was surprising but not unpleasant. The taste is a thoroughly enjoyable mix of coffee, hints of chocolate, and just a bit of hop bitterness. Drinkability? This is an all-day beer."
"Drinkability - I can drink this all night long. Leaves you begging for more, and more, and more! The perfect blend of flavor and kick. Doesn't have any of the bitterness or harshness that many bad porters have."
"Yes, there is some rather large grapefruit at the nose. I didnt pick up as much sweetness in the taste this time around, but I got some good (albeit light) brown sugar and a twang of rising yeast. Its definitely a solid medium in the body and was a little too clumsy to be called a session brew. Im adjusting the scores a little bit but I think, ultimately, this is a sub-4.0 beer that barely avoids my, would buy again recommendation."
"Almost dead black,with some deep brown visible when held up to a light. Thick frothy dark beige head with a good lace. Smells of coffee, chocolate and a bit of spice mix nicely with the yeasts and malt. The taste is very light with coffee and chocolate again. It actually taste alot like a whete beer or lager, where the malts, whetes and a little hops are more present. The malted grains prevail the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it becomes less noticible and as you continue to drink it the substance becomes more evident. The carbonation is perfect."
"The flavors in this beer are very good, but I was slightly dissapointed because it wasn't as complex as I expected and was more mellow than I anticipated as well. The flavors could stand to be kicked up a few notches, but other than that this is a good porter, and another good beer from Sam Smith."
"Very smooth, nicely balanced, on the light side of medium, very creamy, and extremely drinkable, another winner from Samuel Smith."
"I love the appearance--a deep, beckoning ebony just clear enough to show tints of blood red hue topped off by a lacy, sticky light chocolate head. The aroma is a combination: first, of a garden in early fall, after the harvest, when the dirt has been uprooted, mixed with burning maples in the air. The taste is smooth, smooth, smooth, and there's a balanced floral/coffee/chocolate maltiness. This ale has a silky mouthfeel, which is just a tad (pardon the pun) thin. I could drink this all night, but I have only one bottle, and it is, after all, a week night."
" I am not a big fan of this one. It does seem, however, and thankfully, that SS imperial stout actually benefits from this quality. There they stepped up the hops to accomodate there thick sweet beers."
"I love this beer."
"This is a great offering from Samual Smiths. Taddy Porter has a great balance and wonderful drinkability that makes this one of the top porters Ive had. Worth every penny and worth having at the ready in my fridge."
"Overall: Simple awesome. This definitely beats out the Anchor Porter, my previous favorite. A variety of flavors and an excellent mouthfeel make this one of my all time favorite beers, I actually prefer it to the Imperial Stout. Seek this one out."
"A fine porter that comes with my highest recomendations."
"Well rounded easy drinking porter."
"The flavor is just as subtle, pretending, at first, to be too light, but gaining strength as it is allowed to develop. After a while, the very fine subtleties of this brew begin to impress. The feel is creamy and smooth, having very light carbonation. Very drinkable beer."
"This is very disappointing to say the least. First off, let me ask the question, ""Why does Samuel Smith continue to use clear bottles?"" Without a doubt it effects the flavor. Dark brown/black with a tan head. Not a very strong nose. Smells lightly of buttery coffee and chocolate. Flavor is rather flat, and not what I expected. Coffee and slightly acidic, although it has a fairly smooth mouthfeel. Call me crazy, but I just didn't care for this too much."
"Poured very dark,had a plum raisin chocolate cake type of a roma, nice cocoay first taste, slft little bit of a mocha backtaste, seems more carbonated then other porters I've tried, but it seem that the way it is with all brews from this brewery.No heavy bitter alcohol taste that I find unattractive with other porters. Probaly the best porter I've had."
"Poured from a 12 oz clear bottle with gold foil around the cap. Very dark beer, almost absorbs light. The pour produced a light brown fluffy head that slowly shrank to a thin layer covering the top of the beer and the sides of the glass. The smell is mostly of roasted grains. The beer feels light and bubbly as it rolls accross my tongue. The taste is nothing extraordinary, smooth roasted malts on the way down, a very slight coffee kind of aftertaste on the back of the throat. All in all a very drinkable beer, although you might want to find a local beer with similar quality for a few bucks cheaper."
"Dark black color. Medium tan head. Aroma is chocolate and coffee, not very sweet. A light to medium bodied porter. Malts are chocolate with a touch of smoke and wood. Hints of vanilla and plums. Nicely balanced. Smooth flavor. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter."
"The color is the deepest ruby you can get before it becomes opaque, the head is Herculean in size with a spumescent texture, the color a beauteous light tan and after decomposition a thick and chunky sheet of lace clings mightily to the glass. The aroma of lightly toasted grains and sweet malt dominate the nose, crisp and fresh with a malt laden and sweet start, the top is moderate in its feel to the palate, Crisply acidic, the hops personable in their spiciness, with the aftertaste quite dry and a bit tart, one of my all time favorites, and one I consume with much gusto on a regular basis."
"Appearance: Deep ruby brown with an almost purple haze....ha ha purple haze, well anyway it also has a tan brown moccha color to the massive sized head leaving definite clear rings of lacing to it. Aroma: Slight fruity approach mixture of hops in there to balance out the semi smoked deep roasted malts that provide chocolate and some coffe tones very nice. Taste: Definitely an acquired bitterness with a pleasant array of rolling sharp sweet tones blended with the coffe and chocolae available along with a sharp ale yeast driven fruitiness. Mouthfeel: A tad thin haha... get it...but really it;s a bit light for my tases just doesn't deliver the texture and body I am searching for in a porter. Drinkability: Don't worry this is one of the most drinkable representations of any porter I have sipped upon sometimes the price may keep you from partaking but that's Merchant du Vin's fault not ol' Sam Smith's right?"
"Overall a good beer. I wonder if it is fresh. I would like to try another bottle."
"Taste is complex. Dry up front and sweet going down. Hints of smoked almonds and maple syrup. Very thick and full-bodied. Great looking beer and tastes nearly as good. The darkest, thickest porter I have ever had the pleasure of tasting."
"This is the type of brew that could make me a porter fan...The beautiful chocolate appearance is topped with a creamy head with excellent lacing. Smell hints of coffee and smoke, but light enough to be inviting. Taste was smooth with a slight acid, coffee twinge. Very easy to drink...a damn nice brew."
"The great looking beer is almost completely opaque, only when held to the light is there a slight hint of ruby color. A thick, creamy tan head tops her off, leaving a nice lace trail in its wake. The scent coming out is a nice chocolate one. Taste wise, this is a creamy smooth porter, with chocolate and coffee dominating the scene. This is a pretty sweet drink, worth your 3-4 bucks a bottle."
"Pours a dark cola colour with a fairly nice tight head.. Redolant with the smell of malt with a little smoky spice to it. Lovely malty dark brown sugar flavours with enough hops to balance it out it out. light enough in ABV to be a session beer. Mouthfeel is fairly carbonated but not overly offensive. Overall drinkability is high due to the lovely flavour and low ABV. Another winner from Sammy Smith."
"Picked this up on word that it was exceptionally tasty, which it was. Waited until steak and stout night came around, and cracked it open. Poured nicely with a surprisingly tight and well formed head for a bottle. The just nearly black liquid looked somewhat clear, though there was no alteration in color as I drank, or held it to different light. Aroma was almost nil, just a slight smoked peat smell. Taste followed up on the smokey note with a mouth full of darkened and dry malts. A nice rich flavor that would beat single malt any day. The beer had a nice dry feel to it, so it followed up dinner quite nicely. Certainly a great beer."
"In the mouth it's smooth and creamy. I could drink a lot of this, without a doubt."
"Enjoy."
"Poured pretty much straight black with some minor ruby highlights around the edge of my glass. Nice size frothy tan head. Aroma is strong of english hops, almost a bit like tea, and caramel malt. This is a pretty tasty beer, although it's hard to put my finger on any one flavor. There is definitely a burnt roastyness. The hops kind of balance this out so it's not too heavy in taste. There is also a very slight plum taste in there, really all sorts of very delicate fruits. The kicker for me is the finish, which is smooth & buttery like most sammy smith ales. Good carbonation, but it kind of detracts from what would be a velvety mouthfeel. For a beer so meaty this is very drinkable. Can't go wrong with sammy smith"
"I would say that the only disappointment of this beer is that it comes in a clear bottle but somehow doesn't have the skunky taste that clear and green bottles give beer. However they do it, keep on doing it cause this is a wonderful beer."
"I love the smoothness and quality of the Sam Smith brews! This one, if you are familiar with Sam Smith brews, is about what you'd expect. A fairly black appearance with a thin, creamy head. A slight aroma of chocolate, roasty, and malty for the smell. It has a very flavorful taste with primarily chocolate undertones. This one is very smooth and creamy on the palate. As far as drinkability goes, I want another! Great porter."
"Looks how a porter should. Color is right in between a dark stout and a brown ale. Tan head sits atop the beer and doesn't budge. Aroma is weak and doesn't let the beer truly show itself. This beer has so many flavors that I had trouble picking up on all of them. I noticed a prune sweetness up front. Espresso comes in slightly but then backs out. Chocolate takes control shows itself in a powerful way. Hops and an acidic quality are there just before the finish. The finish is of roasted nuts and espresso and lingers for awhile. Quite a treat!"
"Aftertaste is bitter and hoppy. Surprisingly long finish. Tongue tingles for many seconds after the swallow. Difficult to taste the sweetness the aroma would seem to predict. Very refreshing."
"another amazing beer from sam smith. i definitely recommend this if you want to familiarize yourself with porters. this is the orginal. super super super complex rich taste. very chocolate and cofee-like without burning the tongue off with acidity. nice balance. the only ""problem"" is drinkability, but one bottle is pure bliss anyway."
"Pours a deep black but I did notice some slight red hues thru the glass with a thin off white head.The aroma is not very strong on this beer soome slight sweet rasiny smell to it.The taste however is bursting with complexty of flavors,very roasted flavor with some coffee notes,also a lingering raisiny sweetness in the finish.A real nice flavorful porter,a true classic."
"This beer poured a tan head with large sized bubbles. There was good lacing on the sides of my glass with this beer and the nose was that of alcohol.I am not a fan of beer that has an overpowering, strong coffee taste to it and this beer however was to my liking because it did not have an overpowering coffee taste to it in my opinion.This beer went down smooth and easy."
"This brew has an aroma of alcohol in it. When poured, it yielded a very energetic light brown head of large bubbles that formed a very nice lacing as it receded down the side of my glass with a dark ruby brown almost opaque body. It looks delicious as I anticipate my first taste. I am not disappointed. Initially it had a very smooth taste then the roasted malt coffee finish hits. Not a strong coffee taste mind you but there none-the-less. Still it was very smooth and much to my liking."
"Another quality brew from one of the great breweries in the world. Not quite in the class of the Fuller's porter, but right up there with any of the others. Pours a huge, foamy head, with good retention and some lace. Smooth, cherry like flavor. Relatively thin body, good drinkability. Very little bitterness. Excellent with food. A pleasure to drink any time I've had it, as is the case with all of Samuel Smith's beers (and I've yet to be skunked)."
"This monster pours like a stout, chugging into the glass, a deep mahogany, with a huge foamy soapy combo for a head, lacing incredible throughout. Burnt coffee and chocolate on the nose. Sweet caramel and some chocolate notes up front, very rich and medium to full bodied. Deep roasted malts and coffee beans noted in the body, some light acidity and bitterness come full circle. Flavorful, rich and complex, superb evening drink. What a great beverage, well done by the S.S. team, this is one top-notch porter!"
"12 oz bottle. Poured a deep black, with a large frothy chocolate head that slowly receded to a fine ring, losts of sticky lace on the glass. Aroma reminds me of Harvey's Bristol Cream Sherry. Taste is of roasted malt, and again of the Sherry, with some smokey hints. Very good balance of flavor, creamy mouthfeel, and good carbonation. I had this one other time and didn't think much of it. But as I have sampled other beers, and have taught my palate what good beer is, this porter is one I can really enjoy!"
"Drinkability/notes: A beer so superb that it is difficult to justify with mere words, it is quite worthy of its relatively high price. Surely one of the finest porters and finest beers in the world. I would note that this beer is probably best enjoyed in cooler weather that normally found in Texas during the month of June."
"It's only spring now, but I long for those cold northern winter nights so a couple bottles of this can keep me warm and satisfied."
"-F"
"Drinkability: Pretty good for the style. Due to the somewhat harsh, bitter undercurrent, I don't think I could drink it all night. However, it is a classic that never fails to please. This was probably the freshest bottle I've ever had of it..."
"A black robe reveals mahogany highlights at the base; and around the sides when held to the light. Its rocky tan head holds exceptionally well to start; and it maintains a thin, creamy surface covering throughout the pint. The nose displays caramel, fruit and soft buttery diacetyl. The body is medium/light with a very fine carbonation that leaves it lightly creamy and soft in the mouth; and very smooth across the palate. The flavor reflects the nose with mildly sweet caramel; fruit that's a touch winey with red grape, raisins, and berries; milk chocolate; and some rounding buttery diacetyl backed by a solid bitterness. What's not to like? It finishes dry with a residual note of fruity caramel and light butter. Very well done with quite a bit of finesse - light but complex! Absolutely enjoyed best at cellar temperature!"
"Not a bad beer, but not that good of a beer either. It is worth a try, but not one that I will be drinking regularly."
"This is one damn fine beer! The best thing, is that it's really not that expensive. $3.50 a bottle, and the bottle is pretty good size to it. The color was a beautiful dark color. It reminded me of the nights in rural northwest PA, where my nearest neighbor was a mile away. There was a bit of a head to it, but it died down to a thin laceing. The smell was that of a roasted coffee. The smell was somewhat similar to a coffee, mixede with an alcoholy taste, mixed with a little bit of a choclate taste. I say got for it!!!!!!"
"Poured black with a thick, off-white, foamy head. A dark, deep red tint was apparent as I held the glass to the light. The foam subsided after a few minutes, lacing the glass nicely along the way. The aroma was the distinct, subtle scent of dark chocolate with a pleasant hint of smoke. The taste was the same; creamy, smooth, slightly smoky with a wonderful mild hop finish. The syrupy thickness and sweet, creamy mouthfeel were a perfect combination for this great beer. Truly a wonderful Porter. Hats off to another great product from Sam Smiths!!"
"Poured a dark brown, almost black with a slight tinge of red along the bottom and sides of the glass. Thick creamy head, receding relatively slowly, leaving lace along the sides of the glass. The aroma is almost like a mixture of coffee and dark chocolate, very inviting. It buzzes lightly on the tip and sides of the tongue, finishing dry. I was left salivating for another sip. A very light coffee taste is left behind, but overall very smooth. Doesn't finish too light or too heavy. Certainly a beer to be savored and enjoyed, not to pound back during the game."
"Pours black, with slight ruby highlights. It forms a light brown, creamy head with good lacing. The aroma is milk chocolatey, roasty, and coffee-like. It has flavors of milk chocolate, with roasted malts and coffee notes. It has excellent mouthfeel. It is silky, creamy, and almost oily/buttery. It is a very smooth, easy drinking beer. I am a big fan of porters, and this one is a very tasty one."
"deserves a good food match."
"This pours out with a deep tan thick head that falls upon deep dark brownish-red liquid, gently carbonated at that. Nose is the typical Sam Smith aroma, very low level of diacetyl mixed with their strain of yeast fruitiness, a little toffee, a little roasty maltiness...all good! Taste is very distinctive, a mix of roasted malt, light coffee tones, fruitiness followed by a just-there hop bitterness. Finishes up dry and delicious, long and smooth...very satisfying, one of the most distinctive examples of the style. Not a ""big"" Porter, but one tasty ale!"
"Great tasting porter, I wish I had a piece of Chocolate cake to go with it."
"This is an exceptionally smooth and easy drinking Porter. Pours a dark brown color with a slight ruby hue. A thick and creamy tan head initially presents itself and then fades into a nice lace. Aromas of malt and coffee are detected with a hint of chocolate lingering in the background. Taste is full of roasted malt, chocolate, and molasses, with just the slightest touch of fruitiness. This is a nice medium-bodied creamy porter. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
"(I think I've been reading fellow BA Cokes' reviews too much, he's starting to rub off on me! Thanks for the inspiration, Cokes!)"
"Overall, this beer was okay. I don't think that the flavor of this brew lived up to the expectations caused by its appearance and wonderfully complex aroma."
"Since I love Porters I was excited to bring this home and enjpy it with my fav cigar. I was dissapointed. I liked the pour and the head was very nice, leaving some lace, but the taste left me empty. It had hardly a mouthfeel to it so I suppose I'm being genorous in my rating, hardly any of the ""chewiness"" I'm used to in Porters. Would I drink again? If handed to me yes, but to buy it? Nope."
"Overall, this is a very good porter. I would recommend it to anyone wishing to close their eyes and drift away to Northern England."
"Altogether one of the most drinkable Porters i have had the pleasure to meet!"
"This was the first porter I've tried and I thought it was pretty good. A very dark brown almost black with a great head that lasted through the whole experience. Smell is of coffee and roasted malts. The coffee comes back in the taste with a little bit of chocolate. There is a little bit of fruitiness as well, mostly in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was a little thin for what I was expecting, but it was not bad. The brew was not as filling as I thought it would be but that is a good thing. Overall, a solid brew."
"A hard pour brings a beautiful, delicious cocoa-colored head with tiny tightly beaded bubbles and a very creamy texture. Color is opaque dark, dark brown to black with ruby red hints when held to the light. The nose is fruity and roasty with notes of cocoa powder, coffee, kalamata olives, and alcohol. At palate entry, cedary and fruity (almost citrus) hops, followed by roasted malt sweetness and an oakey earthiness. A nice, creamy mouthfeel throughout. The finish is tart and dry. A very smooth and characterful porter from one of the world's great breweries."
"This definitely a porter I WILL purchase and drink again."
"Cheers"
"Poors with a wonderfull thick almost nitro-style stout head that stays and renders nice lacing. Has a sweet and roated nose with hints of ainse. Mouthfeel is velvety and covers toung like a flanel blanket. Flavors are dry and complex with tart dark roasted esspresso and malt balls. It has an earthy body that really fills your mouth with it's robust flavors. Finishes dry with a grapefruity astringent hoppyness that is really well balanced and enjoyable."
"Pours a very dark brownish ruby color with a thick and creamy tan colored head that dissipates into a nice lace. Nose is sweet milk chocolate with notes of fresh coffee. Smooth and creamy in the mouth with notes of sweet roasted malts and chocolaty caramel. This is a very nice porter, one of my favorites."
"Pours with a one-finger light tan head that fades slowly leaving a good lace. Black as coal. Medium carbonation and heavy bodied. Nose is roasted coffee. Starts and finishes with a roasted chocolate/coffee flavor with a slight lingering burnt coffee aftertaste. $2.32 for a 12 oz bottle from Northend Superette Manchester, NH. Really an excellent porter and can be a part of your regular inventory."
"Tan, creamy head. Pitch black. Intenslely aromatic: rich, roasted coffee, butterscotch, toffee. Great hop presence. but light on the palate. Smooth, well-rounded, a porter full of character, that will remain on the top of my list until the end of time. Absolutely perfect. Light enough in alcohol to stand in as a session beer (but too expensive to actually work that way), and with plenty of body and bite."
"Oelergud - Cheers!"
"An old favorite recently revisited, very dark brown body with a lighter medium head, no skunkiness from the clear bottle. Just alot of roasted malt goodness, the usual chocolate/caramel/coffee tones that I seem to pick out of every non hop dominated beer I ever drink. A good old school porter, to appreciate what's available now, enjoy what I really got into 10 years ago."
"I could drink this all night, except for one thing: I only have (had) one bottle. It's gone now, and I can't get this anywhere near me. Ah well.... thanks for the teaser, nerofiddled."
"Classic."
"Served from a 550ml bottle. Poured nicely with a rich head on a almost black colored beer. Smell had a hint of coffee which probably hurt my review as a cannot stand coffee. The taste was OK but again hurt by the coffee taste. For me, a good porter to be enjoyed every so often but won't be taking up shelf space in my fridge.

"Taste is exceedingly smooth with a lightly roasted/toasted malty taste, like the nose, hints of chocolate, coffee and slate. Probably the brewing method (slate lined boxes thing they do) or real hard water contributes to mineral or flinty quality I find in all Sam Smiths wonderful beers. It works especially well with the Taddy Porter as I felt this ""hardness"" of the water balanced the roasted malt quality really well. It cut through it like a knife and made the porter very smooth and nicely drinkable. The finish was rich and clean with some dryness and earth. Great silky mouthfeel, is one of the best characteristics of this porter."
"Smell fresh hop bitterness with a touch of caramel in the nose.  Very carbonated. Deep dark red opeque color with a thick beige head.  Roast malt (burnt) taste with layers of caramel sweetness and notes of expresso.  The mouth is lighter than you would expect from the look, but still leaves a nice coat on the tongue.  A solid porter in every way!"
"I just wish they would put it in Brown Bottles for the USA Export market, and Casks for the UK one. This beer would be fantastic from the Cask on Handpump. Oh well, perhaps one day....."
"""The aromas are of whole milk, cocoa...very pretty. Flavors and texture of whipped cream, cocoa powdered marischino cherries... dry, velvety. Delicate, balanced finish, no bitterness. A suggestion of hearth. This beer is too much. Too alluring. Too epic. Too sultry. It lavishes my palate with serenely smooth texture but does not taste sweet. It demonstrates cocoa, hazelnut and cigar flavors but does not taste bitter."""
"Though not my personal favorite, this porter definitely has its merits.  Pouring a deep dark brown with a prominent creamy tan head, this brew possesses the trademark Samuel Smith's aroma with just a hint of dark malts.  The smooth medium-plus body supports a malty flavor with a noticeable smoky chocolate overtone.  The grassy hop finish is a nice contrast to the smoky dark malts.  Quite tasty."
"Excellent. Espresso/brown color with a light brown/tan colored head that thinly veils the glass as the beer goes along. A coffee porter classic. Roasted flavors and coffee/chocolate beginnings give it a character that is distinctively Samuel Smiths. A quenching drinkability. I really enjoy this one."
"Medium tan head quickly settles on this beer.  Color is a very dark brown to black.  Smell is all about roasted malts.  It's a very complex, nutty, roasted aroma.  Medium sweetness is nicely balanced with lingering, deep, roasted bitterness. Full and creamy mouthfeel.  This is a wonderful porter.  It's exactly what the style brings to mind."
"Pours a dark brown, almost black with a creamy tan head. The color yields some reddish tints when held to the light. The lacing is impressive. The nose is of roasted malt, coffee and licorice. The taste is more of the roasted goodness and a bit of hazelnut lurks beneath. There are also hints of dark chocolate, but they are very subdued. The mouthfeel is smooth, albeit a tad (no pun intended) bit thin for my preference. Drinkability is good, as this is a pretty easy-drinking porter. A choice offering from Sammy Smith."
"My initial impression was not favorable, but this got considerably better the warmer it got. Black color and hearty flavor, this is a sipping beer to be sure. Carbonation seemed to be heavy for this style. I'll stick to their Oatmeal and Imperial Stouts in the future."
"Dark brown, with a tan head... eventually settled to a lace that clung to the glass.  Aroma and flavor of roast coffee and a little bit of smoke.  Very smooth, low carbonation, and a medium mouthfeel.  This is a pretty good offering from Old Brewery Tadcaster."
"Pours a dark ruby brown with a fluffy brown head and nice lace. Coffee and chocalote aromas with some licorice. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel with just enough carbonation. Tastes of coffee, chocolate, toffee and a roasted flavor. Even smoother after warming a little and not too heavy. Delicious and very easy to drink. A must try...A+"
"Delicious!"
"Big, frothy head that stays quite well.  Very chocolatey appearance.  Coffee and chocolate aromas in the nose, kind of a sweet smell.  Very creamy mouthfeel, excellent taste which has a bit of coffee and chocolate, very sweet, a bit fruity.  Only a slight amount of bitterness.  Dark sweetness in the finish.  This has an excellent taste and mouthfeel.  Excellent and well rounded porter that I would find refreshing at any time."
"Burst of expresso when popping the cap. Brown-black body with ruby highlights. Big fluffy light brown head which settles down into an inch, then halk inch. Some lacing, in bottle and glass. Licorice, coffee, chocolate in nose and taste, less licorice in taste. Creamy mouthfeel with touch of fizziness. Full bodied.  Wonderful porter. Good late night beer. Another gem from Samuel Smith."
"This Porter is too smooth for being so dark.  Very enjoyable.  I cant wait until I drink my next Taddy, and I hope it is tomorrow."
"This was an excellent porter.  Heavy malt aroma with small head.  Very roasty flavor.  It is more stout than other porters that I like, but it is VERY drinkable."
"dark creamy smooth. a slight hint of coffee. this beer was fantastic. it was an absolute delite to drink. it doesn't beat out the oatmeal stout, but then again that may be impossible"
"This one has a nice dark color and a good head like most of Samuel Smiths.  The aroma is good and the taste has elements of chocolate and coffee.  A good beer, but I would agree with others that you should get the Oatmeal Stout."
"The saltiness in the finish / aftertaste ruins the pleasure of drinking this beer. I may like salty food with a beer, not salt IN the beer itself!"
"A very tasty porter. Very dark, finishes dry, and has a slight taste of coffee. Please try the Oatmeal Stout though...I can't stress that enough. This offering from Sam Smith though is very good, and worth the price."
"One of my favorites, its a deep brownish black color with a faint glimmer of red light shinning through. Immensely aromatic with layers of roast malt, fruit, licorice, and minty herbs. Medium bodied, dry, roasty, and rich in character with a hint of sweetness and a lingering malt dryness in the finish."
"pours out a deep cola color, with very little head.  a butterscotch and sweetened chocolate nose. barely perceptible hop aroma.  taste is full of chocolate malts, a smooth buttery mouthfeel....a slight bitter coffeeish finish.  some hop bite on the tounge in the very end.  an absolute delicious treat."
"This is my first Porter to ever drink.  If this is a good benchmark, I like Porter beers.  This beer has a very dark color with a very thin head.  It is a very smooth, very drinkable beer that has a coffee-like taste.  Perfect amount of hop bitterness and nice mouthfeel.  I would recommend this beer.  Think I'll have another."
"It ends with a nice long finish. Like I said though...not bad at all, but there are plenty of other options open."
"Pours like a champ, pillowy, cottony 1 1/2 inch head. Deep brown and opaque. Softy sweet aroma. Mildly caramel and slight mocha impression with a touch of interesting astringency. Hops not assertive. Starts full, surprisingly lighter-bodied at the back of the mouth. Swallow is satisfying. Affirms my love of Porters."
"Quite a nice porter, not too thick, buttery caramel charactereistics, slightly roasty charactereistcs aswell, good, without being exceptional."
"I'd really like to be able to try this on draught so I could compare it with Anchor Porter. As bottled beers go, it's incredible. As porters go, it's what's I expect."
"I love how that Yorkshire yeast finds its way throught the toasted malt flavor.  Very reminscent of a Ringwood-type beer.  A slight acidic tang reminds me of a Guinness.  In the back of my mind, I wish they would boost the ABV a little to catch up with the rest of the complexties of this brew and round out the mouthfeel.  But then it would be like too many other porters out there and not as special."
"Very dark deep red hue is perceptible, but only when held up to a light.  Thick, persistent off - white head.  Very mild roasted notes in the aroma with just a hint a toffee and chocolate.  Medium bodied with a very smooth and balanced chocolate malt flavor with a touch of yeasty fruitiness in the finish. This is a very drinkable, flavorful, and well balanced porter.  Just a notch below Fullers London Porter, one of my very favorites."
"Dark as the ace of spades. Clean aroma, warm coffee scent. A bit thin in the mouth, but a varied, complex taste. Great interplay between hops and malts, keeps the brew buttery and nourishing. Cozy, lingering burnt flavor that keeps you going back for more. Sam Smith brews never have tons of character, but they are always solid and delicious, this one no exception. Why the clear bottles, though?"
"Dark brown, almost black in color. Lightly carbonated with a thin tan head. On the nose it is sweet, with plenty of malt and some hops. Sophisticated and balanced flavor. The malt is firm on the palate. Light caramel notes, thick roasted malt flavor, followed by a rich coffee bitterness.  I detected a faint taste of grapes and plums. Finish is slightly chocolately, leading to a long, bitter, malty, coffee aftertaste. I found this beer to be slightly flat and dangerously close to being thin. It may have been the batch I purchased.  Time will tell. An excellent choice with seafood. A must try.  Enjoy.  Cheers."
"What a great porter.. smooth and velvety, chocolaty.. tasting this beer is definitely an experience to savor.  Perhaps a tiny bit too sweet; definitely one to drink sparingly (but do be sure to have one..)"
"Notes: Textured and well structured ... a top shelf porter and worth the $$$. A classic porter worldwide, one of best in the Sam Smith brand."
"I know this is considered one of the touchstones against which other porters are judged, and maybe that is why it seems to fall short of my expectations.  Very nice, but not outstanding."
