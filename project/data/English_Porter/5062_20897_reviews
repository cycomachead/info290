"It's ok as far as coffee infused porters go. We definitely do things bigger and bolder on this side of the pond. Not saying that's a good or bad thing. Just saying our coffee beers are a lot more in your face with coffee flavors."

"Pours like dark water.  Smells of coffee at first, but then get some sort of smell that is just off.  Taste is not pleasant, not going to be able to finish my portion of the bottle.  Feel is what you would expect based off the look.  Overall not good."

"This is a highly underrated beer in my opinion.  Pours a dark brown, with some brownish red hues coming through the glass when held up to the light.  I do notpickup a lot of coffee in the smell, more of the roasted malt.  The taste however is where I was blown away.  The coffee was present, but did not dominate.  At first, I tasted a nice burnt caramel that blended into a malty seetness.  Towards the end of the glass, I noticed a nice biscuity/toasty flavor.  I was very impressed with this beer, and will pick it up again."
"Great stuff from Meantime here, a very nice coffee porter that was full of flavour from the start with a lots of coffee present throughout, you wouldn't really expect anything else though given the name. The beer proved an easy one to finish with a nice touch of bitterness right at the end to see things out."

"Its finish is malty-dry and approaching medium-light at times. Aided with coffee-type bitterness, slight acrid cocoa, and the broad and woodish bitterness from hops; the beer concludes with a long earthen and toasted linger. Its a robust taste that's likely well suited for chili and bittersweet chocolate."
"o. Good beer, slightly above good once I got used to the strength of the coffee."

"The beer poured black with a cream head. The head lingered, and there was some nice lacing on my glass. The smell and the flavor were weak. I can taste coffee. I can taste roasted malt. All the flavors I expect are there, they're just weaker than I would like. The beer goes down easily."
"Overall: Quite good. More chocolate than coffee, but delicious all the same."
"Pours a very deep brown with reddish highlights that is close to black. A good1-finger thick foamy off-white head that stays around for a bit. A good amount of spotty lacing is seen also. The aroma is of dark roasted malts with some black coffee/espresso. The taste has much more of the black coffee/espresso flavor coming through for the finish. Perfect carbonation for this type of brew and no bitter aftertaste at all. If you like coffee and/or stout then this is for you. A great brew!"

"O - very well made, surpised I have not had before. Not usually a fan of this style but maybe the higher ABV removes the watery aspect sometimes found in this stlye."
""
"O: This is really kind of a misfire. There are certainly worse porters out there, but none so out of balance."

"330 ml bottle into pint glass, bottled on 8/16/2013. Pours fairly crystal clear reddish brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of dark roasted coffee, chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toast, roasted malt, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, and roast/toasty earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of coffee, dark/roasted malt, and light earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of roasted coffee, chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, and roast/toasty earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of coffee, chocolate, cocoa, roast, caramel, toast, brown bread, light nuttiness, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of coffee and dark/roasted malt flavors; with a good bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and slightly chalky/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice coffee porter. Good balance and complexity of coffee and dark/roasted malt flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"I need to search out a chocolate porter/stout from these guys, I think if they make one of those that compares to this with chocolate, damn, I can dream can't I."

"Overall: This beer took me by surprise, it packs a punch of flavor that will easily attract you. I can honestly say a definite must grab. Salud!"

"Overall, a decent English Porter but way overpriced for what it is. I wish the coffee was a little more pronounced."
""
""
""
""
"Pours dark brown, looking a bit thin as it comes out. Small to medium light beige head. Aroma of coffee and a bit of roasted malt, but slightly weak. Flavor is coffee and a bit of fruitiness. A bit of very light spice on the finish almost tastes like chile. Strange aftertaste for a porter. Not bad, but something a little strange."
""
""
""
"Pours a chestnut brown, with a thin tan collar. Aromas of blackstrap molasses and plums. Taste begins with a light woody flavor, followed by some toffee, then oatmeal, and finishing with a light coffee and smoke finish. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, somewhat disappointing. Overall a good porter, though a bit pricy for what you get IMO."
""
"O: Extremely easy to drink and goes great with brunch - it tastes like a coffee soda without any additional sweetness. The alcohol is very well hidden and it goes down quite smoothly. I could easily have a couple of these in a single session."

"Overall I would definitely drink this again, especially if I was looking for a coffee flavor."

"I don't think I've ever commented on bottle shape or design before, but there's something about the Meantime series that I really like. The half bottle shape, and the reserved label works for m e. On to the porter... one thing I hate is when beers claim to have some flavor (like a ""coconut porter"" or a ""basil honey ipa"") and when you go to drink it, the flavor is either hiding or unrecognizable. Some people may be more for subtlety, but screw that. When I read ""Coffee Porter", I want it to taste like the inside of a Civet's colon... and does it ever. It starts off with just an aroma, that familiar porter and stout smell that leaves traces of coffee in your nose. But the taste, oh man, the taste. It starts out with some dark roasted malts of your average porter, but then brewing up like a percolator comes delicious, aromatic, intense espresso flavor with just enough creamyness to keep the coffee bitterness under control. The flavor persists long after you swallow allowing you to savor the flavor. This is a really great beer for anyone who loves coffe."
"Pours a deep amber to black in color with light tan head. In the aroma, mellow and astringent coffee. In the taste, mellow coffee and a small roasty malt. A small coffee like bite, but mainly smooth and a medium bodied mouthfeel, with dryer coffee notes in the aftertaste. Nice coffee presence and mellow."
"A nice looking and fine tasting dark ale, but I wonder where the coffee component is hiding. It's there, barely, in the taste, but really doesn't make much of an impression. Still, this a good, mild and sweet porter and is worth trying just for that."
""
"A dark espresso with a bit of a red tinge on the pour with a large lasting tan head, very good head retention and lacing. Aroma is of dark roasted caramel and espresso malt. Taste same as aroma with some mild espresso bean bitter notes. A medium body with a slightly sticky and oily texture, smooth drinking with , mild carbonation. Sweet caramel and cacao espresso malt flavors on the tongue and a lingering mild espresso bitterness on the end for balance. A well made, flavorful and enjoyable after dinner drink."
"Pours an almost opaque super dark crimson-brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, chocolate syrup, and coffee candy aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa powder and burnt coffee flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has some nice roasty coffee and cocoa aromas and flavors."
""
""
"Great little coffee porter here with a good balance of coffee and dark beer, but without all the bells and whistles of a thick and rich porter that makes you feel like you ate some chocolate cake with a side of coffee like some others I have tried. Really close to the taste of an iced coffee with this one and is an easy drinker that is light and refreshing and pretty much good for any occasion."

"Meantime Coffee Porter has a nice deep oily hue to it, but only a very small ring as a head. Some carbonation is present with little to no lacing. The aroma is nice, reminding me of dark roast coffee beans and semisweet chocolate. After a few sips at various temperatures, I am finding that the the coffee aspect is much more prominent than any perceived chocolate. This is literally like a cup of coffee with a little cream and sweetener... it's amazing how they pulled that off. This is pretty straight forward, light, and very easy to drink. I would definitely buy it again!"
""
""
"M: The real letdown is here. What appeared to be a thick, hearty drink throughout turns out very thin and watery. A bit like the homebrews I've made myself. This may be personal preference, but I like my porters thick."
""
"Coffee porter was a perfect name, I felt like drinking an iced coffee which I really like. This can be drink even at the morning, not such as a full English breakfast like a Beer Geek breakfast would be, but as a hit and run one. They achieved a perfect marriage between beer and coffee."
""
""
"Overall, I think it loses just a little something, or maybe that it gains just that very slight acidity to it, but it's a good beer."
""
"Overall: A nice coffee porter here folks. Can't wait to try their other beers out."
""
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark copper/brown color with about a half inch light tan head that went away quickly. However, there's a good amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like coffee, along with some roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. I think the taste is pretty much like the aroma, but there's also some grainy malt and some nutty flavor, too. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick and goes down easy. It's good and worth a try, but pricey at $4.99 a bottle."
""
"Atmosphere is pretty nice. Dark hue, not much of a head, and slight lacing. Nose is full-on roasted espresso and dark chocolate with some nutty characteristics. Tastes like it smells. Roasted coffee is prominent with a little unsweetened dark chocolate. Overall, this is a good quaff."

"4.5/5"
"Meantime Coffee Porter pours brown with a small head. The aroma is a solid coffee porter aroma - about what you'd expect from the style. Coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts. The taste is outstanding, there's a really big, fresh brewed coffee note that dominates the whole show. When your coffee note is this good though, you can be one-note. The mouthfeel is on the light side, but that works with how actual coffee feels too. The drinkability is great. Overall, if you love coffee, this is your beer. It's got a huge black coffee taste, without very much else."
"O: I'd do it again, but really want to see if they can make anything just a tiny bit stronger in the flavor department."
""
""
""
""
"Obviously brewed with coffee, Meantime states that one bottle is equal to one cup of coffee. They also add lactose, which drops in nice layer of depth; creamy and more inviting with each sip. Coffee flavor could be dialed up a smidgen more, but it works."
""
""
""
"O: a good coffee porter, I'd say - it has very traditional porter qualities and an assertive coffee character, a good exemplar of the style, but it lacked anything special that would draw me back to it"
"Overall I have been after this one for a while since it was noted for it's strong black coffee taste yet smooth balanced body. I was impressed!"

"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a small snifter. Almost white head, moderate retention on a dark, dark mahogany body, almost black. Sticky lacing with small bubbles. Aroma is very much dominated by coffee and also includes slight chocolate and roasted malts. High carbonation on tasting, taste obviously is dominated by coffee but there are some sweet malt notes in the back with the roasted notes on the front end. Very smooth and quite easy to drink."
""

"Great well rounded porter with a bigger than usual body. Coffee stands out nice but isn't overtaking. Would be interested to try more from meantime brewing"
""
""

"Pours a dark mahogany brown. Quite clear. Small tan head. Nice colors but the head dissipates fairly quickly. Coffee is very well integrated into the aroma. It's more complex and holds greater subtlety than most coffee porters. The coffee is fruity and fresh with very little roast. The malt flavors are rich and soft. Dough, toffee, caramel, molasses, walnut, chocolate. Lots of flavor in the taste as well. It's sweet without going overboard. Nice coffee twang and light mineral hops in the finish. Toasty malt sweetness throughout. Mouthfeel is creamy and full, though could probably be a bit more in that direction in a perfect world. All in all, this is a very good beer. I think Meantime is oddly underrated by beer geeks. They're still on the pricey side, though many brewers have caught up. Still, they make high quality British beers and actually translate them well to bottles that are pretty easy to find in the US. Coffee porters/stouts aren't really my favorite, but this is a winner and I'd definitely put it in the lineup for any tasting of the substyle."

"Some flavorful aspects to this Porter with a few flaws in balance, but all in all a pretty unique offering. The highlight has to be the velvety smooth texture on the palate."

"O: Good drinkability. Nice beer"
"O: Not a bad beer at all and much different than american offerings. nice flavors and pretty enjoyable."
""
""
"Overall - The beer has a nice taste and it is very well balanced. I could drink a few of these in one sitting with no issues. I won't actively search out more, but I'd drink it again anytime."
""
""
"Not as good as I remember, but a decent coffee-forward beer. I'd recommend Kona Pipeline Porter over this, especially at 3.50 a bottle for the Meantime."
""
"This is a good beer for individuals that are not looking for anything heavy or sweet. I may pick this up again, but probably not for me."
""
""
"Enjoyable, easy drinking, a fairly straight forward coffee porter. One I'd do again."
""
""
"O - Not like any other coffee brews I've had before, in the sence that this one has an earthy quality that I have a hard time describing. It's not bad, but not great. Glad I tried it, but wont seek this one out again."
""
""
""
""
""
"Dr: Extremely drinkable, though in the average ABV range. I'd definitely have it again and I'm sure it'd be marvelous on draught (or better yet nitro-draught). The price could be better, but it's tolerable for an import."
""
""
""

"Pleased with this overall. Almost like a coffee milk stout. Would buy it more often if it was more affordable."
""
""
"This is an easy drinking coffee stout. Lots of flavor with subtle notes coming through as it warms."
""
""
"Pours dark brown with reddish highlights, minimal head. The scent is coffee, burnt and toasty, the flavor matches. It's almost like drinking cold coffee that isn't bitter. Very thin mouthfeel though, I wanted a little bit more from that department."
"---Rated via Beer's Advocate for iPhone"
"Clear black, head disappears quick. I admit the bottle is awesome and very elegant. Lots of coffee on the nose, very roasty but not too dry. Tastes like great English porter with coffee. Exactly what it says. I think it's very underrated. Roasty, dark black coffee, hints of vanilla and molasses. Bit more carbonated than typical but that makes it a lot more drinkable. I could drink a few of these, easy. A great English porter."
"I was on the fence with this one several times... At times, I thoroughly enjoyed the aromas while at others I couldn't stand the smell of it... Some sips were rich dark coffee while others were horrid... Ultimately, I fell on the side of not liking it as much as I'd hoped... I went back and forth with this and it just seemed to be missing something... I like well done coffee stouts and porters but this one left a little to be desired... I can't say one-dimensional because it smelled and tasted of coffee most of the time but it just didn't have that wow factor that I was hoping for... Glad I got to try it but I probably will pass this one by in the future..."
"O: Obviously not my favorite coffee beer but I’ve had worse. The coffee in this just wasn’t that good."
"This beer was served from an elegant bottle into a stem glass, and poured out a dark coffee brown color with a fluff of beige head that receded to a thin layer. Aroma = coffee. Not much more to say. Big and roasty. True to that is the taste, which is predominantly dark, roasted coffee, some sweet roasted malts and sugars (lactose?) for a nice balance. Hints of molasses. Medium body, moderately carbonated, and very drinkable. Coffee."
"O- Not sure what to make of this beer. Scratching my head really, don't know how this can be labeled a coffee porter. Wondering if I got a bad or old batch batch. I don't detect any oxidation and the best buy date is 110311, so I assume that is 11/03/2011 or 3/11/2011 and not 11/11/2003. Its not a bad beer but the style seems to be ""off"". Weird?"
"D - Not as dark or strongly coffee flavored as I though it might be. The coffee is definitely there, but it is more of a smoky, medium roast than the bold, espresso like flavors that I have seen in most coffee flavored beer. Not bad, but it was a bit too expensive for a mild, relatively low alcohol beer."
"O-A solid coffee beer. Not as intense on the coffee roastiness as some similar beers. A little more body would help this beer get to the next level."
"Pretty damn good. Best thing I have had from this brewery so far."
"Overall: It's really not a bad brew. A little pricey, but I am glad that I at least tried it."
"It does perk up a bit with the slight toast and roast malt flavors. And coffee of course. The beer was fermented in a lager style, which would explain the thinner, more effervescent texture that I wasn't expecting even from a more traditional English porter. All in all drinkable, yet unfortunately forgettable."
"Definitely better than most other coffee brews, Meantime has brewed a very worthy contender. When poured into a pint glass, I immediately noticed the rich foamy head with a nice amount of lace. The beer poured a beautiful light amber color and the aroma was of the coffee beans it was brewed with. Leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste, but this is a beer I would definitely try one again."
"O: what it lacks in appearance it makes up for in taste."
"This beer really took my breathe away but in a negative way. The porter poured out as a deep brown color but had no head at all. It barely even had a film on top. The smell of the beer is straight coffee, almost like they brewed coffee and bottled it. The taste is just coffee, I wasn't getting anything else from this beer in way of taste. The mouthfeel is watery and flat, very very boring. Overall I won't be drinking this one again. It just seemed like the put fresh brewed coffee in these bottles and shipped it out to everyone. No depth to this beer and nothing exciting either."
"O - Drain pour. Disappointment. This could be the last brew I seek from Meantime."
"O: Was like a cold, carbinated, dark roast black coffee. I would buy it again."
"bought this because of the bottle, just looks cool. pours out looking like soda, too brown for coffee imo. no head or lacing. smells like coffee, not the best, but coffee. tastes like flat soda mixed with a little instant coffee. maybe just a tad sour and no coffee bitterness or bite to it. for the mouthfeel i'm gonna go back to flat soda, not real appealing. overall i'm disappointed, would not recommend, and i'm mad at myself for buying two bottles of this when i saw it."
"Overall - I could easily have this as a breakfast beer. It's got lots of coffee character and the beer itself seems like its made to compliment it. There are still other beers that really ramp up the java and balance it better, but coffee lovers will not be disappointed by this one."
"Reminds me of a german Schwarzbier with coffee-candy infused. Not bad for desert but there are plenty of better coffee porters out there."
"This is a damn good brew for those special occasions, and lazy sit downs on a cold winter evening. Cigars any one?"
"O: Was expecting a thicker or more full bodied coffee porter. It you like iced vanilla coffees that are a little watered down this would be perfect for you."
"Overall, I am really digging this beer, from start to finish this has been one of my favorite beers that I've tasted, Not to mention this amazing little bottle will be going up on the display shelf lol. The only down fall I can see here is that, being a coffee flavored beer, it has pretty robust and rich flavors, so i don't know if this is a very sessionable beer, but one or two, with a nice savory pastry sounds like a pretty amazing afternoon haha. I definitely recommend this to any one who loves beer. Also I'm going to try sipping this and bailey's cream together, for some reason i think that would complete my life."
"d 0- Overall a decent coffee porter. The Smell was very sweet which seemed a bit weird for a coffee porter, and the taste seemed a bit watered down. Wouldn't seek out again but would give another shot."
"Verdict: (See what I did there? I used non-sequiturs to highlight the fact that this beer is not really like a beer)..."
"This is a coffee beer where it is obvious that coffee comes first, and beer comes second. And in this case, it works because it is laid back enough so to not overwhelm. It is awesomely unique in how well it is able to showcase the coffee and not get in the way of itself. As I mentioned before, the flavor is specific and direct, and Meantime does a great job keeping away any confusing flavors. Absolutely try this."
"D - OK drinkability but that cola flavour is something I'd have trouble getting past. Half of one was enough and I wouldn't try to get my hands on any more."
"D: Drinking this beer is a breeze and there's no traces of alcohol whatsoever in the taste. It's a good beer to start the day off with if you're looking for some carbonated coffee with a buzz but don't want anything heavy like a typical coffee porter or stout."
"Pours a maple syrup color which was much lighter than I expected with a coffee porter. Zero head on the pour into a tulip glass concerned me as well. Very surprised with smell of coffee and the amazing black coffee taste with minimal malt off the back to sweeten it just a touch. Mouthfeel is lighter than most porters and thus very drinkable with minimal taste of alcohol at 6%. Highly recommend this, could drink a few of these and could pair with some light desserts, dark chocolate or biscuits."
"Pours a dark black with a light cream coloured head into a brandy snifter glass. Tastes of roasted coffee with a smokey like finish to it. Not to bad overall, could be quite sessionable. Nothing really stands out, but thats not totally a bad thing either. Nice porter."
"D - Decent drinkability."
"D - Easy drinking and feels balanced. Could use more coffee flavour."
"Matching up with the weak malt profile, this beer feels a bit thing and watery but does have a better carbonation level than some (unlike the flatness that is Peche Mortel)"
"D - I guess its average drinkability. Stuff is a pretty poor porter. This tastes, looks, and smells like a watered down iced coffee, just at 6%. Oh well, cant all be great drinks!"
"Holy coffee, Batman! The aroma has elements of freshly ground beans, while the taste has overwhelming coffee elements, from start to finish. Sweet on the palate followed by a thin bitterness. All in all, a pleasant drink, but not well balanced. Certainly not a subtle ale..."
"Conclusion: Drain pour."
"The aroma remind me nuts, roasted malt bitter chocolate powder and obviously :) coffee beans. The body id light with a medium-high carbonation. The taste is a little bit sour and lightly bitter, some milky notes in the background. The coffee flavour is persistent"
"D: For me, the drinkability is not high. This is not the worst coffee beer (that dishonour goes to Dark Star) but far from the best (Peche Mortel) that I've had."
"Pours a dark chestnut/burgundy-ish colour, filtered with a couple fingers of off-white head. Creamy head, little retention. Nose of a very dark coffee roast, and a hint of underlying bitter dark chocolate. Not much else, but is quite prominent. Taste has less coffee going for it, but that still leads the way. Chocolate here is sweeter, and roastiness is less pronounced. Carbonation is too high I thought, and a body that wasn't big enough for me. Decent drink, but relatively one dimensional."
"This is the best of the coffee-styles I've tried. The only points I'd take away is for the sour aftertaste after a while. Otherwise roasty and pure, with unique smokiness in aroma as well as taste. Uniquely also, not malty, but dry and bright finish. Very pleasant, very satisfying."
"D - Tasty offering, but I've had better coffee porters. This one reminds me of Alley Kat's Coffee Porter, which was a little bland and sour. Nonetheless, nice to see a couple newbie's at the local shop."
"taste is the same - very coffee/cappucino like. bitterness to it but easy to drink. not a huge coffee fan but it was unique, and i really enjoyed this."
"D: I enjoy the bottle and cap more than they actual beer. It's a decent coffee porter, but to thin and one dimensional."
"This is where the beer goes all wrong with me. It's thin and oddly lactic with a strong bitterness that has nothing to do with hops or coffee. The coffee only comes up in the late aftertaste, not appealing....kind of gross. I only drank about 2/3 of it and then decided to pour the rest out."
"A great looking bottle pours a deep chestnut brown with nice ruby highlights and a dense creamy khaki head. Aroma is mostly dark roasted coffee, leather, and tobacco, slightly ashy? Malt has roasty and chocolate characteristics at first, then the coffee takes over and brings with it the leathery/tobacco undertones. Finish is crisp, slightly bitter like a black cup of joe. Lingering cofee bitterness that's slightly smokey. Medium,silky body, maybe a tad overcarbed. This one improved a LOT as it warmed; the off-putting smokiness gave way to more enjoyable complex flavours from the coffee beans. As mentioned, this is definitely more coffee than porter, but if you enjoy the former, then you won't be disappointed with this one."
"Overall: Overall the beer definitly delivers as advertised as a coffee porter. The fruit flavor in the middle throws me off a little. It's worth a try, but not a repeat purchase."
"not a balanced beer but well made and nice to drink."
"D: Despite not being exceptional in taste or smell, its certainly easy to drink. no off flavors, nothing annoying about it...Could drink alot of these actually."
"A unique bottle that holds a solid porter. The coffee character is great being well defined, sharp, and robust; easily separating itself from many other coffee infused beers. A good porter with a coffee base that I think could be so much better if the other aspects of the beer were more pronounced. At the same time, I'm not a big fan of English porters and this one left me more than satisfied."
"M - Very carbonated at first (too much) but that settled down after a few minutes in the glass."
"Meantime Coffee is among (if not the) most exquisite and enjoyable coffee-infused beers I've tried to date. It lacks all the acrid, crude roast and astringent acidity that dissuades me from becoming a coffee drinker but contains all the character, caffeine and gratifying flavour that makes me wish I was. Whether you're a coffee drinker or just a coffee-drinking wannabe like me, either way, this should be considered worthy of a purchase."
"Pours a light brown, mahogany is revealed in the light nice fluffy tan head that sticks to the glass well. The nose is all coffee up front followed by a toasted, slightly creamy malt. The taste brings a rich coffee up front with a solid toasted malt middle followed by a long lingering bittersweet chocolate finish. Silky smooth almost creamy mouthfeel. I was quite impressed with this brew, I was almost going to pass it up but picked it up anyways. If you come across this its certainly worth a shot."
"Worth a try, but another that I wouldn't dwell on..."
"Notes: Hmmm, maybe I'm used to sturdier US counterparts, this is good but a bit too thin and forgettable. First stab I take at this brewery and frankly, while decent, I'm not particularly impressed."
"D - Great. Goes down super easily. Personally, the coffee flavor is somewhat of a limiting factor, but it still goes down just as quick as I'd like it to."
"Overall drink-ability is good. Nice beer to start the morning with (if you have the day off :D)"
"Very easy to drink if I weren't disappointed in its poor representation of what I perceive the style should be. Maybe this is what an English porter should be which means it's what porters should be since the English invented the style. Anyway, I'd have been happier had they concentrated less on the ""coffee"" and more on the ""porter"". Still, it is pretty tasty despite being a bit thin...wish I were either."
"Overall a very good beer that meets my expectations if your in the mood for a coffee beer this is a good one to get."
"The beer felt lighter than expected going into it, but again, given that it is an English beer, it is probably about right, but it was very smooth and very easy to drink."
"This is gross."
"D: They got the ""coffee"" part right, but I was expecting a bit more in the ""stout"" department. It seems like I could have just had some cold coffee with a shot of vodka. I would drink it again, but I don't think I'll go out of my way for it."
"D- tasty enough to cruise through this effortlessly"
"The best thing this beer has going for it, outside the cool bottle, is the drinkability. While I am rather unimpressed by the offering as a whole, it does drink easily. There is nothing offensive about the beer, it just fails to live up to my expectations. I am glad to have tried it and glad to have the bottle, it will come in good use for homebrews. I would not advise anyone to avoid this beer but I cannot really recommend it."
"D: It's a solid English porter, just wish there was a bit more body on it."
"It's a decently drinkable beer. I would stick with Bell's Java Stout or Founder's Breakfast Stout, but if I'm jonesing for the flavor and I can't get either, I may shell out the annoying 4.79(or so) for this beer. Plus, it has a cool bottle."
"D: This is one that I warmed up to as I continued to drink. A good choice if you're looking for a semi-sessionable coffee beer."
"A fun little treat! I am not a coffee drinker (hate the taste, love the smell) but this I can totally enjoy for a bottle. Certainly won't stock the fridge with this, but definitely one of the more unusual flavored beers I've had that actually tastes good and that I'd share with others and perhaps have from time to time. Or maybe I just fell in love with the bottle..."
"D - This is different from all the coffee porters that exist and i commend Meantime for making a truly different beer. Its not bad tasting, but i cant get past the lack of body. comparing this to others in its category, it falls flat for me. I dont think i would consider this first when choosing a beer."
"Very good beer from Meantime. Its color is dark red. Aroma of coffee, roasty and dark chocolate. In flavor, something sweet and bitter, coffee, roasted malt and bitter chocolate. Good drinkability. Watery, however, well balanced. Beer for the coffee lover."
"Pics at: http://definitionale.com/2010/12/14/tasting-the-meantime-coffee/"
"D - I'm not a huge fan of coffee beers but this one is awesome in fact I think its going to be in my top five highest reviewed so it goes without saying this is a beer to hunt down and try"
"The beer pours a medium brown color with an off-white head. The beer was lighter colored than I expected. The aroma is chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. The flavor is heavy on the milk chocolate with some coffee, roasted malt and cream mixed in. The mouthfeel is very creamy and the carbonation is low."
"It looks like shit, and it doesn't feel much better, but smell and taste wise, this is a stellar brew and worth drinking often."
"I am a coffee geek and love a few coffee beers, and some are poorly done. check this one into the latter."
"Overall, I will buy this beer again. I think it will be one worth enjoying after dinner, and one I'd introduce to a coffee lover who is not completely sold on the craft beer scene."
"This beer impressed me very much. Yes, I know my screenname is Porter17 but I have not espoused my love of that style on all on you. Until now. This beer oozes delightful nodes of chocolate and coffee and really hit all of the points. The bottle itself is an impressive design and is a good omen. The beer pours delighfully and with a mysterious hue and fine head. The smell would impress any afficianado. Weighing in at a perfect 6.0% abv, it doesn't overplay the alcohol yest still packs a nice punch. The taste hits it 100% on the nose. Mouthfeel is smoooth and refreshing. Not sure you can drink many of these at a sitting but you can definitely enjoy them often. Just awesome!"
"Drinkability: An average coffee beer that is really rich. A sipper that I could have again or pass by."
"Poured a clear dark amber color ale with a large enough head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry coffee is quiet pleasant with light roasted malt notes also noticeable. Taste is also dominated by coffee with a dry aftertaste that is well balance with the light roasted caramel malt. Body is surprisingly quite light with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Interesting beer with great notes of coffee but lacking a solid malt backbone."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/2 inch head of a tan color. Good retention and decent lacing. Smells of strong bitter coffee, sweet malt, roasted malt, slight hop, and slight nut. fits the style of an English Porter. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable tartness. Tastes of coffee, dark citrus, roasted malt, and slight tart malt. Overall, an odd, complex, and interesting beer."
"This is a pretty decent, if fairly uninteresting, coffee porter and is actually quite drinkable. If you're in the mood for some coffee beer, it wouldn't be hard to put a few of these away."
"Unfortunately, the flavor and mouthfeel don't fully deliver on what the aroma suggested. This is still a tasty beer but it's a bit thinner than I hoped for and has a much stronger roast presence than I prefer. hankfully it's not oe dimensional with hints of chocolate, toffee, and nut to balance the strong roasted profile. Sweet finish."
"Really pleasant well made coffee ale,,,top flight."
"330ml bottle courtesy of Adil. Thanks dude! Pours a deep brown, bordering on black, with two fingers of foamy beige head and a few dots of lace. Smell and taste are rich coffee beans, roasted barley, dark chocolate, espresso, and a marked bitterness to finish. Mouthfeel is thinner than expected, well carbonated, a bit hollow, super chalky and parched aftertaste. A caffeine zip sets in midway. The strong coffee essence is well executed, but this lacks the depth and body of a truly great porter. My least favourite beer from the Meantime/R&R consignment order."
"pretty basic coffee beer I wouldn't go looking for it but wouldn't turn one down either, thanks ritzkiss for giving me a crack at this one"
"D - This is uniquely authentic coffe flavor, unlike any beer I've had before. It certainly stands out for that reason, but is somewhat disappointing since it is purely one-dimensional and is not very true to the base porter style. I wish it had some more malt or alcohol complexity to make it more beer-like."
"I like coffee, I like beer, and I usually even like coffee beer but this one fails to move past the one-dimensional stage in any convincing way. Would love to see some heft added to balance the coffee, of if not, perhaps some of the coffee reduced - though it's a pretty damn authentic coffee presence in this beer. Straight up cold joe."
"This is a very nice after dinner beer, and can very well replace the coffee."
"Pours an amber-brown colour with thick white head. Smells heavily of coffee and roasted malt. The flavour shows much of the same, with vanilla coming through. Taste also has a lot of sweetness that I don't always see in coffee porters, but it works well with the strong coffee flavour. A little bit thin in the body, but still quite drinkable. I would be interested to see what this beer could taste like from a nitro-tap to add some more body."
"A good enough beer, and one that's pleasant to drink. In relation to other coffee beers its certainly mid-tier, and I'd probably reach for the local attempt by Mill Street before considering this one again. Meantime have some damn sexy bottle designs, but in this case, the packaging was probably the only real stand out feature of the beer."
"D-This is seriously intense to drink. I wouldn't characterize it as sippable, you almost want to add cream and sugar to it. If you like coffee, this may be for you."
"The packaging was really quite unique in my experience. I have never seen an 11.2 oz. bottle shaped quite like it, and the label was a nice touch in conveying the mystique of the drink."
"Overall: Two things make me respect this beer: 1. The packaging. The bottle and label are outstanding, and I initially bought it just because it looked so cool. 2. This beer is unlike anything I have tasted, and that quality commands my respect without any other factors being involved. My impression is that this beer is trying to mimic black coffee as a primary goal, in taste, mouthfeel and drinkability. As a porter it fails those 3 categories, but as what it is trying to be, it nails it straight on. My review scores reflect this beer not so much as an English porter, but as a totally unique coffee-beer experiment.l"
"D - This stuff gave me the jitters. It is loaded with caffeine. That is not my thing. But it would be a great breakfast brew for many, I imagine..."
"Poured into a shaker pint. Poured a cloudy, very dark mahogany with a creamy tan head with nice lacing. Overwhelming aroma of roasted coffee. Strong coffee flavor but with a sweetness that takes the edge off, hints of milk chocolate. Silky smooth and goes down much easier than the aroma hinted at. I am not a coffee drinker and after smelling it I thought I would not like it but this is a very well made brew."
"I poured this beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was black as night. It poured a off white head that was really nice fluffy like a pillow. The smell was really nice of hazel nut. I thought I was going to really like this one but it was too bitter. Coffee too strong, but then if you like cold beer coffee this will be you. I will not try it again though."
"Notes: Definitely a lot of coffee taste, both some sweetness and bitterness. Not a bad beer, a little thin for the taste and style, but I guess it gives it a bit more of a coffee feel. Good if you are craving coffee, but otherwise not amazing."
"D: Went really nicely as an afterdinner drink after my lemon baked scrod. It truly is a coffee porter in that the malt blend and roast equals that of a nice cup of joe. Enjoy one by the fire on a cool winter's night or pop the cap off one to shore up your next plate of eggs benedict."
"D- I detect no coffee in this, so thats a black mark but as a stout, it definitely has a nice roasted malt quality but although in the smell it is a bit abrasive. Not a beer to be quaffed at a fast rate. One will do and even at that i found it hard to finish due to the bitterness."
"Was pretty excited about trying this one so maybe I hyped it up to myself too much. Poured alright with a decent enough head. Colour was a little disappointing, felt it should be a bit darker, especially after just having a James Squire Porter. Smells great and as advertised, of coffee. I am not a huge coffee fan but generally like coffee porters. Felt the bitterness feel a bit short. Easy to drink but much better available."
"Low carbonation, somewhat creamy but really not quite thick enough. A decent coffee beer.... I just wish I could figure out what that off flavor was. I know this was supposed to be an English Porter base beer, but it's something else...."
"I liked this beer. I'm not sure if I'll get it at this price point because of the other coffee beers available, but it was nice to try."
"If you want a beer that tastes and drinks like black coffee, this one is for you. I was tempted to add cream and sugar! I will buy this one again!"
"D: I like coffee stouts and porters, but this falls a bit short. Too thin and one dimensional. It's easy to drink, if you like coffee, but nothing special."
"Overall it's a good beer but not really worth the high price."
"D: Despite a few flaws, this is a very tasty and drinkable beer. The coffee flavor is quite intense, which is something I appreciate."
"One of my favorite drinks is Kahlua with soda, and that is pretty much what this tastes like, just a tad more sour. Not what I would expect for a beer."
"Taste is ok...not great. Reminds me of McDonalds burnt/over-roasted coffee. Light mouthfeel, a little nutty...like hazelnut maybe. Kind of earthy...but not in the good way, like sticks and leaves...next to a bonfire."
"D - not a very tasty beer, not as good as i was hoping for. I will not be purchasing another"
"Drinkability is only fair."
"The 6.0% abv isn't that noticable so it's easy to drink if you like the flavor, but since I didn't much care for the flavor it wasn't all that drinkable for me. I'll pass on this one."
"Picked this up as I am a huge fan or Porters. Carbonation heavy on the pour, but quickly dissapated and left just a light ring around the edge of the glass. Not as dark as many of the American style coffee porters. A nice dark amber hue when held up to the light. Strong coffee notes on the nose and the palate. A clean aroma -- no noticeable hops coming through. Maybe just a hint of hot cocao powder-like chocolate. Very smooth in flavor and drinkability. Good bitterness that balances the acrid black patent flavors. A kiss of sweetness in line with the English Porter style. Overall, a really nice porter."
"Very nice, good mouthfeel, a little bitter aftertaste, but the medium body goes down pretty smooth. Not for a light beer drinker, but for one of my first experiences with coffee beers, I enjoyed it a good bit."
"This is pure coffee, and the new 11.2 ounces is enough even for two of us. As far as the style, as far as a coffee beer, this hits the mark. Not something I am crazy about, coffee in the aroma, the colour. A good amount of head. Creamy mouthfeel, but it does reach a level of astringncy at the end."
"Also, either the label or someone informed me this beer has a caffeine equivalent of one cup of coffee, so I expect to a get a slight buzz upon finishing it (and I do, but not enough to bounce off the walls in drunken debauchery). Good job Meantime. Keep the good English Porters coming."
"It lacks a certain focal point, which I think takes away from it's drinkability and enjoyment level. It's a low enough abv to enjoy several of, but I'd like to have some other bottle when I want a coffee beer."
"D- I could slam a few of these down for sure, I love the fact that it's not too shabby on the ABV. I would say this is more of a coffee dark ale if anything, just trying to figure out how this is a porter. Coffee and brown ale lovers ought to be all over this one. Would purchase again."
"Drink ability is decent. Beer is session able but the off flavor gets to me. Dont know if this beer is infected but looking at other reviews other people have had this problem. Wish I would have had a normal bottle, I love coffee beers but dont know if I would buy other for fear of contamination."
"	 This beer has a nice light mouthfeel with a nice helping of carbonation. I have had this with breakfast as the label suggests and to me it beats out Guinness as a great companion to bacon, eggs and toast. I will always have fond memories of Meantime Coffee Porter, as it was one of the ones that gave me that beer epiphany that I hope everyone has in their lifetime."
"This beer had a very strong coffee taste. When poured, the carbonation fizzes like a cola. Very watery mouthfeel. Taste is like coffee bean flavored tonic water. It had a very dark color with what looked like a small layer of water on top. Went down like water, too easy. Definitely not impressed with this one."
"Coffee is more suitable as a before dinner beer than with dessert, and is worth a try, even though it lacks the complexity I had anticipated."
"One or two of these in an evening is probably the most I'd want to do. Also, the price of the bottle ($4) keeps this beer a fairly rare indulgence."
"Final thoughts: A very nice coffee beer. This is great for the on-the-go drinker as you can wake up in the morning and get your coffee and beer at the same time and get going. Nice malty taste and feel, lots of roasted malts, nice chocolate malts, creamy, thick, acidic, stouty, and overall well rounded and balanced, but is a little too much coffee and less beer, but a good beer especially for a beer that comes in a rocket ship."
"Coffee Porter may not be impressive in and of itself but I really like it regardless. Wish it came in 6 packs."
"Horrid experience for $4.80 single. I feel guilty reviewing what could have been an infected bottle, but as I read more (on BA and outside sources), I found this to be quite common with Meantime. So, am I reviewing the true elements of the beer? Absolutely. If it was one in a million to get a bad bottle, then I'd be wrong, but this hopefully stands as a warning to others to beware of quality control issues with this brewer."
"D: only one, too much like coffee"
"Drinkability - a good coffee porter, needs a little wait time - it does improve as the tasting progresses."
"Got this bottle at Sam's in Chicago a few months ago. Poured with a nice tan head that mostly subsided and a little lace. Color is an opaque brown. Aroma is very coffee and a little chocolate malt. Flavor was really off: very dry, and mineraly. Bitter coffee was there, of course. Also some tartness. Shoulda kept the bottle in the fridge. Can't finish it."
"D- Pretty intense flavor and heavy, could enjoy one, not more at one sitting"
"Not bad, but nowhere near as complex or as tasty as their London Porter."
"Light to medium bodied with light carbonation. Interesting to try because the coffee aspect is definitely there, but not as full bodied or full flavored as it could be. Also seems a little acidic in the finish. Overall, a decent attempt, good but not great."
"An interesting beer. Not what I was expecting. I feel like I would have liked it more if the feeling had been fuller. The taste is also dulled if its too cold."
"Hopefully the next time I can actually enjoy this one. I hate to review a beer that ended up like this but this brewery may be skipping a step before shipping."
"D and notes: I wanted a bit more out of this brew, even if it just meant kicking up the roasted barley and espresso a bit more. Maybe more hops to balance would have done the trick. I just needed something to take my mind off of the fact that I felt like I was drinking vinegar in moments. At $5 a bottle, I'd just want an all around better combo of flavors. I respect the price since co-op coffee beans are used!"
"33cl bottle. Pours clear brown-red with a small, light beige head that shrinks quickly. Heavy coffee on the nose with roasty malt. Light chocolate and some buttery notes. The coffee dies a bit in the taste, thought it's still present, to leave weak dark roasty malt. Slight bittersweet chocolate, some butterscotch, and some metallic notes. Sweeter finish. Light-medium body. Not terrible, but leagues away from some of the more characterful examples."
"Very interesting, and a more natural flavour than that of Youngs Chocolate Stout. One could argue that this is a hybrid beer rather than a porter. A real treat for those who love coffee (and caffeine!), and for everyone else, a good beer worth trying."
"Black, almost opaque in body topped by fluffy off-white head. Amazing aroma of coffee, dark roast, woodchips, and dark chocolate. Flavors of roast, woodchips, coffee, cola, and slight dark chocolate. Light in body with light-medium carb. I'd prefer a thicker mouthfeel but this is still a pleasant drink. Easily drinkable with just the right amount of roast vs. sweets."
"From the 33 ml bottle with a lot number of L8196M20. Sampled on July 20, 2009. It pours a handsome brown-black with a creamy tan head that remains about 3 mm thick on top throughout the sampling. The aroma packs a pungent punch of coffee grinds and hops. The mouthfeel is about medium texture. The taste is difficult to pin down since it is rather unusual. I would call it burnt coffee grinds and sour or overripe fruit. The flavor was not its best attribute and I expect I will never buy this again."
"Overall it's a moderately complex concoction, and is interestingly full in coffee flavor."
"Good carbonation."
"Overall impression: A roasty coffee-forward porter. The coffee flavor is a little too much for my liking (I love coffee but I also love my beer...I'd rather have more beer character) but not bad. Recommended."
"D- A really nice coffee porter. I would go back to this one again for sure."
"Nice."
"Pours black as with light brown highlights when held up to the light. A light head that laced for about half the beer. The nose is awesome! Roasted coffee beans, espresso, chicory and easter egg chocolate(that specific!). Very enticing. More of the same on the palate, extremely smooth and a little creamy. Light-medium carbonation. Mild bitterness at the back. A very easy drink and quite moreish. Good booze."
"Mouthfeel & Drinkability - Medium to full bodied mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. Finishes like you would expect a porter to finish, but with a burnt coffee aftertaste. If not for the price, I could drink a few of these in a setting. Good Brew!"
"Not bad. The coffee profile in this is a little hit or miss, showing up strong in some spots and not enough in others but it generally works well with the malts that are present. Nice look, body, and drinkibility help bring this up though."
"D--I don't even want to finish this bottle because I feel like I'm wasting my time. Take out the wonderful smell and this beer isn't even worth trying really. Mediocrity defined."
"Mouthfeel is thin and weak. Flavor is some bitter cocoa right away but this gives way to a weird sour finish. The roasted nutty characteristics I expected are absent, instead there's a thin, watery, weak mess. Not that great. I'll most likely not get this one again. Too bad. I like coffee and I like porters..."
"it pours up dark brown in color with crimson edges. nice bubbly tan head. the nose is rich coffee (not as intense of a coffee flavor as some American Coffee beers though), bittersweet malts, mint, cocoa beans. the taste is super bitter, coffee beans, nice hop burn on thy tongue, smooth malts, medium bodied, low carbo. Nice..."
"This totally fits what an English Porter would be when ya think of one, but it doesn't quite do enough for me however as its a bit unappetizing with its twisted dry and bitter burnt flavor and tone."
"Drinkability: Although the lactose is a bit of a distraction from the flavor profile, it is so subtle that if you don't think about it too much, all you really taste is the coffee"
"I was disappointed with this beer. Not sure if i was looking for more coffee or what, but it was very 1 dimensional. Mouthfeel was a bit slick and oily and it went down ok."
"This was a very interesting beer for me. I'm a fan of coffee with deep complex tastes and I've never encountered a beer quite like this one."
"Poured with a slick black appearance and huge head that left small retention. Lots of patchy lacing. Aromas have a crisp cocoa/nutty texture. Slightly burnt. An acidic taste in general, with a bitter-nutty tone. Carbonation was quite crisp but made the beer almost soda-like instead of beer-like. Overall, a decent coffee porter."
"I was disappointed by this beer. I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, it didn't seem at all like a beer to me. It tasted like bad, cold coffee. Coffee flavor is definitely present, but didn't satisfy in the way some other coffee/mocha porters do. Felt thin in the mouth and didn't have any of the body I was expecting. Not something I would try again."
"D- An enjoyable coffee beer. I am not wild about this, but I am glad I tried it. This is my first beer from the brewery and has piqued my interest in their other offerings."
"Cheers-"
"Definitely worth trying if you like coffee beers. Meantime makes some damn fine beer, but they're also very proud of themselves."
"Taste like chocolate, cacoa and dark coffee. The dark malt leaves only a trace of chocolate or coffee flavor. Most of the taste comes from the coffee and maybe some additives. It appears a little artificial."
"If you liked the taste, presumably you could drink a ton of it - it's somehow very refreshing. That said, it tastes like a cup of bad black coffee gone cold, with gunpowder and pencil lead in it, so why would you want to? Personally, I'm unlikely to buy another beer from Meantime, and I'll certainly stay the fuck away from this."
"D: Initially, I thought this was a very good beer with great coffee flavors. However, it's somewhat to sweet and the coffee flavors lack some depth. Would have liked a richer, not as, sweet coffee profile. The sweetness and taste of chocolate covered coffee beans become a little overpowering after a while. One bottle of this is almost too much. Would probably be a great dessert beer or a digestif, though."
"Nice dark brown color with a thin tan head. The aroma is remarkably nice...coffee (for sure, but not overly done), lots of roasted malts, highly roasted/burnt grains. A bit of dark bread and some coffee grinds are in the smell as well, but virtually no hop aroma. The flavor is intense...huge roasted malt flavor, tannins, cold coffee, and low hop bitterness. This is a dry beer. There is a little oiliness in the taste and mouthfeel that are at once both distracting and engaging. Full, satisfying, and interesting. This one is certainly worth a try. In my opinion, the coffee is well done, not espresso-like at all, it isn't overpowering and plays well with the malt character of the brew."
"Pours a dark, dark brown with a nice initial head that remains for a good deal of time. Smell is a blend of dark bitter coffee balanced by a malt presence. Taste folows the nose wutha strong almost espresso quality, balanced with a malt sweetness that finsihes very dry. Mouthfeel is mainly dry an dmedium bodied. Drinkability is fine for those who like a nice dry finish."
"Out of a bottle this beer was a very dark, chestnut color with three fingers of tan head. The retention was ok, the lacing was very good and consistent. The aroma was dry and bitter, clearly a mix of coffee, roasted malt and charcoal. The flavors were slightly sweet at first with some chocolate malt but it then quickly went dry with lots of roasted malt, lots of bitter coffee and a tight, acidic finish. The mouthfeel was average, the carbonation medium and the body medium/full. If you like espresso or black coffee, this is a great beer for you. But I felt it was rather one-dimensional and despite the lighter body for the style it was too acidic to be sessionable."
"D: Decently drinkable, but I wish it was cheaper."
"While I am able to finish the bottle, I won't be buying this one again and remain optimistic about the rest of the coffee stouts I procured (before attempting to brew that style)."
"Notes: 330 ml bottle poured into an Imperial Pint Glass. BBE 04/11/11."
"Smooth and full mouthfeel with nice viscosity. I'm impressed with this porter, and at a fairly reasonably price I'll probably seek it out again."
"It pours a jet black color into my shaker glass with a wispy head, and minimal lacing on the glass. Slightly pungent coffee smell greats the nose. The taste has an espresso bitterness, with a little roasted malt underneath, and no hops really to speak of. I like that there is no sweetness to this brew, and they let all that coffee bitterness shine through. The problem I had that was all that strong bitter coffee just sat on top of a light roasted malty brew, and the coffee really didn't tie all the ingredients together. The mouth feel was rather thin for a porter, and with all that coffee bitterness, it sure wasn't an easy drinking brew."
"Last but not least, this beer definitely gave me a caffeine buzz!"
"If you like iced coffee (without cream), then this is a beer for you. Otherwise, it's too much of a one-trick pony."
"Easy drinker, smooth, but not amazing. After seeking it out, I wouldn't seek it out. Lots of better porters available."
"Easy to drink. Could drink more if the metal was gone."
"D - Quite a disappointment, seeing as how much I loved the regular porter"
"I was really looking forward to trying this one as I enjoyed the London Porter, but I was a little disappointed. I love coffee beers and this one is just too bitter and acidic for my liking."
"First couple of sips were very lacking. Much too watery for a porter. Lacking complexity. One could argue this is a brown ale with coffee. Really expected a fuller body and malt profile. The coffee is well balanced but in this case, it's not a good thing assume the porter aspect of this beer is so weak."
"Overall, just an OK Porter, that's a little too filling for the style."
"This beer's strength is it's smell. It smells like a fresh, strong-brewed pot of coffee. Makes me want to pair it with a hearty stew or a plate of bacon. But the taste doesn't come through. It's not terrible by any means, but there's a sparkling mouthfeel that's almost reminiscent of champagne. There's a slight sour taste, and I'm missing the bitterness prevalent in most coffee beers. It lacks body, which is disappointing. A shame - this beer had so much promise from that wonderful aroma."
"Not worth the $5 I paid (at a store where truly excellent dark beers, e.g. Dragonstooth, are only $5.50 for 22oz)."
"D- I'm glad i got the small version as I really don't see myself drinking more than that. MCP came off a bit thin and not complex enough for my liking but it is a foreign style porter and I need more experience with. Perhaps on a cask this would be better but i don't see myself having that chance soon. This is a respectable porter though."
"Overall: An amazing amount of coffee added to this beer. There is a good malt complex with a hint of hops to the beer. The mouth feel is astringent but soft. The finish linger for a few moment on the palate and it is rather refreshing. The beer is wonderful a great coffee flavor to the beer with the supporting porter characters."
"This beer pours a deep dark brown - some ruby highlights to it when held up to the light. There is a huge, rocky, fluffy head on the pour - even though it was a slow pour. Great head retention and left huge chunky lacing behind. Nose is of - well coffee, some toffee and some vanilla and chocolate notes as well. Taste is a well balance of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and vanilla. This is a smooth beer! Mouthfeel is a bit light, however - well carbonated and silky smooth on the tongue. This was a great little beer!"
"Drinkability is ehh flavors are wonderful carbonation makes me not want another, not sure if my bottle is normal or not but mellow it out and it would be wonderful."
"Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, tannic, acidic, tart, astringent."
"D: A little too much coffee to be drinkable, a little extreme and on the not so much of a beer side of the spectrum. An interesting take on the style, but as I said before, just too much coffee, it really pushes everything around."
"Overall it is pretty good coffee beer I think but I will not go out of my way to get it again."
"poured into my duvel tulip glass, poured a thin black with a two finger head that rises to the top and quickley goes down to a thin lacing around the rim of the glass, the smell is coffiee and hops, the taste is a sightly sour malt with coffiee and some baking coco then a huge rush of grassey bitter hops, the beer is wattery at best and thers not enough hops in the mix. just an avrage offering"
"Meantime Coffee Porter pours a dark brown with a huge tan head from a 11.2 ounce brown bottle (a very cool custom shaped bottle). There is a very strong coffee aroma which is very nice. The flavor is strongly coffee flavored as well, there is also a little bit of vanilla present. Really nicely done."
"As a beer, this guy is well brewed and very interesting conceptually. As a porter, it's just barely above average. As an experimental brew, it's a notch above many of the others in it's category. I don't think I'll be seeking this one out again, but that's not to say I didn't enjoy it."
"I was intrigued by the style when I first spotted it on the shelf and I had a good experience with the IPA but this one leaves alot to be desired. Has a very strong coffee smell upon the initial pour and that translates over your tastebuds on the fist sip. One of the disappointing issues I found is that flavour is lost upon successive drinks unless you allow some time to pass between quaffs. It also contains a strong citrus flavor in the background which I'm attributing to the yeast strain. This brew, without the ""coffee flavouring", seems like it would be a formidable beer but definitely NOT a porter."
"OVERALL: If you like coffee, you'll love this. This is definitely a coffee porter and it performs just like it advertises. Would make a great desert beer. The appearance is a little lack luster, and the aftertaste can become overwhelming after a while, but overall this is a great beer for what it is. I don't think I could drink more than one though."
"D: Great beer. The coffee is clean and delicious."
"D: Glad I split this. A nice after dinner treat but the coffee is too over the top."
"Pours dark brown with a tan head and havy lacing. Aroma is stale coffee, almonds, licorice, and baker's chocolate. Thin mouthfeel. Tastes like coffee and roasted malt, without anything more. Cream? Nuts? Anything? Expected something more, especially for the price tag."
"The taste is rich, darkly fruity with coffee, a hint of sweet-sour stewed fruit, and a dryish finish with faint bitterness, characterised by dry leaves with elements of coffee and chocolate. It is wonderfulyl tasty, nicely balanced, and very drinkable."
"A bit more unusual than I expected but the sourness works fine for me. I like it, wish it was less expensive. Not your normal porter."
"Overall, a well drinkable porter. Very appropriate for curling up in front of a fire or for an early morning drinker. Probably not something I would drink on a daily basis, mainly because of the price. Good, quality coffee porter."
"Drinkability: Well that's what I get for being attracted to neat-looking bottles. It seems like there's a really good coffee porter in here somewhere, buried under some funk. Alas, this one was capped tight, and bad a best before date of March 11th, 2011. The pricetag - $4.69 for a 12 oz. bottle - is steep enough such that I may have trouble trying this one again too. A shame."
"D- A very nice beer overall. The coffee flavor is not overdone at all and gives a wonderful mocha/chocolate flavor to a very well done porter."
"11.2 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pretty beer: dark brown with red highlights, thick tan head. Coffee/roasted malt aroma, with a hint of sweet chocolate. Taste was more coffee/espresso, little bit of chocolate, some bitterness. I enjoyed the bitterness, thought it rounded things out quite well."
"Very, very nice."
"Semi-sweet bitter cocoa infused with an ultra bitter black coffee from start to finish with a blunt bitter end. Ultra roasty coffee ground flavor that is on the edge of tasting burnt and extremely bitter throughout. Medium body that fluffs in the mouth, then leaves with a bitter, slightly acidic tingle on the tongue, aided by the carbonation. The alcohol is undetectable and burried in the bitterness. Not an easy drinker due too the extreme overall bitterness of this brew. A wake-up and smell the coffee Porter it is."
"This won't overpower your senses but if you like porter and coffee, this should be on your list."
"I like this, and am glad to have tried it, but I don't know that I'd reach for it again. I'd opt for a Baltic porter when wanting something like a porter, and would rather go for Southern Tier's Jahva or Founder's Breakfast Stout when needing that certain something only a coffee-flavored beer can deliver."
"M&D: very well bottle-conditioned, showing only the softest carbonation throughout the drink, and the body remains moderate until reaching a lightly acidic end. I think the addition of coffee beans has hugely compromised the beer base that presumably is meant to be a Porter(?), as the sweet edge comes a bit overpowering and the coffee aroma too seductive for the more traditional (read ""understated"") winey/prune-ish sourness of a Porter to come through. If, however, forgetting about the name altogether, this is a successful coffee beer that comes with reasonable complexity, a good body of coffee-malts and a decent depth of roastiness and hop bitterness in the end to satisfy various preferences. A well-made beer definitely worth a try!"
"a very deep chestnut to brown amber with quite a small head. smell is wood chips and coffee... well more like coffee grounds. quite strong. sort of the lighter roast with a bit of acidic quality to it. acid comes out in the taste. so does the stale. tastes quite like stale decent coffee... the malt is very weak. sort of disappointed about that. doesn't seem to blend well on the palate. acidic quality seems to take the upper hand. hints of woody stored quality... not much there. hint of smoke. not much compared to that stale coffee acid. meh. at the price probably won't have this one again."
"Pretty good coffee porter. The price was a bit high (~$4-5) but it was worth it. Try it if you like coffee and/or porter."
"Mouthfeel is bold and full bodied. Subtle carbonation. Very smooth."
"D-No thanks i'll finish this one but the fact it was in my fridge this long with alot of buildup was a huge letdown"
"d: Good stuff, I've been loving my coffee brews lately."
"Pours a four finger light tan head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving traces of lace. Deep mahogany color. Roasted coffee nose. Good carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Flavor is sweet roasted coffee, smooth. Nice porter but bottle is too small. $3.50 for a 330ml bottle from Tully's Beer & Wine Wells, Me."
"I recommend this beer to any discerning porter fan. If you want an alternative to Guinness and ESB most likely seen in London and fancy a porter than give this a try. Of note I don't know how it travels as I picked it up in London."
"Overall a decent porter. Not the fresh coffee aromas and flavors I was hoping for though."
"D - Were it not for the $4.29 pricetag, I could drink this all day. True porter devotees will probably slam this, but it is a very interesting take on the style."
"D: Not too bad, but the citrus sourness might hold me back - I was hoping for more coffee smoothness."
"Poured a dark brown with a decent head. Smells of black coffee with some roastiness in the background. I usually like some creaminess in the smell as well when coffee is involved, but this works. The taste is similar with more black coffee flavors and roasted grain notes, but this time there is a touch of cream at the end. There is also a hint of black fruit under the coffee and roast. Its a bit thinner than I would like and surprisingly light, but quite smooth. I enjoyed this, but perhaps not quite as much as I was expecting. I would have liked a bit more body or intensity- without necessarily raising the abv."
"This was a very interesting experience. Overall I didn't really like this beer, though I can appreciate what it's trying to be. Still, it's very intense, largely one dimensional, devoid of standard malt character, and more sour than it needs to be."
"The coffee is all over the aroma and smells like a nice medium roast, nothing too dark. The flavor continues with more big coffee with a slight sweetness, like a touch of cream and sugar was added, in the background. I can tell there's beer in the background, it reminds me more of a smooth brown ale however, and has a small dash of grassy hops. Worth a try if you dig coffee beers."
"D: Very drinkable. Couldn't have more than two probably, but they would go down easy. I agree with others in saying this is the best coffee beer I've ever had."
"Probably the best coffee beer I've had."
"Dark brown and clear with mahogany highlights. An inch thick cap appeared after the pour, but this receded quickly to a solid collar of beige bubbles and a fine skim sitting on top of the beer. Plenty of bubbles clung to the glass between sips, leaving a smattering of lace behind. The aroma -- coffee. Nutty and roasty with a hint of bittersweet chocolate. There just wasn't room for much else. Coffee and roast were prominent in the flavour, but caramel sweetness cut through from start to finish. Bitterness was moderate and lasted through the end and the coffee flavour rounded out the finish. The body was a little on the thin side, but still worked. Carbonation was average, texture a little dry from the dark grains. Quite a good coffee porter, quite drinkable even for someone who doesn't drink coffee."
"D: I should have taken a bottle for the road. A stunning porter from Meantime."
"Medium-bodied, plenty of carbonation that fits the drink well, and nicely drinkable. Great breakfast beer."
"D: This one is very drinkable. i could see this beer being nice at a late breakfast. Very tasty overall."
"Drinkability: Like I stated before, it's not the most complex coffee porter out there, but at least it's decent. It had a nice level of roasted espresso beans to it, but there wasn't much after that. A little bit more of a variety is what this beer needs. Alone, it's just a decent espresso beer."
"Served in a nonic. Pourd a dark brown; not quite opaque as there was some light penetration that revealed ruby red highlights. Half inch off-white head quickly settled into a consistent skim of foam. Some watery sheets of lacing present during the tasting. Scent of roasted coffee, but without a sweet character as is often found in some ""coffee"" beers. Coffee flavor is also pronounced in the mouth, but not as big as the nose, followed by a citrus quality with a spent coffee ground aftertaste. Mouthfeel is a little too light and effervescent for the style in my opinion. Drinkability is average; it went down easy and alcohol is well-hidden, but not a high scorer for me."
"D: Insanely drinkable, I haven't even given it a chance to warm up enough yet and I just want to keep drinking it, its just so good, well balanced and sort of fruity (tangerine comes to mind in the aftertaste). After so many times of passing this funny looking bottle up I finally grabbed it and am more than happy that I did."
"drinkability: pretty good"
"D: The small size makes it rather drinkable. Would be good morning, noon, or night."
"I would buy this one again when I need a coffee beer fix or would want beer with breakfast."
"Worth it to check out. May not be the best out there but it offers a great drinking experience."
"decent and interesting, but not something i'd likely seek out again."
"D: You'd better like coffe. Tastes more like a cup of black coffe than beer. I would like to try this with desert or a donut."
"Overall, a pleasant surprise. This is a nice coffee beer. Initially it's a nice blend of sweet chocolate and coffee. As it warms, it becomes a little too acidic."
"Easy-drinking. Bottle notes that it's equivalent to a cup of coffee. Minus the caffeine content, I could easily drink 3 or more pints. Balanced roasty malt and floral hops."
"D - Good. A solid coffee porter - I would have no quarrel with savoring this fine brew another time."
"The taste has a strong coffee presence, delicious roasted flavors followed by a soft gentle carbonation a bit watery with a nice bitterness to back up the roasted coffee, nut, flavor quality porter session quality...more please!"
"I got this Meantime Coffee Porter from the Grapevine in Pocatello, Idaho. It's a very nice brew, but not perfect for this style if you ask me. It was a bit thin and light in color. Lots of carbonation, but the smell was kickin' some serious coffee with hints of nut and chocolate. I enjoyed drinking this brew, but did hope for something more. It drinks lighter than my preferred porters like Flag and Black Butte; frankly it drank more like a doppelbock plus the bionic coffee. I just can't get over the smells from this nice beer. It's sooo very nice and deep. The pour was decent, but not much head to it. It poured with about 1 finger which died off within a few minutes and didn't leave much lace at all. This beer would have been better for me if it was just thicker and if it had a bit richer mouth feel to it. It drank with a bit more alcohol on the toungue than I expected from a 6% porter. Anyhow...a very good drink. It's an especially good one that you can sit back and sniff for a bit. Nice sipper!"
"A great English Porter. Try some."
"As for drinkability, i am happy to report it is only 6% because i could easily suck down several of these in no time flat without question... a VERY easily consumed beverage. I will definitely try to keep one or two of these in the DBF for those times where a cup of coffee just wont do and i need the added bonus of alcohol ;)"
"D: Drinkability is disgustingly high. So easy to drink."
"Highly, recommended to try again."
"Overall I think this is a good coffee porter. I like the little info it says on the back label ""Each serving is equal to one cup of coffee."""
"Poured into a standard pint glass a medium to dark brown with a nicely formed almost 1/2 finger off white head head,naturally the coffee aromas hit ya along with some woody tones and unsweetened chocolate.Coffee is domanant on the palate but is not the only thing worth mentioning its quite arthy with some noticeable wood,a bit of sweetness comesthru but to me its unsweetened dark roast coffee that dominates.A very nice coffee infused porter just well rounded and solid."
"A very tasty example of the style, but not a truly earthshattering one. While I find it goes down very easily, I'm not sure it warrants $6 for an 11.2oz bottle. If someone in my area carried it for less (and Enoteca seems just about the most expensive beer store in the area), I'd probably buy it semi-regularly."
"The flavor virtually explodes in your mouth. Much more aggressive and vigorous in flavor than most porters. The coffee is more than noticeable and if not in perfect balance with the dark malts, it asserts itself in a slightly over the top, but all the better for it, way. I wouldn't want them to pull back at all. This is definitely one that I'll be looking for in the future, especially after The Wife's lustful reaction to it. She loved it."
" a word: Quality. A very well-rounded brew."
"Mouthfeel is a little to thin for my tastes. Very soft and subtle carbonation that I do enjoy. I won't be reaching for this again soon, but it is interesting. If the English style suits your taste you may enjoy this more than I have."
"D - Wouldn't want 2 in a row but it is a very nice sipper every now and then."
"Overall - Well I cant really say much about this porter, its fine, does exactly what it says on the tin. It didnt blow my mind or disappoint."
"There are certainly better coffee beers out there. This one was a little too unbalanced and one dimensional for me."
"Overall - An average stout... glad i tried it but i doubt i would try it again..."
"Overall, this was a very solid coffee porter. Not the best, but I have had some good ones, but still very solid and a classic representation of the style. There is no doubt I would try this one again anytime, it was very good."
"The coffee in this beer ain't subtle. It pours a ruby-tinged brown, with a latte-colored head (okay, that might be the power of suggestion). Aroma is mostly coffee, same for the fllavor, with some pleasantly sour, vaguely fruity undertones. The deeper I got into the bottle, though, the more I noticed some real chocolate presence. Interesting. I would have guessed it had more alcohol. Not bad."
"Definitely recommended as a true and authentic depiction of the style..."
"Body settles to a jet black with only hints of ruby and brown when held to light. An inch and a half of rich tan head and has nice retention. It does leave a bit of lace as it fades. Nose is wonderfully rich with huge fresh coffee notes, toasty malt and some vanilla dark fruit. Enters the mouth massivelly zesty with a nice richness from the coffee and malt backbone. Quickly balanced by a hoppy feel and minerals intertwined with a healthy dose of spiceyness. A hint of malty sweetness shows itself on the back half of the palate. I would probably call this a baltic porter. Mouthfel is well received. Attractively drinkable coffee based brew."
"I was expecting more flavour to this, it's very one dimensional."
"I expected more from Meantime as I have been impressed with other offerings I have tried."
"Mouthfeel isn't as dry as a roasty beer usually would be, and leaves some stickiness after the swallow. Carbonation is a little high but this beer is so tasty that it's hard to stop drinking."
"Pours a deep brown color with ruby highlights at the edges. A decent tan head that dissipated into a sparse cap. The smell is of cold sweetened coffee that has been sitting around for a while, a bit chocolately as well. A big coffee grounds flavor, rust and some dark chocolate. Not a very robust coffee flavor like a french roast but definitely a strong coffee presence. The feel is light with semi soft carbonation; the brew finishes with a black coffee bitterness. An interesting brew in an interesting bottle. I'm glad the feel was on the thin side as it makes this beer more drinkable."
"Other Notes: This beer is also the winner of multiple awards. The most recent coming from the International Beer Challenge (October 2007), where this won World's Best Stout & Porter up to 6.9%."
"Not a super full body like I expected, actually a rather refreshing well carbonated beer. Goes down extremely smooth and is nothing short of seriously enjoyable. I don't remember how much I paid for this but I'm glad to finally try a Meantime beer. Definitely recommended for the coffee and beer lover. Kind of makes me wish it was morning with a fresh mug of sumatra."
"Pours a very dark brown with burgundy hues poking through when held to light. Great, frothy, tan head that lingers awhile, leaving lacing behind in it's wake. Smells of coffee of course, sweet malts, milk chocolate. Taste is also of sweet coffee. Like an extra/extra at Dunkin Donuts. This stuff is dangerously smooth. A little light on the body but the addictiveness more than makes up for it. So damn tasty. I could drink these all evening. Before I know it, my pint is empty every time. Sweet bottle to boot."
"Drinkability: I could drink several of these in a row... But I don't think I could do it all night. This beer was a little watered down for my tastes, but it didn't take away from it being enjoyable. Try it out if you if you see one... But don't expect a world class porter... Just an above average"
"D: I would rate this much more drinkable than some of the coffee-bomb imperial stouts I have sampled, but personally, I would reserve this strictly for after-dinner, or an end-of-session sipper. It goes down smooth and tasty, but I wouldn't consider it a session brew."
"D: A really good beer, I'm glad I finally tried it, any coffee drinker would dig this stuff."
"D: Good stuff. Slightly thin and quite bitter and very tasty."
"Very dark brown with good clarity. Aroma of iced espresso. Strong bitter aromatic notes. Initial flavor of fizzy iced espresso, but more depth came out as beer warmed. Slight sweetness and chocolate malt favors in background. Light, effervescent mouthfeel. Slightly bitter finish. Nice beer, but I remember this being better last time I had it."
"D- Yes, very drinkable...if you like coffee."
"Md mouthfeel is appropriate, but carbonation doesn't really work for me. Large bubbles foam up on the tongue in a soapy manner."
"This is a great brew. An exceptional accompaniment to breakfast or brunch. It has a great drinkablilty for a coffee flavored English porter! A coffee and beer-lover's delight!"
"Dark cola brown with a nice tan head of foam that makes a nice cap for this fantabulous brew. Aromas of COFFEE, seriously, fresh brewed extreme coffee. The roasted malt, hop and other aromas are drowned out by the espresso nose and flavor of this brew. This is probably the purest expression of coffee that I have ever had in an Enlgish beer. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, drinkability is great. COFFEE!"
"Not much head, was pretty full bodied. Would be great to use in some food recipes, especially desserts."
"Bottle bought at City Wide in Mishawaka. Pours dark brown with traces of crimson. Thin, nicely maintained light khaki head. Strong lacing doesn't fall apart. Massive coffee odor. Strong and not metallic, as some big coffee beers tend to be. Hints of chocolate truffles. Taste is huge and full of coffee as well. Balanced well with a creamy chocolate and malt backbone. Vague hints of dark fruits. Mouthfeel is creamy, melted ice cream. Nice. This is a big time delicious coffee loaded porter."
"D: Really a delightful drinking beer that is a go to for a great tasting porter."
"d: Exceptional drinkability. Much easier going than many coffee beers. Flavor isn't overwhelming, but coffee wont be missed. Not too sweet. An easy drinking porter and very good coffee beer."
"D: awesome. great all around. Glad I picked up a couple of these."
"The little 11.2 oz bottle. Poured a medium cola color, with a nice, thick, tan head. Wonderful smell that drifted out of the glass before I even got my nose near it. The taste is absolutely fabulous, well-balanced, enough of a coffee taste to taste rich without being cartoonish, and a smooth. Perhaps a bit pricey, but definitely one of the best English Porters on the market."
"Nice looking bottle. Same for the beer. Pours clear, but pretty dark brown with a ruby hue when held to light. Sizeable creme head. Quite a bit of lace as it drops. Definite coffee on the nose, but not really in a hijacking way. Minor roasted tones over a seriously thick malty edge. Flavor is smokey and very nicely robust. Super smooth on the mouth. Very drinkable, though it might be even better to down if I was sitting by a fire with all the lights in the room off."
"Very drinkable desert beer had it with some chocolate ice cream and enjoyed every bit of it will defiantly do it again"
"Fairtrade Araba Burbon beans from Rwanda. Pours a dark opaque red color with a rocky 2 finger reddish-tan head which exhibited a good retention and nice lacing left behind on the glass. The nose brings a rich, fresh roasted coffee aroma with some dark licorice, dried cherries, dry chocolate, and subtle smoky notes. The flavor is a very deep dark roasted nature full or rich black coffee beans. The mouthful is full bodied and slightly oily and leaves a smoky dark roasted malt lacing on the tongue. There is a nice acrid minerality to the palate as well. There is some nice dry earthy hop bittering and campfire charred woodiness. The finish, while short, is full roasted, dark, and gently fades leaving a nice grainy coffee residual coating of black coffee grinds behind. Overall a solid good british style coffee porter with the richness and dark roasted nature you would come to expect from this style. A nice coffee grind fade leaves a gentle reminder of the full roasted heartiness of this drink leaving you wanting more to wash it down."
"I'm really surprised how well the coffee went with this. Having had coffee stouts and not porters, I thought that the coffee may be too intense for a porter. But the coffeee character in this one is very balanced. As someone who is very hit or miss with porters, I feel like the coffee flavor helped to make up for many of the shortcomings I usually have regarding porters."
"Notes: A worthy brew. Reccomended with bacon and eggs."
"11.2 fl oz brown bottle from Lighthouse in Manchester. Pours a dark reddish-brown with ruby-red highlights and a half inch of tan head that dissipates rather quickly leaving virtually no lacing. Smells strongly of dark chocolate with heavy chocolate notes. Tastes like dark chocolate overwhelmingly, with coffee playing a strong role too. Chocolate dominates the finish. Slight hop bitterness and astringency are noticeable toward the finish too. Unexpectedly rich full body with just enough carbonation to keep this one drinkable. One sip definitely invites another, and this one goes quickly. Phenomenal. A very solid full flavored full-bodied porter with no noticeable flaws, and well worth the price."
"D - A nice ale w/ coffee focus. More of an English Porter w/ a more subdued malt taste. One was enough for me, yet has a great aroma - definitely worth a try. Possibly more drinkability if less effervessence were there, it falt like some of the malt flavor was diverted. I very tasty coffee beer overall."
"The body is fairly thin, and the carbonation is light and smooth, providing a fairly thin yet creamy mouthfeel. Very easy to drink."
"The taste is like the freshest cup of coffee. Reminds me a bit of Peche Mortel or Breakfast Stout for obvious reasons. It's pretty heavy on the coffee and i'm having trouble identifying other stuff. But it does so well with soreading the taste that I'm in love with it. Light body. Amazing after taste."
"Drinkability is excellent. I found sipping this while watching an old movie to be a pleasure."
"Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1 1/4"" tan head over the clear burgundy brew. Head fades sedately, with heavy sticking froth lace. Aroma is sweetness and coffee. Taste is muted lightly bitter dark maltiness, with not nearly as much coffee character as I expected. Mouthfeel is a tad on the prickly carbonated side, with a bit above average drinkability. Sort of went downhill from the great start, but still a pretty good brew overall."
"Meantime Coffee Porter pours a clear red brown with a thin off white head. The aroma is roasted and chocolate malts, with some caramel and an earthy smell I identify with coffee but I'm not sure I would have made that leap if it was not on the bottle. I also smell a hint of Ringwood like yeast but that may be just be seeping out of my pores. The flavor is dry and roasty, with any sweetness from the malt is covered by an astringent coffee flavor. The coffee is more prevelent in the aftertaste, but overall I'm not sure it adds too much to the beer. It's kind of a stale coffee flavor."
"Overall, a very nice beer, but not one i would want often, much less 2 in one night."
"D, notes: An enjoyable beer. Tasted very fresh despite the travel distance. Easily drinkable. Overall very well done."
"PS nice looking bottle."
"Drinkability- Simple and not complex...just good old fashioned coffee. Definitely sessionable, especially for coffee lovers. Would like a touch more sweetness, but then again, it's not supposed to be sweet like a baltic. Quality at any rate."
"Prosit, MK"
"I like the premise and I have a good friend that raves about meantime brews. I'll try them again, just a different brew."
"I've been pleased with all three of the Meantime Brewing Company beers that I've had so far. Coffee Porter is a nice little (caffeinated) treat that will please your palate as it energizes your body and your brain. Not only that, but the bottle is a keeper."
"I don't know what is up in Boise, but there are way more cool and new beers available than years past. I know most are imported by Shelton Bros, but I hope it keeps up. I also know Ericksons Fine Wine in Eagle has this fine brew available .... Erickson's also has the Meantime IPA ... New Vintage did not at purchase time."
"A little pricey for a single bottle, when there are some domestic examples that are just as good. Regardless if you're a coffee beer fan, this is worth a try."
"D - An interesting take on the English Porter, what with the addition of actual coffee grinds in the brewing process. Alcohol is not a factor and the flavors never wavers or offends as this beer warms. Another solid and tasty brew from Meantime."
"D: Not even close to an abv monster, but still enough (6%) to get your attention. From an 11.2oz bottle, this seems fitting. And for all my talk about how strong the coffee notes are in the bouquet and on the palate, this is really a treat, and isn't too over-the-top, but definitely makes its presence known. If you're expecting a run-of-the-mill porter with a faint coffee tinge, then you'd be disappointed, but if you're looking for that fresh grounds fix, this is your porter, my friend."
"Overall- A tasty desert beer without a doubt. Why only 11.2 oz?! I would like this in a 22oz."
"drinkability is good. well balanced and very enjoyable. i liked the nice mellow coffee character, allowing it to accent rather than dominate."
"Really, get one thru trade or put on your wants, top notch drinker."
"Poured a very deep brown almost black that shows some ruby highlights when held to light. There is a decent sized head that diminishes to a thin layer. Aroma is dark malts and freshly ground coffee. The taste is a great balance of dark malts and coffee. The beer is light to medium bodied with low carbonation. This is certainly a very enjoyable brew!"
"-this would be a starter drink, i could only have one, i will have this beer again."
"Pours a clear dark orange/brown, massively thick tan head forms, big chunks of lace, great retention, this head never wants to leave. Smell is roasty coffee, caramel, iron, floral hops, chocolate, roast, pretty intense coffee. Taste is very intense toffee, chocolate, coffee roast, definitely a porter, sweet cherry like finish, nice roasty bitterness. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with high carbonation. Pretty nice, aroma/flavour is real good, but the body/carbonation is not too appealing."
"A very tasty beer, full of coffee flavour."
"A darn decent beer! I was lucky enough to try this at a beer festival and I am glad I stumbled across this booth. It is a dark pour with a soft minimal head. Definitely in my book a dessert beer. It has a strong coffee flavor and is a little sweet with a light (british) carbonation. This beer dances on your taste buds and if you are trying to talk your wife into beer, this is the one that will make her want to have a cold one with you. One of my top 10, try it if you can find it."
"I'm glad I picked up this bottle. The price was decent enough and I'd never heard of this brewery."
"D: Easy to enjoy, and sip on. Would be good with desert, chocolate, etc. I would buy this again it is one of the better coffee porters Ive had."
"Pours a clear mahogany color with a stiff full finger light tan head that resists fading. Big chunks of lacing garner the glass. The smell is a beefy semi-sweet mocha malt. Medium bodied, the mouth feel is adequately carbonated. Full flavored, the taste of choco-java is present without a heavy roasted character so it finishes cleaner. A nice drinker."
"Overall: a very excellent beer that is well done, especially if you like coffee, which I don't for the most part but still like this beer a lot and would order it in a heartbeat. Coffee lovers should really love."
"The beer was dark burgandy brown colored, just barely clear, thin whitish head. The aroma was coffee and malty beer, I would have sworn it was Breakfast Stout except the appearance wasn't as nice. The taste was mostly coffee with some sweet malt, and the beer had enough physical presence that I suspected it had lots more malt in the bill than the 6% alcohol content reveals it to have. Very nice, too bad it's not so easily available."
"D: Black coffee is not my cup of tea, so one of these is good for me, but is a fine example of a coffee beer! Maybe I could have two of these."
"Drinkability: Tastes far better than it smells. Also, the bottle sure is a beaut! Getting only 330ml never looked so good."
"D- The coffee is big and stale and the malt taste reminds me of a weak American bock. The flavor is not that impressive but the head last and last. I’m not sure I want to commit to the big bottles of Meantime but I’m glad they only sell this in a small bottle. That is enough."
"Drinks too easy, this is my kind of coffee porter/stout!"
"Into a chalice, pours an obsidian brown, very dark, a off-tan head of half an inch settling to a thing film, lacing falling in sheets down the glass. The aroma is intensely aromatic coffees, ground, roasted, almost charred, black patent malts have to be in there, a tad nutty. The taste is even more dominated by the bean, almost a mean streak, a bite accompanying a rise in carbonation through the middle, then settling into softer coffee and nutty tones, and the tongue is left prickling from the carbonation. The body is relatively full, particularly after warming. Overall, I'd say this is a pretty decent beer, not my cup of... erm, tea?, but it'll do, a decent coffee porter."
"Drinkability is above par. This is a coffee lover's coffee beer. Many coffee beers aren't good coffee or good beer--Meantime Coffee Porter wins awards for both."
"Cool looking 11.2 oz bottle. Pours a clear mahogany body with a small, but lasting, beige head. Some curtains of lace drape around the glass. Aroma is freshly ground coffee beans and milk chocolate graced by toasted almonds. Medium body is well carbonated. Taste is dark chocolate and coffee grounds accented by notes of cream and almonds. Nicely executed."
"This brew pours a dark brown color with ruby hues around the edges. The head is monsterous, especailly for a coffee beer. It is two inches high, creamy, fluffy, and recedes very slowly into chunky lacing. The aroma is of coffee grounds, nuts, sweet milk chocolate, bitter dark chocolate, and cream. The taste has quite a bit more coffee to it than the aroma. Chocolate and cream rounds out the coffee flavors in the sip, while the finish in pleasantly nutty. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with fine, lively carbonation. Overall, this beer is does not have as much coffee in it as most American coffee beers. However, adding more coffee to this beer would probably mask too many of its other flavors and aromas, and I think that would be a shame. I like this beer a lot. I would drink it if I was in the mood for something with a punch-you-in-the-mouth coffee taste to it. However, if in the mood for a well design, not over the top porter this would certainly do the trick."
"lighter then what i expected but it still has great body."
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, roasted scent that boasts of crystal, patent, and roasted malts. It's slightly bitter and quite earthy. The taste is great. It has a bold coffee taste up front, but it mellows out in the finish. It has a light chocolate sweetness that rounds out the flavor. It's still dry and earthy, but not over the top. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn good porter. The coffee blends in well and adds a bunch of character to the taste; a good drinker."
"Definitely a big winner from Meantime. I wish I could remember what I paid for this bottle, but I fear it was too much to make it a regular drinker. But in the meantime, so to speak, I'll enjoy this one - a great beer."
"I bought his due to the fact that I enjoyed their IPA. This was in an odd, 11.2 oz bottle that was shaped more like the 750ml their other beers are available in. The label notes that one serving is equal to one cup of coffee so this should be interesting. The color was brown but light enough to see through if held to a light. The head is short and light tan in color. The smell is like ground coffee beans and malt. The taste is sweet like maple syrup and a little milky-lactose but oddly not much coffee flavor, just a hint of coffee bitterness in the background. The more this warms up, the more the coffee takes over. This one was just average to me. If porters or coffee beers are your thing then by all means try this one. If you dont usually seek out porters specifically you can skip this one."
"11.2 oz bottle. My glass is filled with deep brown liquid with a finger of ivory to light tan head that falls to a full coat atop the beer. There is very little carbonation after the initial pour and clarity is excellent. The nose on this one screams coffee to me. Lots of iced-coffee tones with a solid roasted backbone behind it. The coffee dominates and obscures any other aromas that might be in there. The flavor is a nice balance. The initial flavor hits coffee..very full coffee. This fades after a long stay on my tongue to chocolate and roasted malt notes, with a mild bitterness that brings coffee back to mind. The flavors are good. There is definitely a dominant coffee but the base beer comes through towards the end. Mouthfeel is thick, with a light to moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is a little thick for the flavor in my opinion. Overall, this is a little skewed to the coffee, but that means truth in advertising. I would gladly have it again, as the slant in one direction doesn't bug me too much, as I love some nice robust coffee."
"Recommended. If you like coffee, I highly recommend you try this. And this brew from Meantime comes in a cool looking 330ml bottle, so you don't even have to commit to their standard 750ml size."
"Final Comments: I have to agree with the first reviewer and say that this is one of the best coffee infused beers I have ever had. It was very well put together with all of the ingredients working in harmony to deliver a wonderful product. Well done Meantime!"
"This beer is dialed in a wonderful. It's one of the best coffee-infused beers I've had."
"For the past couple of years, the only things we got from Meantime out here on the west coast were 750s of IPA and Porter. I've had those and been impressed, so I went for the Coffee Porter as soon as I found it. Besides, they have cool labels with a Victorian mechanical feel...über-hip. I'm not usually terribly thrilled with odd ingredients in beer, beyond the traditional four, but the porter-stout range of the style spectrum is fairly easily doctored to drinkable effect. There have been others out there to use coffee in the dark ale, (Speedway Stout from Alesmith leaps to mind -- excellent stuff) some more successful than others. Meantime's coffee beer is pretty well-paired with the coffee, but I find I prefer a more substantial body with richer malt character to offset the bitterness of the coffee. On the other hand, comparing this to Speedway for drinkability, I could go through a few of these and still function. Consumption of an equivalent quantity of Speedway may provide you with sufficient caffeine alertness for you to put your arms up before your face hits the floor. In the meantime, I'm going to keep an eye out for more Meantime products as they filter out to this coast."
"D: If you can drink several cups of coffee you can drink several bottles of this beer."
"Very drinkable and has its fair share of interesting interrelationships. All in all this is probably best on a weekend morning."
"Seems like a good way to wake up and drink at the same time in preparation for more beers to come. Hooray for the mix of stimulants and depressants! Pretty much its a light bodied, low-alcohol beer thats good if you (really) like coffee. I enjoyed it."
"Served chilled, in a chalice."
"Drinkability- I really enjoyed this beer. I'm not a big coffee fan but this beer was good."
"Cheers."
"D- If you like coffee. Don't touch it if you don't. Of the five here that tried it, I appear to like it the least, so you may like it more... but to me, it's like fake, starbucks watered-down cold coffee. Not great."
"Recommend especially for the java lover. Thanks to Khiasmus for the bottle."
"Had to try it, though, since I'm a sucker for the style."
"I am a big fan of Meantime- their IPA is one of my regulars when I can get it. And this is an interesting side note, glad I tried it. Try it again? Maybe. Not sure."
"This has quite a light body to it, with just a touch of fullness as it rests on the palate. The beer starts out dry and roasty, but quickly picks up a soft sweetness that really helps with the overall perceived balance. The beer finishes with a chalk-like cocoa powder note, some roast-derived bitterness and a touch of burnt acidity. There was a solid amount of coffee used in this brew, I wonder how much, if any, dark malts were used in this brew, because I could totally see this as getting all of its dark color and character from coffee. I suppose though that the chocolate aromatics and flavor are probably derived from roasted malt. Quite a tasty brew, and with the caffeine punch, it is a good way to start off an evening of drinking."
"I had this one in a small bottle. I poured it in a snifter. The color was dark brown, with nice reddish hues when put in the light. The nose was all about the name: coffee. Ground coffee beans. True to its name. On the palate, same flavors of coffee throughout the whole drinking experience, backed by a nice bitterness in the finish. The body was low in carbonation. Nicely done!"
"The carbonation is pretty strong with lots of small, almost sharp bubbles."
"Meantime Coffee really smells like coffee with some sweet aromas in the background. The bottle looks like a mini champagne. The beer is black like a murky Guiness and doesn't pour with much foam. Luckily, it doesn't taste as much coffee as the smell leads you to expect although it creeps up on your palate in the aftertaste. Reading about this beer you may think it's a broiler freak but it is actually an excellent brew."
