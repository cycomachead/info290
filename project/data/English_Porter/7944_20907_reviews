"Overall-  Nothing special about this beer. I probably even overrated it a bit. Won’t try it again on purpose."
"Pretty accurate title for this beer (I kid, I kid).  Seriously though, had a rather strange taste to it and it was not a smooth ride going down."
""
"Pours a dark brown and lets a little light through along the edges. Head is fizzy and leaves quickly, leaving decent lacing. Aroma is very light but malty. Taste is really light, really too light to be called a porter IMO. Flavors are there, just subdued and slightly watery. Mouthfeel is decent but does not have that thickness and mouth coat of a porter."

"It is just lacking to me"
"The name is funny but it is a great tasting porter. Slight hop taste flavor but most of the flavor is of dark roasted barley. Very nice beer"
""
""
"T - Lighter than expected.  Somewhat watery roasted malts.  Mostly chocolate and coffee; bread."
"All in all, a very decent porter. Exactly what I was expecting, no more, no less."

"o: A mild tasting porter, easy drinking, certainly much better than one might imagine Santa's Butt.  3.5"
"Serving type: bottle."
"Overall just an average, water porter.  More of a holiday gimmick than a high quality beer."

"Overall it's an interesting choice, but not particularly outstanding."

"Overall, this is decent stuff. It's not really exciting, but there's a little interest there, and it's structured in very much the way it should be. In the end, there's a little class hiding behind the gimmicky label, at least."
""
"overall: I recall this beer catching flak for its name and label; Santa's nothing if not humorous, so the State needs to take some soma and drink this; juvenile packaging aside, the beer is a medium-strength winter warmer that has me in a giving mood long after the holiday season..."
""

""

"Overall - One of, if not the most disappointing porters I've ever had. I've had BMC Light products with more flavor. I bought this at a severe discount, and I still feel like I got ripped off."
""
""
""
"O: Fairly sweet porter, thin and leave me wanting more. Sickly sweet feeling but not a bad beer."
""
"o - a solid porter but not one i would seek out yearly."

"O - I bought this beer to drink for Christmas, Thankfully I wasn't aging or waiting to drink this beer. it was a impulse buy and it will probably sells more because of its name. The beer is decent, not terrible. I wouldn't seek it out again, but I'd drink it if it was around. Cheers!"
"Drinks thin and flat and is really unappealling in every catagory."

"The good news is that the flavor emphasizes the malts and grains, but, on the whole, everything is way too subdued weak. Great name but a near sub-par beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"D - Not bad, it is a bit on the sweet side, but not unpleasant. Nothing complex, but enjoyable enough."
"Overall: the lightness makes this one very drinkable. Its jwhat you expect for the style. Good name though, I guess."
"Smells and tastes of fresh baking chocolate with some lighter soft fruitiness from yeast and a light mineral chalkiness that accentuates a sort of raisin tone combined with a subtle tangy sour accent that brings to mind ""ye olde"" definition of the English Porter genre. Too bad the roasted character is somewhat lackluster and muddy, and the hopping content is murky and indistinguishable. In the end, this is merely a slightly better than average beer with funny label art."
"O: This beer is easy to drink and has some interesting flavors but seems like it could use some bitterness and more carbonation."
""
"Review from 1/2010 notes. Poured into a Caracole small snifter. Pours a dark red brown, thin tan head and little lacing. Aroma of faint dark malt and dark fruit. Taste follows with light malt and dark fruits. A modest dark ale, light body, mild corn aftertaste. These Ridgeway beers have a nice presentation and generally taste good, but have really muted and bland flavor levels."

"O: Not the rich, wintery treat I was hoping for, but still pretty good. This 6% ABV English porter has enough character to keep your palate interested and searching, though the malt base at times seemed pedestrian. A slightly richer flavor would improve upon an already decent porter."
""
""
""
""
""

"Just not enough here to hold my interest."
"The over drinkability for me is low. Not really my kind of beer."
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is almost jet black, with chestnut brown highlights around the edges, and only the slimmest ring of bubbling around the edge of the glass. Aromas are mild, with a solid coffee tone throughout. Some lighter malt and hops scents come off on the nose, also. Flavors are dry and crisp, which is a great representation of the style. Good blending of dry roasted coffee and mild chocolate malts, with a smooth character and light, smooth body. The aftertaste is rich and slightly roasted, with a dry feel to it. Slow, dry finish, leaving a good linger of flavors behind. Good brew."
"O: Overall, I quite enjoyed this beer; it seems underrated. I received it for Christmas in a mysterious beer of the month box that a stranger signed me up for. I look forward to drinking the rest of these beers and would recommend it others."
"I think I'm being generous with this rating but since there's worse out there average is appropriate. It's marketing and naming are far better than the beer but you didn't waste your money. Kissing your sister!"
""
""
"O- Easily drinkable and sure not at all an unpleasant drink. Quite warming, expecially given it's ABV. Uninteresting"
"The taste is better, with bitter cocoa and roasted notes. It finishes a bit more thinly than I'd like, but this beer still provides a pleasant experience."

"Drinkability: Meh. That is about it."
"I was at the Kendall Pub in Yorkville, IL and they had plenty of Ridgeway Brewing bottles for sample. I tried the Santa's Butt Porter. The beer poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle with a deep amber color that you can still see through. There was a small slightly off-white head. Smell is of peat, roast and malt. Taste is mild, with roast and peat tones. The mouthfeel is actually light in body with decent carbonation. Overall this is a fairly decent beer."
""
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown color with some light brown hues. Very little head. Minimal lacing. Aroma is of earth, booze, caramel, malts, and toffee. Taste is rather light. Toffee, caramel, earth and malts. Thin mouthfeel and somewhat watery. Not much else going on. Malt near the end. This beer doesn't pack much flavor. Overall, nothing special and not worth having next Xmas."
""
"O: I like this a fair bit as a nut brown ale. It is too thin and lacks roastiness for a porter, though. If it didn't say ""porter"" on the label, it wouldn't have occurred to me that this was anything but a darkly colored brown ale."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Not one of the more exciting Porters out there, not by any stretch of the imagination. But it is enjoyable as a nice, everyday beer. Making it out to be a Winter Porter doesn't help its cause."
"Sampled on December 3, 2011. The pour is dark chestnut-amber with no head but good clarity. Lots of sweet roasted malts in the aroma along with sugar and a nip of laid back hops. The bodu is in the medium range and also rather smooth and creamy.It definitely espouses a pleasant bitter flavor but it really reminds me of most sweet British ESB's which always seem to have this soft water characteristic and lots of approachable flavor."
""
""
""
""
"There's a very tart aftertaste. Just not a good porter nor a good winter offering. It's not bad, it's just...meh."
""
""
"Drinkability I felt was good. Light flavors, good on style and no signs of ABV"
"Overall I am very excited about this beer and this brewery in general. I tend to grade under the average, but for the three christmas ales I've had from RB I have ranked them a bit higher than others... Slainte"
"Overall this beer lacked the character of a good porter which places it in my average column. The best part of the beer was the name and label."
"O - Disappointing porter but not too bad. Overall I would not recommend it. No complexity at all."
"Finish is watery and extremely short. Not one to try and would never recommend."
"A slightly below average porter that goes down easy but doesn't really leave you craving another."
"One finger head of light brown foam, with good clinging lace. Color is a 35 on the SRM beer color chart. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, toffee, caramel, currant, and roasted malt. Flavors are chocolate, dark roasted coffee, toffee, caramel, and malt. Thick creamy body in my mouth with good carbonation. Too heavy for drinking more that a couple at a sitting, but would be good with cheese and cake."
"D - I don't think I would trade a Sam Smith' s Taddy Porter or a Fuller's Porter for this one."
"Notes: Not terrible, but it lacks depth and roundness. It's just too sweet and estery. Not enough roasted malts, and not quite enough hop bitterness to balance it out. There are a great many beers I would prefer over this one."
"Not waht i was expecting, no real coffee roastiness and overall, pretty meh."
"From winter brew tasting notes (2010): Pours clear dark brown with almost no head. This beer smells of sugar, molasses and, oddly enough, a light lager, maybe Natty light. The flavor in this beer is definitely lacking a little bit, especially for a winter porter. The nose is slightly bitter, but it has an ambiguously sweet aftertaste."
"D: Flavorful, smooth and rich. Not as much character as I hoped for."
"""No."""
"Snifter pour and I am met with a dark brown ale and burgandy highlights when brought up to the light. The aroma consists of some light malts and fruit (orange, plum). The taste is somewhat spicy with a dose of toffee and slight caramel. There is a bite at the end on the swallow and long slightly bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel was a little too thin for my liking. It comes in at 6% though it's drinkable, I was hoping for something of a coffee-like nature and I got nothing."
"Again, this seems more like a brown ale along the lines of a Newcastle but with a better body and a bit better taste. Definitely on the lighter end of the porter scale."
"Bottle at the December Santa Cruz tasting. Pours a clear chestnut color with some tan foam. Aroma is brown malts with a touch of smoke. A bit of caramel and roast in the flavor, plus milk chocolate and a bit of sourness. Medium bodied, very English, pretty generic."
"With the moderate alcohol levels and unobtrusive taste and smell, you could easy drink this all night long. It goes down easy with no offensive qualities."
"The is actually quite drinkable to me. I do not think there is one strength but perhaps reasonable presentations of each part that suits my palate."
"Verdict: An enjoyable one timer for me, but there are so many christmas seasonal beers out there, this one didn't have quite the kick and flavor diversity I was looking for. Good for some, worth a shot for most. I'm torn on whether I'd get it again. B- (3.3)"
"Pours a dark brown with an off white head that fades quickly. The smell seems like a porter and a nut brown mixed, some sweet earthy notes, malty undertones. The taste starts sweet and malty with the sweetness ringing out till the aftertaste that has a hint of alcohol with a very subtle roasted malt finish. The mouthfeel is light, almost medium, but still leaves something to be desired. Not super smooth, but still an easy drinker. A good amount of flavor, and enjoyable, a nice winter warmer."
"Nice. I'd drink Santa's Butt again."
"Flavors were pedestrian; some coffee, some cocoa. For an EP I expected some bite, hops..something. Then again, the category on here could be wrong. Either way, it's average. Which makes it easy to drink."
"D - A classic English porter. Very drinkable. Flavors are delicious but restrained. Could easily enjoy several of these in a sitting. As a bonus, both the nose and the taste open up into additional fruit-based flavors as it warms in the glass. Most American porters are really junior stouts. This beer does a great job of showing off what it means to be a true porter."
"D: This is a solid English porter all-around."
"Bottle procured in the middle of bumfu&k no where Maryland...An ugly water pour, light brown with a little carbonation, doesn't look great...The aroma is light stale coffee, alcohol and a little hops...The taste is horrendous, can barely drink half a glass of this. Stale coffee, not roasty at all, lots of alcohol."
"D- i guess i coulda summed it up in the last paragraph BUTT... ""good beer"" drinkers that expect something from a porter and have a benchmark for a style and/or something they wish to receive: this will not do it for ya. experimenters and people that are trying to drink something different around the holidays or whenever: give it a shot, you might like it. BMC fans who got this in their stocking: go for it. but me, i say although it tastes fresh and all which definitely earns some points, in the time of year when i jones for dark hearty brews, i'm disappointed in this one. put me on the naughty list bitch i don't care. after all that rambling i will conclude this yuletide tale by saying that i could drink at max 47 of these."
"High drinkability for me, as this went down easy and had enough flavor complexities to enjoy on its own or as a session beer. A strong recommendation for any porter fan or any fan of rich roasted malt flavor in a beer."
"Very very dark mahagonay reddish brown color. No head, very tiny ring around edge of glass. Very chocolatey malty aroma. Roasty start, dark fruit and chocolate finish. Roasted aftertaste. Medium Body, semi-thin on the tongue. Carbonation seems on the high side adding to the thinness. Not super complex but a good basic. Quite nice, doesn't sit super heavy."
"Actually a bit too sweet and little bitter for me."
"Dr. Very easy."
"D - Aside from the thin taste, this isnt a bad porter. Having said that I would not wait all year just to have this as a holiday beer."
"The beer overall is too bad well put together porter with good flavors."
"Good beer! Great name and I had to admit that influenced the purchase. I probably won't buy it again because of the expense, but it is a solid porter. It's rich and warms the tongue as it layers with flavors of chocolate malts. It does have a smooth hop balance, and is a high quality porter. Fairly drinkable, but not a beer I'm going to seek out."
"D: A good drinker."
"Had this on tap at the Other Side in Boston, enjoyed it a lot but did not take notes, and was psyched to see it for sale a few weeks later a block away at Bauer Wine and Spirits on Newbury. Funny label and story on it. Was a bit disappointed though. Pours thin, dark brown to black and opaque in the middle, looks like coca-cola on the sides. Minimal head which dissipated immediately. Smell is very faint -- ? fruity, root beer. Taste is pretty good, hints of smokiness, coffee, tobacco and cherries. Feel is thin as predicted by the pour, very thin for a porter. Minimal carbonation. Pretty easy drinking, perhaps too easy for a winter porter. Would get it on tap if I saw it again, but not in the bottle."
"Poured from a brown 16.9 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a small head. Smell is of malts, some notes of chocolate. Taste is mild, some malts and chocolate, finishing slightly bitter. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has average drinkability. Overall this is a fairly decent beer."
"Drinkability: Very easy drinkability, a nice beer for the holiday season, enjoyable."
"D- It's a really good beer but may start to weigh you down after a couple"
"D Just fine for the style and for the beer itself. Again here, not inspirational in terms of drinkability. 3.0"
"D: Despite the mediocre reviews before this one, I find this beer to be quite nice. A solid example of the style."
"Pours dark brown with a very small head. The aroma is very, very faint with some malty sweetness. The flavor is just simply not very good. I get a strong medicinal flavor and no real roasted malts or anything else you would expect in a porter. Not sure if something is amiss in this beer or if it is just not very good, but I barely finished a 4 oz sample. Low to medium carbonation and medium body."
"Good, solid, drinkable porter."
"A nice easy drinking holiday ale that is full of flavor and relatively low in alcohol for a holiday beer. nice clear cola brown with tan head a lace. A sweet toffee and malt aroma. Taste is sweet and malty. A bit of molasses. A yeasty fruitiness and mild finish. Some toasted dark bread lingers. A light warming from the invisible alcohol. A little light on feel but a nice light carbonation. You can enjoy several of these in a sitting, quite pleasant on a cold evening. Warming and restorative with a quenching quality."
"Mouthfeel was zippy carbonation with a smooth finish."
"This felt like a high carbonation beer, light and watery on tongue with a slight non pine bitterness at the finish. Good but I was expecting more than just a simple porter more spices that would convied Santa and Christmas."
"D: smooth and drinkable, just not my favorite, but could drink a few."
"d: ok actually; a little one note and very sweet; but still drinkable; it does not taste at all like an english porter but still is pretty drinkable"
"Drinkability- A little light for me, not a bad beer but way too light"
"This drinks like a Scottish Ale...and a pretty good one at that! So, in that case this is very drinkable. Comparing this to an English Porter is not fair..."
"Medium body, off-dry finish. It was drinkable, but went down fairly carelessly - no voices inside the beer calling out to me. The memory of its taste fades quickly."
"overall, well, i look forward to trying some other new winter brews!"
"D: decent enough, but not very complex."
"Another very drinkable holiday brew by ridgeway."
"D - Moderate drinkability. Carbonation gets to me as I drink it, both in an unpleasant mouthfeel and filling my stomach. ABV is a bit potent."
"Appears a pitch black tone at first with ruby highlights when held toward the light. Aroma is upfront with dark fruits and roasted malts a bit of chocolate coffee and mild cherry nice. Flavor has dark roasted malt flavor blended with a bit of Christmas spunk including dark fruits and other variables into the mix. Mouthfeel is medium bodied solid medium bodied even carbonation. Drinkability is solid all around solid drinking Christmas ale I look forward to more of."
"singular, a bit smoky for my taste and not enough alcohol for the winter warmer style."
"Curious to try a ""fresh"" one of these to see the difference. Held up pretty good to age and can only guess what a good one tastes like."
"drinkability: wouldnt recommend this one. its too over carbonated and syrupy. no distinct or unique flavors and overall just pretty light."
"Highly recommended if you can spot one!"
"A dark coffee mahogany color with a whispy dirty tan head and a modest lace. The aroma is a mild coffee chocolate malt. The taste is a bit sour coffee bean and vanilla. Medium body that is fairly drinkable for the style. There is the prefunctory touch of charcoal, smooth and agreeable for a winter brew."
"Feel and Drinkability: As aforementioned this one feels a bit watery on the palate, thin, like butter scraped over too much bread. Flavor in the mouth is fleeting, but the aftertaste and roasty flavor hangs around for a bit. I'd like if this were a bit heavier, if it had some more body and weight in the mouth. Carbonation is right for this style. This one is easy to drink, I can see myself buying this again, however, this isn't a porter I'd turn to when I want something really good. Its a nice beer but not something I'd seek out. Pretty much average, I've had many that are better and I've also had worse."
"D- I would have another if offered, though not sure if I'd buy it."
"Conclusion: Not a bad stout, but the label's the coolest thing about this beer...in the end, it's not bad, but it's definitely not worth the $5 dollars a bottle."
"Nice drinkable ale and better than I expected from my experience with ""Lump Of Coal."" Good beer go buy some."
"D: Was decently enjoyable to drink, but it lacked the complexity and depth of flavor that I expect from winter brews. The flavor was also a bit weak. I paired the latter half with food and its weakness really came out then. I won't turn down another, but I won't pay for one either."
"I poured from a 16 ounce bottle into a standard pint glass. It pours a deep dark brown with a moderate white head. There are ruby highlights when held up to the sun. The aroma was roasted malt, not very strong. The flavor was slightly bitter and had hints of coffee. The sweeter notes win out. The body was a bit light and the carbonation was average. A beer that can be easily quaffed."
"Drinkability: Just wasn't impressed with this. Smelled better than it tasted. Won't be buying ever again."
"D: Unimpressed with the overall package, the abv is reasonable for warmer-style porter"
"The appearance is very dark, with a slight mahogany hue when put to the light. Initial there is a nice creamy head which dissipates almost immediately. I would describe the aroma as musty, almost like a wet sock (not that I smell a lot of wet socks, but if I had to imagine what they smell like this would be it). I did like upfront toasted malt flavor. There is not much in the way of a hop presence but then again this is a porter. Overall, this is an average beer with a somewhat disagreeable aroma."
"This poured a nearly opaque dark mahogany with some tan head. It smelled like subdued coffee beans and barley malt with a bit of dark chocolate and oak. It tasted like watered-down coffee and earthy barley malt with prominent copper hops. It was thin with moderate carbonation, and had a very metallic bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a decent porter, very British and metallic. It tasted good but not great, and had a decent body. It was easy to drink, but was generally not exciting."
"Not bad, but from a Christmas beer you can expect some more characterization."
"A decent one in the Ridgeway line."
"Body is too thin for the depth of color."
"Nothing special here. Pours a medium brown with a weak head. The nose has roasty malts and a touch of cocao. The taste is equally unimpressive. Not bad, just a bit light for the style. Light body has decent carbonation. Good brew to wash down some fish and chips, but thats about it."
"taste is a little creamy, milk chocolate, coffee, and some malt, ends with just a touch of bitterness."
"Quite easy to drink. I just wish there was a stronger flavor."
"Not bad, but, I'm not running out to buy a fridge full."
"D-A fine brew. Enjoyable more for the novelty of the beer's name than for the quality of the beer. However, still a decent brew."
"M = Medium bodied, quite good mouthcoating, pleasant amount of carbonation which teases the mouth without overpowering it."
"I bought this beer on a whim, the unusual name must have caught my attention. The beer pours deep dark chestnut brown color with a wispy head that quickly disappeared. Fairly light in the aroma with caramel malt and some dark sweet malt lurking in the background. Fairly light on the palate for the style. The flavor is sweet malt with some coffee notes shining through. Finishes about as uneventful as it begins. This beer lacks the complexity and depth that I prefer is a winter warmer."
"I poured this funny labeled big beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The color of the beer was black and it had a ice head at first. It was not long though that the head dissapeared to nothingness. The lacing eas fair though. The smell was of caramell and it was a pretty good beer. I will buy again."
"D: Overall a light-moderate drinking English porter, with a nice coffee display when drank at the proper temperature."
"500 ml bottle from the Bayou. Pours a pure black color with a medium white head. Rich roasted aromas, some chocolates and light caramel in the nose also. The taste is very nice, very quaffable, smooth and full flavors of roasted malts, caramel, light and sweet fruits and chocolates. Very enjoyable."
"D-Not bad, but a bit lackluster I'd think of this more as a fall beer than a winter seasonal. Not going to run out to buy another anytime this season."
"It doesn't taste like Kris Kringle's ass to be sure, but this isn't a knockout porter by any means. Not bad, but Taddy Porter, it ain't."
"Drinkability: Probably one of the better porters I've tried, very quaffable, easy to drink at only 6.00 ABV, this is a Porter you can enjoy around the holidays, good beer to look forward to around the holidays, not something I would buy on the regular but defintley a porter you can enjoy on a cold winter night."
"Overall this wasn't a bad beer, there are just better examples. I really enjoy the English Porters but this just doesn't compare to stuff like Tadcaster, Fullers, and Meantime."
"Subdued aroma primarily semi-sweet malts with some bitterness. Dark amber pour solid tan head and minimal lacing. Medium to light on the palate for a porter but there is a richness in the finish that helps smooth this one out a bit. Light toasty flavor with some roasted malts complimented by some molasses and brown sugar flavors. A touch of coffee. Reminds me of a couple English Strong Ales I've recently had."
"The drinkability is so so not really worth it unless you are hard up for a new review. MK"
"A mild beer with no off flavors. Drinkable, but not outstanding."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little off-white creamy head, some nice sticky lacing follows. The nose is big on malts, lots of toffee/caramel. The tasty is slightly sweet, malty, toffee/caramel. Medium body. Drinkable, not a bad brew, but would most likely not seek again."
"For starters, I'm gonna review this beer as a dark ale, rather than a porter. It lacks a lot of ""porter qualities"". This beer poured a dark burgundy color. Once again, it would be a nice looking dark ale. It had a nice dark chocolate smell, with a touch of bread. It definitely lacked the porter smokiness in taste. It really has a dark chocolate taste, with some raisin bread qualities. The aftertaste is where you really taste the alcohol. At 6.0 abv, the alcohol taste should be nonexistent. This beer was very watery for a porter. I would drink this again, but at $6 a bottle, there are better options."
"The taste is much worse: almost nothing but prunes and alcohol, with faint hints of red wine and chocolate. The body isn't too thin but it is not complex at all and is really very bland for a porter, tasting pretty much just of alcohol-soaked prunes. It is far too bland and alcoholic. However, it is drinkable and some enjoyable feel and warmth."
"Pours a cola color brown with a big fizzy head that fades quickly. Little carbonation if any at all. Smell is lightly of chocolate and cocoa. A pinch of caramel. Mild hop bitterness. Taste certainly carries on with similar flavors but an English hop bitterness gets to me. It's kind of chalky and dry. There is a sweetness to the beer but it's hard to enjoy with the bitter flavor that lingers. Some nice chocolate, caramel, and even light hints of oat but overshadowed. Mouthfeel is a bit watery and thin without much body. Low on carbonation and overall substance. It's a struggle to finish this bottle. Not one I'll be coming back to, sorry to say."
"Solid all-around porter with a taste of molasses and a touch-up of dark cocoa. It's worth a look if you're into porters, though at its $4.99 pricetag I can't see myself putting that money down again on this with so many better beers out there."
"Not outstanding, but fairly good."
"I've Had this beer for a few months. I finally decided to give it a whirl. What a joke! No Lacing on head. Looked thin and watery. Smelled a tad sweet and chocolately but very diluted. Tasted like water. Was flat. Maybe a bad batch? The finish? There wasn't one. Easily the worst porter I've ever had. What a waste of money because I love porters."
"D: A nice porter beer, but nothing really special about it to make me buy it for $4.99, try it if you can find it on the cheap after the Christmas season like I did."
"D - This was an okay porter. Nothing from Ridgeway has really blown me away."
"Drinkability> so-so. And that says alot about the taste. If the mouthfeel matched the taste and smell, I could drink this everyday and maybe MAYBE even say it is my favorite porter, alas mouthfeel is very important."
"Finish is somewhat short."
"Dark brown with mahogany highlights. One inch creamy tan foam that dissipates fast. Aroma is light and taste is thin. Has kind of a bitter cola flavor. Mouthfeel is thin. Overall this is not terrible by any means but I have had many better beers than this and I wont be drinking this again despite the cool name."
"Overall, it's okay but it isn't anything impressive and I wouldn't buy it again."
"An easy drinking light porter, not bad."
"Drinks easy, just not very interesting, more malt please"
"Pours a one finger off-white head that fades to a thin layer leaving a good lace. Brown/mahogany color. Medium carbonation and medium bodied. Roasted malt and coffee nose. Flavor has moderate sweetness, biscuity. Slight bitter aftertaste. $5.20 for a 500ml bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, MA."
"Drinkability: Wouldn't buy this one again. Not my style."
"Drinkability: Very little taste. Watery and thin. Much too sweet. I thought this one had some potential, but it seems like just another gimmick."
"Presentation: Packaged in a sixteen-ounce brown glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Another Christmas beer, but one due to labeling rather than typical Christmas spicing. The label is the best thing about this lackluster porter. The beer pours thin and light brown, but ends up moderately dark with a white head that leaves some lacing. Chocolate and coffee on the nose, however both smell watered down or somewhat diminished. The flavor is weak - some milk chocolate and roasted coffee flavor, but there is very little in the way of dominant flavor. Mouthfeel is thin and unremarkable. A disappointing beer at best - I would not drink this again unless it was on draught. Not recommended."
"I have been saving this beer for Christmas Eve. Pours a dark brown with red highlights, kind of the color of Coca-Cola. A small white head faded quickly. The smell is very sweet malt. The taste is also very sweet with a bit of hop bitterness in the back. The aftertaste is a light, bitter coffee. Mouthfeel is medium this with some almost-fizzy carbonation. A decent novelty beer for the season, but nothing outstanding."
"Chocolate and mustiness enter the palate first, followed by a bittersweet nutty flavor, and English hops. Slight metallic taste is left on the tongue. It doesn't deviate too far from your typical English porter, but that's not always a bad thing. Mouthfeel is a bit too thin for my liking. Novel name and an interesting conversation piece, but a bit pricey ($5.25) for what amounts to a standard Brit porter. Worth a shot though, after all, 'tis the season..."
"Overall, this is an innocent beer that doesn't do anything wrong. No flaws but nothing unusual either."
"Not an overwhelming brew, but fun!"
"Nice novelty beer around Christmas, but not a great beer. Should be way down on the list of Porters to try."
"This porter or so called holiday porter is dissapointing. It pours real thin with a head too white. The nose is almost non existent. The taste has that classic ridgeway dirty tank flavor. some hints of malt and coffee, but far too thin to be a porter much less a holiday porter. The mouthfeel is not creamy in the last, it has a lager feel. Some people like these beers alot and if its your thing im sorry, but i just cant get into them. The bottles are cool, but i just cant see myself buying any of these beers again except maybe the insanely bad elf."
"Cheers"
"The label and name alone make this beer worth trying. This dark brown brew has a fizzy off-white head that eventually disappears. Some light chocolate and smoked wood in the smell. Taste is a bit thin for a porter but solid with some burnt coffee notes and chocolate malts, not all that thick or full bodied though. Sweet with a little bitterness at the end. Very drinkable and not heavy enough that you can't have another. Worth a try."
"Pours a deep amber/ black color with a tan head, In the aroma, a sweet malt, small cocoa and caramel notes. In the taste, a roasty malt and a nice sweetness. A small bitterness and light malt in the mouthfeel and a malty, small cocoa presence in the aftertaste. A very nice English porter, small bite and a nice malt, nice cocoa presence as well."
"Drinkability: It's been cold here in Lincoln, with about 5 inches of snow on the ground (for December that's a good amount), so I was kinda in the Christmas mood when I bought this yesterday ($4.99 at The Still). An ok beer, I may buy one more for Christmas, if there are any left."
"I picked up this brew on a whim, mainly due to the name and the label. On popping the cap I enjoyed a nice sweet smell that you get with a porter. I poured it into a frosted beer stein and got a dark brown pour with a light brown one finger head. The taste and mouth feel were average for a porter. Not great, but not bad."
"Poured a dark brown with no foam or lace. The smell of roasted malts and just a hint of caramel was the aroma that I picked up upon first sniff. The flavor was of weak roasted malts and weak whatever this porter was made up as. Not a lot of flavor, just drinking flavored malty water. This was a great name for this ale, ""Santa's Butt", what a perfect name for this porter!"
"This is a simple beer to drink. Good for 40 degree weather. If It gets below 10, I'm going for something stronger."
"D - Slightly above average. It has a good finish that was unexpected."
"I'm not a fan of English beers, prefering the local micros this side of the pond, but this is worth trying. I recommend giving it a whirl."
"Color is a dark red or brownish red. Aroma is delightful - it seems as if each sniff yielded a different hint or tone. I got the burnt-coffee smell that I associate with good porters and stouts, as well as hints of spice and an undertone of molasses. Flavor is not strong but pleasant, smoky, sweet overtones and hints of coffee. Finish is smooth, leaves a bit of sweet on the lips and just a whisper of hop bitterness. Not superb, but definitely worth hunting."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability- Smooth and easy to drink a little watery."
"Not a bad porter. Nice and smooth, without much hoppiness, which is normal for an English Stout. Recommended."
"Pours a dark brown,with ruby highlights. Thin looking,with a one finger tan head. Not much retention,or lacing. Aroma, is toasty,with hints of carmel,and spice. Body is thin,and lightly carbonated. Taste is of toasted malts,with almost a cola flavor at points. Not bad."
"Upon the pour the beer presents a deep brown with considerable ruby highlights, head is average in size, about two fingers, light tan in color and frothy in texture as it fades quickly, the lace make a very thin sheet. Nose has a nice toasty malt sweetness, hints of caramel, and light butterscotch tones also present, a pleasant sniff. Start has a nice toasted grain presence, hints of burnt toast bitterness, top is light to almost medium in feel. Finish is lightly acidic, hops and toasted malt bite adds a pleasing end to the sampling, dry and a nice drinking beer, not over powering, just a good English Porter."
"I've read about their blight in recent years and I thought I'd help support the cause. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very dark, dark brown color - pretty much black, not much in the way of head. The smell is slightly chocolaty, sweet like raisins and prunes. The taste is very much the same, with the alcohol coming out only slightly. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with little carbonation. Very drinkable, not too heavy and is pretty enjoyable. Overall, this is an excellent winter porter ."
" D- Very drinkable, nice on a cold winter night or an early spring with a slight breeze would get it again if I could find it locally."
"Pours black with a frothy, large-bubbly (adjective trademark pending), thin tan head. The smell is sweet chocolate and malt. The taste is surprisingly subdued. Doesn't really have the character I'd expect from a porter. Hard to describe, it's so subdued. Malt, a hint of anise. Hints of stuff my brain is trying to invent to fill the void. Odd. Odd, odd odd. Mouthfeel is thin, but with a silkiness that's not unpleasant. Drinkability? Sure, you could drink more but I'm not sure why. Nothing bad about this, just nothing good."
"Mouthfeel is rather light with fast moving carbonation. Goes down easy but doesn't really satisfy me like a normal porter would. Almost seems a bit watery. Overall, I personally found this to be a pretty forgettable brew and I don't see myself going back to it again. Maybe I'll have to try some of the other Ridgeway offerings."
"Opaque and carbonated dark brown with an initial rising foamy head; settles into a bubbly carbonated ring that grasps tenderly. The nose is relatively clean and unobtrusive--light malt roastiness, day old coffee grounds and traces of english hops. The body is slightly carbonated and rich; a swirling mix of toffee malts and roasted malts. Bitterness is introduced coupled with some lingering hops. Traces of dark fruits that slide across the palate, which is left roasty and clean. It is what it is--a novelty during the holidays, but it's still a decent porter."
"(11.2 oz / 330 ml bottle)"
"Got it from Mom for xmas as a novelty, but its been begging me to try it so here it goes. Poured a really dark black, which suprised me. No head at all, a nice lace was left, really carbonated, audible carbonation in ithe pour. Smell was very strong and robust, roasted coffee, chocolate, caramel, very sweet smelling I was actually really enjoying the aroma as it warmed. The feel was a bit thin and watery to me. Not as robust as the smell would have led me to believe. Their was a slight roasted caramel flavor to it, but it was rather uninspiring. A hoppy back came through towards the end, but barely. This came across as a really dark english brown to me as opposed to a porter. Overall I was not really blown away by it, though it could be sessionable I suppose. More of a novelty afterall."
"Very little lacing sitting above this the viscous appearing, dark brown colored brew. Nice aromas of dark fruits, toffee, molasses, coffee, and prunes. Thick chewy mouthfeel that is smooth and holds very little carbonation. Well balance of flavors with smoked malts, chocolate malt, tart old ale, toffee, buttery and just a hint of spice that is almost mint like. The finish is dry, earthy and the tart fruit, bready notes carry over at a mild level. Very tasty, highly recommended."
"D - I'd definitely drink this one again. Not sure how it qualifies as a holiday beer, but nevertheless, a solid example of style."
"Poured a dark chocolate brown with a tan head that was thinner than Id expected. Not much of an aroma ... just a bit of a wort-like sense. Kicks off with a bit of a roastiness, hint of ash on top. Flavors dont quite gel. Too thin for the style. Not worth the $5.99 I paid! (#2635, 1/6/2007)"
"I liked that a previous reviewer called this a ""run of the mill English porter."" I'd agree, however I must say that it is very drinkable and I wouldnt mind using it as a session beer. Has a bit more flavor than a lot of highly drinkable brews, yet it is very light and modest, making it enjoyable to pound a couple away. speaking of which, i may go do that now..."
"D: Maybe I got a bad one yet many of the reviews I have read do not hype this one up. Probably makes its most sales on the label. Anyone read the WSJ article on this one? One thought came to mind as I drank this: ""Make it a High Life."""
"Overall Impression: Easy drinking English ale. No real Christmas elements about it, but a fine way to celebrate the season."
"Poured from a bottle with the, recently, notorious label sporting Santa's...well, butt. Nice creamy, fluffy head sits over a dark porter with a few burgundy highlights. Average aroma with your standard chocolate malts and English hops. Nothing too pronounced here or in the, otherwise, run of the mill English porter taste. Not too exciting if you ask me."
"This beer pours a deep, dark brown, almost black color. Head development is thick and creamy, settling down to a nice surface covering. Everything about its appearance exemplifies the porter style. Smell is very aromatic with vanilla and a hint of bourbon. Sweet, malty overtones are present with very little hop character. Taste is sweet and malty with coffee notes. This beer exhibits a nice chocolate malt character and some bitterness at the back of the palate. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a little warming owed to the alcohol content. Overall, I was quite surprised at how good this beer turned out. My only disappointment is that I didn't have another bottle to try."
"This is a decent porter and exemplifies the style."
"The taste however is rather less interesting, not that it is bad, its just a little thin and doesnt quite live up to the scent. Nice round roasted character though with hints of chocolate, bread and hints of dark burnt fruit. Im not that familiar with the English style porter, but I enjoyed this, maybe even enough to buy again, but only time will tell. Worth a try, but Im sure there are far superior brews in the style to try."
"Pours a very dark brown chestnut color with a short tan head that quickly fades into a sticky lace. Nose is a bit subdued but there are notes of sweet malt and dark fruit (fig, plum, and a bit of raisin). Taste is caramel malt along with fainter notes of molasses and a roasted nuttiness. Certainly not unpleasant but uninteresting to point of being boring."
"Pours nicely into my imperial pint glass, filling it to the rim. Deep cherry color and settles into a light, creamy pond for a head. Really no discernable aroma...strange for a porter. Still, an inviting appearance. My first sip detected a hearty mouthfeel and yet mild, true-to-style flavor. Malty as it should be. Mild carbonation. Lace drapes the glass at the start but begins to fade with each sip. Hints of cherry in the finish. Biscuity to a degree. Hmm. Not a typical porter, not in a good way. This is a drinkable interpretation, but not overly inspired. I expect more than this, however, not an offensive effort."
"Drinkability: With all the fuss about this beer, it is truly disappointing"
"This porter poured a very dark, red-brown color with thin, tan foam that settled. The smell was malty with faint dried fruit and a very light sweetness. The taste was upfront dry caramel with some tangy maltiness and a bit of molasses. There was a very light hoppiness coming through the malt flavors. The mouthfeel was smooth with medium body and low (flat) carbonation. The finish was richly sweet. This was an OK porter, though a bit lacking. It did grow on me by the end of the glass."
"Santa's Butt pours an almost black color (with ruby at the edges) with a thin off white head from a brown 50 cl bottle. The aroma is dominated by sweet malts. The flavor is on the light side for the style, the roasted malt is very tame by porter standards. There is some roasted malt, but it's not as strong as I would expect. There are some chocolate notes and some mild fruity notes too. Just kind of an average beer."
"Nothing particularly interesting about this beer. Does Ridgeway make anything complex or unique?"
"A nice full, solid mouthfeel, easy down the throat. Good stuff, although I've recently had some other English Porters I prefer."
"Poured into a pint glass. Had very little head that disappeared in a blink of an eye. The aroma was malty with a little caramel in it. The mouthfeel was thin and watery even for a porter. The taste was pretty bland and won't have me looking for more. Overall just an OK beer that I won't be trying again unless only macros around. (2.5, NA, Tie, N)"
"D: Perfect for a cold night with plenty of chocolate covered raisins or pretzels."
"The uninitiated around the maundythirsty home give it good reviews. I'll chalk that up to Christmas cheer spill-over. A middling porter."
"This is a highly sessionable beer. With the flavor and mouthfeel lacking, it's begging to be drank fast and furious."
"Nice winter brew, not phenomenal, but very enjoyable. A bit better than your average porter, with a nice warming quality."
"Medium body, low carbonation. Balance is pretty good. More of a nut brown to my taste buds than a porter. Doesn't have any noticeable warming affect as the label would lead you to believe, so not sure I would term this a winter beer either. Wouldn't turn another one down, but also wouldn't put it at the top of my list."
"50 cl bottle."
"Not a bad drink - Hovers around an average English porter. Nothing much wintry about it. Funny label and name. Worth having only to have. Inoffensive, but rather dull."
"A pleasant, well-balanced porter. I'd buy it again!"
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with some reddish tints to it. Head retention isn't good, but the lacing is decent. There's about an inch or so tan head. It smells like roasted malt, chocolate, and raisins, but the aroma is a bit weak. It tastes like roasted malt, coffee, and bitter chocolate. There's only a slight bitter aftertaste with this beer. The body is light/medium and a little bit slick. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. It's not close to being the best porter out there, but it's decent."
"Medium body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. A nice drinkable porter that I would be glad to share with friends on a cold winter's night."
"volume is a respectable 6%."
"Cheers!"
"A calming little porter that fits with the season. Not quite as big as this Santa would have liked to have stuffed in his palate stocking, but a good gift to get non-the-less."
"A light tasting porter with a nice air of drinkability. Not really a warmer as the bottle states, but a nice beer. Certainly sessionable. A light mouthfeel with a somewhat dry finish. I could see myself sittin on a barrel with a book in one hand and a mug of this tasty brew in the other. Worth a shot."
"I expected it to be a little more full-bodied than it was, the flavor left the tongue quickly. Pretty good, but obviously not perfect."
"i liked santas butt. i wish i had a whole butt of this to myself."
"D - Not the best porter in the world. My least favorite porters are those of the English style, but this is still not quite as good as it could be. I like the eggnogg flavors and the smokiness, but it needs to be thicker and more assertive."
"This one is definitely worth the try, though. It's a pretty good brew IMO."
"Overall a decent beer. I haven't really been impressed by Ridgeway's beer. They're good, but the labels are cooler than the beer itself."
"Notes: I gobbled this up without any troubles. Uneventful would be the best way I could sum up this review. Nothing off, disturbing, detracting or offensive in any way, just average at best."
"Agood drink, highly recommended."
"Drinkability: This is truly a fine beer and was a bit of a surprise. I must say that if you're expecting something ""wintery"" or ""christmasy"" as the name suggests, you might be disappointed. Flat-out, this is nothing but a porter. Plain, yet glorious in its understated beauty."
"Pours a dark black color with brownish/red hues around the edges when held up to a light with a thin light tan head. The aroma is dominated by a dark roasted maltiness with a touch of chocolate. The taste is rich and extremely balanced. There is a really nice roasted malt flavor like in the nose even if it is subdued. A little thin in the taste, but still very drinkable. Overall, this beer is definately a better than average porter but not worth the $5.45 I paid for the bottle."
"A must-purchase beer just because of the name. After the laughter (and the amusement of reading the lable), I can begin to evaluate the beer. There seems to be a mix of porter characteristics and Strong Ale characteristics even as eary as the nose. There is a big malty aroma showing sweetness, syrup, and chocolate; as well as strong fruity (cherry), booze, and caugh syrup strength. Flavors reinforce the nose with strong chocolates, cherries, berries, grapes, plumbs, spicy hops and a dominant alcohol sensation. The body is full and rich, thinned only by the alcohols and tart fruit flavors and mild astringencies. Finishes with a firm malt / fruit character, a fermentation twang, and alcoholic warmth. Interesting brew that offers more than just typical Porter expectations."
"A drinkable brew, and the ABV is completely hidden. A big difference from the robust porters that I have become accustomed to, which caught me off guard a bit. Once I worked my way into this one, I found that I quite enjoyed it. A nice change of pace from the bolder porter styles."
"This is different from any other Porter I've ever tasted, and a medium body at best with the alcohol being fairly undetectable. Worth a try for something way out of the ordinary...as the name implies!"
"overall: really suprised me, I was expecting a heavy dark beer, but this was part sour ale, part chocolate stout, part english ale. An interesting beer and enjoyable, but a little lacking in aroma. Changed my idea of what a porter can be."
"Faded black, watery appearance. Aroma?..searching..searching..I'm stumped, either I've entirely lost my sense of smell, or this beer has nothing that can be perceived..either result is not particularly good. The taste comes around alright, though. Roasty, slight butterscotch flavors with some woody notes & hops tagged onto it..not bad. Considering the pitiful mouthfeel, I'm surprised this one could carry the flavors as well as it did. English ales seem to have some kind of commitment to being watery, so the body was no real surprise here. Overall, I wouldn't be too upset if I found this in my stocking...frankly, I'd just be happy not to make the naughty list for the 24th straight year."
"Poured a black color with initial tannish head that quickly fell to a thick ring. Bubbles on the head were larger than I usually see on a beer. Smell is of roasted malt, some dark fruit(figs, prunes) and some chocolate-coffee notes. Taste delivers a pleasant sweet note and lots of fruitiness, similiar to a liquid fruitcake. The mouthfeel is extremely thin but still enjoyable.Very nice beer."
"Mouthfeel- Very smooth and yet a little oily at times. Mostly a creamy palate all over my tongue."
"On the sweet and light-bodied side, which by the end of the 500ml bottle, was thinning out a little too much. Still very smooth and drinkable, the 6% abv will not really slam you to the floor if one has a bottle or two. Ready for more."
"I'm not a fan. Too many odd flavors combining here. Doesn't exhibit enough vinous and roasted malt flavors to be an enjoyable porter. Plus, I can't get past the medicinal aroma and flavor."
"Drinkability: Dark beer lovers will appreciate. Not an everyday beer, but an interesting seasonal."
"The taste is lightly sweet, and actually a tad tart, almost like a plum. There is a light roast character that is a mix of coffee, and toasted malt notes. There is a definite fruitiness here as well, with the aforementioned plum as well as some notes of grapes and perhaps some notes of burnt raisins. I am not quite sure about this beer, is it off, if it is it is only lightly so. It could just be an idiosyncratic English yeast strain. The beer is a bit thinner than I would like, a bit more body would accentuate and balance the coffee and chocolate notes a bit better."
"Drinkability is well wouldn't buy again about on par with Rideways Stout. I would stick to their IPA's which if memory serves were pretty darn good."
"Drinkability: Oh yeah...watch out Santa. I'm not leaving this with my cookies!"
"This pours a dark brown with a smallish tan head.When I opened the bottle I got a good wiff of roasted malt,but as I poured the beer into a glass the smell has pretty much disappeared.The has a nice roasted flavor with small hints of both coffee and chocolate.The m/f is a little weak,light, and unbalanced.This is not a bad beer,and I would try it again,if I couldn't find some of my favorites of course."
"500ml is way too much of this gimmick beer. I dumped the last bit so I could move on to something better."
"Taste is much better, though still mild, with notes of malt, smoke, caramel & vanilla. Drinks smooth with medium effervescence. A decent beer but I expected a lot more."
"Deep mohagany color with a thinnish tan head. Aromas of chocolate and cinnamon dominate but there's also a sour lactic note in there along with a bit of saltyness. Taste is grainy and minerally in the body with ripe dark fruits and spices filling in. Some roasted flavors and hop spices towards the finish. This really is just a bit too weak in body and mouthfeel to really be anything much above average. Cool bottle design but decent beer at best."
"The mouthfeel is a bit thin and harsh from the acidity and carbonation. Also finishes quite dry with little to no bitter. Drinkability is good, but could be better."
"Lots of roasted coffee and bitter chocolate in the taste. Maybe a hint of almond nuttiness and a fleeting note of earthy hop bitterness. The chocolate syrup character is disconcerting here, and diminishes drinkability. A decent English porter, but I wouldn't care for another."
"I assumed from the label that this was a holiday ale, so I was prepared for more body and spice. BUTT it turned out to be a lightly spiced porter that I enjoyed. Overall decent brew, but there are many other porters Id search high & low for before this one."
"Very smooth, creamy, lightly carbonated, light/medium bodied, very easy to drink and a nice winter drink with just a bit of alcohol warmth."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: If youre a chocolate and licorice fan, youll like this one. Not a bad way to while away an evening. But not one Id be likely to seek out on a regular basis."
"Too bad it did taste like ass! Careful of what you name your beer."
"Clear dark mahogany tone. Thin brown head that sounds fizzy. Soon it's just a thin collar, which leaves sparse amounts of lace behind. Nice nose of toffee, chocolate, butter brickle, nuts and caramel. The mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated, so much so, this is teetering on becoming flat. But it's not quite there. The body is barely medium, if that. More like ""light-medium"" in viscosity. There's some nuttiness and buttery tones on the tongue. A little black malt bite. And some bittersweet chocoalate. All in all though, this is just there. It's there, but not making me take note of anything real redeeming."
"I like the aromas and flavors, but somehow the slick and oily prescence detracts from my enjoyment. I can't see drinking more than one these, and then only occassionally."
"Inky black with ruby highlights, and an oatmeal colored head that rises up quickly like soda carbonation, and falls quickly with the sounds of exploding bubbles, also like soda. Hardy aroma of clovey spices, some spruce, and a teeny bit of hops. Mouthfeel is thin and watery, a bit chalky. Flavor is not my idea of a porter. Not malty or biscuity, no hints of cocoa or coffee, molasses or fig. That's what it's not, but what is it? Clove and spice, soft ripe apple, some brown sugar, a little yeasty, and minimal hops riding beneath. A bit of a tannic puckery finish. I'm actually confused by this beer. But, again, cool label."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a dry finish. Nicely drinkable. Didn't put me in a christmas mood, but enjoyable."
"Santa's Butt. Hilarious. Pours a dark color with a small head that dies down quickly. There is a lot of chocolate in the aroma as well as a light bit of hops. The flavor has some of the chocolate character, but it also has something that I can't identify. Not sure what it is, but it's weird. Drinkability is good. Bit of diacetyl there as well."
"I've been waiting to have this one. Today seemed right. It pours a nice black color with a finger of head that falls to ring the beer. The nose is chocolatey, slightly creamy, maybe a touch of butteryness. The flavor is interesting...a little odd. Its almost a little spicey, slight anise, slight oxidation I think. I'm not really enjoying it all that much. The feel is a touch thin. Overall, this one is a bit of a let down for me."
"Useful for the punning name and amusing label, for sure, but it's yet another too-expensive English ale that can't hold a candle to porters brewed here in the U.S.A. Good enough beer, but $5 a bottle good? Afraid not."
"Santa's Butt is a better than decent, lighter-end-of-the-spectrum porter. It doesn't bowl me over with its magnificence, nor is it bursting with flavor, but it is a friendly, drinkable beer that I would consider buying again next holiday season if it wasn't for the $4.99 price tag."
"Flavor is chocolate and roasted malt just as the nose was with a bit of roasted malt lingering on my palate for the finish. Overall the flavor is mild and light. An enjoyable brew that goes down easy. I prefer some more umph though!"
"Almost opaque dark brown-black with a chocolate milk froth for a head. The suds thin in a minute or so. Laces sparsely but broadly. Interesting smell, some mocha intonations but strong hints of medium-grade pipe tobacco. Smooth mouthfeel, but the carbonation is too low, verges on flat. The taste showcases mainly malted milk, a lot of sweetness, minimum roastiness or hoppiness going on. There's a slight stale raisin off note going on, a funkiness that's almost mildewy. The flavor and mouthfeel didn't strike me on this one, it settles into almost tasteless on further sips, but the aroma was interesting and my favorite part of the beer."
"For lovers of English style ales, this one is not to be missed! It's brilliant in it's delivery of rich and satisfying character... meaning that unlike many American ales, it sweeps you off of your feet rather than clocking you in the back of the head! It's a delicate and supple beer in so many ways - and that's a huge part of its charm. Brilliant!"
"Next year they'll have to replace the Fat Santa with Billy Bob's Bad Santa, since his thinness would give more credit."
"Jet balck with an ok head that dissipates quickly. Smell is light. mainly malt, molasses, some smoke. Taste is mainly light sweetness with a hint of smoke. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a hint of carbonation on the finish. Very smooth, so drinkability is good. Not a classic but an ok brew."
"Pours a deep cola color with a soapy light tan head. I left this one in the fridge too long, so it's a little hard to discern much aroma. I'm picking up on a bit of star anise and some dark malted roastiness, the faintest smokiness and not much else. Light hopping to this porter. Rather roasty and chocolate malty, with a little amount of fruitiness coming through. Tinge o' chicory. Pretty nice porter, it certainly does fall into the realm of an English one (6% yet tastes thin). Lowly carbonated, but not off; other than the lackluster head. The aroma is the same cold as it is when it warms. Not bad, just too thin for my likings in a porter."
"This turned out to be not only a fun beer to share with my friends and family for the holidays, but a nice drinker!"
"This was an easy drinking beer, though. It went down easy. Wouldn't go get another on my own, but I'd take another if it was given to me."
"I won't pursue this brew but would drink it again if given to me."
"Poured a wonderful black, touched at the edges with ruby. Very little head, and that lasted mere seconds. Aroma was subdued - just a mild roasted malt. Mild roasted malt flavors, just a touch of smoke and chocolate. Mouthfeel is rather thin, with a little sweet slickness. Almost more of a sweet stout than a porter. Overall, this was just okay, but not at all festive."
"The mouthfeel was average and I will enjoy this Xmas brew again."
"I admit it. I bought Santa's Butt because of the label. That, and I am a fan of porters. If it's worth a giggle, buy one. The beer inside the bottle is mediocre."
"Reflection: This is a good example of an English porter, but I don't know if I would want to have more than a couple of these in one sitting. After 2 I would want something with more body to it."
"Had this brew on cast last evening at Mahars. Not a bad brew, poured to a black color but with a brownish tinge. Had a nice tan head that had fair retention and left some lacing. Chocolate is the scent that I was able to pick up right off along with some roasted or burnt malt. Not a bad smelling brew. The taste was fair, some nice chocolate and roasted flavors. The one thing that I noticed is that it seemed that the brew should have been thicker maybe. Over all it is a nice example of an English porter and one I would have again but do feel that there are better choices out there."
"Drinkability is average, just doesn't follow through. In my mind this was a beer that never belonged in a bottle, probably great on firkin and cask but somewhat wasted in a bottle. Kudos for a great label though."
"A very dark brown, almost black ale with ruby highlights.There is a small dark beige head that disappears quickly. Has a chocolate like malt aroma with hints of biscuit in the background. The flavor starts witha nice chocolate note and finishes with a light sweetness."
