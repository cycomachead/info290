There is a mild tartness in the flavor as well. This beer has a low level of carbonation with an almost flat mouthfeel.

4.37,13.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,5,"Head gets to near two fingers of deep tan foam, mostly larger bubbles with a steady dissolve, more stick to the fat lacing than thus expected. Very dark brown liquid yet not quite black, you get a wide band of orange at the glass's bottom. The nose at first makes you think it will be softer and sweeter than it finally ends up, wiry length to the rum raisin to coffee ice cream, molasses crisp and caramel popcorn, more concentration than sugar to the fig, black grape, blackberry fruit scents, more pastry flakes than bread, still touch of wheaties or bran cereal. Medium-bodied, muscular mouth presence with tight carbonation which nevertheless guides the whole from start through the finish. Goes low on the roast and toast, more scone, buttered biscuit, granola with distinct hoppy pep. If anything, there is a semi-burnt edge which plays off the sweetness of the caramel, coffee, chocolate powder, peanut brittle notes. The date, golden raisin, fig joins fresher cherry, apricot flavors. Dry, malty finish, flavors knit together and lift off the palate. Maddeningly easy to take sip after sip. That is, if you treat it is an English porter and not to be understood in the American idiom.","farrago","Oct 17, 2010"

The nose reminds me of light roast coffee and almost chocolate or fudge and maybe some caramel. The taste is subdued and easy. Smooth with any real bite at all only a slight bite of bitter in the end. I was hoping for something more like New Glarus Olde English Porter so it is kind of a let down in that respect but this is a very easy drinking porter. Very different compared to todays porters.

The taste is quite sweet, caramel, chocolatey, there is a roasted texture to the beer, and there is also some charred flavors near the finish. Overall, the beer is quite sweet, has a slightly tart caramel and butterscotch flavor. This is a decent porter. There is enough hop presence to give the beer a bit of a bittering balance, but not so much as to take away from the sweetish caramel flavors in the backbone of the beer. A good beer, worth seeking out.","albern","0"

There is a very minor hop presence that perks the beer up so it isn't a syrupy mess, and it does go down with only a mild drying sensation and rather smooth.

Instead, the smell is mostly sweet and malty, with a decidedly chocolate base. The taste is similar, with a lot of sweetness, caramel, and fruit. Plums come out right away. Again, chocolate is prominent in the taste. The finish is sweet as well. I thought that a little more hops wouldnt have hurt the balance on this one.

3.98,3.4,4,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,"One nice porter, hands down. I can't recall why this is a beer in the news, but regardless, this was a crowd favorite at the discussion tent at the World Beer Festival. Many asked for seconds and I had to agree with them. Darker than others in this style, nice malty chocolate with a hint of hoppiness. I would love to try this one again soon but unsure where to find it.","Backer2004","0"

4.32,12.2,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Medium bodied, smooth, almost creamy after the carbonation drops away. A lingering smoky maltiness and molasses. Yummy! "Thank you, kind publican, may I have another?"","PorterLambic","May 24, 2005"

3.59,-6.8,4.5,3,3.5,4,4,"This has always been a favorite English Porter; of course, you need to find it. My bottle has a weak, quick dissolving head, but holds a smell a bit rendolent of molasses. A very dark color and rich bodied beer, this beer (supposedly) is brewed with yeast brought up from a shipwreck. Urban legend or not, this is a great quaff that must be drank at room temperature.","jjboesen","Apr 05, 2005"
4.35,13,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Drinkability- I'f I can find it again, I'll probably snag a few more. I think it was about $2.75 per, but worth it.","GClarkage","Mar 29, 2005"

3.88,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Medium bodied, and smooth, rather nice - it's brewed to an 1800s recipe with a yeast recovered from an 1825 shipwreck.","mschofield","Mar 05, 2005"
4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich and creamy black and chocolate malt scent. It is sweet with a bit of a dry finish. The taste is good as well. It has a black and earthy flavor with a sweet, creamy chocolate malt finish. It's thin, but a very flavorful beer that drinks well. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine porter. I love the chocolate characteristics. It has a great aroma and taste; a good drinker.","WesWes","Mar 01, 2005"

3.83,-0.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Mouthfeel is a little thin, Id prefer a bit thicker feel on the tongue. There is something in the taste, maybe a lack of hops which bring the sweetness in balance which hurts drinkability a bit, but good overall. Worth a try for sure and Ill probably pick up a couple more.","blitz134","Dec 02, 2004"
4.42,14.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Although I normally prefer (often big) American porters to (often not so big) English ones, I wouldn't change a single thing about Old Flag. It's a classic version and is great beer no matter what flag you drink under.","BuckeyeNation","Nov 27, 2004"

3.54,-8.1,3,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Dark brown almost black in color with a minimal light brown head that reduces to just a ring. The aroma is chocolatey, and roasty, with coffee notes.

4.72,22.6,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,5,"Silky, rather than syrupy, on the tongue. Light yet flavorful, this traditional porter is clear in its influence on its contemporaries. Roasted, smoky flavors. Singed chocolate and grilled fruit concentrated and rehydrated. Remarkably delicate and well balanced. Just easy, good, flavorful drinking.","marburg","May 26, 2004"
5,29.9,5,5,5,5,5,"Absolutely beautiful. Gorgeous, velvety, feminine perfumes of baked blue fruits and Caribbean chocolate. On the palate it is rain water clear with chunky, meaty suggestions of marrow, roasted seeds, blackberry paste, bitter chocolate, smoky branches and creosote. Much lighter than modern Porter convention would have it, there is something profoundly drinkable about this brew. Very complex, succulent and interesting. The best Porter ever.","putnam","Apr 06, 2004"
3.87,0.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,3,"Taste combines a slightly dry malt flavor with an almost brown-sugar sweetness. Its not as dry toast bitter as I expected, but its really a nice, filling sensation. However, the sweetness accumulates and makes it necessary for some water.","freed","Mar 06, 2004"
3.99,3.6,3,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights when held to the light. Small tan head quickly disappears but some lace is left along the sides of the glass. Roasted aroma with dark chocolate and rum. Flavor is dominated but raosted malt, dark chocolate and coffee. Hints of dark fruit and molasses are also present. Hops are not noticable and the bitterness is provided by roasted grain. Thinner then expected and smooth. Nice drinkability, nothing heavy to stop you from having a few. A solid porter.","Lupe","Feb 27, 2004"
3.88,0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"This is a nice porter. Not as heavy as some. Pours a limited head that leaves quickly. Even so there is a bit of lacing. Very dark amber. Chocolate smell. I didn't notise the alcohole. The flavor is chocolate with the light tar expected from English porters. Not heavy on the tongue move like a lager then a porter. Usually I drink a porter for favor and approach it like food. This porter is actually refreshing. This is worth a try.","57andcounting","Beers"
3.43,-10.9,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"It poured dark dark ruby black with a small tan head. Got a good whiff of a woody and smokey odor. My first reaction is this brew is not nearly as heavy as I expected. Its very smooth with typical porter flavor punctuated by an almost fruity aspect. The finish is very sweet and sugary. It's ok, although I would say it tastes like a borderline porter.","Hhawk06","0"
3.68,-4.4,4,3.5,4,4,3,"Pours out very dark and lovely. Nearly opaque black with faint red highlights when held up to the light. Aroma is medicinal/alcoholic, roasty and fruity. Taste is very complex with dry roasted malt as the primary profile with hints of coffee, smoke, raisin, chocolate, black pepper, and licorice. Lactic acid like sourness also adds to the complexity. A bit thicker than most other ordinary porters Ive tried. The complexity makes the drinkability suffer a bit. Makes a fine sipping beer to wind down the night.","rajendra82","Dec 26, 2003"
3.92,1.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Poured a dark brown with ruby tints. Not too much head just some bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. Smelled sweet with plenty of molassas and brown sugar. Taste was more heavily coffee flavored with tasty sweetness and a doughy finish. Thin mouthfeel without much carbonation. All in all a tasty beer.","GreatPondBrewer","Dec 04, 2003"
3.92,1.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Brewery website has an interesting story about the recovery, analysis, and development of this Porter's recipe, and the 1825 shipwrecked barge from which they got the yeast strain.","merlin48","Beers"
4.32,12.2,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Poured a very dark brown with a reddish tinge. Head was small, tan and didn't hang around for a while. Lacing was moderate, with a nice collar of foam visible throughout this beer's time in my glass. Smell was of roasted malt, similar to dark chocolate with subtle cherry notes. Taste was of dark, rich, velvety chocolate with fruity notes hovering in the background. The mouthfeel is pleasingly thick. This beer has a filling, stick-to-yer-ribs effect, and would be great paired up with a nice dessert. This same richness works against it in drinkability, as its a little to heavy for repeated pints. All in all a nice porter.","woemad","0"
