I love the taste - it has woody and slight nutty grain which comes off like a high cocoa content dark chocolate taste with subtle earthy elements and hint of hops giving balance but the balance does seem to be more dry than sweet and bitter with slight pine flavor and gentle dark sugar notes.

4.13,-0.2,4.5,4,4.5,3,4,"Pretty Things December 6th, 1855 East India Porter pours almost entirely black. There's a little bit of cherry shining through at the bottom of the glass, and that's it. There are about three fingers of light caramel head sitting atop the beer. Retention is outstanding, the head's creep down the side of the glass is a slow one. There's a solid ring of lace marking the apex of the head, but below that it's little too spotty. The nose is predominantly roasted coffee, with solid support from dark chocolate aromas. A nice herbal note lies far in the background, but keeps things interesting. The malt profile of the flavor is very similar to that of the aroma, with coffee being the primary note. Chocolate is a little bit more present here though. The bitterness of the coffee melds into bitterness from the hops, before closing with a subdued herbal noble hop flourish. The body is is a serious letdown, nowhere near rich/full enough and it crosses the line into watery. The carbonation is appropriately subdued, and doesn't overtake the lackluster body. I enjoyed this most recent entry in the Once Upon A Time series when it was fresh, but thought a little bit of time would improve it some. I think I was right, but held on to this bottle a month or two too long.","axeman9182","Oct 09, 2011"

As it warmed it got a touch one sided as some elements of peat started to break the surface. But taken the first sip all was forgotten.

If this is anything like what the British were drinking in the 1800s, they were truly spoiled. The history buff in me is really loving Pretty Things' dedication to these recreations too. Keep up the good work guys (and ladies).","ryan1788a5","Jul 01, 2011"

4.6,11.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,"And the taste follows suit of the nose. Rich and roasty and very bitter. Dark cocoa like tannins which I believe are from the roasted malt, and flavors of unroasted barley. Very pruney in the mouth with raisin and fig about. Bakers chocolate, earthy hops, tobacco and leather. Semi sweetness in the way of burnt sugar and caramel is swiftly dried out in the long chewy finish. Some red currant flavors and molasses rule the palate on the finish and in the middle. Possibly my favorite porter I've had, but hard to say. So much going on and so complex.","mcallister","Jun 29, 2011"
4.5,8.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The beer pours a dark brown to almost black with very little to no light getting through. the head is tan and thick and holds to the side of the glass. the smell is rich roasty and hoppy. the flavor follows suit with a bit of hop flavor melded together with the roasted malt flavor, followed by a nice bitter finish. the mouthfeel is medium bodied and low to medium carbonation. overall a really excellent brew.","rowingbrewer","Jun 29, 2011"
4.13,-0.2,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Taste is... deep and earthy, the roasted malt really stands out. The alcohol seems to warm the palate and intensifies the malty goodness. There is a surprising hops bitter finish that fights through the deep malt backbone of this beer. Its really different, and its fantastic.","WSB","Jun 28, 2011"
4.36,5.3,3,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Overall: I'm pretty impressed by this beer. I think this and Jack D'Or are my favorite Pretty Things beers and as a porter/stout fan, I think this is great. If this is the beer that was popular in the 1800s, I'm jealous. I would pick this up as soon as you can. Cheers!","SkunkWorks","Jun 27, 2011"
4.17,0.7,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O: Goes down easily, very tasty, not filling, mild kick, great representation of style. This has got to be one of my favorite porters. Yet another solid offering from Pretty Things.","Jayli","Jun 27, 2011"
4.25,2.7,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"O: This is an excellent porter and definitely an interesting piece of history at the same time. I like porters but I find that most are a bit too smoky - a characteristic that isn't overpowering in this brew. The hoppiness is quite intriguing, it's kinda like an american black ale/black ipa but with extra roast and chocolate and coffee.","Dope","Jun 26, 2011"

4.15,0.2,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"O: The beer is very easy to drink and goes down smoothly because there is a good balance between the roasted flavors and bitterness.","metter98","Jun 08, 2011"
3.75,-9.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A very good beer dark in color with a slight tinge of blood red. The brownish head slowly wisps away like a ghost. The aroma of this beer hints at licorice, and roasted malts. A slight creaminess gives way to a slight bitterness with hints of burnt coffee, roasted malts, and anise. Had it at Sapsuckers in Huntington, New York.","angelogarcia3","Jun 07, 2011"
3.7,-10.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"On tap at the new Porter Cafe in West Roxbury. Served in a Harpoon IPA glass. Dirty brown colored body. Thin white head. Chalky powdery cocoa smell. Taste was impressive, though. I found it unique to try a hoppy porter. The chocolate malt was there for the porter aspect, but there was definitely a nice dose of hops on the palate. Mouthfeel was a bit confusing though. Not thick enough for a porter, but heavy for an IPA. Doesn't hide the alcohol though, as I thought it was way above 6%. This is an interesting beer from Pretty Things. I am not sure that I fell in love, but I certainly am always impressed when I try a new PT beer.","morebeergood","Jun 06, 2011"
3.98,-3.9,4,3.5,4.5,3,4,"More Porter than IPA, but the hop presence is distinct. The body is surprisingly thin. The. Finish is cocoa with a bitter kick. Quite appealing.","smcolw","Jun 05, 2011"
4.23,2.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"O: This is not a novelty beer. This is a tasty and well constructed, very hoppy porter. If this were regularly available, I would probably buy it as frequently as the Smuttynose and Founders porters. However, one bomber is certainly enough for a sitting.","greybeardloon","Jun 04, 2011"
4,-3.4,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall - Good brew, if you can't decide between and IPA and a lighter stout or a black ale then this would be the #1 choice.","Centennial","Jun 01, 2011"
3.9,-5.8,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,4,"This certainly delivers the goods for any porter lover, which I am. The hoppiness isn't off the charts, but it does present a nice change of pace from the norm. I would have loved it if the roasted char had been dialed back just a bit.","coachdonovan","May 30, 2011"
4.2,1.4,4.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"Very dark brown with dark chestnut edges and a dense tan cap. Good head retention and solid sheets of lace clung to the glass. Interesting aroma, an odd combination of hops and malt. Toasted malts and burnt sugar, pine resin with a bit of sharp citrus, mild roast, and a hint of fruitiness. Notes of dark chocolate and vanilla as it warmed. Similar flavour profile with plenty of resinous bitterness, chocolate and roast, toasted bread, and milder contributions from fruity citrus and caramelized sugar. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, a little chalky and slightly astringent. I have to admit that this beer was a bit confusing to me at first, but as I worked through it I kept finding new layers of flavours as it warmed. I ended up liking it quite a bit.","DrJay","May 30, 2011"

4.67,12.8,4.5,5,4.5,4,5,"This is an amazing, wondrous thing. I have a feeling that if I had access to this beer, I would buy as much of it as I could every chance I got to keep it around for as long as I possibly could. From the initial aroma through to the feeling at the back of the throat, every sense and emotion that is evoked by this liquid is pleasant, and most of them blow me away with happy goodness. This would be in my daily rotation if it could be, without question!","route66pubs","May 27, 2011"

4.29,3.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Overall very enjoyable. It had more going that I thought it would. I expected a more straight porter, but characteristics of exciting brown ales and even Belgian style ales are found here.","jbertsch","May 26, 2011"
4.12,-0.5,4,4.5,4,4,4,"When I went to review this beer, I noticed that there is more than one instance of the word 'fine' in other people's reviews.

3.98,-3.9,4.5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"D: Not quite a beer I’d expect to me enjoying in the middle of May, but with all the rain and heavy air, this beer suits it perfectly. A fantastic porter that turns refreshing with hops at the end, making it seem lighter than it is.","phantomwyse","May 19, 2011"
3.58,-13.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"On tap at The Ginger Man NYC. Lacey, brown body and tan head. Understaed bitterness, despite claims of high IBU. Roast is understated. Oats,wheat, mollasses, lots of malt is what I mostly get.Fuller mouthfeel.","Sammy","May 19, 2011"
4.42,6.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer pours a cloudy brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great! It has a really nice roasted malt scent along with a touch of hop aroma and a solid crystal/chocolate malt sweetness. It's dry with an excellent roasted nose. The taste is great as well. Again, the roasted character comes through nicely with dry toasted feel. Chocolate and caramel malts add a beautiful layer of sweetness that really rounds out the flavor. The hop character is outstanding. It packs a powerful bitterness up front and resinates through to the finish. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a damn fine English India Porter. It would be an excellent porter alone, but the hops add a good deal of depth; very nice.","WesWes","May 19, 2011"
3.95,-4.6,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Can smell the hops off the bat with a little bit of chocolate and coffee. It's got a pretty decent bitterness, fading into the malt and chocolate and then back to the pine and floral hops. She drinks easy and delightful. Not thick, medium-bodied, but very pleasant. Yes, another pretty thing.","dragonWhale","May 19, 2011"

4.3,3.9,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"The beer is very interesting, almost like an IPA porter, if there is such a concoction out there. It has a very burnt, charred, and biting hop flavor with all the roasted chocolates, dark malts, and creaminess that you would fine in a porter. It isn't boozy, nor does it have the acerbic caramel and oakiness that you would find in an imperial stout, just the smooth, milky cacao and chocolate powder with some bittering hop that defines the beer. I will go back for another and add to the review.","albern","May 08, 2011"

4.15,0.2,4.5,4.5,4,4,4,"Taste is bitter bakers chocolate and roast malt to the point of char. Bursting with herbal and pine sap hops. Hops not only add flavor in and of themselves, but also push the dark malt flavors forward.","donkeyrunner","May 05, 2011"
