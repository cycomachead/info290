"This is probably the best English porter I've ever had, but it's probably not very traditional. It tastes awesome, and that's what it counts."
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is extremely flavorful, rivaling that of a Russian Imperial Stout, except there is no bitterness and is obviously lighter in body."

"My love-hate relationship with Shorts Brewing is being won over today by my second excellent offering from their brewery. This porter pours a deep almost black mahogany with a nice tan head and substantial tan lacing. The aroma is overwhelmed by rich chocolate, sweet malt, and a touch of hops. The mouth is smooth and creamy. Fairly heavy for a porter but strictly in the best of ways. The flavor adds a significant amount of coffee and roast to the notes found in the nose. Their is surprisingly little alcohol bite given the abv. It is very drinkable and enjoyable. Shorts is still the quintessential hit or miss brewery for me but this is definitely a hit."

"Overall- Excellent example of a porter that I enjoyed very much. It rivals Edmund Fitzgerald and Black Butte, and is somewhere in between those and Everett Porter, which still reigns supreme in the Porter category. Anyway, this is probably the one Short's beer that I'm most impressed with so far."
""
""
"O - Very impressed by this beer. One of the best beers I've had by Short's."
"Overall, this porter is interesting and intriguing. You can't miss the sweet malt backbone, yet it's the bitterness and husk astringency that probably will strike most drinkers. There's a subtle alcohol warmth throughout that gives an added dimension to things."

"Poured from a bottle a jet black color with a light off-white head. Has a chocolate and malty aroma. Taste is sweet dark chocolate with a touch of bitterness in the finish. I also get some malts and coffee. Has a medium to full body feel and goes down smooth. A very tasty porter."

"O- I'm impressed with this one. A well put together porter with style. A smooth sweet and rich roasted malt flavor flawlessly balancing a bitter hop backbone. Rich chocolate warming the way to the gullet. This is one fine example of a porter. I acquired this bottle in a ""pick yer six"" at a local, well stocked beer store for my first try and I'm very pleased. I will definitely be picking up a sixer of these in the future."
""
""
""
"Overall - Good beer. Was not expecting such a smoky character like was experienced but in a good way. This beer does not drink like a 9% beer for me, it is smooth, smoky, alcohol is not overwhelming."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I honestly feel like this is Short's best beer, and I doubt they could top this one. Brilliant brew."

"O: Interesting. A bit too roasty and bitter to enjoy a lot of but pleasant in small quantities."
"Highly recommended. A great brew, thanks abanton for sharing yet another great brew!!!"

"O- A really tasty beer, great mix of chocolate and fruit."

"O-nice porter with good labor and balance, really enjoyable"
""
"This is a great porter. Very glad to try it and will buy again in the future."
"Wasn't expecting much out of this, but it turned out to be pretty good. I like things that are super-roasted, and that's exactly what this is. A little heavy on the alcohol character, though. This one is definitely a slower sipper than I pictured it would be."

"It was a nice dark brown color when being poured into a pint class with a nice coffee aroma. It went down easy for a porter, an enjoyable brew. My liver is happy that I only had one and that it is discontinued because I could definitely drink more of these."
""
""

"o - interesting beer and enjoyable, but not what i look for in an english porter (or any other porter for that matter). too much focus on the roasted flavors not enough else going on for depth. also, the higher abv makes this a one and done for the night beer."

"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, the beer was a dark murky brown color with an off-white lacing coating the glass. A beautiful sweet dark coffee aroma exploded from the glass. A $4 coffee rarely smells this exciting. The initial taste was sweet dark chocolate blending nicely with the sour notes. A traditional English Porter should have sour aspects to it, but should not overwhelm the rest of the beer. Despite being an imperial, the sourness is well balance with other aspects of the beer. Notes of molasses and burnt sugar were also detectable. The dark chocolate and sour notes continue into the aftertaste but begin to evolve. The 9.15 ABV is well masked until the warming sensation in the aftertaste, lingering nicely. Being a porter, the beer is on the thicker side while still being an easy drinker. No aspect of the beer overwhelms, allowing everything to be well balance. Well Done!"
"O: Perfect finish for the cold day at work outside. I'd love to have a few of these! I'd order another and buy 6."

"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled 12/15/2011. Pours pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some nice thick soapy lacing clings to the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, coffee, char, molasses, earth, and light herbal. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of huge dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, char, earth, caramel, molasses, and herbal. Fair amount of spicy and roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, char, caramel, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and complexity of highly robust flavors; good malt/bitterness balance as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present on the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent imperial porter! Very robust and complex with great flavor balance; and very smooth to sip on. Highly enjoyable."
""
"O. An excellent and unique porter. Thicker and sweeter than most I have had. Distinctive is its slightly syrupy mocha flavor. This is very good stuff and highly recommended."
""
"O- Really nice beer. Exactly what I'm looking for in a traditional english porter. Well done Shorts!"
""
""
"One of the more interesting beers I've had in quite a while to be sure...one that pushes the boundaries of the style in a surprising and interest-grabbing way. It will definitely help me sleep tonight."
""
""
""
"Quite nice, and dangerously sessionable."
""
"Overall: Wow. This is in a grey region between stout and imperial porter but the moral of the story is that this beer is amazing. Much stronger in flavor than I thought. There is a fantastic amount of chocolate playing with vanilla in here which comes out of no where for porters. The sweetness is spot on! I really can't think of much to be improved on the taste front. Without a doubt, one of the best porters I have ever had. This is just what beer is all about."
"D/O- A very filling beer to say the least. Would recommend if you are a big porter fan. Thanks for this want CaptCeleveland! Appreciate it!"
"Overall, decent, big-bodied porter with a tasty flavor profile"
""
"M - Medium body. Light carbonation."
""
""
"O: At first I wasn’t the biggest fan, but as it warmed it grew on me. Pretty darn good, not the best porter I’ve ever had, but its is still quite good."
"Overall I didn't expect much after this disappointing ""woodmaster"" but this is a solid imperial Baltic porter as good as Flying Dog's Gonzo. Worth the high grade."
"O- A very enjoyable and well made beer from Short's. Drinks nicely, but it is a touch of a sipper considering the strong flavors and higher alcohol content."
""
"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter. Pours black with a brown head. The aroma is medium to heavily roasted with dark creamy chocolate up front. Undertones of dark fruits/prunes, brown sugar, cold coffee, dark syrup and vanilla. The flavour is medium sweet and light bitter with notes of dark creamy chocolate, roasted malt and coffee/espresso on the finish. Some brown sugar/molasses. The mouthfeel is soft and light sticky with a light carbonation. Maybe a touch of astringents. Bit sourish and acidic. Medium to full bodied. Overall a decent porter."
"Overall - One of the best Short's beers I've had. Quite enjoyable. It gets better as I drink it, too."
"o - if there was ever a brewery that was hit or miss, it is short's...probably more-so than any other. publican porter, however, is a HIT. really solid porter. more balls than you'd expect for the style and the bakers chocolate is rich enough that it makes the style really accessible for folks more on the stout side of the universe. i quite enjoyed this one and would be more than happy to drink this regularly...oh wait, short's distro is non-existent. oh well...if you get this and are into extras, hit me up. i'd love some more. thanks for the taste, really great brew."
""
""
"O- I love the way Short's pushes the boundaries. I'll continue to buy their ""out of the box"" brews because they make so many ""hits."". Unfortunately, thre's the occasional chance of a ""miss"" in there. I'm sure others, as suggested by the overall score, will love this beer. While the aroma hints at so much potential, the smoke and licorice side just doesn't do it for me."

"Bottle. Popped and poured into a small delerium snifter. Surprisingly this pours with very little carbonation or head. Only a slight dark mocha tan head forms after swirling but quickly retreats to a collar around the glass. Metallic right off the bat but I also get some roast coffee, dark chocolate, and booze in the nose. The aroma I am not that keen on. Medium mouthfeel, velvety...nice. Bittersweet chocolate, roast, leather, and alcohol. The bitterness from the roast cuts a little at the end and lingers on. Overall, I’m not all that impressed by this. I'm a little confused by all the high ratings for this. The picture depicts one of their one off beers and the bottle I have is a regular 12oz, I wonder if they scaled up production and some quality got lost in translation?"
""
"Good sweetness, solid roast, and complex to boot. This has a lot going for it. Seek it out."
"This is a fine porter. From the bottle into a short mug. Two fingers of caramel colored head, near black body. Warm and rosty, hints of ripe fruit. This porter is strong but the alcohol is not prominent in mouth feel or taste. Perfect for a winter evening. Lovely with a rich stew."
""
"This one apparently was not brewed only once. 12 oz bottle. This is a thick, viscous, dark beast of a beer. The smell is sugary with cocoa overtones. The flavor is full on kick ass English-style porter. Yes, it is imperial but it isn’t too boozy. An unexpectedly kickass offereing."
""
"Edit1/19/13 this years is a little less sweet with a good aroma, I like this one a little more, Short's nailed this one."
""
""
"Overall, this is a really great porter. I wish I would have grabbed a lot more of this. I could easily get a case of this without any regrets. The drinkability is perhaps what makes this what it is. It goes down so great, and has a flavor that makes you want more. The alcohol is nearly invisible. I'm surprised I just found out about this gem from Shorts recently. Look forward to trying the rest."
"Pours nearly black in color with a small tan head. Quite a bit of roasted malt and licorice. Some molasses and dark chocolate aromas are also present. It’s somewhat oxidized and there’s a little dark fruit character, to it. A really nice roasted malt flavor to this. A hint of graham cracker and vanilla sweetness. There’s a bit of molasses and licorice, too. Medium body with a low to medium carbonation."
"Black, opaque and a slight tan head after a vigorous pour. Smells of coffee, chocolate, molasses and dark fruits. I taste big roasted malts and chocolate. Very robust. This is very much not unlike a Russian Imperial Stout. Finishes dry. Mouthfeel is heavy and lightly carbonated. Overall, I'm glad I tried it. But this is too much like an RIS to set it apart."
""
"Straight forward, solid, but for some reason I was expecting even more. Well worth trying."
""
"Overall: Not a bad offering from Shorts. Not quite up to Founders Porter level but this is a decent porter which I could see myself drinking again, kinda too bad it's a special release. Will definitely grab another six if it comes around again and I see it but probably wouldn't go to an extreme to get it."
""
"O - Between this and Black Cherry Porter, I really wish Short's would do a year-round porter, as they are both very good. Hope this becomes at least an annual release, if not more often."
""
""
""
""
"The taste does not disappoint. Bitterish coffee notes up front. Roasted malts follow, but soon turn sweet and chocolatey. Caramel and dark fruit play together, before iced mocha java takes us to the finish. Notes of nougat, vanilla, molasses, smoke, and peat flash here and there and settle in for a long roasty-sweet finish. Medium-full body with a slightly sticky feel. A delicious, sinfully good beer! A great way to start off this New Year's Eve!"
"O: It was a very good porter from Short's, perhaps I'd give it higher marks if I hadn't be used to drinking so many wonder barrel aged porters lately. I do which this or sustenance would be available year-end."
""
""
"Pours out a dark brown hue that has a thin tan head with decent retention and lacing. The smell is of chocolate,roasted coffee and dark fruits. The taste starts out with chocolate, some dark fruit and coffee and follows with some molasses and licorice. The alcohol is covered quite well and is a rather smooth easy drinking beer for the style and overall a very well made tasty beer that I would gladly buy again."
"The taste has a strong dark chocolate flavor, lots of roasted malt, maybe some graham crackers, and a very slight bitter finish. The alcohol is masked well, keeping this very drinkable."
""
""
""
""
"This appears a solid, dark black color with a cocoa-hued layer of foam sitting atop it. It has a great roasty aroma that carries over to the taste. I pick up a lot of sharp roastiness, some dark coffee and definitely a bit of dark chocolate. This is a good one."
""
"dark brown, nice opagueness, but still some light through on the sides and bottom. Nice short lived off white head with decent lace and audible carbonation. Smell was a decent english average porter. Caramel sugar and roasted malts were really the most notable aromas. The taste was smooth, crisp, a tad watery with the caramel being mellowed somewhat by a nice albeit small hoppy back."
"Overall: Every time I come to Michigan is another chance to try a new Shorts beer, if I can find them on tap. I really enjoyed this full flavorful porter and would definitely drink it again."
""
""
""
"If you made it this far in the review I am sure you can tell that I really love this beer. It is one of my new Short’s favorites and I am pretty damn excited that they are going to bottle it. It is not perhaps the easiest drinking porter due to its size, but it should be a great fall/winter brew that will keep you full and warm as you throw a couple back with good friends."
"O - Every time I drink a Short's beer in a small bottle they leave me a bit let down but then we drink one of these imperial bottles and they quickly win me back. I hope to try some of the other imperials some day..."
"O - Really good beer, Shorts tries a lot of interesting stuff, and much of it goes the wrong way, but this was something that worked really well. Wish I could get this regularly."
"O - Excellent porter. The alcohol is barely detectable and the smooth dark fruity chocolate notes are delicious. Def drink now, as it's just ""on"". Recommend."
"D: A great porter! Outstanding flavor. I really enjoyed this one as a ""palate cleanser"" between sours."
"Silky chocolate chewy, viscous malty mouthfeel with a lot of strong alcohol and oak character. Slightly vinous with subtle hints of dark fruit. Subtle hop notes this provide slight balance and a lingering dry hot alcohol finish."
"D: Damn tasty brew that is pretty drinkable."
"Medium to full body is well carbonated. Great beer from Short's."
"Recommended for others, but not something I will want to track down again."
"Some vinous aged qualities in the nose, also tootsie roll, licorice, and sticky molasses. Roasty flavors of burnt toast, wood, and tobacco, underscored by a mild yet pleasant cranberry tartness. Full bodied and chocolatey, leaning into stout territory. Creamy feel with a dry finish. Easy drinking, and a good one to share. Although it's starting to show it's age a little, it was still a pleasure to drink. Thanks again Wes!"
"D - Nice beer."
"RBSG09 bottle at the grand tasting. Dark brown color with mahogany highlights and a tan head. Some coffee aroma, chocolate malt balls. Typical well-balanced chocolate and coffee with surprising notes of sherry and light vinegar. Clean dry finish, interesting beer."
"The taste is really well done, and it's apparent that time has done this beer well. Bitter as expected, and relatively sweet and salty. The sweetness is predominantly chocolate roasted malts, with a subtle cola taste. The caramel malts stick out as well on the finish, an aged hop presence really does this beer justice. Everything in this beer works. The beer's mouthfeel is very smooth, and works well with the roast characteristics that come out in the taste. really nicely done."
"Flavor is more roasted malts and some molasses. This is very full and creamy on the mouthfeel. Just a hint of hops noticeable. Reminds me of a Expedition that is a year or two old. Very good beer. Very solid."
"Very drinkable. I shared some with my dad. But I could have finished the bottle myself. The only potential impediment is the sweetness."
"D - It's a little too sweet to be highly drinkable, but still quite nice. Nice carbonation and well hidden alcohol. Another solid brew from Short's!"
"This is another original and very tasty brew from Shorts. It's got a fantastic nose with tons of complexity and a solid flavor profile as well."
"Tastes carob chocolate. Caramel, cookie dough (with chocolate chips), brown sugar, and a little bit of roast. Cherry fruity rides clean alcohol. Tries to be sticky sweet, but the alcohol clears the palatte. Great mouthfeel and wonderfully drinkable. Has a creaminess that keeps the beer from being too drying. Sweet in the mouth, drying finish from an acidic bite, but not overly done."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and had a good viscosity. Carbonation is on the more mellow side which works nice. Goes down almost too easily. Overall, a good imperial porter and it is holding up extremely well after two years in the bottle now. Very glad I had the chance to try this and I hope Short's brews it again."
"I'm glad Steve scored this. I would've passed it up based on the label alone, note knowing that the bottle was a really nice beer. It's like meeting a woman in a dark room and after you hit it off with her, the lights come on and she's a winner when you were expecting the worst."
"Notes from 8/29/08"
"D: It's bold, but I like it."
"Thank you Derek for bringing. Very good roast aroma. A dark thick chocolate pour. A whote head with lots of bubbles. Thick and lacey down thye glass. A porter's imitation of an imperial stout. Roasted malt. Above average mouthfeel. Some sips, at the end of the bottle, contained some sourness. Recommended."
"This was one of the most hyped beers coming out of the Short's imperial series but that might have been because it had the least amount of bottles produced, I really was not all that impressed with it though, not worth the twenty dollars in my opinion, would not drink again mainly because of the price, worth trying if possible"
"A good beer but from the other reviews and noise I've heard from this beer I expected a bit more."
"Serious looking beer. Pitch black and opaque, with a long lasting, super dark tan head. Outstanding nose combines premium dark chocolate, dark roast coffee and dark fruit. Flavor is tremendously rich, decadent and complex, with layers of aged malt character. Everything about this beer is impressive. Tank aged nearly 8 months before bottling. 18 months in the bottle and shows no oxidation. Impressive extraction and flavor concentration. Beautiful dark color, plus it's hand numbered, hand bottled and bottle conditioned. A terrific beer."
"Drinkability: A porter par excellence and another fine, unique offering in a long line of fine, unique offerings from Short's."
"Pours ink black with one of the darkest brown heads I've seen on a beer, full and creamy head. Aroma is a very nice blend of roasty malts, slightly smokey, but more nutty, good chocolate presence as well. Swirl in the glass brings up some nice dark fruits, raisins and prunes. Hints of dark molasses and bourbony alcohol in the aroma as well. Taste follows the aroma, dark fruits are more easily evident, chocolate, roasty nutty malts, a hint of a grassy hop to balance. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body, very creamy, with just a bit of hop tingle n the tongue, nice roasty after taste leaves just a small bit of dryness and alcohol warmth. Had this one for the first time at the 08 anniversary party and it blew me away. This however was after much drinking at dl day and had to confirm that this wasn't just my warped taste buds talking that night. After killing the 750 by myself tonight I can be sure that this is a phenomenal beer, easily one of my favorite shorts beers and possibly the best of the imp series. Seek it out before I buy the rest."
"Initially easy to drink for the ABV, it is quite heavy compared to the usual porter and over time it gets a bit too much. I did not finish mine."
