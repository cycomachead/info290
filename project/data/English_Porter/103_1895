We did, however, feel a bit skimped on the flavoring and sweetness that we have come to love the style for. Instead, the robust, lighter, and sweet malt profile was replaced by something more akin to a dry Irish stout. We found this beer to be decent, and a pleasant experience, but we were not overly satisfied or excited by much at all.","TheBrewo","Oct 07, 2012"

3.45,-10.6,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured cold into a pint glass this hybrid brew looks nearly black mahogany in color, can't see through it. The half-inch light tan colored head settles to a decent covering pretty quickly and a blanket of lacing shows well. The aroma says licorice-malt, deep with molasses and some charcoal. Pretty nice. The flavor brings a sweet brown sugar malt and yeasty brown bread. Maybe a grass hop dry finish in there. But I think the final analysis features a charcoal malt taste that comes with a thinnish bodied brew with some tinny highlights. Pretty effervescent and drinkable enough if you like the flavor. Seems a bit too thin and doesn't really capture the scotch ale qualities that the label claims. Okay but not one I'll revisit most likely.","Durge","Nov 29, 2009"

3.45,-10.6,4,4,3,3.5,3.5,"I poured this Scottish Ale/Porter into a Victory pint glass. At first, this beer appears to be a jet black color, but a closer inspection led me to believe that it was more of a cherry mahogany brown with a few small traces of crimson red along the edges. On top of this beer was light tan colored 1/2 an inch head of foam. It had nice slow retention that left behind a spotty tan film and a small amount of tan spots of lace around the glass. The aroma was lightly roasted with dry roasted coffee beans, a hint of roasted malts, a touch of sweet caramel, a small drop of pine, and a speck of of roasted barley at the finish line. Nice Porter aroma! The taste however was lacking the roasted punch that the aroma had. It tasted like they watered down the beer a bit. The taste started off nice with roasted barley and roasted coffee beans, but then the taste went south. After the coffee beans, in comes some water to wash down the roasted flavor impact that the previous flavors gave the taste. It did end with a nice crispy floral hoppy finish though. But it was the water that ruined the taste for me. The mouthfeel was medium bodied with a crispy yet roasted aftertaste of roasted malts, a splash of caramel, a hint of coffee beans, and a small touch of roasted floral hops. In the end it was a great looking Porter, a great smelling Porter, but an average tasting Porter.","AltBock","Aug 31, 2008"

Smokey chocolate malt and toffee on the tongue at first followed by a hint of scotch and oak flavors. The ringwood yeast taste fits in very well with this beer and doesn't over power in the least bit. Aftertaste is of coffee and cane sugar that leaves the tongue slightly dry. Medium to full body with a very smooth feel. Carbonation is slight and tingles the mouth. This is probably one of Middle Ages better beers although it doesn't get much recognition because of the style, it's just not "imperial" enough.

As it was drank it produced a fairly decent lace to the bottom of the glass. The aromas the emerged from the glass were of sweet fruit (apples, grapes, etc), roasted dark malt, nuts, coffee, some bitter chocolate and tones of fresh earth. As it warmed the fruit and coffee seem to be more pronounced. The flavors produced slightly different tastes then the aroma would have hinted to, simple array of hops (pine) roasted malts, fresh coffee, notes of dark chocolate, more hops in the middle, hints of fruit arose and disappeared fairly fast, slate and hay as it ended. The aftertaste was of a burnt/bitter chocolate and coffee mixture - dry. The body was on the thinner side, a tad watery, not what I would have expected, would have liked some body for a beer like this. After being aged (left in the fridge) for 2 years it seems to have held up fairly well, when fresh it seemed to have more body, but even in its current state it is very drinkable.

Taste is reminiscent of a mix between a scotch ale and a porter with a nice dose of peat that mix very well with roasted bitter malt with a nice sweet touch. Body is above average and medium level of alcohol makes it a beer I could enjoy often. Very nice beer that doesnt seem to fall under a particular style.","Phyl21ca","Mar 12, 2006"

Fair sized dark tan head that has pretty good retention and did leave a fair amount of lacing along the sides of the glass. Very strong caramel malt aromas giving it a sweet scent with a slight alcohol smell. The taste seems to be more about the malt than anything else. Caramel with a candy like taste dominate, but I do sense a slight hop finish. Over all it is a good brew, not a favorite but one I would get again.","Stimack","Jan 23, 2006"
4.3,11.4,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Dark brown, garnet-burgundy highlights. Dense beige froth, about 1/4". Vanilla, caramel, roasted coffee, faint whiff of hops. Butterscotch, too, of course, as this is a Middle Ages brew, after all (gotta love the way they use that Ringwood!). Roasted coffee, dark caramel/chocolate malts. Herbal hops keep things spicy, and there is a meager smokiness, along with some mineral twang, at the finish. Unexpectedly, diacetyl does not show much in the taste. Rich mouthfeel; medium-bodied and creamy. An interesting beer, for sure. Seems to be more of a Scotch ale by the nose and more of a robust porter by the taste and palate. I'd really like to try this on tap. Definitely a buy-again beer -- great stuff!","orfeu","Dec 21, 2005"

I swear this was a dark reddish brown when poured, but it turns dark black with a somewhat creamy, but mostly bubbly head. Some mildly smoky flavors in the fore with hints of carmelized roast beef proceed a sweet mildly chocolate/cocoa powder middle and vaguely molasses tinged finish. A different and worthy approach to the style.","Jredner","Nov 23, 2005"

Poured a very deep mahogany color with adequate tannish head that feel to a nice ring. Smell is nice and roasty with notes of caramel present. Taste follows through with more roasted notes and some dark fruity tastes also present. Finished very mild with a moderate sweet maltiness and no hops to be found. I really enjoyed this beer, however it seemed more like a porter (Stegmaiers) than a scottish ale.","tgbljb","Oct 09, 2005"

The aroma has a bit of a smoky character with some caramel malt. The flavor is nice. Has a strong maltiness and a bit of smoked malt that is supposed to be there in a Scotch ale.

Some chocolate malt and a dash of coffee. Definitely smell more of a hybrid than the standard, but it smell damn tasty. Flavor is kicked off with dark sweet fruits with a strong roasted malt upfront. Pretty big chocolate and coffee as well. Light alcohol is noticeable as is some caramel. Quite the malt bomb going on here in a very complex and tasty way. Strong lingering roasty notes. About a medium body with a smooth creamy feel. Very drinkable stuff. This threw me off at first put by the end of the glass I was loving the stuff.

This brew is fresh, in fact this cask was just tapped two days prior to my arrival at the tusk. The aromas scream porter, but there are scotch ale undertones as well. I detect a bit of somked peat in the aroma, as well as roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, and a bit of the ole' booze as well. Taste is great. Creamy, roasty, with chocolate, caramel, and coffee notes all over the place. Wow, decadent is the word to sum up this drinking experience.

Tastes sweetish, butterscotchy, brown sugary, coffee, yeah. Slightly bitter end, like something roasted would be. Mouthfeel is lovely, fizzy enough so it doesn't get to be too much.

First of all, the beer looks quite amazing in the pint. It is almost jet black on first inspection, but look closer and there's a beautiful red tint around the edges of the glass. The head was a thick light tan, about half a finger, and receded rather quickly into an inviting ring, although with little lace. The smell is mostly roasted malts with some slight amount of hop undertones. There is also a delicate fruity burnt aroma. The taste is pleasant and warming (or maybe that's the alcohol), although some of the flavors are too unpronounced. It melds together into a nice overall taste, but its a bit sharp on the back of the palatte and I find myself wishing for a bit more malt presence. Don't mistake this for complaining, I could drink this beer all night (and I plan to). The mouthfeel is straightforward, not too thick not too thin, and plenty of small bubbles. Drinkability?

Heavily sweet malty aroma, almost has a slight milk tinge to it, whatever that means. Taste is stunning, the smoothness and heartiness of a porter, coupled with the sweetness and alcohol warming of my favorite style (at this point), the scotch ale. Taste did deteriorate a bit as warming occured during the drinking experience, but nothing too drastic. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both excellent as well.

The aroma is an intense mixture of Ringwood yeast, roasted barley, chocolate malts, and patent malts; truly excellant. The taste is very unique. You get that buttery feeling as it goes down, but there is that dark grain element that adds such complexity to the palate. It does have a lot of porter qualities to it, but I like a beer that is willing to push to envelope a little. The mouthfeel is fine, although it is medium to heavily bodied.

The smell was also very porterish, with sweet chocolate malts and burned currant flavors. It was bordering cloying in the nose, but not quite. The taste had a very interesting thing going on. There were some real huge robust porter flavors of toffee and coffee with seriously roasted malts, but it mellowed into a much more scottish ale type bear towards the end of the taste with blood red cherry and burned sugar fruits. There was just a touch of hops towards the finish. The Scotch qualities improved the further down it got with a much more warming mellow scotch flavor appearing. The mouthfeel was all ale with bubbley carbonation that was a little too fizzy. I would like a more flat mouthfeel, but not creamy like a malty stout or porter. More like a dubbel.

Others have commented how this beer falls in between a Scottish ale and a porter, and that is a fine description. Some upfront flavors have the smoky, grassy malts that are characteristic in a Scottish ale, and then the creaminess and dry finish as well as a lingering of coffee and roasted barley flavors indicate the porter. Excellent; tasty, warming, energizing, revitalizing, this beer should probably be treated as a porter since Scottish ales are delicate, smoky, and excellent as an after dinner drink. This beer has rougher edges, but could, in turn, be as useful as any good porter. The best of the Middle Ages beers I have tried.","Thrasher","Beers"
