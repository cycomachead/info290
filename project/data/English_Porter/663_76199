Overall, for the price purchased at Trader Joes make it a value for those who want a dark beer to relax to after a hard day at work. Although not a stellar porter is very easy to enjoy without the heavy alcohol content and sweetness that are found in others of this style.","EyeOfBuck","Aug 26, 2013"

Dial the carbonation back, keep the roast and chocolate flavor, get rid of the horrible finish and unwanted tartness. Sour, but not in a ‘good’ way—or in an ‘infected batch’ way, either. More like it’s just off-balanced and a poor brew. Perhaps oxidized? The flavor and the finish reminds me of all the bad qualities of two-buck Chuck. To say it improves slightly as it warms isn’t saying much. It’s off, and off-putting. I can’t say much good about this beer but it’s not horrible enough to trash outright.

3.05,-5.3,3.5,3.5,3,2,3,"T: Roasted malts and coffee upfront. Then the taste kind of just dies off. It's not bad and it's by far the best I've had from Kennebunkport, but it's pedestrian at best. The mouthfeel is really what kills it for me. It's way way thin.","notchucknorris","Jan 28, 2011"
4.02,24.8,3,3.5,4.5,4,4,"Taste is surprisingly pleasant with a nice doughy yeast that also throws off a few fruity esters. Roast is there but is balanced nicely by a rich sweetness and chocolate. Reminds me of an oatmeal stout without the viscous body. Has a nice mouthfeel, slick and smooth. I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would after seeing a few of the reviews and the overall score. Thanks Ken!","twiggamortis420","Dec 29, 2010"
2.95,-8.4,3,3,3,2.5,3,"This is a porter in appearance but that's about it. It "tastes dark" but doesn't have the mouthfeel or richness to back it up. And the overall flavor profile is a little too sweet and lacking the malty and/or smokey features that many great porters have. Porter is the kind of style you need to be in the mood for, so this could be a disappointment if you're looking forward to a big, rich experience. I'll stick with Anchor Porter when I'm so inclined.","hmk22","Aug 21, 2010"
3.39,5.3,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,3,"This beer is super dark and completely opaque, but unfortunately produces a thin weak head. The smell is malty sweetness, with some hints of toastiness. The taste is dominated by bread and dark fruit, which doesn't come across as too sweet and finishes with a nice dryness. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy, but this beer lacks something to set it apart.","jonB","Oct 01, 2009"

3.14,-2.5,2,3,3,3,4,"This beer probably would have gotten higher marks from me if it was called an amber. Definitely a miss for the style, but not a miss overall. It goes ok with food, it's affordable, just figure out another name for it. Or figure out how to brew it more consistently. After reading some reviews, they seem all over the map.","josiahschlender","Jul 10, 2009"
3.12,-3.1,3,3.5,3,3,3,"Drinkability:An average porter, that really does not jump out of the box. It is not bad, but will not wow you either. i would have it again, but one was enough.","tigg924","Mar 07, 2009"
3.23,0.3,3.5,3,3,3,4,"In the end, this was just a decent beer. Well, the smell, taste, and mouthfeel were the only decent things about this beer. The appearance was the best thing about this beer. I guess I could say that it was almost like beer eye candy. The drinkability is above average because I don't remember paying all that much for this beer. I think it was either below a $1 or just slightly above that. If you can find this beer for a low price, go for it!","AltBock","Feb 24, 2009"

3.5,8.7,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dark, almost black with a slight head that fades quickly. Almost no lacing. Smells like roasted malts and vanilla. Tastes of coffee and vanilla, finishes with a coffee/tea like bitterness. Light bodied with smooth carbonation, easy drinking. Decent gateway porter.","biggred1","Jan 06, 2009"
3.43,6.5,3,2.5,3.5,3.5,4.5,"Overall this is quite an interesting porter that's alcohol forward with an interesting vanilla flavor. It's easy on the mouth and is highly drinkable.","AdmiralDiaz","Jan 05, 2009"

2.9,-9.9,3.5,3.5,2.5,2.5,3,"The taste is dry hints of chocolate and coffee grounds, burnt bark, and a bit watery, with a burnt bitter finish and aftertaste. As it warms, it becomes more mellow, but, despite some nice chocolate, ghosty caramel, and other flavours lurking underneath, it's overall too sharp, burnt-bitter and plain for me to really want to drink.","Offa","Jun 01, 2008"

4.45,38.2,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"I understand why ol' TJ's chose this obscure brand (in the South anyway) as this is a quality beer. I find it interesting that most of the low ratings on this were from the brewpub on tap...whereas the TJ bottled version seemed to fare better.","AnalogReigns","Apr 02, 2008"
2.58,-19.9,3.5,3,2.5,1.5,2.5,"The taste is decent. Some coffee, some roasted malt that may be just a bit too acrid/charcoally, and a bit of chocolate to add sweetness. It's a thin mouth-feelin' beer, and the acrid aftertaste is offputting about halfway through, but all in all, it seems like the best these guys offer (which isn't saying much).","Overlord","Feb 29, 2008"
2.83,-12.1,3,2.5,3,2.5,3,"Poured a deep tannish brown with a thin cap of head and little to get excited about. A little bit of sweetness on the nose. Taste was a tad bit of chocolate and roasted malts. Body is thin and real overcarbonated, especially for a porter. A bad porter all around, no craftsmanship at all!","barleywinefiend","Feb 24, 2008"
2.47,-23.3,3.5,4,2,2,1.5,"Sadly, the aroma is where this ride ends. The flavor is an unbalanced, chalky, overly-carbonated blend of semi-acrid coffee and caramel with a hint of heavy metals (the ionic variety, not music) and wet newspaper. Mouthfeel isn't much better: too fizzy with a light body, and leaves an unpleasant aftertaste that's too metallic to be bitter. This is my first drain pour in quite some time. My stomach feels weird after a third of this one.","wagenvolks","Feb 17, 2008"

2.79,-13.4,4,2.5,2.5,3.5,3,"Better than the others, but eh...the same cheap impression I got from the others is still here in the hazelnut-chocolate aroma and flavor. Lacks convincing roasted malts, which are essential here...could be a great combo with the hazelnut.","blackie","Dec 30, 2007"

3.45,7.1,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"Flavors of dark fruit and milk chocolate. The backbone is a tad weak and seltzery. A bitter coffee snap awaits on the finish.
