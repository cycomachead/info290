The second time I had it I got it on tap at a bar and it was even better.  Smooth and chocolatey with a roasted coffee aroma, it was nearly too beautiful to drink.  As the beer warmed up the flavours became even more pronounced.  This beer is beyond a score of 84, I'm not exactly a 'beer expert' but I know that everyone I know who has had this porter has raved about it.  Go out and give it a try.","Grant_Satterthwaite","Mar 26, 2015"

Very weak nose of roast and chocolate over a mineral note.  Nice medium body with a touch of creamy texture.  Below normal carbonation with minimal effervescence on the finish.  The flavor profile is outstanding - intense, balanced and complex. It begins with bitter dark chocolate that flows into a blend of light roast and coffee.  The middle is moderate hop bitterness over a light sweetness with nut and grain characteristics.  The finish is somewhat clean with a slightly astringent note.","tillmac62","Oct 30, 2014"

Might be better with a light meal, and definitely one that can be consumed in high volume. Alcohol is certainly present. If you're looking for a full bodied, knock-your-socks-off, dark flavor, I wouldn't recommend. I would bring to a party, but it didn't satisfy my craving.","califunflyindog","Apr 28, 2014"

A worthy effort, but it doesn't match the best porters I've tried - increased fruitiness in the flavour/aroma might improve it. There is the possibility that it has faded over time, although it doesn't seem off. Worth sampling, but no need to hunt it down.","jazzyjeff13","May 02, 2013"

3.8,2.2,4,3.25,4,4.25,3.75,"Left Hand Milk Stout is ubiquitous now. Everywhere you look, it's on nitro tap, and the Nitro bottles bring the experience home. Black Jack Porter doesn't get that kind of attention at all. It's the black sheep of the Left Hand lineup. Black Jack Porter pours a red-tinged deep brown with a couple fingers of head. The aroma is coffee and roast forward, a little on the burnt side, and there's something sweet here that doesn't quire meld. The taste is actually rather similar to their Milk Stout, just take out the lactose and push the coffee to the forefront instead of the chocolate. It's been a while since I've had a non-nitro Milk Stout, but I remember the normal variant having a similar mouthfeel - creamy and lightly carbonated. The drinkability is solid. Overall, Black Jack Porter was a good drink, but I'll take the Nitro Milk Stout over it every day.","shand","Apr 14, 2013"

4,7.5,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 2/12/2012. Pours fairly crystal clear dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent lacing on the glass. Aromas of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, biscuit, nuttiness, light coffee, slight fruitiness, and herbal hops. Very pleasant and balanced aromas with decent strength. Taste of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, biscuit, toast, toffee, nuttiness, slight coffee, light fruitiness, and light herbal spiciness. Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, caramel, biscuit, toast, and roasted malt on the finish for a good bit. Great balance of flavors, and a nice malt backbone; with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Very easy to drink with no alcohol presence other that a slight warming after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice porter. A good amount of robustness, with great flavor balance; and very enjoyable. Really well done.","superspak","May 20, 2012"

The beer is rich coffee color, held up to the light the coffee brown shows through. Pretty decent sticky lacing. Slightly alcoholic smell to this, with a hint of bitter chocolate. This beer tastes of bitter chocolate and deep roasted malts. It doesn't have that burnt charcoal profile, and that's a good thing in my eyes. Mouthfeel is a bit watered down. This is a nice porter, pretty drinkable, but I gotta admit it's a bit strong for my liking. At 6.4%, the alcohol really comes through, but overall this isn't a bad effort from Left Hand, but there are better porters out there.","JuicesFlowing","Oct 23, 2011"

3.72,0,3,3.5,4,3,4,"Overall I thought this was a good English Porter. I don't have a lot of experience with this style but I am starting to like the lightness and complexity of this style as apposed to some of the more robust American Porters that border on being a stout. This beer was pretty damn drinkable, it went down pretty fast and if I had another one I would drink it, I could see drinking 3 or 4 of these on a cool fall night. What I liked most about this beer was the flavor, it wasn't overly robust and it turned out to be pretty complex. What I liked least about this beer was the mouthfeel, the carbonation needed to be bumped up a couple notches and it wouldn't hurt to make it a little thicker for a medium body. I could see myself buying this again when looking for a nice and easy drinking English Porter. I would recommend giving this beer a try it has just the right amount of balance and complexity to do this style justice. I still think Arcadia's London Porter is my favorite English Porter, but this beer comes pretty close to it although still being pretty different, but I have yet to have a traditional English Porter from England so I really can''t tell which one is more tradition, but I am willing to bet that Black Jack is closer to a traditional English Porter. I am glad that Left Hand is now available in Michigan, so far I have only tried their darker beers so I am interested to see what they can do with some of the lighter styles, guess I am going to have to track some down next time I am at the store.","StoutHunter","Oct 18, 2011"

There were notes of coffee and milk chocolate, but there was a sweetness at the finish that I was not expecting. There was a sugary taste that I noticed on my palate that I really only find in milk/sweet stouts. Interesting. Mouthfeel was adequate, but on the thin side for a porter.

3.17,-14.8,3.5,4,3,3,2.5,"Poured this into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. This beer looked like it was going to be great during the pour, but got closer to pretty average the more time went on. At first it had a huge creamy head on it that looked like it was going to have decent lacing to it but it went away fairly quickly and just left a little bit of lace at the top of the class. Its a hearty mahogany color that has lighter brown highlights to it. Only after it's been out of the fridge for Id say atleast 45 minutes does the smell start to get better than average and even work it's way to good. Initially you can't pick up a whole lot, just sort of a dry pine hop. But as it warms up you can also pick up that it smells well malted with aromas of cocoa and even a feint hint of coffee. Once it warms up it actually smells pretty well blended. The taste is a slight step down. Has the initial taste of the roasted malts chocolate and coffee but it doesn't blend well with the hops at all. On top of that the coffee taste to it is similar to coffee that's been on the burner a little too long. Mouthfeel is ok, I would have to say pretty average for this style and that's probably being a bit generous, complex and finishes with I would say an awkward bitterness. Due to all of the flavors not meshing well together, it's not very drinkable overall. I was a little dissapointed. Only the 2nd beer I've had from this brewery and the first I've reviewed. I've had the milk stout several times and really enjoyed it, I'm hoping maybe I just a bad bottle, but no indications on it seems that it was out of code.

Perhaps my nose isnt train for this very smell since im new to the porter scene..? The taste is nice and has a bit of sweetness in the end.

3.27,-12.1,3.5,4,3,3,3,"Appears a dark mahogany with ruby highlights it's hard to call this porter black especially when held toward the light. It forms a creamy light khaki colored head that dwindles typically with non descript even fine lacing. Aromatics offer up a touch of black licorice aka anise, with a roasted malt character bringing out some dark chocolate and mild coffee accent notes. Herbal hops in the back ground, a bit of caramel complements the party as well. Flavor brings out the dominant caramel presence with a touch of roasted malt characteristics including the mild coffee and dark chocolate, again a mild herbal hop bitterness in the finish for some balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied evenly carbonated, there is a harsh bitterness that is left on the palate giving me an aftertaste that I don't truly care for between sips. Drinkability overall is decent not my favorite dark that's would have to be their milk stout, but this will do for now average dark brown/porter style ale.","WVbeergeek","Dec 21, 2009"

Only AFTER drinking the final beer, the Black Flag Imperial Stout with its surge of hoppiness, and returning, did it seem like a porter, with touches of maple syrup. Before that, it was just a bland brown ale. If I had to summarize in one word, "nondescript" would be my linguistic choice.","darkmaven","Dec 11, 2009"

Medium-bodied, while it doesn't have a lot of weight it still manages to feel sluggish and unwilling to move. Coffee notes perk it up some but then it's basically the same story as in the nose, chocolate, caramel, butterscotch and plum, raisin, other dark fruits. The carbonation much more fluffy and active than you'd guess from the absence of any head. Light breadiness with some bitters, here it tastes like fizzy mineral water rather than still stream water.

There is almost a sweet fruit edge to it. I want to say there are very slight cherry hints, but that still might be over-exaggerating. Feel is very smooth. Goes right down. On the end of the liquid feel it seems to get a slight bit watery. I still say it is good though. Very drinkable.

This one poured a nice thick dark brown with a large creamy tan colored head on the top. Great retention let it hang around for what seemed like forever before finally being nestled down into just a thin layer across the top. The aroma was very full and sweet. Lots of chocolate roaming through it along with a touch of coffee and lots of sugar. A slight smoked presentation as well. The flavor was also very full for a porter. This almost had a stout like feel to it as it was very thick and full with a great robust profile. Lots of chocolate and coffee notes dominated it. Overall it was hard to believe this was actually not a stout. It was so full bodied, a really great porter. This would make an excellent addition to a winter lineup.

The taste has toffee and licorice overtones that blend well and achieve a slightly bitter balance. The mouthfeel is smooth and, overall, the Black Jack is a tasty beer.

Roasted nuttiness hits first in the taste and sweetness thats close to molasses but not that sharp comes in after. Also seems light a bit of butterscotch, but that may be how Im tasting the sweetness. If theres any coffee in the taste it comes through more in the not unpleasant resin-oiliness of the finish. Mouthfeel was medium with light apparent carbonation (so I can see why some would call it thin). For me, though, the mouthfeel struck a great balance. Not too drying or too sweet in the end.

The steely maltiness melds into the chocolate malt and again the hops, this time in the form of a slight bitterness, accents the overall taste. There is also more of a hop character to this porter due to the Magnum and U.S. Goldings used, making it more balanced and less malty. Not as roasty as alot of Porters, but is more true to the Engish Porter style with a complex balance of young and old flavours. Very complex with differnet flavours in every sip as the beer warms. Mouthfeel also fits the beer itself and style well. Drinkability is good as well.","Beeryce","Jan 31, 2007"

Had about 2 fingers of brownish foam that evaporated to a thin head and lacing during the drink. The smell was really off on this one for what I expected. Not sure if something happened during shipment but it a really strange aroma that I couldn't identify. Even had the wife who is good at picking out smells try it and she said "ugh - that's awful". In the background, I could smell the coffee and chocolate malts but overpowered by the other. I'll rate a 3 as a mix of what I got (1) and what others have said (4). The mouthfeel was pretty good but a little on the watery side. The taste was excellent. A year ago, I wouldn't drink a porter if offered but I've really developed a taste for them lately.

4.08,9.7,4,3.5,4.5,4,4,"The color is a dark nutty brown with an average-sized, off white head. The aroma is of sweet, dark malts with just a touch of roast. The overall taste is a little sweeter and not quite as rich as most porters I've tried; I think that is why I'm enjoying this beer so damn much. The primary malt flavor is still of dark malts with an ample chocolate flavor, but sweeter than expected with perhaps a mild caramel malt taste. Roast flavors come into play towards the middle of a sip and help carry an extra long sweet finish. Black Jack's long-lasting finish has to be the highlight here, the flavor from a sip seems to last forever. This is now one of my favorite porters, the sweet complexity leaves me craving more.

This is a really nice malty porter, there is not much in the way of hop notes, just a mix of sweet and dark malt notes.

Smell is a bit odd. Nice and malty though, but there's a kind of disagreeable soy sauce taste. I just recently had a Sam Adams Triple Bock, which I thought was terrible, and ultra soy saucy, so maybe I'm sensitive to that smell. Let's see how it tastes. Ehhh... it's ok. Not as rich as I was expecting. Malty, of course, roasty, and a bit of coffee taste, though that odd soy sauce is there. I don't know what that is... anyone?? Very strange, and not in a good way.

3.45,-7.3,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"pours a slightly above average medium to dark brown colour with pretty much no head. it looks almost like a flat (though slightly thicker) coke. not bad, but not great. the aroma is mostly caramel and malt with some wood notes. again, slightly above average, at best. upon first taste, you get virtually no flavour. weird. then the burnt malt kicks in along with som semi-sweet chocolate flavour and some wood/cardboard. overall, this one was a bit too thin and carbonated for my liking when it comes to porters. it seemed like it was doing a balancing act between brown ale and porter at times, and i much prefer my porters to be closer to the stout end of the spectrum. it isn't a bad brew, it's simply underwhelming. i'd give it a marginal thumbs up, but with much room for improvement.","SixpointJMH","Aug 31, 2004"

3.41,-8.3,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours with a two-finger tan head that fades quickly to just a thin layer leaving a little lace. Deep red/amber color nearly opaque. Light carbonation, medium bodied. Nose has a hint of chocolate. Starts with a roasted sweetness and finishes smooth with no bitter aftertaste. A good porter; nice to find a 12oz bottle on sale for $1 from Liquor Barn, Lexington, KY. Their site lists the ABV at 5.8%.","jdhilt","Aug 27, 2004"

The mouthfeel is horrible. It is a medium/full bodied beer with little carbonation. This beer drinks average. It has little aroma and flavor along with almost no carbonation.

3.58,-3.8,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"Poured into an imperial pint, formed a small 1/2" beige head over the dark reddish brown brew. Good lacing, and this offering has a light aroma of hearty malts. Taste is sweetly of the dark grains, a combination of what seems to be coffee, chocolate, and maybe rauch. The mouthfeel is excellently smooth, even if a bit too sweet. A bit heavy for major drinkability, but certainly would have another...","ppoitras","May 13, 2004"

Probably a good choice on a warm day. Overall a decent offering.","edchicma","Mar 12, 2004"

3.8,2.2,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Pours a dark brown/copper color with decent head that fades quickly. Smells of roasted malts, raisins, and a hint of licorice. The taste is a nice blend of chocolate and a fruity raisin flavor followed up by a smooth licorice taste that complements the beer quite well. Clean crisp taste and a little weaker than most heavier porters out there. Still a smooth beer and very drinkable.","stewart124","Jan 29, 2004"

3.65,-1.9,3.5,3.5,4,3,3.5,"A good porter that has a decent appearance, light nose and good taste. The body is a deep reddish brown and pulls up a reasonable cream-colored head and leaves minimal lace effect. The nose is smoky and also a bit sweet smelling. The flavor is a chocolate and carmel delight that takes the smoky nose and buries it in sweetness and good maltiness. The body is too flat, however, and lets down on supporting the fullness of the flavor. Still, drinkability is enhanced by the good flavor and only slightly elevated ABV.","AtLagerHeads","Sep 16, 2003"

3.69,-0.8,3,4,3.5,3.5,4,"22 oz. bottle with what I think is a very cool bottle cap featuring a red left hand on a white background. Pours a dark brown to black with a one finger thick off-white (almost yellowish) head. The head diminishes rather quickly leaving an unimpressive looking beer---it does look purplish when held up to light which is a cool feature. Smells very pleasant, with aromas of coffee, roasted malt, and some chocolate. A fairly nice taste is also present, although a bit mild--dominant flavors are that of malt and a bit of chocolate. A very smooth beer (although feels a bit thin in the mouth) which I found to be easy drinking. While I wouldn't seek this beer out, I'd certainly try it again if the opportunity came up.","tar","Aug 28, 2003"
3.78,1.6,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Pours a dark, reddish brown. Thin, sudsy, and relatively stable head. Smell is of roasted grains and american hops, but I'd call it lacking and muted for a good porter. Taste is malty-sweet with bitter chocolate. It's a little on the sweet side of things, but has a creamy, full-bodied texture. At times, it seems a little acidic....don't know where to place that sensation. All in all, it's a decent, enjoyable beer, but not outstanding.","Suds","Jul 27, 2003"
3.67,-1.3,4,4.5,4,2.5,2.5,"12 oz bottle served at the Food Shack in J-Town, FL. Murky deep brown color. Hints of purple-ruby edges depending on the light. Smooth, silky, rich smell of roasted coffee and sweet chocolate. Same tastes follows. Nice hop snap follows. Both bitter and sweet chocolate tastes are present. This beer then takes a turn, the flavors are full and rich, but a slick chalkiness lingers, then the body turns watery. I gave it lower grades for mouthfeel and drinkability for this reason. I am still glad to see it Florida and would buy it again.","StevieW","Jul 16, 2003"

3.95,6.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Color is a dark caramel brown, fizzed out foamy head leaving barely any lacing. Smell is of sweet malt and tangy, slightly roasty and soft. Taste is more of the same, lightly robust of drying dark roasted malt with a light presence of hop bitterness. Light and airy, earthy dry bitterness throughout the finish. Feel is a bit thin for a porter, could have some heavier boldness. Its a drinkable porter for sure but I was a little put off by its lightness.","tavernjef","May 11, 2003"
3.95,6.2,4,4,4,3.5,4,"As it warms, the dry chocolaty aroma grows, as does the earthy, slightly metallic subflavor. Inexplicably, the balancing, subtle hoppy bitterness grows right along with the maltiness. Finally, a late flavor of slightly green coffee, or possibly moist coffee grounds rounds out an enjoyable bomber of beer. This one was nice and fresh, malty, subtle and well balanced: a well made-detail oriented effort.","TXHops","Apr 03, 2003"
3.8,2.2,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Dark coppery-brown body, initially a big 3-finger head. Head retention good, some residual lace on surface and glass. Pretty straight forward malty, chocolatey aroma. Very chocolatey, slightly bitter flavor with notes of roasted grains. Flavor is very good, but perhaps a bit thin. A bit light bodied for a baltic porter, but smooth and rather creamy.
