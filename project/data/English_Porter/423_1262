The taste is pretty much the same with more chocolate coming through that leaves a bitter finish because of it. Perfect carbonation that isn't over done.

Pours smooth with just the right amount of head. Smells amazing with the usual porter characteristics including a very subtle hop scent that translates well into the flavor profile as well.

Has a big cappuccino colored head that lingers on and also leaves lacing. Aroma is mostly alcohol sweetness. The taste has more complexity, with some nice roasted malt flavor, a little coffee and a hint of bitterness on the finish. Has a little bit of carbonation but is mostly smooth and has a nice mouthfeel. An above average porter. Not mind-blowing, but solid.","delta490","Apr 10, 2013"

Mainly roasted grain on the nose; burnt coffee is a good description coming through as well. Lacing really hanging on 2/3 of the way through, and mouthfeel eases off as well as beer warms. Pronounced bitterness, especially in the aftertaste. Little to no hop aroma, little to no sweetness.

The head retention is nice. Lots of lacing, not as sticky as other beers, but definitely present. This beer smells like it should: bitter chocolates, roasted malts, and even a sweet raisin and citrus hop presence in there somewhere. A nice tasting porter with the bitter chocolate dominating. Again, there is a finish of tangy hops in there, but the malty bitter chocolate is dominant. The mouthfeel is a bit watery, and too carbonated. Overall, this beer was better than I expected. It is too carbonated like some Boulevard beers tend to be, but the appearance, taste, and aroma are all worthy. It has it's flaws, but I like this porter.","JuicesFlowing","Oct 29, 2011"

The nose comprises molasses, maple syrup, light roasted malts, light cocoa powder, a tinge of coffee, and a dusting of florals. The taste accentuates the bitterness of these elements, particularly the cocoa, the coffee, and the roasted malts. A strong sense of balsa trickles throughout. The body is a light-ish medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat thin feel.

Rich dark chocolate and roasted coffees are the first things that I am picking up in the Aroma. Really nicely done with hints of caramel and smoked malts, there is almost a peat like smell to it at times, especially as it warmed up. Equally well done as it transfers over to the flavor. Smooth, mellow, creamy, this was a very session able porter.

The appearance as stated is a large slightly ecru head...the color is a rich dark opaque color. The nose is not what i was hoping....again could be an effect of too much carbonation. I do smell some earthy tones however. A good strong roastiness finishes on the buds after the swallow. the start is crisp and light but as the finish comes a coffee like / roasty acidic (how i describe a regular coffee taste) taste finishes the beer.

Malty sweetness strikes out at first taste, followed by the dominating flavors of coffee and chocolate.

Bully! has a roasted smell, a sort of coffee characteristic. Taking a sip of this I wonder how it would taste with BBQ, probably awesome. If not the BBQ would be awesome. If you're in KC. The roasted scent of the beer is present in the flavor, roasted malts and a little hops, the coffee flavor is there as well. The mouthfeel I felt was lacking, sadly. Bully! drank a little watery, not flavor wise but more so it wasn't as thick as I'd like it to be. Because of this it becomes very drinkable for a porter, but what I like about porters is the thickness of them.

The taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like roasted/burnt malt, chocolate, coffee and smoke. There's also a lingering earthy hop finish.

3.95,4.5,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Thanks to bort11 for the opportunity to try this one. 12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Best by 11/23/08 indicated on the bottle. Poured the color of cola with a two inch tan-colored head. Consistency of cap was foamy, with underside comprised of tiny effervescing bubbles that also adhered to the sides of the glass. Great head retention and sticky strands of lacing appeared at the head receded. Nose was roasted coffee off the bottle pop, followed by malt and a kiss of hops; aromas were much more subdued in the glass. Taste follows nose, with hops bittering much more pronounced in the mouth and lightly lingering at the finish. Mouthfeel was a little lighter than anticipated for the style, but not far off, and slightly overcarbonated. Good drinkability, but less carbonation definitely would have enhanced mouthfeel and drinkability in my opinion.","Jwale73","Oct 05, 2008"

Taste is similar, nice vanilla and roast beginning, caramel, chocolate, a bit of fruitiness, coffee, brown sugar, very balanced finish.

The taste isn't a let down either. Beginning with a nice strong coffee flavor, then turning to a smooth roasted malt taste, and ending with a hint of chocolate. Very smooth and full flavor. Good medium thickness in the mouthfeel. Overall, this was a highly enjoyable porter. Great flavor and good alcohol level make for a great session ale. I could easily drink this all night.

As it recedes after some time, it leaves huge, chunky lace on the glass. Nose is big on soft, fresh fruits undercut with a does of milk chocolate. Shy roast character lurks around in there as well as a vague hop aroma. The typical Boulevard fruity esters hold a big presence in the flavor as well while the roasted malt comes out in full force, giving dark chocolate and medium-high roast coffee flavors.

Chocolate, caramel, toffee, and a hint of coffee come through. Mouthfeel is close to medium and maybe a little on the light side.

Highly recommended.","pentathlete","Jun 20, 2005"

It had a great sweet maltiness on the nose, with sort of a chocolate smell to it. The color was a deep, dark brown. My first thought after tasting it was, "Man, THIS is porter!" Roasty, nutty, chocolaty - all of these flavors are evident in the mouth. The mouthfeel is fairly full and rich.

The taste is mainly of sweet caramel and even a slight fruitiness. On the swallow, a slight smoke flavor comes through and finally a bitter unsweetened chocolate (bakers choco.) right on the finish.

With searching, I get perhaps a hint of vanilla and currant. Wet sweet to start and then a delay before the chocolate jumps in followed quickly by roasted grains. I get a cherry like sour before a shot carbonation on my tongue and then a dry and roast grain finish. Now for the fruits...yeah, I get some but can't put my finger on any particular one. Tastes (and looks) like more of a stout than a porter, but the medium-light mouthfeel is in style with a porter. Sloshing around in my mouth it's medium bodied, but it goes down the throat very thin.

I find the mouthfeel medium, nice small carbonation. Tastewise, nothing has suffered too much...the beer is almost really really good, but the finish is just a bit jaring. Initial taste is rich, roasty, maybe more java than cocoa like. Interesting slightly smokey note before the finish kicks in. The finish is just not as smooth as the initial taste, or else I would have rated this higher. The finish just seems slightly rocky. Would I get/drink this again? Heck yes!

The aroma was kind of faint, but pleasant, having some hints of roastiness along with a faint earthiness or mustiness. The taste was a blend of chocolate, licorice, espresso, and sweet malt along with a faint bitterness - the beer overall was rather bittersweet and reminesent of baker's chocolate.

The color was a medium beige light mild chocolate color. Some lace was created but in patches. The aromas that came from the glass were of sweet malt, some roasted malt, fresh hops, burnt coffee (no cream) and milk chocolate. Not the strongest aromas that I have had from a porter when first served, but when it rose a few degrees the nose really improved. The flavors were of coffee, fresh hops, chicory, burnt chocolate, bitter chocolate, hints of fruit emerged, a light nut and some grain (barley). The after taste was of burnt coffee and hops. The body was light medium to medium. I would have liked to have more feel in a beer like this personally and was surprised at the body on this one. A very enjoyable beer good all the way around once the temperature rose a few from the refrigeration. Only complaint would be more body. But all and all a good example of its style.","Jarod","Aug 29, 2003"
4.13,9.3,4.5,4,4,4,4.5,"Taste is a bit more complex then the smell with a hefty almost chewy amount of roasted malts, giving it a over baked, slightly burnt cookie sense with mild milk chocolate and a slight coffee flavor appearing late and the drying sense from the coffee and chocolate showing up even later, quite a nice finish. Overall, very smooth and easy with a light milding amount of bittering hops and just the right amount of taste and flavors to make you take notice. Feel is medium bodied, starts a little weak but picks up nicely and finishes with a genuine porter quality 'late' finish that I like. Its not as sweet or as bold as some porters, but its respectable. Very drinkable as well. Reasonably solid porter.","tavernjef","Aug 21, 2003"
4.27,13,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,4,"*Edit Had this aging in my "Cellar" for six months. Delicious. Made slight adjustment to show. I love this Porter, though it was still a little thin, the aging took some of the bite out of it. Smooth...","Nytemare","Aug 11, 2003"
4.23,11.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Tasting reveals a bold chocolate and peat experience. The combinations of malts provide a somewhat unique porter experience with enough body for another beer. A very dry aftertaste and somewhat roasted flavor illicit a call for more. Very nice porter, one of the better samples of the style.","freed","Jul 28, 2003"
3.63,-4,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Very dark brown, slight light transmission at the bottom of the glass. Bright ochre-colored 1/2 inch head that's pillowy and retains extremely well. Nice lace as well. Slightly oily mink oil aroma, similar to a Sierra Nevada Stout. Lighter bodied than the color suggests, slighlty malty, light coffee, and more than average carbonation. Respectably hopped, but less peppery than a Summit Great Northern. All in all, not a bad entry, more gutsy than many sweet examples, but lacking in body and that one outstanding note or quality that makes me loyal to some beers. Somewhat dissappointing, its a very attractive brew that holds onto its head like grim death -- all the way down the pint glass.","ADR","Jul 16, 2003"
3.75,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Orginally sampled on 3 December 2002. This is a very nice porter. It has almost a chocolate like smell w/ lots of roasty characteristics. Thoroughly enjoyable. It should be no surprise to anyone that the color of this porter is dark brown/blackish. Were you expecting something fizzy yellow?","jcalabre","Jun 13, 2003"

3.98,5.3,4.5,4,4,3.5,4,"12 oz bottle. Great label with the monocle using bulldog inspecting a pint of porter. Shiny black color, with a full bubbly, rocking, khaki color. Moderate smells of roasted coffee, burnt toast, and just the right cocoa smoothness. Taste is right on for the style. Nice bitter chocolate roastedness. Bitterness is sharp at the finish, and lingers somewhat. Maybe a touch thin for a porter, and highly charged carbonation. The flavors more than make up for it, very enjoyable porter.","StevieW","May 07, 2003"

4.38,15.9,5,4.5,4.5,4,4,"I've had this beer oh so many times before, but had never sat down to one with the intention of reviewing it and picking it apart. I have always enjoyed it, but now I appreciate it even more. This is probably the best brew of all the Boulevard beers that I have had.","Quaffer","Feb 24, 2003"
4.23,11.9,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured a very dark brown with a ruby hue around the edges. A very foamy cream colored head that lasts and lasts. To say it had good lacing is an understatement, the sheets of foam completely covered the walls of the glass. I love it when there is still some yeast at the bottom of the glass. Roasted malts dominates the smell with a hints of chocolate and some alcohol aroma. Taste is mostly of roasted malts up front with a lite bittery finish that balances this brew perfectly. The last few gulps are the best with the yeast collected at the bottom. Will definately purchase again.","Bruiser81","Feb 02, 2003"
4.5,19,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"A very tasty and drinkable Porter, this is a fairly filling beer for me so I often end the evening with a bottle. It's not a 'light guzzle anytime' beer by any means.","texascarl","Jan 15, 2003"

4.08,7.9,4.5,4,4,3.5,4.5,"Poured a dark brown, off-white head. Initial sip was very mild, mouthfeel is decent though the carbonation was a little bit too much. Tasted like a mild blend of maltiness with chocolate and coffee flavors. Very good beer for relaxing with a couple, doesn't take long to get to the great tasting bottom of the glass. Very good porter for a novice like me to get into the darker beers on the market.","alittlehazy","Dec 11, 2002"
4.15,9.8,4,4,4.5,3.5,4,"The color is deep brown to black and the head is voluminous and frothy in its textures, as it dissipates, it leaves a trail of fine lace to cover the glass. Nose that of roasted barley that is slightly spicy with malt and hints of semi-sweet chocolate, the first sip is sweet, the top is middling in feel, and the finish is perkily hopped the carbonation moderate. One of the better "Porters" I tasted recently, and a pleasure for a "Lover of the dark side"","Gusler","Dec 11, 2002"
3.75,-0.8,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"12 oz bottle, dark brown-black color, nice creamy head. Roasted coffee aroma, light chocolate and coffee flavor. Medium body, nice creamy mouthfeel, a little thin, a good tasting porter, but not as strong as I like.","maxpower","Dec 04, 2002"
4.3,13.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Bully! Porter is one of the best Porters I have had the pleasure of drinking and, frankly, this beer merits more reviews! This is Boulevards best brew; I recommend it.","bditty187","Nov 06, 2002"
3.2,-15.3,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3.5,"This brew presents with a deep brown color but absolutely no head retention.  The aroma is predominantly of roasted malt with just a brush of chocolate.  The body is decent, but the carbonation is a bit high.  The hop profile is also quite aggressive.","beernut7","Aug 31, 2002"

4,5.8,4,4,4,4,4,"Nice, very deep brown/black color and solid tan head that leaves some good Belgian-lace about the glass. The aroma is limited, but that's OK for porter. Creamy mouthfeel. The flavor is rich with malt and intense roasted barley. There's a flash of sharp hop flavor in the middle (Cascades?), but it's covered over by the roastiness before the swallow is through. The finish is dry and roasty, revealing a little bit more of the hops; seemingly lasting forever. Very nice indeed!","NeroFiddled","Jul 26, 2002"
4.18,10.6,5,4.5,4,4,4,"A nice, big creamy brown head tops this opaque brew.  It has great retention too, forming craters as it ever so slowly fades. The aroma is of chocolate, java and West Coast style hops.  The taste is similar, however burnt malt and anise also seem to make fleeting appearances in addtion to the bitter hops and chocolate malt.  This is a nice tasting porter.  The body is just a little too think.  About medium to medium-full.  The bitterness and hop qualities here really appeal to me.  Similar to SN.  Solid porter.","Bighuge","Jul 23, 2002"
4.65,23,5,5,4.5,4.5,4.5," Not nearly as sweet as I would have expected a porter to be, none the less, I am impressed! and you will be too!","BeerBob","Jun 25, 2002"
3.92,3.7,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"The tan head dissipates quickly.  Deep garnet color with a bit of haze when held to light.  It's a porter!  Haze is not an issue.  The sweet and toffee like dark crystal malt hit the nose at first, and are ensued by a mild chocolate malt and burnt black patent aroma. The hop nose is all Willamette (a seedless American grown Fuggle) and is quite similar to that of Sierra Nevada Porter.  Although crystal malt sweetness is fairly high, black patent bitterness along with ample hop bitterness provide balance.  The finish is very dry compared to other microbrewed porters, and a clean combination of roasted grain and hop bitterness lingers.  It's a flavorful porter for sure, but I would've personally appreciated more body.","marc77","Apr 09, 2002"
