"The nose is quite remarkable albeit it inappropriate at times. Chocolate syrup, molasses, maple, dry barley, plums and soy sauce. The flavor has a very dry chocolate malt, burnt coffee, charred embers, barley grain and a strange sweetness I can't identify. Not bad for the price but not great as well."

"Bottle: Poured a clear dark color porter with a medium size light brown foamy head with OK retention and some light lacing. Aroma of light chocolate and roasted malt notes is enjoyable. Taste is a mix of chocolate malt with some roasted malt notes with some light dry finish. Body is light with good carbonation. A bit short on complexity but well drinkable."

"Deep, chocolate brown color with average head and decent lacing. Aroma is light, with malt sweetness being the dominant smell. Taste surprised me a bit, was expecting a little bolder flavor, but got a little less. Ok taste with malt being the highlight, and some roastiness also. Seems to be little weak for a porter. Mouthfeel was good, nice carbonation and such. A little weak and watery for a good strong porter."
"Cola brown body, 2 finger head (bubbly), average retention with good hanging lacing. Roasted aroma; flavor has a fruit profile to it mixed with coffee which makes it awkard to my taste. Bit of a coal like feel and the body is thin. Overall a less than middle of the road porter."

"It doesn't meet my idea of what a good Porter should be."

"I suppose this might work as a porter for people who don’t like porters, yet it’s too bitter for the Newcastle crowd (not sayin’ much, just sayin’). I’m at a loss as to what sort of beer drinker this is meant for."
""

"You know, it's easy to lose sight of a good porter when you're primarily chasing the biggest, hoppiest beers around. I would recommend this."

"Well for a buck a bottle, all of the trader joe's beers have been just fine (tho some better than others). This isn't one of the better of the 15 different beers I got from trader joe's, but what the hey, I'm going to finish it, so that's not bad."

"The taste has a quick burst of sweet malts which are followed nearly immediately by a modest hop bite the ends on the dry side. Not an extraordinary Porter but one that I found to be drinkable."
"For a dollar a bottle, though, it might very well be the best beer in the world."

"O- Overall, this is a good beer. It's great when you're in the mood for a dark strong cup of black coffee with no sugar."

"Very smooth and delectable. Right balance of dark malt goodness with an oh-so subtle hop bitterness. Creamy. Touch of lactose sourness."
""
"A freind gave me this over the weekend here in the triad,I have been to Federal Jacks a few times.Pours a deep color with a half finger light beige head atop.Aromas are sweet with molasses and brown sugar notes,some roast underneath.Sweet on the palate with the molasses flavors being predominant,some dark roast and mild earthiness to cut off the sweetness just enough in the finish.Not bad but the sweetness and fizzy feel detracts from it."

"Bottom Line: As many others have reviewed, this is a very average Porter. This is not a bad beer by any means, however there are many other Porters that I would recommend over this one. If you do not have loyalties to a particular Porter then give Kennebunkport a try, you might like it."
""
"Smell is almost non-existent. Very drinkable porter with enough carbonation to tingle the whole tongue and and a bitterness that sustains the full depth of the swallow. The KBC porter mouth feel is easy to drink after day at work without an overwhelming alcohol content making a relaxing sensation that is very satisfying but not overwhelming. Overall, for the price purchased at Trader Joes make it a value for those who want a dark beer to relax to after a hard day at work. Although not a stellar porter is very easy to enjoy without the heavy alcohol content and sweetness that are found in others of this style."

"Poured into a Maudite snifter. Pours a very dark brown with reddish tones. Two finger light brown head with decent retention and pillowy lacing. Aroma of dark roasted malt, chocolate and a faint soapy element. Flavor of light toasted malt with light coffee and chocolate finishing with a subdued chocolate and toasted malt aftertaste. Light to medium bodied, thin for a porter. Thin and lightly flavored, pleasant but forgetable. Fulfills its mission as a cheap, drinkable porter."
""
"The Verdict: Average. There are much better porters out there, but there’s nothing to really complain about."

"Overall - Nice porter. It's a nice addition to the Trader Joe's line-up, and a hell of a deal for the $5.99 asking price."
""
""
"The body was a bit on the thin side of average for the style. Drinkability was good, the beer went down smoothly and easily, and it wouldn't be a chore to have a couple of these. Overall, a solid, decent brew, that at it's price, makes it a good value to stick in the fridge for when your in the mood for a nice, easy drinking Porter."

"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown-black with a 1/2 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. A nice latticework of lace forms around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, and some slight cocoa. Taste is of dark roasted malt, burnt coffee, and some metallic flavors. There is a mild roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is actually a pretty good porter and definitely the best of the 3 Kennebunkport beers I picked up recently."
"Overall: Man, the taste just ruined it for me. A pretty decent nose followed by a very disappointing taste. Kind of like getting to hook up with a cute girl and finding out she's got halitosis. Won't be buying this again."
"I've known this brewery to make better quality products so this may be from a bad batch. But with other great porters out there, I'm too afraid to try this again any time soon."

"Overall: A solidly good American porter. Went real well with cider porkchops and I could easily have another. If the carbonation was dropped just a tad it would be even better."
""

"Pours a dark brown with a short root beer head. Head retention is poor. Bouquet is milk chocolate liqueur with coffee notes. Mouthfeel is a little thin and adversely impacted by the carbonation. Pleasant chocolate, but not a lot else going on. Finishes with coffee acidity. Worth the money, but just an ok porter."
"(drink while listening to Beach House...any song)"
"A towering head of light cocoa hue with scads of lacing and great retention. Smell has a mild sourness with roasted notes like coffee and dark grains. Taste is much the same with coffee and roasted grains front and center. A mild English style fruitiness and earthy hops signature. A bit of sourness and light charcoal tinged burnt caramel sweetness. Finish is dry with lingering notes of burnt sugars and caramel, a long sourness and light biscuit. Feel is mildly carbonated and medium in weight. Quite easy drinking and a nice session ale. At $ 5.59 a six at Trader Joes this is a solid value."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This English style porter produced a brown color, a decent tan head with nice retention and lacing. The aroma of this porter consists of toasted malt, coffee and sweet brown sugar. Medium in body, this brew has a base of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. Overall, very average Porter, decent session beer- entry level porter. Prost!"

"12 oz bottle from Trader Joe’s. Pours brown with a thick, long lasting, tanned head. Nose is of toasted, bready malt and some hints of chocolate. Body is medium, creamy. Taste is toasted, nutty malt and some earthy hops. Finish is short, mainly of grapefruit, earthy hops and some espresso. Not overly complex, forgettable porter."
""
"I feared for worse. Kennebunkport gets a moral victory just for that."
"Note: Picked up at trader joes in the random bottle section."

"O - decent tasting and somewhat sessionable."
"(revised with BB 2014 bottle in Nov. 2013. Definitely not retired, label reads KBC Porter, and ABV = 5.6% -- different {and less enjoyable} beer?)"
"The mouth is fine with just the right amount of thickness. Glad I only got one of these, but would try again to see if it was my bottle was off."
"I think this is a pretty tasty beer, even if it doesn't fit most people's expectations. And for $1 a bottle, it's pretty tough to beat. One of the better of the Trader Joe's bargain beers I've had."
"Not a taste profile I enjoy."
"Strong aroma is smoky and slightly sweet, with licorice, molasses and horehound notes. It pours a dark, semi-transparent mahogany with a very thick, fine-bubbled, cream-tan head. Flavor has smoky, malty, molasses and caramel notes, not quite mouth-filling but still pleasing. Smooth texture has average body and minimal fizz."
"D - Not very good. Will not finish as I have better stuff on hand in the fridge for tonight."
"First thing I noticed is the carbonation. Very effervescent. Unfortunately, because it masks the flavors at first. Distracting. It’s almost a porter, just not quite there. Dial the carbonation back, keep the roast and chocolate flavor, get rid of the horrible finish and unwanted tartness. Sour, but not in a ‘good’ way—or in an ‘infected batch’ way, either. More like it’s just off-balanced and a poor brew. Perhaps oxidized? The flavor and the finish reminds me of all the bad qualities of two-buck Chuck. To say it improves slightly as it warms isn’t saying much. It’s off, and off-putting. I can’t say much good about this beer but it’s not horrible enough to trash outright. TJ’s has better beers available for the same price, and for a dollar or two more you can definitely do much better."
"Very dark, nearly opaque with just a hint of mahogany. A short tan cap formed during the pour, fair head retention, some lacing. Dry malt aroma, roasty with caramel sweetness, milk chocolate. Medium bodied with medium plus carbonation, dry but not really astringent, feels creamy but would be better with lower CO2. Moderate bitterness from the dark grains and hops, roasty with a bit of cocoa, slight cherry fruitiness, cola nut, faint grassiness. Not bad overall, tastes decent."
"Pours a very dark brown with a thumb of tan head with decent retention. Aromas of dark chocolate and maybe a bit of toffee, pretty straightforward. The flavors are good, initially tending toward sweet roastiness and finishing on a pleasantly bitter notes of coffee and cocoa nibs. Medium body seems appropriate for its level of flavor complexity. Overall enjoyable."
"Overall OK for the cheap beer that it is. $6 a six-pack at Trader Joe's is decent at that price."
"O: Wholesome toasted malt character. Seemed more active on the palate than many porters."
"Overall a straight forward and light bodied porter that's easy on the palate."
"T: Roasted malts and coffee upfront. Then the taste kind of just dies off. It's not bad and it's by far the best I've had from Kennebunkport, but it's pedestrian at best. The mouthfeel is really what kills it for me. It's way way thin."
"Taste is surprisingly pleasant with a nice doughy yeast that also throws off a few fruity esters. Roast is there but is balanced nicely by a rich sweetness and chocolate. Reminds me of an oatmeal stout without the viscous body. Has a nice mouthfeel, slick and smooth. I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would after seeing a few of the reviews and the overall score. Thanks Ken!"
"This is a porter in appearance but that's about it. It ""tastes dark"" but doesn't have the mouthfeel or richness to back it up. And the overall flavor profile is a little too sweet and lacking the malty and/or smokey features that many great porters have. Porter is the kind of style you need to be in the mood for, so this could be a disappointment if you're looking forward to a big, rich experience. I'll stick with Anchor Porter when I'm so inclined."
"This beer is super dark and completely opaque, but unfortunately produces a thin weak head. The smell is malty sweetness, with some hints of toastiness. The taste is dominated by bread and dark fruit, which doesn't come across as too sweet and finishes with a nice dryness. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy, but this beer lacks something to set it apart."
"Overall an average brew, nothing to get excited about."
"This beer probably would have gotten higher marks from me if it was called an amber. Definitely a miss for the style, but not a miss overall. It goes ok with food, it's affordable, just figure out another name for it. Or figure out how to brew it more consistently. After reading some reviews, they seem all over the map."
"Drinkability:An average porter, that really does not jump out of the box. It is not bad, but will not wow you either. i would have it again, but one was enough."
"In the end, this was just a decent beer. Well, the smell, taste, and mouthfeel were the only decent things about this beer. The appearance was the best thing about this beer. I guess I could say that it was almost like beer eye candy. The drinkability is above average because I don't remember paying all that much for this beer. I think it was either below a $1 or just slightly above that. If you can find this beer for a low price, go for it!"
"d: nothing horribly wrong, just a very bland porter."
"Dark, almost black with a slight head that fades quickly. Almost no lacing. Smells like roasted malts and vanilla. Tastes of coffee and vanilla, finishes with a coffee/tea like bitterness. Light bodied with smooth carbonation, easy drinking. Decent gateway porter."
"Overall this is quite an interesting porter that's alcohol forward with an interesting vanilla flavor. It's easy on the mouth and is highly drinkable."
"D - This is a pretty good porter. It surprised me with how good it tasted because the appearance and aroma were not spectacular."
"D: This is not a good brew and definitely one to skip."
"Drinkability: The low number of reviews on BA for this beer are interesting, because it seems fairly readily available. Despite the difficult pour, this was an enjoyable beer overall."
"D - Not good. Not terrible if you drink it cold."
"The taste is dry hints of chocolate and coffee grounds, burnt bark, and a bit watery, with a burnt bitter finish and aftertaste. As it warms, it becomes more mellow, but, despite some nice chocolate, ghosty caramel, and other flavours lurking underneath, it's overall too sharp, burnt-bitter and plain for me to really want to drink."
"d: i feel like for the style this is bizarre but has some interesting flavors; worth try but don't come with porter expectations"
"Overall: I give this one high marks for being unexpected. I'm not sure if I'd ever be up for having more than one at a time, but it's creatively great! Bravo."
"I understand why ol' TJ's chose this obscure brand (in the South anyway) as this is a quality beer. I find it interesting that most of the low ratings on this were from the brewpub on tap...whereas the TJ bottled version seemed to fare better."
"The taste is decent. Some coffee, some roasted malt that may be just a bit too acrid/charcoally, and a bit of chocolate to add sweetness. It's a thin mouth-feelin' beer, and the acrid aftertaste is offputting about halfway through, but all in all, it seems like the best these guys offer (which isn't saying much)."
"Poured a deep tannish brown with a thin cap of head and little to get excited about. A little bit of sweetness on the nose. Taste was a tad bit of chocolate and roasted malts. Body is thin and real overcarbonated, especially for a porter. A bad porter all around, no craftsmanship at all!"
"Sadly, the aroma is where this ride ends. The flavor is an unbalanced, chalky, overly-carbonated blend of semi-acrid coffee and caramel with a hint of heavy metals (the ionic variety, not music) and wet newspaper. Mouthfeel isn't much better: too fizzy with a light body, and leaves an unpleasant aftertaste that's too metallic to be bitter. This is my first drain pour in quite some time. My stomach feels weird after a third of this one."
"Far from my favorite porter--Stone Smoked Porter--but I'd buy it again."
"I can only think that actual powdered chocolate was used in this batch. If you don't like beer, maybe you'll like this one."
"Better than the others, but eh...the same cheap impression I got from the others is still here in the hazelnut-chocolate aroma and flavor. Lacks convincing roasted malts, which are essential here...could be a great combo with the hazelnut."
"I'm glad I bought a six pack of these."
"Medium bodied, fairly drinkable, but nothing impressive. But a decent deal for less than 6 bucks for a six-pack (though I wouldn't want to buy 6 of these)."
"Flavors of dark fruit and milk chocolate. The backbone is a tad weak and seltzery. A bitter coffee snap awaits on the finish. Major butter & cotton candy flavors are evident. It's that classic Pusley/Portland yeast flare. A fairly enjoyable beer overall and nicely priced at Trader Joe's."
"Like the annoad system: not much there."
