4.15,5.9,4.25,4.25,4,4.25,4.25," The taste is pretty great -dark malt with a variety of roasted and semi-sweet chocolate with some mild raisin-like yeast flavor combined with a slight spicy hop in the background which adds to the complexity with a toffee like dark sugar and mild fig-like flavor. The taste has a chocolate covered raisin effect with mild spice to keep things interesting -a mild dry finish and light alcohol makes it very drinkable. Overall I was really impressed, I have kind of found this style to be less impressive lately but this is an exception to the rule as it was satisfying and drinkable with pretty decent value as a bonus. I recommend this to anyone who likes this style.","Slatetank","Oct 07, 2013"

4.13,5.4,4.5,4,4.25,4,4,"The beer pours dark black in color, like a good black coffee. The beer pours with a half a finger’s width of small bubbles the color of sand dunes, which leaves a lacing of medium bubbles that leave a sticky, thin webbing on the glass. In body, the beer is too dark to look through. On the nose, the beer smells light and bakers chocolate with nice toffee notes and hints of coffee with cream and sugar. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet with a good drying bitter from the light roast, and a soft touch of fruity acidity in the finish. In flavor the beer begins as light dark fruit notes, dancing somewhere between plum and raisin, though never touching upon the richer raisin notes. This light fruitiness slowly blended with smooth roasted malts, smooth and a touch of metallic flavor. The finish rings with light roast and a touch of lactic sugar, while the aftertaste gives light hints to the ginger in the middle of the throat. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a soft carbonation that tickles the tongue with a light scrub. The beer feels slick and leaves a little coating of saliva as it exits the tongue, leaving the mouth wet yet roasty dry. Overall, this is a damn good English (Scottish?) Porter with some nice unique notes from the ginger that help to give fruitiness to the beer. Try this beer.","Maxwell","Jul 07, 2013"

Smells of muddled raisins, brown sugar and vague spicing from the hops and alcohol. Medium body. Dry toasted malt with hints of brown bread, touch of molasses and an even more faint charcoal and crystallized ginger flavor. Woody hops, kiss of ginger, nutty oats and a drying cocoa powder all in the dry finish. The small addition of ginger root works extremely well here.

Head retention and lacing are both pretty good. Aroma is roasted malt, chocolate, oats and a bit of coffee. The aroma is nice overall, and mostly sweet. The brew tastes like roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, and some ginger, along with a slight mineral taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has moderate carbonation.

Blackish-brown in color, opaque but not in a monolithic manner, light glimmer of burnt orange around the rims. Firm, well-packed nose of cocoa, dry dark chocolate, carob and a strong does of ginger, coriander spices, even a pinch of cayenne, the roast not acrid nor coffee-like, more like slowly roasted grains, has no distinct fruit nor citrus scents, long, if unobtrusive, presence in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, muscular presence, not immobile but you have to exercise those throat muscles to prod it down. The Indian cuisine like spices of ginger, cumin, anise and curry clear enough that they push most else to the side. This also hardens the contours of the cocoa, carob flavors. The carbonation moderate at best but does fit the general tone nicely. Odd that, again, virtually no fruit, citrus or other vaguely ""sweet"" flavors.

Wonderfully upfront with aromas of chocolate, coffee, malted milk, and a mellow ginger vibe, plus a nice mango/peach fruitiness, a wink of vanilla and just a hint of herbal hops. Tastes very reminiscent of root beer, no doubt from the combination of caramelized dark sugars, vanilla, herbal hops, and the light spice of ginger. The flavor segues from cherry cola into coffee, closing with a bitter finish of mocha and citric hops. Quite dry, although I fear the dryness comes at the expense of a fuller mouthfeel and richer malt character - but of course, this is a porter, not a stout, so the lighter body is not really inappropriate. Overall, this is delicious and interesting; the ginger is a welcome innovation, subtle yet noticeable enough to make this stand out among standard porters.","soulgrowl","Jun 02, 2009"

3.57,-8.9,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"D - Pretty good. In spite of the intense, bizarre, herbal flavors - it is still pretty good.","mrasskicktastic","Jan 04, 2009"

4.13,5.4,4.5,4,4.5,4,3.5,"Overall it is a great example of style I love and feel that I do not see enough of in the US or UK. Goes great with food, especially curry, and spicy stir fry! It is unique, delicious and very well crafted.","thepeter","Nov 02, 2008"
4.25,8.4,4.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"Other comments: This is an astounding porter! Even though it was a bit too cold when I sampled it, the complexity was fantastic. Really well balanced and scrumptious as hell! Need to get some more of this!","GreenCard","Oct 03, 2008"

4,2,4,4,4,4,4,"M&D: the texture is very soft in carbonation, med-plus bodied, very easy-drinking and quietly-delicious. I take this is the fuller version of Williams Black, with additional pleasure coming from ginger and herbal hops... At 5.6%abv., this quaffable porter certainly doesn't taste as such!","wl0307","Jun 11, 2008"
