3.52,-1.4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Sampled on tap at a Calgary pub early on New Year's eve. It is a tad unfortunate that Mill St. has succumbed to the flavored porter craze but OK, let's keep an open mind. I do like vanilla. This brew arrived in a Mill St. pint glass, a dark cola brown hue with the creamy light tan head you'd expect from a nitro-tap. A very light orange halo creeps along the bottom of the glass. Aroma is aggressive floral/sweet vanilla extract along with some roasted notes like dark coffee, a little white grape fruitiness which is somewhat unusual for this style ... One expects the fruit aromas to be darker. Palate featured some roasted barley and a chocolate brownie effect probably from the dark malts and the vanilla combined, butterscotch baking chips, blonde roast coffee, and a lot of vanilla extract, to the point where this was the dominant flavor throughout. I suppose that's the point, but I prefer spice additions to complement other flavors and stay under the radar a lot more than this one does. Still, its not too bad. Has a little of the sour character that you get in top-tier English porters and some subtle medicinal notes, perhaps this is how the hops make their presence known? Thinnish body and fairly aggressive carbonation but very creamy and smooth, again this could be the dispensing method used here. I wouldn't go out of my way to drink a lot of this brew, but all in all my pretty low expectations were exceeded. If they toned down the vanilla we'd have a solid porter on our hands.","CalgaryFMC","Dec 30, 2013"

Had there been more porter characteristics here, Mill Street Vanilla Porter would have been a first-rate brew. As it stands, it is still a good brew, and a tasty one to enjoy right before the holidays.","JohnnyBarman","Jan 31, 2010"
3.62,1.4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"On tap at Chancey Smith's. Deep coffee like pour with ruby hues at the edges of the glass. Has a frothy mocha cap. Nose of intense vanilla extract, roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate too, but the vanilla is powerful here. Tastes of sweet concentrated vanilla, some hoppy bitter roastiness, dark chocolate, a bit of mint. Wow, there is a lot of vanilla here. Finish is creamy, medium bodied, leaving a lengthy vanilla finish. Quite good, but one pint is enough thank you very much!","mrmanning","Jan 30, 2010"
3.87,8.4,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"A deliciously drinkable beer upfront but slowly it grows on you and near the end you find it hard to finish. I think they added too much vanilla here, if there was less of that and more of the porter this would be almost perfect.","GodOfBeer","Jan 17, 2010"
3.53,-1.1,3.5,3,4,3,3.5,"MSVP does not have the features of a traditional porter (smoke, hops, lots of roast, medium/full body) but it's still a very tasty dark beer. Worth a try IMO, even if doesn't adhere to the style.","cratez","Dec 12, 2009"

3.12,-12.6,2.5,3,3,3.5,3.5,"Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation, creamy and smooth. I have no idea who decided this was a porter. Zero porter character from the appearance down to the taste. Vanilla is alright but seems a little fake. Not too bad as a beer but as a porter this is shameful.","Viggo","0"
