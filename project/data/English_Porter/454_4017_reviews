"I finally got a chance to try this beer. It poured a nice dark brown/black colour. I found the taste to be somewhat sour and unpleasant and at first smell I was reminded of paint. Very strange. Overall I was very disappointed with this porter."

""
"Enjoy"

"O - I'm not quite sold on the balance of this beer. It has an interesting flavour but I don't think there's enough maltiness to stand up to the unusual sour and smoky flavours for a porter."

"Using smoked malt requires a delicate hand; too little and it goes unnoticed, too much and it can overwhelm both the beer and the drinker. But this recipe implements it in such a way that it supports the flavours of the other malts rather than hides them. Arcadia's London Porter is a true gem of porter that ranks very near the top of my list. Highly recommended."

"Not a bad example of a brown porter/London porter. I personally don’t care for the peat smokiness but otherwise not a bad beer."

"12 oz bottle. Pours black with small, fluffy beige head and a lot of bubbles. Aroma is of toasted malt, dark fruit and coffee and cream. Body is full and tangy. Taste is of toasted malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar, dark fruit and earthy hops. Finish is long and bitter. Very nice porter."

"Overall: I really enjoyed drinking this beer. It's got a deep, smokey, complex flavor that really opens up as it warms. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."
""
""
"O: Never had a British porter like this. For smoke beer enthusiasts."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- decent porter, good flavor, smooth drinking"
""
""
"I'm not much into smoked beers, but this one is very well-balanced. The smoke provides a nice complement to the toffee and treacle flavor of the malt without going too far and leaving behind a briny flavor. A really nice beer that I may visit again."
"3.75 D: Solid beer all around. No complaints."

"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its robustness of flavoring. While the nose did a nice job of beginning to describe the beer, it didn’t quite prepare you for the powerful, pervasive onslaught of smokiness through the taste. It was like black coffee meets mesquite BBQ meets a beautifully peaty scotch. These blended wonderfully across a base of sweeter chocolate, brown, and coffee malts, with even a bit of hops stopping by to say hello, and add some grassiness. The flavor is strong and excellent to style, and this guy will happily take you to foggy London town and back with a smile on your face the entire time."

"Pours dark but with a lack of head on it. Some faint lacing. Malty that has Chocolate and roast characters. A sweetness is noticed that resembles toffee. Mouthfeel is Creamy with moderate carbonation and noticeable bitter finish. I will try it again."
""

"12oz bottle, pours a cola-like dark brown with a short, tan head that fades to a foam atop the ale leaving a little lacing on the glass. Aromas are roasty, smoky, ashy, french roast coffee grounds. Tastes are smoky, roasted barley, chocolatey, and very well balanced. Mouth-feel is velvety smooth, but fades to be a bit watery at the end; Lower carbonation. Overall, it was nice to come back to this one, seeing as it's been a couple of years since I had it. It was as good as I remember it being."
""
"Overall I like this porter its balanced with it's ""above average ABV"" and packs quite a punch with flavor."

"On the whole, a smooth, solid imperial porter. Good stuff and easy drinking from a local Southern Michigan brewery."
""
"O: Overall a good porter, its not ground-breaking, but it does taste like a slight throwback to the original porter. Stronger in alcohol and flavor than some porters, although not quite as much so as some of the accounts of historic porters."
"Poured from a bottlle into a pint glass. Pours a pitch black with a quarter finger worth of off-white head. Pretty much looks like any other porter. Basically smells of vanilla and coffee beans, although I do have a slight siun infection so perhaps there's a little bit more, although from previous porters I have had I would doubt it. Tastes like vanilla, dark coffee, and dark chocolate. Predominantly the coffee though. The mouthfeel unlocks nothing new except for a slight burnt malt flavor far off in the distance. Overall, I have been disappointed by almost everything that I have had by Arcadia and this beer isn't really an exception if I compare it to other porters such as Gonzo. Would I buy it again? Why? I could have Gonzo instead."

"O: Nice English Porter that goes down easy. Good for the style."
"Yeah, this is great. Very tasty & a little rough around the edges, but in a way that I enjoy & lends some character. Beautiful smoke character with being a ""smoked"" beer, a little more subtle."
""
""
""
""
"O: Would gladly drink it again. It does have some bitter qualities to it but are not overpowering. It has similar taste attributes to that of scotch ales."
"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled 12/16/2011. Pours very dark reddish brown color with a nice 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Some decent spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, coffee, light fruitiness, molasses, biscuit, and herbal hops. Very pleasant and well balanced porter aromas with decent strength. Taste of big chocolate, caramel, molasses, roasted malt, slight dark fruit, cocoa, smokiness, biscuit, earth, and herbal hops. Fair amount of bitterness on the finish, with lingering notes of chocolate, coffee, biscuit, caramel, and herbal spiciness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance of flavors that are quite robust, with no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a nice creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming after the finish present. Very smooth to drink for 7%. Overall this is a damn nice robust porter. A good amount of very robust flavors and nice balance make this very enjoyable. I would have it again."
"Full on roasted malts, maybe burnt in some places. Coffee, chocolate, and some dry, yeasty tartness for an interesting depth of flavor. Chalky but silky palate. Easy to drink for me. I would say sessionable, but the abv. doesn't fit that equation."
"Overall, not your momma's porter. More reminiscent of a scottish ale with the strong smoke and peat flavors. A bit too phenolic for me."
""
"Smooth and very gently crisp in a strong medium-full body with a bit of thickness, the only thing detracting is that the dryness goes just a touch chalky."
""
""
""
"Overall, it has interesting smokiness, with great drinkability."
"o - pretty good but doesn't taste like a typical porter. if the label didn't say otherwise i'd think scotch ale or even a rauchbier. worth a try if you come across it."
"D: Not your usual chocolate & roast with a handful of hops porter. This is the ODP (old dirty porter). Imensely flavorful with very notable smokiness and earthiness. Burly with a strong rustic / old school flair to it - and I really think that is what they were going for. Mission accomplished! A distinct & uber nice porter."
"Overall, not bad, but nothing I'll try again. For 7.2% ABV it goes down easy though."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a solid English Porter. It's very earthy, but that may be exactly what you want. It would go marvelously with a hamburger or a steak off of the grill."
""
""
""
"Overall (4): Lots of great flavors, but too big for this style imo. The booziness really shows and there's a lot of residual sugar which it would be better off without. I will drink this again, if only because it's unique."
""
""
""
""
"Taste-Upfront smokiness, then coffee and dark chocolate notes emerge. Dry, smoky finish. Nice flavor and balance. An excellent match for any BBQ fare."

"I've been wondering about this beer for a while now, and, thanks to this Bliss tasting, I'm finally getting a shot at it. It pours a dark garnet-brown topped by a finger of dirty tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, light molasses, dark chocolate powder, clove, black pepper, and a few blades of dry grass. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a bit more molasses, some maple syrup, and a decent amount of beech smoke. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation, and a fairly dry finish. Overall, a very good porter: It's a bit on the dry side for my liking, but the smoke, though pretty subtle, really works well with the chocolate, roast, and molasses elements. Good times."
"O: nice all around, this beer could be a go to if it were more available. Solid beer at a decent price if you're in the right area."
"O: A very tasty dark porter, especially if you love espresso and dark chocolate. That said, it is very rich, so drinking a full bottle is a bit like trying to eat a big slice of ""death by chocolate"" cake."
"Overall pretty decent but it's not exactly prose inspiring. The end."
"surprisingly enjoyable. one of the better english-style porters I have had."
"O – A very nice brew from the folks at Arcadia. The carbonation makes it a bit tough to get all the flavor but overall a good brew. Very smoky and that may turn some folks off but I did enjoy this one."
" Body is rich and creamy, with a faint oily character, just perfect for a porter. On the whole, very nice indeed, but the bitterness and a somewhat chalky flavor on the finish detract from what could be nearly perfect."
"London Porter pours out a dark brown, nearly black, color. A thick head accompanied the pour, but quickly disappeared and stuck around as very light lacing. The aroma is full of roasted malts and chocolate with fruity notes peaking through. This beer is highly carbonated and unfortunately that makes it difficult to pick out flavors. A somewhat bitter chocolate hits your tongue right away, but give way to a roasted, smokiness. Dark fruits surface when the chocolate flavor fades, and hints of alcohol pop up at the very end."
"This dark dessert pours a dark amber color and settles black with a cream colored head. Barely any lacing. The nose is buttery and roasted. There is some molasses there too. The taste is pretty sweet. There is a tad bit of hops present with some smoke, molassed, and roasted malt. The mouthfeel is very thick and viscous for the the style but enjoyable for sure. Overall, a great brew that is pushing the boundaries for the style and pretty tastey."
"The more I drank, the less I liked it."
"London style Porter has a very dark black color.Its start out with some head and quickly disolves very soon. Smell is no doubt smoky chocolate with hint of dark roasted coffee.I think as far as taste dark chocolate with a smoking aftertaste,and thats what I was looking for.I could drink many of these.This a smooth tasting porter,that most likely I'll drink again."
"Overall, I'm sorry, but this one didn't do it for me."
"Full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer flows over the tongue nicely but sticks just enough to allow the flavors to really shine."
"Overall, this is a good porter. I think the smoke is a little too forward for my taste, but by the end of the glass it seems to blend in better, and I can taste the other flavors better."
"D: this is a nice value beer- robust porter for under $10 a 6 pack. Not something I would purchase regularly, but definitely worth a try."
"Pours out to a blackish-brown body with a thick tan head that quickly disappears. It has little lacing, some retention and good carbonation. The smell is cocoa with some coffee and caramel, nothing really exciting here. The taste is biter chocolate at fisrt followed by some coffee, caramel, a little hint of hops, and seems to have a little bit of molasses in it.It also has a slight smoke flavor mixed in. It finishes off with more chocolate and has a chocolaty aftertaste. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but finishes off a little on the dry. A nice enjoyable beer that is not quite as filling as I would have expected. A pretty good porter, but I have tasted a few better english style porters. Anyone that likes this beer should try Fuller's London Porter which is even better than this beer."
"solid drink, one of my favorites from Arcadia."
"Mouthfeel is as smooth as can be."
"Overall I thought this was a good unique brew. When I saw this was an English Porter, I figured I would be in for a lighter, hoppy porter, but that was not the case. I don't think I would call this beer and English Porter, but I really don't know what style it would fit in. This beer was a pleasant surprise and I am glad I tried it. Good job at making a unique porter Arcadia."
"I liked this porter, but I was ready to b done with the pint. Rich and strong-flavored, it is a true sipper. Another good one from this brewer, and very worth the try."
"bring a driver. at 7.2 the fact that i could drink a hundred of these is dangerous. it drys up my mouth in that good way that makes me want to sip sip sip.looks good hanging on the glass(for you ""lacing""cats)with nice chocolate.the finsh hangs and your mouth wants more."
"D - Meh. This beer isn't awful but it isn't great either. The chocolate flavor is pretty good but this beer just isn't quite there for me yet. I would drink this again but wouldn't buy it unless the other options were extremely limited."
"D - no thanks."
"F: A bit of warming booze throughout that comes out more as it warms. The earthy roasted charred bitter finish with some minerality lingers for a while. More charred roasty malts and perhaps black patent malt also linger for a bit. More chewy malt finish as well. There is also some sticky sweetness. Not quite what I expected for an English style porter, but then again it IS Arcadia, so I guess it's more of a West Coast Americanized English porter. Tasty nonetheless, but loses some points for not quite abiding to the style. Just way too much malts, too much abv, roasted flavors, and minerality."
"Gold Medal winner at 2003 World Beer Championship."
"This is a brew for those who enjoy their craft beer slow and savor every flavor; pleasant and dark."
"Pours a very dark, reddish color, with not too much foam. The lack of foam seems acceptable for the style. Mild, maltish smell. Taste is quite good, on the bitter side but no overt hops. The London Porter also shows a nutty maltiness. This is a good solid beer, and if you are a Porter fan this is definitely worth a try."
"Looks like a regular porter, dark, opaque; like coffee. Head was bubbly and tan in color. It dissolved rather quickly though. Aroma was a mix of alcohol, roasted malts, and some sort of sweetness. Taste had a mix of alcohol, a raisin-chocolate sweetness to it, and roasted malt bitterness as well. Good and thick, but could have used a little more carbonation so it would've have felt like a thin syrup. Not too heavy for a 7.2% ABV, so that's good. BUt the body is too thick to have multiple bottles."
"Though I might prefer less carbonation, it does trick you into thinking that this brew is more sessionable, which if you think it then I guess it is. A fie English porter and a good contender to Fuller's."
"D: If not for the lingering bitterness, this would get a perfect score. It's sort of like if you buy a $5 bar of fine dark chocolate... you're not going to eat the whole thing in one night, regardless of how much you like chocolate. It's tasty, but it wears on you a bit."
"D_Very smooth. Goes down easy."
"Mouthfeel is full and complex with a complete pallet of flavors to keep you interested from first sip all the way through to the aftertaste. A great beer!"
"~Jonathan Passow"
"After seeing this brew for years and reading good things about it I decided to pick it up, though I am not sure why it took so long? Anyway this brew poured to a black color with a medium colored, medium sized tan head that had good retention and left some good lacing, a lot more at the top of the glass. The aroma showcases roasted malts, fruit scent of what I think might be plum with a little raisons, seems to give it a slight sweetness - also could be from the slight chocolate notes? Also there is a slight booziness/alcohol aroma that was a surprise but went well. While the aroma was ok, the flavors are much better. The malts give a nice chocolate flavor, rich, slightly astringent in a perfect way. Some molasses and caramel like flavors give a slight sweetness then it also has a feel of coffee in the background and somewhat at the end of the sip. The feel is dry at the end, some of that coffee flavor adding to that. It is very easy to drink, the 7.2 ABV is a surprise as it does not really come through in the flavor, just the nose. Nice brew."
"This is a drinkable brew...nice example of the style."
"Best beer they have there, I liked it enough to get a growler filled with it. Pours a dark brown/black with a nice coco head to it.. Smell is of chocolate and almonds. Taste is great. Chocolate at the beginning and almonds at the end with a good after taste. Best part of the beer is the taste, no doubt. Mouth feel was medium and drinkability was great. No problem finishing off this brew."
"Pours a clear, dark brown color. 1/4 inch head of a pale tan color. Decent retention and decent lacing. Smells of chocolate, roasted malt, sweet malt, yeast, slight hops, and slight alcohol. Fits the style of an English Porter. Mouth feel is smooth and slighlty creamy with an average carbonation level. Tastes of roasted malt, sweet malt, alcohol, slight hops, and a hint of alcohol. Overall, a good aroma, blend, and body."
"D: Taste is powerful and may become repetitive to some. I will be buying this in the future, but in limited quantities."
"Pours a dark brown color with a moderate tan head that slowly dissapates leaving a sticky lacing behind. Aroma consists of toffee, roasted malt, perhaps chocolate and oatmeal. Taste is a very robust combination of roasted malt bitterness and chocolate/ toffee sweetness. Very flavorable porter"
"D- It's an easy drinker. The full flavor keeps everything interesting enough for me to want it again."
"12 oz. Very dark brown pour, with a small amount of tan bubbles. Sticks to the glass fairly well though. Roast malt, earthy peat, light coffee and chocolates in the aroma. Taste has more roast coffee and heavy roast malt. Some earthyness, nut and bakers chocolate. Hints of black licorice. Mouthfeel not quite creamy. Very nice drinking porter, no alcohol present really. No sourness, holding it back may only be a bit over zealousness with the bitters. A very good American example of an English Porter."
"Flavor is very similar to the aroma with a nice roasted malt body with hints of oatmeal and a tone of chocolate and caramel maltiness. Very smooth medium bodied beer that has a lot of silky maltiness that makes it very drinkable. There is some subtle licorice buried in there and a slightly dry hop finish."
"My only question about this beer was the sediment I found on the bottom. I know it was a ""bottle conditioned beer"" but the sediment was like sawdust. i wasn't all that thrilled about this. Overall, I was pretty content with this porter. Not my favorite but drinkable."
"Overall- i had to try this to give arcadia another shot and to compare to founders porter. well my view on arcadia stands. i haven't tasted anything from them that blew me away."
"Cheers!"
"Overall, this was a solid English style porter that is easy to drink even with the higher ABV."
"Pours a satisfactory dark with good carbonation and head. Smell is fantastic, with roasted coffee and toffee clearly present. Taste is solid with the coffee tones and a little toffee essence coming out on the backend. A little bit light-bodied, though not to its detriment. Decently drinkable, though the higher ABV would prevent consumption of too many in an evening."
"12oz. bottle served in a standard pint. Poured one shade shy of black with deep, ruby highlights around the base of the glass. One inch foamy, off-white head sizzled and popped as it slowly receded. Some slashes of lacing appear as the brew is consumed. Mild nose, perhaps some chocolate malt. Chocolate malt as well as some caramel character comes out in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied. Some light carbonation, but really smooth and silky. Incredibly easy drinking porter; alcohol is well-hidden. If it wasn't for the 7.2% abv, this would make a great session porter."
"D: between the unexpected bitterness and the easily detected ABV, this isn't the most accessible English porter. Still pretty tasty overall."
"Drinkability: I had no problem finishing this porter, and only wished there was another bottle."
"The taste is complex. The beer is quite smooth, rather creamy, with a nice bittering hop bite, but with plenty of ABV to pack a punch. There is some sweet nuttiness and roasted coffee and chocolate flavors. The hop bite, the ABV soaked fruitiness, the combination of charred and roasted malts and coffee flavors pretty much define this beer. It is a beer with lots of character and it doesn't get watery towards the finish. A very nice beer, especially in cold weather, with a nice warming ABV glow to it. L'Chaim."
"Notes: I will get this again because it was easy to drink and well balanced. Perhaps not an exceptional beer yet damn good."
"- mfeel medium to full mouthfeel, slightly sharp from carbonation, little alch warmth, but creamy roundness overall. Mfeel is highlight."
"Drink-ave porter, cheap though and no sign of alcohol"
"Out of a bottle this beer was a nearly-opaque black. The one-finger head showed good retention especially as a collar and the lacing was in curtains. The aroma started with a some sweetness before the darker elements, I detected roasted malt, light chocolate and light coffee notes. The flavors were more bitter and coffee-like than the aroma suggested, but they 'moved' like the aroma. At first I got the sweet elements of chocolate then the darker roasted malt, smoked meat, tobacco, wood, leather and coffee notes. The Fuggles hops added their distinct bitterness. Very dry and robust, like the British sense of humor! The mouthfeel was smooth and rich, the body medium/full and the carbonation light. A well organized, easily drinkable version of this British style."
"D - this was a very good porter. I enjoyed it throughout and really liked the chocolate tones that seemed to dominate the palate."
"Cheers..."
"Overall this was a really good porter, if it had just a little more body it'd be great. Still, it's worth a shot."
"Ipoured this not very exciting looking beer into my tumbler at 50 degrees. The beer was very black to be sure. It had a tan head with nice fine bubbles. The smell was high hops and a metallic smell. The head was dead fast which was dissapointing. The taste however was great. A bit of coffee, not too hoppy and not metallic. I will buy again."
"Drinkability is pretty good for a strong porter of 7.2% ABV. I wouldn't drink it all that quick. The feel is pretty thick for the style but that can be a good thing. A really great amplified version of an English Porter to appease American Porter drinkers. What a treat!"
"D: An excellent porter and a great value too. Arcadia is a bit hit or miss overall, but this one is a great brew."
"Pours a very dark brown with a medium brown, finely bubbled head that leaves nice lacing. The smell is...WOW...very odd. I don't know if I like it and it's not easy to describe. My After the fifth whiff I began to adjust and noted the following: a LOT of Worthers butterscotch and heaps of vanilla, completely inconsistent with what I expected of a porter, but defining the aroma of this beer nonetheless. Also smells of moist coffee grounds. Most peculiar. I'm gonna give it a 4.5 for a combination of its shock factor and complexity. Same score on the taste: too many flavors to handle all at once: There's a sourness that I've rarely tasted in a beer (particularly a dark one) before. The dark chocolate, expresso, and burnt wood are all expected, but the sourness is really interesting. Medium to full body is well crafted. Definitely one that I will be buying again and again."
"Too rich and tasty and bitter to chug, but I'd be happy to have more than one or two."
"Alcohol only shows itself in the form of esters. Dangerous drinkability. Easily one of my favorite new beers. Cheers!"
"And I'm proud that yet another outstanding brewery has emerged from my home state (their English IPA kicks butt too). Now if we can just get Bell's to distribute in Massachusetts..."
"Notes from 8/4/05"
"Pours a dark brown stream through light, but when in a glass it seems black. The head forms a thin sheet of milk chocolate and recedes to a small ring. Smells sweet, kinda like coffee, but a nice smokiness sits behind that. Taste is pretty great. It's kinda thin in the mouth, but a good balanced beer. Tastes of bittersweet chocolate, with a nice roasted malt, and finishes smooth."
"I was impressed with this one. Very enjoyable and recommended."
"D- Way better than I remember. This is like a chocolate milkshake. It is a bit rich, but wow, damn tasty."
"D: Big, hearty, rich and interesting with a good amount of coffee makes this a dark, rich treat to behold."
"Lighter mouthfeel, but the heavy malt and firm alcohol content provide a fuller feeling. Faint carbonation from the bottle conditioning probably intended to mimic cask conditioning. I wouldn't say it is the same as cask, but it will do fine. Drinkable given the alcohol content. The mouthfeel and soft subtle flavors allow this to be an easy sipper. Recommended even if it isn't world class."
"D-Easy to drink I'll have this one again."
"mouth is rich and smooth, a tingling in the side of the mouth is nice. easily drinkable a great session no doubt"
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, good kick, good representation of style, there are better porters out there but this is still a solid beer that is worth drinking for a while."
"MF&D - Creamy and full bodied. A good example of this style."
"Pours a rich black color with a tan head. Smells of roasted malt and chocolate. Taste follows well with chocolate and roasted malts. Nice creamy and nicely carbonated mouthfeel. Drinkability is good, very easy to drink. I could easily have a few but its relatively high abv limits its drinkability. Overall a great beer. I look forward to trying other Arcadia brews in the future."
"Not a bad porter, just odd with the mineral taste. Just not for me I guess."
"Body is medium, creamy, and very smooth. Light but persistant carbonation lend to a lush velvety mouthfeel. Intense flavor in a very sessionable body make this a dangerously drinkable brew. One of the best examples of this style that I've tried."
"Nice porter, and enjoyable to drink. A little too aggressive with the hops for an English porter, much more of an American vibe."
"Deep dark brown with some amber tint, nice pillowey light brown head leaving minimal lacing. Looks great. Aroma is roasty and sweet with a powerful chocolate scent backed by some bitter coffee. A very full bodied beer, mouthfeel is thick, smooth, and creamy. Flavor is off the charts with a heavy chocolate and roasted malt prominence. There is a little bit of roasted smokiness as well but not as forward as I was expecting. Incredible beer here will look for it again."
"D- Very solid brew. Highly recommended."
"An excellent example of the style."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark, almost black, brown. One finger head was chocolate brown in color, and lasted about 5 mins, leaving a ring around the top. Aroma was sweet and fruity, at times reminded me of bananas, and other times of cherry chocolate. Taste was equally sweet, with a touch of bitterness. Kind of like a piece of semi sweet, and 70% dark chocolate at once type of sweetness. Slight bit of acidness in the mouth which detracted from the mouthfeel, but coated fairly well. Mostly easy to drink, but the slight bitterness and acidity hurt."
"D- The heaviness of the flavors keeps this one in check as it should for a relatively high ABV (for the style) beer. This is a nice beer for a chilly evening."
"This is an exceptional porter. The flavor is so complex and the combination of elements so rich that it is hard to envision a better example of this style. Wow."
"I'm wondering if maybe I got a bad bottle. The freshness info on the bottle is rather cryptic - one notch for the letters A-G and one for the numbers 0-6. Why can't more breweries just stick to actual dates? Anyway, my bottle is notched F5."
"Pours a deep dark brown with a somewhat small head. Smell is mostly malt with a smoky quality and some hops undertones. Taste is roasted malt, coffee and hops...quite good. Mouthfeel is dry, with a nice, slightly tart finish. Because of this nice dryness, drinkability is very good."
"Pours almost black with some transluscency to it and some ruby edges. Smell is roasy and an almost cinnamony spiced scent too. Some cardboard like aroma too. Taste is dark, rich and roast coffee-like without the spiced characteristic so much. Somewhat rich body for the style and pretty drinkable. Nice porter."
"D: Excellent. A true standout of the style."
"Might have been skunked - need to try this again to see if it's really as good as everyone else thinks. Especially since I loved the other Arcadia brews."
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is black opaque with a thin, creamy looking head that leaves a nice lacing on the glass. The smell is sweet, almost like a milk stout but also has roasted notes like coffee and chocolate; slightly smoky. The first thing that pops out at me in the taste is also smoke. Not really bitter from the roasted notes as I had expected, really very smooth and slightly malty sweet. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a substantial carbonation that has a bubbly consistency. The drinkability of this is pretty high due to the balanced nature of the beer. Much better than I had expected. Thumbs up to Arcadia for this gem!"
"Drinkability: For a smoked porter, this one runs down a pretty tricky path as it comes out more sour that smoked; that may be a function of age, for even though I just bought the bottle, I cannot decipher the code: ""B0"""
"D - A nice American interpretation of an English Porter w/ a bit more strength and American Style w/ nice British malt and yeast profile - Very Good Drinkability. I would definitely try this again."
"In the past Autumn season, had Arcadia's Jaw-Jacker, which I really liked... heard a lot of good things about their London Porter, and this sample didn't disappoint... certainly lived up to its hype... a very impressive dark-black, opaque, jet hue with an incredible foamy and frothy head that exhibited some staying power... smell is ultra-sweet with cocoa, espresso, and dark-brown, sugar-like notes... taste is laden with candied-sugars, latte-flavor, and dark, burnt chocolate essence, very thick, rich, and creamy taste with noticeable typical Porter-notes coming through.... a slightly medicinal, sweet, sugar-laden flavor... slightly overbearing with its strong flavor... this one is really s strong in taste with an ultra-creamy, rich mouthfeel... drinkability was about average because of the dominating flavor and taste... certainly worth a try..."
"The taste brings it all together very well--plenty of coffee but much more--caramel in all its smooth goodness, chocolate, and also hints of sweet fruit mixed in. It's excellent. However, this is a bit flat, even for porter. All in all, though, this is a fine porter, very delicious. Not one of the very best I've had, but rather good."
"Roasted malts and herbal hops greet the tongue. Rich chocolate sweetness and peat malt take over. Roasted bitterness hangs around in the background. Hints of sasparilla, vanilla, and dark fruit sweetness. Roasty, herbal hop bitterness in the finish. Medium-full body with a slightly oily feel. Very good. This may be Arcadia's best full time offering."
"Mouthfeel has a fantastic creamy quality to it. Very smooth and easy to drink. The ABV is well hidden, so it sneaks up on you by the third or fourth round. Very good porter indeed."
"Drinkability is fine as it goes. As their signature entry-level porter, however, Arcadia should lower the abv to the 5.5% range. I like big beers periodically, but I don't understand the need to push the regular beer line-up into the ""imperial"" range, even if they don't use the moniker. Still, I have yet to find the equal to Fuller's London Porter."

"Pours opaque with a darker tan head. Some roasted chocolate tones on the nose. After time there seems to be a good bit of dark chocolate on there as well. Seemed a bit mild at first, especially compared to some of the outrageous baltic porters I have had the chance to try in the past, but it opened up over time. Flavor is thick with malts; a touch of sweetness kicking in on the end. Slight roasted tones on the flavor as well. Mostly though, thick malt qualities abound here. Feel is thick with a low carbonation. Overall extremely drinkable. Smooth and rich. Try it. I would put this up against any of the ""great"" baltic porters of Europe. The only thing that they might outdo this one in is the nose. Over time this one gets just better and better as it warms. Amazing."
"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Chimay Chalice. To be completely honest, I think this is the first porter I have wholly enjoyed. I have a tendency to stay away from the style. Aroma is of dark chocolate, apples and cloves. Taste is just as complicated with hints of chocolates, dark fruits and maybe something like bourbon. Mouthfeel is fuller than expected. Quite a drinkable porter."
"d: I could drink an awful lot of this beer, in fact, if I had more than one bottle, that's what I'd be doing right now. It has higher than average abv, but you wouldn't know from the taste, goes down real easy. I'm glad I picked this up, a surprisingly good porter, well done."
"D - This is one hell of a porter! I really wasn't expecting any more than an average brew, but this is exquisite!"
"12 oz. brown bottle, conditioned; brewed with English 2-row, and Pacific Northwest hops - served in a chalice. Clear, and oh-so close to black, topped with a rather thin, light-brown head, but the carbonation eventually works up a nice layer of foam. Pleasant aroma, with roasted chocolate, hints of fig and coffee, and a mild backing of hops. On the palate, it is almost fully-attenuated, and quite bitter from the hops and burnt/charred malts, but it has a nice, toasted malt flavor underneath. Adding to this is a big coffee bite, tobacco?, leather?, dark, semi-sweet chocolate, and some floral/piney hops hiding beneath. The body is medium, mouth-coating, low in carbonation, and it imparts a long finish. Overall it tastes kinda like a standard US stout to me, but that's fine, as I really enjoyed this one. It improves as it warms, with bitterness subsiding and flavor increasing, however I think this beer could use a touch of sweetness tossed into the mix."
"D: Enjoyable porter with a lot of flavor. Decent complexity and a sturdy quaffability."
"A different porter. Sweeter and fruitier than other porters. Pretty dry on the finish and, again, chalky in the end as well."
"D - A nice solid beer that is better then the sum of it's parts. Very drinkable."
"D - This is a pretty good porter. It looked and smelled great. The taste was nice, too."
"The body is solid overall, but the initial acidity almost gives the illusion that it's thinner than it actually is. It's a pretty tasty porter but it's not reminiscent of any English porter I've had."
"Does thin a bit by mid-bottle, but overall a solid performer."
"Pours an almost black ruby with a decent offwhite head. Smells medicinal with a very subtle roast. Taste is of sour coffee, and a little roasty. Medium in the mouth with a little carbonation sting. Had to take my time on this one and wasnt reaching for another when it was done."
"This porter is a dark color with just a hint of light. There is a fair sized tan head. The smell is a herbal smell along with toasted grain. The taste is roasted oatmeal and other grain along with a herbal taste. Mouthfeel is fair and drinkability is ok. Lots of strange flavors here and overall I am not too impressed. I would likely not revisit this beer."
"Nice drinkable session porter. Perfect for the new and much wanted autumn crisp in the evenings."
"Finishes with a hint of grapefruit along with the roasted bitterness, also unusual for an English Porter, but very nice. This could be one of my favorite porters."
"Drinkability: Good beer. Nice flavor balance make this a good porter. Would recommend a purchase of at least a bottle or two. Would not go through more than one in a sitting though."
"The beer pours a deep, dark black color with a towering tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is below average. It has an extremely sour aroma. It has a dark malt presence (roasted, chocolate, patent), but it's to contaminated to tell exactly. The taste is average. It has a nice roasted flavor that goes down easy, but it finishes dry and sour with a lingering tartness. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a below average beer. It's spoiled and ruined with contamination. It tastes like a porter riddles with lambic yeast."
"Black color. Medium body. Very complex aroma and taste---roasted malt, bitter and sour. None of the sweetness, but with all the flavors of many imperial stouts. Best Arcadia brew that I've tried! This, like most porters, is over-looked. Sour over-tone which is very much in line with original porters which included sour, left-over beer. Less than $9 for a 6-pack."
"Drinkability - this is excellent ale, and is low enough in abv to be entirely sessionable. Very hearty and delicious."
"Overall, one of my favorite beers to get on tap. Well-balanced with big malty flavors. I'll have to be more careful with the yeast the next time I drink it out of a bottle."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy tan head, some sticky lacing follows. The nose is mostly malty, toffee/caramel. The taste is malty, slightly roasted, there is a sweet/bitter/tangy thing going on, quite different than other Baltic Porter's I've had. The finish is dry. Medium body. Very drinkable, glad to have had a chance to try, also I have an extra bottle. This is also my first Arcadia brew, but I have alot of other's to review."
"Overall: Arcadia has some hits and misses with me. This one is more of a miss. I think the flavours on this one are more subdued than I would like for the style, and it strikes me as one of the weaker locally brewed porters, hence, it's unlikely that I'll buy it again."
"A very nice Baltic Porter, and just a good Porter period. Its nicely complex and very well crafted for balance. Would pair well with a nice steak, some spicy stew, meat & potatoes, or some dry white cheddar. Would drink again with zero hesitation, give it a shot."
"Very easy to drink, great porter, will be looking for more of this."
"D: Very approachable and sessionable porter. Would have liked some more roastiness."
"For whatever reason I have passed on this beer many times when back home man what was I thinking?Poured a near pitch black only a few hints of ruby thruout a tight almost creamy mocha colored head leaving a sheet of lace as it settled slowly atop.So much going on in the nose and palate of this beer its amazing molasses,dark roast coffee,bitter chocolate,fruit,and even a hint of mint not mention some smokiness.Complex flavors from beginning to finish with a creamy mouthfeel,dark roast coffee with a more pronounced smoky elemant with some molasses and unsweetened chocolate melding into a leafy,herbal finish.Easily the best Arcadia brewed beer in my mind just awesome!"
"Notes: Earthiness reminds me of a blue Roquefort cheese, try it as a pairing."
"Into a nonic, pours a dark brown black, with some tan head, little lacing. The aroma is decent, coffee and roasted malts, bitter chocolate, perhaps some lactose sneaking in. The taste is dark, bitter, chocolates, the mouth smooth and creamy. In all, not a bad porter, but forgettable in my book."
"Overall- Not too shabby. An enjoyable Porter. Worth the $2."
"-Oelergud"
"Mouthfeel was medium/thin. Mild pinpoint carbonation. Very nice indeed."
"D- A good solid example of the style, not an overpowering flavor. Definetly a drinker."
"D - My only complaint of this beer is that I wish it was thicker and creamier to match the aroma and taste. Otherwise this beer is outstanding."
"Taste is a fruity coffee, so to speak. The coffee melts into a cocao flavor, which is attached to some fruit. Finishes nice and dry. Not much aftertaste, which is good."
"Not bad but just too buttery and sweet (without a certain flavor) for me. The fruitiness doesn't seem to go as well as I would like with the coffee. I would not have guessed this to be a Baltic Porter, as there is no indication of this on the label (expected a lower, more ""sessionable"" brew - though I like the style, so really not complaining) and, given that, the alcohol is pretty well-hidden. There are other Baltic Porters I would easily choose over this one."
"Poured an opaque and shiny with a dark brown color. A soapy, tan colored head quickly develops and leaves behind a splash of lacing. Aromas of roasted malt, cream, dark fruit, and candy; quite interesting. The taste follows suit with crisp hop flavors and mellow plum flavors. Slighly sour finish with hints of juicy fruit. Slightly chewy texture."
"drinkability is great. very well balanced and quite enjoyable. i'll definitely be looking for a sixer of this one next time i'm in michigan. thanks jan!"
"D: Excellent flavors, richly roasty and balanced. I would enjoy having more of this again. Seems mis-categorized on BA as a Baltic; much more a true roasted dark porter with assertive hopping. Very tasty - thanks to CRJMellor for sending a couple of these!"
"D: Having gravitated to the Baltic porter style, Arcadia London Porter did not disappoint. Creamy, hearty and delicious. Higher ABV limits the amount had in one session. Recommended."
"D: Great porter for someone who wants to get in to porters. Very approachable with great coffee flavors and a bit of mocha to boot."
"A pretty drinkable brew that is full flavored, dark, and roasty."
"A good porter, and certainly worth a try, but there are much better offerings out there if you're looking for a true Baltic porter."
"Pours the darkest of browns,with a slight redish hue. Smell is , nice, but a bit weaker than I would have liked. Roasted malts,and coffee are the strongest. Body is medium, and smooth. Taste is smooth too, but with a bite. Dark fruits,and roasted malts with a hint of dark chocolate,and coffee. Excellent."
"I can't say that I was unimpressed with this one, as overall it was fairly enjoyable. I'd call it more so underwhelmed by an unspectacular brew. It needs to be beefed up a bit in a few areas. I can't discourage you from buying it, but I can say that I've had many that are better. It's a slightly above average brew overall by my standards."
"Label on bottle is marked as ""D4", which according to Arcadia's website for the London Porter matches up with 9/5/2006. I don't know if it was packed that day, or best by that date. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with an inch tan head. It smells like roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit and coffee. It tastes like coffee, dark fruit, chocolate, caramel and some vanilla. Starts off sweet and then has a bitter, tart finish, and also some alcohol warming too. Mouthfeel is light/medium, and a bit slick. Drinkability is good too, nice and smooth. Overall, I think it's a pretty decent beer."
"Thanks to Nutbrown for this sample!"
"Muthfeel/Drinkability; mouthfeel is medium to full, with a very pleasing carbonation that seems to fit this beer perfectly. As i said already, I'm having hard time keeping this from disappearing so you know the drinkabilty is really good."
"Medium mouthfeel,a bit creamy,slightly dry with a good syrupy feel that makes the mouth water for more. An execllent porter,flavorful and well rounded,a must try porter. Wish I had another one!"
"D - An easily drinkable beer. A real treat. Too strong to session, but it is feasible. I imagine most foods would only detract from the better qualities of this brew. I would love to have this again in the future."
"The body is full with a creamy texture that is smooth. A nice warming effect and easy to drink. Overall, I would have liked more of a smokier taste as well as a more astringent flavor, but I think the beer tastes on par with a more English style with the malt and hops. Its Churchill for peace."
"D - I would enjoy this one much more with a little less smokiness and a little less burnt taste."
"not my favorite, but its still pretty good. I could see this being much better in the right situation....like on a cold snowy day."
"Overall, the carbonation just blew out of the bottle, begging to be drank. The smell was enticing although a bit light. The flavor perfect, bold, complex, balanced and mellow enough on the palate. A good winter warmer, and certainly would make Old Winnie proud."
"This beer is perilously drinkable. I could spend some serious intimate time with this beer."
"-Winston Churchill to his Secretary of War, 1944"
"Drinkability is good, not great but good I would be glad to get this in a trade again. Thank you Shbobdb. MK"
"Suprisingly light body, otherwise a very nice porter."
"A dark brown color with hints of red along the sides of the glass. An inch thick, caramel color head forms, lacing down the glass slowly. The smell of chocolate and coffee are dominating the aroma, but there is slight twinge of an alchol scent at the end. The taste starts with the sweet flavor of the malt from the lips to the palate, then a the strong flavors choclate and coffee comes in to finish it off. A richness coats the palate at the start and then it begins to few a tad chewy at the end. The alchol from the aroma makes its presence felt at the end in the back of the throat. Easy to drink beer, more so probably in the cold, not so much on a hot day."
"I could drink this beer all night. I cant image how could this beer would be on cask! It might be so good Id weep drinking it. Damn, my first Arcadia beer was a stand-up triple. I really liked this beer. I mean a lot. It has been worth the wait. Thank you RedHaze! Highly Recommended."
"Topnotch! One of the better and more interesting Baltic style porters I've had the pleasure to sample. Pleasantly complex."
"This fellow is a sturdy ale, not for the faint of heart. The head is a thick, creamy tan head that leaves lots of thick bubbly lacing on the glass. The beer is nearly black in color with only the slightest hint of light passing through.The nose is a combination of sweet and roasty, with a slight hoppy aroma that is barely noticable. Taste is great! There is a bit of a nutty burst at first taste. Then you begin to notice the roasted malts. There seems to be a sweetness that comes through that is reminiscent of lactose. Caramel malt is also prevalent. As for mouthfeel, this beer keeps you in check. Lots of body and flavor, coupled with a good amount of carbonation. Drinkability is awesome. Beware of the alcohol, as it barely peeks its head."
"Dvery solid.. I would have this again and again, great chocolate flavor"
"Heavyweight's Perkuno's Hammer is untouchable as far as I'm concerned when it comes to Baltic Porters. Arcadia London Porter, however, is exceptional beer and is easily the equal of the Okocims and Sinebrychoffs of the world. This one is worth the effort to acquire it. And then some."
"Brewery website describes this beer as a ""robust English porter"" with which I entirely agree. Also notes use of smoked malts, but I didn't get much sense of smoke other than perhaps touch in roasted flavors. Not as robust as American takes on the style, which emphasize more hops, but this did have a potent maltyness that leaned a bit toward Baltic porter. Very nicely done, if perhaps a bit of style bender."
"Received on tap at Zingermann's Roadhouse. Dark chocolate appearance like a cola. Small creamy head with slight remaining lace. Smell's of dark chocolate with coffee undertones. Slight bittery aftertaste that does not shock the pallate until savoring the sip. Very drinkable for two rounds."
"Thick smooth mouthfeel was wonderful and modest carbonation. This is a style I just love and a beer that fits the style. Well done."
"Creamy thick refreshing porter. Very drinkable."
"Appearance is dark cola brown practically opaque large toffe brown head leaves nice even streaks of lacing throughout the whole pint. Aroma has a dark chocolate and strong coffee presence with notes of fruity overtones with herbal hop bursts very nice. Taste is luciously sweet with dark chocolate and herbal hops providing some balancing bitterness, my palate enjoys the creamy layers of chocolate and burn malt provided toffee notes very complex and drinkable. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied robust English porter has even natural carbaontion with the occasional floating yeast particles adss a nice texture to this brew. Drinkability is excellent, I consumed mine while sitting in the sun and still enjoyed this dark beer instead of the typical pilsner or hefe."
"NOTE: Listed on the brewery's website as 7.20% and 42 IBU's."
"Well, I'd certainly be willing to have another if someone else pays, but I don't know why I would try this again considering the abundance of inexpensive porters (Great Lakes, Great Divide) that taste better and don't have so much of a slick malty feel to them. I'm glad to have tried it, but I'm afraid it doesn't live up to others. Nice and boozy though. ;^)"
"Wow. I'm amazed by this beer. I could see myself drinking this a lot."
"Very dark, nearly black beer topped by a short, brown cap of dense foam. Thin sheets of lace form as you empty your glass and the head retention is decent. Rich, malty aroma with plenty of roasted and coffee character. Burnt and chocolate dark malts play well against a light charcoal smokiness. Chocolatey malt flavour and moderate hoppiness form a bittersweet balance. Smoke comes through along with burnt, carmelized sugar. Finishes just off-dry with a balanced sweetness. Creamy texture, low carbonation and full body. An excellent porter overall."
"D: A strong beer, definitely one I will get again. You cannot tell that it is higher in ABV at first, but you find out as you sip. A strong porter, excellent beer!"
"A terrific brew. Typical roasted, chocolate, bittersweet characteristics of porters but with a mild estery tone. Light fruitiness pimarily of ripe grapes with a milk sugar sweetness. Light in body compared to bold taste. Finishes lightly powdery and moderatedly refreshing for a porter. My first offering from Arcadia is a winner."
"drinkability: very nice"
"I will definitely have this again and I want another right now."
"Overall a rather enjoyable beer. Despite it's inconsistencies the whole package makes for a nice experience, largely a result of the flavors."
"Smoky, malty and mildy coffee-like. Deep black with a thumb thick mocha head. Fore is hoppy bitter then roasted barley malt follows. Very much in the Fullers vein as opposed to the more roasty and coffee/chocolate flavored American porters. Very nice brew."
"This beer pours an opaque, metallic black color. The head is massive, creamy an light tan. The aroma is as massive as the head. Rich malts, chocolate, cream, butter crackers. The taste is wonderful. Malty, chocolaty, and alcoholic. For only having 7% ABV, this beer shows it well. Its presence adds a lot to the flavor. The mouthfeel is smooth, full bodied, and has low carbonation. Overall, this is a great baltic porter, and is perhaps the best I have had to date."
"Music: ""Final Frontier"" by Soul Position"
"Very drinkable. would be an awesome session beer as well if it were not so high in alcohol. Highly recommended."
"D: The drinkability might be a little prolonged with this one due to the thick heavy body and the knock-you-on-your-ass flavors. Its a sipper. Overall its a kick ass beer, fun to try."
"Top notch shit...I'm impressed...will buy again"
"Pours out nearly black with a large tan head. The aroma is roasted malt, licorice, and smoke. Roasted malt flavor with licorice and grapes. Some cocoa too. Finish is herbal. This beer has so many flavors working together, it's difficult to pick them all out. Mouthfeel is fairly thick. A bit astringent. Nice drinkability. I can't believe this beer comes from the same brewery that makes the terrible sampler. All four of those beers sucked. This beer, on the other hand, borders on great. A great deal at $1.25 for a 12 ounce bottle too."
"This Michigan London Porter certainly makes its way to the table ""on its own!"""
"Medium brown appearance, light brown head quickly recedes to a cover. Mellow roasted caramel has a touch of anise to it. The hops are mellow, but give the impression of a lactic component rather than citric. Herbal, chocolatey in a milky fashion. Honest roastiness, earthy, oily, comfortable in mouth. Low carbonation, medium bodied, excellent mouthfeel, slightly oily and smooth, rich for a porter though Im very surprised it is 7%. Good flavour balance, but as with most porters, Im left on my appetite, I cant think of a time when Ill crave for a porter."
"Drinkability: Solid and tasty with a nice base malt flavor with other flavors to compliment. A solid offering and one worht looking for if you're in the area."
"Overall, this is a fine sweet porter and shows a better balance of flavor than many other American attempts at the style."
"D- This has good porter qualities but it needs more. I would really like to see some more complexity in here to give it some interest. But a good start on a Baltic porter."
"The flavour is spot on tasty. Chocolate cream with a nicely adjusted bitterness. The alcohol again fits in with this scheme. Well hopped, great malt base. Surprisingly massive body. This chap has more backbone than some of the stouts I have had. Great substance, nice flavour balance, delicious scent...what more could it have? This is a fine porter from the Crick. More than worthy of a try. Surely worthy of a repeat."
"Drinkability: One of the best offerings by Arcadia. Glad I can get this local. A touch too bitter to make this a regular occurence but it's a rock solid beer. Strongly recommended."
"Great looking colorized picture of Winston Churchill on the bottle, giving the ""Victory"" sign. Pours a nealry pitch black body, very, very dark, in my chalice. Not a lot of head action after the pour, just a thin layer of foam. Smell is dark chocolate, cherry, and a smooth graininess are all in the nose. Very potent smelling. Big flavors, alot of alcoholic bourbon and rum flaovr, slight cherry, big chocolate, and a perfect amount of acidity. A nice big porter, not at all what I was expecting when i picked up a single of this beer. I could almost session these, a real smooth drinker, at a reasonable price."
"Essentially opaque dark brown, just a bit of light comes through. Flat and persistent head of 1/4 of an inch. Adequate laces, simple and thick strings. Aroma is malty, some fruity notes, mostly of pear juice. Mouthfeel settles at just shy of medium and the overall carbonation level is fine in texture. Quite chocolately in flavor, slightly dusty and musky but not detracting from that initial impression. Hops are hardly noticeable. The profile thins slightly from beginning to end but never really wavers from what you get to begin with. A sweet malty Porter from start to finish with mostly pleasant aspects that give some chewy qualities. When I reviewed this it was classified as a Baltic Porter, nah....nice drinkability."
"Pours an incredibly dark brown, almost black color with a small head that falls to nothing more than a broken ring over top. The nose is nice. I get notes of chocolate and coffee with an underscore of figgy dark fruits. The flavor is dominated with coffee, but not too bitter. The chocolate and light fig come int in the middle to balance things out a little, but the bitter coffee grounds hit again on the end. The feel is thick, with a moderate carbonation. It works very well. A hightly drinkable beer. The flavors are bold, but not too big. No hint of the 7%. A very well built beer here."
"Pours a dark color with very little head and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. Aroma has a lot of maltiness, some chocolate and a little roasted. The flavor has a lot more roasted character than the nose. Good maltiness. The finish is bitter from the roasted malts. Mouthfeel is moderate to thick and the drinkability is ok."
"excellent!"
"Full mouthfeel, very stout like. I could have a few more of these."
"This is a very dark brown, almost no light makes it through the glass. The head was tan and small. The smell is wonderful. Lots of sweet roasted malt and chocolate. The taste is wonderful as well. Sweet malt and alcohol balanced by the bitter roasty flavors. The mouthfeel is very smooth, with a nice thickness. This is a delicious, smooth, and very drinkable beer. The best beer I've had from Arcadia so far."
"Sampled a 12 ouncer, imported to New York state from a recent trip to that beer center known as Ann Arbor, Michigan. No freshness dating, but the types of hops and malts used to brew the beer are listed in the upper label, a nice touch. Pours allmost black, with light coming thru on the edges. Oily tan head showing good retentive qualities, tiny bubbles, and respectable lacing left behind. the nose is rich, inky, jammy. This is a full flavor, fruity brew, notes of grape preserves, ink, smoke, leather. Robust, fruity and complex, this is an interesting and differant Porter. Notes of chocolate and minimal hops in the finish"
"I can't remember what I thought of this beer when it was fresh, but I'm fairly certain I am enjoying this a LOT more. Too bad I didn't bother to put any more away when I did this one."
" Drinkability is good a nice porter tastey treat from Michigan thanks to CRJMellor for this sample."
"Cokes, you're the man for shooting some of this my way."
"I would recommend letting this one warm up before opening, and then start drinking it 1/2 hour after it is poured. So plan ahead. Or do whatcha like. Either way, this is another solid offering from Arcadia, so enjoy."
"Jolly Good! Dont make the mistake of giving this one the V Sign."
"Reviewed from a 12oz bottle drank on 12/22/04. Nice label with Winston Churchill giving his approval. Appearance is very dark brown with an inch of tan foamy head. Rings of lace were left around the glass as the head stayed for a decent bit. Chocolate malt, roasted coffee and a touch of bitter earth hops comprise the aroma. Bitter sweet dark chocolate and roasted coffee roll onto the tongue first. A bitter earthiness from the hops is present as well. Very tasty brew that ends on a roasty coffee note. Fairly thick feel for the style and its quite creamy and goes down very smooth. Very nice beer I would love to make a session beer in it was local. Thanks to tikkigodxxx for another great brew."
"This is a very good example of an english style porter from a U.S. brewer. Nice, roasty, balanced, and very drinkable beer. I will be buying this one again."
"Opaque, very dark brown in color. Small light tan head. Some lacing is present. Smell of sweet lightly roasted malts. Taste explodes on your tounge. A rush of coffee, then chocolate, then a hint of alcohol. This beer is thick in the mouth, but the hops are present just enough to clean the palate of the coffee and chocolate notes and then make you want to drink more."
"This is a paralytic session brew."
"Rich, smooth and creamy in the mouth. This beer has a killer body and is only accentuated by its delicate carbonation. This beer practically drinks itself, and I would too if I were it. Would that make me a cannibal? I sure hope so."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed 3/4"" tan/light brown head over the barely translucent root beer brown brew. Head is dense and resilient, and laces excellently. Aroma is of sweet, dark malts, with a touch of coffee notes. Taste is as indicated by the nose, almost exactly. Mouthfeel and drinkability are great for the style, and I wish it was more readily accessible around here. Nice porter..."
"Finish is slowly drying and the hops come forward as the malts recede on the tongue....light metallic aftertaste...a very well made and well executed porter that hints at ""imperial porter"" status but stays sufficiently dry and drinkable...nice porter..will go out of my way to get some on the next trip south."
"Nice deep dark color.Good head that lingers all the way down. wonderful roasted aroma-more roasted then some other porters. Great roasted flavor,some chocolate and maybe a touch of licorice. Velvety smooth,real nice oily feel to it-good body for style. A really good porter-well worth giving a try."
"On the whole, a very pleasing porter."
"Very, very good."
"Sorry, I was a bit distracted, I had my face stuck in the glass inhaling this stuff for the past 5 minutes or so. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, with a picture of Winston Churchill on the label (or is that W.C. Fields?--nah, the British flag in the background wouldn't suit the latter). No real head on the pour to speak of, but it does have a thickish beige ring to it. Seems deep black until held up to the light, then it takes on more of a dense mahogany tone. And the aroma... Needed a few more minutes there. I don't know why it does its thing to me, not entirely exceptional, but highly addictive. I had just crossed over to the land of hopheads recently, and now I'm being drawn back to the brotherhood of maltoids again because of this. Burnt malt, rich chocolate, toasted nuts, a bit of buttery rum and dried figs, and some toffee. The flavour has chewy, sticky malt, coffee, dry dark chocolate, a some alcohol, with a dry burnt woodsy finish. Very dry aftertaste like cocoa mixed with espresso. Somewhat watery mouthfeel at first, but gains texture over the palate, very dry taste for such a sweet smelling porter. Very satisfying. Big thanks to northyorksammy for the sample."
"Lower attenuation, less palate pounding, and its that simple, for me, to make me like this more."
"Its been awhile but many thanks to CRJMellor for the bottle. A fine porter to be had here and as a porter, easy to drink after a long hard day. Its appearance is very nice, with a dark as nite color and a wonderful beige head that cascades well and laces great. The aroma of roasted malts, semi-sweet chocolate and coffee. The tastes reflect the aroma with a complex blend of malts accented with the likes of brown sugar. A bitter sweet finish is left on the mouth, but not overpowering. The beer is very smooth, creamy and easy to drink, even at 7% abv. A soothing relaxer. Good job Battle Creek."
"Very deep ruby, almost balck, color with a large beige head. The head slowly recedes to a thin collar and leaves wispy rings of lace. Roasted aroma with, odd as it may sound, peanut butter cups. Also has a faint scent of smoke. Big and malty. Dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt. A hint of smokiness is present along with some hops to balance things out. Alcohol does not show up in the flavor. Full bodied, smooth and very creamy. Goes down ultra smooth. Be warned, this is very easy to drink - especially for something at 7%. Very good."
"A big U.P. thanks goes out to trbeer for this one eh!"
"Very good porter, I will have this again. It quenched my thirst, the balanced clear ovaltine malt and bittersweet chocolate and complex taste. Beautiful creamy head , complex aroma, black colour. Full mouth feel with mild roasted taste, not too coffee.. Some carbonation of hops."
"My sister picked a few of these up for me on her raod trip through Michigan and, boy, am I glad she did. This came out with a perfectly fluffy tan head that soon turned to a dry foam The aroma was very sweet and full of burnt chocolate and toffee. The taste started out sweet, had an alcholic taste midway through, and finished very crisp and dry. It did not have a heavy amount of vanilla or nut that is accustom to many porters, but it was VERY enjoyable. Definately one porter to keep stocked in the cellar!"
"Really nice flavor. Comparible to Fuller's in many way except slightly more bitter. Medium bodied with notes of raisins, chocolate, vanilla, subtle smoke and some tangy notes on the finish. I thought this was a little to hoppy but I still enjoyed it."
"Comments  Thanks again to skyhand for hosting the BA tasting and for supplying this Michigan Porter."
"One of my favorite porters. A shy, lacey head and subtle roasted carob scent falls right in with the smooth, full-bodied mouthfeel. Lots of bitter dark chocolate, roasted barley flavor, hint of coffee. A bitter kick to the finish keeps any sweetness in check, ensuring that no one mistakes this porter for a lazy dessert beer."
"Thank you to trbeer for this bottle. A simply fantastic porter, as sweet as they come, and one that I hope to get my hands on again!"
"Thx to CRJMellor for this one."
"Sampled at From The Vine beer tasting Jan 9th, 2004: Pours a dark brown color with a medium beige head that lingers. Not too much lacing going on. Nice amount of nuts and coffee in the aroma. A little more rich than a lot of Porters, with a good amount of coffee, malt, chocolate and hops in the flavor. The finish is nutty with a bit of molasses. I liked this one."
"Pours black with some amber highlights and a 2 finger tan head. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma is full of coffee and some chocolate, with light notes of malt and some herbal hop notes. Flavor begins like a sweet espresso with notes of chocolate and toffee. Some herbal notes make their way though, and the roasted malt and hops combine to make for a nice bitter finish. Very smooth, with low to medium carbonation and a medium to full body. A very good beer that I could drink all night!"
"Super dark brown with a tan head. Aromas of sweet, roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit and a touch of aromatic hops. Taste is basically a sweet, roasted malt onslaught with dark fruit, toffee, coffee, and chocolate. The minimal hop presence serves its function quite well; they provide excellent balance in this strong porter. Mouthfeel is ridiculously smooth and enticing. Drinks well for its strength. I'd like to find a cask-conditioned offering of this beer."
"Great label on the bottle also."
"This was one excellent beer. Very many flavors come through. I notice chocolate and cream/vanilla combined at the onset. coffee is next to follow. Some roasted malts mix with a smokiness that really makes this beer stand out. Finishes with some dry leafy hops combined with more smoky flavors. Excellent."
"Nearly black brew, with hints of ruby at the edges forms a quickly thinning tan head atop medium bubbles with sparse lace, even with a vigorous pour. Carbonation is moderate. Mouthfeel is soft and moderately cloying with a firm body...very much a robust porter. Aroma is of dark roast coffee, sweet chocolate, dark roasted grains, and a very nice touch of campfire smoke..think Kaiserdom meets Anchor, minus the molasses. Taste starts out with very mild flavor hops, a quick burst of smoke, quickly melding into a firmly sweet malt body with lots of chocolate and dark crystal malts and sparse roasted barley. The alcohol becomes noticeable after a few sips, and becomes more dominant as it warms. The finish is mostly of semisweet chocolate and grains with a very mild bittering hop counterbalance and faint smoke. The smoked malts and strong malt body really add to the complexity of the brew, and make this one of the better robust porters."
"On the palate it is much rounder that I anticipated based on the smell. Simple bitter chocolate and coffee flavors dominate to a medium-long, slightly tangy finish."
"Very deep color with a light brown creamy head. I'd expect a bit more aroma - light dark malt and some background smokiness; no hop. Immense chocolate flavor immediately followed by alot of alcohol and a distinct Fuggles flavor. Complex and full bodied with a warming character. Very nice!"
"I have to say that I didn't catch the smoke that should have come from the beechwood smoked malt in this one, but I did notice a richness that could have come from a subtle smoking. If so, it suits the flavor well because this beer exhibits nothing that could offensive in flavor or aroma. Nice rich caramel, roasty malt flavor with some light hop notes to balance it out a bit. Nice thick tan head tops off a very black beer. I could get used to drinking beers like this."
