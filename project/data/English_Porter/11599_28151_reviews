"Decent porter, but nothing special."

"Not much here, certainly not offensive but just not much personality to distinguish it from others."

"Not the best porter I have had.  Tastes like a dark Budweiser. I hope that I got a bad glass or the wrong beer, but I didn't get any of the overtones I read about in the reviews."

"The Green Man Porter is one of my favorite porters.  Very smooth.  Hint of chocolate and coffee, and slight smoky finish.  But that is what I expect in a porter.  My only criticism is the head.  It has none and almost seems flat.  Still a good beer. If you like porters, definitely try this one."

"Smokey, roasty, slightly sweet, a bit of chocolate. This is a delicious porter."

"O - Very high drinkability.  Enjoyable.  Definitely a go-to porter if available!"
""
"Overall: I am so happy this is being distributed more widely and in bottles. My one problem, which really is not a problem is they should offer this in cans. I hope they do, a lot of Asheville breweries are beginning to go that direction."

"Blurb on bottle: Dark, full-bodied, and rich in flavor, Green Man Porter is wonderfully easy to drink. It offers a creamy, smooth mouthfeel and finishes with distinctive chocolate notes. This traditionally crafted, award-winning British-style Porter, like a true rock star, enjoys a legendary following."

"Knew nothing about this beer or brewery when I picked it up. A good one, I'll be looking for more of their offerings when back down south"

"O - This is a great porter. I would drink this regularly if locally available. Thanks Tim!"

"Dark brown with an auburn glow in the right light around the edges. Head is a couple fingers high at the start and recedes to a thin sheet and ring. Very light brown in head color. Aroma is creamy chocolate, something like green fresh coffee bean, vanilla, nicely malty, and a touch earthy. Taste is sweet, malty caramel and cocoa followed by a drawn out semi-bitter hoppiness, in the direction of pine, and resiny through the finish. Has a sprucy mintiness as well. Chocolate of various kinds...bittersweet, milky, dark, and cocoa-y... Pretty nice stuff. Good mouthfeel; creamy, silky soft, a liiiitle bit chewy."

"O - I wasn't impressed. It wasn't horrible, but I can think of a lot of better Porters."

"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint, the beer is a dark, deep, amber-highlighted brown coloring with a slim, filmy ring around the surface. Aromas of cream, bittersweet chocolate, and subtle roasted coffee. Extremely balanced nose, and very inviting. Flavors are chocolate forward, bitter and slightly roasted, with cream highlights and hints of vanilla. Very tasty, and once again, very well balanced. Light in mouth, with a dryness to it that keeps the sweet flavors in check. The aftertaste is more of the bitter coffee and cocoa notes, but the creamy sweet character does peek it's head out here and there at the end of each drink. The finish is slick, crisp, and slightly dry. Very solid, tasty brew."

"O: This is a very nice and enjoyable porter and probably my favorite beer from Green Man - it has been a solid brew for quite a while and one which is definitely sessionable. Easy to drink with well hidden alcohol."

"Thin head, crests around one finger’s worth, deep tan in color, disappears very quickly, mostly tinier bubbles, doesn’t really have lacing per se as a razor residue after you tilt the glass. The liquid is an impenetrable black with a yellow aura around it, upon very close inspection there’s a few bubble beads visible. The nose is filled with brazil nuts, cashews, vanilla, caramel and brown sugar, cherry and red berry fruit, while sweet and roasty also has that telltale “organic” metallic, mineral water touch to it, no overt signs of hops, however, the overall feel has a refreshing stiffness to it, not soft and flabby. Light to medium-bodied, the carbonation has decent activity and that mineral water aspect gives it cleanliness. The cocoa, chocolate, vanilla, cola, coffee bean, nut flavors have cut, not overly roasted nor burnt. The black fruits more muted here, particularly as it becomes successively drier from mid-palate through the finish. Here you do get a grassy twinge at the end too. Seems calculated to appeal to those with a sweet tooth while also remaining food friendly and trim, light of step. A good summertime option for those who like Porters."

"Had this one at the source on a past ticking trip to Asheville! Served from tap into a Green Man sampler shaker. Poured a massively dark brown with a one finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount very slowly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, earth, earth hop, dark chocolate, and nutty. The flavor was of sweet malt, earth, dark chocolate, nutty, and peanuts. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a decent brew. My one question on this one is, where did all of this nuttiness come from? Holy moly! It would have been nice if it were only an undertone, but that amount was just a little bit too much to put this one in a good category. It however did not totally ruin the brew, but it definitely would have ranked higher if the nuttiness were toned back slightly."

"Decent porter from ""Beer City USA"". Nothing too out of the ordinary though. it poured an inky black with a dirty brown head. The look was nice, but everything else was just about average. The flavors were all indicative of a porter, the problem was the the flavors simply were not there in abundance. The finish was watery with very subtle smoke, and given the style of beer I really would have appreciated something my palate could marinate on for an extended period of time."
"Overall, this a solid porter and I would love to have it on tap sometime. I love Green Man Brewery in general and have yet to drink one of their beers that I didn't enjoy."
""

"This is a nice, traditional porter. It has solid flavor and good drinkability. I would definitely have this again."

"This one is a winner. The cask certainly added to the experience."

"D: Really easy to drink.  Pretty good balance, typical characteristics, and a bit thin, but enjoyable."
"On Tap. Pours dark brown with an off-white, long lasting head and a good amount of lacing. Aroma is of cacao, brown sugar, toast, nutts and hints of dark fruit. Medium, smooth body. Taste is similar to aroma. Finish is semi-sweet, long lasting. Light, easy drinking porter."
"Went out for a pint with my wife the other night and grabbed one of these to start it off. Came out a thick dark black with a thin tawny head on top. Rich nose with big hits of coffee and chocolate. Lots of roasted goodness. The mouth is weighted perfectly as there is a nice chew to this one. This beer is teeming with a bounty of roasted coffee. There is a ""green"" element to this beer though. Leafy greens noticed in the flavor, with a fresh hop presence. Nice bitter snap at the end. This was a great beer, and one I would gladly have again."

"Appearance similar to most porters, nice med-dark brown head with good retention. Nose nothing to write home about. Once you take a sip, that's where you notice how great of a porter this is- one of the most, if not the most, enjoyable porters to drink I've had. Nice balance of maltiness with some hints of roastiness and chocolate, mouthfeel is spot on. Smooth in all aspects. Great on a crisp autumn day sitting outside!"
"thick dark brown with a large creamy tan colored head on the top. Great retention let it hang around for what seemed like forever before finally being nestled down into just a thin layer across the top. The aroma was very full and sweet. Lots of chocolate roaming through it along with a touch of coffee and lots of sugar. A slight smoked presentation as well. The flavor was also very full for a porter. This almost had a stout like feel to it as it was very thick and full with a great robust profile. Lots of chocolate and coffee notes dominated it."
"Overall, probably average for the style - I think English Porters just are not all that enjoyable for me. It's the odd sour, thin characteristics I dislike every time I have the style."
"On-tap at Jack of the Wood in a shaker pint. Dark brown with thin cream colored head that leaves big splotches of lace. Smell: fruity, caramel, nutty, with a little bittersweet chocolate. Taste: toasted nuts, caramelized sugars, fruity. Clean finish. Decent."
"Overall, this is a good solid porter. A very good representation of the style."
"On my way out of Asheville this month I stopped at the airport bar. I sampled a few beers including the Green Man Porter. The color was light for a porter, bordering on a dark oak. When poured it's head was tan and thin, nose smelled of cocoa and carmel. It is certainly malty (what else would you expect from a porter) a majority of the taste is oatmeal with brown sugar with a very low IBU. A good beer but not exceptional. I personally think it is better than Highland's Oatmeal Porter, due to a difference in hop content or type of hops."
"Mouthfeel could be preceived as a bit thin, but it does border on creamy still. Alcohol non-existent and really drinkable in all seasons."
"On tap at the Brewpub.Poured a near jet black except for a tinge of ruby,a thin off white head atop.Picked up roast and bitter chocolate mainly in the nose,there was a light fruitiness underlying as well.Pretty well rounded flavors going on,somewhat roasty and earthy from the onset,a juicy fruitiness seems to come in late and makes it pretty balanced.A little thin but its a sociable porter,not half bad,I would liked to try on cask."
"D - Solid overall, although I found this porter to be pretty run-of-the-mill in the grand scheme of things."
"I love cask ales. I wish they were more common in my neck of the woods."
"I thought this was a pretty good beer. Pour was somewhat flat with a thin cocoa head that was gone before my eyes. Lighter colored than what I'm used to and almost crystal clear when held to light with a ruby/mahogany color. Smell was very nice with the malts being more sweet with less roasted character than many American Porters I have. Sweet chocolate with hints of caramel, coffee, and a small earthy/grassy hop bite. Mouthfeel was a fairly light and thin. Not necessarily too watery but the body wasn't big enough. Carbonation being extremely low might have played a factor. Still, I find this very drinkable. The stuff went down about as quick as it was poured after I got the point of what I was dealing with. Split this on Thanksgiving with my sister who happened to purchase it from Green Man in Asheville. Nice!"
"Drinkability: Pretty solid! Presents a bit more character than our last encounter."
"Found the beer at Jack of the Wood in Asheville NC. (The taproom at the brewery was closing (who closes at 11:00 on Saturday night?) so this was the closest place to find the beers). The Porter turns out to be quite nice. A flavorful barley aroma and taste give a nice blend of chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, and nuttiness. Lots of sweetness approach caramel levels, but level off just before. The low-lying hop presence lets the beer seem sweeter and maltier than it acually is. No real hop aroma, little flavor, and a balanced bittering. Body is a bit light, but fair for an English Porter. Finishes on a clean fermented, cocoa note. Won't knock your socks off, but certainly quenched my thirst on this summer night."
