The aroma and flavour are pleasant - dominated by roasted grain and fruity malt. Intriguingly the aroma is rather muted. Body is alright. A well-crafted porter but a tad underwhelming. Perhaps this bottle is just too old? I'll try and re-review at some point. Worth sampling if you come across it.","jazzyjeff13","Nov 28, 2013"

4.01,2.8,4,4.25,4,3.5,4,"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights. Hard to tell if it's cloudy, but the beer looks pretty clear in the light. Nice, glowy color. Medium tan head. Lots of fine bubbles. After a few minutes, there's still a decent film of bubbles. I'm getting chocolate maltiness as the primary flavor in the aroma, but it's backed up by a mix of fruit, nutty brown malt, caramel, molasses, light coffee/roast and a hint of wood. There's a lot of malt complexity to this beer. Very nice toasty malt notes. A rather rich aroma for <5% abv. The flavor is a touch weaker for me. The malt complexity is still there, but some of the rich sweetness is gone. It starts out with a fairly simple sweetness before bringing in some nice fruity flavors and takes its time pulling out the chocolate and roast. Good finish with roast, tobacco and earth hops lingering for some time. Mouthfeel is smooth. Drinks big for the abv. British brewers know how to pack flavor into lower abv beers. Sits a bit light on the palate, though. Not the best impersonation of cask mouthfeel for a bottled beer that I've found, but it's always a losing effort and it's still nice. This is an enjoyable porter with lots of rich British malt flavor in a relatively small package. I would love to see more American brewers make a serious effort with this sort of beer.","popery","Apr 03, 2013"

Anyway, it pours a deep clear russet topped by a finger of off-white micro-foam. The nose comprises raisins, wheat, grass, flowers, and graham crackers. The taste is more robust, with notes of light molasses, blackened biscuits, rye bread, dark wheat, grass, and some light figs. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly gooey feel. Overall, a nice bit of English goodness, something to look for again later on.","TMoney2591","Aug 13, 2010"

A softly malty aroma; biscuts, dark fruit and chocolate. The taste is soft and envelopeing, definately better as it warms. The malty body rolls acrossed the toungue hinting, only hinting quickly at so many things, bread pudding, chocolate, oatmeal, but its all gone in a flash of hop bitterness and its something different on the next swallow.

4.39,12.6,3.5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Big head on the pour which swiftly settles down into a half finger froth of large bubbles in the middle with cream nearer the rims, longlasting lacing. Dark chocolate, chocolate mud pie and caramel infused nose with a sweet tobacco smokiness, with time more bitter coffee rind notes appear, mostly canceled out by plum and blackberry fruit scents, gently floral but no real evidence of hoppiness in your nostrils. Medium-bodied, however, the carbonation swirls aggressively through the attack making it initially lighter than that. The roast more focused here, alongside a mineral water aspect and the low alcohol level makes it a refreshing sessionable beer. Dark chocolate powder, caramel, butterscotch and coffee hard candy make it negligibly sweeter than bitter. Fig and golden raisin mix with more plum and cherry fruit flavors, light and bouncy overall. More clarity in the biscuit, golden dough flakes and graham cracker components. Given its relatively light touch coats the tongue nicely and extends its finish without requiring attention.","farrago","Mar 02, 2009"
4.3,10.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"4 M&4.5 D: with good support of micro-scopic fizz, the body is fresh yet smooth enough throughout, but it's not as soft as a milk stout or rich as an oatmeal stout or fullsome porter; it has its own rough edges and that provides some extra enjoyment to this nice dark brew. As anticipated, I fail to discern which malt is which in this beer, simply because the flavour is so harmonious that I couldn't even tell if the claim of "14 malts" is anything but marketing strategy!! A good-quality quaffable porter it is.","wl0307","Feb 27, 2009"
4.15,6.4,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Poured a darkish brown with a two-finger tan head that slowly died and left lacings down the glass. A heavy malt smell in the aroma, a mix of some sweet/sugary malts and dryer malts like coffee, roasted, toasted. There's all kinds of malts in here. A smooth, somewhat creamy and bittersweet beer, the malts from the smell are in here and mixed well. There's chocolate, caramel, toffee, coffee, roasted, toasted, maybe even burnt. There is even some minor hop presence in the backbite with a more of a grapefruit hop taste than citric. The smoothness that the beer passes over the tongue is balanced with a crisp, dry backbite, and I could sit at the bar all day if this was the only beer available.","clayrock81","Feb 25, 2009"

The smell is chocolate, coffee, tobacco, molasses, some berries, and a touch of hop, but not much. The smell does not do the beer justice and is quite subdued. This beer is all about the malty taste. This is a light to medium bodied beer with a very distinctive chocolate, malty, caramel, sweet taste that derives from the dozen or so different malts used to brew this beer. You will get some hints of berry, and toffee as well. The mouthfeel is largely watery with a slight oily feel. The aftertaste is surprisingly light.

The cidery flavor is immediately apparent on tasting -- this beer is tight and acidic, and the cider note has a sour note to it as well. It's not tasty, and there's not a roasted malt flavor or a hop flavor that I'd expect from a porter... at least, an American porter.

Taste is typical for an English porter, malty, some bitter floral hops, along with a hint of that tobacco. Couldn't quite pin down all those malts, but overall this was a tasty little porter.

The flavor is quite a contrast from the aroma. The taste is slightly weaker than I would have expected. Of course the slight burnt coffee from the malts is there along with a touch of sweetness but that seems to be the conclusion of the initial ÂflavorÂ. Initially this hits me as having very little flavor. While holding it on my taste buds for a while the flavors described above begin to bloom. As this one warms a bit the flavors do start to open up a bit. Mouthfeel is probably medium in my opinion and lacks that creaminess many porters exhibit.

There was almost no roasted malt characteristic, but that might be the style. There was some dark fruit present, such as figs and raisins, with maybe the slightest dusting of cocoa powder, but again, it was all too thin and weak to make an impression on me.

Aromas are beautiful with coffee, nutmeg and roasted chocolate malt. Medium bodied offering that tangy quality found in the first cup of coffee of the day. Waves of bitter chocolate come in to play as the crisp, tangy coffee notes subside. Te beer finishes long and memorable. A must try, and my next mate with rib eye.","moulefrite","Nov 04, 2003"
4.2,7.7,4,4,4,4,5,"Deep bister, with brilliant crimson flashes when held to light. Head recedes readily into a spotty, buff layer. Sparse lace trails. Combination of chocolate malt and mellow fruity esters lend a stately impression of lightly sweet, cocoa dusted fig in aroma. Softly woody hops and black patent provide an earthy and carbonaceous contrast, respectively. Pleasant diacetyl surfaces as it breathes. Understated and welcoming aromawise. Brusque wash of roasted grain bitterness initially in flavor yields to balanced, judicious suggestions of light toffee, butterscotch and dry baker's chocolate. Gentle fruity esters of a prune like nature and tracely tart, treacle notes surface mid palate. Expectedly lightly bodied overall considering the gravity, but firmly dextrinous in mouthfeel. Biscuit like malt couples with diacetyl late, facilitating an agreeable cookie dough impression. Protracted finish of smoky black patent hints and cleanly singed, nutty grain. A delightful, well rounded brew, that exhibits a simple balance of roasted grain character, subtle esters and residual sweetness. Soft on the palate and quite flavorful. Exceptionally drinkable.","marc77","Oct 24, 2003"
3.9,0,4,4,4,4,3.5,"Many malts added up to a unique flavor profile. As noted on the bottle, no hopping was evident. Instead, the beer offered up an interesting vinious aspect. Up front mildly roasted coffee flavors with some very mild charcoal, followed by some acidic sourness and sour cherry flavors, almost like an oud bruin. Resolved with a dry finish. Unlike any porter I've had before. Not something I would tag as a session ale, but an interesting diversion.","Brent","Sep 02, 2003"
4.32,10.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Oh yeah it is!! What a big ass body on this one - lots of dark round maltiness, hits of coffee, toffee and cocoa, an oatmeally (like a bitter chocolate haystack no-bake cookie) creaminess and just enough smokiness to tie it together. Some faint latent hoppiness in the finish, just enough to let you know that a hop was tossed in the kettle. The word "rich" keeps coming back into my head again and again. Just a handful of roasted malt shy of a sweet stout IMO. As is, a damned fine porter that will find itself in my pint glass quite often if I have anything to say about it.","sponberg","Aug 29, 2003"
4.2,7.7,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Had this on tap at Redbones. Poured very dark with a nice off white creamy head that left a beautiful lace. The smell was sweet with hints of coffee. The taste was much more powerful. Crisp and clean with notes of coffee, toffee and a little bit of chocolate. The taste intensifies at the end and is very enjoyable. I got a hint of some smoke? Not sure. Overall I enjoyed this a lot! I hope this is still on tap on Friday when I go back.","CharlesRiver","Aug 13, 2003"
3.38,-13.3,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A very black porter allowing no light to shine through. Creamy head settles down to a thin slick oftan foam. Very stout-like in appearance. Has a dry roasted malt like aroma with hints of chocolate. Mouthfeel is not quite full but pretty close to a Guiness. Flavor is malty oats and a dry bitter chocolate. This is nearly a stout in my opinion. Not a great one but not all that bad either.","BierReise","Aug 09, 2003"
3.98,2.1,4,3.5,4,4,4.5,"Surprisingly stout-like for an English porter. Dark and looks black for most part, but closer inspection shows that it's just a really dark brown. A nice roastiness jumps out at you first, a bit thin in the middle and some toffee in the finish. Hops are AWOL (as the label said they would be). Quite the tasty porter. Not on the level of Fuller's London Porter, but still nice.","aracauna","Jul 29, 2003"
3,-23.1,3,3,3,3,3,"Reading other reviews me thinks my bottle might not have been in the best condition it could have been in. It poured a dark brown. I found it to be rather light bodied with aromas and flavors of coffee, though I found everything quite subdued and not very interesting. I may try this again, but I am not in any rush.","jreitman","Jul 12, 2003"
3.49,-10.5,5,3.5,3,3.5,4,"When poured into my glass, this beer had a very small head that quickly diminished. There was no lacing present on the sides of my glass. The hue of this beer is black. The nose is roasted coffee and chocolate. The flavor is strong roasted coffee from start to finish. The mouthfeel is smooth, thin and somewhat watery.","hotstuff","Jul 09, 2003"
2.51,-35.6,3.5,2.5,2.5,2,2.5,"Body and mouthfeel were thin and watery, hardly the characteristics of the delicious Baltic style porters I am used to. Mild flavors of chocolate and coffee were discernible; had an astringent alcohol finish that did not fit at all. Again, hopefully this went bad, and I would like to say I would try it again, but for the price, I don't think it's worth the risk.","IrishRedRock","May 23, 2003"
3.97,1.8,4,4.5,3.5,4.5,4,"Not surprisingly a ton of malt on the palate, with just a touch of wineyness. Again the chocolate and coffee notes dominate. Its quite light on the palate, and not very long. Quaffable, but ultimately a bit too malt-centric to be really interesting.","Realale","May 16, 2003"

4.35,11.5,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Carefully poured it's a clear, deep mahogany with ruby highlights. The short but creamy off-white head drops shortly but maintains a creamy collar and a whispy surface coating throughout the glass. It leaves some lace, but it's thin and spotty. The nose is cocoa-ish, lightly fruity (berries), and coffee-ish/chocolatey with a mild smoky roastiness. If you search a little further some hoppiness is present - floral and mildly grassy like Goldings. The body is light with a very fine carbonation that leaves it exquisitely smooth and lightly creamy in the mouth. The flavor displays a plum-like fruitiness up-front with emerging notes of gently sweet chocolate. Some more berry-like fruit appears as it warms, along with notes of toffee. It's well balanced with a supportive bitterness. It finishes dry with a nutty caramel flavor that dissolves into lingering roasted dryness and gentle bitterness. This is, without question, best enjoyed at cellar temperature although the change in character as it warms is interesting. Very nicely done and well worth trying.","NeroFiddled","Jan 28, 2003"
3.83,-1.8,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Slightly over carbonated, bottle conditioned, 3" high brownish rocky head over a clear, deep ruby color when back lit. Aromas of toffee and charred wood, a bit musty at first- oxidation odors fade quickly. Light in body with some hard water astringency, but big in dark grain nuttyness and chocolate malt richness giving way to grassy resinous hop flavors and lingering bitter finish. This bottle was a little past prime but still a great example of a traditional Porter.","Shiredave","Nov 03, 2002"
4.48,14.9,5,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Who knew something with the word "butt" in it could taste so good. The hint of coffee and caramel almost make you think you bought one of those fancy iced coffee drinks, except this makes you drunk! Foamy goodness.","Dogbrick","Jun 20, 2002"
4.03,3.3,4.5,4,4,4,4,"This beer has a wonderful dark color and nice decent dark tan head.  It says it's a blend as traditional porters once were, which may account for dryer taste that I prefer.  The taste suffers a little unfortunately because I find the body to be lighter than other porters I have tried.  Still a great beer.","Wildman","May 30, 2002"
3.73,-4.4,3.5,3,4,4,4,"Pretty good porter.  Very dark reddish brown.  Initially pours to thick, tan-colored head.  Caramel aroma, with a hint of coffee.  Taste full of roasted malt, a bit of chocolate, maybe some caramel and coffee on the edges.  Finishes a little bitter.  Very creamy and smooth.  I think I'll try another with breakfast this weekend.","Viking","Apr 23, 2002"
4.4,12.8,4,4,4.5,5,4.5,"(6 months past bb date)--The head is initially large, frothy, a off-white or light tan in color, but dies quickly. Body is dark brown, bottle conditioned. Aroma is really malty, mostly dark chocolate. The flavor is lightly sweet, moderately bitter. Medium body, extra smooth creamy texture in the mouth feel (excellent), soft carbonation. Overall very enjoyable, you need to let it warm a bit and more and more of the complex malt flavors come out.","WilliamPhilaPa","Mar 29, 2002"
4.12,5.6,4,4.5,4,5,3.5,"Dark coffee color, big creamy head with medium/small bubbles...toasted bread aroma, nice...Flavors are bitter and coffee-like, slight prune, not overly chocolate.  Medium bodied, flavor stays largely the same on the tongue to the back of the mouth.  Made with 14 different malts to simulate the old days when ales of various tastes (and freshness) were mixed.  Low hops, just a touch more sweetness would be good to me.","ADR","Mar 20, 2002"
3.3,-15.4,3,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Here's 500ml of good porter, good carbonation, some hops.  Very dark and chewy.  Pricey - $3.99 but not easy to find in NH - bought in MA.","jdhilt","Mar 05, 2002"

4.8,23.1,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,5,"This bottle conditioned butt beer was brewed with 14 malts! Pale marris otter, lager, wheat, pale crystal, dark crystal, dark chocolate, pale chocolate, black, roasted barley, cara malt, torrified wheat, amber, brown and malted oats. This is Salopian's attempt to recreate the forgotten traditional Porter style. I think they did I marvelous job, in humble opinion. Silver Medal @ the GBBF 1999 BCA's.","Todd","Feb 22, 2001"
