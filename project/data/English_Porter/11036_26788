It tastes of the black morning coffee of a salaryman, the bread of a factory worker's lunch, and even a few notes of a caramel or vanilla like the manager might sneak at the end of the day. All in all the proletariat (as well as Foothills) should be proud to call this their beer. It's one of the more drinkable porters I have found due to its pleasant balance of flavors and (relatively speaking for a porter) low gravity. It is especially good for finishing off a six pack by yourself while watching football, avoiding your extended family, and waiting for day-before-Thanksgiving dinner to be made.","MaddestHatter","Apr 23, 2014"

The aroma is a malt-lovers dream with big roasted notes of coffee and hints of chocolate. The aroma is similar but includes some mild earthy hops on the finish.

3.76,-2.3,3.75,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,"The beer pours a nice dark brown to light black with a soft tan head of tiny, soft bubbles. The head leaves a lacing of slippery spittle droplets on the sides of the glass. The body is indecipherable in its darkness but shows some light molasses-like colors on its edges that seem clean of particles. On the nose, the beer smells of light, roasted coffee with a kiss of mocha and dark chocolate. Milk chocolate also briefly touches the nose. On the tongue, the beer tastes of bitter roast with a kiss of hops. Sweetness is also prevalent from the malts, though subdued, and more chocolaty than sugary. In flavor, the beer begins as warm roasted chocolate which blossoms into roasted coffee, moving from light roast to dark roast and filling the mouth with a nice, bitter roasted flavor with slight hints of raisins and dark fruit in among the roast. The finish carries a slight flavor of ice and metal, oddly enough, with a dying bitter roasted coffee flavor that hints at chocolate and some slight earthiness that balances out the flavor. The aftertaste is of lingering bitter roasted coffee and char. In the mouth, the beer feels medium in body, and perhaps even lighter, though the beer does carry a little heaviness in the swallow. Carbonation is soft and almost fluffy on the mouth, and the mouth is left roasted dry. Overall, this is a pretty classic American porter. There is nothing fancy about it, but it’s tasty. It has its chocolate, it has its bitters, and it has its roasted coffee flavors. A nice porter for when you want something simple.","Maxwell","Jun 12, 2013"

There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

For those who aren’t into dark beers, this may not be a good intro, but for those who are, this is definitely a tasty, accessible, and very affordable option.","fmccormi","Mar 19, 2013"

Almost stout looking. Smell was very woody and earthy. Burnt notes, perhaps some figs and carmel. Taste is very similar, but getting a lot of the wood characteristics on the front end. A bit of coffee, earth/dirt and carmel. Complex and busy. Again, a bit like a stout. Feel is rich and creamy with a good bit of carbonation and life. Medium to thick on the tongue. Overall- An interesting porter. I enjoyed the complex taste and limited hop profile. The wood/earth taste was a bit powerful. A strong porter IMO and bordering on a RIS. I like the creativity and blend of flavors. Not a bad brew at all and I'd hit another. It's more of a sipper. Worth a try-","TheDinger","Oct 08, 2012"

4,3.9,4,4,4,4,4,"People's Porter pours black, with just the faintest bit of ruby red highlights. Three fingers of khaki colored foam rise up atop the beer and stick around for a minute or two. There's a bit of lacing left along the glass, but not necessarily a ton. The nose has lots of caramel and a smooth chocolate aroma. The flavor's got a good bit of roast going on, though it's trending more towards coffee than chocolate here. A healthy dollop of caramel rounds out the malt profile. There's a light bitterness, and distinct earthy/herbal hop finish that's almost too intense at times for a relatively malt driven the style. The body is nice and firm, giving solid support to the malts, and the carbonation is just enough to cut through the sweetness and let the hops have their say. People's Porter is my first beer from Foothills, and I'm really enjoying it. I almost want to say it's too hoppy for its own good, but that's not quite the case.","axeman9182","Jul 13, 2012"

3.63,-5.7,4.5,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Medium bodied but a bit thinner than expected with a good balance of roasted, sweet and bitter flavors. There's a decent amount of roasted malt that gives off a subtle smoke character but it never feels burnt or overpowering. Hints of bitter dark chocolate, toast, caramel and oatmeal dominate the flavor before finishing with a lingering hop bitterness. Surprisingly hoppy for the style with more dry bitterness than I prefer. This element takes away from the more pleasant malt flavors and unfortunately begins to dominate things as I work my way through the bottle.","corby112","Jan 19, 2012"
4.15,7.8,4.5,4.5,4,3,4.5,"Rich aroma has burnt wood, unsweet chocolate and quality coffee notes with undertones of molasses and licorice. Got my mouth watering! It pours an opaque dark-chocolate brown with a thick, fluffy and rather persistent light tan head. Delicious flavor lives up to the aroma, having roast coffee, chocolate, molasses and licorice tones plus a hint of caramel and a bitter hoppy undertone that actually helps round out the flavor rather than detract from it. Texture is the beer's weakest point - body is on the thin side, it seems, for a porter, and there is just a little fizz.","Cyberkedi","Jan 18, 2012"

4.2,9.1,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Just stopped in for a growler fill from the source on the way down to Myrtle Beach, not overly impressed. Quality across the board was lacking, one beer like Sexual Chocolate shouldn't really make you a BA destination. The beers were acceptable just not stellar, I would like to try the SC imperial stout if the chance comes my way. This one appears pitch black with large tan head with a mocha brown tint forms a nice cloud rising above the rim of my Foothilss pint glass. Aromatics offer roasted malts with dark coffee accents and a hint of dark chocolate. Alot of black patent malt more dark cocoa and roastiness than sweet and creamy. Flavor does have a mild lactic twang to it but more robust roasts come to play with herbal hop background peeking through, a touch of dark chocolate and mild coffee. Finishs dry with those herbal hops and dark roasts in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium to fuller bodied and carbonation was on overall I can't say anything bad about this brew, I thought it was the best of their lineups smaller beers and my wife loved it I had a glass and a half the rest my wife took care of on vacation.","WVbeergeek","Beers"

Poured into my nonic pint glass and appears a rather dark, but still translucent rich chestnut color with about a finger of creamy ecru foam. A thin, sporadic lace is left by the head as my glass slowly empties. Nose consists of medium roasted grains, sweet milk chocolate, cocoa, and earthy hops. Very nice! Flavor brings chocolate egg cream sodas to mind as well as toasted and caramelized malts and grains, mild chocolate and coffee notes. A few notches better than medium bodied with ample carbonation for the style. A highly drinkable porter. Glad I had the chance to try it. Most definitely a porter for the people.","ClockworkOrange","Mar 19, 2009"

3.6,-6.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Pors out a dark brown, not quite black color with ruby highlights. The head is loose and tan colored, and it sort of fades fast, leaving a little lacing. The smell at first is of crisp carbonation, with a whiff of powdery, sweet malts, with a tiny hint of roasted barley/coffee in the background. About normal, but not as deep as I'd like. The taste is nice, a little raw, but nice. There's a dry caramelly maltiness, backed with big roast barley/coffee notes. I can also sense a bit of a hoppy flavor in here, which is interesting. There's a bit of a chocolate flavor, but its dry enough that its hard to notice. There isn't as much depth as I'd like, but I think its the dryness (a quality I've noticed as common in Foothills' dark beers). Just needs a bit more in residual sugars. There's just enough sweetness that it doesn't ruin the whole thing, but there isn't enough sweetness to really make it great. It's like a battle that neither side is winning. The carbonation is a bit prickly, but this one is about as full as I'd expect, but your mouth feels, well, I think it goes without saying. It's really easy to drink though, and not too high in ABV. The drink is enjoyable, but not stellar.","taylorhamrick","Feb 08, 2009"
