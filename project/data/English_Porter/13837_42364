3.86,2.9,3.25,4,4,3.5,3.75,"Pours dark red-brown, almost black.  Only intense light permeates.  Extremely short-lived creamy-tan head.  Aroma is entirely malty.  Tastes much more like a hearty nut brown ale than other porters I've had.  Lacks the bitterness usually associated with porters and stouts (light bitterness usually achieved with coffee or cocoa nibs.)  Hop flavors almost absent.  Carbonation is mild, making for mellow sipping.  Very enjoyable.","HawbakerBrewery","Feb 20, 2015"

The beer poured a nice almost opaque dark with decent head that left some lacing. The scent carried some earth and roasty tones. The taste was similar to watered coffee. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with subtle carbonation. Overall not one of my favorite porters, but for those who like a lighter porter....this might be for you.","WoodBrew","Jul 31, 2013"

It might not be immediately approachable, but this is a dark beer that's got good flavor without really packing a wallop or "being too thick". It's an easy-drinking porter that would fit right in with the English session ales; a few at your favorite pub wouldn't be a bad start to the night!","BeerFMAndy","Mar 31, 2013"

Dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light. Aromas of rich malt, chocolate, toasted without being burnt at all. Very nice aroma. Upfront taste is nice, chocolately malt with a silky mouthfeel. However this is a bit shortlived as the end note is slightly carbonic and lacks a malty full-bodied finish. Easy to drink with decent flavor. A solid sessionable english style porter that lacks depth but makes up for it in drinkability.","deebo","Mar 05, 2013"

Real nice nose on this porter, making a statement with it's English qualities. Bready, nutty, chocolatey, and sweet caramel here. Big aroma in comparison to the taste though, that came up a bit short for me. Bready & chocolate forward with a carbonation bite in the aftertaste.

Light chocolate and roast in the nose without much else, maybe a light hop note in the middle of the bready base. Smooth is the selling point on the bottle and the website description, and it is very smooth with little to stop it from going dryly off the back of the tongue quickly. Roast is light and lingers a bit on the tongue, but the thin body detracts from the overall taste. While a decent porter, it lacks enough depth to keep me interested beyond a bottle or two. Had the same beer on tap recently and it seemed to have a bit more too it then for some reason.","FightingEntropy","Jun 08, 2011"
4,6.7,4,4,4,4,4,"Aroma is of coffee and molasses. Taste is similarly rich, with just the edge of bitterness and a light fizzyness. Molasses flavor dominates, but there's chocolate too. Not nutty or roasty, but faintly sweet... with no gross aftertaste. Mouthfeel is appropriately thin and not overcarbonated. A real classic porter. A solid and consistent A-/B+!","hreb","Apr 07, 2011"

The taste had alot of coffee flavors, but was also heavy and malty, a bit of a carmel flavor as well, but the coffee flavors stood out the most. Nice full flavor, espically for a porter. Overall a found it a good beer, and a really good porter.","vette2006c5r","Aug 23, 2010"

The aroma is some coffee, a little cinnamon, some roasty malt, some candy sweetness, a mild hoppiness, and something odd I can't quite put my finger on. The flavor is much like a delicious coffee drink with some mild sweetness, some fruitiness, a nice bitter hoppiness, with a good creamy character.","BieresDesMoines","Beers"

3.5,-6.7,4,4,3.5,3,3,"Poured into a pint glass this brew has an oil like black color with a thin body and a bubbly (not creamy) light brown head that left moderate lacing. The aroma was of sweet caramel, subtle chocolate, and burnt malts. The taste was overly carbonated upfront, astringent to the tongue, and full of the burnt malt flavor. There was not much to come out from under the deep dark malt taste. Some slight notes of coffee and chocolate, but difficult to get to behind the heaviness of the roast. This was a little thin for the style. Not the best I have had, but worth a try.","WJVII","Dec 15, 2009"

Some minor notes of vanilla and charred wood. Grainy bitterness up front. Chocolate and peaty malt sweetness follows. Slight notes of coffee and oily, woody fruit. Moderate body with a lively feel. Not bad.","alexgash","Nov 29, 2009"

3.88,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Enjoyed on tap at Ale Asylum in Madison, WI. Pours a black body with a tan head that lasts. Aroma of dark roasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a low carbonation. The main flavor is sweet roasted malts with a very low bitterness in the finish. Very good drinkability.","blackearth","Nov 10, 2009"

2.8,-25.3,4,4,2.5,2,2,"Taste, unfortunately, does not live up to expectations. The first note is bitterness, which the chocolate coming up next, followed up by heavily-roasted malt, and ending with more bitterness. A lot of fizz on the tongue as well. I wouldn't want to have many of these in succession... I might have another beer, but it would be ANOTHER beer. I generally like my porters sweeter and more full-bodied than this one - not recommended.","MadTown1000","May 19, 2009"
3.87,3.2,3.5,4,4,4,3.5,"Very nice English Style Porter. the chunk of flaked malt floating in the beer were attractive to my eye, but may turn some off. Drinkability suffers as this beer felt a little heavy for a session, which is what a Porter was meant to be.","wheatyweiss","Apr 13, 2009"

4.12,9.9,4,4.5,4,4,4,"pretty good beer; one of their best, I think. Poured with a tan head and some lace. Opaque dark blackish brown. Nice roasty malty nose with a little dark ripe fruit, cocoa, coffee, a hint of vanilla and chocolate. Flavor is very similar and yet fairly dry. In spite of the richness it's fairly drinkable. But at the same time very full flavored so other flavors in my mouth clashed a bit. Nice finish with no off flavors. Not too boozy. Label reminds me of Thailand.","drpimento","Jan 09, 2009"

The nose is full of rich chocolate, english toffee, coffee bean and caramel. Flavor comes at you with dry cocoa powder and muddled and muddied fudge tones. Some nuttiness accents. Slight roasted malt character. And a chalky aftertaste. Solid and unique in the flavor department. Medium body. Good drinker.","Bighuge","0"
