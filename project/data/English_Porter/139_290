A very solid drinker, great mouthfeel and perfect carbonation. One of shipyards best offerings. Too bad they don't distribute more. Could be a huge 6 pack seller for them.

4.07,5.4,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"Enjoyed this cask ale at the Sea Dog Brewpub in South Portland, Maine. It was a very dark brown black color with a goodly tan, big bubbled head and modest signs of lace. The aroma says flowery fruit nougat and juniper malt and brown bread. Very interesting. The flavor brings a bit of what the nose detected but with more of the sweet coffee and light charcoal bitterness. The body is near medium with a pretty low carbonation aqueous feel. It’s got plenty of character, a little grassy hop edge. Medium drinkability and a very nice cask offering.","Durge","Jun 02, 2011"
4.12,6.7,4,4.5,4,4,4,"Lots of notes of chocolate, almost completely dominated by it to be honest.

Some nice roasted malts, a touch of smoke maybe, and definitely a hint of vanilla.Full on chocolate malt assault as the first wave of flavor came over my tongue.

Take Longfellow, for example. Its thin, fizzy body and citrusy tang veer more toward mild IPA territory than porter: its lack of density and depth qualify it as a summer beer, not winter, in my book. I searched hard for some kind of aroma, even after letting it get quite warm, but couldn't find anything beyond wet ropes (is that the shipyard in Shipyard?) and Coke. And the burned-lemon, burlappy aftertaste is... well, I don't know what it is (aside from icky), but it doesn't help things. Call it an ill-conceived black APA/IPA or an overcooked weak amber, but don't call it a porter. To the kitchen sink!","gfreed","Feb 10, 2011"

The first smell of this brew is distinctively English as it smells like the taps at your local Pub. Warming a tad bit one detects spices with hints of brown sugar and arid yet sweet hops. The brew pours to a very dark root beer brown which when held up the the light, lets it through, but just barely. The head generated by the pour is tremendous and looks like a bowl of porridge. Upon tasting this brew is a cornucopia of flavors. It has hints of toffee, a tad bit of cinnamon, a good brown sugar malt base and a kick of molasses. Hopping is evident throughout giving a nice bitterness behind the various sweet malt flavors. The mouthfeel is good with good body and carbonation to zest up but not overdo the flavor of the brew. This is good brew for a chilly night to be dranken just below room temperature.","mooseisloose","Jan 14, 2010"
4.23,9.6,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Some good winter spices of nutmeg, coriander, and anise, with a porter-like feel and consistency. The maltiness is strong.

3.67,-4.9,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"2008 vintage courtesy of the belgianator. Poured cola brown with the merest skim of a head. Nose was cocoa, molasses and prunes. Taste was muted, pruney, bready and malty, with a slight cocoa quality that comes out in the back. Mouthfeel was medium-light with a pleasant background carbonation. I liked this beer, but didn't love it. I found the nose to be somewhat inconsistent with the flavor profile; however, worth a try.","Jwale73","Nov 23, 2009"
3.88,0.5,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D - Quite drinkable with a good combination of malt and spice complexity. This is the best beer I have had from shipyard, though it doesn't take all that much to beat their usual fare.","nickfl","Aug 07, 2009"
3.65,-5.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Poured a dark, seethru brownish hue with a small white head that sitcks around forever. Dry, roasted malt smell with hints of sweet malts and some floral hops. A dry, sticky beer that goes down easy thanks to a medium-body that has a good amount of roasted malts in it. Caramel and dark chocolate also make an appearance, as do some the hops thanks to a little hop bitterness on the backbite. ABV slightly noticeable, especially when you let it warm, as it gives it an even dryer finish.","clayrock81","Jun 01, 2009"
3.6,-6.7,4,4,3.5,3,3.5,"Creamy tan head, deep brown/blackish colour, lacing. Aroma is fruity, roasted, chocolate, coffee. Flavour is malty, roasted, coffee, light bitterness in the aftertaste. Flavour is actually a bit watery and the mouthfeel is neither good or bad it's only average. This beer looked very promising, smellt the same but the flavour and mouthfeel was very disappointing to me. But it could be worse it is still worth having a go at.","linnet","Feb 21, 2009"
4.33,12.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Ahh...I definitely liked this one a bunch! A good winter ale without the hyped-up spices found in abundance with some. A nice dark brown, near black pour with ruby-red edges of light, and a good burnt beige 2 finger head that settled to 1. Nice clinging stick lace and an aroma of lemon-malt with nuts & chocolate. The flavor is a rich malt with hints of said dark chocolate and lemon, leaving a mild smoke in the tip of the nose at the end. Crisp and slightly bitter with smooth malt flavor, this is a highly drinkable porter-style ale.","selecter70","Feb 11, 2009"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"The taste is somewhat indicative of the nose on the beer. In addition to the chocolate, toffee, caramel malts, there is a slight smokiness to the beer once it settles a bit. There is definitely some scotch type ale in this beer, but it has to settle way down before some of the finer background qualities emerge. There is a buttery taste to the beer, but on the whole, the hop character adds a nice bite and sharpness to the beer, that takes away any creaminess that may have been present. As the beer settles, the sharpness segues slightly into the more smokey scotch ale character. The beer is decently carbonated, not flat or syrupy, with a slightly charred malt and dark chocolate aftertaste.","albern","Jan 02, 2009"

Taste is also a nice mix between some roasted malt with distinctive notes of caramel malt with some toffee notes also discernable. Full body with good carbonation and no discernable alcohol.

The hops are mild and in the background. the lower carbonation in this beer kind of lets the malts take it in the mouthfeel department... but still goes down pretty smoothly and I'd say it's a nice drinkable porter. thanks for the beer there weswes.","almychristopher","Jun 14, 2008"

It has a nice malty scent that boasts of roasted and crystal mlats along with a fruity Ringwood yeast aroma. The taste is good as well. It has a sweet caramel malt feel in the beginning followed by a dry roasted malt finish. The yeast gives it a slightly fruity character and although the finish is dry there is quite a bit of residual sweetness. The mouthfeel is fine.

Its got a rather complex taste actually, kind of like one taste melding into another with a bitter finish. I am pretty impressed by this one.

I poured this into a pint glass and it came out a brown liquid with a small foamy tan/brown head. Not a spectacular looking beer, but smells of some toffee & butterscotch. Tastes not like a typical porter, but it has the coffee tones to it and is slightly sweet. Aftertaste has some bitter hints and seems thinner than the average porter as well. Goes down ok and doesn't disappoint. Shipyard seems to be putting out some good products.","beeroclock","Jan 23, 2007"

4,3.6,4,4,4,4,4,"It poured with a dark brown, almost tar-like color, and with two fingers of thick, good foam. It was looking very inviting. The smell was of toffee, roasted malts and strong coffee notes. The taste was ""bittersweet"" with lots of coffee and some chocolate too. Inside is a fruitiness of maybe oranges, at least some citrus. All and all a well-balance beer and a fine porter.","JanM","Dec 06, 2006"
3.91,1.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"22 oz bomber from Florian's... Murky dark brown body with ruby-red highlights and a light tan head that's 2 fingers deep. Roastiness and hop bitterness dominate the aroma. Roasty chocolate and hops charactirize the flavor. Caramel in the finish and aftertaste.Tastes like a porter, almost like a stout. on the lighter side of full-bodied. This is definitely the best Shipyard brew, as the ratings reflect, unlike any other Shipyard (except the Brewer's Choice Ale). Good stuff.","MrHurmateeowish","Dec 01, 2006"

3.43,-11.1,3.5,3,3.5,3,4,"It pours a dark cola color with a decent sized head that dispels slowly. The visible carbonation on the sides of the glass continues to remind me of a cola. The smell of the last one I had (that I am using to review) is fainter than the other two I had, but it has a slightly sweet smell which continues with the taste. Tastes and smells like a porter and is quite smooth. I also enjoyed the aftertaste which I find difficult to describe. I would consider the drinkability quite good and would have another Longfellow","shaebs99","Oct 09, 2006"

This eventually peters out, but is nice while it lasts. Smooth with mild carbonation. Thin to medium body. Tasty but lacks depth and body. Pretty accurate to style, mellow, definitely sessionable, but this could use some more oomph.","akahn","Mar 05, 2006"

The taste is very good with a strong presence of coffee and especially malt roastyness and sweetness. The m/f is medium with aftertaste that is just abit too watery and weak. Overall, this is a damn good beer and if the aroma was stronger this could be a rated much higher.","jmz62565","Feb 16, 2006"
3.53,-8.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Pours very dark, not quite black, ruby around the edges from a twelve ounce brown bottle. I can smell hops and malt. At first I taste the malt, which fades into hops.

Soon faded to nothing but the circle of bubbles caused by the scoring at the bottom of my Petrus Triple snifter. The nose is heavy on the apple peels. Caramel, apples and assorted fruits are dominate in the flavor, but there's a lurking char flavor that stirs things up a bit.

3.91,1.3,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Longfellow came in a 22oz bomber with a picture of the grisly old poet on the front. Very dark in color, almost black but with brownish edges. The head was a medium size with medium retention. The aroma consisted of sweet, roasty malts with a fruity quality to it, like apples or pears, and hints of chocolate and coffee as well. The taste was built on a roasted coffee and chocolate base, nice and creamy, and then finished with just a tiny hop bite to balance it out. Mouthfeel was full bodied and lightly carbonated, coating the palate nicely and providing a smooth and rich feel. My favorite so far from Shipyard, although the Prelude awaits me in the fridge, so this may change :)","nixhecks","Oct 27, 2003"

3.66,-5.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,"Black, opaque in the middle with reddish highlights around the edges, massive long-lasting brunette head, bulky lace. Pleasant malty, chocolate, slightly fruity-alcoholic nose of modest strength. Decent palate, dry chocolate, chalky; the malt seems thin and not very sweet either, the alcohol influence is minimal. The flavors all seem a little empty. The body is medium-light, the carbonation is moderate the finish is dull and empty. As the beer warmed nothing improved... aside from a few stray notes of fruitiness on the palate. This did not taste like a Strong Ale/Barely Wine at all; it seemed very much like a Dry Stout. I guess my tastebuds did not concur with my fellow BAs on this one? Either way, a big thank you is in order for StevieW for the bomber, it was a solid brew.","bditty187","May 17, 2003"

4.5,16.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Pours a hazy brown body with a light reddish cast and deep mahogany highlights. It's two-fingered, frothy, light-tan head slowly drops to a quarter-inch of creamy surface covering amongst some very nice lace. A pleasing nose expresses caramel, toffee, mild butterscotch, and a berry-like/apple fruitiness. The body is firm with a fine, moderate carbonation that gently caresses the tongue before becoming creamy and smooth across the palate. In the mouth, rich notes of caramelized sugar and butterscotch are tempered by a mild chocolate character and roasty edge. Some almost-tropical fruitiness appears at the outset, and then again midway through the mouth after the sweetness and buttery notes have passed, but gives way to a drying roasty cusp and bold (but balanced) bitterness. Some alcohol is clearly present, but it works well within the blanket of malt and seems more warming/comforting than intrusive. It finishes dry with some mild lingering caramel and bitterness. This is an exceptionally well-rounded winter beer that seems to straddle several styles and I love it for it's individuality and uniqueness. It has the unobtrusive bitterness and buttery diacetyl note of a brown ale; the fuller chocolatey/caramel note of a porter; and the rich maltiness of a Scotch ale. It's not so strong or full, however, that it needs to be set aside as an after-dinner drink; and it's surely a winter gem that could grace any festive table. Well worth trying!","NeroFiddled","Mar 25, 2003"

Poured very dark brown in color with a tan head that lasted. The taste was sweet all the way with hints of coffee, toffee, caramel and malt. The smell was similar to the taste but more sweet than malty. The aftertaste was more coffee, a hint of hops and a great warming feeling. You have to love the cask offerings at the Coat of Arms.","CharlesRiver","Jan 19, 2003"
