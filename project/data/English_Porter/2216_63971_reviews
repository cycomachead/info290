"O- Nothing special. Lots of better porters out there than this. The lambic yeast does add a bit of a twist, but not enough for it to differentiate itself."
"Black pour into my SAPP with big khaki head; viscous lacing. There is a funky, sour nose here. Taste is semi sweet prunes with a malty finish-and yet slightly tart for a porter. Lite mouth feel and good carbonation. Tasty tart finish!"

"O - Coffee forward with surprisingly little sourness / acidity in the flavor profile based on what comes through in the nose."
""
"Not a bad beer. Not a repeat either."
""
""
""
""
"more towards the Lambic side than the Porter."
""
""
""
"I wonder if any English brewers bottle funky porters?"

"A great belgian sour beer with a unique darkness. I enjoyed this beer in Churchkey in DC both on tap and in the bottle. On tap it was a bit bland and flat, but was substantially more flavorful and even more sour in the bottle."

"O: This is an extremely unique brew. As mentioned before, I am a big fan of sours and porters. However, I prefer the sourness/tartness in very pale or red (flanders) beers. I would definitely have this again because of its uniqueness, and I don't dislike it by any means. But I think I might prefer either Porters or Sours, not both mixed up. (3.75)"

"the sour quality definitely comes thru here, and it is an interesting addition to a porter flavor profile.  on the fruitier side of porters, dark sour berry comes out.  a bit ashey, abundant carbonation.  overall its a unique spin on a porter.  lot of yeast qualities"
""

"(4.0) D: This is very good. Not something I would purchase again at the price paid but glad I tried it."

"O-Interesng. The wild yeast works with the Porter during some sips, then during others it becomes a bit perplexing. Happy to find is one though."

"O: Well, this smelled good. The flavors, though, were simple and bare - nothing offensive but not deep. But the mouthfeel was the biggest letdown - way too thin. Maybe not quite watery, but borderline. Not at all what I expect from a porter. It wasn't a drain pour or anything, but I won't be having another. Quite disappointing from this brewery."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very interesting beer, and I enjoyed it, but it’s probably something wouldn’t seek out again. The flavors of the porter are light and clean, and the lambic yeast adds an interesting complexity. Overall though, it’s pretty straight forward."

"O: porter fans oughtta check it out, but be braced for the wild ale tartness - it isn't overwhelming or anything, but it was omnipresent in my drink. Wild ale fans, 'specially if you like Midnight Brett or other black/dark ale-sour/wild hybrids - oughtta check it out, too. I'm neither a big porter nor wild ale drinker, but this was one of those beers that kinda defied style boundaries, and taken as a singular entity/entry into the world of beer, it was quite good. The porter base was very mellow and supportive, while the yeasts kept every sip very alive and bright with a dusky tartness."
"O - Very good example of an English Porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"So this is a porter with wild yeast? Looks like a porter. Tastes like a sour porter. Or as some obnoxious jackass I recently had the distinct pleasure of crossing paths with, since it's using wild yeasts, it's infected! Mildly sour thing, really. Nothing too crazy. A pleasant drinker, but nothing overly memorable. I'm always open to trying something from this brewery, but wouldn't return to this one I think."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall its certainly a tasty beer I was glad I could pickup. The lambic yeast is a very interesting dimension of this porter which makes the chocolate and cherry notes excel and adds a pleasant dryness."
""
"O - Interesting beer, but not one that I am going to be looking for again. Would I have it again if presented to me...sure, but I wouldn't seek it out. Odd blend of styles/flavors that just doesn't suit my taste buds incredibly well. Glad to try it, but didn't blow me away."
"O: This beer is easier to drink but seems like it could have stronger flavors compared to other beers in the style."
""
""
""
""
"Prost!"
""
""
""
"I'm not a huge fan of the English porter style but this is a decent offering that really grows on you over time. Worth trying as kind of the ugly stepchild of the 3F lineup."

"Pours a hazy very dark brown with two fingers thick of dense light brown foam. Sheet of delicate lace halfway down the glass. Smell: toasted brown bread, black cherries, toffee, mild earthiness. Taste: brown sugar, raisin toast, cola, cherry, not quite tart -- grain twang. Medium bodied, very fine, creamy carbonation."
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm really digging this beer. It serves as a great example that a beer doesn't have to be over the top and in your face to be great. 3 Fonteinen's lambics are awesome and deserving of the praise they get, but this one is worth seeking out as well."

"a beer that is very different, a wild or sour porter, with all the funk of good lambic, but a dark malt base that shows some dried cherry in its pucker, as well as some strong earthy almost composting flavors and aromas. light brown in color, well, medium brown, but not as deep and dark as normal porter, without a ton of head, shorty lived rather, patchy and off white. it smells like dried red fruits and lambic, i don't get the darkness of the black malt until the flavor, and the finish at that. its dark and earthy, not a ton of bitterness from the roast, but subtle dark chocolate notes come in, which don't really jive all the way with the acid in the finish, but which brings out the best of the dried cherry flavor and a little of its sweetness. well carbonated and dry on the mouth, very light in feel for a porter. I'm not sure this beer is totally successful, but it is unique, so credit it for that. sort of lost in the middle, not quite a sour, not quite a dark ale, it gets caught out in no mans land a bit, but i like it anyway."
""
"O-This beer is an odd one. I enjoyed the aroma, which was complex and interesting. The taste, however, falls a little short. The lightly tart fruit flavors are an odd mix with the more roasted/cocoa malt flavors...it tastes a little disjointed. I also think the body is a bit thin thanks to the higher levels of carbonation. Interesting, for sure, but probably not something I need to try again."
"Poured into a Reuben's Brew snifter. Pours pitch black, opaque in the glass with a nice two finger light brown head with great retention and thick lacing. Aroma of toasted malt, Belgian yeast, cinnamon, light sweet and sour dark fruit; porter meets Belgain double. Flavor starts with semi-sweet toasted malt, Belgian yeast, hints of cocoa, then quickly develops a more sour dark malt, finishing tart and somewhat vinous with a light metallic flavor. Medium bodied with fresh active carbonation. An interesting and unusually flavored dark malt beer, smelling and beginning like a porter, but quickly showing its wild yeast and light Belgian character. In a blind taste, I might suspect a compromised porter or stout, except in this case the finishing sourness is intentional. Taken from that perspective, an interesting and well made dark ale that works well. I'm not expecting the the tart finish and this style does not appeal to me as much as a traditional porter. Sour fans who also enjoy dark malt should take this for a spin. Interesting but not my style."

"The bottle shop got this in yesterday and I couldn't resist a try. Claims to be unusual. It is. Pours black with a thick tan head that leaves a coating of lacing down the glass, much like a Guinness Draught. The aroma contains chocolate, sweet malt, faint fruits and sourness. Similar taste with some bright fruitiness, a building, sour lactic backbone and a long bitter sour raisiny finish. The sourness is mild. The mouthfeel is thin but slightly creamy due to the head - again, like a Guinness Draught. This is an easy drinking and enjoyable beer. Tastes more like a porter with some sourness rather than a wild ale. Enjoyable. A bit expensive, but a worthwhile experience. Wouldn't mind drinking it again but not in a rush to buy more."

"O - Didn't know what to expect, not quite as sour as I'd expect from 3F but still super good.Glad I picked this up!"

"Pours black with a frothy, two finger head that lays on top of the beer oh-so-carefully. Head recedes back a bit, but most of it hangs around throughout. A sticky lace lines the sides of the glass. Smells of tart cherry, toasted grains, and a bit of smoke and mild chocolate. The tart smell is pretty overpowering. Upfront taste of cocoa nibs, a bit of smoke in the middle, with a strong tart finish. Beer is full-bodied and well carbonated. This style is a new one for me. I have had both porters and sour ales, but never a combo of the two. Interesting beer nonetheless."

"A rather intense experience. This must be about 2 years old by now, and the brett has really deveoped in the bottle. Looks nice, while the aroma and flavour are overwhelmingly funky and sour with only a hint of malt coming through. The result is relatively complex but unbalanced. Good body. Interesting but I'm not sure it's really my cup of tea. It would be nice to try a younger version of it sometime, for comparison. A worthy effort - grab one if you're a fan of sours/wild ales."

"Had a real mental wrestling match over this. Was too curious to wait and tasted it the very day purchased, at the brewery, fridged briefly to cellar temp. and served in a tulip. Poured coffee-like, not that leggy but mahogany dark, with a pinkie of densely packed,custard-colored head. Roasted coffee aromas, along wish toast, anise, cinnamon and maybe mint or some sweet herb, some cherry, a bit of yeast and cellar but not pronounced in any on those notes. I didn't have a strong mental image on what to expect, taste-wise, but my expectation was of a cidery-fruity sour attack with a swartbier sweetness coming through. It turned out more the reverse. I get a roasty, porter-like first impression with good sarsaparilla, vanilla, clove, pepper swirling around, and then some lactic sourness bleeds in, becoming more and more pronounced as it lingers, into a more sour and woody aftertaste. Mouthfeel was not a mouthful, a bit thin, soapy, just a gentle lap of carbonation to give it some presence. It's complex, odd, something to wrestle with before I decide whether to embrace it. I'm glad in have a second bottle for another taste, but not now."

"I really like the combination of sour and roasted chocolate flavors. The bitterness does not go all that well as it warms up though."
""
""
""
""
"I knew it was not going to be the typical Porter when I saw it was brewed with wild yeast. One never knows what to expect from wild yeast interesting as it can be to catch."
"Overall - Definitely not your ordinary Drie Fonteinen beer. Clean combination of sour and roast, though, which isn't a common attribute."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"(O)- I guess I can expect nothing less from Drie Fonteinen! As I have said, this is very much a rustic porter but made in the extremely old and traditional style. I really really dig this."
"O: An interesting beer. Chocolate and brett."

"Deep roasty malt character, lingering bitterness in the dry finish. Medium bodied with a slight acidity. Woody and smooth, restrained wildness, and an overall pleasant character. A dry roasty porter with a hint of rustic funk on the periphery. Well balanced, and an interesting concept."
"Better than the first time I had it, I am assuming it is an entirely different batch and fairly fresh. The tart funky yeast does just enough to overcome the big traditional porter notes and it all comes together nicely."
"O - overall this is very enjoyable, nice mild taste, nice sour character without destroying my palate.I think this achieves a good balance, and would go for it again if it becomes available."
""
""
""
"overall I like this beer a lot especially as it warms up. it has a musty nature that I really enjoy and can't wait to see how it changes as it most definitely will."
"Starts like a dark brown ale. A combination of sourness and darker, nearly burnt malt. Short aftertaste. Thinnish body with a higher level of carbonation."
""
" The flavor is very pleasant with slight dark cherry taste with subtle currant and dark toasted grain flavor with a light element of tangy yeast and nutty woodiness with gentle vanilla-like quality. overall this is a complex, tasty and quaffable porter. I was really happy I got to try this on tap as it was very easy to drink for the strength, the light brett quality adds a unique dimension to the porter and is very enjoyable."
""
""
""
""
"Nice brew. Different and could very well have been a bad experience. I wonder how this will age, and if the tart will overcome the balance and kill this. Right now, very drinkable."
""
"O: Overall this would make a very nice everyday drinker. Fairly light in flavor with enough complexity to keep it interesting. It doesn't quite meet the expectation of flavor for a 7% sour porter by this brewery, however. Give this to me for $10-12 a sixer and we might have something."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is of medium weight, with carbonation of medium-light intensity. The result is a smooth, slightly foamy mouthfeel that is never fizzy or harsh. Closes dry, with some modest stickiness lingering across the palate."

"Enjoyed this one while pre-gaming going out jazz club hopping in New Orleans at Avenue Pub! Served from tap into a chalice. Poured dark brown with a one finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, dark chocolate, roasted malt, and earth. The flavor was of sweet malt, milk chocolate, roasted malt, earth, and subtle funk. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. When I saw the description of this one on the menu, I really didn’t know what to expect if I am completely honest. However, what I found was actually quite nice. It had all of the aspects of a nice porter going on in it with just a kiss of funk to make it interesting. I really never would have thought about throwing these two aspects together, but they seemed to work decently. Really glad I got the chance to try this one on tap as it was definitely an interesting brew."
"330 ml bottle with 21/10/13 stamped on the bottle cap. Served in a DFH Signature glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch frothy tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good. The brew smells like chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, sweet and tart fruit, and some molasses. It tastes similar to how it smells, like roasted malt, chocolate, tart and sweet dark fruit (plums, cherries, raisins), and a bit of nuts and red wine. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and easy to drink. This definitely isn't a traditional porter! But if you're looking for something that's different and doesn't really fit into a certain style, then you'll probably like this brew as much as I did."
"The flavors and how they attach to the palate reminds me of those English cask porters that are a blend of fresher chocolaty versions and older musty vinous ones. It's a fantastic porter that dares to explore the rustic taste of years gone by instead of denying in fear."
""
"This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is smooth, complex and very enjoyable. People who are fans of sour porters or old english porters will love this. It has a very minor mineral edge and faint familiarity about it but it is very much its own unique creation that I found to be very enjoyable. The 7% abv is masterfully hidden. I need to get more of this beer. Nicely done."

"T: Starts pretty toasty with hints of coffee. Finish brings a tart untie plum flavor with some raisin as well. Interesting, but I don't think I would do this again."
""
"Drinkability is fine, taste wise. For a rare, expensive beer, one is enough."
""
"Overall interesting, but not quite what I expected. The tartness and cherry fruit flavors are nice, but the chalky black patent like roasted malts put a dent in most of the flavors to keep it from being too good of a beer."
"Pours a slightly murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, campfire, sour fruits, and some Brett funk. Taste is much the same with an interesting smoke, sour, and funky aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an odd beer that is pretty good but all over the place with its aromas and flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is quite tasty, I am not sure I would prefer it to a normal Porter, as the sharper funky, Brettanomyces notes clash a bit with the roasted Porter notes. The aroma is definitely a bit nicer and richer than the flavor."
""
"Not nearly as tart as ecpcted."
""
""
""
"O: Phenomenal. The first sour beer that I've loved. Highly recommended. Will have again!"
""
""
"Beer is medium to light in body, roasty bitter at the end, thin up front fills out quickly. The midpalate is a chalky, funky, yeasty, metallic mildly offputting flavor that sort of burns and bothers me. Not a repeat but interesting none the less."
""
""
"Pours a deep, dark brown color with a good tan head and nice lacing. The nose brings faint roast and a bit of chocolate plus some nice sourness. Flavor falls along the same lines; pretty good blend of the two components. Medium body and a dry, slightly-sour finish. Pretty good brew."

"Zwet looks really dark in the glass boasting a dark brown bordering on black color. The firm cap of foam is dark tan with some strength and firmness leaving some notches on the way down. Smell is roasty with some nuts and some brett from the addition. Old world porter quality in taste with English appeal with some brett backing it. Not entirely funky, this is a nicely mixed drink. Nutts with roasted malt with some coffee flavor within. Feel is at about medium with a long lasting finish. It's carbed up nice and I would have no problem taking down a glass or two of it, yet I would not go out of my way to get it."
"On tap at the Trappist. Pours a dark brown, almost black with a two finger tan head that stays a long time and leaves huge streaks of lacing on the glass. This beer was served relatively cold and changed a lot as it warmed up. The aroma was some light roastiness, a bit of coffee, some lactic notes, barnyard funk, and some light lemon. The funky notes and non traditional porter aromas came out more as it warmed up. The taste is some dark roasted coffee, followed by some light lemon zest, a bit of orange peel, some brett funkiness, a bit of cherry, and some lactic tartness on the finish. Again the roasted flavors were more dominant when it was colder, with the other flavors coming to the forefront as it warmed up. Medium-full bodied. Mouthfeel is slightly creamy. Medium carbonation. Not sour, but slightly tart. I enjoyed this. It got significantly better as it warmed up."
"Black pour with a light brown head, retention and lacing are great. The smell is of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts with a backend of funk. More porter than sour, the beer has a roasty coffee finish. Funk is noticed throughout, but does not dominate the beer. Medium to heavy in body, sort of a strange aftertaste. Interesting to try, wouldn't get it again though."
"Pours a charcoal and dark brown color with little head. Mild scent of heavy roasted coffee, light chocolate and dark bread crust combine with light fruit and mild tart and sour notes. Taste is mild and light with the tart sourness covering up much of the roast profile. Lighter side of medium bodied and light in carbonation, quite dry. The experiment is appreciated but the execution is lacking."
"Most of the dark barrel aged beers I've had have covered up the barrel's flavors. This beer is very barrely tasting. Some serious vinous oak going on in the nose. Tastes a little bit like brett and coffee, but they do a pretty darn good job of merging the two worlds. I enjoyed this one from start to fin."
"I was quite impressed with this step outside of the box by Drie Fonteinen. Despite initially thinking a ""Bretty"" porter sounded excessive, I was really taken by this beer."
"Overall: A bit weird. The flavors work for me, but I think something was missing. Don't know that I would have it again."
"D - Very drinkable. The balance of regular porter elements and the sour elements brought upon by the lambic yeast is really nice."
"O - This was different, but nothing that I necessarily cared for. Had my pour, moved onto other things."
"Overall: This beer is far from bad; however it just doesn't work for me. Maybe some time in the bottle could help."
"Overall, this is a good porter, though, in my opinion, it falls short of Armand's other offerings. I preferred it to SN Exportation, but I think that SFTO still stands at the top of the sour porter style for me."
"The body is full and robust with sharp carbonation. Not bad but I think I've had porters I would take over this one."
"O - Interesting beer. I would have liked a little more funk and a little more roastiness, but that's just personal preference. I would get again."
"Poured into a tulip glass, a nice dark black-brown with a finger of creamy beige head that dwindled down to a ringlet, leaving lots of attractive, foamy lace behind. A little swirl of the glass would stir up a little whorl of bubbles on the top. Aroma of roasted malts and mild chocolate, yeast, and notes of citrus with a touch of funk. Taste started out like a typical porter: roasty, malty, touch of chocolate. The mouthfeel was much lighter though, and within a second or two it was obvious that something else was going on: tart cherries, lemon peel, and Belgian yeast obviously coming into play, and a bit of funk as implied in the aroma. But balanced... It wasn't like ""Ooh a porter!, I can has malts!"" then you take a sip and pucker your lips in revulsion. While the balance was there, I still felt this was a bit weak overall, thin and not as full-bodied as it seemed it should have been. Still mighty good though."
"Fuller medium body, higher carbonation, tingly and dry on the palate. Very drinkable and flavorful, definitely an interesting take on the style by 3F which seems to work well."
"Black like ink with a good sized head and stringy lace. Big mocha aromas make up much of the nose; so far it smells like a ""normal"" porter. That changes in the taste; you guessed it, it's a sour porter. Mocha and cocoa notes are subtle, though the tartness is still mild. Still, fairly smooth and not very acidic. While it's not a world-beater, it does show that there's more to Drie Fonteinen than simply lambic."
"A mildly soured cherry stout. It's not particularly drinkable or all that exciting, though it is more than decent."
"A very untraditional take on a very traditional style. I knew before ordering this that it would be a sour porter, but I still had a difficult time stomaching it. A rough go to say the least."
"O: Maybe not what I was expecting from 3F, but I quite liked it."
"Overall I think it is a solid beer that I personally like more than the sum of its parts. Maybe it's that I find it to be a very interesting beer and that scores some points with me. I plan on ageing a couple of these, and I think we may have a completely different animal in a couple years."
"O: Good stuff, I like the flavors and has potential to get better with age given its extremely high level of carbonation."
"Overall: Interesting, but not particularly memorable."
"O: Interesting beer. Not really bold in any sense, but I liked it for what it was."
"Mild acidity with medium body and higher carbonation. Interesting at least, but only decent."
"Overall: Reading all the reviews, I expected a very average beer, with clear sourness in it. I have to say, the sourness is only slightly present, and mostly in the smell. Maybe it is because I am a geuze drinker, but this is more like a regular porter for me. Nice beer."
"I understand the concept of a sour, Brett-inoculated Porter, but I don't think it's a marriage that was ever meant to take place. Non-intentionally metallic and intentionally sour = bad combo."
"Bottle: Poured a dark black color porter with a nice thick off-brown color head with great retention and some very good lacing. Aroma of funky yeast with light sour notes mix in with some roasted malt. Taste is a quite complex mix between some roasted malt with some sour notes and some funky yeast notes. Body is not too full with super great carbonation. Nothing close to a standard porter but a very nice beer nonetheless."
"D - Everything about this beer is pretty good, except one (horrendous) aspect of the nose."
"D - This started out alright, but got worse as time went out. I'm not certain this is a very successful experiment. I think I preferred Southampton Vic for similar approach to making an ""infected"" porter. I had no problem with 4-6oz of this, and it went down fairly quickly, but it's a very strange beer and definitely isn't for everyone."
"O; strange beer a belgian red sour ale woodbarreld?? nice beer for the summer light chilled and the bqq"
"Nice body, it went down like water. I liked this quite a bit but nowhere near as much as their world-class gueuze creations."
"OVERALL: A porter in name only. For an infected porter, however, this one is actually alright. I enjoyed it much more than the other infected stouts I've had in the past year, such as infected Abyss, Sexual Chocolate, and Black Tot. To say that I enjoyed this would be going too far, but the mixed fermentation seems to have kept the sourness in control enough that I could certainly finish it without much issue. Not my style, but to be honest, it's done really well, and some people out there would probably love this."
"Yup... the only 3 fonteinen (so far). Sourness in beer is just not my thing. Putting that aside I think this a very good attempt to mix a porter and a sour beer. If the sour part doesn't scare you this might be very interesting for you."
"This is a nice tasting and drinking Belgian porter/brown ale from Drie Fonteinen."
"The beer is so dark that carbonation can not be seen. A nice lightbrown head, one finger. Chocolate taste. One of the better beers of this festival for the one ticket price!"
"Black color/ fleeting tan head. Roasty malt, chocolate, dry hay, barnyard aromas. light to medium bodied. Mild chocolate, medium roast malt, earthy flavors with some drying barnyard hay to finish."
"I am not sure if this beer is supposed to be slightly sour, or if it just got contaminated by the wild yeasts around the brewery, but it was enjoyable."
"Most places that are awesome at lambics or wilds suck at their other offers. Drie bucks the trend here and this is one worth trying."
