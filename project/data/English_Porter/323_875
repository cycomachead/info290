4.1,-1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"330 ml bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, toast, light toffee, light dark fruit, faint smoke, and roast/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of bit roast/bready malt and light-moderate yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, toast, light toffee, light dark fruit, light smoke, and roasted earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, toast, light smoke, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and robustness of roast/bready malt and light yeast ester flavors; with a good roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and slightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent English porter. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of roast/bready malts and light yeast ester flavors; and very smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Oct 30, 2014"

The taste is full of toast, coffee, and dark chocolate flavors. Very delicious. Although it is worth mentioning that for such a heavy beer I thought the flavors were well balanced and it had a nice clean finish. I love the aftertaste as well which is good because it is a nice velvety consistency that coats your mouth and throat. Would absolutely recommend.","WhiteHillsStore","Jul 23, 2014"

4.06,-1.9,4.25,3.75,4,4.5,4.25,"a classic from a brewery yet to really wow me, this one is a game changer. a mix of so many styles, from dry stout to scottish ale to black ale and beyond, a lot of bases are covered here, a lot of lines crossed, but comfort instead of chaos results. this is a velvety smooth jet black shiny brew that foams up about in inch and a half on the pour and stays vigorous. caramel in head color, rich in aroma. notes of milk chocolate and light roast coffee cascade into a more earthy profile, but maintaining just enough sweetness to not let it get bitter, a great success. the flavor is a lot like the nose, with heaps of dark malt all the way through, but the brewers have somehow coaxed new flavor combinations out of familiar malts. its rich and chocolaty in a new way. its layered, and there is a hint of licorice right before the finish. pillow soft and silky in texture, yet extremely full bodied. carbonation is no more or less than a square medium, and its perfectly dialed for whats going on here. dynamic and nuanced stuff, different in flavor and feel from anything else in the genre, it may in fact be its own genre. i will be buying this one again, i like it far better than its barrel aged variants that ive had. it needs nothing.","StonedTrippin","Jul 10, 2014"

The aroma is chocolate, chocolate, and more chocolate. It is dark and roasty with notes of cocoa nibs, coffee, some fruity esters, and lots of malt. The mouthfeel is just what is promised...oily. This would probably be more drinkable if it had just a touch more carbonation to add a little smooth creaminess. The flavor is once again lots of chocolate as well as some dried fruits, European yeast, a little butter coffee on the tail, and a lot of malty sweetness. I do prefer my porters on the drier side but for a sweet one, this is quite good.","lochef81","Apr 28, 2014"

A real looker, a very dark black brew with a ruby red halo at the bottom of the glass and a supple, sumptuous latte tan colored head that looks rather like sponge toffee. Aroma is dark roast coffee and bitter chocolate, with a faint fruitiness that recalls sour cherries along with a little burnt toffee or perhaps maple sugar. Palate is much the same, creamed coffee, unsweetened baker's chocolate, a whiff of sour cherry, and earthy, near-piney hops that add a unique additional element to the more expected roasted elements. The uber-dark appearance and protruding smooth mouthfeel belie the rather thin body and relatively easy drinkability for such an opaque brew. Coffee flavor outweighs the chocolate and other components and alas, the finish is a tad husky and astringent to my palate. Skews toward the dry and roasted rather than the sweeter regions of dark beer territory, probably due to a lack of crystal malts. Still, worth sampling for the porter/stout aficionado.","CalgaryFMC","Apr 13, 2014"

The nose comprises coffee, dark chocolate, and darkly-roasted malts. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a Guinness-like (or acrid coffee-like) sourness swaying from the background to the fore, but never firmly taking hold. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light carbonation (livelier than most casks lately) and a smooth, easy-going feel. Overall, a very nice English porter, something I could easily see being drained from its current prison and down into my gullet.","TMoney2591","Apr 04, 2013"

There is a one finger medium brown head with only a small amount of retention and delicate spider-web like lacing left behind. The smell is powerful, mostly roasted malt and chocolate. The taste follows the nose. I get a big roasted maltiness upfront with some bitter nuttiness, followed by a mellow chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is thick and pleasant. Excellent offering.","Mojo","Dec 30, 2012"
3.82,-7.7,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Old Engine Oil pours entirely black, with roughly a half finger of mocha foam crowning it. There's a little bit of head retention, but not much in the way of lacing. The nose is roasty, with the aroma definitely leaning more towards the coffee side of things. The flavor displays a malt character that heavily features roasted grains. It's still balanced towards coffee, but there is a little bit of dark chocolate present as well. A light bitterness transitions into a soft, earthy finish. The body has just a little bit of chewiness to it, and the carbonation is nice and muted. Old Engine Oil is a very solid lower ABV stout. It's straightforward and just very well executed.","axeman9182","Dec 30, 2012"

It was served to me in a brandy type glass. It poured black and had chocolate colored head. Upon tasting it the first thing I noticed was a rich coffee/chocolate flavor. Secondly I was hit with a slight taste of sparkling wine. It had the dry sweetness of it, but none of the fizziness typically associated with that sort of beverage. This may be unique to the draught version of this particular beer. It was described to have been fermented in used wine casks. All in all a very pleasurable beer to drink, and i would not hesitate to try again.","StefanosG","Dec 27, 2012"

Mocha, dark chocolate and ground coffee esters sweep across the nose, no harshness or bitterness, this is one smooth brew. The taste follows the aromas, a slight hop bitterness infuses with the other flavours mentioned in the smell to give this beer a balanced and rich texture of an alcoholic creamy chocolate cake. One small bottle is enough though, too much weight in the body to have another. Just a little too rich for me.","BlackHaddock","Nov 04, 2012"

A viscous black porter with a bit of a chocolate head at first that subsides to a watery dribbling down the glass later, leaving no tracing inside. The taste can either be described as subdued and refined or as a bit lacking in excitement, depending on what you're going for. The smell is wonderfully reminiscent of roasted coffee and bitter chocolate, and the aftertaste works to keep those flavors on your palate. The smell is also a bit alcoholic, and I enjoy that especially coming off of only 6%. This is my first Harviestoun, and I have to say I like it. I will be checking out their other brews as I come across them.","shigg85","May 28, 2012"

A nice two fingaz of dark shaded tan foam that clung to the glass on the way down. Smell is what you would expect, roast on top of some chocolate and malt scent. Some coffee in the back as well. Going in, this beer is some smooth stuff. It tastes delicious with a nice medley of the above mentioned scents going into the taste. The true gem of this beer though is the body. It is so silky smooth and goes down easy as pie. I have never drank a stout this quick but it was all to easy. No intrusion by nothing. The feel alone boosts up the drinkability and taste of this beer. The carb is there but does not make a dent through the body. Reminds me of a lighter chocolate milk. I could drink this till the cows came home, and Im not a stout guy.","BARFLYB","May 22, 2012"

The main aroma/taste difference this brew had in cask format is a much heavier emphasis on stone fruits over the roasted malts. It was like cherries and prunes in a cup of mocha coffee on the nose! The flavor had some lighter emphasis on the stone fruits than the nose did, but it was still noticeably present on the palate. Transitions from semi-sweet to dry throughout each sip.

The store I bought this from has tons of UK beers on it's shelves that I am not especially interested in, but I'll always have time for this.

Very earthy, roasty, smokey nose with hints of coffee, cocoa, and a touch of licorice. The taste is dominated by roasty, smokey, burnt coffee and bitter chocolate. A spicy, herbal, bitter hop bite emerges as it warms along with a nice sweet malt finish. I'm typically not a big porter fan as they seem a bit thin to me, but this was slightly syrupy and thick and really smooth without being too sweet. And I never find myself wanting a second porter, but again, this was really tasty and had me wanting another. Very pleasant surprise!","beerdrifter","Jul 06, 2011"
3.31,-20,4,3,3,4.5,3.5," Note: Added some Talisker 10 yo Single Malt Scotch in it later because this one seemed like a good candidate for fooling around.

It smells of lightly roasted coffee with a nice bitter chocolate finish. It tastes of rich coffee and overly bitter chocolate. The chocolate aspect is almost too bitter. It does leave a nice after taste behind though. It drinks a lot thicker than it looked while pouring. It coats the palate. Overall this is a solid brew.

The glass is adorned with much lacing and the head retains as a bubbly ring with a large island in the center. I can't even begin to describe how rich and balanced the aromas are. Can't help but take a sip and both aroma and flavor are described together. Hefty amounts of cocoa and coffee at first, then comes a nice and subtle (that's the key here) ashiness that is balanced by sweet caramel and biscuits. Hint of burnt toast and blackstrap molasses. There is no alcoholic burn; only a tiny warmth is apparent in the finish. Bitterness akin to coffee and char linger on and on. Carbonation is as good as is gets, yielding a velvety smooth texture to this surprisingly light/medium bodied beer. Looks can be deceiving!

4.5,8.7,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"One of several nice birthday beer gifts from my wife this year, picked it out with help from John at Granite Liquors in Weymouth, thanks to both! Poured it into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass. Comes out as close to black as possible, but it's dark brown. When held up to the light and pouring it you can see some deep mahogany colors right around the edges. It has an off white colored head, it doesn't take too long for it to go away and provides a little bit of glass retention. All in all a pretty good looking beer, I wouldn't say it looks like old engine oil in my opinion, but I guess that's a good thing. Smell is very good it has a lot going on. Has some dark fruit/fig characteristics, almost more like a dark fruity liquor though. It has some chocolate aromas to compliment the well roasted malts. This has a bready smell to it which I'm generally not a huge fan of but its quite pleasant in this mixture of aromas. Not a very hoppy beer, but not exactly a hop-head brew. The taste is equally excellent, chocolate roasted malts are the dominant flavor. It still has fruitiness to it, not as dominant as the smell, but still good. The dark fruit liquor taste actually takes a slight backseat to some hops hear, but only slightly, they are both in the vehicle if you know what I mean. Well balanced flavor overall, very tasty, if my jeep's old engine oil tasted anything like this, I'd be drinking it! The mouthfeel is very good, not as thick as I expected it to be based on the name. It's by no means light bodied, it's still a full bodied beer. It's somewhat smooth, close to creamy and incredibly drinkable. This beer could be drank on any occasion whatsoever. It's full enough for the lovers of dark beer and smooth and drinkable enough for the those who like the lighter ones. I think this would be an excellent gateway beer for those who are trying to get into darker beers, a truly great beer.","AndyAvalanche","May 16, 2010"

The aroma is likewise that of a Scotch Ale. Maybe it has something to do with the region it is brewed. Roasted malt is the dominant aroma along with some smokiness. Not overly complex in aroma or flavor. Medium body with nice carbonation makes it pleasant to drink. I was a bit let down by this beer. I was expecting something much more complex.

There is minimal head retention, that gives way to an even blanket of fine lace. This Old Ale style gives off a nice roasty chocolate smell, with some caramel sweet malt and alcohol. The taste is pretty unassuming, almost subtle. First up, roasted malt flavors, and some dark chocolate. Dark fruit is released on the palate as the beer warms up. Some plum, vinous qualities and raisin give way to a bittersweet finish. This beer has a surprisingly lighter body than I expected from the look of the beer. It had that deep thick black appearance that an Imperial Stout has, but this beer was relatively light and creamy, with minimal stick on the palate, and only some heat in the finished, which perhaps has mellowed with age. This beer was a very nice drink, it has that thick beauty to it, without the heavy follow through on the palate.

A nice English Porter that mirrors many flavors that I happen to enjoy in stouts, which makes this ale a nice bridge between the styles.  In terms of English Porters, I think I would give a slight nod to this over Sam' Smiths Taddy Porter, if only because Old Engine Old just seemed to have a more robust profile on both the nose and the palate.  However, I wouldn't mind trying the two side by side for a more accurate comparison.

Overall this was a decent old ale, but not the best. The flavor wasn't as sweet as the scent, which is a shame. The body was good, but I would have preferred it to be fuller. It was clean and easy to drink, especially since it's a relatively low ABV for old ales. I imagine this is what old ales used to be like a long time ago, when they were a primary ingredient to porters. Modern old ales seem to have more of a barleywine character to them, which I prefer.

There's an average carbonation level present along with a noticeable bitterness on the tongue. Tastes of roasted malts first off, then the alcohol is strong. The aftertaste is of a malt dryness that matures into a slight chocolaty flavor. There's a hop bitterness, but not strong hop flavor.

Curiously light-bodied, given the depth of the primary flavors, glides through the mouth. Loaded with coffee bean, mocha powder, hazelnut with even a slight tarry edge. Bitterness breaks through during the mid-palate, gains traction towards end and breathes life into the whole. The level of carbonation appears too high at first but you can get used to it.

While tasting, chocolate walks up and pummels your tongue, with its sweet semi-coating body, lots of good bright carbonation, a slightly warming and drying alcohol finish along with a gentle hop twang. Im trying to relate it to a definitive style i am familiar with, it strikes me as a cross between a dunkel lager/stout/porter hybrid, very unique and very tasty.

4.29,3.6,3.5,4.5,4,4,5,"Pours black with a mocha head that dissipates to leave a few wispy remnants on the surface. The aroma is very fruity, slightly bitter and dark. The flavour leads with a hit of fruit, before melting into caramel, dark chocolate and a slight coffee bitterness. The mix going on in this beer reminded me a little of Anchor Porter. The palate wasn't as I expected - the image of engine oil suggested a very thick, almost syrupy, liquid. Instead the body was medium-light, but with a creamy undertone that suits the beer well. Carbonation was practically non-existent, which I think is a good decision based on the flavours going on here. The lighter body and low carbonation made this a very easy drinker, and the glass was empty all too soon. I could easily have had another.","bobsy","Feb 14, 2008"
4.05,-2.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"This beer came as a bit of a pleasant surprise. It pours a very dark, thick black with some dark head that dissipates pretty quickly. The smell is roasted sweet malts, some hop character, perhaps a bit of coffee, and plum or other heavy fruit. The beer is surprisingly thin and very drinkable. The taste is bready, roasted malts, chocolate, cocoa, some hoppy bite in the finish, but overall very smooth. There are some fruit flavors discernible, there is also a bit of butterscotch in the body as well. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy and buttery leaving a coating of oil on the tongue. The beer is barely carbonated, and goes down very well. There is a bit of hopped up aftertaste, but overall it's quite mild. This beer is well worth seeking out. L'Chaim.","albern","Feb 10, 2008"

Molasses, dried fruit, and chocolate are found in the underlying flavors. Roasted malts round out the finish. Finishes sweet.

Sour with some small flavors of roasted malts, but the dominant flavor is sour. There is some alcohol burn in the chest which is confusing for me considering it's a 6% beer.

Aromas of burnt coffee, dark chocolate, and roasted malts filled my nose. Taste was quite a bit like the smell but a bit better. Somewhat coffee like with some chocolate riding shotgun with plenty of thick roasty/toasty malt flavors. Any alcohol is very well hidden, and finishes rather smooth.

Mostly detectable are dry malt and light noble hops, as well as a slight roastiness. None of the aroma notes make it into the flavor really.

It has a fantastic taste, a bit of coffee, a bit of roasted barley and oats, it's like some fantastic combination of a stout and a scotch ale, but with a nice slight hoppy bitterness at the end, as opposed to the usual maltiness of the other two.

True to its name, I can't locate a speck of light seeping through this monster. Should I expect bits of crankshaft? This appears quite like a very big RIS. Thick tan suds ooze down the glass, as if over-encumbered. And yet, they still manage to leave some nice lacing. Odor is intense: dark cherries, molasses, caramel, espresso, chocolate. A wonder! Taste is of rich toffee, creamed coffee, sugar, and roast bitterness. There's also a slight acidity that goes with a lot of old ales. Alcohol seems to be present in its warming, spicy capacity. This is odd at only six percent, but very welcome. Low carbonation and a huge body, without doubt, lead to liquid luxury.

A nice English Old ale that isn't that old but I could really see this progessing well with some oxidation adding flavors to an already flavor packed beer.

The head is large, tan, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is more like a stout than an old ale as it is listed here on BA. Chocolate, cream, toffee, with a bit of hops in the background. The taste, however, is definitely more like an old ale than a stout. Chocolate, toffee and cream all remain present, but a nice bitterness cuts through them with ease. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with nice smoothness and carbonation. Overall, this is a nice old ale that I will revisit someday. It isn't as strong as others I have had, nor is it as unbalanced as most American interpretations of the style. It is certainly enjoyable though.","KarlHungus","May 22, 2006"

Bits of sediment suspend up against the glass. It doesn't swirl around, it's motionless like fruit in a Jell-O mold. Not a very big head, about a finger width. Very tight and sticky, the color of dark chocolate milk. Receeds to a thin lace. Smell is potent. I can smell the chocolate malt from about an arms length. There is also dried fruit notes. Taste is very complex. Chocolate, espresso, and earthy floral notes. Finishes pretty clean, very little aftertaste. Engine Oil is a good description of the mouthfeel.

Mouthfeel is very still and creamy -- silky, really. Easy to drink... I imagine this would be great on cask. My first thought about this beer was that it would be an excellent accompaniment to a chocolate dessert. It might even work with something creamy, although that would cut the creaminess of the brew a bit, and without much carbonation I'm not sure if that would be a good thing.

Question: Will it taste as smooth as it smells? Answer: Thankfully, yes. Sweet (though not cloyingly so) and smooth up front with some roasty bitterness quickly asserting itself and lingering nicely.

This is a nice and drinkable old ale from the good people at Harviestoun. All their regular brews are solid beers and this is no exception.

This is a full bodied Scottish ale, with a taste that resembles the nose, but is even more complex. Raisins, burnt coffee, and leather emerge in the taste and it all comes together nicely with some bittering hops. A hint of licorice is also noted.

Theres a lot of complexity in the aroma.many hard to place smells.leather, over-ripe fruit, alcohols, multifaceted malts, etc. Its certainly interesting. The taste has a distinct and distracting acidic astringency. At times it seems to border on sourits like lactic acid with the power of a food ingredient citric acid. Not sure if it's a flaw, age, or intentional. Regardless, it's distracting, although not unpleasant. The front is certainly sweet and theres malt and hops there, but I have a hard time fighting the acid twang. Hops and syrupy malt mix in the finishwhich is fairly sweet.

Doesn't hang too heavily on the palate, making for higher drinkability and greater sophistication. This is listed as a Stong/Old Ale, but it contains a mere 6% ABV, and feels a bit stoutish at times.

Smooth malts are not caramel sweet but more roasty and toasty, with mild hint of coffee. Some slight fruitiness gives this beer distinction; a very ripe flavor, kind of like a mild although the alcohol kick can't be denied. This beer evokes, for me, images of cloth caps, wood paneled walls and my grandfather's immense library of antique books. Hoppiness is very herbal, gives the palate a quick jab towards the finish. There is a lasting and lustrous finish that is wonderfully nourishing. Mouthfeel smooth, like oil, if not as thick and sticky as that simile suggests. This beer is labeled a number of things: old ale, strong ale, barley wine, porter; but to me the malts are indelibly characteristic of a Scottish ale.

3.82,-7.7,4,4.5,3.5,4,3.5,"It poured a very dark brown, almost black, with medium brown foam and medium head that dissapated fast, but leaving a nice lace on the glass. The smell was of a very sweet malty aroma, with chocolate and caramel to start. The taste was lacking the malty, chocolate and caramel that was in the aroma. I am very dissapointed in the finish of this beer. The sweet/bitterness is not what I expected. I just wished that it tasted the same as the aroma it gave out to start with.","BeerManDan","Jan 10, 2003"
3.53,-14.7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"The pour, is the color of old ""Engine Oil", the head prodigious, the lace thick clinging sheets upon the glass. The nose is malt, sweet, caramel with a light hint of coffee. Front is sweet, the top skimpy, the finish is mildly acidic, pertinently hopped, quite dry and long lasting aftertaste. Personally I find it quite tasty and well worth a sample for a change of pace","Gusler","Nov 04, 2002"

4.07,-1.7,4,4.5,4,3.5,4,"This beer poured a very dark ruby amber color and formed a bubbly light tan head that left some circular lace as it subsided.  Some sediment present.  An aroma of malt and molasses with a touch of caramel.  A flavor of malt and caramel.  A fairly light body for this style.  A slightly astrigent finish.","Wildman","Oct 16, 2002"

4.62,11.6,4,4.5,5,4,4.5,"It certainly has the look of old engine oil - extremely dark, almost black with just a hint of ruby red noticeable when viewed against a light.  Not as thick as I expected.  Decent head, but rather short lived.  Nice aroma of creamy, mellow chocolate and fruit.  Taste is smooth - very chocolatey with a nice roasted caramel malt character.  A bit of tart fruitiness - plum, I think - rests just under the chocolate.  Smooth and creamy beer.  Overall, a great treat.","Viking","Sep 20, 2002"
4.18,1,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,3.5,"This does make a great desert beer.It also makes one hell of a breakfast beer.That's right! Before there was coffee,there was ale.I like to drink this at the same temp I would drink a porter.I find by not chilling it,that it wakes this mellow beast up a bit more.It really does look like old engine oil (not sludge, just slightly used).Great aroma with fruits, caramel and licorice.These same items vocalize themselves in the flavor as well.Fluffy mouthfeel with a smooth,hoppy finish and a hint of chocolate.Great warming characteristics going down and breathing out.My only complaint would be the max of 2-3 in a sitting.","dpend","Sep 17, 2002"
4.4,6.3,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"A special selection on tap at Redbones BBQ. Deep dark brown or black color, depending on the light. Slight ruby hints along the edges. Creamy light brown head, laced down the glass. Smell was a serious combination of sweet roasted fruit, sublte chocolate and carmel malt, and toffee. Taste was truly unique, roasted plums, raisins, subtle chocolate, and coffee bitterness finish it up. Finish lingers, but how can it not, with everything going on. Thick, full feel,yet slippery,  I could have only one of these at a time, especially with all the food they give you at Redbones. I thought it was a stout as I drank it, later learned it's an old ale. Very interesting, orginal, and memorable beer. Great name too.","StevieW","Sep 08, 2002"
4.2,1.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Note: The second pint I had a month or two later did not exhibit the apricot flavor that was there the first time, but every other flavor note remained. Odd.","sponberg","Aug 23, 2002"
4.42,6.8,4,4.5,4.5,5,4,"Possibly one of the most distinctive beers I've ever had. The color is deep ruby, but not black (although it almost appears that way in the glass). It's topped by a short but creamy light tan head that displays good head retention and leaves some spotty lace. The aroma is intense; full of toffee, dark fruit, roasted malts and light candy. The dark caramel flavor doesn't quite follow suit, but offers a very creamy, round, and full mouthfeel - but not as big as might be indicated by the name! Hops are present and well integrated. A very drinkable beer, full of great character but not overwhelming; although I'm not sure I'd want to drink too many of these in a row!?! Definitely a Scottish-style ale, but also something else altogether. Wow!","NeroFiddled","Jul 28, 2002"
4.32,4.3,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"Nice, porter like look to it. Definitely what it says on the label, an after dinner beer. Nice chocolate and plums to the aroma. The flavor is roasty, some chocolate, plums and the slight apple peel taste that I'm starting to decide is a certain type of hops. The mouthfeel is really smooth. Love the name and glad that it caught my attention.","aracauna","Apr 11, 2002"
3.91,-5.6,4.5,3.5,4,4,4,"Very smooth and balanced ""light"" old ale.  Beautiful garnet hues poke through a dark body with thin tan head sitting on top.  Minimal malt aroma.  Typical Scottish maltiness with plummy/cherry undertones.  Looks like I thought this was lighter bodied than other BAs, yet it still left long lasting residuals.  Although it's not a huge beer, many US brewers would be proud to call this their winter warmer.","pbrian","Apr 02, 2002"
4.05,-2.2,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Thick and rich pour, and a toasty, and sweet smell. Excellent malt character, quite sweet, very roasted, with hints of plum and caramel. The mouthfeel is the best characteristic of this beer, slighty carbonated, and very thick, this beer could be as good a topping on ice cream as in a pint glass. Very good beer...","hooligan","Feb 06, 2002"
4.76,15,5,4,5,5,5,"Boy the Scotts really know how to do up the malt. Every sip of this screams with chocolaty, roasty goodness. Big on the body with a wonderful mouthfeel.   Yummmy!! Hop-heads need not apply.","mattmaples","Sep 12, 2001"
4.55,9.9,4.5,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,"Notes: A big dark beer to remember, had it on cask and I am pleased that it is easier to obtain now that it is imported in bottles. The likings of an old ale with a more than sturdy malt back bone to hold up against the heartiest of meals, lamb stew with parsnips and fennel paired with a loaf of multi-grain beer bread would do be just fine. 6.0% abv.","Jason","Sep 09, 2001"
