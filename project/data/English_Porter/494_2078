3.49,-1.4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Overall: a decent Australian take on the English porter. The usual flavours of chocolate and roast coffee, with a touch of liquorice and caramel to boot. The price is right, at around AU$58 a case, but a slightly fuller body could have improved it somewhat. Nonetheless, an easy-drinking, reasonable beer.","SmashPants","Jul 05, 2014"

2.65,-25.1,2.5,2.5,3,2,2.5,"Lightly carbonated dark beer with little to no head.. perhaps because I poured it straight from the fridge. Smells metallic and minerally.

3.32,-6.2,3.5,4,3,3.5,3,"Overall, decent, but I prefer a fuller bodied porter with less carbonation.

A really nice pleasant chocolate driven nose backed by a touch of roasted coffee. Like most JS beers, this is a beer for the punters. Enough to keep a geek happy and not too far out to scare off Joe Average. A good medium bodied, medium bittered dark beer with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Goes down just fine this cool evening.","juju7","Jan 14, 2010"

Almost black with ruby tints when held to the light, fairly ordinary light tan head even when poured hard, although plenty of lacing was left behind as the bottom of the glass approached.

Taste is somewhat better, very mildly bitter dark chocolate and espresso with a slightly dry and warming finish. Mouth is watery; not what it could be I suspect.

Body is smooth and bit coating. Only complaint is that the beer seems to start off a lot bigger than it finishes -- the complex combination of flavors at the start of the beer suggest a full-bodied, robust porter, but the beer finishes a bit on the watery side.

Has a copper head, that looks alot like it has too much sediment running through it. but other than that i can't say a bad thing about this Porter. It's not as complex as some porters, but it's chocolate, caramel, slightly nuttish finish is still pretty good.","Anonmatel","Dec 07, 2001"

Much better, more roast and chocolety nuttyness with a dry finish. Still a tad thin, but pleasant, nice for session drinking.","rastaman","Beers"
