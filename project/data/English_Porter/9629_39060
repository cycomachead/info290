This porter pours a deep almost black mahogany with a nice tan head and substantial tan lacing. The aroma is overwhelmed by rich chocolate, sweet malt, and a touch of hops. The mouth is smooth and creamy. Fairly heavy for a porter but strictly in the best of ways. The flavor adds a significant amount of coffee and roast to the notes found in the nose. Their is surprisingly little alcohol bite given the abv. It is very drinkable and enjoyable. Shorts is still the quintessential hit or miss brewery for me but this is definitely a hit.","lochef81","Mar 27, 2014"

4.42,4.7,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, the beer was a dark murky brown color with an off-white lacing coating the glass. A beautiful sweet dark coffee aroma exploded from the glass. A $4 coffee rarely smells this exciting. The initial taste was sweet dark chocolate blending nicely with the sour notes. A traditional English Porter should have sour aspects to it, but should not overwhelm the rest of the beer. Despite being an imperial, the sourness is well balance with other aspects of the beer. Notes of molasses and burnt sugar were also detectable. The dark chocolate and sour notes continue into the aftertaste but begin to evolve. The 9.15 ABV is well masked until the warming sensation in the aftertaste, lingering nicely. Being a porter, the beer is on the thicker side while still being an easy drinker. No aspect of the beer overwhelms, allowing everything to be well balance. Well Done!","JohnnyHopps","Oct 19, 2012"

Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, coffee, char, molasses, earth, and light herbal. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity. Taste of huge dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, char, earth, caramel, molasses, and herbal. Fair amount of spicy and roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, char, caramel, and earth on the finish for a good bit. Great balance and complexity of highly robust flavors; good malt/bitterness balance as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice.

Only a slight dark mocha tan head forms after swirling but quickly retreats to a collar around the glass. Metallic right off the bat but I also get some roast coffee, dark chocolate, and booze in the nose. The aroma I am not that keen on. Medium mouthfeel, velvety...nice. Bittersweet chocolate, roast, leather, and alcohol. The bitterness from the roast cuts a little at the end and lingers on. Overall, I’m not all that impressed by this. I'm a little confused by all the high ratings for this. The picture depicts one of their one off beers and the bottle I have is a regular 12oz, I wonder if they scaled up production and some quality got lost in translation?","kbutler1","Jan 15, 2012"

Hints of dark molasses and bourbony alcohol in the aroma as well. Taste follows the aroma, dark fruits are more easily evident, chocolate, roasty nutty malts, a hint of a grassy hop to balance. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy in body, very creamy, with just a bit of hop tingle n the tongue, nice roasty after taste leaves just a small bit of dryness and alcohol warmth.
