"O: A solid porter that goes down a treat. Looks great, while the aroma and flavour possess a satisfying blend of roasted malt, coffee, mild molasses and earthiness. Good bitterness but not excessive. Nice body. Worth sampling if you come across it."

"Benchmark for an English Porter. Tasty with a nice roastdness and very sessionable. Let it warm and you will be rewarded."

"This is my perfect pint. I love it."

"I'd have to drink a few pints or more in succession to really start to adjust my palate to it, zero in on some points, but what a memorable ale! You gotta try it - you may like it."

"This beer pours deep brown with a large, off-white head. The aroma is strong on cocoa powder and coffee, with a hint of roasty malts. The taste is good, it's got a great effervescent mineral character over roasted malts and chocolate. The mouthfeel is prickly and light, and the drinkability is good. A solid example of a lower ABV porter - the likes of which don't seem to make it over to US shores all that often."
"Intense aromas of burnt/roasted/toasted malts: these turn into coffee and chocolate flavours in the taste. A hop bitterness is never far away and I found this a complex and interesting Porter."

"On cask at Town Hall Tap in Minneapolis. This beer arrives a very dark brown color. The head is an inch of solid white foam that stays put leaving tight rings down the sides of the glass until the beer is gone. The aroma is of chocolate, cocoa powder, and roasted malt with hints of cherry. The taste is similar to the aroma, and has nice complexity. The mouthfeel is spot on for a cask beer. Silky in texture, medium bodied, and lightly carbonated. Overall, this is a nice, easy drinking porter that I will certainly drink again if the chance presents itself."

"Pours dark brown with a good cask-level light tan head. Good lacing on the way down. The nose carries a strong component of diacetyl, which is thankfully at least partially covered up by roast and chocolate. Flavor isn't quite as bad on that front, though it's still there. Nothing too interesting. Medium body and light carbonation with a bit of roast. Okay."
""
"Medium body, with a good creamy feel. Alcohol is a non-factor. Easy to drink. Nothing mind blowing, but a solid quaffer."

"Not something you'd like to drink a lot of at one sitting, but good for a contrast with sweeter or more sour beers, and it certainly stands alone."
"A good and well balanced porter."
"It is medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Somewhat watery in the feel and easy drinking. This is something I could forsee myself drinking all day long while getting some work done around the house. But to sit down and just sip and savor, this isn't the brew for the job. The description/details in this listing are more appealing than the brew itself (minus the slug reference.)"
"Body feels watery."
"The initial pour creates a monstrous explosion of foam, one that slowly settles into a spongy vanilla crown atop an impervious, and foreboding, body of black. A thick lacing begins to form a crust along the glass rim. The nose detects some subtle, yet sweet, notes of honey and toffee; the palate receives vague tastes of nut and toasted malt. Old Slug is smooth, creamy and well-balanced - yet, surprisingly light in its' overall body. All in all, this porter makes for a really nice quaff to warm the holiday, or any day when thirst comes calling."
"Probably one of the smoothest beers I have reviewed. It felt like drinking a down pillow!"
"D: Drinking this beer is a breeze and its low alcohol content makes it very sessionable."
"Taste is much improved though after drinking. Very coffee like in at first taste, and nicely balanced with malt and light sugars. Excellent body on this beer with a faint nut finish. Very enjoyable. Beer feels BIGGER than the ABV it states. Would drink this in a heartbeat."
"Drinkability is excellent. The tangy yeast and mineral quality keep the interest up, but I'd like to see a bit more malt body and flavor."
"D - solid good flavor and mildness of the feel make this am all nighter."
"Overall: Overall I was very excited to try this beer. It looked great, smelled delicious, but then never really delivered for me. A little too bitter and hoppy, and I didnt get enough of the chocolate and caramel sweetness that I was expecting. Decent beer, but not great."
"Overall, this beer was a good beer. I was taken back by the mouthfeel, I was expecting something a little heavier. If you let this beer warm up you really let the complexities of the aromas and tastes open up."
"Some warming, light body, light effervesence, slightly dry finish. Watery throughout. Decent overall but only decent."
"D - Quite unspectacular, and certainly not challenging; therein lies its strength."
"Overall I found this to be a quintessential English Porter - low ABV, muted flavors, and easy-drinking. Worth a shot, especially if that's what you're looking for."
"Drinkability: I think I've been spoiled by American porters which are richer in flavors. I've had this one before and I'm just not as impressed the 2nd time around. Not bad and maybe if I was in a pub in England I'd ask for another glass, but otherwise not something memorable or grabbing enough for me to pick up another one."
"As porters go, this one is a bit light. I couldn't generate any kind of a head from this one, even when pouring from very high: nothing more than a very loose, coke-type head that disappeared almost instantly. Decent aroma of charred grain and molasses, not very strong but pleasant enough. There was a hint of citrus as well. Rather thin in the body, appropriately lacking in fizz; a tad watery overall. The taste was unusual for this style: there was enough toastiness and caramel to qualify it as a porter, but the ill-mannered fruitiness from the hops took over too quickly. With prominent flavors of orange and lemon, even a little honey, this tastes more like a bitter than a porter. Call it a dark bitter, perhaps? Worth a try, but only once."
"Exactly what you want from an English Porter."
"Poured this beer out of a 500ml bottle into a pint glass it pours a jet black coca cola colour with little carbonation and leaves absolutely no head or lacing whatsoever just a little swirl pattern in the middle,it has nice sweet honey,toffee aromas with a little chocolate in the background quite inviting actually,it has a really nice nutty,woody almost caramel flavour to it with an average mouthfeel and definately finishes with a nice solid chocolate backnote but not too overpowering by any means just a really easily drinkable beer no matter what the temperature is outside."
"A little bit of a bland porter, at least in the flavor. The aroma is very pleasant. I'm sure fresh from the brewery the flavor is a little better. I would love to try this one on cask. Recommended."
"Pours a rather viscous black body with one-finger tan head that leaves lace around the glass. A mix of sweet malts like dark chocolate and some roasted/coffee malts - textbook of style. More of the same as this medium-bodied beer is smooth and creamy with a balance of both noticeable sweet malts (chocolate, caramel, toffee) and dry malts (coffee, roasted, biscuit) for a sweet, chewey beer that has a dry finish. Beer slightly warms as you sip, and it is a sipper despite how easy it goes down, and becomes even better. If you like your porters more to the sweet mellow side than this one is a keeper."
"Bottle. Very little head, dark pour. Chocolate aroma but not much else. Medium-thin mouth feel with average carbonation. Coffee flavor with a touch of chocolate. Not super flavorful, but pleasant. Over, a nice, though not inspiring beer. Good session porter."
"A very drinkable brew, and a very decent porter. Was a tad expensive for me to do again, but glad I tried it. I could do a couple of these at a sitting, but then I'd be ready to move on."
"The beer reminds me of a few Southern English Browns that I've had, but with Porter's depth and complexity. The beer promises larger than life flavors first but the settles into a pleasantly sessionable beer."
"D: easy to drink, enjoyable, just not my thing."
"Overall, this is a middle of the road porter in my opinion. I was hoping for more flavor, especially after the nose was so strong."
"D - Drinkable, but average."
"Mouthfeel is good, medium bodied and lightly carbonated, this is certainly an easy drinker. Drinkability is excellent. The body of the beer pairs so well with the smooth, rounded out chocolate and roasted flavors, its easy to sit back and enjoy this one. Check it out, not too expensive and worth a try if you like the style. As always, serve nice and warm, the beer will shine."
"Note: One last thing worth noting is that the beer actually tastes like it's described on the lable. Often times the descriptions aren't even close, so props to RCH there."
"Poured this one at home about 45 minutes after I sampled it at work so it didn't pour much of a head at all. The color was very dark brown. The aroma was toasted, musty and woody (This is what I'd imaging the air to smell like in London). The flavor had a bitter hoppiness with toasted flavors up front finishing with a slight resiny tone. Light in body with layed back carbonation."
"D: Pretty good. Not terribly interesting, but easy to put down."
"I grabbed up an Old Slug one night with a couple porters & schwarzbiers and have to say I wish I could find it on draught, as it has a couple deficiencies bottle-wise. The 16.9 oz. bottle poured ablack-ruby color with a flatness that only thereafter saw a tan everso slight head emerge. The aroma likewise was mild and I was immediately not expecting much. However, it's slight cherry-porter taste was not too sweet and had a nice slightly bitter mouth feel. A mild chocolate & chalky aftertaste followed."
"D - This is one of the tastiest porters I've tried. With it's low ABV(4.5%),and flavorful clean taste, this is one of the most drinkable porters around. Would like to find it on tap somewhere!"
"taste is bakers chocolate, old coffee, malt in the back, slightly bitter in the end."
"Near black with a light tan head. This beer was very tasty for the light weight, but not the most complex. It focused on black malt flavors in the realm of black coffee and dry, dark chocolate. If the bottles weren't prohibitively expensive ($8.50 here), I'd probably have it again. Worth a try."
"This is a superb English Porter. Recommended."
"weird and almost pathetic, this porter is not a shining example of what an english porter should be. nor should it be judged as such."
"4 D: a decent porter it is, showing a balanced body and reasonable depth for a 4.5%abv. ""small"" beer. I expect the cask-conditioned version to be thicker and more 3D dimensional in terms of texture, but this bottle is already very drinkable all the same."
"16.9oz bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Pours a dark brown, almost black color wtih a large creamy light tan head that sticks around forever and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. The aroma is dark roasted malts with notes of cocoa and cherries. The taste is dark and roasty with some unsweetened chocolate flavors and a mild roasted bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Overall, Old Slug is a solid English Porter that is definitely worth a shot! Recommended!"
"If I were in a pub just grabbing pints to down with my friends I might appreciate this more, for its drinkability (with just enough to it to keep it going). I wish I could concur with the description on the label, but the said characteristics are too subtle for me to truly appreciate, I suppose. With a modest abv, and no ""off"" tastes, this is an easy drinker to have at a pub chatting with friends. That's all."
"D: Quite drinkable."
"Coffee in aroma. Big white head on reddish tinged black. Bold taste spurred on by the fruit, whatever the red cherry is. Medium mouthfeeel. Refreshing, above average carbonation, a good effort to get this flavour with an under 5 abv. Above average porter."
"D - Easy drinker. A very nice Porter."
"Pours very dark brown with a small amount of tan head. You really have to hold it close to light to see a ruby showing on the liquid. Mild coffee tones. You really have to pull at it to get something. Flavor is good. There are some richer characters here, but overall it seems a little bit thin and watery. What is there gives a nice malty flavor, but I feel like it could be (and should be for the price) thicker. Feel has a good carbonation to it, but just like the flavor, the liquid feel is too thin I say. Could stand to have more body. Overall a decent porter, but not really worth the price at all. Have had much better examples out there."
"D: Overall, I liked it. Would make a good session beer."
"The beer pours forth from the 500ml bottle a deep brown to almost black with some ruby highlights, the head is a thick and creamy tan that piles high on the body of the beer, after its demise, the lace forms a thin veil to obscure the glass. Nose has a rich toasted grain aroma, sweet with slight hints of coffee, quite pleasant. Start has a decent roasted grain flavor, sweet with a touch of bitterness; the top falls in the medium category, just barely. Finish has a mild acidity with the hops apropos to the style, and the aftertaste has a lingering sweetness with just a touch of the roasted grain bitterness sticking to the palate."
"D: i like this one. it's easy to kick back with and you could probably do so with a few of them and still be able to remember where you were the night before. cheers!"
"Medium to light bodied and a very drinkable beer. This could wash down just about any happy hour pub fare without slowing you down."
"D: Mild easy drinking porter. Lacks strong flavors normally attributed to porter. Quite sessionable nonetheless."
"Aroma is mildly bready with some pepper spice and a bit of smoke. Hard to discern. Taste is milk chocolate, bitter coffee, and lots of smoked malt. Very interesting and different. Mild sulpher aftertaste, and an oily mouthfeel. Not bad!"
"Low abv makes the alcohol almost undetectable, great liquid bread for porter lovers."
"Overall impression: A little on the light side. Overall, a well crafted beer. No real flaws but may benefit from a more complex grain bill."
"Poured out jet black with a tan head, and styrofoam-like lacing. The nose has big sweet dark fruit, some coffee and chocolate, anda bit o alcohol. The taste slices your throat with dark caramel flavors, followed by some tiny amounbt of chocolate. Has a cola like mouthfeel, and finishes remarkably clean."
"Tastes much sweeter than the nose would have you believe, with some very distinct fruit, bitter malt in the back, and ending on a node of hops and pears. There's a nice fruity hop aftertaste, to boot."
"Somewhat boring for an English Porter. I would wager this would be considered a Macro Porter in England. Nice for the states, but not something I would actively look to return to. Not special enough for me to want to try again."
"500 ml brown bottle, courtesy of Cardinal pub, Stavanger. bottle conditioned, ABV is 4.5%. Very dark brown colour, nearly black. Decent and lingering creamy tan head. The slug-like ""trail"" of the head down the side of the glass as you drink has allegedly given the beer its name - together with the fact that the brewers had to ""fight"" slugs coming into the brewery at the old premises. (As we know, slugs LOVE beer.) Pleasant aroma of prunes, mild coffee and chocolate. Roasty flavour, fairly dry, notes of coffee, dark bread and chocolate. Some fruity notes in the finish, ""coffee"" aftertaste. A decent porter with a moderate ABV."
"Totally non-offensive beer that is easy to drink and refreshing, minus the dry finish. I like porters, I could definitely drink this one again, but it's not particularly noteworthy."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown, almost black, with not much of a head at all. It smells like roasted malt, chocolate, cherries and coffee. It tastes the same way, except that there's a slight nutty flavor too, along with a bitter finish. It's medium bodied with very low carbonation. The beer goes down very smooth too, the mouthfeel is nice and a little bit on the creamy side. Overall, it's pretty good, I liked it a lot. Not much alcohol in this one (4.5 ABV) and it if wasn't for the cost of a single bottle, I would drink this as a session beer."
"Overall - An excellent example of a porter.... Very drinkable... Recommended !!"
"Awesome!! Good from the bottle, but never miss this when on Cask. Ever!"
"It has a slight cloa, coffee taste with a hint of burnt nut. Very rich, nice mouthfeel."
"More coffee at first, a malty sweetness to follow and finishes bitter. Drinks great, goes down smooth and leaves a nice experience."
"I imagine this is much more interesting and exciting in the cask. As it stands it's a decent porter in the bottle."
"Very pretty beer. Deep dark brown, with a huge, tan head that stays for a while and leaves lovely lacing around the glass. Just gorgeous. Smell is almost all chocolate. Sweet and rich. A hint of coffee in the background. Taste is less chocolatey, more bitter and earthy. Loses some of the depth and richness of the nose. Mouthfeel is full and decidedly chewy. Pretty drinkable, a bit on the heavy side though. Porters aren't my favorite, but I could get in the mood for this now and then."
"Great/terrible name for a beer. Pours quite dark, nearly black, with nut brown highlights. Great, sticky head that never quite disappears. The aroma is quite powerful with loads of roasted malt and bitter used coffee grounds. There's also a slight, honeyish sweetness in the nose. The flavor is sweet first-off, and that sweet undertone remains throughout, even when the bitter roasted malts kick in. The bitterness in this beer snaps very pleasantly. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both very good -- this beer is well balanced and easy to put down, but also continually interesting. Highly recommended and highly regarded."
"This beer is bottle conditioned, it pours an opaque dark brown to almost black with ruby highlights with a thick tan head from a brown 16.9 oz bottle. Quite vinous or ester-like in the nose. Good strong malt flavor that lasts briefly fading into vinous notes. Interesting, but not my favorite of the style, I tend to like coffee and chocolate notes in my porters, none of which are present in this brew (except possibly in the slightest amounts in the finish). Definitely worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"Had this on cask at dba in Manhattan... a solid all-around porter. Very roasty chocolatey flavors melding with a good deal of hoppiness that was almost reminiscent of a good English bitter. Very balanced and drinkable to the Nth degree on cask. I would always order a pint of this if I saw it on cask."
"For the money that it costs to get a single bottle ($5.00) in America, I believe that I would have been better off with something else."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Wish it were a little sweeter, but very enjoyable nonetheless."
"Dark brown appearance with cherry-colored highlights. Big frothed milk head of over 1/2 an inch in height and plenty of lasting power. Laces in thick attractive sheets. Sweet aromas, butterscotch and brown sugar. Lower carbonation and medium mouthfeel, easy-going. Starts out with a bittersweet chocolate and a nice integration with the aroma to give a milky sense. Bittering is mild, with a flowery tone to it. The texture falls a little in the later profile, diminished somwhat by the finish. Goes out softly, which makes it drinkable and appropriate at 4.5% ABV, but doesn't really stand as a memorable single bottle."
"The beer pours a deep dark black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a very slight black and chocolate malt aroma. It boasts of roasted malts and English ale yeast. The taste is good. It has a smooth and creamy black and chocolate malt flavor that is slightly sweet and dry on the finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a full bodied beer with a little too much carbonation. This is a fine porter. I love the chocolate character, but the carbonation needs to be less. Anyway, this is a fine sessions ale; a good drinker."
"Old Slug Porter (great name, great label) is one of the lightest porters that I've ever had. It's so light, in fact, that it seems unfinished; as if the brewers sketched the outlines of a good beer, but neglected to fill in the center, to give it substance. This one is skippable."
"Overall: High carbonation that added to the appearance really detracted from the brew itself. I wont give up entirely, but will try to check out some notably fresher or cask versions next month in the UK. It may have lost something on the shelves at Wells. With all the other porters out there, both national and international, the slug only stays ahead by a clever label and some other nice appearances."
"Decent amount of carbination, would enjoy it more with a bit less, but still has a nice feel. Great, dark tastes of espresso and hops. Walnutty, bit of oaky whiskey, aftertaste of chocolate and vanilla beans. Caramelly honey sweetness, but nothing that is too heavy or cloying. Very easy drinker for us stout and porter lovers."
"Thanks to GClarkage, again, for the kick-ass beers."
"Though a bit thick and sticky in the mouthfeel, I found it rather easy to drink. Odd little beer, but I'd drink again."
"Clean finish and wide open nose makes the beer approachable and the spices lend it an exotic swing that makes the beer interesting."
"500ml bottle: This one pours a fairly opaque brown color. There was a bit of a tight, tan head to it. Some lacing down the glass. Some roastiness to the aroma. Maybe some subtle fruits in there also. The taste is mainly roastiness, with hints of chocolate. A decent porter."
"I get the feeling this beer does not travel particularly well. I bought mine in SW England, and it was great."
"ng"
"Drinkability was good but not sure I'd want more than one. Unique flavors but didn't make me crave another like a great beer should."
"I admit, I like this beer, but the price is a bit steep, I had to pay $4.00 for a bottle, but like i said, I was not disappointed, just not an everyday beer."
"No, hook up with Anchor, Sierra Nevada, or Rogue...worth it for an excursion, but nothing else."
"Pours a one-fingered light tan head leaving a good lace, very dark ruby color. Light to medium carbonation. Roasted coffee/malty nose. Starts as a roasty coffee with a hint of malts and finishes with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Full bodied. A good porter."
"Dark brown, almost black yet when held up to the light it is brilliantly clear. Little head, low carbonation levels. Roasted chocolate aroma, actually, extremely roasty aroma. Flavor is dry and very slight sour chocolate roast. Then the finish is bone dry roasted. The mouthfeel is spot on, but the dry finish and the roasted nature don't score high drinkability."
"Roast, smoky aroma, lovely soft palate. chocolate, roasted malt, smokyness in the flavour some earthyness in their aswell, light texture, nice and soft, long roasted finish, very pleasant, highly drinkable porter. Not big or thick or anything, soft and round, and easy to get into."
"Great bottle-conditioned mouthfeel, which helps provide some interest to the palate, and lengthen the finish. Its certainly easy to drink, but offers little reward for doing so."
"This beer poured a large head that was tan, creamy and had fine sized bubbles. The hue of this beer is dark brown and the lacing was fair. The nose was that of chocolate and roasted coffee and the flavor was roasted coffee. The mouthfeel was smooth and light."
"It's very dark, with ruby highlights. An enormous tan head forms quickly and stays chunky throughout consumption. There's nothing strong in the aroma, just hints of chocolate and roastiness. The mouthfeel is kind of watery, but the taste is smooth and mellow chocolate and roasty flavors. It's mellow for a porter, but very enjoyable. I much prefer the more rich and flavorful porters."
"Deep ruby-hued, murky, brown body. Huge head (even on a careful pour - the yeast was pleasangly active in this bottle) with excellent retention and finally settles into the appearance of a float. Smell of barley and toasted toffee with hints of chocolate and a light fruit undertone. Taste of toffee, with hints of chocolate and coffee. Flavor becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. Bitterness is fairly low. Finishes with a light chocolate taste. Smooth and creamy, but slightly thin, mouthfeel. This is an excellent bottle-conditioned porter, and a perfect session beer."
"1pt brown bottle. Slug label is cool. Deep shiny black color. Huge rocky tightly fizzy beig head. Laced all the way down the glass, and stayed. Subtle smells of coffee, chocolate and roasted earthen woody smells. Taste was subtle yet balanced combination of slightly roasted coffee, sweet roasted malt. Chocolate malt finishes nicely, but overall a bit of a thin watery finish, especially for the rich dark look and smell. Very good and close to a great porter. I think it's just a touch watery, but worth a try."
"Foamy, beige head is enormous. Pouring additional beer leaves a dent. As it subsides it is forming a plateau in the center of the glass. Good lacing. Body is black and ruby.  Aroma is coffee with milk chocolate highlights. Taste has mild coffee and chocolate, adds some hops, but is overall very subdued. Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than expected from the look of the beer.  Not a bad beer, but somewhat disappointing."
"The glass I used may not have been rinsed thoroughly because I got a slight soapy taste in the beer. I've heard some beers referred to as being a little soapy, but the guy I split the bottle with didn't get it. The head was out of control (again an unthoroughly rinsed glass could explain this) but it wasn't much smaller on the glass I poured my friend. Nice roasty maltiness and some coffee notes like you'd expect from a porter but everything was a little subdued. Nice smouth mouthfeel with some body to it. Beer is dark with blood/ruby highlights. Not bad, but I probably won't be a regular drinker."
