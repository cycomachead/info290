"330 ml bottle into snifter, no bottle dating. Pours pitch black color with a small dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, raisin, plum, light licorice, light smoke, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, raisin, plum, light licorice, light smoke, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/roasted earthiness. Fair amount of herbal/spicy hop and roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toast, molasses, dark bread, raisin, plum, light licorice, light smoke, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice robustness, balance, and complexity of big dark/roasted malt and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an excellent English imperial porter style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of big dark/roasted malt and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering."

"O:  Deliciously dark.  One of the better porters I've had."

"Entirely deserving of its name, this full-bodied beer is rich, thick, and intense. The aroma is fantastic; and the flavor, though considerably boozy and bitter, is complex and delicious."

"Pours a rich black with a thin brown head. Aroma is of sweet chocolate and caramel malt. Taste has a nice sweet roasted chocolate and caramel malt flavor with some roasted espresso bean bitterness. Palate is a full rich slightly viscous body, smooth and slight sticky mouth feel with good mild carbonation. The finish is sweet mildly roasted caramel and chocolate malt with some mild roasted espresso bean bitterness for balance. Overall this is a very good full flavored rich and tasty brew, enjoyed."
"Black with a luscious, creamy head that sticks close to the surface.  Smells deeply malty...dark bread, coffee beans, cocoa, nougat, and a soft plum and berry fruitiness.  First sip is notably creamy smooth and features chocolate, coffee, molasses, and tobacco with a slight smoky char underlying it all.  Plush and somewhat chewy in texture, it's not really heavy so much as beautifully soft and creamy.  Sweet, but not cloyingly so.  Excellent...I feel classy drinking this. Funny how you sometimes find the best beers on the lowest shelves covered in dust."

"Pours pitch black with a slight head that laces and retains less than normal.  Light nose of chocolate, roast and dark fruit (dates, figs, raisins) with a touch of coffee over a light rich malt sweetness.  Medium bodied with a very slick, approaching creamy, texture.  Below normal carbonation with no effervescence on the finish.  The excellent flavor profile is quite complex yet balanced.  Alcohol is noticed on the first sip, but then becomes well hidden.  It begins with a rush of dark chocolate sweetness and roast over a light coffee background, then the dark fruit flavors predominate the middle.   The finish is a slow fade of the flavor profile where the spicy hops become evident and leaves a nice alcohol burn at the back of the throat."

"Overall and excellent beer.  The name is spot on, color and viscosity is right in line with burnt engine oil.  Definitely worth a try."
""
"A remarkable beer from a great brewery. The texture has velvety richness to it, but remarkably drinkable. Bouquet of chocolate and iron. Flavor profile is very complex, with an iron like flavor giving way to deep malty and chocolate flavors. One of my favorite porters. b"

"This comes very close to the very top, would have been better if it kept the rich roastiness of the regular Old Engine Oil (actually, if the alcoholic sweetness didn't cover it up). Still, a huge English porter."

"Doesn't really meld – wood is just laid on top of the base beer. Cuts too dry and loses the smoothness of OEE."
""
"Pours the color and viscosity of...you guessed it...old engine oil. Nice tan milk chocolatey looking head. Aroma is dominated by the smoky, toasty malt, and it smells damn delicious. Coffee, dark chocolate, and amazing are the major flavor notes, this thing is chewy like chocolate syrup. I don't want this bottle to end. I want to stop this review and enjoy it, soooo bye."
""
"Tasted in Scotch glass on 6/13/14. Also tasted it's little brother ""Old Engine Oil," and this is truly a grown up, aperitif of the original."
"This is an excellent porter, creamy, sweet, lightly roasted. It is just a joy to drink – the only down side is the poor head and lacing which detract from the appearance."
"Pours a dark black hue with a one finger Khaki head and some nice sporadic clingy lacing,the smell is roasted nuts,fruity hops and a real ashiness to it aswell,the feel is full bodied with above moderate carbonation and has tastes of milky chocolate,dark peated ashy malts,fruity earthy hops and finished with a taste of bitter coffee and overall quite a nice blend of bitter and sweet and would drink again cheers."
"O-I really enjoy this beer. It is substantial in both taste and feel. The creamy flavors pair well with the thick mouthfeel, but there is just enough char and roasted flavors lurking underneath to keep this beer from feeling lopsided. A very solid effort with an outstanding mouthfeel."

"Great beer. The flavours just work and it sings. Big beer but subtle too."
""
""
""

"EDIT: PAIR THIS BEER WITH SHARP CHEDDAR. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST DO IT ALREADY. I could almost cry it's so delicious."
""
""
""
""
"Pours thick dark black, not too much head. Aromas sweet coffee, chocolate, roasted barley, smoked meat. Flavors balanced with dark chocolate, creamy sweet malt and bitter coffee flavors. Feel and boldness of imperial stout with sweetness and drinkability of a porter"
"Very good beer. The flavors are quite tasty and the experience worth the price of admission."
"Solid B"

"Pitch black pour, dense brown foam that plunges and cascades into the rest of the body. Easily 4-5 fingers worth of head that really takes its time in receding. Sweet, rich milk chocolate in aroma, decadent with hints of darker chocolate. Flavor follows suit with a more semi-sweet chocolate presence accentuated. Like a dessert in a glass. The only qualm is the bitterness that kind of spoils the decadence of the chocolate profile. A small blip in an otherwise awesome brew."

"Pours a two finger tan head that fades quickly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Black color, no highlights. Light carbonation and medium-heavy bodied. Mellow chocolate nose and flavor is malty chocolate. Finish is bitter chocolate. Higher ABV is hidden. $6.49 for a 330ml bottle from Julio's Liquors Marlboro, MA."

"Overall a steady porter to lean on. My first impression was this is darn close to Ten-Fidy. Nothing over bearing and just a delight to spend time with. Truly decadent and worth every cent!"

"O - a bit of the alcohol spiciness, good burnt toastiness character, some leafy spiciness, overall an excellent beer. 4.5"
""
""
""
""
"O- A solid porter, very drinkable stuff and with some great flavors."
""
""
"O: A smooth beer with rich dark grain flavors of chocolate and coffee mixed with some dark fruit, a little spice and a burnt toffee character. A great after dinner beer that would pair well with a vanilla custard and fruit compote or any rich chocolate dessert."
""
""
""
"Taste-Dark roasted malt, chocolate, earthy hop notes, gently warming finish. Dark, rich and smooth. great character and flavor. A great match for a strong blue cheese. Excellent."
"i cant find this beer on the brewery's own site. i would love to see some more story on this. 9% abv and a great taste."
"mouthfeel- really full mouthfeel light carbonation."
"Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, marshmallows, vanilla, cocoa powder, and milk chocolate. Taste is much the same with char-like and smoke flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a fantastic smell and some really nice flavors. Definitely a step above normal Old Engine Oil in my opinion."

"Pretty nice big porter, has a great English quality to it along with a nice range of flavors."
""
"This beer poured out as a deep black color with a nice off white head on top. The head retention and lacing were really nice on this beer. The smell is very malty with a healthy aroma of chocolate on the nose. The taste of the beer has a really nice big bold roasted flavors along with a sweet chocolate backbone in there too. The mouthfeel is slick and smooth with a light carbonation. Overall this beer is very good. I would drink it again for sure."
"O- This beer has a nice complex dark malt flavor that is also well blended and very drinkable. There is a bit more carbonation as the beer warms but it has some nice character."
""
""
""
""
""
"An utterly fantastic experience."
""
""
"Just an altogether excellent beer, and an absolute treat to see out of a wooden cask. Very nice..."
""
"D - Solid stuff, particularly if you like fruity English ales. Might not have been worth the somewhat steep price tag ($7.99 for an 11.2oz bottle) bit it was easy to drink, with a rich and complex flavor profile."
"Low carbonation, but that was expected. Sometimes even in thick stouts where its expected the low carbonation seems to produce a sappy beer, that isnt the case here. The beer feels thicker than it looks. Wonderfully viscous as it rolls over the tongue. Its a genuine sort of thickness, not tacky or oily. Thats what impresses me most about this beer. Its pretty big and flavorful, but it seems so well brewed, nothing seems added or out of place. Solid in every way."
""
"Drinkability – Very drinkable. This went down too easy. I think this is another underrated porter from Harvieston."
""
"Heavier than mid bodied, but enough carbonation. Just about creamy. Only a little warming. Good, definetely worth a try, though I prefer the regular as well."

"3.9/5.00"
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
"O: This beer is incredibly drinkable—no traces of the alcohol whatsoever are present in the taste."
""
""
"Easily one of the best beers I've had to date."
""
"O: For such a strong porter, the alcohol is surprisingly well hidden. I found this beer to be enjoyable but very much a sipping beer and not a session beer."
""
"O - Despite it's high alcohol content, this still tastes and feels like an English porter. The alcohol is masked, making this beer very drinkable. This is a well crafted, delicious porter. In comparison, this is definitely better than the regular 'Old Engine Oil' beer."
""
"Pours black with just a hint of dark coffee brown along the edges. Small tan head. The aroma is molasses, dark stone fruit, chocolate and roast. It's sort of a beery bittersweet chocolate flavor, sweet but with a good dose of dark malt backing it up. Mild herbaceous hops. The taste is luxurious dark malt. Sweet, rich chocolate leading into a gently bitter finish, roasty and hoppy. Thick, velvety feel. Fills the mouth. Relatively low carbonation. It's a very nice beer full of dark malt flavor. Good stuff."
"ours jet black with a brown-ish head. In the aroma, a light roasted malt and sweet chocolate. In the taste, a quite rich chocolate taste, and a small alcohol in the end. Quite smooth and a medium to bigger bodied mouthfeel, with a note of alcohol and chocolate in the aftertaste. Quite nice, with rich chocolate and note of alcohol, yet smooth and tasty."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: this is a really tasty and chewy beer, although I must admit I would like a little bit less of the vegetal hop character present. Still, it's very good."
""
"Overall a really good beer but I'm not sure it's as good as the unaged version. The alcohol seems a little unbalanced but it is still much better than the average brew."
"4.0 D: I find this to be the best of the series, beating out the regular OEO and all of the Ola Dubhs. More than solid all around."
"O: Overall a very good beer that is not overpowering. Nice choice when you want something different."
"Poured at a good temperature and with a medium size, tan, foamy head that soon settled to some swirls and a ring plus some lace. Color (with the help of a bright light) is a clear, almost opaque brown black red. Aroma is a heavenly, volatile blend of coffee, malt, cocoa, dark ripe fruit, vanilla. Flavor's like nose, has good interplay between malt sweet & bitter, carbonic tang, and hop bitter plus a bit metallic. Body is good, full and decent carbonation. Finsih is like flavor, fairly long, and the barest hint of alcohol. Very good beer."
""
"Pours a wonderful thick black with wonderful thick head and great lacing throughout. Great chocolate and roasted grain aromas with a nice earthiness underneath. Excellent flavors with great thick and sweet and coffee like roasted malts and a wonderful chocolate flavor with a great slight earthy hop undertone. Extremely smooth and great going down with no discernible alcohol heat. Best... Beer... Ever."

"O- This beer is a very good example of a cask english porter. Very flavorful, robust, and truly a treat. FYI- $9 for a 10oz pour; $4.50 on T-Fr from 4pm-6pm during Happy Hour. Happy Hour @ Trapp Door is rocks."
"Okay... glad I got a chance to try it, but I want Harvieston to bring back the Special Reserve... I would like to try that again."
"Poured into a pint glass. Pours black with a two-finger length dark tan head that dissipates slowly. There is excellent head retention. Some lacing is left behind on the glass as the head dissipates. There are aromas of dark roasted malts, coffee, bitter chocolate, and molasses. There are lots of big flavors in this beer. Sweet dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, coffee, molasses, hops, and some dark fruits can be tasted in this beer. The alcohol is very well-hidden in this one. The flavors remind me so much of a good RIS, but I have to remember this is a porter. The body is medium and this is smooth and creamy. There is just enough carbonation to make this very drinkable. It goes down very easily. Despite the fact that this is such a big beer, it still feels like a porter. Overall, this is an excellent beer. I liked it better than the regular Old Engine Oil, which is also an excellent beer. This porter is big and bold, but doesn't forget it's a porter. This is a home run."
""
"Pours pitch black, nice tan head that lingers. This is a very drinkable brew. Very smooth, silky, not overly thick. Roasted malts, coffee, chocolate flavors, slight bitterness that lingers. This is a brew meant for a cask. Overall, a great beer, not overpowering, alcohol is very well hidden."
"Aroma has notes of chocolate, roast coffee and caramel. It pours a deep sable with a thick tan head. Scrumptious flavor has chocolate, quality coffee and malt notes plus hints of licorice and caramel. Lip smacking! Thick, smooth mouthfeel has a good amount of fizz and leaves a smoky, slightly sweet finish. You don’t have to be an engineer to appreciate this one."

"I had the regular version of Old Engine Oil awhile back and really wanted to try this when I saw it hit shelves in my area. Only passed over it once before finally submitting to picking it up. Decent price. Better than decent beer. An English porter that I adore. 4.5"

"Notes: Solid through and through, maybe nothing special but hits all the notes of the style with great dexterity. A tad too expensive with the import and all, but a nice brew."
""
"Overall, it's worth a try, at least. I won't be adding it to my regular line-up as I could see myself tiring of it after a couple. However, it's a very decent brew."
"After falling in love with everything that Harviestoun puts out, it is no surprise that I love this as well. Highly recommended."
"O: A pretty decent porter but way overpowered on the smoke. I much prefer the normal old engine oil."
""
"Poured into a Guldan Draak flute. Pours a very dark red brown, appearing pitch black in the glass. Nice half finger fine light brown head slowly dissipates into a film and ring with little lacing. Pleasant aroma of roasted and dark malt, molasses with hints of chocolate and coffee. Taste is dominated by roasted malt with light dark fruit, coffee and chocolate. Finishes roasty with a moderate suggestion of smoked meat that similar to Rauchbiers, but with more of a burnt quality. Not very complex, but flavors are well integrated and very pleasant. Medium to heavy bodied with creaminess. Light on carbonation, but enough to contribute to a good mouth feel. Alcohol is well hidden. A very nice smokey porter that is a pleasure to drink and savor."
"Price = $5.99 at Whole Foods NYC"
"It's black. I'm not sure if I'd say blackest, it's not a Zhukov or a Hunahpu, but I sure can't see through it. The aroma is roasted with a huge coffee component. The taste isn't nearly as roasty, with sweet caramel flavors dominating the flavor. Dark fruits struggle though a bit on the opening, with a bit of that roast hitting the tongue in the middle, but the sweetness really rides through, on the edge of cloying. It's really quite good though, I'm just thankful it isn't in a large-format bottle. The mouthfeel feels a little bit thin at first, but it does a nice coating and drying thing at the end. The drinkability is decent. Overall, it's a pretty good beer, but I don't really think it's better than the base Old Engine Oil."
"O: I would drink it again and I would recommend it. It's a fine porter with a lot of body and flavor. The only negative that I found with the beer, was the strong alcohol scent. It's odd that it was hidden in the flavor (in a good way)."
"D - The aroma is full of promising rich malt character and while those characteristics come across in the flavor profile they don't have the sort of complexity I might have expected. The sugary character is cloying in the end and while there is some hop character for balance it could use a little bit of roast to help push back against the sugar."
"O: On the whole, an enjoyable, easy to drink brew."
"11.2 ounce bottle. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention is decent, and there's a lot of lacing left behind on the glass. The brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and some molasses. It tastes like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and some burnt/charred malt. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit creamy and coating, and has a good amount of carbonation. I can't tell this is a 9% ABV beer at all, the alcohol is hidden very well. I think this is a good overall brew, I'd certainly buy this again in the future. Definitely worth trying!"
"Pours dark as oil pitch black with a nice thicket of mocha tan head forms fine even lacing down the sides of my glass. This is basically an imperial version of their standard Old Engine Oil, I would call it just that an Imperial Porter. Aroma is creamy with dark chocolate, sweet underlying molasses, mild fruit complexity some hints of raisin. Herbal spicy hops are evident. Flavor is big with dark chocolate, roasted malt complexity, a hint of coffee. A touch of alcohol with dark ripened fruits blended in really a very smooth big dark beer can't tell that it would be 9% abv. Mouthfeel is medium bodied mellow carbonation this beer works well, I'm glad it wasn't aged in whiskey barrels I've had enough of their beers aged in whiskey. They need to send more of their standard and seasonal lineups stateside, seems like they know how to brew a really good beer. Overall my kind of big dark beer roasted malts big flavors with almost no harsh qualities, highly enjoyable definitely grab some. Only 4.99 a bottle really worth it for the abv and flavor quality."
