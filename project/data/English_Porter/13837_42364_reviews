review_text
"Pours dark red-brown, almost black.  Only intense light permeates.  Extremely short-lived creamy-tan head.  Aroma is entirely malty.  Tastes much more like a hearty nut brown ale than other porters I've had.  Lacks the bitterness usually associated with porters and stouts (light bitterness usually achieved with coffee or cocoa nibs.)  Hop flavors almost absent.  Carbonation is mild, making for mellow sipping.  Very enjoyable."

"O: This is a great beer; I recommend Ale Asylum to anyone looking for an all around good brew."

"The chocolate does move beyond ""powdery"" and there is balance to it. It's a nice enough porter overall."

"As awesome as Ale Asylum is with the hoppier beers....I think they are struggling with the darker ones. The Contorter Porter is ok. The beer poured a nice almost opaque dark with decent head that left some lacing. The scent carried some earth and roasty tones. The taste was similar to watered coffee. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with subtle carbonation. Overall not one of my favorite porters, but for those who like a lighter porter....this might be for you."
""
""
"Overall: I picked up a single of this to try as I enjoy most porters. This one just didn't do it for me though. Thin feel and dry finish are the opposite of what I like in porters. I'll try some of the other Ale Asylum beers but probably won't return to this one."

"O - A pleasant porter and easily sessioned. More on the sweeter side, but not offensive. A surprisingly tasty brew and I'm looking forward to see what else this brewery has to offer."

"O - Contorter Porter is one of those sinister-looking dark beers that's no where near as aggressive as it first appears. It might not be immediately approachable, but this is a dark beer that's got good flavor without really packing a wallop or ""being too thick"". It's an easy-drinking porter that would fit right in with the English session ales; a few at your favorite pub wouldn't be a bad start to the night!"
""
""
""
"Overall: What it lacks in appearance and mouthfeel (it's basically a thin bodied porter), it makes up to a certain extent in flavour and nose- two rather related things. Not the most complex porter, but it is tasty and smells good despite having a watery, thin body. I liked its drinkability and flavours, but it does have a lot of room for improvement. (3.5)"

"Poured from bottle to pint glass this brew is topped with a finger fo tan small bubbled head. Weak retention but nice lacing. Dark brown with ruby highlights when held to light. Aromas of rich malt, chocolate, toasted without being burnt at all. Very nice aroma. Upfront taste is nice, chocolately malt with a silky mouthfeel. However this is a bit shortlived as the end note is slightly carbonic and lacks a malty full-bodied finish. Easy to drink with decent flavor. A solid sessionable english style porter that lacks depth but makes up for it in drinkability."

"O=4.00"
"O - Awesome english complexity to this beer sans oxidative properties. Great look to it, and pouring over with aroma. Taste had a thin feel to it that I greatly enjoyed. It wasn't really creamy nor sweet ++ but still had dimensions of maltiness to it. It did however have a finish that of a cigarette ash that was unusual. All-in-all a great interpretation."

"o - Overall I thought this was a really good porter; it was probably my favorite of the three Ale Asylum beers I tried that weekend. Easy to drink and a ton going on, worth checking out."
""
"pour is black with light tan head and lots of large bubbles. Nose is light fudge and chocolate cake, notes of tobacco and roast with a light green finish. Taste is much thinner, more roasted and leathery tobacco, thin finish and assertive carbonation. Not as put together and rich in the flavor but not bad."

"Contorter Porter isn't bad per se. That said, in the company of so many good-to-great porters, it's sub-par and ultimately forgettable."

"4.0 D: Tasty beer. This is how I prefer my porters, with a little girth on them."

"Bottle at Jordan's Big 10 Pub, this is a disappointment. I think I'm learning I don't like porters. Maybe a couple years ago before moving to Madison and getting Acclimated to the big full-bodied Belgians and imperial stouts. So I'm maybe not the right person to review this beer. It's just too light weight. I think it's the dark appearance that makes me want so much more -- I suppose if i were in Houston on a hot day I'd appreciate the sessionability. But it's 70 degrees w/ 0% humidity here in glorious Madsion."
"Overall a very solid porter, definitely worth trying if you are a fan of chocolatey beers but otherwise unremarkable."
""
""
""
"This poured out as a nice deep brown color, black in low light. The head was tan and faded rather quickly just leaving some light lacing on the glass. The smell of the beer had some big roasted burnt malt aromas blended with some hints of coffee and chocolate. The taste of the beer gives off a rich chocolaty start with bitter lager like note in the finish with some additional charred flavors. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and softer carbonation. Overall this is a solid porter, there isn't too much to fuss over on this one."
""
"O- Pretty well done. Just reminds me that I prefer stouts over porters but as far as porters go this is a great one"

"O- A well balanced porter"
""
"Bottle bought is Wisconsin. Pours black, with a thickish oily look. Bold chocolate and roast aromas. I got more chocolate than coffee in flavour. Both the bitter and the sweet came from the cholate. A good example of a solid American porter. Good drinkability, and way to end the meal."
""
"O: an average beer with above and below average characteristics."
"M - Light to medium body; slightly creamy. Moderate carbonation."
"An extra from a trade with TATURBO, thanks again man! This one pours out dark as night but with some brown hues on the edges. A small khaki head up top rounds it off. Real nice nose on this porter, making a statement with it's English qualities. Bready, nutty, chocolatey, and sweet caramel here. Big aroma in comparison to the taste though, that came up a bit short for me. Bready & chocolate forward with a carbonation bite in the aftertaste. No discernable hops to note tastewise, but I do get the bittering a good bit. Only complaint is that I wish the taste had matched the nose - rough to have a better nose than taste."
"O: Not very complex, but very good for what it is. Very drinkable and a nice winter beer, though it's still 40 degrees outside in Minnesota in January?!?"
""
""
"Another good beer from Ale Asylum."
"On tap at AA. Served in a shaker pint. Very Dark brown in color, almost black, but not quite. Served with only a minimal bit of almost tan head. Very little lacIng. Aroma is of chocolate and little else. Taste is of lightly roasted malts and milk chocolate with a watery finish. Medium bodied, but feels lighter than it is. Lower carbonation. Mild bitterness. A better than average porter, though a rather simplistic one."
"O- A nice porter. For whatever reason, maybe the chocolate notes and creamy texture, it really pairs well with a cold Wisconsin night and a warm fire. Be sure to enjoy on the warmer side to let the roasty notes shine."
""
""
"overall, this is a very nice example of the style. I think there are other porters out there that are more in your face, but this one is subtle and complex and extremely smooth. a very nice beer from ale asylum."

"O: A nice aroma to this and a fairly good flavor too, just a bit watery."
"O - very sessionable and has a wonderful nose but doesn't quite hit the sweet spot that SN or Founders porters do and the mouthfeel is somewhat disappointing. not a bad beer, not a phenomenal one either"
"Pours a deep black with ruby highlights around the lighted edges. Tan head lingers nicely on top for quite a while. Light chocolate and roast in the nose without much else, maybe a light hop note in the middle of the bready base. Smooth is the selling point on the bottle and the website description, and it is very smooth with little to stop it from going dryly off the back of the tongue quickly. Roast is light and lingers a bit on the tongue, but the thin body detracts from the overall taste. While a decent porter, it lacks enough depth to keep me interested beyond a bottle or two. Had the same beer on tap recently and it seemed to have a bit more too it then for some reason."
"Aroma is of coffee and molasses. Taste is similarly rich, with just the edge of bitterness and a light fizzyness. Molasses flavor dominates, but there's chocolate too. Not nutty or roasty, but faintly sweet... with no gross aftertaste. Mouthfeel is appropriately thin and not overcarbonated. A real classic porter. A solid and consistent A-/B+!"
"O: Good run of the mill porter. I would not seek it out, but would not turn it down."
"Overall a basic and conservative porter that will easily be forgotten."
"D - Decent stuff. I have had better but it was still pretty solid. I just wish it wasn't so watery. I really think I would have liked this one a lot more."
"This beer poured a black colored with a small tan head. The smell was very strong of coffee. The taste had alot of coffee flavors, but was also heavy and malty, a bit of a carmel flavor as well, but the coffee flavors stood out the most. Nice full flavor, espically for a porter. Overall a found it a good beer, and a really good porter."
"D. I won't drink more than one of these but nice on a cold winter night."
"Drinks terrifically. I could easily put a couple of these back. Represents the style well. All around, this beer is really well done with the exception of the head which I can live with."
"Pours a deep brown basically black with a small head and some lace. The aroma is some coffee, a little cinnamon, some roasty malt, some candy sweetness, a mild hoppiness, and something odd I can't quite put my finger on. The flavor is much like a delicious coffee drink with some mild sweetness, some fruitiness, a nice bitter hoppiness, with a good creamy character."
"Pours a nice black color, nice carbonation, little fizzy tan head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some very nice chocolate/toffee notes. The taste is sweet, malty, nice touch of chocolate/toffee. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very tasty English Porter."
"D: I'm impressed with this one, a good porter that relies on malty craft to deliver solid flavor."
"D/O- Drink two and call it a night...for this beer anyways. Would drink again."
"Taste is malty, sweet with some chocolate and a mild hop finish. Mouth feel is not very carbonated but clean. Drinkability is good with a nice clean finish as well."
"Really solid brew from Ale Asylum. The first two I've had from them have been fantastic, which makes me glad to be in Wisconsin right now."
"D: Big drinkabilty. I love Porters, and, this is a wonderful. A bit carbonated, and, no ""sourness"" associated with traditional English porters, but, a fine beer."
"Poured into a pint glass this brew has an oil like black color with a thin body and a bubbly (not creamy) light brown head that left moderate lacing. The aroma was of sweet caramel, subtle chocolate, and burnt malts. The taste was overly carbonated upfront, astringent to the tongue, and full of the burnt malt flavor. There was not much to come out from under the deep dark malt taste. Some slight notes of coffee and chocolate, but difficult to get to behind the heaviness of the roast. This was a little thin for the style. Not the best I have had, but worth a try."
"Inky dark brown body with a small, bubbly, sandy brown head. Not much lacing. Roasted malts, light coffee, and dark chocolate dominate the nose. Some minor notes of vanilla and charred wood. Grainy bitterness up front. Chocolate and peaty malt sweetness follows. Slight notes of coffee and oily, woody fruit. Moderate body with a lively feel. Not bad."
"D: Goes down very easy, a nice session beer for a cold winter night. A good example of an english porter. Well worth trying."
"Very drinkable as a session porter, just not very complex, maybe a good dinner beer where the food shines over the beer."
"Enjoyed on tap at Ale Asylum in Madison, WI. Pours a black body with a tan head that lasts. Aroma of dark roasted malts. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a low carbonation. The main flavor is sweet roasted malts with a very low bitterness in the finish. Very good drinkability."
"This really brought the roasted feel hard, with the type of burnt grains and coffee character that I really like in the style. The body could have used a touch more presence but for the most part, this was a one dark, tasty, and nicely drinkable Porter."
"Ultimately this beer gets lost amongst two world class Porters I have access to - Great Lakes Edmund Fitz and Founders. Still a worthy effort from an up and coming brewery."
"D- Very smooth for a porter, could drink all night."
" ~ The Contorter is another good beer from the Ale Asylum. My hats off to the folks in Madison for turning out a good, drinkable porter."
"Taste, unfortunately, does not live up to expectations. The first note is bitterness, which the chocolate coming up next, followed up by heavily-roasted malt, and ending with more bitterness. A lot of fizz on the tongue as well. I wouldn't want to have many of these in succession... I might have another beer, but it would be ANOTHER beer. I generally like my porters sweeter and more full-bodied than this one - not recommended."
"Very nice English Style Porter. the chunk of flaked malt floating in the beer were attractive to my eye, but may turn some off. Drinkability suffers as this beer felt a little heavy for a session, which is what a Porter was meant to be."
"D - Goes down easy."
"pretty good beer; one of their best, I think. Poured with a tan head and some lace. Opaque dark blackish brown. Nice roasty malty nose with a little dark ripe fruit, cocoa, coffee, a hint of vanilla and chocolate. Flavor is very similar and yet fairly dry. In spite of the richness it's fairly drinkable. But at the same time very full flavored so other flavors in my mouth clashed a bit. Nice finish with no off flavors. Not too boozy. Label reminds me of Thailand."
"D - This is a pretty good english-style porter. Easy drinking and tasty."
"Loaded with flavor and aromatics....this is an easy drinker and tasty porter."
"D: Nice roasted malt and chocolate flavors in the beginning that are squandered by the strange mouthfeel."
"D: Easy drinking."
"Overall, a solid choice."
"The body is moderate. There is a slick quality that could be diacetyl but I didn't pick it out in the taste. Overall a good porter, easy to drink. Thanks to flyingbison for the trade."
"Black beer with a thin brown head. Couldn't get much of a head even with a vigorous pour... The lacing is sporadic. The nose is full of rich chocolate, english toffee, coffee bean and caramel. Flavor comes at you with dry cocoa powder and muddled and muddied fudge tones. Some nuttiness accents. Slight roasted malt character. And a chalky aftertaste. Solid and unique in the flavor department. Medium body. Good drinker."
"Notes from and tasted on 7/23/07"
"Purchased at Steve's Liquor in Madison, WI on 08/01/08. Very dark brown with red hilites at the bottom. Smallish tan brown head that quickly dissipated in my SA glass. Roasty malt flavor with a slight fizz of carbonation. Some bitterness felt with some nuttiness. Slight hopinesss felt on the front end."
"I'm missing some grit, though, I'm wanting a bittersweet, espresso-like edge. If you're looking for an easy-drinking taste treat, though, don't pass it by."
"Ale Asylum has done a good job with Contorter Porter. While it doesn't venture out of the safe, cozy confines of the style, it's tasty as hell and is unlikely to lose its charm over the course of multiple bottles. In fact, I could go for a few more right now."
"I would recommend this beer. I bought this bottle at 3 Cellars in Franklin, WI."
"D: Quite drinkable."
"D- definitely a keeper"
"D-A solid English robust porter. Not much to complain about with this one."
"Dry roast malty flavors, some mild smoke, barley husks, and cinnamon (?) sweet and savory. Light feel to it, mild bitterness, definitely works well for session purposes."
"Light body, which is not exactly the way I like my porter, but that also added a lot to its drinkability; making it a nice summer choice. Taste is also dominated by cocoa and coffee, roasted and lightly bitter at times, but a bit sweeter than most. Nice."
"drinkability: easy"
