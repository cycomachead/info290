"Dark pour with thin tan foam. Heavy roasted aroma, turning chocolate semisweet in the sip. Light, clean finish. Pretty tasty!"
""
""
""
""
"Overall. Not outstanding in any one area, but an interesting mix of aromas, feels and tastes, pretty good as a dry porter."
""
""
"Overall a satisfying porter. A little thin bodied but great flavor and balance."

"Very good, rich with hints of coffee."

"Overall: one of the best porters I have tasted. The style can be lackluster in aroma and taste, and the body can sometimes be too thin. This excellent brew has character."

"Great full body, flavors of chocolate and coffee, good mouthfeel."
""
"The. Best. Porter. What more needs to be said? I live about 15 minutes from the brewery and get a growler of this about once a week. Beyond delicious, so well balanced, toasted with a little note of coffee at the end. Perfectly roasted!"
"mouthfeel is smooth and over all a good porter m"
"O-good flavor and lighter body, nice for the style"
""
""
""
"Very dark brown. Fully opaque. Forms a large tan head that takes a while to settle down. Leaves some spotty lacing on the way down. Aroma is dark toasty-roasty malts with some lighter notes of pine. Taste is comprised of deeply roasted malts, baking chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. Not sure if it is the age of the beer, but unfortunately, this beer is heavily over carbonated, giving it a lighter body than it should have and thinning out the taste. Overall, I could see this beer having potential, but the carbonation is far too lively for this to be a world-class beer."

""
""
"An absolutely delicious English porter. The high ratings are absolutely justified- it should honestly be rated higher and talked about more. Find this if you can, and drink a ton of it."

"A really well done porter. A must try in Mass."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I had high hopes for this, and it didn't disappoint. Fans of domestic porters should seek it out. It's a balanced, flavorful, easy-drinking porter that should please all dark beer fans."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very exceptional porter. Spot on for the style."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Spectacular English porter, easily my favorite so far. The current trend is towards imperials but it's nice to find a great ""regular"" porter/stout time and again."
""
"O: Very good porter. Not sure I'd take it over a Sierra Nev porter, Edmund Fitz, or Anchor porter but glad I had it."
""
""
""
""
""
"Hopefully Mayflower can work on expanding its distribution as only a few places in my area carry it. It was recommended by a bartender at Mondo's in Middletown when I asked for a dark beer. She served up a winner!"
""
""
""
"O: Great beer. Would recommend to someone looking to start a porter beer journey. This is definitely on the top of my porter list."
""
"D/O- Highly drinkable although the plus-roastiness may lead to palate fatigue after a few. Thanks for this ""Top 50 English Porter"" @mj0126 !"

"O - Excellent porter, lots of complexity in the flavor, it really just opens up from there."
""
""
""
""
"Overall a great porter - especially if you're going to have more than a couple. The watery mouthfeel and balanced subtle flavors allow you to toss a couple back without feeling weighed down and having your palate overpowered."

"O- this is one of the most drinkable porters that I've ever had, mouthfeel us so smooth and creamy that I could probably tackle a whole 6pack in one setting. Overall, awesome traditional porter flavors"
""
""
""
""
""
"Serving type: bottle"
"O - Good porter, but could use to be a little bolder in the aroma and flavor and a bit heavier. Wouldn't turn one down, but not on my list of top porters."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, one of the better porters I've ever had the pleasure of trying."
""
""
""
""
"O - Overall this is a lightly smokey very easy drinking English porter. Not bad in a pinch"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A strong stout with a good taste. Pours dark black with a semi-thick white foam head. It almost had a coffee smell and taste. The taste leaves you smacking your lips. I was told by a random customer that this was a good beer and he was right. If you are a fan of a really good stout this one is for you."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a tulip a dark cola-brown, almost black with a thin creamy tan head about an 1/8 inch thick which dissipated rapidly with little to no lacing. The coffee aroma hits first than follows through taste-wise and is balanced well with the chocolate undertone. A slight bitterness at the end leaves a pleasant puckering mouthfeel. Overall a solid and enjoyable porter."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
" make no mistake,this just a heartbeat away from the founder's porter.a very close second to that fabulous drink."
""
"The darkest brown, slightly opaque with a thin head that disappears into a spider web of bubbles on the top of the liquid after a few minutes. The smell is a bit nicer with a heavy dose of chocolate malt, a touch of roast malt and the balance caramels. Dark roasted coffee and bit of sweetness come through as well. The taste is also very good. As with any classic porter the chocolate malt flavor dominates. This is accentuated by coffees and roasty character. Bitterness is there as well but primarily from the malt with only low hop character present, typical of a good English version of the style. The mouthfeel is tight and a bit prickly due to some moderate to high levels of carbonation. The finish is pretty dry with just some of the roast lingering on the tongue. Overall this is a great example of the style, nothing overly challenging here just a solid porter, a style that is often overlooked or made with more hops. A good sessionable beer that you can drink all afternoon."

"O - Overall, a really nice beer. A porter that I'm happy to have on hand -- I'll happily pick up another 6-pack if nothing else on the racks jumps out at me."

"We have a dark brown beer with ruby tones, and a tanned bubbly neck that disappears fast. The aroma emanates coffee (very well pronounced), and chocolate. The coffee is also very present in the taste, with low fruit esters and discrete hops. The malt gives the idea of bread and toast, slightly caramelized, with a medium-light body. The palate is very oily, and has low carbonation, with - guess - coffee in the aftertaste. Very pleasant session beer, for sure, although I expected more caramel expression in the malt."
""
""
"One of the better local porters I've had. I will certainly re-visit this one again."
""
""
""
"Cheers!"
""
""
""
"A nice porter, very user friendly and satisfying. Nothing not to like, but nothing to really write home about either."
""
""
"Bitterish mineral notes and moderately roasted coffee up front. Cocoa and chocolate mix with tobacco and earthy peat mid-palate. Some flinty, smoke notes. Caramel comes on late, accented by licorice, vanilla, and molasses. Coffee and dark chocolate bitterness in the finish. Lingering caramel and vanilla. Medium bodied, with slightly prickly feel. Body feels maybe a pinch light for a porter, but still pretty good. Might be transcendent on cask."
""
""
""
"Still, I would recommend this porter to someone who has never had one."
""
""
""
""
""

"I've been intending to review this for a while. I've had samples of it on a number of occasions, and it's always been exceptional. It's not going to blow any minds, but it's a very tasty porter, especially for the surprisingly low ABV."
""
""
""
""
"Well done"
""
""
"Overall: This is a very delicious porter and an excellent example of the style. I'd recommend to anyone who likes an English porter that is done accurately. Good brew and I will definitely buy again."
""
"O: This porter does not mess around. Compare w/ Otter Creek's Stovepipe Porter"

"Mayflower Porter requires no ""further search or consideration"" - it was obvious right from the outset that this is a world-class porter through and through. When it comes to brewing hearty porters no one yields a sharper bayonet than the Americans. It's hard to find anything to nitpick about in this quintessential robust porter."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a tasty brew. Mayflower porter is a nice traditional interpretation of the style. What I really enjoyed about this beer was the slightly smokey, dark chocolate aftertaste. Worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It has nice and not over-powering smoky and chocolate flavors. The aroma is subtle but pleasing. I also feel a nice bitterness from the hops on my tongue. This beer is nothing extreme but it is a very nice balanced porter."
""
""
"The best American ""English"" porter I've had. Absolutely phenomenal, all the flavors pop."
"O: A fantastic beer of this style that I will most certainly drink again."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Highly recommended."
""
""
""
"O: A very solid porter across the board. Very balanced and the drinkability is solid as well."
"The taste is full of burnt coffee and burnt toast. There is a slight bitter hop finish. The taste is flavorful and hits the roasted drinkable porter spot. This drinks nice and light, with sharp carbonation."
"The body is robust and silky with soft carbonation. Real enjoyable here. Well made and solid all around."
""
"Taste is chocolate milk shake and some herbal flavor just for some tang. Good medium body. Great porter. I really like this beer. Real respect for the style and the gives me the impression that this is what a style of this sort tasted like way back."
""
"M: creamy, rich and extremely drinkable"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Beer is medium in body and has some coffee bitterness at the back of it, decent body throughout the palate and a nice finish. A good beer for sure."
"Appearance is dark brown, a small tannish head, a pleasant look. The nose on this porter is oatmeal, malts, some coffee and brown sugar. Its` taste has earthy grains, chocolate, malts and chocolate continue to make their presence known here. Mouthfeel is light-medium, a very easy drinking porter. A solid beer from this small brewery outta Mass."
""
"O: Very, very solid. Good representation of the style. Always awesome to have a world class porter readily available. Hell, the brewery is a 20 min drive for me!"
""
""
"Pours black with a good light mocha head and plenty of lacing on the way down. Thin cap for a bit. The nose is really nice with plenty of chocolate along with a good roast balance. Slight coffee in the background. The flavor isn't as well melded. Too much roast there. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Pretty good."
"The beer is dark brown, nearing black, with a quarter inch of beige head. The aroma brings roasted malt in the English style, toffee, dark fruits, hints of chocolate. The flavor brings toasted malt, roast, alcohol, toffee. Pretty tasty. Medium to light bodied. Overall, very drinkable and tasty. Would happily throw back a pint of this on another occasion."
""
""
"O: This is a delicious porter, and it's easy to drink lots of it."
"Not a complex or nuanced beer, its pretty straightforward, if you're an old school English brown ale fan, you'll be all about this. Really tame. The further you go east, the more likely this beer will be raved about it seems. Decent stuff, thanks to whomever threw this in as an extra, a nice change of pace, decent palate cleanser for when drinking the heavier beers."

"thanks to cbeer88 for sending me this beer!"
"Definately a great porter. great overall except the mouthfeel. This would probably be great a little colder and thicker."
"Overall very good porter."
"Overall: Really nice offering, and certainly worth the asking price if it's below $10 a sixer (I have no idea what this costs out east). I can't quite put my finger on WHY I don't absolutely love this, but I don't. Nonetheless, a really tasty porter."
"This is everything a man wants in his porter. Beefy roasted malt, nice balanced hop flavor, lighter in body without sacrificing big strong flavor. You show me a man who doesn't like this beer and I'll show you a man who should take his popped collar and go order some Bud Lites. It looks good, smells good, tastes good. Mayflower did it right when they picked out this recipe."
"Overall, this is an excellent porter, though I suspect many will find the flavors more stout-like in their pronounced bitterness. Still, the brew is nuanced, finely crafted, and quite delicious."
"This beer pours a dark brown color with a nice 1 1/2 finger tan colored head. the smell is slightly roasty with a good hop presence. the flavor is a little hop flavor up front, kind of floral, followed by a slightly sweet roasty malt flavor and finishes with a tiny hop bite. the mouthfeel is a little fuller than i would expect for this style, but the carbonation is just right, overall this beer is absolutely phenomenal."
"O: Had been sitting on this one for a while and now wish I had opened it earlier! Will have to grab some more of this next time I am back up in MA."
"O: Goes down well. Would drink another."
"Overall, a great traditional porter that stays true to its roots. Very impressed with this brew as it is one of the lighter colored porters I have had and doesnt compromise flavor."
"Pours a tar like black with a small, quickly dissipating light brown head. Aroma of sweet milk chocolate and faint roasted coffee notes. Flavor begins with sweet chocolate notes. A bit of roasted coffee, molasses and a nice smokiness round out this perfect example of a porter. Great smoothness. Well rounded and again, just a classic example of a simple porter profile."
"D: Very drinkable. A good little above average porter."
"D - this is an outstanding porter. Really nice flavor profile that is balanced and delicious. I would drink this often if it were available around here. Good introduction to this brewery."
"Starts off with great smells- roasted coffee beans, baker's chocolate, and surprisingly a little booziness for the lower ABV. Standard porter appearance- dark black with little opacity, tan head with little lacing. Medium mouthfeel, actually a little waterier than I expected. Tastes similar to smells- some coffee and chocolate in the background with a distinct roasted maltiness and hints of annis. Bitter smoky finish that doesn't linger. I enjoyed this one- a solid porter that goes down easily."
"This is a nice porter. Well worth it to pick up a sixer of."
"D: Very much to the style. Sessionable abv, smooth (eventually) but not creamy mouthfeel, and loads of roast. Very nice!"
"Poured a dark brown with an averaged sized frothy light brown head that was mostly lasting and had excellent lacing. The aroma was light of roasted caramel malts, a sort of barnyard scented yeast and strong notes of coffee and dark chocolate. It tasted slightly sweet and quite flavorful with notes of coffee and caramel at first and then a bitter sweet chocolate/coffee flavor engulfed the taste buds and stayed with you for a nice little while. Mouthfeel was medium to full in body and a little oily in texture with a nice soft carbonation. Overall a nice straight forward Porter."
"Good stuff!"
"drinkability is great. nice balance. good depth. tasty!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low to medium carbonation. Pretty smooth going down, almost a touch more American brown like than English porter, but I dig it. Thanks Russ!"
"This beer is absolutely wonderful. The perfect porter! I've been drinking Mayflower for a few years now and I like their others, but my love always lies with the porter. The appearance is dark and the smell is of light coffee and hints of dark chocolate and some good hops. A nice full mouthful with a great hoppy finish and dark chocolate aftertones. Like I said, perfect. The way porter should be."
"D: A solid Porter. Would make an excellent go-to and session style brew."
"D- A quintessential ""sessionable"" porter. Moderate ABV, smooth pleasant flavors, refreshing. As it has sat and warmed here in the glass, a smoky flavor, from the nose, has developed."
"D: The strongest ale of the evening but you'd never know it. A nice porter."
"d- I overall really like this beer there are plenty of breweries out there trying to do what this brewery did with this style."
"Sometimes I don't want big beer, though not that often anymore. I am also trending to darker brews, so this one is the prefect fit when I want a sixer. Deep dark brown with a good head and nice lace. The smell is well balanced chocolate, coffee, and roast. The taste is the same. Very well balcned and drinkable! Mayflower rules!"
"Medium bodied and slightly smokey with plenty of roasted malt flavor. Hints of chocolate, hazelnut and caramel. Decent balance of sweet and roasted notes with a bone dry finish."
"Drinkability is quite high with this one. A lower ABV and a lighter body would probably allow for more than a few of these in one sitting."
"D - Drinkability is moderately high. The flavors are nice and bold, but the watery, bitter finish detracts a bit."
"love this style and love this one."
"DB- A good porter with a very nice roast malt feel. An example of the style that I think anyone who likes roast characters in beer would enjoy."
"Bottle. Pours a dark brown color with a nice light tan head that quickly settles to form a nice collar around the glass. The aroma is light roast coffee, dark chocolate, and leather. Medium mouthfeel. A balanaced taste between the roast coffee flavors and the sweetness from the dark chocolate notes. Slight leather with a hint of smoke as well. Slight bitterness lingers on. To me this is slightly bland upfront. Easy drinking though."
"Notes: This is a very solid porter. I was blown away when I first tried it, and now it has become an old familiar friend. I probably buy more of this than any other beer on the market. That's saying a lot, being that I'm a promiscuous drinker by nature. This is one one of the better porters out there, and very well crafted. It flies off the shelves here, so I always make it a point to grab some when I see it."
"A deep brown, opaque with tan hues on the edge. A nice head with good lacing. The nose has brown bread, molasses and a touch of chocolate. A very complex taste follows, brown breads, chocolate, molasses, some slightly roasted nuts, a touch of acrid bitterness and some sweetness. A very smooth and creamy with a good carbonation. A very drinkable beer worth a session."
"drinkable - yes."
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. Black with some light brown tint. Aromas of smoke roasted grains. Hints of of earthy notes as well. Starts of with a burst of burnt almonds. Plum and raisin also dominate the palate. Finishes off quite smooth with lingiring smoke after taste. Well done porter."
"D: Excellent beer. This one has got me wanting to revisit this style as the weather cools off."
"Quite possibly a perfect Porter, by modern-day standards. What we dig about Mayflower's version is that it leans toward the English style, which tends to be more balanced, well-attenuated and sessionable. Delicious!"
"D: Superbly drinkable, as in 'gone too quickly'. Rich and savory, it's a porter I'd absolutely seek out again. Excellent example of the style."
"The beer pours a dark brown/black color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry, roasted malt scent along with some excellent crystal/chocolate malt notes. The taste is great! It has a very enjoyable black and chocolate malt flavor. It has a nice roasted feel with a balanced flavor that boasts of crystal and chocolate malts. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is a tremendous porter. It's full of character; a fine session ale."
"Pours a deep ruby brown color with a thick tan head with good retention. Strong smells of roasted malt, smoke, and chocolate notes. Bitter hop taste noticable coupled with dark roasty malts with some coffee notes. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with limited carbination. An excellent and unique porter on par with Fullers."
"This beer finishes well - much more beautifully than it begins. Every fortnight I get the 'malt shakes' - when this happens again, this will probably be the beer I pick up."
"Overall a very good beer, probably won't buy it again exclusively because of the high price though."
"D - An excellent porter. It's right up there with Fuller's as one of my favorites. Mayflower continue to deliver quality stuff."
"Big Mayflower fan. Good brew."
"I have been avoiding porters with the heat of summer lately and found this offering to be very enjoyable. Very solid example, I would drink this again if given the chance."
"I am happy to try this beer. Everything deserves a chance and this beer is miles above some trash I've slurped down in my day. However, I will not be looking for this beer again. I will not order this beer if I find it on draft out and about ( maybe I'll sip it a few times if someone else orders it ). I put it as a suitable craft beer, but not a good craft beer."
"A nice, enjoyable porter overall."
"Wow. My new favorite. At first sip can taste the malts which are outstanding, but I am blown away by the body. Mayflower has created a new gem. I expect a porter with this taste and feel to need an 8-9% ABV in order to carry it off, but to manage this with only 5.5% is amazing. The only problem I have with this issue is finding it; is constantly sold out locally."
"Pours a two finger light tan head that fades slowly to a ring leaving some lace. Light carbonation and medium bodied. Black color no highlights. Nose is roasted chocolate. Flavor is roasted, almost burnt chocolate. $1.85 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA."
"Mid bodied and easy drinking. Carbonation seems sightly high on this bottle but it doesn't seem to be a problem. This brew was a surprise gem and I hope to see it again."
"D: Wow. One of, if not the, best porters I've ever had. And at 5.5%, I could drink plenty more. Remarkable."
"Mouth / drinkability - A little more crispness here would go a long way I think and would take both the feel and drinkability to the next level"
"Dark brown with clear edges. A modest cap of fine, light tan bubbles appeared during the pour and settled to a collar and thin surface coat over a few minutes time. A bit of spotty lace. Malty aroma, caramel, charcoal or perhaps a hint of smoke, nutty, milk chocolate, faint dried fruit, a bit of bread and dry yeast. Balanced towards sweetness with moderate hop bitterness throughout, fruity and malty up front, brown sugar, charcoal, toffee. Lingering bitterness and herbal hop character. Medium bodied with ample carbonation, slightly astringent. Overall, a decent beer that I enjoyed."
"Notes: A great English Porter a good example of the style. Cheers."
"This is great porter with a nice mix of sweetness and roasted character which makes it extremely drinkable and complex at the same time. Excellent beer."
"Overall. The body of the beer is medium and the finish is medium full. There is a slight off meat flavor in the beer. The beer has a lot of good qualities and is very tasty."
"D: This is just a fantastic beer. I was thoroughly impressed by this and would have no problem opening another one of these."
"Feel/Drink: Nice creamy mouthfeel. Nice and smooth. Drinkablity is superb."
"Appearance is a very dark brown nice and creamy, very full looking while pouring it. Leaves a thin bubbly head with some lacing on the glass. Smell is malty, milkduds and some roastiness, slight burnt coffee and a slight woodsy quality. Taste is where this beer shines. It tastes damn good. Small hop bite with coffee notes. Some chocolate and again milkduds. The mouthfeel is very creamy, with a nice dry finish. Drinkability is high and carbonation is smooth, letting you focus on the flavors. I wish I had more to enjoy. A very nice porter."
"Flavor has a nice measure of coffee, notes of chocolate on the back side...again...a roasted flavor is large. Creamy, light body. More roasted malts, toasted barley...pretty tasty!"
"D- This is a well crafted porter that I think more people should try. It's not a heavy hitter by any means but in the long run it is a well made craft beer. Sessionable and enjoyable."
" An excellent American made Porter in the English style!"
"We did a porter tasting with some of the better rated ones from this site. Side by side, this did not impress. The color is almost straight black but there is a slight dark brown/purplish hue. This has very little lacing and head. Looks like a pepsi. I am getting a faint amount of roasted malt in the nose and a small bit of dark fruit, nothing special. The taste is fairly dry and watery. There is good balance for sure between hops and malt. Overall it is very thin with not enough flavor for us as compared to some others. Try the IPA by MAyflower it is solid."
"Overall, I really enjoyed this beer. It represents the style well and is drinkable. I am very glad I got to try this beer and I could easily drink another. Everything just seems to work well this beer. It is simple, but complex at the same time. Worth a try."
"The finish is very dry; almost too dry for my taste. Drinkability suffers for this but it's good for one."
"The beer is medium bodied, full flavored and well carbonated. There is a nice dry finish and the alcohol is well masked by the flavors, as it should be for a nice sessionable porter."
"I could easily finish off the six pack I have and still want more. This is a great session beer. A great example of a basic porter."
"Another impressive beer from Mayflower. Glad to have it."
"i can't believe i havent reviewed this yet. Mayflower Porter is my favorite of their lineup, great dark color, with a nice tan head that sticks for a while. Roasted malt flavor, with nice subtle notes of coffee and dark chocolate. tastes similar to Fuller's London Porter, which is saying alot-- because i consider that to be god of all porters. the porter which all English style porters should strive for, and this brew nails it"
"Next review!"
"Very drinkable. Light and easy to drink but so full of flavor. Definitly on of my top 3 favorite porters. At 5.5 ABV, this makes an exceptional session beer."
"d- easy sipping, really smooth and light. could easily throw a lot more than 1 or 2 of these down."
"I would put it up there with Smuttynose as one to try."
"Drinkability was decent for one, but I wasn't raring to have another. This wasn't bad - but I was a little disappointed."
"This is a fantastic porter. Goes perfectly with a dessert. Highly drinkable because it's not too heavy."
"d - this porter is rich and deserves to be drank next to a warm fire. this beer is without a doubt rich and complex but in a very simple way. i could easily put down a few of these on a cold night."
"D- To me this is exactly what an porter should be. Very easy to drink and a great flavorful alternative to my favorite lighter session brews. If I had access to this it would frequently be in my fridge."
"12oz. bottle served at 51 degrees in my SA Sensory Pint. No freshness dating indicated on the bottle. Poured the color of cola with some deep red, almost brown highlights when backlit. Pour revealed a frothy/sudsy two inch, khaki-colored head that crackled and popped as it slowly receded into a fairly consistent quarter inch cap with thick swaths of lacing revealed during the tasting. Nose off the bottle pop was coffee, roasty and perhaps a hint of smoked meat a la rauchbier. Nose in the glass is a bit more subdued - light coffee aromas and something else hard to tease out; maybe a hint of lactose and something else...Taste follows nose - smoky character definitely remains, but I also get a slightly metallic quality as well. Mouthfeel is medium-light with carbonation levels that approach prickly; however, this beer is also a bit gassy. Not a bad porter by any means, but a little too much CO2 happening here. I might have to try another bottle as some small beer stains on the label might be indicative of an off bottle."
"The body is light to moderate, just like the carbonation. It doesn't do much on the palate but it doesn't get in the way either. This is a very good beer overall. I see this working well with a good steak, or a few relaxing pints."
"D - More drinkable than I may give it credit for, I just can't really do much of these."
"Very, um...colonial? This is a much better beer (A worthy) on tap IMO."
"D - Very drinkable with a nice complex porter style flavor profile. This is a very nice interpretation of the porter style and one that would be great on a cool autumn day as a session beer."
"Damn good drinkability. Good flavor, not too strong, complex. Worth a try and wish I had some more!"
"Quite a treat, not just because it's very good but because it presents a number of unusual flavors. A very thick head, all-but-black color and aromas of toast, roast beef and celery, and even burning electrical wires (not bad, in my book). It has a dense body with moderate fizz that burns a bit on the tongue; there's much complexity in the taste but prominent flavors are roasted nuts, caramel, more celery, wet earth, sausages and perhaps roasted potatoes. Dry finish with a mild tilt of bitterness at the end. Not the greatest American porter I've had (that honor goes to Berkshire Brewing Co.), but unusual and excellent nonetheless."
"Pours a cola black with thin ruby outlines when held up to the light. A light and fluffy two finger khaki colored head slowly crawls down the sides leaving a good amount of stick. Aroma is damn good; molasses, coffee beans, and some licorice first off. Underneath the sweetness is a touch of gritty hops and light smoke, good stuff. Taste starts with roasted coffee beans and smoked malts. Midway a touch of dark chocolate and brown sugar balance out the tongue. Aftertaste is pretty dry with roasted grains slightly sweetened with a touch of vanilla. Soft light to medium body with a creamy feel and a prickly carbonation. Very drinkable, I'm starting to appreciate porters more and more, and this is just another stepping stone. Great representation of the style, I need more. Hey Aliza, more please, TIA."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonatin, nice one-finger creamy tan head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some chocolate/toffee/caramel notes. The taste is sweet, malty, lots of dark stuff. Medium body. Drinkable, this is a very tasty brew, all the Mayflower's I've had to date have been very tasty."
"I could almost have this with breakfast or with a hearty steak. Please try this one out..."
"Molasses and chocolate in the aroma, even a hint of dark fruit. Quaff has subtle notes of gritty burnt bread amongst the dark malt backbone. Tad thin bodied, but it drinks well on this cool July evening in the Midwest. Not tasting any sour ale as a porter should have, but it nevertheless is a tasty treat!"
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation."
"Definitely take a chance on this Porter if you get the opportunity as it is delicious. Nothing but quality in this beer and all of the aromas and tastes prove that. Great job on your Porter Mayflower!"
"D.. Very easy to drink. A good porter by any standards. Worth a try if you can find it."
"D - This is a nice representation of the porter style. Nice mix of sweet and bitter."
"Very good beer, great example of a well-executed porter. Is this so hard? Why can't more brewers get this style to taste so good? My first Mayflower & I'd be happy to sample another of these or anything else their peddling. Props."
"This beer pours a beautiful deep dark brown with slight ruby highlights when held to the light. A nice creamy 1 finger thick tan head with nice retention leaving thick sticky lacing on the glass. Nose is of mocha, toffee, coffee, and chocolate and some mild hops. Taste is of rich roasted malts at first, then a nicely mixed caramel malts with toffee and chocolate, and finishes with a nice coffee flavoring, some bitterness is left on the tongue in the aftertaste. Medium bodied, medium to high carbonation, rich creamy feel at first but the carbonation lightens this beer up. This is an extremely drinkable beer - this is one for an entire evening."
"This beer poured out of the bottle with a very dark brown almost black color. There was a nice rich dark chocolate aroma. The mouthfeel was nice and full. There was a nice chocolate taste with a mild bitterness and dryness in the finish. The after taste was a nice balance of bitterness and sweetness. This is a very good beer."
"This porter pours an opaque black-brown color with creamy, brown foam that persists and clings to the glass. The smell is a nice, roasty malt aroma with hints of coffee and cocoa. The taste has cocoa and light coffee. There is a touch of sweetness but it is dry overall. Bitterness builds to the finish, passing a touch of light fruitiness in the middle, and ending with dry coffee and chocolate overtones. The mouthfeel is smooth and dry with medium body and good carbonation. This is quite a nice porter!"
"D: Infinitely so. Darker and more flavor-packed than a boring brown ale, and lighter on the stomach than most stouts - this beer is great with a steak or solo. A bit too much of a punch to be sessionable but the strong flavors make this a perfect slow drinker that you will savor to the last drop."
"This is a fine session beer. It's very flavorful and not overpowering, yet it's not a beer that grows bland after you've had a couple."
"D - Very tasty porter - would love to try this on tap or cask."
"D - This porter has a lot of character, which I enjoyed. The flavors are quite pronounced and lively. This is definitely not a boring, run of the mill porter."
"Reviewed on phone"
"Drinkability: This to me is typical Mayflower. They take a style, analyze it, and do it very well. That being said, it does not push the boundaries of its style. For an English porter this is excellent and I could drink six. I would love to see Mayflower do some more extreme beers."
"On the dryer, roastier side all the way through. Against the back of the palate, features what almost is like bitter baker's chocolate, with a semi-sweetness like the sweetness from the smell. Finishes with an alcoholic flourish. Leaves a slight chalkyness on the tongue after it's finished. The flavors are there, but left sort of lifeless in the mouth. Worth it for the flavor, but the end presentation leaves a bit to be desired."
"A very good example of an English Porter. I wish this one was available around here."
"Pours black with brownish highlights and a thin swirly tan head. A bit of licorice and roastiness in the aroma as well as a slight coffee aroma. The taste is similar with maybe the barest hint of dark fruit at the end. Nicely balanced and the brambly fruit comes out a bit more as it warms. The tiniest bit thin in the mouth, but this also gets better as it warms with a bit of prickliness- just enough not to be unpleasant helping add some crispness to the porter. Quite solid, one that I would definitely drink were it local. Quite dry and fairly light and not as roasty as some, but very well balanced and with some nicely nuanced flavors."
"This pours an attractive dark brown with hints of red when held up to bright light. There are about two fingers of foamy beige head that takes an extended period of time to dissolve. It never really goes away. The aroma is smoked and of clean hops. It seems well balanced in that regard. The mouthfeel is better than medium and the taste is a little hopped but mainly smoky and slightly raisin-like. Overall a good beer and very close to what a well done English Porter should be."
"It went down very easy, with no harsh edges. Very very easy to down these. Overall, I liked it but was a somewhat underwhelmed. Perhaps it is because so much is overdone these days that we forget what a simple, standard, good brew can be like. I've had much better, and much much worse for the style. Still, I'd buy this again."
"A nicely drinkable porter, something I will probably have again due to the pretty good price it can be found at around here."
"Received this one in trade as an extra I think. Pours a dark brown with a thick 2 finger off white/tan head that faded after a while and left barely any lacing on the glass. Smelled a little bitter, coffee, roasted malts, stout-ish. Tasted nutty, Cold Coffee, Roasted malt flavors. Med Bodied. Overall a decent but not extraordinary beer."
"D - I wasn't impressed by this porter. It wasn't lacking really, but seemed simple w/ a basic malt profile. Simple is good, but to me it was lacking in drinkability. I wanted to try something else 1/2 way in. I should probably try a bottle later for comparison"
"I really love this beer. I will be drinking lots of this in the future. I am proud to have a local beer that I am this fond of."
"I love a well done porter, and this is a great one. Poured into my nonic tumbler and appears a very dark brown color with a healthy two fingers of creamy tan colored head. Smells of richly roasted malts, cocoa powder, and bready grain. Tastes of dark roasted grains, chocolate, caramel malt and a hint of coffee. Medium body and carbonation. Picked this up as a single at Julio's, wish I would have threw a whole sixer in the cart."
"Good body, good smooth feel and easy to drink. A fav style of mine and a great example. Love to have it again some time."
"Pours a very dark, mahogany brown color, with a large, dark tan head that left some nice lacing. Very nice chocolate aroma coming from this one, a bit of roastiness in the background and a bit of dark fruit. Lovely dark chocolate flavors, hints of coffee and vanilla, plus a good smack of caramel. Medium-full body, creamy, delicious. What can I say, this is a very good porter, bordering on great. I only wish I had more than one of these!"
"This beer came to me in the BIF trade and I am glad I recieved it"
"Overall: Well rounded porter with a classic taste that looks fantastic."
"D, notes: A really nice nose that doesn't quite carry through to the taste. A good session beer nonetheless."
"Tasty porter, thanks Jason K. Black body with good head of a thousand small bubbles, and lots of lace. Roasty, tarish, coffee ground, then complexity of chocolate malt. The aroma is sour, yeasty. Easy, smooth above average mouthfeel. Carbonation above average. Interesting."
"D - A good, simple beer with a nice flavor, and easy to drink. Hits the spot when you're craving dark malts and chocolate but don't need the alcohol and complexity of a big stout."
"Flavor is a wallop of hazelnut, cocoa and porter. Just a slight hop bitterness toward the back end. Some sulfur tangs circling the edges of the tongue. Flavors are more pronounced as it warms. Nearly full body."
"Ditto, thanks to Jay for throwing this in as an extra. This is a very nice all around porter. No rough edges. Pours dark brown with a centimeter of creamy tan head. Smell isn't very prominent, but dark roasted malts and coffee are what I'm detecting. The low ABV is hidden fairly well. You could have told me this was 7% and I wouldn't disagree. Tasty coffee and chocolate notes dominate the flavor. Fairly dry finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Overall a very nice brew."
"Overall, this one could combat with Edmund someday as this really has potential and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
"Cheers!"
"Pours a clear dark brown with beautiful ruby highlights and a creamy off white head that dissipates but never really goes away. Smells of chocolate and roast Yum! Tastes of chocolate, roast, and a bit of hop bite with a lingering roast in the finish. Creamy smooth mouthfeel, medium body, light but ample carbonation. Great porter! Smooth and silky and chocolaty. Must try more Mayflower."
"Because there is a heightened smoothness to this porter, the drinkability of this beer is great. There is a very smooth and crisp taste to this porter that works its way across the palate nicely."
"I like it to a point - has a basic outline that fits well enough, other than slight sourish notes underneath. A bit too smoky - going towards an English stout type of smokiness. The standard ""English porter"" is usually very ""sessionable", to me anyway. This one's not quite so."
"Steve"
"Thanks, donkeyrunner, for the opportunity"
"D: Very enjoyable, I'm glad I got to try this"
"Big thanks to mtgoat for a chance to try a new brewery and a good beer."
"The taste is delightful. The beer is modestly carbonated for a porter, is quite smooth and creamy, and has a very pronounced roasted coffee and mocha taste. The beer has a bit of a hoppy bitter punch towards the finish. There is a traditional bittering hop presence on the back end and it nicely complements the roasted malts in the mid section. There is a slight husky graininess to the beer as well. This is a nourishing beer, with a pronounced aftertaste of roasted malts. Worth seeking out. L'Chaim."
"Truly fantastic offering and on cask locally in Cambridge (Thanks Cambridge Common!) although the demand is outrunning the current supply. Perfect pint served straight from the cask, nice rich dark brown with lovely creamy tan head that stuck to the glass all the way. Nearly a stout by sight, and by taste, I'd definitely forgo a Guinness for this lovely. The aroma had a roasted malt-coffee-chocolate-molasses quality that emerged in the tasting as well. A slight floral hop hint with mild smoke lingering added to this extremely smooth and rich porter. Not too much alcohol tatse, and little carbonation definitely led to the stoutness of it. A pleasant bitterness to the mouth and a clean falvorful aftertaste that left one leaning for more!"
"Overall a really nice little porter I was very happy with., I would have no issue with trying this one again any day."
"Not overly complex, but it does play the dark malt note pretty well. There is not much in the way of hop or fermentation character here, which is definitely ok by me."
"This is a fine brown porter, there's no denying that. I could drink this all day/night/morning long."
"If you are looking for something more aggressive I recommend the Olfabrikken Porter from Denmark. This Mayflower Porter is a bit more of a sessionable porter with tamer flavors. I recommend it when you are in the mood for a smooth porter."
"Mayflower's Pale Ale is excellent as well. A very promising brewery. I believe the brewer is from Offshore on Martha's Vineyard. And they sure serve up some excellent ales there. Just sayin'."
"This beer is an absolute pleasure to drink. What blows me away about Mayflower Porter is its simplicity. There's plenty going on with the flavors of this beer yet they never bombard you, are heavy handed, or out of balance. That's exactly what an English porter is supposed to be. If you are tired of imperial or Baltic porters and would like something easy-going and basic pick up some Mayflower Porter and drink the hell out of it."
"Drinkability: Tastey and smooth - goes down easy."
"Solid, but not special."
"Sampled at a company event, which was refreshing because you do not typically find porters at company events. Poured by Drew Brosseau, Founder and President, of Mayflower Brewing Co, into an 8-ounce sampling glass. Pours with a small creamy head, dark chocolate in color with strong roasted coffee aroma...ahh smells so nice. The aromas come from the Chocolate and Brown malts. Peated malt is in there for good measure. While the porter is hopped to balance the malts you'll struggle to find hop flavor, and that's a good thing for English Porters. If you're considering trying a porter or are an anti-hop fan I suggest giving Mayflower's Porter a try."
"Pours a very dark brown with ruby hints and about a finger of light brown head that dissipates rather quickly. Aroma is quite nice, cocoa, coffee, and a bit of sweetness. Taste is quite complex, very enjoyable. Cocoa, caramel, toffee, and coffee are the most prominent flavors, there is no one dominant flavor, this is a very complex but well balanced brew. There is medium-low+ hop bitterness that is solid but I think this brew leans just toward the malty end of the spectrum. Good mouthfeel, medium-light body with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is pretty high. Overall this is a very drinkable beer that I thought was immensely enjoyable."
"The mouthfeel is ample with good carbonation and a medium body. Highly recommend."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a nice porter to drink for a long time if you're in the mood for the style."
"I really, really wanted to love this beer. But after having a few, it only hits a few of the notes I wanted it to. There's nothing wrong with it, and when it warmed a bit it brought out more complex flavors, but overall this didn't live up to my hopes. I appreciate the efforts of these guys and think the IPA is amazing, but this one just didn't do it for me."
"Pours a dark brown with dim amber hues peaking through when held up to light. Good caramel colored head along with good retention. Smells of lactose, milk chocolate, light roastiness, coffee, earthy hops, malty. Tastes lets in more roastiness, especially in the finish. Lactose, milk chocolate, caramel. The finish is marvelous with roastiness and dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is very silky smooth, perfect carbonation, and slightly dry finish. Goes down ridiculously well...making this amazingly drinkable. Color me impressed!"
"Another good one from the boys in plymouth."
"Got this in a trade with ralflord (I think). Dark brown, almost black, not quite. Smells decent, roasty porter. Slightly above average flavor, and very easy to knock back. This would be nice to have a sixers in the fridge. The only problem I had was it seemed thin."
"Bottom line: This is a *very* tasty and oh so enjoyable English Style Porter. I'm impressed with what Mayflower Brewing has done here."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Color was a very dark dark almost completely opaque brown that let in a little light. Head was 1 finger, mostly foam, but some bubbles and was slightly brownish in color. It lasted about 5 mins, clung to the sides, and left a small layer on top. Smell was like fabulous dark chocolate with a bit of caramel and hint of coffee. Taste was slightly sweet, a bit of cream, and slightly burnt cocoa. Mouthfeel started off a bit shaky, was slightly over carbonated, but that settled down a bit as it went on. It clung inside well. Very easy to drink, went down extremely well."
"I took a quick look at the brewery website before hitting submit. EKG hops and Peat malt. 5.5% ABV. Very nice indeed. This is really a very good beer. I'm blown away, one of the better porters I've had. Nice job Plymouth."
"Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1/2"" orangey tan head over the clear dark reddish brown brew. Head fades at a reasonable pace, with plenty of slow-falling lace. Aroma is rich and roasty. Taste is also roasted dark grain husks with a dry close. Mouthfeel is smooth and easy, and drinkability is superb. Something so drinkable yet flavorful is a rare find."
"Thanks Corey."
"D: Pretty darn drinkable."
"Picked up a six pack at Bauer for the weekend. Poured into pint glasses. Murky brown color, pretty decent sized head. Smelled like roasted coffee. Taste was very good and quite different from other porters I've had lately. Notes of chocolate, smoke, and pine were tasted. Delicious. As it's English style, I'll appreciate the fact that it was a bit thin in the body, but I prefer my porters to be a bit heavier. Very easy beer to drink, though, which counterbalances the light body. Another home run for Mayflower."
"Dark murky chocloate in appearance..small head. Smell- coffee, smoke, malt..very nice. Taste rich coffee, smoke...smooth and with great body. Mouthfeel..wow! Smooth and craemy, butnot losing a hop presence..exceptional. Drinkability...smooth, just right...not too light or heavy..exceptional."
"another winner from Mayflower"
"D: Pretty drinkable and a really nice english porter."
"This is a potent flavored porter. I imagine this was how Guinness got their start...sort of a super porter. One of the best."
"This is my first beer from Mayflower Brewing and I have to say I'm very impressed. This beer is very drinkable and would absolutely have it again."
"D - easy drinking, good tasting brew."
"I couldn't help but compare this one to my own English Porter, this one definately won in the feel category. Nice carbonation not too much, it is English, but not to little, it plays on the tongue with smaller silky bubbles. As to the thinness, it also did great just enough body to keep the flavors bouyed up, English Porters can be watery if the brewer allows them to be."
"D: You could session this, it is light enough with a small ABV (5%). Very tasty, one of my new favorite porters, and for me, easy to get right up the street!"
"Growler purchased straight from the brewery in Plymouth. Poured in to an English pint glass a dark brown, with rosy hues at the bottom and sides of the glass. Smell is of milk chocolate, fresh buttery cream, and a roasted note. Taste is smooth as silk on the palate, with more of the milk chocolate taste, and a faint roasted coffee. Mouthfeel is light, with the malt coming through most, but a nice kiss of hops in there also. Drinkability is the high point on this beer, as it makes for a complex session brew. This ranks as one of the better porters I have sampled in recent memory. A trip to the brewery is more than worth it, as this and all their other brews taste great. Or if you are patient enough, you can wait for them to bottle, and distribute to your area. From what I heard, bottling started this week. Cheers to this new brewery."
"I must say this was a pretty exceptional beverage. Appearance was dark black with a light, coffee-color head with eventual lacing. The best way to describe the smell was a definite ""icy", smoked feel wrapping around the strong mocha flavors. There was even a hint of vanilla I sensed. It was wicked sweet for my tastes with a soft, bitter aftertaste. Definitely strong on the mocha, coffee flavors. The mouthfeel, I felt, was a key to the success of the drink. A good solid body but wonderfully light and thin essentially. Allowed it to be enjoyed the whole night. Overall, an excellent porter."
"Surprisingly, this porter goes down easy and light. My mouth wanted more after my first sip, and I feel I could have obliged it a few more pints quite easily."
"Had on tap at Union Brewhouse. Excited to try it from a local brewery and one of my fave styles! Good looking beer- blackish brown with nice tan one finger head. Aromas of roasted malts, some chocolate, coffee. First sip has a wonderful smokey flavor. Then gets balanced out with the malty flavors (chocolate being most obvious) Medium to full body so it is pretty hearty for a porter, and a bit richer and smooter, also. Still very drinkable. Had about 3 the first time, and keep going back for more!"
