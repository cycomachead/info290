"If you don't know what an English style porter is, I encourage you to read up before trying! Not everyone likes a lighter bodied porter but if you're familiar with the style you're going to like this beer. This is a very well executed English porter with some tastefully subtle pumpkin spicing in the background."

"Overall:  This is a pretty tasty porter.  I like the roasted pumpkin flavor.  Iâ€™d certainly get it again next year."
"O - As far as pumpkin beers go, this one wasn't horrible and I wouldn't deliberately avoid it like I would most pumpkins; but overall, it's still just an average beer, no real aroma or taste that stands out, no bad tastes, just pretty generic"
"Feel: near full body; medium carbonation that may be a tad higher than optimum."
"Clearanced Six from Total Wine"

"Black in color, white head.  Aroma has a bit of the pumpkin pie spices - nutmeg, cinnamon.  Taste is a mildly roasty porter flavor, with again the mild spices.  Decent balance, the spice flavors are not overwhelming.    Medium bodied.    Overall decent for a  ""pumpkin"" beer, but I wouldn't necessarily seek it out again."

"Decent fall beer, subtle pumpkin flavor.  For me it's on the lighter end of a porter."
"Pours a chestnut brown with a rather large blooming light beige head atop,no lace is left behind.Mild pumpkin spice and chocolate in the nose.A little light in the feel,pumpkin pie spice on the palate with a hint of roast and chocolate.If it were not for the feel I think this beer would be very good,as is it's not bad.A little maligned in my opinion."
"O- eh...a bottom of the barrel pumpkin for me...just didn't seem to have enough going on.  Was hoping for a lil more malt to come through."

"You guys that keep saying it's watered down need to check your buds. The best beers arn't the ones that have the most intense flavor they are the ones that mix flavors in artisan way."
""
""
"Best Pumpkin I've had this year."
""
""
""
"Bottle pour. Nice nose, has some pumpkin spice going on, I was intrigued. Until I tasted it. There's not enough body here for a porter, and I wasn't convinced the flavor was pumpkin, and not just some random gourd. The finish is just meh. Not terrible, but not going to make anyone's list of top pumpkin beers."

"Overall: Disappointing. Falls short at being a porter and at being a pumpkin-anything, leaving you with an essentially characterless beer that leaves you scratching your head wondering as to whether or not this was the intended final beer."

"This beer has been getting shitty ratings. I was hesitant to even try a pumpkin porter. But, you know I really thought this was a good beer. Its really not a pumpkin beer and its really not a porter in the traditional respect and if you are looking to rate it on those parameters then you would feel disappointed. I however thought it was a good hybrid style. You get those porter notes, in there, but you also get the pumpkin spices. I did not detect pumpkin itself, if there is really any in there to begin with. You do get the spices, which I enjoy on a limited basis and this is a good beer to have one or to finish off a night of fall beer drinking. Is it the best beer I have ever had? No, but it is interesting and was better than it has been represented here, for the most part."
""
"The mouthfeel is too watery to be a porter, in my opinion.  You taste a hit a pumpkin, but the spices definitely overwhelm the rest, in a not so great way.  It leaves an unpleasant bitterness on the palate."

"Overall: it has a good look and some good flavor but to light and watery and not nearly enough malts to give it the complexity it needs."

"This ""pumpkin"" porter is almost too light to be a porter. Don't get me wrong, the flavor is very nice but a little on the light side. Plenty of pumpkin spices, almost too much and it overtakes the pumpkin flavor a tad too much. Overall, very drinkable but seems to lack a touch more robust and pumpkin tastes"

"this beer lacks the darkness of a porter i dont taste the porter i taste the pumpkin yeah so it doesnt stand out in a crowd vits doesnt out by it self its lacks a want vto come bvack to it its a shame it could have been wonderful  but the word you look for is lacking  this beer is lacking the great pumpkin taste that even  linus wont wait up for"

"O: An average fall beer from Starr Hill.  I liked their ""The Love"" beer a lot better."

"Lighter bodied than expected with an overwhelming autumnal spice presence and acrid burnt malt flavors. I'm not picking up any pumpkin at all, just burnt malt and dry spice. Lots of pepper, clove and ginger without much else on the spice front to balance things out. Also, the malt character is lacking sweetness with overly dry charcoal flavor. Hints of ashtray, burnt wood and charred toast making this beer intensely dry and unpleasant. Even a little bit of pumpkin or sweeter malt flavor would help this beer but as is, it's a mess of a beer that I dumped down the drain."
""
"Overall this is another variation on the pumpkin ale style which sadly does not have much pumpkin in it. If only the taste followed the nose this would have been an excellent brew. Since the taste falls short I am forced to rate this as only ""okay""."
"Appearance is dark brown with ruby edges and a finger of beige head. The nose has definite pumpkin notes. The flavor profile delivers on pumpkin but not as much as the nose might indicate. The roast profile is quite mild increasing slightly on the finish. This is tasty, but not terribly special."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall a decent try, the pumpkin quality itself is more evident on the nose, but takes a back seat flavor wise. Decent rich porter, bordering on stout quality with a good roasty coffee accent."
""
"Things started off great with a blackish body and one finger head that slowly died with lace patches. Smell is not bad but I don't think pumpkin and cinnamon, possible nutmeg, should really be combined with bready, roasted malts as it seems to clash. The beer is even worse when it comes to taste/mouthfeel in terms of clash b/c the sweetness one expects from pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, not to mention slight spice, seem to gets bulldozed over by a slightly boozy roasted and breadlike malt base. Finishes a little haggard and not something I'll bother trying again although decent idea."
""
""
"O: Overall I wanted more.. a so-so porter with a little pumpkin. I wanted a bit more richness, perhaps a luxuriousness to it, but it falls short on the base style as well as the pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: An interesting beer, that is worth a try if you like pumpkin ales. I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out, however."
""
""
""
""
""
"O-Great beer for a cooler than normal, over cast day in Fall."
""
""
""
"Overall, a pretty good beer. Not a lot going on in the flavor though. I could have used more pumpkin and spice. Still, it would make a good session beer.if care us taken for the amazing drinkability. I could down too many of these in a hurry."
""
""
""
"I have not had enough Starr Hill beers to go in with a closed mind, so I was ready to see if there was a good alternative to the regular pumpkin ales. The pour displayed a thin, murky-colored, porter that didn't seem that it would be exciting and my nose revealed that to be correct. Very muted, with some roasted pumpkin and maybe touch of spice and cocoa. Not much different on the palate. Very thin with little to no finish. Disappointing to say the least."
""
""
""
""
"Verdict: I think it was not bad, my first pumpkin porter to be exact. I like how the pumpkin doesn't crash your taste buds unlike southern tier's pumking. Not the best porter but definitely would have again."
""
""
""
""
""
"This pumpkin beer is a dark brow, almost black. The head is small, but a nice brownish tan. The smell is a medium intensify mix of spice and roasted malt. The combination is not usual, and the scents compete for attention. The result is good, but not great. The taste is heavily spice centered. It is a lighter beer, in body, than I would have wanted. It's not the kind of brew that I'd want many of."
""
""
""
"O: This one just bores me. While there's nothing wrong with it, there's nothing that pops out as being impressive, either. Basically it's a middle of the road, please the masses kind of beer that simply isn't for me."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: This beer is interesting, a little more porter than pumpkin but that is OK with me. It seems like this beer needs to be refined a little bit to make it a touch easier to drink - the spice flavors/mouthfeel make this one that you don't want to have multiple in a session."
"Not a Pumpkin brew, a porter that claims to be a pumpkin brew but all I really got was a hint of spice when i cracked the bottle. Pours dark and is a tasty porter, but again NOT a pumpkin beer. Mostly a chocolately taste with a thin head and full rich body."

"Pumpkin beer in mid-August? Don't mind if I do is what I said to myself when picking up a six-pack of Boxcar for about $8.49 here in VA the other day. The brew pours a deep ruby brown with a nice 1/2 inch foamy brown head that remains almost till the end. Smell is of pumpkin, malt, a little bit of spice, a hint of dark chocolate -- really nice combination. The taste is excellent - robust, really just a hint of pumpkin in this which makes it a nice choice for a fall porter. Could drink a good amount of these in one sitting. Always a positive."
""
"I think an okay rating from beer advocate is ridiculous! This is a well crafted beer! The fact that someone attempted a pumpkin Porter, which you don't see much, and did it without over spicing it and giving it an equal pumpkin and porter taste from start to finish deserves a medal!This is a beautiful fall beer from an outstanding brewery! Oh and beer advocate...Starr Hill now spells boxcarr with two R's."

"o: a little sloppy and/or gratuitous use of spice imo, not the best style application, but a drinkable effort overall, doesn't really combine to make it worthwhile"

""
""
""
""
""
"O- I was a little dissapointed in this one. Porters and pumpkin ales are two of my favorite styles but this beer didn't mesh them very well. I've had home-brew pumpkin porters that blow this one out of the water."
""
"Overall I can confirm this is an average porter with mild (if any) spice. Pass on it if you can."
""
""
""
""
"O - A really nice combination here. I'd say this tolerable amount of fall spices in this roasts brew is perfect alone or with a nice meal, on a cold day."

"I've eyed this several times before but always ended up buying something else. My Mom and her beau were in town for the weekend, and he loves a good porter; we thought we'd give this a spin. We bought a six pack and I think I can help finish it. But I don't think I will re-purchase it in the future."
""
"This was just average. While initially feeling balanced this got a bit too aggressive feeling the more this warmed up and in the end I just wasnâ€™t nearly as impressed with this as I was hoping. There are better Pumpkin Ales out there on the market right now."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: This is an odd beer -- not what I expected based on the description of a pumpkin porter. I got some porter qualities, but no pumpkin, and then there was the unexpected sourness. The sour quality wasn't bad, but I don't think it was supposed to be there -- my guess is that this batch/bottle got infected by a bug."
""
""
"Overall, a nice addition to the pumpkin beer lineup and worth a shot if you like the style."
""
""
""
"Overall, too smokey for my taste buds. The smell was the highlight of this brew. There are other pumpkin/fall seasonals that I prefer abd I probably won't try this one again. Cheers!"
""
""
"Boxcar doesn't work for me and the recipe should be tweaked in my opinion."
""
""
"O: Every year I think I have had every pumpkin beer, and every year I find six more to buy. I know that most will be okay, though not great. A pumpkin porter appealed to me beyond the alliteration involved; a porter with a touch of earthy or sweet pumpkin seemed like a good idea. And it is; well, at least the idea is not bad. The pumpkin is present, slightly, in the finish. Otherwise, the smoke of the porter takes over most of the flavors."
""
"O: This was a decent pumpkin porter â€“ I like the smoothness and flavors."
""
""
"Overall, just not pleasant. I might buy if I'm hard up for a pumpkin beer. This is too bad, as I love pumpkin beers and had high hopes for this. I tried it on multiple occassions, but it's not getting any better."
"Overall a medium bodied beer, very drinkable and a good seasonal fall beer."
""
"Overall, this is a decent attempt at a sessionable pumpkin alternative beer. A bit heavy on the roasted, bitter flavors don't work quite right with the pumpkin spicing. A more balanced chocolate malt flavor would have been a better complement. Wouldn't turn it down if offered to me during the fall seasons but won't seek it out either."
"O: Overall I was pretty bummed about this beer. I expected it to be nice, considering that it is a fresh seasonal pumpkin beer. I was looking forward to a porter as well, but I guess I'll be left at the curb on that one."
"Overall: Meh. It's not BAD, it's just not that great. It's a subpar porter but a decent enough pumpkin ale. I like the idea of making a pumpkin porter rather than a traditional pumpkin ale but I think it could be done better than this."
""
""
"Although this style is not my favorite, Boxcar is definitely my favorite Pumpkin offering so far. I'd definitely recommend it, but only with the graham crackers."
"O: Not a bad beer, but not a particularly good one either. The spices take a backseat to the malts, and the pumpkin is nowhere to be found. That being said, it's an easy drinking beer, and the smoky flavor and spices make it a pleasant fall beer."
"Overall â€“ A beer I certainly wonâ€™t go to again. The flavors had no compatibility/melding in this brew and resulted it too off a flavor."
""
"O: Although I marked it down slightly for failing to fully live up to the ""porter"" name, it was a tasty and refreshing beverage that came highly recommended from the beer cicerone at the store, and one that I'd recommend highly to anyone looking for a pumpkin beer. Sadly, I grabbed the last bottle on the shelf in the store, for I would have eagerly gone back for more of this excellent example of the style."
""
""
""
""
"o: I was wondering where Starr Hill was going to take this as a Pumpkin/Porter beer. I would not consider it a porter - almost no flavor of roasted malts, though obviously enough to make it dark. as far as pumpkin beers go, I divide them into two categories: spice-heavy beers, and pumpkin-heavy beers. This is a decent spice-heavy beer, though I think better described as a black lager with pumpkin spices."
"Overall- This is not really what I was expecting. I guess I was expcecting something with a strong chocolate taste that a porter usually has with a hint of pumpkin in it. Instead it just taste like water with cinamaon and nutmeg sprinkled in it. I am a little disappointed. This is my first pumpkin beer and hope I will find something better."
"O - Very nicely done pumpkin beer. Highly enjoyable"
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: a unique beer which is memorable but could be better. Overall a nice brew."
""
""
""

""
""
""
""
"O - A decent pumpkin beer."
""
"D - Enjoyable porter, but needs more pumpkin flavor to live up to the name. Still worth trying."
""
""
"Overall a decent robust Porter with a very nice aroma. Although there was more pumpkin and spices in the aroma than there was in the flavor."
""
""
""
"This one certainly lives up to its name."

"Thanks to travisnd for sending this beer. Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a very dark brown color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of pumpkin and spices. Taste is also pumpkin pie up front, some roasted malts, well balanced and tasty. Feels full bodied in the mouth and overall this is an enjoyable brew."
"The mouthfeel is thin and somewhat watery with carbonation being high. Didn't enjoy the mouthfeel for the style. bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall I didn't think it was a great pumpkin beer. The roasty, bitter flavors just didn't work well with the spices for me. I would have liked a little more chocolate, sweeter, malty flavors coming out of the porter instead. The flavors just didn't really compliment each other very well."
"With all the great porters/stouts out there, I won't be trying this again."
"O- Overall this beer is just ok. An average beer that gives alot of promise in the smell but not much in the flavor."
"D: Very tasty and very drinkable, ABV does not seem any more than 5%... Nice mix of pumpkin and coffee. Another good beer from Starr Hill."
"Overall: Not enough flavor and way too thin. I had high hopes for this one, oh well. If you're new to pimpkin beers or dark porters in general this isn't a bad one to try. If you're looking for some big roasted malt or strong pumpkin flavors, go elsewhere."
"O: This is one of those beers that seems more like a failed experiment than a bad beer. Not awful, just misguided."
"O: Not so great."
"Note to owner: I want to like your brews, I really do. As a DC/Virginia native, I'll give your brewery as many chances as I can possibly stomach. So come on, put your heart into and create something really special, like what you've done with your Monticello Reserve. Even if I personally hate it, I'm sure to taste the love and passion put into the product. Because as it stands, all I typically taste is mediocrity."
"Taste is an unusual mix of roasty malts and pumpkin & spice. Very flavorful, and lighter in body than expected. I was not sure how the porter would gel with the pumpkin, but this one works just fine. Enjoyable!"
"M: too much carbonation not very smooth or full bodied like i would expect from a porter/stout"
"O: I'm glad I tried this, but wouldn't go for it again. Tasty, interesting, a nice mix up from the typical Pumpkin fall beer. But overall, it wasn't great."
"Overall: The word 'unexceptional' comes to mind. It was good, but not great. I'd have it again only if it were on tap."
"Overall: An interesting idea that doesn't really come off very well, in my opinion, as the flavors tend to clash and the medicinal element adds an off-flavor that is disconcerting"
"Very drinkable. Not sure what the ABV is, but if it's any higher than 5%, it's hidden quite well inside of the deliciousness of this offering."
"O - The Boxcar is a nice seasonal from Starr Hill. While it's not the best pumpkin beer I've ever had, it is a nice twist and a welcome addition to the fall seasonal lineup. The only real drawback is the thinness of the beer, which is something I hope they work on in subsequent years. It is tasty though and something I'd have again."
"Deep mahogany in color with thin, disappearing tan head. Instant aroma of pumpkin pie spice with sweet malt, caramel, and vegetal pumpkin notes. Like most pumpkin beers, just perhaps a bit more roasty. The flavor is definitely more porter than pumpkin like, although there is a distinct and very tasty pumpkin pie aftertaste. Otherwise, roasted malt and caramel flavors. Medium body with a smooth, carbonated mouthfeel. I thought I would be disappointed like with most pumpkin beers, but this one is a pretty nice combination, especially with the great pumpkin aftertaste."
"O - Fairly absent of anything that could be construed as decent balance. I so very wanted to like this, but it wasn't to be. I'd love to be more of a homer for local beers, but this one is tough to take such a stand. BUT - They gave the pumpkin genre a shot and even did it with a less mimicked style (going porter), so here's to constructive criticism that inspires them to retool this for next year."
"Overall: Nice idea, and good try on it but just wasn't where I like a ""pumpkin beer"" to be. I could drink a couple in one sitting, but why would I? I feel like a quick dash of pumpkin was dropped in an average porter recipe."
"O: A pretty bland, boring beer with an odd tartness in the middle. Neither the porter nor the pumpkin aspects of this beer really stand out and it ultimately just falls flat."
"Picked up at Total Wine & More for $1.99. Had to try a Pumpkin Porter, but this was not such a great introductory."
"Pours black with one finger of light tan foam with decent retention. Aromas are entirely pumpkin spicy (cloves, cinnamon, etc.), but not the slightest whiff of anything that would tell a blind man he was sniffing an ale, which is a total failure in my book. Flavors are roasty and pumpkin pie like, with a typical porter finish. The majority of pumpkin ales that I've tried taste better than this, as do the majority of porters. In the end, the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Downplaying the spices and/or an intensifying of the primary malts would greatly enhance this beer."
"This has been getting great word of mouth in Virginia. I grew up down the street from starr hill, and they finally knocked one out of the park. Pours an appetizing dark brown color with a big creamy white head. Aroma is of nutmeg , cinnamon, and toasted malt. Taste is complex, with the roasted malt bringing out the pumpkin spices. Not as tasty as the smell, but still good. Mouthfeel is perfectly balanced to bring out the flavor. Overall this is a resounding success for starr hill. Great job guys and gals"
"O: The idea of this brew was definitely better than it's full realization. Still, it's a nice brew and an interesting take on the pumpkin ale."
"M/O: very well balanced beer. The pumpkin flavor has some nice flavor but the pumpkin really smooths out the bitterness of the porter. Great tasting and easy to drink."
"Overall an interesting brew. I would really like to see these guys push the envelope a little farther. Namely, I want more real pumpkin flavor."
"it was a good beer i was expecting more of a sweet pumpkin and spice taste but it was well balanced. I will buy this one again."
"A tasty porter, which would be even better in the fall."
"Pumpkin porter has been done before-- this one is unexceptional."
"Pours a very deep brown with a two-finger tan head and some strong spotty lacing on the way down. Thin collar throughout. The nose carries a good amount of spice, though it's balanced by some nice roasted malt and dark chocolate. Pumpkin character comes through a bit, though it's more from the spicing. The flavor carries some roasted malt and pumpkin-pie spice. Also there is a good amount of dark chocolate. Medium body with a nice cask carbonation. Slight spice in the finish. Well done."
