"So overall would I recommend it? No, there is not enough for me to recommend it. First of all this is not a Porter, its an imitation of it. Second is a bit watery. At 4,8% ABV it's very light. Wish it could be around 6 or 7 ABV. But if you are in a bar and wanna try a dark ale and this is the only option, why not give it a try."

"O- If you, like myself, are into craft beers and are thinking about picking this brew up, don't be turned off by the fact that Rickards is owned/made by Molson Coors. From what I've tasted so far, the Rickards line is far superior to its macrobrewed brethren in every single aspect. Rickards Dark is no exception: It offers a beautiful glassful of goodness that is incredibly sessionable(like any good porter should be). Do yourself a favor now and pick up a Rickards taster pack (like I did) and I am willing to bet that you won't be disappointing with a majority of the Rickards line."

"Definitely not like any porter I've had before, this ale pours more of a caramel colour than a solid black, with a one finger head that quickly goes away. Smells of dark bread and noble hops. Taste is sweet at first, with a finishing bitterness of hops and chocolate. Mouthfeel is thin and carbonated. Not a bad beer, but not a good one either."

"O - Not at all to porter style. A mediocre, overly sweet brown ale that doesn't really come together."

"Fetched a bottle from a Rickards mixed pack along with a Blonde. I used to drink a fair quantity of Rickards and this was probably my favorite of the brood, a brew that satisfied my craving for dark beers long before I really knew anything about dark beers. Returning to it now was prompted by a semi-sober quaff at a Halloween party and my managing to recall that there were some mellow pleasant caramel flavors lurking in there. Pours a dark reddish brown that sorta evokes a porter, but really not much else about this beer does. Its a dark mild or brown ale. Evaluation solely on the basis of style guidelines is therefore unfair, although one can fault Molson for marketing the beer as something its not. Blonde at least lands in the German pilsener ballpark. Dark is pretty foamy, probably around three inches of light tan head, and has a thinnish watery body that clashes with one's expectations. Aroma is mild, I get roasted malt, light toffee, maybe a little fruit like baked apple. I do not smell or taste much in the way of maple, which is probably just as well. Palate is light caramel/toffee, along with dry nuts and a roasted bitterness like weak cold coffee and what I swear is a light fruity note, almost citrus in character. Hmmm. Could be hops. Has the malty tang that one gets from brown ales and yes, porters. I also get a little cardboard or some other papery notes, a signature Rickards off-flavor along with metal. Make no mistake, though, the whole package is downplayed and falls well short of robust. The pleasant lingering caramel that I recalled from the aforementioned party was indeed present again and is a redeeming feature. If you shed your expectations and view this as a mild or brown rather than a porter its not too bad, if a little unsophisticated."
"Overall: Definitely not a porter, but a nice brown ale. Partially of what the style should be, but expecting more of the style."

"Overall - More like a mild English ale, so keeping the style in mind this score is a bit lower than it would be otherwise. Not a bad beer, but not the most impressive from Rickard's and only fair as a porter."
"Almost a clear filtered deep mahogany brown hue with a big khaki tan head, big bubbles form thick. Mild hints of coffee they mentioned a touch of maple syrup added in here, mild cocoa very pleasant mass produced porter. Flavors meld nicely a hint of cherry or other dark fruits, mild cocoa, hints of maple syrup without coming off too sweet. A bit watery maybe, I wish there were more substantial flavors but for something from Rickard's aka Molson it's pretty enjoyable and effortless to drink. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied range, with even carbonation nothing cloying on the palate a hint of roasted malt bitterness hangs around between sips. Overall I'm glad my cousin shared his sampler of the Rickard's 12 pack he got coming back from Canada. He happened to drink all of the Rickard's Blonde, happy to try the White and Dark and revisit the Red."

"I can't believe I used to think this stuff was good beer"
"I like porters in general, so that compels me to give a nice overall mark. Not as good as other porters and darks I've had, so I don't think I'd buy this again."
""
"This dark beer is a bit on the lighter side but I would think given that it would pair with food very well, I think it would enhance the food and thus enhance itself some."

"A decent mass produced English style porter. Not much to speak of in terms of complexity or flavours, but its not horrible either. Most bars I go to frequently don't have any dark beers or porters (even Guinness isn't available at most of them) other than this beer so for fans of this style don't have much of a choice, but that being said its not that bad just nothing special at all. It's drinkable but there are much better stouts available"

"Overall - 3/5"

"For a macro brewer kicking out pseudo craft offerings, this isn't too bad, it just needs to be properly labeled."

"Final Thoughts: It's a good beer, but it's not a Porter! Why on earth Molson thought calling this a Porter on their website was a good idea I have no idea. Probably because a Porter is more marketable then a Mild Dark? I dunno, either way as a Mild Dark, just about every category would have received a .5 bump from me, which would have pushed this beer around the 4.0+ area. I like to think the Brewer intended it as such, and not as a Porter, but I suppose this should be a lesson in knowing what you are selling. You would think that Molson would have learned a lesson from it's rival Labatt, and their venture with Alexander Keith's ""Stag Head Stout"""
"O: So-so. Certainly doesn't seem like much of a Porter; more like a watered-down Brown Ale."

"Pours a deep amber to black in color with a light tan head. In the aroma, a caramel roast and a mellow lager note. In the taste, a small sweet caramel roast in a lager like beer. A small bite, but mainly smooth and a medium to lighter bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry note of caramel in a lager. A sweet caramel roast in a lager, if this is supposed to be a porter, it is really thin."

"Rickard's is a bit of a standby for beer fans in Ontario stuck gonig to chain restaurants and bars. The dark is a not bad addition to the lineup, I'd happily drink one given no other options."
""
"Very good for the style. A traditional english porter."

"I poured it with a big fluffy-creamy, light brown head. It reduced to a thin head with lacing along the sides. The body is clear with a dark brown-red colour. On the aroma I get rootbeer and roasted grains, though it isn't particularly strong. The taste isn't really really I expected. I taste licorce, molassas, and smoke. It is supposed to have ""a hint of pure Quebec maple syrup"" but I don't get it. Makes me wonder what it would taste like without that ingredient. The mouthfeel is smooth but watery with a thin body. Overall, it tastes basically what I'd expect a Rickard's porter to taste like."

"O: This was my first porter, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I can tell this is an average offering of the style. It does, however, leave me wanting to try more porters. Glad I tried it."
"This is no more a real porter than that person sending you the emails about Viagra is a real doctor. And if you're looking for a substantial, malty dark ale then I'd say it's also every bit a scam. Don't get me wrong, it may be the most flavorful offering in the Molson lineup - and isn't too hard to drink - but let's just not call it a porter and keep expectations reasonable."

"Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with bland flavors and aromas."

"Deep copper in colour, like an old penny. Off-white head disappears in under two minutes. No lacing. Aroma smells sweet; light prune notes. Very meek and inoffensive. What little aroma to be found is more like brown ale than porter. Mild dried fruit flavour with even milder, nearly non-existent, roast. Slight acidity. Medium-bodied but slightly overcarbonated for my liking. Not as horrifying an abomination as Keiths Dark. I'll damn it with that faint praise."
""
"Altogether it is alright, but as a porter fan there are several better options."
"Overall-again, this feels more like a gimmick and it’s a largely forgettable beer. I didn’t hate it but I do not recommend seeking it out. Went ok with my meal though."
"Even free--it's hard to drink a beer when the can proudly states the Molson-Coors provenance."
"Final Grade: 2.87, a C."
"O- I personally don't understand why Rickards is slammed so much....no this is not the best porter out there, but there is some flavor and it's easy to drink, especially in the warmer weather. I think this would also make a great steak marinade and will try that sometime down the road. I would buy this again. The Rickard's lineup and this in particular, is decent beer...it just doesn't stand out."
"D: Its a so-so commercial porter since few really put that style out there. But I know I have made one much better."
"Pours mahogany with some chestnut and ruby highlights found in the body. Relatively creamy head that lasts and laces quite well. Is this a Molson product? Nose has some non-descript sweetness, maybe some maple/sugar and a hint of some nuttiness? Muddled and too sweet. Not much else, some grain and a hint of metal. Taste has some dark fruit and some sweetness. Some sugar fro sure, but definitely not the 'maple' advertised on the can. More metallic notes in the finish. Body is light and borders on watery. Medium carbonation. This one was just too sweet for me and not something I'd intentionally revisit. Not horrible and a step up from other macro offerings, but not work seeking out."
"Tasted decent when cold, held some porter qualities. Some roasted dark malt character, a bit of maple syrup which is said it's brewed with, but it lacks any body and true quality ingrediants. Seems like it was brewed with little to no thought about quality but rather with quantity in mind. Light and thin mouthfeel. Wasn't going to say no to my buddy! Decent overall but not going to ever purchase myself."
"Overall, it's alright. I kind of like it and might drink it again, but there are better beers in this style that are easy to get and not much more expensive."
"i think this is a very good beer, despite what others may say it is easily drinkable and very enjoyable. The maple taste is a bit forthcomming though. I find that the beer is lacking somethng though i cant quite put my finger on it! Oh well ill just st back and enjoy it i guess."
"Overall this is a decent attempt, starts strong but the lightness kills it and makes it an unballanced beer."
"But i still think the bottle version is pretty damn good!"
"D- Overall a very drinkable beer. Definitely not the best there is but acceptable for sure"
"This is not a good example of an English porter - at all!"
"D - By no means a terrible offering, but lacking a bit of everything in all departments. Would easily order a pint of this again, but it's nothing special. A poor example of the style, but still a drinkable dark beer."
"Clear, dark brown, still quite transparent. A thin beige cap appeared, but didn't linger for long. It did leave a modest collar and a bit of short lived spotty lace. Light aroma, mostly of caramel and toffee, light roast and burnt sugar, molasses, with a hint of smoke. Sweet, malty flavour, more caramel, light bitterness and roast towards the end. Not much in the way of maple, other than sugary sweetness. Decent texture, between light and medium bodied with average carbonation. Uninspired, but still drinkable, and not much of a porter."
"Poured from the can into an imperial pint glass... It's a crystal clear dark brown / mahogany - more brown ale than porter in color, with a two-finger off-white head that recedes but manages some slight retention. Aroma is of very slight roastiness (perhaps I'm imagining it) and a ton of caramel malt. Taste is more of the heavy caramel malt with a super / ridiculous sweet finish. The can reads ""smooth finish that holds just a hint of Quebec maple syrup"" - more like a friggin boatload of maple syrup! This stuff is so sweet with absolutely zero hop character its very tough to drink all 473mL. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and kinda creamy... drinkability = no thanks!"
"Drink - just an 'okay' beer. There are much better darks out there to be drunk."
"Mouthfeel? Save the fact there is vomit mixed with the beer? Very strong carbonation. Drinkability? Take a guess."
"Bottle: Poured a clear medium brown color ale with a fizzy small head with minimal retention and no lacing. Aroma consists of light roasted malt with no bitterness and lightly sweet adjunct dominated malt profile. Taste is also a mix between some light caramel with faint roasted malt. Body is way too thin for style with medium carbonation. Pointless."
" Thin, weak, uninspired, poor representation of the style, Basically disappointing and pointless."
"Rickards Dark poured black, like other porters, and had almost no head. There wasnt much of a smell, and the taste was the same. It was very light, and tasted watered down. Even though it was a porter it was very light, and needed much more flavor. Not a bad beer, but not a good beer either."
"Overall, not the worst accompaniment to a 5-napkin resto-burger, when you're not trying too hard to think about it. Another side-step from their Red Ale 'template'? Yup. Average brown ale? Sure. English porter? Hell to the no."
"Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation, too high for me. Wow. I would like to meet the geniuses who thought this one up."
"Hey Rickard, take off you Hoser."
"Like most 'above average' macros, Rickard's Dark would be a good fallback beer in mainstream establishments. Certainly one of Molson's best beers, and comparable to the White, but that's not saying much. Acceptable in moments of desperation, forgettable if you want something interesting."
"473 ml can- Deep cola pour has reddish hues when held to light, pours a frothy mocha cap with good lace. Nose of roast, some burnt sugar, honey, some coffee. Tastes sweet, of brown sugar, honey, roasted malts, a bit of bitter hops. Creamy sweet finish. Good."
"If this was on tap vs. Kokanee or Canadian, then it is certainly more drinkable. Might be a decent brew to offer newbies who are 'afraid' or 'don't like' dark beers."
"Drinkability - easy to put away quite a few and the lower alcohol content is a bonus."
"Overall, this is one of the better offerings from Rickard's line."
"Like the rest of the Rickards this is a pretty bland brew. Doesn't have the presence of a proper porter. Weak kneed across the board in its aroma and flavour. Thin bodied. Just uninteresting, but not unpalatable. Meh."
"I,m not kidding."
"D- Easy enough to drink. Has more character than most Molson products. Not sure why it would qualify as a porter though."
"This is so far from a porter, very much a ""safe"" beer. Non offensive, but does have some very nice maply syrup tasting notes. Dark brown in colour and not a lot of aroma but aroma is sweet with maple. Taste is again maple syrup with some malt. Beer is an easy drinking macro with really nothing of note or notable characteristics."
"for a big name Canadian brand it`s OK but that`s not saying much"
