The flavor are as intense as they are harmonious. I get some coffee bitterness right up front before sweet flavors like tootsie roll and burnt sugar rush into the mid-palate, before a long and pleasant Irish coffee bitterness. Hefty body is appropriate to the intensity of such dark flavors. I love this beer!","droomyster","Aug 03, 2014"

There is a good amount of detritus floating around. Definitely a negative. There is a small amount of smell, just nondescript malt and a hint of alcohol. The taste, though, is full of flavor. Deep roasted malt notes, with a nice earthy hops and not-unpleasant astringent hit. There is a decent weight to the body, my preference would be a little fuller but it's not thin by any means. The flavor for me is what does it a not complex but very good taste.","delta490","Jul 07, 2014"

3.6,-7.9,3.5,3.5,3.75,3.5,3.5,"Mad River Steelhead Porter served from a bottle with no freshness date on it. I did notice a high amount of residual yeast and musty things in each bottle. Here we have a decent porter with a flair for scotchy smokiness. In between sips, I noticed a long lasting smoke taste in my mouth as if I had been smoking a nice cigar or drinking an Islay scotch. At 6.5% alcohol with medium body, this beer isn't going to overwhelm or inspire you, but to me it's an above average beer of a niche style. Once again, the beer is mild for something called a 'scotch porter' which might scare away most casual beer drinkers. This is a beer that critical drinkers will appreciate and adventurous laypeople will like too. Malty with well balanced molasses and smoke. Overall, an average porter with some additional intrigue and smoke flavor make this beer something to check out.","BenHesk12","Jun 15, 2014"

3.97,1.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"O - A bit of smokiness, dark caramels, and some bass in the chocolate dress up the standard English porter quite nicely. No confusing this with a stout, it's been pulled in a different direction. Probably a bit too focused on the chocolate to drink several, but it would pair exceptionally well with anything complemented by chocolate, such as vanilla ice cream or raspberries. Requires a fuller cigar with a dark but mellow wrapper. It should be noted that the "Scotch" has been dropped from the label, but "Porter" is printed on a tartan background. Recommended for non-hop-heads looking for more from a porter but not the burnt bitterness of a stout.","BuckeyeSlim","Apr 09, 2012"

However, there is a sludge-like substance that sinks to the bottom of the glass after the pour. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and coffee. Taste is the same as the smell with a emphasis on roasty flavors - especially with the malt and coffee. A very mild roasty bitterness quickly fades after each sip. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a very crisp mouthfeel. A bit too much carbonation for the style in my opinion.

Aroma is light on the smoke, I get mostly chocolate and toffee. There's a light sourness, hard to put my finger on exactly. Almost like a slight rottenness, but it's too faint to be repulsive. When cold, the flavor and body are actually quite nice. The low temperature adds a viscosity that is rapidly lost with warming. The flavor is dark chocolatey with a whisper of smoke, but the body fails to support this as the beer warms. Very unroasty, strictly porterish. There's no mistaking this for a stout. Negligible bitterness. I've been rather sensitive to astringency lately and thankfully this beer has almost none. I guess it's really not bad for a Mad River beer.","illidurit","Mar 07, 2010"

Hazlenut, caramel, roasted malt, cream and butterscotch. There is a great deal of flavor in this one with a thick creamy mouthfeel. Although my knock is going to be too much carbonation, the taste follows the nose with a tremendously balanced blend of sweet malt, crisp hops and warming alcohol. Why is this beer and this company not getting the props? Is it a scotch or is it a porter? Its more reminiscent of Founders dirty bastard than a porter.

When held up to the light it looks like it's glowing. It smells really good too. It smells similar to an American Strong Ale to me mixed with a Scotch Ale. It has a lot going on with the smell. The aroma is smokey with a mix of burned malts, hops and even some alcohol. The taste has just as much going on with it. Here's where the porter part comes in stronger. It has a taste of caramelized burned malts, again with a smokey taste. Doesn't taste as much like an American Strong as the smell is, but the taste of Scotch Ale comes in. With all that's going on with the taste, it's pretty well balanced. It starts off smokey than moves to the sweet caramelized burned malts, than finishes of with a bitter hop to it. All in all it's a great, unique flavor. The mouthfeel is very good, certainly full-bodied, pretty drinkable as well.","AndyAvalanche","Nov 06, 2009"

Aroma kicks in with heavy duty roasted malt... flavor is my favorite kind of malty... not just caramel, cloying sweetness, but roasted, peaty, and smoky... campfire would be a good comparison... moutfeel is a little thin, but the flavors round it out... that final salty note on the swallow gives it a very nice, almost imperial, type porter feel... good beer.","dolemite77","Sep 28, 2009"

At first pour this beer is very impressive - attractive dark brown hue with reddish highlights. Most impressive is the head retention - five or ten minutes after the pour I still have a perfect one finger's worth of creamy tan head resting peacefully on the beer. Aroma is full of malt, with some earth and a subtle peat smoke, contributing the "scotch" aspect of this porter. Nutty and spicy notes come through in the flavor supporting the big malty profile. Just a touch of herbal, spicy hops mixes well with the light smoke. Lots of subtle complexities here combining in a simple way to make a really flavorful yet easy drinking beer.

Balanced towards sweetness up front, lots of caramel and toffee, but this gave way to chocolate and citrus flavours. Bitterness became more prominent in the finish and hop flavour grew as well. So it started out kind of like a scotch ale and ended up kind of like a porter - I get it! Some dryness from the dark malts, hefty medium body and lowish carbonation. It's a neat beer, cool idea.

Nice taste, as well, it has a slightly coffee flavor that mixes well with the scotch peatiness. The only thing really hurting the taste and feel is the bit of alcohol apparant in the aftertaste.

4.03,3.1,4,3.5,4,4.5,4.5,"Admittedly, I'm trying this beer too cold, but as it warms, I can decipher some great characteristics. The pour delivers a dark brown hue, that shows dull chesnut highlights and a fairly hazy complexion. Dense, but terse head retention soon fell to a trace, and then held firm. The aromas have a firm, but not assertive chocolate scent and a complementary nutty - coffee scent. A sweet malt / lactose character also wraps up the aromas. Flavors kick off with a rich malty taste, but not particularly sweet. Confectionate and complex roastiness blend with chocolate, bread, and barley make a moderately flavored, complex, but still not agressive, flavoring. The feel is not heavy, but very full and round with a lot of non-fermentables and weightiness. The finish is quite clean and powdery for such body and disquised flavor. A lingering earthy / diry / smokey note finishes the beer. Very good and clean Porter, just wanted more of an emphasis on the cocoa, coffee balance.","BEERchitect","Aug 02, 2007"

Reminds me a lot of an awesome oatmeal stout I had out in Oregon - Hogsback Stout - in fact, the closest in taste that I can find in my area.

Flavor contains creamy dark chocolate waves with a balancing flow of grassy herbal hops coming through touch of roasted marshmellow and English toffee candy the subtle smokey nutty edge causes a dryness after each sip. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth creamy texture flows on the palate yet the body is medium rather than other more robust porters carbonation level is dead on really even not too much or not enough.

Smells chocolate, soured caramel, and soured citrus. Some black patent and a hint of woody smoke. Taste starts with smoked chocolate that's tempered by a middle milk sweet kick and finishing with a roast grain dry. Wow, what a transition. There was alot going on in that first taste that I didn't capture in words. I'd like to add west coast hops (cascade?) as a base flavor that persists through most of the beer and a nice caramel undertone that appears late and persists as an aftertaste. This caramel keeps the roasty finish from being too much and I'd say the roast turns the caramel into more of a toffee flavor. Yes, I now see chocolate as part of the aftertaste. Yum, this beer is wonderful. Mostly dark and heavy, but with a lactose or oatmeal lightness edge. Like rounding a brooding Beethoven piece with a hint of Mozart frivolousness. Md-light body, but coats the inside of the mouth. Moderate carbonation that works well with the roast. An enjoyable beer that I'm happy to recommend.","mentor","Nov 16, 2005"

Decent mouthfeel, but it's marred by that overly astringent aftertaste.

It has a nice dark palate and a wonderful mouthfeel; a good drinker.","WesWes","Jul 21, 2004"

Aroma is chocolate, caramel and a woodsy smokiness.Seems to me they managed to get the carbonation right on this as I experience no fizziness on my tongue.As for the flavor, caramel, chocolate smokey perhaps a little peat and as it warms just a hint of hoppines that melds perfectly. All in all, go for it because this is just one fine brew!!","david23","Jul 15, 2004"

4.5,15.1,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Almost black in color. Thick, dense light brown head. Retention is solid. Lacing is full and comes in rings and patches. Aroma is burnt malt, tar, smoked salmon and roasted malts. Flavor profile offers smoke, bittersweet chocolate, char, burnt malts and tobacco. It's not just a total onslaught (like say Alpha Klaus, which was in a good way) but the flavors are fairly pronounced. This is really enjoyable. The body is damn near full and the mouthfeel smooth, creamy and enjoyable.","Bighuge","May 04, 2004"
3.8,-2.8,4,4,3.5,4,4,"All told, its a good, unbalanced, west-coast-styled porter. But when "Scotch" is placed on the label, I expect it to come to fruition. And it doesn't really here.","cokes","Mar 27, 2004"
4.09,4.6,2.5,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Medium-medium-full body sits nicely in the mouth with a vast amount of tiny carbonation bubbles tingling your mouth on all sides. Very nicely built, easy as pie to drink, I'd like to sit down with a few of these for a good night. If nutritional facts were on the label, I could see this being a good source of vitamin C. :)","Skidz","Mar 18, 2004"

4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle. I would not particularly stick this in the smoked beer style, more of a porter.","GCBrewingCo","Feb 14, 2004"
3.61,-7.7,4.5,3.5,3.5,3,4,"No hops on the flavor in my opinion. This is a nice brew but I wish it was a little thicker and had a stronger finish. Good flavors to drink on a cold winter's nite just not very strong.","sulldaddy","Jan 11, 2004"
3.95,1,4,4,4,3.5,4,"A dark and brooding brown color with a monstrous light tan head that is semi-creamy in texture, as it slowly erodes a thick and sticky curtain of lace forms to seal off the glass. The peated malts add a bit of muskiness to the nose, backed by the mild toasted barley and crystal malts, sweet, fresh and a pleasant change of pace. Start is sweet, thickly malt, the top is light to medium in its feel to the palate. Finish is benignly acidic, the hops perky in their spicy bite, very dry and somewhat bitter aftertaste, a decent beer and one Ive not sampled for 1091 days, I guess thats just a tad short of 3 years, way over due Id say, as Mad River is a favorite Brewery, just never see this beer here.","Gusler","Nov 05, 2003"
4.23,8.2,4.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Oh yeah! This is one badass brew! It's a Scotch Porter, yet it resembles an Imperial/Old Ale in smell and taste. It's a very dark amber, almost black, with a dark tan head to it. It had a smokey smell to it, mixed with chocolate and subtle fruits. It was creamy and coated the mouth very well, as well as the throat. The taste was very nice too. It had the same properties as the smell, but much more intense, especially on the chocolate maltiness. I guess if this were a candy, it would be an alcoholic malted milk ball. This is the first Steelhead that I have ever had, and if they are all great like this one, it won't be the last.","JISurfer","Oct 29, 2003"

3.88,-0.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Deep black color, medium tannish foamy head. Aroma is malty and sweet, with a touch of smoke. Roasted malts, slightly hoppy. Robust malts, nearly chocolaty. Full flavor, some sweetness. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is smooth. Smooth taste. Aftertaste is malty, slightly bitter.","beerguy101","Aug 31, 2003"
4.18,6.9,4,3.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Boo-yah! I'd rename this beer to "Smoked Porter," but that's just me. Regardless, this is a very interesting beer, and I like their approach at brewing a more traditional Porter (whatever that means these days). Oddly complex. Tasty. Intriguing. I want more.","Todd","Jul 10, 2003"
4.2,7.4,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Poured a nice rich looking deep brown with nice fluffy light brown head,smell was sweet and caramelly.I got the taste of roasted nuts and some light chocolate tones.Real liked the body of this one,pretty rich and velvety.First so-called"scotch porter" I think I have had,real nice.","oberon","May 12, 2003"
3.97,1.5,3.5,4,4,4,4,"This is definately an experimental brew because I think it defies classification. (Specialty porter...hmmm?) I think it is a good representative of a porter/stout hybrid with some creative touches added for good measure. Give it a try.","Zraly","Jan 01, 2003"
4,2.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Scotch porter?  Not sure what that is, but I like it.  Pours with a medium brown head.  The beer is very dark brown in color, almost opaque.  Smells quite roasty and alcoholy, with some vanilla.  Roasty coffee and chocolate flavors predominate, alcohol not particularly noticeable.  Medium body.  A slightly burnt taste to the finish.","htomsirveaux","Nov 15, 2002"

3.88,-0.8,4.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"A very nice porter from this brewery.  It pours very thick, rich, and heady out of the bottle.  The aroma is of malt, coffee, and maybe some semi-sweet chocolate.  A nice head laces the glass all the way down.  A solid porter.  Prost!","goindownsouth","Jul 05, 2002"
2.78,-28.9,4,3.5,2.5,3,2,"This is one of the most harsh porters i have ever had.  The sweetness of the scotch malts was offensive at best.  This one is coming off the shelves.","beernut7","May 22, 2002"
4.42,13,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Notes: Huge and brave, not for the faint of heart. This is a porter that wants respect and gains more character as it reaches cellar temperature. Makes for a most excellent night cap. 6.43% abv.","Jason","Jan 23, 2001"
