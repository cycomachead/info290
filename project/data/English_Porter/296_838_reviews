"Overall a solid porter. I want to have more from this brewery. This is my first St. Peter's"
"O: Would LOVE to try it on cask. These guys know how to make stouts."
"Serving type: bottle."
"cheers"

"Overall: classic porter, not particularly complex, easily quaffable and enjoyable."

"very very good beer"

"This holds the lightish-medium body of the classic style as I understand it, some good flow without a lot of weight but not lacking, either. Maybe it ends up a little light and fizzy, carbonated like a soda, but with a little added weight to it."

"St. Peter's Old-Style Porter ---3.5/5"
""

"O: wonderful beer. Glad to have found this at Total Wine. Would definitely buy & drink again. Takes me back to the Old World if I imagine I could. If only I could brew a beer this great tasting, complex with low alcohol of 5.1%."
""
""
""
""
"It's excellent."
""
""
""
"The taste is quite likable. Plenty of dark malts, brown sugar, and a low hop bitterness that plays up toward the end but does not overpower. It really tastes like a Porter should but a lot sweeter than I prefer."
""
""
""
"4.0 D: Another winner from this brewery. A very good option if you are in the mood for something English."

"Pours a clear dark reddish brown with a frothy cream colored head that slowly dissipates to lots of sticky lace. The aroma is a bit vinous with some dark fruity aromas. Burnt sugars, light chocolate and coffee playing supporting roles. The flavor is a touch lactic with vinous and dark pitted fruits melding into toffee, caramel, and a hint of smoke. Medium to thin body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet burnt mouthfeel. Interesting beer. This is not really what I think of when I think porter, but it was good enough to keep me interested through the glass."

"O: I have always been a fan of a good English porter and was definitely was not disappointed by this beer."

"In a word, Perfect. Best Porter I've ever had after 20 years of drinking beer. Smooth, smooth, smooth! Yummy. I picked it up because of its unassuming label, quite simple. St.Peters also makes a stout you must have too. I've only seen them in specialty shops here in south TX. 'Nuff said."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"M: Balanced, maybe a little extra bitterness at the end but blended with the proportion of sweetness makes this one a balanced beer."
""
""
"Nice lacing, big head on the initial pour, dark beer that is ruby red when held up to light. Musty, malty, slightly sour smell. Smell isn't strong enough to warrant much opinion. Taste is very mild, hardly much there, but what is there is a malty, sour mash type flavor. An OK beer, probably better when it's fresh in England than after sitting on a shelf for a while."
""
""
""
"O: New ground for me...an English porter, that is. This tastes and drinks just like an excellent Irish red, albeit a little less roasty."
""
"Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a pint glass, unknown freshness date. This pours a dark brown color almost black with a bubbly smallish tan head which quickly dissipates. The smells are of roasted malts, chocolate, cream, not bad. The feel is medium to light. The taste is pretty good, dark roasted malts, chocolate, not bad."
""
""
""
""
"O: A very well-crafted brew that should be sought out by fans of porters."
"Body is medium-light with a bit of wateriness around the edges, could be more substantial and more satisfying. Carbonation is suitably moderate, fitting. Finish is dry to semi-dry. Generally, good, but a bit more thickness would do wonders."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Maybe this is ""true to style," as in the fact that this is more like the old porters, but I'm not crazy for it. I won't be rushing back to buy this one anytime soon or probably ever. Too much else out there."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a great beer, as well as great looking. Go old school and grab yourself one of these."
"O: Solid English porter. The nose was a bit mild, but not bad. I preferred the Original Flag porter slightly."

"D-The body wasn't bad at all but the terrible feta aromatic and the one dimensionality of the roasted quality make this pretty undrinkable. Unfortunately, their date code is a little hard to decipher so I have no idea how old this is."
"Dr: It's hard to drink because it's watery garbage. It might be better on draught, but as is it's expensive and of poor quality."
"O - First thing first, I hope I didn't get a bad one! The sour/milky quality to this beer is a little off putting to me, mostly because I just wasn't expecting it. The malt characteristic is too subtle for my liking. Overall I wont try this ever again, but maybe I'll try another offering from the brewery. Not recommended."
"I'm left wondering if this thing went bad or the sour flavor is intentional. I don't like it."
"Overall: This was fairly forgettable. With the number of good stouts and porters out there, having this one again is not a priority."
"Pours very dark brown with very nice head. St. Peters beers always smell so good! Smells of bittersweet chocolate, vanilla and burnt cocoa. Fairly light mouthfeel for such a dark beer, starts out with sweeter notes of chocolate, nuts, caramel and vanilla. Finishes a little on the dry side, slightly bitter with some malt, tea and hop presence. A very good beer, and nice english style porter. I think I would prefer more of the up front flavor in the finish, but this is definitely a good quality beer."
"O: a great beer and possibly my favourite porter so far! I'd drink this more often if I could afford it, hehe."
"Overall - B"
"O- when I first had this I was going through a Belgian stint. Compared to Duvel, DuPont and others this is a beef, chewy beer with complex malt character, cheeky hop presence and mild yeast character. More objectively, its a bit thin and boring for my liking. Drinkable, but not preferable."
"O - Overall, quite a nice example of the style, good to enjoy on its own or as a session beer."
"A surprisingly good beer. Try it!"
"Overall the appearance, initial taste and smell of this beer are average but there is something unique about the overall experience."
"O- This beer has not much character in my opinion: the mouthfeel is very even and flavours never get very interesting. This is still a nice example of the style and a highly drinkable beer"
"O - I was happy when I poured this into the glass, but pleasantly shocked when took the first drink. It literally widened my eyes with the sweet, malty goodness it brings. i had to force myself to slow down and enjoy every drop."
"This is one I won't buy again which is disappointing because the St Peter's Cream Stout is one of my favorites."
"Drinkability: Quite drinkable - nothing really remarkable, but just good enough that I keep drinking it, noticing that it is was gone fast, and wishing I had another one. I had this with Kedgeree and it went well, and this beer strikes me as being able to go well with a lot of different foods. I'll have to revisit again with a different meal - maybe something meatier."
"This is just an OK beer. It was a little sweet on the smell and taste for me. The color, smell and taste were all mediocre for me. I do however place a disclaimer on my review. Being from the Midwest the freshness of the beer is always in question, and this one being a more ""Off the Beaten Path"" brew could have been there for a while. I will try it again and others from St. Peter just not for a while. Good beer St. Peters Brewery!"
"D: The beer is very drinkable and quite sessionable because it doesn't have a high alcohol content and isn't very filling."
"OVERALL: A solid English porter. Really easy to drink, and plenty flavorful and enjoyable. Definitely one to re-visit, and worth drinking in mass quantities if you see it available somewhere."
"Mouthfeel is very smooth and almost creamy. Mild carbonation and a medium body. Not bad, but very average. I can picture sitting in an English pub sipping this one late into the evening."
"St. Peter's Porter is a dark red-brown ale with a light brown head that has outstanding retention and lacing. It has a malty aroma that's sweet like toffee with a note of roast. It's medium-light bodied and lively with a quick finish. The flavor is like the aroma with plenty of roast and toffee. It's a good compromise between sweet and roasty. It's well beyond a brown and not a stout at all, so I'd call it a solid porter."
"Drink ability is good. I could certainly have another with a wonderful taste such as this. Very light body for a porter."
"Very satisfying beer."
"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a dark, creamy brown/black color with a thick, creamy pale colored head. The smell is a blend of malt, smoke, port wine, and sweet spices. Initial flavors of pale malt and slightly sour undertones, with highlights of bitter coffee flavors, and notes of earthy tones. There are sour undertones to the aftertaste, as well. The beer is full and smooth in mouth, with a nice, gentle finish. The sourness is gone by the end of the beer, and the taste remains pleasant in mouth between sips. A very easy to drink beer."
"Overall, an alright brew. Worth trying if you see it around."
"D: Highly drinkable, a perfectly sessionable beer, but perhaps a little depth could make it more interesting drinking experience. 4.5"
"D - Lighter flavor, body, and aroma than expected. Not a bad porter, and an Old Style English Porter titles fits this well. Easily sessionable. The beers gets better as it warms."
" ~ This is a great porter. I strongly recommend this porter to any fan of full flavored beers. I wish I had a few more bottles."
"A decent example of the style, and easy to drink."
"Very drinkable."
"All in all, quite a good experience in the smell. For the rest it's decent, not exeptional."
"i really wanted to like this one, but the sweetness and syrupy feel got to be too much halfway through the bottle. english porters are one of my favorite styles, but i can't see myself returning to this one."
"Malts become a little more sweet and prominent on the flavor but still has plenty of lingering chalky minerals and berry fruitiness. Finishes dry with a noticeable floral hopping. Very smooth drinking porter, could be a bit more robust and creamy in the mouthfeel. There is a distracting hint of smoky vinegar that I'm not a big fan of, but a pretty minor complaint. Pretty good brew, I could drink this again without much trouble."
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it's a good beer to session with if you're in the mood for the style, but there are other dark session beers that I would pick first."
"A very enjoyable drinking experience. Unique among the sea of other Porters out there. I enjoyed it more than my ""B" rating would seem to indicate."
"Enjoyable!"
"D - pass"
"Creamy medium full body. Carbonation is fairly low and there is little to slow the inevitable descent of the level in my glass. Time to fill 'er back up!"
"Body is rather light, I would have liked something a little richer. Carbonation is too high."
"Drinkability : a good beer in the style English Porter (drink at cellar temperature)."
"Keep in mind that if you're used to drinking excellent UK porters such as Sam Smith's Taddy Porter, or equally excellent American porters such as Founder's or Berkshire Drayman's, you'll need to adjust your expectations before drinking St. Peter's. The former are big, loud, avuncular porters that offer a muscular and meaty handshake; St. Peter's, on the other hand, is slender and subdued and understated. As porters go, it's a great beer on a lighter scale. The aroma has enough roastiness and coffee to immediately qualify for the style, but it's got the British twang of hoppy oranges without actually tasting like oranges. It's very smooth and a tad thin, but I didn't find it so watery as others have. I detected a touch of scotch in both the aroma and the taste, which was a pleasant addition. Subtle and well worth the price."
"D: This was OK, but I can see the clear difference with the Meantime I had a few days ago; they're just in different leagues."
"Watery mouthfeel, surprisingly so. Was hoping for something more chewy. Smooth, complex, light enough to be sessionable, which is not the case for many porters, but not my favorite from this brewery."
"A little on the watery side, but the thinner edge makes this all the more drinkable. Carbonation was ok, and it helped clear the palate. I like their stout much better, but this was very good. Easy to drink. Worth a try."
" D- This beer has a good session beer with a great depth and a nice subtle complexity and I would love to try this on cask."
"D - This is a highly drinkable brew. I could see this as a session beer as smooth and easy as it goes down. The only thing that lessens the drinkability is the price. I've been very impressed by this brewery and look forward to trying even more of what they have to offer."
"drinkability: highly recommended as a gateway beer."
"Not a bad drop, reminds me of Theakstons Old Peculier.."
"nice beer, but, st. peters makes some good but sort of unremarkable beers. not bad, but not one of those that i would really be asking for with any frequency."
"Drinkability: There's nothing better than old school -- or old-style, in this case. St. Peter's Old-Style Porter is a top-notch brew."
"I received this a gift and normally I would walk by this beer in the store, but I am happy I tried it as it surprised me....in a good way."
"Very drinkable and very nice taste with bread and slight acidic taste."
"Very easy drinking porter and a great representation of an old style porter."
"This is a pleasant beer to drink. Something for a chilled or rainy evening or even just to enjoy with a good traditional fish and chips. I found it rather enjoyable and could see myself partaking of another sometime in the near future."
"goog look, head is a solid cream color and a black body, which turns dark ruddy copper when held up to the light. smell is generic, but still decent, though it is lacking intensity or complexity. good roasted flavour, nice yeast character; just a solid porter flavour. its a good porter, nothing special to note though. a bit overcarbonated but still highly drinkable."
"D - Very easy drinking - smooth in flavor, especially with a nice easy chocolate profile. ABV is very manageable."
"The only downfall with this beer, for me, was that there seemed to be something missing with the finish. If it just could have lingered a little longer on the tongue I would have it as one of my favorite porters."
"mouthfeel comes across slightly thin which does this beer no favors. a bit heavier, more substantial mouthfeel would really finish this beer off the way it deserves. very well done otherwise."
"Everything about this beer was judicious it seemed. A really nice alternative to ""big"" porters when in the mood. Probably a good summertime porter."
"Overall, very enjoyable. I have had just a few old-style porters and this has been the best."
"Drinkability: while it is tasty and I wouldn't mind downing a few more if someone else were paying, I don't think I'd order another."
"A wonderful, traditional style porter with lots of great flavours going on. Wonderfully drinkable for a standard strength beer."
"D- understanding that this is a blend of an old ale and a newer beer adds depth of intrigue for me. most notable though is the depth of flavor and aroma. if this is how porters once were, then i would have no problem getting by in the pubs a century ago."
"Nutty malt with dark roasted edges. Good chocolate. Mild bittersweet dryness. Mild fruit is tart with some sourness, overall brightly fruity like grape. Soft floral touches. Nutty oiliness to body, medium-thin bodied, mild carbonation. Medium-low hop bitterness. Tastes pretty good. Feels pretty good. Pretty good drinkability."
"Overall, a beer that is good, right down the middle. Try it."
"Pours a dark brown with attractive reddish tints on the edges and small tan head up top. Smells toasty and lightly roasty, with a chocolaty sweetness. Flavor is full of character, very big and round. Toasted malts and an earthy bitterness feature prominently on the palate and the bitter, cold coffee finish lingers long. A very enjoyable beer in every way."
"Overall a very enjoyable brew. It's mildly complex, but not too much that this beer doesn't make a bad session beer."
"Fore sure it's drinkable, but much too easy. While porters should be smooth, they should also have some more bite and bumps and bruises along the way. Those are not very present in this brew."
"Suitable for drinking :)"
"It's a good beer, albeit one with just one big character. Bold and unapologetic, and surprisingly drinkable."
"Conclusion: This is a great porter; it's unique, quite flavorful, yet soft and easy going. I can't wait to try some of this brewery's other offerings."
"The roasted, dare I say burnt, character of the malt is definitely on showcase here. Take that with the bitterness and you have a nicely balanced ale, plenty drinkable, that is quite enjoyable."
"One pint bottle. Black with ruby highlights. Sizeable tan head. The head really lingers and leaves behind nice lacing. Roasted malt, caramel, and a little wine in the nose. Low carbonation with a medium-thick mouthfeel. Flavor is similar to the nose, minus the wine. A little coffee, lots of caramel, some earthiness. It also has a dry bitterness that works well with the malty sweetness. Overall this is a very enjoyable porter!"
"a great porter overall. very easy to drink. would be a perfect intro porter."
"D- A very enjoyable porter. Smooth, enjoyable, and drinkable. Worth trying out."
"Oh, and the foam doesn't quite disappear as there's still some spotting in what will be my last sip from my glass. Lacing is minimal."
"Drinkability: Just a tad light in the body, but otherwise a pleasant, easy-drinking porter."
"A well-done, authentic porter to its roots; This porter is a blend of old mature ale and a younger light beer. My first beer from St. Peter's, a welcoming first impression on me."
"Drinkability: A delicious, full bodied porter that stands out in all respects. Definitely going to add this to the regular lineup."
"Good atmosphere. Nothing extraordinary in the nose, but really stout. Similarly with the flavor, fairly basic but good balance. Solid feel, although it's almost too light, like it's a bit diluted. Does have prominent alcohol feel. Great drinkability though. Really solid quaff."
"Cheers..."
"D-Easy drinking porter but would probably look for different interesting flavors after a while"
"Smell is a bit ""boozy", but the taste had lots of character and complexity. Notes of chocolate, caramel, molasses, and coffee."
"Hard to rate this one. Pours clear dark brown with no head. Aroma is heavily coffee and leather. The taste is weak. Good coffee, malt, and some bitter hops, all with an earthy feel. Watery mouthfeel. Finished like an ESB. Overall, this was good, I just wanted more."
"D: Quite enjoyable. I've neglected this (and the entire St. Peter's lineup) for far too long, probably based on some misconceptions about their (at one time) clear bottles and issues of freshness. This was a fine and eminently drinkable little porter. If I need an English Porter, I'd gladly go here again."
"Taste is full of sweet toffee and caramel, chocolate, toasted malt, and a hint of smoke. The finish is bitter and earthy with tobacco, floral hops, and slight coffee. The feel is just on the thin side of medium-bodied, with ample carbonation. Very smooth with a clean finish. Drinkability is very good. Almost sessionable. Full of flavor and not too heavy."
"D - I would have to add this to my short list of drinkable porters. This has lots of flavor, yet not so heavy as to limit me to one bottle. It is made in the old school method of true English porters. I highly recommend it as a benchmark for all porters to be measured against."
"The color is like motor oil. Chocolate, coffee, malt and a hint of floral is what I could pick up. Very thick body bitter finish and smooth mouth feel. The Beer taste like chocolate, coffee toasted malts. a hint of molasses and bit pine and earthy. overall a good old style porter"
"Poured this in a snifter with really no head to speak of (may not have gotten the proper tilt). The color is a rich, reddish brown. It smells great, with tones of sweetness, carmel, and noticable rasin/sherry like notes. The taste is sweet, also sherry like with notes of smoke and wood. The mouthfeel is a bit light for the flavor, but it's smooth and very drinkable."
"This was a bit different from many porters but still was pretty good. I didn't quite enjoy the flavor as much as I had hoped but what can you do."
"D: Okay and only average drinking porter, some nice floral hopping but was light with only a moderate flavor."
"Drinkability: Quite decent, sessionable at 5.1% abv."
"pours dark brown almost black with thin beige head. Aroma of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and hazelnut. Very smooth drinking creamy porter with a nice roasted malt flavor. Hints of chocolate, roasted coffee and nuts. very good!"
"Taste - Definite coffee taste. Hint of sweetness. There is a well balanced bitterness from the hops. this beer has a nicely balanced taste"
"My only critique is the low amount of hop bitterness. A classic English Porter normally has a decent amount of Fuggles or Goldings to balance the malt bill out. However, this is a very nice porter, just the same. Pair with a slab of sharp Stilton and dark rye bread."
"D - Moderate to high. Not extreme on one end or the other. Another great brew from St. Peter's"
"Mouthfeel is thin for the flavor and is quite refreshing. There's a bit of oilyness from the hops that keeps the flavor lingering on the tip of the tongue."
"Future outlook: Solid in all areas. Repeat business likely. Has me excited to find and try their Cream Stout."
"The taste is chocolaty but not overly so, and has toastiness that is dry but not too dry, hints of coffee and earthy fruit. It has a full sweetness balanced with light bitterness and a drish finish. It has a lot of subtle complexity with the different elements blending harmoniously and leaving it very tasty yet extremely drinkable."
"Poured a deep amber with a small head. Fruity nose with hints of cocoa. A bit thin for a porter but did have a smooth mouthfeel. Taste started roasted malt and grain with a little spiciness. Finishes with a small bite and roasted malt, cocoa finish. Pretty good."
"D: a very enjoyable beer. It gave me evrything I expected in a Porter."
"Let it warm up to cellar temps, sit back and relax, sip slowly, and wade through this fine porter."
"D: A really nice porter but I felt like it was lacking something in taste for me. Not quite what I was expecting or looking for. Don't want to take away from the quality of it. I would be more than happy to return to this brew but definitely wouldn't be a stand-by for me."
"M&D: a full-bodied porter, with a creamy texture full of fine fizziness; the bitter flavour is echoed constantly by a healthy dose of sourness as balancer, but overall it is an aggressively bitter Porter unlike the usual fares. To me it's just quaffable and utterly enjoyable!"
"A leathery dark brown color with a faint head that left a lace ring on top that followed down. A sweet malt smell like some chocolate and molasses/hoeny(?) with some faint hops. Very smooth and semi-creamy, this medium-to-full bodied beer has a good coffee and roasted malt taste while enjoying some hoppiness and sweetness. I thought the finish was great as it was strong but not drying at all. I could have this all day."
"Pours out of the medecine bottle a nice dark brown/ruby color with a very white head that leaves pretty good lace. Nose has the flavor of an english porter, chocolate, chalk, slight honey. Taste follows with good caramel chocolatey flavor and dark malts. lacking in roastiness, but makes up for it in creamy vanilla type flavors. Mouthfeel is nice and viscous, but could use a little more carbonation IMO. Drinkability is good for the style, but not mindblowing or anything to write home about. Overall a good representation of the english style porter, but I would still take a meantime over one of these any day. Good brew."
"I was never really huge fan of porters, and never went out of my way to try new ones, UNTIL I tried this beer. The aroma was the high point for me: very sweet malts, sugary candy, caramel, and mocha coffee. Can smell it from a good distance away. Small, light brown head that sticks gorgeously to the side of the glass. Very dark brown in color with amber hues; almost looks like maple syrup. Tastes of chocolate, coffee, and light rum shine through. Long lasting, sweet aftertaste. I highly advise trying this one."
"An old standby, can always count on this english porter to satisfy."
"Easy enough to drink and smooth, but at $5.50 a pop I can pass on this one next time."
"I would love to have this for a session drink."
"It pours a dark semi-transparent reddish-brown, almost sable, with a very thick ecru head. Aroma is oily and a little smoky, mainly of molasses or brown sugar but not cloyingly sweet. Flavor is on the thin side - smoky and molasses-y, a little sweet but still with just a hint of hoppy bitterness. Texture is smooth and a bit watery, but this is still a decent brew."
"Mouthfeel is fantastic, feels thick, but clean, very drinkable... and all night dark beer."
"Mouthfeel was smooth with a very porter-like thinness of body."
"I love porters, and this is a good one."
"D - Could definitely have a few in an evening."
"This is, in my opinion, an excellent porter. It is well balanced and serviceable, but also quite complex. It's really all over the place, but never distracting. Sweet and light and fruity, but dense, dark, and bitterly chocolate, all at the same time. And at 5.10% ABV, it's an entirely sessionable beer. I would lover to try this on tap sometime. If you are a porter fan, seek this beer out. Would go great with a dark stew as well as a thick chocolate cake."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"D: This is why I prefer Porters to any other beer style, An absolutely remarkable Porter. A little pricey to drink a whole lot of it, but I will certainly enjoy a pint once in a while."
"This poured slightly hazy and very dark tan with no head. It smelled like dark chocolate and earthy roasted malt. Its flavor was a pretty straightforward blend of coffee bitterness and chocolate sweetness. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation and a mildly bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a basic porter, but it was good."
"Pours a very dark brown, with a tan colored head. Good retention, nice amounts of lacing. Aroma is of roasted malt, sweet chocolate and a very faint hopiness. Aroma isn't very strong. Not a very complex beer taste-wise. A nice roasted bitterness, with a touch of chocolate. Finish is dry. Goes down easy. Nothing spectacular here. I prefer a porter with a little more flavor."
"Very easy to drink because of the balance. Tastes like a porter should. Do not let the green bottle scare you away! I'm not usually a porter fan and I got talked into trying this one. I owe my buddy a ""High Five""! This is a classic porter. I wish all porters were this enjoyable!"
"2nd editorial rant: From some beer stores this beer in its attractive greenish brown bottle is badly skunked, others it's not skunked at all. The obsession with putting all stock on open shelves at room temperature under daylight or glaring fluorescents is beer abuse. Retailers should keep their excess cellared and in the original boxes it was shipped in. St. Peter's recently switched bottle shapes from the lovely ovals to boring round stumpy bottles (common UK bottle shape) for most of their beers. But kept the same green color. Their effort should have been to make the classy oval bottles in brown glass instead."
"Felt good, and fairly easy to drink. Overall a solid beer, though not among the best."
"Overall, I'm sure St. Peter's Old Style Porter is a much better beer when fresh, but my clearance rack bottle was just barely worthy."
"Wonderful English Porter....made as it should be without the sweetness you would find in a stout."
"D - Pretty drinkable beer, but its not real exciting. It has a bit too much roast character for my taste and the overall impression is a bit thin and watery."
"D: Enjoyable and very drinkable, but needs more ... well ... everything - to make it more than just OK."
"As a side note - I think Skunky beers should NOT be reviewed. Unless it is blatantly due to a bottling defect, I feel that you shouldn't lower a beer's overall score. Afterall, ANY beer can be spoiled due to too much light. Don't let that discourage others from trying one."
"It is a pleasant drink, but only that, a pleasant drink."
"VERY SKUNKY smell. This was my first skunky beer I've ever run into and it was abundantly obvious. The skunky smell faded some after 5 minutes, and gave way to a moderate chocolately coffee smell, with a bit of lingering skunk leftover still though. Taste was very strongly of coffee and little else. Fairly thin overall, and tasted almost ok aside from the skunkiness which i could not look past. Very little bitterness. Overall both bottles from different states were skunked and didn't impress at all. not a good porter."
"This is a good porter, but not one worth going out of the way for."
"Don't like this at all. This is my first and last St. Peter's beer."
"Overall a splendid example of a dry English porter. I've never been so lucky to try on on its native soil, but I'd like to think it would taste like this. Very eloquent and balanced. This one really shines in its subduedness. I'd like to keep many of these on hand if I could afford them. Nice treat and very much worth the $3.49/16.9 oz. bottle."
"D: This is a great porter, and very sessionable as well. Another excellent brew from a great brewery."
"So this is why people drink Porters. I haven't had many and this is definitely the first one I've liked. Pretty close to a sessionable ABV too. No complaints about this brew. Not quite world-class, but not too far off either."
"D - A nice porter indeed. The old & new blend very well. Highly recommend."
"D - This was an okay porter. Kind of a strange bitterness. I'd say it's overpriced at $5 a bottle."
"Overall: a very excellent ale that seems to be underrated on BA. It is a complex ale without being overly heavy like a barleywine, but has some serious craftsmenship behind it. I think some of my fellow reviewers need another look at this one. Reading some of the reviews, it doesn't seem like people get the two threads (of the historical three, but an A for effort) idea and the direction of ""Old World"" for this one. Has flavors reminiscent of Flag Porter as well, but easier to drink and get to the depth of the beer."
"The Old-Style Porter comes in a cool bottle with no freshness date to be found. It pours lovely dark black color with a solid foam head that sea foamy and leaves some awesome lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma of the beer is of roasted malts and the flavor is a carbonated slight chocolately one. It is thin in the mouth and leaves its mark on the sides of the mouth and tongue. Very enjoyable."
"This beer is very good. I enjoy those heavy complex beers myself but for when you don't want something that bowls you over but still has some of the dark beer character this is a great choice. Some might take points away for it not being as heavy as they like but this is a plus in my book with this one. Everything balances out nicely and you don't want to go sleep in the corner after having a pint of it. Great beer IMO. Will definately visit again. St Peters makes some good stuff."
"A bit watery, very light effervescence with a dry finish. Smoky malt aftertaste. Good but not great."
"Very smooth and drinkable. Old style porter that is extremely drinkable. Not overly complex. A perfect quaff when you are just looking to relax and enjoy a good old traditional porter. I strongly recommend this beer. It has many similarities with Samuel Smith's Taddy Porter."
"Mouthfeel is thin but adds slightly to the drinkability. Overall a good showing."
"Glad I let this one sit, but nothing too spectacular. Good to taste and give it your own opinion."
"This brew pours a very nice dark brown. The nose felt a bit weak, but had some nice dark malt hints. The taste of this beer was where it was at for me. Great dark malt flavors. Dark chocolate and coffee in the center of the palate made this a very flavorful beer. Mouth feel was good, but could have been a bit thicker. This beer was very drinkable. Overall I enjoyed this a great deal and will for sure have again."
"Pours a big fluffy head that doesn't dissipate easily. The color is dark, but you can easily see light throughout the beer. Lacing is very very sticky. Smell is slightly hoppy with a little roasty background. English ales are harder to pick up after all the American beers. The taste is light with coffee roastiness. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is smooth, but reminds me a little of the mouthfeel of water. Overall, I do like this brew and will have it again."
"not rich in flavor or mouthfeel. dry, bready, hoppy. once it warmed i actually enjoyed it greatly. it's a quaffable glass of the kind of roasty flavors that so often come attached to 10% alcohol and oodles of sugar. i can dig it"
"On a side note, I do miss the medicine bottle, but the new bottle shape is pleasing in its own way."
"Taste: Starts off with a nice chewy caramelly taste that leads into a clean hop that balances this beer amazingly. A creamy buttery note smoothes things out in the middle before a light coffee finish ties things up. I'll be picking this one up again soon."
"D: This beer, being very smooth and tasty, is a nice drinking beer. It tends to get a little filling as you go on, so you may feel a little bloated by the end of it."
"I like this beer by itself, but as a porter not so much. It just isn't what I expect from a porter."
"Very nice, very drinkable porter. Complex flavors and well balanced all around. I have been quite impressed with the offerings I have tried from this brewery. Grab this one if you get the chance."
"Poured almost black, with slight red tints. Almost no head when first poured, but a delayed run of carbonation comes up to make way for a few tan bubbles. Smell was dark roasted malts, with some mocha hints. Taste was dark, malty, bready, and coffee-flavored up front, but made way for a lighter, bitter aftertaste (but still malty). It was unusual, but quite good. The carbonation was light, and the mouthfeel was medium: thinner than expected, and thinner than I would have liked it to be. Overall, this was a good tasting beer, tasty and satisfying without filling you up. I enjoyed it, and even though I finished off the bottle I could have used another."
"A light easy to drink porter, with no major flaws."
"I love the bottle. Pours a dark brown color with carbonation that seeps up from the bottom of the glass when poured. Aroma is dry and roasty with some coffee essence. Taste is somewhat similar except that there's more of a coffee essence to it. I couldn't tell how old this beer is. Anyway, It's not too bad. Just somewhat different than what I expected. Not bad though and easy drinking all around."
"Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with an inch off-white head. Head retention is OK, lacing is very good. It smells like toffee, roasted malt, chocolate, and some citrusy hops. The beers tastes pretty much the same way it smells, but has a hoppy bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light/medium, and thin, thinner than I would like anyway. Drinkability is good as the beer is smooth and is easy to drink. Overall I think it's decent, not a bad choice at all."
"drinkability is suprizingly good for a heavier brew like this. very smooth in all areas, and not too harsh in the alcohol department."
"dark brown color...near blk. Subtle toffee/chocolate nose...typical. taste....subdued....great flavors but not quite enough of 'em. I must say I like this! It's no edmund fitzgerald....but it's like its thinner and slightly less flavorful brother. On a great note - the sour ale adds an incredible creaminess and drinkability despite the near-waterlike-mouthfeel. If it wasn't over 4 bucks for this bottle it would be a great choice...but with Great Lakes EF available for 7.99 a six....why bother? ..flavors too subdued, and not much aftertaste to keep on enjoying this brew after swallowing it down... but as for easy-to-drink... probably tops in its style...this is like a pounders porter with great roots.... Easy drinkin porter of good quality that misses the mark only due to lighter porter flavor and thin mouthfeel...otherwise...excellent."
"Very good porter. Have had some weak porter's lately and it was refreshing to have a real one, one with flavor. Will drink again."
"This is a good porter for the man who likes stouts. Not syrupy or too burnt tasting, it is a bit easier on the palate than other porters, and as a stout type of guy I really dig this beer, though I'm sure there are many who would argue with the Tapman on this one. Still, quite delicious and I could drink this one all night long."
"Drinkability: High. Well-structured, lots of complexity, very solid example of the style."
"All in all, a decent choice; but not a favorite of the style."
"Pours a nice dark mahogany hue, with some initial rocky head, with minimal spot lacing. A slight roast/choco aroma. The taste is very good, roast and choco, in the tradition of porter. I must say that I was a bit disappointed with the mouthfeel. It is quite thin for an English porter (no challenge to the Fuller's benchmark). At 5.10% ABV, good drinkability. I will probably not have another. As I said above, mouthfeel was a bit of a turn off. When I want a St. Pete's I'll instead opt for their outstanding Cream Stout."
"This is an interesting porter; quite unlike any others I've had. Less opaque than I was expecting, more of a transparent brown in color. Minimal head, very fine carbonation. Somewhat thin-bodied, reminding me more of a schwarzbier than a porter. The nose is extremely sweet, like a chocolate malt milkshake or a mocha latte. The taste is somewhere between a brown ale and a modern porter. Not as roasted as I was expecting, this has a more moderate balance of roasted and unroasted malts - not exactly what I was expecting, but unique and definitely enjoyable. I'd recommend this entirely for the sake of trying a very unique beer."
"An easy drinking porter. Dark malt subdued as appropriate for the style. Clean and gentle."
"Medium to dark amber in color with a thin head that disapates quickly. Smell of roasted malts and dark chocolate. Taste of dark malts, coffee and cocoa with a medium mouthfeel. Seems to lack a certain balance that I'm looking for and has a dry bitter aftertaste that sticks around awhile."
"A good beer, but a bit pricey - there's lots of good porters out there than can be had for less ($3.25 for 500ml @ Circle Liquors, Pennington, NJ)"
"Very complex, and my only complaint is that the bitterness lacks a little balance."
"Sweet caramel and chocolate notes right from the start. Interesting infusion of coffee grounds gives the flavor a robustness that would be lacking without it. Slightly bitter though not quite noticeable until the aftertaste. Finishes smoothly and actually thins out a bit too much. A touch of smokeyness also detectable. A very nice and easy drinking porter from across the pond. Low abv and good flavor allows many of these to be had in one sitting. I will revisit this one."
"I came across this delectable treat at The Mercury Lounge in Goleta, California. Though it was a bit expensive at about $7/bottle, I can say it is probably the tastiest porter I've ever had (I've probably tried a dozen so far. i.e. so not a lot). I think the best trait this porter has is the exceptional balance between ingredients. A strong roast flavor comes through without the acrid burnt flavor typical of near black ales. A true porter that doesn’t try to be a stout. Unfortunately the lighting was horrible at The Mercury so I can’t comment on the appearance other than the unique bottles are quite an interesting sight. The mouth-feel was just thick enough to let you know a lot went into making the beer without making it filling, and the hops were just bitter enough to prevent the drink from having a sweet aftertaste. A beer that is good for a short session or with dinner. Again, the balance with this one is quite good. I hope to try one again some time."
"Liked the oval flask type bottle, but green??"
"I have had this beer at the Jerusalem Tavern, Clerkenwell, London. It is never disappointing, an excellent example of the style."
"Drinkability - A lot of porters are quite harsh. This is not one of them. Not the best porter, but very drinkable and pleasant all the same."
"The chocolate malts come through big at first, definitely roasted flavors dominate here. Hops come in hard and fast, balancing the whole thing nicely. Solid beer, not overwhelming any direction. To me where it lacks behind the best porters is the mouthfeel, just comes up a little thin. Great for drinkability, no flavors that get ""off"" as the beer warms. Very tasty treat, session porter no doubt."
"It has a very interesting aroma, it has an almost medicinal smell to it thats covered by a sweet chocolaty scent. It pours out of the bottle a very deep brown color that could almost be mistaken for black if it werent for the dark amber hues that show up in the light. It has a very fine head that quickly dissipates into a thin ring around the glass and offers a good contrast to its dark body. The first thing you taste is a bitter edge of the porter but it rolls on to your tongue quit smoothly and has a semi crisp taste by the time it gets to the middle of your tongue. It has a dull slightly bitter after taste that reminds me of some sort of candy and only has a hint of alcohol."
"Velvety aftertaste, pleasant. Chocolate again, with hints of bitterness in the end."
"D: Another one that makes me feel like I'm having this in a pub. Very nice."
"Perhaps my expectations were built up by the cool bottle and old english script but after drinking this beer I searched the bottle to see if it had really been produced in St. Louis or Milwaukee. What a mild porter, from a style which was a thick working mans grog meant to be both tasteful and filling to this pale approximation. I still think the attendant at my local beer store must have popped it open, drank a third and topped it off with water. still I doubt I'll spend the money to prove him guilty"
"Pours a deep, rich chocolate with a head that dissipates quickly. Aromas of coffee and sweet nuts are evident. Though the mouthfeel is strangely thin for a porter, I cant say I mind as the flavor sensations are complex, ranging from a bitter coffee taste of hops to hazelnut qualities on the tongue. Just the right amount of carbonation helps it all go down. The label on the very attractive bottle contends that this is a porter in the classic mold, and if that is the case then Im sad we dont see this style around much anymore. The lightness tends to allow more appreciation of the taste. My drinking companion comments its a porter that doesnt force you to choose between a beer and dinner, which I find nicely sums up both of our feelings."
"D: Pretty damn drinkable. Nothing really out of whack. Would have loved to have seen it in a darker bottle, but can't complain much about that. The bottle itself is unique."
"This brewery is kinda hit-or-miss isn't it. Expected a very nice, but simple and one-dimensional Porter, but the beer didn't reall live up to my expectations. The pour showed a lighter and more opaque hue than found in today's Porters-- somewhere between rich amber and brown. Though nice head retention, the beer also shows over carbonation and lack of protiens. The aroms confirmed the fear of part-grain character, though turns out more malted barley than the nose revealed. Along with a slightly better than average maltiness, the flavors also showed a moderate bready, lightly grainy, cola-like flavor that fell short of Brown Ale status. The feel was a bit too light, pushing the grain emphasis. Finished with that cola flavor and feel. Though the beer was not a disaster, I was expecting better in terms of rich chocolate, malty, richness and fuller, firmer body."
"Complex, but overly rich. A classic porter with a modern twist. Tasty and enjoyable."
"A pretty solid porter. A bit underwhelming at points but grows on ya quickly with its clean, well-crafted nature and notations of roasted goodies like, char, malt, coffee, and chocolate."
"Pours a deep brown, with a nice red hue. Thin tan head. decent retention,and nice lacing. Smell was nice, but weaker than I expected. Dark chocolate, and fruits mostly, with a sweet edge. Body is on the thin side,with just a bit of carbionation. Sweet chocolate up front, with a slight bitter edge to the finish. Excellent!"
"The taste is very solid, with a big unsweetened chocolate flavor that ends on an astringent bitter note. There is a lot of malt character here, but it's not overpowering. The mouthfeel is a little thin, as is the case with most English porters. It's quite drinkable, an easy beer to session. Overall this is an above average example of the style, and is reccomended to anyone who enjoys a good porter."
"I found the drinkability to be very nice. Nothing too spectacular, but I enjoyed drinking this beer. I was a little leary when I bought it, being clear glass and something that even Cub Foods sells singles of, but I was not disappointed. I feel more comfortable trying other styles from St. Peter's."
"Poured into tumbler at 50 degrees, but wish I had started it at 55. Beer was very dark for a porter. It had a nice head that lasted almost long enough. It was a tasty belend of dark choc. and toasted malty hints. I really liked it and will most certainly purchase again."
"D: I enjoyed this beer immensely and I can't wait to pick it up again. I'm very pleased with this beer, it actually exceeded my expectations."
"A beer I'd enjoy trying again. One of the better St. Peter offerings. Some nice warming character as result of good choice malts. Only hints of typical porter flavour, coffee etc I speak of. Wicked smooth mouthfeel but seems lacking certain character. No real head developed. Aroma was weaker as well. I can't argue this isn't good, but something was lacking and I wasn't quite satisfied."
"D: The drier finish and lack of powerful flavors make this a possible session beer, even if the price per bottle is a bit steep."
"The gin bottle design is a nice touch and I like the blend of old and new to create this porter. It's a very dry and complex English porter. Well worth the time spent exploring it."
"D: Again, if it was a RIS it would be a pretty good beer, but as a porter (prob my favorite style) I don't think it really is that great of a beer. nonetheless, I still finished it and did enjoy it for its RIS tastes..."
"sweetness only added to that. Overall it was was beer I will drink when i can."
"This beer poured practically opaque with a thick persistent head. The smell is heavy and sweet with a slight smoky smell. The beer is sweet with a bitter aftertaste. It is well balanced and quite smooth for a porter. The mouthfeel is chewy but not chunky like some porters I have noticed with other porters. Id consider this a very drinkable beer and will do so whenever possible."
"D - Pretty good, as long as you don't mind the taste. I mean it isn't overwhelmingly unpleasant, it's just not the sort of thing I want. The mouthfeel makes it quaffable. I just wish it wasn't so leathery. I think I'll pass on this again, but I will be sure to try more of this breweries offerings."
"What an awesome bottle. The pour isn't too bad either. Dark, almost black in color with a tan head. An earthy aroma, much like that of an old ale, joins coffee and chocolate in the nose. The taste has the coffee and chocolate, and the earthy, almost peaty character, plus some dark fruit and a barely there hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin, yet still somewhat creamy. It's certainly different from most porters and it's absolutely worth a try."
"I've had a few of these, but not in a while. I remember them being lighter porters with a bit more carbonation than usual and slightly caramel flavor. That's, more or less, what I got. A little more coffee like than I had remembered, and it has a bit of carbonation that keeps it fairly light-ish. Not much on the nose, except for a bit of toasted malt. The head was mid-sized and faded quickly, though it did lace well. The mouth after a while, the taste faded into a bitter-ish, dark coffee. Supremely drinkable since it's lighter than, say, a Fuller's."
"Overall, this beer presented a heckuva lot like a Guinness. Which is to say not bad, but not spectacular either. Worth a try."
"Body is very smooth but has a few tiny bubbles throughout the body that make it interesting."
"All in all, a good, tasty porter. I enjoyed their cream stout more than this, but this is a good, highly drinkable beer."
" It's fairly drinkable, but the bitterness hangs around long after the beer is gone, so it's not something I'd go out of my way to find. There are a lot better porters out there. Cool looking bottle tho."
"Pours deep brown, almost black, with mahogany highlights. Head is initially thick and stacked, but quickly dissipates to a dusting that nonetheless leaves sticky lacing. Big butter aroma, mixed with highly roasted malts and an impression of dryness. That dryness is not borne out by the palate, however. It starts off with sweet coffee, rich buttery cream, and a touch of dark fruit before finishing with a slightly sour note that's reminiscent of beers made on a Yorkshire square. Nicely complex, but not overbearing. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with plenty of residual sugars. Excellent for consuming many pints over an evening. Great session beer, and great food pairing beer."
"Medium body, along with low carbonation. The bigger hop presence makes this beer bitter without maltyness to back it up, however it is still a nice beer. You may not step over your own mother to get one, but you definitely wont turn it down."
"Pours deep caramel brown with medium carbonation and minimal head retention. Smells of heavy caramel and malt. Thin, runny coffee up front. Finishes more or less the same way she started. In other words, not a whole lot going on except for a solid blend of roasted coffee, heavy malt and a sticky caramel coating on the tongue and lips. A pretty solid porter but nonetheless lacking an identity of its own. Would go best with a meal of smoked meats or a chocolate dessert, where the beer would complement the food rather than have to rely on its own merits."
"A tasty porter, worth a visit again"
"A good, solid, robust version of a British porter. Bottle was also neat, if that matters."
"Medium-light body, with low carbonation. Pretty well balanced, maybe a touch more bitter in the finish than I would expect from a porter, but it's not oft-putting. Pretty good overall, and could be a candidate for a session beer."
"Pours a deep mahogany with a thin off white cap. Aroma is chocolate, licorice, light caramel and fruity esters, light alcohol in the back. Immediate flavor is chocolate with some coffee astringincy biting in the background. Notes of cherry, licorice, and earthiness. Very smooth feel, with a medium body, mild carbonation, and dry finish."
"I must say, I was quite surprised at this one. Its ghastly appearance had not only no head at all, but it had large, clear bubbles as though I had just aggresively poured tea into the glass. This doesn't even look like beer. The colour is dark reddish brown. The smell was fabulous! Loads of burnt chocolate malts and coffee. Nearly devoid of hops. The taste, too, is full of chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee. Mouthfeel is quite thin and much lighter in weight than one would be lead to believe. This is a delicious, wonderfully smelling, and easy to drink porter. Aside from its peculiar appearance, I say this is one of my favourites."
"Poured a dark ruby colored body with a small half finger head. Smell is of sweat malts and coffee. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy. Taste starts out sweat and finishes with a bite of coffee flavor that stays around for a few seconds after the sip. Overall a very enjoyable brew and one of the best porters I have had to date."
"D - very tasty robust porter, I highly recommend it if you can find it"
"All in all this is easy to drink and something that porter and stout lovers should enjoy well enough."
"Just like most things out of this brewery it is very drinkable. So, when you go to the liquor store and see that it is $4 a bottle just repeat to yourself that it is worth it."
"One and done for the night for me, but I'd definitely have another some other time."
" This is extremely drinkable and closer to a true milk stout than I thought was legal. Now I'm definitely pumped to go back to Suffolk Co. and check this place out."
"Taste is a good balance of sweet malts and spicyish hoppyness. Some dark fruit sweetness is in there, and a bit of a coffee/espresso twang. Mouthfeel is slightly chewy, slightly slick. A pretty good porter, drinkable, not too heavy- but nothing terribly exciting."
"Despite my lack of really particular details, the somewhat rambling order of this review illustrates my happiness with this porter. One of the very best I've tried from the UK side of the pond!"
"Overall a decent beer, good in it's own right. Nice one to try, but i doubt i'll ever have it again."
"I would recommend trying this one and I will have another, but they are much better porters out there."
"Dark Brown pour from a very cool Victorian looking medicine bottle. Toasted malt aroma, but very light and you really have to breathe deep to smell it. Bitterness is very present. Only mildly toasted flavors of coffee and choclate. Has a sassafrass sweetness initially, but the bitter dominates."
"Pours very dark brown to black color, a vigorous pour resulted in a small head that dissipated quickly. Chocolate malt aroma. Taste is excellent, theres quite a bit going on I'm sure others could point out specific flavors, lets just say its nicely balanced, nice amount of astringency and finishes dark chocolate like. One of my favorite styles, and this is one of the best I've had. Highly recommend, as are the others I've had from this brewery. I'm not sure if I like this or their cream stout better... guess I'll have to try them side by side."
"Pours flat, dark brown to black in color...very little lacing. Strong coffee notes in the smell along with a nutty and fruity aroma. Rather nice. Taste is very much like cold coffee to start (especially with the lack of any carbonation) quite bitter but still fairly tasty despite that. Somewhat sweet aftertaste in fact. The only detractor for me is the wateriness but other than that I like it. Very smooth going down and would suggest this to anyone who likes a solid porter."
"1 pint .9 ounce uniquely shaped bottle. This beer has a dark reddish brown color with a small, creamy head. The aroma is just a bit roasty with chocolate and nuts. Malty flavor with a nice nuttiness. A little bit acidic. Just a hint of cherry flavor. The finish is dry and roasty and just a little bit metallic. Some skunk, but not enough to ruin the beer. The body is thin, but the flavor is quite nice. Good drinkability."
"Cool looking green medicine bottle. Pours a dark brown color, with lots of ruby tones. Thick frothy tan head. Decent retention, not much lace on the sides of the glass. Milk chocolate and buttery aroma. Slightly vinous nose. Very smooth, light roasty and chocolate flavors. Low hop bitterness, and just a hint of sourness. Earthy hop flavor. Low carbonation, light to medium in body. Vevry drinakble. Very good English-style porter."
"the last of a motherload of beers my wife bought for me this past christmas. pours with almost no head, and what there is clears almost immediately. very black, not not opaque. Odor is very chocolately, sort of like putting your nose in a bag of dark chocolate chips. roasted smell too and some alcohol is apparant. Smooth, roasted flavor, almost charcoal like. some grassy, dried leaf flavors too. Smooth and gulpable. Overall, fandiddly-tastic. my first St. Peter goes over great."
"Taste was dry and bitter, burned, licorice. Very nice medium body. This is a mix of old and fresh beer, which add complexity and make it different from other porters I had, which were more sticky. In my opinion this beer leans towards a stout."
"One of the better UK ( I think) beers I had lately, will have to look further into the reviews to verify what's happening here. Wherever it comes from,I highly reccomend, could drink this all night. After a quick post from Jason I learned this is indeed from the UK, but there is a brewery by the same name in Australia. My search parameters were not very good..."
"A good first Porter for those new to the style."
"Drinkability - very solid porter but pricy at 4$ per."
"Cheers!"
"Presentation: Packaged in an elegant half-liter flask of dark green glass with raised embossing, in the style of the late 1700's, although, alas, it probably adds significantly to the cost of this beer. Served in a standard pint tap glass."
"Overall - A pretty good and very drinkable porter. Definitely worth a try..."
"The taste is just as good. Has a nice up front chocolate with a good mix of sweet, sour, and bitter. Very earthy with little roasted bitterness. This truly seems like an old-school blend of stock, pale, and bitter. Doesn't linger on the palate for too long. This is a highly drinkable English porter."
"Pours black ruby in color with a short and creamy tan head that fades into a ring of lace. Nose is dark caramel blended with a peaty earthiness and a touch of a rather funky aroma that Im having a hard time placing (bleu cheese perhaps?). Moderate in body, perhaps a bit thin. Taste begins with fresh coffee and unsweetened chocolate with a bit of burnt caramel. Earthy hops round out the finish which is quite dry. An interesting portercertainly worth a try."
"Appearance aside, I'm fully impressed with this ones taste..roasted black coffee, light nutty and chocolatey notes, and a damn fine burnt atertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy, although light-bodied, and totally satisfying. I will definitely pick one of these up again."
"Body between mediun and light with a slick, smooth mouthfeel."
"Pours a deep brown which turns a rich burgundy when held up to the light with a nice tan head which leaves a nice wall of fine bubbles on the sides of the glass. I was a little bit concerned about it coming in a green glass bottle, and indeed there was a descrenible skunkiness upon opening the bottle, but it did disappear and the beers roasted chocolately nutty aroma came through. Unsweetened chocolate plays heavily on the palate with some roasted malts and finishing with a lingering almost nutty finish. A very pleasant and easy-drinking porter. Nice silky mouthfeel and all around a decent little import from the LCBO this fall."
"Like a stout. Looks dark like a porter, but light mouthfeel and chalkiness. Understated carbonated. Tabacco. Drop of chocolate malt. Nice drinking really. Good roasted barley.One-dimensional. Alcohol in nose. Cool bottle, drink this fresh at the LCBO as the glass looks susceptible to UV damage."
"Clear, dark ruby/brown colour with a thin, light brown head. Moderate lacing. Very roasted aroma with plenty of chocolate malt. Ripe, fruity character as well, reminiscent of cherries. Pronounced bitterness, seemingly from dark malts as well as hops. Still, plenty of roasted maltiness and a hint of fruit. Lingering roasted and bitterness follow the appearance of dark chocolate towards the end. Medium carbonation is well integrated and melds well with the texture. A tasty beer, a little more roasted than I expect in a porter, but good all the same."
"Pours a rich red/brown, topped by a big off white head, very creamy looking, head settles down nicely. Smell is coffee and roasted grains, some chocolate, iron and bread. Taste is iron, roasted coffee, little chocolate, taste is rather weak. Mouthfeel felt pretty thin, carbonation is low, disappointing."
"Overall, this beer has fantastic aromatic characteristics along with a nice bitter taste and mouthfeel that make it worthwhile for any porter fans."
"D: Very drinkable, smooth flavours, nothing over-powering."
"Drinkability: Um...cool bottle. This tastes how regular Guinness initially did to me, before I educated my palate and discovered that it was beef jerky water."
"Poured into a pint glass. Appeared tired and broken down. No head or lacing to speak of. The bottle design keeps it from being dissapointing before the first whiff. I enjoyed the earthy coffee and burnt malt aroma. Tasted a burnt flavor but also a sweet malt finish and some bitterness. watery mouthfeel with no carbonation. It actually was highly drinkable as it was inoffensive and goes down smooth. Seemed to be a run of the mill porter that follows the guidlines but fails to shine."
"OVERALL COMMENTS: Wonderful balance  nice subtle black malt kick, just the right amount of sweetness, and easy on the alcohol  Ill be back for sure!"
"Overall Impression: Interesting taste. All the bits just dont seem to fit together though. I like the citric hop finish, I can appreciate the roasted start, and the sweet-water middle is fair just disjointed somehow. Still, an enjoyable porter, and Im not crazy about porters. Cool bottle though. Ill drink this one, but cant see myself ordering one again."
"Edit: After getting to the bottom of the glass, the flavor is less offensive. Tones of chocolate and coffee are showing through."
"Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful! I am so happy to have discovered this beer. This would pair well with dessert, or serve it as dessert by itself. This is easily the best beer I have tried for the first time this year, and I highly recommend it to all BA's."
"Mouthfeel is light and clean, easy to drink. Ease of drink probably leaves it less than it could be. This one seems to hit the style mark but doesn't really do much more than that."
"I really like their bottles for the certain 'it's gotta be good for me' quality. The pour is a really dark brown with amber hues when the light hits it. Light brown thing head that laced aggressively. Smoke and ash (wood) on the nose, with a bit of baker's chocolate.. very pleasant and probably better in the winter. Lots of malt, baker's chocolate, caramel, some light unidentifiable tartness. Consistent throughout with a distinct coffee-like aftertaste. Creamy and just barely thick enough but feels 'right' and very drinkable."
"This beer is extremely drinkable and I was very pleasantly surprised. Very, very good. Highly recommended!"
"NO head a'tall. Very dark brown with hints of purple, red, and yellow all about the thinner areas. Strong aroma of roasted coffee beans and dark chocolate. The tartness of berries is also present. Beautiful nose. The taste is of strong malts that fade into the coffee and chocolate present in the smell. Very sweet finish. It's very strange; at first, I don't taste much of anything. The beauty of the various aforementioned tastes comes very late in the sip. Mouthfeel: Ug. It's terribly watery with a tingly finish. Unfortunately, this strange mouthfeel all but kills the drinkability. Still, it's a very pleasant choice if mouthfeel is not an issue for the drinker."
"Cask conditioned at the 32nd Cambridge Beer Festival, gravity dispense. Very dark brown to chestnut, nearly black. Lovely strong aroma of roast malts, dark chocolate and prunes. Notes of oak and cigars too. Flavour is roasty, smooth and mellow with chocolate notes. Roasty aftertaste. Very good."
"Even though I dinged it a little on mouth, I would call this a very drinkable beer. I could see this as a great beer all seasons and with food."
"Drinkability: A bit different and perplexing initially but a porter I can certainly warm up to"
"Very easy to put back, and although I was underwhelmed I would recommend giving it a shot."
"The flavor is pretty malty when the beer first hits the tongue. The malt gives way to some bitterness from the black patent malt and a mild, spicy hop bitterness. While this beer is nothing special it is unusually drinkable and goes down very quickly."
"This beer is not as thick as some of the stouts produced by St. Peter's brewery, but is it is pretty dark when poured. There is no head. The taste is almost like meat, pretty heavy and layered. I think this is the different kinds of grain that are added into the mix. But the consistency is hard to get over, thick like molasses and about the same amount to taste. Any fan of the traditional heavy English Porter will adore this beer."
"This is probably my number two or three porter, and one I would buy again in an instant if it wre available to me on a regular basis."
"Although these porters are often lighter in body than their look implies, St. Peter's is even lighter than that. Not very substantial. So while the flavors that develop are wonderful, they are delivered in a disappointing package. If this is what defines ""old-style", then I guess I prefer ""new-fangled""."
"Rootbeer like color in the glass with a smalish beige head that does not last long. The beer comes in a medicine bottle (oval shaped green glass). Nose smells like sweetish black jelly beans (anise). Dry slightly smokey inital taste with a medicinal sweetish back side. Lightish on the mouth and tongue. The finish leaves a dry malty tongue. Not exciting but different."
"Deep garnet body with a minimalist head. Great aroma consisting of sweet roasted malt and brown sugars. Nice caramel note as well. The flavor is a bit smoky, with hints of molasses. Very unbalanced. The mouthfeel is thin as well, and the drinkability suffers because of it. Great bottle, nice aroma, poor beer."
"This is quite a drinkable brew. Not as full bodied or hoppy like the American porter, but good enough to make me want to go out and sample the other two styles by this brewery that are on shelf at my favorite store."
"Taste: Not nearly as round and complex as the aroma. Bitter coffee and roasted malts upfront. This developed into a muddled hops bitterness in the middle. The finish was a continuation of the bitterness, as well as some tangy dark fruits and cream."
"It's hard to say why I don't love this porter. It is a complex and flavorful brew (if somewhat muted). Does it need more body? Most beers this light in body don't display the array of flavors in St. Peter's. Do I crave more hops? I don't consider myself a hophead, but I have come to expect more aggressive hopping. I don't find any major flaw in this porter, I just want a little more intensity."
"Very nice English-style porter."
"An unexpectedly nice tasting porter!"
"Picked up this brew on a whim the other day for the Thanksgiving Holiday and just tried it last evening. I guess the shape of the bottle is what drew me to the brew, odd old type of a bottle. The brew it self poured to a deep dark brown color that was more close to black than brown but the light that was able to filtered through gave it ruby highlights. The head on this brew was very small and had a cream tan color that left some lacing. I guess the lack of a head could have been due to my careful pour, maybe a little to careful? Over all it is a fair looking brew. The aroma is pretty good with highlights of chocolate, roasted malt along with an earthy scent. The taste had a sweet taste at first then broke to a stronger malt taste highlighted by a accompanying hop taste that went well with it adding a degree of spice. Over all it is a pretty nice tasting brew. One thing that I did notice is that it is a dry brew and it also feels almost watered down for a mouthfeel? Not a bad brew and one that I would have again but do feel that there are other better Porter examples. Definitely am intrigued buy the bottle and would like to try some of the other brews they offer."
"The appearance and smell do not reveal the taste of this brew. Nothing overly complicated but a nice nutty and smoky taste to the malt. Smoky, roastes, burnt malt flavors. Roasted nuts and hints of vanilla. Lightly metallic. Medium bodied. Very smooth porter and pretty unique to most that I have tried. Very good."
"A slightly above average porter. Not one I'll try again. In all honesty, the bottle was what grabbed my attention in the first place. The porter itself is nothing special."
"An old school Porter from a flask bottle that looks like it should have patent medicine in it. Very dark black, just a little light comes through at the bottom. Dark tan head rises and falls in a minute. Nice thick lacing on the glass. Heavy aroma, malty but pruney with lots of spicing and slight medicinal qualities. Thick and chewy mouthfeel. Flavor is interesting in its depth and layers -- more prunes, fortified wine, dark roasted senses, a seeming layer of ashy bitters at the finish. Aroma keeps backing up the flavors in the mouth. Interesting rendition, lots of flavors to note that imply more alcohol than is really around. Reminds me of what an historical Porter may have tasted like, tavern owners blending all sorts of brews and even adding strange and unexpected flavorings for balance and color. The drinkability is kind of subjective to me, its a little different."
" Pass on this brew and try their stout, it's much better."
"A good porter. Really enjoyed it."
"Drinkability  This is a good Porter that both entertains and satisfies. There are a lot of interesting things going on here, so have some fun with it."
"The beer pours a translucent dark brown/ almost black color with a 1/4"" creamy tan head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a rich malty scent that boasts of roasted, chocolate, and crystal malts. It has an intense toastey feel. The taste is decent. It has a rich and dry black malt flavor with a lingering grainy aftertaste. It has a nice chocolate flavor that would be enhanced it the mouthfeel were any better. The mouthfeel sucks. It is a full bodied beer with very low carbonation. This porter has good aroma and flavor, but because the mouthfeel is lacking, the drinkability suffers. It's one and done for me."
"St. Peter's Old-Style Porter is a fine example of the classic porter style and is, no doubt, exactly what its brewers intended it to be. Since this is my review though, I can't ignore my big beer bias. As a result, I'll have to downgrade it just a tad. For those who like the English Porter style, this is pretty good stuff."
"This is a relatively lame porter, albeit one that came in a cool looking bottle. If there's no good beer available, it's a passable choice, but that's about it. I don't think I'll be picking this one up again."
"Plus, my wife likes the bottle."
"they get points added for a classy and very unusual bottle. This one poured very bark, allmost black with a very large head, that got me worried it had gone bad, no worries as the head dissipated to a fluffy off white crown. Left nice, well developed lacing. Malty, burnt grain nose. Tasty drinkable porter, burnt notes, chocolate, light coffee, good depth of flavor, very enjoyable with a steak and salad. I'm interested to now try the others in this line of brews."
"Poured more of rich tawny brown with not much head just a soapy-like semblence of one but the nice rich color made up for the lack of head,aroma was nutty with milk chocolate presence as well with just a touch of coffee.Taste is the same alot of nuttiness with an almost almond flavored coffee drink flavor to it,now I have a problem with the wateriness of this brew though really thin I think compared to American counterparts wich Iam used to.None the less this a easy drinking flavorful porter with a cool bottle I would buy again and will."
"The bottle is rather interesting, albeit green - its kind of flask shaped and indeed, on the back they say its a replica of a bottle made in 1770 here in the USA. The mouth is a tad small though and causes a bit of excessive splashing on the pour. Nevertheless, the beer comes out fine, as the head - which is a tad small - is composed of fine small bubbles. The beer itself is a bit light in color, more of a dark brown rather than black, which is fine for some porter styles. The aroma seems a bit one-dimensional: its all coffee, roasty malt. But thats OK, in this case the simplicity is nice and helps you focus on the beer itself. The flavor is a tad bitter from roasted burnt malts, not too sharp, with a faint hint of malt in the background. The aftertaste seems to accentuate the bitterness. The mouthfeel is a little thin, with some slight astringency (think: tea). But overall this is pretty nice, maybe not my favorite porter but not bad either."
"One inch of beige, thick, still head leaves full, lacy lacing. The beer is dark, dark, brown-red-brown (almost black in low light). Bitter chocolate in the roasty nose; tangy underneath. The beer starts smoky, tangy, bitter. Middle is thick, a little oily with bitter chocolate. Finish is quite bitter, very tangy (almost acidic) and there's a smoky aftertaste. Interesting. Smoky, tangy, bitter, with some nice chocolate notes. I'm enjoying the fantasy that maybe this is what the original porters might have tasted like. Better warm."
"Taste- well, I would love to say it tasted as good as it smelled, but i got pretty much what I expected; tasted much like a Guiness; pretty bland, malty for the most part, and not very carbonated. However, i did get the caramel taste in the coffee so that was a plus. Mouthfeel, it was pretty light, and did not seem as though it would be hard to drink 2 or even 3 of these. It was not very heavy, but was okay. I still give Guiness the thumbs up over St. Pete's...."
"Gotta love the flask of a bottle too."
"Dark brown in hue, black in the middle, shiny ruby around the edges; the color is attractive. A beige head topped the beer, it was a finger in height on a harder than normal pour. The head retention was fair, after a moment it faded to a foamy cap and then to a loose collar. The subsequent lacing was spotty. The nose is soft; it smells like chocolate milk with a dash of coffee in it. At the back are notes of astringent roast. Overall the bouquet isnt very complex. However the smells are quite inviting. Then I smelled it again, after a few moments, and I got a suggestion of tobacco leaves, husks, and some earthy hops. Really working to pick up the details paid off. Lovely. Still, the potency is too low. The palate is awesome. This is a tasty porter. It is much roastier tasting that the nose leads on. Tricky bastard. There is a good amount of astringency, charcoal, charred husks, bittersweet chocolate, distant lactose sweetness, and earthy flavors. I am deeply impressed. The finish is long and charred. I bet this beer would really match nicely with some KC-style BBQ. The aftertaste is equally long, very roasty and even a little sweet. I really like this porter! It is not the most complex porter Ive enjoyed but this is one of the yummiest. Sometimes there is nothing wrong with being a straight shooter. Medium/medium-full in body, low carbonation. The mouthfeel is pleasantly filling. It is a meal in a bottle. This is a very drinkable and agreeable beer. I really enjoyed it. My dear girlfriend Tara bought me a bottle in Iowa City because she liked how the bottle looked. Luckily I liked how the beer tasted! Recommended."
"Light bodied, simple, quaffable and standard, despite it flaws."
"Pours out a dark brown black with a short tan head which quit too quick. Tastes nice and almost stouty, but who am I to draw the line between the styles. Nice and full for the style which I like. Not a great porter, but certainly a solid one worth tasting if you see it. I'm enjoying the brew."
"Light brown in color, small creamy light tan head that doesn't last, aroma of dark roasted coffee and malts. Light body, thin and watery mouthfeel. Smokey coffee and chocolate flavors, with a light smokey burnt bitterness in the finish, some what watery, very drinkable."
"Drinkability: A beer I would go out of my way to find...and a perfect session beer for those with discriminating taste and a deep line of credit."
"This is a decent porter, and probably more true to the traditional style than others. Its black with hints of mahogany and ruby. Its short lived head gives way to some nice Belgian lace. The flask style bottle is aesthetically pleasing. Aroma is of a firm chocolatey malt mostly with some yeast and subdued hop scents. The taste is of chocolate, coffee, sweet malts, and mild hop bitterness, in fact most of the bitterness seems to come from the dark chocolatey black malts rather than the hops. The carbonation is very light. The mouthfeel seems peculiarly oily or slick. The flavors are very well balanced and this is an above average porter. Will definitely try it again."
"Conclusion: A well-crafted, dry porter."
"The taste is very solid and fulfilling. There is a hint of coffee along with an ever so subtle chocolate quality. It doesn't feel as smooth as it could in the mouth, but that's the closest thing I have to an actual complaint."
"$3.69 a bottle"
"A dark reddish brown colour, with a mediumthick creamy head. It smell dark chocolate and pepper, with some hints of hops. The taste is roasted and a bit smokey. It also have some hints of coffee and chocolate. The aftertaste is long and bitter. This is a very nice porter and i think it would go very well with a pice of chocolate cake."
"Drinkability: Excellent. I could drink another few of these, easy. Very tasty."
"OK, the St. Peter's bottles sell this beer for me. Something a little different once in a while is nice. In appearance the beer is an impenetrable dark brown with very little head or lace with the pour. The beer's flavor makes me think of Hershey's dark chocolate, with the bittereness of that candy. I wish I could've had more but there were three of us sharing one bottle."
"It pours black with some ruby tinges and a tan head. There is some roasted malt aroma as well as slight whiskey and charcoal notes. The body is smooth with some coffee and bittersweet chocolate flavors and again some slight whiskey. It is nice to see a porter like this."
"The beer after vamoosing from the unique green bottle pours a deep incarnadine color, the head mediocre in size, the texture creamy and the Irish lace pronounced on the sides of the glass. Nose is a tad earthy, somewhat sweet, fresh and crisp, seems to be a hint of peat? Start is lightly sweet, nice malt profile; the top is fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has a nice mild acidity, the hops pleasing in their spiciness, quite dry and a nice mild English Porter, one worth a sample at least."
"The finish is satisfying and bitter. The mouthfeel is gentle, inviting. On the whole, this simple ale comes across as relaxing and highly pleasurable to drink. The aroma really came alive towards the end."
"Although this is a nice creamy beer, the downside is that this beer remains too light-bodied for the style. A very nice sipping beer containing rich qualities without being overpowering or heavy. A little too light bodied for my liking but still, the good outweighs the bad here."
"Bottle - Poured a translucent dark brew with absolutely no head and no carbonation. Aroma of toffee. Taste is a bit sweet, with some toffee and some bitterness. Im not sure if this is a bad bottle, but the lack of carbonation is very annoying and leaves a bad taste in my mouth. This beer also lacks a strong body and the chocolate/coffee taste should be more detectable. Overall, a very disappointing beer that I will try at least one more time to ensure that I didnt get a bad bottle."
"Appears black at first but is actually very dark ruby. Fruity aroma, vinous and unusual, with caramel in there too. Flavour is balanced with malt and fruit in the fore, slight (note: only slight) papery notes from shallow carbonation detract a bit though (I'm not complaning). A bit of citrus but mainly malt in the aftertaste. Good but not outstanding."
"Lots of muscle in this beer, a nice quaff."
"This beer makes my list of true winners."
"I'm not really a porter fan, but I liked the looks of the bottle and thought that I'd try it out. It pours a dark reddish black, and resembles Coca Cola. It was a very smooth drink, free from the normal bitter aftertaste that I associate with porters. It was a pleseant surprise. I recommend this to anyone who wants a ""beginner's"" porter."
"Poured into a glass it creates a magnificent thick foamy tan head. The aroma is a tantalizing mixture of coffee and caramel. Very good roasted malt flavor with hints of chocolate and coffee. The finish is a great balance between the roasted bitterness and a light malty sweetness, also there is a gentle hint of licorice. I definitely could sit around and enjoy a couple of pints of this porter without any arm twisting."
"Drinkability is notable. At least it's not laden with a phenomenal ABV that one bottle later I'm welded to my seat!"
"16.9 ounce bottle, the medicine one."
"Pours dark brown with red/copper tints. Small creany medium tan head. Nose of chocolate and sour notes with a small amount of roasted barley. Tastes of semi-sweet chocolate, mild coffee with a somewhat dry finish. Relatively thin mouthfeel yet refreshing. Mild hop note on the back end. Very drinkable beer got better as it warmed."
"A very nice offering. Extremely dark color with a great creamy head that laces nicely down a pint glass. Smell had a yeasty lemony quality. Taste had elements of smoke, lemon, possibly a hint of chocolate. Hop presence was present but not overwhelming. Very drinkable with a decent body, that left a nice dry, somewhat hoppy finish. Very interesting flask bottle and label. Might make a good stocking stuffer for Porter fans."
"This bottle reminds me more of an Old England elixer than it does beer. Long story short, the bottle may be cooler than the beer. It pours out very flat with a very thin head that quickly disappeared. It poured out a very nice chocolate color. The smell is typical of porter-style beer. Full nutty taste fill your mouth immediately but are dont linger very long. My first choice of beer is usually not a porter, but when i have a good one, I really enjoy it. This is an easy beer to drink, but has no special qualities that would make me run back to buy another."
"Quite complex and interesting."
"It's very dark brown, not opaque though. The head is tan and thick, nice looking beer. A mellow roasty chocolate aroma treats. I'm immediately pleased with the solid presence of hops in the finish. On the way to that finish is a buttery roasty feeling of chocolateness. It's very smooth and not very thick at all, not too thin though. The hoppy finish is dry and wonderful. This is an awesome porter."
"Surely worth your time."
"beautiful stupendous head and retention, very nice amount of lace. the color of the beer is dark amber, quite dark. scents of port wine, a hint of coffee, caramel and an array of hops. a nice molasses too. it's a creamy and straight ahead porter a little toasty and woody with the major players being a crisp coffee and caramel, a slight sweet gets roasted in the middle and dries for the finish. very bubbly and active mouthfeel but i am going to stick to my guns on the creamy note i had at the start of this review. very drinkable...maybe when i'm rich!"
"I sampled this at a Moscow beer bar. It came out room temperature, which didn't hurt it at all. Poured a nice deep burgundy brown under a two fingered tan head with plenty of contour and staying power. Mine left some very nice lacework down the side of the glass. The smell was mostly caramel and nuts, with just a hint of smokiness. The mouth was heavy with sweetness and appropriately carbonated. The taste was as it should be - a bit sweet, with malts and plums and caramel, chased by a mild hoppy bitterness and just a touch of roastiness. The plum and hops built the aftertaste, which was quite pleasant. I'm a sucker for a good porter, and this is a good one."
"A very English Style Porter, in a Bottle originally designed in America, from Englands most innovative and interesting Brewery, sampled back in Long Beach, USA. Circles within Circles. This is a very good, high quality offering. Now THIS  would be very good if served on Cask, I just know it would!"
"A blend of old and new ales - they combine for a very nice beer. Quite mellow, with chocolate and some gentle chrarcoal-ish flavors. Normally, a beer this mild tends to be one-dimensional, but here we have both depth of flavor and softness. A nice ""comfort food"" sort of porter."
"Nice olive green flask-style bottle. It pours a red tinged dark chocolate color. The beige head of various sized bubbles fades to a constantly thin-rimmed coating. I enjoy the coffee and chocolate aroma. The whiff of malt, light smoke, burnt caramel and hops are present as well. Chocolate malt with sweet caramel and mild coffee mingle quite nicely. A pleasant citrus bitterness and light taste of plums provide some balance. Nice Porter!"
"Notes: Not too robust, very sweet flavors with slight roasted bitterness. Good beer. Might be a good intro to darker flavors."
"This is a very characteristic English-Style porter, comparable to Fuller's in many ways. While this in a good brew, I prefer my porter's with more body."
"A little light for my liking -- very see-through and more reddish than brown/black. Looks like a weak dopplebock. Decent head but no real retention. There's a lot going on in the nose here. Very roasted and sooty with some s'more chocolate. Lightly roasted malts, coffee character, and a semi-sweet chocolate are covered by a hoppy finish that balances nicely. A little light in color and in body. A good porter but not outstanding."
"F"
"Drinkability is through the roof. Give me ten of these, please. A sweet, drinkable, smooth, very friendly porter."
"This one poured a medium brown color with no head on it. Smelled of weak malt and hop mix. Taste was quite good but also quite weak. Roasted wood comes to mind here. Floral hops are in the background and come through by the middle. Other flavors are too weak to detect but they are there. Finishes roasty and leaves me wanting more. Like the color, the body was too thin to be a porter. This could have been really good with a nice bold body to it. However it was quite drinkable, I feel like I could drink a whole lot of these in one night . . . (but not at how much they cost!)"
"ng"
"There was very little head on this beer which had a nice dark brown colored body. The aroma has a hint of coffee in it. Some carbonation rolls off the tongue, but not much. It has a pleasant taste indicative of the porters I have drunk, but it was not as good as some of the other Porters. Still it is a beer I can drink all night long."
"St. Peters Old-Style Porter comes in a unique, olive green, flask shaped bottle. The info on the bottle say that this is a blend of mature old ale and young light ale. It pours an opaque, deep brown that allows a little ruby to show through when held up to the light. There is minimal head with poor retention and a just little lacing. The aroma is sweet, healthy and earthy, like fruity chocolate. The flavor is sweet yet roasty and full. Overall a delicious porter."
"A brewery reintroducing us to an old method of blending old and young beers. A good one for the curious, as the results are an aquired taste not unlike a lambic. It is a reddish brown brew with a tiny tan head. The aroma is very complex with notes of molasses, malt, raisin and licorice. It has a tangy malt and hop flavor with a rich malt finish that's dry and acidic like a red wine. It reminds me of some of the flavors I noticed in Sam Smith's Imperial Stout. Give it a try even if just to support this type of experimentation."
"Not a great 'quaffing"" beer to say the least..yet intresting stuff here!"
"Thanks to Uglyradio!"
"Translucent brown color. Some roasted malt and chocolate is noted in the aroma as well as the flavor. Malt backbone is lackinga bit thin. The roasted malt lends a faint bitterness thats passable I guess. Is this old style? True to style? I dont know. But Ill pass next time. Theres too many others that are far better IMHO."
"Drinkability: Average. This is an interesting brew, having been brewed to old porter standards, where an aged, dark ale and a young, lighter ale would be mixed to create porter. Having said that, I don't think I would go back to this one often."
"Not a fan of this beer for the style it claimed to be, it seemed to have real taste of chocolate and caramel in the beer from it's natural grains. It was as if they had actually added flavors artificially to mash. It had a small and fleeting head and seemed a bit watery and flat on mouthfeel. It tasted was sweeet and finished tha same as it tasted to start. My friend had one and said it was real good and compared it to a local Beer in Bru Room @bar in new haven, CT "" damm good expresso stout"" which is the greatest beer I have ever had in a brew pub, but I'll review that one at a later when I finish undercovering all is many complexities. . My point I guess about my friend is that he knows nothing about beer [after making those comments] or life for that matter and he was drunk. This beer was just average and one dimensional. I will not buy this beer again,"
"Pours a deep amber witha small head and leaves some lace. Fruity aroma with hints of dark chocolate, yeast and a buttery scent. A bit thin for a porter but did have a smooth mouthfeel. Taste started roasted malt and grain with a little spiciness. Finishes with a somewhat sour twang that is undesirable. If the aftertaste was better, this would be pretty good. Could have been a bad bottle, so I may give it another shot."
"This beer is a very dark, almost black, tea-like color.  It presents a very thin, shallow head and a magnificent roasted grain aroma.  Also, the smell has some floral characteristics and a little alcohol can be detected.  The taste is of bitter coffee, with burnt and roasted grain flavors.  Overall, the beer is very dry, however, and nicely complex.  The finish is a lingering bitterness.  Great beer...I liked the bottle too."
"Oily black w/ rusty accents, pours with almost no head.  Strong dark chocolate with hints of roasted coffee on the nose.  Taste is roasty, malty and sweet with prominent bitter chocolate and coffee notes.  Very thin mouthfeel, finishes rather brief with a faint lingering smokiness.  Drinks very smooth and easy with blatant yet pleasant flavor."
"Notes: Old style porter to say the least, A blend of old and new beer. A very well structured beer with lots of flavour going on … a sharp cheddar and whole grain crackers pairs extremely well with this one."
"Enjoyable"
"Pours a deep amber and decent head. Huge baked apple and raisin nose. More apple on the tongue held up with roasted malt and some grain. Although there are some good things happening in this brew a most evident sour and fruity character make it weak as a porter."
"Forced to buy this, you know who has ever seen a 12oz oval bottle?  Anyway a good porter, some dry spiciness, low carbonation and head."
