"Medium bodied, reasonably smooth and with a solid warming aspect. Effervescence is restrained. It drinks like an Imperial wheat - which I've never heard of - and in that mindset this is a really good beer. As a standard wheat, it's ok. Either way, the nose is a bit off so don't take a deep whiff before you sip and it'll be good."

"O: I had low expectations and while this isn't a beer I would seek out, I was pleasantly surprised;"

"O - Kind of a one note beer and drinks kinda like soda. Not bad and very drinkable, but won't be picking this up again."
"O: A little tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, good kick, decent representation of style, itâ€™s an ok beer worth drinking for a while."

"O - At $2.99 a bomber, it's a ""good price for a good beer"". Not a spectacular beer, but well worth the investment. Personally, I would still spend the extra $1 for my fall-back SNPA as a replacement for this... Worth a try, but it won't become a regular in my lineup."

"A lot going on in this beer. Not sure how well it succeeded."

"I don't like this at all. It has a bitterness to it, but nothing else from the IPA style. It has a wheat thinness, but none of the good wheat beer characters. It's like an amalgam of everything that could go wrong in either style, creating a synergy of badness. Very poor indeed."
"O- An interesting combination of flavors and styles. A bit too strong to be a seesion beer. It paired well with some jalapno salami and dark pretzels. Not something I would seek out by itself."
"- If this brew was as clean and perfected as it was meant to be, it may have some super high marks. The early boil hopping is nice, and the wheat bill is heavy and well played, but just some slight imperfections kind of drew this beer down a notch or two. I can see where it's going though."

"Wheat smoothness + US hops = easy drinker."
"My first stab at an American dark wheat ale. Pours an orange/brown color, nice fluffy head to it that stays consistent all the way down. Nice maltiness in the flavor, hints of lemon and fruitiness, good hop character as well. Reminds of me a dunkelweizen, as it should, and is pretty drinkable and smooth going down. Not the most adventurous beer, but solid and worth a try."
"22 oz bottle from Roths Keizer store. $5.49 Lighter orange coloured ale..slighly hazed.large,rocky,thick white head. Fine citric like hop aromas..lemony with a hint of Belgian style yeast..pretty nice Unusual but juicy,fruity ,lemony hop tastes melds with the yeasts and peppery spices very well. Nice on the palate..very inviting. Overall an unusual and welcome beer"
"O: While I've never been amazed with Black Diamond's beers, all the ones I've had have been well made and enjoyable. This is no different. Sort of a lighter Little Sumpin' Sumpin'. Described on the back as a beer for the dog days, and I agree."
"Drinkability- I thought it was pretty good. I would drink it again."
"Looks nice with a sizable white head in the tall glass. It's certainly an odd beer, one you keep sipping to try to figure it out. Pleasant, however, and well carbonated. A little thin and sharp rather than the mellowness of many big wheat beers. Sort of an imperial American wheat."
"Finish is the biggest appeal to me. Long lasting and bold. Big green pepper, light grass, hints of unripe stone fruit and bitter lemon skin and pine. Finish is complex and the strength of this one. Not great but a nice effort."
