"Offhand I'm not sure I've had another Imperial Black Wheat.  The coffee flavor dominates and that is fine with me!  Very drinkable coffee flavored beer - glad I have more in the fridge!"

"Pours a brown color. 1/4 inch head of an off-white color. Good retention and slight lacing. Smells of coffee, hint of sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of pale malt, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of an American Dark Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of coffee, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of hop, hint of alcohol, and slight yeast. Overall, good aroma, body, and blend. The coffee is an amazing attribute in both aroma and body."

"O - A phenomenal beer from 3 Sheeps. In a blind taste I would bet anyone would think they are drinking a coffee stout. Only the finish may give it away if you really have a developed palate. Coffee is big and bold in this beer. Highly recommend it!"

"A great, unique, dark wheat ale. The coffee and malt make love together with enough roast and just a hint of earthy hops to make it well-balanced. Wonderfully made and certainly enjoyable!"

"O - Well hello there, Joe. I feel like I should have poured you into a ceramic mug because you're damn near coffee! This 3 Sheeps seasonal offering screams freshly ground, freshly brewed coffee through and through, so much so in fact, it's hard to detach the mind from the bean long enough to admire it's gently wheat and balanced roasted malt flavor. If the beer smells this good, I can't even imagine how fantastic the brewhouse must smell on Joe brew day! If it's straight-up coffee you're looking for in a beer, look no further."
"Fantastic coffee beer. So glad I grabbed this based on previous reviews and a recommendation at the store. I HATE the taste of a fresh cup of coffee. Coffee in beer I tend to find amazing. This fits that bill. Packs the coffee flavor of a say a Bourbon County Coffee, but drinks so much easier. This beer is a must for coffee/coffee beer lovers! 3 Sheeps will grab peoples attention with this concoction for sure."

"Had on tap at a Milwaukee beer festival last summer. Lovely coffee aroma (from Alterra, a great Milwaukee roaster) with a flavor that doesn't overwhelm, this is a wonderful variation on their already-terrific Baaad Boy wheat. Pours nicely too, even on a chilly day."

"Overall, a very unique and delicious coffee beer. Lighter bodied and smoother than most coffee stouts, but also well balanced between the roasty character and the sweetness of the brew."
