It was a perfect desert beer and not too sweet for me.  It drank almost too easy for me and the six pack did not last too long.  I strongly recommend this beer if you want a sweet holiday or desert beer that everyone will like.  I will not hesitate to buy this again.","VTR","Dec 15, 2014"

Head retention is decent, and there isn't much lacing. Aroma is nice and sweet, it smells mostly like milk chocolate and malted milk balls, along with some wheat/bready malt and vanilla. I think the taste is just like the aroma, however I think the malted milk ball flavor is the strongest of them. Mouthfeel/body is thin, but it's also a bit slick with moderate carbonation. This isn't a bad brew at all, I liked it. Definitely worth a try, especially if you like sweet chocolate beers.","bluejacket74","May 10, 2014"

Smell was so chocolatey that it surprised even the wife (who considers herself a chocolate connosueir) she liked it more than me. It had a light taste and was heavily carbonated...

Close to a finger's worth of beige head that settles down quickly to just around the tops and sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is very pleasant with cocoa powder, vanilla with some spices. The taste is actually about the same. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. Goes down pretty easy. Overall, it is different but not really bad as I am not a big fan of Bud products overall except for a select few.","BeerWithMike","Jan 31, 2014"

3.59,5.9,4,3.75,3.5,3.5,3.5,"This has to be one of the darkest colored beers that AB has ever produced it's a Chocolate Wheat aged on cocoa and vanilla beans with spices. Large tan head fine bubbles fades slowly, pretty impressive look to it. Aroma has subtle cocoa creamy vanilla notes nothing in the way of noticeable spice additions on the nose. Flavor has a milk chocolate creamy character hints of dark roasts bring a bit of balance, the vanilla seems to be there throughout each sip and doesn't really fade away. Super sweet for me a bit more dark roasts might round it out, it feels like a hybrid wheat/milk stout with all of the lactose induced sweetness. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth textured medium bodied ample even carbonation, overall I can't really complain and I haven't attempted mixing this with the standard Shock Top as the label of the six pack holder depicts making black and tans with the two.","WVbeergeek","Jan 23, 2014"
