"I had the chance to meet the brewer when I was there. Seems to be a ""good guy"" with great ideas."
" O - I love this style of beer and this is worth a try. Nothing that knocks your socks off, but a decent brew."

"I'd look forward to tasting some other brews from this brewery to get a better sense of what they're about."

"Overall I found this to be a confusing beer and is not one I would want to pick up again. Some of my friends had tried this beer before and mentioned that it had a slight sourness, so I am not sold on infection being the reason for the odd taste. Overall a pretty poor beer."
"Overall I was not impressed with this beer. It did not meet any of my Octoberfest expectations."
"This beer poured dark brwon in color, with a slight coudiness. This could have been from the colder serving tempurature as it dissipated a bit after sitting. The color was also a little darker that many Oktoberfests. I noticed a mild hoppy and grainy aroma on the quarter-inch head. The beer presents as a wheat in the mouth and has a slight chocolate-malt flavor in the taste profile. Unique twist on an Oktoberfest."
"D - A nice flavor profile that is not a typical marzen but is much more delightful."
"D- A boring beer but it goes down nicely. Hopefully other offerings from this brewery are a bit more exciting."
