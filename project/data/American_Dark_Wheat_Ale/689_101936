Overall I have not had many in this category if at all -the wheat juxtapozed with hops and the dark grain character all come through and work in harmony for a nice hoppy wheat- the malt is not kilned to the point that it is roasted in flavor or clashes with the hops at all -not an assault of bitterness either. A well blended dark wheat ale -kudos Two Brothers!","Slatetank","Aug 06, 2014"

Aroma of bitter piney hops, biscuity malts, light toffee, grains. Flavor is somewhere between a malty IPA and a hoppy brown ale. I’ll go with the latter. Bready malts and some bitter pine, grainy flavors, a bit of toffee. Don’t get much from the wheat. Medium bodied at most with medium carbonation. Decent beer but unexciting.","BMMillsy","Jul 20, 2014"

The nose comprises cocoa powder, pine resin, light candied orange peel, and a hint of treacle. The taste brings in more of the same, the hops breaking through the roast and treacle fog every now and again with a sharp citrus-y edge. Things don't quite mesh completely, but there isn't much full clashing going on, either. It's a strange place to be. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a nice enough little beer, though not something I see myself partaking in very much in the future.","TMoney2591","Jun 05, 2014"

4,5.5,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer, but I can't say it was the best example a Dark Wheat Ale simply because the malt base wasn't too noticeable and the Citra hops seemed to dominate the taste and aroma, but style aside I still thought this was a pretty enjoyable beer regardless of what style it's classified as. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, a little refreshing, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention and I would drink another one if I had it and I wouldn't mind being able to drink a few of these, I think it would make for a nice spring time beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the hop profile, there's no doubt that Citra was used in this beer, it's right up front in both the taste and aroma and it was just as fruity and juicy as I want Citra to be. What like the least about this beer was that the malt base didn't come through more, I would love to see more Dark wheat flavors and aromas to provide some balance to the citrus hops. I would buy this beer if I ever saw it and I would recommend it to anyone who likes beers brewed with Citra hops. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it wasn't completely perfect, but I still found it to be pretty enjoyable and I'm glad Another6pack gave me a chance to try it. This beer made for a good first impression for Two Brothers and I will for sure be on the look out for more of their beers. Good job guys, this was a very nice beer, keep up the good work.","StoutHunter","Mar 06, 2014"

Not sure how old this is, but nothing really says Citra but the label. Easy to drink one or several the body is light and a touch watery, though it has some texture to it. Overall this is pretty good. They need some better graphics/identity though, the swirl thing just gets lost on the shelf.","emerge077","Beers"

The aroma is full of resin-like hops, with a little toasted bread and amber-malt scents. Appealing smell. There is some distant wheat twang, but that comes out more in the taste than the smell. The flavor is sweet, malty, and notably wheat-derived. There is a little astringency and woody flavors. Slightly smoky. The beer is smooth and quite nice.","Suds","Jan 12, 2014"

3.79,0,4,3.75,3.75,4,3.75,"The Crack! unleashed another brimful craft CAN and the music was blasting, so I employed an inverted Glug to let the Cat out of the CAN since I am loathe to let the cat out of the bag. Let out, the Cat circled around in the glass before sitting down and wrapping its tail around itself in defense against the cold. Two fingers of light-tan head sat atop, slowly falling away, leaving sticky lacing in its wake. The Cat began licking itself to get rid of the mess and I watched on, bemused. When I leaned in for a sniff, the Cat took a swipe at me with its claws, but it was definitely Citra that the Cat had brought to the party! I love a tropical Cat and here we had mango, tangerine and papaya. Color was a deep, cola-like amber (SRM = > 22, < 27) with NE-quality clarity, allowing me to see all of the snow swirling around outside. Mouthfeel was soft, caressing, probably due to the wheat, and even the hops seemed softer than they have when I have had them utilized in AIPAs. This was a friendly Cat, tropical and dark, but low-key, out for a prowl at Night and finding itself stuck with me in the middle of the day. Finish was fruity, but not cloying or overpowering, call it semi-sweet and definitely worth yet another go-'round.","woodychandler","Jan 01, 2014"
