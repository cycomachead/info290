"Overall, simply a delicious beer to me, and I'm a huge fan of the style."

"This was a nice surprise from Paris of a beer I otherwise would never have the opportunity to try. Thanks buddy."

"A so-so version of the style, that drinks easy, but just doesn't say drink more. Has some real stong brown ale tendencies more than dark wheat ale... Better than most from these guys"
"Brown like a glass of tea except with a small tan head that clears out quickly and leaves no trace. Smells of very sweet malts and some ripe bananas. A little raw earthiness is embedded. Thin and a bit grainy on the tongue with a slight residual spice and a fruity undercurrent. I guess that pretty much sums it up."
"D - Didn't taste anything like a wheat brew. Again, this brew tastes more like an Irish red ale."
"Pours a deeper amber color, thin off-white head. Sweeter caramel notes in the aroma, with a fruity yeastiness. It doesn't smell or taste much like any wheat beer I've had, and I wish I could say that in a more positive way. It falls on the sweeter side up front (caramel), and a certain, almost harsh, bitterness in the finish. Not really bad, but not really for me."
