3.36,3.1,3.75,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Poured a bottle obtained from a Pick 6 craft beer wall into a weizen glass. A nice looking brew, dark reddish bronze with around two inches of light khaki colored foam. Smells like classic grainy wheat spice, cereals with hints of caramel, grassy hop and fruity ale yeast esters. Unless the particular example is well-hopped I find it hard to detect much aroma in this style. On the palate, I get a strong wheat flavor coupled with nuts and delicate brown sugar, along with more vague fruitiness. A tad syrupy yet somehow watery as well, difficult to describe this seeming paradox ... Likely a diacetyl by-product, almost a buttered bread effect going on here. Aggressive carbonation that lifts up the wheat husk and spice. Someone below compared this favorably to Grasshopper and I echo that sentiment. A decent showcase for rather unadulterated lightly toasted wheat flavor.","CalgaryFMC","Oct 29, 2013"

3.13,-4,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"D: An amalgam of styles. A mix of English & US pale and a US dark Kristal wheat. US pub pale grain bill with both US and English hops. US overall, but with noticeable diacetyl & noticeable wheat base. A bit different without expecting it. Tasty & drinkable though.","SickGnar","Aug 18, 2012"

3.5,7.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Overall - A great dark wheat ale by Wild Rose. Almost sits on the border of being a wheat ale/red-amber ale hybrid. Great flavours for those who enjoy caramel and bready flavours.","leaddog","Jun 09, 2012"

2.48,-23.9,3.5,3,2,2.5,2.5,"D - I fail to see a difference between this and any other boring dark lager out there, and I don't see much of a point in having a style dedicated to this type of beer if they all taste this boring. Call a spade a spade, this is a dark lager, and not a good one at that.","Converge","Jan 15, 2012"

3.36,3.1,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"an OK beer but nowhere near some of Wild Rose's better offerings, not sure how I've never tried this one before","wordemupg","May 17, 2011"
3,-8,3,3,3,3,3,"O- This review was more difficult than I anticipated it would be....this beer doesn't stand out and unfortunately, I think it's Wild Roses' weak point so far. I would still drink it again, but wouldn't go out of my way to buy it. I prefer Rickards Red to this as far as a red goes. Not offensive, just not my favorite is all and I think it could be improved on!","ChrisCage","Dec 10, 2010"
3.41,4.6,4,3,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Another thumbs up for Wild Rose. This is much better than Grasshopper, which is its logical competitor as the only other Albertan pale wheat ale I can think of. I'm not sure it's really all that pale though. There's nothing stunning here, but it's still a refreshing, somewhat novel example of the style.","thehyperduck","Sep 24, 2010"
3.45,5.8,3,3,3.5,3.5,4,"Drinkability - good and refreshing, one of the better offerings from these guys.","DoctorStrangiato","Jul 31, 2010"
3.52,8,3,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"D - A tasty and unique offering. Again, not a favourite of mine from Wild Rose, but I would never turn one down. It's easily drinkable, but the overwhelming wheat flavours are a bit of a turnoff. Would like to try this one on tap to see if the flavours come through differently.","andrenaline","Beers"

3.3,1.2,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,3.5,"Poured a clear reddish brown with a two finger frothy cream coloured head. The head diminished to a ring but the thin lacing persisted. Mild bread yeast smells. Slight esters. Taste was bready malts with a slightly metallic hop finish. Mouthfeel was light in body, lightly carbonated. Drinkability was pretty good. A worthy beer. I hope to try it on tap soon. A rather unusual malty wheat. A couple of bottles in the six were not properly carbonated. Probably a sealing problem.","scott451","Apr 26, 2010"
3.53,8.3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"A pleasant enough, bolstered wheat ale, I could see having a few of these on the patio, once this bloody Alberta weather smartens up. Not a lot of examples of this blending of styles out there on the market, so best you try it from these guys.","biboergosum","Sep 17, 2009"
3.77,15.6,3.5,4,3.5,4,4,"A medium bodied ale with good mouth feel. Not overly sweet as some red and amber ales tend to be. It has some minor floral flavors and hints of brown sugar and vanilla. Hops are well balanced and evident in the finish. This is the kind of beer i could drink every day. Really nice during the summer with some ribs or steak on the grill.","BiologySean","Jul 21, 2009"
3.96,21.5,4,3,4.5,3,4.5,"with fish and chips or some nice salty appetizers. Easily beats anything in its class as far as Canadian red ales available in Alberta are concerned. Good Job WR, Good Job.","sammytag","May 28, 2009"
3.82,17.2,3,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured with a spare, off-white head that quickly diminished to almost nothing. Body was amber-colored and slightly hazy. Aroma was of light wheat, some slight malt in there as well. Medium-bodied on the palate, thin-textured yet slightly oily. Average carbonation and a slightly bitter finish. Tasted lightly sweet and wheaty in the beginning, but finished with a very low bitter taste. Interesting. Overall I liked what they've tried to do here, and I feel they've succeeded more than they've failed. I'd definitely have it again.","berley31","May 19, 2009"

3,-8,3,3,3,3,3,"Bottle: Poured a clear light brown color ale with a medium foamy head with average retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of wheat with some dry caramel malt is somewhat interesting. Taste is also a nice mix between some wheat malt with light cloves ester and some dry caramel malt. Very refreshing with good carbonation and average body.","Phyl21ca","Aug 12, 2008"
2.43,-25.5,3,2.5,2.5,2.5,2,"Wild Rose has shown us that they're capable of so much more -- their Imperial IPA was nothing short of fantastic -- so why are their regularly bottled offerings so bland? It's almost as though Alberta's brewers all have the idea that Albertans are rough-hewn sons of the soil that view any kind of flamboyance in a beer as suspect. That may be true, in the main, but there's a growing number of drinkers looking for something a little wilder.","stagger","Jul 13, 2007"
3.83,17.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Served with a small creamy white head, the body is a deep nutty transluscent amber in appearance. Sweet yet tart aroma, caramel malt with a bit of husky wheat grain. Robust nutty and toffee malts up front in the flavour. Some sharp wheat in the middle, along with mild coffee notes on the finish, accompanied by dandelion-like hops. Medium-bodied mouthfeel. This is a surprisingly savoury and malty wheat ale, nothing like I was expecting, but in the end it makes for a great sessional.","IronDjinn","Jul 02, 2007"
3.5,7.4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Note to Self: Ranked #11 American Dark Wheat Ale when I tried it (but it is a really short list)","BigBry","Mar 29, 2007"
3.1,-4.9,3.5,3.5,3,2.5,3,"This isn't a hefe in the true sense of the word, that's for sure. Putting style aside, however, cutting the carbonation would measurably improve things and bump up its drinkability. As it is, it's subtly-flavoured brew that I haven't minded taking home.","vanrassel","Beers"
2.98,-8.6,3.5,3,3,2.5,3,"On-tap at the brewery, revived after several years. Reddish with a small crown. More a wheat and little characterstic of a hefe as wattery and malty,caramel but not overally sweet. not shaken up creaminess. More of an all-malt lager slash cream ale. Above average carbonation.","Sammy","0"
