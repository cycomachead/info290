"Overall I wasn't sure what to expect, as this is among a small handful of styles I've never tried. Interesting beer that I'm glad I forgot about, actually, as it makes a great transition towards trying-to-be-spring in the Upper Midwest. I hope they bring this one back next year."
"Poured this into a weizen glass and boy does it look good. Solid black brown the color of dark chocolate or French toast coffee beans, with a creamy cap of cocoa colored foam. This is a showcase for malt all the way. Aroma has caramel and chocolate notes, along with a light chocolate covered banana note. It's sweet without being cloying. Pleasing chocolate malts and a touch of banana."

"Overall - unique beer. I, like most reviewers, did not know what to expect from a dark wheat. This was above and beyond a pleasant surprise."
"Bottle at Port street, love the roast flavour, first of the style won't be the last"
"Wait, a Winter seasonal from Anchor that isn't their annual Christmas beer?  Hmmm...  Anyway, this stuff pours a dark black-brown topped by nearly two fingers of tan foam.  The nose comprises mild roasted malts, toasted wheat, light vinyl, and a vague melange of spices pervading the background.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with a hint of toasted marshmallow and an increasingly strong vein of anise.  The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this wasn't too bad a beer, but that anise character ends up tanking things a bit for me, to the point that I'll likely never look for this stuff again.  Shame, 'cause without that bit of unpleasantness this beer likely would have been pretty good."
"Dark and roasty--not the wheat beer you're expecting! A great and unique addition to the Anchor line--not as remarkably good as their porter, but more so than Steam, which is already pretty darn good. See jeffreysan's review for absolutely spot-on details. I will now be watching out for that flavor of Band-Aids in every wheat I try."

"Flavor is equally sweet, chocolatey throughout, with underpinnings of dark cherries leading to a roasty, toasty, dry and lightly bitter coffee finish. Very complex malt profile. It's a touch too burnt, for my liking. The fruity character becomes cough syrupy as it warms."
""
""
"it's anchor. it is an impeccably made beer. it's 7% abv but drinks like a black lager. it's not knocking my sox off, but i like it."
""
"O: Very interesting wheat beer with pronounced roasted flavors but still easy to drink. Alcohol is well hidden and this is an enjoyable brew - I would get this again."
""
""
"Wheaty, lightly roasty, and smooth."
"This beer is hurt pretty badly in my opinion by the very strong smell, which is almost overpowering to me."

"Overall: My first Dark Wheat Ale. Pretty good!"
""
""
"O: Interesting. Pretty good but not I'm not loving the finish or aftertaste. Great wheat flavor with a nice sweet fruitiness and an awesome mouthfeel. I probably wouldn't drink again though."
"Overall:  This is another excellent beer by Anchor, but one that is completely surprising, as it looks, smells and tastes more like an oatmeal stout than wheat beer.  I loved it and Iâ€™ll certainly get it again!"
"Cheers"
"Nice deep color with a small light tan head and pretty decent lacing. A different type of wheat, dark, malty..It is ok, but I think I will stick with the traditional wheats with more fruit and lightness"

"Pours a deep brown producing 3+ fingers of tan, lasting head that leaves a thin coating of spidery lace. Aroma is toasted wheat malt, roasted nuts, cocoa, cream, biscuit, molasses, fig & other dark fruits, hay/dry grass, a faint hint of cherry, vanilla & earthy floral hops. Taste is a more robust version of the nose with nuts &  wheat, hay/dry grass, molasses, cherry & dark fruits being more prominent. More roast & some burnt tones, maybe a little smoke comes through. Finishes dry & earthy, with heavy roast & bittersweet chocolate rolling over to dominate the dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate-high carbonation, creamy, silky, and pretty smooth & dry especially in the latter half of the sip. Unique & very nice."
"Really good, so far too best beer I've tried from anchor."

"Overall: A very pleasant rich dark wheat beer disguised as a porter. Refreshing and warming at the same time, if not terribly complex. It's a very well-rounded beer with no weak spots."

"Don't understand the lower ratings, I like the toffee, roasted, sweet chocolate notes without a bitter bill"

"rarely do i get to have any new beer from anchor, so when i see one, i usually buy it. this is a different take on the winter wheat, not spiced or overly sweet with things like honey and molasses. its got a nice ruby dark color, brownish red, with a tall tan head, very creamy looking and comprised of a billion tiny micro bubbles. the nose has a cool fruitiness to it, but it seems thin and one dimensional. dried cherry or cranberry is what i mostly smell, and a little sweet caramel malt. the flavor is better than the smell, with a pretty nuanced and layered grain complexion. the dark wheat is soft in feel but boldly flavored, and carries that dried fruit thing well. there is a little cereal element, a moderate toast component, and even a kiss of chocolate type malt in here to make it a little more wintery. i like that it doesnt feel spiced, maybe a hint of some mulling spices, but its all in my head, not on my tongue, which is where i am liking it these days. not sure how many of them i would want to drink, and i found the body a little thin for the season, but its a cool brew, definitely worth trying at least a glass of because its pretty different from others on the market."

"Very dark beer almost looks like a stout with a nice khaki head the beer looks verry nice the aroma is of chocolate,molasses,vanilla,black licorice and the taste is about the same but it taste overly sweet like a glass full of chocolate chips i could not finish the beer had to give to a friend overall i was not impressed worst beer i have had from anchor"
"Black in color and impenetrable to light.  This is a wheat beer?  A quarter inch of beige head is visible and leaves Brussels lacing.  I smell dark wheat and some toffee notes.  I taste toffee and dark wheat.  The body is moderately carbonated and creamy."
"Pours a black color.  1/4 inch head of an off-tan color.  Good retention and decent lacing.  Smells of alcohol, sweet malt, dark citrus, hint of tea, hint of yeast, and wheat.  Fits the style of an American Dark Wheat Ale.  Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level.  There is also a noticeable dryness.  Tastes of alcohol, sweet malt, wheat, hint of tea, hint of yeast, hint of hop, and a hint of roasted malt.  Overall, dominated by the roast, wheat, and dryness."

"Roasty and smooth, but lighter bodied than most winter seasonals. Very enjoyable."
""
"Overall: a nicely drinkable beer that provides some refreshment along with the flavors."
""
"12/13....pours very dark black, fizzy, tan foam stays on top. Dark fruit, burnt wood, oak, chocolate, coffee, blueberry nose. Taste opens fruity, becomes a charred malt, but softens and slips to a lighter wheaty close. Quite a varied flavor profile. Very good."

"I don't have a lot to say about this beer. It doesn't really need to be dissected or explained in detail - it's not that complicated. It follows along the Anchor 'guidelines' as being very clean, and neatly structured. It's fruity, a touch chocolatey, subtly roasty, and wheaty. It reminds me of cold, sweet black coffee with some fruit juice added in... cherry? strawberry?... perhaps just a little... fig? yes. It's well balanced between each of it's components (let's not forget the moderate bitterness), and it's superbly polished. I don't think anyone will be wowed by this, but like all of the Anchor beers it's a solid hitter that you can put anywhere in the line-up and you'll still come home a winner."

"Overall / Drinkability:  Well, this is the first time I've had an American Dark Wheat Ale - and from what I see of the BA description of this style, this beer doesn't quite fit.  It does however, come across as a stout and if I look at it that way - a stout with a wheat base, it's pretty good.  I'm glad I got a six pack so I can explore this one a bit more.  I don't think I would want more than one a night, but it's still a good beer."

"What a compliment to Anchor's Our Special Ale. Whichever winter ale you choose from Anchor, it is sure to make your holiday merrier."
""
"The alcohol was here but I could hardly detect it and it emerged as a nice waring sensation as I worked my way through this.The rings of lacing on the back of my pint glass was the icing on the cake as this beer felt wonderful from start to finish. As far as seasonal beers go, this one deserves to be put in anyone's rotation, especially as an alternate to the stronger and spicier offerings on the shelf this time of the year. A well-balanced beer that went down easily and is good enough to be enjoyed long after the presents are opened and the lights are taken down."
"O -- To me, this is Anchor's Robust Porter to their year-round Porter as a Brown Porter.  There's more roasted character in this beer than in the standard Porter, more dark fruit character than chocolate I get from the Standard.  A very nice beer for winter that hides its strength very well."

"O; not your usual ""winter"" (read ""holiday spicing) ale nor a typical wheat beer (pale), but a unique dark brew that should be great year around."

"O - Absolutely delicious. Complex, yet incredibly drinkable. A unique winter warmer offering from a great brewery."
""
"Was looking forward to trying this one, a dark wheat sounds delicious.  This did not fail.  Great malty flavor right in your face, you get the wheat but the malt runs over it a bit.  Seems like a little of the dark fruit, like a dark belgian and even a little roast and chocolate.  Excellent creamy feel made this really enjoyable.  The only thing that kept it down was a little something funky at the very end that lingered, but I could not put my finger on it."

"Overall: A pretty solid twist on a Dunkelweizen style beer. Good mix of wheat notes with the toasted malt."
""

"12 oz single from Trader Joe in Salem OR. $1.34 Wow this is not what i expected!.. Dark brown body with a lovely creamy and bubbly tan head. Aroma of semi dark chocolate, milky coffee slight floral hop..nice. Taste is incredibly creamy smooth and chocolate winning the day Very nice mouth feel..excellent in fact. Great winter beer//like a dark wheat bock!"

"O-Solid offering.   Nothing I would seek out but a quality beer.   Would love to see this modified into more of a german style dunkelwiese with the traditional phenols, etc"

"Tastes quite good, pronouncedly different from dunkels but still immediately recognizable as a strong dark wheat.  Starts off toasty with very light nodes of chocolate and white pepper.  This moves into a dryer, more chocolatey middle and ends on a nice combo of wheatmalt and American yeast."

"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a surprisingly dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque in the glass with a  fine one finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of light caramel malt and a hint of chocolate. Flavor is toasted malt, wheat, chocolate and a hint of toffee. Medium bodied. Quite a surprise and not what I expected from this beer or style. The profile is almost more like a light porter than a dunkle weizen, which is apparently the origin of this American style. Not quite to style, but nicely balanced and flavorful. An interesing flavor departure for Anchor and one that I applaud. I liked this quite a bit."

"Anchor's Winter Wheat brew reveals the dark side of wheat a nice change from the light summer time wheat beers we're used to. Chocolate and toffee flavors with a mildly alcoholic aftertaste. Great beer overall."
