"A great beer... but this is one BA that does not improve on upon the original."
"O - This is a lot better than the original beer. This is quite tasty. I though a bourbon barrel aged wheat beer was crazy. It was crazy enough to be delicious."
"The bourbon overpowers this one quite a bit. I really cant detect much flavor at all from the Paw Paw. Almost all bourbon. Fine by me, but objectively not very balanced. Maybe it needs to spend less time in the barrel."
