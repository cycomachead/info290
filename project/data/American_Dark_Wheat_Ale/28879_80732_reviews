"Pours to a deep reddish-brown.  Head is off-white and dissipates quickly, leaving light lacing.  The aroma is a little corny, but otherwise decent.  Mild flavors.  The dark grain flavors really overpower any wheat taste you might get.  Usually wheat has a sweet, spicy flavor, but this drinks more like Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter than a wheat ale.  The carbonation is almost perfect, while the flavors hit the palette rather mildly.  This is better than I was expecting.  The price wasn't too bad either, build your own 6-pack for $7.99"
"Good beer."

"Interesting hybrid style wheat beer with a dull chocolate malt taste. Slightly roasted note with a porter-esque mouthfeel. Interesting, falls off a little near the end but solid. Has a slight anise feel on the back end as this warms."

"An interesting, easy-drinking, well-balanced, dark wheat ale.  Not ""baaad"" at all!"

"Interesting dichotomy between the roasted black notes and the light body of the wheat. No head. . . smooth, mild chewiness. good entry for those looking to try their first black beer."

"O - Very easy to drink with or without food. Not as heavy as most darker beers. Could drink several of these which is generally not the case with darker beers due to their heaviness. This is a dark ale that my wife actually enjoys, and she does not like darker beers."

"O: I would definitely bring a 6-pack of this to a party. I believe beer connoisseurs will appreciate this beer along with your MGD / Miller / Coors friends. Decent craft beer that I believe would appeal to many tastes."

"This pours a dark brown/black color with a slight, off-white head. The aroma is slightly robust with burnt starches and molasses. The taste is fairly heavy and complex. There is a lot of roasted flavor mixed with some coffee a slightly bitter hop finish. Pretty decent brew for being a newer brewery."

"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-high intensity, resulting in a slightly fizzy, then foamy (3/4) and smooth (1/4) mouthfeel. A bit less carbonation would probably benefit the beer. Closes dry, with low to moderate stickiness clinging to the palate."
"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, wheat, cocoa, and slight char aromas. Taste is much the same with char and cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a slightly better taste in my opinion."

"O- A good beer. Not a fan of wheat's but the roast quality add a dimension I like. I'm glad I got to try this."

"It took me three of their beers before 3 Sheeps gave me some sort of ovine pun? Disappointed... Anyway, this stuff pours a deep midnight sienna topped by a finger of relatively short-lived khaki foam. The nose comprises coffee, light treacle, and a hint of graham cracker way in the back. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a clear vein of cola. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, crisp finish. Seriously,. everything falls off of an apparently tall and steep tabletop at the end, making me wonder whether or not I've even had anything in my mouth. Overall, this is an interesting beer that I can't pin down in my head. There isn't much wheat influence as I can tell, there's plenty of roast, and nothing stays long enough for me to get acquainted. I guess I could say I wouldn't mind having another, but I'm not likely to ever seek it out again."

"O- This has some nice unique chocolate wheat character but the green bananas and young wood are a bit odd, and start to dominate."

"Baaaad Boy pours a black color with a very small head. There is a roasted aroma with hints of black licorice. The taste is slightly roasted, with hints of black licorice. Good flavors, and fully body flavors. Overall its a nice beer, however its a bit boring."
"O-This is a pretty unique beer with way more flavors going on than I would have expected. The charred flavors are a bit too a acrid and the feel was a bit of a letdown, but this brew was a nice departure from the standard IPA or my recent hefe obsession."

"Drinkability: This is good stuff and I bet it is superb on tap. I think I have a reason to visit Sheboygan now."
""
"It's quite good, though."
"O - It is a dark sessionable ale that has similar, but lacks, qualities of Sprecher's Black Bavarian."

"O) Not bad, but of the 3 sheeps offerings I've tried, this is my least favorite. I definitely would not go out of my way for it, but that's just like my opinion man... Far out..."
" In the mout iit's all iced coffee, sweetened as if with sugar from the table. Refreshing on the tongue, medium to light body, with the perfect sharp carbonation."

"D - Nicely balanced and easy drinking."

"Pretty good stuff that'd be a lot better if not so cold. Served with a smallish, tan, foamy, thick, creamy head that slowly settled and lots of sheeting lace. Color is an opaque brown black. Aroma is malt and roast. Flavor's like nose, with good balance between bitter, sweet, and tang. Body and carbonation are good. Finish is like flavor, slightly long, and very drinkable. Again there'd be a lot more interesting things here if it weren't so cold. Still, good stuff."

"O - Baaad Boy's bold aroma suggests, a little more delicately and balanced, the amount of roast malt used in it's process but the flavor doesn't incorporate the same level of balance. Remaining medium-bodied and lower in alcohol content, Baaad Boy offers a dark-tasting beer without the filling feeling a heavier stout might produce. A fine start at a dark beer for 3 Sheeps!"

"Paired with cured smoked pork shoulder, wild boar sausage, and prosciutto charcuterie. The sweetness of the beer became more apparent when up against the salty cured meats."
