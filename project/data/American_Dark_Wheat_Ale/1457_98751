4.1,9,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into snifter; no bottle dating, but is a recent release. Pours pitch black color with a 2 finger fairly dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, wheat, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, light banana, and herbal spice earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast malts and spice notes; with good strength. Taste of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, wheat, dark bread, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, light banana, and herbal spice earthiness. Fair amount of earthy spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, dark bread, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, light banana, and spice earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and spice flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and moderately creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent spiced dark wheat ale. All around great balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Sep 30, 2014"

It perfectly blends German Weizenbock and American Stout with just a pinch of Belgian Dark Ale to create a supernatural symphony of spicy and rich flavours; it's not of this world. The $2.39 was well worth the price of admission to this concerto.","biegaman","Oct 21, 2013"

4.35,15.7,4,4.5,4.5,3.75,4.25,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its aroma, and its taste, which was not too far behind. This beer is a bit tough to summarize, but it seems to be a nice blend between a roasty, charcoal stout and a warming, spicy pumpkin beer, making it perfect for the change of seasons. The aroma is wheaty, endlessly dark, and sticky, helped along by sweet esters, dank fruits, and a cookâ€™s cabinet of spice. These all translate seamlessly into the flavoring, where the heaviness hits up front, blending and softening to a sweeter, easier beer at the end of the sip. The aftertaste shows a revival of the bitterness, for a pleasant, balanced breath. The feel is thick and suits the beer well. This guy definitely took us off our feet, surprising us at every turn. Although it is still a touch warm out now, we simply cannot wait until the breeze cools, and we can wrap ourselves in blankets, head out to the porch with the rest of the six pack, and watch the trees change colors at dusk.","TheBrewo","0"
