3.85,0.5,3.25,3.75,4,3.5,4,"A very nice malt forward beer. Easy drinking, with lots of flavor. Certainly leaves me looking forward to trying more beers from this brewer.","vkv822","Beers"
4.3,12.3,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Clear medium brown body, good visible carbonation, under off-white head. Big malt attack in the nose, bready, biscuity, slight hint of roast balanced by floral hops. Taste mirrors the nose, very little bitterness. Mouthfeel on the light side of medium, good effervescence. Smooth, easy drinking personified, my buddy, who is not a beer head, had no problem consuming this. It's a shame this beer doesn't make it out of Baker City that often, as evidenced by multiple medals, this is a really, really good beer. Can't wait for the canning line (!) at new facility to be up and running this summer, IMO one of the world's great camping beers. Very highly recommended.","jdense","0"
