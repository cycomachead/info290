"Verdict: One of the better beers in the wheat/amber ale category I've tried to date. It's soft, smooth, rustic, and more importantly it's very easy to drink. This really hit the spot on a cool fall day."

"This is a beer outside the boxes, an awesome standby that's always available from this brewery. One of the reasons I'm a true GB fanboy. Wonderful next to a bowl of red chili."

"O- This beer is interesting. It has a nice smoke flavor but it starts to take over all the other flavors and gets a bit tough to finish the whole glass."

"O: I was hoping for something a little more ""left field", but this was more middle of the road. Not bad in the least, just too safe."

"O- This beer was a interesting cross between a amber ale and a wheat that came off very well. It seems at times people try to oversimplfy this style and they have shown that you can go in the opposite direction and still have a great outcome. The ABV is low enough and the body is strong. What more could you really want in a hybrid wheat?"
"Had a glass at the Kalamazoo Beer Exchange. Man, this beer is out there - a hybrid wheat-amber-pale ale. And I'd say it's well made beer at that. It had a strong balance of spicy, Euro-like hops with smooth bready, toasty barley and wheat with a share of caramel. Despite weighing in at 6.1%, but this beer is very drinkable and quite interesting."
