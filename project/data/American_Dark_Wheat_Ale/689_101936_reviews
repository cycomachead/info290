"Clean, drinkable, and refreshing. My biggest complaint was the lack of wheat... I just wasn't able to pick it up. Regardless, tasty beer."

"These guys always impress me.. Pots a dark amber color from can into a Weiss glass.. 2in head..nice lacing..great roasted malt flavour yeasty and a nice hop finish ..awesome beer I live these guys"

"A pleasant beer, would have this again. Good for those who are acquiring a taste for the hoppier side of the beer universe."
"Overall: Unique take on the style. Decent hybrid, but I would have liked a little more pronounced wheat characteristics. Good enough to drink again, but I'm not sure I would seek it out."
""
""
"Overall:  Comes in a 12oz can and I like to support dark wheat beers, so I gave this a try.  It's pretty forgettable, mostly tastes like a pale ale with a little more roasted flavor to it.  Not particularly wheaty."

"Overall: A pretty unique and solid twist on a wheat beer. Good juicy hops with a solid toasty malt backing."

"More alley than Aristocat.   A marketable beer but so are thousands of others."
""
"O - Good offering.  Really very simple in it's tasting profile but a nice execution of brewing.  Not what I expected but would order again.  3.75/5"
"Certainly has a unique flavor profile and goes down easy. Not too shabby."

"reminds me of a hoppy red ale very tasty very hoppy"

"O - best beer that two brothers brew, should be released year round. this is a great take on a seasonal with all the stouts and winter warmers being released this time of year."

"really hoppy on the nose, but sips really easy. the taste is very much like lipton ice tea."

"One of the few wheat beers worth drinking"

"The taste is great with very tasty citrus in the hops and nice balance of light toast and clean yeast with slight hint of pine and mild peppery taste with the oily hops more on the earthy side which matches the slight sweetness with a spice taste following as it finishes. Overall I have not had many in this category if at all -the wheat juxtapozed with hops and the dark grain character all come through and work in harmony for a nice hoppy wheat- the malt is not kilned to the point that it is roasted in flavor or clashes with the hops at all -not an assault of bitterness either. A well blended dark wheat ale -kudos Two Brothers!"

"Can from World of Beer Tioga. Pours reddish brown with a good bit of light showing through and a small off white head. Aroma of bitter piney hops, biscuity malts, light toffee, grains. Flavor is somewhere between a malty IPA and a hoppy brown ale. I’ll go with the latter. Bready malts and some bitter pine, grainy flavors, a bit of toffee. Don’t get much from the wheat. Medium bodied at most with medium carbonation. Decent beer but unexciting."
""
"Overall: I always pick up Two Brothers stuff because they try a lot of interesting things but the execution here leaves a bit to be desired. The flavors just aren't that strong or distinguished. Cool idea for a dark wheat beer but other than nothing particularly notable here."
""

"Overall it is an interesting brewing adventure worth trying."
""
""

"O-It was a decent beer but it just wasn't well rounded enough to be very good."

"Shuffling over to Two Brothers for another black IPA (of sorts, anyway). This one pours a clear dark sienna topped by a finger of wan khaki foam. The nose comprises cocoa powder, pine resin, light candied orange peel, and a hint of treacle. The taste brings in more of the same, the hops breaking through the roast and treacle fog every now and again with a sharp citrus-y edge. Things don't quite mesh completely, but there isn't much full clashing going on, either. It's a strange place to be. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a mostly smooth feel. Overall, a nice enough little beer, though not something I see myself partaking in very much in the future."

"Overall: Very, very good. Thick mouthfeel, which I love, and a very citrusy, hoppy backbone offset with a luscious caramel sweetness. This is just a wonderful beer."

"O: Decent beer from Two Brothers, in a style that I'm not particularly familiar with, but that blends dark and hoppy beers together pretty well. I'm definitely interested in picking this one up again, and hoping to see this currently esoteric style expand a bit."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I am glad this held up from the Fall release it was a decent ale that I may have again. Try it!"
"This is maybe only the second beer from this style that I have consumed, and I know that this is a winner between those two. Very tasty beer, easy to drink, and would pair very well with harder cheeses like Parmesan and Gouda."

"Overall: a very pleasant and subtle beer. The only thing that is really lacking is the smell which I can understand due to the relaxed flavor profiles that make this beer good."
""
""
""
"This is a pretty unique beer. I like it. It's worth checking out if given the opportunity. Solid use of citra hops."
""
"Overall I thought this was a pretty good beer, but I can't say it was the best example a Dark Wheat Ale simply because the malt base wasn't too noticeable and the Citra hops seemed to dominate the taste and aroma, but style aside I still thought this was a pretty enjoyable beer regardless of what style it's classified as. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, a little refreshing, not too filling and the taste did a nice job at holding my attention and I would drink another one if I had it and I wouldn't mind being able to drink a few of these, I think it would make for a nice spring time beer. What I liked the most about this beer was the hop profile, there's no doubt that Citra was used in this beer, it's right up front in both the taste and aroma and it was just as fruity and juicy as I want Citra to be. What like the least about this beer was that the malt base didn't come through more, I would love to see more Dark wheat flavors and aromas to provide some balance to the citrus hops. I would buy this beer if I ever saw it and I would recommend it to anyone who likes beers brewed with Citra hops. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, it wasn't completely perfect, but I still found it to be pretty enjoyable and I'm glad Another6pack gave me a chance to try it. This beer made for a good first impression for Two Brothers and I will for sure be on the look out for more of their beers. Good job guys, this was a very nice beer, keep up the good work."

"Poured from a 12 oz. can. Has a dark brown color with a 1 inch head. Smell is very hoppy, surprising for the style. Taste is hops, citrus, mild wheat, some bitterness, easy drinking and refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and although a bit lacking in the wheat department, overall is a solid beer."

"O: I found this beer to be quite enjoyable—you get lots of hop aromas of flavors as you would expect from an IPA or a hoppy pale ale, but there's no bitterness and it goes down extremely easily given the lighter body from the wheat base."
""
""
""
""
""
"Flavors follow suit, earthy piney hops lend a light bitterness, and a nice roasty malt character holds it all together. Not sure how old this is, but nothing really says Citra but the label. Easy to drink one or several the body is light and a touch watery, though it has some texture to it. Overall this is pretty good. They need some better graphics/identity though, the swirl thing just gets lost on the shelf."

"Beautiful, clear, chestnut and amber in color with a huge, long lasting head. The lace is thick and clingy. The aroma is full of resin-like hops, with a little toasted bread and amber-malt scents. Appealing smell. There is some distant wheat twang, but that comes out more in the taste than the smell. The flavor is sweet, malty, and notably wheat-derived. There is a little astringency and woody flavors. Slightly smoky. The beer is smooth and quite nice."

"Tasty dark n hoppy wheat ale. A style I'd love to see other brewers take a stab at. Notes here of more citric hops, some tropical fruityness and some dark wheaty malts. Moderate bite tot he hops in the finish and a nice smooth smooth finish with malts smoothing things out. Nicely done"
""
""
"O - An easy drinking brew that reads more like an IPA than a wheat. Solid if not exceptional. Probably would be a nice summer beer."

"overall just a very very solid beer. easy drinking, good."

"The Crack! unleashed another brimful craft CAN and the music was blasting, so I employed an inverted Glug to let the Cat out of the CAN since I am loathe to let the cat out of the bag. Let out, the Cat circled around in the glass before sitting down and wrapping its tail around itself in defense against the cold. Two fingers of light-tan head sat atop, slowly falling away, leaving sticky lacing in its wake. The Cat began licking itself to get rid of the mess and I watched on, bemused. When I leaned in for a sniff, the Cat took a swipe at me with its claws, but it was definitely Citra that the Cat had brought to the party! I love a tropical Cat and here we had mango, tangerine and papaya. Color was a deep, cola-like amber (SRM = > 22, < 27) with NE-quality clarity, allowing me to see all of the snow swirling around outside. Mouthfeel was soft, caressing, probably due to the wheat, and even the hops seemed softer than they have when I have had them utilized in AIPAs. This was a friendly Cat, tropical and dark, but low-key, out for a prowl at Night and finding itself stuck with me in the middle of the day. Finish was fruity, but not cloying or overpowering, call it semi-sweet and definitely worth yet another go-'round."

"Overall: Flavor is lacking, but I appreciate this hybrid hoppy-wheat beer."

"Beer is medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, resulting in a beer that is smoothly foamy (2/3) and slightly smooth (1/3). Closes dry, with light stickiness clinging to the palate and lips."
""
"I am not remorseful for buying a six pack though."

"All-in-all, a very enjoyable beer!"
""
""
"Appearance is deep gold, not quite as dark as the can would lead me to believe. Nose feature heavy grainy wheat notes. Ripe fleshy fruit comes through, notes of melon and citrus. Taste is mild in bitterness, big in hop flavor. Pine and melon are the dominate notes. Mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated. Overall, easy drinking brew."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Very enjoyable seasonal! I was really pleasantly surprised with this. Great, sessionable dark wheat ale that's big on hops. The only reason I didn't rate it higher was that the aroma and flavor is a little one-dimensional but if you like the dimension it's a great beer."
""
""

""
""
"O - definitely thinking outside the box here and by not limiting this beer to a particular style category it's like nothing I've ever had before. Glad I tried it but not so sure I'd get it again."

"On the thinner side. Overall a very good,easy drinker."

"Mouthfeel is good. A light amount of malty stickiness is followed by a moderate amount of carbonation that give is a light to medium body."
