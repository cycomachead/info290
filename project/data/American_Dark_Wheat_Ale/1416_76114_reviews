"This one was very smooth and great smell with a very unique taste."
"flat beer no real tastes"
""
"This one is very... um... let's say ""organic"" tasting. Moreso thsn any of their other brews."
""
"O: A very straight-forward and simples brew that is fairly decent. Extremely easy to drink (like most of Uinta's non-crooked line brews) and could be easily sessioned. Nice for a ""break"" beer every once in a while"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is sweet, some spices are apparent. Taste is of mild lemons, some spices, a bit of wheat, refreshing. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a good quality beer."
"o: I like this! It's complex enough to be interesting without being overbearing and pretentious. It's just a nice, smooth, beery-bready-flavoured beer. This is going on the ""classier-than-usual summer evening quaff"" list."
"Pretty straightforward pale ale taste with its biscuit malts, clean, hop balance and sweetness. Nothing that sets it above the fold. Drinkable for sure."

"Overall: It's an extremely good beer. This could be a drink-straight or drink-pair brew. Either way it could go. If pairing with food, I would recommend a wheat-bun burger to go with it, and have a mildly spicy sauce on it. Flavors really open up with that pairing."

"Overall- The flavor profile has some interesting aspects to it. I, however, do not approve of the brewer's misrepresentation of it. I would give it a try though if you want something low on taste on alcohol but isn't entirely boring."

"I saw no reason to hold back and went with an aggro pour, resulting in a dense, foamy finger of light-tan head with good retention. Color was a deep coppery-amber with NE-quality clarity. Nose had a strong malty sweetness, slightly bready, slightly biscuity. Mouthfeel was medium with a big, sweet presence on the tongue. Finish remained fairly sweet and I found myself thankful that I only traded for one of these. It is not that there was anything intrinsically wrong with it, nor was it out of spec for the style guidelines as promulgated by this site. Instead, I just prefer something hoppier and when I do not get it, I tend to move on. Caveat emptor!"

"This is a dark wheat? Really? I get no wheat tones off this. It strikes me as much more of an amber than anything else. And a mild one at that. Kind of a boring beer, I have to say. Nothing really going on flavor wise that holds my interest."

"Pours a mostly clear copper with a chill haze. Aroma of orange citrus and some spicy notes. In the taste mildly bitter citrus hops and a small earthy dry spice. Mild tangy sweetness but this beer is more than bitter enough to balance out. Medium bodied and very crisp with a small dry spice. Overall this is a nice wheat ale. Well crafted and enjoyable."
"A decent beer, the flavor profile was pleasant, but seemed a bit subdued."

"An average but sessionable ale. Could be better, not very wheaty and the tartness doesn't fit with the rest of the beer. Would probably pair with food okay. Glad I tried it but it's pedestrian."
"O: Not sure if age was a factor here, carbonation was as strong as ever which hints otherwise. Sweet, with an extract like twang, boring nose and flavor wise can't see this getting much better. pass."
"Pours a clear, medium brown/amber color with a perfect off-white head. Some slight scents of wheat and malts, but nothing overpowering in the smell. Taste is quite mellow and very light. You get some hints of raw wheat but that it is. The actual taste is fine, there just need to be more flavor behind it. Overall a weak beer that needs work, but I guess itâ€™s all about marketing it as a USDA organic in the end."

"My favorite thing about this beer is the label showing Hazel, who looks pretty similar to Sarah Palin. I chose this over other options specifically so I could give it to the in-laws as a laugh."
""
"O: Not very impressed. Pretty disappointed. Couldn't find a ""Best by..."" date but im guessing its an old bottle. Otherwise its just a very plain beer. Would consider trying one more time to put speculation to rest."

"Doesn't really intrigue or impress but it drinks easily and also doesn't have any major flaws."
""
"Overall it is a pretty refreshing beer. It just lacks some of the substance."
""
"O - Overall...ok, just doesn't really stand out in any way from other beers out there. Flavors are a bit dull and weak in intensity with a lifeless carbonation. Drinkable for sure, but nothing special about this one."

"Bottled on 12/16/11. Interesting that the label says it contains ""barley malt, hops, and yeast," but no mention of wheat malt."
"Pours a nice clean/clear dark golden brown color, nice carbonation, little fizzy off-white head, with some sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, slight yeast note. The taste is slightly sweet, malty, kinda yeasty. Medium Body, with a slightly dry finish. This is a nice little brew, nothing special though."
