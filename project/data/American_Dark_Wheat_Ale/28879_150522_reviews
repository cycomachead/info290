"Very good beer. Lots of chocolate and coffee. The wheat mixes well with the coffee flavors. This beer features more coffee bitterness than sweet chocolate, but both are there."

"A wonderfully made, rich dark wheat ale. Sweet and roasty with a hint of balancing tang. A great, strong, dark sipper!"

"O - A real winner from 3 Sheeps dubbed Uber Joe that brings Hello, My Name is Joe to another level. Excellent buy at $7.99 a bomber."

"Overall: I wish I got the Speedway Stout instead. Not great, not terrible.  That said, as I drink through this, it just gets worse.  I really expected more from this.  On paper, this combination should be delicious - Convenient Distraction by O'so is a great example of how coffee/vanilla/cocoa play very well together - but this is not anywhere close to being in that league."
