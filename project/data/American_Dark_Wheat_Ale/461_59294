Lots going on with the aroma and is of roasted malt, dark fruit, cocoa and wheat. Even more going on with the taste with even a hint of hazelnut and weak coffee as well. Lighter-medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Never had a 'dark' wheat' before and didn't know what to except. Very easy to drink with no bitter of harsh aftertaste. Really liked this one!","BeerWithMike","Jul 12, 2014"

It's delicious, however. I wouldn't turn it down. I wish the beautiful brown toasted head would stick around longer.","Bradthoc","Jun 27, 2013"

3.55,-2.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"a really vibrant beer, not brewed in the german tradition at all, as i originally expected. the pour is chocolatey brown, with a small tan head and probably a bit of sediment, but its hard to tell through the dark color. the nose is a good mix of wheat and dark roasted barley malt, sort of similar to a porter, but with the wheat in there to round this out and lighten it up a bit. the yeast isnt german either, but it doesnt ass many interesting characterisitics in smell or taste. a flavor of cocoa is in there for just a second in the finish, not sweet, but clever. a little heavy on the mouthfeel, approaching stout body, but the carbonation is lively and in combination with the wheat malt, makes a fun feeling beer. id be happy to drink a 6er of this anyday.","StonedTrippin","Dec 10, 2012"

3.68,1.1,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"I'm not particularly familiar with the style, but based on this, it seems like they tried to craft a Black Ale with wheat, or a light porter/stout with wheat. While I don't know if the so-called "American Dark Wheat" genre name is appropriate, I still generally enjoyed this beer.","falloutsnow","Beers"

3.42,-6,4.5,2.5,3.5,3.5,4,"O: It's similar to Guinness Draught, in appearance and mouthfeel. The taste is good for a wheat beer, malty upfront, than slightly grainy and stout like at the middle and end. It's a good dark beer, an awesome wheat beer, something I like to keep on hand.","KJay1408","Nov 10, 2010"

3.83,5.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, love having a good beer offering available in a can.

Tasty, drinkable, and its availability in a can is another plus.","BigRedN","Beers"
3.8,4.4,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,"D- I had fairly low expectations for this beer after reading on the side "Brewed with corn and wheat". I thought it was going to be more of a malt liquor, but I was pleasantly proven wrong. A quite nice beer with some unique aspects and good flavors.","zdk9","0"
