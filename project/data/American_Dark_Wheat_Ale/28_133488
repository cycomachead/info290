Interesting beer that I'm glad I forgot about, actually, as it makes a great transition towards trying-to-be-spring in the Upper Midwest. I hope they bring this one back next year.","Phocion","Mar 31, 2015"

Solid black brown the color of dark chocolate or French toast coffee beans, with a creamy cap of cocoa colored foam. This is a showcase for malt all the way. Aroma has caramel and chocolate notes, along with a light chocolate covered banana note. It's sweet without being cloying. Pleasing chocolate malts and a touch of banana.","elNopalero","Mar 30, 2015"

3.12,-17.5,3.75,3.5,2.75,3.5,3,"Wait, a Winter seasonal from Anchor that isn't their annual Christmas beer?  Hmmm...  Anyway, this stuff pours a dark black-brown topped by nearly two fingers of tan foam.  The nose comprises mild roasted malts, toasted wheat, light vinyl, and a vague melange of spices pervading the background.  The taste brings in more of the same, along with a hint of toasted marshmallow and an increasingly strong vein of anise.  The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel.  Overall, this wasn't too bad a beer, but that anise character ends up tanking things a bit for me, to the point that I'll likely never look for this stuff again.  Shame, 'cause without that bit of unpleasantness this beer likely would have been pretty good.","TMoney2591","Feb 26, 2015"

Taste is a more robust version of the nose with nuts &  wheat, hay/dry grass, molasses, cherry & dark fruits being more prominent. More roast & some burnt tones, maybe a little smoke comes through. Finishes dry & earthy, with heavy roast & bittersweet chocolate rolling over to dominate the dry aftertaste.

It follows along the Anchor 'guidelines' as being very clean, and neatly structured. It's fruity, a touch chocolatey, subtly roasty, and wheaty. It reminds me of cold, sweet black coffee with some fruit juice added in... cherry? strawberry?... perhaps just a little... fig? yes. It's well balanced between each of it's components (let's not forget the moderate bitterness), and it's superbly polished.

4.03,6.6,,,,,,"Was looking forward to trying this one, a dark wheat sounds delicious.  This did not fail.  Great malty flavor right in your face, you get the wheat but the malt runs over it a bit.  Seems like a little of the dark fruit, like a dark belgian and even a little roast and chocolate.  Excellent creamy feel made this really enjoyable.  The only thing that kept it down was a little something funky at the very end that lingered, but I could not put my finger on it.","JamieDuncan","Dec 03, 2014"

Starts off toasty with very light nodes of chocolate and white pepper.  This moves into a dryer, more chocolatey middle and ends on a nice combo of wheatmalt and American yeast.","mynie","Nov 23, 2014"

3.94,4.2,4,3.75,4,4,4,"Poured into a Celebrator pokal. Pours a surprisingly dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque in the glass with a  fine one finger light brown head with good retention and lacing. Aroma of light caramel malt and a hint of chocolate. Flavor is toasted malt, wheat, chocolate and a hint of toffee. Medium bodied. Quite a surprise and not what I expected from this beer or style. The profile is almost more like a light porter than a dunkle weizen, which is apparently the origin of this American style. Not quite to style, but nicely balanced and flavorful. An interesing flavor departure for Anchor and one that I applaud. I liked this quite a bit.","LiquidAmber","Nov 16, 2014"
