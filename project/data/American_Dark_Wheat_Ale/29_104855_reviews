"O: Not bad..  a little light on flavor, but still one of the better things I've tried from AB."
"Taste starts out with a very artificial chocolate flavor, sweetness throughout with a hint of vanilla, fizzy carbonation makes it seems like a chocolate cola than a a beer"

"nice beer, drinks well at room temp or cold. not a everyday drink for me but a nice change with a sweet twist"

"O- this kind of drinks like a schwartzbier, only not as strong.  One of the better Shock Top beers, but nothing I'd buy again"

"Overall: Better than I expected, a sweet chocolate beer that if perfect for a winter night. I would drink it again."

"we need to call a spade a spade here, this really isnt half as bad as its ratings, the flavors are actually pretty good in it, the chocolate is really forward, and honestly not all that sweet compared to expectations. i could not really tell you its a wheat beer, very little real grain character to this one, but i will say that i like it better than plenty of craft chocolate beers, the only thing here is that it sort of feels cheap. the mouthfeel is really really light. dark(ish) beer for people who dont like dark beer, no body, lots of bubbles, minimal roasted malt balance against the chocolate, its simply chocolate in the flavor, which i dont hate, but its not that beery. there is a slight metallic property right before the swallow, and the thinness gets off putting, but it tastes pretty good honestly, and holds a creamy head pretty well. compared to its peers, its superior, we owe it to ourselves to admit that."

"I really wanted to try this as the easiest representative of the style to find, I think that I would like to try others from this type (American Dark Wheat Ale)"
""
"Cocoa & vanilla in front, round on mouth-feel, finish is sweet and soft. Poured according to label ""swirl final 1/2"" and pour to release flavor"". Leaves some sediment at the bottom."

"passable but not recommendable fare"

"O: Really not a bad brew, especially if you have a sweet tooth."
""
"The only Shock Top that did not make me want to vomit. This was surprisingly good."
"poos a nice dark brown.  a very nice strong chocolate scent and flavor. I was quite surprised how good the chocolate taste was. Easy to drink."
"A chocolate wheat, I was very skeptical.  I picked this up with low expectations but wanted a sweet beer after dinner.  I was not let down.  This wheat beer poured dark and the chocolate scent was pouring out of the glass.  It was not a cheap chocolate smell but a very enjoyable scent.  This beer was chocolate and delicious.  It was a perfect desert beer and not too sweet for me.  It drank almost too easy for me and the six pack did not last too long.  I strongly recommend this beer if you want a sweet holiday or desert beer that everyone will like.  I will not hesitate to buy this again."

"Overall: Surprisingly good, was not expecting this to be any good. I really enjoyed this beer."
"like chocolate milk."
""
""
"With the exception of the initial sweetener shortcoming that made the overall beer artificial, but that stopped to bother shortly, the flavors actually matched. Easy to drink, and fine for chocolate lovers."
""
""
"Dark brown.  Mild cocoa aroma.  Thin bodied with a touch of chocolate flavor.  Not too sweet but nothing to really rave about here either."
"Had a very fake chocolate syrupy taste!"

"Pours a dark black with little head. The smell is full of vanilla and chocolate. The taste was a bit disappointing with some wheat flavors in the beginning and then finishing with a lot of sugar which to me gave it a lackluster aftertaste that stuck around for too long. I think it was interesting and it wasn't bad, but for me I probably wouldn't buy again."

"Had a sample of this and no way would I want to drink a full bottle. Fake chocolate taste, sickly sweet, and cloying. Not an appealing beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a ""pint"" glass. Pours pitch black with an off white head that disappears almost immediately. Smells of chocolate and vanilla, nice inviting. Tastes of weak grain with chocolate aftertaste. Beer is light bodied and smooth, easy to drink. Overall a slightly above average beer."

"Very sweet and VERY chocolatey. Some find it cloying; I think it's perfectly refreshing and dessert-like around the holidays. It's ok to admit you like this beer."

"12 ounce bottle, one of my friends gave me a bottle to try. Served in a mug, the beer pours dark brown with about a half inch light tan head. Head retention is decent, and there isn't much lacing. Aroma is nice and sweet, it smells mostly like milk chocolate and malted milk balls, along with some wheat/bready malt and vanilla. I think the taste is just like the aroma, however I think the malted milk ball flavor is the strongest of them. Mouthfeel/body is thin, but it's also a bit slick with moderate carbonation. This isn't a bad brew at all, I liked it. Definitely worth a try, especially if you like sweet chocolate beers."

"Not bad, not good it's tasty enough to be better than OK but it holds a very artificial facade."

"Overall: An excellent dessert beer (it really is the dessert in and of itself, although it could pair remarkably well with a huge range of items). And an excellent holiday beer as well, although I think the sweetness really cuts it's drinkability down to one, or perhaps two for those with a bit of a sweet-tooth."

"Tried this on tap at a bar in a shopping center with my wife, while she was on a shopping break. Not much choice at this place... But this was surprisingly dark in appearance. With a low light brown head that dissipated fast, some lacing but not a lot. Smell was so chocolatey that it surprised even the wife (who considers herself a chocolate connosueir) she liked it more than me. It had a light taste and was heavily carbonated... Chocolate was a strong flavor, but it was too sweet for more than a pint..."

"overall i was impressed by this A-B inbev brew. poured darker than Guinness, the chocolate and vanilla are good, blended nicely. reminded me of a porter with low ABV. i would buy this again but i would not hesitate to try something better. i would never turn down one if offered."

"If you are just starting to expand your dark-beer horizons, try this beer...but make sure you like chocolate!"

"Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."

"O: Pretty good. Chocolate seems an odd thing to put in a wheat beer, but it works, it's refreshing and it tastes good. Worth a try."
""
""
"O: This beer is pleasant but really tastes like someone poured some Hershey's chocolate syrup into a wheat beer. It would make for a good dessert beer for someone who is just getting into craft beers."
""

"Meh."
"Shock Top Chocolate Wheat is a Brew Anheuser Busch. This brew pours like black coffee. I'm not saying that is a bad thing. You can taste the chocolate. This really dose not taste like beer. But this is an enjoyable brew. This was a different but I like it. This is an Outstanding Brew. I will get this brew to switch it up from Budweiser."

"I'm not a beer snob so this review won't be technical. I first had this beer on tap and fell in LOVE at first drink. Bought it bottled the next day. This beer is dark in color but has a nice light taste. It's like heaven in your mouth! I've had it alone, with a salad and it was super yummy with raspberry cheesecake. I am going to try mixing it with the Shock Top Raspberry Wheat this weekend, will let you know how that is!"

"The body can't quite seem to define itself. It feels a little thin with a definite spritz to it that isn't quite crispness. It feels clean, though, and overall it's neither good nor bad."
""
"Pours a very dark brown, almost black in color. Probably the darkest beer by the Bud folks so far. Close to a finger's worth of beige head that settles down quickly to just around the tops and sides of the glass. Some spotty lacing is seen. The aroma is very pleasant with cocoa powder, vanilla with some spices. The taste is actually about the same. No harsh or bitter aftertaste at all. Goes down pretty easy. Overall, it is different but not really bad as I am not a big fan of Bud products overall except for a select few."

"This has to be one of the darkest colored beers that AB has ever produced it's a Chocolate Wheat aged on cocoa and vanilla beans with spices. Large tan head fine bubbles fades slowly, pretty impressive look to it. Aroma has subtle cocoa creamy vanilla notes nothing in the way of noticeable spice additions on the nose. Flavor has a milk chocolate creamy character hints of dark roasts bring a bit of balance, the vanilla seems to be there throughout each sip and doesn't really fade away. Super sweet for me a bit more dark roasts might round it out, it feels like a hybrid wheat/milk stout with all of the lactose induced sweetness. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth textured medium bodied ample even carbonation, overall I can't really complain and I haven't attempted mixing this with the standard Shock Top as the label of the six pack holder depicts making black and tans with the two."

"The chocolate is big on the nose but not so big in the taste although it is the dominating feature. Crisp, mild bitterness toward the end. It does not hand around long. Drinks quickly but not necessarily easy."
"Poured into a trusty pint glass. Black in color and fingers worth of head. Mild chocolaty and very smooth and easy going. I wish i had tried this one sooner. One of the better shock top products out there. Another good beer to drink on a cold winter day"
""
""
""
"Edit: Appearance was the high scoring category for this beer until I discovered the nasty glob of mystery goo at the bottom of my glass..."
""
""
""
"O: more intense than expected from AnBev but has issues of balance."
""
""
""
""
"Overall I would recommend this beer to anyone looking for a truly chocolate tasting beer. However I bought this beer in a combined 6 pack with Shock Top's White Belgian and I would take the Chocolate Wheat over the White Belgian any day."
"A nice dessert brew!"
""
""
"This is one of the best chocolate beers I've sampled, and makes an excellent winter beer. I bought this as part of a half and half six pack containing three chocolate wheats and three Belgian whites that supposedly make a good black and tan. I'll probably try that at some point, but I'm not sure how to review it..."
""
""
""
"Had a great chocolate aroma. Got it in a build a six pack at Kroger wish I had just bought a six pack of this .I like the Organic chocolate stout from the more expensive brand it is better but for my pocket this is a good sub. The mouth feel is a bit thinner and the taste is a bit more corporate."
""
""
"this has to be the best beer i drink this year this beer is very close to winter bourbon cask ale and that was their best beer just a great tasting beer with chocolate in it taste wonderful from top to bottom with a little vanilla that not over powering so sit back just suck it down enjoy this beer because you never how long it will last"
""
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall –They do pack a lot of sweet chocolate into a rather modest abv. brew. If looking for something very chocolaty and sweet with a lighter abv. then this may be a good choice, but otherwise….."
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer has a very nice taste and fits the Shocktop line of beers nicely. I enjoyed it by itsself or with the Belgium Wheat."
""
"O: Not very tasty, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, not the best representation of style, typical beer from the Shock Top series."
""
"Taste falls apart on it a little bit, the malting is so damn light it is watery despite the cocoa and plastic-y vanilla flavor. Not a whole lot of anything else...the cocoa flavors are probably the best thing going for it, but even the Leinenkugel's Cocoa Porter has more going for it than this. Sister in Law brought a horrendous mixed sixer AB is pushing that has this beer and the regular shock top (3 of each) and you are supposed to mix them...yuck - mixed is worse than this by itself...by a longshot."
""
""
""
"O: This could definitely appeal to those who hate beer. Hell, even I think it's perfectly reasonable. Still, the appeal is mainly limited to aforementioned beer haters and chocolate lovers. I'd never refuse one of these regardless."
""
""
""
"Overall, not a terrific beer, but a pretty good, sweet, chocolate, winter seasonal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Additionally: I mixed half of the Chocolate Wheat with the regular Belgian White, as suggested on the box. 50/50 mix. Not bad, the orange, although interesting, overpowers the chocolate slightly. I'll have to experiment a little more but certainly worth the try."
"O-it says to mix this with a Shock Top Wheat, but I just tasted it without. It was good I will try it mixed another day"
