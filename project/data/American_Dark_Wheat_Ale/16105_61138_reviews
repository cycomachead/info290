"Overall: I like this beer, and this brewery. One of my favorite fall seasonals of this year. I'l drink anything that says Mayflower on the label."

"Really good nice and toasty with a zing to it."

"A great October beer, this is not over the top pumpkin or all-spice or cardamon. Worth a drink for sure."

"O - Frankly, not what I was expecting based on the label. That said, it's not bad, particularly if you like the more coffee-focused flavors. I still enjoyed it somewhat."

"As a Dunkel this is quite good."
"Overall a flavorful, nicely balanced autumn brew. It hit all the flavors that I like in an octoberfest. Worth a try."
"Drinks pretty much like an American Brown Ale with a pretty large dose of roasted specialty grains. Also reminds me just a bit of some European Dark Ales."

"I'm a fan of Mayflower - they put out some good stuff. Their porter is outstanding. This is a major misstep. They should can this next season and develop a more traditional Fall beer."
"O/D-I enjoyed this a bit. Berkshire's River Ale is an upgrade, but this is a perfect Fall brew; especially when you are sick of all the Pumpkin Ales out there. Pretty drinkable too!"

"Overall Impression- A very interesting ""Dark Wheat"" beer... Almost like a Shwarzbier or Black Ale but doesn't have the malt to support it. The metallic finish I found was very uncool though... However, I am aging my Mayflower Imperial Stout at the moment and excited for this! Thanks Larry!"

"A dark American wheat, eh? Well. Lots of creamy dark and toasty malts, brown sugar, very bready. As well as a yeasty kick. Though I do think it’s lacking a lot of body and doesn’t have enough lingering flavors in the finish. It seems like Mayflower almost always gets soooo close to delivering solid takes on certain styles but falls a little flat."
"O: Nothing earth shattering, a decent brew, but my least favorite Mayflower brew so far."
"O: A pretty enjoyable beer, I thought. Though, I would have preferred more of a traditional dunkelweizen."
"Overall it is ok, not the most interesting"
"O: If someone puts one in your hand, drink it. There are better fall offerings out there though. Personally I'm eagerly awaiting winter for Mayflower's Oatmeal Stout, which is their best seasonal, IMO."
"O - I haven't had many in this style but it was enjoyable."
"i had this last year and was not impressed. this year it seems to be much bolder and maltier. much better. recommended."
"Overall, this is quite good beer, and the rich, spicy, bready flavors make this a nice accompaniment to encroaching Fall weather. The beer does want for a slight boost in sugars to further combat the tart and sour flavors, but even without it, I'd go back for seconds."
"D: Kind of flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, everything I've had from mayflower so far has been pretty solid but this beer is mediocre at best."
"Overall: There are a couple things I am not crazy about when it comes to this beer. The first is the bitterness, the second is the carbonation. However, this beer really mellows out, and gets better as it warms."
"I'm a fan of mayflower, but this beer exceeded my expectations. On a pretty gold fall night, this was a great choice."
"D: Goes down ok, decent kick, not too filling, ok representation of style. Not a beer that I would pick up again, but not one that I would turn away."
"Drinkability: About as earthy a beer as I have had. This one is an aquired taste. Not sure if I would get this one again, but Mayflower should get points for creativity."
"drinks ok. tasty, but kind of confused. no alcohol harshness, but a bit of a burnt astringency throughout."
"I dug this but the unbalanced edge to this made me glad I got just one. just ok, but a very nice different twist on a dark wheat."
"Pours a nice dark brown color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy off-white head, with some minimal sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some very nice chocolate/toffee notes, bready. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, nice chocolate/toffee notes. Medium body. Drinkable, I like this one, recommended."
"This is not an enjoyable drink. Accordingly, headed to the drain."
"Mayflower is one of my favorite breweries due to the inherent earthy flavors in all their beers and this one falls right in line. Don't see this style to often. Great, great campfire beer."
"the drinkability pretty good, it's a pretty unique beer with some interesting things going on, but it lacks cohesion in my opinion. i can't see myself drinking more than a couple, the tang catches up with me. overall a good concept and pretty good execution."
"Not very interesting to be honest."
"The beer is fairly medium bodied, decently carbonated, and more creamy on the tongue than not. The taste is a deal breaker. It tastes like there is rye and bittering spices which really do nothing to endear me to this beer. The back end is just hard to take. At first I thought maybe there were some Bretty yeasts going on, than maybe some spices, maybe an odd variety of hop, maybe some rye wheat. I'm not sure what is causing this somewhat harsh bite in the finish, but it isn't good. The coarse wheaty feel is pretty much absent from the beer. There are plenty of slightly charred brown malts, some crystal malt I'm sure, but it comes down to that really harsh finish that just slays this beer for the worse. One and done for me."
"Flavorful dark malts, light bittering hops. The body is quite thin with an average level of carbonation. I taste things similar to bark like sassafras. This is a dry beer with a very short aftertaste."
"Served in a standard pint. Poured a dark, reddish-brown with ruby highlights around the base. Head was a half inch, loose and cream-colored. Nose was malty with a suggestion of lactose. Taste consistent with nose - toasted, medium-dark malts and a hint of nutmeg in the mix. Mouthfeel was light-medium, but had a somewhat water consistency, and carbonation was a bit fizzy. Flavors seemed a little muddled for me. Unfortunately, the whole package didn't really come together in my opinion."
"Clear, dark brown with a reddish hue -- more coppery than chestnut in tint. The fizzy beige cap fell quickly to a collar, which clung to the glass and left some short-lived, spotty lace behind. The aroma was sweet with dark, earthy malts (caramel and bread crust) and dried fruits - raisins mostly, but a bit of fresh plum as well. Slightly spicy. Balanced up front, herbal bitterness and bready malt, caramel, ripe plums. As the malt faded, the bitterness really took over, lingering long into the finish. It was much harder to pick out any spicy character in the flavour, but it was there towards the end once the beer warmed up a bit. Medium bodied with low carbonation, palate coating with light astringency. Quite smooth in texture. An interesting beer overall. I enjoyed it from start to finish."
"The finish comes mostly dry with a little lingering sweet syrupy flavor remnants. Some bitterness comes through as well, but just a little. More of the minerality flavors and more diacetyl. A slight dark wheat and bock flavor still, and hints of dark malts again. It gets very sticky and flemmy with the sticky flavors and dry feel combined."
"This is a very dark reddish brown brew with nice carbonation out of the bottle. Roasty aroma. Flavor is not like your typical dunkelweizen. American yeasts, apparently. Flavor is quite roasty, almost a bit smoky. Kind of like a pseudo-porter or deep brown ale. Mouthfeel is medium and it finishes with roasty-bread notes. Very drinkable."
