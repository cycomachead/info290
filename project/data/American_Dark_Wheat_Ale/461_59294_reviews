"O- Not bad, could be a little smoother with the heat turned down on the malts, perhaps."

"Pours a pitch black in color (or close to it) with a good 1/2+ finger beige head. Decent amount of lacing is seen with each sip. Lots going on with the aroma and is of roasted malt, dark fruit, cocoa and wheat. Even more going on with the taste with even a hint of hazelnut and weak coffee as well. Lighter-medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Never had a 'dark' wheat' before and didn't know what to except. Very easy to drink with no bitter of harsh aftertaste. Really liked this one!"

"overall i was pleasantly surprised by this offering. pretty tasty and enough going on to keep a drinker interested. what i didn't like about it was the use of adjunct and the too light mouthfeel. i was hoping for a dunkelweizen light and it's even lighter than that. seems to me that this is a beer to be paired with some snacks or to wash down a spicy sandwhich. recommended, but don't get your hopes up too high."
"O- First I have had of the style, so it will be the measuring stick for now. I liked it and would drink again and try more of the style."

"O: very mellow, interesting style, very enjoyable"
"Overall: very drinkable, not outstanding but a good beer"

"Dull on the taste buds. Dissappointing as this is a favorite style when done right"

"Overall - It's okay. I get a hint of the wheat at the initial taste, but fades very quickly. I get more of coffee stout feel from this brew than a dark wheat/Dunkel feel. It's delicious, however. I wouldn't turn it down. I wish the beautiful brown toasted head would stick around longer."

"Overall, this is a good brew. Something's just slightly off to keep it from being really good."

"a really vibrant beer, not brewed in the german tradition at all, as i originally expected. the pour is chocolatey brown, with a small tan head and probably a bit of sediment, but its hard to tell through the dark color. the nose is a good mix of wheat and dark roasted barley malt, sort of similar to a porter, but with the wheat in there to round this out and lighten it up a bit. the yeast isnt german either, but it doesnt ass many interesting characterisitics in smell or taste. a flavor of cocoa is in there for just a second in the finish, not sweet, but clever. a little heavy on the mouthfeel, approaching stout body, but the carbonation is lively and in combination with the wheat malt, makes a fun feeling beer. id be happy to drink a 6er of this anyday."
"Overall: Surprisingly interesting. A very drinkable, entertaining beer. Worth trying."

"Overall: It's OK, a bit like a watered down dunkelweizen."

"I'm not particularly familiar with the style, but based on this, it seems like they tried to craft a Black Ale with wheat, or a light porter/stout with wheat. While I don't know if the so-called ""American Dark Wheat"" genre name is appropriate, I still generally enjoyed this beer."
"I like it. This beer is finishes like a smooth sunset in the Sandhills...I really enjoy that orange coco finish! Very unique beer with a very unique finish..."
"Overall, a nice chocolaty wheat beer. Smooth, thin and refreshing with grainy feel and sweet dark taste."
"Overall: Not the greatest of Dark Wheat beers but by no means anywhere near the worst. Easily unique within it's own right I would drink think again and recommend it to somebody as a deviation from most in the style."
"O: It's similar to Guinness Draught, in appearance and mouthfeel. The taste is good for a wheat beer, malty upfront, than slightly grainy and stout like at the middle and end. It's a good dark beer, an awesome wheat beer, something I like to keep on hand."
"Definitely worth a try, hope they come out with a bigger product line soon"
"You easily could have fooled me that this was an american porter."
"D - Nice stuff. If this is any indication, ADWA is a style I would be quite partial to."
"D: A very easy drinking and good--yet somewhat simple--beer"
"The beer pours a dark brown color with a white head. The aroma is wheat with some darker malts. The flavor is very nice with coffee, wheat and chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This is a pretty good beer."
"Drinkability: Highly drinkable, love having a good beer offering available in a can. Was a little trepidatious when I read on the can that this was made with corn and wheat (worried about any corn adjunct flavors). I did not need to worry; this is a well made beer. Tasty, drinkable, and its availability in a can is another plus."
"D- I had fairly low expectations for this beer after reading on the side ""Brewed with corn and wheat"". I thought it was going to be more of a malt liquor, but I was pleasantly proven wrong. A quite nice beer with some unique aspects and good flavors."
