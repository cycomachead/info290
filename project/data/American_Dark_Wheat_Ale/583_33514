3.99,2.8,3.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"Drinkability- Not all that bad but only can drink one. This reminded me of the Schlafly Pumpkin ale except with more wheat added in and less ABV%. Wondering why it says this beer isn't being brewed anymore while I enjoyed it last night (3/7/11).","DCon","Mar 08, 2011"
3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"D- 4 I could enjoy this dark wheat beer for hours. It's very well-balanced. It's tasty and smooth and light enough to drink easily.

3.8,-2.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"Drinkability: Very, very pleasing and drinkable. While the American Dark Wheat Ale style description on BA states there should be no banana esters, you could definitely smell and taste them with this brew. A very pleasing wheat ale that has just enough going on to intrigue.","tito42","Jan 25, 2011"
3.88,0,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Poured from the tap a nice dark orangey yellow with a nice rocky white head, that disapated but left a small amount of lace for the rest of the beer. The smell is a nice mix of yeasty floral notes with some slight fruity and wheat notes. The taste is similar to the smell dominated by the yeast but is backed up by some decent bananna and clove with a small spice note. Mouthfeel is smooth and active with nice carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is wonderful could definately have a few of these. Very nice american wheat from Schlafly.","rpardon7","Nov 08, 2010"
4.48,15.5,4,3.5,5,4,5,"Appearance has a cloudy golden brown color so thick that i can't see thru the glass. Smells very aromatic with the yeast with a very sweet fruit smell to your nose. Tastes sweet, malty, biscuity, yeasty....then very sweet again with a little sour aftertaste. Good mouthfeel with a nice well balanced flavor not much carbonation. This is excellent, i would drink this again.","Frothboss","Nov 05, 2010"
3.74,-3.6,3,4,3.5,4,4,"Clear, deep amber with a slight redness and really no head to speak of. It almost looks as if its gone flat when sitting in the glass. The scent yields lots of spice with just a touch of banana and bubblegum. The tastes are much of the same with the addition of a fruity apple component. The spiciness really dominates and ends in a lingering pepper. You have to try to taste the banana and bubblegum. Despite the appearance of being flat, it has a good deal of carbonation. I didn't really know what to expect from this offering, but it was better than I anticipated. I'd have it again.","alkemy","Oct 30, 2010"
3.92,1,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"A fairly aggressive pour into a nonic glass yielded a quarter inch of tan head. It is amber colored. The aroma has a lot going on. I get bubblegum, banana, clove, and other spices. The taste is some caramel malt, clove and is dominated by spices. The mouthfeel is medium. I really like this beer. I wish the spices were muted a bit to let some of the other flavors come through. I would absolutely drink this again.","buschbeer","Oct 13, 2010"

3.7,-4.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"Quite impressive, to say the least: a clear example that American brewers can be creative without going overboard. Grilled lemon-pepper pork loin and Asiago polenta would be an awesome pairing to toss that this beer.","BeerAdvocate","Sep 27, 2010"

3.75,-3.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"D - Is good but since it reminds me so much of a German beer I'd rather have a Schneiderweisse or another German wheat for the fact they have much more body and in most cases, a much more accentuated aroma and flavor. However, this is a pretty good interpretation of a dark German wheat.","jzeilinger","Jul 30, 2010"
3.85,-0.8,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"On tap at Bottleworks. Called ""No. 15"" because it was made for their 15th anniversary, and then made into a year round offering because of it's popularity. Pours a cloudy brown with red hue. Small head quickly receeds, but leaves good lacing. Smells of banana, clove, and cinnamon. Good balance between spice and sweetness in the flavor. Carbonation level is about right, mouthfeel is medium bodied. A very drinkable beer, had two with lunch and it complemented the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich very well. Not a beer that you would walk in and see it on tap and say ""Wow, I have to try that one!"" but it's a very solid offering from Schlafly.","kylejohnson03","Jul 28, 2010"

4.42,13.9,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Drinkability: I'd rate this as high. I, and everyone trying the beer with me, held it in high regard.

4.06,4.6,5,4,4,4,4,"This beer pours a beautiful cloudy toffee amber color with minimal head to and absolutely no lacing to speak of. Nose is of yeasts, wheat, clove, and banana. Taste is of some malts, presence of wheat, there is toffee and sugary sweetness in the middle that lingers, finishes with some nice spicing. Medium body with low to medium carbonation, creamy feel in the mouth with a clean finish to it. The sweetness in this one makes it a one beer minimum for me, however - it is a nice lil brew to enjoy.","Jayli","Aug 18, 2009"

3.8,-2.1,4,4,3.5,4,4,"Multi-grain wheat bread up front. Light banana and some mild tropical fruit sweetness come in. Slight adjunct-y flavor follows along with some fruit juice. Mild spices (cloves, grains of paradise) hang around into the finish. Yeasty bitterness (mild) dries it out. Medium body, with a creamy feel. A nice drinking summer beer from Schlafly.","alexgash","Jul 28, 2009"
3.67,-5.4,3.5,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Pours a dark amber color with a full finger loose foamy head that resists fading, leaving spotty patterns of Belgian lacing behind. The smell is unexpected from a dark wheat...spicy clove and coriander. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is light bodied. The spicy pumpkin and interestingly fruity wheat is not typical. A reasonable drinker.","jjayjaye","Jul 26, 2009"

While the Cinnamon taste in the Christmas Ale can be a bit on the strong side, and possibly keep me from wanting to drink more than 1 or 2 in a night, I could put several of these No. 15s away pretty easily. As far as Missouri breweries go, Boulevard is #1 hands down. But Schlafly is making a strong case for the #2 position, and they offer some very enjoyable brews to back up this claim.

The fruit and spice is upfront and very pleasing. The sweet malt complements the fruit and gives a nice smooth aftertaste. The slight amount of hops taste dries the palate which is perfect for enjoying the next sip! Carbonation is a bit lower than I would have thought, but that is the least of my worries.

Aromas were inviting, ripe fruits, Eastern spices, caramel. The tastes were also complex. Malted sweetness, cooked bananas, notes of wheat provide a tang along with some citrus hops.

3.75,-3.4,4,4,3.5,3.5,4,"Thanks to rsyberg01 for this beer in a trade. I like dark wheat beers and don't believe I've tried an American one. This pours a hazy orange light amber with a good bit of yeasty sediment suspended in the beer. decent head that fades to a thin ring. Subtle fruity aromas of apple and pear with some light breadiness. Quite pleasant and yeasty. Very soft flavors of apple and pear and baked bread with a hint of bitterness on the finish. Pleasant, but doesn't knock me out. Smooth and soft in the mouth which makes it easy to drink, but it could either be a bit crisper, more robust, or spicier for my taste. Still, glad I tried it.","Georgiabeer","Mar 25, 2008"

4.09,5.4,3.5,4.5,4,4,4,"12 ounce bottle, ""bottled with love"" on 9/19/07. Served in a Sam Adams BL glass, the beer pours a hazy orange/copper color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are OK. Aroma is very nice, it's spicy and fruity, it smells like cloves, apricots, pepper, bananas and yeast. There's other aromas too, but I just can't ID them off the top of my head right now. Taste is pretty similar to the aroma, and there's also some grain that I can taste. Mouthfeel/body is medium with a bit above average carbonation. Drinakbility is good, it's easy to drink! No. 15 is a good beer overall, I wasn't disappointed with this one at all. If you get a chance to try it, you should.","bluejacket74","Feb 16, 2008"

Aroma is yeasty with almost Christmas spices. Taste is weaker than the aroma. There are definitely spices but I cant nail them down. The wheat beer flavors kind of are diminished. Not a lot of banana or citrus fruits. Both are present but not in big quantities. Mouthfeel is a little lighter than I expected. I think I would drink this in a bar but not go out and pick up a sixer.","hwwty4","Jan 22, 2008"

3.92,1,3.5,4,4,3.5,4,"Thought the beer was pretty nice. Timid, but nice. The beer poured a golden / copper hue with solid head retention, while wanting a bit more out of a wheat. The medium balanced aromas took the shape of cloves, bubblegum, banannas, and pineapples. Again, I wanted just a bit more intensity. The flavors were, too, of medium intensity, but a well balanced blend of barley and wheat malts, estery / fruity flavors, lightly spiced with hops and yeast, bready, and sweet. The textures could have used more help. The beer did not exhibit the creamy, full wheat flavors that it's German counterparts do - leaving the beer a bit too thin. Finshes somewhere between sweet and grainy. This was a good beer, but just a few small flaws keep it from being a stand out to me.","BEERchitect","Mar 01, 2007"

3.59,-7.5,3,4,3.5,2.5,4,"Pours a medium amber color with a thick light tan head. No surprises so far. The nose is really quite nice ... stewed fruit, banana, spice (cloves, nutmeg), wheat malt and yeast. The palate is of malted wheat, yeast and a little bit of spice notes. Starts warmer and sweeter, but is quickly balanced out by a drier hop profile that comes to the fore quickly. The biggest issue, to me, with this beer is the mouthfeel. It's just too thin for the style in my estimation. It just falls a little flat and doesn't have that substantial mouthfeel I like in a dunkelweizen style beer. Okay, it's not technically a dunkelweizen, I know, but this one has a lot of potential and promise. It's like a promising athelete who gets injured early in his career ... we'll just never know what it could have been. That said, I still like this one ...

No. 15 is a murky light orange in color with a ½ inch thick head that settles into a nicely formed white pasty ring around the pint glasssticky patches noted throughout the course. On the nose are fresh banana custard pie offerings, and soft wheat tones; very aromatic. Some cloves are detectable as this beer warms. Up front, a definitive dark-hefe feel, with some banana peel and wheat-like offerings, creamy and sweet. Kisses of coriander and orange peel; although both are hidden, they are blended nicely. Medium bodied across the boardvery little carbonation. The palate is cleansed, with both bananas, cloves and wheaty-ish malts. This is something that I could get used to. Unique style for this brewery, and incredibly enjoyable for the style; mighty tastya request for a year-round-offering of No. 15?","GeoffRizzo","Nov 18, 2006"

The head left a sheet of lace on the side of the glass. The nose definitely tells you this is a weizen beer. Dark fruit with banana esters. I don't get clove, nor did I detect the coriander, and orange the bartender told me where used in the brewing process. The flavor has a load of weizen character. Dark fruit and banana come across strong. I do get some of the orange in the flavor. This beer is quite sweet, not cloying, but the sweetness reduces the drinkability just a touch. Smooth and full mouth feel. Nice beer overall.","carln26","Nov 05, 2006"
