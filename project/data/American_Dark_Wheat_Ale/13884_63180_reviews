"Mouthfeel is crisp and a bit light. Nicely carbonated.  Not a  bad beer  but one that also provides a check in the box for my103 beer style!!!!"
"On tap at at Molly's in Hanover NH. A dark Amber pour with a bit of head that lingers and makes for a decent pattern of lacing. An interesting scent, and I'm not sure what to expect....maltiness? Or Hoppiness? I get both. A unique combo of toasted malt and piney bitterness, with a touch of pineapple fruit. For a session ale, which I often find lacking for flavor, this stood up nicely. I would have liked a bit more carbonation, but overall this was a perfectly decent, and original beer that I would try again."
"O: This is one beer that, broken down, is better in parts than when it's all put together. There is a solid malt foundation in both the nose and the flavor, but it doesn't seem to stand up to the hops, which come across as completely separate from the malty base, especially in the aftertaste. Hops are a bit too minerally and slightly metallic."
"Pour is transparent caramel color with a fairly tight white head.  Nose is slightly burnt toast, caramel malts, and a faint herbal grassy hop.  Flavor follows, a bit thin up front, burnt toast, sweet caramel malt, overly bitter hop presence, herbal and hay like finish."

"Solid flavor profile with a contrast of toasted grains and bright hops but the whole experience feels a bit watered down. It just doesn't hold the strength and depth of flavors it needs to be above average. The flavors seem to disappear from the palate almost immediately."

"really great tasting beer. Nice aroma finish"
""
"Pours a reddish brown, with a small white head.  The nose starts with a nice presence of pine, light citrus, and subtle caramel.   There are hints of pineapple, but they’re incredibly subtle. On the palate the body is medium to light, and heavily carbonated.  The hoppy elements like pine, grass, and grapefruit take the forefront over subtle brown sugar and caramel flavors with just a hint of bread.  The flavors are very straightforward, and there’s an undercurrent of flavor similar to a wheat beer.  On the ending, there’s a brighter fruit note like a stone fruit or a pineapple that just winks in before defaulting back to citrus pine and pumpernickel bread.  The finish is definitely hoppy."

"Strong toast, bordering on being burnt, is my first impression. The swallow features a solid bittering hop. This is enhanced by the dryness of the beer. A bit thin but the bubbles are also muted, so it works."
""
""
""
""
""

""

"The taste is bit more exuberant with a firm roasted malt character, bananas, sweetness, and a low to medium bitterness finishing it off. I'm a bit late in drinking this one but it was a harsh winter around here and it only feels like yesterday."
""
""
"Overall - unsure. Flavors good, aroma good, balanced, easy drinking. Just watery. I keepw anting to like Peak because I like what they are doing, but they remain a little hit-or-miss for me. This was close to a solid score except for the mouthfeel."

"Overall: It's an enjoyable wintery wheat beer. A nice break from the stouts and porters that dominate the winter seasonals. Also a nice nod to the fact that organic beer can also be good beer; if you blinded tasted this with someone, there's no way they would guess it was an organic or health-conscious beer style."
"Overall: A good, but not great, winter session ale. I would get this again, but I don't think I'll actively seek it out in the near future."
"Overall for my preference, it's not bad for a few sips, but I wouldn't go for it again. And that's only because I'm not crazy about the hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"I think this beer gets rapped due to being Organic, and also not really being a wheat beer. Needs to be tasted blind. I found it a hoppy, sessionable, approachable, catty, long finish ipa. Would gladly enjoy again."
""
""
""
""
"Overall it's just another reminder why I steer clear of organic beer."
""
"The nutty malt which is almost like peanuts and the bright citrus herbal hop combination is a bit different so it definitely gives a unique taste but it still stands out as a unique must try beer in my opinion."
""
"Definatly sessionable and a clean beer. That's really all I can say about this beer. As a true beer geek, this is not something I would seek out."

"Half finger head with nice lacing on a clear amber with a very slight golden hue body. Aroma of earthy hops, caramel, toasted malts and sweet breads. Flavor is nicely balanced with earthy and bready flavors and sweetness with wheats and rye. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Fairly certain this is the first of this style I have had. Very drinkable and flavorful."
""
""
"Enjoyable session beer, but not particularly a ""winter"" ale."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A highly drinkable hoppy ale, great flavor. Highly sessionable and fresh. Definitely will have this again."
""
""
""
"This is my first Dark Wheat Ale. I didn't really know what to expect. This was surprisingly hoppy and flavorful. It has surprising depth for a wheat ale. This isn't at all a bad beer. I could definitely drink a lot of these. It's also a nice change of pace from the other heavy or over-spiced winter offerings."
"Overall a tasty hop forward winter beer."
""
""
""
"O - I was surprised at how much this beer impressed me. It turned me on to the style. I'll be trying any dark wheats that I can get my hands on."
""
"American Dark Wheat, eh? I don't mind this. I'll seek out more. This one here... is good. Good? Yes."
""
"O - overall I am very impressed. Very refreshing winter ale, not heavy by any means, not filled with a bunch of spices, doesn't let me down. Sure I do like the heavy winter warmers but i think the winter session ale is a good concept, and this example is well executed."
"O: A good winter session beer. Could definitely drink a few of these."
""
""
""
""
"A nice bright amber with an off white head that doesn't hang around. It's got a nice hop nose; piney, citrusy. The taste falls short a quick hop blast falls into a garlicky middle and then fades into cloying wheaty finish. It goes down smooth and would be easy to drink a couple."
""
"Overall not a bad seasonal beer, interesting just wish the aroma wasnt so off. Maybe blending in some more hops would help."
"A clear, mahogany colored winter ale with an impressive eggshell cover and tenacious lacing. The aroma has tart rhubarb yeast and strawberry caramel-vanilla. Very interesting, I like it. The flavor brings more tart lemony malt with a bit of ginger-nutmeg. It's a little aqueous in feel, medium-light bodied with mild but tingly carbonation. I get a little bit of an evergreen hop that makes this an overall enjoyable change up for the winter months!"

"Pours a clear copper with a foamy khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, and some onion, garlic, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with a very earthy flavor on the finish. There is a medium hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty average beer with the onion and garlic aromas and flavors I am not a fan of."
"Cheers (and have a safe winter!)!"
""

"o - This is a delicious session beer. I'll buy a case, if it is on sale."
""

"Poured into 5oz taster glass til gone..really nice white head with dark brownish color and with a little lacing. Smell is lacking and tastes better than smells . I never had dark wheat before but tastes and looks are great just lacks smell that would balance everything! Tastes malts and light toastyness that is pleasant and a hint of wheat. Mild Carb and easy to drink so I'll have another. I'm sure its old being June but still enjoyed and like organic beer for flavor!"

"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a brown color with amber hues and a 1/2 inch head. Smell is hops, some spice and malts. Taste is good, some hoppy bitterness up front followed by toasted malts, a touch of wheat. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a quality beer."
""
""

"O: Very light and really easy to drink, a very sessionable beer. I really like the spice hint that I get in this beer."

"I missed most of the seasonals this winter as I was busy hustling and spending my meager finances on the wife and kids. This is a pleasant find at the end of the winter. A clear light brown fluid with a smallish off white head. It recedes after a moment and there is a good amount of lacing on the glass. Smell is buttery with a roasted graininess and a mild hop blend of earth and light citrus. Taste is quite nice with a malty front of lightly sweet bread and maybe a touch of dark roasted wheat with butter. Finish is dry with a firm hop bitterness both earthy and citrus. Nice weight. Enough heft for the winter while not being heavy and with a lovely light, smooth carbonation. I went through my bottle quickly and since this is a session ale that would be appropriate. Nice winter session ale indeed."
"Pours a clear brown color with a fingers of head. The aroma is very nice, it's got a very rich banquet of some strong citrus and floral hops, along with sweet toffee. The taste is also quite good, it's got a little something here for everyone. Piney, citrus hops come through first, followed by some wheat, with the finish providing some nice toffee and coffee flavors. The mouthfeel is well-carbonated and light, but the finish provides just a slight drying effect that, together with the ending roast, is quite satisfying. The drinkability is very good. Overall, this one took me by surprise. It's a fairly unique winter seasonal brew that hits a ton of different flavors without seeming disjointed."
"O) A great beer. I will be having another."
"Overall: I’ve had one or two brews by Peak Organic at pubs in the US, but I haven’t formed a clear impression of them yet. They have some very interesting sounding beers, and I do hope to get my hands on more; this one is promising."
"Poured into a standard pint glass a clear amber/brown with a frothy one finger white head atop,I expected some haze with this being a wheat ale.The citra hops come thru nicely giving some piney and citric notes mixed with molasses,a nice mix.A little thin in the feel it seems to take a little away from some flavor depth.The cita hops play arole on the palate giving off some grapefruit qualities and there is some raw nuttiness as well but again that thinner feel stops the complexities in their tracks.This is close to being good but the malt bill needs to be bumped up a little."
"O - This has good drinkability. It is smooth and the flavor is nice. I could drink a few pints of this. Overall, I think it is a nice and interesting beer. This is my first dark wheat ale, but I would like to find some more. I really liked the balance between the toasted malts and the citrus hop flavor. It just worked for me. It is worth trying out."
"Pours a clean orange-ish color with an off white head. In the aroma, gingerbread like and a note of peppermint. In the taste, orange citrus and just a touch minty. A smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a small dry orange citrus hop like aftertaste. Tastes of orange citrus with the hops, but fresh hop like brings the mint like note."
""
"Overall: Really surprised by this one. Almost drinks like a pale ale as i found the wheat character didn't show through much. But you should still try it."
"Notes: I like what they did with the hopping here. The lemony citrus notes perfectly accentuate the other flavors without stealing the show. I do detect some butterscotch here too, as I have in some of Peak's other beers. Product of ringwood yeast? At any rate, I don't find it offensive here."
""

"This isn't one of those holiday spiced Winter beers, it's a warm your chest from the inside type of beer."

"Pleasant enough, but kind of a ""meh"" beer. Definitely a sessionable beer."

"boring beer don't waste your time"
"Peak organic winter session ale pours a bright deep copper with a nice fluffy off white head. The aroma is pleasantly hoppy with some nice grapefruit and pine. There is a nice toasted malt aroma in the background. A bit of caramel malt pops up first in the flavor showcasing a nice solid malt backbone. The piney, herbal and citrusy hops pop up quickly with a really nice tangy bitterness that borders on resins. The moderate bitterness lingers in the finish, but is never overpowering. This is an excellent and balance beer that does a nice job of showcasing both malt and hops."
"O - a pretty good beer at a reasonable price."
"The body is light with good carbonation. Overall this one is solid. Always a treat in the variety pack."
"Pours a reddish clear medium brown with fast fading off-white head that settles to a thin ring and leaves a few wisps of lace on the glass. Smell: buttery (ugh), toasty, unripe plum. That pineapple-heavy hopping would have been nice if it wasn’t overwhelmed with diacetyl. Taste: hopping is lemon and pineapple and somewhat raw; buttered toast, tannin heavy backend. Feel starts out fluffy with active carbonation that tries to hide the overattenuated body, but ultimately fails. I like the idea, but it doesn’t come together. Marked best by June 2012, so must be a recent bottling."
"mahogany with an almost tan, off-white head that holds for a bit, shrinks to a collar and leaves a bit of lace. nose is piney, fruity hops with caramel, a touch of toast and and ever-so-subtle wheatiness. taste is a nice balance of caramel and hop on a medium body that has plenty of substance and a nice, zippy feel. almost gingerbread-like to me with the spice of the hop and wheat combined with the caramel. could just be the season. anyways, lots of layers of flavor for a relatively low abv beer. very nice. i am really liking this one, and LOVE the fact that someone made a Christmas/winter brew that isn't going to kick my ass and wreck my palate. good one peak!"
"D: This beer was a pleasant suprise. I'm not sure if its fully representative of the style, but still an interesting and tasty brew. I will definitely grab this one again."
"O: uh, just average, probably won't seek it out again"
""
""
"O: The beer goes down smoothly and isn’t that difficult to drink once you get used to the unusual combination of bread and citrus."
""
"We did a large christmas and winter beer tasting panel and this was one of the many that we tried. Most of the beers we tried we solid including this one that the panel liked."
"Cheers!"
""
"The taste is interesting. The scent carries over and it's a strong, malty ale. Spciey to an extent, but dry so there isn't most of a carryover of aftertaste. Unique, but not a good high-quantity beer."
""
""
"This is a nice sessionable brew for sure. Goes down real easy and has a real nice hop presence. My first experience with Peak Organic and I like this one."
"Pours a golden orange with a thin head. Not much retention, but very nice lacing. Aroma is of roasted caramel malts and dark fruit. Body is light and crisp with some carbonation. Taste is of dark fruits and malts up front,roasted nutty finish. It's June, but I liked it anyway."
"The beer starts with a mouth full of carbonation. The carbonation subsides and leaves a stickiness on the tongue. The flavor starts sweet and quickly becomes a mix of tart and almost acid flavor. At the very end I get some roasted flavors mixed with the hop bitterness."
"Good mouthfeel of caramel and cascade through and through. Nice on the wallet, Whole Foods found a nice exclusive contract on this one methinks."
"D- Medium. For a hop lover who's looking for more than a pale but less than an IPA"
"Pours a dark amber almost brown. Some off white head. Smell has a noticible amount of hops with some biscuity malt. Taste has a nice hopiness initially followed by an off putting buttery, diacityl flavor. Finish leaves you with that butteriness clinging to your palate. Not pleasant at all. This was my second peak organic beer and both have been quite disappointing."
"Pours a three finger thick, off-white head that fades very slowly leaving a good lace. Nice crystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Nose is light grapefruit hops, flavor is same with the grapefruit hops up front, malts are in background. Lingering bitter aftertaste. $2.25 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Westborough, Ma."
"Decent with my meal for sure. Easy drinking, not filling or overdone. The watery edge to this is a little off-putting, but overall a pleasant surprise."
"D: Kind of a winter beer for CA in a way, the hops start to give a pale ale feel making an interesting mix with the wheat character. Full flavoured, a nice surprise in this rare category."
"D - Not really something I would buy again but would be a good offering in a variety case. Solid hop and mild caramel malt. Good beer."
"D: This is definitely a sessionable beer, it's not too heavy by any stretch. The abv allows for a sixer to be gone with no problem at all"
"Another solid Peak Organic offering."
"Aroma is quite strong and rye-ish with a rosiny overtone and just a hint of citrus. It pours a dark coppery amber with a fairly thick buff-tan head that leaves a decent amount of lacing. Flavor has a strong rye core with hoppy and citrus tones and a whisper of caramel. Texture is quite smooth and somewhat fizzy, leaving behind a nice, if not too persistent, tingle."
"Verdict: Ok beer on being more malty with bread tastes, but I felt deceived by the taste after high hopes with the smell and appearance of it. If you've tried a beer that is toasty or bready, you'll like this beer. If not, there are probably better choices out there. Either way, get it soon or wait 'til next year. B- (3.35)"
"Drink is decent, no real booze, fairly easy to go down, a bit of the minerality and bitterness on the finish don't help."
"Drinkability: A winter ale, maybe, but not a winner ale and not overtly wheaty for a wheat-based brew. The unengaging maltiness overlapped with buttery diacetyl and Citra hops just didn't do it for me."
"GRADE: B-"
"D: Balanced beer with an easy going flavor profile. Nice for introduction of winter ales for newcomers to craft beer. Not too assertive and easy going."
"The beer pours a dark amber/brown color with a thick frothy off-white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a dry pale, wheat, crystal malt scent along with a nice bouquet of yeast esters. The taste is decent. It has a bone dry pale, wheat, and crystal malt flavor. It has a light hop character and some excellent yeast notes in the finish. The mouthfeel is decent as well. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a very drinkable session ale. It's overly complex, but it does have some interesting yeast character and a touch of hops."
"Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but at 5% abv, this is understandable. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by this brew, as I quite enjoy hoppy wheat beers. I enjoy Peak Organic for their simply but solid representations of various styles and beers like this might make me consider them more often."
"a dark end of 10 percent wheat and mostly earthy citrus hops. a tad darker than amber with a nose of pear and raspberry. the beer is simply that with a bitter finish. not something that you can have more than one of in my sense of drinking. one dimensional and simple but there consistent. so it could be a beer to love but is all based on personal"
"Overall I really enjoyed this beer. Definitely lives up to the ""Session"" part of its name as you can enjoy several of these without feeling a major buzz, and I highly recommend this one on a cold winter night if you'd like to remember that warmer weather is just around the corner."
"I have mixed emotions about this beer. I tend to enjoy most winter style beers but this one just tastes a little ""off"" to me. A lot of the organic style beers (this one included) have more of an earthy taste to them in my opinion, although conversely, this beer seems to lack in the spiciness that I desire with a winter ale. It has a nice subtle caramel and roasted flavor, but it just seems kind of plain to me and lacks a complex flavor dynamic. Average carbonation with a decent head when first poured. Not the best winter beer I've had, but not the worst either."
"Not a terrible beer on the whole, nor one I'll go out of my way to try again."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability was pretty decent, I liked the sweeter wheat and malty flavors it had. Enjoyable beer overall and a pretty decent winter seasonal as well."
"The best before date is May, 2011, so it seems like something went wrong in production and bottling. I like the idea and basis for this beer that I'll try it again. I sincerely hope it gets better."
"D: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, this is a very good beer worth drinking for a long time."
"Peak impresses in a usually unimpressive style. With the light feel and citrus hops this could do as a spring beer as well."
"M, D- Straightforward, medium-light. Not quite enough substance to inspire drinking."
"Bought a six pack at Table and Vine. The beer has a clear, light amber brown color with patchy lacing on the sides. Great aromas of pine, cloves, citrus, and malts. Light bread flavor with a sweet, malt aftertaste. Really clean finish and crisp mouthfeel. This is a very refreshing beer for me at least."
"The mouthfeel is soft, most definitely from the wheat. Winter Session is dark without being roasty, flavorful, & easy drinking."
