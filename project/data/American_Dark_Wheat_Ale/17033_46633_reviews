"To be fair, I'll try this again, with a cheese plate, though it probably won't be this winter. I enjoy Franconia's other offerings, just not this one."
"This was my least favorite at this brewery."
"I want to be a fan of every beer from this brewery; my heart is open, so to speak. That's probably why I was so disappointed. Franconia can do better than this, and in a year's time, I'll revisit this beer to see if any improvements were made."
"The beer pours a hazy brown color with a cream-colored head. The aroma is heavy on the wheat, toffee and banana. The flavor is similar, with a few added notes. I get a lot of wheat, toffee, caramel and banana, but I also get some cinnamon and cloves. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. One of the better Franconia beers."
"This is a very flavourful beer. Very few foods can compete with the strength of the flavour, and perhaps it's just the moment but it's hard to imagine enjoying this beer as anything more than a novelty. I am quite a fan of Franconia and their adherence to the German purity laws. But, honestly, this bee is a bit much. A little to much of summer in my winter."
"Good beer."
"Overall this was kind of a sour beer. Too much of a wheat like taste for me as well."
"Nice light winter spiciness that might be from spice addition, hops, or wheat. I like that it's not over-the-top like many wintery ales. Nice wheat flavor. Nice smooth creaminess. Pretty good drinkability."
