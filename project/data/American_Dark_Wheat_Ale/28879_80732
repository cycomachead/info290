3.31,-8.1,4,3,3.25,3.5,3.5,"Pours to a deep reddish-brown.  Head is off-white and dissipates quickly, leaving light lacing.  The aroma is a little corny, but otherwise decent.  Mild flavors.  The dark grain flavors really overpower any wheat taste you might get.  Usually wheat has a sweet, spicy flavor, but this drinks more like Leinenkugel's Snowdrift Vanilla Porter than a wheat ale.  The carbonation is almost perfect, while the flavors hit the palette rather mildly.  This is better than I was expecting.  The price wasn't too bad either, build your own 6-pack for $7.99","HawbakerBrewery","Feb 26, 2015"

3.45,-4.2,3.25,3.25,3.5,3.75,3.5,"Pours a clear dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of roasted malt, wheat, cocoa, and slight char aromas. Taste is much the same with char and cocoa flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that has a slightly better taste in my opinion.","UCLABrewN84","Jan 13, 2014"

Anyway, this stuff pours a deep midnight sienna topped by a finger of relatively short-lived khaki foam. The nose comprises coffee, light treacle, and a hint of graham cracker way in the back. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a clear vein of cola. The body is a light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a dry, crisp finish. Seriously,. everything falls off of an apparently tall and steep tabletop at the end, making me wonder whether or not I've even had anything in my mouth. Overall, this is an interesting beer that I can't pin down in my head. There isn't much wheat influence as I can tell, there's plenty of roast, and nothing stays long enough for me to get acquainted. I guess I could say I wouldn't mind having another, but I'm not likely to ever seek it out again.","TMoney2591","Oct 02, 2013"

Color is an opaque brown black. Aroma is malt and roast. Flavor's like nose, with good balance between bitter, sweet, and tang. Body and carbonation are good.
