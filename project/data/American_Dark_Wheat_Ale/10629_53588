2.92,-13.6,3,3.5,2.5,3,3,"Overall I found this to be a confusing beer and is not one I would want to pick up again. Some of my friends had tried this beer before and mentioned that it had a slight sourness, so I am not sold on infection being the reason for the odd taste. Overall a pretty poor beer.","zoso1967","Jan 07, 2011"

4.05,19.8,3.5,3.5,4.5,4,4,"This beer poured dark brwon in color, with a slight coudiness. This could have been from the colder serving tempurature as it dissipated a bit after sitting. The color was also a little darker that many Oktoberfests. I noticed a mild hoppy and grainy aroma on the quarter-inch head. The beer presents as a wheat in the mouth and has a slight chocolate-malt flavor in the taste profile. Unique twist on an Oktoberfest.","goast8127","Oct 22, 2009"
4.12,21.9,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"D - A nice flavor profile that is not a typical marzen but is much more delightful.","Jpatrix","Beers"
3.13,-7.4,3.5,3,3,3,3.5,"D- A boring beer but it goes down nicely. Hopefully other offerings from this brewery are a bit more exciting.","david131","0"
