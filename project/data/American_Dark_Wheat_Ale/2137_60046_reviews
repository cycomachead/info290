"T - Absolute taste explosion. Smooth wheat combined with hints of caramel and malts. So many tastes going on at once. Great combo of wheat, caramel, and malts."
"On-tap at Flying Saucer in Raleigh served a crisp brown with a decent khaki head that slowly diminishes to a ring but leaves great lacing on the glass. Aroma is some dark malts and wheat. The taste is an interesting amount of dried fruits and dark malts with mild spice, almost like a light weizenbock. The beer is on the light side of medium with decent coronation. This is certainly a unique beer, one worthy of celebrating the 15th anniversary of my favorite beer bar chain!"
"On tap tonight at the Breckenridge barbeque spot on Kalamath. Our server told us it was brewed for a restaurant back in Texas (or Tennesee, he wasn't sure) and that they threw it on tap. A pretty decent wheat beer all around, if you are not really looking for a wheat beer. Somewhat sweet, with a little cherry, a little caramel and maybe some spiciness from the wheat. Refreshing and drinkable."
"D: This is a nice session beer. The wheat seems more like a lightener, rather than a contributor to the flavor. Overall, a pretty decent beer."
