3.96,8.5,4.25,3.75,4,4,4,"Verdict: One of the better beers in the wheat/amber ale category I've tried to date. It's soft, smooth, rustic, and more importantly it's very easy to drink. This really hit the spot on a cool fall day.","kevanb","Sep 22, 2013"

3.85,5.5,3.5,3.5,4,4,4,"O- This beer was a interesting cross between a amber ale and a wheat that came off very well. It seems at times people try to oversimplfy this style and they have shown that you can go in the opposite direction and still have a great outcome. The ABV is low enough and the body is strong. What more could you really want in a hybrid wheat?","SmartyPints","Beers"
3.88,6.3,4,3.5,4,4,4,"Had a glass at the Kalamazoo Beer Exchange. Man, this beer is out there - a hybrid wheat-amber-pale ale. And I'd say it's well made beer at that. It had a strong balance of spicy, Euro-like hops with smooth bready, toasty barley and wheat with a share of caramel. Despite weighing in at 6.1%, but this beer is very drinkable and quite interesting.","tempest","0"
