3.58,-1.9,4,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"The beer pours an amber color with a white head. The aroma has some grass and toffee, but not too much else. The flavor is a little more complex. I get some sugar and honey notes, as well as some grass and toffee. The beer is fairly sweet overall. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","Mora2000","Feb 09, 2011"

3.73,2.2,4,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,"This is certainly an interesting take on the style with the honey and light tartness adding something different. Decent stuff.","gford217","Oct 26, 2010"
4.3,17.8,4,4,4.5,4,4.5,"Lots of bubblegum, sweet candy and a yeasty wheat tang. Decent hoppy bitterness on the finish. Toasted malt is an odd, but tasty addition to the flavor profile. Wouldnt mind a bit more creamy body, but overall I am very happy with this beer, will have no problem polishing this bomber off by myself. Gets better as the bottle goes along, and is downright tasty as fuck the last glass or two. Let this one warm up to around 50-55 before drinking.","twiggamortis420","Sep 14, 2010"
3.36,-7.9,4,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Many thanks go out to Daniel aka stopbarking for sending me this new one from Freetail. The beer pours out a nice hazy ruby color, with a very healthy amount of frothy white heading. Nose has some fresh grains, mainly the Vienna malt poking through, a bit of citrus fruit, not much on the wheat end. More of the same flavor wise, with the rye coming through well. It says on their site that there is Texas brush fire honey here too, which i suppose I get a hint of. The mouthfeel leaves a bit to be desired in that it is pretty thin and watery. The drinkability is not bad, with a decent amount of flavor keeping things interesting in the long run. Overall this brew is halfway decent, but nothing that I would look to try again. They definitely get a nod from me for doing so much experimenting though. Cheers","jamie2dope","Beers"
