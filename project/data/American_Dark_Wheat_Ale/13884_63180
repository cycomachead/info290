3.74,1.6,4,3.75,3.75,3.5,3.75,"On tap at at Molly's in Hanover NH. A dark Amber pour with a bit of head that lingers and makes for a decent pattern of lacing. An interesting scent, and I'm not sure what to expect....maltiness? Or Hoppiness? I get both. A unique combo of toasted malt and piney bitterness, with a touch of pineapple fruit. For a session ale, which I often find lacking for flavor, this stood up nicely. I would have liked a bit more carbonation, but overall this was a perfectly decent, and original beer that I would try again.","RobbDogg","Jan 18, 2015"
3.8,3.3,4,4,3.75,3.5,3.75,"O: This is one beer that, broken down, is better in parts than when it's all put together. There is a solid malt foundation in both the nose and the flavor, but it doesn't seem to stand up to the hops, which come across as completely separate from the malty base, especially in the aftertaste. Hops are a bit too minerally and slightly metallic.","Kendo","Jan 15, 2015"

There are hints of pineapple, but they’re incredibly subtle. On the palate the body is medium to light, and heavily carbonated.  The hoppy elements like pine, grass, and grapefruit take the forefront over subtle brown sugar and caramel flavors with just a hint of bread.  The flavors are very straightforward, and there’s an undercurrent of flavor similar to a wheat beer.  On the ending, there’s a brighter fruit note like a stone fruit or a pineapple that just winks in before defaulting back to citrus pine and pumpernickel bread.  The finish is definitely hoppy.","TastyFoodAndDrink","Beers"

Smell is buttery with a roasted graininess and a mild hop blend of earth and light citrus. Taste is quite nice with a malty front of lightly sweet bread and maybe a touch of dark roasted wheat with butter. Finish is dry with a firm hop bitterness both earthy and citrus. Nice weight. Enough heft for the winter while not being heavy and with a lovely light, smooth carbonation. I went through my bottle quickly and since this is a session ale that would be appropriate.

The taste is also quite good, it's got a little something here for everyone. Piney, citrus hops come through first, followed by some wheat, with the finish providing some nice toffee and coffee flavors. The mouthfeel is well-carbonated and light, but the finish provides just a slight drying effect that, together with the ending roast, is quite satisfying. The drinkability is very good.

I do detect some butterscotch here too, as I have in some of Peak's other beers. Product of ringwood yeast? At any rate, I don't find it offensive here.","ryan1788a5","Jan 22, 2012"

There is a nice toasted malt aroma in the background. A bit of caramel malt pops up first in the flavor showcasing a nice solid malt backbone. The piney, herbal and citrusy hops pop up quickly with a really nice tangy bitterness that borders on resins. The moderate bitterness lingers in the finish, but is never overpowering. This is an excellent and balance beer that does a nice job of showcasing both malt and hops.","ericj551","Dec 20, 2011"

Smell: buttery (ugh), toasty, unripe plum. That pineapple-heavy hopping would have been nice if it wasn’t overwhelmed with diacetyl. Taste: hopping is lemon and pineapple and somewhat raw; buttered toast, tannin heavy backend. Feel starts out fluffy with active carbonation that tries to hide the overattenuated body, but ultimately fails. I like the idea, but it doesn’t come together. Marked best by June 2012, so must be a recent bottling.","babaracas","Dec 14, 2011"
