Smells of coffee, hint of sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of pale malt, and a hint of hops. Fits the style of an American Dark Wheat Ale. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp, with an average carbonation level. Tastes of coffee, sweet malt, hint of roasted malt, hint of hop, hint of alcohol, and slight yeast. Overall, good aroma, body, and blend. The coffee is an amazing attribute in both aroma and body.","Tone","Jun 22, 2014"

4.83,14.5,4.25,5,4.75,4.75,5,"O - Well hello there, Joe. I feel like I should have poured you into a ceramic mug because you're damn near coffee! This 3 Sheeps seasonal offering screams freshly ground, freshly brewed coffee through and through, so much so in fact, it's hard to detach the mind from the bean long enough to admire it's gently wheat and balanced roasted malt flavor. If the beer smells this good, I can't even imagine how fantastic the brewhouse must smell on Joe brew day! If it's straight-up coffee you're looking for in a beer, look no further.","BeerFMAndy","Mar 29, 2014"
4.46,5.7,4.25,4.5,4.5,4.25,4.5,"Fantastic coffee beer. So glad I grabbed this based on previous reviews and a recommendation at the store. I HATE the taste of a fresh cup of coffee. Coffee in beer I tend to find amazing. This fits that bill. Packs the coffee flavor of a say a Bourbon County Coffee, but drinks so much easier. This beer is a must for coffee/coffee beer lovers! 3 Sheeps will grab peoples attention with this concoction for sure.","jera1350","Mar 21, 2014"

Lovely coffee aroma (from Alterra, a great Milwaukee roaster) with a flavor that doesn't overwhelm, this is a wonderful variation on their already-terrific Baaad Boy wheat. Pours nicely too, even on a chilly day.","smitty4657","Sep 28, 2013"

4.56,8.1,4.5,4.75,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Overall, a very unique and delicious coffee beer. Lighter bodied and smoother than most coffee stouts, but also well balanced between the roasty character and the sweetness of the brew.","JRO","0"
