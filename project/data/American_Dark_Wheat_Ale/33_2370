On my first sip, im hit with honey, toffee, caramel, straw, some banana, clove, raisins. The willamette hops provide a long, earthy hop finish. The mouthfeel is light, with moderate/low carbonation.

The ale appears a clear deep copper color with about a finger of lingering tan colored foam.

The smell was of sweet malts, a little bit of hops, and a little sting of alcohol. The taste is not too far off from that. It's dominated by sweet malts right up fronts: caramel, toffee, and bready and toasted notes. Still, the flavor ends up with a double-bite along with the sweetness: a little bit of alcohol and a mild touch of hops. Unfortunately, the combination of flavors (especially the sweetness), combined with a somewhat thick mouthfeel, gives a slightly syrupy feel to the beer. However, the high level of carbonation saves the beer. Overall, it's an enjoyable beer to drink, with plenty of flavor.","micahgoldfus","Feb 12, 2009"

The beer is not much carbonated, medium bodied, quite smooth, a slight hop presence more towards the finish, and maybe some warming ABV in the finish as well.

4.35,10.4,4,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,"Another excellent choice from BCB. This one is about two shades darker than their APA, being somewhat ruby-colored when held up to a light, with a decent tan head. The head lets go a lovely bouquet of malty caramel and even a little alcohol, but also some nice dark tones of toffee and fruit. This is one of those beers I want to smell as much as drink. The malt is front and center with this one, but you'll find that the hops gives a subtle whack as you swallow. The 7.0% ABV gives it some warmth, but the alcohol remains in the background. As with many BCB beers, the carbonation is relatively low so the overall feel is smooth, making the beer highly drinkable. Worth going out of your way to find and, as always, it's extremely affordable. Buy two.","gfreed","Nov 02, 2008"

Murky clarity with bands of thick lacing that were revealed after each quaff. Nose is caramel and pale malts, as well as some sugar and light fruity esters (perhaps pear). Taste follows nose as well as a bready character. Mouthfeel is light to medium and well-balanced with a nice amount of carbonation to round it all out. Some of the breadiness in the taste lingers at the finish. Easy drinking and flavorful brew.

3.8,-3.6,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"22 oz. bomber, unfiltered, unpasteurized, and best-by 4/8/08; brewed with a portion of wheat malt and sampled a month ago. It pours a deep crimson, with medium carbonation and two inches of tight, light tan head that recedes to a clingy collar. A bit of a wheat twang in the nose, along with grassy malts, caramel, molasses and some earthy, leafy/green hops. Very malty body, with flavors of caramel and earthy/grassy malts, hints of chocolate and toffee, tart wheat and a mild, clean bitterness. It has a medium, lightly-carbonated body that delivers a staying maltiness while becoming ever crisper and dryer. An interesting brew that is hard to define - wouldn't really peg it as a strong ale, but not really sure what else to call it. While not my favorite from BBC, it is fairly tasty and quite drinkable for a beer with an above-average ABV.","mmmbeer","May 14, 2008"

The sweet, toasted malt character of the beer is enhanced by hidden flavors of dark fruit. One can draw similarities between this style and the belgian strong ales. I believe that the American Strong Ale is a slightly subdued version. For beer drinkers that want a local favorite, give River Ale a try!
