"deep amber color, almost no head.  bright raisin and sugar nose.  taste is a lightly sour, dark ""fruit juice"" mixture, likely attributed to the pomegranate.  if there were hops in this beer, it would taste like an american wild ale/sour beer.  interesting to try, but probably will not be a regular."
"Just not to my pallet. I found it to be sour. With such beautiful ingredients listed, I didn't feel as it did any of them justice, just a mush of flavors."

"Overall – 87.3 (Great): The label grabbed my attention from the start – ancient script writing in the style of my ancestors. Dogfish Head infuses their beer with almost anything that they can get their hands onto, and this particular offering is no different. The upside to the beverage is that it tastes almost akin to a juice or wine – very smooth and fruity with a distinct smell. However, the taste is lacking considering what I expected, and given the variations of ingredients that they added to the beer, perhaps eliminating one or two to have a more concise impression would be appreciated. Interesting to try and would certainly recommend sipping on it if available locally, but not something that I would ever come back to."

"Pretty good, not what I expected, with a decent tang to it"

"O - A decent spiced beer, different than your typical brew.  I picked one up on clearance, but at full price I'm unlikely to grab one again.  An interesting experience nevertheless."
""
""
""
""
"I could have passed on this one."
"V - Low value, almost 17 dollars for a single 22oz bomber."
"Overall, I am happy with this beer, though it has a slightly strange taste. But I love trying novel things, and loving getting to connect with history through DFH's Ancient Ale series. Overall this was a positive experience."
""
"Very good, but not worth the extremely high price.  Would not pay that much ($17 bottle) again."

"Pours copper with head that dissipates quickly. Very unique and well worth a try."

"Taste is lightly sweet, herb, honey with lively, engaging feel."
""
""
""
""
"Dark amber in color with a short head that breaks down quickly. The aroma is mostly wheat and fruit sweetness. Wheat flaovr is strong with some honey sweetness, dark fruit sweetness, and a moderate bitterness. Lightly crisp throughout with dryness late. A slower sipping beer and one glass is enough in a session."

"Worst beer I've ever tasted"
""
""
""
"Poured a dark brownish with a fizzy head. Smells earthy and the taste matches up with it. Very carbonated. Reminds me almost of a wine. Cannot put my finger on all of the different spices. Nothing is super distinct. I like the overall taste though. Would come back to it again."

"Doesn't really taste like most of the listed ingredients, but very good regardless. Paired with curry and pork."
""
""
""
"Overall - I generally do not like Dogfish Head's ancient beers, but I like this one. It does not match the description on the bottle, but I like it."
""
""
"Draft: Poured a light amber color ale with a medium size foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of hazelnut and unrefined grain is more or less interesting.  Taste is also dominated by unrefined grain with some strong notes of hazelnut with some residual sugars which is probably derived of the honey that was added to this beer. Body is light with medium carbonation and with no apparent alcohol. I appreciate all the historical research that went into this beer but not sure I really enjoy the final product enough to try this one again."

"Overall / Drinkability: A very unique beer. I've never had a beer like this - but that's the point isn't it? If this is what the Etruscans were drinking (roughly) over 2800 years ago...then count me in for enjoying a cup from time to time. I picked up a bottle because the price was right (on sale - $5.99) and aged over a year it's still quite good. It paired very well with food (Chicken Paillard with curry gravy and red lettuce salad) and as a very fruity beer, I think it might go well with a variety of other foods as well. So for drinkability, I never got tired of the large glass I poured for myself and the alcohol is dangerously well hidden. Overall, an unique experience and worth a try. I might actually pick up a bottle again if the price is right. Not an amazing beer, but it has its charm."
""
""
""
"The appearance was orange with some darker hues through it. The smell was full of earthy nutty notes but almost a pinot noir smell to it as well. The taste wasn't for me though with a lot of raisin and fruit flavors where I was hoping for more of the hazelnut and more heavy flavors. Still an interesting beer and it should be tried, but I don't see myself buying another."

"Taste- Interesting and unique. Starts mildly fruity with light sweetness yet in the late middle turns slightly sour finishing with an earthy lingering mild floral note. The 8.5% ABV is well masked. Another quality brew from DFH."

"DogFishHead EtRusCa This 'Ancient Ale' has had some serious research put into it! Brewer's, Dr.'s and Scientist's alike did some research and did their best to recreate an alcoholic beverage from 800 B!C!!! It's an interesting story. I encourage you to peep it on the inter webs~ Pours Amber/Copper/Orangeish in color, reminiscent of a juice~ Nose is of Pepper, Flowers and Green Onions, rather odd~Medium Body, equal parts tart and bitter~ Taste is by far the most Unique I ever had~ Right away it tastes like Patchouli! And Masa (Tamale) with over lays of Pomegranate, Raisin, Honey, Sweet/Dark Fruits, and honestly, some Flavors I just flat out can't put my thumb on (or never had.... It's pretty unique) This is a bit of a Novelty/Gimmick brew, that said its also genuinely educational~ I recommend everyone try it! Overall: 7.2"

"Copper brown in color with vibrant carbonation and great clarity. The head vanished immediately. I smell honey and plenty of amber malt. There's a sweetness from the honey and the amber malt that is very prevalent upon tasting. There's an intense peppery earthiness from the spices. It's aggressively carbonated but has a dry,crisp finish."

"O: I found this beer to be rather easy to drink and had a good balance among all of the different ingredients as neither of them seemed to be overpowering. This beer could pair well with food but is also interesting enough to drink on its own."

"Overall: For a gruit/herbed beer, this was pretty tasty and easy to drink. Very enjoyable."
"Pours reddish, amber with a pearl white, thin head. Some lacing. Has a pretty great smell, complex. Definitely lots of honey and pomegranate, banana, yeast and some fruit funk. Taste is along the same line with some citrus and pepper. Can't really pick out much hazelnut, which I was kind of hoping for. Feel is light and crisp, works well with the citrus and mild sour flavors. Moderate to high carbonation. Overall, a great trip off the beaten path. Some new flavors that you don't see much and I applaud DFH as always for trying new things. One of my favorite parts of these beers is reading the story of their inception and history, and this one has some great flavors to go with it."

"O- very interesting ancient ale, tons of flavor, very complex, slightly medicinal and funky. Not bad, would def go for another pint."

"O - Interesting aromas and flavors. Lack of carbonation and head detract from an otherwise very appealing beer."
"overall - unique and interesting, but one's enough for me."

"On the fuller end of medium body with a surprising amount of carbonation considering how quickly it went flat even with an aggressive pour. Tastes very similar to the notes of the aroma with an even stronger vinous dark fruit presence than expected. Some earthy, musty funk along with strong peppery spice. Again, I'm guessing the myrrh is really standing out with an earthy, resinous flavor along with some peppery clove and cardamom. The pomegranate raisin and other dark fruit flavors stand out throughout the palate but are most prominent toward the back end, lingering long after the finish. The pomegranate and raisin sweetness is very prominent along with grape, dark cherry, currant and other dark berries. Kind of reminds me of a prunier barbera wine with strong peppery spice and slightly tart, musty funk. Overall, not the most flavorful beer but more interesting than some of the other ancient ales. I wouldn't order or buy it again but I enjoyed trying it."
"Just by the copper appearance and sweet notes on the nose I thought this beer was going to be another interesting find from DFH. Unfortunately this is out of bounds for my liking as the pomegranate, raisin, tart profile is extremely sweet for me and not something I would drink again."
""
""
""
""
""

"Body is really pretty light considering the fairly ample alcohol content and full flavor. Drinks way too easy. Always luv DFH ales."

"Appearance is a light amber color with moderate head that doesn't stick around too long. The smell is very aromatic and, much like the taste, is kind of dry, if that makes any sense at all. There's a lot going on on the palette when you take a drink; some carbonation, overall pleasant. The taste is where this gets interesting. I've read some reviews that it's just a mish-mash of many different things; and while that is kind of the case, it works well for me. The two things in particular that stick out for me are; dry and pomegranate. The dry finish is what reminds me of a nice red wine, so maybe that falls more under mouth-feel, but nonetheless...overall, I wish they brewed more of it; one of my favorite all-time DFH brews."
""
""
""
"Birra Estrusca is a medium-bodied beer with a lively carbonation. There's a lot of flavors going on, but they work together nicely to make this a fairly drinkable beer."

""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This beer is just an empty attempt to create something unique. Bland flavors meshed in something that is passable at best."
""
""
"Overall: Contrary to the generally mediocre reviews of this beer, I find it wonderful. Normally i don't go for beers in dfh's massive cache of spiced ales but this one is worth trying."
""
""
""
""
"O: Overall I thought the beer was interesting, but it's not something I would ever buy again. It's seemed interesting so I bought it, but I can't say I'm a fan. It reminds me of what an exotic perfume would taste like...I say taste because this doesn't have much scent to it."
""
""
""
""
""
"O- A fun beer to try and to taste. It's not one I could see myself sitting down and drinking a bunch of, but I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of other more obscure Dogfish brews, especially their ancient ales and grapey beers. It will take me a little while to drink, so I'm glad I recently got the bottle opener/sealer to keep this fresh and sudsy."
""
""
""
""
"OVERALL: A good beer, definitely a hit rather than miss. Good fruit flavor, nice spice. For a spiced fruit beer, it's very good."
""
""
"The body manages a medium fullness. It develops a nice creaminess into a somewhat drier, mildly spicy finish."
"Mouthfeel is smooth and effervescent. Overall, within the realm of spiced off-the-wall beers, this is pretty good."

"750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in late 2012. Pours slightly hazy orange copper color with a 1 finger foamy light khaki head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap. Minimal glass lacing and a ton of streaming carbonation that keeps the lace cap going. Aromas of apple, pear, raisin, banana, pomegranate, pepper, clove, bubblegum, honey, candi sugar, wheat, bread, floral, herbal, and earthy yeast spiciness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruitiness with malt and spicy yeast esters. Taste of apple, pear, raisin, banana, pomegranate, pepper, clove, bubblegum, wheat, bread, honey, candi sugar, floral, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Lingering notes of light and dark fruits, clove, pepper, bubblegum, honey, floral, herbal, wheat, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of fruity flavors with malt and yeast esters; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slick, lightly syrupy, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with nearly zero warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an excellent excellent ancient ale collaboration. All around nice balance and complexity of malt, fruitiness, and spicy ester flavors; and very smooth to sip on. Really enjoyed this one, as expected."

"Overall: These droll historical renditions peak my interest every time and always make for a ripping good time. Chateau Jiahu was mighty fun. Didn’t we have one hell of a time with Midas Touch? I know, deep down, a bottle of Theobroma would be the jewel in any serious beer drinker's cellar. Now,"

"Big Bottled Birra Etrusca Bronze, a ruby brown tinted glowing clear body builds up a nice egg shell white foam head as I pour into my Tripel Karmeliet chalice, fine layered thin streaks of lacing settle to the sides. Aroma has an upfront tart raisin character with pomegranate, nutty earthy tones with a sweet floral honey aspect to it. Pretty awesome historical beers brought back to life with Dogfish Head, Baladin, and Birra del Borgo. It smells like pomegranate honey infused jam on a thick crusted artisan bread, hints of spice are flowing as well. Flavor is upfront sweet and malty with extra sugar additions adding to the flow of sweetness, no real bittering hops that are mentioned on the label, so I'm guessing the earthiness from the Myrrh and Gentian root added to the mix of help balance this one out. Sweet and tart qualities arise from the juicy plump raisin to the tart pomegranates. Definitely a vinous wine like quality even the way the warmth of the 8.5% alcohol hits the gut and the palate, very complex and interesting beer that actually works together quite nicely. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied lighter carbonation than expected working toward the advantage of a pretty drinkable beer. Overall impression is that I like it and I'm glad that the three brewers with the help of a biomolecular archaeologist can put something like this back together from actual ingredients found before vino arrived in Italia."
"O - I love the tartness in it, but the overdone spices & slight cloying aspect to this beer is over the top."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, fruit, spice, and herb aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour fruit and herbal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with some interesting aromas and flavors."
"not one of my favorite dfh ales, but also not terrible. it's always a good thing to at least try each beer they make once you never know how pleased a strange beer like some of these ancient ales, will make you."
"O: Earthy, fruity, perhaps too sweet for some, Etrusca is interesting. The hazelnut flour is very noticeable in the finish along with pomegranate seeds. Worth a try, though I do not know if I would buy again considering the high price."
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Interesting and spicy, but a bit of a disappointment. I think this one would make an excellent Christmas ale, but like many Christmas ales, I prefer them in 12 ounce servings, but whole bombers. I was also hoping for a bit more pomegranate and hazelnut flavors, both of which are hidden behind the spiciness. Glad I tried this, but once is good by me."
"O: an interesting beer. very complex and interesting flavors. tastes to be a bit of a mess but it's somewhat balanced. definitely off centered so I shouldn't be too surprised but it might be a bit too off centered for many."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall – A very interesting brew. It has an odd mix of flavors, which in the end work out rather well together. I would say this is one that is worth a try as it is quite unique and complex, but yet still very tasty and drinkable."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Kind of what I expected it to be, another ancient ale that I don't really care for."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Just another one of those silly ancient ales. Much, much better than the travesty that was Ta Drainpour, but this is still not a great beer. I might be tired of the beer history lessons because I've yet to have one of these beers that warrants a repeat purchase. Decent enough beer, but just wildly confusing in all aspects."
""
""
"Overall this isn't bad but it has way too many things going on for my palate. Good to try once but would not visit it again."
"Overall: Definitely a different type of beer, taste alone reminds you maybe something from Belgium. This brew i will mind you is not for everyone, you have to have an open mind to appreciate it for what it is. Salud!"
""
"It has an aftertaste I can't put my finger on. I've had every ancient ale except Ta Hanket (zero interest in that one really) and this ranks probably the low middle of the spectrum of those releases. It isn't necessarily bad, just not necessarily great."
""
""
"I am glad I only tried a small snifter, and did not pony up for the ridiculous bomber. An absolute mess, and I have a hard time believing this has any resemblance to any ""ancient ale."" Just a waist."
""
"This brew blurs the “beer” expectation considerably, and although the DFH ancient ales haven't been my favorite things from them, I will definitely try each new one when it's released. I appreciate the efforts and the history. Cheers!"
"D - Definitely interesting and unique... Not remotely like any other beers I've encountered... I certainly enjoyed this one well enough, but I'm not quite sure it is something that I would seek out again or drink with regularity... I would recommend for those seeking out an experience and not afraid of tying truly unique brews..."

"O-Another interesting beer from DFH. Nothing great but I'm glad they make the Ancient Ales."
""
""
""
""
"O: It's the best of both wine and beer in one bottle, hands down. This is a great beer to taste on your own and I bet this would spark a lively debate during a tasting. Dogfish nailed it with this beer, I could easily drink this all the time, I hope this becomes a regular DFH brew."
""
""
""
""
"Interestingly enough, in the world of beer, wine, and liquor there's not much that reminds me of this as much as Dogfish Head's ""Midas Touch"" (which is, of course, the first beer that they did with Dr. Pat). There may be some beers that come close, and perhaps there's a bit of a dry red wine to it, but nothing springs to mind. And I liked the ""Midas Touch", but I think I like ""Birra Etrusca"" better. It's lighter in body, less sweet, and softer in character. The alcohol is not as apparent, and overall, it's a much more rounded and polished beer. I thought it looked good, it smelled good, it tasted good, and it was nice in the mouth with the body of a rich wine. I'd very much like to enjoy it again. And I also think it would be a very interesting beer to pair against food."
"Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a tulip glass, 2012 version. This pours a reddish brown color with a two finger white head. The smells are of pomegranate, honey, ginger, raisins, mostly sweet very little hops. The feel is medium, mostly sweet, honey, juice a little noticeable alcohol very mild hops."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a golden amber, moderate froth, quickly gone. Scent brings big floral notes, flowery honey, light herbal quality, some bready yeastyness and spice, sugar and fruit. Taste has a lot going on as well... strong floral, honey, grape notes, moderate sugar, herbal, spice notes, rounded out with a grainy and bready profile. Medium bodied, some prickly carbonation. Overall, impressed with the uniqueness and drinkability of this one, only thing to question is value."
""
""
""
"O: Overall, quite tasty. I would definitely have this again. Some of flavors are a little muted, but otherwise very enjoyable."
""
"Birra Etrusca is nothing short of interesting. In terms of beer, it’s alright. Not bad. I do think the mix of sweet and floral flavors is just okay. More body or bubbles would help too. I’m not particular on which. It’s interesting, worth checking out. It’s another in Dogfish’s growing line of trailblazing beers."
""
""
"Carbonation is strong. The beer is very smooth throughout, but that carbonation leaves a bite on your tongue. Lightly coats the throat and back of the tongue. I would call it light-medium bodied."
""
""
""
"750ml bottle purchased at Tully's in Wells. Pours a fairly clear copper with nearly an inch of khaki colored head. Smells crazy - fruity, spicy... Liquoice and root beer notes. Spicy and fruity. Pomegranate, cherry, anise. Medium in body and carbonation. Pretty good. Interesting. Unique."
""
""
"O: my least favorite in their ancient ales series - too fruit juicy for my tastes - I appreciate the energy and innovation, but this is not something I'd return to."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, an interesting beer and glad I tried it to see what some historical ales tasted like but it was too sweet and just didn't grab me. Avail here in TX. Rotation - one is enough."
""
"Copper/bronze body, offwhite head that doesn't retain or lace. Nose has toasty breads, grains, herbal, honey and pomegranate are prominent as well. Taste is composed of pomegranate, herbals notes, grains, toasty and nutty character. Medium full palate, low carbonation. Sweet, and pomegranate lingers."
"Time to pop a new Dogfish 750 ... time for things to get weird. Birra Etrusca pours out a copper color with a finger of persistent head. The aroma is sweet, floral, fruity, yeasty, and malty. There's a lot going on with the nose, and it's hard to figure it out until you take a sip. And even then, it's not easy, as an initial strong spiced floral apple gives way to a more bitter pomegranate along with some other vinous sweet fruit flavors. Some honey sweetness makes it's presence known as well, along with some Belgian yeasts. As the beer approaches room-temperature, the yeast and floral aspects begin to dominate. Quite a lot going on here, but it's tasty. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a moderate carbonation level, and the drinkability is solid enough. Overall, another interesting big bottle from Dogfish Head."
""
""
" Overall, if the price dropped I'd be more likely to drink this more often, but as of now I'll enjoy it as a celebratory beverage."
""
"Overall: This is...interesting. It's heavy on the apple and Belgian characteristics which I was not expecting based on the description. It's not bad, but it's definitely nothing special. Unless you're a big DFH fan, I'd probably recommend skipping this one, especially given the price."
""
"Draught @ Birreria: This one was served in an interesting stem glass. It poured a clear, amber color. There was a small dense off-white head that left no lacing. It has an interesting nose: a nice spice that must be the myrrh. I also get a whiff of the pomegranate. It has a very nice taste. Spice, a hint of the pomegranate, and some wheat in the body. Somewhat dry, with a faint fruit sweetness in the finish. Really interesting!"
""
""
""
""
"Etrusca reminds me of Midas' Touch, but with more complex dryness, herbal, mead-like touches. Its heavy wine tilt creates a lot of allure, but also becomes challenging to the taste buds."
"I honestly can't decide if I like this beer or not. Some sips were okay. Others were very mediocre. It's definitely unique, and overall - it wasn't bad.... Well, at times it wasn't. I don't know, honestly. It just bounces around the walls a little bit too much. Not really worth the price in my opinion, either."
""
""
"O: I enjoy the initiative DFH is taking with their ancient ales. Each is quite unique & while there are certainly hits and misses, this is one of the more enjoyable creations."
"O: Interesting beer, wish I were more familiar with the ingredients and the flavors in general. It's very unique and certainly an interesting experiment. I give DFH credit for making this palatable, it's unlike any modern beer that's for sure."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Thanks, Jon. Middiling mouthfeel, honey booss smoothness. Like a herbal tea with carbonation."
"O: An interesting and decent beer overall. Not bad or particularly offensive by any means, but this is definitely a unique beer with a many aromas and flavors that I can't really name. Still, it is enjoyable and more successful than some of their other Ancient Ales series."
"On tap at Kickbacks in Jax. Poured into a snifter. White head, moderate retention on a clear copper body. Mostly clear lacing. Very perfumy aroma includes caramel malts, candi sugar, a Belgian-y type of yeast like aroma, some sweet fruits (undistinguishable) and maybe some alcohol...quite interesting. Taste includes again some sweet malts, some interesting spicing and again some sweet fruity like taste. The flavors are really hard to pinpoint and they certainly mix together to form a flavor that I'm quite sure has never been tasted before. Quite nice, I enjoy the aroma more than the taste but very ambitious and typical Dogfish Head awesomeness."
""
"Truly strange but quite sippable. It grows on you, and the bitterness comes to be more intriguing than the usual hops. From the 750 ml bottle bought at Whole Foods in San Francisco."
"O: Yet another very interesting beer from DFH. Definitely has an Italian swing on things from the guys over at BdB and Baladin. Not the easiest aroma or taste to explain in review format, so I suggest going and trying some for yourself. It's unlike almost any beer I've tried, and for that reason alone, it's worth picking it up"
"The Dogfish ""ancient ales"" tend to be one-note and unimpressive to me, but I really enjoyed this one. Usually these beers are a one-time taste/tick, but this one I would drink again."
""
""
""
"Beer is vinous and sweet with a woody / pencil shaving aftertaste that is a pretty off putting. I won't have this again."
""
""
"O - Not sure how I feel about this one. Ok, but I wouldn't seek it out again."
"O- I liked this overall, I think it's a bit on the sweet side but if you use it as a dessert beer it would fit nicely, would recommend, props to DFH for continuing to explore more of these ancient recipes"
""
""
"This puppy has plenty of flavors going on - pretty fun, and makes for a nice holiday ale. Wouldn't mind giving it a go again next year, but no way I'm paying $18 for it again."
"O: Pretty good and different. I would probably pick this up again if I came across it."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear, reddish amber color with a medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is different than any other beer my nose has stubbled upon. Immediately, I get the sense that this beer has wheat in it. Wheat-like aroma with dark fruits...raisins and prunes. I also get red grapes and the green apple comes through very nicely in the end of the aroma. Sweet honey with some ginger and cinnamon. I don't really pick up any pomegranate in the nose. Belgian yeast...with wine-like aromas. Taste is just as it smells, but a bit more vinous. This beer has some lovely wine characteristics with the grape flavors. Belgian yeast with tart red grapes and tart green apple flavors. There are tart flavors, but the beer is not tart overall. The raisiny dark fruit flavors mellow out the tartness. Honey flavors with a pomegranate juice-like finish. Such a complex beer. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and juicy at the same time. Just a little sticky. Drinkability is high, ABV is definitely there, but doesn't affect drinkability. Overall, this is a very complex, unique, tasty brew from DFH. I love BDB, so I'm sure they had a lot of influence on this one."
"Overall a complex, layered, and interesting brew. Definitely something off the beaten path and well worth a try."

"O - An extremely drinkable, flavorful rendition of an Italian ancient ale. Complex and balanced. The alcohol is masked very well."

"Pours a two finger white head that vanishes leaving no lace. Crystal clear amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Honey and gentian root nose. Flavor has a lot going on - at least honey, gentian root - reminds me of juniper, higher ABV is hidden. Pricey as usual for DFH at $14.00 for a 750ml bottle from Tully's Beer and Wine Wells, ME."
"O-Very interesting brew. Pretty unique so there isn't much to compare it to. I think the price is a bit high but definitely worth trying"

"Smooth and warming, medium-full body with light effervescence. Pretty good but not memorable. Not one of DFH's better offerings."
"O- very interesting ancient ale, tons of flavor, very complex, slightly medicinal and funky. Not bad, would def go for another pint."

"Served in a DFH goblet, brew pours a beautiful clear burning copper under a creamy thin layer of foam. Aroma isn't shy at all and seems abundant with various hints of earthy, herbal, pungent and citrusy ingredients to the concoction...Flavors on the palate are equally as complex with notes that I can best decipher as a dominating sweet and tart blend of fruit. Fun beer for a tasting party and something different from the usual for the craft brew lover and wine snob alike..."
""
"Initially a 3 finger head which dissipated rapidly with little lacing on a clear copper body. Aroma is dominated by pomegranate with grape, red apple and some generic spice. Flavor also has a lot of similar flavors with pomegranate again dominating with red apple and grapes also again noted. Additional notes include pine resin, honey and herbs. Medium body, fairly oily on the palate and moderate carbonation. Initially this one seemed complex but eventually it became more like a tart fruit juice. Certainly drinkable, almost too sweet. As with the other ancient ales, this one is worth a try."

"Poured into a Dogfish Head pint glass. Pours a medium copper (bronze?!?) amber with a thin off-white head that dissipated quickly to a ring around the glass. Enticing aroma of honey, apple, stone fruits, root beer spices. Complex flavor that is hard to differentiate, but nice fruit, cherry, light wheat, bittering herbs, woody, both sour and sweet elements. Finishes dryer with residual sweet/sour fruit elements at the back of the tongue. Light to medium bodied, but good mouth feel from active carbonation. Definitely unusual and fun to drink. I have a suspicion that bronze age libations would actually be hard to take for modern tastes, but if they had anything like this, they were very lucky."
""
""
"Overall, this is surprisingly palatable beer, and perhaps my favorite of Dogfish Head’s Ancient Ale series. This one is very much like a Belgian in many aspects, with Flemish and Saison flavors coming through as well. I did wish for a heavier mouthfeel and much less carbonation, but the fruit-spice notes were excellent, and delicious. If this tastes anything like what the ancient Etruscans actually drank, then I certainly know where I’ll be heading once I get my time travel machine up and running."

"Pours a deep amber brown with a hint of ruby color. Good 1-2 finger head at pour that after relaxing remains a thin layer on top of the beer. This beer looks alive as it continues to bubble from the bottom of the glass (and retain the layer of head on top). Smell is sweet yet sour. Taste also leads down a slight sour path - unexpected - but then again the presense of the pomegranate juice and fruit help this along. Sweetness from honey present. Sweet and sour mix together from front to back."
"O-This is one of those weird Dogfish experiments that gets it right. i think every time i take a sip, i get a new flavor, and they're all flavors i enjoy and find to be a nice surprise in beer. It's just a super enjoyable and fun beer to drink. Please go out and try this and share this!"

"I love the concept of brewing ancient ales. I am inspired by the innate 'coolness' of the project and the difficulty of finding ingredients and working on the process. However, I also find it very hard to review these experimental beers, mostly because ther is little to compare them to. This beer is a coppery color...very clear, with a quickly disappearing head. Low carbonation. The smel is interesting. Fruit and spice. I didn't pick up an much honey as I expected, but ther is a graininess and a white pepper-like cent. The taste has more fruit than the smell...almost like grape juice. Thinner in body than I thought it would be. Interesting, and drinkable. It's not an everyday beer, though."

"O - Overall this was a waste of money. Absolutely awful. I like some of DFH's Ancient Ales but this is not one of them. Not even close."
"Pretty interesting flavors. Glad I found it on-tap to avoid the big bottle. I like this Ancient Ale, but a second pour might prove difficult."
"ill always like these archeological beers for what they are, but this one was a little strange. apparently predating wine in italy, this beer is a mishmosh of spices and heritage grains that come together in a very unique brew. the pour is fairly clear copper color, maybe a slight redish or purpley tint, with an inch of fading tan foam. the nose is tart, almost sour for a second, with lots of fruit and booze. almost winelike, sort of grapey and tannic. the flavor is also a little fruity. some radically unfamilar malts are in here, not sure what they are, but they are totally new to me. the alcohol is also not covered up to well, and is quite lethal when warm. a funny sort of aftertaste, moderately spiced, but that isnt whats throwing me off. a really hard beer to explain meaningfully because it is one of a kind in so many ways. more fruity than hoppy though, and largely unexplained or accounted for. still, nice medium body and a little flat on the carbonation. glad i dropped the scratch for this beer, as dogfish head always offers something worthwhile, but i have little desire to try this again."

"Poured from a bottle into a Lodgson goblet. Crystal clear bronzed amber color with a small white head, fizzy but well-retaining, minimal lacing. Herbal aroma, somewhat fruity, actually reminded me a lot of Pez, but in a pleasant way. Taste was a bit grainy, toasty, nutty, with caramel malts and a touch of honey sweetness, bittering pomegranate essence, herbal hops. Kind of similar to Chateau Jiahu, I thought. medium body, fairly dry and woody, lighter carbonation, generally drinkable, but I was definitely glad to have a few people to split the bomber with. The recipe is interesting, and I give general overall points for originality and effort, but unfortunately I don't think this really brings anything new to the table."

"O- The DFH ancient ales are always something different and are impossible to compare to other beers. This one has a mix of unique flavors that work pretty well together. Worth a try."
"750 ml bottle. Served in a DFH Signature Glass, the beer pours a clear reddish/amber color with about an inch off-white head. Head retention is good, and there's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is herbal and fruity, the brew smells like pomegranates, grapes, honey, and some peppery spice and herbs. It tastes like grapes/grape skins, honey, pomegranates, herbs, and grainy malt. The fruity taste gets somewhat tart after the brew warms up some. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's smooth and a bit slick with good carbonation. I liked this brew, it's certainly worth a try. $11.99 a bottle."
"Overall, this one isn't too bad but a little goes a long way. 750mls is way more than necessary. Dang, this really grows tiresome after a while."
"QUITE GOOD; INTRIGUING TREAT!"

"Overall this is just a good fun romp, and quite a neat one not unlike Noble Rot. The missing link perhaps between beer and wine? Maybe maybe not, but certainly a lot of fun to be had. Tough to food pair this one though, Sam suggests pasta, but I am just not convinced on that one."
"Flavor is much like the nose but with a lot of tart Apple flavor. Big creamy body Belgian candi flavors, just enough carbonation. Funky with a tart and herbal finish. Really good, I like it."
""
"Smells like raisins and tastes like honey. Pomegranate actually lingers--I thought the pom would be difficult to find. It's like Midas touch mixed with chateau jiahu. The figgish raisin nose is actually a little reminiscent of Raisond'etre. I don't know how to discern all the components described on the label, but I can't help but detect a pestle-and-mortar-like kind of feel. It makes me picture the chica people spitting in that beer on Dicovery Channel. It's like all the DFH Ancient Ales are flashing before my eyes! It's a murky dark raisin look with a similar smell, coupled with a dark-sweet/honey smooth/elixir-type vibe. I picked this one in part to combat the crud 'round here lately. It fits the bill for what it is, which I'll respectfully leave at that."

"O: The ancient ale series isn't one that I've always been a fan of. Some are great, others are forgettable at best. I think Birra Etrusca is one of the better brews. It's not so out there that it doesn't taste like beer and the complex flavors it brings to the glass are interesting to say the least. This would be a fun beer to sample and dissect with beer geek friends, as the subtle flavors may lead to a wide range of interpretations."
"Transparent copper color with white bubbly head that fades. Aroma of wheat, dark candi sugar, dark honey, booze, apple skins, herbal notes, black cherry liqueur. Tastes of buckwheat, dark honey, apple skins, herbal liquids, black cherry, hazelnut sweetness, and tree resin. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Slick, resiny, oily that coats the palate. Pretty good for the complexity of the ingredients."
""
"Very interesting take on an ancient recipe. I give them kudos for once again going against the grain and creating something unique."
""
"This poured out as a clear looking brownish copper color (Bronze). The beer his a fizzy white head on top that leaves a moderate amount of lacing and some scattered retention on top. The sample I was given at the brewery was mis-labeled. We were told it was this beer but it was actually Theobroma. While at the Brewpub I ordered it again just to make sure and I was right that the guys giving the tour had the list mixed up. So anyway, the beer gives off some spicy herbal notes on the nose along with some sweetness from the honey and malt. The taste of the beer has an interesting mix of flavors ranging from moderate sweet herbal notes to some dry spices in the finish. The mouthfeel was pretty typical for what DfH puts out, it's lighter bodied and drinkable with a subtle carbonation to it. Overall it's a pretty good brew, not my favorite of the Ancient Ales but still not bad."
""
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall, it was a drinkable beer but not one I'd buy again. The grape and apple juice component was interesting and not bad tasting. I thought it actually came together relatively well for all the strange ingredients in it. It felt about as well balanced as it probably could be as well. As interesting and unique as it was, it just wasn't that good overall. Like most Dogfish Ancient Ale experiments, I finished it thinking that wad unique and interesting but I wouldn't want another."
