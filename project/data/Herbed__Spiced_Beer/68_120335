The Old Bay flavor is not nearly as intense as I thought it would be. And perhaps that is a good thing. On its own, it is a decent beer. When paired with seafood, it is on a different level. This is a beer that is definitely meant to be paired rather than consumed on its own. I would love to drink this beer on draft at an MD crab house feasting on some blue crabs where this beer would truly shine. Definitely worth a try and would have again with the right food pairing.","JCH3191","Nov 23, 2014"

The hops balance extremely well with the spices.  This beer has a flavor quite reminiscent of Old Bay while still being thoroughly drinkable (and at 5.6%, it's not *too* far from a session beer).  And, it benefits Maryland's blue crabs - a bonus to those of us in the area.  If you like spiced beers like witbiers and are willing to go a bit stronger with the spices, definitely give this one a try.","foxandcrown","Oct 03, 2014"

Color was a pretty Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 - 5) with NE-plus quality clarity. I could see into the future! I could NOT keep my nose out of the glass with this one. This would be fabulous with actual crabs. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but if it is intended as a Summer Ale, I would not want it to be too full. The taste was of Old Bay (r), but in just the right amount, not overwhelming, which it could have been. How do you describe an "Ale Brewed with Spices" when the spices are so variegated? You almost have to have experienced Old Bay (r) seasoning for yourself at some point in order to understand. One point that really needs to be made is its finish. Just like any other beer that relies heavily on spice(s) for its flavor, this was as dry as the desert! This just begs to be drank with some food, especially seafood.

The beer itself seems to be pretty good, hard to tell with the spice. On the good side, if you are an Old Bay fan, this is the best. The Old Bay flavor is just right and not too overpowering. Head and color are better than average and this beer would be awesome on a summer day, nice and cold, while sitting on the beach or pickin' crabs, lol","hophugger","Aug 09, 2014"

Its rich, complex, and a layered wonderfully. The appearance of it is pretty standard with a deep gold color and a medium bodied head. When I took my first smell I was hit with the Old Bay seasoning right away. It was buttery and sweet with a good kick of Old Bay at the end. Nothing too overpowering which I was relieved by. I was also very surprised by how well it tasted! All the flavors blended together wonderfully and gave the beer a great layered experience. First, you get a sweet buttery flavor quickly followed by a smooth tone of Old Bay to season it off. Its really almost the full experience of eating Maryland blue crabs! I'm sure MD locals know what I'm talking about! I'm very pleasantly surprised with this one! I was afraid the Old Bay would be too strong and overpower the beer but it all worked out wonderfully.","AyeMito","Jun 24, 2014"

Overall, not wowed and not feeling bad about trying this, it's just making me want to get some all you can eat crab legs.","WVbeergeek","Jun 09, 2014"

It was literally released a few weeks ago and my bottles were very fresh. An excellent ale would go great with a crab feast. The old bay taste is mild, but excellent. Might become my summer go to beer. I highly recommend. It's a winner.","Seanem44","May 26, 2014"

They absolutely nailed the right amount of citrus and old bay character on this. It's a perfect seafood beer, and something like this could only be made in Maryland. Old Bay spice is something you either like it or you don't, and I am drooling over this. This brewery is going to easily sell a LOT of this beer, in fact I even saw people walking out with CASES of this stuff. Truly the perfect beer with crabs, and this also drinks well on it's own. If you want a spiced up blonde with dry salty action, look no further. But be warned it's not for everyone, but this makes me proud to be living in Maryland.","smakawhat","May 20, 2014"

5,38.9,5,5,5,5,5,"Basically skeptical that this was pure marketing hipster-fodder; the brew doesn't fuck around. Promises Old Bay and delivers better than ever expected.

It runs smooth with a swoosh of a nice slightly hoppy taste with a smooth slight taste of old bay that is perfect. The aftertaste furthers the experience as well. I hope it survives the summer seasonal phase, but pick it up while you can!","Baltimorean_Brew","May 14, 2014"

I hope Flying Dog releases this every summer as I could see it being a great beer for seafood and chicken dishes that I find myself enjoying over the summer months. Can't wait to have a crab feast with a six pack of this.","Titans77","May 14, 2014"
