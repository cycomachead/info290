2.64,-14,2,3,3,2,2,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, End of the World is very lightly colored for a beer that advertises "midnight wheat and chocolate malt", it's amber-brown at best. The head is thin and non-active. Rather than a nice semi-liquid yeast at the bottom of a wheat beer that you can gently swirl in, this beer has large chunky particulate that takes forever but eventually settles to the bottom of the glass - not very appealing. The nose is unremarkable for a chili and spiced beer, wheat and weak chocolate malt notes is all I'm getting. The taste is a little more interesting with some spicy notes and chili flavors coming through; seems overly bitter as a side effect from the spices. Mouthfeel is thin and carbonation is minimal, chunky bits lose points. Overall a miss by AB on this one in my opinion.","gmfessen","Jan 14, 2014"

Overall, this isn't a TERRIBLE beer, but definitely just reminded me of a hybrid Shock Top. I probably won't have this beer again, mainly because it's a limited release. I guess the big breweries tried on this one, and it didn't go exactly as planned. Just took a popular, trending topic and made a beer out of it in an attempt to boost sales. I'll look elsewhere next time if they release a "Return of Jesus" beer. Cheers!","DMXLOX22","Jan 26, 2013"

Nose held some promise with notes of chocolate and some kind of spice. I do not know that I would have guessed "Chili", but there was a spiciness to the nose. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium and the flavors were very muted. Yes, I perceived both chocolate and spice, but nowhere near the level of yesterday's Theobroma or even Organic Chocolate.

The chocolate maltiness is nice, too, and overall this is a pretty snappy, tasty beer. I'm not all that familiar with the Shock Top Family... I mean, I know it's an Anheuser-Busch product... I just mean I haven't tried them all and this is the first one I've reviewed. Where was I? Oh yeah, so anyway, it's not bad. In fact, it's actually pretty good, especially if you remember to swirl the beer around a little in the bottle when there's about an inch left in it, before pouring it all into your glass. That not only gives you a little extra head, but it definitely helps bring out more of the spicy flavor in the wheat sediment at the bottom of the bottle. So yeah, I'd recommend it. Not extremely good or anything, but better than average, and definitely impressive for AB/InBev.","kopper65","Dec 20, 2012"

If you say there is midnight wheat, make it black as midnight...lame. The smell is not amazing but its definitely different. You can smell something going on in there but its hard to notice. Maybe the spices but not sure what those are...nutmeg? When it comes to the taste this beer is pretty good. Nothing outstanding but heck, it kind of burns from the peppers but in the flavor its hard to really determine what is going on. Kind of like the smell. It totally drinks stronger than the 6% abv on the bottle. I have had 10% beers easier to drink than this. There is a hint of dark malts but no hops of any from. The mouthfeel is very carbonated. It cleans away the flavor well to get ready for another sip. Overall, this is not that bad. is it worth a 6 pack? No. Was it worth a sample? Sure if you are into wheat beers. However I really think that the idea was a good one but at a macro level this beer kinda fades into the ether and I cannot see myself telling folks..hey that beer is a good one.

2.7,-12.1,3,3,2.5,3,2.5,"Pours a murky brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, wheat, and slight amounts of cocoa and spices. Taste is much the same with a mild roasty flavor on the finish. There is also a very mild chili heat in the back of the throat that quickly dies out. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer taste wise but the smell is decent enough.","UCLABrewN84","Nov 05, 2012"

2.08,-32.2,3,2.5,2,1,2,"Overall: A confused, mildly interesting tasting beer from the megabrewer Anheuser Busch, but far too watery to be considered a fine beer. Without some fullness or broader flavor it will be the End of the World for this brew.","Stinkypuss","Nov 05, 2012"

1.51,-50.8,3,2,1,2.5,1,"Had to do it. Pours cloudy tea colored with a etched surface of tan. Smells of wheat, coriander, cinnamon, some milky smells. Tastes like powdered cocoa, wheat, a bit of charcoal, some more coriander and a bit of fucking terrible. No, it's just terrible. Thin with hi carb and a dry finish. This is just really disappointing from such a reputable brewer.","harrymel","Nov 03, 2012"

2.35,-23.5,3,3,2,2.5,2,"Overall: A major disappointment given the interesting description of this beer. In different hands, I think a dark wheat beer with chocolate and chilis could be very promising.
