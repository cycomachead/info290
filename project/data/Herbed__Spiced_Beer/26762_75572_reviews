"Pours pitch black with finger width foamy head.  Head retention and lacing are both mild.  Strong black licorice aroma with mild cinnamon/nutmeg.  Mildly roasted taste with black licorice, cinnamon and nutmeg.  More of a licorice aftertaste.  Not a bad beer, but not something I would seek out to drink."
"Overall: A nice festive beer that is a bit one-dimensional.  If you enjoy christmas beers and  love holiday spices then this will be really enjoyable.  If you want complexity then this may not be for you."

"Pours dark brown with a strong aroma of allspice & toffee. It tastes of chocolate & bready caramel, with a finish of holiday spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc). Very smooth sipper thats not too over the top. Perfect way to cap off a day of battling against Black Bart!"

"Its not a bad beer by any means, but I was really let down by this offering, it looks great but beyond appearance it goes downhill after that."
"Spiced amber winter warmer. Nothing too special."

"Atmosphere is pretty good. Fair head which disappears quickly, spotty lacing. Fall spice and nuts make up the nose. Bitter and spicy. Cocoa nibs noted on the label are barely evident in the nose of flavor profile. Overall, this is a decent quaff."

"Overall I prefer the copper mug tasting, just don’t let the ale get too warm on you…"

"O: If you want a spiced stout tasting beer, this is the one for you. Would definitely have again."

"O: you want a spiced beer, here you go. if you don't, stay away -- this resembles what most of us think of as beer in the slimmest of ways"

"Overall not bad, an interesting beer overall, a bit too much on the spices and bitterness, especially as it gets tannic salty and a bit astringent on the finish, but otherwise a nice beer, I like the toasty biscuit brown malts, sweet flavors, ginger bread, light cocoa, etc, and a tasty beer overall. If this were barrel aged it would go to a whole other level I think."

"Got this in a trade with icetrauma, thanks man. 22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, but was bottled recently. Pours fairly clear extremely dark reddish brown color with a nice 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big caramel, chocolate, toffee, raisin, fig, toast, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, brown sugar, dark bread, light roast, and light herbal. Excellent aromas with great complexity, strength, and balance of malt/spice notes; very inviting. Taste of caramel, chocolate, toffee, raisin, fig, toast, dark bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, brown sugar, light roast, and herbal. Light spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, chocolate, dark fruit, toast, toffee, dark bread, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, light roast, and herbal on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice flavor balance, complexity, and robustness; with a great malt/spice balance; and minimal cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a creamy and fairly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with hardly any warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a highly excellent winter warmer style! Great balance and robustness of flavors and spices; and extremely smooth to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering."
"O: I had little expectations, and I am pleasantly surprised coming out of the glass. Strong flavors and very complex - overall a good first experience with Karbach."

"I would say it's better than anything ""big beer"" puts out, but there are so many great holiday/fall/winter beers out there. I wouldn't bother with this one again."

"This dark ale is brewed and sold for only a limited time, so consumers need to seek it out quickly while supplies last. The search will be worthwhile, as this is a complex and warming beer that makes a great choice for a cool winter day."
"If you like Winter Warmers you would be remiss to not track one of these down. If you don't and the issue is they usually are too spice heavy then you may like this bad boy. Also, one of the cooler *theme* I have seen out there. The BA version Fra Gee Lay is up next."
""
"Overall, I wouldn't seek the brew, but I'd have one if offered. Not very impressed by it."

"This is just awesome. I love it, and maybe the best Karback has to offer. Exactly what I would expect from a Winter Warmer. Very highly recommended."
"Is a good winter warmer, but doesn't stand out in a crowd."
"The flavor follows suit. I get a lot of cinnamon and caramel malt, as well as a little bit of nutmeg. There is also some nice raisin notes in the flavor, as well as some other dark fruit such as cherries. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
