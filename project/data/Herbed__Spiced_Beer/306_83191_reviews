"-- Thin, fizzy, and simple, with a metallic tang. There’s no need for 5.8% with this amount of flavor. But no OTT nutmeg, so nice enough. A satisfactory winter warmer. 3.5"

"Nice hints of caramel and spice, not overpowering"

"Overall, Im not impressed.  It is an ok beer but not one to write home about."

"TASTE: Pie spice, mild caramel maltiness, mild apple flavor, bready, very clean, hint of warming alcohol, grapenuts, semi-dry faded spice finish"

"This manages to be drinkable, but I wouldn't want to drink more than one at a sitting.  It could definitely use more apple flavor and less nutmeg.  Purchased as part of a variety 12 pack, and not nearly as good as the cinnamon horchata ale I just reviewed."

"kinda strange taste for a beer, but not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The Verdict: Not bad. A little different, a bit funky. I don't see myself ever ordering one, but it is drinkable. Kind of a variation on a pumpkin ale more than anything else."
""
""
""
""
""
"Decent. This offering has potential. But, in classic Blue Moon fashion, the aromas and flavors come across as watered down and underachieving."

"Overall (2.39) : A fail. I do not like this beer Sam, I am. The moldy appearance on the top after the head recedes is so off-putting, it's like I left iced tea in the den and forgot about it for 4 days. The flavor is awful, and the mouthfeel isn't far ahead of it. If they sold this in six pack bottles people would demand that this be taken off the market. I'm glad I only got two of these in my variety pack."
""
""
""
""
""
"There was an oddness to this flavor that I just couldn't place.  Slightly bitter, lacking something.  The spices overshadowed the usual pleasant warmth and fullness of the wheat.  I didn't taste any apple, only a hint at what should be caramel but came off more chemical in taste than treat.  Not a flavor I would choose intentionally, and coupled with the farmhouse red, it will probably keep me from buying any more of the fall cases even though I enjoy the horchata and pumpkin."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"There's a reason this is a limited autumn release, as it's so far the weakest fall seasonal I've had."

"I found this hiding in my fridge. When I poured it it has a carmel color body with a very little head. The smell is very faint of cinnamon and I get a grain also. The taste has a cinnamon up front and as it warms up the apple comes out. Mouthfeel is good and overall it reminds me of Christmas drink."

"clear medium to dark brown copperish color, smells malty, slight wheat aroma with hints of tart apples. Medium carbonation. apple and caramel flavors very muted. taste more like spiced apple juice mixed with crappy beer in the forefront with a sweet aftertaste. thanks again for the disappointment blue moon! no caramel flavor what so ever... LAME!"

"O: Not the best beer in the world , but certainly underrated due to the fact that it's brewed by coors. Their beers are often decent, even above average. This is my personal favorite, and it is much better than most of what they make. Definitely worth a try, given the price tag."
""
""
""

"O- this had the potential to be really good, but like most of Blue Moon's creations, it just seemed watered down and lacking any strong malty backbone"
""
""
"Taste starts out with a mild caramel malt front, the spicing while strong on the nose is fairly weak on the tongue, finishes with a weird metallic finish, carbonation is medium-high with a pretty thin body that makes this beer too watery."
"Blue Moon Caramel Apple Spiced Ale has a very thick, creamy, cream-colored head, a clear, bubbly, copper appearance, and a fairly good amount of lacing left behind. The aroma is of spices, breads, and some juice. Taste is very spiced, juicy, bready, and sweet- certainly flavorful. Also, there is a nice grain aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium and a bit slick, and Blue Moon Caramel Apple Spiced Ale finishes mostly dry, sweet, somewhat cloying, and easily drinkable. Overall, this is good, and it is outstanding for a flavored beer. RJT"

"Overall: Not a very exciting beer. I would not waste my money on this one again."
""
""
""
"Taste is an artifical sweet upfront, a fleeting apple tartness in the middle, and closes with moderate spices and bitterness. Mouthfeel is okay, and drinkability is kind of knocked for me due to the spicing, although hard to fault, it's in the name of the beer. Have to admit, not as bad as I feared, although that's not particularly a glowing review."
""
""
""
"To good health and good beer."
""
"O: A great fall beer! Wish the caramel apples would come in 6 pack instead of the bluemoon variety pack. Must try this beer! Sensational flavor!"
""
""
"Overall- I don't think these flavors work well in a beer. This is my least favorite Blue Moon offering and I won't be trying this one again."
""

"Pours a clear orange with a foamy tan head that fades to nothing. No lacing on the drink down. Smell is of malt, spice, caramel, and slight apple aromas. Taste is much the same with malt and apple flavors on the finish. There is a very mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty poor beer that displays the characteristics in its name but everything is quite subdued all around."
""
""
"This is just a rather bland beer. A friend of a friend brought this over for me to try. Glad I didn't pay for it. Well, it's not ""bad"" - it just struggles a bit to be ""okay""."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Probably wouldn't drink this again I prefer regular Blue Moon. The metallic taste and high malt is just unappealing. I would much rather have a cider either hard or non-alcoholic. The appearance and mouthfeel is all this has going for it."
""
""
"O: Interesting brew – well spiced."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"First review in a long while, too bad I didn't write one on a better beer. At least I didn't buy it. Doesn't go well with food, either."
""
""
""
"O: A great attempt at bridging the cider-beer categories, but not worth looking into when beer has better autumn styles and there's the entire cider market. Kudos for trying it though!"

"O: good, blue moon doesn't make bad beers really but never actually shines either. This is what one would expect from such a brewery."
""
""
""
""
""

"Overall a tasty brew from Blue Moon. The spicing was actually pretty subtle. Tasty summer beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Not my favorite, but not bad. Decent for the style."
"O: Overall I didn't really like the beer. I didn't get any spice, and I'm not completely convinced that I even really tasted apple in this beer. I wouldn't recommend it if you're buying it based on the packaging. On a side note my bottle says 8% which it hides very well. I'm not sure if the 5.8% displayed on BA is from an old version or what."

"Overall a very nice seasonal beer representation"
"Just put on the shelve today at the local store. Part of a 'make your own 6'. Pours a rich copper color with a whitish/tan head. Very little lacing is seen. The aroma is of sweet caramel, cinnamon, apples and grain. The taste is pretty much the same. Very tasty and goes down very easy. No bad aftertaste and gets you in the mood for autumn and football baby! Really liked this one!"

"O: Overall a good beer for fall by the bonfire just chilling with friends or whatever. Great value for the low price really amazed this is a Coors product."
""
""
"Poured into a pint glass, this beer is as clear as the evening sky on a quiet and warm summer night, its slightly disturbed by mild carbonation racing to the top, only to be hidden among the many densely packed bubbles forming the thick off white head. The aroma is rather light, but traces of brown sugar, raisin, pumpkin, caramel and a few spices do come through clearly. The taste is decent, some apple and cinnamon come through, a bit of alcohol can be tasted as it hits the back of your throat, and there’s plenty of sweetness I this beer, not as sweet as a Lambic, but it is there. Not a bad beer over all, I would mind having this a few more times."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a clear amber, little no no head. Nose has faint spices along with moderately sweet caramel malts. Taste brings the note of faint spice and faint apple juice with sweet caramel malts. Lighter side of medium bodied, lacking in carbonation. Lifeless beer that could benefit from a bigger dose of EVERYTHING. Noting horribley off putting, just bland."
"O- I must admit I probably waited to long to review this bottle. It did NOT hold up well. I would like to review it fresher."
"I like this beer and would hope that it becomes a regular seasonal. Nice offering from Coors."
""
""
"O: A little too sweet for my palate but still enjoyable - they achieve what they advertised, there is a definite subtle hint of caramel apples and spices. Easy to drink and was a hit with several of my NYC area evacuees (and hosts)."

"Inoffensive and simple and easy to drink. Nothing I'd seek out. Has an autumn feel."
""
""
""

""
"Overall: A pretty standard spiced beer. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to it's pretty intriguing and promising name. The cinnamon so overpowers any apple flavor that you really would have a hard time telling this apart from any other seasonal spiced beer. Still, kudos to Blue Moon/Coors for taking a stab at it."
""

"Overall- A decent attempt on a liquid version of the seasonal Caramel Apple favorite with cinnamon and nutmeg added in the mix."
""
""
""
""
""
"Presentation: Packaged in a twelve-ounce brown glass longnck bottle with a twist-off crown, served in a Chimay chalice."
"O - Bland, boring, and mislabled. Seems just hastily or lazily put together. A misfire."
"O: Meh, this beer is a letdown to me, should be more sweet and apple-y ! Carmel apple?? come on!"
""
"The beer goes well with some shitty new age music from Windham Hill Records"
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste and the aroma have much in common with sweet caramel malts, apple, spices, and a lower bitterness that lingers for a moment and then fades off. Altogether this is a decent offering from Blue Moon."
""
"Overall: Coors did a good job with this. Definitely a winner as far as novelty beers are concerned."

"Pours a beaitiful deep red with about an inch of head. Heavy aroma of apple and spice. Caramel is suspiciously absent in both aroma and taste, though I assume its being used more as a thickening agent, making it more beer than cider (which it succeeds in) and much smoother. Very fruity but not overpowering, though the aftertaste is a pleasant apple spice on the back of the pallete. Large gulps reveal more body, but this is really more of a sipping beer, and at that its very appley. Nice alternative to Pumpkin Ales of the season, though why one should want an alternative to Pumpkin Ales is beyond me. All in all, a very nice beer though I am not sure I would choose it OVER the Blue Moon Pumpkin which this year is fantastic."
"Average but not great spiced ale. Despite the caramel and apples in the name, neither is really present. The spices come through nicely though. The biggest problem is the flavor which is just a little bland. I expected this beer to be too sweet but it could actually stand to be a little sweeter. Overall, not a terrible beer, kind of interesting I guess, and something I will surely finish off, but Coors needs to work a little harder if they want to compete with the micros."

"Pours ruby red with half a finger worth of head. Leaving no lacing. Smells of fresh baked apple pie crust, With some pumpkin thrown into the mix. Is this an apple pie in a bottle? Tastes like apple pie crust with a huge hit of cinnamon. Would be wonderful if it weren't for the MASSIVE sweetness that hits during the swallowing. The mouthfeel is of strong cinnamon, And an absolutely choking sweetness. Overall, this beer is just too damn sweet. Seriously, TONE IT DOWN. The flavors were pretty good though."
"My roommate brought home a Blue Moon Autumn sampler pack, and I couldn't help but try this one. It pours out a red-copper color with a tiny head. The aroma is heavily spiced, it smells like a generic pumpkin beer. The taste is, again, mostly spices. Cinnamon and nutmeg. There's a bit of clarity in the middle, with a fairly clean finish. The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Pretty uninspiring stuff. It's basically just a different spin on a pumpkin beer."
""
"Overall - They were going for a caramel apple flavor, and I'd say they missed their target. It tastes more akin to that last bit of apple pie crust that's left in the tin, with just a bit of the filling left on the piece. It gives you hints of just how delicious that pie was, but it leaves your craving completely and utterly unsatisfied."
"In closure, this beer is absolutely an embarrassment."

"I wasn't sure whether to list this as a fruit beer, a spiced beer, or something else, so if anyone wants to change the style, feel free. Either way, I've been looking forward to trying this stuff since it was put out as a test batch a while back. It pours a clear amber-garnet topped by a finger or so of tenuous dirty-beige foam. The nose comprises cinnamon, caramel, and, way in the back, some light green apple flesh. Yeah, I could see that being spiced caramel apple. The taste focuses on the caramel and cinnamon, adding here and there some light clove notes. There's a vague sense of what may or may not be apple in there as well, but it may just be wishful thinking based on the label. Regardless, there's definitely some sort of fruitiness in there. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a seemingly grainy feel (it's really not grainy, but it seems as though some ground cinnamon is floating about in suspension...seriously...). Overall, this may not completely live up to the billing, but it does deliver on the spice, and, in that regard, it ain't half bad. I'd have another..."
