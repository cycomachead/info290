"A balanced and relaxed strong ale for me. Not a maple bomb I expected but more refined, still solid and very drinkable for the ABV."

"O - Overall I was somewhat disappointed by this beer. Faint maple, more metallic than anything."
""
"Overall - Solid brew. I think it gets a bad rap on here and frankly I disagree. To each their own! I personally think this is a great fusion brew."
""
""
""
"I'm wishing that I had purchased more than one bomber of this gourmet Vermont ale when I had the chance, but with Double Sunshine and Peril taking up most of my budget at Lawson's 5th Anniversary celebration, that's just the way it goes. Guess I'll have to wait until next April to score multiples of this delightful elixir!"
"O - interesting ale. I was expecting something more from this ale but it was still decent."
""
""
""
"Overall - Very uninspired. I like maple beer, but this is dull."
""
""
""
""
"Very tasty easy drinking beer. Not as mapley as I thought it would be, but the sweetness is nice."

"O: This was ok. Very odd style of beer. Wouldn't really want to try again."
""
"This beer is the beer for maple lovers. If you love maple syrup then you have got to try this beer and really no better place for a brewer to make a maple beer than Vermont. After a vigorous pour this beer had a 2 mm head which faded to lace. There was a floating solid peace of something in the glass that I couldn't identify but it made me excited. First taste this beer screams maple syrup, even down the the mouth feel of the beer. It is smooth and ohhh so tasty as you continue to drink the maple falls to the background but the smoothness stays with you. Overall a delicious and uniquely Vermont experience."
""
""
"It's pretty basic but still very tasty. I enjoyed it very much."
""
"O-pleasant enough, but really lacks a kick of spices or maple that would make this much more enjoyable"
""
"O: I was a little disappointed, I was really hoping for a lot more maple presence to this beer (especially with it being called maple nipple). It was an interesting and fairly unique beer but nothing out of this world. Alcohol is fairly well hidden for this big a beer."

"O: I love Lawson's but this is not one of their best offerings, its not bad by any stretch of the imagination though. I like the flavors here, but I wish they were more robust or maybe overpowered by sweetness which isn't to say its not enjoyable, I liked it. I did not love it, worth a try in my opinion especially if you have an infinitely to maple syrup and hey he's in the middle of maple syrup country so why not do it up."
"O- This was a decent offering from Lawson's which is very good, but definitely a little bit toned down on the maple syrup compared to his other offerings. The maple syrup still adds a nice sweetness which in my opinion goes well with the beer. While this wasn't anything mind-blowing and definitely not one of Lawson's best offerings, I still definitely enjoyed this and in my opinion it is under-rated. I would definitely have this again and I recommend checking it out if you get the chance."
"D: sweet, cloying, a big beer indeed. if you like sweet, maple syrup, i highly recommend. more of a holiday brew for me, but since this was consumed so close to Christmas i cant say i mind."

"Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, maple, spices, and alcohol. Taste is much the same with a mild spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer but the maple doesn't really come out all that much in my opinion."

"Poured into a Heady Topper stemless snifter, a clearish maple brown color (appropriately), with a finger or so of foamy white head that receded to a wispy layer, leaving some short-lived lacing on the glass. Woody aroma, bready, with hints of maple. I've learned from homebrewing that maple is an extremely difficult sugar to work with, and after the yeast noms it up, it's hard to get any maple aroma or flavor remnants, so all things considered, the maple in the nose was adequate. Taste was similar to the smell, woody, bready malts, caramel, maple was more subtle at first, but came out more as the palate adjusted, moderate earthy hops, and a decent booze kick for a dry finish. Medium body, tasty, very good overall. Just don't go in expecting to get a pure glass of gooey sweet maple syrup booze."
""
"Maple adds a nice touch to the palate but it doesn't play as nearly as strong a role as it does in some of Lawsons other maple beers (Faystons stout). Biscuity and toffee malt flavors pair well with it. A bit of a full bodied feel to it makes for a nice drink on a cool fall evening."

"the maple syrup is a nice sweetening agent, but if i tried this blindfolded i wouldn't even know there was maple in it. however, the sweetness is smooth, and as i said not cloying at all - a very nice balance not often attained. the result is just a nice slightly sweet dark ale with a nice carbonation fit for a cool fall evening. is it overpriced? many would say yes. I'm glad I bought it, but moneywise, when it comes down to this or three cans of heady, well you know...."

"Overall: I wanted this to be spectacular, but it was just alright. Oh well, still not bad."
"O: Nothing offensive or repulsive, just boring, bland, and uninteresting."
"HV"
"Sk√ÖL!"
"This is a medium bodied brew with a nearly full feel. It boasts a light level of carbonation but is easy drinking. It is my understanding that maple sugar is highly fermentable, that didn't seem to be the case with this beer. If it was a little more attenuated I couldn't have easily drank more but as-is, it lends itself as a very sweet desert offering."
"D - I must say that I was a bit underwhelmed by Maple Nipple. This is one nipple of which I was quick to be weaned off."
"Medium bronze colpr, light offwhite head decent lace.aroma was sport of metallic,astringent and mapley. Taste was maple and bopze, some oak and odd astringency. Feel was medium creamy nicely carbonated. Drink was average. Nothing special rashly. Nice to at least try though."
"One of the strangest beers I've tasted in a while; not what I expected, much more subtle, which is a bit of a lost art. Good beer, & I'm growing fonder of Lawson's with each bottle we pop."
"D - Kind of hard to drink as it's too sweet and not really all that good. I'll pass on this."
"Pass on this."
"D: That brassy/metallic flavor dominates after each sip and is really a turn-off. To the point it was a struggle to finish. To the point, also, I don't really want this again - unless much more sweet maple can be ensured. Disappointing, but maybe because my hopes were so high..."
"drinkability is nice. sort of an odd but interesting beer. i don't know if it's completely to my taste, but it was neat none the less."
"D: I was fairly impressed by this one. Not going to end up being one of my favorites, but for a maple flavored beer, this does a surprisingly good job of not being too overpoweringly sweet and syrupy. Thanks again for yet another great brew from Lawson's Finest, Michael!"
"D - Drinkability is moderate. The alcohol is really well hidden, only coming through now and then in the finish but it adds a nice heat to it. It certainly does creep up on you, and I saw this bottle disappear dangerously quickly. However, besides the maple and hops, this beer does sort of drag on near the end, but while it lasts, it is pretty unique and tasty."
"A beer called Maple Nipple from Vermont needs to be a Maple Extravaganza. This isn't bad, but could be so much more..."
"D: An interesting idea and well done, but still not very drinkable. Enjoyable in very small quantities. I'm glad I got to try this unique brew."
"Pours a moderate copper color with a half-finger of white head. A moderate amount of a white head and a bit of a thin collar as it goes down. The nose brings some slight maple character. Very faint indeed. There is a bit of sweet grain and some brown sugar there as well. The taste is slight molasses and brown sugar in addition to a bit of maple character. Medium body with pretty good carbonation. Not my favorite Lawson's beer, though glad I got to pick this bottle up."
"Beer has an almost nutty quality to it, lots of maple, lots of sweetness, and some alcohol in the front half. The beer overall is medium in body and has low carbonation on the palate. The finish is a little dry but not overly so. Interesting, it's a good beer for the ingredients, a little too hot but overall a decent beer."
"Wow, this was a VERY pleasant surprise that slowly worked its magic on me and a buddy as we got through two bottles of this. I think that this is one of those beers that you have to ""get"" and this completely worked for me. I loved how the molasses worked with the bright citric fruit notes and that big but approachable body makes for some fantastic sipping during those cold late fall nights. This beer just screamed Vermont to me. I nominate this as the official state beer!"
"d - A decent spiced beer but something in the taste was a little weird to me. I enjoyed the smell but not the taste as much. Probably wouldn't seek it out again but would give another try if I came across it."
"Cheers!"
"Drinkability is pretty good. I really like the maple syrup aspect of this beer, but it feels like one or two things are just a bit off. I think if Lawson's were to tweak the recipe a little bit they could have an A range maple beer on their hands. Still enjoyed the bottle I had though and I would love to get my hands on some Maple Tripple."
"Overall this is a solid winter beer. Glad I could try it!"
"1290"
"This tastes unique, definitely a lot of maple syrup character, sweet but not over-the-top, with a sort of sticky mouthfeel as well. That defines it more or less, really no counterplay from malts, just clean pale malts I suppose. I can't taste the alcohol but the burn comes through in the upper digestive system, making it a sipper. Rich and delicious, a good night cap of a beer."
"Palate is also dominated by cardboard, really oxidized and stale with a bit of maple behind it. A little toasted bitterness comes through in the finish, and an odd medicinal flavor. The body is thin. This is pretty bad."
"Not great overall, definitely a bit off. I wonder if this is how it always is or if something happened to this bottle."
"This isn't a bad beer, but it's not very good. I'm glad I got a chance to try this, and I will seek out other Lawson's in the hopes that this beer is an anomaly, but I don't ever think that this beer will grace my lips again."
"Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low to medium carbonation, a touch of warmth but alcohol is really well hidden. Not really any maple character but a pretty unique beer. Thanks Alex!"
"Luxorious fall/winter offering. Well crafted, delicious, understated yet bold, mild yet heady at 9%. Well worth seeking out."
"Average mouthfeel and drinkability. This one drinks a lot like an American barleywine with an added dimension of having maple. I love maple so that's a good thing."
"I shared this bottle with three other friends. Poured into a tulip. The body is maple brown with a thin off white head that doesn't retain too long and leaves a bit of spotty lacing. The aroma is toasted malts with a bit of spicy hops with just a bit of maple to the aroma. Holy rich maple! The taste is toasty with a bit of spice and a really big maple finish. The maple is bold and rich and finishes pretty nicely. I think the maple isn't too overpowering and balanced pretty well with the toasty flavor. The mouthfeel is light but the maple makes it slightly sticky. It's still nice and the carbonation is well done. For a nine percent beer, this drinks pretty well, especially on a cool Autumn evening."
"Up front this tastes like a decent brown ale, but the maple comes through perfectly in the aftertaste. A nice pleasant sipper for a fall afternoon - I shared this bottle with a friend and was itching to crack the other, but it was saved for another day. Not sure if Sean Lawson considers this his flagship beer, but it should be - this is damn fine drinking. Well done."
"Apparently you can only purchase this beer by the bottle at a small store in Warren, VT. They receive small shipments and never know which type they will get each Friday. There is a 4 bottle per person per day limit. I was able to get my 4 bottle around 4pm on Saturday afternoon shortly before they sold out. The beer pours into the glass to reveal a nice hazy copper color with a thick tan head that last a while and leaves a nice lacing. The aroma is mild maple, roasted malt and light apple. The mouthfeel was medium and mildly silky. There was a slight buttery feel on the lips as the beer was tasted. The first taste is mild maple with roasted caramel followed my a mild hop bitterness and an alcohol warmth in the finish. I am more of a DIPA fan, but I really liked this beer. If it wasn't for the alcohol taste in the finish it would be almost perfect."
"Update: The second pour from the bottle I include some floating yeast which gives a more pronounced fresh bread and maple feel. Mr. Lawson doesn't lie as this is both smooth and powerful with the alcohol approaching as it warms. Medium carbonation; a nice, sweet, and spicy libation on an early autumn evening."
"This bomber was brought back from VT for me by joshman - thanks dude. Rare batch # 135, bottle # 32. Poured into stemmed glasses. First thing I noticed was the odd color. The best way to describe it would be a dark neon rust color. A different shade of color that I have ever seen before. Nice thick bubbly head, with some good lacing. Smell was semi-sweet, a bit like a rich caramel. Taste was good, but interesting. Had a nice maltiness to it, but on the sweet side. I did not get the maple flavor, but I think that it was added merely as a way to sweeten the beer, and not necessarily as a flavor component. Mouthfeel was on the thick side, which is what I would expect from a beer made with syrup. Drinkability was fairly good, as it was a great tasting beer and the high abv was well hidden. I am glad I got a chance to try a beer from this regional brewer, and this was a nice intro."
"Flavor is interesting. Light to medium body, medium carbonation...very sharp and boozy. Not as thick and creamy as I expected. Also, not nearly as sweet as anticipated due to the description. Regardless, not bad at all...just different. Lots of strong ale resemblances. Slight hops, yeast, and again...more booze. Glad I got to try this one!"
"D - Decent, but not a Lawson's offering I'd seek out again. Looking forward to the beers made with actual maple/bourbon barrels."
"Pours a cloudy light apple cider amber color with a BIG stiff off white head that resists fading and leaves a nice amount of Belgian lacing behind. I really like the smell it's crazy sweet maple syrup and pumpkin or something, very slight spice thing happening. The mouth feel is lightly carbonated, velvety smooth and medium-full bodied. I'm starting to feel a little heat..very little. Not distracting in anyway. The flavor is sweet and malty maple syrup...seriously 'get the pancakes out'. LOVE IT!. I guess you've really got to be in the mood for this one because I don't understand the scores that it's getting. I could drink this all night long. Point me the way to Lawson's!!!"
"mmm, nipples."
"P.S. Is this really a ""fruit beer""? Unless I am failing at life again and do not understand the definition of ""fruit", this contains none."
"Drinkability- I love new beers. Especially new brews that are big and original and something that I've never tasted before. This is one of those. I figured it would be tasty but I was thinking it would be really sweet and cloying and hard to finish the whole 22oz. It wasn't and I really enjoyed this. It's unique and tasty and all sorts of drinkable. Thanks Adam!"
"Taste is nice and maple as well, some sugary notes and a bit wheaty. Very nice! A bit of nice light malt character as well, but almost no hops to it."
"Out of Sean's 'Vault' this heretofore unnamed ale had been aged for two years before being released at the Lawson's Finest Liquids one-year anniversary on St. Patrick's Day, 2009. It was a perfectly clear golden-amber color with an off-white, fluffy, one-finger head. The retention was excellent and the lacing streaky. The aroma was of sour green apples, pale malt, floral hops and a touch of maple sweetness. The flavors were wild! Sour apples, tart esters, Belgian yeast, orange peel, a clear alcoholic bite and herbal elements. Very citric and acidic overall; reminiscent of a punchy, Flanders Old Bruin. Crisp but lacking enough malt to balance it. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation medium."
