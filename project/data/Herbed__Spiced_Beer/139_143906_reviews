"Pours with a small, white head. Has a reddish brown color. Has aromas of malts, gingerbread, and hops.  Initial taste is of gingerbread, hops, and malts. The combination of these flavors persists throughout the aftertaste. Not a very complex melody of flavors. The gingerbread flavor is somewhat weak compared to the hops and malts. Hops give the flavor and added sweetness on top of the gingerbread while the amber malts give it a crisp taste. Overall a good beer, but nothing too impressive."
"Not very tasty, so won't be repeating that purchase."

"Personally I really enjoyed this. If you're into seasonal brews such as pumpkin ales, this is for you. Appearance- nice dark amber, two fingers of off white foam that quickly goes down to a thin layer. Smells like sweet gingerbread. Tastes like gingerbread, nutmeg, and hints of pumpkin spice. Finishes clean with a nice gingerbread aftertaste. Very light and smooth. Very easy to drink."
"Tastes like a gingerbread cookie"

"Over sweet and watery. Looks and smells decent. Awful when you take a sip."

"Way too much ginger for not enough body."

"Don't usually like flavored beers but this was interesting. Nice beer to relax with when you just want to drink beer."

"O- for what they were trying for, they pretty much succeeded.  Definitely worth a try if you like gingerbread cookies"

"Dip your plain gingerbread cookie in some brown ale and this is what you get.........Pours a nice deep, golden brown with ok head and minimal lacing. Aroma is of molasses and gingerbread cookies. Taste is similar with touches of molasses, cinnamon, nutmeg and sweet maltiness. Carbonation is just the right amount from keeping this beer from being flat. Nice balance, and I swear, this tastes just like gingerbread cookies. A little thick on the tongue, but overall, balances well and is enjoyable, especially around the holidays on a cold day !!"

"Nothing spectacular but not as bad as I expected. Had good carbonation and and a subtle nutmeg nose to it. Mouthfeel was oily and uncomfortable."

"A whole lot better than I was expecting, given my recent-ish exposure to this brewery's wares - it does indeed come across as very gingerbread-like, but still in a beer format.  Not that I'd want a number of servings of this, but hey, that goes the same for the holiday confection that it's aping, as well."
"Overly sweet and too thin"

"Ba is telling me I need to enter a review to submit, not sure why.  This is typical shipyard mass-market artificially flavored bud lite nonsense.  I know this crap is a money maker for them, but it's too bad because they're a more capable brewery than this."

"Interesting beer.   Spices seems close, but not quite right."

"Ginger flavor is old. Not fresh tasting nor spicy. Smells ok. Thin and slightly sweet. No noticeable hop flavor. Sour.Not a winner in my book."

"Overall: Not all that impressive. I will not waste my money on this one again."

"If you have had Shipyard's Pumkin Head and loved it, and you enjoy the flavor of ginger, then this beer will be enjoyed. I was skeptical at first, but it turned out to be a delicious treat to enjoy after a good meal in front of a warm fire."

"Pours a medium brown color, slight chill haze.  The aroma is full of cinnamon rolls, sweetness, vanilla and malts.  The taste has some sweetness, slight buttery character, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and breads.  Sweet and spices work surprisingly well with a brown ale base and Shipyard's temperamental yeast strain,  Drinks easy enough and has that holiday spice many are seeking,  This is a pretty interesting beer from Shipyard."

"Like the aroma the baked gingerbread cookie sensations are all over the taste with slightly tart and bitter finish."

"Bottle. Pours a clear, copper color. Mild head. Looks very light bodied. Aroma is packed with gingerbread. It's completely dedicated to smell like gingerbread. It smells so convincingly on-point I am sure it's jam-packed with artificial flavoring. The flavor is much the same. Gingerbread and accompanying spices. Light bodied. Zesty bubbles. Lingering flavor. Too much flavoring, needs more beer characteristics."
