The moldy appearance on the top after the head recedes is so off-putting, it's like I left iced tea in the den and forgot about it for 4 days. The flavor is awful, and the mouthfeel isn't far ahead of it. If they sold this in six pack bottles people would demand that this be taken off the market. I'm glad I only got two of these in my variety pack.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Sep 02, 2014"

2.5,-18.3,,,,,,"There was an oddness to this flavor that I just couldn't place.  Slightly bitter, lacking something.  The spices overshadowed the usual pleasant warmth and fullness of the wheat.  I didn't taste any apple, only a hint at what should be caramel but came off more chemical in taste than treat.  Not a flavor I would choose intentionally, and coupled with the farmhouse red, it will probably keep me from buying any more of the fall cases even though I enjoy the horchata and pumpkin.","indigosand","Aug 30, 2014"

The aroma is rather light, but traces of brown sugar, raisin, pumpkin, caramel and a few spices do come through clearly. The taste is decent, some apple and cinnamon come through, a bit of alcohol can be tasted as it hits the back of your throat, and there’s plenty of sweetness I this beer, not as sweet as a Lambic, but it is there.

3.15,2.9,4,4,2.5,2.5,3.5,"Pours a beaitiful deep red with about an inch of head. Heavy aroma of apple and spice. Caramel is suspiciously absent in both aroma and taste, though I assume its being used more as a thickening agent, making it more beer than cider (which it succeeds in) and much smoother. Very fruity but not overpowering, though the aftertaste is a pleasant apple spice on the back of the pallete. Large gulps reveal more body, but this is really more of a sipping beer, and at that its very appley. Nice alternative to Pumpkin Ales of the season, though why one should want an alternative to Pumpkin Ales is beyond me. All in all, a very nice beer though I am not sure I would choose it OVER the Blue Moon Pumpkin which this year is fantastic.","chrisjduncan","Aug 22, 2012"
3.28,7.2,4,3.5,3,3,3.5,"Average but not great spiced ale. Despite the caramel and apples in the name, neither is really present. The spices come through nicely though. The biggest problem is the flavor which is just a little bland. I expected this beer to be too sweet but it could actually stand to be a little sweeter. Overall, not a terrible beer, kind of interesting I guess, and something I will surely finish off, but Coors needs to work a little harder if they want to compete with the micros.","Cylinsier","Aug 20, 2012"

Is this an apple pie in a bottle? Tastes like apple pie crust with a huge hit of cinnamon. Would be wonderful if it weren't for the MASSIVE sweetness that hits during the swallowing. The mouthfeel is of strong cinnamon, And an absolutely choking sweetness. Overall, this beer is just too damn sweet. Seriously, TONE IT DOWN.

The aroma is heavily spiced, it smells like a generic pumpkin beer. The taste is, again, mostly spices. Cinnamon and nutmeg. There's a bit of clarity in the middle, with a fairly clean finish. The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated, and the drinkability is good. Pretty uninspiring stuff. It's basically just a different spin on a pumpkin beer.","shand","Aug 08, 2012"
