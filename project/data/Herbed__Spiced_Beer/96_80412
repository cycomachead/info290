This is a great brew for spring AND summer on those clear-skied days where you just wanna laze about and enjoy the tiny things in life. I will buy this brew again for such occasions.","Caveworm","May 23, 2014"

The aroma is quite good, mostly consisting of citrus esters, as well as herbs, honey, and yeast. For the flavor, bready grains dominate, with buttery hazelnut, tea leaves, and some subtle hops. There's a very bitter backbone and sour, dry finish. Definitely a bit of a grassy, vegetal aftertaste. This is very easy to drink however and none of the flavors are very loud.

It has a nice sweet background that is harder to describe but like the smell of a nice summer night. Taste is not nearly as sweet as the smell would have indicated, the flavor starts malty but moves into a unique bitterness, that does not taste like hops. I can only assume this is from the dandelion as this is my first dandelion beer. The bitter sticks around through the aftertaste, and gets stronger, almost to the point of a lip smacking bitter. The mouthfeel is nice a crisp light beer, smooth and easy to drink. If the bottle didn't display the dandelion I would have had a hard time guessing that one. No overpowering flavors, a nice enjoyable beer, overall it is well done.","wingman14","Mar 18, 2013"

3.7,14.6,4,4,3.5,3.5,3.75,"My pour blossomed into a fluffy finger of bone-white pollen until it was borne away on the wind. Color was dandy, lion-yellow with a haze of suspended particulate in evidence. Nose had an earthy, grassy smell and I began to consider boiling it down into something that I could put in a pipe and smoke. Mouthfeel was medium and it had an initial, unexpected tartness that gave way to a grassy flavor, like freshly-mown grass. Interesting. Unibroue makes "Ephemere", pronounced "Ay-fem-er-ay" and the finish on this one was ephemeral. I found myself wondering if I had even had a sip until I saw the lacing in the glass. Just like for the lotus-eaters, time was passing me by like nothing. There may be a subtle message in there - stay away from some types of plant matter, man. Wow, this was such a smooth drink that it seemed to evaporate out of my glass as I simply could not have drank it that quickly. I am definitely buying some more for use this summer.

3.87,19.8,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.75,"So what is Magic Hat's Pistil? I thought it was just a floral IPA, but it's certainly not hoppy or bitter enough. It is quite floral though, clearly reflecting the name. Ah, the label reads "ALE BREWED WITH DANDELION". Well that's fairly unique. I'd heard of dandelion wine as a kid (it was something my older neighbors made at home), but I've never heard of it in a beer. Or have I? Let me look it up. Ah, yes. Apparently it's not that unique, but it's still interesting. I also note that it's just 4.5% ABV. Perhaps this is a spring beer. Check, the Magic Hat website confirms it. OK, let's take a closer look: Hazy yellow-gold body beneath a pillowy white head. Slightly better than average retention and lacing. Floral nose as mentioned. A little bit of golden malt sneaks through as well. Nice. In the mouth it's light bodied and moderately crisp. Appropriate for what they're doing here. The flavor is not as floral as the aroma suggests, implying to me that it's actual dandelions and not just hops giving it that brightness in the nose (I also get an occasional light note of chlorophyll as well, which backs that up). There's a light tartness to it, which is refreshing; and which also seems to give me more of a floral impression (unless I'm just succumbing to the power of suggestion). It's not very bitter... maybe in the 20's, and it finishes quite dry with the flavor almost vanishing. That's OK though, that works. It's a light bodied and lower alcohol spring beer that's very refreshing, and I don't really need it to linger in the mouth. There's enough charm to the floral / dandelion aspect of it that it's interesting, and thankfully not overdone. I can imagine drinking a few of these in a row. Would I buy it again? Sure. I'd enjoy a pint of this at the pub as my first beer, and I think it would be a good beer to take to a party (I'm pretty sure women would like it). Would I recommend it? Certainly to try. It may not be the only dandelion beer available (does Fantome still brew Pissenlit?), but it's still unique.","NeroFiddled","Mar 13, 2013"

3.63,12.4,4,4,3.5,3.25,3.5,"Overall I thought this was nice beer and a good example of the style, it wasn't full of dead on dandelion flavors but the earthy, floral, and lemongrass aspects reminded me of them. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, refreshing, and the flavors held my attention nicely, this would be a great warm weather beer and I could see drinking a few of these while enjoying a warm day in late spring, the refreshing flavors would really work nicely during the warmer months. What I liked the most about this beer was the aroma and appearance they were both good and I like the complexity in the aroma. What I liked the least about this beer was the creaminess in the mouthfeel, it just seemed unnecessary and out of place. I would buy a six pack of this beer again when it starts to get warmer outside, I think it would make for a nice beer to enjoy while playing some disc golf. and I would recommend this to anyone who likes floral beers. All in all I liked this beer, but I didn't love it, the dandelions worked out better than I thought they would and while they didn't provide any exact dandelion flavors, it did impart some flavors that reminded me of smelling the dandelions bloom in the spring time. Magic Hat seems to be stepping their game up, Heart of Darkness and this beer have both been better than I expected and they give me hope that one day I will find a Magic Hat beer that I really like. Good work guys, I would have never thought to brew a beer with dandelions, and while this wasn't a smash hit it sure wasn't a failure by any means and I enjoyed drinking it, it takes some out of the box thinking and creativity to come up with a beer like this and I applaud that.","StoutHunter","Mar 06, 2013"

3.25,0.6,3.5,3.5,3,3,3.5," This is a unique beer because I can't say I have had any type of beer with dandelion in it before. The smell is totally different than the taste until midway through and it starts with a slight malt taste, but gets very floral almost grassy and slightly lemony in the next taste. The yeast adds a light creaminess to the flavor with subtle toasted tinges from the malt which has a mild sweet element, but overall the flavors are ok, just seem to cohabitate in general. Overall a good beer to try if you like wheat and spice, but not a really complex beer, more for summer relaxation and I felt it was decent.","Slatetank","Jun 14, 2012"

Like most Magic Hat brews, this had an interesting concept and taste but nothing about it really stood out. I enjoyed drinking it, but probably not something I'd drink all the time. I like how they are pretty experimental though, not many beers that I know of are brewed with dandelions. I'm not sure what dandelions taste like, but you can definitely sense a lot of floral/herbal presence in this beer. Recommended trying it in a 12-pack.","jaasen64","Jun 05, 2012"

Grassy notes, flowery, light perfume, nothing I would call "spicy" per se, just more floral than anything. This beer had to have been very fresh. Crisp but subdued hops, and light biscuity malts.

It pours out a hazy yellow color with two fingers of head that don't stick around for too long. The aroma is nice, it's got a bit of a hoppy pilsner feel to it, with herbal and citrus hops and grass. The taste is very interesting, with the citrus hops and some tea-like flavors coming through first. Then follows some smooth malts, a very light sour note, and more citrus flavors, ending with a clean, grassy note. There's a lot going on for the 4.5% ABV. The mouthfeel is crisp and light, and the drinkability is very good. This is a superb and interesting summer beer, with plenty of flavor to go with its drinkability.","shand","Apr 15, 2012"
