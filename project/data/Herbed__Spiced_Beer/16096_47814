3.78,2.7,4,3.5,4,4,3.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, 2013 vintage bottling. Pours slightly cloudy reddish copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of caramel, cherry, pear, apple, light banana, bread, candi sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, pepper, herbal, allspice, and yeast earthiness. Nice aromas with solid balance and good complexity of malt, spice, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, cherry, pear, apple, light banana, toast, candi sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, pepper, herbal, allspice, and yeast earthiness. Moderate yeast/herbal spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, cherry, pear, apple, light banana, toast, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, pepper, herbal, allspice, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Very nice balance and complexity of yeast ester, spices, and malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a slightly slick and moderately crisp/prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very good spiced Belgian strong ale. All around good balance and complexity of yeast ester, spices, and malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","May 05, 2014"

The aroma is inviting there is aromas of nutmeg, cinnomon, ginger, and a candied yeast aroma. The aroma is big and bold. The taste follows suit but isn't as big. The taste has a candied yeast up front with notes of nutmeg, cinnomon, and spice in the middle. An alcohol taste comes through at the back end and there is a big of a cough syrupy aftertaste if you leave it on the tongue. The mouthfeel is sticky and moderately to lowly carbonated.

Very sweet malty taste - it's good, but the finish is a bit heavy on cloves and the mouth feel is a little 'boozy.' Might put some people off. I'm ok with the amount of 'warming' going on here.

3.92,6.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Enjoyed at the brew pub in downtown Allentown this special brew is served in a tulip glass. It shows a deep but clear rosy copper color with a nice fuzzy off-white head with good lacing. The aroma suggests definitive yet tasteful sweet clove and cinnamon allspice with a bayberry kiss. Very nice and tempting. The taste buds catch a beautifully christmasy bubblegum hop and grain mixed seamlessly with a green leaf edge. This is pretty close to being full bodied but it has lots of active carbonation that makes the feel a bit lighter and frothy so it goes down a little easier. Almost over-carbonated perhaps. The sweetness is definitely a bit cloying so I think this would go best with some form of food/cheese to help cut it a little. The taste definitely suggests the holidays but it doesn’t bring any clear cranberry or cinnamon, or whatever. To me the prevailing flavor is the very sweet bubblegum and the rest is a subtle mix that generally works but gets a little old kind of fast. Personally, in small quantities, it’s a real nice Christmas brew. At 12 ounces it seems a little tedious.","Durge","Dec 16, 2011"

Moderate yeast character, though not much. Body is somewhat light for the style, though I'd say more toward medium overall. Low to moderate levels of carbonation. A bit strange and full of spices without much else. No real Belgian character. Not a big fan.","Thorpe429","Dec 08, 2010"
3.72,1.1,3,3.5,3.5,4,4.5,"Overall: I like that this is easy to drink for a 10.5% beer, and it had some nice spice to it. That being said, it lacked the complexity and b*&lls that a beer of this style should have. Worth a try if someone has them in their basement, but I would not pay for this again. Either way, Cheers!!","dahlen22","Nov 06, 2010"
3.62,-1.6,3,3.5,3.5,4,4,"Drinkabilty: It's a sipper for sure. I think that the body doesn't complement the high ABV too well, but overall it's something worth trying.","turnstile","Beers"
3.47,-5.7,3.5,4,3.5,3,3,"D/O- This beer is the definition of a sipper with the amount of alcohol in it. I've had beers that had bigger percentages of alcohol, but they hid their potency better than Rude Elf did. Personally I would have liked the spices and booze to have been toned down a notch and the Belgian yeast characteristics to have been upped a notch. I imagine that putting this beer in the cellar for one or two years will result in a very good beer. There's definitely better BSDAs out there, but if you can find a single of this go for it. Cheers.","pvsob","0"
4.1,11.4,4,4,4,4,4.5,"D - I was never really one to get overly excited about Winter/Christmas beers but this one has resurrected an interest to explore this particular style, very enjoyable. I could handle, maybe two of these. Three...pushing the limits. This is a really well brewed beer. GREAT job!","jzeilinger","Jan 19, 2010"
3.21,-12.8,4.5,3.5,3,4,2.5,"This beer needs a couple years in the cellar to round out the alcohol heat and hopefully the spices will settle. The flavors come across as a bit disjointed, but time would likely help blend things together.","mentor","Dec 18, 2009"

3.03,-17.7,3.5,3,3,3,3,"On tap at the Allentown location. Pours a deep red, clear, with a small white head. Aroma of lots of spices -- ginger, cinnamon, gingerbread, clove. Flavor again is dominated by the spices mentioned above. Heavy mouthfeel. This was just a little overkill for me with all the spices and alcohol.","LilBeerDoctor","Beers"
4.32,17.4,4,4.5,4.5,4,4,"The Rude Elf's Reserve was definitely worth the trip. Everything you could have hoped from a Belgian holiday beer. The green apple flavors were amazing and perfectly placed with the other spices and candi. A 1/2 gallon growler was going for about $25, so I didn't get one, but I'm kicking myself now. Guess I'll have to wait until next year to have one again.","jlandis","0"
