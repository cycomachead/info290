Pleasant spiciness and floral character, more acidic and tart than I would expect given the body but it keeps it from going down the route of the overly sweet fruit beer and for that DdC gets my approval, this is a very unique and well balanced beer.

Taste of pear, cherry, lemon zest, strawberry, wheat, herbal, floral, earth, pepper, and yeast spices. Light tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of light fruit, wheat, herbal, floral, earth, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Nice balance and complexity of flavors; no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming noticed at all after the finish. Overall this is a very good witbier style. Nice flavor balance and complexity; very smooth to drink. Quite enjoyable.

Turns out I hadn't had this beer and I was pleasantly surprised by it's characteristics. The pour from what I could tell in the dark bar that I was in looked reddish pink in the dim lighting they had. The head was foamy and white. The smell of the beer was herbal and floral. The taste of the beer was along those same lines, it had plenty of herbal notes and some citrus in there. The mouthfeel was soft and very drinkable. Overall this beer was pretty damn good I thought.","Knapp85","Aug 12, 2011"
3.86,1.3,3,4.5,4,3,3.5,"O: A pretty good beer, with the high points coming in through the smell and taste. Really wish the mouth would have been more of a performer, as I think the flavors could have used a bit of an effervescent boost. I liked some of the light flavor contrast from some mild funk and green stems. There' a reasonable amount of complexity here even with a fairly weak mouth, but I can't help but wonder how much better this would be with some real fizz. A good beer that isn't hard to get down, but it could have improved every category with an uplifting mouth-feel and carbonation.","Cavery","Aug 08, 2011"

As I already said in my review this beer looks so cool, I’ve actually never really seen a pink beer before. The smells are that of a typical wheat beer and the taste kind of reminds me of a vodka cooler at first then the citrusy fruits and spicy notes come back which remind you that you are drinking a beer. All in all a great brew here from Dieu du ciel, a definite summer one for me and I can’t wait to be drinking these on my patio this summer, personally I liked it.","Roke87","May 27, 2011"

Small spots of lace here and there on the glass that dissipate and slide back down into the remaining beer. Smell is of a light witbier with red berries, hibiscus flowers, and some slight spices. Taste is of sweet red berries, hibiscus, cranberry, with a traditional witbier aftertaste. Good carbonation with a light, crisp mouthfeel.

The beer almost tastes like sweet flower petals...very soft and creamy mouthfeel. Vinous aspect comes forth with a tart, tannic character. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew, well worth the rather steep price tag that most of the DDC bottles seem to carry. I bet this would be very good on tap as well.","twiggamortis420","Apr 29, 2011"

3.95,3.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"Picked up a bottle of this from Connecticut Avenue Wine and Liquors. What a great beer. To be clear, though, it's not a great beer because of some quirky, eyebrow-raising infusion of hibiscus. That light, floral taste is there, but this beer isn't the festina peche of the hibiscus. Instead, the flower is used more in the way that BFM uses tea. It's really light, and you have to be pretty feeling pretty keen to find it. And after tasting it used in this way, it's just how I want it. Medium carbonation, rosy color, and a little bit of body with refreshing floral/grapefruit notes. I can't wait to have it out of a tap.","petacutlasaurus","Apr 02, 2011"

It's light and tart enough to be refreshing, especially when cold, yet interesting and incredibly unique. I ran a Dieu du Ciel tasting today at my store's beer department and this was the first beer I used to reel people in, especially a few ladies not used to craft beer. This beer's uniqueness really makes me wonder why more people don't experiment with floral beers. I'd really like to try a saison brewed with lavender or something. Maybe someone could do an IPA with poppies, haha. There are lots of possibilities.","ZapRowsdower","Mar 07, 2011"

First of all this looks a bit like a well stocked sangria colour. this makes sense since it is a hibiscus beer. The foam is thin and like a typical big industry rice/corn lager. the scent also makes me think of fruit punch/sangria which is fine. there is nothing cloying here which is what I would be wary of. This does taste like beer. it is a good beer foundation with some sweetness and a vigorous fruit flavour. That being said it is very palatable even though it would not be my choice of a beer.

1.95,-48.8,2.5,2.5,2,2,1,"341ml bottle from the LCBO. Part of the Summer 2010 Beer Release. Pours a hazy and opaque pinkish rose with no head or lace. Aside from the unique colour, this beer looks boring. Smell is sweet malt, herbs, liquor, and flowers. Taste is tangy, salty, and mildly sour fruit, floral, leafy, and herbaceous hops, some spiciness on the palate, and a dryly parched finish. No wheat to speak of. Mouth feel is VERY tart and astringent, pushing toward cloying, with a weird and soapy saltiness in the aftertaste. Yuck! Perhaps Hibiscus will appeal to the anti-hop palates of mainstream Ontarians who don't actually enjoy craft beer. As for me, I find this to be an undrinkable, puckering fruit ale. Not worthy of attention.","cratez","Jun 21, 2010"
4.03,5.8,4.5,4,4,4,4,"Deep, saturated rose pink in colour. Extremely cloudy and turbid. A thin light pink head forms as I pour it then disappears right away. No lace. That hazy pink colour looks amazing. It smells of flowers, peaches, and fruit punch, very aromatic yet simple at the same time. Tastes fruity, floral, and mildly tart with some coriander and pepper. Berries. Not any particular kind of berries, but just berry-like. Light in body but not thin, soft carbonation and lots of particulate in suspension help it feel a bit smooth and creamy. Tangy and refreshing. This is a pretty interesting take on flavoured wheat beer, having more in common with a Witbier than with fruited American Wheats.","mintjellie","Jun 20, 2010"

The flavors were also very enjoyable, a blend of strawberry, pomegranate, wheat, lychee and a hint of alcohol heat. Sweet and floral with a low bitterness. Refreshing and unique!

Big coriander presence, has that post farmers market rotting vegatable smell. Not my cup of tea but that is what a Wit smells like to me. Some light fruit sweetness but the coriander just crushes everything. The taste has a light berry sweetness, a bit tart, followed by a floral presence from the hibiscus. Of course there is the coriander but it is, thankfully, muted by the other flavors. The finish is quite dry, and has a lemon edge to it. The feel is light with spritzy carbonation, finishes dry and astringent. An ok brew, definitely in the Wit style.

3.47,-8.9,4,4.5,3,3.5,3,"The pour reveals a light cascade of cloudiness. Though somewhat amber-like in appearance, a rosy haze permeates throughout, giving an overall blood orange visual. The nose is genuinely inviting, the hibiscus aromas asserting themselves just enough to be pleasing to the nostrils. But once the liquid hits the tongue it is clear that these initial bits of hope are ordained to remain in the realm of what could have been. The taste recalls a weak wit, with those hibiscus traces trying to assert themselves once again. Alas, the flowers only serve to give the beer a sort of whispy grapefruit quality, resulting in a weakly citrus take on Hoegaarden. This weakness is exacerbated by the weak, slightly overcarbonated body that effervesces on the tongue in a mildly annoying manner. Something akin to a light, citrusy ginger ale comes to mind, and to tongue. This is also how drinkable this beer is: good enough to allow it to be drunk, but not good enough to elicit too heavy a desire to consistently imbibe it. All-in-all, a so-so offering, but one with a good deal of promise.","TMoney2591","Jan 29, 2010"

Wheat beer base figures prominently with some spritziness in the mouth, cleansing citric acidity, a bit earthy in the finish. I expected a bit more spice, this has an earthiness to it. Lots of sediment. As it aired and flattened out, it took on a more rose like pink colour.

3.46,-9.2,4,3,3.5,3,4,"Pours a hazy pink, with a minimal, white head with a tint of pink. This color is from the addition of hibiscus petals during brewing. Some yeast sediment from the bottle came out at the end, as expected from a bottle-conditioned wheat beer. The nose has a distinct sour/citrus smell with hints of vinegar, tannin, green apple, and grassy notes. The taste is not as sour as I expected from the smell. This definitely has some wheat beer qualities with the citrus being a large presence. Grass and green apple show up as well as a perfume and floral quality with an herbal finish that hints at the hibiscus. This is a good tasting beer, it is a bit experimental and not something you would expect a beer to be but I think it is successful. The light body and effervescent carbonation, along with the flavor make for a refreshing, light and very tasty beer.","Lldeegan","Dec 26, 2009"

Overall this was definitely a unique beer; I had never really had hibiscus flavoring before. It was very clean tasting, and seemed light at first but grew wearisome toward the end of the bottle.

It smells like some kind of tropical fruit drink, I don't notice any malt or hop aromas in this brew. The taste is similar to the aroma, it's very tropical and floral but has some citrus in it too. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, with low carbonation. Drinkability is good, it's smooth and goes down easy. This is a pretty good summer beer, it's nice and very refreshing. I thought it was enjoyable. It's worth a try, I'd definitely drink it again.","bluejacket74","Aug 22, 2008"

3.81,0,4.5,3.5,4,4,3.5,"Lately I've been finding bottles from Brasserie Dieu Du Ciel here and there. This one was in Columbus for about $4.50. The beer is uniquely colored, a pale pink grapefruit color and very hazy with a thin head. The smell is toasted malts and some floral notes, apparently hibiscus flowers based on the bottle description. The taste is a little sweet upfront with some bitterness at the end, a nice floral flavor as well. The body is neutral to a little heavy, this is very good overall.","TurdFurgison","Aug 15, 2008"
3.95,3.7,4,4,4,3.5,4,"M + D: A little light... carbonation seems a touch low and not quite as crisp as it could be. Not too sure what is intended, though, so that may be the point. Certainly an interesting beer, if nothing else, and worth looking into to try, at least.","Proteus93","Aug 06, 2008"
3.82,0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3.5,"Pours a reddish hued amber with a thin white-ish head that falls fast. Nose is strong floral tones. Flavor is definitely influenced by hibiscus as there are a lot of floral tones going on, but there is also a citric sweetness as well. It's floral and a bit refreshing, but kind of odd really. It kind of reminds me of juice almost. Feel is low on carbonation and the liquid is interesting in it's sticky nature. Overall an interesting brew and an interesting drinking experience. Too interesting to justify going back to this another day.","RblWthACoz","Aug 01, 2008"
3.94,3.4,3,4,4,4,4,"Let's clear something up off the bat: this shouldn't be classed a Spice/Herb/Vegetable beer. It's a witbier. Lots of witbiers use mystery spices, and this one happens to use one that's pink. That said, it pours a slightly hazy pink-amber, with a thin, bubbly pink-tinged head. Aroma is yeast-spicy, with witbier-wheat aroma, tropical fruit (lychee), hibiscus, and coriander. Flavour is floral, with tropical fruit, strong phenolics, mild citrus. Slightly sour. Nice light silky mouthfeel. The hibiscus is very well integrated; in a black glass this would be classic witbier with a hint of something exotic. The main flaw as far as I'm concerned (in an otherwise wonderful beer) is the heavy phenolic profile. It's a testament to psychosomasis that so many are writing this witbier off as alcopop.","KaiMiller","Jul 27, 2008"
4.19,10,3.5,4.5,4,4,4.5,"I wasn't so sure of this beer at first but as I drink the flavors really unfold and it became a pleasant surprise. The use of hibiscus is something new to me and something I would actually like to try in a few other beers. I wouldn't hesitate to pick up Rosee d'Hibiscus again. This turned out to be an excellent beer and quite a surprise.","joe1510","Jul 25, 2008"

Decent mouthfeel, but strong fruity (berry?) smell and a very fruity taste that bordered on too sweet (and too sour).

Some bubblegum and some solvent type aromas as well. Taste is like a spicy Belgian brew. Some malty sweetness twisted with a bit of flower twang and some spicy funk. Mouthfeel and carbonation are medium/adequate. Definitely a different take on a Belgian style brew. Interesting, but probably not something I would seek out again.","johnnnniee","Jun 17, 2008"

The aroma is a sweet ros with a light touch of tart fresh cherries and earth. A hint o herbal wheat with some must roses slowly wilting away as it warms. The palate is tart with an overall earthy tone. Not bad to try, but not exceptional.","scruffwhor","Jun 15, 2008"

3.33,-12.6,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"Pours a light amber in color with red highlights and tones to it. Decent frothy head on the pour. Smell is I'm guessing the hibiscus flower that's added. It gives it a very acidic, tart cherry flavor and smell. This is a decent outdoors beer I enjoyed sitting on my back patio in the sun. Clean and crisp on the mouthfeel, this is an easy drinker. However, I feel I've had enough of the hibiscus flavor and one bottle is enough.","FtownThrowDown","Jun 06, 2008"

4.42,16,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5," Palate is again heavy on the floral character up front, with some light floral hops and crisp light malt and wheat. A mildly sweet fruity character comes through before the nice, dry finish. Body is crisp and not too thin, just right for the flavors involved here. An incredibly refreshing beer for a warm spring night, I'm glad I picked one of these up as soon as it came out.","ElGordo","May 15, 2008"
4,5,4,4,4,4,4,"This beer poured a cloudy amber color and formed an off white foamy head that coated the glass with lace as it subsided. An aroma of wheat, yeast, spices and flowers.

3.86,1.3,5,4,3.5,4,4,"Aroma of soft pepper and fresh spice. Wheat, and contiental malt shine but a light off setting perfumy flavor seems to be shadowing.
