3.69,18.6,,,,,,"Overall (3.69) : As far as fruit beers go, it's hard to find one that stands up to the definition of ""craft"". But this beer is pretty decent, and it probably gets a worse rep than it should. Shipyard Applehead is a beer you drink when you are in the mood for a beer, but also apples. This is not cloying or overly sweet, in fact it's more beer than it is apples. However if you want apples, it's there - and it will satisfy your craving for an apple flavored beer. I'd drink it again, I may even consider a six pack on sale. Decent brew. I feel like I've described this beer in the best ability I can. Gonna finish this one on the couch in front of the tube.","The-Adjunct-Hippie","Oct 03, 2014"

This makes Woody angry, and much like the incredible Hulk, when I get angry, I become even stronger! Inverted pour from a bottle?!? That is indicative of just how angry it made me. The two-plus fingers of ecru foam popped and fizzed like I had poured myself a glass of pop. Color was a deep, golden yellow (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-plus quality clarity, allowing me to see into the future. My reverie was interrupted by the Unholy Trio of Mammon, Midas and Croesus, all of whom wanted a taste. I took a deep sniff and the apple odor was so prevalent that I thought of Golden Delicious and when I said this, they ripped the glass from my hands and began chugging it in earnest! Too much gelt for me, so I opened another for myself. Mouthfeel was thin and watery, but the taste was like apple pie! Apples, certainly, but underlain with (at least) cinnamon. Wild and completely unexpected! The finish was dry, mostly because of the spice, but this was a very pleasant drink on a hot summer's day. I would recommend this on a seasonal basis, like right now.","woodychandler","Jun 25, 2014"

3.05,-1.9,3.25,3.25,3,2.75,3,"Looks like a carbonated apple juice, I believe amongst the Johnny Appleseed Ales, the Red's Apple Ale, and the AB version of Shocktop this was the trailblazer amongst the recent trend. It pours with a fizzy white head quickly fading to nothing not much lacing on the sides of my glass. Aroma has sweet candy apple upfront with some cinnamon spice to blend into a pseudo apple pie mix, I could picture locals here dropping apple pie moonshine boilermakers into this one. The flavor is spice heavy with cinnamon sitting on the palate through each sip, and not fresh ground cinnamon the one that's been in your mom's spice cabinet since you were a kid. Mouthfeel is pretty well carbonated, tickles the back of your throat becomes a bit hard to swallow within the first few sips. Lighter bodied beer from Shipyard, at least I'm not getting their Allen Pugsley signature house yeast notes, aka no butter to speak of here. Overall not too impressed and not as appalled as I thought I was going to be, worth a shot and hell I would try the moonshine boilermaker at least once.","WVbeergeek","Jun 21, 2014"

It's kind of an odd seasonal beer though; it doesn't seem to fit squarely into any one season. My thing with fruit beers is that I rarely get then urge to have them more than once. I don't want to disregard them all as ""gimmicky," but at the same time, the big draw is a ""What will this taste like?"" curiosity. This one fits that profile. It's a fun change of pace, but it's mostly just so-so.","illpass78","Mar 02, 2014"

Tastes like a dry apple pie, which is actually a good thing: too much sweetness would make it like a wine cooler. As it is, Applehead is actually a great alternative to an overly sweet wine cooler. The balance of apple and spice is excellent. There isn't much malt presence and the mouthfeel is predominately carbonation. What makes it fine are the apple flavor together with the cinnamon. There is only a slight hint of nutmeg, which is good. I recommend this on a warm day, maybe for a barbecue, as a nice quencher.","angusdegraosta","Mar 20, 2013"

Apple flavor was, appropriately, predominant, with a baked-red delicious apple character that was complimented by light brown sugar and cinnamon notes. Some faint malt notes toward the end state a claim that the beverage is a beer. Interesting, but the sort of beer that you are happy to split and then move on to something else. I like this as an alternative to the pumpkin beers as a fall seasonal. Something tells me this would go great with a leftover turkey sandwich.","Brent","Aug 13, 2012"

The flavors were indeed full of apples and cinnamon up front followed by a sweet malt center, some graininess from the wheat and then a finish where the cinnamon came back and seemed to linger. The whole experience was strangely like a cross between Apple Cinnamon Cheerios and beer. Curious. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation appropriate.

3.42,10,3,3.5,3.5,3,3.5,"This beer was something I had seen on here and made sure to keep my eyes open for it at my local shops. I finally managed to find a bottle of it at Abe's in Bethlehem and was rather excited to try it. The beer poured out as a clear yellow color with a fizzy white head. There was some very light lacing and minimal retention. The look of the beer didn't seem like a wheat ale to me at all, it was much to clear looking. The smell of the beer had some apple and cinnamon aromas that got me past the average look of the beer. The taste of the beer was decent, the apple and spice flavors were pretty dominant. I wasn't a big fan of how the malted wheat came through in the aftertaste too much. The mouthfeel of the beer was very light, moderate carbonation, a little on the watery side. Overall I like Apple flavored ale and such. I enjoyed this one but it wasn't the best one out there honestly.","Knapp85","Jan 15, 2012"

3.16,1.6,2,3.5,3.5,2,3,"O: This is a great dessert beer that manages to mimmic apple pie with the spices and apples and is easy to drink, but as a stand-alone ""pale wheat ale," this one is way off the mark. It is definitely more of a specialty beer that doesn't belong in any category, but could fit into the fruit beer section better than pale wheat ale. Certainly don't expect your typical American pale wheat ale when drinking this, because you won't find it anywhere in this beer","BEERMILER12","Jan 08, 2012"

3.77,21.2,3.5,4,4,3,3.5,"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, crystal clear, golden yellow coloring. On initial pour, there is a low profile, foamy white head, but that disappears very quickly. The nose is reminiscent of fresh baked apple pie, with a heavy dose of cinnamon and a toasty, bready quality. Flavors are heavy on the cinnamon as well, giving the light bodied beer an initial sharpness to it. Apple serves as the backbone, and it tastes like more of the red variety, including Macintosh, Braeburn, and Gala. Very tasty, and the sweetness does a good job avoiding the realm of tart. The spicing and sweetness does shift to a slight syrupy character at the very end of the palate. The aftertaste is toasty, but pastry toasty as opposed to bread toasty, with slight cinnamon spice present. The finish is light and subtle, with a slow regression of flavors. Interesting brew, and more subtle and unique than I initially thought it would be when the beer was announced.","GarthDanielson","Jan 05, 2012"

I'd take a four or six ounce serving with gusto, but 12 ounces, or (god forbid) a whole pint is just too much. Overall, this is a lot better than I expected though. The concept actually works. Don't expect many ""beery"" flavors though, but it's surely a lot more complex and enjoyable than a Smirnoff Ice Apple Twist or what have you. Taken on it's own merits, it's a pretty good beer.","shand","Dec 29, 2011"

3.18,2.3,4,3.5,3,3,3,"Overall: Normally I like session beers, but I feel this one could use the imperialization that their pumpkin beer did. That turned an undrinkable beer into a bold pumpkin ale. On the face of it, this is a lighter version of their pumpkin beer and with a slight touch of apple and even more cinnamon. It is way more drinkable than Pumpkinhead just because of its lightness and lack of any off tastes. I actually wish the sweet apple was brought out a bit more. This could be like 21st Amendment's Watermelon Ale if the fruity taste was allowed to shine. Instead what is left is a drinkable, but very easily passed over beer.","tigg924","Dec 17, 2011"

Orange colored body, with very little head. Not much carbonation, and no lacing. Smelled like a glass of fruit punch, which is not attractive for a beer. Taste was overpowered by the flavor of fake apple concentrate. It completely dominated the beer, and made this beer a one-note joke. Mouthfeel was overly sweet. I don't know why Shipyard would release such a monstrosity of a beer. If they wanted to brew up a cider, then bottle a cider. An apple flavored beer just does not work.","morebeergood","Dec 15, 2011"
