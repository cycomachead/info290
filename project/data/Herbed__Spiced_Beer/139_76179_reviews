"Overall - This does not even compare to Shipyard's Pumpkin brew.  I would not try this again nor recommend it to anyone unless they want to experiment with flavors"

"Great beer, had to try it since I love pumpkin head!"

"a very nice beer its fresh  crisp beer   enyoyable  a beer worth drinking"

"Overall (3.69) : As far as fruit beers go, it's hard to find one that stands up to the definition of ""craft"". But this beer is pretty decent, and it probably gets a worse rep than it should. Shipyard Applehead is a beer you drink when you are in the mood for a beer, but also apples. This is not cloying or overly sweet, in fact it's more beer than it is apples. However if you want apples, it's there - and it will satisfy your craving for an apple flavored beer. I'd drink it again, I may even consider a six pack on sale. Decent brew. I feel like I've described this beer in the best ability I can. Gonna finish this one on the couch in front of the tube."

"Another f**king screw-top! I am wasting my mad cap-popping skills on these things. This makes Woody angry, and much like the incredible Hulk, when I get angry, I become even stronger! Inverted pour from a bottle?!? That is indicative of just how angry it made me. The two-plus fingers of ecru foam popped and fizzed like I had poured myself a glass of pop. Color was a deep, golden yellow (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-plus quality clarity, allowing me to see into the future. My reverie was interrupted by the Unholy Trio of Mammon, Midas and Croesus, all of whom wanted a taste. I took a deep sniff and the apple odor was so prevalent that I thought of Golden Delicious and when I said this, they ripped the glass from my hands and began chugging it in earnest! Too much gelt for me, so I opened another for myself. Mouthfeel was thin and watery, but the taste was like apple pie! Apples, certainly, but underlain with (at least) cinnamon. Wild and completely unexpected! The finish was dry, mostly because of the spice, but this was a very pleasant drink on a hot summer's day. I would recommend this on a seasonal basis, like right now."

"Looks like a carbonated apple juice, I believe amongst the Johnny Appleseed Ales, the Red's Apple Ale, and the AB version of Shocktop this was the trailblazer amongst the recent trend. It pours with a fizzy white head quickly fading to nothing not much lacing on the sides of my glass. Aroma has sweet candy apple upfront with some cinnamon spice to blend into a pseudo apple pie mix, I could picture locals here dropping apple pie moonshine boilermakers into this one. The flavor is spice heavy with cinnamon sitting on the palate through each sip, and not fresh ground cinnamon the one that's been in your mom's spice cabinet since you were a kid. Mouthfeel is pretty well carbonated, tickles the back of your throat becomes a bit hard to swallow within the first few sips. Lighter bodied beer from Shipyard, at least I'm not getting their Allen Pugsley signature house yeast notes, aka no butter to speak of here. Overall not too impressed and not as appalled as I thought I was going to be, worth a shot and hell I would try the moonshine boilermaker at least once."

"It is on the thinner side, not simply light-bodied but lacking a little. Crispness stays firm and consistent, keeping up nicely."

"Overall: I had this with an arepa and yucca fries and it was a decent complement to the meal. It's kind of an odd seasonal beer though; it doesn't seem to fit squarely into any one season. My thing with fruit beers is that I rarely get then urge to have them more than once. I don't want to disregard them all as ""gimmicky," but at the same time, the big draw is a ""What will this taste like?"" curiosity. This one fits that profile. It's a fun change of pace, but it's mostly just so-so."
"Like a bunch of seltzer water with some apple juice in it, plus a bunch of cinnamon. Weak. Not a lot going on here. Nice smell. But if I really wanted a hard cider, I probably should've just got a hard cider. Not as good as their pumpkin ale. Have yet to be wowed by a Shipyard."
""
""
"What makes this even more disappointing was that Shipyard released it as a winter seasonal...there is nothing winter about this and that distinction could have been used on something far more interesting."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle/ Has a golden color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of cinnamon and apples. Taste is strong of cinnamon, maybe a little to much, some apples, easy drinking. Feels light in the mouth and although I would not want this on a regular basis, it makes for an interesting change of pace."
"O: Recommended if you like fruit beers. I certainly do enjoy the addition of fruit. To hell with the Reinheitsgebot. Definitely worth a try."
""
""
""
""
""
"This is my second beer by these guys. Kind of a cool idea as a follow-up to pumpkin head. Doesn't really work as well though. The apple flavor isn't very strong, which is probably a good thing, if you wanted that you could just go get a hard cider somewhere I suppose. Lighter copper color, apple aroma. Not for me."
""
""
"O- not a fan of this one. I'm all for fruit beers, but they should at least have some beer elements to them"

"A great spring ale. Often mistaken for cider, this beer is lightly flavorful, delightfully crisp and tart just like the spring air. The appearance is clear and bright, however the ale leaves very little lacing around the glass. Not for the IPA crowd but a great tasty beer, especially for cider lovers."

"The Rest: Not bad, basically a spiced cider. I could see drinking a few on a nice, fall day."

"its called applehead where is the apple nonexsistent instead we get horrible spice taste in a waterey beer wanted more. first beer from this brewery may never buy there products again.trying to get this to 250 charcters but cant say much didnt like this and will never buy it again app okay smell taste mouthfeel all poor"
"It has the consistency of club soda and the stuff is fizzy. It has the taste of club soda with a few crumbs of apple pie. Overall, it comes across with a weaker apple but stronger cinnamon taste. It is hard to fathom why this ale was produced. Personally, I would rather have a nice slice of home made apple pie for dessert and wash it down with a European style pilsner."

"The beer pours a golden color with a 1/2"" fizzy white head that quickly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a sweet, apple pie aroma that boasts of pale malts and a good deal of apple character. The taste is average. It has a light, pale and wheat malt flavor along with a somewhat artificial apple pie taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate/good carbonation. This is an interesting beer that's worthy as a rotating seasonal."
""
""
""
"Personally, I like apple-cinn things to be sweet, and just as Applejacks (cereal) isn't quite sweet enough to satisfy, I get the same overall feel from Applehead. Not that I would want this beer to be overly sweet, but the flavor is just underwhelming."
""
""
"Overall: a very refreshing session-able beer. it would pare great with bratwurst defiantly one of my favorite shipyard beers"

"The head fizzes out quick, but the smell has plenty of the cinnamon and nutmeg spice in it. Tastes like a dry apple pie, which is actually a good thing: too much sweetness would make it like a wine cooler. As it is, Applehead is actually a great alternative to an overly sweet wine cooler. The balance of apple and spice is excellent. There isn't much malt presence and the mouthfeel is predominately carbonation. What makes it fine are the apple flavor together with the cinnamon. There is only a slight hint of nutmeg, which is good. I recommend this on a warm day, maybe for a barbecue, as a nice quencher."

"Apple pie in a glass. Who doesn't love a good apple pie?"

"12oz. bottle: This one pours a hazy, darker golden color. There was a small white head on it that didn’t linger long. Spice is the main component of the aroma, almost a cross between apple and pumpkin pie. Some wheat notes also. The taste is different. Definitely a taste of crisp apples. A bit of wheat and cinnamon. It’s not bad, I’m just not sure I could drink too many of these."
""
""
"O: Light beer with tart apple flavors. Interesting concept and worth trying once - just not something I would drink on a regular basis."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Surprisingly good with great balance across both the flavor profile and mouthfeel. Really nice job for a brew below 5% abv."
""
"I feared an apple-flavored malt beverage, but I was surprised at how much I liked this beer. Light body but not watery. Apple flavor was, appropriately, predominant, with a baked-red delicious apple character that was complimented by light brown sugar and cinnamon notes. Some faint malt notes toward the end state a claim that the beverage is a beer. Interesting, but the sort of beer that you are happy to split and then move on to something else. I like this as an alternative to the pumpkin beers as a fall seasonal. Something tells me this would go great with a leftover turkey sandwich."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - Meh. Fairly gimmicky. Doesn't have a whole lot of ""beer"" qualities about it. It's drinkable, but not necessarily all that enjoyable. Bought it because it's $3 a sixer at Trader Joe's."
""
""
""
"Overall: not a bad brew, certainly not one of my favorites, but I will drink it if it is offered."
""

"It sure is apple infused, with some cinnamon vibes. Better than apple soda, but not really comparable to a good cider."
"O - A very good beer indeed, the good massively outweighed the bad, and made for one unique and very tasty beverage. The apple beer is a good alternative to the typical hard apple ciders I see popping up everywhere, and wow do they pack a lot more flavor than those ciders do. Definitely a must-try for any fan of hard cider or apple jack cereal, you will not be disappointed."
""
"Apple pie isn't my favorite pie flavor, but it still makes for a decent beer. Really, this beer is almost like a cider in a lot of ways. Might try it again some time when the mood strikes."
""
""
""
"O - Doesn't taste like beer which would be good for those who like sweeter, lighter, and crisper beers. I do like how crisp it is but the artificial flavoring was too much, maybe dial it down and make it more subtle and infuse a little bitterness so the sugary sweetness isn't the dominating sensation. I'm not the appropriate audience for this product and as creative as it is, I had to dump it and scrub my palette."
""
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a clear orange with no head at all. Nose is full of cinnamon and apples. It’s like apple pie in a glass. Crisp clean mouthfeel. Lots of spice up front - nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. Mildly tart apple on the finish. Not a bad dessert beer here, but not the best Apple Ale out there. I wouldn’t turn it down though."
"The smell of apples spices could knock your socks off. This was a very pleasant surprise. The taste was exactly what the aroma was. The apple and spices was very evident. There was apples and spices was well balanced. From the first to last sip or gulp showed a soft and mellow feel in the mouth. I ended up buying a case and enjoy every drop with friends."
""
""
""
"Overall - This was pretty good. Nice to try something different. It's not overly spicy like most similar beers. It kind of reminds me of a more mild winter warmer ale."
""
""
""
"To me, this is a very odd beer. I guess that you have to be raised with this apple pie flavours to really appreciate it."
""
""
""
"I poured this beer into a pint glass. It has a nice golden color body with a small fizzy head that disappears quickly. The smell is of granny smith apples. The taste is like a apple pie, apple flavor and some cinnamon on the back of the tongue. very easy mouth feel, well carbonated and overall a nice beer."
"O: Quite interesting, but not that great."
""
"Overall: The apple is nicely applied and not too sweet. Not a regular beer to have often but I was expecting worse."
"Pours a slightly hazy honey orange with a 1 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is somewhat like one of those apple flavored snack pies. Taste is of watery apple cider mixed with some overbearing cinnamon/clove spice flavors. There is a slightly bitter spice finish with each sip. This beer has a pretty good level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a middle of the road fruit flavored beer that is better than Pumpkinhead but not something I would to get again."
""
"O: Overall an American pale wheat that drinks like a pale pumpkin. Very sweet and cloying as to limit repeats. All around average."
""
"O-After a few gulps it actually gets better but the dominance of the apple spice overrides the beer flavor."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I do not like it. It was a great effort, but it simply does not taste good. Their Pumpkinhead is much better."
""
""
""
"Pours a one finger white head that vanishes quickly to a ring leaving no lace. Chrystal clear light amber color. Light carbonation and light-medium bodied. Strong spicy apple cider nose, flavor is similar - cinnamon apple cider and sweet. Checked the label to make sure I bought beer - says its an ale. Would make a good lawn mower beverage and not much else. $1.75 for a 12oz bottle from Bert’s Better Beers Hooksett, NH."
""
""
"High C-"
"O - A very nice brew. Would love a few more of these."
"Overall – not a bad-tasting brew…interesting, but not terribly appealing on a long term scale."
""
"12oz bottle purchased at Market Basket in Somersworth. Pours a hazy golden with less than a half inch of off-white head. Apple dominates the aroma. Sweet and sour apple dominate the flavor too, as expected, with spice notes as well. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Sweet and pleasant, thus rather drinkable. A bit of a one note beer (which the name would suggest), but not bad overall."
""
""
""
""
"O- Disappointing. Honestly, I got this since the liquor store was closing and I was curious. I was kinda hoping that this beer would have a light apple and cinnamon flavor with that lovely wheat element. The beer and apple aspect gets completely lost among the spices. It didn't taste offensive, but not one I will be buying again."
""
""
""
""
"Out of a bottle this beer was a perfectly clear, golden color with one finger of slightly lemon-tinted head. The retention was good and it left lacing in spots of the sliding collar. The aroma was of apples, crystal malt, cookie dough and a hint of cinnamon. The flavors were indeed full of apples and cinnamon up front followed by a sweet malt center, some graininess from the wheat and then a finish where the cinnamon came back and seemed to linger. The whole experience was strangely like a cross between Apple Cinnamon Cheerios and beer. Curious. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium and the carbonation appropriate. An interesting fall beer but really more like a cider. Or a bowl of cereal."
""
"From the 12 oz. bottle dated Oct 12. Sampled on March 22, 2012. It pours golden yellow about the color of apple juice. The fizzy head erupts quickly and then diminishes. The aroma is really overwhelmed by apple crisp and cinnamon but at the same time there is a clean hoppiness in the rear. The body is about medium yet creamy and smooth. The taste is quite appled up with a semi-tart ending that rescues it a little. Too much apple for my liking but well-crafted nonetheless."
""
""
""
"One and done."
"The less one drinks of this, the more they will like it. 12 oz was too much."
""
"Not a huge fan of the Pumpkinhead, but this was in the fridge and free so.. I'll give it a try. Pours a cloudy yellow color, smells like apples and cinnamon. Taste is light to medium bodied.. first thought is liquid apple pie. Surprisingly, it still remains drinkable and I can see this being a polarizing beer with many haters. Interesting to say the least, seems like more of a gimmicky beer but it was a unique one to try. Different, not necessarily a good beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Instantly forgettable, surprisingly Pumpkinhead blows this once out of the water, which is saying something."
"O - Seems out of place labeled as a wheat beer. But it is tasty for what it is. A nice apple beer."
""
"O - this was a great idea for a beer. glad they went through with it. very refreshing and crisp, sweet but not TOO sweet, fruity but not TOO fruity."
"Ov: Bland, boring and not worth trying a second time. I let everyone else drink the rest. No thanks."
"O: Overall I don't think this is a bad beer, sure it may be a bit gimmicky, and over the top with spice, but I don't particularly mind it. It would be interesting as a theme beer, or perhaps to cook with. Unfortunately I don't see buying this beer regularly, more of an 'entertainment value' type of beer."
"I'm not going to diss. I'm not going to rate super high, either. Not my style, plain and simple. But, this would be an enjoyable spring or fall offering. Sessionable and crisp. If you really want to mull it over, there are nice little nuances amidst the imperfections. It's just a beer that drinks decent and tastes pretty good. Nothing more to it than that."
""
""
""
"Overall this is as bad as Pumpkinhead. What an abomination. Still, Shipyard will probably make a killing off this beer."
"O: I will give Shipyard credit for trying something new, but it just doesn't work. The taste is just a combination of flavors that don't work together and I ended up drain pouring this one pretty quickly."
""
"T: Pretty much follows the smell. Tastes like an apple pie. Lots of sweet apple pie filling, spiced apple and cinnamon with some bready yeast and buttery pie crust on the finish. The yeast comes out a bit too much as this warms, but this was actually a pleasant surprise overall."
""
""
""
""
"Overall pretty much a ladies beer (no offense to the real beer drinking women), barely any actual beer in there just apple juice, cinnamon, and sugar, giving a bit of an apple pie"
""
""
""
"Overall this is an interesting novelty beer. This would of course be the perfect beer for apple pie."
""
""
""
"It does have a nice pie crusty flavor. You can just taste the part of the crust where the juice gets baked on. What you can do with cinnamon! But at least it's not the overkill of a lot of holiday spiced ales. The apple flavor is quite decent as well."
"Overall: Reminds me a little bit of a white wine. This brew is like an apple pie with a lot of carbonation and malt. I enjoyed it but could not drink more than one at a time. Bought a six pack for the wife. She enjoyed it as well. Cheers."
""
"Overall: Akin to their Pumpkinhead, as I'm sure anybody could guess (as well as my morningtime oatmeal), though carrying across more of its namesake flavoring. Refreshing and fairly light in alcohol, it delivered what I expected from it."
""
"This was decent for what it is. My only real complaint is that the yeast gets to be a bit too intrusive in the taste at times (shocking, I know). This isn’t bad or anything but it’s probably not something that I’d be buying a whole six-pack of either."
""
"A good beer only if you like something that doesn't even resemble beer. It's not a malt beverage but you can't taste anything other than the apple pie. Worth a try at the very least."
""
""
""
"Apple and cinnamon aroma right off the bat. Clear solid amber color with a one finger head than goes down fast. The apple and cinnamon are not surprisingly in the flavor too though not overwhelmingly. Faint sourness in the middle which then trails off to a clean finish. High carbonation gives it a refreshing mouth feel. Worth a try."
"Poured a 1.5"" champagne colored head of fine velvet, but within a couple minutes had completely dissipated. The body is a clear straw yellow, looks pretty much like BMC except more effervescent. The smell is essentially a mild apple cider juice. Taste is interesting. Yes it does have apple but more along the mostly dry alcoholic apple cider lines, and there's some spicing I think is nutmeg. More of a cider than a beer though. And the body is very light, but the apple and spice in the finish give it a pretty long finish. Anyway, not a star, but easily drinkable."
"O: I'm pretty disappointed with this beer. The flavor is nearly there, but everything else is just off. The worst part of it, is that I love cider...and I've had tons of ciders that have better body than this beer :("
""
""
"O - Why do I keep doing this to myself? I've not yet had an enjoyable Shipyard brew, I dunno why I though a slapped-together *apple beer* would be any different. Avoid, unless you actually like Pumpkinhead for some reason."
""
""
""
""
""
"This stuff is unholy. I don't think I'll finish this. It's just bad. Save your money gang."
"O - This has decent drinkability. It goes down easy, and I could easily have a few in a night. I really just expected more out of the flavor, and I really think it would have benefited if the body was more full. The end result of this beer is a mildly interesting, but overall mediocre beer. It is better than Pumpkin Head though."
"Overall a very unique beer. Nothing I would drink on a regular basis but a nice compilation of complex flavors that form a rather drinkable brew."
""
"D: A wheat beer this is not. My only question is why. Why was this brewed? Why are people buying this? Shipyard is synonymous with fail"
"Overall, its not horrible, but its just average. Nice and unique for sure, but I wouldnt buy a whole 6-pack; at least not until the fall - if still available. I also think its strange that it was released in December through spring?? This is deff a fall brew!!"
"A very tasty beer that reminds me of fall. Apple taste isn't really that strong. Cinnamon, clove, and rich malt really make this worth a try. Delicious but not a top runner."
"O: The beer goes down very easily because it is light-bodied and isn’t too sweet. Maybe it’s a good introductory beer for someone to try instead of hard cider."
""
""
""

"This beer was something I had seen on here and made sure to keep my eyes open for it at my local shops. I finally managed to find a bottle of it at Abe's in Bethlehem and was rather excited to try it. The beer poured out as a clear yellow color with a fizzy white head. There was some very light lacing and minimal retention. The look of the beer didn't seem like a wheat ale to me at all, it was much to clear looking. The smell of the beer had some apple and cinnamon aromas that got me past the average look of the beer. The taste of the beer was decent, the apple and spice flavors were pretty dominant. I wasn't a big fan of how the malted wheat came through in the aftertaste too much. The mouthfeel of the beer was very light, moderate carbonation, a little on the watery side. Overall I like Apple flavored ale and such. I enjoyed this one but it wasn't the best one out there honestly."
"O: not a terrible beer but I'm not a fan. I do think they've accomplished what they've set out to do. I personally couldn't/wouldn't drink very many of these but I suppose it's easy drinking enough that people could. Don't recommend particularly."
""
""
""
""
"M + D: I suppose it would make sense that it would be a refreshing beer, and that's certainly the case. Some of the food pairings suggested make it seem like a good beer for the season, but I really think this would be far more appropriate in warmer weather... maybe the end of summer, rolling into fall, while apples are coming into season. Nonetheless, a pretty decent beer, and worth at least a try!"
"And a too short, watery finish is not the way to support what has been done."
"O: this is the apple version of Shipyard's ""Pumpkinhead."" Even though it is a bit like an ""apple pie," it is easy to drink"
"Appearance is gold with a nice white foam. The smell is strong with apple and cinnamon, leaving out any hints of beer. Taste is very apple pie, reminds us very much of a cider. The feel on the mouth is very good leaving well and holding the flavor while drinking. Overall this is something you need to be in the mood for. If you are looking for Beer, we say skip the Applehead. This is a great holiday brew. A once in a while type drink. Not our thing."
"O: This is a great dessert beer that manages to mimmic apple pie with the spices and apples and is easy to drink, but as a stand-alone ""pale wheat ale," this one is way off the mark. It is definitely more of a specialty beer that doesn't belong in any category, but could fit into the fruit beer section better than pale wheat ale. Certainly don't expect your typical American pale wheat ale when drinking this, because you won't find it anywhere in this beer"
""
""
""
"O/D-Really not bad. Very mild and easy to imbibe. Just like Pumpkinhead but hey, the beer sells so why not wring out all the value you can with the gimmick."
"O - Awesome brew! Can't wait for the imperial version, hopefully it comes. Another awesome shipment from Andyavalance, a great brew from a great trader. The GF loved it."
""
""
""
"Poured from a bottle into a tumbler pint, the beer is a vibrant, crystal clear, golden yellow coloring. On initial pour, there is a low profile, foamy white head, but that disappears very quickly. The nose is reminiscent of fresh baked apple pie, with a heavy dose of cinnamon and a toasty, bready quality. Flavors are heavy on the cinnamon as well, giving the light bodied beer an initial sharpness to it. Apple serves as the backbone, and it tastes like more of the red variety, including Macintosh, Braeburn, and Gala. Very tasty, and the sweetness does a good job avoiding the realm of tart. The spicing and sweetness does shift to a slight syrupy character at the very end of the palate. The aftertaste is toasty, but pastry toasty as opposed to bread toasty, with slight cinnamon spice present. The finish is light and subtle, with a slow regression of flavors. Interesting brew, and more subtle and unique than I initially thought it would be when the beer was announced."
""
""
""
""
"The mouthfeel is nice and light, with a bit of drying on the end. The drinkability does suffer here though, as expected. The first 4.5% alcohol brew that I'd ever call a sipper. I'd take a four or six ounce serving with gusto, but 12 ounces, or (god forbid) a whole pint is just too much. Overall, this is a lot better than I expected though. The concept actually works. Don't expect many ""beery"" flavors though, but it's surely a lot more complex and enjoyable than a Smirnoff Ice Apple Twist or what have you. Taken on it's own merits, it's a pretty good beer."
""
""
""
"I'll stick with my yearly Pumpkinhead."
"Overall: Normally I like session beers, but I feel this one could use the imperialization that their pumpkin beer did. That turned an undrinkable beer into a bold pumpkin ale. On the face of it, this is a lighter version of their pumpkin beer and with a slight touch of apple and even more cinnamon. It is way more drinkable than Pumpkinhead just because of its lightness and lack of any off tastes. I actually wish the sweet apple was brought out a bit more. This could be like 21st Amendment's Watermelon Ale if the fruity taste was allowed to shine. Instead what is left is a drinkable, but very easily passed over beer."
""
"I was at a company Xmas party, and there was an open bar. I figured I'd try a pint of this, because I knew that I'd never pay for this beer. Orange colored body, with very little head. Not much carbonation, and no lacing. Smelled like a glass of fruit punch, which is not attractive for a beer. Taste was overpowered by the flavor of fake apple concentrate. It completely dominated the beer, and made this beer a one-note joke. Mouthfeel was overly sweet. I don't know why Shipyard would release such a monstrosity of a beer. If they wanted to brew up a cider, then bottle a cider. An apple flavored beer just does not work."
""
"D: Tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style when you consider that it’s simply Pumpkinhead only with apples instead."
""
"The pour gave little to no head, the smell was less apple and more of a stale cider. The slight apple after taste is the best thing I can say about this very dry attempt at a apple ale."
""
""
"This beer will certainly appeal to a certain crowd. It's a curious brew, and not one that I will revisit."
