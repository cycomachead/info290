"12oz bottle served in a chalice.  Beer pours cola brown, crystal clear, and with no appreciable head.  Smells like the aforementioned molasses cookies.  Tastes like a highly carbonated version of the same.  Actual ginger flavor here is, to my palate, too washed out, like all too much bad gingerbread.  And unfortunately this beer hasn't got much else going for it.  Mid-grade over-gassed molasses cookie beer."

"This brew is pretty tame and subtle. It is not a good value and I will avoid it in the future."
""
"O: It's what you might expect from a gingerbread stout, minus the roasty flavors. It's pretty good, but it would likely benefit from the admixture of roasted malt."
""
""
"O: good but may improve with a little aging."
"I'm a fan of pumpkin beers and that's what this beer reminded me of, since gingerbread and pumpkin spice contain some of the same spices. In actuality, this beer didn't remind me enough gingerbread. I did enjoy the lightness of the beer but if it was a bit creamier or had more of a ginger flavor, I think I would have enjoyed it better."

"D: A very nice holiday beer, great flavors good ABV. Perfect for the season, well worth looking for."

"Pours an opaque dark brown with a massive head that laces and retains very well. Nose is like a weak porter with ginger added. Some hint of dark malts is present, but very subdued. The body barely makes it past the light category. Very well carbonated, which helps bring forth what flavor is there. Like the nose, dark malt flavor is subdued resulting in a profile that is mostly ginger. While not overpowering, it is rather mild, the ginger needs to be balanced with a background malt flavor profile. The finish is somewhat crisp with a residual weak ginger astringency. Not a bad beer, but it could be improved upon."

"O- not bad, but not great."
"I love anything gingerbread, so I thought this would be my new favorite beer, but I honestly didn't taste anything resembling gingerbread. If you're on the fence about trying this, I'd say to pass. I couldn't even finish my bottle, which is rare."

"It wasn't the worst. And if Raul could compliment it, it actually tasted similar and a bit better than Newcastle. But unlike Katy Perry, this thing didn't make Raul ""Ro-o-o-o-o-o-oar!"""

"The taste - what there is - comes across as bland with a minor trickle of apple and bubble gum that is stalked by a shallow spot of malt, one that is either lost or unqualified for a real beer. The mouthfeel is a cross between being harsh and spectacurlarly underwhelming. Bison Brewing. What did the bison ever do to you?"
"This beer was terrible, watery and flavourless. This is the 2nd bison organic beer I've had and they've both been awful. This is a drain pour, glad I only got 1 bottle."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The taste is pretty much non-existant. I don't taste ginger, cinnamon, malt, nutmeg, or even beer. This was the first beer I tried from Bison. I would be reluctant to buy another."
""
"Decent brew, I like the addition of the ginger, cinnamon, and other holiday spices."
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer is very well put together. It was interesting to try. It's basically like a winter warmer ale with a twist."
"Interesting concept, I could only drink one and feel like I didn't eat a big ol' plate of cookies though."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: I'm glad I tried this beer, although it turned out to not be my cup of tea. It tastes kind of like a pumpkin beer without the pumpkin, so if that sounds like what you are looking for then it may be worth a try."
"O - Ok, but not as tasty as I was hoping for. Pass on this one."
"Bison Gingerbread Ale pours brown with next to no head. The aroma is full of holiday spices, with ginger taking the forefront. The taste... well. The taste doesn't just quite work. I taste the porter base, and I taste the spices, but they never come together at all. Instead, it's like taking a swig of ginger beer, sprinkling a little nutmeg in, and chasing it with the most generic porter body imaginable. The mouthfeel is weak and watery, and the drinkability is alright. Overall, Bison's Gingerbread Ale is just a slightly below average beer. It's drinkable, but never really reaches enjoyable."
""
"Had this at the Parkway tavern in Tacoma. Dark garnet mahogany in color with a whitish head. Slightly spicy aromatics. Ginger does seem to be prevalent in the flavor along with some other spices, cinnamon and nutmeg perhaps. Malty and medium bodied. Not bad. Not too sweet or too bitter. As with many herbal and/or spiced beers, couldn't have more than one or two of these without getting sick of it."
""

""

""

""
""
"O - a decent porter with a holiday touch."
""
""
""
"Pours a dark brownish black color with a light tan head with good retention and lacing. The aroma is holiday spices and dark roasted malts. The taste like the aroma is dark roasted malts up front with some sweetness and the spices coming through in the finish. The mouthfeel is light bodied with a good amount if carbonation. Overall, not a bad little holiday porter that is worth a try."
""
""
""
"A good holiday beer that I will be drinking again."
""
"good taste, i like this."
""
"Overall not worth getting and very disappointed since this has been on my tick list for a while. Not very gingerbread tasting at all, just a spiced weak porter."
"Overall, decent, but nothing to rave about. I doubt I'll buy it again, but I wouldn't turn one down if it were offered."
"O: I found this to be a very enjoyable holiday beer and really thought it was probably the best beer I have had from this brewery. I like the addition of the gingerbread spices and think it really hits on that flavor profile. Fairly easy to drink."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A good beer - not finding the gingerbread in here, but other flavors bopping around in there ."
""
"Pours an almost opaque super dark brown with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Thin rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, and some mild spice aromas. Taste is much the same with the spices coming through as more earthy than sweet. There is a mild roasty and spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but more earthy than I was expecting."
""
""
"O: It’s not like I didn’t enjoy this one…I guess I can’t complain too much, then. It’s no gingerbread beer, but it sure satisfied my roast-loving taste buds."
""
""
""
""
""
"The ginger in this one edges very close to becoming overbearing. I could use more roast to back it up. Good idea, but something was missed in the execution."
""
""
"O - Smooth and drinkable spiced beer. If only it is slightly cheaper."
""
"Flipping through the pages of the local brew pub and the synopsis of this Bison Gingerbread Ale caught my eye. Now it being after Valentine's Day I was still ready to pucker up to this spicy note driven brew. Wow, the smell was incredible. My partner drinking with me had three separate sips from the glass we were sharing before I was ready to relieve my nose from the empty bottle. Then I had my first sip...initially the mouthfeel was Christmas time all over again, but within seconds I had snapped out of my flashback. My scores reflect my excitement as I watched the ale being poured and then handed the bottle. My overall score is my confusion of how fast that taste was gone. Luckily ever sip it comes back, but at $5.50 a 12 oz. bottle...I am just glad I tried it."
"Medium bodied, this beer would have served well on Xmas Eve waiting for Santa to come down the chimney... that is if he got by the blazing stove."
""
""
""
"Overall: A nice beer. The Organic label scares me more than attracts me, but this comes off with just a hint of rain water and unwashed tin."
"Overall, not a bad beer for what it is, but the acrid malt flavor is offputting. I'm not a ginger fan, so not my fave, but..."
""
"O: Its ok and above average, but not as gingerbread/ginger snap forward as I would like, plus the finish is disjointed and a little unpleasant...watery bitterness washes away all of the good aspects of the beer."
"D: This was not that great of a beer, with the ginger character not mixing well with the porter base. The body was pretty weak too. It wasn't difficult to drink, but it wasn't very enjoyable either. Not recommended."
"Taste-Soft flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg, and gingerbread. Rather thin-bodied and seems to go flat in a hurry. More of ""everything"" would greatly help things out here. Decent at best. Maybe for washing down some real gingerbread cookies."
"I poured this interesting beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. The beer was nearly black and poured a really nice tan colored head. The smell was spicy and so was the taste. Definitely could taste the ginger and other holiday spices in this one but it was not so strong that is blowed you away. I would buy again."
"Single finger head with nice lacing on a a dark body with reddish hues. The aroma is of light ginger bread and I was hoping for more. The tasting left much to be desired. This Ed a very watered down beer with malt and mild gingerbread notes. Kind of disappointing. Some bitterness to the finish. Medium body and moderate carbonation. Overall I expected a lot more out of this beer BUT it is organic so taking that into cOnsideration I must rate it as such."
"O - I was hoping for a pleasant experience only to be disappointed. This beer is overspiced for my liking. I keep trying to imagine gingerbread, but I can't make that stretch."
""
""
""
""
""
"Mainly a decent porter with a ton of spice smell and a touch of spice once it hits your mouth. Not a bad choice to pair with the hedonistic inhaling of freshly baked holiday cookies."
""
"O-interesting. more of a novelty beer than anything. fun to drink but i'm not about to buy any more."
"Overall: Not bad, but I think that 4 Calling Birds, as far as being a beer brewed with gingerbread, is (obviously?) the superior offering. I like the creativity, though, and I can get behind Bison's intentions of being all organic, so I am not opposed to drinking it again. Not something I would go out of my way for, but if it's available, and the price is still right, it will make its way to my fridge again."
"Drinkability - my first bottle of this I didn't care much for. Tonight, after baking up several dozen gingerbread cookies, I took another crack at it and liked it much better. Could use more breadiness - it doesn't hit me as a full on gingerbread beer, but it's got enought to merit some holiday props. Nice job, Bison."
"Light body, a good amount of carbonation. Alcohol is hidden well. Overall, not as interesting as it sounds. Disappointing."
""
"O: This beer is disappointing because it could be a great winter beer. Bison should really take a step back and rework it. Maybe try an imperial version?"
"Overall, drinkable but not as interesting as the concept."
"Tastes wonderful, at first. Like you're biting into a gingerbread man, just about, with pumpkin pie spices mixed with surprisingly strong nodes of burny ginger. But then the spice nodes just drop away, as if into the aether, and are replaced with a rather generic, heavily malty beeriness. The break is disconcerting, and the back end really drags down the front."
"Bison Gingerbread- If you put it on the label, it shoudl taste like it, low aromas, low ginger flavor, but there, dark brown ale. we had a large xmas beer tasting. this was a solid beer but when you put gingerbread on the label you should make that noticeale."
""
"Overall- it's not for me."
""
"Appears a deep dark almost black hue with some mahogany brown highlights coming through the dark color of the body this beer has. Head forms thick, foaming khaki tan head forms fine even lacing as it dwindles down. Aroma is super spiced especially after finishing an Anchor OSA with the subtle spice this one is really popping with Christmas spices. Nutmeg, ginger, allspice, cinnamon with caramelized sugars and a touch of dark roasted malts. Flavor is really harsh with spices, dark roasts, and a slightly burnt roasted malt coffee accent. It clashes with the base beer which is an organic porter. Wtih my next few sips I'm starting to adjust with the high level of spices and dark roasted malts, minimal herbal hops are masked by those spice additions. Mouthfeel is medium bodied finishes super dry with the bitterness from the spice additions. Overall a decent Christmas beer experience I'm glad I just picked up a bottle, good in small quantities, definitely a specialty holiday ale."
""
"Overall, a pretty solid beer that does have the promised gingerbread effect, but I would like it to be sweeter with a bit bigger body."
"Overall: It's a good beer but nothing great. One of those beers that if it's cheap enough I could drink it all the time"
"O: This beer had a great aroma but was let down by a lackluster taste and feel. With some work in these aspects, this beer could be quite good. As it is right now, it is just slightly above average."
"Final Notes: A solid run-of-the-mill porter. It's slightly spiced but I don't think quite enough to consider it a spiced beer. I did enjoy it, but would have liked some more kick."
"The aroma was far too light to be really noticeable. Lots of citrus hops here and a nice touch of light spices, mostly pepper, but again it was just not strong enough to really set itself apart from anything. The flavor again was light, spices, citrus, and a touch of pepper all mingling about. Very light feel here now as the flavors were all gone far too quickly."
"Pours a clear very dark reddish brown, almost black in color. Smells unsuprisingly like gingerbread cookies. Taste is sweet dough up front, followed by a little caramel and ginger, and finishing with a citrusy chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, low carbonation. Drinkability is ok, the flavor while good gets a bit cloying after awhile as the beer sticks to the back of your tongue. An interesting beer nonetheless."
"D- The novelty of a beer that tastes this much like a gingerbread cookie makes this an anticipated seasonal"
"D: Nice holiday beer from BOMC -- something I wouldn't want to drink a lot of, but definitely worth a buy next holiday season."
"Overall this is a pretty good beer that has a nice gingerbread quality to it but also has a nice balance. This was far better then I thought it was going to be."
"poured a dark brown in color with brown highlights that had a thin head and left a little lacing sticking to the glass. I definitely was able to detect some pumpkin cinnamon and allspice on the first whiff with bready ginger notes that really make seem like a gingerbread cookie but in liquid form. The taste was a little light on the pumkin spices and cinnamon but had gingerbread man cookie notes and brown sugar accents; really intresting. The brew was medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a sweet, bready, slight spice, and mild toasty finish. It drank decent but it definitely a novelty beer that was quite intresting. I would one day try to pair it alongside some gingerbread cookies."
"all in all, this is an interesting one... I've had several bottles before reviewing it, just to be sure I'm giving it a fair shot. I was really hoping for some super-gingerbready brew... kind of the ST Creme Brulee of the gingerbread flavors. But it just kinda fell flat, to an average brown ale with some interesting flavors."
"Bison Brewing Company--Gingerbread Ale--Beer Brewed With Ginger, Nutmeg And Cinnamon--USDA Organic Since 1989--2010 12 oz. Bottle. 6.00% ABV. 20 IBU's. (3.25 / 5.0) Porter--Spiced. Light tan dense lacy lasting head. Dark ruby edged ruby black color. Roasted ginger cinnamon mild hop front. Crusty sweet earthy roasted dark malt ginger nutmeg spicy mild fruit Porter body. Dry mild hop unbalanced harsh Gingerbread spice crisp clean end. Sampled 12/13/2010. Malt of the Earth Beer of the Month Club Selection received 11/29/2010."
"The only thing positive about my disappointing drinking experience was that this beer is actually VERY GOOD...once I got past the frustration of it not tasting anything like the way the label said it would! It's a smooth, somewhat robust, stout and it's very drinkable and enjoyable. But it is NOT gingerbread ale. Don't let them fool you. Buy their ""Chocolate Stout"" instead. Don't waste your time on this."
"D - This is quite a treat. It really delivers on the promised flavors. It's truly a complimentary blend between the porter and ginger. This is definitely a dessert beer though, enjoy it after meal."
"This is a decent holiday beer. Smells malty with gingerbread, molasses, and chocolate notes. Pours a deep amber with a moderate tan head. Spicy with a mild hop presence. Finishes with gingerbread (not as strong throughout as I would have liked). Not overly sweet and pretty easy to drink. Definitely fun for the holidays but I have had better seasonal brews."
"A very appropriate for the holidays brew that arrived via BOTMC, let's give it a whirl. Popping the top I get a nice waft of sugar and spice and everything nice. Pours to a deep brown with a two-finger tan medium size bubble head. On the taste it starts off with some metallic hops, followed quickly by a sweet malt then the spices kick in big-time. Lot's of ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg flavors, bold but not overbearing. Finishes relatively clean with a bit of lingering tangy bite. AC of 6.8% not detectable in the least. Mouthfeel is average not overly carbonated nor thin but nothing you could stand a spoon in. A good holiday brew, good for the cooler days. Gets you in the holiday spirit."
"Good, not exceptional."
"Verdict: Very good and well-priced make it worth tracking down."
"Overall: The body of the beer is medium and the is medium full. I really did not get any traditional ginger bread flavors. I was hoping for a cardamom note. The beer is descent and fairly easy to finish off."
"The flavor has a bit more depth with a bit of roasted malt, some light cinnamon and ginger, and a very mild chocolate character. The feel is a tad bit light with low carbonation. It drinks easy enough, though it's not terribly tasty and is a bit bland."
"I believe this is a seasonal beer, so I probably won't be purchasing this again, at least until next year. My girlfriend is a vegan, so she really likes the fact that Buffalo Bills has a good amount of organic beers. She could drink this beer ""all year long"" as she stated."
"Drinkability - Yeah, even one of these is a chore honestly. It is a good novelty beer to be honest, and actually does it well, however, it is a bit much. To be truthful, I am glad I picked this up and am saving one for when my parents visit and will have them try it with me to see their reactions. Not horrible at all."
"Upon first sip I was greeted with an overwhelming sense of molasses. My cheeks puckered a little bit to the taste and thought that it was probably a good representation of a gingerbread beer. I think I was probably hoping for more of a pumpkin spice beer, but after two bottles think that those who like molasses would enjoy this beer. Probably won't buy anymore."
"Drinks pretty easy for the ABV, not a bad offering, but more maltyness is required"
"D: I would never drink this again nor would I recommend this to a friend. I feel like it was an amateur beer experiment gone very very wrong."
"This bottle has been around a while, on sale in Pacific Beach for $3.99/four. Surprisingly pleasant stuff. Let it warm up from fridge temp just a little, and it is actually a decent beer. Better than some of the recent Anchor Christmas ales in a similar style."
"Drinkability: A bit reminiscent of Anchor's OSA, though somewhat tamer. Just as their Chocolate Stout gets the job done being a chocolaty stout, so too does the Gingerbread Ale at being a spicy porter."
"I try to go organic for a lot of things I eat and drink, but this is probably the first organic beer I've tried. I really enjoyed it. Not too hoppy, not bitter, it was a good flavor. But speaking of flavor, where was the gingerbread? It seemed more like a light oatmeal stout. I love gingerbread, but I did not taste it in this. I will try something else from Bison next time, my girlfriend likes the chocolate stout by them."
"This porter is easily drinkable and a nice variation on the style, keeping up a nice balancing act while managing to become a perfect beer for the holiday season."
"It's possible the ice cream pairing enhanced my experience with Bison's Gingerbread Ale. I wasn't sure how this would pan out, but it has turned out for the better. This is a Bison product I would surely do again."
"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. Clear dark brown with a nice tan head. Overspiced aroma with, in order of intensity, nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon. There's also this slight off-note that I can't really put my finger on. Rotten pumpkin? Melting plastic? It's very minor but it's there. Flavor is watery porter with the expected gingerbread character dominating. Doesn't taste artificial but it's just too much for me. It's like on Christmas if someone makes gingerbread cookies and you eat like 12 of them and then you never want to taste gingerbread again. That's how I feel three quarters of the way through this beer. Mouthfeel is dry and bitter with roastiness but there's a significant astringency also. Cloyingness detracts from drinkability."
"This beer pours a black body with brown hues around the rim of the glass. A rather soft pour produces a thin off white head that sticks around for a bit. The aroma is roasted barley bread along with ginger and some cinnamon. The first sip imparts a roasted coffee like bitterness from the malt bill along with plenty of ginger spice. The experience is almost like taking a bit of a gingerbread cookie then having a sip of a cold dark coffee. The carbonation is ample and the mouthfeel is quite full bodied. I would not want to have too many of these, but it is a nice little nod to gingerbread. Of all the ""Christmas/Holiday/Winter"" spiced beers, this one probably accomplishes what it sets out to do much better than most."
"Drinkability: I liked it, but I don't know how much of the cinnamon/nutmeg taste I could stand. It is quite delicious though for 1 or 2."
"D: A drinkable beer, but not something I'd readily drink again."
"Poured a thick black hue with good head on top of a sharp ginger smell with hints of cinnamon, caramel and bready sweet malts with no real hop presence. The body is medium-to-full and a little sticky but maintain a bready, ginger spice feel although isn't completely natural and not as smooth as I would've hoped. Not as chewey as slushy and finishes with a dry backbite that reminded me of faint bitter chocolate or toffee. A good beer but just seemed like it could've been better."
"12oz bottle poured into a DFH Signature glass a dark brown with ruby highlights and a decent khaki head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is ginger and sweet caramel malts with slight cinnamon and brown sugar. The taste is a nice blend of sweet malts, ginger, cinnamon and brown sugar with a nice sweet finish, very reminiscent of a gingerbread cookie. The beer is on the light side of medium with well hidden alcohol. This one was very enjoyable, one of the best beers from Bison I've had yet."
"I love gingerbread. Love it. Like cherries, I can have it in almost any form. Bread. Cookie. Candy. Ice cream. Pretzel. The list goes on. So when I saw the beer I was like, ""Yeah, I'm gonna drink that. Awesome."" We poured it cold and as it warmed up the gingerbread aroma started to come out. And it had this great, deep, red color. Very vibrant, actually. Thin head, but ehn, whatev-s. But I ended up being disappointed. The aroma was, say, from 1 to 10, a 1 when we opened the bottle because it was cold. And then it warmed up to about a 3, maybe a 4, but then it just stopped. Bitch is near room temperature and you have to swirl her and put half your face in the glass to get the scent. Boo. More hop than gingerbread, basically. If you like IPAs and gingerbread, but like IPA more by several degrees, then it's for you. If you think it's going to be like gingerbread in the form of beer. No. No. You are wrong."
"D: tasty flavor experience and a nice compliment for the season. I give props to Bison for the adventurous style of melding gingerbread and beer together. I think it works!"
"Drinkablity is so so at best. In my opinion this one is a miss, just doesn't hit the dark, ginger, and sweet flavors I was expecting. Not a bad beer, but not a real good one either. Pass..."
"A much darker appearance than I had anticipated. A very slight amount of ginger in the nose, but not much at all. More malt than ginger in the nose. Taste is malty and spicy, with very subtle ginger. The carbonation really promotes a very complex mouthfeel which is particularly tasty. Overall, a very impressive and unique seasonal!"
"Drinkability: Perfect accompaniment to any winter, Christmastime activity. Unique as it really does taste like gingerbread...even after the ""novelty"" factor wears off, it still comes through as a very solid beer. Try if you get the chance...plus it's organic! If that means anything to you in the slightest :)"
"Notes from 12/16/07"
"Lovelly looking dark brown ale with a very handsome beige head, thick and creamy. Nice aromas, of ginger cake, spices,coffee,chocolate and sherry .Like it. Taste ginger snaps,esspresso,faint rum cake,chocolaty, slightly toasted malts. No hops. Ok on the palate maybe a bit on the thin side to carry so much different flavours. Overall..I kinda enjoyed this one, unusual and good, though not an everyday drinker..even in the Festive Season."
"Surprisingly dark pour with a solid tan head. Gingerbread aroma with some malt. Taste was unexpectedly good, given Bison's track record. The porter quality really comes out; malty, roasty, and chocolatey. Nice hop bitterness works really well with the gingerbread in the end."
"This beer is truley a winter warmer,why I bought it in hot June is beyond me but its pretty darn good.Poured into a standard pint glass a deep mahogany brown with a tight fluffy beige head that kept form well for quite some time.Ginger is the main element in the nose wich is expected along with some earth and brown sugar,a little thin and sharp in the mouth but it mellows after a bit.A good mix of spice and earth on the palate,the ginger doesnt overpower but is the main attraction,ther is a solid dry earthiness in the finish.Bison makes some decent organic beers and this is no different."
"But this is a very good beer, wiith the spices done at just the right level. Worth seeking out, and enough to show me that ""organic"" doesn't always mean ""subpar""."
"D: First I have had from Bison, and would recommend it. Similar to anchor xmas style but not as crisp as theirs. Still worth a try."
"Drinkability is fair, this is a unique winter beer with great spice profile, there is a bit of a disconnect between the aroma and taste (gingerbread lower than expected, chocolate higher than expected), the alcohol is well-masked but the spices make it hard to finish even the whole 22oz bottle, good recommendation from the guys on Craft Beer Radio podcast but I doubt I'll be craving this any time soon"
"D: An interesting beer, one of the more heavily spiced Winter beers out there on the market, would go great with pumpkin pie or a holiday meal, a tasty beer from Bison."
"Drinkability: 2005 bottling; has held up reasonably well despite the oxidation; with a bigger malt profile, this could be really interesting"
"This brew seems to have some root beer nestled down deep. Nice."
"Thanks to cmaruschak for sharing. Pours reddish-brown with a medium thin off-white head with good retention. Thin patches of lacing throughout. The aroma is spiced gingerbread and earthy malt. Medium-bodied with a spicy character. Gingerbread flavor is not too strong, and there are some hops and caramel flavors as well. The finish is short and spicy with vanilla and malt aftertaste. Slightly above average overall."
"Pours an espresso brown with a perfect lattesque head. Nose is completely gingerbread with a cup of Joe on the side. Flavor is really nice. I am not a porter person but this was real nice. Continued gingerbread notes with light coffee and maybe a sprinkling of some dark cocoa powder. Added sweetness reduces almost all of the bitterness and makes for an incredibly smooth experience. Recommended. Thanks to nathan15 for the bottle."
"D - It's a fairly drinkable beer, but certainly not something to sit around and drink all night. I would much rather have a balanced traditional porter, or an anchor christmas ale if this is the style i want to taste."
"Very interesting spiced holiday brew, to be sure."
"And an edit: Does Coca Cola use ginger in their soda? This beer just keeps on reminding me of that flavor profile."
"Now I'll have to try Bison's Chocolate Stout, which I've purposely been avoiding for some time."
"This poured a shiny, dark, dark brown with an offwhite head and good lacing. Very cool effervescent bubbles make their way to the top before dissipating. The smell is er, gingerbread with cinnamony spices and a malty character. Very nice crisp taste with a nice bitter finish that I enjoyed. This seems more like a dark lager than an ale, but a very good one at that. Makes an excellent change-of-pace if you want to sample something new."
"This is a mohagany-colored beer with a huge chocolate-colored head maintained by vigorous carbonation. Smells are very light and prettymuch smells like a molasses cookie with a wisp of English hop in the background. Ginger taste takes the forefront, backed by cidery tastes of light molasses and brown sugar, along with a light roasted character. Not a bad beer, but lacks robustness. Mouthfeel is light and thin. I have no specific complaints, but didn't find this beer that drinkable. I think as much as I like it other places, ginger is a little off-putting to me as a beer ingredient."
"This is a decent holiday brew. I do enjoy the gingerbread flavors. I haven't had too many gingerbread beers, but overall this beer can definitely hold its own. It's a fun and festive beer that tastes good too! Recommended."
"This beer grew on me as it warmed up. At first I was mildly repulsed but the acidity decreased and more the nutmeg came out as it warmed. Poured a dark brown (almost black) in color. Incredibly thick, foamy head. Quite resilient too. Nose is the best part for me--full of ginger. Flavor is like ginger bread. At first it was stale cookies but as it got closer to room temperature more of bread-like flavor came out. Just a tad acidic. Medium mouthfeel and just a tad sticky. Alright, after it warmed."
"After having a few standard Bison brews, I didn't hold out much hope for this brew. Glad I made the purchase. It's good beer. Begins with a maltiness that I'd expect from sweeter English and Scottish ales, but with a serious ginger addition. Doesn't really come across a gingerbread, but with a fresh ginger addition. The malts pick up on a doughy, yeasty flare, but not rounded with the nutmeg, cinnemon, or allspice. Doesn't have to; the beer is well bodied, sweet, characterful, and balanced well with English hops. Lingers a bit too long with the sweetness and a hint of graininess late. One of my favorite winter warmers of this season."
"The smell is unique and appealing, with plenty of gingerbread flavor. Vanilla comes through too. The taste also has a lot of gingerbread, but it doesn't come out as well. Malt content seems minimal. It is pretty light in the mouth."
"Last swigs: This seemed like agood beer right in the heart of Christmas season. Intersting beer to say the least. A well done novelty that is worth trying."
"Basically a gingerbread porter. Great head with strong retention atop a smokey, thick brown. Great smokey malts mixed with a much more authentic gingerbread aroma than expected. I was afraid it would be overpowering. The taste reflects the great balance of a good porter and the gingerbread. The roasty and smokey blend very well Would have gotten a five in that department except for the fact that it lost some of its balabce as it warmed up. As it warmed, it lost a little of its pleasant gingerbread quality. Smooth palate with a great linger that leaves a smaller and smaller impression of the beginning flavors."
"Bison Organic Gingerbread Ale pours a very dark brown with a thick tan head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is definitely spice, cinnamon stands out. I quite like the taste, it's basically a brown ale with some chocolate and coffee notes and gingerbread spicing. A nice beer for the holidays, it makes me want to get a slice of pumpkin pie to go with it."
"Overall this beer wanst bad but it certainly was not what I expected out of a ginger beer."
"Overall it is a decent spiced beer. Needs something more though to tie everything together. Reminds me too much of ginger ale at times rather then the guy who ran around trying not to be eaten. Maybe I'll give it another try around Christmas when it's colder and the spirit is gingerier."
"Being the season for the winter beers I like to try em all, and when this one caught my eye I had to grab it. Pour was a bit shocking, I guess I was expecting a lighter beer originally, but this poured a dark brown with a nice half inch head that slowly receded to lacing. Smell was a nice balance of gingerbread and chocolate. Taste caught me offguard, again I was kinda expecting this to be lighter, but was rather delighted by the taste, which was basically like a gingerbread porter. Really unique compared to anything i've had. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but not too bad, quite enjoyable. Drinkability was pretty good for me, this is a nice beer to have with a dessert or just to sip for a festive occasion. A pretty tasty offering from Bison."
"A nice spicey indulgence that was not a pain to drink, but it lacks the complexity it needs to be a super-recommendable beer. An enjoyable beer with a bit of a difference, just nothing outrageously good."
"Overall impression: An interesting enoug beer, but I certainly won't be seeking out more."
"Drinkability: I can see myself really enjoying this on a cold winter's eve. I'd like to try another batch, because this one is just too weird."
"First beer rating after receiving my Initiate mug. Woo Hoo!!!"
"Drinkability: A decent porter that I wouldn't mind having again, but nothing spectacular. It's missing some texture on the palate and even a bit of flavor. Besides the sweetness and roastiness there isn't the chewy malt that is claimed on the bottle."
"While perusing the beer section at my local grocery I came across this interesting sounding beer. ""Gingerbread ale", the text described it as a porter but after pouring this into my glass i realized it really isn't a porter at all, far too light. A pretty brew nonetheless, dark brown and only slightly translucent, the head was small and faded quickly with no lacing. Smell was very interesting with clear ginger scents at the nose. Unfortunately this scent doesn't transfer to the taste as well as I hoped with the ginger being noticeable but very faint. Tastes like a flat brown ale, or a very light porter without much in the way of roasted flavors. Mouthfeel was extremely light considering the dark hue of this beer, very confusing. After all this beer is interesting and worth trying, its just that nothing jumps out to make me want to try it again."
"I guess I got a better bottle than the average of the reviewers, but I really liked this one. I actually had this one a long time ago, but luckily I found the review I wrote down. I also will never forget the taste of the beer. The taste and the smell of the beer were very similar. They both had a strong taste of ginger and spices, very much like gingerbread. It was so much like gingerbread, it was uncanny. It also had a bit of a hop bite in the end, so it wasn't all malty. I would suggest this brew to most anyone, especially ones you want to show what craft brews are like."
"Body is a hair above light, with a soft undercarbonated flat mouthfeel. Glad this was just a small sample."
"Very interesting ginger flavoured beer. I was never a big fan of ginger, so obviously this won't be one of my favourites, but I'll try to be objective. Pours a light clear brown body, thin white lace. A subtle gingerbread aroma, reminiscent of gingerbread cookies. Sweet, sharp and slightly fruity. Medium bodied, easy drinking and refreshing."
"The beer pours a translucent brown color with a thick frothy tan head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is great. It has a smooth caramel scent that boasts of pale, crystal, and roasted malts. It also has an awesome gingerbread aroma that is very enticing. The taste is good. It has a roasted toffee flavor that is sweet and smooth on the finish. It also has a mild, not over the top, gingerbread taste that is very enjoyable. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a good seasonal brew. It's smooth and full of flavor; a good drinker."
"22 ounce bottle. Purchased in GA."
"This beer pours a brownish red color. It has a light brown head that fades quickly, leaving very few laces. The aroma is a little hard to describe. It smells like a gingerbread man. It has a spicy aroma also, but mostly, just gingerbread. It also tasted like a gingerbread man. A liquid alcoholic gingerbread man. It is better than I expected. It is quite good. It has a spicy taste also. Ginger, nutmeg, cinnimon. It also tastes a little sweet. I cant really detect any hops over the spicy flavors. This beer is mild, and refreshing. It leaves a spicy ginger aftertaste. It might be a little overcarbonated, but not so overcarbonated that it detracts from the beer. I think this beer would make a great session beer. The flavor is quite appealing, and I dont think it would get old. Also, the alcohol content, while not stated, is rather low, I think, and that means you could drink a few of them. If you see this one, buy it. Try it. You might like it."
"Surprisingly, the taste of gingerbread isn't quite so obvious. It is there, but you get some sweet and hoppiness, too. However, with the smell of the gingerbread enhancing the flavor, it makes it stronger and you either have to keep from breathing while sipping or put up with it. It gets old fast, though, and I hard a hard time finishing one."
"Overall, I drank this beer, and was glad for the opportunity to do so, but I was not excited by it."
"This beer is an utter failure. A drainpour if I ever saw one. The core of the beer's problems may be in the low quality of organic malt available - I've noticed similar failings in other organic beers I've tried. Whatever the case, this beer is woefully unbalanced, and is screaming for a heavier malt element."
"Drinkability- A definite interesting brew. Not really my favorite taste in a beer, but was a good experience to have. Not bad considering. Took me half the pint to get used to it."
"The beer after its extrication from the 22-ounce brown bottle sets in the glass a slightly beclouded deep mahogany with a modest semi-creamy tan head thats dissipates leaving a thick and sticky sheet of lace to obfuscate the glass. Nose is like sniffing a gingerbread cookie, sweet with hints of vanilla, fresh a quite appetizing; start is sweet with a rich malt profile and the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish is striking in its acidity with the hops purposeful in their spiciness, the ginger noticeable in the devastatingly dry aftertaste, different for sure."
"Herbed/Spiced beers are hard to do well in my experience. Plenty of brewers seem to have trouble getting the flavor profile and the degree of spicing just right. I'm not saying that Gingerbread Ale hits all the right marks, but it is a good version of the style. I'll also give Bison points for originality; a gingerbread porter is a new one on me."
"Overall: I happen to like the traditional Ginger Beers, so a GingerBread Ale or Porter to be more specific was intriguing. I think Bison pull it off to be honest, but it will always be specialist in its appeal I feel. Unfortunately my fridge has somehow reset itself recently, and I served this one far too cool to start with. Let this offering warm up to get the very best from it for sure. Very enjoyable, and a nice twist on the Porter theme. Worth trying."
"When poured, it showed a dark brown with very little foam and there was some lace. The smell of spices and roasted malts filled the nose with a pleasant aroma. The taste had a spice and roasted malt feel on the palate. Spices like nutmeg, all-spice and cinnamom and a hint of dark bitter chocolate. Nice bitter/sweet finish that was not overpowering!"
"It's extremely deep chestnut body appears black in the glass, but displays brilliant ruby highlights when held to the light; and the creamy, yellowish-tan head maintains a solid 1/4"" cap throughout the glass and leaves some nice lace along the way. Cinnamon is evident in the nose along with some mild, dark fruitiness and a dry, bready maltiness. It's mildly crisp in the mouth to start-off with as its medium body releases its median carbonation; and it warms to become lightly creamy as it crosses the palate. At first its flavor is dominated by a cinnamon spice that seems to dull it's bready, lightly toasty, and even slightly chocolatey malt; and then a ginger note steps forward to totally eclipse whatever maltiness may have been there - and it finishes very dry (but not bitter) with a lingering note of ginger. The spices are there, clearly; just not the sweet malts needed to back them up."
"Yet another weird taste combo that works from Bison. Deep brown color, small head. Very slight Gingerbread flavor to this porter. Malty and spicy, not very hoppy. Nice beer, but the gingerbread flavor was very subdued, I was expecting a little more flavor. But interesting."
