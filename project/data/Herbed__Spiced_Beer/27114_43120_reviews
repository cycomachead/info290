"Pours a murky honey yellow-orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, spice, mint, herb, and pickle juice aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, herb, and pickle juice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of herb bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with odd but interesting mint and pickle juice qualities that I wasn't expecting."

"Bought a bomber from Windham Wine & Spirits in Willimantic, CT. Poured into a pint glass. A bit of bubbly foam and lots of carbonation. A pleasant enough white ale with definite coriander spice in the swallow. That flavor lingers on a bit too much for me, burning my throat after a while. Overall, it is definitely an interesting spiced beer, but I'm not sure I would be jumping at the gun for a try of this again."

"Very heavy gold...lots of carbonation. White head. Coriander and pale malt. Not as fruit forward as expected. Clean and grainy. Grass and yeast. Some really pleasant sourness. Tart and soft. The beer has a moderate bitterness and a lot of spice flavor. Great on a summer day."

"Wow, this brew is almost flawless, there is absolutely nothing negative to say about this beer."

"Clear faded orange glow billowy bright white head that fades quickly. Sweet and exotic spice upfront. Corrinder, Ginger snap on the sides of the tongue. Rich feeling in the mouth but light and fluffy. Sweet pears and apples on the tip of the tongue, tangerines, belgian like spice. Tastes vinous like a chardonnay. Finishes clean with a soft underlying bitterness that mellow the flavors out. Spice and ginger linger. A really unique brew. It really does taste like a belgian blonde was brewed with over the tope spices and lagered. Clean complex fun and delicious. I like it. (it actually smells like a Sauvigion Blanc no lie). Faint peppery finish. Unlike anything i've ever had and super unique."

"Not quite sure what to make of this. Reminds me of a witte but not getting the coriander and citrusy hops. Middle of the road is best I can do on this bottle, might try again to confirm the findings."

"Nice-looking and smooth tasting beer. Not a tremendous amount of depth or complexity. Satisfying but light. Could use some more spiciness for the style. More like a witbier to me. Based on others, this seems to be a pretty decent brewery, albeit not necessarily the absolute elite."
"O: meh, it would be good on a hot day and I like the idea of a spiced lager. still, the flavor profile was so narrow that I cannot get excited about this beer."
"Overall Drinkability: Would be a very, very good beer, if not for the mouthfeel. Reminds me of a Belgian ale or a wit with more coriander."

"This is a real winner here. Cloudy golden liquid with a very big white head and a good slow fade that leaves quite a bit of lace and a thick covering on top. Active carbonation. Smell is full of spices and a great doughy malt. Some zesty orange and light mellon like sweetness along with a ginger and corriander. This is a great tasting beer that combines the crispness of a lager with the broader palate of an ale, Belgian Wit to be specific. It somehow maintains some of the hallmark lager cleanness while delivering a bouquet of citrus and spice along with a dry chalky quinine bitterness. Finish is dry and orangey with spices flavoring a light malt that lingers. Feel is wonderful with a velvety carbonation and light medium weight. Crisp and quenching this beer makes for a perfect beer to slake the spring/summer thirst. It is supremely drinkable and while a bit on the higher side in abv it sessions well. This is one heck of brew that has its feet well planted in two worlds and I'm loving it!"

"Overall an enjoyable brew. I didn't think it was anything special, but I would absolutely give it another try. Highlight for me was the flavor full of spice and citrus. Give it a try"
""
"Albino Python isn’t necessarily the white lager it claims to be, but like with other Shmaltz Brewing products, it really doesn’t matter. The flavor is interesting, the label features some cool artwork, and the taste is one all its own. It is definitely a beer worth trying again and again, just to enjoy the intriguing combinations of spices and malts."

"Overall a pretty damn tasty White Lager that had a nice sweet citrus presence, making it quite refreshing and giving it a great drinkability..."

"Best enjoyed quickly. Don’t sit with the beer in the mouth, trying to pick apart the flavors within, but rather swallow tiny sips quickly, enjoying it as a whole, which is how it works best. A unique, freakish, sexy beer."

"The beer pours a hazy golden-orange color with a white head. The aroma is very heavy on the coriander with some orange and wheat notes thrown in. I also get some mint notes, but I am not sure where they are coming from. The flavor is pretty much what you expect in a Belgian White. I get some coriander and wheat, as well as some very light fruit and floral notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation."
"Smells like an herb garden. Ginger and lemon cut through immediately, but followed by something like cloves or cardamom. Pours a great yellow with very little head and almost no lacing. I don't find it overcarbonated, but rather, really refreshing and crisp. The ginger flavor is welcome, especially when paring this beer with food. Gives some interesting results. After the beer warms a bit i think the flavors are even more pronounced and delicious."

"O- I had this one back before I knew anything about beer and I still like it. There's something to be said for that."
""
""
"All in all, comes across as a bizarre lemon / ginger / Belgian-styled spicing with the heavier body and texture of a German hefeweizen, but is actually a heavily-spiced ""white lager."" I like it, but than again I've always been drawn to unusual beers...YMMV. My nitpicks are that the vegetal element in the finish doesn't really fit in all that well, and the nose led me to believe that I would be receiving something akin to a Berliner Weiss which didn't actually happen."
"A 22 oz bottle from back of the cooler at Boulevard Liquors in San Diego. Crazy stuff."

"Overall: Easy beer to drink for a lager. I like this one. Won't be on my list of beers to buy since I usually search more for IPA's and Stouts but if you like lagers definitely find this one, you will not be disappointing. I was expecting a lot less. Although this isn't an amazing beer it is definitely worth the purchase."

"This poured a hazy golden straw with a nice amount of foam. Some sweet, gently pleasing hop aromas come through. Tastes light and refreshing with a nice spiciness on the finish. The surprise treat is the ginger that comes through as it warms—barely noticeable at first after the better part of an hour it goes from background player to center stage. Delicious!"

"Mild carbonation and the smooth malty flavor make this beer feel creamy and slightly thick. The taste is very fresh and clean making this a vey drinkable beer. Excellent brew, I'm glad to have tried this and would buy it again in a heartbeat!"

"O: Alright, I was excited about this beer, and I feel let down, the smell and flavors are there, but its lacking something."
"O - Can't think of anything constructive to say about this beer. I won't be getting it again."
"Overall-I like the idea, but it just didn’t do it for me, lots of flavor packed in here but maybe they could balance some of this out."
"It didn’t really impress me, but the bottle sure was cool looking."
"Too much ginger!"
"No matter what style you decide to call it, I recommend this beer without any reservations, and as a bonus, the 6% abv is low enough to let you enjoy more than one."
"Hazy pale bright golden blonde colour, one finger of dense white head with some lace. Smell is malty and spicy, orange, coriander, some ginger but bready malt is the most reoccurring scent here. Taste is full of ginger, sharp spicy notes, lots of malts and as it warmed some earthy root like flavours. High active carbonation, medium mouthfeel, solid weight. This was quite unique, similar in a lot of ways to a wit but is missing something (probably because its a spiced lager). That said I like this better than macro witbiers like shock top and rickards white."
"Overall – not a bad brew at all, but not overwhelming either."
"Not terrible but don't think I'll be back for more."
"Overall, tastes like a soapy ginger wit. Interesting but not too appealing to me."
"Overall, I'm not really digging this beer. The ginger is overwhelming, and I want more yeast character. I could see them doing a Wit with the exact same ingredients minus the ginger and it would be a damn good beer."
"Pours a hazy golden hue which leaves a two finger well carbonated head with clingy lacing,the mouthfeel is light bodied and has tastes of spices,lemon peel,citrus,candied wheat and finished with a herbal hoppy dryness and overall an above average white that's easy enough to knock back cheers."
"Overall: A very interesting and tasty beer. Spices really stand out but are well balanced by the lemon and malts."
"This is a nice change of pace. I like how Shmaltz takes traditional ale recipes and brews in a lager style. It's unique and in this case very delicious."
"In the end, the ginger spice is the only thing that lingers, and it does so for a while. I think some more hops, and their bitterness, could have made the beer a little more balanced, but still! There's a still... I recommend this beer. I very much enjoyed it."
"Glad I chose this on tap at Amity Hall in the village in NYC."
"O - Decent herbal brew. Like a mild spiced Belgian white or pale."
"As promised, this beer is weird, but good."
"O: This is a very unique tasting beer. Easy drinking, clean and great for warm weather. It tastes strange at first but the flavors grew on me very quickly. Schmaltz is quickly making me respect lagers a whole lot more with their Coney Island line of beers."
"Overall I liked this beer. It was very interesting to try a spiced lager rather than just a spiced ale. Would like to have this again."
"D-Overall this was a interesting beer. Had interesting flavors and super drinkable. I actually kind of liked it. I would say this is a must try once."
"O: Overall not too impressed with this one, a lack of robust character, even for a light lager."
"O: This is definitely an unusual kind of beer, but is oddly drinkable nonetheless."
"Overall it was interesting and enjoyable, but more of a beer to experiment with and sample than to pound or session with. It’s worth a try for adventurous beer drinkers."
"O: The taste is quite unique and a refreshing change of pace, but this is definitely not a sessionable beer; however it might provide for some interesting pairings with Italian food."
"Overall, I'm pleased with this beer and would have it again. I think it scored a B overall (I try not to look so as to keep independent, but I can't avoid it sometimes), but I think it deserves better (and since my average score is about a C, that's saying something)."
"Thin yellow and mellow in appearance with thin head that lasts only a moment. Small hint of spice at first taste with a lingering sense of fruit but none of the flavors last very long. Refreshing but not memorable. It's light and I get the sense it would be great on a hot day."
"Overall not great, spices are way too overpowering for what it is, no malt or pumpkin or sweetness, or something heavier to balance the heavy spices."
"Pours a clear peach-golden color with a thin white head that recedes quickly and ends with a ringy collar. The nose carries a bit of light wheat and bread, and also a bit of odd spice that doesn't really fit. Seems like white pepper. The flavor carries some more of this character. White pepper and some other spice. Very strange. Bread and a bit of caramel in the background. The body is medium with light carbonation. Very strange beer, not a big fan."
"Appearance is a light golden yellow with thin dissapating head. Smell of a light clean lager with spice and lemon. Taste of ginger is dominant with a little lemon thrown in, but light and subtle enough to make for a refreshing lager. Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation. Not bad, a little rough around the edges in the end with little hop lingering, but still enjoyable."
"Taste like bud light lime on steroids. If you like the taste of lime in your beer, you should definelty try this, otherwise I would stay away. It had a lighter flavor, and would have a very drinkable quality if not for the lime and I actually think it could have been a decent tasting beer if they could dial back the lime-like flavor quite a bit."
"O: I didn't know what to expect when I read ""white lager brewed with spices."" I wouldn't say this is a bad beer, but I wouldn't consider it to be a good one either. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a lower ABV bomber and is will to try a really different light beer."
"O: The ginger twist is a lovely addition and really makes this stand out."
"D: With a host of surprisingly intense flavors, this beer comes across as interesting, if a little amateurish in the way it is put together. Still, it is a fairly unique creation that does not lend itself to easy comparison."
"Poured from a 22 oz bomber. Hazy golden color with thin white head that has descent rentention and leaves creamy rings of lace. Strong aroma of clove and spice with orange and coriander, hints of lemon. The taste is of spice, cloves, orange peel, lemon, lemon grass, and mineral water. Hints of lavender and lime. A tart aftertaste. Well balanced, medium bodied, grainy and smooth. Refreshing and easy to drink."
"All in all, pretty drinkable and different...and interesting inclusion in a style that's much maligned."
"A decent drink, but not something I'd go to for a session beer."
"Certainly better crafted than say Moosehead. The slightly soapy taste would keep me from having another. Worth trying though."
"Thanks to woodychandler for the trade.Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a small head. Smell is of spices and citrus. Taste is good, malts, ginger, coriander, some lemon and a touch of hops. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall a very good brew."
"A very cloudy yellowish tan color with a fair white head and decent lacing. The aroma has gingerbread and almond spice. Very nice. The flavor offers ginger and allspice with lemony highlights. It's well carbonated, very fine tingly stuff, medium-light bodied, crisp feeling and plenty drinkable. It sort of reminds me of some holiday spice brews. Enjoyable."
"Head of thick white foam of two fingers, but didn't last long, nice thick clinging lace. Color is a cloudy 7 on the SRM chart. Aromas of pepper, ginger, lemon, mustard, and lilac. Flavors of ginger, lemon, black pepper, oats and licorice. Lots of body in my mouth, nice finish of pepper. I really like the flavor of ginger and pepper, and will have to have more in the future."
"Drinkability was good. Subtle flavors, no abv signs. Flavors were weird though."
"D: Drainpour."
"D - Not a fan of the taste; I think the brewers could have done a better job balancing the hops and herbal taste; I would pass on having another one"
"Smells like an herb garden. Ginger and lemon cut through immediately, but followed by something like cloves or cardamom. Pours a great yellow with very little head and almost no lacing. I don't find it overcarbonated, but rather, really refreshing and crisp. The ginger flavor is welcome, especially when paring this beer with food. Gives some interesting results. After the beer warms a bit i think the flavors are even more pronounced and delicious."
"It was quite drinkable and well worth it after having given a pint of blood a few hours earlier."
"I have to admit that I had trepidations in trying this beer because...well, the brewery is called Schmaltz and they're labels are gimmicky. I try not to judge a book by its cover, but in this case it would have worked to my favor. Luckily I didn't pay for this one."
"Not a huge fan of this one. I was expecting something different and I sure got it. They advertized it as a white lager brewed with spices and I think they got a little carried away with the spice aspect. When I drink it, I have to remind myself I'm drinking a beer because the flavors make me forget. Not recommended."
"Unlike Saison du Buff, which somehow manages to make an herb-forward beer that pleases, the spices here (and perhaps that's the key) foil this beer."
"D - this one is an easy drinker and very well-suited for hot weather consumption"
"Fizzy quickly fleeing carbonation white thin head with a murky golden orange carob of color. No lacing whatsoever, head was barely even there. Aroma sharp pine/herb/spice driven nose with a hint of citrus peel. A spicy barrage of flavors, fennel celery like flavor with citrus peel and rose water this is a complex wit lager. It actually reminds me of Philly Brewing Fleur de Leigh. A dry bitterness reigns in the fnish leaving spice on the palate, mouthfeel is coated with spice lighter bodied with a restrained carbonation. Drinkability is decent I didn't know what to think of this hybrid wit/lager, but those freaks in Coney Island sure are creative."
"It has a very light and sweet smell with some fruity hop esters. Its appearance is a light gold body with a thick soapy and rocky head. The body has a lot of carbonation. The flavor is full of spice and citrus. I love the spiciness but think it maybe a little overdone on the citrus for my tastes but not by much. It has a great light body that is easy to drink with just the right amount of carbonation."
"Drinkability - It's different that's for sure. There were aspects I really enjoyed (flavor and aroma), but the feel itself didn't sit right. I think if this was readily available, I'd have it again, but not one I'd go out of my way for. 3.0/5.0"
"D - a strange animal with elements of a belgian, weisse, lager, and ginger beer, very interesting and somewhat refreshing, but just a little too heavy on the ginger for my taste"
"This beer is a clown, a goon, a freak in a fucking sideshow! (We were listening to SlapShot's Old Tyme Hardcore while drinking this.) We dig it! And skip the OJ in the AM, there's no reason why the world shouldn't be drinking this for breakfast alongside your eggs, bacon, beans and toast."
"Pretty good beer. Very drinkable and original taste, typical for Shmaltz specialty brews."
"Overall this was a fine beer. Not overwhelmingly good, but a refreshing beer to have on a hot summer day."
"Price = $9.00"
"This one surprised me at how much I enjoyed it. When I saw it at my local liquor store, it seemed a bit gimmicky to me--a ""white lager"" called the Albino Python? And yet I'm glad my curiosity convinced me to pick it up! Not particularly bizarre or exotic actually, and in fact it tasted much as you would expect a witbier lager hybrid if that makes sense. Cloudy wheat appearance with almost no head. Definitely enjoyed the spices that dominate this brew, consumed by the typical orange/coriander witbier ingredients, but also by the ginger that is added to this unique beer. If you enjoy spiced beer, I see no reason why not to love this one. The 6% is slightly above your average witbier, and yet not particularly noticeable. I also found that the spices become even richer as the beer warms a little bit. I enjoyed all 22 oz of this, and I'll probably come back to it now and then if it continues to be available. Props to Shmaltz who always seem to be cooking up adventurous brews that usually seem to work pretty well--I quite liked this ""white lager""!"
"Overall this beer was better than I was expecting but the flavors weren't smooth enough to make it above average. Worth a shot to see for yourself, especially in the warmer months."
"Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Drinkability is high - smooth and well balanced. An interesting take on the style"
"Poured a hazy golden straw yellow with orange highlights that had a half finger of head and left very little lacing sticky to the glass. Right away I did get wheat bready malt aromas with spices that consisted of coriander, slight cinnamon, and faint citrus notes. Upfront on the taste the spices were a little bolder which were coriander, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It also had some nice citrus accents that had a nice wheat malt balance. The brew was light to medium body with plenty of carbonation that had a spicey slight citric and malty finish. Overall was a decent beer which drank pretty good and was not overwhelming on the spice."
"Tastes ginger, odd wheat, lemony, soapy, and herbal (thyme and marjoram), licorice, and mildly of oranges. Ah, there is a flavor I find in pepperoni...not the meat or salt, but an herbal character. The herb components of this beer totally dominate a sort of heaviness over the malt and what should be refreshing coriander and orange. There is a peppery zip that tries to show, but loses to the earthiness. The finish is rather dry and the orange shows pretty strong here. Light body and strong fine carbonation. As much as I'd like to say I hate it, it is very complex in an odd and slightly intriguing way. I can't imagine buying this beer in the future, but am glad I had the chance to try it."
"Picked up at Wilbur's in Fort Collins, as part of a mixed six pack. Pours a dark urine color, that is seriously carbonnated, with bubbles dancing throughout, although it quickly settles into an almost flat beer. Not much nose, just a little subtle spice. Heavy ginger/cardamom/coriander flavors on the palate, lead to a lingering bitter finish. Not that good."
"D - Overall this was a pretty tasty drink. I couldn't toss back 6 of them, but they're quite tasty and would be nice complement to any beer tasting evening. The spices are noticeable, but not overpowering, making for a delicious balanced beverage."
"Drinkability is good, this is a unique white ale, that is pretty refreshing. I kind of like the ginger note, pretty good stuff."
"D: Quite drinkable, I'd definitely have another one after this."
"maybe a bit simple but very refreshing."
"A white lager.. interesting? Pours a cloudy orange/yellow color, no head to this one. Taste is medium bodied, highly carbonated. Lemon/citrus sort of taste to it. Finishes smooth with a bit of a funky citrusy sort of after taste. I would have rather had this just be a white ale instead of this new hybrid. Drinkable, but seems like an odd concoction, and certainly tastes like one. I'll pass."
"Got this from my BOTM shipment. Golden in color. It has a hazy or cloudy look to it. The bubbly white head shows up but fizzes away quickly. Strong citrus notes; I'm mostly picking up lemon. Kind of grassy notes as well. An acidy bite to it at first. Definitely citrus as the main attraction. I get the feeling of spices but am not advanced enough to pick any out specifically. A very fizzy mouthfeel upfront. But it seemed to lose some carbonation as I got further along and seemed borderline flat at the end. Like I feel about a lot of beers, I think this beer could hit the spot at the right moment such as after a hot day on the golf course where something thirst quenching would fit the bill. Probably won't pick this one out again but will try some others from Shmaltz for sure."
"D - Easy to drink, I'd have one every once and a while but probably not more"
"Part of a recent arrival from BOTMC. Never been to Coney Island, but hey, I've had a Coney dog! Let's give the brew a whirl. Popping the menacing top yields a smell of orange and allspice with more citrus. Pours into a stemless red wine glass with a nice cloudy yelow orange with a very thin head. Taste is almost like a Belgian wit beer with a serious carbonation bite. Evident in the taste is the spicing, some good dry bitterness that has a bite but not a chomp, and a slight citrus fruitiness throughout. Great thirst quenching brew. Nice bitterness. Very light and refreshing with no sacrifice to flavor. I like it."
"I liked this beer for its mild flavor and easy drinkability. Not as complex as some of the fancy whites, but a nice drinkable beer with citrus flavor dominating, but not overpowering."
"Not bad overall, some surprises, some good, some not-so-great. Made for an interesting brew, with some stuff I'd only rarely tasted before. I'd have it again, but there's no rush right away."
"D - Very refreshing, could enjoy this at a hot outside BBQ or after yard work. Think this beer is just out of style, but it does not hurt the drinkability."
"I got this as part of a BOTMC. I poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a hef glass. It pours a hazy gold with a moderate white head. IMO the smell was weak and tepid. There is just the faintest hint of spice. The flavor is off, slightly spicey up front and it finishes spicey. It does have a lemon like sweetness to it. The brew is light in body and highly carbonated. This one did not work for me. IMO it tasted very little like a wit and it really didn't tast like a lager. They kinda missed on all counts."
"Notes: This beer just has an interesting flavor to me and good balance. I think this would be a nice beer to par with lamb or pasta with Italian sausage in the sauce."
"an interesting beer worth trying without doubt. I'm curious to what they used making it"
"an overall solid beer that i enjoyed every sip of. for 6 bucks and an ABV of 6% it's more than a good buy. i cant wait to check out the rest of what Shmaltz has to offer with their coney island lagers."
"Not really to style at all, but that's not Shmaltz's fault. A stand-up fruity, spicy lager, and one that doesn't do you in after a couple glasses."
"D: It was a good beer. Did something a little different to get some more flavor into it. Not something I would seek out but would be nice on a hot summer day."
"22 oz. bottle with no freshness date. Brewed with pale, acidulated and carapils malt, torrified wheat and flaked oats, hopped with warrior, Saaz and summit, and spiced with ginger, fennel and sweet orange zest. The beer is a hazy, pale orangey white, with moderate carbonation, a few floaties and no real lacing. It has a unique and spicy aroma that is dominated by orange, but ginger and a bit of hops show up as well. A clean yeast lets all of the flavors come through, starting with orange, but moving to the ginger and fennel, wheat, a definite sour note, and lightly bitter citrusy hops on top of a light, tingly, almost creamy body that has a very dry finish. Quite the interesting brew - well-worth a try on its own, but this would go much better with food."
"This is the second beer I've had brewed with ginger - my first was the Hitachino Nest long before I started reviewing, which I found unpalatably sour. Remembering that past experience with ginger beer, I was a little hesitant coming into this one. I was really surprised though - this one won me over."
"Overall: I'm disappointed. I do not mind aggressive spice, however, it is not blended well. The spice mess with the fruity taste that could shine and the finish is not pleasant."
"Not sure what to make of this beer. Thought from the name it may be a witbier, it labels itself as a Spice/herb beer, but I just tasted what seemed to resemble an offshoot from a BMC....a lot of grain, little aroma or taste, and a short, non-memorable finish. Cute label though"
"D- It's not for me, definitely the worst offering I've had from shmaltz. This was part of my beer of the month, I've got 2 more of them. Sigh..."
"It's interesting and refreshing, and easily drinkable. Medium-light bodied, gently crisp, and zesty with spice. It's unique, and probably the best balanced beer from Shmaltz. Worth trying!"
"Not pretty to look at but it works, a tasty flavoured lager that delivers and offers something different, I'd go back for more."
"Good drinkability, tasty, but backed by unusual spices that might take some time getting used to."
"Out of a 22 ounce bomber bottle and into my shaker glass. Appears a hazed golden straw yellow color with a good two inches of bubbly bone white head. Nose and flavor consist of citrus such as lemon, ginger, toasted biscuits, sweet caramel malt, somewhat spicy. Medium in body, no noticeable alcohol burn and amply carbonated."
"Drinkability: A really interesting experiment, but I cannot say that I was seduced by this serpent"
"Pours a clear, golden/copper color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. Decent retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, hint of pale malt, hops, slight sour, hint of wheat, hint of coriander, and a hint of all spice. Fits the style of an Herbed / Spiced Beer. Mouth feel is smooth and clean, with s low carbonation level. Tastes of sweet malt, wheat, hint of pale malt, slight all spice, slight coriander, hint of grass, and a hint of hop. Overall, weak appearance, decent aroma, but good blend and body."
"D: I wouldn't drink another one of these if you paid me."
"Just some quick notes: I enjoyed the ginger flavor and addition of crushed fennel in this beer. I noticed some other BAs had some problems with this beer being flat...perhaps they are over-compensating now because my bottle was almost over-carbed. The flavor of ginger and fennel in beer is certainly not for everyone, but again, I thought it be a unique flavor that works in a light, blond and nearly effervescent beer. One more point: even though this is a lager it shouldn't be served to cold as the doing so muted the fruitier flavor of the ginger and sweet orange peel."
"Pours slightly hazy pale golden color with thick, white head with a few dollops here and there. Nose is light and with the coriander it suggest something more familiar such as a Belgian wheat. On the palate the impressions of an ale rather than a lager are seen, perhaps it's just the association with these spices to another style, but it is rather soft with some gentle fruit in there... again, an ale."
"On tap at a local beer festival. White/yellow color and a thin, white head. Smell was alluring, spicy, and citrusy. Fruit and ginger flooded the mouth, with an onslaught of coriander and sharp, tangy, citrusy flavors that were just not meant to go together, let alone go together in beer. Hops flooded in, too, and far too sharp and subtle to flush out the poor taste. Watery in the mouth and dry and awful on the back end. It was at best a really badly-concocted spice beer with a witbier-wannabe body and without the smoothness or any taste."
"Not sure exactly what to think about this one. It smelled nice as it came out of the bottle but smelled a little stale when.you smelled it out of the glass. It pours a cloudy pale brown, by far the best quality of the beer. It tasted wheaty, slightly spiced and flat. It leaves a flat taste in the mouth as the taste sticks in the mouth. Aftertaste doesn't stick around that long and the beer goes down fairly easily. This might fit some peoples taste but i didnt enkoy it."
"M/D - The extreme spiciness makes this hard to drink. the mouthfeel is thin and watery."
"Pours a cloudy yellow color, nice carbonation, nice little fizzy white head, with some sticky lacing to follow. The nose is malty, very slight hop note, some spices. The taste is malty, with a slight hop note, spicey, with some licorice. Medium body. Drinkable, hit's the spot on a hot day."
"D - A very different beer in comparison to my usual, but shockingly it's very drinkable. I'm not saying you could go out and drink a keg of this but it's definitely easy to drink a couple glasses rather quickly."
"Overall, this is certainly something different and I'll give them props for being fairly interesting and different, but I can't see myself revisiting this one."
"This one is definitely heavily spiced, and anyone who cannot handle a beer that falls into that category should stay away. However, I thought the spices worked well together and created a fairly drinkable beer that is definitely interesting."
"The albino-white head held its own before succumbing to the snake wrapped around its throat. The nose was lemony - think lemon chiffon, lemon zest, lemon meringue pie. Mouthfeel was full and bubbly with a LOT of lemon flavor on the tongue. Color was a slightly hazy lemon (go figure)-yellow. Finish was scouringly dry with a lemony taste that made me long for my (now-deceased) great-aunt's lemon chiffon cake. For the summer, this is perfect! Just watch for the lees for the uninitiated."
"Pours a cloudy orange/yellow with a large white frothy head. There is a ton of carbonation in this beer. The smell is alittle on the weak side with wheat,lemon,and sweet malt. The taste is really not that great. A nice lemon wheat summer beer with a bunch of spices? Hold the spices and this would be good,but the strong ginger flavor doesn't make it with me. The m/f is light with the strange mixture of flavors not really coming together. A strange beer, not horrible,but it just didn't do it for me."
"I was expecting this beer to be a lot worse than it was, actually decent for its price, have not had many heavily spiced lagers but this seemed to work fairly well, might drink again at that price, probably worth trying"
" Overkill in the spice department, otherwise pretty good."
"This had a nice malt taste that blended nicely with wheat and some fruitiness to it. Just like the look, it was well carbonated. Refreshing beer."
"I really wish they'd expand the He'brew line instead of this Coney Island junk."
"Hmmm, I'm going to say this must have ginger in it. Citrus peel hop flavors with a very light malt profile, really lets the spices do their thing...not sure if that is a good thing or not in this case. Unique, fo sho. I might try this again sometime...tastes like it might be tasty on draft."
"A white lager beer,hmm somethin different.Poured into a pilsner all head and foam even with a gentle pour,it took forver to finally come down to pour more.After a long wait a lemony yellow color emerged with a spritzy-like look to it.aromas were a little faint just some toasted grain and mineral with a hint of ginger.At the beginning the flavors are light and toasty and pretty pleasent even a hint of lemon comes thru but man that finish is a little harsh,big ginger and fennel hit hard and kinda ruins the beer and its drinkibility.This beer is off kilter in a bad way,Iam not sure how old it is and its from a brewery that I respect,very odd."
"overall too much ginger (maybe a spice beer) for my liking but still drinkable."
"TYhe taste is a but unusual but with wheat-ale or witbier elements. It tastes mostly of pear and Squirt soda pop (mixed lemon-grapefruit soda pop flavour), with the Squirt taking over more, but a bit more bitter. It ends up being quite grapefruti but more in a bitter version of Squirt than the usual grapefruit character I normally encounter. It's also otherwise lacking and it's pretty one-dimensional."
"I surprisingly dug this one. I say surprisingly because it was chilled quite a bit coming out of the fridge and the first few sips were fairly run of the mill and unimpressive, with not much aroma or flavour at all coming through. Once it warmed up that all changed and a ton of stuff came popping out of this one. So...let this beer warm up a bit before enjoying. It'll make all the difference in the world. A nice second offering from me after being let down by the Blockhead. This one works for sure."
"Overall an interesting and uniquely flavored wheat ale."
"4 4 3.5 3.5"
"D - Albino Python isn't a bad brew, but there's not much there beyond the two most prominent spices. The utter palate smack of ginger and fennel sip after sip is making this bomber a bit of a chore to get there. Shmaltz is on to something here though, I just wish they could've deepened the malt character on this beer so there would SOMETHING for the spices to play off of."
"D- Sweet, fruity, and interesting. Would be nice for a spring evening. I'm glad I tried it, but I'm not blown away."
"d-very drinkable. highest points next to taste. i just wish it had some heft and staying power, but then, the alcohol level takes care of that. it's a recommended brew on most counts. i could slam through quite of few of these before i realized the consequences. but all in all, it's not a challenging, thought-provoking brew. nice 'spicebill' for sure...at least the proceeds (i believe) go to an effort to save pop culture icons like coney island."
"D: Unique for the style as they definitley unleashed the spice rack. Frankly, its drinkability dimished as I tired of the spices."
"Drinkability: This is a very pleasant wheat ale. I love the sweetness that goes along with the wheat. If the ABV was not as high, I could session this"
"22oz bottle. Poured quite clean golden, some sediment. Large white foamy head. Floral aromas, some hop, mild spice of some sort. Kind of pale, kind of white ale flavors of citrus with a small almount of sweetness, malt and sugar. I can't put my finger on the spices, coriander and ginger maybe, but rather nondescript. Very carbonated mouthfeel. Light bodied, but filling from the carbonation. Seemed drinkable until I realized I still had half of it left. Not quite sure what to make of this one...."
"Overall, not one of my favorites from Scmaltz, but I wouldn't dissuade anyone from trying it,as is an interesting brew to say the least."
"Overall, a miss for me due to the ginger ale aspect. But I can see this being a good beer if you do like ginger ale. One and done. Can only recommend if you love ginger ale. If not, avoid and try one of their other beers. One thing I did like is that they say the proceeds from this series are going to support the real Coney Island which is cool."
"Overall, I'm quite surprised. The bottle lists it as a ""white lager", and that's about what it tastes like."
"Overall- Very odd tasting. Not horrible but just unique. The licorice, ginger, clove, citrus aroma doesn't do it for me."
"D: Not very tasty, does not go down too easily, not too filling, decent kick, not the best representation of style, I just did not like very much about this beer but I suppose if someone liked the taste this would be a pretty drinkable beer."
"Worth picking up for a try. Stay away from the hair salon and styling spritz... maybe you'll make better associations than I did."
"7/4/7/3/14 (3.5/5)"
"This would be a great beer for a hot summer day, but I don't care that it's December, this is a tasty beer!"
"D: This is a varied take on the style and quite enjoyable for those inclined to experiment and venture away form their safe zone. As the lable on the bottle indicates, be careful what you whish for and be prepared to be suprised and refreshed at the same point."
"D- A really nice white ale. I'm always pleasantly surprised when my wife brings home a Schmaltz beer and this one didn't disappoint."
"Drinkability- Very good wheat beer, whatever the style may be. Good spice layout."
"Pours very wit like, pale, cloudy, the head is white and wispy and then quickly gone, leaving next to no lace. lemony, perfumed nose with a hint of lighter sweet maltyness. Light and thirst quenching, again I get the feeling this is very wit like. More lemon, more perfume, light spice (coriander & pepper), tasty stuff. Nothing real special, but a respectable warm weather quaffer."
"I would recommend this refreshing beer to a friend."
"Not sure about color because eyes were drawn to the nice white fluffy head. Nice pleasant smell of spice and wheat. Problem is that nice mix does not extend to the taste. The spice is some funky mix of lemon and ginger. Can't really taste the hops. It is drinkable being light with just a bit of carbonation."
"Bottom line: A very tasty and very drinkable American Pale Wheat that I thoroughly enjoyed. Very nicely done, Shmaltz Brewing!"
"Coney Island Albino Python, like the creature for which it was named, is an exotic beast that retains enough of the characteristics of its breed to inspire both wonder and a safe sort of familiarity. Given a chance, it just might put a stranglehold on your palate as well."
"Pours a five finger white head that fades quickly to a ring, leaving traces of lace. Murky light amber color. Good carbonation and medium bodied. Slight orange peel nose. Flavor is honey and spicy with the hops muted. $4.99 for a 22oz bottle from Manchester Wine and Liquors Manchester, CT."
"Dark Lager = Tasty, Albino White Lager = Tasty. Love it. Just like I loved Die hard 4, both the beer and movie were improbable, but you went with it..."
"D- This is a solid American Witbier that I wouldn't mind purchasing again. The higher than average ABV for a Wit limits it's sessionability, but it is a good drink regardless. Recommended."
"When poured into a Sly Fox Imperial pint glass, this python is a hazy lemon yellow with a nice looking 2 inch fluffy head of foam sitting on top of this beer. This tal head of foam had great retention that left behind 1/2 an inch white film and quite a few sticky white streaks of lace around the glass. The aroma was lightly citrusy with citrus fruits, a pinch of citrus hops, a hint of toasted wheat, a touch of sweet yeast, and then finishes up with a small whiff of candy. While the aroma was citrus based, the taste was more about the malted wheat. It was after the wheat where all the citrus flavors came out. I thought that was the end of the taste, but there was a little more after the citrus flavors. After the citrus flavors is where the taste gets slightly dry with a tiny touch of sweet yeast. I liked how there was plenty of wheat in here, but there were also subtle notes of citrus and sweet yeast. This was of course a light bodied beer with a faint wheat based aftertaste of malted wheat, lemon peel, and a subtle splash of sweet yeast. In the end, it's not a bad beer at all. I liked how it had all the right level of flavors. There wasn't too much wheat, citrus flavors, yeast, or spices. Since it's not a bad beer and it's easily affordable, it's worth a shot."
"The color revealed ro a medium pour is a mix between a dark pilsner yellow and a pale wheat ale sunshine. Just a little brisk, bone white head after the pour. The first thing that hit the nose is a strong, almost overwhelming scent of anise I could get some soft fruits under the strong herbal anise. When the yeast is swirled in from the bottom of the 22oz bottle, you get a little more fruity, clove flavors. This beer tastes like a wheat ale supercharged wth a lot of anise. A bit too much in my opinion. The sediment adds a more complex flavor profile. The palate is tart when filtered, adding the yeast dulls down the tartness fest. Coul be refreshing on a summer day, but one glass does me just fine."
"D: Overall, I liked this beer enough to buy it again. It's definitely not a 'witbier', nor is it an 'American Pale Wheat Ale' in strict terms...most obviously because a lager yeast is used. Regardless, the result is tasty and rather refreshing beer that's satisfying and continues a run of Schmaltz brews I've been impressed with. Recommended."
"Aroma is like a typical lager, but richer and with a hint of citrus. Color is clear and straw-yellow, a little darker than most lagers and more appetizing. Flavor is typical except that there an interesting sour taste, not unpleasant at all, a bit lemony. Texture is very smooth and just a teeny bit thin, but still this is a tasty and refreshing beer."
"Enjoyable and easy to drink wheat."
"Medium bodied, crisp and very drinkable, an excellent summer refresher. Well worth a try."
"-Oelergud"
"Easily drinkable with no alcohol detectable..."
"Very pale colored pour, which went along perfectly with the albino python shown on the label. The carbonation was huge, and the head very large as a result. The smell was that of banana and lavender. The taste was fluffy, and a bit too much like flower petals. The carbonation was quite active, and made the beer feel like cotton candy in the mouth. There was not much to this little beer. Next time they should try to get a giant python and not a pygmy one."
"This was pretty good. Not sure if it's any better than a traditional witbier or brewed just to be different as a lager. Ginger has a fair amount of presence in this beer and helps to definitely make it unique."
"A bit of a weird beer here. A Belgian Wheat beer but the licorice flavor throws me off."
"Certainly unique for the ""style"" - not sure that it fits one, which is fine, as it doesn't really seem to intend to. It does say it's a lager - but it sure is different...Heavily spiced. A bit too much so for my taste, but an ""interesting"" one, nevertheless."
"The beer pours a pale gold color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a light and refreshing pale and wheat malt scent along with some lemon peel and clove aroma. The taste is good also. It tastes much like the aroma with a dry fruity finish. It's an easy drinker that actually refreshes. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a low bodied beer with good carbonation. This is a very nice summer brew. It's light and easily quaffable."
"Through the roof drinkability, one of the best American Pale Wheats out there. Would love to see this in sixers & or cans"
"D - definitely enjoyable. I'm glad Shmaltz is experimenting more with these lighter and interesting styles lately. Don't get me wrong, I'm a dyed-in-the-wool hophead, but it's nice to experience these lately. Enjoyable. Would recommend everyone check them all at least once."
"D: Pretty drinkable as I could finish the whole bomber. An interesting take on the American Pale Wheat Ale."
"This is what more lagers should strive to be. Terrific to drink and quite enjoyable from start to finish. Well done, Shmaltz!"
"Drinkability: Pleasant, spicy lager that's plenty tasty, though I could use a tad lighter carbonation."
"Poured from bottle into chalace. Wheat brew like color with a one finger head on pour. White head with moderate lacing. Sharp spices on the nose, mild malts in the background, some lager yeast there. Wow, I'd call this a christmas brew. Nutmeg like spices thrown in dominate this brew. Nicely carbonated, good feel on the tongue, very easy to drink without the heavy flavors that most seasonal brews have. Good drink for switch up on the good ol palette."
"Mouthfeel was light and crisp; easy to drink. Neither particularly impressive, nor unpleasant. Highly drinkable and very sessionable, IMO. This is a fantastic, and very unique offering from Shmaltz Brewing. Will buy again."
"There is a gracious plenty of carbonation, to be sure, nearly to excess, but it fits the crisp, zingy nature of the beer and helps the drinker to indulge the ""inner beer freak""... as commanded by the devilclown from the neckband of the kitschy-cool, pop-art-festooned label."
"I could put back a few, but would choose others."
"D - Leave it to He'Brew to come out with a completely unique beer. Interesting flavor that really surpried me."
"And, to give it another plus, one of the coolest, sexiest pieces of label art I've ever seen. Especially if you're into chicks getting it on with snakes."
"Coney Island Albino Python pours a hazy yellow with an enormous white head from a brown twenty two ounce bottle. The aroma is very mild, but it is definitely spices. A hint of ginger, perhaps some citrus. The flavor is nice, citrus is pronounced and there is a very minor note of spices. Nice, definitely worth a try."
"Drinkability: A solid and a bit spicier domestic example of the style. I really like Shmaltz and this did not disappoint at all. Plus the labels are always decorative and awesome. Highly drinkable and worth it for sure. I wonder if they'll ever do 6-packs. I hope so."
"D - excellent summer beer."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Mouthfeel is light and prickly with the carbonation. Quite quaffable and refreshing."
"Bomber pours a hazy straw yellow body with a tall vanilla head that deposits some puffy and splotchy lacing. Aroma is lemony citrus, hay, coriander, ginger, and pepper. Light medium body with seltzery carbonation. Taste has a lemon rind dry bitterness with a subtle spicing of ginger and pepper. Just a hint of malt sweetness. Spices in no way detract here. An excellent summer beer that is highly drinkable."
"D: very intriguing flavors. never had a lager like this before. definitely worthy of a try."
"The beer poured a hazy yellow with a thick, white head into a chalice. The smell was the classic Belgian yeast bubble-gum aroma. The taste was more of the Belgian yeast, but will a very noticable coriander presence and some other spices I couldn't identify. The carbonation was good, and the beer was light and refreshing, but I think HeBrew went a little overboard with the coriander. In my opinion, less would have been more, but still a pretty darn good beer."
"bottle. i could've also had it on tap at Blind Tiger Ale House, but there were so many choices that day. cloudy, pale yellow in color, like Lemonade with honey. had a very fizzy head, like a wheat beer, with only a thin ring clinging to the glass. smelled yeasty with lemon peel, honey & lime, like a cider. the taste was pretty nice... lemon and herbs, mint, ginger, white pepper were all there... like a Ricola throat drop. very bubbly and gassy, like champagne. maybe a little too gassy. i started to feel a little bloated. i'd have to say that this is certainly unique perfect for summer!! the label is also quite appealing, with a voluptous woman holding and almost kissing an albino python with a snakeskin background. Cool idea, definitely novel."
"D- Sorry, I like Wit biers, but I wouldn't, and couldn't have another of these beers. Maybe there was a problem with this keg, but it didn't seem infected."
"Wow. A very light sunny yellow color - cloudy, peachy. Is this what an unfiltered Budweiser would look like? Creamy/ foamy white head. The nose is citrus zest and lemon lollipop. The flavor is a muted more of the same. Prickly carbonation on a light body. The carbonation makes it feel fuller, but don't get fooled. An interesting twist on a witbier as it is a lager. This is a better version of Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat, but still not something I would buy. It's kinda got my stomach all gassy. But I love the way it looks in the glass."
"I think that this ""White Lager"" style turned out fairly well for the most part, with the crisp nature and hoppy profile of an American Lager mixing well with the full flavored zesty nature of a Hefe or Witbier. Drinkibility was very nice. I paired this up with some barbecued chicken, grilled sausage, and corn on the cob for a perfect Summer afternoon meal."
