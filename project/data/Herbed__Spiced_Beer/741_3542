4.1,11.1,4,4,4,4,4.5,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/29/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, honey, toast, brown bread, plum, fig, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, and herbal/spice earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, spices, and dark fruit notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, honey, toast, brown bread, plum, fig, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, ginger, and herbal/spice earthiness. Slight spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, honey, toast, brown bread, plum, fig, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and herbal/spice earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, spices, and dark fruit flavors; with a great malt/spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, fairly creamy, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with a small-moderate warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent winter spiced ale. All around great robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, spices, and dark fruit flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 25, 2015"

Taste starts with the clove and cinnamon and moves to the nutmeg, and stays sweet throughout. A hint of orange comes in at the aftertaste, then the cinnamon and clove linger. The high ABV comes through at the end of each sip, easy to tell that it is much higher. A medium mouthfeel, not super smooth, but nice, the noticeable ABV takes away from the beer.

The malt, however, shines through that dense jungle of spice brilliantly. The taste is nice and malty with all of those wonderful holiday spices. there is also a moderately bitter hop presence. The finish is very bread-like, almost to the point that you can chew on it. There is moderate carbonation with a moderately full mouthfeel.

The beer's spicy aroma and full, rich flavor work well with it's high alcohol and warming feel but I seem to enjoy this (especially when compared side-by-side) with a year on it. Luckily Lakefront released a plethora of Vintage 2011 where the alcohol is more subtle and the spice, believe it or not, seems to shine with a little more cheer.

4.2,13.8,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Wow, this one turned out to be a good pick. The brownish red color suggests a heavier brew, and the aroma of sweet malt, cinnamon, and plumb encourage it even more.

Smell is of malt, honey, and lots of spice aromas. Taste is of malt, caramel, honey, and a spice overload. There is no real bitterness per se but the spices do linger on the palate with each sip. This beer has a crisp mouthfeel which feels weird with the spices in the beer. Overall, this is a pretty good Winter warmer but nothing I would buy again.

A good whiff of the nose led me to believe that (at least) clove, cinnamon and allspice went into its production. There was an orange-citrus scent also, but the honey was lost in the mix. Color was a deep dark-brown with cola highlights. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full with a lot of spice evident in the mouth. I stand by my claim of cinnamon and clove, since they were the most powerful flavors on the tongue. Finish was dry, spicy and pleasant.

Popping the top I get a big waft of cloves, allspice and cinnamon, not unlike a pumpkin pie. Pours into a tulip glass a deep root beer color with a medium bubble head that wisps away. On the taste, this brew start with a big syrup-thick mouthfeel, very high viscosity. The taste has an upfront spicyness just like the smell. The middle taste has some roasted malts, then the finish has a dry chocolate slight bitterness. All this while maintaining spice flavors through the whole taste.

The nose comprises cinnamon, nutmeg, mandarin oranges, some pinches of brown sugar, and an underlying aquifer of bland liquid pumpernickel. Honestly, I think I was expecting a bit more in my 'strils. The taste reminds me of gingerbread drizzled with a tropical fruit cocktail, the kind Dole likes to overcharge for. You know what I'm talkin' about. A hint of what seems like spearmint comes forth in the finish, but luckily this is a minor occurrence. Unfortunately, following this is a blast of sickly sweet nothingness. Those were the words my brain formulated on the spot, and those are the words I'm gonna stick with. Suffice it to say that the back end of the finish is rather cloying. The body is a lumbering medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly wet feel. Overall, what was probably a delicious-sounding recipe comes out a bit below par.

Cloying spicyness melds with the sweetness, yielding something like spiced eggnog mixed with a can of One Pie. Not too appetizing. Thick mouthfeel, relatively mild carbonation. With this and many other winter warmers, I keep thinking of the word ""restraint!"". As in, the brewers should use some. Too much spice, too much sweetness, nothing subtle or balanced here.","geexploitation","Feb 12, 2006"

4.7,27.4,4.5,4.5,5,4.5,4.5,"Clear maroon color, small off-white, slightly red head. A very well spiced beer, lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in the nose. Really doesn't smell or taste anything like your average beer of any style, that's what's great about the winter warmer, it's a style based on a goal, rather than ingredients or brewing style. Taste is dominated by mulling style spice flavors combined with alcohol to do exactly what the style suggests. Medium mouthfeel, with some alcohol burn. Good drinkability. A perfect beer for a cold winter's night.","TastyTaste","Dec 04, 2004"
4.05,9.8,4,4,4,4.5,4,"Surprisignly delicious. Follows a path similar to that of their Pumpkin Ale, but goes far beyond anything that beer will achieve. Not only is the flavor a welcomed surprise, its body is also quite memorable. Rethinking my holiday strategy once again....","Skidz","Nov 23, 2004"
3.72,0.8,4,4.5,3.5,4,3,"Mouthfeel is good...it has a nice creamy quality to it, body is a little bit thin though. I probably couldn't drink more than one or two of these due to the powerful spiciness. However, it does make for a nice treat on a cold December evening.","orbitalr0x","Nov 16, 2004"
4.15,12.5,4,4,4,4.5,4.5,"Dark copper appearance, clear. Head builds to just under 1/2 an inch, lasts a good amount of time. Punctuation mark laces on the glass. The aroma is largely from spices, seems typical in the pie spice realm, nutmeg, cinnamon, some mace. Body is lightish but the carbonation is lower, giving the impression of a coating texture. Starts out with flavors that mirror the smells, a bit of orange adds brightness, but nutmeg and spice dominate the beer. Surprising for a brew with honey, the sweetness is low and the overall profile ends with a bitter and almost tobacco-like aftertaste. Hard to tell where a hop contribution begins. Not cloying or overly sweet, this is a nicer beer in the holiday mix.","ADR","Beers"

This baby packs old school Holiday Spice punch. The Spices are blended masterfully and the aroma screams Winter! I have been waiting and it paid off!

3.43,-7,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,3,"The taste is not unlike the aroma, very heavily spiced with, well, Christmas spices, and a hint of pine. There is also a very significant blast of orange flavor as well, interesting taste, but if it were not for the carbonation you'd almost think this was a spiced wine. In addition, I wonder how this would taste if I were to warm it up. Point being it is that spiced of a Holiday/Christmas beer. Great between Thanksgiving and St. Swivens day, not as appropriate on Good Saint Patricks Eve, but still tasty. Its rather high in alcohol, and a pint goes a long way, but I'll look for this next Christmas.","jackndan","Jan 31, 2004"
3.97,7.6,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Stumbled across this one in a health store of all places. Pours a dark amber with a small head. Aroma is full of holiday spices as promised. Ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg you name it, it's all there except for the 9.5 Abv. Body is medium to light and smooth finishing with a crispness. Flavor is on the sweet side with most of the spice coming on top of a light hop flavor. Warming alcohol in the finish. Overall a fairly decent winter warmer.","BierReise","Jan 20, 2004"
4.42,19.8,4,4.5,4.5,4,4.5,"Pours a reddish brown sort of hue with a very long lasting white head which leaves nice lacing down the sides of my glass.

4.17,13,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Medium amber colored, lightly hazy, tight head of small bubbles. Mega spicy aroma. Honey, all spice, coves & ginger bread all come & go. Taste is apples & crisp at first, & becomes warming smooth creamy malt in the middle. Stays a bit too thin in the mouth feel. Never sits down on the pallet. Could probably stand a year laying down. Seems like its maybe 6+%.","Ave","Dec 09, 2003"

4.47,21.1,4.5,5,4,4,5,"Light brownish, burnt orangy yellow color thats quite clouded and has a strange glow from the bottom up with a medium ivory colored head from a vigorous pour, sits soft and thick but dwindles down somewhat fast; minimal stringed lace. Aroma is a whole lotta spice! Allspice, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, fly across the air and is very fresh and lovely into the nose, a light touch of dulled plum and sweet potato and toasty malts are in the back but are hard reaching due to the very spicy array this holiday keeper has. Taste is much more subdued then the smell gives way too, which is a good thing, I don't think I would like a glass of allspice, would you? But the spices are there but favorably mixed with a soft toasted Vienna-like maltyness with a slight sweetness underneath some of the allspice and ginger. Quite a nice semi-milding taste thats very pleasant and subtle. Good medium body feel and has a lingering spiced dryness for the finish. The 9.5% ABV surprised me, its no where to found if that is truely the ABV, no where. This was gone in no time and goes down super easy with a good little zip of spice. More please.

4.17,13,3.5,4,4.5,4,4,"Uncapped one of these while putting up the Christmas tree the other night. Bottled the first week of November, 2002. Poured a hazy dark ruby brown with a large rising light tan head. Festive aroma consisted of nutmeg, cinnamon, plum, ginger and malt. Medium bodied and smooth with a slight tingle upfront. Hint of orange zest. Intringuing gingerbread-like malt finish. The heavy alcohol is transformed into an almost brandy-like flavor in conjunction with all the spices. A very delicious and potent winter beer.","Winter","0"
