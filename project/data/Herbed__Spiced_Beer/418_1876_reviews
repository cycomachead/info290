"O- I bought this as something different and really wanted to like this.  It has a very clean taste but leaves much to be desired.  I was expecting a well rounded beer but this just tastes an attempt to create something different for the sake of being different.  Though it has a strong ginger taste as you drink more it feels unbalanced and unrefined. The body feels too thin without much complexity.  If your expecting ginger you get it.  I don't really think I would try this again unless it was free."

"JuJu is a seasonal beer that I usually look forward to but now it seems lack luster. It's missing the spices that one would expect out of a good ginger beer, maybe a little watered too. It's still a low abv beer that I don't mind saving for warmer days in the springtime, though. Prob not $11 a 6 pack worthy either if i may say so."

"Very weak and watery but has slight ginger flavor and it is very refreshing (summer / food) beer."
""
" The taste is very good I expected ginger but this is really tasty with fresh spice and citrus with subtle malt sweetness to back it up and the mild lemon element with ginger continuing in a mild way throughout with clean yeast and light toasted flavor in the malt. Overall I really enjoyed the tropical quality and refreshing taste in this sessionable ale -recommended if you enjoy a summer-refresher type of ginger beer, I would drink this frequently"

"Light refreshing beer. Great use of ginger!"

"A bold honey gold liquid with a lovely, lacey foam topping with excellent sticky lacing as it dissapates. Ginger in the nose, very sweet and fruity and spicy. Taste is pretty good, lots of upfront ginger but never with that vinegar-kick most people associate with sushi ginger. This is the essence of ginger, not overpowring. Low hops, quite paletteable."
""
""
""
""
"This is an unusual flavor, and it goes great with Asian food because of the ginger.  If you're in the mood for something different, look to this one.  Very light on the alcohol, but still very flavorful, and not what you're used to drinking."

"Very refreshing. The ginger only hit me on the nose and first taste, then it turns into a nice ale. Different and fun."
""
""
""
""

"Nice, light and effervescent.  You definitely taste the ginger, but it's not overwhelming.  There's a bit of bitterness, but a pleasant bit of citrus too."

"BBD 9/22/14. Clear amber pour that has just a touch of garnet with an acceptable head. Lacing and retention are typical for the style and fade away after a few minutes. The magnificent nose is of ginger over a biscuit background sweetness. Light medium body that is nice and smooth in texture. Above average carbonation with a strong burst of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is quite nice and focuses on ginger. It delivers the ginger at just the right level and balances it against a toasty slight biscuit sweetness. It finishes with a crisp effervescent burst of ginger and hop flavor over biscuit. An outstanding clean crisp use of ginger."
""
""
""
"In all honesty, I don't get it. It seems like an amateur offering, one that could use some tweaking before hitting the bottling line. If you like light ales that border on 'watery', but have nuances of spiciness and one-note of ginger, then I guess you should get yourself some o'that Good Juju."
"Overall, an easy drinking beer that could've benefited from a little more depth/complexity."
""
""
""

"Overall - Not a great beer, but definitely not the worst beer I've rated. Probably wouldn't purposefully choose it again."

"O: I love ginger, and I commend Left Hand's usage of it in this beer. It's real good. Right now it is 80 degrees outside and I about chugged half the glass in a couple minutes. This beer is fantastic while in the recommended 40-45 degree range. Once it started warming up it started losing its pop. But I will say it is crazy drinkable in this weather."

"O-drinks almost like a dry club soda with ginger. Very interesting brew and I honestly enjoyed that it wasn't complicated by a lot of other flavors or sweetness"
""
""
"Perhaps a ginger beer is not my forte, as I'm not a big fan of ginger root even on sushi, but this seemed to have a weakness and one dimensionality that just didn't sell. The color was light and watery but presented a thick fluffy head. The aroma and taste were the same as ginger pervades with a watery herb twangy finish. Perhaps ginger beer is not my forte....oh yeah, I already said that."

"Overall: Quite an enjoyable beer. It definitely deserves the right food pairing to go with it, though. I'm thinking I'll have a few with my next trip to my favorite Thai restaurant. With that being said, I can't see it being a staple in my refrigerator for the season. It will, however, be an interesting diversion from the same session ales I normally take to get togethers."

"Overall- A grown-up ginger ale. Not bad but not something that I would try again."
"Pure, simple, natural ingredients: rocky mountain water, malted barley hops, yeast and organic ginger. This beer tastes like ginger ale for grown-ups. It is more delicate than I expected, balancing the carbonation, malt and ginger to make it taste...quite honestly, more like a real soda that isn't too sweet. It's a very drinkable, refreshing summer beer if you like ginger ale."
"3.5 D: I will probably drink this more than my scores suggest. While it isn't a great beer overall, it has a lot of ginger in it, which is a flavor I can't get enough of."

"O: This beer tastes a lot like real ginger ale (not the sweetened stuff like Canada Dry of Schweppes) with a very light amount of ginger spiciness but enough to be enjoyable. Easy to drink and refreshing with a low ABV - this would pair well with Asian foods and could be sessionable in the right pairing."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Pretty much a pale ale with ginger. The ginger is incorporated nicely, adding flavor without becoming overbearing. A refreshing quaff that really hit the spot on this hot and humid night."
""
""
""
""
"This is another pleasant surprise for the summer... I am a fan of ginger so I tend to pick up ginger beers/ales when I see them. Most of them tend to be of the novelty variety that no matter how much i might enjoy them, i never want more than one at a time... This one is different. I could drink this all the time. I spent most of my early beer drinking summers with a tecate and lime... this has the same refreshment with out the skunk."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This beer makes me want some sushi! Nothing much going beyond the pickled ginger flavor though.... If it's a hot day and you love the taste of ginger, then this guy is a really easy drinker, and at 4% it's an easily manageable session beer. If you don't like ginger, I'd stay away because you're not gonna find anything else to review from this beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O-There is not much going with this brew once you move past the ginger flavor. I understand that this is a warm-weather session-type beer, but the ginger is a bit cloying for all-day drinking and, regardless of the summertime intentions, I would like to see a bit more beer/malt backbone to support the surprisingly real ginger flavor here. Save this brew for the hottest dog days of summertime."
""
"O - People will either love or hate this based on their preference for the spice. I thought this was a really interesting beer that does one thing, and does it very well."

"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, best before 9/7/2013. Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, ginger, honey, bread, floral, grass, light clove, light caramel, and herbal earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of ginger, hop, and malt notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, ginger, honey, bread, floral, grass, light caramel, light clove, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of lemon zest, ginger, honey, bread, floral, light clove, and light caramel on the finish for a short bit. Nice balance of malt, ginger, and light hop flavors; with a fair amount of flavor robustness, and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied; with a smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with no warming noticed after the finish as expected. Overall this is a nice spiced session beer. Good balance of malt, ginger, and hop flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering."
""
"This may be light. This may be low in alcohol. This may be simple and just citrusy. But it surely is refreshing and tasty. This could be a great summertime session beer, much better than your run-of-the-mill lawnmower beer. Very fine flavors and superb drinkability. Great with food. I enjoyed this. Give it a try."

"Pours an orangish golden with a slight white head. Smell is pretty much straight up pickled ginger, like I what you get at a sushi bar. A touch of sweet malt is hiding out in there too though. Flavor follows suit, A crisp, active mouthfeel. Overall, the beer is bright, crisp and refreshing but you better love pickled ginger to dig this. Unfortunately for me, I don't like picked ginger."
""
""
"You know, this is rated pretty low outside of Beeradvocate. But you know what? Although it's nothing to write home about, it's a decent beer. I only bought one bottle at a store where I usually buy a bunch of singles, but had I bought a 6-pack, I wouldn't be upset. I don't always have the best vocabulary when describing beers, but I can at least say that I'm not one to favor one style too much over another, and I've tried over a thousand different beers (although I've only rated a few), and this one doesn't belong at the bottom of the list; maybe just below the middle. Not bad."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"The beer pours a clear honey-golden color with almost no head or visible carbonation. The nose is spicy, profoundly gingery, with a touch of molasses-like sweetness. The taste is as expected with good malt sweetness playing off the ginger like a ginger snap. Unfortunately, this beer was severely undercarbonated and came across as being a bit too syrupy. It also lacked the ginger bite that I was expecting in the aftertaste. Overall, this beer is tasty, worth trying, probably pairs well with many spicy food options, but isn't a repeat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall very refreshing and a good summer beer. If youre not into ginger stay away but worth a try if youre into the flavor. Can only imagine pairing this with some Thai food."
"Probably the first Ginger-type beer I’ve tried, but I didn’t hate it. I’d probably try it again."
""
""
""
"O-First time I've had the style and it's not too bad. A good, unique session beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, this comes across as a rather watery pale ale into which a large dollop of ginger has been added. The ginger notes by themselves are nice, but could use a stronger support group. On the other hand, the ginger and weaker beer notes mean this would make a good accompaniment to a plateful of sushi, and the overall lightness makes for decent summer fare."

"i got my growler filled with this yesterday at my local beer store. i have never had a ginger beer before. i actually like this a pretty good bit. the smell is pretty packed with ginger. the taste is good too...i think there is a nice little ginger taste here also. the only complaint that i have is that there is a pretty week finish. i would like for the flavor to push on through. but over all this is a worthy effort."
"A so-so beer, could stand to have more ginger to it. Nothing bad about it, but it just feels bland. Worth trying if you like beers flavored with ginger, but probably not otherwise."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"An interesting but ultimately not very drinkable beer. I certainly would never buy a 6-pack of this, even if I were looking for a summer thirst quencher. It just doesn't strike that balance. It's not that it's a bad beer, it's just not something I really care for. The body is way too thin and watery and there isn't any malt to back up the taste. It needs more residual sweetness and body. If they adjusted the recipe to do that, it could potentially attract some of the ginger ale crowd."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I had a little bit of high hopes for this beer cause I am a fan of Left Hand Brewing, but alas I was left unfulfilled and disappointed. There is no body and very little flavor. There was the essence of ginger, but that quickly disapeared. A bit of ginger in the aroma but overall this beer was lackluster. If not for that little essence of ginger this beer would be completely bland. Long story short, I will probably never have this beer again."
""
""
""
"You keep wanting to go in to get that initial flavor, but it dissipates so fast and really needs to be more well rounded."

"Review from 2/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a light yellow amber with a minimal white head and little lacing. Aroma of ginger and faint malt. Flavor is very dry with a hint of honey with ginger at the start, then just ginger, finishing with a dry, faint light hop and lager malt flavor. The ginger is nice, but little else going on. Light bodied."
""
"How much enjoyment is had from those beer depends on how Much you like ginger."
"great beer. smell and taste of ginger really is so soothing. nothing special about the appearance or mouthful but it lives up to the name it is given ""good juju"" I think i'll be drinking some more good juju soon and often. Left Hand does it again!!!!"
""
""
""
""
""
"O: If you're a fan of ginger, you might enjoy this beer. As a ginger drink, it's actually quite enjoyable, but as a beer, it fails in several respects."
""
""
"O - Overall though I Was rather disappointed with this beer. I was expecting ALOT more ginger but instead I have a much more malt heavy beer than I prefer. Oh well, for the $2 it cost me its not too bad."
""
""
""
""
""
"Pours a hazed golden color, fizzy white foam cap stays a while and leaves some rings of lace. In the smell, herbs, lemongrass, ginger and wheat. A bit of a bready smell lingers and the ginger is right there. The taste follows the nose with a solid dose of ginger, herbal tea, lemon grass, and earthy hop notes. There is definitely some citrus and wheat malt flavors. Lots of ginger and a semi dry clean finish. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Overall, an interesting beer with a unique flavor twist. Had it paired with Asian BBQ wings, pretty decent."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall -- Interesting, it almost doesn't feel or taste like a beer in any way. I'll enjoy the sixer, but won't be visiting this one again."
""
""
""
""
"O: Not a bad beer, much better than I expected. Seems to go best with the summer weather."
""
"O: Not a bad brew overall. Nice mix of ginger spice with the piney hops. Wouldn't wanna have more then one or two at a time but another good job by the guys at Left Hand Brewing walking the wire and experimenting with different flavor combinations."
""
"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, oddly the freshness date is blank on this one. This pours a fizzy short lived white head, this color is an almost golden color. The smells are of ginger, a little sweetness, no real hop presence. The feel is medium to light. The taste is okay, a nice amount of ginger, a little bitterness from the ginger, okay not bad."
""
""
""
"Overall its not really distributed around here (like every left hand brew) but it wasn't as bad as I thought. Worth trying if you like ginger ale."
""
""
""
"O:  I didn't really know what to expect seeing that this was my first herb beer.  I think it was successful but boring at the same time.  Flavors were good but lackluster. I really want to try more of this style to truly see how this stacks up an I will revisit it in the future. "
""
""
"Very High D+"
" Overall this beer seems best suited to follow mowing your lawn or after being in the hot sun. It has the right balance of a standard lager with a slight ginger twist. It's weaker than a shanty and leaves a bit for any ginger beer lover."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - Once again, I love that the ginger shines. The main ingredient should be showcased and presented in its most natural form in my opinion. Well done."
""
""
""
"Overall: This beer left no positive impression on myself; it is comparable to a ginger flavored mainstream lager such as coors light, etc"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"I love anything with ginger but could not detect any ginger flavor. Metallic smell that affected the flavor. I'm fairly forgiving but this is a real disappointment. In order to get to my character minimum will add that it is a beautiful evening along the front range in Colorado."
"O- spice and ginger lead this brew in a watery way its just average and uneventful low ABV makes it drinkable but not much going on here"
"O: It's an interesting take on a spice beer. I don't mind it, but I'm not sure I'm a huge fan of ginger. With that being said, it's a well made beer that is mostly either love it or hate it. With me, I'm a bit in between. Then again, there's probably a reason this one sat in my fridge for close to a year."

"very interesting brew, made with potent fresh ginger in high quantities. pours a clearish golden color with the slightest copper hue and an average thin white head. smells like fresh ginger, like a canada dry ginger ale softdrink. no hops to speak of here, just a sugary syrupy ginger essence. flavor is definitely featuring the ginger, but there are some pale malts in there to give some body, and a gentle hopping that combines with the ginger for a crisp refreshing finish. this isnt my favorte lefthand beer, but because of its bright carbonation and refreshing flavor, it would make a nice summer afternoon session. i also like it better than any other ginger beers ive had."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Too strange for me. Maybe after I finish all of the six pack I'll have developed a taste for it, but not so far."
""
"Pours a hazed gold, lots of bubbles, prickly white head, gone quickly. Scent brings fresh ground ginger root and citrus rind, little touch of acidity hinted at, but little malt. Taste brings strong, fresh ground ginger root, mildly refreshing, touching on harsh, adequate citrus and lightly sweet malts, splash of acidity. Lighter side of medium bodied, very bubbly. Alright brew, not as refreshing as I would have hoped from the style."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This doesn't have the best drinkability. It goes down pretty easy, but the flavor just doesn't quite work for me. There is an odd sweetness at the end and just too much ginger for me. Overall, I think this is a unique beer that I'm sure some will enjoy, but it just wasn't really for me. It is worth trying though."

"The toasted malts mixed with some earthy, musty hops and the ginger make for a musty, earthy and light bodied beer. Easy to drink thanks to teh watery mouthfeel, but lacking in flavor."

"O: Interesting beer. Tastes like a good standard ale infused with gingerbread or ginger candy. Being that I like ginger, I like this beer."
""
""
""
"Taste is just as boring. I get some almost metallic undertones and the ginger doesn't show up until the back end. Not my favorite offering from the good people at left hand."
"O: A pretty good beer. Rather refreshing. Sweetish and soda-like. Low ABV. Can't say I'd drink it again, but it wasn't bad. Just not my type of beer."
"Poured pale golden with thin head that didn't last. I found a light honeyed quality on the nose but then a hint of those hockey pucks in the men's urinals. On the palate, the ureic element was there as the ginger just wenttoo far and evoked a urine quality. Too much ginger. Light otherwise, with little to enjoy if you don't dig the ginger whollop."
"O: Was expecting a much more intense ginger flavor, but this wasn't overdone."
"Reviewed from notes. Had on-tap at a bar in downtown Columbus. I was eager to try this as I am a fan of Left Hand's stuff and wanted to try before buying a six of Good Juju. Appearance upon arrival was golden in color with very little head that left lacing around the glass. Smell of ginger is distinct and I'm wondering if this will be ginger overload or what as I take a sip...everything is present in the front, though no where near the ginger I was expecting, clean yet flat finish. Wow, I was not expecting this to be underwhelming, mild taste of ginger and a quick crisp honey like taste and even a little hop before a rather bland drop off...I'm very surprised with the mildness of the ginger, it's like a hint of ginger more smell then taste even. This was a one and done for me, not bad, just wanted a little more."
"Overall: Very drinkable beer. Nothing truly special otherwise."
"Overall Drinkability - Almost worth trying once. Not a bad beer, just not terribly noteworthy. Would be interesting if it weren't so watery."
"O: An underwhelming beer in almost every regard. Small on aroma, small on flavor, small on substance, no complexity. When I write that it sounds worse than it actually is. The fact is that there is just nothing to recommend this beer. Honestly, I would rather drink a normal (good) ginger ale, like Vernor's"
"Will certainly have again! Good idea for a ginger ale substitute."
"12oz bottle. Pours a translucent golden color with very little head. No lacing. Aromas of malt and spices. A bit earthy and floral. Taste is very thin and watery. There is some ginger flavor to it along with some malt. Doesn't pack much punch in the flavor department but I guess too much ginger would be tough to take. Bit of an odd aftertaste as well. Slightly metallic. I guess this would be alright in the summer, but I can see drinking more than one of these a day due to the spice flavor. Overall, I'm glad I tried it and I'm even happier that it was in a mix 12 pack and I didn't buy it on its own. Not really worth having again."
"Atmosphere is okay. No real head or lacing to speak of. Nose is light as is the flavor. Overall, this is a good quaff."
"What a shame that all the beer was enough - with a balanced body - to establish itself as a very large."
"Really liked the revamped artwork on the bottle for this one. It caught my eye enough that I didn't even think about buying it I just knew I had to. The beer poured out as a light golden color with a fizzy white head on top. Not much head or lacing on this brew at all. The smell of this beer has a healthy amount of Ginger. The taste of the Ginger was pretty intense as well with a bit of malt sweetness in there also. The mouthfeel was pretty good, it had a nice sharp and crisp feeling to it, pretty refreshing too. Overall I am reviewing this one for a second time because I'm much more impressed with this beer now than I was before."
"In general, Good Juju successfully included ginger in the recipe and flavor profile without creating any muddled or overbearing qualities, positively qualifying it the identity of a 'beer brewed with ginger,' and while I feel that this beer does the world of ginger a great favor, this use of ginger does little for the world of beer."
"Right now it just stands alone, and it’s not working out. It also would do it wonders to make this a creamier offering. Then, and only then, do I think this would be worth a try."
"This is a total miss for me. I don't mind the flavor of ginger in general, but contained in a beer with little else to complement the flavor, it just doesn't resonate with me. Glad I only bought a single of this one."
"O: Even on a hot day this beer just does'nt make the cut."
"It's not a bad beer but way too light for my liking. The juju is not strong enough in this one."
"Pours a deep yellow-gold. Very few carb trails to see, and but a wisp of a ring hangs around. Smell reminds me of melons - mellow and also slightly sweet. Taste rolls from some bitters into a healthy dose of ginger, and then back to a nice malty backing. Mildly complex. Finishes tart and tight. A decent brew, interesting for sure."
"This was unique, but just average on the taste. I could see it pairing well with the right food."
"Found this beer at the beer store. I have never had anything from Left Hand Brewery which is why I decided to try Good JuJu. I got it in a bottle. The appearance is rather traditionl. The taste is surprsingly good. I haven't got a random beer taste this good in a while. The smell is sweet with ginger tang. The beer is smooth going down and pretty easy to drink. It has sweet taste but not terribly fruity. I highly recommend this beer if you're lucky enough to have the opportunity."
"Mouthfeel - very light, which i enjoyed on a nice hot summer day. light body, light carbonation. reminded me of a radler from austria except with ginger instead of lemon and less carbonation"
"Overall: excellent lawnmower beer, something good to just have around in summer when the Texas heat really starts getting to you but not something I would go to extremes to find. If you know somewhere that carries it go ahead and pick up a six pack but don’t sweat it if you can’t find it. That being said the bottle artwork is worth the purchase price… one of my favorite beer labels bar none."
"This brew pours a slightly hazy golden color topped with a tiny head. There's absolutely huge visible carbonation. Aroma has spicy ginger, zesty hops, and some bready malts. The taste is quite good, the ginger is huge at first. It's a ginger beer though, what else would I really expect? There's some nice herbal hops to back it up, along with a decent malt backbone. The mouthfeel is nice, it's very carbonated and goes down easily. The drinkability is rather good, but I'm not sure how a session with these would go. Overall, a great beer for the ginger fan, I'm sure a huge ginger ale fan would love this beer."
"The beer is an orange copper color with a very thin white head. Smells of nutty caramel malt, honey, and barely a hint of ginger. The taste has more ginger in it, along with flavors of lemon bread and a spicy aftertaste. It seems thin and watery but has a pleasant dry finish. This is an OK beer, I wouldn't seek it out or anything."
"This beer is pretty solid. Tasty and refreshing. Definitely different than what I was expecting. Easy drinking also. Would make an excellent summer session beer."
"D: Not great not bad. I like ginger so I am hoping that there might be a better one out there."
"O- I'm a big ginger ale lover and this would make a great sessionably alcoholic alternative to that. Kudos."
"Overall I would defiantly say this beer is worth trying once."
"Another winner from Left Hand. I'd like a little bit more hops just to give it a bit more complexity, still it's very good."
"Overall, disappointing."
"The ginger is not a gimick or afterthought. It is well integrated into the taste of this ale perfect for summer."
"Good summer quaff. Nothing experimental or highly flavored, but I give Left Hand credit for creating a lighter beer with some interesting flavor."
"D- Overall i liked this brew. Was expecting the ginger to overpower the brew. but it was very subtle and everything was blanced nicely. Would get this again"
"Taste is a inbetween mix of what I'd think of as a lighter blonde doppelbock and sprite. Has a smooth background of lightly bready, buttery, citrus tinted maltyness. But a push of ginger root and slightly biting carbonation pull away from the center a bit. Making for an OK experience for both the taste and the body. Which is light medium and a empty, watery finish. With all that, it does offer a nice Summery drinkability and ease. However, beyond one or two you may find yourself seeking something else. Much like I did."
"Simply a basic English-style ale. The ginger touch is nice, but I'd like to see it more intense, and the malt maltier."
"O: If you hate ginger, you'll hate this beer. If you like it, then knock yourself out."
"O: This beer is extremely easy to drink, although the ginger isn’t really strong enough to make this interesting enough to make me want to try this again."
"Light, highly carbonated, pale yellowish brown with a thin white head and descent lacing. The smell is of ginger, pale malt, hints of citrus and floral hops. The taste is bready, biscuit notes, and definitely ginger melting with floral notes. Light, crisp, and refreshing with a nice tingly bite of ginger. Very easy to drink summertime beer."
"O – Disappointed Mayfair Liquors in Denver sold me this. Not a review that reflects this beer’s true quality/value. 2.0"
"Taste definitely has a ginger presence, along with a breadiness that comes out more on the finish. The beer does seem pretty watery, however. The ginger isn't all the powerful, nor are really any of the flavors. Hops are nearly non-existent in this beer, so it finishes rather thin and watery. That said, what is there is pretty nice. It drinks extremely easily, and is a good quaffer for the hot months. I can't give it extremely high marks but decent."
"D - Very drinkable. The ginger addition, while not all that strong, is an interesting addition. Besides that, the flavors are pretty solid, nothing amazing but everything seems to work."
"This is drinkable in the best sense of the word. A good summer beer with a non-hazardous ABV makes this both refreshing and tasty. Maybe a gateway to convert a 'boring beer' friend."
"I’ve thought about picking up a six pack of Good Juju when I saw it, but rather than going “all in” with the purchase of a six pack I instead decided to pick this one up as part of a mix six. I’m digging the label, but there’s not much else to go on. Looks like it was bottled on 3/30, so this beer should be relatively fresh. I love the concept of this as a ginger ale – so let’s see if the beer measures up. Pours a deep gold with a very sturdy head. Lots of carbonation in the beer helps support the frothy head. Smell is a little bit muted (that could be me – I’m always stuffed up, especially when travelling, as I am tonight). Taste has that ginger zing you’re looking for – the bottle says refreshing and that’s probably accurate. My palate is a bit beat up so it’s tough for me to pick out the nuances of what this beer has to offer. Malt sweetness starts things off, giving way to the ginger. As carbonation scrubs that away, hop character comes through in the finish. When I first started drinking this beer I wasn’t sure what type of style it fell into, which is fine, but if you’re looking for a classification I’d say it’s somewhere in the Pale Ale category. Mouthfeel is light without ever being watery, and the beer finishes somewhere between sweet and dry. The ginger helps keep things light and leaves you wanting to drink more. This is a beer that you could easily drink several of, especially on a warm summer night. Pretty good."
"Overall- Very light and easy to drink but can't say I like its style or any of the attributes with taste or mouthfeel. I will give Left Hand a decent grade on this beer but doesn't satisfy my buds and had a weak aroma. Altogether, I would suggest many other Left Hand brews before this one. This may be their only ""drain pour"" beer on their list."
"With my face aflame from the sun of Dark Lord Day yesterday, I could use some good juju right now. The namesake beer pours a clear amber-straw topped by a short-lived finger of dirty white foam. The nose comprises wheat, light corn, very light mint, light orange peel, and flowers. The taste holds notes of orange peel, nutmeg, ginger, coriander, flowers, and grass. The body is a hefty light/light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly refreshing finish. Overall, a decently nice brew, nothing special nor anything amazing, but a nice thing to sit and drink on for a little while."
"O: I think this beer is definitely a great summer brew and super refreshing. I won't be buying it all the time--and it's not my favorite--but I enjoyed it in full."
"A nice pale amber ale with a nice foamy head, this ginger-spiced brew tingles the nose with it's pungent ginger zestiness. And despite ginger's natural health benefits (proven to help with nausea and digestive ailments), I'll admit that ginger beer isn't much more than a novelty at this point. I've always been a fan of Left Hand's brews, but this beer has me torn. It's among the better ginger beers I've had, for certain, and it's a nice diversion from the usual fruit or spice-laden ales, but I can't say it's one I'd pursue, either."
"Overall I would say this had the potential to be good but instead it came out like taking a lame pilsner and soaking ginger rot in it. It meets its name but is not a repeat beverage for me."
"Certainly an interesting beer. I'd like to try some other ginger-based brews and see how they compare."
"If I come upon this again, I'll try it again in the hopes that my bottle wasn't good."
"D: Not a terrible or undrinkable beer, but definitely not all that great."
"O: Quite interesting. I enjoyed it as it was very refreshing and a good session beer. I don't know if I would buy again, but I am glad i tried it!"
"O: A very good spiced beer in my opinion. This genre is open to quite a bit of interpretation. I am a fan of ginger in general, but know too well how it can often be too much. Juju pulls off ginger in beer very nicely."
"Loved the ginger flavor, but not one of the best spiced ales I've had. Definitely worth a try, especially if you like ginger. The beer spells fantastic! It's fresh and easy to drink. I had it poured from a bottle into a pint glass. There was very little head."
"poured from bottle (with a bottled on date of 3/14/11) into a pint glass. poured a rich golden color with very little head that disappeared quickly. has a wonderful ginger smell that is just right. goes down smooth, crisp and refreshing. the ginger sticks around just long enough. overall a good beer, would recommend to all who have not tried before."
"O- Refreshing quaffable brew."
"I think this beer could be so much more, but as is, its just an ok beer."
"O: Seems like a soda-beer combo in some ways, but the malt sweetness is more substantial and leaves a little more. Better than I expected by a pretty solid margin."
"As it was poured into a glass you could see the murky yellow form in the glass. It gave a very fruity and very ginger smell to the beer. To be honest, I was expecting a beer that over powered the senses. This beer has a robust flavor without over powering all other senses. It is like tasting a very strong fruity beer with a creamy feel to it. It is a great desert drink. Cheers."
"Good beer, not a great beer. For some reason I remember a couple years ago Left Hand making a ginger beer that was a little more flavorful and lighter and more refreshing. I'll give it a B."
"O - I am surprised that I do not disdain this, outright; I rather enjoy it."
"Picked this beer out because of the design on the bottle, glad I did. Beer poured from a twelve oz. bottle; golden color with one inch foamy head. Smell is sweet malts with some ginger but not overpowering. Taste is impressive, toasted malt goes well with ginger overtones but the spiciness of the ginger does not takeover. Good seasonal beer."
"D: Not a great beer in my opinion. Ju Ju is a solid session beer for fans of ginger or pale ale drinkers that enjoy the less hopped versions. Nothing really stood out as amazing on this beer which is a touch upsetting."
"Taste-Toasted malt, ginger spiciness. Well-balanced, ginger not overdone. Very smooth and drinkable, ESB-like in character. Would make a nice session brew at 4.0ABV."
"Overall, a decent session beer, but would probably be more enjoyable on a warm afternoon than a chill evening."
"Pretty much ho hum. Nothing really stands out, and not something I will drink a lot of. It is great that this is a low ABV session beer, but really lacking in any character."
"O - Let's just say I am glad I didn't buy the full sixer of this one, it wasn't bad drinking, just very lackluster."
"Drinkable brew, slight grassy bitterness, no alcohol present, ginger quality never gets old. I start to feel better about it the longer I stay on this one."
"Verdict: I got the impression that most of the qualities of this beer were headed for somewhere but none could agree on a place to land. If they were going for light leafy tea beer with ginger, they should have had a more agreeable mouthfeel, or vice versa for a thick, ruddy creamy feel with an appropriate taste to accompany. The balance of stats are quite off. This is a one time drink for me; I had It... I'm not a big fan. I won't write ginger beers out of my repertoire, but I didn't find this enjoyable or memorable. C+ (3.15)"
"Warm weather beer? Or perhaps a beer to have before dinner to whet the appetite? Perfect use of ginger, as it can be a beast if wielded too much. We'd love to see this root used more often in brewing, so thanks to Left Hand for reminding us."
"this could probably be a nice session beer...def....you can have multiple of these...."
"Flavors are pretty similar with a lot of mineral water quality. Mouthfeel is fairly light, but a fairly bitter aftertaste leaves a film. Carbonation is soft making it a fairly easy drinking beer. Good one to try in the summer."
"D- Surprised me, thought it would be awful, but not bad. Think it would go well with a Asian BBQ meal, perhaps a different hot day beer. Worth trying once."
"Likely that I won't buy it again. Wasn't bad, however wasn't great. Might be good when I have a sweet tooth during the summer or when I'm craving ginger (I love ginger.)"
"Served from bottle into Dogfish Head Signature glass. Pours yellow orange with a one finger white head that subsides to a minimal amount. Maintains lacing throughout the glass. The aroma is comprised of sweet malt, cloves, cinnamon, and ginger. The flavor is of sweet malt, cloves, and pickled ginger. It has a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this is a nice brew for the style. Very smooth flavor and good aroma. The pickled ginger flavor makes me think of eating sushi. A good pairing? I have no idea... But might be worth a shot for someone."
"Tried this at Fifty Brews in Orlando and wow is this a nice surprise. The smell of the beer is classic ginger, and the taste is a clean ale with a hint of ginger. Its not bland in any respect but it is also very well balanced, No overpowering sweetness and no overpowering ginger. This beer is a hit and has become one of our favorite tailgating brews. Its a shame we can't get it year round as I would seek this out."
"Poured into tulip glass - produces a 1 finger head that quickly dissapates into nothingness. No aroma of ginger, or anything discernable for that matter. Taste is a pretty bland ale - no ""spice"" or ""ginger"" that I can detect - must be so faint or sublime I just don't register it. Weak is the word. The bottle is dated best before 12/25/10 so I don't think it's a freshness issue. I just think this is really bland nothingness. Too bad - was hoping for some peppery zing or pop - JuJu is a real dud."
"Pours a copper-amber color with a good white head and some nice lacing. The nose is pretty much just taken over by a good amount of ginger. The taste is along the same lines--it's ginger, ginger, and more ginger. It's really hard to describe much on this as the spicy ginger is about all that I'm able to taste. Maybe a touch of malt in the background. It gets to be a bit much toward the end, making this a bit hard to drink all that much of."
"CHEERS!!"
"This beer has a good dark brass almost bronze color. It has excellent head and lace. It has a fruity then spicy aroma. It has a fruity taste first that is followed by a ginger cookie like taste. There are a lot of grain tones to the flavor as well with an average amount of hops. It has a good average mouthfeel with a nice carbonation bite."
"Drink: Wouldn't have another."
"This is one that was interesting to try, but I can't possibly imagine a situation where I'm going to say, ""Man, you know what would hit the spot right now..."""
"It finishes slightly sweet and a very little dryness with lots of lingering ginger, spices in general go with it. A very light bitterness and grassy hop taste, but mostly just candied ginger again."
"D - With a bit more ginger, this would be improved, but it still an easily drinkable beer - unfortunately in a slightly macro sense."
"D: Good brew for a hot day, not some thing that I would desire to have in the winter, but good none the less."
"Left Hand Brewing Company--Good JuJu--Beer Brewed with Ginger--A Refreshing Frivolity 2010-12 oz. Bottle. 4.50% ABV. 20 IBU's. (3.5 / 5.0) Foamy thin mild lace orange white head. Clear bright orange gold color. Sediment dust.Mild ginger hop front. Thin dry sweet light ginger caramel delicate sweet malt body. Refreshing smooth clean mild ginger hop end.New formulation? Fuller & more balanced. Sampled 8/13/2010. 6-Pack $8.99."
"D: Better than a macro lager, but not by much especially with the mouthfeel. The ginger keeps it a little interesting, but Left Hand should have done more with this, would make a good starter craft at least."
"O: Interesting beer and easily approachable. Could use more malt character."
"D: Very easy to drink, but the lack of hops gets to me. Maybe if the ginger had been stronger..."
"Hold your nose and dive in. And once the taste kicks in, it is a nicely delivered beer. However, I feel it is not one I'd want to fill my belly with. One is enough."
"Pours a clear, dark gold color. 1/3 inch head of a white color. good retention and slight lacing. Smells of sweet malt, ginger, slight yeast, and slight grain. Fits the style of a Herbed / Spiced Beer. Mouth feel is slightly smooth and crisp with an average carbonation level. Tastes of ginger, sweet malt, hint of hops, and a hint of yeast. Overall, not much else besides ginger unfortunately."
"drinkability: hmmm, decent beer. but I thought it woul dhave more ginger flavor. good sushi beer though."
"D - So drinkable it is too drinkable. I agree that this is a kind of ""girly"" beer - light in taste, ABV and mouthfeel. I expected a lot more."
"D: Easily drinkable and fairly balanced. I found myself tiring of ginger as I neared the end of a 12oz bottle though."
"For a much better version of this style, try Kiuchi Hitachino Nest Ginger Brew. I've also had good results brewing dark malt with added ginger and ale yeast (i.e. dark ginger ale)."
"Not in your face ginger, which I kind of remember it being a couple years ago. As it is now, it's a slightly more interesting version of a standard golden ale. It paired nicely with a fresh mozzarella flatbread on a hot afternoon."
"Pours slightly golden yellow with a delicate white head. The smell is full of ginger aroma, some citrus and some subtle malt sweetness. I have had some ginger beers before, but as far as ginger aroma this one has them all beat. I am eager to take a sip. The ginger carries over into the taste, but is not quite as dominate. Sweet yet mild malt is the other main flavor, as well as some very noble tasting hops. The mouthfeel is light and the beer has a fairly dry finish. Very drinkable and refreshing. This is not a super exciting beer, but if you like ginger it is a good one to try. I bet it would go great with sushi."
"D- A nice, lightly flavored session beer that is a bit off the beaten path."
"Pours a clear golden with a small white head. Smells of sweet malt and a hint of ginger. Taste is light caramel sweetness up front, with a citrusy and ginger flavor in the middle and a nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel is pretty good, low carbonation. Drinkability is good, the low alcohol is a plus, quite full bodied for a true session beer. I would get this again."
"D: Low ABV but just not very good tasting.... Sadly the worst Left Hand brew I've had."
"""A refreshing frivolity"" quote on the bottle is an excellent summation of this beer."
"Mouthfeel was medium bodied with mild zestiness. I will not revisit this one but I could see where some might enjoy this refreshing session type beer."
"Impression: I like spice beers better better in their winter warmer presentations, but this one is surprisingly tasty."
"Poured into a standard pint glass, it produced a quarter inch head. The brew is a light golden color. Smells like fresh ginger root and faint malt. The taste to me is all ginger. I percieve very little else in the way of ""normal"" beer flavors. That having been said, I love the taste of ginger and this is a very clean and refreshing beverage. Very little aftertaste save for the lingering ginger flavor. I had it with pork chops roasted in a honey-mustard glaze. Great pairing."
"Orange colored beer with a rapidly fsding head,kind of looks like an iced tea.Aroma is ginger.Taste is ginger,tea leaves and a hint of lemon.Overall a decent beer that not only looks like an iced tea but also tastes like one.I think it should be tried at least once."
"D: I wouldn't want more than one of these, if even an entire one. It truly tasted like drinking tea, so I feel like this beer would only be desirable in special circumstances. Not overly refreshing due to the dryness."
"Juju delivers on what it promises. This is a tasty brew for folks who like ginger. It makes for a light and refreshing summertime quaff. If you like true ginger ale this brew should satisfy your thirst."
"Overall, this beer had potential, but the ginger just isn't strong enough. What's left is a marginal macro brew."
"D-Easy drinking but I expected a lot more from this. It tastes like they brewed a craft version of a light beer and then threw a little ginger in just for kicks."
"Could use more crisp, aggressive flavor for my taste. Malt, hops, and spice seem muddled together. Worth a try if you're looking for something different on a hot day."
"Overall this brew is highly drinkable on a hot summer day..."
"D: Pretty good, refreshing summer beer, but I'd have my reservations about having more than 2 or 3, based on the ginger wearing out the palate. Good stuff, easily quaffable, but moderately sessionable."
"Notes - Decent mouthfeel. Overall an interesting beer but maybe too different."
"Overall, not very good in my opinion. The ginger is interesting but there are too many off-notes."
"The beer pours a golden-amber color with a white head. The aroma is strong ginger. It smells about like a batch of ginger snap cookies. The flavor is more of the same. This is liquid ginger snaps. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Not sure how often I would drink this, but I am glad I got to try it at least once since it is definitely different."
"Pours a light gold with nice white head that rudely disappears without saying goodbye. The aroma is incredible, though, with killer ginger up front and mild floral notes in the background. The taste is nothing to shout from the rooftops, but is exactly what this Thai chili stir-fry needed to battle the burn in my chest. Refreshing and zesty."
"Mouthfeel is thin and watery, carbonation is fizzy."
"Feel/Drink: Thin mouth. I can only drink one of these guys, I really don't care for the taste."
"Drinkable enough, and a nice thirst-quencher. I can't see seeking it out, though."
"drinkability is fine. refreshing, you have to like ginger, though, to be able to enjoy it."
"D: Just okay. I really wanted to like it, but it just didn't quite come together."
"D - I don't really know how I feel about this beer. It isn't offensive by any means, and the ginger flavors are fairly enjoyable. I just couldn't help feeling like I was drinking a BMC with ginger added, as the base beer just isn't that impressive. An interesting brew, but I probably won't be seeking it out again anytime soon."
"D- It's impossible to take anymore but small sips of this so drinkability suffers. Not a chugging or gulping beer. I enjoy the taste, it's not horrible, but it's overpowering. I would not mind having this around while i'm eating some sushi for small sips in between, along with another beverage of course. Too much ginger, one sided."
"Taste, uh, you know, I don't like ginger with my sushi, and I guess its something psychosomatic, but the beer tastes like fish and rice. Mouthfeel of that, and drinkability, must suffer, like a Cubs fan."
"Sorry for the neg post but it was that bad for me...not my standard review."
"D: I will say that I could easily drink quite a few of these; however, there isn't enough here to keep me interested for more than a pint."
"D - Very unique flavor. Light in body and very clean in the finish. More of a summer beer IMO. A very easy drinker."
"Medium bodied and moderately firm. Clean and quite drinkable, surprising given the amount of spiciness. Kind of a one-trick pony, but would make a good food beer. Try it with sushi."
"D - I've had their stuff on tap but this is my first Left Hand review. Not too great. The flavor just doesn't come across well even if it is unique. I don't know that it could be a seven-year-old bottle. I don't think its bad in that way. Just not a delightful brew for me. I'll never pick it up again. Stranger even that I actually love ginger ale soda."
"Overall - This beer is weird... I think I like it but I'm not sure... it would probably go really good with some sweet and mild curry. I will probably buy another single in the future but I don't think I could drink a 6-pack of this."
"Drinkability: this beer is light enough in body and alcohol to be drunk in quantity, but complex enough in flavor to stay interesting through a session. From a drinkability standpoint, this beer is a great success."
"D= Tastes like a miller high life without the amazing head and fresh ginger added. Not bad by any means and the fresh ginger taste instead of a sweet candy like substitute is quite nice and a pleasant surprise. Not a bad beer but I don't think I'll be seeking it out soon."
"D- While I do find this to be a tasty beer, I do not think I could session this beer. I love ginger, and I love beer, so this hits the spot when I crave both, but I couldn't make a night of it."
"Wow this beer is kind of crazy the finish is definitely fres cut ginger, appears a slightly clouded golden apricot tone with a large billowing white head with a creamy texture. When I popped the cap it started oozing out and I spilled a bit while trying to pour it. Aroma is spicy with some mild citrus notes nice bready biscuit malt character. Flavor wise that finish is hardcore with the ginger tone, I'm guessing mild hops that are pretty much impossible to recognize with the ginger overpowering. A bit one sided on the ginger ample sweetness but sort of an astringent quality arises especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, carbonation level is a bit spritzy but not over the top. Drinkability overall, this one is a strange bird worth the experience probably goes well with some Asian cooking maybe some Thai food, or some Jerk chicken since the label is all about the Jamaica saying something about this ale is Irie."
"Taste like a ... ginger ale! Ginger is in the smell and unmistakable in the taste. Not much else to look forward to. A bit lagery. Hops not very noticeable, beer is spicy. Brewed in LONGMONT, CO. thats the only reason I got it. Wouldn't look forward to this again if somebody put it on the table for me to drink."
"M&D - a bit spicy and monotonous, but tasty as mentioned, medium bodied, may be overspiced for some, moderately drinkable"
"Drinkability is ok but not for me."
"I'd love for Southern Tier or Dogfish to try something with ginger--that would be interesting."
"Nice mild ale with a great taste."
"The beer is drinkable, but I still prefer the soft drink version."
"From the Mountain Mixer sample 12 pack"
"Drinkability: I'd love to knock back a few of these in an evening."
"Would've liked to see a more robust version of this. More ginger, more hops, more ABV. As is, a worthwhile experiment. I'm glad I tried it, but glad I didn't get a six pack."
"Will not drink this ever again."
"Would not buy this again."
"Ginger is one of my favorite flavors. This beer has a wonderful ginger taste, which is exactly what I would expect from a beer with this name. Further, there is a decent bitterness & a slight sweetness as well. I'm not a huge fan of spiced beers normally, but this one is really nice. Recommended."
"The carbonation was thin as was the mouthfeel. Still, this beer was quite drinkable. If it wasn't for it's lack of flavor other than that of ginger, i'd have given it higher marks."
"D: This is a hard beer for me to judge. The flavor is nice and certainly different. The light body and low ABV make it go down quick. Would I want another one? Not really. For me, this is a beer I'm glad I tried, but not something I'd seek out."
"D: Easy drinking beer, I like the flavor of ginger in a beer, and this doesn't let me down. I might have to try this again, would like to try on tap or very fresh."
" evening at the dinner table drink for sure."
"Mouthfeel is light."
"Good crisp beer, fairly refreshing too."
"Drinkability: This is an aquired taste beer. I will get it again, but cannot see myself drinking more than one in a sitting. I think it tastes like a mix between an amber ale and an iced tea. I good beer, but not one I could drink a six of."
"The flavor was a pleasant surprise in this one, as sometimes ginger beers can be a bit acerbic on the tongue. This one is done very well though. Recommended."
"At first, I thought this beer was too light. But the more I drank it, the more the beer gripped onto me. Use this against the lighter bad juju."
"Mouthfeel is light and crisp, and the breadyness at the end makes it better. Goes down well, and I can see this being a refreshing spring beer..therefore, it has good drinkability. Overall, I would recommend this. Not groundbreaking, but definitely worth trying. I could go for it again."
"overall mouthfeel and drinkability is good though."
"Notes-a beer I would drink again but I won't be rushing out to get more."
"M/D-Very light bodied which I didn't really care for. I think if this beer had a bigger malt profile I would have enjoyed it much more. Overall, not bad though."
"Taste is more of the same as this is a straightforward, no frills ginger beer. I find it to be quite well done though and is flavorful enough to keep it interesting but not overdoing it on the spices. A smattering of hoppy dryness creeps in near the end and increases the refreshing factor of this brew. This would make a fantastic summertime evening quencher, and at 4% is a sessioner. I'm having no problems finishing my bomber by myself, good beer!"
"Drinkability: A bit light on the ginger, but I'm down with that. I had this a few years ago and thought the ginger was pretty punchy (i.e, obnoxious). This time, it's pretty damned mild. However, if given the choice of too much ginger or not enough, I'll pick the latter every single time."
"M - Watery and disappointing."
"I was actually pretty surprised with this offering. I saw it on the shelf and decided to give it a go, thinking it probably wouldnt be that great, I mean come on Ginger? But it actually didnt have that strong, as in off putting, ginger taste I expected to get. The flavor was pretty nice, good smell to it, and is pretty darn drinkable for sure. Not something I would ever get on a regular basis, but for sure this was nice for a change of pace."
"beer meets like a reed's ginger beer. Very refreshing if you like ginger like I do, I could have a few but the beer is too sweet to be a session beer."
"Not nearly as frightening as I was expecting! Not bad at all..."
"I was intrigued by the use of ginger in a beer, and it's use was definitely intersting. The strength of the ginger was strong in the aroma and it made itself even more pronounced once it hit my tongue. The lightness of the beer allowed the ginger to stay strong well into the finish. I can see how this would be a nice crisp summer beer."
"Overall... a very drinkable ale with little to no palate fatigue and a nice ""hint"" of ginger."
"Drinkability -- Good session beer. I'm not into the bland flavor. The ginger is nice. Maybe it is better with food."
"M/D - not a bad beer at all, the taste is pretty good and drinkability is very good. The taste is up to the drinker. The ginger is a nice taste and something different and a bit of a hop bite helps it along. I'd try it again."
"This beer pours a clear orangey/amber hue with an average white foamy head..some lacing is noticeable throughout. Aroma is big time ginger with a backbone of pale malt and some fruity aromas in the back ground. Flavor has some malt sweetness and toasted notes from the pale ale. The ginger and the hops then create a semi-citrus fruit hit that is an interesting taste on the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and then spicy. It is very likened to a soda or ginger ale in that it is extremely high in carbonation. It was an interesting beer to try, simply not one for my palate."
"This beer might be low in Alcohol, but not in taste. It has a wonderful summer drinking feel about it. It might be a little expensive and as far as I can find only in 4 packs but it is very good, especially if you like the flavor of ginger. And on a special note this beer should be the required drink with sushi, like red wine is with steak and such."
"It's a nice feel; watery but a tad fizzy. It's a very earthy drink. Interesting but not the greatest thing ever. Nice enough though."
"pours up a golden color with a decent white head. decent lacing. the nose is lots of ginger, somewhat of a hop balance smell. the taste is very mellowed out ginger (probably due to the aging), sweet light malts, nice hop balance, medium body, low smoothe carbo. not too shabby for a Ginger beer"
"If bought out of sample pack the ginger seems not as strong."
"So while it's a decent ginger beer and something different, it's nothing amazing or terribly complex. Still, worth a try if you like ginger or spice beers."
"Pours a deep golden with a bit of an orange hue. Thin white head,with good retention and very nice laceing. Aroma is of ginger and other spices,and some nice floral hops. Body is light and carbonated. Taste is all there. Nice mix of sipces and sweet fruits. Very enjoyable."
"D: One or two would be my limit on this. While crisp and dry it is hardly an all day drinker flavor-wise. The drinkability of this increases as the serving gets colder and the outside temperature gets warmer. Decent but does not warrant a six pack purchase even for the curious."
"Pours a pale orange into a pint glass. There's a one-finger off white head that settles down with a slight lacing all around the glass. Smells of malts, ginger spice and a little hop aroma in the background. Not a whole lot going on there. Tastes of smooth, not overly bitter hops with a malt background. There's a bit of orange peel and subtle fruitiness which is almost hidden. Mouth-feel is light. Carbonation is fairly active. Figured there would be a little more taste to this one, but there's just not enough going on here to get your taste buds going."
"This was an interesting brew, but I find this category hard to score. Appearance is a bit bland, no head or lacing and orange-yellow color. Smell is good, a nice whiff of ginger comes through and maybe a bit of hops. Taste is similar to smell, but pretty weak- almost watered down. Mouthfeel is expectadly light as well, but there is some decent carbonation. Drinkability is good, but this is largely because it is so light."
"Recommended if you're looking for something different..."
"D: Low, a little too sweet and a little too much ginger make this beer a one-time sipper"
"D- i was locked on with the aroma, but was pretty disappointed with the rest. the wet dog thing kinda fries me too."
"M&D: pretty refreshing, effervescent, and light+ bodied, the taste is apparently much better than the cloying nose makes me believe. The dryish palate overall gives the whole beer a substantial lift. Not bad overall, but it could surely use a bit more hoppyness and bitterness to make it more enjoyable."
"d: an interesting beer. i might pair one with some gingery asian meals, but this isn't a particularly good beer. I am impressed that they were able to keep it fairly balanced."
"This poured a slightly hazy gold with a bit of white head. It smelled distinctly of ginger with lemon yeast and slightly earthy malt. It tasted like strong ginger with bitter floral hops and almost no malt. It was slightly thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a lasting ginger aftertaste. Overall this was a neat idea for a beer, but it lacked subtlety. The overpowering ginger flavor made it a bit tedious to finish."
"Notes:	Strange combo, came across this beer at a beer fest not too sure I am in to the herbal beers. Have had worse see any organic."
"The low ABV, good taste and light mouthfeel make this refreshing beer extremely drinkable on a hot day."
"I'm a big fan of sodas made with real ginger, so this was a real treat. It's light and enjoyable: a good summertime treat. Also a good one to bring to a party for people to sample something a little bit different. I don't know if it's something I'll buy more than once a month, but I will be buying again."
"D - AVERAGE MARKS HERE. NEEDS A NICE SUSHI MEAL TO GO ALONG WITH IT AND THAN IT WOULD BE EZ GOING DOWN."
"Left Hand Brewing Company Juju Ginger pours a light golden amber with a short initial froathy head. The smell is mild and pleasant of ginger. Ginger definitely comes out in the taste with a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium to high carbonation. Overall the drinkability is ok, it doesn't blast you with with much of anything, but it is unique and a nice pleasant change of taste. If this brew had a little more ginger flavor and a little less carbonation it would be a great change of taste."
"D: A very nice, summer drinking beer. Definitely a nice beer to relax and cool off with."
"Mouthfeel is light and clean. This is a very refreshing. I don't know why these are sold as a four pack, since this is very session-able."
"Drinkability - A pleasant if undemanding and bland beer, nothing memorable, worth checking out but not worth making it an habit."
"The mouthfeel and body are light and refreshing. A pleasant and pleasing beer all around."
"This comes down to a twist of ginger over a fairly bland ale. Sort of reminds me of a pedestrian blonde ale made in brewpubs for the less venturesome - with a touch of ginger in the nose and the finish."
"I got two fingers' worth of foamy, bubbly, off-white head from my pour. The color was a hazy medium amber. The nose was rich with a ginger snap and my mouth began to water as a result. The mouthfeel was medium and it had a decent, if not as strong as desired, ginger flavor on the tongue. The finish had a slightly unpleasant astringency, however. I have had better ginger beers, although I would be hard pressed to name one at this very moment. It was interesting to try, but I probably would not return to it."
"I enjoy Left Hand Brewery's beers but it was hard to stomach this one. It poured a honey orange color with a good head. Smelled of ginger and citrus. The taste is what got me. I sure many people like it but ginger is just not my thing, especially in beer. Had to pour this one out, sorry Left Hand."
"Overall, this is a somewhat disappointing beer. I've had non-alcoholic ginger sodas/sweet ginger beers that had a TON of spritz and ginger snap bite. This doesn't have any of that by comparison- I was hoping for more spice, acid, KICK, but it never delivered. Perhaps the fact it's almost a year old affected it(dunno when I bought this honestly, just decided to drink it as it was in the back of the fridge) If offered again, perhaps I take another taste of it, but I'm not seeking this one out, and can only drink this with food."
"D - This is drinkable. However, I don't think I could have too many of them at once."
"Taste is mainly ginger. The yeast appears a bit Belgian, fruity with some solvent components. This is a very tasty brew, which has some saison-like characteristics. These ginger and somewhat corky tastes are very pleasant and maybe just a little rough around the edges, meaning that the ginger gives a tiny bit of astringency. Great beer though!"
"D: This is an interesting beer to try; and I imagine it would pair well with Asian food. The ginger again is nicely balanced, but unfortunately the nature of ginger drastically reduces the drinkability. How many people want to slug down several pints of ginger juice?!"
"D: It's also a session beer since I'm not sick of the ginger at all."
"D: Again, better and more drinkable than I thought it would be. Very good for a novelty beer."
"Carbonation is strong and pleasant. The beer is too dry I feel, and could benefit from more tackiness. I'd see drinking this from time to time, as a novelty, but I think the product could use some improvement."
"Drinkability is pretty good. The full flavor doesn't make it well suited to chugging or anything, but I'm suprised how much I enjoy this in spite of the low ABV. Probably would be great sitting on the beach, probably influenced by the rasta label, which maybe they used b/c it would probably cut cottonmouth nicely?"
"A clean pale amber beer. Has a good bubbly head and a little bit of lace. The aroma has a good ginger snap to it. Slightly sweet but as much as a ginger ale (sody pop). It's hard to place where the ginger notes, the hop notes and the malt all start and end. There is a snap of ginger on the tip of the tongue, a bite of hops along the edges and a nice light malt down the middle. I think drinking this on draft at an outside cafe on a warm summer day would be ideal."
"This is a great summer beer. Ginger can be offensive when used in extremes (think of those little pink slivers they give you with sushi), but this beer doesn't over do it. A unique, refreshing break from your typical."
"Juju delivers a fairly light, ginger spiced, pale ale. Orange-gold in color with a decent sized white head. Sweet ginger in the nose with some spicy hops and light citric oranges. Much of the same in the taste, with a light body and light carbonation. Not bad in the least, but not really my thing either. One is probably enough for me."
"12 ounce bottle. The beer pours a hazy gold/orange color with about an inch and a half white head. Head retention and lacing are both OK. Aroma is mainly ginger, with some orange, apple and hops noticable too. Taste is also mostly ginger, but I can also taste some lemon, grains and hops. Mouthfeel/body is light, with average carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it's easy to drink but with the ginger I don't think I could drink more than 2-3 of these at a time. Overall I think this is a good, drinkable brew. I'd probably enjoy this more on a hot day, but it's still good on a cold day as well."
"D - Probably the best Ginger spiced ale I've had. Not something I'd drink often but I also wouldn't turn one down."
"All over the board on this one, I like the appearance. Nice head that actually retains well on top of a yellow unattractive beer. Aroma is not real present as it has a sweet ginger nose. Taste is lost, Ginger comes through, but I don't like the profile of spices with the ginger. Mouthfeel is creamy and chewy, pretty good considering the appearance of this beer, I probably won't be buying this one again as it came in a mixed pack and I used the second one for cooking (better for that)."
"Date on bottle is smeared but appears to be 8/10/07. Purchased 11/22/07, today is 01/16/08. It may be just a tad on the flat side...I dunno....maybe not."
"Served from a bottle in a pint glass. Clear, straw yellow color with a little bit of a white head. Aroma is overwhelmingly ginger. The taste is like no beer I've ever tried. Powerful ginger flavor; little bit like a cross between a cough drop and a Chinese stir fry. Little hint of hops in the aftertaste, but fairly thin once you get past the ginger. Probably a better summer beer than one for a cold January, but a nice change from the usual beer styles."
"Marvelous aroma, but it can't keep that promise. Not a bad beer, but I would not care for another now. Maybe next month, since I have two more of these."
"It's light-bodied and displays some decent complexity. It possesses ample carbonation and is bright and lively on the tongue. It's very drinkable and refreshing. It's very solid for the style."
"D- it is drinkable , but its flavors are all over the board. Try it if you like to try off the wall brews."
"I wasn't quite sure what to expect w/ this beer but I actually like it. Definatly the first time I've ever had a beer that tasted anything like this. Actually doesn't taste like much of a beer at all."
"An interesting change of pace. It's best paired with a food, as it was seemingly brewed for that purpose. It's worth a try if you get the chance."
"Overall - A decent enough brew if you like ginger.... worth a try.."
"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a deep dark golden yellow color with a sticky white head that leaves a pretty decent amount of lacing around the edge of the glass. You can definitely pick up some ginger in the nose along with some slightly buttery malt. The taste is malt up front with the ginger lingering in the finish with a dry and slightly spicy finish. Overall, this is a pretty straightforward brew that is not overly exiting. However, despite its simplicity I did enjoy drinking it. Not something I would like to drink ever night, but it is something different that gets extra points in my book. Recommended."
"This is a great summer beer and I think that it would go great with a salad, pacific rim dishes/sushi and, of course, Island Cuisine."
"Drinkability: Not knowing what to expect when I threw this in the mixed 6. I would say it is ok. I would not go out of my way for it again, though. An interesting beer, but not a repurchase."
"Drinkability: A fun idea, and more drinkable, perhaps, than SA's attempt at a ginger beer, but not something worth buying again."
"Drinkability: A touch to heavy on the carbonation but the ginger is quite refreshing. Very light beer that is enjoyable on a hot day"
"I couldn't even finish the beer. Highly recommend you avoid this one, which is disappointing given the normally excellent Left Hand selections."
"I have to admit that ginger is one of the few flavours that I've not fond of in food or beverages, subtle ginger flavours backed up by garlic or a strongly flavoured main ingredient are fine but if the dominant flavour is of ginger I'm generally put off. Thus this beer seriously doesn't do it for me, tthe myriad of various strong ginger flavours put me off therefore I didn't enjoy this. If you are a ginger fan especially a fan of non-alcoholic ginger ale then you'll probably go for this, but not me..."
"D - This beer is light and fairly easy to drink with a strong ginger character, but I can't say I really enjoy it. The problem for me here is the type of ginger character; the aroma it good but the flavor is too medicinal and lacks depth. There is none of the spicy, flavorfull ginger that I have occasionally experianced in some other beers. A bit more malt sweetness to balance out the ginger and hops would really help here."
"Obviously, there is ginger present here, but it isn't nearly as powerfu as I was thinking it would be, which was a pleasant discovery. Too many beers in this category are ""over-done"" with incredibly assertive smells of what the beer is ""supposed"" to smell like. This was mild. I like. Taste is very ""pale ale"" like with the ginger showing up briefly and gently on the finish. Quite drinkable. Nice."
"DA: ginger is really good for you mon, Rastafari!"
"I have to say this one of my favorite beers for the ABV. The first time I had a ginger beer, I was a bit skeptical but it had quite a bite and really surprised me (it was a homebrew, and a bit over gingered). That experience made me a fan of gingers and this is a solid, refreshing example of the style. I'm glad I can get a constant supply of this over the summer."
"An interesting summer offering; too heavy in citric hops and over-carbonated, but I enjoy the Asian spices for the novelty."
"Pleasant and good on a hot summer day."
"Very intresting beer here. Had a ginger beer in the past and it always came off very hot to me, this was a fine exception. Poured a golden yellow, with signigicant white top head that receded leaving a nice layer of sticky white lace. Smell was very difficult to place, lots of spice with a light earthy smell. Taste was very light and refreshing, again lots of spice to it, but nothing overwhelming. Very light feel, grat carbonation and smooth on the palate. Overall this was very drinkable, and I would actually like to get a six pack of this, not bad at all, and not what I was expecting, pleasant suprise."
"One of a few herbal/spiced beers I've had; not unlike Sam Adams' Cherry Wheat when it comes to really getting big flavor out of the chosen ingredient with a smooth and full body. Once in a while beer that has whet my appetite for more ginger ales."
"I expected this beer to be a bit of a gimmick, and sure, there is a bit of that. But it was a nice surprise, and a beer which I'd get again. Certainly worth checking out."
"D: A little tasty, goes down ok, not filling at all, it could use a bit more of a kick but the ginger flavor does give it an interesting twist, It’s a decent beer, but I wouldn’t drink more than a couple of these before I started looking for something else."
"Overall- Not bad at all. Unique, yet mild enough to be a session beer."
"pours a murky amber color with a two finger white head that holds well and nice lacing to the finish. aromas of ginger, fruit, and hint of spice. malty ginger taste with slightly sweet tropical fruit flavors mouthfeel light and refreshing, carbonation is good. nice beer very refreshing change of pace drink, i think it would pair well with seafood or clams."
"This beer poured a cloudy golden color with a nice, persistent head. The aroma is spicy and floral. The taste is a little bitter with the ginger noticeable. The mouthfeel is medium and it finishes dry. This is an interesting beer, but I would think one would be plenty in a sitting."
"This is a well balanced beer for a spiced beer. But this is what Left Hand brewery is good at!"
"This beer is very light in color, but not as light as a true ginger beer. It is somewhere between a straw and light amber color. There are visible bubbles coming off the bottom of the pint glass. The aroma is great and full of ginger. The ginger is more subdued in the taste. I was kind of thinking this would be a ginger beer with a powerful ginger blast, but the ginger is in more of a background role as it was most likely intended. For a lighter colored beer, it does have a pretty good body. I couldn't drink a lot of this because of the ginger flavor, but i would drink it often if I could get it."
"Recommended, but dont expect to be blown away."
"Drinkability: A great beer every now and again. A great beer to order at the local sushi bar."
"Overall, this one is pretty decent. If you don't like ginger it obviously won't be your thing but if you do like it, don't shy away thinking it will overpower the rest of the beer, because it won't. Simple, light and refreshing."
"Drinkability: so-so. The first few sips were refreshing, but it grew tiring as the glass was emptying. Interesting for a rare occasion when you are in the mood for a spiced beer."
"I was a bit apprehensive about trying this beer, but I was pleasantly suprised to find this a truly enjoyable beer. Would be perfect to session on a hot summer afternoon."
"Excellently carbonated and on the lighter side of medium bodied, this is refreshing and drinkable. Big points for originality. I would like to have a few of these with sushi or stir-fry, but the spicey ginger would be a bit much to session on it's own."
"The first few sips were interesting and nice, but after that I found it unappealing. I love ginger, I love beer, I love ginger ale...but this didn't totally do it for me. It's quite sessionable though, at >4% ABV..."
"This is an easy drinking beer but the unique flavor could get overwhelming after a few."
"Pours a peachy amber color with a nice foamy white head that leaves little lacing on the glass. Smells like you guessed it ginger, with mangos and other tropical fruits. Taste is of bitter ginger with a strong malt flavor, pretty full bodied flavor on my palate. This beer was really hard for me to finish once it warmed up, the ginger flavor really was very strong towards the end and kind of made me sick of it."
"D - This beer is unbalanced and overall unimpressive, but interesting nonetheless. Unfortunately, this combination of traits is not good for drinkability, and I would not pursure this beer again."
"Pours a copper color with a nice off-white head that retains well. The aroma has some caramel and toasted bread notes, along with ginger, fruity esters and some alcohol. The flavor has notes of caramel, biscuit, ginger, cane sugar, spicy hops and alcohol. The mouthfeel is really light and crisp and drinkability is very good. An interesting and drinkable beer, not really complex though."
"Pours a two finger, white head that quickly fades leaving no lace. Cloudy amber color. Very light carbonation and light bodied. Nose has some hops and maybe a hint of ginger. Starts with hints of ginger but more hops and malt than ginger, boring, clean finish. $2.75 for a 12oz bottle from Colonial Spirits Acton, Ma."
"Drinks very easy, would make a good dessert beer or just one to knock back on a warm day. If you don't like ginger you make see it differently"
"Drinkability: I'd like to try this with sushi as I think it'd be a good accompaniment with the taste and the lingering dryness. Otherwise I wouldn't seek this out, but I'm glad I tried this overall."
"M & D: Mouthfeel is smooth and dry with a big carbonation blast in the middle of the tongue to the back of the throat. Drinkable? Yes, especially if you have a stomach ache! Tasty, would go well with sushi or as an after dinner desert to cleanse your palate. Good change of pace offering from Left Hand."
"I couldn't see drinking more than this one single I snagged at the wine house. Aftertaste lingers."
"Interesting.... A lightly flavored ale with a light body and light malt sweetness and character. Very tea-like, herbal, earthy flavors that take on soft, spicy flavors. Of course loaded with ginger that is evident in the aromas and flavor. Hops combined with ginger begin to take on raw oak characteristics. Light, soft, clean finish with a light ginger, oily tingle on the toung. Pretty good, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it again."
" Ginger does seem to work well with beer, this is my second example I have tried and both have been pleasant."
"The beer pours a gold color with a 1/2"" white head that fades to lacing. The aroma is good. It has a nice pale malt scent along with a dry, yet fruity ginger aroma. The taste is decent. It has a light and weak pale malt flavor that goes down a little watery and finishes dry with some ginger flavor. The mouthfeel is average. It is a low bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a decent brew, but it needs more body. It comes across a little too thin for me."
"pours a drab, hazy copper with a taut ring as the only remnants of a once-glorious head. aroma of suppressed malts, faint honey and the ever-present ginger. similar to ginger beer but surprisingly mellower overall. flavored like a fresh pilsner with some breadiness in the finish and ginger essence defining the entire taste experience. goes down easy and is just carbonated enough. was particularly good company for my spicy chinese lunch. this beer is better than average.. still, a one-trick pony. if left hand comes up with any better beers to knock this off the roster, i say ""do it."""
"I gave the drinkabilty a 4 because it is very easy to chug these down. The same as drinking water."
"I can't imagine a better beer in this style for a warm summer afternoon. Highly recommended."
"This one pours a fairly average yellow color, but with a fat white head with some activity. The smell is a bit spicey, some ginger, but not a ton, and a decent hop and yeast presence too. The taste is very yeasty to start, with a fair amount of spice (non-ginger spices as well), and finishes with a twinge of fruity hops. The mouthfeel is pretty middle of the road, not too heavy, not too light. I sorta reminded me of a white beer without the orange flavors. I have to say I liked it, but I'm not big on spiced beers, so it may be some time before I give it another shot."
"I had this beer on draft at the Hickory Hop Festival this summer and the beer seemed to taste much better then. More pungent ginger and just more freshness. Guess draft is better in this beer."
"drinakability: If you're looking for something a little different to quaff and forget, this is a reasonable alternative to Budweiser. Look elsewhere if you like complexity in a brew."
"Pours a color somewhere between gold and copper, with a small, light, whispy head. Plenty of carbonation. Actually, the appearance is not unlike a good nonalcoholic ginger beer. Aroma is not the most pleasant in the world - adjunct lager with a touch of ginger. Palate is - again - like ginger beer. Slightly spicy ginger flavor up front, developing a bit of a malty character mid-palate. Nice dry finish with a touch of ginger again. Mouthfeel is nice and light, about perfect for the level of flavor. Body can become a bit foamy if you're active with it, but it's not too bad. On a 95 degree day in North Carolina, this rather hits the spot,"
"Pours an almost clear, copper color that is topped by a pale tan, rocky head. The aroma is of course dominated by fresh cut, spicy ginger; it is really quite fresh and zesty. The taste is light, and quite dry on the palate. The dryness of the beer tends to mute the ginger a bit, at least compared to the levels in the nose. The ginger is still the most evident character though. Lots of spicy, herbal ginger notes almost make it up through my sinuses as I sip on this beer. I really like this beer, it is one dimensional of course, but it is refreshing and quite gingery, and I like ginger."
"I'm a fan. Nicely done, Left Hand...I'm feeling higher than a lion in Zion..."
"Crisp and refreshing in the mouth with moderate carbonation and a medium body. A spicy kick for a hot summer afternoon, this makes for a great mid-day brew. Flavor is well rounded and not weighted down with ginger, very simple but works well."
"Drinkability: Not bad and has lots of nice flavors; I would just like to see this re-formulated to taste more like a pale ale or an IPA"
"This beautiful deep gold ale clearly delivers a ginger punch without going overboard; and backs it with a lightly sweet maltiness and firm bitterness. It's fairly one-sided, as you might guess, but it is refreshing and enjoyable. On a hot summer day after biking or during a fishing excursion, one of these just might be what the doctor ordered!"
"One dimensional trick pony that left me wanting more."
"12 oz., bottled on 12/14/04. Looks like a pale ale or IPA with a slight cloudiness and a 1 finger head that doesn't leave much lacing. Aroma is ginger up front with a little bit of hops behind that. The beer is thin and metallic with a ginger kick. Kinda like carbonated water with some ginger flavor, and it has a hop bitterness I only found in the last sip. Mouthfeel is OK. The ginger isn't unpleasant, I just wish there were more beer flavors behind it. Nothing great on its own, but I imagine it would be decent with food."
" Drinkability would be great if you love ginger. But I was always a Mary Ann type of guy."
"I think this would be an interesting brew to serve with heavily spiced Indian or Nepalese or, even, Asian food. I just wounldn't make it a regular in my fridge."
"I gotta call it like I see it: Weak thematic brew with ""irie"" on the label. Ooh, and the irie lion, and the colors of the Jamaican flag. A stoner's homebrew. At first I was going to call it Coors with color, and fresh ginger, but... that's a bit gratuitous. How 'bout Fat Tire scrubbed over a washboard with fresh ginger and Coors Light. That's better. And this isn't cheap beer! It was 6$ for a friggin' 4-pack."
"sprtzy looking beer with a thin white head, overwhelming ginger smell from the time you pop the top. very sweet smlling. golden color with little bubbles rising to the top. the color seems to seperate, perhaps it is the glass, but the top is darkermore bronzed, while the bottom is more yellow. the more i sniff i can also pick up the hops but again the ginger is over powering. the taste is weird! catching me off guard. sweet odd taste of ginger, with very bubbly carbonation and light hopping. i was expecting more toawrds ginger ale, but this has way more ginger flavor then artificially flavored soda. i dont know how to grade the taste, because i don't have any comaprison. i don't particularly care for the flavor but if you like ginger, you almsot certainly will. it just isnt up my alley. light body and high soda like carbonation make for a fiesta in the mouth, but that ginger taste jsut gets to me. worth a try, just to try soemthing different, but not amazing."
"Definitely a different brew. Pours a light copper with very little head. Smell is light and pleasant with mainly a ginger aroma. Taste is lightly sweet on the front...light ginger falvor...slightly bitter on the finish. Low abv and smoothness make this a very drinkable brew. Mouthfeel is light and pleasant. A good brew to have for an occasional change of pace."
"Thanks to kmpitz2 for sharing this one with me. Pours an amber color with a small head that doesn't leave any lacing on the glass. The aroma has a lot of ginger in it, but it is backed by a nice malt with a caramel smell. The flavor is all ginger. Too much, in fact. I can't detect any other flavors because the ginger is too strong. Thin as well."
"This beer pours a pale golden color with a cover of head over top. The nose is all ginger. Not much more than that in there. The flavor is also lacking as well, giving just the ginger in there and not much beer to be had. The feel is thin as well. As it warms, there is a bit more of a hop base to it, wtih some citrus flavors coming through, but the nose is all ginger still. Drinkability suffers from the lack of complexity in the nose. I want more than just the ginger in there."
"Drinkablility is ok, would be a good beer for a ginger loving macro drinker . I am a big Ginger fan and was really hoping and expecting more from left hand."
"I suppose this would make a good summer quaffer, or ""lawnmower beer""."
"With a few fixes, Juju Ginger could be good. More malt, lose the Saaz, jack up the ginger and cut the carbonation by half. Now that's a beer that I'd buy in a heartbeat. Although I believe that it has too many faults as is, it may be exactly what the boys at Left Hand were shooting for. I'll happily finish the bomber however and will dream of what could have been."
"This came in a 22oz bomber. This poured out a clear light amber color with a tall rocky white foam head. Not much retention as the head goes quickly leaving some sticky lace around the glass as it is consumed. Aroma is fairly weak but pleasant with a bit of ginger standing out over sweet malt. Flavor is more of the same with a sweet malt taste being slightly tweaked by the ginger and a slight earthy hops presence. Very light overall taste with a slight lingering ginger after taste. This has about a light to medium body with a clean crisp feel to it. Drinkability is all right, I do like ginger and without that this beer has little else to offer. An interesting brew that would probably pair up well with sushi though it is fairly weak in the smell and taste department. This could be an introduction to craft beer kind of beer since there is little offensive in this. Not bad but something I would only drink again with a meal that fits its flavor."
"Pours a hazy deep orange and sports litttle to no head and only a trace of lace. Aromas are first of malt, then subtle ginger, then a splash of hop. The mouthfeel is clean and crisp, though I'd hoped for more of a ginger bite. Flavors are somewhat muted as far as the ginger element. This comes off more like a light pale ale with some spice. The beer finishes sweetishly malty. A decent refresher nonetheless."
"Thanks for the try Bum. Is this the ""Joke Beer"" of your most recent shipment??"
"Probably shouldn't review this one, as I didn't think I'd like it from the get go. I love ginger, but obviously not in my beer. It had a cloudy, yellow color, with a white speckeled head. The smell of ginger and hops? seemed to creep out. It was drinkable, but not for my taste. Somewhat bitter, and spicey. Also seemed thin to me. Some have compared it to ginger ale, which also wasn't a favorite of mine, but I'd rather drink that."
"Yes this is very drinkable, but it isn't great either in the uniqueness or the overall experience departments. Not offensive, but not great either."
"The beer after departing the 22 ounce brown bottle takes up residence in my glass a limpid amber color with a portly light tan head that is also frothy in texture, the lace forms a nice thick sheet to conceal the glass. Nose is sweet malt; a hint of ginger, fresh and clean, start is sweet, the malt acceptable, and the top fair to middling in its feel to the palate. Finish has a mild acidity, the hops personable and they become a bit spicier as the beer warms to the room, a drinkable beer, but not a big hit with me."
"Drinakability is average IMHO. Very nice effort but one was enough for me. I'd rather have a ginger ale."
"Overall: This is not that bad an offering for a Ginger Ale, but I cannot see anyone who never liked Ginger Ale before taking to this. For me, I think it is a decent attempt at something that rarely seems to be attempted these days. A nice first beer after work, on what has been a hot day. Worth trying."
"Medium copper color. Faint white head, clumpy and quickly faded. For a ginger beer, really lacked any ginger smells. Nothing noticable anyway. And really nothing like the ginger ale softdrink to be sure. Taste was moderate at best. Some mild hops, faint biscuit malts underneath. Some toasty breads. No real ginger presence. For a ginger beer, it really lacked ginger flavor. Not that I am expert on these beers, but really just tasted like an amber ale. Medium to light bodied. Easy enough to drink. Just not alot of flavors here."
"Pours a dark shade of orange with a quick dissapearing head,aroma of course is dominated by fresh ginger kinda sweet and and spicey pretty provacative.Taste is of ginger for sure with a toasted malt flavor that lingers in the finish,tastes better as it warms a little.A pretty unique beer not one I would get to often but not all that bad."
"Pours a translucent apricot-gold color. Despite the long-lasting effervescence feeding it, the head is minimal and quite fine. The worst part of the smell is that it is so muted. Sweet but subtle malts are there, as is the spice of ginger one would expect. This beer is crafted on a base of nondescript grains but, predictably, it is livened up with the infusion of ginger. To Left Hand's credit, the ginger is well integrated, manifesting itself first in straight ginger flavor as the initial malts fade and then as a spicy warmth in the back of the mouth. Mouthfeel is good, and while this is a drinkable beer, I'm unlikely to be inspired to reach for it again."
"I wasn't really sure what to expect from this beer. I like ginger, and all, but I'd never been a fan of the non-alcoholic ginger ale, and wasn't sure the alcohol would help. It poured attractively enough, a nice copper/orange color with a moderate-to-thin off white head. A good start, but the aroma was disappointing -- the ginger's there, to be sure, but apart from that, only a very light malt sweetness manages to make itself noticed. The taste, unforunately, is more of the same. Ginger right from the get-go, with the only relief to be found in a very mild slightly citric hop finish. It's not necessarily that there's too much ginger to the flavor, it's just that there's not enough else there to balance or lend any complexity to the brew. Medium-bodied with a dry finish. This beer actually might be decent if paired with the right meal -- asian stir fries or ginger-spiced chicken are the obvious candidates. I just don't think there's enough here to stand on its own, though."
"Came out a cloudy coppery color. Interesting aroma of ginger, with a hint of aprictos in the background. Taste has a subtle amout of ginger nicely balanced with a sweet maltiness. Aftertaste of apricots comes through very cleanly. Magic Hat should make a #9+ with a little ginger thrown in. An excellent summer refresher!"
"Pleasant ginger-sweet aroma and a nice color. I enjoyed the light sweet flavor. This was a pleasantly surprising Spice Beer. I have been somewhat impressed with all of Left Hand's offerings as a matter of fact."
"Notes: This beer is brewed using a pale ale as the base with the addition of fresh organic ginger root, which has been used in brewing for ages but is quite uncommon these days. As a such, Juju is a rare treat and very unique. A most refreshing beer. I can also see this being a great ""chick"" beer -- no offense to all the women out there, but you know what I mean -- or a great introduction beer for those who don't really like beer."
