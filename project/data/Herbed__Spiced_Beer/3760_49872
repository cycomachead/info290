Apparently, they used a blend of orange pekoe and earl grey to make this beer. I could taste the earl grey. Reminded me of when I drank earl grey tea as a kid because of Jean Luc Picard in Star Trek. Strong lemon aroma, with some grainy malts and tea leaves. Tastes a little stronger than it smells. Like someone mixed in lemon iced tea with a rather boring hefeweizen. I could see myself drinking this on a hot summers day after mowing the lawn. Then again, I could also have an iced tea after mowing the lawn as well. Would I drink it again? If it were offered.

Nose has some lemony and grassy hops, loads of lemon tea (surprise, surprise!), a general sweetness to it and darker (almost Earl Grey-like) herbal notes. Taste is super fizzy initially, again some thin and watery lemon tea, sweet malt and very mild hops. Some tea 'leafiness' in the finish. Mouth was thin and watery, super high carbonation.

It's sweet but not overly so. It's a bit tangy from the lemon and wheat malt. It has mild tannic finish that any tea drinker will recognize. It's light, refreshing, easy drinking, and tastes very natural. It may not taste like beer, but it delivers on what it promises to taste like. It seems well made in that respect - this is no highly processed and artificial tasting alcopop.

While the retention was not very good, it did regenerate admirably with a swirl to the bitter lemon end. Smell was citrusy, tea aroma is unmistakeable with a lemon-lime backdrop. Taste is appropriately tart lemon with a doughy consistency, tea-like astringency is not offensive. This beer has huge novelty appeal, curious and interesting, well done for what it is and above average refreshment value. The mouthfeel has a cleansing quality to it but a slight artificial feel as well, a saccharine element of sorts that keeps it from being an exemplary beer. Still it is far superior to those coolers out there that pretend to be what they're not. Overall, this beer experiment works just fine and I'd recommend you try it, you might well want to have this on hand for a patio or pool party this summer, it would be a big hit in mixed company; bravo to Mill St. for making the effort.","ThatWineGuy","Jun 24, 2010"

3.92,17.7,3,3.5,4,4,4.5,"D - I must say that I was quite pleased with this one. My expectations were not all that high, but they well exceeded those. Although rather bland on the appearance and scent, the flavour came through for the win!","andrenaline","Jun 05, 2010"
3.8,14.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4,"D: flies down the hatch in no time. A first class example of the style, and probably my highest-rated fruit beer. Nice work, Mill Street!","cratez","Jun 01, 2010"
3.97,19.2,3.5,4,4,4,4," Really a nice refreshing summer beer...enjoyed it more than I thought I would.","pootz","Jun 01, 2010"
3.9,17.1,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,4.5,"It's incredibly drinkable. That said, it's not something I'll repeat, as a good lemony hefe or crisp pilsner is more my summertime thing. But according to the back of the bottle this will come in cans this summer and I might have to keep a small stash in my fridge for visitors who say they don't like beer. This might change their mind.","MeisterBurger","Jun 01, 2010"
4.14,24.3,3.5,4.5,4,3.5,4.5,"If Mill Street was aiming for the perfect summer beer, they hit it almost spot on. I was lucky enough to find this in the loose bin, allowing me to not commit to the mixed 6, but with their Pilsner thrown in, I'd say it's definitely worth picking up. In terms of their bottled beer, I'd say this one sits on par with the best Mill Street has to offer.","ludachris","May 23, 2010"
3.89,16.8,3.5,4.5,3.5,4,4,"Tastes something like a 30/70 mix of iced tea to beer. I honestly think that if I had never tried Tornado, I would have a different opinion of this beer. For what was intended, it's a good effort; just not one that I'm entirely appreciating. I could see lots of this stuff being consumed this summer but don't think I'll be helping out with that. If I want a refreshing wheat beer in Toronto, I'll grab a Denison's.","eat","Nov 12, 2009"
4,20.1,4,4,4,4,4,"I have to admit that before trying it I thought the only thing a lemon tea beer would prove is that some things are better left alone - boy was I wrong! This is an exceptionally refreshing ale that is perfectly suited to warm-weather drinking. Provided the sound of this beer sounds remotely appealing to you, then I guarantee it will be.","biegaman","Aug 17, 2009"
4,20.1,4,4,4,4,4,"Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. I was skeptical at first about this but after having it a couple times, it is pretty damn good.","Viggo","Aug 14, 2009"
4.4,32.1,4,4,4.5,4,5,"Edit: Just got back from Volo. The humidex is at 40 and I've got to say this is the perfect summer seasonal. Drinkability through the roof in the weather its intended for. I've upped the drinkability to 5.","bobsy","May 24, 2009"
3.72,11.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,4,"A very good approximation of when lemon-flavoured black tea and a plain-ass 'stock' ale collide. I'm duly glad that the Earl Grey's bergamot oil, which I'm altogether less than partial towards, is well obfuscated by the lemon, and equally buoyed by the workaday (my days, usually) Orange Pekoe in the mix. A decent summer quaff, overall.","biboergosum","May 23, 2009"
3.62,8.7,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"D: I could see people drinking this on a patio.","Derek","May 18, 2009"
3.33,0,3.5,3,3.5,3,3.5,"On tap at C'est What Spring Festival of Craft Brewers. Average beer. Yellow with lots of lace. Middle-mouthfeel, drinkable. Yeah some lemon black tea taste. If I want that, I will get my unsweetened snapple. Probably some will like it, a novelty really, a fruit beer. Might be better with honey, I do put honey in my tea.","Sammy","Beers"
4.06,21.9,5,4,4,4,4,"This is an excellent, straightforward summer sipper. Its light in taste but interesting with the understated tea flavors. Very easy to quaff. Another winner from Toronto's best brewpub.","CAMRAhardliner","0"
