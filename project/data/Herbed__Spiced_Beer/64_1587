Starts with Muscat grapes that lingers into honey followed by a malty finish. This beer is refreshingly different almost like a blend of mead, moscato wine, and beer. Very unique and easy to drink.You won't even know that it's 9% ABV. I'd drink it more often if it wasn't $12 for 4 bottles.","AtomicHippo","Mar 23, 2015"

Malt is sweet and the grape skin flavor is bright, light and really easy to like in this beer.  Juicy middle, herbal back notes.  Dry, bubbly.  The honey on this one is like a raw floral scent and taste is  light.  Orange and a fruit rind scent that I can't place.  Spice , Bread crusts and a mild ester from alcohol.  A bit of alcohol sweetness on the palate too but not even any warming.  Delightful!  The malt was so deep on this pale beer.  The flavors crisp and the breaddiness surprising.","utopiajane","Mar 15, 2015"

The nose is complex with honey, bananas, muscat grapes.  The hop character is very subdued if present at all.  The flavor is very sweet but in a good way, like in a Belgian-style.  Again, there is good flavor of honey.  It is full bodied with a nice alcohol heat that is equal to the carbonation and cream.  I had one of these in my wine cellar for about 11 months after purchase and it was just as good as the first one I ever opened.","thehooksman","Jan 17, 2015"

The flavor is similar, very grainy and malty. The white wine grape is the only real redeeming quality of the beer, kind of like a imperial adjunct lager...with some white wine and honey hints.  Not bad but not great either, but good enough. While I find the concept of ancient ales to be an interesting science experiment, my overall feeling is that if these beer recipes didn't survive time, there might be a reason. Definitely one for the tickers and potential crossover beer for the macro fans.","cosmicevan","Jan 03, 2015"

However, I am glad I purchased this beer, because it really feels like a timemachine in glass. It is hard to rate this beer, because considering the template they used to make it is archaic I don't really have a viable frame of reference. I saw other reviews lamenting about how it didn't meet their expectations, and how they would rather drink an IPA, but such a comment sounds ill-founded to me.  In all honesty, this beer is simply a tribute to the history of beer, and if you can't appreciate it as that, and would rather judge it with a contemporary and biased perspective, then this beer obviously isn't for you. If you want to taste the diversity Dogfishhead has to offer, and their love for the craft and its history, then this beer is definitely for you.","Brew-Enthusiast1349","Sep 14, 2014"

Well, it doesn't really taste like wine. Very fruity, along with the sweetness of honey. Tastes more like a beer than wine. The mouth feel though, is again like wine. Most interesting "beer" I've had in a long time. Although I don’t think this is actually classified as a beer. Definitely never had anything like it before.","kkleu357","Sep 04, 2014"
3.5,-6.2,,,,,,"Poured from bottle to glass with very little and fine head. A rich, golden color, with very good clarity. This does not look or taste like a 2700 year old recipe at all. It's a bold, beautiful beer with hint of malt and white grape aroma and sweet honey taste. Dogfish head use a wonderful yeast that I have come to associate with a series of wonderful beers over the years and the Midas is no exception. Thanks to my friend who found this beer at a beer store and picked it up for me.","cafemondegar","Sep 03, 2014"

Pours out a hazy yellow with a minimal head and very little retention. The smell actually reminded me of adjuncts, not malt or hops. The taste was even on the "hot" side, particularly after the beer warmed a bit and the mouth feel average at best with poor carbonation. Overall it was OK, but just marginally. I am sorry I bought a 4 pack and will be going back to 90 Minute IPA if I want something from DFH. This is not a beer that is worth 3+ bucks a bottle at retail.","Retroman40","Jul 30, 2014"

This beer is, as much as it is asking you to evaluate it based on your contemporary tastes, try and imagine living in a world where while you knead your bread and prevent the swirling dust from getting into your eyes and the dough in your hands. It asks us to reevaluate our position and our expectations of a "beer" and of what we can enjoy and by what criteria.

While beer aficionados frequently laud those brews with a long mouth feel I tend to believe the abundance of carbonation precludes a mouthfeel on par with what a complex wine can offer. In contrast, this honey heavy concoction has a buttery quality that coats the mouth and makes it a great selection to pair with food.","StuyBeerGuy","Mar 20, 2014"

I liked the aroma and the taste, although I had trouble identifying exactly what it was I was smelling and tasting. The only thing I could reliably identify was honey. I even went and smelled different spices from my spice cabinet to try to narrow it down. The bottle said saffron and white muscat grapes, neither of which I am familiar enough with to make any sort of comment on. At any rate it was enjoyable enough and I was happy to expand my palate with it.","ChristopherProvost","Mar 12, 2014"

Grape forward, very floral and fruit similar to some of the whites from california. The nose gives way to barley and honey blended together in a complex aromatic together. The saffron isn't as visible on the nose for me. Immediately when tasting the honey and barley come together. On my palate, this is honey nut cheerios and it is awesome. The saffron is blended in well, and hardly noticeable as a direct spice. The grapes themselves make the backbone of the taste and lead it into a long finish. The mouthfeel is light with small bubbles and decent carbonation. Overall a very good beer.","CochonKing","Jan 02, 2014"

3.46,-7.2,3.25,4,3,4,3.5,"Bought a 4-pack at Table and Vine. Beer poured nicely and has a very clear, yellow appearance. Definitely lives up to the "gold" theme. Very thin head at first until nothing much was left and thin lacing. Fruity aromas of grapes and honey, along with a spice I cannot put my finger on. Definitely an attractive smell. Taste was decent; the beer was sweet with grapes and a citrus flavoring with a touch of that honey that you can smell. Nothing that made me go "wow", but it is enjoyable nonetheless. Very refreshing beer; light and crisp, but the drink warrants slow drinking thanks to its almost wine-like flavoring. Overall, an interesting drink indeed.","fitzy84","Nov 09, 2013"

I mean hell, I have helped friends move and do other things for a case of beer. Haven't you? Although I don't think I would worked all day in the desert heat building a pyramid for a ration of beer.

As it poured, it smelled like a white wine/champagne. In the glass however it smells different; yeasty, but with a hint of grape and sweetness. Taste-wise, it has a similar profile to the others in the ancient ale series, especially the Sah'tea. Smooth and yeasty, sweetness predominates. Spice notes come in towards the end, along with a little warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium but slick, a bit fizzy. I was expecting something more wine-like, such as the Noble Rot, but this was still an interesting beer. Not sure if I'd pick it up again, but always worth a try.","BurgeoningBrewhead","Apr 27, 2013"

3.72,-0.3,4,3.75,3.75,3.75,3.5,"The beer pours a fiery orange-yellow that sits in the glass close to copper in color with a huge army of bubbles racing through the beer constantly to replenish the head. The head sits nicely atop the beer as a creamy off-white color, with the bubbles holding to a size just below medium. The beer’s body is murky and full of chunky particles floating in the glass. It looks like swamp water with algae in it. On the nose, the beer smells raisiny sweet, with some definite candied grape/raisin notes and strong currents of sweet candied wine. I presume the saffron is one of the fruity candied smells I am detecting but I can’t be sure as I have never taken the time to pick out the smell of saffron before… Honey is also very prevalent in the nose, giving it a gooey sweet feel in the nostrils. On the tongue, the beer tastes very sweet with some light acidity and a touch of bitter on the sides of the tongue. The flavor begins as sweet caramelly barley, slowly working its way towards a sweet muscato wine with lovely nuances of mead and very slight bread from the barley. The finish is a medium in length, tingling with sweet wine flavors and a touch of sweet honey. As I drink more of the beer, and it warms in my hands, I also begin to detect a strong earthy sweet bitter spice on the middle of the palate that has some lasting power. The aftertaste rings with the cloying aftereffects of the wine and honey flavors. On the mouth, the beer feels medium thick in body, but the carbonation is quite strong and prickly, actually working to scrub some of the cloying nature of the beer off the tongue before it becomes unpleasant. The mouth is left neutral with a slight sticky sweet astringency to the tongue. Overall, this is an interesting beer. I totally dig everything that the ancient ales project represents and I think it is awesome to try ancient styles of beer/wine/mead-hybrids, but overall this drink is a little too sweet for me. I’m also noticing a little bit of heat from the alcohol in the back of my throat, especially after the beer has passed through. This is an interesting beer that is worthy of a try, but certainly not one you could chug, and not really a return worthy beer for me.","Maxwell","Mar 13, 2013"

This ale poured a hazy golden orange color, produced a very thin white head, poor retention and left no lacing on the glass. The aroma consisted of grapes and honey- Im detecting something floral which i can only imagine would be the saffron. Can't say I have ever smelled saffron to know for sure. Medium to full bodied, this ale boasts a 9% ABV, A nice base of a buttery biscuit is a segway to the flavor of honey, grapes and spicy saffron. This brew has many wine like characteristics and is also somewhat tart and warming at the finish. Overall, this is a awesome concept beer- Creative and fun- Great for a session or dinner with family and friends. Prost!","GossageBrewery","Jan 16, 2013"

The aroma is rather light, mild grasses and herbs come through, small amounts of lemon. The flavors are pretty complex, I can taste some apple, apricot and peaches, mild orange and some spices in the after taste. Honey, grapes, and a very slight sweet-tart flavor are also in the mix. The alcohol is well hidden and only detectable as you swallow for a brief second. This is a semi dry beer and has a light-to-medium mouth feel but is very interesting and goes down pretty smooth.","vickersspitfire","Dec 28, 2012"

The grape taste shines, as does the honey. To me the malts are taking a supporting role here - the other flavors shine through much more on top of the malty backbone. It certainly is different with mead, beer, and wine characteristics all rolled into one. Great change of pace and unexpected. Keeper.","LeRose","Nov 27, 2012"

Head diminishes quickly and legs receed quickly. Taste is...unique. There's a mild sweetness that makes itself known in the middle of the sip, almost a grape like quality to it. Moves into a honey finish that subsides fast. I find that a lot of the 'unique' brews aren't good for drinking on a semi-regular basis but this I could drink a few times a year.","darktower","Oct 28, 2012"

I've used the word sweet twice but it doesn't smell overpoweringly sweet, it actually smells kind of dry but there is a sticky sweetness throughout the whole smell, probably from the honey. It actually smells very similar to another Ancient Ale, Chateau Jiahu. The taste is slightly sweet with grapes, apples and pears blending nicely with a touch of booziness and fading into a sweet but dry finish. The body is very light but it has some heft to it and the alcohol heat doesn't kick in until the sip has settled in your stomach. This is one of their best Ancient Ales. I put two of my 4-pack away to age a bit and see where it goes.","DonDirkA","Sep 21, 2012"

Pours lightly cloudy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Good soapy lacing clings to the glass, with a good amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of honey, grape, earth, apricot, herbal, clove, raisin, pepper, bread, floral, and light yeast spices. Nice and well balanced aromas with decent strength; quite pleasant. Taste of grape, biscuit, honey, pepper, clove, saffron, herbal, earth, raisin, floral, and light yeast spiciness. Lingering notes of biscuit, honey, grape, herbal, earth, and light yeast spices on the finish for a bit. Nice balance of flavors; no cloying sweetness at all. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a slightly creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Very smooth to sip on. Overall this is a very nice ancient ale style. Very nice flavor balance and complexity; with nice smoothness. Very enjoyable stuff.","superspak","Aug 25, 2012"

4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the grape and spice in the taste. At first it was a bit synthetic, but it really flourished, adding to the flavor rather than detracting from it. The grain was a bit too basic at times, but the flavoring throughout matched exactly to what we’ve come to expect from the Dogfish Ancient Ales series.","TheBrewo","Aug 07, 2012"

I guess that's the impressive thing - that these unusual flavors can be so prominent, but not feel overwhelming or out-of-place. Tasty stuff.","zeledonia","Aug 02, 2012"
4.12,10.5,3.5,4,4.5,3.5,4,"Review from 8/2010 notes. Poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. Pours a clear orange amber with a small head with light lacing. Spicy honey, fruit aroma, similar to a tripel. Nice fruit and honey, light malt. Pleasant sweet vinous flavor in the middle; sweet honey finish. I like this quite a bit and evidently better than most reviewers. Definitely pick up periodically.","LiquidAmber","Aug 02, 2012"

There are bready scents with the honey. I can pick up those mild white grape aromas as well. The taste is more similar to a mead than a beer. I also pick up the white grap flavors as well as some spiciness. I don't really notice the alcohol so much in the taste. The body is medium with adequate carbonation. The beer is smooth and has high drinkability. This is a very good beer that is also very interesting.","acevenom","Jul 20, 2012"

The smell of this reminds me of breakfast. Fresh baked raisin bread with honey. The taste starts with a tingle of wheat then gently the honey flavor comes in. The carbonation fizzles away in your mouth and as the honey flavor comes out the texture becomes quite creamy. Aftertaste is sweet. This Is an enjoyable beer that's good to chill out with or with a light snack. No huge show or presentation here but a good solid taste that I may seek out again.

3.59,-3.8,3,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Dogfish Head Midas Touch pours a dark, hazy orange, with just faint lightening at edges of the glass. There's maybe two fingers of off white foam, and neither head retention nor lacing are particularly impressive. The nose is nice, giving all the special ingredients a chance to shine. Juicy muscat grapes are the centerpiece, sweetened up a bit by the unmistakable aroma of honey. Saffron is present as well, albeit not quite as immediately noticeable as the other two. Grapes jump out again on the flavor palate. It's not nearly as acidic as some beers I've had that were brewed with them. Honey flavor comes through, as well as a bit of apples, to give the illusion of sweetness. The saffron that comes in on the back end is a bit too loud and brassy though, and ruins the delicate balance found at first. The body is nicely dried, not as much as a well made Belgian beer (Belgian Strong Pale seems to be a good close comparison for this beer), but enough to serve the beer well. The carbonation falls a little bit flat though. Midas Touch is the rare "just OK" beer for me from Dogfish Head, I usually tend to either love or hate their brews.","axeman9182","May 14, 2012"

However, I'll rate it according to others I've had in its category. The back-end of this beer's taste is it's highlight, as you get a lot of different flavors. I just never felt like this beer knew where it was going. Also, I would drink this really cold as I enjoyed it less as it heated up (unlike usual).","genuinedisciple","May 04, 2012"

Aroma is surprisingly malt forward, given the impressive list of other ingredients. My palate's not developed enough to find the saffron, but the honey and grapes are definitely present in both aroma and taste. The flavour backbone is of sweet malts and champagne with a surprisingly dry finish, nicely bitter.","hopsolutely","Apr 29, 2012"

There was a nice balance between sweetness and fruitiness in this beer although it could have maybe used a little bit more. The muscat grapes definitely gave this beer a little bit of a white wine quality. If you appreciate white wines, then you will probably appreciate this beer.","jaasen64","Feb 11, 2012"

Tastes light, more on the sweet side of things. Honestly, although this doesn’t sound flattering, it reminds me of sweet white grape juice. I don’t mean that in a negative way, it just has the similar flavor profile in my mind. Effervescent, nuanced, and enjoyable.","elNopalero","Feb 10, 2012"

4.82,29.2,4,4.5,5,5,5,"The taste is very unique and distinct. It has a lot of qualities not typically found in beer, but still retains a strong beer-like presence. It's a bit sour in the way that sour apples or sour grapes are sour. Not the green apple taste of a poorly brewed beer. This actually compliments the beer quite nicely. It has a honey flavour as well and despite my usual aversion to honey, this flavour compliments the beer quite nicely. There are some hops and other spices that balance out the beer very well. I can't place what the spices are. The bottle says saffron. I'm not an herb expert, so I don't know what saffron tastes like. Maybe that's what's making this beer so awesome. The hops are light, but present enough to give the beer just the light astringency it needs. Overall, the beer is sweet and light in flavour and the alcohol character is quite discernible, which I like, but no so harsh that most beer drinkers might have a problem with it. I personally like an alcohol presence in my beer, so I welcome lots of strongly alcohol-flavoured beers. I'd consider this one to have a medium alcohol character. It's not overbearing. Basically, this beer is fucking sweet. If you have the funds and the availability, try it.","ElCommodoro","Dec 05, 2011"

4.5,20.6,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"This beer pours a hazy golden color with a very slight head. I like the unfiltered look and bright gold complexion. The nose was stronger than I'd been expecting after reading some other reviews, and different in its fruity malt odor than most other beers. I'm used to strong fruity flavors deriving from the hops, but a first taste reveals a smooth, fruit malt backbone. Instead of a flavor balance provided by hops, the malt counterpoint instead seems to be the champagne-like aspect built into this beer. Thus, the grape and honey promised on the bottle appear, but not in a sweet fashion, as in a dry champagne, much to my delight. The honey almost manifests in the smoothness of the mouthfeel, which is light and crisp but full, like a golden ale/champagne cross. Overall, excellent, and I cannot recall a beer of this style that I would recommend any higher. Well done Dogfish Head.","fezmeister","Nov 29, 2011"

Not alot of hops for dfh but rather tasty nonetheless. The saffron is real interesting to find in a beer, quite unique. If you are a fan of dfh, this is one to try.

Strong grape taste which fades to alcohol to light herby flavor. Bitter aftertaste is the only hint of hops in this 'nectar'. I'm not sure if this is a beer or a mead, it's so sweet.

4.01,7.5,5,4,4,4.5,3.5,"I went with an aggressive pour since no directions were given on the bottle, plus I did not see any lees in evidence. I had a rocky finger of off-white head briefly until it went back into the ages from whence it came. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity that would have made King Midas proud to have it named after him, plus he would be able to see well into the future with this one. I definitely caught the grape vinousness on the nose, but also the honey sweetness as well as a dry mustiness, no doubt the result of the yeast. Mouthfeel was very viscous, not honey-thick, but full for beer and with an effervescence that seemed to wash my mouth clean. On the second mouthful, following Midas' Cleansing, I was getting a definite white wine dryness along with an underlying honey sweetness. Man, I may need a lay-down after this. Finish had a unique honey/grape/malt admixture that swirled around in the back of my throat. It was a mellow beer for its given ABV and that may be its only drawback - it is too smooth to lay on the unsuspecting and even the more seasoned veterans may be caught unawares.

There is also a nice spiciness on the tongue,and a  bready quality. The mouthfeel is medium thick and somewhat oily.

All the same, the grape and honey part was really interesting because you could actually taste that aspect, so I want to give them credit for at least that unique aspect, although it is probably my least favorite Dogfish Head beer.

This is an intersting beer, but it's growing on me. Medium mouthfeel, goes down pretty smoothly despite the 9% abv and spices. Overall a pretty decent beer.

There were a lot of different things going on with this beer that made it pretty complex but not over done. This may not be everyones cup of tea, but I am pretty adventurous beer drinker so this feeds my need to search out the odd and unique. This ins't a beer I could drink more then one of or keep around in the fridge, but it is good for mixing things up a bit and I feel like the wine like quality's this beer has would appeal to women. If you like unique beers and enjoy a glass of mead and white wine on occasion then this brew might be for you.

Smell is that of an earthy and tart fruit spice, perhaps from the saffron and grapes. Aroma is very similar to a crisp and sweet white wine with its bright malt sweetness. A moderate and crisp body lets the earthy fruit and spice play on the palate and empty on a delicate honey noted finish. Next time I try this, I'd like to pair it with a light salad and/or a mild seafood dish. This is also an ultra cool time-machine into the ancient past...","albertjr21","Apr 03, 2011"

Aroma is much more of a tart, young wine than of beer- quite intriguing. Flavor is extremely complex but is mostly of the advertised muscat grapes. Is this a sparkling wine or a beer? After a few sips the flavor of honey emerges subtly, adding to the questions surrounding this brew. Given the 9% abv, I'd say wine. Not necessarily a session beer but not one to pass up- this one is too cool to miss. I would love to quaff the next one at a renaissance faire with a giant turkey leg.

Honey sweetness all the way through. Not much in the way of hops but I don't feel they are needed. Medium body, medium carbonation round out the brew.

A variety of spices dance around along with some floral and herbal taste. Sweet wine-like taste with the spices giving it a bit of a kick. Alcohol taste is present but not overly so.

While it's surprisingly crisp and dry, the mellow honey roll and kiss of malt gives it a touch of weight. Leave enough space of time in between having a glass of this. In other words, if you enjoy it as I do, I wouldn't suggest drinking this more than once every 3-4 months. It's a tasty respite from the norm.

The sweet and inviting aroma opens up to a most pleasant flavor profile, characterized by a tasty honey sweetness akin to a traditional mead, accentuated by the sweet and tangy grapes, well balanced by the barley, which is followed by a most delightful aftertaste that lingers nicely. From start to finish, i would say this beer is superb in many respects, and therefore highly recommend it to those who seek something truly unique in a beer.

I drank three at one sitting only because i was intrigued by the beer itself to the point where i couldn't get enough.The name itself really describes the beer.The first drink is rough but if u give it a few seconds u will really appreciate the craftsmanship.I think the only down side is the label, not very attractive almost looks like a mini bottle of wine.","mig78","Jan 20, 2011"

The beer has an almost Saison aroma to it. There are notes of fruit, roast, and green spices (which I had a hard time placing...basil and something). The beer is sharp and crisp as it passes your lips, and quickly followed by a roasted barley and peppery flavor. The spicy notes continue through into the aftertaste, combined with a very slightly sour malt character. Lingering finish, which allows some time to take in all the different flavors before the next sip. This is a very unique brew, and rather tasty, but not one I would tackle 'en mass'.","GarthDanielson","Jan 19, 2011"

Flavor is dominated by grape sweetness and floral honey. Big flavor impact from whatever herbs are used. No forthright grain or hop flavor and aroma. I enjoyed this beer the first third of the glass, but things turned south quickly and it ended up being a drainpour. The bitter herb flavor became too dominant as the beer warmed, and the grape flavors were also unpleasant and warmer temperatures.","kellyst","Jan 17, 2011"

4.2,12.6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"Going by memory again but I can't forget this beer since I've never really had a beer that tasted as close to wine as possible as this does. I don't like wine so I'd take this beer over wine any day which tells you that it still is beer. The first thing I smelled was those white wine grapes and the malt they used to match the honey. The malt and the honey mixes in well together the honey being subtle. Couldn't detect any hops at all which also contributes to the wine like character of this beer. Light carbonation adds to a very smooth mouthfeel and body. I really couldn't detect the 9 percent either which means they really used quality ingredients which makes it such a top notch beer when it comes to quality. When I smell wine the alcohol always comes out the most but this since its so well crafted and almost as much in alcohol as wine it smells of everything they put into it. Because of this it makes me come out liking this beer even though I probably wouldn't drink more than 2 in one night.

One of the reasons I like this beer is it's a good conversation piece. I've introduced it to friends that are non-craft beer drinkers and share the story behind it and the reactions have always been "this is a good beer!"

Smell is light sweet malt, fresh bread and a bit of pepper. Yeasty fruitiness folds into faint pears and apples and in the back some grapes. Taste is like the nose but bigger and broader. Subtly complex. Malt core is big and bursting with golden ale flavor. Sweetness is balanced by a vinous tartness and yeasty bread center. Saffron adds depth to the bread and is the perfect accent to the artful malt blend. Light fruits flow in and give a platform for the muscat grapes to meld with the hops in the finish. Hops are earthy and mild. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. Feel is crisp and creamy at the same time. The weight is perfect as it flows like a session ale but caresses the tongue like velvet.

Not much malt or any hops. Flavor true to aroma, with a medium to light body with a honey & grape juice sweetness kept in check by a light tannic and possibly hop bitterness that kept the palate clean.

Mild carbonation and little to no lacing. The taste is a blend of honey and hint of saffron with a sweet yet fruity and tart aftertaste. It is a complex blend of flavors that mask the high ABV very well. Drinkability is very good, with a nice crisp finish.

In my opinion it would be the perfect beer after a heavy meal to finish the night. At 9% ABV three or four and you'll finish the night right with a great desert finisher. Would go great with multiple deserts like heavy chocolate, cheese cake, etc... Only a 4 on drinkability because I think more than 3-4 would overwhelm most.

It was a nice change of pace to what I have been drinking lately. You can really taste the honey in this beer, and it gives it a very nice sweet finish. You can taste the alcohol just a wee bit in there too. I was actually surprised when I looked and saw that this beer was 9% because it is definetly hidden well in this which is also surprising since it is such a nice easy going beer. The mouthfeel was great on this, it coated the mouth nicely, had a nice medium body, and decent carbonation. The drinkability of this beer is just awesome. I could drink these all day.

There is more on the vinous character, but I wouldn't have guessed it was actually from grapes. There is a slight bitterness to be found if you look for it, but I think it's just enough to balance the sweetness. There is some wine like fruitiness that leads into some soft, fragrant honey.

The smell is overwhelmingly in fsvor of honey and white grapes, though not overly sweet. A modicum of floweriness also comes through, but only as background radiation. The taste follows, with the honey and grapes once again taking a preeminent role, and just as in the smell the sweetness is nicely toned down. The flowers from the smell are replaced by an equally mild bit of hoppy bitterness, creating a nicely balanced flavor. The body is nicely moderate and very smooth, lending this brew a high level of drinkability, though the ABV may try to say otherwise.","TMoney2591","Feb 19, 2010"

Pours a clear golden color with a large white head that had good retention. The head settles to a thick cap. Moderate amount of lacing is left on the glass. The aroma is dominated by the muscat grapes and honey that has been fermented into mead. Smells like a combination of muscatel and mead. A little research results that such a concoction does exist, it is called Muscadore. The aroma is so strong there is no sign of the 9% ABV. The flavor also results in strong grape flavors. The honey does not play as large a role but it still gives some mead-like qualities. The body brings some beer qualities back. It is medium bodied with enough carbonation to keep the beer from being slick or sticky. An interesting "beer experiment" that is worth trying or surprising guests with. Not something I would consider drinking on a regular basis.","morimech","Jan 10, 2010"

I haven't had one of these since much earlier in my Beer Geek career and I was not expecting it to have held up to my fond memories, but if anything I enjoy it more now than I did then. The honey character is fantastic and combined with the herbal hops and spices it is pleasantly reminiscent of a good pilsner. The flavors are much less subtle than those of a fine German lager, but they are eerily similar and tickle a lot of the same parts of the palate. I also appreciate that despite its powerfully sweet finish it manages to avoid becoming cloying (at least for one bottle). I wouldn't want more than one of these in a sitting, but it is a very nice beer and I am glad I revisited it.","nickfl","Dec 10, 2009"

At first, you get an intense muscat grape flavor; which I personally enjoy. After a few seconds, you get a spice kick with the saffron.

Finishes with a prickle of white pepper on the tongue. Mouth-feel was thin with moderate carbonation. At first I didn't like this at all, but also didn't know what it was.

There is a spice in there too but I can't put my finger on it. There is a dry peppery mouthfeel in the finish...kind of nice. The high alcohol in this mellows out as you drink.

4.27,14.5,4,4.5,4,4.5,4.5,"The beer pours with very little head, and it doesn't last long. The yellow appearance is interesting, but more yellow than golden. You can definately smell the essense of honey, with a hint of grapes that almost makes it seem like you're smelling a wine. It is quite an interesting balance. It's almost like it's a hybrid between a beer, a mead, and a wine. It definately tastes sweet, which I like, but with a lingering sweet aftertaste that bitter beer lovers definately will not enjoy. This is the only reason taste does not get a 5. I'm not a fan of hops-bombs, but this beer could definately use just a little more hops to help balance it out, though not too much to kill the sweet taste of the honey and grapes completely. The use of saffron is noted and gives the beer a nice spicy taste. Depite its 9% abv I cannot detect much alcohol, and the beer has a good mouthfeel, aside from the lack of carbonation. At times it's little like drinking a flat soda. This explains the lack of head on the beer, and I would probably score it better in mouthfeel, taste, and appearance if it just had a little more carbonation. Still one of my favorite beer, and has a potential for perfection.","JLan86","Jul 23, 2009"

I taste the sweetness of the grapes and honey up front, followed by the alcohol. Normally, I would not consider this a session beer, but after the day I had at work, it is tonight.

The mead-like qualities from the honey are balanced by the spicy floral notes of the saffron. The muscat grapes add another dimention of sweetness. The citrus from the hops is a nice touch since muscat is generally low in acid. The muscat jus adds a beautiful fruit component of apricot and I could gush on and on.

Faded orange-yellow in hue, mostly transparent, slow moving and dispersed bubbles visible. Your nostrils feel full but not heavy with scents of cinnamon paste, white grape, pear, yellow apple fruit, honeycombs, lilacs, candied orange peels, sweetly glazed bread, touch of caramel, because of its general fullness it is a little difficult to separate out the individual scents. Full-bodied, the relatively weak carbonation results in a bottom heavy drink, enters the mouth smoothly and then lounges about some. That said, satiny texture, there's no roughness and while it is sweet it never gets cloyingly so. Grape, apple, pear, kiwi and pomegranate fruit flavors abound. Clove, nutmeg spice is soft and relaxed. The orange, lemon, grapefruit citrus concentrated and juicy. Lightly bready, not much of a hops presence.

Tasted smooth and semi-creamy with notes of wine taste like grape. Again, a light malt taste that isn't quite caramel but something closer to honey/syrup (it tastes sticky). Also somewhat of a dry taste thanks to some hop bitterness and tartness from the fruits. A different beer indeed, but one worth trying.","clayrock81","May 21, 2009"

The beer is certainly on the heavy side of medium, but it is subdued by a dry smoothness and slight carbonation.

The first thing I noticed on the taste was the total lack of hops (hooray for a beer recipe that pre-dates the widespread hopping of beer.

The smell was complex and unique: sweet, a little malty, with honey, a mild mix of spices, a pinch of citrus acid. The grapes were apparent too. The smell was clean and crisp. The taste was the closest thing to wine that I've ever had in a beer. It was dominated by white and green grapes, plus there's honey and fruity tones. I couldn't taste the safron as much as I thought I would, but there were some other spices though. There was a pinch of alcohol and yeast thrown in too. The aftertaste was a little acidic and dry, which was good, because the mouthfeel had a bit of a sweet, syrupy aspect to it too, which may have gone a little overboard without these factors. The carbonation is a little tingly on the tongue. It's a nifty beer, and I really like the idea behind it. This one is a sipper, and I feel satisfied (and a little lightheaded) after this one.

I poured the beer into a belgian goblet glass. It poured a golden copper color with about 3/4 inch of head that quickly reduced to about 1/8 inch and maintained. First smell hinted of sweet musk and malt. Second pass picked up the sweetness of sugar and honey with a fruitiness of ripe raisin. Final pass picked up some vanilla and pepper on the back end. First taste was a surprise. I expected it to be very intense and ripe but it was nicely balanced. I immediately felt the carbonation on my tounge which was quickly followed by the flavor of ripe fruit tones, maybe grape or raisin? Hard to really tell for sure. I was shocked at the finish which I did not expect. The finish quickly turned malty and then balanced out perfectly with a nice finish of intense wheat. I loved the finish and it left me wanting more. This was almost like two different drinks in one. It was as if the beginning was there to set up the end.

Wow, this smells good - the barley malt becomes more evident, and the sweet grape recedes, as the beer warms. The taste has a sweet, herbal note at first, and then a fair dollop of field honey, with the malt backbone holding things up nicely. The carbonation is noticeable, but not detracting, and the significantly elevated alcohol appears only as a nice warming. It finishes dry, with the muscat sweetness pleasantly sticking around.

I can tell this is going to be a hard brew to review(poet, diden't know it)because it doesn't fall into "normal" beer style ranges...

The flavors are very interesting together, but not sure if I'm picking up any saffron. Medium to full bodied with a good carb bite on the finish.

It smells of rich sweet malts, a few hops hints and lots of sweet mild spices. The taste is similar to the smell and has a great crisp after taste.

Alcohol is quite evident in oily, spicey, feel and warmth but mostly pleasantly so. After the first few sips, the fresh bread quality dies down and the alcohol starts to take over a bit, threatening to become too rough and interfering with the drink a bit but never really dragging the drink down.

This beer goes beyond beer snobbishness (something I admit to), right into the kingdom of the beer nerd. All palates are different, as is a level of openmindedness, but this is more about conversation and image than taste here. I can't imagine someone enjoying his, period. Overly sweet. Too damn much grape. I cannot think of what I'd want to eat with this (maybe middle-eastern fare, rice and currant dishes?), or even imagine sitting down with a snifter and sipping this.

The taste is stronger on the barley with a lot of sweet grape following it. There's enough spice and malt to balance things out for most of my way through the bottle but not quite enough. The sweetness lingers a bit, like drinking too much Welch's white grape juice. I used to love that stuff, but the flavor defines the term cloying. While Welch's is an over-comparison on my part, the grape flavoring needs to be toned down. The mouthfeel is fine but gets a little sticky, or that could be a flashback to my brown bag lunches in grade school. Drinkability really suffered for me as I made my way to the end of the bottle. I was ready to be done with the lingering sweetness. It's not a bad beer, particularly for the variety, and I wouldn't turn down a free one, but I won't be paying 35 cents an ounce for it again.","popery","Sep 11, 2008"

Bottled 6/27/08 - Poured from the bottle into a mini snifter, "beer" is golden in color with a thin ring of carbonation that forms around the edge of the glass. Small amounts of bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass. The smell is a wonderfull boquett of grapes, a touch of barley and a hint of alcohol. The taste starts off sweet with honey and grapes, transitions to a warming alcohol bite and finishes with a malty, grainy finish. What a transition! The mouthfeel is fuller than I had expected, the carbonation is there but not overly aggressive. Overall, this is pretty drinkable for what it is but it is definitely a sipper although I believe one could easily quaff this. A very interesting beer and worth trying.

Aromas are slightly sweet, wet barley, grapes and apples. The flavors were impressive because they are well blended, especially because they totally conceal the 9% ALC. Honey sweetness first hits your palate followed by the green grape and assorted spices. Gets a little hoppy at the end when a bit of bitterness shows up. The mouthfeel is great, smooth and creamy at first but a little frothy as it goes down. This is (if you dare!) a sessionable brew which amazes me given its knockout punch alcohol percentage. Easy to drink, clean and nuanced without being in-your-face. A little better retention is the only thing it lacks. This brewery makes some great beers but this one is a must try.","thekevlarkid","Sep 04, 2008"

Those were either too cloying or too mundane. This one has the right balance. For that reason, I'm going to rate it higher than typical reviews. You have to be able to pick out the flavor in order to truly enjoy this ale. As I said, it might be even better with some aging and might take on more of a port-like quality.

Tastes like a port mixed with a beer fermented with a Belgian yeast then flavored with cooking spices. A bit of alcohol as she warms. Finishes kinda sweet with a lingering spice that holds the taste buds hostage. Thick body, sticky mouthfeel, ample carbonation. Different to say the least.

This smelled of honey, very sweet aromatics, but was nicely complimented by the buttery malty grain. A small amount of alcohol was detected, but certainly not overpowering. Tasted nice, first sip was mostly honey. Then the following sips were nice and you could taste the malt, and something on the back of the tongue. Not really saffron... at least was I could pick out.... maybe grapes?? It reminded me of some of the mead I once drank in Ireland.

Mouthfeel is good, if thicker it may have not tasted as good. Overall an intersting beer, a little sweeter than what I usually like but it is good and I can recommend.

Also a twinge of something else, which I think is the grapes. Kind of a slight wine like aroma to it as well, but something I can't quite pinpoint for sure, but I don't notice the saffron... A bit unusual. Wow, taste is quite sweet, but not at all what I expected... Honey is prevalent, a grain taste as well, but almost none of the 9% alcohol is there which is a huge plus. Has a bit of a white wine crossed with a sweet beer feel to it. Very unique for sure, and not as crazy and undrinkable as I feared it might be.

The head did not leave much lacing around the glass, but that isn't very surprising. A good amount of carbonation is evident in the glass. The beer did not burst with powerful scents, however, it did have a nice faint aroma of white grapes, almost a chardonnay(ish) flavor, with a nice dose of a pale barley malt. The initial taste was one of dry honey notes, white grapes, and a nice bready backbone. A little further into the beer some notes of saffron come out in the beer. I was surprised at what a heavy body the beer had; I did not expect that such a light beer, in many respects, would drink so heavy. I think a lot of it had to do with the large amounts of honey added to the beer. Though heavy, it was not unappreciated. This one will creep up on you.

There is certain fruity fructose sweetness to it as well. The mouthfeel is nice, maybe a little too carbonated. drinkability is very good for a %9 brew, that is for sure.

This is a very flavorful and refreshing beer, and a big thanks to my brother for bringing some(Dogfish Head is not available in Minnesota where I live). I'd say the ancients were onto something here.

The feel is light and bubbly at first and ends with a silky aftertaste, and you in no way can tell this one has a 9% ABV. Definitely a unique brew that is worth trying, though for some it might be a bit too sweet or soft. For me though I really liked it and would go for it again.

It has a very nice dark color to it (I drank it out of the bottle so I didn't actually pour it to see what it exactly looked like and what the head looked like) and had a very strong alcohol and fruity aroma. The taste had almost a wine flavor strong with sweet berries, which would makes sense that this is what King Midas would have drank. A really interesting aftertaste similar to the aftertaste of a sweet wine. This is not a very drinkable beer, but that would explain why it comes in a 4 pack. It is well worth the try because it may be the oldest known recipe which is definately worth looking into.","erosier","Oct 09, 2007"

Sweet honey taste up front mixes with a nice candy sugar and white grape flavor, white wine like with hints of a lemony grassy hoppiness as well. Mouthfeel is nice and fairly full from the sugary body and low carbonation. Very much like a lighter mead in some ways or like a sweet white wine, interesting for sure.

When I first poured it, the nose was completely dominated by alcohol, but after it warmed a bit, the muscat grapes came out with a lot of melon. I can detect the saffron after a swirl, but this really smells like a white dessert wine, and not a particularly good one. The taste starts sweet, in the front of the tongue, with honey and grapes, and works its way back towards the bitters -- melon rind & tobacco -- with some earth and spices in between. It's interesting, but cloying and boozy. It does have quite an interesting mouthfeel, very honeyish, but enough carbonation to keep it smooth and it certainly works all parts of the tongue. My major problem with this brew is that it wears its 9% on its sleeve -- I've had stronger beers that are much more discreet. Regardless, worth a try, and I'd be interested to see how it ages...","jbsteiny","May 24, 2007"

Smells fruity and spicy. Grapes and honey, like the bottle proudly claims, are discernable, as are myriad spices I'm not sure I can place. Some banana in the aroma as well. Maybe some light peach scent too. Taste is sweet and full-bodied. Some honey here, with other malted sugars. There's a pleasant hop kick too, to balance things out. I find the mouthfeel thick and chewy. This is a great concept-brew by DFH. I wouldn't (couldn't) drink this all the time, but I'm glad to have tried it again. When it's cold, you know it's a beer. But when it sits for a while and begins to warm up, it takes on much more of a honey-mead quality. At 9% ABV it will certainly leave an impression on you. Worth a try, even if you're not a fan of meads or spiced beers. Makes a fine after-dinner treat.","Atlas1","May 23, 2007"

Golden delicious apples and bubblegum esters are hiding in there, too. Very little in the way of malt aromas. Sweet on the palate, but not heavily so -- lots of fruit notes, lots of bubblegum. The overall flavor impression reminds me of grape flavored Big League Chew.

It has a thick syrupy smell that gives it a real sweet note. The taste is very over the top sweet right from the start. The first sip will make you pucker. Slight carbonated mouthfeel with an alcohol bite on the finish. The aftertaste is very dry coupled with a sweet and bitter finish. The mouthfeel is kind of flat and could use more carbonation. Has a thick body and texture . The alcohol is not seen directly in the taste, but only upon swallowing. This is definatley a well-crafted brew, but just not to my liking.

Honey, apricot, cherry, and grape. Taste is much of the same. Sweet all around with honey overpowering any other taste. This almost seems like a wine, very different. I just don't know where the 9% abv is? Drinkability isn't there just because it's so sweet for a beer. I definitely couldn't have more than one of these in a night. I had a tough time just finishing this one, not because it wasn't enjoyable, just because it was so sweet.

The aroma is interesting musty, almost meady, honey-laced and thick. As I sip this, I am intrigued by this barrier-breaker ... its alcohol warmth reminds me of ice wine ... its got a big malty undercurrent that almost tastes like a big, thick malt liquor ... and it leaves a sweet honey-like glaze on my tongue like mead. Interesting to be sure, but doesnt make me want to plop down $8 for a bottle again. Id rather get a 4-pack of the 90-minute IPA. Wonder how well Dogfish could do making a regular ol lager.

The head settled down to a steady layer of foam, with a good deal of lacing. The smell of the also seemed inspired by Belgian styles, as there was the noticeable saffron and spice presence, followed by the muscat grape smell, which is not too different than candi sugar. The taste was sweet and light, which was different than most Belgians which generally tend to be a lot drier. I could taste the sweet honey and white grapes, sense the floral delicateness of the saffron, and got a little hint of citric sourness at the back end of each sip. Alcohol was evident in a warmth, but not abrasive. Mouthfeel was light but sticky. Different than most beers, but not as different as I was initially anticipating.

Very sweet taste, with the ripe grapes and a sour finish to go along with a bready aftertaste that eases back into the grapes. Watery in the mouth with light carbonation combined with the heavy sweetness. The finish will make you think you are drinking chardonnay.

Hints of honey and grain as it warmed, but really looks and smells like wine. The taste, well lets just say, is this a beer? Don't get me wrong, its not all bad, I just really think this has all the earmarks of a glass of wine. Heavily carbonated white grape taste hits you from the start, as it warmed maybe some honey in there, grainy bread flavors and a touch of alchol, which is not suprising given 9%abv. It has a very light, and lively feel and consistency. Very easy to drink, again though it really felt like a wine. I guess its the style.

Honey is the dominant flavor here, but there is a hint of the grape juice here. I can't really say the malt and the hops are vivid here, but they are detectable. Overall this is unique and palatable.

Lots of alcohol hits my sinuses on this one which probably kills much of that aroma; maybe the word "tart" comes to mind. Not looking full-bodied, this tastes much like an old ale with lots of sugar up front (probably ages well); A slight bitterness comes through with a sucralose flavor which doesn't do it any justice, but grapes definitely jump out at me throughout, and the alcohol really hits me throughout the entire experience; wow! A bit tingly up front on the sides of my tongue, but a medium-to-full body which drys out a lot at the finish due to the alcohol burn. I actually like it but it is a "wee bit" HOT! wow! Due to abv. this one is a sipper. Probably too sweet to drink much of. I'd like to age one, but I'd probably not recommend unless you like the old ale/belgian type.

The aroma is very faint and unassuming, not much different then a Budweiser, or maybe a bit like a club soda. The taste however was nowhere near as subtle, almost entirely dominated by the sweet taste of honey with a touch of champagne. I have never tasted a honey beer that tasted so much like raw honey, almost as if it didn't fully ferment, or they added some extra at bottling. This made it to sweet for me, and I generally favor a sweeter beer. I did not pick up any traces of the saffron, and my Mom makes a mean paella, so I'm pretty familiar with it's taste. I guess it just got lost in the honey. I really liked what I assume I was tasting of the white grapes, reminding me a bit of a Saison, and wish that had been brought out more. As it was, with a fairly thin mouth feel and overbearing sweetness, I did not find this beer to be that drinkable, and would probably not bother with it again, unless I had cellared one for a good year or two, in hopes of easing the sweetness.","ccrida","Nov 27, 2006"

Initially sweet and a bit thick, white wines such as sweet Rieslings instantly come to mind. There is a tingly spiciness that permeates all corners of this as well as a clove-derived flavor. The spices seem to pile up through consumption. Lots of honey sweetness in the finish, but this is partially offset by the spiciness so that it is not overly cloying. I still pick up a bit of alcohol, but it is well integrated with some white fleshed fruit flavors.

However, those flavors were overpowed by cidery/sugary alcohol midway through the glass, which really hurt drinkability. Also, I'm not sure I tasted any saffron, which seemed like a waste to me since saffron is expensive. The mouthfeel was thing and slightly syupy, with medium-low carbonation.

For one, I can't decide if it's more like a barleywine or a mead. It pours like an elixer, but more silky, and with a deep gold color. Its taste reminds me of a mead, with a combination of fruity tones, but they are not sweet. At some points it feels like a wine, with a dry grape flavor. It's a complex beer that alters as you drink it, as the temperature changes, and as the alcohol settles in.

The colour was beautiful, almost like an orange honey colour. The smell was heavy, but not overpowering. Then came the taste. I couldnt really pick out one specific taste, but the alcohol bite was very noticeable almost too much, similar to a heavy barleywine beer. Again, not what I had expected from this beer. But I do have to say that for a beer of only 9%, it gave me a wallup like a much heavier beer would, so I would say that the alcohol rating was a bit under rated.

There is sweet fruity sugar(confirming that it is mostly the grapes giving it the sweetness) in the body of the beer, and a strange but good finish. The finish remained me of an oaked wine or a bourbon. The oak was prominent, slightly spiced, and just a hint of alcohol. The alcohol was noticeable, but the sweetness from the fruit really helped to disguise it. Drinkability/mouthfeel: Drinkablility is above average for this beer, but if you are not a fan of wine in general in might not be up your alley...mouthfeel is very much of a slightly carbonated wine, and does have some bourbon characters.

One is ok, two is good, three may be great, but four in a row is likely to many. The carbonation and grapes combine to give this beer a pseudo-wine or champagne like feel.

Tastes sweet esters, sweet amlt, thick body, with a rough alcohol ending. This is a really rich malty beer and I'll bet it would age really well. Said to be brewed with honey, grapes and saffron. I don't see the honey or grapes and I don't know what saffron tastes like. I guess I just get a malty dark flavor with a hint of spicy flower and a late alcohol burn.

Strong nearly astringant alcohol warming on the swallow. This beer merges with wine in its characteristics. Like a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor that cuts beer from wine DFH's sweet Midas crawls, slithering, along the edge of a straight... razor... and survives as a beer. Very little hop or malt flavors present. Super sweet, sugary, honey flavor with roasted earthy grains in the background. Buttery from an high diacetyl but tollerable with the sweetness provided by the grapes. Hops provide a nearly herbal spice - corriander and citrus. The aftertaste is dry, tart, and crisp. A moderate-to-full body with 9% abv, but drinkable if you like sweet liquids. Suggest you try one from tap or just a single bottle.

The nose is, well, distinctive: grape and malt, with a touch of spice (I assume that's the safron) and slightly sour. These are not good images here. The mouth is very prickly and quite thick/heavy, presumably from the fruit juice. Taste? Oh my. Grapes and safron are definitely noticeable, sweet and sour, almost like grape juice on drugs. There's definitely malt here, and even a dash of coniferous hops that lends a dry bit element to the finish, but this tastes and feels much more like a mead than a beer. Not a very good mead either.

It overpowers the grape easily, leaving me wanting a bit more. As I let the beer warm, the honey falls to the back and the spicy grape comes through more. Much better. The beer is nice and thick in my mouth, but the honey is again what dominates the mouthfeel. I'm just not that crazy about this much honey outside of a mead.

Yes it is cloyingly sweet, but there's considerable depth in it's flavor elements, and memorable for its historical context. The dense honey sweetness is no surprise in a big DFH beer, nor is the substantial ABV, but they do limit this beer somewhat. The blend of flavors make it palatable, but that alcohol, and the fact it sips more like a cordial than a beer, seriously truncate how much you'd want. Sure, it is a curiosity, but it's also one more intriguing experiment from the first state's gutsy brewery. And I'm glad I tried it.","Foxman","Feb 28, 2004"

This stuff has to be the smoothest and best tasting beer ive had, stouts excluded...theyre pretty smooth. Midas Touch has a nice honey flavor which is probably why it is at 9%. I had this beer about 6 months ago and seeing it on this site again i am going to get another 4 pack tonight just because how good it is.

It may be the saffron that is mentioned on the label, but I never would have know if it wasnt on the bottle. A touch of floral hops and alcohol are also in the aroma. Palate, like the nose, seems to be quite complex. Theres a smooth sweet slightly malty start shortly followed by fruity flavors. Some sweetness and smoothness is also added by the honey. Grapes and grape skins are quite noticeable, and Im still detecting a touch of apple. The finish is sweet, yet is also slightly hoppy and fairly tart. The malt comes through a bit more again in the aftertaste. Theres a bit of a warming sensation as this brew goes down. Full mouth feel with a nice carbonation. Great brew that is pretty complex and definitely unique. Im finding it a bit tough to piece together all the flavors in this review.

Decent carbonation. The head that was produced was of a butter cream/tan color that when first poured rose and stayed for a time before it fell to a ring on the edges. Its body was cloud like fluffy. There was some lace present. The aromas were different then I expected, sweet, honey and grapes dominated the aroma with hints of spices (allspice), saffron, light herbs and alcohol. The tastes were fairly simple, flavors of honey, and alcohol hit you first, then sweet malts, followed by some dark fruit and apricot, and sweet grapes, then as it left my mouth hints of saffron and wine were left. The aftertaste was fairly faint, mostly sweet honey and wine. The body was medium. Once warm it became thicker, creamier and slightly sweeter in the mouth.

No head worth noting, even with an aggressive pour. Label says it contains barley, honey, white muscat grapes, and saffron. Aroma is, of course, complex and confusing. Honey, grapes, vague spices, and many other fruits to confound the nose. Mouthfeel is thick and somewhat vinous. Taste is fruity sweetness upfront, with apples, apricots, and grapes. Sweet caramel and honey also jump into the deluge. Spiciness, alcohol, and a touch of floral hops provide the balance. Surprisingly drinkable for a big beer.

Im not really sure I would call this a beer if I were handed some in a blind tasting. It has some of the qualities of a late harvest desert wine and some of a dry cider. It has an interesting origin, and I will always try this kind of beer. I applaud brewers who are not afraid to try different things, and this is one thats out there. It is definitely worth trying.

I noticed surpisingly little taste until I had swallowed - Maybe just a little grape sweetness on the tip of my tongue. However, after swallowing it was a very soft, smooth sweet finish, with the grapes again being the dominant flavor. Although I do agree with the previous reviewer that this was like a soda, I was satisfied with the way it tasted. It was just very subtle in its ways, and I noticed no apparent alcohol besides the slight touch of sweetness. If it weren't for the high price on these puny little 4-packs I would buy more.

The taste is where this beer gets most interesting, as it's possible to detect every ingredient listed on the label. The main flavor here is upfront, sweet honey, followed by notes of graininess, wine-like muscat grapes, mild saffron, and an alcoholic finish. Sweetness dominates, however. Mellow carbonation gives way to a smooth, syrupy mouthfeel overall. Not an overly drinkable brew, but one I'll sample again. Seemingly, only Dogfish Head makes beverages like this.

The aroma is very odd, containing scents of honey, alcohol and some spices. The beer is very thick - much more thick than a wine or something, but surprisingly drinkable for the pouring characteristics.

It pours a clear, gently sparkling, deep orange-ish amber body with a creamy yellowish head that drops shortly but keeps a decent collar and leaves some minor spotty lace. Sweet, and almost candyish grapes (like Concord grapes) sweep across the nostrils accompanied by a distinct honey-ish character. It's very mead-like with some alcohol and a slightly herbal note. The aroma is interesting; not really welcoming, but not off-putting either. The full body is enhanced by a fine and moderate carbonation that caresses the tongue. The flavor is most reminiscent of a mead, but also like a fortified wine; and it even has some sherryish notes. There's not much beer character to it, but I think the malt component helps to add to the body; and also softens the alcohol component. Definitely interesting, althought I view it as more of a wine or mead than beer. The high alcohol helps to keep the sweetness from becoming cloying, but it had its drawbacks - most importantly a lacquer-like quality. Still, fairly well done for what it is.","NeroFiddled","Jan 21, 2003"
3.9,4.6,4,4,4,4,3.5,"The whole premise behind this drink (a combination of a mead, wine & beer) is really innovative. Poured a golden tan in color with a white head. Aroma consisted of honey, grapes and saffron. Mouthfeel was smooth. Taste had hints of fermented honey, grapes and alcohol. Alcohol is not overpowering at all and flavors seem to balance well within this complex elixir. Congratulations again to Dogfish head for pushing the envelope and coming up with something truly unique.","Winter","Jan 04, 2003"
3.71,-0.5,4,3,4,4.5,3.5,"Well, a look back in time to ancient brews and brewing methods. When served cold, it had a very distinctive nearly caramel quality that reminded me strongly of Victory's Ol' Horizontal Barleywine Ale. While not altogether bad, it wasn't altogether good either. Letting it set awhile so it could come close to room temperature was the midas touch it needed to really shine. The caramel receded, to be replaced by a more balanced ale flavor, vaguely reminiscent (as has been already noted) like mead. While I liked it well enough, I think this is more of a "tasting" beer than a "drinking" beer for me. As always, your mileage may vary. Kudos for Dogfish Head for being so experimental in bringing this brew to market.","stingo","Jan 01, 2003"

3.83,2.7,4.5,4,3.5,4,4,"This beer poured a dark gold color and formed a nice foamy white head that left circular lace as it subsided. A good deal of carbonation is present. An aroma of honey, grapes and spices. A flavor of honey and grape. Buttery finish. Not bad for an experimental beer.","Wildman","Dec 02, 2002"
3.5,-6.2,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,3.5,"Opaque and thick yellow tan color, head settles at 1/4 of an inch after some early action.  Grapey nose, like a grape soda,  with a cheesy up smell.  Thick mouthfeel, sense of grapes, honey thickness as a mellowing agent and some molasses flavors.  Little balance.  Saffron gives it a weird color.  Since everything but the kitchen sink is thrown in this brew, maybe this does approximate ancient recipes with its thick Meade-like sweetness.  OK, I suppose...I'll pick up another bomber the next time I get an invite to a pagan ritual.  Kind of insipid.","ADR","Sep 03, 2002"
2.9,-22.3,3,3,3,3,2.5,"This is a very experimental brew. Very similar to Mead but much better. I have never been a big Mead fan. Too sweet for my tastes and so is this. Very candy like tastand very similar to a heavier dessert white wine. I could not have more than one.","Jdiddy","Sep 01, 2002"
3.97,6.4,3.5,4,4,4,4,"Orange in color with little head and a lot of carbonation.  You can definitely taste the muscat grapes they use in here and not much else.  For what it is, I really enjoyed it as a beverage.  The only reason I would dock it points is if I knew there were going after a certain style and did not follow specs.  Very interesting and worth a try, especially if you enjoy dessert wines.","jreitman","Aug 25, 2002"
4,7.2,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours with a yellow head.  Golden orange in color with little bubbles.  Smells of honey and grapes.  Sweet grape /honey taste.  Totally different than anything that you have ever tasted in a beer.  They drank this 2,700 years age at a grand funerary feast and it is as unique as the history it represents.  Not an everyday beer (mead) but a nice trip back in history.","frank4sail","Aug 15, 2002"
3.61,-3.2,4.5,3.5,3.5,4,3.5,"A nice golden-orange clored brew with plenty of apparent carbonation.  It has a thick, rocky, white head.  Solid head retention, with residual lace almost completely coating the glass.  Smells and tastes like a mild mead.  Grape comes through somewhat in the taste & smell, mixing with a slightly yeasty aroma.  Very smooth and easy drinking beer.  Overall, a bit too mead/wine-like to become a regular, but a good brew for a change of pace.","Viking","Aug 09, 2002"

3.6,-3.5,4,4,3,4,4,"This beer is golden with orange highlights.  Nice head.  Nice retention.  Sweet aroma.  Honey.  Smells like a braggot.  This beer tastes fairly bland to me.  There are some sweet honey tones.  The impressive thing about this beer is that it is 9% a/v.  If you want an easy drinking high a/v beer, this is it.  Dangerously smooth and easy drinking.  Personally, there is not enough complexity in the taste for me to sample this one very often.  (Especially given the price.)","Bighuge","Jul 02, 2002"

4.37,17.2,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4,"This brew was a bit different than I expected.  I was looking for a strong malty brew with a harsh alcohol character and a finish to take paint off the family vehicle.  What I found was a hazy golden pouring with a thick foamy off-white head. with a complex aroma of musky grapes and slight hint of alcohol.  The first taste uncovered a complex heavy grape and honey sweetness with a musky oaky finish.  This concoction was very smooth for teh alcohol content and is reminiscent of a fine aged wine.  Nice work.","beernut7","Jun 30, 2002"

Could serve as a great replacement for champagne.  Slight Belgian yeast flavor.  Creamy and smooth throughout.  Very dry, wheaty finish.","Andy","May 24, 2002"
3.7,-0.8,4,4,3.5,4,3.5,"Unique - gotta' admire Dogfish Head for taking a shot at reproducing an ancient grape/barley/honey ale.  Not like anything I've run across before.  The aroma is that of wine, or a wine flavored malt beverage like cold duck.  First sip was sweet and very wine-like.  Only at the end did any hint of malt slip in.  I was not terribly taken with this at first, but as it warmed, the malt became more noticeable (but the grapes never gave much ground).  At about room temperature, it seemed like some strange hybred between a Belgian dubble and a barleywine.  An interesting experiment, but I'm ready to move on.","Brent","May 12, 2002"
3.72,-0.3,3.5,4,4,3.5,3,"Notes: Great to have an experimental brew here and there, bring this to a dinner party to funk things up. After a couple of bottle of this they won’t know up from down or wine from beer. Other than that it is not a beer that would be considered an everyday beer nor a beer you can drink much at all. More or less a beer to share with a meal … seems to pair well with garlic studded pork loin with brown rice (that could be cooked with saffron) and a sun-dried tomato spinach and goat cheese salad.","Jason","Apr 09, 2002"
4.2,12.6,4,4,4.5,4,4,"I must admit from what I've read and the description on the label, I really didn't know what to expect from this brew. It was really more beer like than I anticipated. Slightly hazy peach colored liquid. Nice pillowy, lasting tan head. Grapes, honey are evident in the aroma and flavor along with a touch of alcohol. Definitely sweet, but not cloying. Considering all the unique components in this brew, the flavors blend pretty well. Overall a unique, worthwhile treat.","John","Mar 27, 2002"

4.05,8.6,4.5,4.5,4,4,3.5,"The first sip that I took of this beer, I thought that it was going to be too sweet for me, despite the amazing complexity of mixing mead, wine, and beer. Not too often you get to try a beer that has been reported on by the New York Times as a matter of archeological interest. The muscat grapes do add a tartness that was not here the first time that I tried this beer. I think it detracts from the drinkability. Not as much of a fan anymore, but still a great, unique brew.","Erix","Oct 31, 2001"
