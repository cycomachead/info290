"Very good beer on its own. Fantastic with a piece of pizza. Refreshing herbal scent and taste."

"It's a solid beer but I couldn't drink more than a couple."

"O: Interesting brew, seems well executed and enjoyable. Not a go-to option, but surely one I'd like to have around."

"O- love the basil, but it left me wanting some more honey."
""
""
"O: This is an easy drinking beer that would seem to make a good pairing with Italian food or a veggie burger."
""
""
""
""
""
"D: Very enjoyable beer, light, refreshing, complex and goes great with pizza. I'll start looking for this one in bottles."
""
"Overall not that I would buy it again it was an interesting beer worth trying just to see how basil is incorporated in a beer. Its actually not as bad as other say."

"It's not all that good for a spice beer (which is not my style, anyway, but I tried to take that into account)"

"Plenty drinkable, but unfortunately there isn't anything beyond the very mild taste of basil to hold my interest."

"Poured a cloudy amber with no head. Nothing amazing, but not horrible looking. Scents of malt, basil and a slight bit of honey. It's got a bit going on here, but it's not quite strong enough to get your anticipation up. Flavor begins with sweet malt and a yeasty ale character, moves into a slight bitterness and ends with the taste of fresh basil. Basil also dominates the aftertaste. It has a medicinal quality that reminds me of chewing fresh basil. It's not bad. Mouthfeel is light bodied with low carbonation. Standard, easy drinking feel. I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. The herbal flavors imparted by the basil really work with the sweet malt flavors and the dryness from the honey, making it a nice refreshing beer. It's a nice herbed beer to try if you don't want something too extreme."

"The basil provides a perfumey complexity, though it's quite sharp and slides over to the acidic side. However, this must be the best basil beer I've had. It's a tough proposition but they made it drinkable. Also the only drinkable Bison beer I've had. On tap at Sea Rocket in San Diego."
""

"Overall a strange beer; I wish it were a little more robust. If your going to do something weird that go for it all in. Even if the flavors end up not working, at least you went full force with the flavor instead of doing a psuedo unique beer like this."
""
""
""
"Overall: if you really want a basil beer, then absolutely go for this one. However, don't be surprised at what you get -- this beer is absolutely as-advertised."
""
""
""
"A really good flavorful and unique ale, drinks easy and tastes good. Something I could drink regularly."

"pour is a reddish amber with a thin tan head. The smell is very much like an italian cafe, the basil is subtle but somehow very apparent, the honey is integrated well adding sweetness and depth, also notes of peppery spice and some oregano. Seems well balanced but just not aromas I like together or in beer. Taste is the same with notes of dough, this is basil pizza esq. the honey is subdued and the basil is forward with spice and oregano. Strange stuff but well made for what it is intended to be."

"It came from ... the back of the fridge! Found this lonely looking Spring seasonal hanging out in the back of my fridge. Bison Organic Honey Basil pours out a red-amber color with a finger of head. The aroma is basically what the nose says. Honey and basil. On the tongue though ... hey, is this a pumpkin beer with honey? Of course, pumpkin beers very rarely taste of pumpkin, they taste of the various spices. And I'm getting this big-time behind the basil and the honey. The mouthfeel is light and highly carbonated, and the drinkability isn't all that great. Too much on the spice for me. Overall, less interesting than I expected to be honest."
""
""
"O: A novelty. A good beer if you would enjoy a basil beverage. I feel that the basil could have been more subtle and playful and not overwhelming."
""
""
""
"Dark amber orange with a large, fluffy pale yellow head. Complicated mixture of honey, pumpkin, basil and caramel malt in the aroma. Big pumpkin and caramel flavor that floats into a big hit of basil spice on the first sip. Herbal, earthy, mildly spicy body with a malty, creamy mouthfeel. Mildly bitter, spicy finish. Very interesting brew, never really had anything like it."
"Overall: Probably not for everyone, but I really enjoyed it. Very well balanced overall without being too complex, and I could probably have 2 or 3 in a session. Love the combination between the honey sweetness, biting hops, and earthy basil. A great beer to enjoy in the spring or summer months."
""
"Pours a murky dark orange with a 1/2 inch foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, basil, and some slight honey aromas. Taste is pretty sweet with some malt/grain flavors up front and an earthy basil spice flavor that lingers long after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is drinkable but definitely odd and not something I would get again."
"Honey Basil’s a little light for my tastes — I have to work too hard to get the flavor. The basil is nice, but I’d like more hops to mix with it."
"Overall: If the basil flavor attracts you, give it a try. A unique profile for the palate."
"O: I am not a fan of the style but this is one I would drink again."
"Overall very pretty sweet which is probably due to all the basil."
"Overall, this is a very unique and smart summer beer."
"Taste-Toasted malt,clover honey, herbal basil note. Rather delicate, subtle flavors in a decent balance and interesting flavor that just manages to pull it off. A nice match for some red-sauce Italian cuisine."

"A very malty flavor with big hints at honey. Despite it's presence in the nose, basil comes on late but then becomes dominant. Malty and herbal without enough hop to balance it. Lively carbonation but a small amount is enough. A weird mish-mash of tastes. You won't want more than one."
""
"Notes: A good palate opener/challenge, but not a beer a will buy again."

"Though the brewery has used an interesting and somewhat surprising combination of flavors for this beer, they have done what many others have failed to do when attempting something similar, and that is execute the concept to a high standard. I'll be drinking this again in future."
"O: A intriguing herb beer to say the least, you don't see basil that often. Fun to try, inexpensive, worth a shot."
"Some good points, some not so good points. Different and probably more of a nice tick than anything else. Not something that will be selling keg after keg of (or bottle after bottle for that matter), but an interesting mix of ingredients and some point of difference."
"Quite refreshing really. Grew on me a bit over the course after I was initially ready to diss it as a gimmick but it does work."
"T: Still no basil. I got a lot of honey and caramel with some malt breadiness throughout. Not bad at all, but didn't have a ton going on."
"Pours a hazy golden copper hue which leaves a fast vanishing one finger head and a rim of lacing,the smell is obviously lots of honey and basil mixed with sweet malts and earthy hops,the mouthfeel is light bodied and has tastes of sticky honey,strong basil herbal notes,sweet caramel,toffee malts and finished with a earthy hop spicy dryness and overall an average drop that would be the perfect compliment to a spicy thai dish but to be honest i would not revisit this cheers."
"O – Decent beer I had been wanting to try, its something to scratch off the bucket list."
"Glassware: Snifter"
"12 ounce bottle, $7.99 a 4-pack. Served in a tulip glass as recommended on Bison's website, the beer pours a hazy orange/amber color with about a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. The aroma is weak, but nice. It smells like honey, basil, and herbal aromas in general. Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, it tastes like honey, basil and herbs, but there's also a slight medicinal flavor. Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, it's a bit slick with moderate carbonation. Overall I think this brew is just average. It's not bad, but it's not exactly good either. Worth a try, although I think given the chance I definitely would have been better off buying a single bottle instead of 4."
"This is a good everyday beer. It drinks easy like a macro brew with a bit more flavor and alcohol. A bit watery for me, but good overall."
"O - A very drinkable beer for being a specialty."
"Overall - very decent brew. Not overwhelming at all, but interesting in its taste. A very good surprise from an organic beer."
"This is a very creative beer and it's worth seeking out. Though at $10 a four-pack, I won't be drinking it regularly."
"O- This beer is good and fresh. I wouldn’t go out of my way to find it. I mean, I had this at a beer tasting and I enjoyed it so I picked up a bottle. It was something new and different (for me)."
"D- Overall, I didn't enjoy this one all that much. As a big fan of basil, I was excited to try this offering. The basil was pretty much non-existent and the rest of the beer was uninspiring. "
"(On draught at Papago). Pours clear golden-orange color with white head. Aroma has loads of basil, sage, herbs and honey. Taste is surprisingly bitter with a sweet honey-like malt backbone. Medium bodied with oily, slick texture. Bitter finish. OK, but something I would not search out"
"O: Sort of impressed, but not all that really. The roomate enjoys these types of beers with fruits and honey and such, but I'd prefer a nice dark stout instead."
"O - Not bad. I was expecting more honey taste however. I'm a fan of the natural sweetener so I was a little disappointed there. But this beer does pair well with some foods."
"D - Eh, not bad. I'll pass in the future. Interesting enough to try though."
"O: If you want this type of beer, good on ya. Neither of us finished our pour."
"Cheers to Bison for rockin' tasty, Organic, Living brews."
"Very drinkable, though only subtley distinguishable from average beers. Must be taken more slowly to appreciate the subtlety of the herbal malty character which could easily be missed. Not really a memorable beer itself, although it would be great with food, say pizza or fish or perhaps pasta. Could be savored as a session beer based on the residual aftertaste."
"D: This taste like an amateur beer that needs more of a malty backbone or hops. Don't think I would drink this again anytime soon."
"Final Notes: I actually really like this beer. A nice sweet beer and one to check out for the honey lovers. Good beer to have with breakfast."
"Easy to drink. And would probably be another good food beer. I like the suggestion of pizza another reviewer put forth."
"12oz bottle into a Corsendonk tulip pours a crisp orange with a decent eggshell head that diminishes to a ring and leaves slight lacing on the glass. Aroma is basil and garlic with just a touch of honey, only a mild malt presence appears on the nose. The taste is sweet malts up front with an interesting spice balance. The beer is light, smooth and very easy drinking. I believe this beer would pair nicely with pizza, I'll have to try that sometime!"
"Pours a murky orange amber with little head. What head there is fades to a very thin swirl. Smells very sweet. with lots of honey and a vague herbal flavor on top. I'd like the expression of basil to be clearer, as is the aromas are too sweet and muddled. Almost medicinal at the end. The flavor is a little better, with less sweetness and more balanced herbalness with a finish that has some more noticeable basil flavor, and some light firm maltiness. Drying toward the end. A little bit watery, but overall fairly drinkable."
"D - This is an odd beer, it tastes much more like a spiced winter beer than I would have expected. The honey is present in the aroma but only survives as a background note in the flavor. The spice character is all over the place and is clearly influenced by the caramel malt character. The only clear basil note I get is in the aftertaste and even then it is obscured by toasted malt and lightly fruity yeast that seem to produce spice notes, such as coriander, that apparently aren't there. Interesting, but a bit cloying on both the sweetness and the spice notes and not all that drinkable. Worth a try, but I'm glad I don't have a six pack of this."
"D: Enjoyable mild ale with simple herbal flavors that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the beer. Light and refreshing, this would be a good beer to crack on a hot afternoon."
"This beer really surprised me. we had it early and I was like this is goign to suck. Wow. great ise of honey and the basil gave it a nice herbal lemon flavor. not overpwering in any area and a solid beer at that."
"This is a really good beer, probably more similar to a saison. Very drinkable if you like something a bit different."
"Pours into a general ale amber color, with a standard creamy head. The aroma is similar to an amber as well, with hints of hops, a sort of wheatiness, and (and here's where it starts to get unique) there is a hint of, surprise surprise, basil. The taste follows suit, with the basil receding a good deal into the background. There isn't much of a honey flavor involved, though I do believe it added a bit of lightness to the body (without resorting to uber-effervescence), which made this brew a rather drinkable one, despite it's overall lack of general character."
"I have never had a beer drinking experience like this so Bison definitely gets props for creativity. So, if you want to try something totally odd go find this one--if you can. As for me, I'm just glad I bought a single and not the whole 10-dollar 4-pack!"
"Drinkability: I came to this beer with exceedingly low expectations but wound up really enjoying it; bet it would pair nicely with spicy Asian cuisines"
"D: An oddly drinkable beer."
"Drinkability- I was always hesitant of trying this beer because I couldn't picture what basil would taste like in beer...well, this one doesn't taste like basil, but it does taste very good. It's one of the easier drinking beers I have had as well."
"Appearance was a pale amber with decent carbonation. Smells is dominated by basil, but not an overwhelming aroma. The taste is also dominated by the basil. The honey is very subtle at first, but seems to come through more in the finish. A bit thin on the mouthfeel. I really wasn't sure I'd like this style, but it's actually pretty good. Not a beer you'd want in mass quantities, but still a good change of pace in the summer and probably is an excellent food pairing for chicken and the like."
"Drinkability: With its oddball flavor profile, this sure is one droll beer to taste."
"MOSTLY this started great and as you drink it it gets harder to stomach the over spiced beer."
"If Organic Honey Basil is a money maker for Bison, they might just as well start a whole new line of herbal beers. Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme might be good places to start. As far as plants go, however, I think I'll stick with hops."
"Beer is good. Happy different beering."
"Crystal clear mellow gold. Towering, glass-filling head of loose packed dusty white foam of mixed size bubbles. Heavily dimpled surface that slowly settles, but leaves a thick chunk on top all the way down. There were a few wide, thick strands of lacing. Minimal carbonation streams drift upwards. Sweet, light honey and zest comes through along with a ginger ale soda aroma. The lightly sweet honey fills out the initial flavor with just a touch of pale malt. There is a spiciness that shows up in the finish that is barely discernable as basil. Had I not known to expect basil, I probably would not have identified it as such. There is a general saison component to the taste that is perhaps more suggestive than actual. The spiciness changes over to a bitterness which clings at the edges for a tad bit too long. Medium body and smooth to soft mouthfeel, the carbonation is on the low side. Nice that this is a certified organic beer which includes basil from Watanabe Farms and honey from Britts Honey, but the basil was barely discernable. Still, this was enjoyable."
"This beer poured very golden and clear with no head, not what I expected from other reviews. Its smell is very nice and reminds me of the times that I have made mead, ""very faintly"" but it did really. This beers taste has little resemblance to mead though, the basil stands out a little bit which makes me wonder where the hints of garlic. (Should I brew a pesto beer or just add honey and beer to my next pesto?) Over all this Honey Basil Beer is very welcoming, especially strait from the freezer on this first 80+ day of the year. I would recommend this for a Mid-Summers Day picnic serve as cold as you can get it. Cheers"
"I hate to say it, but I think this beer could be a little better if the malt and hops were NOT organic. I am a true believer in organic foods, especially meat and milk products. But I've yet to have an organic beer really wow me. That being said, this honey basil beer, along with Bison's Chocolate stout, are definitely the best organic beers that I have tasted"
"Drinkability  I cant say that I plan on finishing the entire bomber, but its not half-bad."
"Received a bottle from our local rep the other day and figured I'd give it a try. Pours a slightly cloudy golden color topped by a big, foamy white head. Aroma offers what the name promises - light honey, sharp basil, some lavender notes, and some astringency. Palate is more of the same - basil is the dominant character, with light hops and a tinge of honey sweetness. Body is nice, light and refreshing, but there's a good bit of tangy astringency that's slightly off-putting. Maybe this floats some people's boats more than others, but I found it difficult to finish the bottle. Nevertheless, an interesting offering."
"Poured into a pint glass out of a 22oz. bottle. Pours a golden color with a head that soon disappears into a few bubbles. Slight hop aroma with strong hints of honey and some lemony smells. Taste is good, had nice hop backbone with honey and cirtus flavors. The basil flavors seem less noticable. Feels a little thinner in the mouth than I would like, but still pretty good. Very drinkable."
"This was a great beer. Very refreshing. Great on a summer day I would bet. Nice drinkability and clean, crisp mouthfeel. Light to medium body. Very enjoyable. One of the best spiced/fruit beers I have tried."
"This was one tasty little surprise: sweet, crisp and very drinkable. Definitely worth a try, especially if youre looking to sample something different. Recommended."
"Iam always looking to try new and interesting styles of beer and honey basil seemed like a diferent combination.Poured a dull golden with a thinner quick vanishing white head leaving no lace,the aromas were the best thing about this beer in my mind very floral with that honey being a bit more noticable than the basil.Flavors start out with that honey sweetness and steadily fades into the quite noticable herbal basil flavor also a touch of mint,the finish is lightly earthy and that basil pops up again.I kinda like it, its different but not obtrusive its on the lighter side and I think would be food friendly."
"Overall: I wasnt sure about this one, but I found it to be more than pleasant. Fans of the range of brews from Heather Ales (Fraoch, Grozet, Ebulum, Alba, etc.) should enjoy this, I know did. Nicely done for those that like the style."
"An interesting try once beer, but I feel no need to return."
