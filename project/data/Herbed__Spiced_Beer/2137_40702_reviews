"Blue moon without the nasty after taste. So basically just a better blue moon."
"Nice clean taste.  Good color."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, best before 2/4/2015. Pours hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, clove, wheat, biscuit, honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of bready malt, agave, and fruity/earthy yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, clove, wheat, biscuit, honey, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Minimal earthy bitterness and light wheat tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, orange peel, pear, apple, light banana, clove, wheat, biscuit, honey, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. very nice robustness and balance of bready malt, agave, and fruity/earty yeast flavors; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately creamy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with zero warming present after the finish as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a damn nice pale wheat ale style. All around great robustness and balance of bready malt, agave, and fruity/earthy yeast flavors; and extremely smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering."

"Was not happy with this one. Tasted like Corona."

"Fan of wheat beers but not of this one. Taste reminded me somewhat of a BL Limearita. Also has an odd smell that accompanies the beer. Swing and a miss on this one."

"I bought this on grand opening day from a big box wine chain store. Some earthy fruit on the nose, a hint of mustiness and a shot of skunk. Pours hazy, murky straw under a ½” off-white foam cap that quickly dissipates to a thick film. I try to swirl off the skunk but it still interferes with the big fruity flavors over white wonder bread that lead to a tart finish and a suspicion of wet cardboard. Well carbonated with a very creamy medium body. My rating gives this beer the benefit of the doubt, assuming that some of the flaws in my bottle derived from mishandling. My rating gives this beer the benefit of the doubt, assuming that some of the flaws I tasted derived from mishandling by the big box retailer and not by brewing mistakes."

"A fairly tasty, well-made wheat beer, full-flavoured, and not too sweet.  I guess the agave adjunct is more about helping the body out, or something, if I recall the Breckenridge episode I just watched on repeat for the past 4 days at GABF."
""
""
""
""
"Perfectly good Wheat beer."
""
""
""
"This is an interesting flavor to put into a wheat beer.  I'm not a big wheat guy, but I liked the attempt to do something different.  Nice change from the typical wheats, but not one that made me like the style any more."
"Pleasant, slightly citrusy taste. Nothing out of this world, but it goes down very easily!"

"12 ounce bottle, a friend gave this to me recently and I have no idea how fresh/old this is. Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a hazy gold color with a half inch off-white head. Head retention and lacing are both average. The brew smells like wheat, apples and honey/agave nectar. Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some bready malt and apricots noticeable too. It's mostly sweet tasting. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit coating and has a decent amount of carbonation. I think it's an OK brew, but it really doesn't do anything for me. With that being said, it's worth trying if you've never had it before."

"Decent fruit beer out of Breckenridge. Could be an interesting switch-up for orange juice during breakfast."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- the light thin beer has an odd tang to it that might be agave flavor but it is a bit too soft to tell. There are some wheat hint s but not much."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O - I was craving something light after a long day of work. This hit the spot, kind of. It's decent, but wheat beers aren't really my thing."
""

"Altogether, not bad but just a little too sweet for a good summer brew.."
""

"Beer poured from bottle into glass. Good amount of foam that stayed. Color was copper, slightly red. Decent carbonation. Weak aroma, wheat, light lemon flavor. No agave taste, but agave syrup doesn't have a strong flavor either so maybe expecting too much. Good mouth feel, medium bodied. Taste not very strong, bready wheat flavor, didn't pick up multiple flavors. A beer without an assertive personality."
""
""
""

"O - nice quenching beer on a hot day, sweetness not coming from agave?"

"Pours a hazy golden color with LOTS of sediment left in the bottom of the bottle. A very thin white head with some spotty lacing. The aroma is of wheat with spices. The taste is of wheat with citrus and cloves that leaves a slight tingle on the tongue. Slight bitter and dry finish with medium carbonation. Overall, it was different."

"Pours a two finger white head that fades quickly leaving some lace. hazy light amber color, some yeast left in bottle. Medium carbonation and light-medium bodied. Light lemon and wheat nose and flavor is lemon with some agave sweetness. $2.99 for a 12oz bottle from Julio's Liquors Marlboro, MA"

"We were sitting in The Sandbox in her backyard as further proof that The CANQuest (TM) CAN take place anywhere at any time. The Crack revealed yet another brimful craft CAN. Before I could initiate the Glug, The Old Lady looked over and exclaimed, ""Oooh, I've never had it in the CAN!"" ROFLMAO! Not wanting to waste another second, I got the Glug going and then really gave it to her. Color was an extremely cloudy golden-yellow, near pineapple juice, with a turbidity like river water. SRM = 6. Nose had a soft mandarin orange scent. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium with a nice orangish flavor in the mouth. Finish was semi-sweet, still orangish and really much better than I have ever had this beer either in a bottle or on-draft. Score one for the CANs!"

"It seems that everyone is drinking Breckenridge Vanilla Porter this summer, but I was surprised to find their agave wheat beer, and I had to try it. There's the wheat and broad sweetness in the smell, and the taste is full of the wheat with the touch of agave, which doesn't add much in terms of flavor but does seem to provide an unbalanced sweetness, which seems to be the main problem with this one. Mouthfeel is relatively dry, with moderate thickness and a sticky aftertaste. Overall, it doesn't offer much, and again, it's too sweet and too sticky for me to drink in a session and not interesting enough to seek out again."

"Overall- Not a total flop, but not going to drink it again."

"This is a pretty good and highly sessionable ale. The agave goes over really well in my opinion. This beer is underrated, but I understand why as it is different and feels a little weird for a beer taste-wise. Personally I think this agave-flavored style has a future and I'd like to see more of it. I could see agave ales becoming a class of their own. It has a good malty sweet characteristic that isn't cloying and pairs well with biscuity malts while keeping a beer light and sessionable. Give it a try."
"There's no WOW factotrhere, but it's very drinkable and refreshing."

""

"Overall it's an easy drinking summer beer, nothing world class going on but as far as agave beers go, this is probably the best one I've had."

"Breckinridge agave wheat. Served on tap as the special at Morris Tap and Grill. Pours Light bronzed. On the darker side. Good head of foam. Peppery nose, spices. Light wheat taste. Tequila hint. Citrus in there too. Interesting. Nice summer beer. 4 375 4 375 375"
"Pours with 1/4 inch or less head, nice unfiltered yellowish. Has a hint of citrus but not very strong aroma. A little dry with citrus bite in first sip; should be great on a hot summer day. Not sure if the agave adds sweetness or what to the flavor. Some aftertaste but I have had more from lemonade or tea. Not a bad unfiltered wheat just not all that memorable."
""
""
"Overall – This was much tastier and thicker tasting then I would have originally expected for a brew of only 4.2 % abv. This makes for a nice sipping summer day brew while sitting outside and enjoying the sun."
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Better than average, but not really worth a second one."

"Agave Wheat is one of the few wheat beers that you come across that does not have a sweet fruit overpowering the wheat and ale characteristics of the beer. However the agave sugars does bring a little something extra to the table. Overall I'm a fan of this beer for what it is."
"This beer is unfiltered but it still pours up nearly crystal clear with a one and half finger white lacing and lots of sticky lacing. Smell is sort of bready, maybe wheat, even rye. Taste is sort of spicy sweet apples with not much in the way of hops to balance it out. Mouthfeel is nothing special. Just okay, but this one would be very sessionable due to low ABV and easy drinkability."

"I tried this beer in comparison to Wolaver's Organic Wildflower Wheat and was quite disappointed. A good unfiltered wheat, but I got no hint of agave flavoring. Drinkable yet unremarkable - smell was very wheat-y and there is a hint of lemon rind, which can be found in the taste, however it is missing a sharp acidic sweetness that would have really rounded it out in my opinion"

"Presentation: Packaged in a standard twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a New Belgium Brewing chalice."
""
""
"O: Overall I thought it was a pretty good beer, but nothing to jump up and take notice of. I would have preferred a stronger wheat beer with a more robust wheat flavor to compliment the agave character. I probably wouldn't drink it again."
""
""
""
"O/D-Interesting enough. Wasn't sure what to expect. No really my cut o' meat though."
""
""
""
""
"Poured into a frosty mug. Cloudy gold appearance. A fine head, I have a cold do smell unknown. Nice micro brew bite with a typically wonderful wheat beer flavor. I really enjoyed this beer. I need to add more content so blah blah blah blah blah bitty blah. There was an old lady she lived in a shoe man her house smelled."

"A good beer for a summer day which i am drinking just to try."
""
"Pours very hazy orange with a one finger of a white head. This wheat beer has notes of lemon grass, onion and wheat of course. A light dark fruit flavors. Not too earthy or spicy. More sweet and sugary then anything. Not too bitter or dry. A slight smooth feel. Easy drinking. A very average wheat beer."

"This beer is not going to knock your socks off but give it try if you haven't had it. Solid win for Breckenridge..."
""
""
""
""
"D - Nothing special, the agave adds some light floral and honey touches to the flavor profile that make it slightly more interesting than an average American wheat beer, but thats not saying much. Drinkable, but unremarkable."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall, a fairly typical, unoffensive hefe that tries to be unique. Not something I would really seek out again."
""
"O: A little tasty, goes down easily, not too filling, mild kick, good representation of style, it’s a decent beer but there are several others that I would pick first."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- Pretty good, definitely not a combination you see too often. Worth trying, but it's not going to make my short list."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very refreshing and slightly sweet take on wheat beer. Little more sweet than most wheat beers I've had. Worth looking for... Another good brew from Breckenridge."
""
""
""
""
""
"I've never been particular about things like appearance and smell, but that's not to say there's anything wrong with it. Mouthfeel and taste are notable however."
""
""
""
"I basically don't care for wheat ales unless they are loaded with fruit flavors or in some other way augmented. This is not that. Unless you're a wheat beer fan or just really want a wheat ale I don't see any reason to reach for this one."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Agave might be to vague to pick out but it does add an underlying layer that you know is foreign to beer. Not as drinkable as I expected but worth a try."
""
"3.0 D: Mediocre brew that has a great mouthfeel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This is a second beer I tried from them which sounded so very good but nowhere near lived up to expectations. Poured a 1"" offwhite head of average life. The body is a hazy raw sienna yellow color. Not much smell, even warmed. Not much taste beyond an average BMC. The agave at most adds a mild hint of sweetness but otherwise all I get is very lightly toasted malt. No finish to speak of. And the website says this is an herbed/spiced beer? Really? I didn't know agave was an herb or a spice, it's just another sweetener really."
""
""
""
""
""
"It's a fair beer. Tastes pretty good, though it isn't going to blow anybody away. It's combination of sweetness and wheat beer will at least make it different in a way."
"A so-so pale wheat ale with a nice signature. If you like these sort of brews, you’ll probably get into this one. They call it an herbed/spiced beer, and for that, it really doesn't showcase the agave. What I'm trying to say is that it doesn't stand out THAT much from pale wheat ales I've had. Who's to argue styles? It's decent."
""
""
""
"O - Not a bad ale, but i was expecting more wheat and/or agave presence. Seems to be a touch of both and mildly presented."
"O) I was pretty impressed with the taste and mouthfeel of this beer. A definite warm weather beer, and not much beyond that from my perspective. If you get the chance to try it on a nice warm day, it will likely hit the spot."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, this is a solid wheat beer that I enjoyed. Would be a perfect beer when you want something lighter with more flavor than the typical macro lager."
""
"Pours light yellow with not much head. The smell was dominated by the wheat with some sweet notes to compliment. The flavor is subtle but enjoyable, a wheat start, with the sweet notes following with a very mellow aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light, with a nice amount of carbonation, not much depth of flavor, but had enough to make this beer enjoyable. A light refreshing summer beer, great for sipping on a hot day."
"O: a very interesting beer! Must try!"
""
"Overall I wasn't impressed with this beer and I thought that it was a pretty average example of a Wheat beer, the flavors were pretty bland and I didn't get any of the agave that was advertised which was a big let down. This beer had ok drinkability, it was fairly smooth and crisp, but that flavors couldn't hold my attention at all, one is enough, I want something that delivers what they advertise. What I liked most about this beer was the appearance and the aroma, they were both a little better then average. What I liked least about this beer was the bland flavors and the fact that the agave didn't show up in the aroma and taste at all and that should have been showcased in this beer. I wouldn't buy this beer again, I would much rather have an Oberon, I don't recommend giving this beer a try, it's a waste of agave. This is the second beer I have had from Breckenridge and it was another unimpressive and average at best beer just like their Lucky U IPA, I am still down to try another beer from them, but it better be a good one if they want to hold my interest, so far I'm not impressed with them."
"Overall: drinkable but much is left to be desired. many in this genre over ""fruit"" the beers whereas this one doesn't have a distinct enough fruit presence."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is a very interesting beer. This bottle was given as a sample from a distributor. To be honest, an entire 6-pack might get a little sweet for me, but I could possibly see drinking a couple of these on a hot day."
""
""
"O - I'd just finished walking 7 miles in the sun when I stopped and had this on-tap. I liked the different flavor and feel. Maybe I was particularly thirsty, but I had a second one with my sandwich. The low ABV was nice as I was able to continue walking another 5 miles to my destination. It was just the thing for me today."
"O - Sorry for the short review, but I could not find anything stellar in this beer except for the brief creamy banana presence...I could see this being popular for someone transitioning into craft beer"
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Glad to have tried it but wasn't overly impressed with this. Unique twist on a wheat beer, which im a huge fan of, however I was expecting more flavor all around. Would like to try it on tap to compare."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Having on draft in AZ. A -Color - light golden yellow. S - Nose - almost none. Really sticking nose in glass to try to get anything but to no avail. T - Taste - toasted wheat bread sans butter. A little salt...light. Creamy lingering finish. O - basic, unimpressive, pass. Next."
""
"A nice slightly sweet brew that Im glad to have tried but not sure I would hunt it out on my next trip to the beer store."
""
""
""
"D - It worked pretty well as a refreshing beer on a hot day, but it's not special. There are much better wheat beer to be had."
""
"A sessionable beer even from a tulip glass, but probably better suited to a frat party. While easy to consume, I find no reason to try this, or any other Agave beers for that matter."
""
""
""
""
"OV: Very cool take on a wheat beer, spicy and peppery without being overpowering. This beer wasn't too much to rave over but the originality of this brew and natural taste make it worth buying especially for a summer ale."
""
"O - I wavered between a 2.5 and 3 for an overall. It definitely had some of the characteristics of a wheat but it was only average when it came to taste. This beer is worth trying but it not an exceptional beer."
""
""
""
"Would pair well with a beef or chicken burger or after a few dull beers. Not a beer to start off with..."
""
"pours a thick cloudy yellow color into a frosty pint glass with a 2 inch white head. smells yeasty, and is very visibly unfiltered. also some bitter hops in there and wheat malts. flavor is refreshing, mildly fruity, and you can definitely taste agave, which by itself is a rather difficult to describe, mildly sweet, lush plant. feel is too thick for this beer, too full bodied to be a good summer beer, but good carbonation keeps it fairly easy drinking. my pour was perhaps toward the bottom of the keg, because it was much thicker and more cloudy than the bottles of this that ive had. either way, a creative take on a wheat beer, just not my favorite breckenridge product."
""
""
""
""
"Not the best wheat beer I've had. A bit watery and thin. Lacks body and is slightly over-carbonated for my liking. Hints of banana and bubble gum on the finish. Decent head that dissipated rather quickly. Minimal lacing. Wouldn't go out of the way for this one."
"Wont buy again."
""
""
""
"I can see this being popular with people being introduced to craft beers, but it lacks the complexity I was hoping for."
""
""
"Notes: A good beer start to finish and very drinkable. Cheers."
""
"Not bad but you can do better. Perfect for someone who's never had the style though so good marks for that."
"D-Overall this was a very drinkable beer. Didn't have the complexity i was looking for but overall a very tasty brew. I prob. won't be seeking it out b/c i think there are other beers that are similar that i like way more. But overall i was pleased to try it."
""
""
""
""
"Overall, I like this take on the wheat beer. How many agave wheat beers are out there? The low ABV is great for sessioning this anytime of year, in my opinion. This is not my favourite Breckenridge beer by any means, but it most definitely is my favourite wheat beer."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall - This beer is very refreshing and it was nice to try something different with the agave. I like it a lot."
" This beer has a fresh zing, and is wet enough to be thirst quenching. This yeast flavour is more like a light lager than a heffeweizen. This might be a suitable lawn mowing beer."
""
""
""
""
"o A drinkable wheat. Some smoothness that I did not expect from wheat. Went looking for something unique with the agave found a smooth wheat."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"A decent wheat beer, the agave add to the sweetness of the wheat."
""
""
"Some very interesting flavor transitions. Very refreshing. An aftertaste that leaves you craving more. I really like this beer. Not my favorite wheat beer in the world but it has some unique characteristics that you won't come by too often."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O – Ok. Light and drinkable, but not nothing spectacular."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Particularly for style, this beer actually has a pretty body to it, with some depth that while light doesn't feel remotely thin. It's not heavy but it has a full creaminess to it yet still has a crispness and, unlike so many of its like, is actually genuinely refreshing. The finish is very quick, but it's a good feel."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This brew poured out as a hazy orange gold color with a fluffy white head on top. The head leaves a touch of lacing on the glass but nothing too exciting. The smell of the beer is sweet, it's got a nice minimal fruitiness to it balanced with the wheat in there too. The taste of the beer isn't too strong with the Agave, it's very subtle and tastes pretty refreshing regardless. The mouthfeel of the beer is smooth much like a typical wheat beer. Overall this brew isn't too bad. I think it's worth trying but probably won't knock your socks off."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, beer is a very hazy, creamy peach color with a thin, stable head. Nose is mostly wheat, slight notes of fruit like pear and white grape. The flavor is similar to the nose with the wheat and fruity notes dominating, lingering bitterness on the finish. No real noticable flavor from the agave however the mouthfeel is heavier than I had anticipated with a thin yet creamy carbonation. Overall, a good wheat beer - nothing really special if you're looking for the agave to knock your socks off but a solid beer."
"If you've got an MGD-drinking friend that you'd like to introduce to real beer, this is a nice first step for them to take."
"Serving type: Bottle poured into perfect pint"
"I had high hopes for this beer since the name has two of my favorite things in it: Agave and wheat. Unfortunately, neither shine with this boring flop. I'm deducting points from the overall score for getting my hopes up."
"O: Not bad but doesn't show any agave characteristics as its name would imply, which is disappointing."
"Drinkable because it is light and clean. Good carbonation. I would not get this one again, but it was worth a try."
"75."
"Just an okay beer. There are much better wheat’s out there."
"Appearance is a cloudy yellow with a short white head. The nose on agave wheat has grass, wheat and some citrus. Its` taste contained flavors from lemon, wheat, malt...fairly refreshing. Mouthfeel is light bodied while there is an acidic quality to it."
"O - Not too shabby. Not the greatest, not the worse. A decent brew that I may come back to another time, but not one that would be a regular favorite."
"The agave at least gives it some character, but there isn't much flavor here. It's pretty tame."
"Overall: A decent enough beer. Worth a try, but not something I would run out to get. Got a 6-pack on sale for $7.99. This is normally $9.49, which it is not worth that price (not even $8 IMO). Still a decent drink, good in the summer heat."
"D: Well, it has good marketing. The rest of it is sort of plain and run of the mill. It is solid and good, but a bit underwhelming if you are really expecting something. Just looking for easy drinking? Spot on. After all, it is a summer release – you aren’t going to be sipping and contemplating this whilst sitting before a cozy fire."
"overall: reminds me of something on the lines of a Magic Hat #9, sweeter characteristics brought forth from what I assume are the agave notes combined with the heightened quality of the malts makes this one worth a try."
"O - This is a wheat beer that’s unique but doesn’t go out of its way to be different. It’s not a novelty beer. It fills a niche, between the lines of where one craves a hefeweizen, a summer wit, or a plain unfiltered wheat. Big on flavor, but it's subtle flavor. Refreshing, and a harmless 4.2% ABV, I always try to have a pint when I find this on tap."
"As for the alcohol, I almost didn't think this was beer, since this was so mellow and easygoing. While there are better offerings out there, this will please just about anybody and would be a decent choice on a hot Summer day when a something more than a mass-market offering is called for. Some more flavor would have been great here, as this beer had enough body to it to cut whatever would have stood out. Instead, this proved the adage about beer being ""liquid bread' to be true, since I felt somewhat full after downing my bottle."
"Had this on a 12 Fl. Oz. bottle and poured it on a Hefeweizen glass. This beer showed a cloudy golden yellow color with a one-finger head that lasted for quite a while. Almost no carbonation was observed in the behavior of the body. Some lacing present. It was very hard to define the smell for this beer because it was very 'low' but I was able to gather hints of wheat and grass. Taste also had hints of grassy flavors and wheat present along with a bready touch and a very small spicy feel and aftertaste."
"Poured a cloudy orange-tinted yellow, noticeably carbonated, with a foamy white head that dissipated to almost nothing. Typical wheaty aroma, with hints of citrus and resin. Typical wheat profile on the taste buds, a bit acidic, citrusy, with agave as a subtle sidekick. Left a bitter aftertaste, but not too bad. Light body, and generally drinkable, though not really enough for me to want more."
"Overall – This was a pretty boring beer.. I really didn't pick up on the agave nectar all that much. It tasted like a basic run of the mill wheat beer. I wouldn't buy this one again."
"This stuff has always been interesting, but not enough for me to buy any. Thankfully, there are tastings at Bliss. It pours a cloudy straw topped by a finger of white foam. The nose comprises fake blueberry (think pretty much any blueberry wheat ale available on the market), dark wheat, light orange rind, and a dash of nutmeg. The taste holds notes of wheat, coriander, white grapes (lightly tart, and only just barely that), nutmeg, and grapefruit peel. A vague astringency lingers on the tongue. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta dry finish. Overall, I cannot say I was a fan of this beer. The agave nectar doesn't do much for it, and it comes off as astringent and medicinal regardless. Luckily, things aren't exactly offensive, either. Just not very good."
"Summary - Glad I gave this one a try. Honestly, I know what Agave is, but have never tried it in anything (beside tequila). Maybe I will after this. Nice beer."
"I have to admit I was somewhat disappointed by this brew. I really like the other Breckenridge beers I've had, and was hoping I had found a good afternoon type beer that is readily available in my area. Alas, I probably won't get this one again. The label is cool, but I can collect other cool labels that cover better beers."
"O: The beer goes down very easily and has some refreshing properties."
"I really enjoy this beer. It's nice and refreshing. If it were readily available here in Maine, I think I'd drink a lot of this during the summer. If you have a chance to try this one, I recommend it!"
"Pours light yellow with not much head. The smell was dominated by the wheat with some sweet notes to compliment. The flavor is subtle but enjoyable, a wheat start, with the sweet notes following with a very mellow aftertaste. The mouthfeel was light, with a nice amount of carbonation, not much depth of flavor, but had enough to make this beer enjoyable. A light refreshing summer beer, great for sipping on a hot day."
"It is light bodied and there is a certain crispness present that makes it really drinkable. Carbonation level is just right."
"Definitely interesting, although I'd say a bit of a novelty. I probably won't ever buy it again, but its certainly worth a try."
"D - An interesting ingredient doesn't always make for an interesting beer... Not completely terrible, but not something that I would recommend or seek out again..."
"overall not impressed at all, some wheat flavors there, but a bit of an unpleasant mass produced off flavor, and the mouth is just weird and unpleasant."
"The beer pours a slightly hazy golden color with a white head. The aroma is grain with a little bit of sweetness, possibly from the agave. The flavor is pretty nice. I get some nice sweet notes from the agave and also get some fruity notes that closely resemble grapes. There is also some nice wheat and grain notes in the flavor. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Easy to drink."
"Pours like an unfiltered, cloudy wheat beer. Yellow with a small white head that stays throughout. Some high-pitched grass/citrus in the smell dept. Taste immediately starts off with some tartness from the agave, then dries out with it as well. Lemon & a bit of apple; fruity and refreshing. To be honest, not much in the way of the wheat, but it's probably there more to keep the body balanced than for flavor. An interesting beer - I enjoy tequila, so I wouldn't mind drinking a few of these now & again."
"O: not sure i'd drink a sixer of this, but on a hot summer day, it's a nice beer."
"Pours a murky light yellow color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that fades to nothing. Random spots of lace dot the glass on the drink down. Smell is of wheat and some fruitiness (from the agave I would imagine). Taste is the same as the smell with a pretty good fruity taste coming through. This beer has a high level of carbonation with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall this is a pretty good beer for what it is but I am not too sure I would drink this one very often."
"Breckenridge Agave Wheat is a cloudy straw colored beer with a small white head that quickly vanishes. It has a light wheat aroma with a phenolic note. It's pretty light bodied, bubbly and pretty smooth. The finish is a little slick and a little watery. It tastes pretty solid and well balanced. It has a lemony wheat flavor that gets twangy at the end of the taste. It's pretty spicy with a note of black pepper. There is a decent amount of bitterness that seems kind of herbal, for lack of a better term. The aftertaste is lightly phenolic. I really don't know what agave tastes like, so I couldn't pick it out. This beer is more flavorful than I anticipated. It would go nicely with grilled chicken."
",(12oz bottlefrom Total Wine Desert Ridge). pours cloudy bright yellow with white head. Aroma has wheat, sweet syrup, something peppery? Taste is sweet, almost cloying for a wheat beer. Medium bodied with slick texture. Bitter finish. Not bad, but not great."
"D- not bad and a nice wheat/spiced beer. I bought a sixer and wasnt dissapointed."
"The mouthfeel is more medium-bodied, but some ample carbonation helps it match the taste better. The drinkability is quite good. Overall, this is a solid and fairly unique American wheat that I recommend."
"Very fresh tasting and refreshing. Thirst-quenching and easily sessionable on a hot summer afternoon."
"Somebody called the flavor ""honey and aloe," and I think that sums it up well. I'm a big fan of unusual flavors in beer, and this one at least adds another one to the list. It's quite drinkable but makes me want a ""real"" wheat beer."
"Overall: I have had this beer a few times now and every once in a while i just want a easy drinking craft beer like this. I wish we had something out west more like gumballhead but this isn't bad for what it is. I will have to do a side by side with this and Oberon some time this summer."
"Overall: Good. Definitely worth a try, especially for the novelty beer lover."
"O: It has a pleasant twang of sourness and a hint of lime that is refreshing. Ample carbonation keeps the beer light, and it is smooth. I was expecting a lot more from the agave nectar, which seemed like a very unique and exciting addition to a wheat beer. However, the result is on the average side. As the beer warms, the flavor of agave nectar becomes more pronounced, but it still does not offer a completely unique wheat experience. This is a refreshing beer that matches warm weather and salad (with feta cheese) well."
"Different - pretty refreshing overall with a subtle tartness that was actually pretty pleasant to me."
"Overall: not a bad beer for a warm summer day, but a bit sweet for a wheat beer."
"Poured with a beautiful golden amber color that almost looked two-toned in the glass. Very cloudy with little head; less than a finger of bright white foam which was gone in a few seconds and barely came back when agitated. Very strong smells- some apricot present and an overwelming sourness akin to sourdough bread. After seeing and smelling Agave Wheat I expected some strong tastes, but didn't quite get them. There was the wheatiness that comes with unfiltered wheat beers and sour fruit that matched the smell, but I was hoping for an even stronger showing of sour fruit based on the smell. Nevertheless it was still good and it finished with a lingering tartness that I enjoyed. Definitely had some zip of carbonation to it. Mouthfeel was fairly watery and light. Very drinkable- the rest of the 6 pack will be easy to put down while sitting at the beach in the next few days. Tasty and somewhat unique- definitely worth a try."
"Soft, smooth and moderatly fruity, wheat under belly. not sure what agave tastes like, so not sure if its in there. Pleasant enough wheat, in a fruity and refreshing sort of way. Nothing special, but just about worth a try."
"Smooth taste, clean wheat character. The agave seems to give this one a clean, syrupy undertone. And although this may seem a bad thing, this beer is a pleasant, session drinker. There's not a lot of depth here, but not bad, by any means."
"Overall, I am a fan of wheat beers - Heffs in particular. This unfiltered was fine, but not necessarily a repeat performer."
"O: ""Meh"""
"Notes: For an instant it brought me memories of ugly/marketing driven tequila flavored brews. Luckily it does not seem to push it in that direction although it shares some of the iconography and a hint in the palate. In any case it drinks well but it is also pretty generic. Something I would not mind offering maybe to generic guests on scorching days."
"D: Good level of drinkability, non-discriminatory and easy to down, probably fair well as a summer drink. A typical American wheat beer? not really, comes off as a tweener or intro for style for the light craft drinker."
"Otherwise, the taste was average, nothing special other than the odd smell/taste."
"Cloudy, hazy straw yellow color, one inch of white head that dissipates quickly. Smell of wheat malt, slightly sweet, some orange or lemon citrus. Taste is that of a pale wheat ale, light wheat malt grain, some grassy earthiness, citrus bite. Light, crisp body. Refreshing mouthfeel, slightly tart, acidic finish. Would be a good summer drink, but I couldn't find anything different or unique."
"o: nothing too special about this beer in my opinion but still a good brew. i would take this over your average american wheat beers, but i was expecting a more eccentric brew. so in that aspect, this beer has failed."
"D - Total Summer session beer. Perfect for a ballgame or a tailgate party in the hot sun. I wouldn't rush out to find this one again, but it's a decent option if readily available."
"Very interesting, original flavor, and refreshing for a wheat ale."
"Drinkability: I would likely pass this up for another wheat beer. I think it's mostly the smell that detracts for me."
"Better wheat presence in the taste. Comes across as a corn based cereal. Short lived aftertaste with a mild hop bitterness. High carbonation but also a high body."
"D - This just wasn't a beer that gave me an urge to take drink after drink. The grainy sweetness was just a bit to much for me."
"Pretty drinkable beer, except it leaves a slightly unbalanced after taste."
"Overall: A great idea with so-so execution."
"D - meh...I don't like it too terribly much."
"D: a wheat beer I could easily pass up if I saw a knew untried beer, but would love to pick it up again this summer."
"Serving type: tap"
"Typical looking wheat beer with a white head. Somewhat lemony in the smell department. Hard to place. I wasn't expecting to be blown away with another wheat beer. But, this one did the job. I'm not exactly sure what the agave is supposed to taste like. It had a dry wheat mouthfeel. Very drinkable, your basic wheat with a slight twist."
"D= very drinkable, probably works fine with any food that would go with a witte more so than a hefeweizen."
"Drinkability I could have several of these, but not a six. The agave adds a sweet/tart/different taste that is good. I think this is one of Breckinridge's best and is certainly better than the couple other agave beers I have had."
"Drinkability: This was a fun experiment. More enjoyable than some others, but I guess Agave is no magic nectar."
"D: A friend gave me some while I was visiting. A very drinkable beer that would be perfect for a summer day on the beach. I had 3 throughout the night and I would definitely drink this again."
"The beer pours a hazy dark golden color with a thick frothy white head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is decent. It has a dry, pale and wheat malt scent along with a light agave fruit aroma. It's crisp and refreshing with a mild fruit edge. The taste is decent as well. It has a dry wheat malt flavor as well as a light, fruity agave taste. It's pretty tame. The fruit is mild at best and is basically a complimentary piece of the overall taste. The mouthfeel is fine. It is a medium bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a pretty good beer. It's light and fruity; a great summer brew."
"All in all it was a nice beer. I feel it would be great on a hot day in the summer in a cold glass."
"D- This is a beer you want to try, but I wouldn't be the one to drink a 6-pack of it. The flavors are so strong I would almost say, after the first, you are done, but happy you tried it."
"overall only slightly above an average wheat beer; the idea of the agave is interesting, but isn't nearly noticeable enough"
"This wheat beer pours a very cloudy golden orange color. I actually held the class to a light and could not see through it. It poured a small head that quickly vanished. Not much carbonation. The smell was of wheat and a light citrus. Taste was a lot like the smell with hint of agave. I liked this beer because it did'n't have that over bearing orange taste. It was well balanced. This is a great wheat beer a would highly recommend trying it."
"Pours a cloudy golden with a thin white head. Not much retention but a very nice laceing. Aroma is of wheat and citrus. Body is on the light side of medium.Crisp, with some carbonation. Taste is of orange peel, and citrus. Wheat through out.Very nice."
"it didn't have too much of an aroma to it but it was pleasant in appearance and the flavor had just a little bit of something different about it. it was exceptionally smooth and easy to drink. something i would easily recommend!"
"This agave wheat beer pours a cloudy golden color with a good scent of wheat. Because of its lower carbonation it has a little smoother and lighter taste than a traditional wheat beer. The addition of the agave makes the taste stand out better but leaves the texture from carbonation less than desired. A good find and nice sampling experience."
"Drinkability is good if wheat beers are your thing. It's light on the palate and not as sweet as I thought it might be. This kind of thing isn't what I find myself going for though."
"Drinkability - This is a highly drinkable beer in my opinion. This is a great summertime brew. Honestly, I like this wheat beer better than most. Not overdone with spices like a lot of wheat beers that I have had seem to be. Lack of a head and head retention are really the only things that bring the score down a bit for me."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a cloudy golden color with a small head. Smell is mild, a touch of grains. Taste is also mild, the wheat is present, with some mild notes of agave. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and has good drinkability. Overall this is a fairly good beer."
"D: This is a summer beer for sure, I don't think I'd want it any other time. Very quaffable."
"Overall - even though I had a hard time picking out the Agave I did like this beer & would rate it above average & a nice summer beer."
"D: A decent mouthfeel and taste combination. Decent drinking beer overall that was pretty smooth and nice for a hot day."
"Aroma is wheaty and yeasty and has a subtle undertone I can't quite identify - must be the agave. It pours a somewhat hazy yellow with an average white head. Flavor is wheaty with a definite sweet undertone of - agave? Must be! There is also a hint of yeast. Texture is smooth, edgy and fizzy. Not too shabby."
"A light bodied, light tasting ale that would be a great warm day session beer."
"Wouldn't buy this one again."
"Overall a pretty solid brew I have to admit. While not the greatest thing in the world it can certainly hold its own for sure."
"Overall - A unique, likeable beer"
"Drinkability: Formulated with quick, easy consumption in mind, but, thankfully provides just a bit more character with its added agave flavor than some of the other altogether bland AWA's on the market."
"Unless you're into agave, my recommendation is to stay away. I'm not sure what to do with the two other bottles in my fridge. I may just pour them out."
"D: OK, but not great. Could stand an extra layer of complexity. The low ABV makes it a good session beer."
"I'll need to try something else with agave in it to see if it's the ingredient or this particular beer that doesn't hit the mark with me."
"Agave Wheat pours a yellow color with an off white head from a brown twelve ounce bottle. The aroma is mostly wheat and a touch of citrus. The flavor is similar, wheat is most noticeable and there is a hint of citrus and then a hint of something else that I can't really identify, which I assume it the agave. This beer is easy enough to drink, but is far from compelling."
"Not a horrible beer, but it's not for me."
"This beer poured a slightly cloudy gold and orange body with a small white head. I thought it was bit too dark for a wheat, but it is different so I let the color slide. The head was non existent after a few minutes, maybe it was the glass but it wasn't big and fluffy to begin with. The taste was agave, spicy and sweet but nothing else. The beer didn't keep up with the agave juice thrown in here. The mouthfeel was syrupy not light and wheaty as I was expecting. I was really bummed by this beer, it had way too much agave syrup and not enough wheat beer to balance out the syrup."
"D: Very nice summer drinnker. Enough flavor to keep you interested and the abv is low enough to make a BBQ out of this."
"D: Rather refreshing, easy to down. The generally malty sweetness and mild citrus (is it REALLY the agave?) harkened to a quenching witbier or a sessionable cream ale. Not available in Oregon, but if it was, I'd gladly have it again."
"The beer poured a cloudy light gold with a bright white head. The aroma was a very light malt. The taste was sweet malt, which was faintly muted which could be the effect of the agave. The feel was heavy and creamy, not what you expect from a wheat beer, but again I figure this is the agave talking. I found it to be an enjoyable beer, and was glad I ran across it."
"Edit...18March2009 Gave this another try last night and decided it was a drain pour. Too bad."
"Thanks, brewjones"
"Pours a light straw color that is surprisingly clear (w/a slight touch of haze) considering the ""wheat"" in the beer's name. A white frothy one inch head tops the beer and refuses to recede. Smells like hay and adjuncts with a slight hop presence in the nose. First sip is almost flavorless with a watered down malt and hop profile that you almost have to be looking for in order to find. This beer is not worthy of additional keystrokes."
"Drinkability: I could drink a few of these. I might not make it past three, but I'd probably think I would like to during the first one, and possibly into the second. That may be because it's kind of odd and compelling (which interests me), but it's at least also a little bit because it's kind of refreshing. The finish is dry, and also kind of salty. It makes me thirsty for more."
"Great hazey nectar like amber, but no head and some ok bubbling. The has unfamiliar herbs, granny smith apples, and some limey citrus. Limes hit the tongue first, I think from the agave. Then a bitter apple skin dashed with minty bananas finish off the taste. Citrus and herbal flavors mix well with this wheat beer. I was a litte scared of trying this beer, but was pleasantly surprised."
"The addition of agave is interesting to be sure and does save this beer from still being just another limp American wheat beer. But it doesn't make it great. Extra credit for trying something different. I wouldn't have thought of agave in a million years. I will say that this is a cut above your average American wheat beer."
"Imminently drinkable. With the low ABV, this is an all-night beer. Would go great with extra spicy foods or with pizza."
"D - Killer. This is an A+ beer to have with the Guatemalan breakfast (fried eggs, black beans, fruit salad, and fried plantains), or any other pancake or egg-based feast. This is a very unique brew that I enjoyed immensely, and this could make a lovely summer session brew for a hot sticky day."
"D: Very refreshing and a bit unique. I enjoyed it (well actually 3)."
"The aroma was interesting. Agave obviously as the main attraction but had a earthy, musty smell as well. Doesn't get me excited like hefe's or wits or saisons but did stand out a bit. The taste was also pretty good. Had a nice spice mix to go with the sweetness of the agave so well balanced. Again, it misses the flavor knock-out punch but goes down smooth. For me, this would be a good session beer where I don't need a ton of flavor but want something to go down easy on a scorching Texas day. Also would be a good change-up beer on tap. Recommend if you can easily find it."
"Since I was very pleased with the other beers I've had from the Breckenridge Brewery, I couldn't wait to sample this one. For the most part it seems to be relatively standard wheat beer; however, it's noticably sweeter than most others I've had. I'm not sure whether this is due to the agave character, but since I've never consumed the fruit by itself I wouldn't know. Not having done this previously is my only regret. Fortunately, this doesn't detract from the quality of another fine Breckenridge product - well done."
"Welcome to Kentucky Agave Wheat. And just in time to meet the heat of the summer, it should go over well. A firm wheat base malt is evident throughout the beer giving low bananna, clove, or bubblegum notes. Instead, an estery apple, lemon, berry, and pear mix gives the beer a refreshing, fruity taste. The lemon notes are complemented well by the agave flavors-- not so much tequilla, but a crisp, acidic, citric, vegitable/fruit character that stands out well without dominating the beer. The base beer is substantially better than most American wheats, but doesn't try to become too rich with breadiness or creaminess. Refreshing, minty, citrus flavors in the finish. A very nice summery beer."
"Pours a cloudy pale yelow color with a white head. In the aroma, fruity, agave and banana, a nice yeasty aroma too. In the taste, dry fruitiness and a dry banana flavor. A small bite, but mainly smooth mouthfeel, with a semi-dry and fruity aftertaste. Kind of fruity, and a nice dryness, good and different."
"If you like wheats, then you'll probably like this."
"Cloudy, yellow color served in a Breckenridge Agave Wheat pint glass at my favorite Mexican restaurant (La Cueva). The smell is wheaty and unsurprising but still good. The flavor is a nice wheat with the expected hint of cloves and banana and some earthiness to it. This was obviously very easy to drink and went well with enchiladas."
"D: Nope. It's too sour and candy like, not my taste at all."
"D - A couple of these would be fine if I wasn't thinking about it too hard. A nice, if a little bit different, take on the APWA."
"either way, this is a nice twist on what can be a somewhat boring style (american wheat)."
"Agave Wheat strikes me as a pretty good beer that could be a very good beer in the right circumstances (see the paragraph above). Kudos to Breckenridge for brewing outside the APWA box and for making it work."
"An easy to drink wheat beer form Breckenridge. It really hit the spot today outside in the sun."
"D - Not a bad wheat, but I have had better. Really wondering how the agave was used in this brew because I couldnt pick much of it up. Although I wouldnt turn it down if it was all I had avaliable on a hot day."
"Overall, this is not so good. FCB's Major Tom's is a much better beer in this style."
"D- A decent beer. A bit different, but not disappointing."
"Drinkablity - Usually I drink heavier, darker beers. But I can see my getting a six pack for a BBQ, picnic or other summertime activity."
"D - I bought this to see what agave tastes like in a beer and it is subtle enough I am not sure I can tell the exact flavors it adds."
"D - A very well made American wheat w/ the addition of agave makes this a step up from a wit/wheat IMO. The drinkability is high since it is a very quaffable refreshing beverage w/ a flavor that is hard not to like if you enjoy wheat beers."
"A yeast clouded golden color with a white head. The nose is of wheat and some very light fruits. The taste is similarly uncomplex. Lots of wheat and possibly some sweet agave flavors. Light body and ample carbonation. Good standard wheat beer, but could use a better malt structure."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly carbonated, yeasty, with some candy sugar making it's presence known. Interesting. I guess the agave comes across as a sugary, light fruitiness."
"Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Pretty low in carbonation and light in body as well. Pretty much expected for the style. Finish leaves my mouth watering for more. Don't know how much I could make love to in one night, however I can see myself picking this up again next season. Still not my favorite American Pale Wheat, but I like the unique character that this beer offers."
"Appears a murky yeast derived chalky yellow golden, vibrant white head leaves behind thin lacing all around my pint glass. Aroma citrus sharp wheat notes with powdered yeast pack accents. Agave nectar I'm not quite sure how that's coming across in the taste, but the citrus and wheat notes strike me initially with soft yeast notes in the finish and an unique quality not a bad American pale wheat much better than the typical version. Mouthfeel is light carbonation is prickly and finishes with more citrus peel zestiness. Drinkability is okay especially in the summer months not sure if this is a seasonal offering or a year rounder but it's okay."
"Appears slightly hazy yellow with a thin white head, no lacing. The aroma has a sweet, fruity note with toast and wheat. The flavor is a touch dry with a sweet honey-like taste from the agave. There's a bit of wheat in there too. Not a great beer, but refreshing and worth a try if you're into American wheats."
"Pours a cloudy straw yellow color with tiny white head, little retention, some lacing. Smells of banana, spices, citrus, honey, yeast, and bread. Tastes of bready malts, banana, a hint of clove and pepper, honey, with a subtle lemon and lime flavor in the finish. Medium Light in body with low carbonation. Crisp and sweet with a tart finish, very refreshing. Easy to drink and a nice summertime brew, an interesting twist on a wheat."
"D - This is pretty good for a wheat beer with flavor added. The agave is not overpowering and adds a nice touch of something different."
"Drinkability: Smooth, clean, crisp."
"d: Interesting take on a wheat. The agave is a nice little addition, makes it a little different. A refreshing beer that would be good for a summer day and would pair well with mexican food. Sort of reminds me of some Macro Mexican beers, but better."
"Drinks pretty easy, I could do a few of these on warm day before moving on. Much better than I thought it would be!"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this wheat variation using agave. The golden yellow clear coloration and aroma was just average for a wheat with hints of bananas and pears. The taste, however, was very smooth with a sweet aftertaste. The agave taste is subtle with a pear/citus flavor and very enjoyable. This brew could be enjoyed by itself or with a light meal. It's more of a summer brew, and I would definitely buy this beer again. I like it better than their Hefe Proper."
"At 4.2%, this one's a dream. It's so clean, snappy and fresh, it's a summertime must."
"Purchased: Plaza Liquors, Tucson AZ"
"Overall impression: This one isn't bad, but its a bit too sweet to be a real session beer for me."
"A very one-dimensional beer. Would be a good beer to session on a hot summer afternoon."
"An average beer, not bad, not great."
"Balanced wheat flavor is a good start however the sweet soon turns to sour. It leaves a sour aftertaste that I don't believe would be the agave since I have enjoyed agave syrup in the past and it is quite sweet. It is a drinkable beer especially with something salty like roasted almonds or peanuts. This one needs to be reworked and if it is I would give it another chance."
"Cloudy orange colored ale with aroma of wheat and faint citrus.Taste is pretty much the same,wheat and very faint agave aftertaste.Nice smooth ale with little carbonation that goes down like water.Something I wouldn't mind having again...not great but definetly good enough to have a couple at one sitting!!!"
