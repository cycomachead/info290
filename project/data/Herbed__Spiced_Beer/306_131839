Nose of cinnamon (duh) and light caramel malts.  Flavors follow the nose with cinnamon and caramel malts, a serious cinnamon spiciness to the rear blending with a small dose of grassy hops, and even more cinnamon.

3.92,8.9,3.5,4,4.25,3,3.75,"I twisted off the cap and gave it an aggro pour until the foaming action was too much to handle. Backing off, I watched as it formed two fluffy fingers of snow white head with good retention. Color was a slightly hazy Yellow-Gold (SRM = 4 -5 ), but the purity was too flawed for my gold-digging buddies, Midas, Croesus and Mammon to want to show up. Nose smelled like rice pudding with cinnamon atop! I have not had MexiCAN horchata in many years, but this was really evocative of it. Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. Taste was rice pudding with cinnamon, but not as pronounced as on the nose. That said, as it warmed, it really began to live up to its billing! This was such a pleasant counterbalance to the previous beers this afternoon that I was ecstatic that I had saved it until now. Finish was semi-sweet, but nowhere near as cloying as it could/might have been. I must get #TheOldLady to try some and give me her opinion.","woodychandler","Feb 10, 2015"

It had an almost overwhelming and surprisingly pleasant cinnamon smell. It actually got the core taste of horchata without being undrinkable due to sweetness.  Very smooth and easy to drink. Light carbonation and a very light tongue feel.  The traditional wheat taste was not strong, but enough to balance the sweetness.  As a desert beer, it is pretty good.  I got it out of curiosity and had low expectations for it.  Even though I expected it to be a cavity ""beer", it fulfilled the titular taste without being too sweet.","OKbrew89","Jan 25, 2015"

So I was kinda iffy about this brew, but, rest assured, while the cinnamon flavor absolutely stands out, this still succeeds in tasting like beer; a good, malty beer flavor with the sweetness of bananas and honey. The flavor is balanced, succeeding in incorporating the spices into a cohesive blend. It has a good, golden color to it. It is a little cloudy. The aroma is slight, with a predictable cinnamon and malt scent. Very little hops present in the flavor, which is fine by me. There was also very little head that went away after less than a minute in my glass. A special beer for occasional drinking, but impressive.","plaidowl","Jan 17, 2015"

The aroma is really nice and consists of cinnamon and some spices. Even more going on with the taste as there is the cinnamon BUT isn't over done at all along with a hint of almonds and some other flavors that are hard to pick out. Almost like a hint of 'Rum Chata' in with the malts. Very smooth and goes down easy (and fast). Lighter+ bodied and perfect carbonation. Great brew for the cooler months and was very surprised on how good this one really is! Great job!","BeerWithMike","Nov 05, 2014"

The flavor reveals more cinnamon, and I think, rice flavor as there's definitely something different from a standard maltiness going on. As the label states, it's subtly sweet, but it remains in balance due to the spiciness of the cinnamon. I'm not sure what the bitterness level is, but it's very low; and there are no hop flavors, although that's to be expected. So what is the yeast giving us? I'm not really sure, all I'm finding is 'maltiness' and cinnamon. Of course, maybe that's all that's really needed; as this is a new style of beer I have to judge it hedonistically anyway, and I'l say I really like it... 4 1/2 out of 5 stars! And what I find so impressive is that the cinnamon doesn't really build on you. It does a little bit, of course, but not nearly as much as say, a pumpkin ale. I think I'm going to try to find a case or two of this. It should make an interesting addition to holiday meals, an easy-going relaxed fall beer, and even a great BBQ beer in the summer. Beyond that I think the food pairings are almost limitless as it gives a little bit of spice and sweetness but it's not overdone. One of the best new beers I've tried in a long time, and certainly the most unique. Kudos!","NeroFiddled","Nov 04, 2014"

It's not great by any stretch, but at least it's bold, and that's maybe all you could ask for in a Blue Moon brew. Having said that, I would dare anyone to try to get though more than 3 of these; the flavor is so rich that sour stomach seems inevitable. Hell, I'm only through half a 12oz bottle and already I'm seeking something to cut the relentless sweet/spice flavor. It's arguably the best beer in this year's fall variety 12 pack, but that's not saying much.  It too has flaws.","TheSixthRing","Sep 25, 2014"
