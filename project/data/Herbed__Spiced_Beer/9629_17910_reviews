"A very good pale wheat ale with a good spiciness to accompany the fruity flavors. A refreshing summer beer."
""
""
""
""
"Label sounded like a delicious summer brew. Could only taste peppercorns. So much peppercorn."

"This beer tastes like the moment you realize Santa Claus isn't real."
"Verdict: Not my favorite beer from Short's at all, almost a Gose blended with a Witbier blended with a pale wheat ale at times, too much going on and perhaps too many adjuncts for such a simple base beer. The base can't stand up for itself amidst the scrum for attention with all the adjuncts and in the end, it's just too wacky and bizarre to work."
"FAVORITE."

"Nicie Spicie is a nice little beer, but it has the potential to be better. While it's likely an ideal choice for those summer long weekends on the lakes of northern Michigan, I can't think of another scenario where I'd reach for this beer (especially not if there's other Short's offerings on the shelf). To reiterate: not bad, but certainly not this brewery's best."

"Light golden colored with a light bit of foam that only covers a quarter of the top of the beer. Lively carbonation bubbles. I get the aroma of coriander and orange peel. The coriander aroma and flavor,while dominant do not overwhelm as some beers are apt to do. Front of the palate is wheat and then you get a burst of orange peel and coriander. Interestingly I get a bit of mild heat from the peppercorns in the aftermath. The mouthfeel is refreshing,but the heat at the end beckons further sips. Not your typical wheat!"
""
""
"Overall this is one you really have to try to see if you like it. I'm still torn. The beer itself is light but the flavor is so bizarre that I'm having trouble doing more than sip it. And yet, at the same time I can't say that I don't like it. I think this is the type of thing that requires the right kind of food pairing to fully enjoy. Once again Short's has done something totally strange."

"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 6/13/2013. Pours very hazy bright golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, peppercorn, coriander, wheat, bread, herbal, floral, and earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of malt and spice notes; with solid strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, wheat, peppercorn, coriander, bread, floral, and herbal earthiness. Lingering notes of citrus zest, wheat, peppercorn, coriander, bread, and herbal earthiness on the finish; with some peppercorn heat building up as well. Nice and pleasant balance of malt and spice flavors; with solid robustness and no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, smooth, and moderately crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a solid spiced wheat ale. Solid robustness and good balance of malt and spice flavors; and very smooth to drink. An enjoyable offering."

"While creamy and crisp in a soft but about medium body, there is a little slickness in the back of the mouth."

"Give Shorts credit for something unusual and creative. Might appeal to those who like spicy spicy and more spicy. But for me it was not nicie."

"Fantastic beer. Wheat-colored, light-bodied and bubbly. The peppercorn flavor is prominent but not overly intense. Wonderful aftertaste. I usually don't like spiced wheat beers and I really dig this guy. Highly recommended. I'm on my second as I write this review and I feel number three on the way."

"As always, Shorts is trying something out-of-the-box, which I love. This is one of the few that miss the mark for me... Surprising, since I enjoy the peppercorn additions in Anniversary Ale. It was just a touch overdone in this brew. I'd like to give the next batch a go, and perhaps the balance will be there."

"Little to no head on a hazy golden with slight orange tinge body. Aroma is a little pungent with grains, honey and light lemon custard. Flavor is a little spicy with quite a bit of honey, lemongrass and maybe some ginger on a grainy base. Light to medium body and moderate carbonation. I was hoping this to be spicier. The sweetness isnt very well balanced and it feels too syrupy."

"Well, We have a nice peppercorn wheat that I enjoyed."
"This is one strange yet tasty beer by Short's. I should also note this is the first Short's I've ever had. It essentially tastes like a tea with pepper in it to me, which isn't a bad thing. It's just very unusual. I'm not sure I'd drink this too often... I see it as more of a novelty. I'd still get it again in the future just because it's so strangely compelling."
"Overall - the peppercorn lingers on the tongue along with the lemon zest. Very well balanced and a pleasure to drink."
""
""
""

""

"The nose had me very worried on this one as it was so much orange zest. Thankfully, it did settle down a bit. Unfortunately, it settled down to an orange tang thing, The flavor is a wad of crap and spices. At least that was my first impression. Then it seems like it starts to work. Then it seems like an obnoxious contrast. I'm ready to move on here."
""
""
""
"M - Light to medium body with a slight chew. Moderate carbonation."
"O- This was definitely an interesting beer. It was definitely very different then anything I'm used to. Lots of interesting flavors that makes for a fairly complex beer. While it was interesting to try, I didn't particularly like a lot of the flavors going on. It was a little bit too spicey and I didn't really care for the pepper or leafy mint flavors going on. I would maybe recommend trying this beer if you like interesting beers, otherwise I probably wouldn't."
"This beer is incredibly good - my first shorts and now I have to drink everything they brew. The flavors are so powerful and bold, and yet the beer is unbelievably smooth and easy to drink. The lingering spice is shorts way of saying ""don't you ever forget what we are all about."" outstanding!"
""
""
""
"Overall impression: A lovely spiced beer. I'm not a fan of spiced beer but this is light and refreshing with hints of spice that provide lovely accents while not killing your palate. A winner from Short's!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Excellent beer all around. Reminds me of a saison but with more pepperiness. Will be requesting my local store to stock some."
""
""
"O: I need more of this ASAP. Damn. Massive pepper nose and massive orange taste. The brain plays tricks on you and mixes both aspects of the beer beautifully. This has to be my biggest surprise of 2012 so far. I'm seriously loving this beer."
""
""
"I thought that this was an incredibly refreshing brew. The light body seems like it would make it easy to knock back a few bottles, but I could see the spice from the peppercorn making it a little hard to session. Perfect for a hot sumer day."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"This one seems to be fashioned haphazardly. Not terrible, but I'm alright leaving it at one."
""
""
"OVERALL - i thought this beer was great. im not really a fan of american style wheat beers. not even in these summer months do i find them all that refreshing. that said, the spicy additions with this beer really round out what can already be considered an interesting and refreshing style. also, the resulting burps are phenomenal."
""
""
""
"Overall, not a bad beer, and I love the pepper, but it might be just too much if you were looking to drink a few of these. But again, its what makes this different than the normal wit, plus its memorable. Worth a shot if you have a chanc to try it."

"Would not seek out this beer in any way shape or form in the future. I would imagine the only likelihood of me drinking again would be on a hot summers day as I guess it has 'refreshment' potential in such conditions, but someone would have to give me a bottle!"
""
"330ml bottle.Tulip glass.Enjoyed on may´11.Golden color.Clear appearance.Brief crown, white in color.Mildy malty,orange zest & subtle peppery aromas.Dry bitter & lemony at first sip.Orange & slightly sweet fruit flavor.Light body,low carbonation.Coriander & hoppy bitterness on the aftertaste.Well balanced beer but quite bland eventhough."
"Overall I looked to this beer as a Voodoo ""White Magic of the Sun"" with a more sessionable ABV and I was right. Flavors are just as good as the Voodoo beer if not better since its not as yeasty. Good beer overall."
"While I didn’t find this super complex or anything, I did really appreciate the super refreshing and easy drinking feel here from that combination of wheat, fruit, and complimentary spices. I’d go for another bottle of this."
"D - Easy to drink but don't think I would want a lot of this just because it's not my style and like I said before I thought there would be more spices. Glad I got to try but wouldn't buy a whole six pack of this would just put a bottle in a mixed six pack or something like that."
""
""
""
""
""
"Sorry babe."
""
""
"All in all, it's a very interested and unique take on a wheat; I'm glad I got to try it and can definitely see enjoying this quite a bit with a caprese salad on a hot summer day (we're having a freak warm day, which is one of the reasons I opened this up)."
"12oz bottle to NBB globe glass. The beer pours a hazy yellow gold color with a nice 2 finger white head. Good retention. Some lacing. Interesting blend of spices on the nose: coriander, lemons, citrus, and a lot of pepper. The flavor follows suit with a good amount of lemon on the front end. As the beer develops the spices come through and dominate, especially the pepper flavor. A mix of citrus, clove, all spice flavors along with a mild bitterness. A mild malt bill of what seems to be wheat and toasted barley provide a decent background. Spices linger on the tongue. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, a bit too much pepper for my liking as I feel it dominates the flavor and aroma. If that were toned down this could be a very drinkable beer."
""
""

"weird brew. pours a lovely golden color with a moderate haze to it and a quickly fading white head, bits of lace on te glass. smells a little sour, almost like a brett beer, but notes of herbs and citrus override the sour. middle malt undertones. tastes like excellent cannabis, tangy and zesty, tangerine notes, still some sour in the finish.a very very light peppery, flavor too, really nice in the finish. this one is growing on me. mouthfeel really transitory, first sour, then orange grove, then steak au poivre, then belgianish yeast. really nice, not delicate but less than sturdy. good carbonation. i like this one a lot, much better than the other shorts offerings ive tasted. nightcap supreme"
"D - Very drinkable. Interesting mix of flavors but they seem to work together very nicely. I like the tartness of the lemon flavor."
""
"Overall, I didn't care for this. It tasted more like something I should clean my house with instead of beer."
""
""
""
""
"Pours a super clear golden hue with very little head. Nice spicy aroma that fills the nose. Really spicy and wheaty smell. Very interesting in the taste department. A little overly peppery I'd say, it kind of takes over the whole beer. A fair bit of sweetness and citrus, but only mildly noticeable with the pepper. Very thin and disappears pretty fast. Very interesting, but overall not the best."
""
"M/O - Dry and smooth. Not bad for what it is (a wheat, spice beer). But I wasn't a very big fan."
""
""
""
"O: I wish it had a bit more to back up the spices, but this is a very nice summer beer (drank in the middle of winter)."

"O - As the name implies, this is a spicy beer. There is a lot going on in the taste of this beer. The more I drink it the more the different ingredients become apparent."
""
"O – Drinkability was better than I expected and I’m wanting another, oddly enough I can see me craving this in winter or summer, mild heat lingers (and grows?) after each drink, as advertised a tasty wheat citrus peppercorn brew 4"
"Strong home-brew flavors of yeast and malted grain. Strangely dry, almost astringent. Strong coriander and lemon zest flavors in the swallow. The aftertaste is brief. The body is what one would expect."
"I’m a big fan of Short’s Brewing Company. Nicie Spicie is far from their best beer, but it isn’t bad at all. If it has any faults, it’s a bit too spicy and herbal. This is definitely a case where less would be more. It’s still a refreshing, enjoyable beer. Definitely worth checking out."
"Overall kinda meh, spices are not really up my alley, not quite a beer I'm for or drinking usually. I'm all for experiment but this isn't quite what I was hoping. Semi sweet, yeasty, lots of spices and citrus, the spices make it feel like a 10% beer despite its actually half that."
"mouthfeel - very drinkable and light, good carbonation, wonderful spicing that makes me sad i dont get this year around for pairing"
"M: The pepper is strong, freshly ground rather than the cayenne blast of, say, Pepper Spite. Because the peppercorns take a break, disappearing briefly midsip, they never get too strong."
"The guys over at Short’s really are a special bunch of creative minds."
"O: Just too much cleaning solution."
"O: Underrated beer, in my opinion. It's not some amazing RIS or anything but it is very unique and I like all aspects of it."
"O - What a nicie surprise! Tried at GABF and randomly found locally in a 6-pack! Perfect brew for a hot spicie day! Wonderful. Awesome work Shorts!"
"A wildly unusual and interesting beer to enjoy. Seek this one out if you're into the style."
"Orange zest is prominent here. Lemon is next. There's a bit of rind in there, like they cut too deep in the orange skin and got the white part. Kind of like tannin without the pucker. Peppercorn is absent, too bad. I would like to see more carbonation to lift up the zests, because they seem syrupy to me on the end. I think that would have helped big time imho."
"Picked this up in a mixed sixer from Mondo Vino along with other Short's brews. Golden yellow color, looks just fine. Smell is really heavy spices to the point where I don't want to drink it. Perfume-like almost, just obnoxious. The flavor is like drinking potpurri and shampoo, just way too heavy on the spices. If I had bought a sixer of this I would have returned it."
"M -"
"It sounds weird but it is like peppered citrus ""ade", and it somehow works nicely. Good fruit and spice use, skeptical after a sniff but satisfied after a sip."
"O: A decent spin on a wheat beer. Spices and lemon complement the beer nicely, much more so than I expected they would."
"O: A nice spiced wheat, would like to see a bit more spice, but very well balanced. The aroma is the showcase of the beer."
"O: Lovely complex beer that combines lemon and pepper. 4.5"
"drink."
"Overall: A ton of flavor in this beer. Like I said before, the combination of flavors comes dangerously close to a cleaning solvent, but I think it works as is. I would have another."
"my least favorite Shorts beer so far. just not for me. Not sure Ill be getting this one again."
"Overall - It's not a bad beer. You have to like lemony, spicy type flavors to enjoy this."
"Notes: Not sure what to make of it. Flavors are OK, and I can ride them, not sure if one is not into the peppery-coriander edge to such an extreme one would really enjoy or love this one."
"A refreshing and unusual beer which employs a playful relationship between bitter and sweet tastes."
"Great carbonation and the wheat give this an excellent body and mouthfeel. It tastes as bright as it smells. Reading the bottle led me to believe this would be more a winter warmer type but this reminds me more of a nice refreshing day drink in the sun. While a great beer, can the Hoegaarden, I'll take one of these."
"Overall: I really enjoy this beer along with most of the other beers Short's has put out. It quickly became one of my go to beers for just relaxing outside this summer."
"O: An interesting beer, wouldn't expect anything different from Shorts. Wish the aroma was more balanced like the flavor profile was. The peppercorns were just a bit overpowering."
"O - Sat down and had two wheat beers this evening, and I favored this one over the other. Great wheat beer overall."
"Overall this beer is just ok for me. Love the start, but really don't like that peppercorn finish. I really appreciate Shorts though because they try a lot of different stuff than other brewers do. Not sure how much of this beer I could have though. Definitely worth trying once though."
"Picked up a bottle yesterday, overall this is a summer beer all the way, very much like Oberon. Smells of lemon, orange, a bit of floral note, and yes the pepper is there as well. Taste the orange and lemon right off the first sip, finished by zest and spice, mostly peppercorn and more lemon. Feels similar to Oberon in the mouth and tastes much like it, more lemon kick in this beer though. This is a bomb beer, most of the Shorts I have had to date (5 or so) have been decent, this is one of my favorites thus far! Pick some up if you see it, if you dig Oberon in the high sun by the lake, this beer will work for you!"
"Overall - A pretty good example of a spiced brew... not something you would want too much of but well worth a try..."
"Quite a good spin on the classic witbier. This is worthy of summertime drinking."
"I'm giving this an above average overall although all my other scores are just at average because this one has a lot of potential. A very easy drinking beer if only the peppercorns would fade out a bit. An offering that just had one too many ingredients in my opinion."
"This was a pretty fun beer and the flavor is interesting."
"D - A very well done beer by Shorts. I'm usually not a fan of so much pepper as a spice in my brew, but the sweetness of the citrus seems to tame that a bit. Very nice...glad my friends thought of me and brought this to me. A certain recommendation to my other friends."
"Overall, it's not my thing. I still love Short's for trying it. Such an interesting brew and one of those things you just have to try."
"O: I had a really hard time with the beer, it’s really not bad, it’s just different. If you’re looking for something out of the ordinary it’s worth a try, but don’t look for something amazing because to me… this just isn’t it. However I must say this is a beer that is unforgettable."
"Overall this was a surprisingly light, yet refreshing, beer.  I'd love a 6 pack of this!"
"O- One of the most interesting beers I've tried in recent memory. The smell was pretty complex, but the spice level prevented me from being able to drink more than a small pour of this. Glad I tried it, but not really my kind of brew."
"Lighter medium body, smooth on the tongue, refreshing and slick. Super drinkable, nice citrus flavor, and they managed to not go completely crazy with the peppercorns (even though this is Short's)."
"M./O. The mouthfeel is a light to medium body beer that is easy drinking, but leaves a dryness in the mouth. A nice summer beer when in the mood for something spicy."
"This beer is an oddity for sure, but I kinda like it (in small doses). I'd try it again."
"O: I totally understand why someone wouldn't like this brew. To me though, I dug the pepper, the hop profile, the bubbles,... just about everything about it. Nice."
"Here we go, beer is thin and very spicy, peppery, lots of floral flavors and a dry finish. This is a very strong gruit ale. Interesting, but I couldn't drink much of it."
"O-pleasantly suprised with this beer. I would definetly buy this again"
"Overall: Very odd beer, random spice flavors and no integration. I wish they would make one good beer instead of 50 random bad ones."
"D- this beer is real crisp and refreshing but still has the amount of flavor you've come to expect from Shorts. the wheat is perfectly complemented by the citrus and spice's."
"The CPJ"
"D- The drinkability of this beer is good. A nice summertime beer that is a little spice forward but still not over the top. The ABV isn't too high which means a sixer can be easy to drink."
"Very drinkable, even with the spiciness."
"Unfortunately, the ""drinkability"" is probably its most generous characteristic as I've certainly had better efforts among wheat ales, fruit beers, and from Shorts in particular. While this may have been due to a slightly aged bottle, this one was a bit of a disappointment."
"D- Other than Shorts IPA's this one is really doing it for me. I like it."
"D: it gets a little easier to drink after a while, when my palate gets used to the peppercorns. pretty enjoyable."
"Drink is quite good. I'd like to have this brewery available to me all the time."
"The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it was an interesting beer for sure. The peppercorns went together with the citrus better then I thought they would. It was pretty refreshing as well, the citrus especially tasted fresh and bright. Pretty good beer overall."
"drinkable - very."
"D: Flavorful, goes down ok, not too filling, mild kick, decent representation of style, this beer is exactly what it claims to but there are several others like it that are better."
"Medium body and extremely tasty, easily in the top 3 from Shorts for me."
"Drinkability is pretty good. This is a refreshing beer, and would be pretty nice in the summer. I've enjoyed the Shorts beers I've tried so far except this one. I expected more flavor, this turned out to be kind of blah, with quite a few flaws. Not a bad beer, but not all that great either."
"Drinkability - From the name of the beer I was expecting something a bit crazier. After reading the description I realized this might be an enjoyable beer. After now drinking the beer, I can definitely say this IS an enjoyable beer. Granted I don't think I'd put a six pack down of these, but I'll be damned this is a tasty beer that is extremely quaffable. Short's has done it again. Great beer."
"D - The drinkability is pretty good. It goes down real easy, and it is pretty refreshing. This isn't usually the style of beer that I drink, but I think overall it's a pretty good beer. I probably wouldn't seek it out, but I'd drink it again."
"D: Good, I'd probably order again, but I would not buy a sixer."
"Drinkability is okay. Not what I was expecting. Very strange beer. Hard to even describe it as a beer. Not sure I would seek this out again. Would not drink if this was the only beer on tap. Not that special."
"D: Is Nicie easy to drink? Yes. But it interesting enough to explore more? For my tastes, probably not."
"decent. A decent tasting beer, not really great. Alcohol is low but Short's brews are hard to come by in Indiana. Light bodied makes it easy to drink."
"D- Great. The fruit and spice kind of land this beer between an American Wheat Ale (as described on the bottle) and a Saison. It reminds me a lot of a homebrew I've done a couple times based off of a Randy Mosher recipe for a Saison where I combine orange and grapefruit with grains of paradise. A good switch-up from a traditional APWA. Pleasantly surprised (as I took from the name that it might be more of a fall/winter spiced beer)."
"overall this was beyond solid and something i was thrilled to be able to drink last night. hogged this whole bottle to myself."
"D_Easily a good session beer. Perfect in hot weather."
"Pours a medium brown with an off white head. Smell is initially quite odd; there's just so much going on and I'm not sure it really all fits together that well. The spices are together a nice touch, but I think the peppercorns get to be a bit of overkill. The hops are nice, though, and lend a nice touch in the flavor as well. The spices are a bit excessive there, and I find the pepper to be distracting (not nearly as good as it was in the Anniversary Ale 2009). Mouthfeel is a bit dry and spicy, and drinkability is really affected by all these factors."
"Overall this was a good enough beer but all of the flavors seemed somewhat muted. Not worth seeking out but not worth avoiding either."
"I do enjoy this beer though it is not my favorite style. The flavors work well and are generally enjoyable. It would not be hard to enjoy a few of these in a sitting, though would not be my first choice. Personal preference aside, Nicie Spicie is a very well crafted beer."
"Well. This is a one-and-done for me. Appropriate to Christmas time, perhaps this should be repackaged as one of the hundreds of YuleTime brews that seem to appear each year in Nov-Dec. This beer, well, I'm not a fan. The spicing is harsh & biting, where I prefer subtlety, & the wheat beer underneath is just about completely lost in the madness. Worth a try, but doesn't rise above the pack of spiced beers on steroids."
"D - A very drinkable spiced ale."
"Nicie Spicie is a beer that is very polarizing, and I am wrestling with the drinkability score. This is a beer that, for me at least, is good on certain occasions but not all the time, and even when it is good I am not sure I could have more than one or two. That being said, it is a very creative brew from a very creative brewer."
"D: Not as good of drinkability as your average wheat beer. I would rather have something else if I was in the mood for a wheat beer on a hot summer day."
"I can't specifically place any of the spices in this one. There are some unusual flavors and spices, but nothing I'd call overly good. Very little foam and quite an empty mouthfeel. Lots of other beers would make me pass this one by for a casual drink."
"D- Not my thing. I finished one, mostly because I didn't want to waste it; there are sober kids in India."
"Overall i i thought this was a very different and well done beer that i hope to get another six pack of before they are gone. keep up the good work shorts, you guys are on another level."
"A cloudy straw yellow with a faint almost nonexistent head. A thin creamy layer of sediment lays across the bottom of the bottle. The sent is very citrus backed by hop tang. The coriander comes out in the taste, which is very palatable and clean for all the spice and citrus flavors. As all the other Short's I have tried this has such a clean feel. Cheers!"
"Overall another unique and focused concoction from the mad minds of Short's. It was very satisfying on this 78F breezy summer afternoon. Definitely one to try before you knock it. I'm glad I did."
"I'm really amazed at the rate that Shorts is putting out more beers into bottled production. This is another of their best."
"D-It is drinkable but I think you have to be a fan of these paired up flavors. I would classify this as a fairly good change of pace type of beer."
"Pours out to a lightly hazy, but not cloudy, medium golden with orange accents, forming a small white head despite a vigorous pour, with poor retention and minimal lacing. Mild to moderate carbonation. The aroma is quite good, but not as potent as the top offering, with orange and pepper, pale malts, malt husk, coriander, and what smells like the Oberon yeast strain (Wyeast American Ale?). The mouthfeel is very smooth, with an invigorating peppery bite, which I absolutely love. The taste opens with a smooth pale malt backbone with a well balanced sweetness riding atop orange, coriander and pepper. I don't really pick up on the lemon zest. The finish is quenching and just makes you want to drink more. This is an amazingly sessionable beer. I could easily put six of these away. Highly recommended, but even more delicious on tap."
"D- The taste and smell didn't really do it for me. This isn't a horrible beer by any means, and I think they accomplished what they wanted to, but it doesn't really work for me. I wouldn't buy this again."
"Overall, peppery, spicy and certainly refreshing. Would be a nice match for a zesty Italian or Greek salad."
"Soft wheat and fruity yeast up front. Citrus and spice come on strong mid-palate. Clove and coriander play off of fresh lemon and grapefruit zest. The acidity of the citrus works nicely with the soft, bready wheat. I'm not crazy about the coriander though. Also a bit of pepper in the finish that doesn't help much. Very grapefruity (but not bitter) in the finish. Medium body with a sparkling feel. Not bad, but definitely not my favorite Short's brew."
"I liked this more as it warmed up slightly, but it's still not one of my favorite Short's offerings. I think it would suit my palate better if the coriander was dialed back a bit. Nice beer, however, and one I wouldn't mind revisiting again in the future."
"Overall, not my favorite beer from Short's but try it if you can."
"D - Great flavor. Easy to drink."
"D- Unique to say the least. I would not want more than one of these, but it is worth a try."
"Pours a slightly hazy, golden color. 1/5 inch head of a white color. Slight retention and slight lacing. Smells of black pepper, slight yeast, slight sweet malt, and a hint of hop. The pepper dominates. Fits the style of a Herbed / Spiced beer. Mouth feel is sharp and crisp with an average carbonation level. There is also a noticeable dryness. Tastes of pepper, slight yeast, slight sweet malt, and hint of hops. Overall, the pepper dominates all other flavors, but I've never had a pepper flavored beer before. Interesting, but I don't know if I could drink very many."
"Taste follows nicely, with the mouthfeel a bit light. Overall a great refreshing summer drinker, reminds me of one of my favorites from Furthermore, Knot Stock, but even more complex."
"Taste is a mix of spices dominated by peppercorns. Some coriander and citrus are also prevalent. Slightly bitter, but very clean and refreshing. Finish is all pepper."
"Enjoyed at the brewpub on tap. Peppercorn, corriander, lemon, oranhe, spiced wheat. Medium mouthfeel. Light colour and very lacey. Served closer to room temperature and drinkable. From this spicy beer, this is above average for the style. Nicely done although I would not drink this every day."
"Pours a hazy orange color with a small head and minimal lacing. The smell is dominated by the pepercorns, followed by citrusy flavors. The taste begins with the spicy pepercorns and is followed by ginger and a nice spicy burn. The mouthfeel has a medium body. This beer is easy to quaff and the pepercorn is done just right. Short's also uses pepercorns in their anniversary ale which makes for a interesting and spicy brew in both cases."
"Pretty amazing stuff here, extreme all the way. I dig peppercorn and it works in the beer so it does stay drinkable for me. This beer must be amazing to cook with as well."
"Orange, coriander, and a peppery finish all blend together with a zesty refreshing drink. Very complex how they fit all that fruity refreshing drink into one spicey, bite the tongue finish."
"I'm sure this beer isn't for everyone but it wins me over because of its uniqueness."
"Medium bodied and very refreshing, spicy and drinkable. No beer has ever matched pizza quite so well."
"Sampled on draught @ Shorts Brewing Company in Bellaire, Michigan. Lightly cloudy yellow color. Heavily spiced aroma, overly so, with the lemon peel and curacao standing out most, along with a light citrusy hop fragrance. Flavor is again, overly spice, with the curacao and lemon peel standing out the most in the flavor. No malt complexity with little hop and nothing but spice."
"On tap at Ashley's in Ann Arbor,I saw the description of this beer and thought it interesting and gav it a try.Poured a very pale yellow with smaller white head, a wheat ale spiced with peppercorns and that is for sure aromas of lemond rind and heavy on the cracked black pepper.I found it a bit watery so it lost my attention after a few drinks,very zesty upfront with big lemon and coriander notes with that black pepper hitting quite hard thru the finish and lingering.A very interesting beer in concept just not my thing I suppose."
"On tap at Butch's Dry Dock in Holland, Mich."
" Long, hot finish, medium body, unique and memorable. I've yet to encounter a beer quite like this, and congrats to Short's for coming up with something so bold, yet easily drinkable! (I've had a few that go the other way, making even one pint a chore.)"
"A refreshing beer. Pours out to a dark yellow in the glass with a slight head. Aroma is that of Lemon Pledge (no kidding) and citrus in general. There is a slight spice to this one that combines with the citrus to bring forth a really easy-to-drink beer. Well done."
"Alternating in strength, lemon and pepper dominate the nose. Almost painfully lively, there's true black pepper kick to this, aromatically speaking. Exceedingly peppery, to be sure. The more I drank this, the more it reminded me of the crust I apply to a tuna dish I make -- bits of chili powder with pepper, cumin, and coriander. And then the citrus sauce gets laid down on the tuna -- here, in this beer, it's lemon. I couldn't put my finger on it originally, but I had some sort of strange lemon drink once that was excessively carbonated. The peppery pricks, carbonation, and lemon are leading me back to that foggy memory. Intense beer."
"The 2nd issue I have is that after you drink this beer its hard to taste other beers and give them your undivided palate. Pepperiness is so strong it lingers for a significant length of time."
"A very unique beer that I would drink regularly if available. Watch for any of Joe Short's creations, he has brewed some of the best beers I've sampled in the past few years. His Machu Picchu IPA (sampled at the RAF 2003 and Jackson 5 IPA (ABR 2001) rivaled any other IPA's on the market."
