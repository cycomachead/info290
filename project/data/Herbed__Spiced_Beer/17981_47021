Spices are subdued in the aroma and it is more fruit than anything else. Spices dominate flavor though, with a cinnamon plum nutmeg combo. Medium mouthfeel and pretty smooth. Finishes slightly dirty. About what I expected, a bit bland, and not something I will have again. Just can't get into the studf with cinnamon/nutmeg overpowering the flavor. They did what they wanted here, but I would have preferred a seeeter brew with lots of fruit.","BMMillsy","Sep 12, 2013"

4,15.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Hazy chestnut brown pour with reddish-purple hues, topped with a small but dense cap of foamy white head that receded to a thick ringlet and left nice lacing on the glass. Aroma is malty and nutty, full of ripe fruit and light spice. Taste of fresh fruitcake, candied plums and apricots, sweet bready malts, cinnamon and nutmeg. Lots of sweet elements, yet overall the beer was not cloying or sickeningly sweet; there was a good balance. Smooth mouthfeel, medium body, but fuller--and much tastier--than your average brown ale. Liked this one a lot, and picked up a bottle to take home.","Rifugium","Dec 31, 2012"

4,15.3,4,4,4,4,4,"Pours a hazy dark garnet color with two fingers of dense cream colored foam. Settles to a thin ring leaving a few lines of lace on the glass. Smell: spice bouquet for reals - ground ginger and cinnamon and some floral notes. Base is toast, almond, with caramel and dark fruit notes. Taste: black plum and brown sugar are buried under orange, ginger, and powdery cinnamon. Toasted nutty finish. Creamy feel but with maybe a little too aggressive carbonation for a laid back holiday beer. Nuts and spices work together, yep. Bottled Nov 14 2011.","babaracas","Jan 31, 2012"

Tasting the beer is no different from the smell, there is incredible winter spices that mix with a sweet brown ale body. This is definitely a cookie in a bottle and it doesis nice job with balance. This beer is quite seasonal and tasty, but just too damn hard to get ahold of!","ThePorterSorter","Jan 25, 2012"

The only thing is, I wish the dark fruit flavors made more of an impact in the flavor. I would love a bigger plum presence like I was expecting. I definitely enjoyed this one though, and I think it is worth trying out.","JizackFH","Jan 22, 2012"

I could not have been more disappointed in it -- it's utterly lacking in body, like a Bud Light hit up with all the spices in the world. More than anything, it just doesn't taste finished. It's possible that with another several months in bottle it would improve (if it was bottle conditioned, I can't remember) the way premature home brew does. But I wouldn't count on it.","drgarage","Jan 11, 2012"

4.47,28.8,4,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,"The mouthfeel is on the thinner side of medium bodied and just a little bit prickly. This one drinks easily, especially considering the slog some spiced brews can be. Harpoon Winter Warmer take note: THIS is how you do a heavily spiced winter seasonal. I was a bit apprehensive going into this one, but it turns out this is a very enjoyable brew. Highly recommended.","shand","Dec 19, 2011"
3.04,-12.4,4,2.5,3,4,3,"O: Way too many spices used for a 6% English Brown base. A higher octane Brown or more subtle spicing would vastly improve this beer. This one is on the verge of cloying and quite a disappointment.","justintcoons","Dec 12, 2011"

2.61,-24.8,2.5,4,2,2,2.5,"O- Unfortunately this was disappointing. I think the base brown ale didn't have enough substance behind it to support the additions they tried to pull off.

2.14,-38.3,4,2.5,1.5,2,2.5,"Medium bodied with a blast of harsh, peppery spices that overwhelm the palate and overtake all of the other flavors. Tons of ginger, cinnamon, pepper and other spices kill the dark fruit and toasted malt notes that are hard to pick up. This beer is a mess with just too much going on at once. I'm glad that I split it with a bunch of friends because I had trouble finishing a few ounces.","corby112","Beers"
