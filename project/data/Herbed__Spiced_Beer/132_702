A nice balance between hops and malt, in stark contrast to some of the hop-bombs I've had recently, and the juniper adds a nice twist. The rogue in me thanks you.","interzen","Dec 16, 2014"

Don't pick up much of the juniper in the aroma. Taste is of a nice, hoppy pale ale, with a light touch of the juniper, not too much. Overall, I might not know the juniper was in there unless you told me. Overall, though, a good pale ale, balanced well and feeling good on the palate. Light aftertatste, pretty clean finish..","hophugger","Dec 14, 2014"

3.68,2.2,4,3.5,3.5,4,4,"12 ounce bottle into signature pint glass, no bottle dating. Pours moderately hazy golden amber color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty foamy lacing clings down the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of orange zest, lemon zest, juniper berry, floral, grass, honey, biscuit, cracker, and floral earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance of hop, malt, and juniper berry notes; with solid strength. Taste of orange zest, lemon zest, juniper berry, floral, grass, honey, biscuit, cracker, light pine, and floral earthiness. Slight floral/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/orange zest, juniper berry, floral, grass, honey, cracker, biscuit, and floral earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Nice balance and robustness of hop, malt, and juniper berry flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and slightly crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a nice pale ale. Good balance of hop, malt, and juniper berry flavors; and very smooth to drink. A nicely enjoyable offering.","superspak","Feb 11, 2014"

In the aroma I could pick up sweet maltiness, a spray of citrus and a little bit of the juniper. After a taste, I get sweet bread out of this, and European hop bitterness. The finish comes off as herbal and is where one mostly tastes the juniper. It's very subtle, I wish it was more dominant. This beer is primarily an APA, and there are better ones out there. Still worth a try if you want a dash of something different in the mix.","Neorebel","Jun 24, 2013"

It’s nothing extraordinary to a seasoned craft palette – it’s got some flavor, but it’s got a slight underlying taste that falls in line with something that tastes similar to a domestic. It’s got better flavor and hoppiness to it though, which shouldn’t come off too strong for a newbie palette. Would definitely be a good lawn-mowing beer on a hot summer day when you need something crisp and refreshing. Good session beer.","tastymug","Apr 23, 2013"

American malted barley and west coast hops in lower dose for the style. the flavor is balanced, but more malty than hoppy I think, a touch of toasted grain bread to it, and the juniper comes in at the end with a fresh pine medicinal vibe. its not out of place really, just sort of a funny addition. I much prefer the john john for juniper, although I didn't love that beer either. bright carbonation and a drinkably medium body, if it wasn't so funny in the stomach id have several. not my favorite thing from rogue, but I certainly appreciate the attempt.","StonedTrippin","Apr 11, 2013"

This keeps things lively and drinking easily to the last sip, especially when coupled with the soft feel. The nose was comparatively weak, with adjuncts and corn ringing heavily. This is a nice, refreshing beverage, but we do wish that the fruitiness was just a bit more prominent.","TheBrewo","Feb 08, 2013"

I get the hops, but beyond that.... not much. It's also so dry that I can't really get much- the flavors evaporate off your tongue so fast I can't identify them.

On the nose there are a few malts, a few hops, and a little grass with a stronger berry element. The body was in the medium range and very comfortable for the style.

A berry bitterness is noticeable throughout the taste and even into the aftertaste, which I have to say is different than I thought it would be. Its bitter like a berry's rind actually, which, never having a juniper berry before, I can only assume is the juniper. Its unique at the very least and I do give it credit for that. Incredibly easy to drink and yet still enjoyable for the complexities of the berries and floral hop combination. The mouthfeel is quick, clean, and dry, lending itself to the style nicely. The hops actually come through more and more throughout the beer, but they never take over. They instead take a seat on the side and let the other flavors do the work, which is a plus for the style. All told, I'm enjoying the easiness and yet thoughfulness in the balance of this one. Didn't know what to expect with this, but I am pleasantly surprised.","chodinheaven","Jun 28, 2011"

The beer pours a cloudy orange-gold color with a sparse, foamy head about half an inch on pour that disappears as I write this. Not sure if I was expecting a nose full of gin smells, but I am pleasantly surprised by the subtle aromas; flowery and a hint of hops. The juniper absolutely comes through on the taste, and actually overpowers any taste of hops. It has a weird dynamic of being flowery and sour at the same time, and that doesn't necessarily blend all that well together. There is also a note of roasted barley somewhere deep down in the taste. The beer is dry and a bit harsh in mouth, with a sour aftertaste. Rough on the finish, this might be a tough bomber to polish off.","GarthDanielson","Jan 10, 2011"

The taste is where things get interesting.. It starts off tasting like a good, mild pale ale but as soon a nice hoppy finish begins the feeling turns much dryer. In turn, the juniper squashes the mellow finish and leaves the beer feeling flat and a little barren. Kind of feels like I chased a decent pale ale with a shot of gin.

The flavor is surprisingly light, I was expecting a more intense hop flavor or for that matter a more intense juniper flavor. It is fairly hoppy, with a good amount of malt in the background. The juniper imparts an evergreen like flavor which is fairly mild (much to my satisfaction, I can't stand gin which juniper is the main flavoring and I was almost dreading this one). Decent, worth a try.","Drew966","Dec 29, 2009"

Has a clean herbal bread and yeast smell with some floral notes, maybe some vinous hints. Very smooth beer that has a very light malt base followed by more herbal quality that cuts through the bitterness as it shows. The juniper is revealed mostly as the grain dissipates. The herbs and hops mix to create a light crisp finish with green grassy flavors lingering. The beer has a light to medium mouthfeel.

Light and sweet with understated hops. The picture of the pine needles on the bottle had led me to expect a piney-hoppy exotic IPA-esque pale ale. This isn't that. It's subtler.

Not too heavy, but the juniper taste seems to linger for a while (at least I'll guess it's juniper as I'm not sure when or where I last had anything with juniper in it).

The head was two fingers of off-white foam that displayed pretty good retention and very consistent bands of lacing. The aroma was a nice balance of citrus and herbal hops along with a notable spiciness and some sweet malt behind that. The flavors were similar, but nothing I was immediately stunned by. The balance was still excellent, but the hop profile, starting on an herbal note which was also reflecting the juniper they used, quickly gave way to more citrusy hops followed by the pale malt that was a little biscuity. It was, however, also sweet enough to offset the hops. Lightly spicy and rather dry but not too acidic. The finish was pleasantly bitter but not biting. The mouthfeel was smooth and clean, the body medium/full and the carbonation excellent. Very, very sessionable. I've got to be honest, though I could quaff this all night I found it unremarkable. It is nether a great APA nor a great Rogue beer, and the juniper berries were so understated you wouldn't know they were in there. Worth a try? Yes. Worth a repeat? No.","thekevlarkid","Feb 17, 2009"

Once on the pallet there is a distinct but by no means overwhelming bite. The taste of the brew has coolly strolled into my personal top five. Casually sweet, with remarkably well balanced malts and hops, this beer delivers an easygoing flavor that is just too good to treat with any insouciance. With a mildly dry and equally mildly bitter aftertaste, one can easily relax and enjoy this beer. Pick it up and enjoy with no regrets.","andrewm190","Aug 03, 2008"

Taste is of some sweet barley malts, good hop profile, some piney-ness, hints of spice and juniper, but nothing out of this world. Dry finish, light carbonation, and pretty easy to drink.

Not quite as much juniper flavor as I had expected though. With the price of beer rising, and this one was five bucks, it was well worth the buy, but only for a try.

The taste starts of with some light spice followed by an average malt backbone well balanced by hops. I pick up some light juniper flavoring at the end, but if I was not looking for it I wouldnt have picked it up.

Not the greatest tasting brew, but it has a fuller citrus flavor from the juniper and there is a nice malt mix to give it a full body.

The smell is citrusy and piney, with some fruity notes that I imagine are the juniper berries. The malt also lends a creaminess and some caramel aromas. The taste offers the same notes as the smell, with more complexity, fruitiness, maltiness, creaminess, caramel, etc. The mouthfeel is medium and fairly full, and the drinkability is very good.

Mellow malt character and ripe fruit start but a bitter astringent hop character moves in that is metallic and then ends with some big pine flavor. As it warms the bitterness lays down and becomes a more apparent juniper spice and toffee malt, spruce, and tart fruit notes get bigger.

There is a little bit of clover honey sweetness in the back but the malt presence is light and dosen't really shine through much. Taste mellows as the beer warms but this is definitely a unique one. Not offensive, just different. Mouthfeel is very drying and light bodied. Not a heavy beer but it's a little sticky. Carbonation is a little bit high in my opinion.

The appearance and mouthfeel were both better than average, but nothing to write home about. The aroma actually contained more juniper than the taste which was mild with a very subtle hint of a gin like flavor. Much like gin, I cannot personally tolerate too much due to the acidity. This limited the drinkability score for me, which holds true, as after one or two pints of Yellow Snow I'd usually switch to something else.

Floral citrus hops lead the flavor with a bit of raw bitterness. There is a lingering spiciness in the finish that has a tingly quality about it and is a bit peppery. No obvious signs of juniper berries. The hops are the main flavor contributor. The finish is a bit drying and the hops linger a short while. Medium-light body with nice, tingly carbonation.

Actually I have realized that it is the combination of the diacetyl and the juniper flavors that have mixed. The two actually form a spicy mix that makes the otherwise objectionable diacetyl all that much more bearable, and actually a positive contributor to this beer.","Gueuzedude","Apr 10, 2006"

A faint hopiness and a little sweetness to the nose. Hop bitterness is mellow and doesn't linger too long. I can't quite tell where the juniper is at, but this has a sweet flavor to it. Something I don't associate with Pale Ales. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy and a little fuller than most beers of this style. This would make a good session beer.

The taste doesn't really hold any of the juniper berry qualities too strongly, if I wasn't really looking for it I might have missed it and dismissed it as hops. I would have liked it a little stronger to really display the juniper flavor.

It poured copper-orange with a large white foamy head, which stuck around. It had the aroma of honey and malts, mild hoppiness, virtually nothing else.The taste was the same, lots of sweetness, malts and mild floral hops and yeasts. It was smooth and crisp, but a bomber of this was almost too much to drink by onesself.

Junipers come out in the finish and last into the aftertaste. I like how the flavors go together in this brew. Mouthfeel was mediumish with good carbonation.

The juniper doesn't do anything for me other than try and be a purposeful off-flavor. Very clean finish and smooth all the way down.

Malty flavor, but not as strong as I expected from the aroma. Strong hop flavor, but it doesn't completely overwhelm the malty sweetness. In fact, this beer has good balance. A little bit of a fruity flavor. Perhaps some juniper flavor, but it could be my imagination. Very much a Rogue beer in flavor. Medium mouthfeel. Good drinkability.

3.88,7.8,4,3.5,4,4,4,"The golden yellow colored pour, out of the 22. oz. bomber labeled Yellow Snow Ale, was attractive due to lots of carbonation and a thin but lasting head. The smell was sweet and perfumey, with a hint of wood. The taste was bready and sweetish, with a mineralized buttery flavor typical of English Pale Ales. Hops were earthy and spicy, and the juniper berry taste was not quite evident until the sediment was poured in. At that point a spruce like bitterness crept in, which I presume was due to the herbs used. Mouthfeel was crisp initially, but became much softer and thicker after the yeast pour. A very sessionable beer far superior in complexity to its other Pale Ale brethren that clock in around 5.2% ABV. For some strange reason, not distributed in Georgia.","rajendra82","Sep 25, 2005"

Pours a very slightly hazy golden color with practically no head. Aroma is balanced, with some citrusy hop flavors and a good amount of malt showing through. Taste is really balanced too, which makes this a good beer to introduce non-BAs into craft beer. The hops I would say are a little more powerful than the malt, with a lemony taste still on my tongue 10 minutes after finishing, but not over powering hop flavor like Hazed and Infused.

Right away the taste reminds me of caramel and citrus fruits, followed by raw honey into a medium bitter finish. The balance, honeyish and citrusy without being overly sweet, goes to its credit in my book. The mouthfeel is interesting. Full, seems almost heavy, coating the mouth, yet it feels alot like soft spring water too. Smooth, soft, somewhat sweet.

There was the faintest taste of alcohol as well. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with medium body and low to moderate carbonation feel. This ale was relatively clean overall. This was a rather nice pale ale with a little something extra.

Palate begins with fruity hops, accented by the juniper berries up front, and becomes a tad bitter towards the back of the mouth. The significant alcohol is evident in the nice and warming finish. Very nice, substantial body makes this a winner. Would rate higher for drinkability if not for the kick. Probably should limit myself to one of these in a session.","ElGordo","Feb 16, 2005"

The middle brings a citrusy flavor along with some yeast notes. Earthyness comes in then a crisp bitter attack hits the palate. This is noticeably a Rogue offering and a good one at that.

Both from the hops as well as from something I discovered later (reading Rogues site) was juniper berries. The taste had more of the citrus character along with a tartness that had to come from the berries. The malt is blended well to provide a balance to the rest of the beer. The tartness and flavor lent by the juniper carries through the entire beer. This had a nice light mouth feel and is very drinkable.

Faint holly bush aroma, likely from the juniper berries. Malty and husky, a light fruitiness and a yeast character that comes across as spicy, mixing well with the light astringency of the hops.

Is tobacco brewed in this beer? Tastes okay. Earthy, tobacco and gin taste mellowed out by a sweet malt character. Mouthfeel is a little too astringent. This was my first beer from Rogue. I was disappointed. It's actually a bit of a bland beer. Personally, I find very little to write about it. Yeah, it was drinkable. But this is one beer I won't be purchasing.

It says juniper, and juniper can be smelled. Suddenly, I am thinking of Christmas for some reason. Nice malt flavor, which seems to be shallow compared to the hops and spices. The hops seem kind of musty, followed by some slight spicyness, and a hint of what I would again call Christmas Tree flavor. Fair amount of carbonation. Overall, this is an interesting brew.

The basic elements are cleverly balanced, and refresh rewardingly, making another a virtual certainty.

Also I am not sure why this is classified as an herbed/spiced beer, since the only extra ingredient is juniper berries although juniper berries could be considered to have a somewhat spicy flavor. There is no actual spice in the beer though. A fruit beer, perhaps? Well, not really. This is essentially a light-ish pale ale with an accented hop bite, and a bitter tartness from the juniper berries which are not at all sweet berries, they're used to make gin remember? A light, clear gold, with average head and lacing. The malts are the high point of the beer, and are generally light and biscuity but there is a roastier, almost chocolatey undercurrent that really appeals to me. A very crisp, clean, appealing taste in which no yeast intrudes, the end result being refreshing if maybe a little one-dimensional. The hops close things out with a tweak of bitterness. Aftertaste is dry and a bit metallic, not particularly good. It's that malt that keeps me intrigued though.","Thrasher","Feb 16, 2004"

I could stand for a bit more malt, but for some reason balance doesn't seem like an issue with this one. I have no clue what juniper tastes like, but it's definitely piney and real damn bitter in a floral, vegetal way. No one else seemed to think this was especially bitter, and I recall being a bit ""meh"" about the bottle when I had it a couple years ago. The tap version was seriously bitter stuff.

Hops are the main event here; very grapefruit-citrusy in flavor, but not too bitter. Finish is a touch oily, bitter, and thirst-quenching. I'd rather drink this in the summer than in the winter.

But the citrus snap comes back, lots of hops, and earthy spiciness to it. Medium bodied, nicely carbonated. Really cleanses the palate, and leaves you dry and puckering, waiting for more.

The aromas that came from the glass were of malt, a slight burnt sugar, faint milk chocolate, spicy and floral hops, juniper berries, caramel and earth tones. The tastes that rolled across the tongue and to the back of the throat were of sweet malts, juniper berries, floral hops (which seemed dominate) yeast, pine trees and some herb tones through out. Some hoppy aftertastes were present. Medium body made this beer pleasant and not overbearing. The flavors seemed to become more pronounced as it warmed.

The taste reveals lightly sweet malt with a well-pronounced hop. It is light bodied and finishes with a slightly dry bitter.

The taste is of spicy and herbal hops which are accentuated by the green piney flavor of juniper. Some light crystal malt comes up in mid palate, peeks in the window, sees all the hops and juniper having a party, and decides it's in the wrong neighborhood. The mouthfeel is light yet a bit creamy. The finish is sharply bitter which I personally enjoy, but I could see where this would turn off others. A tasty brew, imo, but not something I'd want all the time.","johnrobe","Feb 12, 2003"

Crystal clear, and golden in color, this beer sports the typical huge Rogue pillowy head, and leaves a nice lace down the side. The aroma is of floral hops and a bit spicy. Flavor starts off with a smooth malty body which soon develops a pleasant fruitiness from the juniper berries. Slightly acidic with a bit of a hop bite at the end, but a bit of honey sweetness kicks in to make this an incredibly well-balanced beer.

Beginning with slightly sweet toasted malt, then becoming quite spicy and a little bit fruity, finishing quite bitter with some notes of Gin... obviously the juniper berries at work.

Citrusy, floral hop flavor barely edges out the malt. Taste almost seems to bounce back and forth between the malt and the hops. This balance of flavor keeps it interesting.

Very inviting! The flavor starts with a very nice, gently sweet malt that's laced with toasty biscuit and caramel. A creamy mouthfeel enhances the maltiness. The body is deceptive - seemingly fuller than it actually is - and the gentle carbonation is very fine. Hops emerge with both bitterness and flavor (earthy, lightly citrusy, fruity - or is that the juniper?) just prior to the swallow, and the finish is dry with a lingering maltiness and some minor hops notes. Although I cannot distinguish the juniper berries, there is something very distinct about this beer and I can only assume that they are the cause. Quite a unique and charming beer that offers some good malt character (although not alot of complexity), but also retains the Rogue signature hoppiness.

Buttery and lightly toasty malt & caramel sweetness upfront in aroma ensued by lightly citrusy hop nose accompanied by sweetly herbal herbal juniper.  A snap of sharp, perfumy, slightly soapy herbal Juniper flavors quickly yield to assertive hop bitterness that offsets the medium caramel malt sweetness, but leaves the dextrinous body and resulting smooth mouthfeel intact. A combination of earthy and orange like hop flavor emerges along with a resurgent but mellowed pseudosweet Juniper once the initial hop bitterness fades.   Finishes slightly buttery, but otherwise clean and bitter.  Yellow Snow is quite a tasty and enjoyable brew. Although the strong hop bitterness considering the low gravity does throw the balance askew, what else does one expect from Rogue?

Sweet floral hop aromas abound in the nose. Hints of toasted malt and what I'm guessing is the product of juniper berries from the bottle's statement (but I've never had juniper berries, so I wouldn't know). Flavors appear that jump between malty and hoppy as it rolls over your palate, and combine in a well-balanced sweetness. Medium body. Hints of what I again assume is the juniper abound. Later on, a small amount of rind-like flavor appears and leaves a bit of bitterness behind on the edges of your tongue.

Herb flavors are strong, but not overpowering.  They're most notable on the finish, where they blend incredibly well with hop bitterness.  Overall, this is one helluva beer!

Malts are wonderfully combined, this Ale is inherently drinkable.  I could drink this on tap all night on a cool evening.  After the pour tasting, I took a pull right out of the bottle.
