"O- I liked the spicing mix, but more of a malty backbone would brought more of a gingerbread flavor"
"Damn good ginger bread beer, alittle sweet but still good mix a little brown sugar in it too and it's amazing."
"Serving type: bottle"
"Pass this one by..."

"Reminds me of Pumpkin Head. Maybe I missed the ginger."
"I wonder if this would go well with certain types of cuisine? I can't say as I'm not much of a foodie."

"Not bad, overall.  Totally sessionable.  Kind of like a peppery lemon shandy.  Good with sushi, despite not really tasting like ginger."
"This was nice and light."
"Why you make me review, eh?"
"Overall I thought this beer was just ok and I thought it was very average for the style, it had pretty much all the aspects that I expected, but when it came down to it they were almost all lighter than I wanted and in the end I just wanted more out of the flavor of this beer.  This beer didn't have the best drinkability, it was smooth, clean, crisp, not too filling and the taste didn't do a good job of holding my attention, halfway through it and I' already bored of it, one is more than enough for me.  What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, it was nice and it worked well with this beer.  What i liked the least about this beer was the taste, it was just too bland for me.  I wouldn't buy this beer again and I wouldn't recommend it.  All in all I wasn't a fan of this beer, it wasn't bad, but I just thought it was pretty boring and it didn't really have anything that it made it stick out or be memorable.  So far this is one of my least favorite Harpoon beers and I  would say it's average at best for the style.  This beer needs some work, better luck next time guys."
"Overall not a bad beer pretty much just a sweet ginger beer rather than a gingerbread."

"Taste-Straight-ahead gingerbread cookie, a bit light-bodied but nice. Not overdone."

"Sure, this had all of the traits of a session beer but I couldn't see myself having more than one in a sitting. There may have been some wheat in this, which would explain the lack of sharpness in this beer. If so, it only served to confuse me as this didn't seem like something that was herbed or spiced. Worth a go once because of the quasi-uniqueness of it but this almost seemed like a ginger ale with a bit more body and no stickiness from high fructose corn syrup."

"A light beer compared to other gingerbread beers I've had.  Lable says ""gingerbread inspired.""  You definitely get the ginger in the nose and flavor.  It makes me think ""ginger ale"" (as in the soft drink) rather than ""gingerbread," though.  The good news is it's a lot less carbonated and much more smooth in mouth feel than the soft drink.  Not bad.  Glad I tried it."

"An interesting ginger beer for the holidays"

"3.03/5: Easy drinking, but the low ginger could be a good or bad thing depending on perspective"
""
"Feel: light body with light-medium carbonation.   Light effect from the ginger."

"O: The fact that this is unfiltered really kills the overall gingerbread aspect, making it more fruity and yeasty than anything else. It almost tastes more like a shandy than a ginger-based beer, but that could just be me. Not bad, but just missed the mark a little (or a lot, depending on how you look at it). A bit festive, and that's about it. If you're into it, you're into it I guess"

"It's good. I think I drank it too cold. I love the muddy almost blood orange look of it. The smell is a typical pumpkin ale with spice and nutmeg, but then there is a twist in the taste. Think Vernors with alcohol. I liked it. I probably wouldn't get it again, but I'm glad I tried it."
"Tastes like there pumpkin UFO minus the pumpkin and with a touch more ginger. With that said I do like it better then the pumpkin UFO."
"Pretty good gingerbread beer for ufo"

"Not much body or flavor. It is light and fizzy like a very light macro with some ginger flavors mixed in. This one doesn't work for me at all."
"Upon pouring the smell is what threw me off the most.  I couldn't get past the odor of the beer pored into a glass.  I can't really put my finger on it, but it smelled a bit sour or dare I say ""skunked"".  I know I have handled the beer properly, so I am guessing the odor is true. I then noticed the unfiltered orange color which is nice.  The beer is very hazy and bright.  The taste then comes together and makes me understand the beer.  The taste is very light and refreshing, I am just not so sure the unfiltered wheat style really mixes well with the ginger and orange.  I like the idea, but this was a miss for me.  Still drinkable, but I don't think I would be out for seconds."
"the best beer ive had from harpoon."
"DATE TASTED: December 27, 2014... GLASSWARE: Weihenstephan weizen... OCCASION: post-Unbroken, currently immersed in PSU-BC Pinstripe Bowl--not a bad Saturday... APPEARANCE: grungy yellowish-orange murkiness akin to swap water; off-white head dissipates to sporadic lily pads of singular bubbles; ... AROMA: cinnamon, clove and ginger--yes, all accounted for; some sweeter sugars float in the mix, as does a slight medicinal abrasion... PALATE: medium-bodied, rather flat and lingering in its aftertaste; big enough to hold up to a winter's eve; mildly warming...TASTE: definite ginger and clove; flat cookie and a bit of cardboard(?!) solidifies an underwhelming delivery after an enticing aroma... OVERALL: a doughy cookie experience, with some funked malts that make the experience  moderately enjoyable one; as seasonals go, not one that stands out but one that does offer a different aspect in taste and aroma ..."

"Overall:  Not sure what to think of this one.  I like it more than the UFO pumpkin, but they kind to seem to be on par with each other."
"I found this beer exceedingly disappointing. It was nothing near what I expected for what it was selling. No spiciness, no flavour. Flat and dull. If anything it was just straightforward refreshing. The pour was beautiful though."

"Great holiday brew. Warm mouthfeel and a clean finish. Not an overpowering ginger flavor"

"Opened to eat with popcorn.  Fairly pedestrian beer with obvious ginger tones.  Hint of cakey sweetness with a dry finish.  I'll buy winter Warmer by the 12 pack, this one can stay  on the shelf."

"Tastes of gingerbread, fresh ginger and toasted malts. Smell is straight ginger.  A decent average to slightly above average holiday beer.  I might revisit this one."

"The taste highlights the spicy characters rather than the gingerbread but it is there. Mild bitterness to finish."

"I bought this knowing that all harpoon beer has never let me down. Ill be honest that this is the first one that has let me down. The main thing is the soapy taste I get in the finish. I can taste the ginger but not the bready taste. I was expecting more malt and mouth feel from this becuase of the name. The beer is over all great but the soapy taste really turns me off and is the reason for my low score."

"It's not *bad*, but it is disappointing. Very light on the gingerbread and the spices- it's underwhelming. If I'd been served this beer without being told what it was supposed to be, I would never have guessed gingerbread right away."
"On tap at Rattle n Hum, NYC. OK body & overall taste but the ginger seems to be indecisive. I enjoy a ginger beer now & then & when I saw the name I thought there'd be some bready/ther spices on board to take it to a different level. As it is it's OK, but if they took a page from all the pumpkin spiced brews around I think it would benefit."

"Pours a hazy dark yellow, almost brown color with a white head that doesn't trail the glass. The smell is full of gingerbread and holiday spices like nutmeg. The taste was rather heavy with all gingerbread and cinnamon and nutmeg coming through. A little too sweet for me and not enough balance with any hops or malts."

"On tap in Windsor, Vt. Lighter than I expected, with ginger, cinnamon, in background. Not as sweet as the name would imply.  But..probably won't go for seconds"
"Overall, someone just make a good beer this holiday season...I respect their market share and size for a craft brewer therefore I know they can do better than this!"

"Was able to taste this beer early through a friend and I was extremely disappointed. This beer is overpriced, lacking in flavor, and feels very mass produced. Not worth your time."
