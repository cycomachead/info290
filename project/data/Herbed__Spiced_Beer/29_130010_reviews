"This is a very delicious, but not overly filling beer. It tastes just like Cocoa Puffs!"

"I'm not really sure what the difference is being Shockolate Wheat and Chocolate Wheat, pretty sure they're the same beer with a different label since I'm having trouble finding much difference now that I've finished Shockolate.  Same score between the two too, how 'bout that."
"One of my favorite beers. My alltime favorite flavored beer for sure."
""
"The chocolate flavor overwhelmed everything else making it almost drinkable, but I would prefer chocolate milk --- and I like beer."
""
"it is very hard to review this as a beer, as it tastes much more like a chocolate soda"
"Too sweet for my taste"
"Who poured beer in my yoohoo?"
""
"Interesting, not what I expected.  Different, but not unpleasant"
""
"Tastes ok, just too sweet."

"Great tasting beer that is good for a winter treat"

"Not nearly as bad as most would think. Scoff if you must but here's the real skinny (from my perspective) on this.  First off, the pour was average at least with a very nice color to both the beer and the head (opaque and black with brown tinges; head slightly off white) but the head does dissipate rather quickly leaving some, not a lot but some lacing. Nose was full of chocolate more than anything else. Not an overbearing fragrance but not any where near dismissible by any account. Taste followed nose exactly, only giving way to a hint of spice, dash of berries (muted at best but still there as a characteristic of the malt used, I would guess - think ""Baltic Porter"" backbone) and a touch of bitterness. More sweet than bitter and cloyingly so. Usually I would be far more rough on a beer of this depth for being watery thin but I fear that if it had much more body, the additional volume plus sweetness could have made it difficult to finish.  My biggest complaint for this beer (and ultimately what rode the rating down) was the near terminal lack of balance. This was all over the road without actually going into the ditch."

"Overall, it's like a bad German Diesel.  This doesn't even taste like beer and it's a huge disappointment in how it comes out from the nose and appearance.  They made chocolate cola instead.  Drinkable… but so is Diet Coke© apparently for some, so keep that in mind."
""
""
""
"Overall, this is only marginally better than the Shock Top Honey Bourbon Cask Wheat. I'd say drink something else, even a Blue Moon or this for god sakes! I'm feeling like a wasted money on pisss-pour Shock Top beer when I could have bought Rolling Rock or Miller High Life and actually had a more enjoyable time drinking those for less money."
"A light feeling chocolate beer. I thought it was pretty tasty and an interesting option. I had it on draft at a wine & chocolate festival."
"A very smooth chocolate beer without coffee flavors."
""
"Wow. This is just a mess. Horrible flavor.  No malt, as you would expect from a chocolate beer.  Just chocolate and wheat.  But, I can't say that I'm shocked ("
""
""
"great beer considering its SHOCKTOP!!! come on ""outlier"" !!  my only complaint with this one is the mouthfeel is quite a bit too carbonated for my liking and for a dark beer, other than that awesome!"
"Tastes like a hint of a porter but more like its a chocolate soda with low abv. Nice taste."
""
""
"Its not awesome....but its not bad.  Its a lighter beer with chocolate hints in the sent and taste.  Its not overly sweet so it can be sessioned.  This would be a great beer to introduce favored wheats to a novice.  Overall.....not to shabby."
""
"Overall : not incredibly impressive but it is yummy. I'd have it again and again. It is more flavorful and cola-like out of the bottle."
"Very enjoyable!  Smooth & flavorful with an almost sweet stout like character.  Coco puffs, cheerwine & even some grape come through in this sessionable brew.  Very soda like."
""
""
"This beer is a pleasant surprise.  Very good chocolate flavor without being cloying."
"Got a bottle for free at work. This is pretty decent. It does exactly what it says on the tin (bottle?). It's got a lot of chocolate flavor with vanilla notes. I don't think I'll rush out and buy a sixer for home, but I did enjoy the one I had. It's not something I'd drink if I was thinking ""I want a beer", because it doesn't have a lot of beery character to speak of. That, however, does not prevent Shockolate Wheat from being a sweet and tasty treat that is overall satisfying."
"Great chocolate taste up front, a little heavy on the back end."

"O: [3.75] I think it is en vogue to hate on Shock-Top but this is a decent beer.  At 4.3% it delivers a nice flavor and a different spin on a winter beer.  I am partial to chocolate beers so that gives this one a boost.  The nose is a little disappointing (the chocolate doesn't pop on the nose) but the taste has a lot of chocolate and some hints of vanilla too.  I'd proudly recommend this to a friend."
"           Overall, a 4.25 for Shock Top Shockolate Wheat - Anheuser-Busch. This is a great choice to switch it up with flavor that isn't usually brought to the table with much brews. I will most likely purchase this product again."
"Shock Top Shockolate Wheat brewed by  Anheuser-Busch, with an ABV of 4.30%  This brew pours out a nice brown color with a nice off white head. The smell is rich with chocolate. There is also some grains and malts in this brew.  The taste is rich with chocolate, malts, grains. Not to many hops in this brew. I like how this brew is different from most brews on the market today. The mouthfeel is rich with flavor, but it is smooth. Shock Top Shockolate Wheat has a nice balance to it, there is nothing overpowering in this brew.  Overall I'm giving  Shock Top Shockolate Wheat a 4.75 out 5. Anheuser-Busch did a nice job with this one.  I would buy this brew again."

"The Verdict: Not bad. I was expecting something lame and watered down like the Budweiser Project 12 attempts at beer making, but this actually has some flavor."
"Pours a deep chocolate brown. This is what I call a fun beer. Aromas of light chocolate and vanilla extract. Nice taste with the cocoa being the leader and hints of vanilla. Good mouthfeel and a great winter brew !!!"
""
""
""
"Pours really close to a pitch black in color (deep reddish-brown) with a thin beige cap. Looks like a Porter actually. Some spotty lacing is seen when sipped that stuck to the glass. Sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle after the pour. The aroma is of cocoa powder and vanilla. Pretty much is said for the taste with just a hint of wheat. Very smooth to drink and finishes the same way. Medium-bodied with slightly above average carbonation. Overall a good winter seasonal."

"12 oz bottle poured into a glass, dark stoutish color, and a solid smell of cocoa and vanilla, better than expected."
""

"Nice chocolate aroma that follows through in taste. Not much beer flavor, but appropriate for the occasional drinker. I'm a fan."
""
""
""
""
"A lot lighter tasting than I expected. After reading the label I noticed they use artificial sweeteners. Why?"
"Looks like a good beer unfortunately that is as far as it goes. Taste is below average, chocolate flavor is funny tasting, and it is about as watery as it gets."
""
""
"A strange brew indeed. Pours black, opaque, unusual for a wheat beer. Is this a porter? It is not but has the appearance of one. Little head disappears quickly after pour, no lacing. Smells terrific- chocolate and vanilla appealing to my sweet tooth. On to the taste- it is good. A little light and not overpowering. Sweet, sugary, definite dessert quality. Unfortunately, like most Shock Top products that I have encountered, the brew is somewhat empty on the back end. The taste does not linger enough to determine quality. Also- a strange chocolate like syrup collects at the bottom of my glass- weird, yuck. With beers like Southern Tier Choklat and Harpoon Chocolate stout, there are better options available."
""
""
""
"Ignore the naysayers.  This is a rich, dark what ale with lots of soul.  Can definitely taste the chocolate, very subtle though.  Smooth clean and creamy finish."
""
"Poured carefully, the beer produced no head. Nothing. The beer is thin, but determined, with a surprising black appearance. Powdered cocoa and cola sweetness in the nose, with a smoky beef jerky aroma. This is an unusual animal. The flavor imparts cocoa, Jordan almonds, a touch of vanilla extract, and odd hints of teriyaki.  A tart fruity tang blends with ashy burnt malts and an artificial liquid smoke char. The body is medium-thin with lively carbonation. This beer feels a little hollow. It's a curious blend of attributes that is mildly pleasing to the palate, but strange nonetheless. I'm not really sure what they were going for here. This one belongs in the same realm as their Honey Bourbon Cask Wheat. It's just a weird combination of natural and artificial flavors that doesn't manage to produce a coherent result. This one is definitely much better than the aforementioned honey bourbon abortion, but it's a close cousin with a little more class."

"Honestly, best shock top I have ever had. Definitely recommend it."
""
""
"Low quality taste and smell"
""
""
""

"Dark brown body, foamy tan head. Aroma has some faint chocolate and vanilla, smells like stale candy. Flavor has lots of chocolate and vanilla sweetness. Flavors come through pretty well for a light, low abv beer. Medium-high carbonation, thin body. Not bad as an easily approachable desert beer."
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall- I thought it was good, a beer to drink for an occasion and not for a multiple beer event.  a Pleasant surprise"
"Smell was the only redeeming quality of this beer, in my opinion."
"The chocolaty taste was awesome and different. It's definitely a dessert beer."
""
""
"Great holiday dessert beer.  Certainly on the sweet side, but the chocolate and vanilla flavors don't  feel ""cheap""."
"Shock Top Shockolate Wheat -----3.5/5"
""
"I gave it a heavy-handed aggro pour and got three-plus fingers of dense, deep-tan head for my trouble, but with low retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM =44), allowing only meager light penetration at the edges. Nose had a candy-like sweetness that I found off-putting due to my dislike of sugary sweetness. It was sort of a cross between milk chocolate, vanilla and marshmallow. I kept thinking of kid's cereal.  Mouthfeel was thin-to-medium. The taste was godawful sweet! Man, it was so sugary that my heart began pounding after the first sip. It was chocolaty, but in an odd, artificial way. I kept thinking of chocolate marshmallows, like in Count Chocula. Finish was likewise sweet and unrelenting. It was not a taste that I really felt that I needed to have in my later life. I am sure that I am not the intended audience, but this would be better left for someone whose tastes are sweeter than mine."

"great beer very enjoyable  great chocolate taste look great in a glass a ture winner"
"Pours out looking like a Guinness, dark almost black in color, tan head, foamy and thick but without the staying power.  The odor is definitely a mix of chocolate and wheat, and while it works perfectly on the tongue, not so much so in the nose.  Feel-wise, I have to say, this is the smoothest beer I've had in a long time - the darn drink just slips and slides inside your mouth finding its way to your throat real fast.  I am, without a doubt, glad I got the 12-pack of this beer.  Hopefully no one else in the house cares to try one."
"O: Not quite as bad as I expected (considering it is a Shock Top beer) but for some reason I felt compelled to try it. Probably the best Shock Top beer I have tried but I will not be running out to get it again. I wish it was not so artificial in flavor and aroma."
"Well, with the specified input ingredients dominating, as expected (save the first on the list - ale!), I can't really fault truth in advertising here.  However, any sort of chocolate beer should at the very least pay lip service to the roasted character of the malt, whether or not cocoa adjuncts are used.  Oh, right - they just added chocolate extract to a light wheat ale.  Done and duh."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is very mild, a bit of chocolate. Taste is chocolate, vanilla, some roasted malts, good flavor. Feels light in the mouth and overall is a solid beer."
""
""

"O- this could be a great idea for a beer style, but it's just too artificial and watery"
""
""
""
""
"I must admit that I was very skeptical about this beer. In general, I find Shock Top beers to be pretty artificial, but enjoyable. When I poured this into the glass, I was pleasantly surprised. It had a nice tan head, smelled of cocoa and vanilla, and was much darker than expected. The overall flavor and mouthfeel was equally pleasant. I would definitely purchase this again, if I had the opportunity."

"Shockolate Wheat represents what might be the best of the Shock Top line. It's not a world beater, but it is a pleasant surprise."

"Meh taste meh"

"Pours medium brown with a lot of haze.  Decent head.  Nose has an unmistakable milk chocolate quality to it.  Milk chocolate right away on the palate too, followed by some transition to toasty malt flavors and pronounced carbonation.  Light bodied."
"Overall: An excellent dessert beer (it really is the dessert in and of itself, although it could pair remarkably well with a huge range of items). And an excellent holiday beer as well, although I think the sweetness really cuts it's drinkability down to one, or perhaps two for those with a bit of a sweet-tooth. Interestingly enough, I believe that this is the exact same beer as the Chocolate Wheat, but with a different label for release in winter."

"you know, aside from these beers being over flavored to the point of it seeming artificial, they actually taste pretty good, at least they taste like they say they are going to taste. a weird chocolate wheat beer here thats way more chocolate than beer. a mix of dry cocoa all the way to hersheys syrup is the progression in this thing, it finishes really sweet, but it doesnt start that way. looks a little darker than a conventional brown ale, and tastes like dessert. the way boulder beers shake is all chocolate, this takes it to a whole new level beyond that one, and for me, shake is getting close to the line. i see the appeal with beers like this for the holidays and for people who dont like the way chocolate sometimes manifests itself as bitterness in more crafty beers, but this is a one and done for me, like a glass of chocolate milk minus the milk. intensely flavored, not at all bad, but not at all beer either."
""

"Milk chocolate flavor. Sweeter than I anticipated. Ah, who am I kidding. It's a shock top beer and over does whatever they print on the label. You want chocolate?  We'll give you chocolate!  Double the chocolate Steve...."
"A good color, the chocolate taste is not overpowering by any means, and it's just as good out of the bottle as it was being poured out.  Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again, but I had to try it before the price of chocolate skyrockets."

"Aroma is vanilla dominant, with chocolate undertones and a touch of cinnamon. There's a bit of a metallic character accompanying wheat. Flavor reveals similar vanilla dominance, milk chocolate undertones, and a light citrus note, with a fairly weak wheat backbone. Cinnamon surfaces late. Becomes much better after swirling in the yeast, but any beer that claims artificial sweeteners as an ingredient..."

" The taste is okay with a nutty cocoa flavor with moderate sweetness up front with light wheat maltiness and slight chalky dry aspect with a suppplementary vanilla and mild yeast in the taste. The yeast is relatively clean with a hint of toasted malt and subtle caramel toward the middle. The flavor has a hint of dark fruit as it warms. Overall this is a decent wheat pretty much standard with some mild cocoa flavors -not bad, but not a beer I would drink more than 1 of either."

"Overall: A chalky beer, kind of watered down with not a lot of other flavors or aromas to dissect. Very simple."
""
"Definitely has a very chocolatey taste."
