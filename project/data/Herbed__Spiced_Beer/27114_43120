Smell is of malt, grain, spice, mint, herb, and pickle juice aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, herb, and pickle juice flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of herb bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with odd but interesting mint and pickle juice qualities that I wasn't expecting.","UCLABrewN84","Apr 10, 2014"

A pleasant enough white ale with definite coriander spice in the swallow. That flavor lingers on a bit too much for me, burning my throat after a while.

Finishes clean with a soft underlying bitterness that mellow the flavors out. Spice and ginger linger. A really unique brew. It really does taste like a belgian blonde was brewed with over the tope spices and lagered. Clean complex fun and delicious. I like it. (it actually smells like a Sauvigion Blanc no lie).

4.1,15.8,4,4,4,4,4.5,"This is a real winner here. Cloudy golden liquid with a very big white head and a good slow fade that leaves quite a bit of lace and a thick covering on top. Active carbonation. Smell is full of spices and a great doughy malt. Some zesty orange and light mellon like sweetness along with a ginger and corriander. This is a great tasting beer that combines the crispness of a lager with the broader palate of an ale, Belgian Wit to be specific. It somehow maintains some of the hallmark lager cleanness while delivering a bouquet of citrus and spice along with a dry chalky quinine bitterness. Finish is dry and orangey with spices flavoring a light malt that lingers. Feel is wonderful with a velvety carbonation and light medium weight. Crisp and quenching this beer makes for a perfect beer to slake the spring/summer thirst. It is supremely drinkable and while a bit on the higher side in abv it sessions well. This is one heck of brew that has its feet well planted in two worlds and I'm loving it!","scootny","Jul 30, 2012"

And yet I'm glad my curiosity convinced me to pick it up! Not particularly bizarre or exotic actually, and in fact it tasted much as you would expect a witbier lager hybrid if that makes sense. Cloudy wheat appearance with almost no head. Definitely enjoyed the spices that dominate this brew, consumed by the typical orange/coriander witbier ingredients, but also by the ginger that is added to this unique beer. If you enjoy spiced beer, I see no reason why not to love this one. The 6% is slightly above your average witbier, and yet not particularly noticeable. I also found that the spices become even richer as the beer warms a little bit. I enjoyed all 22 oz of this, and I'll probably come back to it now and then if it continues to be available.

Upfront on the taste the spices were a little bolder which were coriander, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It also had some nice citrus accents that had a nice wheat malt balance.

Ah, there is a flavor I find in pepperoni...not the meat or salt, but an herbal character. The herb components of this beer totally dominate a sort of heaviness over the malt and what should be refreshing coriander and orange. There is a peppery zip that tries to show, but loses to the earthiness. The finish is rather dry and the orange shows pretty strong here. Light body and strong fine carbonation. As much as I'd like to say I hate it, it is very complex in an odd and slightly intriguing way.

Strong citrus notes; I'm mostly picking up lemon. Kind of grassy notes as well. An acidy bite to it at first. Definitely citrus as the main attraction. I get the feeling of spices but am not advanced enough to pick any out specifically. A very fizzy mouthfeel upfront. But it seemed to lose some carbonation as I got further along and seemed borderline flat at the end. Like I feel about a lot of beers, I think this beer could hit the spot at the right moment such as after a hot day on the golf course where something thirst quenching would fit the bill.

Taste is almost like a Belgian wit beer with a serious carbonation bite. Evident in the taste is the spicing, some good dry bitterness that has a bite but not a chomp, and a slight citrus fruitiness throughout. Great thirst quenching brew. Nice bitterness.

The beer is a hazy, pale orangey white, with moderate carbonation, a few floaties and no real lacing. It has a unique and spicy aroma that is dominated by orange, but ginger and a bit of hops show up as well. A clean yeast lets all of the flavors come through, starting with orange, but moving to the ginger and fennel, wheat, a definite sour note, and lightly bitter citrusy hops on top of a light, tingly, almost creamy body that has a very dry finish.

I noticed some other BAs had some problems with this beer being flat...perhaps they are over-compensating now because my bottle was almost over-carbed. The flavor of ginger and fennel in beer is certainly not for everyone, but again, I thought it be a unique flavor that works in a light, blond and nearly effervescent beer. One more point: even though this is a lager it shouldn't be served to cold as the doing so muted the fruitier flavor of the ginger and sweet orange peel.","marcobrau","Aug 22, 2009"

Hops flooded in, too, and far too sharp and subtle to flush out the poor taste. Watery in the mouth and dry and awful on the back end.

The aroma was lightly citrusy with citrus fruits, a pinch of citrus hops, a hint of toasted wheat, a touch of sweet yeast, and then finishes up with a small whiff of candy. While the aroma was citrus based, the taste was more about the malted wheat. It was after the wheat where all the citrus flavors came out. I thought that was the end of the taste, but there was a little more after the citrus flavors. After the citrus flavors is where the taste gets slightly dry with a tiny touch of sweet yeast. I liked how there was plenty of wheat in here, but there were also subtle notes of citrus and sweet yeast. This was of course a light bodied beer with a faint wheat based aftertaste of malted wheat, lemon peel, and a subtle splash of sweet yeast. In the end, it's not a bad beer at all.

When the yeast is swirled in from the bottom of the 22oz bottle, you get a little more fruity, clove flavors. This beer tastes like a wheat ale supercharged wth a lot of anise. A bit too much in my opinion. The sediment adds a more complex flavor profile. The palate is tart when filtered, adding the yeast dulls down the tartness fest.

The carbonation was good, and the beer was light and refreshing, but I think HeBrew went a little overboard with the coriander. In my opinion, less would have been more, but still a pretty darn good beer.","pershan","Jun 27, 2008"
3.62,2.3,3.5,4,3.5,3.5,3.5,"bottle. i could've also had it on tap at Blind Tiger Ale House, but there were so many choices that day. cloudy, pale yellow in color, like Lemonade with honey. had a very fizzy head, like a wheat beer, with only a thin ring clinging to the glass. smelled yeasty with lemon peel, honey & lime, like a cider. the taste was pretty nice... lemon and herbs, mint, ginger, white pepper were all there... like a Ricola throat drop. very bubbly and gassy, like champagne. maybe a little too gassy. i started to feel a little bloated. i'd have to say that this is certainly unique perfect for summer!! the label is also quite appealing, with a voluptous woman holding and almost kissing an albino python with a snakeskin background. Cool idea, definitely novel.","getalife2k5","Jun 22, 2008"

3.09,-12.7,4.5,3,3,3,3,"Wow. A very light sunny yellow color - cloudy, peachy. Is this what an unfiltered Budweiser would look like? Creamy/ foamy white head. The nose is citrus zest and lemon lollipop. The flavor is a muted more of the same. Prickly carbonation on a light body. The carbonation makes it feel fuller, but don't get fooled. An interesting twist on a witbier as it is a lager. This is a better version of Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat, but still not something I would buy. It's kinda got my stomach all gassy. But I love the way it looks in the glass.","dedrinker","Jun 17, 2008"
4.07,15,3.5,4,4,4,4.5,"I think that this ""White Lager"" style turned out fairly well for the most part, with the crisp nature and hoppy profile of an American Lager mixing well with the full flavored zesty nature of a Hefe or Witbier. Drinkibility was very nice. I paired this up with some barbecued chicken, grilled sausage, and corn on the cob for a perfect Summer afternoon meal.","Kegatron","Jun 08, 2008"
