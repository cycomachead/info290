"Okay, lacked taste for a Yards brew, no aftertaste."
""
""
"Aroma of light wintery pine, malt caramel. Taste mild pine, herbal, malt, spice. Nice!"
""
"O: Meh. Too sweet for my preferences. Interesting for historical purposes, however, as it's pretty likely that the ales being produced in this country around the time of the Revolution were something like this."
""
"Very different and easy drinking. I think I could enjoy this beer immensely, but only one at a sitting and only every so often."
""

""
"One of the best Yards beers"

"An unusually and delightful change up session ale. Keeping in mind the time that the recipe for this and all the other Ales of the Revolution series, this review is for a glass at a cellar temperature. When I had my first bottle right out of the refrigerator the spruce took over and ruined the beer. Let it sit for twenty minutes or so, to let the caramel bloom and balance the bitttering components . Then sit back and enjoy each sip"

"Taste is sweet - molasses, with some spruce/pine at the finish.  More spruce flavor would improve this, IMHO.  Overall, enjoyable to have one now and again.  My second favorite of the Ales of the Revolution series, after George Washington."
""
"I think I got myself psyched for something this beer is not. Is it a good decent beer? Sure, but the spruce notes are very subtle. I bought this because I wanted spruce flavor or a unique taste...and it really does not deliver on that account. If this were on sale, and I wanted ""beer", sure I'd pick it up. But as a special, ""spiced"" or herbal flavored beer, it doesn't really measure up."

"Thanks to jzeillinger for this, poured from a 12oz bottle. Golden bidyy, thin head and the spruce isn't overdone, nicely nuanced. Ends a bit thin."
""
""
""
""
""
"O: Very interesting beer. One of the most interesting I have ever had. I do not even know if it is technically a beer since Yards calls the beer a malt beverage. A nice complexion of malts that is impressively complex, but drinkable at the same time"
""
""
""
"O- a very interesting beer, not what I expected and not something I would want regularly but definitely worth a try and maybe an occasional return."
""
""
""
""
"Actually, a pretty decent beer which was, IMHO, better a few years ago when it was in blue bottles. However, consider that during the revolution, hops were no longer imported from Europe and a substitute had to be found. Spruce works rather nicely."
""
""
""
""
""
"I liked this beer — it reminded me a lot of a nut brown ale. Not sure I picked up the spruce to great effect, but it is quite tasty."

"Overall – Nothing too spectacular here. The flavors never really meld all that well, with a kind of muddled flavor overall."
""
""
""
""
""

"This is definitely a different one. It pours a deep clear brown with a thin light tan head. The aroma is interesting, with some very strong molasses notes and hints of the malt. The taste, though, is really where this beverage becomes unique. It opens with the molasses but transitions into a moderate and definitive spruce flavor. I didn't mind it and it reminds me of walking through evergreens, where the aroma from the trees is so strong you taste it. It's not overwhelming, but you can't miss it. There's a nice weight to the body and it's quite smooth. Well-made and different, it might not be one I'd drink regularly, but it's definitely worth trying."

"Has a very interesting and refreshing taste. Sort of a Vienna Lager but with something else which I guess is the spruce tips. Nice and different and it works. I definitely enjoy this one after doing 4 hrs of outdoor work today. It's a very refreshing and flavorful beer. Not sure if I'd go out of my way to find it but I enjoyed it."
"O: I've had douglas fir tea, but not a spruce tea. But they are both brewed with the tips. It is similar but the malt body makes it different. Different. I was most excited to try this one, but I have a feeling the porter in the series might be my favorite."
""
""
"Nicely carbonated for those of us who enjoy a tinkle mouth feel."
"O: This isn't that bad for a beer that followed Ben Franklin's original recipe. The spruce flavors aren't that strong, but seem to keep this from being too sweet."
""
""
""
"Amber in color with a brownish hue and perfect clarity. Poured with a short, off-white foam that reduced to a healthy cap that left sheets of wet lacings on the glass. Fresh, earthy spruce aroma along with sweet maple syrup notes and bready malt beneath. Medium bodied, slightly oily feel, refreshing carbonation over the top, and a crisp dry finish. Spruce flavor up front along with a slighty metallic taste. Sweet maple into the middle followed by a spicy, herbal tanginess. Finished crisply and dryly with an herbal, spruce aftertaste."
""
""
""
""
""
""
" the Taste has a nice flavor of malt up front with a woody hop and the spruce provides a subtle earthy and clean element to the somewhat sweet flavor. The spruce is aromatic and contributes to the taste but the bready taste is the malts primary contribution with a subtle molasses element adding flavor toward the middle. Overall I really enjoy beers like this that have a traditional element or a backstory as to why the ingredients were used. I think this is very drinkable and would probably handle several in a sitting."
""
""
""
""
"O- I respect that Yards has adapted the ""original"" recipe. But there isn't a lot to this beer. I wouldn't want to go out and buy a case of this."

"Remarks: I've wanted to try one since reading about it in Joy of Home Brewing, but I can definitely say this is not my thing"

"All about the Benjamins tonight. Copper appearance with nice head, lacing. Spicy aroma. Smooth to drink with an enjoyable flayor. Makes we want to explore other beers like it. Another winner for Yards, I am becoming a fan. Bought as part of a sampler case of the Revolution series."
""
""
"O - Maybe the best of the Ales of the Revolution. An easy drinking spiced ale that goes well with a light meal."
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"D: An authentic, iced tea-like ole time tavern ale with drinkability. I'd not have 2 in a row. But I'd order it at a tavern for sure."
""
"Overall: According to Yards, this beer was crafted from Benjamin Franklin’s original recipe, using molasses, spruce tips and sprigs. It is a very interesting beer, with good flavor and mouthfeel, however, that appearance really puts me off. It certainly is a bottle beer for me, but just not one that I’m probably going to be searching out on a consistent basis. It was a great choice for the 4th of July weekend though, which is why I got it."
""
"Appearance is a muddy brown with a burnt orange hue on the edges. There was a thin layer of head most of which dissipated rather quickly. The nose had the definite essence of spruce - like a Christmas tree in a glass. Spruce notes certainly were noticeable in the flavor profile as well. There was a mild hint of similar spices and a simple but pleasant semi-dry finish. This beer was a nice change of pace, but there is nothing particularly outstanding here beyond the creative use of the spruce flavors."
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Overall, I liked this beer. It was worth the purchase and I would get it again if I saw it at a bar."
""
""
"Pours medium dark brown, some reddish tints, good white foam. Rings around the edge. Pine nose, molasses too. Syrup as well. Taste is a subtle sweetness. Slight root beer taste. Mint/spruce sprig taste. Smooth & flavorful. Pretty damn good original recipe."
""
""
""
""
""
"O - This is really refreshing and different, its not the best, but a good addition to this series."
""
""
""
"Overall, better than expected. Not overly spiced which is nice."
""
""
"It tastes like an Irish Red had a baby with some mint leaves. I like it!"
""
""
""
"Get out and try one because life is too short to drink crappy beer!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"Overall: Does Ben Franklin ever get anything wrong? This is curiously mellow and drinkable, but the profile is not quite the pine cone pinata I expected... warmed me on this winter's night for sure!"
""
""
""
""
"O: I like this much more than i was expecting to. Nice herbal quality to it."
""
""
"O: A mellow enjoyable drink. I wouldn't mind more spruce and wood flavors, and the body could be a bit more substantial, but there is nothing wrong with this beer. It really is a perfect quaffing ale."
"Overall, I really thought this one was interesting and I'm really glad I gave it a whirl. I definitely wouldn't session with it but if the planets align again, I'll have it again. Another unique and quality brew from Yard's."
""
""

"Somewhat hazy, reddish-brown pour, with a half inch or so of foamy white head. Aroma is herbal with notes of spruce and dark sugar. I'm definitely not a big fan of spruce or juniper flavor (I hate gin with a passion), but fortunately this beer isn't too potent in that area. Taste of woody spruce and sap, fairly balanced by brown sugar sweetness and molasses, herbal, nutty, with somewhat medicinal notes. Medium body, and decent overall. For what it's worth, this is okay, but it's not something I'd go for more than once or twice in a lifetime. Luckily Yards has lots of other good stuff to chose from."
""
"O-it's just a mediocre beer. I was expecting more from a piney ale. I guess I always expect good beer to be on tap. This was pretty much a let down. The flavors are so weak, it reminds me of an adjunct. Though there are no off flavors!"
""
""
""
""
""
""
""
"O- Pretty good and unique tasting. Another solid beer from Yards."
""
"Overall, a very nice beer. You have to be in the mood for this and I certainly am right now with the weather changing to cooler temps. Very nicely brewed. Cheers!"

"I had no idea this was of the style of ""herbed/spiced beer"" but I can definately see that. Didn't know what to categorize it as but upon originally ingesting it, I myself as well as friend have said ""it's like drinking a spruce tree"". I've had Christmas beers that have been much more overspiced, but I think this is adequite and not overdone. It states that it's brewed in the fashion of Founding Fathers and is in Yard's Ales of the Revolution pack. I've categorized this as the Thomas Jefferson but a little less bite and a little more pine. Once again I'm jocking this beer as it is from one of my favorite breweries."
""
"This beer is definitely different. It's like a bad root beer, but easily drinkable."
"Way bigger and richer than the 5% ABV would suggest. This is a thoroughly drinkable ale with the friendliest flavors. The molasses gives some spice and fruitiness along with the hoppy edge that is really worth a try."

"Thanks to tone77 for this beer."
"Overall, interesting brew that really does highlight the spruce tip flavor. Something I could definitely drink in simpler times when much better craft beer was not available."
""
""
"The body of this beer is medium, carbonation is right down the middle, feel is fine overall. Someone else said it was “like drinking your Christmas tree water” and that’s pretty apt. Not a ton of fun."
"Medium light mouthfeel with good carbonation. Overall this is a beer that one would really want to be a spruce aficionado to try. The spruce is not subtle, but is well done. I am sure this one is good for whatever ales (ails) you. Give it a try!"
"Odd beer I wasn't sure I'd like as it could be hit or miss but was more of a hit. Poured a light brownish hue with solid one-finger head that left bubbles and lace so no complaints. On first sniff I get a mild sticky malt aroma, with some sweetness, then patches of piney, floral hops and some spice (guess that's the spruce). Light to medium bosy, smooth and chewey, some breadiness and touch of sweet malts in this beer, odd balance with minor floral hops and the spices for a weird sweet/heavy bitter and light mix. Crisp finish, and while not perfectly balanced this could've been a lot worse and I enjoyed relaxing with this beer."
""
"A unique beer that I definitely recommend trying!"
""
""
"O: The first time I had this was at Yards Taproom, I really enjoyed it. I'm usually a fan of high hops, and higher alcohol content than this. However, this is a great, easy to drink session beer for the colder months."
"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a pretty auburn color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of spruce and pine. Taste is also spruce, pine, a menthol like flavor, different and unusual. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall I would not want a steady diet of it, but worth a try."
"Pours a clear deep garnet color with a thin off white head. Big time spruce tips on the nose with touches of molasses and maple. Caramel malt comes through a bit as well. Surprisingly crisp with a light to moderate body which thins a bit on the swallow. Finishes clean yet boring. Flavor up front on the other hand is pretty interesting. Flavorful spruce tips with balanced by molasses and caramel with buttered toast landing someone on the middle palette. The finish is hard to pin point but it does cleanse the palette well leaving an overall dry taste in the mouth. Better than expected and unique as well."

"All in all this beer is very enjoyable and I believe it is good for any time of the year."
""
""
"O: I had a bottle or two of this from the bottle and surprisingly it was better from the bottle. While I couldn't smell it really, the flavor was more direct and stronger. From a glass this is too watery and boring."
""
""
""
"NICE, WORTH TRYING!"
""
""
"This beer pours a clear, amber color with a thin head and lace. The aroma is of pine and grapefruit with maple in the finish, increasing as it warms. The flavor has spruce, bread crust, and sweet malt notes with some spices, mainly ginger. It's mouthfeel is medium. Yards Poor Richards Tavern Spruce Ale is a good beer, dry and slightly warming. Great on a cold Christmas Eve. Recommended."

"Overall: Different and unique and I actually quite enjoyed"
"M. Medium bodied, but slightly under-carbonated and at times I get an oddball oily residual feel that fades in and out strangely...if there is a thing that I would consider needing work, this is it."

"tour. The sample that I had this week was probably the worst beer I have ever had. I don't know how a beer could be this bad but obviously Yards brewery that can make it htappen."
"So, I really love the idea of historic beers...anything from an authentic, old recipe is great. In concept at least. This, however, is one of those beers that reminds me that modern brewing recipes and techniques are a wonderful thing. The beer is an amber color, with a modest white head. It's smell is tree-like, with the spruce nearly overpowering. Still, it's fresh, with a lively malt undercurrent. Really, the smell is engaging. The taste, however, is where the overwhelming comes into play. It's dry-ish, with the spruce, woody component playing against the malt. Not really all that appealing to me. Decent body, full and satisfying. Overall, this is drinkable, but very underwhelming."
"D: Tavern Spruce drinks a little better after a month or two. As mentioned in a previous Ales of the Revolution review, a strange concept for a year round brew. Nothing I'd go out of my way to experience again."
"Pours a three-finger khaki head that fades slowly to a thin layer leaving some lace. Cloudy brown color. Light-medium carbonation and medium bodied. Light molasses nose and flavor is molasses and spruce. Drying finish. $3.00 for a 12oz bottle from Mount Vernon Gift Shop, Mount Vernon, VA."
"Mouthfeel is medium bodied and smooth with steady carbonation. Pretty easy drinking brew and I enjoy the spruce twist and the historical recipe. Have had this once before and would have it again. Thanks smokeypeat."
"O- The minty pine aroma and taste was very off putting for me, not a beer I would drink again, would not recommend this one to others but that’s just my opinion."
"O: Solid brew. I thoroughly enjoyed this."
"Pours a murky mahogany color, with a huge, rocky, tan head. The aroma provides a feeling of what it must be like to dry hump a Christmas tree: there is little but evergreen here, although maybe a little bit of pepper creeps in. The flavor is actually more balanced, which is kind of a let-down, with a dull graininess creeping in to muddle the woodsy spruce character. The texture is fine but mostly average. Overall, the distinctive spruce aroma makes this beer, but it's too bad that the flavor can't meet the expectations that are established by the first smell. Even so, the aroma was enough for me to love drinking this beer."
"Interesting. Probably a nice winter beer, especially around the holidays. Definitely not an everyday drink, unless its what you're into."
"D - I really like this beer. The dominant spruce flavor is very appealing. While there are better offerings from Yards, this still a great example of what they can do. The drinkability is high and very sessionable. Being on-tap at the brewery, the beer is extremely fresh, crisp, and refreshing."
"Ben Franklin was a great man, but this beer well it is a pass."
"Overall: This is a really interesting beer. I'm enjoying the spruce along with the malt sweetness. I would definitely have this one again."
"D: Interesting beer. A little out of balance to be sessionable, but worth a try."
"O: Like others have said, this beer is basically an almost-new take on a rather typical one. It's enjoyable to try a bottle, but I'd be disappointed if I had paid for a 6-pack, at least for the price of $10. Yards has many a good beer, much better than this one; can't hit the bullseye every time."
"Drinkability is ok, I could have a few of these but not a whole lot because of the spruce."
"D- I could have one or two tops. It is a tasty brew, but I think the spruce makes it difficult to session."
"The body is medium, not light and not full. Drinkability was very good, I'd have a couple of these. Overall, this is a pretty good brew. Certainly worth a shot."
"UPDATE Again: I really like it now. Maybe that first bottle was off."
"M/D: Medium bodied with good carbonation, a touch more would have been nice, but its not a problem at all. Has a sticky/dry finish. Definitely a fall/winter beer, would pair nicely at Thanksgiving. Not an everyday drinker, but something I would consider picking up from time to time."
"Drinkability: It's a little too sweet and herbal to have a second. A great history lesson, though."
"d: really drinkable and unique. the low abv makes it pretty sessionable. i'd definitely buy it again."
"Fuller medium body, decent carbonation, a little sticky. Drinks okay, although the advertised herbs and spices are pretty light, especially in the nose. Not bad, but I probably wouldn't seek it out."
"D - A truly relaxing beer, good for cold winter nights and lazy days. Enjoying this beer as it warms in my hand, I could defiantly enjoy several Spruce Ales with my excitement about its taste not diminishing."
"D: Very nice drinkable beer. Perfect for sitting around the fireplace on a cold day. Not necessarily one I'd want to drink all day, but I am looking forward to the other one in my sampler pack."
"Cool to see a nod to a historical recipe, but not quite my preferred taste."
"The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is decent, it was pretty drinkable for a spruce flavored beer. The spruce isn't something I would like very often, but it was a decent beer with a very cool concept behind it."
"D: Really an enjoyable beer, and so easy to drink! At just 5%, the Tavern Spruce is plenty sessionable. PLENTY. If this is how the Founding Fathers imbibed, then sign me up for that first time machine trip back to the late 18th-century. If this were available in Portland, it'd be a fridge staple."
"Drinkability: Almost tastes like a grut beer. A nice holiday novelty that I can see myself having one or two of due to the aggressive spicing."
"D: Strange but good.. Low ABV, great and unique flavors, worth looking for if you like the strange and unique. One or two will do you."
"The nose brings some more pine and spruce as well as a bit of light earthy character. Some other mild herbs there as well. A bit of very light sweetness and bread crust, but this is a bit plain and relies too heavily on spruce alone. Feel is fairly light with good carbonation. Interesting, but not all that great."
"Transparent brownish-red in body with fluffy off-white head that leaves little lacing. Sharp aroma of molasses, spices, pepper, spiced honey, soy sauce. Tastes of molasses, spices, medicinal flavors, salt, hop bitterness towards the finish and the drink rides out on some hop dryness and slight pepper/soup. High in carbonation and medium bodied. A warming beer that goes well on this rainy day."
"Pours a brown color with a slight one finger head which goes to skim and some moderate lacing. The aroma is of sweet malts and a big spruce aroma. It's kinda like a tree in a bottle with sweetness. The taste is much of the same, there is a nice sweet malt backbone that balances out a sprucey tree like flavor. It is a different taste, not bad, but different. The mouthfeel is a little slick and moderately carbonated. Overall its tough to think about drinkability, it is so different in its taste that it is very interesting, yet the taste is something that would get old after two or three."
"Very unique brew I was glad I tried it."
"Very interesting brew. A dark amber brown with a thin tan head. Aroma of malt, some sweet molasses and a hint of the spruce. Fist sip is a bit malty, but different. Some molasses and yet still something else. There is a spice?? Maybe the spruce. Its not overwhelming, its actually nice. It makes this one more like a winter warmer or Christmas ale. Has that nice warm brown ale flavor with just that hint of spruce or cloves?? Either way its a tasty brew for the colder months. Glad I tried it."
"Poured a dark brown/amber into a pint glass. Thick cream colored head, great retention and lacing. Smell of strong spruce, like a forest, some malt sweetness and spice. Spruce hits the tongue right away, almost overpowering. A little more malt backbone would have helped this one, but definitely tasty and certainly has its own flavor niche. Good beer."
"Serving type: bottle"
"I wouldn't run out to get more of this, but it was nice to try once and think about Ben Franklin cooking up a barrel of this 200 years ago."
"A dark copper mahogany colored brew with a modest off-white fuzzy cover and similar lacing. The aroma is a sweet moxie evergreen and maple malt, fairly strong and decent. The flavor brings much the same as the smell. Mild menthol spruce/evergreen hops with toasted pumpernickel. The carbonation is decently brisk with a clean lively feel in a medium bodied brew. It's pretty drinkable and in my view a much more likable than the basic Tavern Ale I tried earlier tonight."
"Overall: an interesting beer based on Ben Franklins original recipe brewed with molasses,spruce tips and sprigs. Not exceptionally good on it's own bit I can definitely see this paired with food. More then likely this is not something I would seek out again."
"D: Good brew for everyday drinking, a nice malt layering from start to finish. Easy drinking, but for the amount of flavors, I would like to see more ABV to make it a well rounded drinkable brew. (Yes for me intensity of taste and ABV % need to be matched for a complete drinkablity.)"
"I like Yards alot, their brews always look good and taste good. This is a unique brew, that once you get midway through the glass, you appreciate its flavor. I am not an experienced herb/spice beer drinker, but this one is good. This could replace some of the winter brews out there that I have tried. Its drinkable but I dont know if a case would be something I would want. A good brew on a cool night by a camp fire for sure."
"Overall: I liked this...can see myself on Christmas Eve drinking a few and going back in time when this was the type of brews the old timers used to drink. See it? Get some!"
"D: This is an interesting beer for sure, nothing like I have ever tasted. THat being said, I was pleasantly surprise and enjoyed it. I wish I could taste more pine though. It was not overly spectacular but worthy of a shot."
"Drinkability: Quite nice -- the flavors would make it much of a fall or winter selection, but I would certainly be more than happy to drink it any time of year; great flavors with a moderate ABV would easily allow for a couple to be gotten through."
"edit: after reading an earlier review that described blueberry and menthol flavors in the beer, I want to add that I concur with that judgment."
"Pours a very attractive red hued light brown with a creamy parchment head that has pretty decent staying power and leaves nice lace. The aroma is not what I had expected. It is pleasantly malty with plenty of toffee and brown sugar/molasses notes. I also detect some raisin and perhaps a bit of toasted malt like character. The spruce is only a rumor in the aroma, mostly coming off as herbaceous. The flavor is quite nice with a great balance. Malty overall with a sweet caramelized profile that mingles with some earthy hop like flavors(interesting as I do not believe hops are used in this beer at all) and subdued spruce essence that are most evident in the slightly medicinal finish. It's a much different flavor than that of say piney hops, and it really melds well with the malt instead of standing against it. I am also getting a bit of dried raisin or cherry character similar to what I smelled in the aroma. This is only my second beer brewed with spruce in it, but it is infinitely better than the first which was dominated by Christmas tree aroma and flavor. The mouthfeel on this beer is superb. Very creamy with subdued carbonation and a medium body. It goes down quite easily, but is not necessarily the kind of beer you would drink a lot of in one sitting. Another great offering from Yard's Ales of the Revolution series."
"Ok. This beer is nutts. The smell of spruce blew my senses away and the taste equals it kind of a wintergreen after taste. Come on and this suppose to be Ben Franklin's Recipe serious I think Ben was smoking spruce. lol. Now back to this review. If the hint of spruce wasn't in this beer it would be a good strong ale. But I do give Yards props to put out this old bold recipe and sure there fans out there that like this beer but I'm not a fan of this at all."
"My least favorite of the Ales of the Revolution by a hair - they're all interesting and worth drinking - but I'm very intrigued as to what kind of grub this one would pair with."
"I really do like this beer for its complexity even though it isn't the most drinkable of beers. Drink this when you want to try something different. All of the Yards ""Ales of the Revolution"" are really interesting/complex beers."
"D: One for the books to get when I go out with the guys or bring a 6 pack to a party"
"Found this at a respectable beer store in Lambertville, NJ, off of Main Street, though I don't remember the name. Anyway, into a pint glass, poured a reddish/brown with 3 fingers of beige head, and fantastic lacing. The nose? Wow..juicyfruit, spearmint, maple syrup, and molasses. The flavor was even more impressive with a big macintosh apple influence, mixed with juicyfruit, mint, and molasses, and then dissolving to a crisp mac apple/mint finish, which lingered afterwards. Spritzy yet medium-bodied and smooth. As I drank this while smoking some pork butt on my Brinkmann in the backyard, I couldn't help noticing that this is a great summer beer."
"Interesting & not unpleasant overall. Went from novel to harsh to pretty decent. Another ""glad I tried it"" beer, but I can't see drinking more than one at a time, & I doubt I'd seek it out. Still, not bad."
"Drinkability: Not exactly my kind of beer. Yard's was going for spruce, and they nailed it. If you like this kind of beer, I'd say go for it. Unfortunately, this one isn't for me and I gotta say it's a drain pour. I'm glad I got to try it, but I'll pass next time."
"Drinkability: This is a very unique beer. I've never had a beer flavored with spruce before and, I must say, it really enhanced the drinking experience. This beer is most definitely worth a shot."
"This is not my cup of tea. Maybe it's because it immediately conjures up thoughts of nasty cold sores but the campho phenique/medicinal flavor is just not something I find appealing. It's interesting, but definitely not something I will try again. I just don't enjoy this flavor at all. This was both a drainpour and a glass changer."
"Very good beer. Frist of its kind that I have tasted. It makes me want to fly to Philadelphia and back just to stock up. If you live near you must go on a tour and try each and every beer that Yards offers, you won't be sorry. My wife and I took a tour on our honey moon and can't wait to go back."
"This is something of strange beast, being crimson in colour and having a heady mix of pine and caramel on the nose, which carries over to the drinking. With the prevalence of pine fresh toilet cleaner though these days though, it is difficult not to think of industrial cleaner instead of the tasty, delightful beer that this undoubtedly is."
"D - Overall a very nice beer at 5 percent a perfect succession beer full of oaky and spiced flavor. Great brew"
"D: This is a really nice drinkable ale, and will drink again"
"Mouthfeel is light and well carbonated, and its highly drinkable. I'd say drinkability is the best feature of this beer."
"A great beer I could have had another one right after my first which is suprising for a spiced brew. well worth trying and seeking out"
"Haven't had many spruce ales, besides my own homebrew, but this one beats the hell out of that."
"Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a tan head that doesn't offer much in the way of retension. It isn't long before the beer is left with only a thin ring of lace along the top of the beer. Nose includes a bit of caramel maltiness along with a bit of a citrus zip that isn't quite hops but is close to it. Taste upfront is an overwelming amount of the ""spruce"" addition. It is quite spicey and it lingers right on through until the aftertaste. Body of the beer has some maltiness but the spruce really distracts from the other flavors that might be in this beer. It has a medium to light feel and light amount of carbonation. For me, this would be a good festive holiday beer. For some reason the spruce is reminding me of the Christmas holiday season. However, it is not something I would want to drink on a regular basis."
"It is appealing - but not my type of beer."
"Overall Impression: This brew reminds me of Christmas ale, so it is a good winter beer. I feel like I just quaffed a brew with our founding fathers. I feel the need to fly a kite in a electrical storm now!"
"Pours a cluttered light ruby brown with a small white bubbly head that doesn't really lace much at all. The smell has a lightly syrupy smell, with some subtle piny and floral notes as well. The spruce comes through pretty well in the taste, with some light hoppy bitterness, pine needles, and some subtle molasses as well. The body is nicely moderate, but there's a sharp tinge of carbonation at the end that serves to keep things a little awkward. That aside, this is a nice, solid, drinkable brew."
"Don't drink and review."
"single from Whole Foods Fair Lakes"
"d - This beer was decent, but not my favorite. I didn't think the spices and spruce were very flavorful, and thought the smell and taste were a little lacking. I wouldn't buy this one again."
"O - I enjoy it. I remember it being stronger tasting a few years ago. It seems they scaled back the spice and spruce more recently."
"Pours an amber body with a dirty sand color head that holds well. Smell has hints of molasses and the dried spruce twigs, a bit of a musty forest smell to it with a pleasing aroma of fresh evergreens over the mustiness. The flavor was a bit complex with earthy tastes of wood fiber, some maltiness, and the citrus like flavor of the spruce. Went down quite easily, not at all like chewing on a Christmas tree. A true interpretation of a Ben Franklin beer recipe. Very enjoyable."
"M - very light body and spritzy carbonation which I think helps give it a little more character."
"The spruce ale is a typical ale but made from an original recipe of ben franklins. he needed to try a bit harder."
"D: A good ole time tavern ale with solid drinkability good for several at a time. A nice change of pace beer, fairly unique flavorwise with a good sense of enjoyment. 6 pack recommend."
"I would not go around and pick up a six of this as spruce does not do it for me, but im glad I picked this bottle up. Maybe it's the change in location of the brewery or maybe it's the recession that's keeping boatloads of spruce from making it's way into the tanks, but I seem to like where this is going. Hopefully Yards makes more steps in this direction in the future."
"I bought this brew quite by surprise as part of the Ales of the Revolution variety pack. Poured from 12 ounce bottle into a fest beer glass. Carmel color and a trace head only on the outside rim of the glass lightly carbonated. Smell is absolutely wonderful a smell of sweet pine and sugary molasses. Outstanding spruce crisp flavor with sweetness like a sugary cookie. No notable hop profile, very moderate mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable brew I could very easily reach for another one."
"I truely enjoyed this beer, it really caught me by surprise. Poured a dark hazy amber with a creamy white head and laced really well. You could smell the molasses and spruce it was an amazing aroma. And the taste did not disappoint. Sweet from the molasses and that spruce tasted better then I thought it would. Finished with a citrusy after-taste. Euell Gibbons would be proud of this one. Makes me want to Drive to Philly and try it on tap at City Tavern. My hat is off to Yards."
"D - A unique and quite quaffable offering from Yards... A was a little leery upon opening that the spruce would be off putting, but this was anything but... Solid and a beer I would welcome in my glass at any time in the future..."
"Overall- Actually much better than you'd think. The spruce is tasty yet not overpowering."
"Drinkability: I haven't smelled and tasted anything quite like this since I was a kid collecting pinion pine cones and then roasting them to get at the pine nuts and trying to get the pine sap/resin off my hands. I could see having this one again once getting accustomed to these flavors in a beer. It seems a perfect accompaniment to the December holiday season while trimming a Christmas tree. Even now I'd not be unhappy with a few more bottles of this beer for an evening, but this is definitely a beer for slow sipping."
"D - With the balanced Spruce and Molasses combo you'll either love it or feel indifferent, not appaled. Would recommend a clean palate for tasting."
"Notes: This was not a bad beer,but I must add that it was not my preferred style. It was cloyingly sweet and while the overall makeup was average I found it hard to finish the whole beer. I mean it was not like when you can't finish a beer because it's awful;it was just too sweet and sprucy for me."
"Appreciate the creativity from Yards, though (even if it IS modeled after a centuries-old recipe!)"
"We shall see how the Yards beers change (if at all) w/ the Yards/PBC split. I'm excited either way!"
"Not a beer that I will try again. I appreciate the sample though, whoever it was from."
"I'd buy it again, and share it liberally. I think its a growth experience every beer connoisseur should have at least once."
"This interesting ale pours over the tongue lightly and is quite refreshing, with a taste reminiscent of a winter warmer tinged with a variety of spices like mint and maple syrup. Was really off-putting at first, but grew on me overtime and is quite an original little number."
"And yes, the bottle is very cool."
"D: Surprisingly quaffable. This is something that I would consider for a long day of drinking in the winter."
"D: Better than expected, I really don't like beers that end up tasting like water from a christmas tree (if that makes any sense) and I expected that from this but that wasn't the case. Despite the low abv, not particularly drinkable. I would not be able to enjoy more than one in a sitting."
"With a medium body and moderate carbonation, this brew has a smooth mouthfeel but remains crisp. The lower abv might suggest that it would be reasonably sessionable but I can't see myself drinking more than one in a single sitting. Worth a try, but not necessarily something I'd purchase again. Almost a novelty beer in my eyes; a fun brew to experience but not a great drinker."
"Drinkability: Very unique. Could drink one or two in a sitting. Would be very festive to have around Christmas time."
"First off, I love the glass. I wish it was used more. The earthy and leafy profile on this beer and a minor caramel like sweet tone make it a really nice one to sip on. After a while it seems to lose its interesting edge, but I still think it is pleasant. Kind of a slick mouthfeel and a very low carbonation. This started out well and kind of dropped off at the end. Still a decent beer though."
"Overall, I'm a little disappointed."
"Pours a nice dark copper color with a great head and nice lacing. For some reason there was a little sediment that I wasn't excepting, but nothing bad. Nice scent, a light malty smell with a small spruce hint, but nothing big in the herbed area. Nice taste! A great mix of flavors from the sweetness to the nice light, but very much there, spruciness. Goes down easily with just a bit of roughness. Great recipe."
"Someone must have read my original review because as soon as I popped the cap, the room smelled like Pine-Sol! My initial pour created a finger of fizzy tawny head with limited retention, quickly falling to wisps. Color was a deep copper with NE-quality clarity. Leaning in, it smelled like a freshly cut Christmas tree. Yes! Mouthfeel was medium and on this iteration, not only did I get that fresh mintiness, but I could also perceive the molasses on the tongue. Is my palate becoming more sensitive or did they tweak the recipe in the last six years? Finish was semi-dry with the commingled flavors of pine and molasses really lingering well after the swallow."
"D - not a brew to encourage session drinking. I would see this as more of a evening winter drink after dinner."
"An OK beer and an historical recreation this is something I could see trying again in Philadelphia. This however is nothing I could see buying a growler of."
"D- Can't really compare this beer to others in its style because this is truely a unique beer. Great history behind it and a decent brew overall. I will probably pick it up again. This is definately worth a try."
"Pours with A good mocha brown head forms after a rough swirl and succeeds slowly leaving dots of lacing. A nice shine to the light, a darkened mahogany brown in colour. The aroma is pleasing, in an odd kind of way, boasting notes of chocolaty mousse and spruce with definite notes of brown sugar, ginger and molasses - neat like something that should be baked! The mouthfeel could use a little texture beyond the dryness of the spruce, really chokes the mouth, but it does yield a world of flavour. A lot of spruce with hints of nuts (hazelnut, walnut) and malts. I really like this as an alternative to other styles, there is a lot that can be done with this style. I hope to see Spruce beers catch on a little more, I could see brewers doing interesting things with it..."
"Poured out a mahogony brown with a creamy thick off white head, average lacing. The nose is fresh, winter forest, pine, cleaner, spicy, with a bit of malt character providing backbone. The taste is more like a brown ale with cinnamon, but it is really spruce, evergeen, piney, actually fairly refreshing and well complemented. Has a distinct ginger note, almost like ginger-beer. Has a light body and light carbonation. Fairly drinkable, but you have to be into the flavor. A nice and well executed variation."
"Drinkability-only for the spruce lovers"
"Its a cool idea, and decent for what it is. Its fun to try from a historical perspective, but Ill only need to try one."
"First I wanna mention the really cool blue bottle this came in, nice touch. Poured a very dark amber with a big creamy white head. Slow fade left a thick coating of gooey lace on the glass. This looked very very nice, but looks can be decieving. Smell was how do you say, odd. Smelled like a pine tree air freshner, very dry, with hunts of flour, yeast, almost tree bark. Caramel, bread, and other sweet smells came through as it dried. The taste did not suit me well at all. Only word I could think of is huh? Tasted like a soda, very light and highly carbonated. Sugary, amost trying to be fruit like but not making it. Did have a dry finish, but I could barely get the glass down. This was one of the strangest beers I have ever drank. It was like chewing on a fresh cut xmas tree, but not in the good way."
"Gotta love the blue bottle plus it keeps more light out than the other varieties...appears a chestnut ruby amber in body with a nice tan head leaves some even thick coats of lacing down my glass. Aroma is very pleasant with outdoorsy spruce tips, fruity toastsed malt tones with an evident maple syrup character, however I stand corrected b/c the label states it contains molasses I can definitely smell some concentrated thickened sugar. Flavor...spruce ain't no joke, kinda like drinkin' your christmas tree water, but in addition to the pine tree flow this beer offers subtle malt sweetness with the spicing coming from the tree nice flowing ale. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a lighter more moderate carbonation but the flavors stay on the palate. Drinkability is definitely one of the most interesting brews I have had in awhile I'm glad I gave it a go can't wait to try more strange colonial style brews."
"Drinkability is pretty good, this is a unique beer that I enjoyed trying. Not really a session beer, mainly because I think I'd be overwhelmed by the spruce. This would be a great beer to drink in an actual colonial tavern, like the City Tavern in Philadelphia."
"This beer is a one-per-sitting, and something for cooler weather."
"Mouthfeel is thin with little carbonation...just how I imagine it would be in colonial times. I will have no trouble in finishing this off (unlike the Brewer Patriot Collection). Different beer...if you have the chance to try it, go for it."
"I would buy a case (or if I had enough people to drink it, a firkin!) anytime. Three cheers for colonial-style ale!"
"The spruce was a bit much as far as drinkability goes,lacks complexity,won't want to drink another. Not terrible, just nothing to excite."
"would not try again, not a good choice."
"Mouthfeel was nice, almost creamy. Drinkability? More than a couple at a time could become a little cloying, but as an occasional curve ball, this works very well."
"A fine accomplishment on this style of beer. After trying this beer I am convinced of trying to brew one myself."
"It's an interesting brew, and pretty good for what it is. But, one is enough before it becomes too much. A good one to try for a historical replication. It is what it should be. But, still in all, you really have to be in the mood for spruce and molasses (which normally I'm not). It's easier to drink than other historical beers I've had. Worth trying for the experience."
"Based on what I've read, this does feel like an authentic Colonial-era ale. It's dark, malty, a little bit sweet, and I can see myself having a glass of it along with some artisan bread for breakfast."
"Pours a deep clear mahogany out of a blue bottle. Faint herbal smell along with hint of evergreen. Unusual taste that is hard to compare to anything else I've tasted. Edgy finish rolls over to a smooth and balanced end. A novel brew, but don't think I'd consider it a session brew."
"A full pint from the beer engine produced a dark dark amber brew with a huge creamy head. Mouthfeel amazingly creamy, casks really augment the Yards brews (and maybe all beers). The spruce aroma was barely detectable at first but came across on tasting as a well-integrated and very enjoyable component to a very balanced and drinkable ale, surprisingly so. Rather than overwhelming, the spruce finish felt like I was standing in a forest or at least in my grandmother's living room with the heat from huge 1950s electric lights releasing vapors from the Christmas tree into the air (threatening to burst into flames). Highly enjoyable and worth several pints."
"This is a really tasty beer, but its so sweet and flavorful, Im not sure I could drink too many of these. Id say twos my limit."
"Again, this is a very nice beer. Not only is it the best of the series from Yards, it probably the best of the ""Historical"" brews that have been popping up here and there from various breweries in recent years. Definitely worth picking up a bottle or more if you see it."
"12 ounce blue bottle. Thanks BeerBeing!"
"Really good, quite different, very enjoyable, a must for anyone looking for unique and unusual beers of high quality."
"Worth a try."
"Cheers!"
"A unique beer, made from a recipe known to Benjamin Franklin. Pours a nice brownish-ruby red with a pale white-tan head. The head dissipates to a dusting in the pint, with some lacing. There seems to be very little nose on it, though - so I may have to revisit this later after living with the beer for a while. Taste and mouthfeel are truly delightful - nice roasty,well rounded malt flavor - hints of chocolate, spruce and a delicate bitterness rounding the finish. The beer has a nice 4.5% abv so could easily become a favored session brew for me. (Yes, you get the flavor of a good spiced beer, but a lot less of the guilt/abv - can you say winner?) I have to admit that I was skeptical at first, but I think Yards has produced a real winner with this brew - well worth seeking out and tasting. I'll definitely be having this the next time I'm at the City Tavern. As a side note, Yards' other Ales of the Revolution (Thomas Jefferson Ale, George Washington Porter) are quite tasty too, so drink a bit of history today!"
"Deep, rich, spicy flavor. Very Earthy and woody. Rustic. Elements of dark fruits. Smokey finish."
"Overall: A very unique taste, and not something you'd want more than one pint of. But for what it is, it's quite interesting and worth a try."
"Liked it enough to have a second. Probably could have had more."
"The taste is a nice roasted malt base with definite taste from the spruce. it is an odd ingredient to have but I really enjoyed it and would like to try it again. The beer is pretty drinkable but I think I could only have a few in a night. Maybe get a bottle or 2 to keep for awhile. Thanks to Ben Franklin."
"Kudos to Yard's for bringing this beer back to life from Ben's Recipe and for giving me the chance to taste the past."
"Drinkability: Interesting brew, but not my cup of tea; just a little too over the edge; I much prefered the Poor Richard's from Olde Hickory in North Carolina"
"I was intrigued, and happy to try it, even though my only exposure to real coniferous infusion has been OSA, but I like that a lot, so I had to give it a go. I was pleased, as it had a well-blended, rounded set of elements, as opposed to any one that jumps out and kicks you in the shins. Its toasty, roasty, piney and fine. The aroma thinned out a lot more rapidly than I expected, but that really was the onnly thing that I felt came up remotely short. It's a sassy style, and this one is just that as well. It goes down easily, especially with a chill in the air. I see a re-visit in the near future."
"Beer is good. Happy beering."
"Would definitely drink again if I have a chance to find."
"Too busy noticing the intriguing taste to take much notice of the mouthfeel."
"On tap at the City Tavern in Philadelphia. Deep copper with orange tints. Solid cream colored head. Distinct malt & hop aroma, but not real specific. The yeast character is prominent: lightly fruity, some vanilla, perfumy, quite unique. Fruity malt up-front, thin bodied, almost Belgian in a way with some earthiness. Some hop flavor mid-swallow leading into a bitterness that coats the back of the mouth and throat - very solid. Long lasting malt finish that just lays in your mouth. Very English except for the strength. A good pint that combines a good drinkability with a decent amount of complexity."
